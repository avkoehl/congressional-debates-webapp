APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
[April 18,
Ho. of Reps.
Civil Service Reform—Mr. Holman.
42d Cong....2d Sess.
local Federal offices in the several States must
be made elective. And above all, the fearful
volume of the '"blue book" must be reduced.
You can dismiss to advantage one half of the
incumbents of office, and if there is to be hon-
esty in public affairs the revenues must be
so reduced, $75,000,000 at least, that not one
dollar will be left for corruption.
While ours ought to be the most frugal of
all Governments, the least oppressive to its
people, it ii? rapidly becoming, through venality
in (he public service, the most expensive of
all Governments, if not the most profligate in
expenditure.
To illustrate the alarming increase of our
expenditures I call attention to the fact that
the appropriations made for the last year of
Mr. Buchanan's administration were $60,277,-
033, and these appropriations were believed to
be excessive. But to still more clearly present
the fact, let us compare the appropriations
made in the session of 1860-61, for the first
year of Mr. Lincoln's administration, with
those for the present fiscal year.
The appropriations for the first year of Mr.
Lincoln's administration (made before the
war expenditures began) are as follows:
Recapitulation.—Appropriations for *1861.
Legislative, executive, judicial, civil, and miscel-
laneous $12,504 060 83
Diplomatic and consutars  1,036,562 0J
Indian department, revolutionary, in-
valid, and other pensions   3,802,344 68
Army, fortifications, Military Academy,
and military roads  16,038,645 41
Suppression of Indian hostilities  3.254.512 20
Post Office* 21.66-i.151 86
Naval service  12,790,67611
Total $71,094,953 09
Deducting $5,391,350 03 from the $71,-
094,953 09 leaves the actual appropriations
made for the first year of Mr. Lincoln's ad-
ministration (made before the war expendi-
tures) the sum of $65,703,602 46 for the or-
dinary expenses of the Government, so that
eleven years ago $65,703,602 46, was deemed
sufficient to meet the current expenses of the
Government. I do not pretend that an ad-
ministration should now be condemned for ex-
pending a larger sum of money than this, for
our population has increased nearly twenty-
three per cent, since then. I would therefore
add twenty-five per cent, to these appropria-
tions as a very ample increase of the expend-
itures of this period over that, and ten per cent,
more for the depreciation of our currency ; in all
thirty-five per cent. Will any gentleman say
that this does not embrace all the elements
which ought to be considered in determining
what the expenses of this current year should
be in comparison with those of the year 1801 ?
How, then, should thecase stand?
Appropriations for 1861 ,?65,703.602 46
Add thirty five percent  22,996,260 85
$88,699,863 31
Will any gentleman say that this Government
cannot be carried on well and efficiently with
an annual appropriation of $88,699,863 31?
It would require very moderate economy to do
this, and I unhesitatingly assert that with just
economy the Government can be carried on
with the highest efficiency for a sum greatly
less than I have named, and that all expendi-
tures above that sum are for some other purpose
than the public good. And now, sir, what
are the appropriations for the present fiscal
year? I quote from the Executive Document
*This amount embraces a double appropriation
for $6,391,350 63 for the same object: one being an
appropriation out of any money in the Treasury,
and contingent upon the insufficiency of the reve-
nues of the Post Office Department, out of which
the other is appropriated to meet same. (See Mis-
aellaneous Document No. 44, Thirty-Sixth Congress,

be deducted the appropriations for pensions
and interest on the public debt and sinking
fund, for these are results of the war. How",
then, would the account stand?

coln's administration, with 'thirty-
five per cent, added thereto.,  88,699,863 31
Excess.
8.806,899 98
Can any gentleman question the fairness of
this statement? And what is the result?
With the most liberal allowance for the
increase of appropriations since 1801, the
appropriations for this year exceed those made
for that first year of Air. Lincoln's administra-
tion the enormous sum of $38,806,899 98.
And yet in addition to this there was appro-
priated for deficiencies for this current year
during the first session of this Congress
$1,254,100 75. May not the people well ask
this Administration, " What have you done
with this vast sum of money?" I should here
remark that these appropriations, except the
interest on the public debt and sinking fund,
which I have already deducted, have nothing
to do with the payments on the public debt.
These paymentjs are made out of the revenues
received in excess of the appropriations, the
entire revenues of the present year exceeding
the sum of $365,198,374. (Report of the
Secretary of the Treasury, pages 6 and 7.
It must be observed, too, that in all those
appropriations for the present year i have
excluded the interest on the public debt, sink-
ing fund, and pensions, for those are results
of the war.
This extraordinary expenditure of over
thirty-eight millions beyone the possible neces-
sities of Government should arrest universal
attention. Here is the real point of danger.
There is no stopping-place between an econom-
ical administration and a corrupt administra-
tion of Government. In contemplating this
utartling increase in the public expenditure,
can any man say there is no necessity for re-
form? I have confined myself in this exam-
ination to actual appropriations made, while
it is known that many millions of money re-
ceived by the Departments from sales of war
materials and from other sources have been
expended without any appropriation at all.
Whatever may be the fate of the measures
inaugurated by the commissioners of civil ser-
vice reform, I for one thank them for their
earnest and honest efforts in that behalf; but
1 do not see one ray of hope. A bill is laid
before this House to abolish a long list of use-
less offices, and then comes an appropriation
bill loaded down, with new leeches upon the ■
Treasury. The public business is postponed
for days that the stock-jobbers may be accom-
modated. But an hour ago, almost without
permitting a word of debate, you invest a body
of stock-jobbing adventurers with corporate
powers and vast franchises worth hundreds of
thousands to speculate on in the open market,
that a few favorite lobbyists may get rich at the
public expense and without labor.
How much of the time of Congress is em-
ployed in devising means by which ingenious
and skillful managers may amass fortunes?
No, sir, the reform that will save this Republic
from the hordes of plunderers; that will wrest
the public lands from the deadly grasp of
monopoly; that will drive the lobbyist from
the Capitol, save the public revenue from em-
bezzlement, and restore purity and honesty
and frugality in the public service, is a reform
that must extend all along the line—a reform,
sir, which the people aloDe can inaugurate.
Where can you turn, sir, without seeing the
necessity for retrenchment and reform? In
eleven years the current and ordinary expenses
of the Government, omitting pensions and in-
terest and payments on the public debt and
sinking fund, have swelled from $65,703,602 46
to $127,506,703 29.
In these eleven years almost the entire
available public domain, the once noble heri-
tage of the people, swelling to the imperial
magnitude of two hundred and seven million
acres lias been given away to a handful of
monopolists; you have more than duplicated
the wealth of the rich by giving them vast
franchises and placing the entire finances
of the country under their control ; you
have centralized in these eleven years the
wealth of the nation to an extent never known
before in the history of the world. Princely
estates and struggling poverty have followed
your policy with ilie certainty of death ; while
monopoly in banking, monopoly in manufac- '
ture, monopoly in commerce, monopoly in
railroads, and monopoly of lands have been
your specialties in legislation, and now have the
people at their mercy. Where, sir, is not
reform demanded? -I hold in my hand the
National Republican newspaper of ftiis city.
I find liere the testimony before the House
naval investigating committee on last Monday
evening. Colonel Hostner testified to having
collected a claim for $52,000 from the Navy
Department for the steamer Governor, lost
years ago during the war, the claim first pre-
sented last year. The Secretary of the Navy
rejected the claim. A distinguished Senator
went with Colonel Hosmer to see the Secre-
tary. The claim was allowed, the attorney's
fee being $26,000. This hp testified was a
usual contingent fee in such cases, or iioia
twenty-five to fifty per cent, of the amount.
No person, he says, in th'e Navy Department
got any of the money. It isa biief statement,
and such as you meet daily, and yet it is a
most suggestive statement. Are these the fees
paid in legitimate transactions? And genile-
meh say that no reform is neeessary> The
gentleman from Massachusetts [Mr. Butler]
sneers at the idea, and more than suggests that
there is no sincerity in the altempt on the the
part of the President of the United Stales or
anybody else. My honorable colleague [JJr.
Shanks] denounces it as a " western humbug,"
and the gentleman from California [Mr. Sar-
gent] says:
"Now sir, narrow-chested men say to us we must
P-^s this.appropriation; we must make some show
of believing in civii service-reform for fear of what
they may say of us at Cincinnati."—Globe, April 12.
It is too clear, sir, that the gentlemen who
now control public affairs in and out of Con-
gress do not intend there shall be any re-
form, for the very corruption that robs the
people and alarms good men every whetfe is
the. sinew of party strength. ; *
