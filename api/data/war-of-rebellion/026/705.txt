YORKTOWN, VA., May 7, 1863.

(Received 9.35 a. m., May 8, 1863.)

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

I ordered a reconnaissance up the Peninsula, above Williamsburg, yesterday. The enemy have withdrawn from Diascund Bridge, 15 miles above, where they had 2,000 men, and crossed the Chickahominy. They have doubtless gone to Richmond.

JOHN A. DIX,

Major-General.

SUFFOLK, May 7, 1863.

Major-General DIX:

Have ordered a court of inquiry in the Corcoran-Kimball affair.

Generals Jenkins, Davis, and Wilcox have the Lower Blackwater, headquarters at Franklin, with a full division. What is above at Blackwater Bridge, Zuni, and Ivor I am not advised, but probably one of Hill's divisions. All the people outside state that the generals told them the army would remain all summer, and raising crops was out of the question near the lines.

JOHN J. PECK,

Major-General.

FORT MONROE, VA., May 7, 1863.

Major-General KEYES,

Commanding, Yorktown:

The batteries are on board the John Rice; the spades and pickaxes on board a tug towing a float for a temporary wharf; materials and workmen for repairing the old wharf accompany the expedition, with 25,000 rations, forage, &amp;c.

Everything has been provided for. Push on the moment the transports arrive. Land and send your cavalry out at once to destroy the railroad bridge over the Pamunkey at White House. They should move rapidly, but circumspectly, as there may be enemy's troops after the dispersed Illinois cavalry. The Spaulding, with General Gordon, will be behind. Do not wait for her; she is faster than some of the other transports and will overtake you.

You should leave Yorktown by 8 o'clock if possible.

JOHN A. DIX,

Major-General.

FORTRESS MONROE, VA., May 7, 1863.

Major-General KEYES:

Commanding, Yorktown:

Five thousand infantry have gone, besides the batteries. I fear one of the latter will not be up till 3 p. m. You had better push on the moment the infantry gets up.

JOHN A. DIX,

Major-General.
