Commanding Cavalry Brigade:

In view of the report that the enemy are descending the north bank of the James, you will make every effort to discover as rapidly as possible its truth. Communicate the result of your scouting party the moment it is received, and take whatever steps you may think necessary to insure prompt information.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

HEADQUARTERS FIRST ARMY CORPS,March 8, 1865.

Brigadier General M . W. GARY,

Commanding Cavalry Brigade:

The order sent you last evening was an exact copy of a telegram received from General R. E. Lee. The left bank is, of course, the north side, down which the enemy is reported to be descending. The right bank is the south side, on which General Fitz Lee is. It is intended that your scouting party should go up this side ofthe river and discover whether the enemy is moving down, or where he is going, and communicate across the river to General Fitz Lee any information they may obtain, as well as report it to you.

Respectfully, your most obedient servant,

O. LATROBE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
