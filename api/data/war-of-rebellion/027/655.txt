By the COURT:

Question. At what did you fire?

Answer. When ordered to do so, I fired on Maryland Heights and on Loudoun Heights, whenever there was any appearance of the enemy.

Question. At men or at batteries?

Answer. Part of the time we fired at men; we could see some of them occasionally.

Question. What was the character of your pieces?

Answer. Four of my pieces were 3-inch rifles; the other two were light 12-pounders, smooth-bore.

Question. What was the distance of your battery from Maryland Heights?

Answer. I can hardly state; merely guess. It must have been 2,500 yards, I should think, from where I was to the batteries.

Question. What was the difference of elevation between your position and Maryland Heights-the position you fired at?

Answer. My battery was planted on Camp Hill.

Question. How much higher were the Maryland Heights than your position? You have given the distance; now, what was the difference of elevation?

Answer. I could not tell exactly.

Question. Was it 100 feet or 200 feet; was it very material?

Answer. Yes, sir, it was material.

Question. About how much?

Answer. I should think 100 feet or more.

Question. Did your shot reach the top of Maryland Heights?

Answer. Yes, sir; I think they did.

Question. Could you see?

Answer. Yes, sir; their battery was planted to the left of Maryland Heights, down toward the river. It was not so far as it would be on to Maryland Heights, right in front, where I was.

Question. On the slope, not on the high ground?

Answer. On the slope, just below the high ground.

Question. That was what you were firing at, was it?

Answer. Yes, sir; and then I fired at men as we could see them at different places.

By General WHITE:

Question. You shelled the woods generally?

Answer. Yes, sir.

By the COURT:

Question. How many did you lose in your battery, killed and wounded?

Answer. Three wounded, only slightly; none killed.

Question. Had you any means of ascertaining what the enemy's loss was?

Answer. I had none; only what I learned from different sources; some of the artillery officers of the Confederate army told me their loss was considerable; that is all I know about it. They did not give me any definite idea about it.
