MAY 24

Commodore PALMER:

Hold on and watch events, and be ready to take advantage of them.

D. G. FARRAGUT,

Admiral.

MAY 24.

Commodore PALMER;

To fire on the batteries above would injure our troops more than the enemy, perhaps.

JAMES ALDEN,

Captain.

MAY 24.

Admiral FARRAGUT:

I have now in the Mississippi the Albatross, the Arizona, and the Sachem, the latter at Bayou Sara; I have the Estrella in the Atchafalay; the Pittsburg was to report to Captain Walker yesterday, to assist him.

PALMER.

Commodore.

MAY 24.

Commodore PALMER:

Banks has forces on the Point. Augur is within 1 mile of the forts. The rest are near.

JAMES ALDEN,

Captain.

U. S. S. HARTFORD,

May 24.

General Grant has been every way successful. I hope Vicksburg by this time is ours. I have sent an officer over with dispatches for you. Any news from the army?

PALMER,

Commodore.

MAY 24.

Admiral FARRAGUT:

General Banks requests me to shell the west side of Thompson's Creek at midnight, to prevent any attempt of the enemy to escape on that side. You will understand the firing.

PALMER

Commodore.

MAY 24

Admiral FARRAGUT:

I have received a dispatch from Colonel Chandler, quartermaster, Brashear, requesting me to ask you what disposition is to be made of the coal towed around by the Anglo-American. He says they cannot get in. He has no boats to send for them, and asks if they had not better come back. Please let me know.

A. N. SHIPLEY,

Assistant Quartermaster.

MAY 26.

Admiral FARRAGUT:

Grierson's cavalry captured the two steamers on Thompson's Creek.

PALMER

Commodore.

MAY 26.

General BANKS:

A lieutenant of Grierson's cavalry is here, and says the enemy cannot escape between Fancy Point and the river. They must take the Bayou Sara road if they escape at all. Should you want me to fire in the direction indicated in your note, send up a rocket half an hour before I am to begin.

PALMER

Commodore.
