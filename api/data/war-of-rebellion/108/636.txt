Brigadier General J. B. HOOD,

Commanding Division:

GENERAL: I am instructed by the major-general commanding to direct that you move the two brigades of your division (Anderson's and Benning's) which have shown indications of the existence of small-pox to Cedar Creek, and put them on good, healthy camps on that stream and on its branches. The best point will be on the back road toward Staunton, and well off from the road. It is, of course, expected that every sanitary precaution that a good selection of camp, and thorough policing insures will be taken by the commanding officers. The general commanding desires also that the Seventh Georgia Volunteers, recently sent back, shoul be moved in the direction above indicated, but not too near the two brigades.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
