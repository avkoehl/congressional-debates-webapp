By order:

C. T. CHRISTENSEN,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF MISSISSIPPI,Vicksburg, May 18, 1865.

Lieutenant Colonel C. T. CHRISTENSEN,

Asst. Adjt. General, Military Division of West Mississippi:

I have received your communication dated the 15th instant, directing me to make an inspection of the posts in this department and report on the minimum amount of force needed here. I have no instructions as to my duties, and do not know what will be expected of me, and cannot definitely answer the communication. The department, according to existing orders, consists only of "the troops of the Military Division of West Mississippi on the river" within this State. If it is not intended to occupy anything else I think 1,500 men at Natchez and 1,500 men at Vicksburg sufficient. If the military occupation is to be extended over the State, it will take a considerable force of cavalry to suppress outlaws, and of infantry to hold certain interior posts or depots. All the cavalry, mounted, remaining in the department subject to my orders is the Ninth Indiana, about 350 strong. I have taken measures to have a detailed report of the strength of the force in the department, showing its condition and disposition.

I am, sir, very respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF NATCHEZ,Natchez, Miss., May 18, 1865.
