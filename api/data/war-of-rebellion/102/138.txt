you, I have halted the expedition about to move against the Indians with whom Colonel Leavenworth is treating. I am much of General Dodge's opinion, but prefer to await your decision in the matter. Please telegraph it to me as soon as you can.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Rear-Admiral S. P. LEE,

Commanding Mississippi Squadron:

ADMIRAL: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter asking for a series of the orders issued by me since I assumed command of this division. I have directed the adjutant-general to inclose them to you. In view of our conversation, I wrote fully to the President advising, for what I though sufficient reasons, the withdrawal of all trade restriction on the Mississippi and its tributaries and the release of the larger naval and military forces from a duty for which they are little fitted, which is repugnant to them, and which keeps them from service against the organized forces of the enemy, where their presence might determine the fate of battles. The awful calamity which has befallen the country has doubtless as yet prevented any reply, but in due time I will invite the attention of the Government to my letter. Please accept my thanks for you kindness in placing one of your vessels at the service of Colonel Sprague, my chief of staff. He goes on an important mission to the enemy's lines on the Red River.

I am, admiral, with great respect, your obedient servant,

JOHN POPE,

Major-General, Commanding.

All preparations must be made immediately in that view. It is probable that the details of route, &amp;c., may be somewhat modified, but I thing not to any considerable extent. I am sending to Arkansas 5,000 cavalry horses and 2,000 Canadian ponies, the latter for the reorganized Indian force at Fort Gibson; 3,500 wagons will be sent immediately to Arkansas with teams, &c., complete. It is hoped we may be ready to move from the Arkansas early in June, certainly by July 1. In this connection it is proper to inform you that I have sent Colonel Sprague to the enemy's lines, via mouth of Red River, with a letter to Kirby Smith, offering the same terms to his army as those accorded to General Lee. This I have done under instructions from Washington. Of course it is not easy to foretell the action of the rebel commander. I have informed him that by accepting these terms Western Louisiana and Texas will
