Major LA MOTTE,

Commanding Fairfax Station:

It is not impossible that Stuart may attempt such a raid in order to break up the railroad. Every precaution must be taken to guard against this, and the utmost vigilance exercised. The country south of the road in the vicinity of Accotink and Burke's Station should be constantly and thoroughly scouted. If you can find any trust-worthy men, residents or others, familiar with the country, you are authorized to employ them for this purpose, in addition to your own troops.

RUFUS KING,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
