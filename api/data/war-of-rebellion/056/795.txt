HEADQUARTERS, Snake Creek, December 8, 1863.

Colonel GAFLT:

SIR: On yesterday our pickets brought news that the enemy were moving up Lookout Mountain Valley. To-day Major Fuller sends in a courier that his pickets returned from the cove; that the enemy was on the mountain at Cooper's Gap, 15 miles this side of Chattanooga, in force. That gap comes down into the cove, I think, where they came over before. I think there ought to be some artillery in this gap, for this is the direct route for them, if they were endeavoring to get to the State road. They could come through here and strike for any point on the road below Resaca.

Yours,B. W. JONES,

Lieutenant Colonel, Comdg. First Regiment, Georgia State Guard.

General S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General:

The effort to get Knoxville was abandoned at present, because of re-enforcements said to be marching to its succor, and because my communication was cut, and no means of escape, in case of trouble, was left me but an eccentric retreat. My ammunition was getting to be scarce, with no prospect of replacing it, and all supplies except subsistence and forage were cut off from us. My idea in taking position
