COMMANDING OFFICER,

Holden:

Rebels passed west of Hobson's Station this morning just before daylight, Captain Box in pursuit. They have gone north of you.

SPRINGFIELD, MO., September 22, 1864.

Major-General ROSECRANS:

One of the letters captured from Major Conner is from Major R. J. Lawrence, chief quartermaster, dated at headquarters North Sub-District of Arkansas, Powhatan, Lawrence County, September 13, 1864. This officer says:

We are starting a force of recruiting officers to precede us into Missouri. I will be on the march for the State by Monday next. I am confident we will be at Jefferson City in less than ten days from the time we start. General Price has arrived with re-enforcements, and we think will exert an influence in the State that will be long felt and remembered.

Another letter from the headquarters of Brown's regiment, near Jacksonport, says:

We leave Missouri to-morrow. Shelby has 6,000 cavalry on White River. Price has left Princeton with 6,000 cavalry to [precede] us. General Shelby leaves for Missouri to-morrow by way of Bloomfield. General Price will form a junction with Shelby in a few days at that place; then we will march by way of Rolla direct to Jefferson City. We go to Jefferson City with 12,000 cavalry.

And all letters from officers are of the same effect and tenor. Stand Watie's command, 2,000 strong, is north of the Arkansas, and is reported to have captured the train from Fort Scott to Fort Smith and the entire escort, and now threatens Neosho.

Very respectfully,

JOHN B. SANBORN,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF SOUTHWEST MISSOURI,Springfield, Mo., September 22, 1864.

Major O. D. GREENE,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

Captain Human reports that 200 rebels camped at Quincy on the night of the 20th instant. This may be a portion of the same force that we fought near Bennett's Mill Monday. In some of the letters captured from Major Conner there were references to regiments of O. A. K. in the Missouri Valley, &c.

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

Major MILTON BURCH,

Commanding, Neosho:

It has been represented here that Stand Watie is advancing toward Neosho with a force of from 1,500 to 5,000. These reports cannot be traced to any particular source, and are doubtless exaggerated, if not
