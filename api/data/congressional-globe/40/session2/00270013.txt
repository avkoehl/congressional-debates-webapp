the said Stanton was then holding the said
office of Secielary for the Department of War
under :ind by reason of the appointment and
commission aforesaid ; and, not having been
removed from the said office by this respond-
ent, the said Stanton continued to hold the
same under the appointment and commission
aforesaid, at the pleasure of the President,
until the time hereinafter particularly men-
tioned ; and at no time received any appoint-
ment or commission save as above detailed.
And this respondent, further answering, says
that on and prior to the 5th day of August, A.
D. 1867, this respondent, the President of the
United States—responsible for the conduct of
the Secretary for the Department of War, and
having the constitutional right to resort to and
rely upon the person holding that office for
advice concerning the great and difficult public
duties enjoined on the President by the Con-
stitution and laws of the United States—be-
came satisfied that he could not allow the said
Stanton to continue to hold the office of Secre-
taryforthe Departmentof War without hazard
of the public interest; that the relations be-
tween the said Stanton and the President no
longer permitted the President to resort to him
for advice, or to be, in the judgment of the
President, safely responsible for his conduct
of the affairs of the Department of War, as by
law required, in accordance with the orders
and instructions of the President; and there-
upon, by force of the Constitution and laws of
the United States, which devolve on the Presi-
dent the power and the duty to control the
conduct of the business of that executive de-
partment of the Government, and by reason of
the constitutional duty of the President to take
care that the laws be faithfully executed, this
respondent did necessarily consider and did
determine that the said Stanton ought no longer
to hold the said ofliee of Secretary for the De-
partment of War. And this respondent, by
virtue of the power and authority vested in
him as President of the United States, by the
Constitution and laws of the United States, to
give effect to such his decision and determin-
ation, did, on the 5th day of August, A. D.
1867, address to the said Stanton a note, of
which the following is a true copy:
"Sir: Public considerations of a high character
constrain uie to bay that your resignation as Secre-
tary of War will be acceptcd."
To which note the said Stanton made the
following reply:
Wak Department,
■Washington, Augutt a, 1867.
Sir: y'our note of this day lias been received,
stating that "publieeonsiderationsof a high charac-
ter constrain you" to say "that my resignation as
Secretary of War will be accepted."
In reply X have the lionoi to bay that public con-
siderations of a hi«rh character, which alone have
induced me to continue at the head of this Depart-
ment, constrain me not to resign the office of Secre-
tary uf War bet'oie the next meeting of Congress,
Very respectfully, youis.
EDWIN M. STAJiTO.Y.
This respondent, as President of the Uni-
ted States, was thereon of opinion that, having
regard to the necessary official relations and
duties of the Secretary for the Department of
War to the President of the United States,
according to the Constitution and laws of the
United States, and having regard to the re-
sponsibility of the President for the conduct
of the said Secretary, and having regard to
the permanent executive authority of the office
which the respondent holds under the Consti-
tution and laws of the United States, it was
impossible, consistently with the public inter-
ests. to allow the said Stanton to continue to
hold the said office of Secretary for the De-
partment of War ; and it then became the offi-
cial duty of the respondent, as President of
the United States, to consider and decide what
act or acts should and might lawfully be done
by him, as President of the United States, to
cause the said Stanton to surrender the said
office.
This respondent was informed and verily
believed that it was practically settled by the
First Congress of the United States, and had
been so considered and, uniformly and in great
numbers of instances, acted on by each Con-
gress and President of the United States, in
succession, from President Washington to, and
including, President Lincoln, and from the
First Congress to the Thirty-Ninth Congress,
that the Constitution of the United States con-
ferred on the President, as part of the execu-
tive power and as one of the necessary means
and instruments of performing the executive
duty expressly imposed on him by the Consti-
tution of taking care that the laws be faith-
fully executed, the power at any and all times
of removing from office all executive officers
for cause to be judged of by the President
alone. This respondent had, in pursuance of
the Constitution, required the opinion of each
principal officer of the Executive Departments
upon this question of constitutional executive
power and duty, and had been advised by each
of them, including the said Stanton, Secretary
for the Department of War, that under the
Constitution of the United States this power
was lodged by the Constitution in the President
of the United States, and that, consequently,
it could be lawfully exercised by him, and the
Congress could not deprive hiin thereof; and
this respondent, in his capacity of President
of the United States, and because in that ca-
pacity he was both enabled and bound to use
his best judgment upon this question, did, in
good faith and with an earnest desire to arrive
at the truth, come to the conclusion and opin-
ion, and did make the same known to the hon-
orable the Senate of the United States by a
message dated on the 2d day of March, 1807,
(a true ropy whereof is hereunto annexed and
marked A,) that the power last mentioned was
conferred and the duty of exercising it. in fit
cases, was imposed on the President by the
Constitution of the United States, and that
the President could not be deprived ol this
power or relieved of this duty, nor could the
same be vested by law in the President and the
Senate jointly, either in part or whole; and
this has ever since remained and was the
opinion of this respondent at the time when he
was forced as aforesaid to consider and decide
what act or acts should and mighl lawfully be
done by this respondent, as President of the
United States, to cause the said Stanton to
surrender the said office.
This respondent was also then aware that
by the first section of "an act regulating the
tenure of certain civil offices," passed March
2, 1867, by a constitutional majority of both
Houses of Congress, it was enacted as follows:
"That every person holding any civil office to -which
he has been appointed by and with the advice and
consent of the Senate, and every person who shall
hereafter be appointed to any such office, and shall
become duly qualified to act therein, is and nhall be
entitled to hold such office until a successor shall
have been in like manner appointed and duly quali-
fied, except as herein otherwise provided : Provided^
That the Secretaries of State, of the Treasury, of
War, of the Navy, and of the Interior, the Postmas-
ter General, and the Attorney General, shall hold
their officer respectively for and during the term of
the President by whom they may have been ap-
pointed, and one month thereafter, subject to re-
moval by and with the advice and consent of the
Senate."
This respondent was also aware that this
act was understood and intended to be an ex-
pression of tho opinion of the Congress by
which that act was passed, that the power to
remove executive officers for cause might, by
law, be taken from the President and vested in
him and the Senate jointly; and although this
respondent had arrived at and still retained
the' opinion above expressed and verily be-
lieved, as ho still believes, that tho said first
section of the last-mentioned act was and is
wholly inoperative and void by reason of its
conflict with the Constitution of the United
States, yet, inasmuch as the same had been
enacted by the constitutional majority in each
of the two Houses of that Congress, this re-
spondent considered it to be proper to examine
and decide whether the particular case of the
said Stanton, on which it was this respondent's
duty to act, was within or without the terms
of that first section of the act; or, if within it,
whether the President had not the power, ac-
cording to the terms of the act, to remove the
said Stanton from the office of Secretary- for
the Department of War, and having, in his
capacity of President of the United States, so
examined and considered, did form the opin-
ion that the ease of the said Stanton and his
tenure of office were not affected by the first
section of the last-named act.
And this respondent further answering, says,
that although a case thus existed which, in his
judgment as President of the United States,
called for the exercise of the executive power
to remove the said Stanton from the office of
Secretary for the Department of War, and
although this respondent was of opinion, as is
above shown, that under the Constitution of
the United States the power to remove the said
Stanton from the said office was vested in the
President of the United States; and although
this respondent was also of the opinion, as is
above shown, that the case of the said Stanton
was not affected by the first section of the last-
named act; and although each of the said
opinions had been formed by this respondent
upon an actual case, requiring him, in his ca-
pacity of President of tho United States, to
come to some judgment and determination
thereon, yet this respondent, as President of
the United States, desired and determined to
avoid, if possible, any question of the construc-
tion and effect, of the said first section of the
last-named act, and also the broader question
of the executive power conferred on the Presi-
dent of the United States, by the Constitution
of the United States, to remove one of the
principal officers of one of the Executive De-
partments for cause seeming to him sufficient;
and this respondent also desirjd and deter-
mined that, if from causes over which lie could
exert no control, it should bccome absolutely
necessary to raisentid have, in some way, deter-
mined eitheror both ofthe said last-named ques-
tions, it was in accordance with the Constitution
of the United States and was required of the
President tlieieby, that questions of so much
gravity and importance, upon which the legis-
lative and executive departments of the Gov-
ernment had disagreed, which involved powers
considered by all branches of the Government,
during its entire history down to the year 1867,
to have been confided by the Constitution of
the United States to the President, and to be
necessary for the complete and proper execu-
tion of his constitutional duties, should be in
some proper way submitted to that judicial de-
partment of the Government, inlrusted by the
Constitution with the power, and subjected by
it to tho duty, not only of determining finally
the construction and effcct of all acts of Con-
gress, but of comparing them with the Consti-
tution of the United States and pronouncing
them inoperative when found in conflict with
that fundamental law which the people have
enacted for (he government of all their ser-
vants. Ami to these ends, first, that through
the action of the Senate of the United States,
the absolute duty ofthe President to substitute
some fit person in place of Mr. Stanton as one
of his advisers, and as a principal subordinate
ofiiccr whose official conduct he was respon-
sible for and had lawful right to control, might,
if possible, be accomplished withoutthe neees-
( sity of raising any one of the questions afore-
! said ; and, second, if this duty could not be so
! performed, then that these questions, or such
i of them as might necessarily arise, should be
| judicially determined in manner aforesaid,
I and for no other end or purpose this respond-
j ent, as President of the United States, on the
I 12th day of August, 1867, seven days after the
j reception of the letter of the said Stanton of
i the 5th of August, hereinbefore stated, didissue
to the said SUnton the order following, namely:
Executive Mansion,
Washington, Auyubt 12,1807.
Sir: By virtue of the power and authority vested
in 1110 as President by the Constitution and laws of
the United States, you are hereby suspended from
office as Secretary of War, and will cease to exeiciso
any and all functions pertaining to tho same.
You will at once transfer to General Ulysses S.
Grant, who has this day been authorized and em-
powered to act as Secretary of War ad interim, all
