Captain ALFRED MORDECAI,

Chief Ordnance Officer, Butler's Headquarters:

I am informed that the 100-pounder gun at Curtis' house and the water battery will probably be ready to mount to-night; also, perhaps, the Sawyer gun at Crow's Nest battery. I would, therefore, request that 100 rounds of ammunition for each of these guns, together with the implements and equipments, may be forwarded at once to the batteries, and invoiced to Captain S. P. Hatfield, First Connecticut Artillery, stationed at these headquarters. The magazines are in readiness, and I have ordered the cannoneers to the guns.
