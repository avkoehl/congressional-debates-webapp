Chaffin's Bluff:

Three division of enemy reported still in position fortifying where repulsed last evening near Davis' house, on Weldon railroad. I will endeavor to-day to dislodge him with four brigades of our infantry and the division of cavalry you have promised. Result would be more certain with a stronger force of infantry. Signal station reports just now one brigade of infantry, 100 wagons, and forty-nine ambulances passing toward our front on military road in rear of Battery 5.

General R. E. LEE,

Captured Yankee captain. Says object of expedition was to break up Weldon railroad and so weaken our forces in front as to increase chances of breaking our lines, intimating use of another move. The fire of our batteries this morning must have disconcerted enemy's plans.
