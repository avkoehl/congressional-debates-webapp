HEADQUARTERS CHALMERS' CAVALRY, Oxford, December 14, 1863.

Maj. G. W. HOLT:

MAJOR: I desire to make the following explanation as to the condition of my command when Grenada was taken for the benefit of my commanding generals, who, I have reason to believe, censure me for not having more men there to meet the enemy:

Before entering into particulars, however, permit me to say that since General Bragg's Tennesseeans always deserted him largely when he fell back from Tennessee, General Price's Arkansans nearly all left him when he retreated from Little Rock, and General Johnston's Mississippians when he fell back from Jackson, without any censure falling upon those generals, it would be hard to censure me
