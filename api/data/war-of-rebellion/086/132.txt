Colonel J. V. DU BOIS,

Chief of Staff, Sedalia, Mo.:

Colonel Holmes telegraphs me from mexico that he will move to-morrow night from Renick with 700 infantry and 300 cavalry to Fayette, and thence operate eastward. I suppose he has heard of the rebel force of which I made mention in my dispatch yesterday from other quarters and thinks they are at Fayette. If you object to the movement advise me. I have sent one howitzer to Perruque bridge, on North Missouri Railroad, and ordered Holmes to send 300 of the infantry there. It is the only great bridge on the road.
