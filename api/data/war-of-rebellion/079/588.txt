useful in the two preceding raids. I have no cavalry to patrol the roads and this must be substituted. The wires are cut every day, and I am in constant fear that trains will be taken; one is now an hour overdue from Huntsville and the wires down here. No enemy this side of Elk River. Colonel Thornburgh, who has gone to Nashville, can tell you all about our affairs here. You will find them interesting.

Brigadier General John T. CROXTON,

Shoal Creek, via Pulaski:

Your dispatch of yesterday, reporting your position on Shoal Creek, received. Hold that position as long as possible, so as to enable General Stanley to get into position at Pulaski. Should you be compelled to fall back do so with the view of covering Stanley's march from Athens. I have ordered General Hatch to co-operate with you. Acknowledge receipt and report state of affairs.

Your dispatch directing me to cover General Stanley's march to Pulaski received. Can you tell me where General Hatch is? I have heard nothing from him. Citizens came out of Florence to-day with passes signed by Major Austin, provost-marshal, Lee's corps.

Major-General ROUSSEAU,

Columbia:

Your dispatch received. Communicate with Stanley, and you and he must keep Hood back until I can get Schofield up. Croxton and Hatch ought to be able to retard Hood long enough for Stanley to get troops into position. I have sent you this morning the Fifth Iowa Cavalry and detachments of other regiments, which will amount to something like 1,000 men. Have just heard from Croxton; he holds Shoal Creek, seven miles east of Bough's Factory, nine miles north of Florence.
