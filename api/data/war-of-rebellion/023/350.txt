Do not know of Nelson's situation. He was at Edgefield Junction at 10 o'clock with his regiments and two batteries, going to Gallatin, Tenn., 18 miles beyond.

The fight near Gallatin, Tenn., was at about 9.30 a.m., and near the river at about 12.30 p.m. Wynkoop in Lebanon about 2 or 3 o'clock. Rumored that the force Clarksville has taken Fort Donelson.
