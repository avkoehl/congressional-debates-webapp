THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

sir, gave rise to that communication' A'resolu-
tion adopted by the Senate restricting the consti-
tutional power of the Pres'dent in nominating for
office. It was adopted without reflection, at the
instance of a Senator fiom Mississippi, with the
design to protect the new States from having per-
sons from other States bent within their limits to
ho'd offices whicn he and most of us supposed
citizens of the State where the office was located
could be found as weh qualified to discharge the
duties The motive was a good one, but the restric-
tion was in derogation of the constitutional power
vested in the President He so viewed it, and de-
termined not to be thus deprived ot his legitimate
light, hence the message which the Senatoi hadde-
claied to bean insult to tne Senate Why, sir, the
Senate itself, on reexamination, coincided in opin-
ion with the President, and lepealed the obnoxious
resolution I now ask the Senator if he will risk
his reputation, as a sound constitutional lawyer,
by denying that the President was ught in refusing
to be so restricted'.
S.i, a resolution offered by a Senator from North
Carolina (not now a member of this body) pend-
ing the famous Panama question, has been read to
justify the Senate in adopting this Mr Presdent,
they are entirely dissimilar. There the then Pi evi-
dent had made known his intention to institute a
new mission, without the advice of the Senate or
the approbation of Congress The Senate, as his
constitutional advisets, believed it their duty to
inteipose and prevent the adoption of a measure
then in a tram for execution, opposed, as they
believed, by the plainest principles of the Consti-
tution It was advice, sir, salutary advice, not
censure can the same be said of this resolution,
charging the President with a violation of the Con-
stitution and of law
Mr Presidem., the Senator form Mameboasted
that he is no Jackson man—that he Will not bo.v
the knee to Baal Sir, this is not the fii st time the
friends of the Administration have been taunted
with subserviency to executive views I have
heretofore disdained to notice it. Sir, I was known
to those who placed me here as the personal and
political friend of General Jackson I havegiven
to his Admimstiation a firm and zealous, if not
ablesuppoit, whenevei,inmy judgment, the meas-
ures proposed were calculated to advance the gen-
eral inteiests; but, sir, it has been my fate, m the
discharge of what I conceived to be my duty, to
stand arrayed against one of his most important
measures: I allude to the bill of the last session,
known generally as the Force Bill Was subser-
viency manifested then' Sir, on other occasions |
I have differed with the views of the Piesident,
and fiankly made known to him that difference—
and little do those know him who suppose that
thus to act either lessens his respect or diminishes
his friendsh p for the individual. No, sir, high-
minded and honorable himself, he fully appreciates
these qualities in others Babe subserviency can
never win his respect noi command his favor Sir,
the Senator from Mime informs us, he obeys no
mandates So it seems, sir, neither herenoi else-
where—heie it is not desired, else* here it may be
expected, but, sir, I leave the gentleman to settle
it with those who may conceive they have a light
to command
Mr. Piesident, this communication has been
stigmatized by the Senator ftom Mississippi, and
others, as a feble, miseiable production, not cal-
culated to produce any effect on the country If
such, sir, be its chaiacter, why is it so violently
assailed before it has faiilymadeus appearance in
tre Senate' Why is the proposition now made to
, recuse its reception' Does it not seem as if gen-
thmen were conscious that the resolution they
ht.ve adopted will not bear the test of fair exami-
nation ' But, sir, be that as it may, lam surprised
at the proposition of the Senator fiom Mississippi
Has he not suffered Ins " indignant feelings," as
he terms them, to hurry him into an indiscieuon,
which his vigorous, intellect will condemn' Sn,
this paper cannot be smothered, the very attempt
to do £>o, willgue to it increased impoitanceii, the
eyes of the country It will go forth—it will be
lead with avidity, ours are en intelligent, leflect-
ing, sober people—denunciation and abuse of the
Piesident, even by those occupying seats in this
•uigust assembly, will rot tuin them aside from a
calm eiammation of the whole matter.   Yes, sir,
not only this paper, but the resolution also will be
scrutinized—the motive for its adoption will be
canvassed and undeistood, and gentlemen will
find that they mustabidethedecision Therecan
be no escape
Mr LEIGH said there was one sentiment ex-
pressed by the honoiable gentleman from Missouri
[Mi Bünton] in wmch he entirely concurred It
was the solemnity and importance of the present
occasion He declared belore his God, that upon
the fate of these lesolutions and the disposition of
this question, he believed depended the perma
nency of the Constitution handed down to us by
our fathers But there should be nothing done
but in a sp'rit of calmness and rnodeiation, and
upon full deliberation, and yet hefeltthathe could
not now discuss this question without giving uttei
anee to feel ngs of passion, which would bethought
by others unbecoming theotcasion and hisstation,
feelings which he now felt boiling in his bosom
He believed he felt the dignity and importance of
the station he filled here, and nev-r would he do
aught to impair that dignity He therefore moved
that the Senate do now adjourn
The Senate then adjourned

The House resumed the consideration of the
resolution submitted by Mi Mardis, with the
amendment moved by Mr. Corvun
The motion pending thereon being to lay the
resolution^ and the amendment on the table—
Mr CLAY said, as he found it was desired by
many members that this apparently int°immable
discussion shou'd be proceeded with, notwith-
standing the House had decided the questions
involved by it, he would not oppose this wish
for discussion, and he would, therefore, withdiaw
his motion to heve the resolution laid on the table.

THE GENERAL  APPROPRIATION BILL.
The question pending being on the amendment
submitted thereto by Mr Vance, to reduce the
silary to be paid to the Commissioner of the Land
Office to $2 000—
The motion was rejected   Ayes 55, noes 77.
The qufstion then being taken on the amend-
ment of Mr. Vamce, to deduct fiom the compen-
sat on now allowed by law to the clerks in the
Denartments of State, fieasury, War,ond Navy,
including those in the General Land Office, at the
ute of SJj per centum per annum, it was íe-
jected   Ayes 43, noes 85
The question bemi stated to make a similar
deduction fiom all officeis of the customs, (25 per
cent  peí ai nut,)
Mr VANCE went into a comparative statement
of the number of custom-house officers, and the
salai íes paid them m 1802, with the establishment
in 1332—the whola numbei in the former year
being only 577 offWis throughout the United
States, whilst in 1832 the number was 1,600,
and of which there was employed in New York
alone 332, being nearlyas many there, and receiv-
ing as much money as it had cost thewhole coun-
try 11 the Jeffersonian times Thirty of these
officers íeceived salaries in the aggregate amount-
ing to $80 437, and the 332 in the whole leceiving
£,408,791 21 annually He referred to this, as it
had been said in the former discussion, that if any
of these officers could be shown to be too largely
paid, members would vote for a reduction. Twenty
individuals he now found íeceived amongst them
§115,000—which would give to each of these
£,5,000 and upwards, and it this statement did not
bung to those honorab'e membeis a conviction
that such salines would bear the reduction he
sought for by 1 is amendment he knew not what
else would Seventy three others had in the aggre-
gate §218,054 43 paid them, which he also sup-
posed wouldb ar to be reduced These statements
were to be found in the Biue Book, to which he
would refer, and in which he found that whilst in
1802 the salaries paid in Boston were §47,454, in
Philadelphia §56,115 75, and in New York §62,-
347 ,5_, total amount of $166 282 92, for these
tl ree cit,es, the annual expense in 1832, for
Boston was $120,204 44, in New Yolk $408,-
791 23, and inPhiladelnl la $99,867 57—anaggie-
gate amount of $637 873 26, leavmg an excess
over that paid formeily of ¿471 010 Tie referred
gentlemen to the Blue fio< k for the peipetual m-
eiease in number and  a'anes which had accrued
This was to be found in the post office and civil
list, as well as the customs What he proposed,
