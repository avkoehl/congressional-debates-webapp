[JOHN A. BOLLES,]

Major and Aide-de-Camp, Provost-Judge.

SUFFOLK, VA., March 28, 1863.

Major-General DIX:

Have just returned from Western Branch by water. Found a deserter there. Several came in this morning. All agree with the statements made heretofore of not less than 12,000 or 15,000 immediately on the river; expecting more. General Longstreet was there last week and with Jenkins came over at Blackwater Bridge and recrossed near Zuni. Your new regiment of Virginia near Zuni. Cavalry force increased by another regiment.

JOHN J. PECK,

Major-General.

SUFFOLK, March 28, 1863.

Major-General DIX:

You are at liberty to say to General Halleck that I concur with your views touching the command of the cattle [cavalry?] as expressed in your telegram of this date.

JOHN J. PECK,

Major-General.

SUFFOLK, March 28, 1863.

Major-General DIX:

Have just returned from below the Western Branch with gunboat. Yesterday rode over the east side with my horse, devoting the day. Can be crossed most anywhere with three pontoons. Shall commence works at the point selected by the rebels for the new road. Their piles were down for the bridge. We have removed most of them. The position is half way, or 4 miles by water, while only two direct corn [roads]. One air [brigade] or two regiments there will make the line secure.

JOHN J. PECK,

Major-General.

SUFFOLK, VA., March 30, 1863.

Major-General DIX:

A sergeant of the engineers deserted Saturday night to the enemy. He has been on the works all the time and can give much valuable information. Sharp fellow, and probably has been bought.

JOHN J. PECK,

Major-General.
