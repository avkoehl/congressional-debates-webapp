roads to Haw's Shop, following the same route it took in the advance. The Third Division will hold the Hanover Court-House, Cold Harbor, and Richmond roads until the road to Haw's Shop has been cleared by the other divisions, occupying so much of the breast-works crossing these roads as may be necessary for this purpose. As soon as the roads are cleared the Third Division will follow the First on the road to Haw's Shop. The chief of artillery will assign two batteries to move with each division. The remaining batteries will precede the command at dark. The hospitals will be broken up at once. Such ambulances as are not needed for the wounded will go with the train, except ten to accompany each division. Where the route of the Second Division intersects that of the First, the Second Division will take precedence.

By command of Major-General Hancock:

FRANCIS A. WALKER,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

It is supposed that guides will be furnished at Haw's Shop; still, at present, the major-general knows nothing further than the orders already given; still, men have been sent over the route who serve as guides. In case they return in time, commanders will please see that their commands are all off as promptly and as quietly as possible. General Birney is to relieve the pickets, and his headquarters are in the field to the right of the point where his headquarters were the first day.

Lieutenant-Colonel WALKER:

COLONEL: I am pressing forward the skirmish line at all points, which draws the fire which you may be able to hear at corps headquarters, and which is somewhat heavy for a skirmish fire. Shall have more exact information shortly. Last night my whole skirmish line was close upon the enemy's line of battle, and I infer that the same in the case this morning.

Respectfully,

FRANCIS C. BARLOW,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
