The Thirteenth Missouri and Seventh Kansas have arrived and are feeding here, and will proceeded at once to De Soto. They number about 1,200. Please have forage for four days sent to De Soto for that number, and if more come include that number. Let this be forwarded to-day.

Major General A. J. SMITH,

De Soto:

We have pretty authentic inside information showing that Price did not bring more than 6,000 men. He may have been driven up into the southwest with his column, which was to march by way of Rolla. We can whip him if we can catch him.

Brigadier-General SMITH,

Mineral Point:

Captain Arnold, formerly of my staff, just from Little Rock, says that General Mower, with about 5,000 infantry and 4,000 cavalry, started on Saturday week from Brownsville, Ark., after Price. We may expect to hear from him to-day or to-morrow.

Major-General.

DE SOTO, September 27, 1864.

Major-General ROSECRANS:

I was informed a large rebel force made their appearance at Mineral Point this morning. I ordered Colonel Mills to fall back to Big River brigade. He is now there with a train. All the rolling-stock on the road that was south of this is now here. All the public stores at Pilot Knob were sent up by train, except those sent by wagon train. General Ewing has a good supply of rations and ammunition in the fort. I have not heard from him since 11 a. m. He was then fighting with artillery. Colonel Catherwood is at Pevely, with orders to picket well the roads and sent out scouts on all the principal roads, and particularly toward Farmington. I have nine regiments here, with all the cavalry. I can get no definite information of the whereabouts of the enemy. I have scouts out in different directions. It is my impression the enemy will cross the railroad north of this.

A. J. SMITH,

Major-General.

SAINT LOUIS, MO., September 27, 1864.

Major General A. J. SMITH,

De Soto:

Yours 12.45 p. m. just received. I think Ewing must have failed to get your-orders in time. I hope they may not get those wagons. Your dispatch says the rebels have made their appearance at Mineral Point.
