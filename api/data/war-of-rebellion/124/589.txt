Now, this deficiency cannot all be charged to the towns which are not included in the lists of July 25 and 27.

It is understood that there are 341 towns in Massachusetts, and it would appear that of them all but forty-four are in excess. You will therefore perceive that egret discrepancy between the records of the adjutant-general of Massachusetts and the muster- rolls on file in the Adjutant-General's Office in this city. This doubtless aries from the fact that men raised in towns of Massachusetts have not been mustered and have never really been in the service of the United States, and the only plan I devise to arrive at means of ascertaining the real number of men to be credited to any town will be to compare the names of all the men the town calism to have raised with the names of all the men mustered into the U. S. service from those towns, as shown by the muster-rolls. This could be done by sending here the adjutant- general of the State with the list of names, and though it would involve considerable labor, I think with the facilities which could and would be cheerfully rendered here an accurate list of the exact number furnished and mustered into the service from each town could be obtained. Of the importance of having such a list it is hardly necessary to speak, as it would afford a satisfactory basis for the settlement of present questions at issue and id inthe determination of any that may arise.

It is proper to state also that the deficiency of 6,301 has not been considered in making up the quotas under the present draft.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JAS. B. FRY,

Provost-Marshal-General.
