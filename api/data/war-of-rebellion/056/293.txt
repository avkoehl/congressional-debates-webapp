HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,Chattanooga, Tennessee, December 1, 1863.

Maj. General G. H. THOMAS,

Commanding Army of the Cumberland:

GENERAL: If the steamer Dunbar is not provided with a piece of artillery she should be, and with a detail of men to work the gun.

A dispatch just received from Foster states that a large number of rebel cavalry has shown itself about Maynardville, which is believed to be Longstreet's flanking column to protect his march by the Rutledge road.

Yours, &c.,

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General.
HDQRS. CHIEF ENGINEER, DEPT. OF THE CUMBERLAND,Chattanooga, Tennessee, December -, 1863.

Maj. General GEORGE H. THOMAS,

Commanding Department of the Cumberland:

GENERAL: I respectfully recommend that the works constructed for defense of this place have the following designations, viz:

First. The entire line from Singal Hill to the reservoir to be called Fort Sherman.

Second. The fort heretofore known as Fort Wood to be called Fort Creighton, after the colonel of that name killed at Ringgold, November 27.
