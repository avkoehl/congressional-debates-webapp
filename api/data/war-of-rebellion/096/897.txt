Major-General HANCOCK,

Cumberland, Md.:

A dispatch addressed to you from General Sheridan has not reached me until this moment.* It incloses a dispatch from General Sheridan to General Halleck, and I have sent it direct to General Halleck. It contains some instructions which I will send you in cipher, and, though in much doubt, I shall proceed to execute them.

Major-General HANCOCK,

General Sheridan captured and destroyed eleven pieces of artillery, instead of eight. Three pieces were sent in by Colonel Thompson, but he was obliged to destroy them. Thompson was fiercely attacked in his rear by General Rosser yesterday at Rude's Hill.

Major-General HANCOCK,

Cumberland, Md.:

After reading General Sheridan's letter to you I sent for Colonel Thompson, the commander of the detachment, and he tells me that the pontoons ordered to Mount Jackson were to enable him to cross. I am now quite sure that the occasion has passed for which the order was given. You may be sure that I fired a salute.
