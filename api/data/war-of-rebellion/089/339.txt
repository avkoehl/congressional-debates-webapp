HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS, October 25, 1864.

Lieutenant STRYKER:

I have seen Sergeant Jordan and learn that he observed a dust on the road mentioned. The dust extended from a quarter to half a mile but he was unable to discover any movement or tell from which direction the dust originated. It was near dark and very hazy. He merely stated that the dust was three but could give no opinion at all in reference to it.

R. P. STRONG,

Signal Officer.
