CHARLESTON, S. C.,

October 12, 1863.

Honorable JAMES A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War, Richmond, Va.:

Department letter of 7th instant is received. Clingman's brigade holds Sullivan's Island; Evans' Christ Church Parish; Hagood's and Colquitt's, James Island, and Wise's, rest of Saint Andrew's Parish. Anderson's has just left for Chattanooga. Not one regiment can be spared without jeopardizing safety of Charleston, but Clingman's brigade will be sent to General Whiting when called for, as instructed by War Department, unless otherwise ordered.

RICHMOND, October 12, 1863.

General G. T. BEAUREGARD,

Charleston, S. C.:

General Lee telegraphs information of a scout, just received, that General Gillmore has been ordered to take Charleston at all hazards, and, failing in this, to make a flank movement to seize Branchville. He, adds, this does not look like a probable movement, but may indicate some early intended action against Charleston.

J. A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War.

CHARLESTON, S. C.,

October 12, 1863.

Honorable JAMES A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War, Richmond, Va.:

Dispatch communicating information from General Lee agrees more with indications of enemy's plans and purposes vigilantly observed here than the apprehensions of General Whiting of an attack on Wilmington, indicated in your letter of the 7th instant, received this evening. Therefore hope Martin's brigade will be placed subject to my call.

G. T. BEAUREGARD.
HDQRS. DEPT. SOUTH CAROLINA, GEORGIA, AND FLORIDA,Charleston, S. C., October 12, 1863.

If necessary, you are also authorized to call on the officer commanding in Middle Florida, for assistance.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

[THOMAS JORDAN,]
