her two children. Tell them if they could only come and talk to me I would not be so lonesome; however, Mr. Magraw talks pretty well and we are quite comfortable.

Adams &amp; Co. can forward letters. I heard yesterday from my family, the first since I have been here. They were all well or tolerably so. I wish Old Abe could hear some of his poor prisoners talk. I think the reason he don't ask for an exchange is that he is afraid to let them come back after the treatment they have received from the United Statement Government. Poor fellows! duped into a war they did not understand and left to pine away in prison. The day of retribution must come before long. If the Robespierre policy of Thurlow Weed is to prevail there are about 2,000 in this city, poor, innocent victims will stretch hemp instantly.

Yours, very truly,

OFFICE OF THE U. S. MARSHAL,

New Haven, Conn., September 11, 1861.

Honorable SIMON CAMERON, Secretary of War.

SIR: In obedience to your order* I have stopped the sale, keeping for sale or circulation of that damnable secession sheet the New Yourk Daily News in the State of Connecticut.

The order has been well obeyed with one exception. There is on the Naugatuck Railroad a newspaper traveling agent by the name of George A. Hubbell, # a noisy secessionist, in a spot where he is doing great mischief by his treasonable talk, and also by his disobedience of this wholesome order of our Government which has given so much satisfaction to our truly loyal men all over the State. He has violated the order and I have written evidence from respectable citizens that he has made his brags of it, and says he will repeat it in spite of me. I have no power or authority to arrest him by any law known to me, and still I have sent him word that I will do so if he persisted in his course. Now all I want is an order from yourself or Mr. Seward to him to some of the forst in New York. Such an order would be put in force instanter, and would in my opinion do more good than any order that has yet been from the Government to be executed in this State, unless it was for the arrest of Ellis B. Schnabel ## of your State, which I am most happy to add pleased everybody.

Will you place favor me with a telegraphic reply as soon as possible and garnt this most proper request, and oblige many loyal citizens of Connecticut as well as your obedient servant,

DAVID H. CARR,

U. S. Marshal.

SIR: I have the honor to report the reception of your favor of the 10th, the contents of which have been carefully noted; also the orders forwarded by Captain Taylor. For my answer, in part, I would refer
