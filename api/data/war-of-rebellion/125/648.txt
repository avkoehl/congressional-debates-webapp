DAVENPORT, IOWA, August 30, 1864.

Brigadier General J. B. FRY:

I understood that our schedule of counties should be adopted. An examination since my return satisfies me that justice cannot be done us without, as you kept no account with counties prior to October, 1863, and most of our excesses are before that time.

Please instruct Major Duncan to adopt it and give us time to arrange it. With this and a little extension I will hope to raise our number of volunteers.
