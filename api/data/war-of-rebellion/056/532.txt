LA GRANGE December 29. 1863.

Major-General HURLBUT:

Morgan is at Hudsonville. Second Brigade is on the advance on the trail of the enemy. I sent Morgan's battery to him this morning with escort.

The Seventh Kansas Cavalry is at Lamar, to scout toward Salem and communicate with Morgan. Colonel Mizner will start for Hudsonville this evening with all of his brigade except Sixth Tennessee, which is at Pocahontas marching for Saulsbury. Two hundred of Morgan's mounted men have gone to join him.

I am expecting couriers from the south every moment. Will report when they arrive.

Major General S. A. HURLBUT,

Memphis, Tennessee:

Courier just in from cavalry at Hudsonville. The armed force of enemy went toward Lockhart's Mill, on Coldwater; unarmed force, wagons, and plunder went toward Holly Springs. Citizens report enemy intended to camp at Wash. Taylor's plantation, 10 miles west of Holly Springs.

Prisoner captured says three regiments unarmed went to Taylor's plantation last night. A courier went through last night with orders for whole command to go to Panola to cross Tallahatchie, which is too high to cross above Panola.
