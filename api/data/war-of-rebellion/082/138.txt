General Sheridan wants fifteen pontoon boats; if he can't get that many, say twelve. The general desires you to see Major Duane, chief engineer, Army of the Potomac, and if we are to have a pontoon train have Major Duane order it here at once so that it may be put in shape.

HEADQUARTERS SIEGE TRAIN,July 10, 1864.

Captain GEORGE T. BALCH,

Assistant Chief of Ordnance:

DEAR CAPTAIN: Will you please order that all ammunition shipped to me shall be sent on barges or schooners? I have orders to keep my train afloat, except the daily demands, and have no facilities for transferring from steamers to barges here. If the quartermasters understand this from the ordnance officers all trouble will be avoided. I require about twenty sets of powder measures, a dozen gunner's levels, some dozen pounds of chalk, with a large supply of friction-primers, say 50,000 and of assorted fuses, say 20,000. Please direct them and all my train to be invoiced to Captain Hatfield. I constantly receive invoices myself. He is my acting ordnance officer, and I am responsible for nothing personally.

Your obedient servant,

HENRY L. ABBOT,

Colonel First Connecticut Artillery, Commanding.
