HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS, August 16, 1864.

General MEADE:

This division of cavalry is General W. H. F. Lee's (Rooney Lee), General Lee's son, not Fitz Lee's, who is the oldest division commander, but the one who was in Fort La Fayette. They are both named Fitz Lee, but one is known as Fitz Lee and the other as Rooney Lee among their companions. This command left Reams' Station day before yesterday at 11 o'clock and arrived here yesterday morning. I have a rebel color and some prisoners-10 officers and 153 men. A staff officer of General Birney reports that he has taken three colors, but has only got hold of one as yet. Colonel Dent will return with the prisoners captured, except those taken by the cavalry, which have not yet come.

General GRANT:

One brigade from which General Birney took prisoners arrived here last night. An officer from General Field's staff is taken and says there are 15,000 men in my front. A prisoner says that General Lee crossed over here from Petersburg to-day. The enemy are attacking Birney's right pretty strongly.

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,Major-General.

P. S.-General Birney's loss is considerable, and he has captured some more prisoners.
