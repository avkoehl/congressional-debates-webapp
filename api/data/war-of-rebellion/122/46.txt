WASHINGTON, January 22, 1861.

Honorable JOSEPH HOLT,

Secretary of War, Washington, D. C.:

SIR: Information which comes to me in a shape which is entitled to great confidence and respect satisfies me that a military force beyond the amount in reach and available for immediate exigencies is necessary at some points for local defense and the protection of the public property.

This is said to be especially the case for the protection of this District and the public property here, ae arsenal and custom-house and sub-treasury at Saint Louis, and perhaps at other points where the necessity may be so great.

If you concur with me in this opinion, you will oblige me by having a bill prepared authorizing the President, if he shall deem it necessary,
