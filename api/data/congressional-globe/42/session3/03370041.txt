Europe, an equal uniformity will in dun time
become more striking in American States,
where there are uo such differences. The
Roman and Colt, the Saxon and Norman,
commingle in Englishmen, and if they are now
thoroughly fused and homogenious, will not
time work out a similar result on this side of
the Atlantic?
The only obstacle that ever existed to the
weldiug together of all parts of our common
country was slavery, and that having been
removed, we shall soon develop our character
as a nation. Any incoherency cannot be per-
manent. Grouped as we have been, and as
we shall be, our future destiny is assimilation
of the leading features which give tone and
character to the several States. The records
show that the blood of one State is no stranger
in any other. War itself has brought us nearer
together, pounded ns into cohesion, and com-
pelled a better acquaintance. War is in some
sense magnetic, and when the struggle is over
it no longer repels, but attracts. Some virtues
as well as vices must be and are reciprocally
admitted. All the States are locked arm in
arm. One cannot be benefited without con-
ferring benefits upon all. Nor can one be
injured without giving pain to all. The nation
is equally interested in the advancement of all
of its children. Their good name is the com-
mon property of all. Under these circum-
stances it is of great importance that the col-
leges aided and to be aided by the Govern-
ment shall be of equal capacity and of equal
scope and character. Vigor and health and
equal favor must be secured to all.
The men turned oat from these institutions,
having all acquired Botne peculiar value, will
spread ont and enrich the whole land, and
finally will belong not so much to the States
where educated as to the States honored by
their subsequent residence and career. Had
Kentucky any less affection for Clay because
he was raised in Virginia? Was the elo-
quence and wit of Corwin diminished by being
transplanted from Kentucky to Ohio? Was
Illinois ever less proud of Douglas because
of his Vermont origin? Did New York ever
twit Silas Wright with being born in Massa-
chusetts or of being educated in Vermont?
When did Massachusetts underrate her great
"carpet-bagger," Webster, because he was
born and educated in the Granite State ?
Were the names of Hamilton and Gallatin
ever bedimmed on account of their foreign
birth ? These questions are all answered by
an emphatic negative. Birth-places are acci-
dents, but homes are the result of design and
free will. A citizen of any State is now a
citizen of the United States. Already an
American has an unmistakable stamp upon
him which makes him recognizable at home
and abroad. Doubtless this is largely due
to the general independent ownership and
occupation of land and houses, and to other
prominent and peculiar virtues, but who shall
say lack of culture, also, may not furnish
some share of the ear-marks? We are not
yet finished in the great workshop of Provi-
dence, and can afford to lose something and
acquire more, but whatever we are, we shall
be wholly American. Though all the world
contributes to our materials, we alone shall
give them form and national symmetry.
Shall not each State, then, have the power to
give equal culture to its people?
And here I close this branch of the argu-
ment— not because it is exhausted, but because
I think enough has been presented—in behalf
of equal favor to all the States, as proposed in

THE PUBLIC DOMAIN.
No nation ever held so rich and vast an
estate in lands as has been and now is held by
the United States, and nowhere have been
found lands of equal fertility, with such a
diversity of soil and climate, to be disposed
of so cheaply, selling in the morning of our
history at merely a nominal price ; at noon
doubled in value by divisions, half-and-half,
with railroads; at evening made free to all
actual settlers, and at all times ungrudgingly
set apart for the endowment of schools and for
soldiers' bounties. The policy pursued, though
sometimes pushed rather impetuously, on the
whole has largely contributed to the advance-
ment of the country, and is fairly entitled to
be set down as enlightened statesmanship.
But the public domain has been clipped of its
magnificent proportions; it is no longer illimit-
able; its grand and beneficent influences in
the coming age will be brought to an end,
and, as its bulk diminishes, its value, like
the remainder of the sibylline books, is to be
far more highly prized. When those who
come after us shall review the disposition
which shall have been made of what may be
called the continental resources of the better
half of the New World, I am persuaded that
no part of our policy will show better fruits
or secure a more grateful approval than that
which has sought and still geeks to elevate our
whole people by the proper and liberal endow-
ment of schools and colleges. The time may
some when "Peace on earth and good will to
man" may be triumphant, and martial boun-
ties be no longer required; the time may
come when population will have outrun cheap.
bread, and then we shall no longer teaze the
world for its spare children, as we shall have
enough of our own ; the time may come when
some invention more marvelous than that of
Fulton or Stephenson will supersede and
eclipse steam locomotion; bat the time will
never come when Americans will cease to
prize the advantages of human learning.
Schools and colleges give to the soul its mas-
tery over the imbecilities of the body, furnish
young Samsons with implements to slay "the
Philistines of ignorance and barbarism," and
so far as such schools and colleges have been
established by the aid of even a comparatively
small portion of the public domain, they will
stand as monuments more enduring than the
pyramids attesting the wisdom of American
legislation.
On this line of public policy, however, we
only travel in the footsteps of our fathers. The
importance to a free government of a system
of general education was realized even before
the adoption of our present Constitution, and
thus in the Ordinance of 1785 a provision foi
a subsidy was inserted by which the central sec-
tion of land in every township was granted for
the support of common schools. Subsequently
the amount of such grants was doubled ; and,
including what has been given to colleges and
universities, would now have a superficial area
larger than the whole of England, Scotland,
and Ireland.
The whole amount of public lands sold
from the foundation of the Government to
June 30, 1871, was 161,766,426 acres, but the
amount granted for railroad subsidies, certified
and yet to be certified, was 216,074,990 acres,
which exceeds all the lands actually sold by over
60,000,000 of acres, and here the country now
very properly demands a halt.
We have donated swamp lands to the several
States where they were supposed to lie to the
amount of 48,776,990 acres, and have even
made additional grants to make up deficiencies
of measure or of title to lands thus given away 1
Beyond all this we have granted for military
services 62,115,202 acres.
Notwithstanding all these imperial dona-
tions, aud notwithstanding 20,500,216 acres
