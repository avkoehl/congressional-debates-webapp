I will start from the opposite side of the river at daylight in the morning to Platte City via Parkville. Meet me there with all of your available force. Start from Saint Joe so as to be at Platte City by 10 or 11 o'clock.

Captain JAMES H. STEGER,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Warrensburg:

I will have about 400 well mounted men here by sunrise to-morrow ready to march. Shall I move before your troops arrive? Enemy reported about 1,000 strong.

Colonel, Commanding.

KANSAS CITY, July 12, 1864.

Captain HOLLOWAY,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

What force can you send and what will it consist of? Send in cipher if you have it. General Curtis will aid us in any way we may ask him. I will telegraph you when I move. Have you any suggestions to make as to a plan?

J. H. FORD,

Colonel, Commanding.

SAINT JOE, July 12, 1864.

Colonel J. H. FORD,

Kansas City:

We can move with 150 men at least, and can probably increase the force to 200 mounted men. Can move by morning; if necessary, can travel, via Ridgeley, and join you at Smithville, traveling about forty miles. Force from General Curtis could co-operate on direct road from Fort Leavenworth to Platte City. Will follow your instructions. Lieutenant-Colonel Draper, Ninth Missouri State Militia, will be in command. We have a few men in Clinton County which we shall try and use, if orders can be sent them in time.

G. A. HOLLOWAY,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
