Colonel J. H. FORD,

Kansas City:

General Fisk says the rebels are at Plattsburg, probably 1,000 strong. He wants 1,000 stand of arms. I can let you know about your 500 stand in an hour or two.

SAINT JOSEPH, July 21, 1864.

Colonel FORD,

In the Field:

Thornton was at Plattsburg at noon. He may turn toward Blue Mills or Liberty Landing. I am after him with a few hundred militia, but my force is not sufficient in number or morale to cope with the increasing we can exterminate the whole clan.

CLINTON B. FISK,

Brigadier-General.

SAINT JOSEPH, July 21, 1864.

Lieutenant-Colonel DRAPER,

In the Field:

Move toward this point with your command as rapidly as possible. Thornton's forces are concentrating near Plattsburg. Communicate with these headquarters without delay.

CLINTON B. FISK,

Brigadier-General.

SAINT JOSEPH, July 21, 1864.

Colonel O. D. GREENE,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

Thornton's band turned backward from Livingston County, and last evening at 5 o'clock occupied Kingston, in Caldwell County. Another band numbering about 200 were at Plattsburg and Mirabile last night with destruction in their brain. The two parties have united this morning, and are about ten miles southward from Cameron. There are probably about 1,500 well armed and mounted rebels who can concentrate in a day or two. I am making every possible exertion to concentrate a force against the increasing horde of murderous vandals. The defection in the militia is much worse than we could have anticipated.
