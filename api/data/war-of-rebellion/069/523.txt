I have no force that I could mae use of at Plymouth, and to reoccupy that place in the present state of my command would be only to hold a bait to be grasped at any time. I would lie to do something more

than "hold on here," but you are aware, I suspect, that every man that could be possibly spared was sent to General Butler. I inclose a letter to a Miss Jones, at Edenton. This lade wishes very much to get to the Catholic Institution at Mount De Sales, and I have promised her friends at the North to do everything I could for her.

I have thought very strongly of occupying Edenton just as soon as I can feel that I have the forced to do it. Do you not think that better than to reoccupy Plymouth? I am anxious to hear whether Captain Lee has been able to accomplish anything with his torpedoes.

I am, captain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

I. N. PALMER,

Brigadier-General.
