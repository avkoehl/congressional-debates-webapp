Lieutenant Colonel C. T. CHRISTENSEN,Asst. Adjt. General, Hdqrs. Army and Mil. Div. of West Mississippi:

COLONEL: I have the honor to submit in connection with my report Numbers 269, dated March 28, that I proceeded myself at daybreak, the 29th, with five days' supplies for Major-General Steele's command, on the steamer Matamoras, to the month of the Escambia River, and succeeded in getting to bow of the vessel across the bar at the eastern channel but could not force the stern across. I returned therefore by land and sent the tug at daybreak yesterday with a flat-boat to lighten the Matamoras, but receiving an hour after positive information, by Mr. A. Holly, that General Steele's entire column left Conoe Station on the morning of the 28th for Blakely, I ordered the steamer back and she safely arrived at t he Barrancas wharf last evening.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

ASBOTH,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
