SULLIVAN'S ISLAND,

August 23, 1863.

SIR: I have the honor to report all quiet at this battery* up to the hour of 3 a. m., when the Ironsides and monitors were discovered between this battery and Cumming's Point, firing on Sumter.

As soon as it became light enough, this battery opened its fire on them, firing 36 shots, and striking them repeatedly. After firing for awhile, a heavy fog hid them from view for an hour. When the fog cleared away, they were discovered retiring to their old position off Battery Wagner.

Yours, very respectfully,

C. H. RIVERS,

Captain, Commanding Battery K.

Captain W. F. NANCE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

CAPTAIN: I have the honor to report that yesterday morning, at about 12 o'clock, two monitors appeared in long range of our guns, and that we opened upon them, when they retired in about one hour after.

At about 2 o'clock, four monitors moved up in line of battle, and the action was very general until 5 o'clock, when they retired out of range. They were seen to have been hit repeatedly from my battery. I estimated that about 50 shots were fired from the enemy over this island; 128 shots ere fired from my battery in the morning and evening engagements.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

C. H. RIVERS,
