Department

of Tennessee
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE MISSOURI,Saint Louis, January 23, 1863.

Major General U. S. GRANT,

Commanding Department of the Tennessee, Memphis, Tenn.:

GENERAL: The prisoners are arriving here, and what to do with them is a difficult question. I have them on Arsenal Island, without shelter. I am obliged to put them where a small guard will do, for I have sent everything down to help you in the down-river matters.

I telegraphed General Gorman through you at Memphis on the 11th instant to-

Continue to regard the Vicksburg movement of primary importance. Let all other move delay if deemed necessary. Send boats and ;men for that object, but do not weaken Helena so as to endanger the position.

Now, I receive orders extending your command over-

All troops in Arkansas which may be within reach of his orders; that portion of Arkansas occupied by such troops will be temporality attached to the Department of the Tennessee.

You will please inform me at your earliest convenience what troops and what territory you will assume, as I must arrange my supervision of affairs to your orders. I suppose you will include Helena in the enlargement of your command.

If Holmes and Hindman mass all their forces this side of the Arkansas River they may give me trouble, but I hope you will close out
