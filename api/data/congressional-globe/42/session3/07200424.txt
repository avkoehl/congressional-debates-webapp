Mr. SCOTT. Mr. President, I present the
memorial of the Pennsylvania State Temper-
ance Association, signed by James Black, its
president, who, by the way, I may state was a
candidate for President of the United States
at the last election, and by its corresponding
secretary, asking for a commission of inquiry
concerning the results of the traffic in intoxi-
cating liquors, and also concerning the results
of restrictive and prohibitory legislation for
the suppression of intemperance; also what
'urther legislation is proper on the part of
Congress to prevent, within the sphere of the
Dational authority, the use of intoxicating
liquors as a beverage. I am almost at a loss
to know to what committee to propose its ref-
erence, but I think probably the best commit-
tee to refer it to would be the Committee on
the Revision of the Laws, as the memorialists
ask what further revision of the laws of the
United States is necessary on that question.
The VICE PRESIDENT. Does the Sen-
ator make that motion ?
Mr. SCOTT. Yes, sir; I move that the
memorial be referred to the Committee on the
Revision of the Laws.
The motion was agreed to.

was ordered to lie on the table.

of tlie Supreme Council of the Templars of
Honor and Temperance of the United States,
signed by A. W. Tibbetts, most worthy tem-
plar, Reuben C. Bull, most worthy recorder,
asking for a commission of inquiry concern-
ing the results of the traflic in intoxicating
liquor, and of restrictive and prohibitory legis-
lation for the suppression of intemperance.
This memorial is similar in its character to the

the Laws.
The motion was agreed to.

of intemperance; which was referred to the
Committee on the Revision of the Laws.
Mr. CONKLING presented the petition of
Julia A. Rust, granddaughter and heir and for
the coheirs of Joseph Davis, deceased, pray-
ing to be indemnified for spoliations committed

Mr. CONKLING. I present also the me-
morial of the National Temperance Society,
of which William E. Dodge, of New York, is

concerning the results of the traffic in intox-
icating liquors, and of restriction and pro-
hibitory legislation for the suppression of
intemperance, and by way of cultivating the
amenities initiated by my friend from Penn-
sylvania, I have no objection to this memorial
going to the committee which is so very far
fetched as it seems to me is the one to which
this reference has been made.
The memorial was referred to the Commit-
tee on the Revision of the Laws.

ments to the postal laws of the United States;
