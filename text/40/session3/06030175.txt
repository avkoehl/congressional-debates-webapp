APPENDIX TO THE CONGKESSIONAL GLOBE.
1-75
40th Cong....3d Sess;
National Currency—Mr. Buckland.
Ho. of Reps.
the gentleman all of his time, I ask that I may
have the same amount of time to reply to him.
Mr. BENJAMIN. I object.
Mr. SCOFTELD. I rise to a question of
order. The gentleman from Ohio was not
speaking in the time of the gentleman from
Massachusetts. The floor was assigned to him
independently. I ask if he has had his hour?
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentle-
man from Ohio was speaking in his own time;
but he had ten minutes last night, which he
gave to the Speaker, and has had fifty minutes
this morning.
Mr. SHELLABARGER. All I wish is to
conclude my remarks by saying that in the elec-
tion of Mr. Monroe, in 1821, the same concur-
rent resolution passed by us on the 8th of
February was introduced by Mr. Clay, from
a joint committee of the two Houses, into the
House of Representatives, and was adopted
for the guidance of the two Houses. These
were its words:
"Resolved, That if any objection be made to the
State of Missouri and the counting or omitting to
count, which shall not essentially change the result
of the election, in that case they shall be reported by
the Presidentof the Senatein the following manner:
Were the votes of Missouri to be counted the result
would be for A B for President of the United States,
 votes; if not counted for A B as President of the
United States. — votes; but m either event A B is
elected President of the United States; and in the
same manner for Vice President."
This was adopted—yeas 90, nays 67. After
its adoption the two Houses came together, the
President of the Senate passed to the tellers
the opened votes of the States. When Mis-
souri's was reached Mr. Livermore, of New
Hampshire, objected to its count. A motion by
a Senator was made, which prevailed, that the
Senate retire to its Chamber, which it did. The
House was called to order, and Mr. Floyd
moved that Missouri's vote be counted. A long
debate arose on that in the House, in which
Mi-. Clay used these words: "The two Houses
ought not to have separated until they had con-
summated what had been stipulated for." Mr.
Floyd's resolution was laid on the table, on
Mr. Clay's motion, by a vote of 103 yeas. A
message was sent to the Senate that the House
is now ready to receive the Senate for the pur-
pose of continuing the enumeration of the
votes. The Senate appeared. The President
of the Senate, in the presence of both Houses,
opened and handed the tellers the vote of Mis-
souri, which was read and registered, and then
the tellers made and handed to the President
the compared lists of the votes of all the States,
and the President, " in pursuance of the reso-
lution" of Mr. Clay, "adopted by the two
Houses," proceeded to announce the vote
and had got so far as to declare that Mon-
roe, of Virginia, had a majority of the votes
for President, and Tompkins, of New York, for
Vice President, but had not declared who was
elected when Floyd addressed the Chair de-
manding to know if Missouri had been counted ;
and thereupon great disorder arose. Randolph
also addressed the Chair. The President de-
cided everything out of order; the only busi-
ness being at that present time that prescribed
by the rule of the morning. There was mur-
mur at this decision, but the President pro-
ceeded to announce who was elected: and then,
on motion of a Senator, the Senate retired while
Mr. Randolph was addressing the joint con-
vention.
I refer to it for the purpose of saymg that
we have the authority of the distinguished
names connected with the introduction and
passage of that resolution for saying that the
concurrent resolution of the 8th of February
is constitutional, and the action of the Presi-
dent yesterday is sanctioned by precedent.
Mr. WOODWARD. The gentleman says
that everything that occurred yesterday occur-
red in 1821. Did such a vote of the House as
occurred yesterday occur then ?
Mr. SHELLABARGER. Not such a vote
as that of yesterday, but just such a setting
down of the vote of Missouri in a hypothetical
way—in the way in which Georgia was to be
set down, and in which it was set down yester-
day—did occur in the election of Mr. Monroe,
and every other step in the ease.
Mr. WOODWARD. But the House did not
in that instance refuse to count the vote, as
they did in this instance.
Mr. SHELLABARGER. There was then
no such concurrent resolution as is now con-
tained in the twenty-second rule. The whole
thing was conducted under such a concurrent
resolution as we passed on the 6th of this
month.
National Currency.
SPEECH OF HON.R. P. BUCKLAND,
OP OHIO,
In the House op Representatives,
February 13, 1869.
The House having under consideration the bill (S,
No. 440) supplementary to an act entitled "An act
to provide a national currency secured by a pledge
of United States bonds, and to provide for the circu-
lation and redemption thereof," approved June 3,
1861—
Mr. BUCKLAND said:
Mr. Speaker : I rise principally for the pur-
pose of opposing the amendment of the major-
ity of the Committee on Banking and Currency
to the fourth section of the pending bill. I am
not entirely satisfied with' that section as it
came from the Senate, but I think it is better
and more just than the amendment proposed
by the committee.
It is not necessary to consider at this time
what were the circumstances leading to the
establishment of the national banks. What-
ever may have been the inducements to grant
these exclusive privileges, the system has
been established by law for nearly six years,
and these national banks have enjoyed dur-
ing that time the exclusive privilege of is-
suing paper money and making profit thereby.
The Government of the United States are un-
der no obligations to them at all, for they have
been more than compensated in profits for all
the aid rendered by them to the Government.
Nor have they any claim on the ground of a
subsisting contract, because the laws under
which they are organized provided that they
may at any time be altered, amended or re-
pealed. It is a question only of public policy
and of justice to the people of all the States
as to how the Government shall distribute
these exclusive and profitable privileges.
The chairman of the Committee on Banking
and Currency [Mr. Pomeroy] stated in his
remarks that the capitalists of New York and
of the eastern States came forward in times of
great trouble and uncertainty and loaned to
the Government their capital to carry on the
war and to sustain its credit. He also told us
that these banks were organized for this pur-
pose. Now, Mr. Speaker, is not the simple
truth just this, that these capitalists, when the
Government was in distress for money, came
to it and said that if it would pass a law by
which they could make a profit of from ten to
fifty per cent, on the use of their money they
would organize under that law and take the
bonds of the United States'? But admit all that
is claimed by the chairman of the committee,
and all others representing this great interest,
what has been the result? Why, sir. the result
has been that from the organization of these
banks down to the present day they have made
from ten to fifty per cent, per annum profit on
their investments; and I am told some of
them more than fifty per cent, per annum. I
say, therefore, that this question is not to be
settled upon any consideration that it is a
hardship to the States having more than their
just proportion of this banking circulation to
require them to surrender a small part ot the
. excess. It is not a hardship at all. We are
i met at the threshold with this objection, but
I contend that we are bound to do equal jus-
tice to the people of all the States. No set of
men who have enjoyed these privileges under
the law for four or five years have the right to
come here now and say that they must be con-
tinued in the enjoyment of more than their
proportion of the profits of issuing paper money
because they have been permitted to do so
heretofore.
The first law authorizing national banks,
passed in 1803, required $150,000,000 of the
circulation to be "apportioned to associations
in the States, in the District of Columbia,
and the Territories according to representative
population, and the remainder by the Secretary
of the Treasury among associations formed in
the several States, in the District of Columbia,
and in the Territories, having due regard to
existing banking capital, resource, and business
of such Stale, District, and Territory." But
on the 3d of June, 1864, the national banking
law was enacted, leaving this provision out.
On the 3d of March, 1865, the provision was
restored and remains in force; but before it was
restored the States of Massachusetts, Rhode
Island, Connecticut, and New York had ab-
sorbed more than one half of the entire circu-
lation authorized for all the States, thereby
preventing other States from obtaining their
due proportion in accordance with that provis-
ion. They still retain it, and I presume will
not willingly relinquish the profits they are
making thereby, however unjust this inequality
may be to the people of the other States. I
have prepared a table from the last report of
the Comptroller of the Currency, showing the
number of national banks in each of the States:
the District of Columbia, and the Territories
and the circulation in each in October last
Also, the number of Representatives in Con
gress from each State, to indicate the repre
sentative population which, in my opinion, is
the only just basis for the apportionment of
the national banking circulation among the
States;
