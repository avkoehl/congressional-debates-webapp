to Tuscumbia; Davis to be ready to follow him with the remainder so soon, as the news from Granger shall show what dispositions are advisable at the front. I have doubts if any operations in force will require support given to Morgan east, from the nature of the country south of Morgan's line, which is generally hilly and poor. It is probable that column was a reconnoitering covering and designed to cut off the Union men from those hilly regions who were flocking to join us.

General MORGAN, Tuscumbia:

Mitchell's brigade of Davis' division has been ordered to relieve your troops from Iuka to Bear Creek Bridge, inclusive. On being relieved your troops will join you at Tuscumbia.

By order:

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE MISSISSIPPI,August 3, 1862,

Brigadier-General DAVIS, Jacinto:

The following from Major Smith, at Iuka,* indicates that it would be well for our troops to start there by crack of day, leaving the train to follow with a suitable guard. Let two days' rations be cooked: ammunition in cartridge-boxes; wagons with enough to make 100 rounds. Instruct the general to inspect everything; move with speed and circumspection, keeping his advance guard well out and good flankers on his left; not to let the head of his column enter a defile until the advance guard has gone clean through and formed on the opposite side to cover his passage against a surprise.

Brigadier-General, U. S. Army, Commanding.

Letters dated at Tupelo, July 24, and captured by Colonel Lawler, represent the enemy leaving Tupelo and moving toward Chattanooga via Jackonsville, Ala.

Major General JOHN A. McCLERNAND, Jackson:

From information obtained from our scouts we are lead to believe there are no troops at present at either La Grange or Grand Junction.
