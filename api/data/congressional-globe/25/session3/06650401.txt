Public Defaulters—Mr. Wise.
Ho. oj? Reps.
Thus, sir, Ogden, Phillips, Tleming, all knew '
And the latter tells us that he told Hoyt that
his accounts would be delayed " in consequence
of giest 4isciepancies in Mr Swartwout's ac
counts " When' Certainly before the 31st of
Octobcr 1838, when he submitted to him the pre-
pared statement Sir, who are Ogden, Phillips,
and Fleming' The cashier, assistant cashiei,
and auditor of Hoyt, as well as Swartwout'
Tíiey were not dismissed until witluo the last
few weeks Do you not suppose, sir, that these
minions communicated all to Hoyt—were offi-
cious and superserviceable to do so, in order to
letam their places? And if they knew all, and
Hoyt knew all, don't you suppose that Wood-
buiyknew all? Why was Hoyt's memoran 
idum, I again ask, without date ' Should Hoyt be
retained in office while he keeps such subalterns
jn his office ' Would Woodbury retain hira if he
were not a bird of the same feather > These men,
it Seems, are well indoctrinated™ the whole black
art and mystery of the trade of defalcatian Ay,
sn, one of them even reports his plan of keeping
the public money1    Heal him, sir.
New York, Noiemher 12,1838
Sir Agreeably fo request mide by yourself as to the
manner oí conducting Ule business at the custom house m
comparison with the former mode, Í hive to state tint Mr
Ilovt, in coming into office, adopted a course winch in my
opinion, is c ery way calculated to insure a safe collection
of the revenue, anda prompt discharge of dutybyeueri/one
connected with the customs, and more paiticuhily as he
is, is fir as practicable, endeavoting lo mike himselfac
■qu anted with the ousincss of his sul ordinales generally
As all the receipts foi cu torneare now collected through
the custom house direct, I will give i statement of what he
lias required of me, being the peisonby whom all moneys are
received and disbursed
He goes on to state the mode, and concludes
thus
I do not find myself capable of suggesting any alteration
in the mode of minagmgthe public lumlsdiflerent from that
«low pursued It ibMinple in its opeiations, and on least
calculated to create i multiplicity of agents, by which the
public-money might be en I ingered
In ill payments made by me they are on the authority of
the auditor, through whom all bill  must pass
Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
J PHILLIPS
II  D Gilpin, Esq
Yes, sir, he thinks his mode is " eveiywai/" veiy
commendable—makes "every one''prompt—Hoy t
"himself acquainted,"very complimentary to Mr
Hoyt' But, above all, sn, he can suggest no im-
provement—¡ust as he wants it—" tí is simple'"—
not complicated by too many checks' least cal-
culated to multiply agents'—he and Hoyt have
it now all to themselves' And this rogue, who kept
written memoianda for yeais of Swartwout's
embezzlement and fraud, is verily the officer
under Hoyt " by to'tom all moneys a) e leceived and
dnbursed'" This is a " part of Mr Secietary
Woodbury's syiUm'" He is the very man, true,
to tell how to detect and expose Swartwout—is
he not, also, the very tool to assist Hoyt to smug
gle after his predecessor's example? This excel
lent agent—this Democratic Locofoco—is in the
very clover he desires, he is suited to a penny—
would not have the tiling changed at all'
Is theie not moral turpitude in some others as
■well as in Swartwout, in this transaction ? I be
lieve that the Secretary down to Phillips are as
criminal as the defaultei They will never allow
Swartwout and Puce to return, or this would
fully appeal, as I believe, befoie my country
Srr, let us now inquire further,-wlrethet this de-
falcation might not have been pietentedaltogeth
er, if the Secretary had done his duty    After the
defalcation was known, the Secietary then woke
up, he wrote the following letters
Treasury Department, Aovember 9,1838
Sir Tn consequence of the report made in part by the
Solicitor of the 1 reisury, on the examination by him and
your-elf in to the accounts of the late collector at New Yoi k,
I wish now to call your immediate attention to a few con
siderations-                                                         „        ,

possible
Please to adopt Iny additional step ■flinch has occurred to
you for discovering any errors, and for securing the public
against lossps
Respectfully, your obedient servint,
LLVI WOODBURY,
Secretary of the Treasury
J  N Barker, Esq , Comptroller of the Treasury
Treasury Department, November 19,1838
Sir The recent development of the great defalcation of
the 1 ite collector at New York, renders it essential that it
should be ascertained, if practicable, why it was so long
undiscovered, I thereiote request you to inform me of the
cau«es why it was not m the power of your ofhee lo report
his defalcation when it first commenced, or at the different
settlements iftei wards, before his term of office expired
If, under the present system of adjusting the accounts of
collectors, it be impracticable to iscirtain defaults like these
immediately after they occur, I will thank you to report to
me such modifications and improvements as may suggest
themselves to you, in order tliat all defalcations hereafter
may be immediately known if possible , and, m case you
should consider that further legislation miy be necessary to
atta n this object, I wish you to point out the defects tint
should be provide d for and also such idditional checks as
might be imposed to prevent the embezzlement of the pub
he funds received by the collectors and receivers of the
publ c revenue
This report I should be glad to receive soon, that a com
mumcation on the subject may be made to Congress at the
commencement of the ensuing session
I am, very respectfully, vour obedient servint
LEVI WOODBURY,
Secretary of the Treasury
J N Barker, Esq , ComjiiroJier of the Treasury
This letter of the 9th shows exactly the duties
which the Secretary had before neglected-
1    The naval officers under him had not been
made to do their duty
2   The examination of balances had not been
attended to
3    Sufficient attention had not been bestowed
by him on settlements heie of the bond accounts
of collectors
In addition to these letter , he sent a circular
to the Comptrolleis and Auditors of the Treas
ury He is terrible for circuláis' They aie his
Colonel Pluck spurs, by which he makes the
nation believe that he is constantly toweling the
sides of his official steeds, and keeping them full
up to then mettle Ah* no man knows better
how to "ion with the hire and hold with the
hounds " This cncular itself shows, too, what
had been neglected But to pioceed Gilpin and
Barker, in then report fiom New York, Novem
ber 15, say:
" These defects reidilv suggest the following remedies
" 1 that the svstem for the collection of the revenue
from customs should resemble tint adopted in regard to the
revenue from lands, that the olhcei who^ascertams the
amount due to the Government, admits vessels tq entiy
and permim* the vinous functions connected with those
pirts of i collector s duty, should be distinct from, and in
dependent of, the officer who receives and is «¡countable
for the moneys acciuing on tho e dunes Each miking
his separate reports and held to a separate responsibility
would prove a complete check upon the other, and lead to
an immediate detection of error, neglect, or defalcation
' 2 riMtdllsuinsofmoneysliouldbepaidintotlie'lreas
ury, that no officer should In permitted to retain funds
under any pretext, or mike piyments except on estimates
previously mide to the Treasury, or on accounts properly
submitted and examined I here would be no difficulty in
so arranging this plan as to give quite as much f icihty as
exists at present in the payment of debentures, ind all other
charges now deducted from the accruing revenue, while it
would obviate the disadvantages that are inseparable from
the present mode
" 3 That actual inspections by competent offic rs from
the frfisurv Department shoul 1 be made from tune to
tihie, it every principal custom house Had such inspec-
tions been made at New York this defalcation could haic
been easily detected before it liad long existed,or readied any
veiy consllerabtc amount
" 4 Tint the u«e ot the public money by any officer in
trusted with its collection, safe keeping, or disbursement,
should be made a criminal offense, severely 1 unreliable

J   If   BARKER
Hon Levi Woodbury, Secretary of the Treasury.'"
Now, sir, could not all this have been done'
Did it requne a law' None Why was it not
done?   Mi   Secietary does not inform us
Again the First Auditor, m reply to Wood-
buiy's letter, repoited as follows
fREiSDIYDElARTMEVT,
First 4ijditor s Office December 1,1838
Sir Your letter of the 19th ultimo should have received
an earlier reply had the state ot iny health permitted, and
even now, confined as I am to my chamber, I must crave
indulgence for omissions that may occur, and the privilege
of supplying any such in a future comniunicauon
The first inquiry contained in jour letter, in leference to
" th" great defalcation of the late collector at F\ ew York "
is in the following words, viz "I therefoie reque t you to
inform ine of the causes why it was not in the power of
your office to repoit his defalcano  when it first occurred,
or at the different settlements afterwards, before his term
or office expired "
In reply to this" question, I would respectfully state that
it was not in the power of this office to report his defalcation
when it first occurred, beciusc it never possessed the means
of ascertaining it By the twenty fiist section of the collec-
tion act of 2d March, 1799, the collectors ire allowed three
months after tlu expirauon of i quaiter to make up and
render the accounts to this office for adjustment ond in
reference to NevvYoik the Secietaiysomejears since ex
tended the time two or three weeks longei, so that the ac-
count* of that distuct, for the first quarter of the year, do
not usually reich this office until the middle of July; it is
therefore apparent that this defalcation could not have been
ascertained in this office when it first occuired
But it is also asked why it was not repotted " at the dif
ferent settlements aftei wards, before his term of office ex-
pired " To this inquiry the sime reply might also fee made.
This office had no means of ascertaining the defalcation of
Mr Swartv  out at any time prior to the final settlement W
Ins account It could and did report the correct balances
due fiom him,e at the differentsettiements " but it Had no
means of isceri unmg that i poition of his balance had
been Used by him lor his pnvatc purposes The accounts,
as soon as leceived at this office, are carefully examined;
and ill the checks fui mailed lor testing their accuracy, m
addition to the certiffriti1 of the naval offiepr, are used,and"
the dunes secured, as weltas the disbursements made, hav-
ing been correctly isceuainefts the account is stated, anS
the balance struck and reported to the First Comptroller, to
whom the account and all the abstiacts belonging to it are
transmuted forthwith Fiom the investigation, however,
which has lecently taken place at the custom house, Bfevv-
York, it appears thata large portion of this defalcation con-
sists of bonds abstiacted by the late colieetoi, to whom pay-
ment was made, and for which the bond account was not
credited, and it may with propriety be inquired, why this
hid not been discovered by the accounting officers on the
examination of the accounts
In replying to this inquiry, I beg leave first to state the
facts in regaid to the manner in which the boiid leentittts
have been kept at the Treasury Pievious to the year 1822,
as 1 am infoimcd, on examining the accounts of the cus-
toms in tins office, the atcouriting clerk ascertained thai
the balance of the bond account was correctly brought for-
waid, tint the additions were correct and the balance, as
returned propelly stated But, as the bond account accom
p lined the quarterly account current of the customs ana
the other abstracts totheComptioller suffice, where it was
retained, no reference could be had in this office to slid
accounts, to mark off the bonds paid, or put m suit, in *afe
sequent quarters which leferonce was absolutely neces
sary to a thorough examination of the bond account la
182', however, the rust Auditor dneUed a register to tie
kept m his oflice of all the bonds taken md paid is well as
those put in suit Two clerks were appointed to this-duty,
to whom the accounting clerk, immediately on receiving
the quarteilv returns, hmded over the bond account, to "be
recorded, &c 'Hie accounts for the sm iller districts were
generally entered and marked oft in time to accompany the
adjusted accounts to winch they belonged , but the duty of
recording all the bonds being very arduous and the elerks
engaged on them being occasionally called to other busi-
ness the larger districts by and bv tell m arrear, especially
the district of New York , which from what I can learn,
was perhaps never once recorded anil marked off in Mure
to accompany the accounts of the Comptroller, and, as it
now stands, I find that the bonds taken are recorded only
to the second quarter 1834, while those piid or put >n suit
are mirki d oil only to the fourth quarter 1832 1 he pres-
ent condition of the bond accounts in this office is about
the same that it was wh n I received my appointment
But for the present pissing over the imperfect manner of
keeping the bond accounts, let us inquire whether, under
the most perfect system that could be devised for discharg-
ing this duty, the fraud committed on the bonds in New
York could hive been promptly detected in this office' Sup
pose that when the account of the customs is taken up for
adjustment the bonds paid and pot m suit are marked off
forthw iih on the original bond accounts any omission of
the collector of New York to return bonds paid, &e , could
not, in ordinary times be ascertained until live or six
months after Hie expiration ot the quarter m which the
transactions took place , but in the case under considera-
tion, the embezzlement of the proceeds oi the bonds oe
curred undervery peculiar circumstances It was at a pe
nod, in 1837, when, owing to the derangement of coauner-
cial affairs, the suspension of specie payments by the banks,
then no longer used as agents of the Government, &.c ,the
bond  were returned to the custom house, and though
due, were not put in suit, the Secretary of the Treasury
having authorized a temporary suspension, which wasaf
terwards extended by Congress to mne months, and when
six or eight thousand bondswere lying over at the custom-
house at one time, and when all was in such a state of con
fusion that, as has been stated by the auditor of the cus-
tom house, it was utteriv impracticable, even there, to
ascertain, in making uo the amount for the first quarter,
1837, the true condition of the bonds , and where, even at
this late day, after a great deal of investigation, it has been
found impracticable to identify an amount of these ab-
stracted bonds exceeding $30 000, and, in order to ascer
tun them athorougheximmationoftlie bond account will
have to be made fiom the commencement— a work of great
libor and requiring considerable time
With thesefacts before us, itis-quite evident thatitwould
have been impracticable for this office, had the system of
examining the bond accounts been the most perfect, to nave
ascertained the fraud committed by the late collector in tire
bonds until about the time for rendering his final account.
This account was not received at this office until the iutfi
