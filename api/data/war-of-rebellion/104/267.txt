Rock Creek, where the bayou is narrow and the ground on both sides good. Are there any further instructions for me in regard to this road?

F. STEELE,

Major-General.
HDQRS. ARMY AND DIVISION OF WEST MISSISSIPPI,April 7, 1865.

Major General F. STEELE:

General Canby is not at headquarters at present. If there is good high ground on both sides of the crossing just below Rock Creek the road may be located by that point, as the northern bank of Minette Bayou below the confluence with Rock Creek is swampy and boggy for some distance.

Lieutenant Colonel C. T. CHRISTENSEN,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

Owing to the non-arrival of the platforms the parrott guns did not get in position last night. They will be put in to-night.

Major-General STEELE:

The commanding general directs me to say that we have been using corduroy platforms for Parrott guns, and find them to answer the purpose very well. The non-arrival of platforms should not delay placing the guns in position.
