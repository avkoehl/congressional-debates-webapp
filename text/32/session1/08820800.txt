THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
March 20.
interposition of this Government, through its army
officers. They will further see that interposi-
tion was for reasons amply suBicient, and such da
would have controlled the action of any gentle-
man here, had he been substituted fjr those army
officers. They acted wisely and prudently; and
they are entitled to the highest encomiums for
their course by this Congress and the country, for
relieving the country of this incubus which
weighed itdown—by relieving the country of what
was otherwise not only an expensive, but a mer-
ciless war. I have no sickly sensibility upon this
subject, especially such as was indicated the other
day bv the gentleman from Pennsylvania, [Mr.
John \V. Iiowc.'] And the history of this country
is too full of those bloody pictures, showing the
character of savage warfare; too many men,
women, and children, have been butchered in cold
blood, to make me entertain any particular fancy
for Indians. That, too, is an evil with which we
have had to contend, and let us dh-pose of it like
statesmen.
Mr. BARTLETT obtained the iloor, but yield-
ed to—
Mr. HAMILTON, v,*ho moved that the com-
mittee do now nse; winch motion was agreed to.
The committee accordingly rose, and the Speak-
er having resumed the chair, the chairman [Mr.
Chandler] reported that the Committee of the
Whole House had. according to order, had under
consideration the Private Calendar generally, and
particularly House bill 13G, for the relief of the Je-
cal heirs o'f James C. Watson, late of the State of
Georgia, and had come to no conclusion thereon.
Mr. ALLISON moved that when the House
adjourns it adjourn to meet on Monday next. *
Mr. MEACHAM demanded the yeas and
nays; which were ordered—33 rising in the affirm-
ative.
Mr. M. then withdrew the motion.
Mr. ORR. moved the usual resolution lo close
debate on the bill last under consideration ia the
Committee of the Whole House.
Mr. CHANDLER moved that the House do
now adjourn.
Mr. EWINCt moved that when the House ad-
journs it adjourn to meet o;i Monday next.
Mr. STANLY demanded the yeas and nays
upon the motion, which were ordered; and, being
taken, the result was—yeas xM, nays 95.
So the House refused to adjourn over.
The SPEAIvER. The question recurs upon
the motion to adjourn.
Mr. POLK. Is it in order to move to recon-
sider the vote by which the House refused to ad-
journ until Monday5
A Voice. How did you vote?
Mr. POLK.. I voted no. I ask if my motion
does not take precedence of the motion to ad-
journ :
The SPEAKER. The Clnur  s mclmed to be-
lieve that it is competent for tins House to fix the
day to whit h it will adjourn, and that such a mo-
tion nas pre^pnen'M over a motion to cd^/uni.
Mr. POLIv. The reason why I make the mo-
tion 
A Votcv:. ft is not dehatabk1.
Mr. POLK. If £ cannot st^te my reasons I
feel, like other gentlemen, that tin * motion co ad-
journ will be re id agaicst me.
TheSPEA KElt. Debate is not in order" Does
the gentleman insist upon his motion5
Mr. POLHL Not un'es* i con give my renins.

ROUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
Satcrd.yy, March 20, 3852.
The House met at twelve o'clock, m. i'rayei
by the Rev. Littleton' F. Morgak.
The Journal of yesterday was read and approved.
PROSPER M. WETMORE.
Mr. ORR. 1 ask the unanimous consent of
the House to take up from the table a message of
the President, in response to a resolution which I
had the honor to offer some two months ago, in
reference to the accounts of Prosper M. Wetmore.
I desire to take it up in order to move, without de-
bate, that it be referred to the Committee on the
Judiciary.
The SPEAKER. Is the hill upon the Speak-
er's table?
Mr. OR:i. It is not, but upon the table of the
House.
There being no objection, the communication
was taken up and refei red to the Committee on the
Judiciary.
RESOLUTIONS OF CALIFORNIA.
Mr. MARSHALL, of California, by unani-
mous consent, introduced two several joint resolu-
tions of the Legislature of the State of California:
1st. Joint resolution in reference to the moneys
collected in the ports of California previous to her
admission into the Federal Union.
2d. Joint resolution relative to an increase of
salary of the United States district judges in'Cali-
fornia.
The joint resolutions were severally read and or-
dered to be printed.
DEFIClENCr BILL.
Mr. JOHNSON, of Arkansas. Iask the unani-
mous consent of the House that the resolution
closing debate upon the deficiency bill be so amend-
ed as to read, " within one hour after it shall have
been next taken up for consideration in the Com-
mittee of the Whole on the state of the Union."
Mr. STANLY. I thought that the House, by
general consent, had agreed that the proposition
of thtf gentleman from Arkansas [Mr. Johnson]
should be concurred in, but with the understanding
that thegemleman from New York, [Mr. Brooks,]
upon the Committee of Ways and Means, should
also have an hour. ~VVe are in a minority upon it,
i and it is but fair that we should be heard upon it.
Mr. JOHNSON. I had a conversation with
that gentleman, [Mr. Brooks,] and I told hira
thar I would as^ren: to it upon Ins making- a re-
quest for k upon tiie floor of the House; and as
the gentleman from North Carolina [Mr. Stan'-
j,y] now requests it, I assent to itrand ask the
unnminrms consent of the House, that the reso-
lution Hosing debate be amended, so as to close
debate m two hours instead of one hour, as I first
requested.
Mr. HOUSTON. I shall not object to it, but
I vant to make a suggestion. The gentleman
from Arkansas, [?vfr. Joii>:sont,] sua I understand
it, and as he ims frankly told the House, intends
to discuss some amendment, which lie proposes
to make to the bill when it comes up—an amend-
ment which, he and I a^ree, is important, and
which I would really like to hear discussed. I
have not the rrioit remote objection to the gentle-
man from New York, [Mr. Brooks,] as one of
the members of the Committee of Ways and
Means, making a speech; indeed, I prefer that he
should do it. But then I should like that this
