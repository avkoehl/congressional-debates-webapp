APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
Feb. 1838.
25th Covg -••2nd Sp«s.
Making public offi ers depositaries—Mr. Hubbard.
Senate.
one high consolation It is calculated to awaken,
and I irust will awaken, all oí us to the hue nature
and dangerous character of that formidable mo-
neyed power wh ch we have built up by our own
laws, and winch now sits enthroned upon our sta-
tute booK m the pride of chartered gierogative
Sir, we have heretofore been singularly deaf to the
monitory lemons delivered to us by our father  and
piedccessors In vam did the Republican states-
men of '91 warn us of the fatal consequences of
this 'first transgression' of the «acred limits oi the
Constitution, in vain did Mr jEFFErsoN, in the
prophetic passage which was read to us the othei
day by the Senator from Missoun, (Mr Bínton,)
tell us ot all possible institutions 'this was the one
ol most deadly hostility against the principles and
form of our Constitution,' and tint it permuted to
exist it would one day reduce the constituted au-
thorities ol tie nation themselves under vassalage
to its will "
Is the measure proposed by the Committee on
Finance, a violation ot the Constitution'' Does it
conflict with the provisions of that sacred inurn-
ment? Has it so been pretended by any one? Does
the Senatoi wish to be understood that he should
pause long before he mould go foi this bill, when the
alternative was presented—this utlloi a Bank of
the United States' Sir, I cannot believe that the
Senator wishes se to be underwood
The bill reporte 1 by the committee is free (rom
ever} t onstitutional embanassment It should be
reg irdcel as a mere measure of expediency I can
not suppose that aiy man would give a pieference
to any other meisuie directly conflicting with the
let pnnil spirit ol the Constitution
Th^la'c distinguished colleague of the Senator
expressed similar sentiments as to the constitution-
al power ol Congress to establish a United fatales
Bank, bul he, <it the same tune, expressed the sen-
timent that such an alternative might be presented
as might justify the abandonment of the guards of
the Constitution.
When such sentiments shall be avowed, and a
coriespondmg course oí action shall be manifested,
we may prepare to suirendei the dearest rights ol
fi eemen
Mr Lh<-h remarked, upon the bill to extend, loi
a ti un ol six > eai ^, the United Stales Bank charter
" But thou, h the piopli ol Virgin i do nniiUiin
the o| nion, and have unifuiiiil> maintained it,
and I think, upon just grounds, that this Govern-
ment has no c nst tutional authouly tochartei a
Wain nil Ban1 , the developnienSof the present year
now in rapil pi ogress may serve to convince them
that the r , eual of the present charter of the pre-
sent bi 11 with such modifications, and fir such a
term, is experience has shown oi shall dictate to be
propei mi) be the only means which human wis-
dom (in devise, to avert or correct m< asures far
more unconstitutional, more abhorrent i principle
1 loin th-ir opinion, and more dangeroi s and bale-
ful m their consequences The alternatives but
too likely to be presented to us aie, indeed, awful "
Sir, I should think so, bat so long as I had phy-
sical strength to sustain me, I would cling to the
Constitution oí my country m all the violence of
p vrtv tempests, and when the last hold should iail
me, I would sink w ith the fragments No alterna-
tive could be presented to my mind which, for a
single moment, could induce the surrender of the
charter of mv liberty
The Senators from Virginia and Massachusetts
object to this measure, lor the icason that it pio-
po;e¡, one currency foi the Government, and ano-
ther currency fn the people This, Mr Presi-
dent, is no new discovery It is nota sentiment
i w advanced for the first time by way of objec
tion to this bi'l It has been, on this floor and
elsewhere, emphatically íeiterated hundreds of
time 0\e emiency for the Government—anothet
i unrncy Jot the people I confess that I am wholly
unab'eto comprehend the meaning ot the force of
th  objection Has this Government power to m-
ter'tie w ith the papel cnculat on established by the
States? is ! intended to convey the idea that the
Senate <anl the House of Represéntate es, that the
Executiv , with all its appendages, are elevated
above thu people' that they have no connection
with the people? are in no sense responsible to the
people'   IÍ so, I hold no communion with such
docttmes So far fiom those charged with the le-
gislative andevecutive power of this Government
performing their respective duties independent of
the popular will, they hold themselves directly
amenable to the source of all political powei in th s
country—lo the people themselves. What is our Go-
vernment but a Government of the people? And
every measure which shall have received the sanc-
tiun ol the law making power ttndei this Government,
has bsen originated, debated, examined, and finally
passed and appioved, by the sei vants of the people,
men deriving their authority from populai and
public sentiment
One currency foi Hie Government—anoth„> foi the
poople This language has lost its charm An uu
piejudiced mind would at once suppose, by the use
ol these tei ins, that Congress was about to establish «t
currency lor the exclusive accommodation and be-
nefit oí those chaiged with the admimstiation of
the Government, that, by this bill, a «specie cur-
rency is to be piovidtd exclusively foi the execu-
tive and the legislature branches, and that the
olher members and classes oí our community are,
m twins, distegarded "Let the Government at-
tend to its own affairs, and let the people attend to
theus," the Senatoi fioin Massachusetts has told us
ate "ill boding words " In all this, Mr Piesidcnt,
theie is moic ot poetry than ol lact, more ol lancy
than leilit)
What duci the bill piovide? Does H, m any
sense, intpilcrc with the cunency? Docs it legu-
1 ite the aflairs of the Government to the exclusion
oi the aliairs of the people? No, sir In making
the uectssary provisions lor the collection, sife-
keepm0, and disbursement ol the public reve-
nues—in designating the kind of cuirency which
shall be diawn fiom the people ¡or the support of
the Government of the people, to be again paid
back to the people, the bill does emphatically
and most faithfully attend to the most tmpoitant
a/Tans of the people and of the whole people It
prater is and guards their funds horn actual loss
and fiom putial depreciation This, Ml, is the
chaiac ei of the mtasuie belote us—a measuic
which, it adopted, may last as long as the Govern-
ment shall last—a measure which can, in no way,
ifTcct tho^c in powei differently from those out oí
j)< upi It aflecls every member of the community
w h 11 njov s the blessings of our free and representa-
tive Government Let us heai, then, no more
about one euncney lor the Government, and an-
other cuirency for the people I have, on a lotmei
occ ision, undertaken lo show that the provisions
of this bill, so far as they relate to the collection
anil disbursement of the public money, aie like
the provisions of the act of 1789 I then traced
the similinty between the bill before us and that
art ot 1789 I do not now intend to occupy the
same ¿round I then said all I wished to say on
lb it point, but I might well add, foi the first quar
tei of a cenlury oí ouí existence as a nation, a
sjsteni for the collection and disbursement ol the
public money w a" preserved substantially the same
as this bill seeks, to establish, and during that
period, who ever heard that the law of 1789 cre-
ated one currency for the Government and another
currency for the people"? Who ever heard that
the act ol 1789 attended to the affairs of the Go-
vernment, to (he exclusion of the affairs of the
people''
, The Senator from Virginia further objects to the
bill, that it is a measure hostile to the local banks
I have often he ird this allegation made against the
late and presen' Adrnmnti uion It could not with
the least semblance of truth be made against that
which has recently terminated Every encourage-
ment within the constitutional power oí the late
administration, was extended to the State banks
The revenues of the country were placed m depo-
site with those institutions It must be-within the
recollection of every Senator present, that on the
first of Tanuaiy, 1837, just before the late Adminis-
tration went out of power, the selected State depo-
site b mis held of the public n oney moie than
fouy-two millions of dollars It will not then be
said that any measure of severity was inflicted
upon these local institutions by the late Adminis-
tration    Favor upon iavor was granted to them
Nor can it be said that the present Executive has
expressed a sentiment, or done an act, Unfriendly
to those State banking institutions which deserved
public confidence. In his late Message he re-
marked, that "the discontinuance of the use of
State banks for fiscal purposes, ought not to be re-
garded as a. measure of hostility towards those ia-
stitutions. Banki  properly established and con-
ducted, are highly beneficial to the business of the
country " And I have yet to learn that a dif-
ferent feeling has been manifested, or a different
sentiment expresstd, by any of the efficient fliends
of this Administration Certainly no man will ac-
cuse me with being unfriendly to well regulated
local banks The little property which I possess,
is invested in those State institutions, and while I
am ready to sustain them so long as they shall
keep within just limits—so long as they shall go
iorward to accomplish the purposes of their crea-
tion, I tiust that I shall be behind no man m con-
demning them whenever their means shall be em-
ployed, and their power shall be exerted, to en-
courage speculations, or to countenance frauds
The Government of the United States has no
control over these State institutions They derive
their being fiom State authority, and to the States,
and to the people of the States, they arc solely re-
sponsible ¡or the mannei of executing the trust con-
fided to them. No act of the General Government
< an restrict them in their operations, and no act of
the General Government can constitutionally en-
large their gt anted privileges In all their transac-
tions, acting, as they must do, perfectly independent
of the Government, it was indeed difficult to see
how any public measure of this kind could be re-
gaided as a measuic of hostility against the local
banks
The object of this bill is to secure the public
finances from every possible fluctuation Itmno
way inleiferes with State institutions It may be
as well said, that, because an individual who has
been foi a period of thiee jeais accustomed to keep
his money in deposite at a particulai bank, shall
select a different institution at which to do his
business, that he thereby is carrying on a war
against the bank with which he was first connected,
doing all within his power to blast its credit, and to
embarrass its concerns, as to say that because the
Government saw fit, for satisfactory reasons, to
change the places, of deposite, that it thereby is ma-
nifesting a settled hostility against the institutions
first selected to hold in deposite the public money.
Different, indeed, would be the complexion of this
affair, if the Government could be put m the
wrong, if these local banks could claim, as matter
ol right, 'he privilege of receiving "and disbursing
the public money
It was clealy a matter of favoi up to the pas-
sage of the act of Tune, 1836, and the ground of
rightiul claim to the use of the public money, on
the part of the banks smce that time, I will leave
for others to settle The public funds were placed
on deposite with these local institutions. They
were permitted to retain them no longer than suited
the convenience orfavorel the interest of the de-
positor There was no c ontract that ÜV banks
should keep the deposites any length of time It
was perfectly competent for the depository to put
an end jp the tiast at any moment It could re-
turn the fund whenever it accoided with its con-
venience, or suited its pleasuie, and the depositor
would have no just cause of complaint The na-
ture of the relation between the Government and
the banks, must necessarily hav e left either the one
or the othei at liberty to dissolve the connection at
any moment Such must have been the fair in-
ference resulting from this relation anterior to
June, 1836, when the act was passed to regulate
the deposite of the public money m the selected
depositories That act conferred certain pirvi-
leges, and imposed certain obligations upon the
deposite banks, and if these institutions could show
a fulfilment of all the duties devolving on them
undei tl is act, I certainly would not undertake
to justify the withdiawal <f the deposites, except
for public purposes If such were the state of the
question, the Senator from Virginia might say that
the passage of this bill would evince a hostility to
the State deposite banks.    But entirely different i¡3
