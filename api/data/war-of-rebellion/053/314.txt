SIGNAL STATION,

Cameron's Hill, October 12, 1863-5.30 p.m.

Captain MERRILL:

South 45 degrees east I see fifty new shelter tents and one wall tent, on the slope and near the foot of Missionary Ridge. Some tents visible farther toward Rossville; cannot tell how many, as trees are in the way. South 40 degrees east and three-fourths of a miles nearer, considerable timber has been cut away apparently, and a considerable number of tents can be seen; could not count them. On the west side and half way up Lookout Mountain I saw a thin blue smoke, where we have frequently seen a small fire.

There is a small fire at foot of Lookout on east side, 3 miles distant, and another one on west side about three-fourth of a mile from Craven's house and three-fourths of the way up the mountain.

Brigadier General J. C. DAVIS:

GENERAL: In compliance with instructions of General Rosecrans I am making a minute examination of the official reports of the battle of Chickamauga in order to make a list of those who by special merit deserve special mention. For this purpose, and that the instances of the devotion of the private soldier may not escape me, I have the honor to request of you a copy of regimental reports of the old First Division for 19th and 20th September, which I pray you to send as soon as possible.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

HORACE N. FISHER,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Assistant Inspector-General.
