HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA, June 5, 1863.

Lieutenant General A. P. HILL,Commanding Third Corps:

I desire you to occupy the position of Fredericksburg with the troops under your command, making such disposition as will be best calculated to deceive the enemy, and keep him in ignorance of any change in the disposition of the army.

Should the enemy make an advance upon you, you will endeavor to repel him, and, if not able to do so, or hold him in check, you must fall back along the line of the Fredericksburg Railroad, protecting your communications, and offering such resistance as you can to his advance toward Richmond. If you find it necessary, you can call up Pickett and Pettigrew, now at Hanover Junction. Should you find that the enemy has evacuated his position opposite you, you will, after informing yourself of the fact by your scouts, &amp;c., if practicable and in your opinion advantageous, cross the river and pursue him, inflicting all the damage you can upon his rear.

I request that you will keep me informed of everything material relative to yourself, position, and of the enemy. Colonel [W. C.] Wickham, with his cavalry, is on your left, and Major [C. R.] Collins, commanding Fifteenth Virginia Cavalry, on your right. Captain [Richard E.] Frayser, signal officer, is at Port Royal. These officers have been instructed to report to you.

There is a line of couriers to Culpeper Court-House. My headquarters will be there for the present.
