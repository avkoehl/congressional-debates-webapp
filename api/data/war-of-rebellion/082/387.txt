PLANK ROAD SIGNAL STATION, July 22, 1864-5 p. m.

Captain B. F. FISHER:

I have the honor to report that I visited the station near the Jordan house this a. m., as directed, but owing to the very unfavorable state of the atmosphere made no observations of any importance. Could see the enemy's line from the white house, two miles southwest from station, but nothing distinctly along it or in the city. The railroads and depots in the city could not be seen. Have seen no movement from this station to-day. Could not make out the shape of the smoke-stack of lead-works on account of smoky state of atmosphere. The enemy have been at work all day on their line in rear of Gregory's house.

J. B. DUFF,

Lieutenant and Signal Officer.

PLANK ROAD SIGNAL STATION, July 22, 1864-5 p. m.

J. B. DUFF,

Second Lieutenant and Signal Officer.
