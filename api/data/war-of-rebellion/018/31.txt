Assistant Adjutant-General.

STRASBURG, March 30, 1862.

General WILLIAMS:

Your dispatch received. Will commence movements suggested immediately. Heavy firing was heard yesterday, apparently from the west. We are unable to locate artillery in that direction, and think it might have been on the east, the mountains changing the apparent direction of the sound.

N. P. BANKS,

Major-General, Commanding.

STRASBURG, March 30, 1862.

General WILLIAMS:

Colonel Geary's command was ordered to White Plains, on the line of the Manassas road, to work this way. We need some force on that line to repair the bridges, which are small. If you can communicate with him please give him this direction. How soon may we look for the lumber for the bridges? The bridges for troops, artillery, &amp;c., will be completed in a few days to Front Royal. This work will not interfere with the suggestions of your last night's dispatch.

N. P. BANKS,

Major-General, Commanding.

WAR DEPARTMENT,

March 30, 1862.

Major-General FREMONT, Wheeling:

Your telegram just received. Please indicate the line of operations you propose and what additional force you require. Your memoranda [following] left with me offered no indication of any specific plan of operations. The Adjutant-General has been directed to make out the appointments of your staff according to your own wishes. The operations around Washington since your departure from this city will render it very difficult to furnish any additional troops immediately, but no effort will be spared to supply your wants.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.
