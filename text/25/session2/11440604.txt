sider the general effects of the credueystem upon the prosperity
of the country
I be-iin by admitting that theie is something m this objection,
but byno means as much as is thought by persons who have
not very altent vely considered the subject Undoubtedly, if
vota revenue, instead of being uniform, or at leastvarying very
Utile from yeai to yeai,fce peimnted to fluctuate extremely, if
a great surplus, like that of which you disposed last yeai, m to
be allowed ever aid ant'i to accumulate, and then tobcwjth-
diawn irom one depository, and scattered among many others,
to beagtin suddenly withdiawnfrom them, and ultimately dis
mbuted without lefeieneeto the ftanu. of commerce and the
course of budines5!, but on merely aibitiar> punciples, among
the S^tes, if such financial blunders are to be repeated often m
oui luune policy, we should do well to eotilinti the efjects of
•htm wi hin asnairuw limits as posible, and e\en a system of
h nrditig ought, in such a c^e perhaps do less haim than all
thia vexuious irregu'amv and unceua i.ty But, m the fir-it
place, whooc fault wau thati Vvhost. legislation occasioned that
preposteious accumulation7 Whose unequal and oppressive
tariffs ex totted fiom commerce thevastaums which were after
wtrdsto be lavished upon it with such intoxicating effects?
Yb us, sir, this House thisCotigiessis responsible for whatever
mischiefs giew out of that strange anomaly Let the blame
light upon "the heads of the guilty 1 'ru&t in G >d we aie n it
detuned soon to -?ee anothei such suipiuset1; and, if we should,
T5i st certainly I should e\pect proper precautions to be adopted
u prevent i s t peratwg again so powerfully to deranse the hu-
smees uf the coun .y But what bort jf aigument is it against
the compaiativel} moderate depssites made in the ordinary
com-*© of things by the Government to recompense the ban ¡es
for their services as fiscal agents, and make taxation less op
pieesive, that an enormous accumulation like that íeferred to,
so capriciously disposed of, so violently transfened rrom one
place of deposite to another, produced much tviP And here,
s r, I beg to ask gentlemen w henVr it has evei occurred to them
to imagine what would have been the effect, what would always

shall advert hereafter more partícula ly to the important &ub
je-tof the supply of the precious metals for the purpose of
cjmmeroe, but I here call the attention of the committee to a
view of it that is ermled to their profound considei anon if I
do not gieatly err in all the conclusions to which I have been
biought by mv reseaicb.es m this matter, no calculation can be
mule of the effect which the adoption, I will not lay ofthe'lnrd

b a e of trade
[Mi L here entered into a course of reasoning upon histori-
cal íaetó to show that the importance of these fluctuations in the
paper currency have bren very much overrated, &c , after con*
eluding which, he proceeded as follows }
Sir, to the general, declamation against banking we have to
oppose the experience of the most pio^perous nanons m the
world There is a country, foi instance, who'-e who e curren
cy is of paper, and where one stldom meets with a piece of
gola—whose banking companies, whether with or without
rhiftei subjected t« no re^tiPints or control but s ich as sprin 
out of the vigilant cofa lreeand eacer competition, have, for
upwards of a century together conducted their affairs with to
much skill, integrity, and pi udonce, as not only never to have
o t/iHioned any loss either to the public or the parties interest
el, but, on the contrary, by the confession of all competent
julges, to have conferí ed the "redteat blessings upon both—to
have contributed more tha i -my «mgle caupe perhaps than all
other causes put togethei to bring out, and develop comple ely,
a'l the reaourcei of the land—to foster industiy, to animate en
terprise, and, by an abundant supply ef the meaiu of exchange,
to turn its cipital and laborío the g eatost possible account-
where, in addition to these economical advantages, they have
connivid tuexeicise a high moral contiol, aeortofcensor.il
But, sn, another objection to the nie«Bnt cvstem m that it
authority, over the community, ana fsppc ally the humblei
classes ol k, by bestowing rewards in the &1mt e of credit opon
i Klu5irv and economy and lending upon good ptr'-otal cha
ractct as if it were sol d capital, and, through a system of cash
accountsand irterestupon email deposites have given to the
d serving laboiei the combined idvantdíüesol a Savings Ba dt
an la friendly endo-=( r—acountrv wl sch lias made greater pio-
gie&o wkh n the period r* entinned, than any other in Europe
With an agricu'tuie second (ii eeconc)only to that of riaudns,
with a flourish ng commerce, with manufacturen o: the great,
est extent *nd the i lost exquisite refinement—whose citieshave
almost ktfjt pace with ours, whose whole face, in its gladre^a
and beauty, beais testimony toihe s} nit of impr ven; ent t> at
h-i3 animated her whit country is that? bcotland(sir Eveiy
body hao heard, or ought to have heard, ol the Scotch system
of banfUm*, and I a-sk if any thing can be more u reconcilable
wnh the tleonesso confi lenüy advanced her , than facta coi
nectedwuh its hi story i Iknow sir what may be*ailm re
ply to this othei wise tnumphant example I am aware that
the Scotch banks havf intimes ofpressuie, been compelí© I
to lean upon the Bank of England that objections have been
made by highauthoiittc , to the punciplcs or which they have
been conducted, and tint other persons admutirg their ui
questionable usefulness an I success, have ascribed it to circum-
stances which render the system an unfit model for lrmu'ion
el&ewhere Be it so But sti'l it is banking—banking on the
English plan with a very inadequate supply, scarcely any pup
ply, of bullion—banking without limitation* or somrol, without
any refeience or respousibihfv to Govermnen —banking na
word, with ah the defect* tmj. uted to that system, m then most
«xagcetatcd forms
But if thio example be i ;>t satisfactory, ^e* as o A it the e\
ieneiccofthe wo o "creoumnesiri vthieh thefys'em exists,

xhspuied i^sqltsm the Ioáa run Jsow5 eureiy a ph'losophical
inquirer into the hietory ofthe comanerejí aud pvbho «<wnomy
of nations, if he saw a people preeminently distinguished m
those particulars above all others, would be inclined to ascribe
their superiority to what was peculiar m their institutions, at
least whatever might bp his ideas a pi ion on such subjects, he
would be very slow to deny to any remarkable peculiarity in
those institutions us full importance as one of the probable
causes  of the success which he  witnessed,  un^es he could
e'early show the contraiy    Then, sir, by what example are we
tobe guided m such mattprs, if not by that of England—by
far the most magnificent manifestation that the world in any
age of it has ever beheld of the might and the grandeur of ci
vtlized life!    Sir, I have weighed every syllable that I utter, I
express a dehbeiatt conviction lounded upon a patient mquir)
and a comparison as complete as my limited knowledge has
enabled me to mike it, between the past and present condition
of mankind, and between t'ie great nation of which I am speak
mg and those which surtuuml her     Sn, there v* a gulf be
tween them—that narrow channe1 separate worlds—H is an
ocean more than three thousand miles wide     I appeal to any
one who has been abroad, whether going from England to any
pin of continent be not dt-bcendmg immeobely m the scale of
civilizador?   I know, sn, that ¡he word isan ambisnousone  I
know that *n si meof the graces of polished society, m some of
the arts of an elegant imagination, that m the exact sciences and
in mere learning and gpm ral intellectual cultivation, some ra
ttopahave excelled, peihaps, many equalled England     But in
that civilization which, as I have said before, it isthogieat
end of modern politic ii economy to promote, and which 1*. im
mediately connected wnh the suhiert befoie you—which at
once springs out of and leads to the accumulation of capital,
aud the distribution of wealth and comfort thiough all classes
of a community,  with an  immense aggiegate  of national
p wer and resources—that ciuhzation which enables manto
'wield these elements, and aun   him   with  the force of all
thPir regions,'   which gives  him  dominion   over all other
creatures, arid makes htm emphatically the Lord of the Urn
yer^e—that civilization which consists not m music,  not in
playing on the flute, as the Atb man hero eaid,but in turning a
sm ili city mtoa gteatone—111 that victorious, tnumphant, ir
resistible civilization, there is nothing recoided in the annals of
mankind that does not si k into the shad^sof therfeepeotechpse
by the side of England      I say nothing of her recent achieve

subsidized alltes    Look at the 1 hames crowded with shipping
—vi<-it her arpena's, her docks, her canals, her railways, htr
faetones, her mines, herwaiehouses, her roads, and bridges-
go through the stieets of that wonderful metropolis, the bank,
the tmponum, and the exchange of ihe whole world—conveise
with those meichtnis whoeonduc and control   as far as it is
possible to control, the commerce of all nations, with those
manufacturéis who fill every market wnh their unrivalled pro
ducts—go into that bank whith is the vepo*-i oiy of the pieciois

thi* opulencx aud power, loi itis the condition of our being that

Some aeenbe the
most unquestionable. The reflection has occurred- lit me a
thousand times m traveling over the coiitiaent of Europe^ ^b I
passed through filthy, ili-paved víHagEs, 4áifímgh ta&m m
which there is no appearance of an improvement havmg tteen
made since the Reformation, aa J have looked at the wreiched
hove! of the poor peasant or aniean, or seen hirn atttísí fábors
with his clumsy implements and coarse gear—whata change
would take place in the whole aspect of the country, if it wer«
to fall into the hands of Americans for a single generation1
But is it papef money and the credit system atorre that have
achieved all these wonders? Ido not say so. sir; but can you
say, can any one presume to say, that they have not doné lunch
of all this? I know that the cardinal spring and source of our
success is freedom—freedom with the peculiar character that
belongs to n in our race—ireedom of thought, Jreedoiflof
speecn, freedom of actior, freedom of commerce, freedom not
merely from the oppressions, but from those undue restraints,
and that impertinent interference of Government mtheni'c
rests propei ly belonging to individuals, which stand in tho
way of all improvement in the nations of continental Europe
It is this vital principle, the animating element of social equa
lny, tempei ed and sobered by a profound respect for the auih?
my of la we, and for the rights ol others, and acting upon that
0 her piominent charictei istic of the Anglo-Norman race, tí e
strong instinct of property, with the personal inde|iendenre
and pelsonal comfoii that belong to it, that explains ojir ami
vailed and astonishing progress But of this rational, dtñUislve
hbeity among a people so inteünreníasours, the credit system
is the natural fruit, the inseparable companion, the necessary
means and instrument It is part and paicel of ©qr exus
tence Who ever heard of credit in a despotism op anarchy ?
It implies confidence—confidence m youiself, confidence m
your neighoor, < onfidence in your Government, confidence in
the administration of the laws, confidence m theeagaciiy, the
integmy the discretion oí those wnh whom you have tor?eai,
confidence, in a word, in your destiny and your fortuné, m the
destinies and the fortune oi the country to which you belong,
as, for instance, m the case of a great national uebi It is -the
fruit, I gay, of all that is most precious in civilized h%, aiid to
quarrel with it is to be ungiateful to God for some of the great-
est blessings he has vouchsafed to man Compare Asia with
Europe, hoarding has been the usage of the former from «me
immemorial, because it is slavish, oppressed, and barbarou*,
and it is curious to  ,ee the effect of Enelistt laws 10 breaking up
(as they are doing) that system in Hindostán Depend upon it,
sir, all such ideasare utterly alten to our way of thinking—to
all the habitudes of our people, and all the imerests of "the
coun ry My friends from beyond the mountains are faroifiar
with the great principle, the magical effect of credit in a young
and progressive tountry They know what miracles aie
wrought by a small advance of money to enable ent*-r|rr ^ and
mdustiy tobnng it to cultivation a vugm foi! Thty know
how soon the treasures ot its unworn feriihn  enable them   o
