Now, whilst it is admitted by the War Department that the State of Illinois had 78,079 men to her credit on December 21, 1864, the date of last call, they insist that have had the full benefit of it, and that still there is due from the State 32,887 men after we receipt that credit. Thus, after exhausting all our credits we pay almost 11 men of every 100 called out (300,000) whilst under former calls, before any decution was made for, the credit the highest amount under any quota was 10,41 men to every 100 called for. With these figures I fail to comprehend how we are now (with 78,079 years due us) in worse condition than ever before, when we were without credits or before credits were given. In other words we now are called on to furnish a greater per centrum of men on this call after all credits are allowed, than ever before, when no credits had been allowed.

The average per cent. is 9.87 to every 100 men called; this would give Illinois 29,610 as her full quota. How is it then that this is exceeded by 3,277 when it is confessed we are entitled to the credit of 78,098 years to begin with? Again, Ohio has a net quota assigned her of 26,000 men upon a population of 2,400,000. The same ratio would give to Illinois only 18,416 as her net quota upon a population of 1,700,000 if her credits are equal to those of Ohio. Illinois then has an excess of 78,079 men or years this ratio would give Ohio 110,229 as her excess if her net quota was in population to Illinois" net quota. But this, instead of giving Ohio 26,000 as her quota, would give her 46,437 more than it is. Yet we find that Illinois with her 1,700,000 population is required to furnish 32,887 men and extinguish 78,079 years of credit admitted to be due her, thus making her aggregate quota under this call 110,976 men for one year. At this ratio the grand aggregate quota of Ohio should be 156,666 men, to with, 26,000 net quota and 130,666 of an excess over all previcourse not understood to be exactly accurate for want of accurate date, but the calculations are made to demonstrate that there exists a necessity which justifies and requires the State authorities to ask the information solicited and thereby be enabled to detect error if any exists.

I have been advised by General Fry that the State enrollment can be and should be corrected at any and at all times by the provost marshals, and intimation was clear that if any one refused he would be removed. So that is remediable by the people if they will attend to it. But the State authorities can have no remedy or relief from an injustice or error in computing and assigning quotas, or in making up and allowing credits or excesses unless they can have access to date not now in their possession. it is proper to infer that no injustice is intended Illinois. Yet errors may exist and if the information desired be not furnished the State authorities and they be thereby enabled to affirm the correctness of the quota assigned, her people will believe they have been wronged by the quota fixed upon her detracting to some extent from her fair fame and requiring of her more men than is demanded from other States in proportion to their population, enrollment, men previously furnished, and periods of service rendered. It is proper for me to add that I have heard it stated that the rule adopted by the Provost-Marshal is to add all the excesses of the States to the 300,000 men called for then distributed this aggregate to the State upon their enrollment after which the excess of each State is deducted from its aggregate quota and the balance is its net quota.
