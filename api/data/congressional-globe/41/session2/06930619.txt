National Expenditures, Revenues,
and Currency.
Debt,
SPEECH OF HON. W. LAWRENCE,
of oino,
In the House of Representatives,
July 14, 1870,
On Government expenditures; debt, revenue, and
the currency.
Mr. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, it is the
pride and boast of our Republic that the peo-
ple are the source of all political power. In
the exercise of this power within the next few
months the members of the popular branch of
Congress are to be elected.
The people are divided, as in the years that
are past, into two great parties—the Repub-
lican and the Democratic—one or the other of
which must be successful in the approaching
elections. These parties are to be judged by
what they have done or omitted to do, and by
what they propose for the future.
The great question, indeed, is simply this:
shall the administration of President Grant,
commencing as it did with his inauguration
March 4, 1869, be sustained?
In the sixteen months of its existence it has
kept every pledge upon which it came into
power. It has accomplished more than it
promised ; it has proved that Grant, the mil-
itary saviour of the Republic, lias been no less
successful in peace than he was in war—
"Peace hath her victories
jSTo less rcnown'd than war."
It has completed the work of leconstruc-
tion. Virginia. Mississippi, Texas are restored
States of the Union ; and Georgia, last but not
least, is soon to be one among the sisterhood
of States.
The fifteenth amendment has crowned the
work of constitutional reform by putting in
practical operation the greatest truth ol the
Declaration of independence.
A successful military chieftain, whose ambi-
tion exceeds his patriotism, is dangerous in a
republic, but one with whom patriotism is
everything, ambition nothing, and who adds the
splendid qualities of a statesman to the heroic
virtues of the soldier, can successfully fill the
measure of his country's glory no less in peace
than in war. Such a man is President Grant.
The warrior President is the chieftain of
peace. His civic services prove that his heart
is filled with the poetic prayer :
"Oh, place mo on somo Heaven-protected isle,
Where peaco and equity and lrcedom smile."
At home and abroad peace reigns supreme,
promising to give us territorial acquisitions to
enlarge the boundaries of our uselulness.
Among the Indian tribes, with more causes
to produce Indian hostilities than ever before,
that policy which combines the purposes ot the
missionary and of government has been an
eminent success. Since the days of William
Penn there has been no system of managing
the Indians equal to the "Quaker policy ot
Grant," soon to be enlarged by the aid of
other religious societies having the same object.
Bat, the four great subjects with which the
Administration has dealt and is to deal are the
national expenditures, revenue, debt, and eur-
renov. These are among the great questions
of the approaching elections. I propose to
speak of these briefly, and to show, however
much even Republicans may difier, this Admin-
istration has been an eminent success, ami no
opposing policy gives promise of equal public
benefits.
ECONOMY—REDUCTION OF EXPENSES.
General Grant promised economy in the
national expenditures, and he has redeemed
his promise. This is proved by figures which
ea.nnot lie. Let lis compare the last, year of
Johnson's administration with the first year
of Grant's presidential term :
The national expenditures from March 1, 1S6S, to
March 1, 1869, under Johnson, were &358,131,447 06
Under Grunt, Irom March 1.I860, to
March 1,1870, there wero  203,033,791 12
DecreaseinoneycarofGrant'sterm, S04.497.652 91
The expenditures of the fiscal year ending June 30.
1S6S, were    $377,340,234 83
For the year to Juno 30, iso J  331.55.3.277 so
Ilcduction  $45,785,007 06
This covers only a portion of the first year
of Grant, which includes a debt contracted by
Johnson's administration of 37,200,000 for
Alaska, paid by President Grant; so that the
total reduction ol the fiscal year ending June
30, 1809, over the preceding year should beset
down at $52,985,007.
Among the reductions are these—
In the expenses of Congress  $507.1W 23
In tho Executive Departments  063,581 09
Army, quartermaster's supplies, ordin-
ary and miscellaneous expenses  25,790,283 72

tures—
In pensions    181,037,053
In bounties to soldiers  13,035,.'>,'4
The national expenditures for the year
ending June 30,1871, were  201,740,122 9!
This is a reduction from I8GS ol  S3,700 131 92
And from 1869of  39,85*5,151 83

The expenditures for the Army and Navy
have been reduced, as we will see by the fol-
lowing exhibit:

The "Army reduction bill'' will reduce ihe
expenses of the Army over four million dollars
a.nnuaiiy after 1870.
Here, then, is the evidence that the admin
islration of President Grant has reduced the
public expenditures.
But suppose the Democratic party should
cornc into power ; what then ?
The payment of rebel claims for prnpeity
taken and destroyed in the rebel States by tne
Liuion Artnv during the war, which would foot
up as much as our whole national debt.
On the 2d April, 1869, Mr. Howe, in the
Senate, reported a bill to pay "Ivi/al" citizens
for quartermaster and commissary stores taken
in the rebel Stales daring the war.
On the 27th April, when the. bill was bc'ii'g
considered, Mr. McCiiucry, of Kenlucltv,
moved to strike out the word "loyal." and
declared himself in favor of jiajing rebels;
and 011 the 21st of Mav Mr. Kxoti, 0! Ken-
tucky, declared in the House that, these claims
ought to be paid. lie tain :
" sir. this ^ not all, nor hall. I have hoon
siicfikii"; ot'only so much 0! our debt as vro 1) re

to the poor, whose horses and cuttle end sneep ana
bogs and corn and wheat, and everything <;3e,
taken from them to sustain your armies 111 the iieid.
Their just and honest claims are filed by the thou-
sand in this House and in the Departments at the
other end of tho avenue. Year after year have they
been standing, waiting, imploring simple justice
from a Government that owes them protection."
Here, then, is the danger of extravagance
and a new national debt of immense propor-
tions. And this will be followed by pensions
to rebel soldiers, to cost S30.000.000 annually,
if the Democratic party should come into power.
TAXATION—Tin; REVENUES.
The national expenditures require national
revenues; and if the burdens of national tax-
ation are heavy the Democratic party is re-
sponsible. That party organized the rebellion,
created the national debt and the necessity for
pensions to soldiers. No Republican ever
engaged in rebellion. Let us see what, this
Democratic party has brought upon the people:
A national debt, with its annual inter-
cot of y 20,000.000
Pensions to soldier  30,000,000
8150 000,000
More than half our national expenditures
are the tesult. of Democratic treason. We are
required to raise an annual revenue of about
three hundred million dollars. Most of this is
now raised under two laws : one known as the
internal revenue lav/, one as the tariff law.
During tho administration of Andrew John-
son the revenue service became so corrupt that
it was estimated that not one gallon in five of
whisky manufactured paid the revenue imposed
by law. Xew 1'ork and Philadelphia became
tliegreai whisky-producing, tax-evading cities.
Whisky was openly sold all over the country for
less than half the lawful tax, and the western
distilleries were closed.
The revenue service was enormously expen-
sive.
General Grant, as the Republican candidate
for the Presidency in 1868, stood pledged to a
faithful, honest, and economical collection of
the revenues. His pledge has been redeemed.
His first official act as President, on the 4th
of March, 18(19, was to revoke certain pardons
of Andrew Johnson, signed but not, yet deliv-
ered, to New York offenders against the rev-
enue laws—a notice to the world that tho era
of revenue robbers was ended.
From March 1,18(3, to March 1,1SG9, under J ohn'on,

And this increase resulted, notwithstanding
the rate of taxation was greatly reduced.
!n 18GS the revenue tax 011 whisky was two
dollars per gallon; in 1870 only about sixty-five
cents. Now let us compare the revenue from
whisky and tobacco in 18G8 and 1870. They
were as follows:
