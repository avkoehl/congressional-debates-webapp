CAPE GIRARDEAU, June 15, 1864.

General EWING, Commanding:

The following from Charleston:

Colonel ROGERS:

Citizens of Arkansas report Kitchen at Scattersville with 300 men, and still recruiting. Says he thinks they intended to attack this place. I have commenced building a stockade. Lieutenant Calvert, from the swamps, says Edwards, has killed 8 guerrillas since he got into the swamps. I heard of 80 guerrillas yesterday 12 miles from here, going toward Sikeston; think probably but 40 were there.

EWING.

Edwards is still after them.

ROGERS,

Colonel.
HEADQUARTERS SAINT LOUIS DISTRICT,Saint Louis, Mo., June 15, 1864.

COMMANDING OFFICER, Cape Girardeau:

Where is Scatterville? You will construct a covered way from Fort A to the river. Send the smallest of the negro companies to New Madrid without delay. Keep me advised as to the execution of my orders. Do not hesitate to do, or suggested, whatever you deem advisable for preparation. Orders have been issued to General McCormick to organize, by volunteering, one company from each of his seven regiments in my district, the officers to be recommended by him for appointment by General Rosecrans. This will give the company you want at Bloomfield. It will report to you.

Captain H. HANNAHS,

Asst. Adjt. General, Saint Louis District, Mo.:

CAPTAIN: I have just returned from a scout. Was 40 miles southwest of this place. Scouted the country thoroughly; could hear of no guerrillas. I am informed by a negro that there is a band of guerrillas concentrated near Pickney, in Warren County. I can go and clean them out if the general will permit me to do so. I have had no orders from headquarters in regard to crossing the Missouri River.

I am, captain, respectfully, your obedient servant,

Brigadier-General BROWN, Warrensburg, Mo.:

The major-general commanding directs that you report immediately what troops you now have guarding the railroad bridges in your district. Are they mounted troops, and, if so, would it not be advisable to replace them by infantry?
