JEFFERSON CITY, September 22, 1864.

Major O. D. GREENE,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

A party of sixty rebels passed four miles west of Calhoun at 6 o'clock last evening. Citizen guards in close pursuit. This is probably part of the Laclede County party.

Brigadier-General.

JEFFERSON CITY, September 22, 1864.

Major-General ROSECRANS:

I respectfully report that my information relative to the number of guerrillas that crossed the river below Boonville was incorrect. About 130 guerrillas were driven west by our troops and crossed the La Mine at Dug Ford at 7 o'clock yesterday morning rapidly. I have no doubt that these are the men who are reported as crossing from the north side. I have sent information of the movements to the commanders west.

E. B. BROWN,

Brigadier-General.

WARRENSBURG, September 22, 1864.

Major-General ROSECRANS,

Saint Louis:

I respectfully report that the band of rebels reported west of Calhoun was pursued by Captain Allen's citizen guards until night, when they were relieved by Captain Box, who followed them across the Blackwater and was in close pursuit at noon. The party has dropped men all along the route of their march, and wherever heard from have reported that they were the advance of a more general movement in force. My opinion is that this body will be distributed over the country for the purpose of gaining information, and insure a concert of action between the bands now in the State and a large raiding force to move in a short time from the south. I respectfully recommend a concentration of the troops in my command and in Kansas, and that the line of the Pacific Railroad be guarded by an increased force at this place, Sedalia, and Jefferson City. The stores could be moved to the east, except 2,000 tons of hay collected at this post, which would be a misfortune to lose.

E. B. BROWN,

Brigadier-General.

TIPTON, September 22, 1864.

Captain J. H. STEGER:

A party of sixty guerrillas passed four miles west of Calhoun at 5 o'clock last evening, going toward Warrensburg. Look out for them.

E. B. BROWN,

Brigadier-General.
