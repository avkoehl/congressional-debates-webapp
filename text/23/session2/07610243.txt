1835
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
the patriots of the French Revolution The same
branch of Government (said Mr E ) ought not
to have the power of willing and acting, that the
Executive ought not to judge, but to fulfil the de
cisions of others The President did not even
possess all the powers (said Mr E ) necessary for
executing the laws, but often needed the assistance
of Congress If he did, he could raise money to
support the administration of the laws But for
this no one would contend So the Constitution
declares that all legislative power shall be vested
in Congress This expression was equally strong
with that which declares that all executive power
¡should be vested m the President But that all
legislative power was not vested in Congress was
evident fiom the fact that the Constitution required
the sanction of the President upon a'l laws, and
also gave lnm the ve o privilege Hence it was
probable that no powers were conferred, unless
particularly specified, that the authors of the
Constitution first sta ed the general pioposition
where the executive power should be placed, and
then went on to specify wherein it should consist,
not, like children, to load it with useless repetí
tions, but to define and limit the extent of execu-
tive power Those who claim these powers for
the Executive went upon the supposition that all
powers, not defined by the Constitution, belonged
to the President Whereas the very íeverse of
that was true The Executive possessed only
those particularly specified by that instrument
He contended that the different departments of
Government ought not to be entirely sepaiate and
independent of each other He would make an
exception of the judicial branch, it was not neces
eaiy to connect that witn the others, but the ex-
ecutive and judicial departments ought not to be
separate and independent of each o her
He would next proceed to tne power of remov-
ing from cfnce It was claimed as correlative to
appointing to office The power of repealing
laws did not belong to Congress witnout the«anc
tion of the President The concurrence of all
the parties who made the law was necessary to
repeal it, the President could not appoint to office
without the consent of the Senate, and by the
same reasoning as befoie, the removal could not
be made without the concurrence of the Senate
If the nommaaon of a new candidate was rejected
by the Senate, the incumbent should still continue
to hold his office and exercise its duties In 1789
It was fully difacussed whether the President had I
the power of lemoval or nit, derived fiom the]
Constitution, many gentlemen who had assistec.
in framing the Constitution, participated in that
diseussior, they were about eqially divided be
tween the tw opn ions But duiing the heat and
excitement of deba e, the populan y of General
Washington drew over a majority to the side of
executive power
Mr  KANE said he did i ot mean *o enter mto
this discussion u le lgth     Soon after the forma  ]
Hon of this Govei oment, those who had the pow er
—the ñiat Congress—c'ecided that 'he President
hwd the power of removal from office, as a neces
fcaiy inc dent to theexecutive power     This dec s
ion (he said) had been practically acceded to for
near half a century, and he should not take up
time todiscuss if,and more especially as the ques
t on was not presented by the bi't before the Sen
at     The first section only repealed the law of j
May, 1820, limiting the term of ceitam ofii ers
Whei  did  fhis re¡ eal leave the question of íe   I
n oval'   Precisely vvhei e it was before, and p'aced
the tenure of the e officers wheie the practice of
all pas time hud piaced it—dependent upon Execu-
me i leasure     The second section provides that
disbursing offices s'iall be vacated upon the defal-
ntion of the officei      Here is removal by law,
but no  limitation is  imposed thereby upon the
piecxistin  power of íemoval n the Executive
The thud and list section admits in geneiil terms
the right of the President, without consulting the
Sei ate to remove     And yet it requires the Presi-
dent to lay his reasons therefoi before the Senate
This, if no other reason existed, he thought wis
sufficient to induce him to vote against the bill
Admitting  to its fullest extent the power in the
Piesident which he can ex icise under the Oonsti
tution, without anv responsibi lty except 1.0 the
people through the bal ot boxes, or to the impeach
tngpowci, yet tne bill requnes the President to
give his reasons for exeicising his constitutional
powers to the Senate, to which, in this respect, he
is not confessedly responsible What shall we do
with these ieasons when we get them' Shall we
take the course which was taken with the Secre-
tary of the Treasury, when he laid his reasons for
removing the deposites before Congress' Shall
we resolve that the executive has violated the Con-
stitution ' That we cannot do, because we admit,
by this bill, he has the rig! t to do the act, and that
he can do it regardless of the Senate If he had
no other reason for the vote he was about to
I give, this palpable inconsistency would be suffi-
I cient
I Mi BIBB said he agreed that the executive
power iesided,and should reside, in the President,
but, at the same time, he believed that Congress
had power to regulate it     He thought the Piesi
I dent possessed no other executive powers than
thoseparticulaily specified in the Constitution     If
I more v ere granted, he would have an unlimited,
I boundless power, capable of absorbing all the
other blanches of the Government    Mr  B  allu
j dedto party distinctions and political strife, which
he contended were necessary for the healthy ad-
ministration of public affairs, as much so as the
winds, the^ waves, and tempests weie to purify
the ocean * .No great íeforms could be effected
without the influence of party to carry it on Mr
B went on at some length iii his remarks, and
finally concluded by disclaiming all ambitious
motives and desires of sharing in any furtner polit-
ical pro|ects
Mr SHEPLEY opposed the bill at some length
.Mr  CLAY^ said that at the  last session he
I presented  ícsolutions  íespecting   the   powei   of
I removal by the Executive He still deemed ti e
subject of momentous importance, opening a wide
field for discussion, but le did not propose to
debate it now But he Ujpuld present his views
in the shape of an amendment to the section of the
bi'l which 1 elates to the power of appointment by
the Pres de^t Although he did not formally ofltr
it as an amendment, lie desied that it might he
on the table It is as follows " That m all in
' stances of appointment to office, by and with the
'auvice and consent of the Senate, the power of
'removal shall  be exercised only in eoncunenoe
I ' with the Senate And when the Senate is not in
'sesson, the President may suspend any such
' officer, communicating to the Senate his reasors
' for the suspension, during the fiist month of i s
' succeeding session, and if the Senate concui with
' him, the officei shall be removed, but if it do not
' concur with him, the officei shall be restoied to j
' office " He hoped at another time to be able to
show that the Pies dent had not this power of ,
removal given him in the Constitution—he had 1
searched that instrument wiih his utmost care,
without being able to find it And he was in
hopes that some gel tleman of tne Administration
piny would have undertaken to show that it did
exist O le gentleman ovei the wpy [Mr Kakf]
had only peeped out at it, and the other [Mi
Shepllv] would not touch it at all Wny not'
Why not tike up the Constitution and di cuss u'
Why thus diffident in coming out and giving their
reasons for the existence of a power the practical
operation of which was to give the Executive an
infl lence over an army of men which was not
equalled in mcient Rome' If this powei exist,
let gentlemen show it And when we come here
on Monday, he hoped some of the leaders of the
Administration party, some of the honorable gen-
tlemen then in his ey , would come preDaied to
snow that the power existed and was nghtfully
exercised
Mr BUCHMNAN said he was sorry to see
that the honoiabie gentleman from Kentucky
appeared disposed so fiequently to pay his com
pliments to him------
Mr  CLAY inteiposed, and remaiked that he
did not mean the honorable membei from Penn-
sylvania, but if he chose to come out upon the |
ques ion, bis respect 'or that gentleman would in
duce him to listen to him with great pleasure   He
might have turned his eye toward the honorable
gentleman, but in  truth he meant the Honorable j
membei fom  Nev/ \oik, who sat in the same1
■ atige                                                                            I
Mr BUCHANAN resumed   He had nothing
further to say, except that wl en the hono.able I
f
gentleman fiom Kentucky should come out and
show that a practice which was coexistent with
the Government itself, and which had been exer-
cised by Mr Madison, was unconstitutional, he
would undertake to show, in his humble manner,
that it was constitutional, and that it was a prac-
tice under which this country had flourished to an
extent unexampled in the world
Mr SHEPLEY said that the gentleman from
Kentucky did not understand him correctly He
said that he would not note discuss a question
which opened so wide a field, because there wa3
not time for it He did not and would not shun
an inquiiy into the correctness and constitutional-
ity of a practice which was exercised under every
Admmistiation of the Government, from its or-
ganization down to the present time
The Senate then adjourned
HOUSE OF REPRESENTA! IVES
Satordw, Je&ru.ry 14, 1835
Mr J a ADAMS, on leave, presented several
petitions for the abolition of slavery m the District
of Columbia
Mr S & ADAMS then said, while he had
possession of the floor he hoped the House would
indulge him for a few moments in making a brief
explanation in reference to a matter personal to
himself, and of considerable interest also to the
House
it would be recollected that on that day last
week he offeied a resolution to the House on the
reference of certain documents to the Committee
on Foieign Relations, with instructions to report
forthwith on that pail of the President's message
lelatmg to the state of our affairs with Fiance In
tne course of the remarks he made at that tune,
the expression escaped him, that the othei branch
of the Legislature, after deliberating fully and
thoioughly upon the subject matter ot these rela
tions, had ultimately come to the determination
unanimously to " dolge" the question The House
would lecollect that the moment he used thewoid
tne Speaker arres ed his remaiks, under the rultf
of the House forbidding any member thereof to
refer to anything that had taken place, or might
be taking place, in the other bianch of the Legisla-
ture By doing so, ti e Speaker, Mr A had no
doubt wi hout any intention, had depnved him o
the means of giving an explanation at the time
He v/as, therefore, silenced, and took his seat
But it struck him then as a very hard case to b 
auested upon a mere simple íuleof the House,
which was violated every day by almost eve y
member, viz a single reference to the proceed-
ings  of the other bianch of the Legislarme, and ha
thought himself called upon to ask the Speaker
privately why it was that he was so arrested under
that lule, when other members were allowed ths
indulgence e/ery day in almost every debate that
took place The Speaker then informed Mr A.
that it was not the simple reference to the pro-
ceedings in the other branch which had induced
him to stop Mr A , but that he thought the use
of the term ' dodge," with reference to their pro-
ceedings, was disrespectful, and that it was on
that account alone he had done so It was the
manner of the allusion, and not the allusion itself
upon which the Speaker thought propei to arrest
Mr A 's remaiks Inus he was precluded from
making, as he wished, an explanation at the mo
ment, and for which he now lose to make
Mr A then e.aid he disclaimed all intention
whatever, in the most positive and explicit terms,
of being disrespectful He not only intended
nothing disiespectful, but it was his miention to
have recommended the House to do the same
thing His object was that the House should
have deliberated unon the sulject, and he should
then have recommended it to " dodge" the ques-
tion as the Senate had done, at least for the pres-
ent He wished to make th s explanation, for he
had been given to anderstand that several individ-
ual members of the other branch of the Legislature
had felt themselves hurt at the expression used
oy him He reiterated, therefore, in the most
positive and explicit manner, that he was far,
very far, fiom inter ding anything disrespectful to
the House or to the Senate, by the use of the
term "dodge "   He tnought then, and he still
