firing heard at 9 o'clock this morning in the direction of Zollicoffer. Cannot Wharton move forward immediately? The Sixtieth [Virginia] will reach Glade Spring Tuesday morning. If General Jones is taken the salt-works must fall. If Wharton moves immediately, they are in danger of raids from direction of Russell and Tazenwell. A small guard might be left at Saltville. Please reply to-night.

Honorable JAMES A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War:

Cannot hear from General Jones. Enemy burned a railroad bridge 4 miles this side of Bristol, at Goodson's, showing their immediate object to be the capture of General Jones. Can you not re-enforce Wharton? He will advance as soon as he gets the Sixtieth [Virginia Regiment] against the force in General Jones' rear. His situation is most critical. A force will be left at Saltville to guard against a raid.

THOMAS DODAMEAD,Superintendent, &amp;c.,:

There are 200 home guard at Liberty, under Captain L. A. Sale 100 at Salem, under Colonel G. P. Terrill, 250 at Christiansburg, under Major J. M. Wade. The home guards of Wythe, at Wytheville, are under Major J. F. Kent. Please telegraph these commanders, and make arrangements to transport their men immediately to Saltville. I am doubtful as yet about sending the men from this county. Colonel Jones cannot get the Sixtieth [Virginia] here until 8 o'clock to-morrow morning, 21 st; have transportation.

CHAS. S. STRINGFELLOW,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

Send copies of last telegram to Terrill and Wade.

Colonel GEORGE S. PATTON,

Commanding, &c.:

COLONEL: The situation in and near East Tennessee is exceedingly precarious. I have therefore ordered the Sixtieth Virginia Regiment form the Narrows to Saltville, and telegraphed you last night to send a company to the Narrows as a guard. This move of course exposes you and Colonel McCausland yet more, but there is no alternative.
