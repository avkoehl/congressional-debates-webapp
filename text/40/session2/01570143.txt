Mr. STANBERY. We object to argument
now; that is all.
Mr. Manager BUTLER, (to the witness.)

your action was illegal, and which convinced
you, as you say, with other facts -

ask that that question lie reduced to writing.

able to reduce it to writing if you do not stop
interrupting me. I will put the question now
once more. [To the witness. ] You had a letter
from Mr. Stanton which, together with other
facts that had happened, convinced you that
Stanton meant not to give up the office. Now,
sir, with that letter in your pocket, why did you
not report it to your chief? _

way: the time was noted when I had this con-
