20-pounder Parrotts. The ammunition used in the 3-inch Parrotts is not good, or the gunners, I don't know which.

Respectfully,

General BUTTERFIELD, Chief of Staff:

The enemy seems to be in heavy force in front of both Reynolds and Brooks, and to be forming for an attack. We are ready for them.

HEADQUARTERS LEFT WING,April 30, 1863-8.45 p. m.

Major-General BUTTERFIELD, Chief of Staff:

I have directed the four regiments engaged in taking up the bridges to accompany pontoons until they meet detachment from Couch's corps. Please have that detachment sent promptly; I cannot afford to lose four regiments, and if these are compelled to go all the way to Bank's Ford they will be wholly unserviceable to-morrow.

JOHN SEDGWICK,

Major-General, Commanding Left Wing.

Major General D. BUTTERFIELD,

Chief of Staff, Army of the Potomac:

GENERAL: I have the honor to state that Major-General Reynolds reports the casualties to-day in First Corps by the enemy's shelling, as follows: First Division, killed 2, wounded 4; Second Division, killed 4, wounded 12. Total, 5 killed and 16 wounded.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOHN SEDGWICK,

Major-General, Commanding Left Wing.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,April 30, 1863.

Major-General SEDGWICK, Commanding, &c.:

GENERAL: The Fifth, Eleventh, and Twelfth Corps are all up at Chancellorsville. Two divisions of Couch's probably now crossing. Sickles, as you are aware, is on his way there. Nothing that we can get at present indicates much force of the enemy in their front. The general as he left expressed great anxiety for prompt and frequent reports and information. I think it would favor operations if you were to make tremendous demonstrations of camp-fires to-night. Have you received the order to keep your supplies replenished in knapsacks and haversacks?
