Will General Smith have the kindness to forward to me the surgeons' certificate upon which Captain Farquhar, of the Engineers was granted leave of absence if one was permitted or state what application and for what purpose leave of absence was granted him.*

JULY 5, 1864. (Sent 12 m.)

Major General W. F. SMITH,

Commanding Eighteenth Corps:

Colonel Shaffer is sick at Fortress Monroe. Ever since your lines have been established at Petersburg, and since it seemed probable that siege operations were to be commenced, I have been doing the duties of chief of staff. Lieutenant Michie is really performing the active duties of chief engineer. We are building three batteries on our right, so as to release the navy, which will be driven out without a doubt as soon as the heavy battery which the rebels have at the Howlett house opens. We are fortifying the position at Deep Bottom, six miles distant from here. These works,all commenced under directions from General Grant, are to be pushed. The only reliable man we have here to push them is Michie. I did not know that Bowen was absent sick. I have requested General Barnard now to give you a regular officer from the Army of the Potomac.

Respectfully,

G. WEITZEL,

Brigadier-General and Acting Chief of Staff.

CITY POINT, July 5, 1864.

Major-General SMITH;

Saw General Barnard. He agreed with you. I will be away four or five days unless Comstock telegraphs me or you. Michie is very likely to be over.

F. U. FARQUHAR.
