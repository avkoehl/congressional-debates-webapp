tobacco, for the fiscal year ending June 30,
1872, $3,980,005 03. There was shipped in
bond 17,918,667J pounds, which paid into the
Federal Treasury, after allowing one tenth for
exportation, $5,160,453 53, making in all, upon
the manufactured tobacco from Virginia the
sum of $9,140,458 56. The tax upon tobacco
shipped in bond to New York, Philadelphia,
Boston, and Baltimore being paid in those
cities by the commission merchants to whom
the Virginia manufacturer consigns his tobacco,
went to swell the amount of internal revenue
returned as paid by New York, Pennsylvania,
Massachusetts, and Maryland, and for which
Virginia receives no credit. Take from those
States the tobacco tax paid there on Virginia
tobacco, and add the same to the tax paid in
Virginia,.and in the year 1872 Virginia would
stand the fourth State in the payment of in-
ternal revenue.
This is what Virginia pays into the Federal
Treasury. Let us see how the current has
run, when you come to paying out. Prom the
year 1824 to 1869, inclusive, there were ap-
propriated to rivers and harbors in the States
the sum of $22,978,955 53 ; and of this sum—
Michigan received $2,593,219 65
Wisconsin received  1,116,057 87
Virginia received  70,00u 00
By the river and harbor bill of June 11,
1870, there was appropriated $3,893,400; and
of this sum—
Michigan received. - $357,500
Wisconsin received  167,500
Virginia received  50,000
By the river and harbor bill of March 8,
1871, there was appropriated $4,416,500.
Michigan received ..$510,500
Wisconsin received  308,500
Virginia received - 115.000
By the act of June 10, 1872, there was ap-
propriated for rivers and harbors $4,363,000.
Michigan received '. $656,500
Wisconsin received  300,500
Virginia received  111,500
Hence we see that from 1824 to 1872 there
has been appropriated to rivers and harbors
the sum of $35,651,855 53; of this sum—
Michigan has received $4,047,719 65
Wisconsin has received  1,81)2.557 57
Virginia has received  346,500 00
For the fiscal year ending June 30, 1870—
Michigan paid internal revenue $2,918,987 30
Wisconsin  2,363,015 03
Virginia, including tax on tobacco
shipped in bond 10,616,832 43
For the fiscal year ending June 80, 1871—
Michigan paid internal revenue $2,639,970 28
Wisconsin  1,977,703 87
Virginia, including tax on tobacco
shipped in bond  11,357,239 99
For the fiscal year ending June 30, 1872—
Michigan paid internal revenue — 43,399,972 85
Wisconsin  2,000,226 5o
Virginia, including tax on tobacco
shipped in bond  10,099,481 46
For the three years, 1870, 1871, and 1872—
Michigan paid internal revenue $7,958,929 93

Virginia  32,103,553 88
The population of—
Michigan in 1870 ^*1§4,059
Wisconsin \
Virginia - 1,225,163
During these satne years—
Michigan received for improvements $1,524,500
Wisconsin  77b,500
Virginia    276,500
The Committee on Commerce not having
yet reported their bill to the House, 1 cannot
speak of its contents, but it is fair to presume
that appropriations in the forthcoming bill are
in pursuance of the policy that has heretofore
controlled the river and harbor bills.
The figures that I have given make rather
an unfavorable exhibit of burdens and returns.
Here we have three States, with nearly the
same population, and about the satne distance
of coast, lake, and inland navigation, and
while Virginia for the last three years has
been paying into the Federal Treasury about
five dollars to one as compared with the States
of Michigan and Wisconsin, she has received
back by appropriations to internal improve-
ments only about one dollar to four compared
with those States.
Even the Representatives from these States,
Messrs. Sawyer and Conger, who are upon
the Committee of Commerce, and also upon
the sub-committee that have in special charge
the river and harbor bill, cannot justify so un-
equal a distribution of appropriations.
Virginia now asks an appropriation to deepen
the channel of James river from Richmond to
Hampton Roads, so as to give sixteen feet of
water. This depth is now especially demanded
to meet the wants of the rapidly increasing
trade that must pass over that river. For this
work the engineer r«morts $100,000 as suffi-
cient. She also asks $8,000,000 to commence
the enlargement and completion of the James
River and Kanawha canal and for the im-
provement of New river, about one third the
estimated cost for steamboat navigation, say
$350,000; in all, $8,450,000; or about two
millions less than the tax on Virginia produc-
tion and labor is annually yielding to the Fed-
eral 'Preasuay. In the face of these undeni-
able facts, will Congress refuse to make the
appropriations ?

SPEECH OF HON. M. M. WALDEN,
OF IOWA,
In the House of Representatives,
February 13, 1873,
On presenting the joint resolution of the Legislature
of Iowa in regard to commerce by railroads.
Mr. WALDEN. As a preliminary to the
remarks I wish to submit, I call attention to
the following joint resolution of the Legisla-
ture of Iowa :
Joint resolution relative to commerce by railroads.
Whereas the Constitution of the United States
vests in Congress the power to regulate commerce
among the States; and whereas the regulation of
freight charges made by railroad companies whose
lines extend from one State to another State is prop-
erly included within such powers ; and whereas the
exorbitant charges made by many of the railroad
companies of the United States, and particularly by
those who have lines in the State of Iowa, have be-
come grievously oppressive to the people: Therefore,
Be it resolved by the General Assembly of the titate
of Iowa, That our Senators in Congress be in-
structed and our Representatives be reauosted to
use their influence in favor of and to vote for some
bill which will correct the existing abuses and grant
the relief so much needed, and also to secure liberal
appropriation for improvement of the navigation of
the Mississippi, Wisconsin, and Fox rivers.
Resolved, That in thus memorialising Congress
we do not surrender the right of the General Assem-
bly of this State to control freight and passenger
tariffs on railroads within its borders.
Approved January 25,1873.
I, Josiah T. Young, secretary of State of the
State of Iowa, hereby certify that the foregoing is a
true and correct copy of a joint resolution passed at
the adjourned session of tile fourteenth General
Assembly of the State of Iowa, and approved Jan-
uary 25,1873.
In testimony whereof I have hereunto set my
hand and caused the great seal of the State to be
nffixfid#
Done at Des Moines this 27th day of January,
[l.s.] A-D-1873- JOSIAH T. 1'OUNG,
Secretin-y of State,
Mr. Speaker, I fully agree with the views
expressed in the preamble and resolutions
which have been read in your hearing. Num-
erous appeals have come to us from the'
great Northwest asking for legislation on this
subject and giving abundant reason therefor.
The protection of western farmers against
the further encroachment of railroads is our
imperative duty. Powerful corporations have
intrenched themselves behind special priv-
ileges, and are gathering wealth without due
regard to the public welfare.
It is not denied that railroads are a great
benefit to the country, advancing civilization
and affording rapid means of communication.
They develop waste places and bring into mar-
ket large tracts of land which otherwise would
remain vacant and worthless. But they were
created to advance the public interest as well
as that of the persons who operate them.
Shall they now be Used to oppress the public 1
In many cases they have been fostered by a
generous people. Congress has ceded to them
large and valuable tracts of land, while citi-
zens along the lines have made liberal conces-
sions and given freely of their means.
Is it right, then, in view of these facts, for
the roads to be used to enrich a few without
regard to the claims of those who nursed them
into life? They are mainly in the hands of
men who are prompt to discover and take
advantage of every opportunity to advance
their own selfish aims without considering the
welfare of the public. By unfair discrimina-
tions in their rates of charges they oppress the
smaller towns and farming districts. Tribute
is levied on the weak for the benefit of the
strong. The direct effect of this unjust dis-
crimination is to retard the growth of the
smaller towns and impoverish the country,
inflicting special hardships on the farmer, who
among all his fellows has a calling most use-
ful and honorable.
Mr. Speaker, I was surprised the other day
to see manifestations of levity on the part of
members of the House when the gentleman
from Ohio, [Mr. Wilson,] as chairman of the
Committee on Agriculture, sought a moderate
appropriation for the advancement of this most
important branch of industry. Our institutions
must rest mainly on the love and intelligence
of the farmer; and the Government itself will
be strong in so far as it depends for safety on
a people distinguished for industry and intelli-
gence. These are the elements which build
up a nation. On the other hand, idleness and
vice tend to destroy the nation. Therefore,
let us foster such industries as have a tendency
to fit men for their duties as citizens; and in
no event can we afford to tolerate monop-
olies which in their selfish greed oppress the
farmer and drive him from his useful calling.
This is precisely what railway combinations
are doing in the West. Their rates for trans-
portation are so oppressive that the producer
is forced to expend the bulk of his grain in
sending the remnant to market. By the most
frugal industry and closest economy he is
scarcely able to keep the wolf from the door.
Hard times in this way creep upon the country,
bringing a train of evils which cannot be esti-
mated. Young men are seized with a fatal
desire to give up the increasing drudgery of
the farm for the fancied ease and comfort of
city life. Schools are left with meager sup-
port and the education of children neglected.
The learned gentleman from Pennsylvania,
[Mr. Kelley,] in alluding to these evils a short
time since, expressed a hope that the children
in the West would correct the errors of their
fathers by building up manufactories. No
doubt some relief could be secured in this
way ; but that is a remedy which cannot be
applied without first giving protection against
the railroads. Capital is sensitive, seeking the
best opportunities for investment, and will not
locate where it will be subject to the hardships
of which we complain. After' supplying the
home demand the manufacturer would find
himself subject to exorbitant local rates on the
railroads and would soon realize the fact that
he could not compete with others in like busi-
ness at points more favored by the railway cor-
porations. In short, all branches of industry
suffer from railway extortions ; and thus do we
see both money and power passing gradually
fi om the people to the monopolies.
Shall we as the Representatives of the peo-
ple, commissioned to shield all classes from
wrong, make no effort to restrain the aggress-
