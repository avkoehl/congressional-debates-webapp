Assistant Adjutant-General, Warrensburg, Mo.:

I have just returned from Westport. We have 50 sick and disabled soldiers there in general hospital. It would be unsafe to leave them unprotected. Shall I send one company there? Please answer.

SPRINGFIELD, MO., May 6, 1864.

Major O. D. GREENE,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

A scouting party under Captain [Ruark] returned from Gilstrop's Ferry and Grand River to Neosho on the evening of the 3rd instant. Captain reports not more than 150 rebels in that vicinity, and they refused to fight. He captured one of Stand Watie's command, an Indian, who says that a large number of rebels have gone north in small parties, and that 300 of these men are Quantrill's, and that Quantrill himself is north. I doubt the correctness of these statements. It may be true.

JOHN B. SANBORN,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARKANSAS CAVALRY,In Field, May 6, 1864.

General SANBORN:

Colonel Phelps left camp and made for the enemy day before yesterday evening. The train of the regiment had been captured Sunday in Richland; 30 men of the escort killed. By special messenger just arrived Colonel Phelps announces that he has met the enemy and whipped him, and recaptured 30 mules. The train is destroyed. Colonel Phelps charges me to inform you that it will be impossible for his command to remain in the country on account of forage. Two hundred men is all he can mount on serviceable horses. No loss in the last engagement. Your orders issued to Major Murphy, who will act upon his responsibility in the matter, and has been notified of your intentions of his being at Cassville.

L. REMIATTE,

Adjutant Second Arkansas Cavalry.
