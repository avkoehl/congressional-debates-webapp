It rs inanife.-tlv the interest ot" this Government
thai foreign coin coming here stamped in foreign
countries, not easily recognized, and not freely
passing among our citizens engaged in commerce,
should be recoined, and receive tli? stamp of the
coin of our own country. All this might be ac-
complished 10 a far greater extent than is now
done, if a branch Mint were located at the city of
New Vork. That is the point towards which this
great amount of specie and of bullion is being con-
centrated by the natural channels of commerce. I
will now slate, in reply to the remark madeon the
other side, that this couid all be transferred to
Philadelphia in a short time, and at a small ex-
pense, that the annual charge would be at least
$30,000 for the amount received at the present
time. And it is admitted by the gentleman from
Pennsylvania [Mr. Chakdler] that the lowest
amount, even under the pressure which is neces-
sary in order to avoid the result he is here com-
bating, he supposes th-s could be carried for on
some offer which has been made by somebody—
1 do not know whn—is $25,OJO per annum.
Mr. FLORENCE. My colleague can inform
the gen leman.
Mr. SEYMOUR. If i  be made by a corpora-
tion, it will make no difference with me in the
point which I intend to make. Neither will it
make a difference whether the amount be $25,000
or 830,000. 1 understand that the Camden and
Amboy Railroad Company have offered to carry
it for the price specified by the gentleman.
Mr. FLORENCE. 1 deeire only to call the
attention of my colleague to the suggestion of the
gentleman, that he was not aware that the persons
who offered to do this were responsible, because
my colleague knows as well as 1 do that they are
responsible.
Sir. SEVMOUR. I have said nothing expli-
cit I v in regard to that.
Air. FLORENCE. I do not desire to inter-
rupt the gentleman, but he can appreciate the in-
terest I feel in this matter; &nd it is, therefore,
that I desire he may be made acquainted with the
fact-3 or the case.
Air. SEVMOUR. I was aware of the deep in-
terest which the gentleman from Pennsylvania
felt in this matter before. But, sir, this expense,
whatever it be, is to be borne by somebody, and, ,
even taking it at the amount at which the Gentle-
man would have it now placed, without, I think,
any sufficient guarantee that it can be held there
for years to come, I submit to this House whether
it is not a charge on the country, on the producers
of gold, and on those who come to that port,
where they desire to change foreign coin for Amer- ,
ican, which should not be imposed ? It falls upon
somebody, and, as in all of these cases, every
such charge falls upon the producer, or upon the
emigrant who brings in this foreign coin.
Rut, sir, the view of this as a tax extorting from
the producers and those who bring coin of foreign
countries here to an amount which should not be
itiposed upon them for the benefit of private spec-
ula!, on—for it all goes to the bankers—is not the
worst view of the case. It was a favorite idea
with the people of this country, particularly with
that party to which you and I belong, Mr. Speak-
er, that, in establishing an Independent Treasury—
a constitutional Treasury in this country, we
should secure to the people a circulating medium
in the precious metals—we should drive out spu-
rious bank paper—we should put a check to those
expansions which shipwrecked the business of
the conntry in 1&37, and we should give the peo-
ple what thev deserve to have, a constitutional
hard money currency. This effirt seems likely
to fail, unless you can have planted at that point
where the greatest portion of your revenue is col-
lected, and towards which this vast influx of the
precious metal tends, an institution which will
convert this into a circulating medium—not into
ingots, not into fifty dollar pieces, not into twenty
dollar pieces, not even into eagles, but into the
smaller coin, to be distributed among the people
in the ordinary interchange of business.
We achieved the establishment of an Independ-
ent Treasury, after a long and violent political |
struggle, and we have been heie waiting for years 1
to realue the golden expectations then promised,
without even seeming to advance one step towards
the anticipated result. That sagacious man, who,
during the administration of President Polk, stood
at the head of the financial affairs of this Govern-
ment, perceived this necessity, and in the very first
communication that Mr. Walker made as Secre-
tary of the Treasury to this House, in December,
1845, he urged on Congre.-s, in connection with
carrying out the measures intended by the estab-
lishment of an Independent Treasury the establish-
ment also of a branch Mint at the city of New
York.
He again repeated this recommendation in his
report in 1846. He renewed it again in 1847,and
in 1848 he spread out at large one of the most
powerful arguments that has ever been presented
yet upon this subject.
I have not time here, and it would not be, per-
haps, interesting to this House to listen to the
reading of that portion of the letter of Mr. Secre-
tary Walker; but I commend it to the attention of
every gentleman here as an argument that never
has been answered, and never can be, fully estab-
lishing the necessity of a branch Mint fit New
York. What has been the fate of this measure,
thus strongly recommended, and that, too, from a
source which enjoyed the confidence of the domi-
nant party of this country? Why, a bill passed
this House establishing the Mint in New York.
It was defeated by a small vote in the Senate.
Another bill was introduced here since that, and
was defeated in this House. 1 shall not here at-
tempt to delineate the causes which have led to the
defeat of a measure so strongly recommended and
so much needed as this is confessed to be by the
whole commercial community. Every gentleman
present knows what those causes are, and I do
not design to occupy the tune of the House in re-
capitulating them. Let it be remembered that
these powerful recommendations of Secretary
Walker were made anterior to the reception of
the golden harvest from California. In 1848 we
had not begun to realize, in its effects upon our
commerce and trade, the possession within our own
borders of such a vast quantity of the precious
metals. In 1848, the Secretary says that the
amount of coinage from 1792 at the Mint at Phil-
adelphia had been only the sum of $116,000,000,
after a period of fifty-three years from the estab-
lishment of that Mint, and yet since 1848 down
to the present time, embracing the coinage of 1852,
we have exceeded the amount of all the previous
coinage by $80,000,000, making the amount of
coinage within the last five years $196,000,000,
and upwards. This appears by the following
table:

Why is it that the amount of the circulating
medium has not been increased, and instead of
having a larger volume of specie currency in this
country, we are inundated to a greater extent than
you were in 1837, with the issue of worthless
bank paper? It is because the Mint has not given
us an adequate amount of the smaller denomina-
tions of coin.
Mr. CHANDLER. Will the honorable gen-
tleman allow me to deny that assertion?
Mr. SEYMOUR. I hope that the gentleman
1 will not interrupt me. ^
! Mr. CHANDLER. You assert that which is
not the fact.
Mr. SEYMOUR. I declare it now.
Mr. CHANDLER. Then you assert that
which is not the fact.
Mr. SEYMOUR. I lay it down as a fact es-
tablished by official data, and I have before me,
the proof of it. I refer to the gold coinage of the
year 1851, which I gather from reliable statistics.
They are as follows: Whole coinage of gold,
$62,614,492. Of this there were, of double eagles,
§48,043,100; eagles, $4,393,280 ; half eagles,
§2,651,955; quarter eagles, $3,867,337; and dol-
lars, $3,658,820. Thus it appears that the coinage
of that year of gold, was $62,614,000, and of
that there were coined in twenty dullar gold pieces,
which scarcely ever find their way into circula-
tion in the country, $48,000,000 and upwards,
leaving only $14,500,000 devoted to that species
of currency which answers the purposes of gen-
eral circulation. Fourteen millions and a half less
by $6,000,000 than the amount of gold coined
in 1847, before we had received this vast amount
from California.
But I perceive that my limited time is pass-
ing, and that I must omit to say many things I •
would be glad to present upon this subject, and
will call the attention of the House to one or
two other points in conclusion. Not only has the
vast amount of precious metal increased during
this time, and found its way to New York, but
there has been a large increase of commerce also
at that point since 1848. The amount of exports
and imports at that city then was §129,000,000,
while the amount now is $180,000,000, of which
during the past year. $37,000,000 were in specie.
The great problem laid down by Mr. Walker for
us, as an American Congress, to accomplish, is
yet to be worked out, and that is, to plant in this
country a power that will successfully countervail
that on the other side ofthe water, which has con-
trolled the financial operations of the world. I
move the previous question.
[Here the hammer fell.]
Mr. VENABLE. Had not the gentleman's
time expired before he moved the previous ques-
tion.
The SPEAKER. The motion is before the
House.
Mr. VENABLE. I hope it will be voted
down.
The question was then put on Mr. Seymour's
motion, and on a division there were—ayes 72,
noes not counted.
Mr. FLORENCEdemanded tellers, which were
ordered; and Messrs. Davis, of Indiana, and Wil-
cox were appointed.
The question was then taken; and the tellers
reported that there were—ayes 76, noes 44.
So the previous question being seconded, the
main question was ordered to fce put.
The question now being upon the rejection of
the bill,
Mr. FLORENCE demanded the yeas and nays;
which were ordered.
Mr. BROOKS. Mr. Speaker, I wish to present
some views.
Mr. HOUSTON. I have no objection to the
1 gentleman making his speech, but I present the
I point of order that this is not the time contempla-
' ted by the rule, for him to close the debate,
i The SPEAKER. The Chair thinks it is with
! the gentleman to determine whether he will avail
I himself of the privilege now, or take the chances
I hereafter.
Mr. FLORENCE. Has the morning hour ex-
! pired ?
j The SPEAKER. It has not.
r Mr. BURT. I rise to suggest to the Chair that,
under the rule, the gentleman from New York [Mr.
Brooks] has no right at this.moment to make a
| speech, at the conclusion of this debate. That
rule, governing this matter, as I remember, gives
II the right to the member who reports a bill to the
| House. Now, sir, this bill has not been received
r by the House. It has been merely presented to
the House; and I submit to the Chair, that the
gentleman from New York has no right, under the
rule, to occupy the floor at this time ta make an
hour's speech.
The SPEAKER. The proposition is not, ac-
cording to the decision of the Chair, upon the re-
ception of the bill. The question of reception is
not raised. The 116th rule reads thus:
