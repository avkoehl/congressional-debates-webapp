FORT LEAVENWORTH, October 8, 1864.

Colonel FORD, Pleasant Hill:

Dislike to move away that force, but you must judge. You are on outpost duty, and all your force must fall back if large force moves against you.

S. R. CURTIS,

Major-General.

FORT LEAVENWORTH, October 8, 1864.

Colonel FORD, Pleasant Hill:

What was reported Anderson near Lexington may be Marmaduke. If very heavy force approach you will, of course, fall back. Lines may be cut everywhere, and this precaution is given for you in case we are not in communication.

S. R. CURTIS,

Major-General.

PLEASANT HILL, October 8, 1864-9.25 p. m.

Major S. C. CHARLOT, Fort Leavenworth:

Enemy marching on Sedalia. If the telegraph is cut would it not be well to keep up an express between here and Olathe? Express started from here and Olathe in the morning, meeting half way and returning.

FORD,

Colonel.

FORT LEAVENWORTH, October 8, 1864.

Colonel R. T. VAN HORN, Kansas City:

I understand Colonel Ford has arms which can be used by your militia. If not I will do the best I can to help you. Those at Saint Joseph are in charge of General Craig in absence of General Fisk, and, like others, will be for use as fast as men turn out. All your people should be organized and drilling.

S. R. CURTIS,

Major-General.

KANSAS CITY, October 8, 1864.

Major-General CURTIS:

Colonel Ford has no arms. I have all I can procure in use. Can you send me any by to-morrow's boat-say 250, with accouterments and ammunition, say 50,000 rounds? Citizens out this evening, but two-thirds armed.

R. T. VAN HORN.
