PATTERSON, MO., November 24, 1863.

[General FISK:]

GENERAL: Sergeant Gillespie, the same man who was captured with Pollok, has made his escape from Reves, and is now in camp. He reports that Reves is in Cherokee Bay with 80 men; that they have now about 400 men, perhaps 500 in all, and are making preparations to attack this place; that they are determined to have me. I am not going to run. You have the thing as I have it. I think I had better have another company of men. I now have 30 men out, who will not be here for two days more. I do not want too many, for fear they will not come, but want enough to whip them when they come. I heard the same thing from a citizen of Arkansas to-day, who had been down there. Colonel Shaver is in command of the rebels.

W. T. LEEPER,

Captain, Commanding Outpost.

SAINT LOUIS, MO., November 25, 1863.

Brigadier-General FISK, Pilot Knob, Mo.:

Reports from the southwest also indicate the movement of a considerable rebel force from there in a northeasterly direction, apparently with the intention of joining McRae. I am about to send the First Nebraska into Northern Arkansas. I am in doubt whether to send it via Pilot Knob or Rolla. If you are strong enough to meet McRae, I prefer to send it to Rolla. Inform me what force you will be able to concentrate.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF SOUTHEASTERN MISSOURI,Pilot Knob, Mo., November 25, 1863.

Captain RICE:

Hildebrandt, with 20 men, plundered Farmington this afternoon, and left with their pillage on the Jackson road at about 4 o'clock. I think you can certainly catch him. Strike swiftly. Keep [George W.] Hummel. Get horses for his men, if possible, and don't stop until you kill these rascals. Go at once. Kill them you find them.

CLINTON B. FISK,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF SOUTHEASTERN MISSOURI,Pilot Knob, Mo., November 25, 1863.

Captain RICE, Fredericktown:

Hildebrandt must have passed very near your post, as he moved up to Farmington. The people must have known he was in the country. Press every man, horse, and gun you can find, and let the hunt, pursuit, and extermination be sure and swift. A portion of his gang are in Federal uniform.

CLINTON B. FISK,

Brigadier-General.
