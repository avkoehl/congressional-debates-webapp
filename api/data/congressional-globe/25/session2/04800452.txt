Mr C \.SEY wirmly opposed the íecommitment of the bill
with the injunctions He wished the gentleman fiom Ken

woull wuh Congress to adopt to pievent settlements on the

Mr MA^OV oí Ohio begged Mr Underwood to withdraw

The question then rerurred on Mr Brigcs s amendra<-[it
Mr C\SEY opposed di*  amendment withgi eat earne   íes
He was m favor oí the bill and believed that mgood fai 1, it
ought to pass    It would greatly promote the merest pf a huge
and worthy and very meritorious class of -citizens—a 'CÍass- of
citizens in every way deserving the liberality, or, at least, the jus
tice, of the Nuional Legislature He wished the bill to pass,
but feared the long speeches of its friends would jeopardize its
passage, but, ibove all, he dxeadedand deprecated this flood of
amendments that wa^s iiowmg on the bill from all quarttrs, by
ft lends ind foes to mos* of which he had objected, but, above
all, ht-obiec edto the one then under consideiation Heolj-'Ct
ed to it upon the ground that it would render uncertain, unsafe,
and insecure land title^ acquired under it He was willing eve-
íy possible guard shoula be thiown around the bill to prevent
fiaud in acquiring titles to land Punish the individual who, to
avail himself of the act should swear falselj —punish him with
fine md ímpiisonmentif >ou please, or any other punishment or
disqualification, taut never by your legislation, unsettle, or ren
der uncertain or insecure, his land title Am dst the oft repeated
comp'amta made to the land system of the Federal Government
b> the people of the new States, they always applauded ltfor
one thing—the title to their land was good, no uncertainty in the
title, no lawsuits about land tales but he predicted that, If this
amendment prevailed, theie would be more land litigation and
lawruits m the new States in the next five years than had been,
under the present system, in the last fifty )ears, or since the or
gamzation of the piesent land system going, as it proposed to
do, behind the patent
