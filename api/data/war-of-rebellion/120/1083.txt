OFFICE COMMISSARY-GENERAL OF PRISONERS,

Washington, D. C., November 2, 1864.

Major General W. H. HALLECK, Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your communication of the 31st ultimo, calling my attention to certain extract from inspection reports of the Northern Department for August and September, 1864, and I beg leave respectfully to make the following reply:

It is a matter of much doubt whether, in case of a revolt by the prisoners, artillery could be used to any good effect. Unless defended by the infantry, it would be taken possession of by the prisoners, and if so defended there would probably be little use for it. There is a battery of artillery at the camp, which is quite sufficient for overawing the prisoners, and its judicious use must depend on the ability of the commanding officer. the guard is furnished with 500 revolvers, which in most cases likely to arise is a better arm than artillery.

Instructions were given to Colonel Sweet, commanding, on the 9th of September to substitute a 6-inch water pipe for the 3-inch one now in use, and to establish hydrants at as many places in both camps as might be required, and the work should have been completed before this time.

It is within the authority of the commanding officer to replace the "Farmer boilers" when they are worn out, and he will doubtless do so.

The failure to supply medicine is a matter which belongs to the office of the Surgeon-General, whose attention will be invited to the matter.
