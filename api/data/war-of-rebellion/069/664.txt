General M. C. MEIGS,

Quartermaster-General:

I have inspected the depot at this place. It is in a most efficient state. All needful supplies are on hand and wagons transport them easily to the army. Many wounded are being brought in; probably 5,000 are yet to arrive, still transports are not delayed here one moment unnecessarily. I have given all proper orders and shall return to general headquarters this evening.

RUFUS INGALLS,

Brigadier-General.
