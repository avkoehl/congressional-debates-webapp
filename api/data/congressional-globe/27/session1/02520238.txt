merit, but the present measures are only uvended to be tempo
rary, and they are unnecessary and impolitic at present
Mr NISBETsaid ¡t was a matter oí curiosity, to say the
least of it, that the gentleman from Virginia, [Mr Wise j tnd
thegentleman from South Caiohna, [Mi Pickens ] should be
opposed to inquines, the object of winch was l> obtain light and
information on a subject which was so deeply interesting to
them and their consutuents Ii this was a pioposition It okmsr
to a tariff for piotection, he was with those gentlemen Jlut if
the object was, as he supposed, to obtain light and intelligence,
he was opposed to the views of those twu gentlemen, and as an
anti taufTman he was in favor of these inquiries
Mr N contended that the couise pin sued by the British
Parliament wasa fair illustration on this subject The repoit
of the committee there, he said, had doñeas much towaids. es
tablishing the doctnne of free trade as any thing that had o<
curred m ret ent times, or, at all érenla, he tiusted it wuuld
have that effect
What was the object of this resolution? Wn it a tirnT for
protectioní Ashe understood if, it was.for mJormation Gen
tlemen said it wab with a view to pi >tection Pid the inquiry
necessai lly tend to that? Nut so But bpieg, ts he wis, an
an  tariff" man, opposed to a tanlFfoi protection, he wanted
this light Iledid not piofess to be like the gentleman from
South Caiohna, [Mr Pickens] so well mfoimedas roiendei

rather deceived and misled (ban enlightened by the it pins
made by distiuguisned men in the absence of piictiril infor
mation     lie, theiefoie, wished piactical men to speak
Mr PlCKfoNS explained He had, he said, distinctly taken
the giound thatif it wisthe object of the committee to obtain
information with a vit w ton vise our tanfl syi em on the on
ginal basis, and without refeienie to the great pnnciples of the
compromise act, i might be a mattei ol va t iinpo arire to
obtainall the inform ition withinourieach
Mr NISBCT pioreeded to say that ii wi, weie to meet th*1
question of a taiifi f n protection, it would he bt i ei to s t me
all the light we could The gentleman Mom Vnginn [Mi

Mi   WISE proposed to amend the bill at er the woid ' steam

N iw ti employ m th u stead  such oth* r ^es-el&of equal
foice as he mi°ht be able to procure
Mr ADAMS strongly objected to giving the Secretary any
such discretion he wished it settled by law that there
should be two steamers at the least employed in this Home
¡squadron he considered thorn as by far the most efficient part
of if
Mi WISE suggested that possibly the steamers rrt^ht not be
ready as soon as was expected, and that it would be exdedient in
such cabe to let the secretary provide, in the imei val, such
force as he could get and he offered t > modily his amendment
by adding to it a provi-o that the Secretary should employ the
steamers as soon as they could b- prepared
Mr ADAMS said, he had rat he i the bill should stand as it
did, because if, m con-equenee of the steameis"not being in
readme&s, he should employ other veasels, he would take the
m  ney now appiopnated to pay them, and then the House
would he tailed upon alteiwards foi more money No, no,
said Mr A I want my work for my money
Mr WI&C said, that rather than embarrass the bill, he would
withdraw bis amendment and fie withdrew it accordingly
Mr W would simply observe thatgentlemen would find m the
reports of the Secreiaiy of the Navy and of the Navy Corn
missioneisthe necessity ofbuch a squadron fully set forth, and
also estimates showing that £759 OuO would be lequisitetopro
vide font He explained fuither, that when he had a few days
since moved to take up the bill, be had been ordered to do so
by the Committee on Naval AtTaire
After ¡some furthei remarks lrom Mr ADAMS,
