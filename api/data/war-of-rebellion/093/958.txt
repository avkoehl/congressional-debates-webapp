deciding. He cannot reach here before Tuesday at best. The rebel dispatch captured yesterday by Hatch indicates that Forrest is to commence his advance to-morrow. I had hoped that Smith would be here before the time you name. The time may be too long to leave a small garrison at this place.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.

PULASKI, November 20, 1864.

Major-General THOMAS,

Nashville:

I have just received your dispatch asking if I had seen a copy of one from General Hatch of 8 p.m. yesterday. I did see it this morning, and telegraphed you on the subject then, and twice since. I do not understand why it should take us all day to communicate between this point and Nashville. I have heard nothing further from General Hatch. Captain Strong, Eighth Michigan Cavalry, at Lawrenceburg, had heard nothing of Forrest's advance this morning. Colonel Capron was at Waynesborough on the 18th; drove out a small force of the enemy.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.
