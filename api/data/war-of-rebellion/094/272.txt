The artillery firing in the direction of Columbia. No report form it yet. Get your troops across Harpeth and attempt to come no farther to-day, but leave the road clear for General Wilson's trains.

Harpeth is rising very fast, and I am apprehensive the trestle may be washed away. Where are the pontoons? I think they should be sent down by rail and laid as soon as possible, if they have not already been sent by wagon.
