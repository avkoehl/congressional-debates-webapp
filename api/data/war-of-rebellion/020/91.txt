On the afternoon of the 15th instant I was informed by Colonel T. G. Lamar, First Artillery, that from his observation of the movements of the enemy he was convinced that Secessionville would doubtless be attacked either on that night or on the morning of the 16th. I directed him, to hold his position; that he would be re-enforced if necessary. At 2 o'clock on the morning of the 16th instant I received a note from him informing me that the enemy were advancing. I repaired to Clarke's house as soon as possible, where I arrived at 4.15 a. m., when I found Colonel Johnson Hagood, First South Carolina Volunteers, had, in his untiring vigilance, ordered three regiments to be in readiness for an immediate attack, and had already sent a detachment of Colonel Goodlett's regiment to the support of Colonel Lamar, watching closely the movements of the enemy in front of Secessionville. I determined to re-enforce the place to 2,000 strong, and immediately ordered the Fourth Louisiana Battalion and Colonel Goodlett's regiment to repair at double-quick and report to Colonel Lamar at Secessionville. Lieutenant-Colonel McEnery with his battalion arrived just in time to receive the second assault of the enemy and to materially aid i repulsing him. At this time I received a message from Colonel Hagood that the enemy were approaching on our right, and asking re-enforcement. I directed him to attack the enemy, and immediately ordered the Fifty-first Georgia and Colonel Williams' regiment to repair to his assistance.

The engagement now became general on both wings. Colonel C. H. Stevens, who was with Colonel Hagood, seeing that the 24-pounder battery near Clarke's house was not being fired, directed Lieutenant-Colonel Capers, of his regiment, to take command of his battery and to fire on the enemy, with which, though one piece was dismounted, he did gallant and effective service, firing constantly into the flank of the enemy. On the third assault of the enemy Lieutenant-Colonel Capers was very successful with his p[ice, piercing the columns of the enemy eleven times.

For the details of the gallant defense of the works at Secessionville I would respectfully refer the major-general commanding to the official reports of the immediate commanders, herewith submitted. Three times did that heroic band repulse (often at the point of the bayonet) a force thrice their strength, under the fire of their gunboats and four stationary or land batteries.

About 10 o'clock the enemy retreated in great confusion, leaving their dead and wounded on the field, a number lying in our trenches. The loss of the enemy I have been unable to ascertain, but front what I saw was at least 400 in killed, wounded, and prisoners. The dead I directed to be immediately buried and the wounded to be removed to the hospital. A considerable number of arms and accouterments were captured, a partial return of which will be found in the paper marked G.* A full report of these arms I directed Captain McCreery, ordnance officer, to make to the chief of ordnance in Charleston.

At 12 m. I received note from the major-general commanding that he was at Brigadier-General Gist's headquarters, asking if I wished re-enforcement; that they were ready. I replied through my aide-de-camp that I thought the enemy was leaving his position, as he was burning the houses he had first occupied. I then joined the major-general
