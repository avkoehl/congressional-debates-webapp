dians at work in Nevada, and that fact does not
exist with regard to any other Indians. A larger
proportion of the Indians in Nevada labor
than of all other Indians in the United States.
The reason is that we have not demoralized
thetn by feeding them extravagantly and draw-
ing largely upon the Treasury. I have opposed
from the beginning the idea of making treaties
with them, and the result is that they have
learned to take care of themselves; and that
is the theory of our Government, that every
man shall work for himself and have the pro-
tection of the law.
I object to diminishingthe number of super-
intendents, and when the number is arranged I
want to have it distinctly stated that there shall
be a superintendent for Nevada, because we
want a man who is opposed .to having large
appropriations. The first thin<* you know, if
the Indians there are placed under some for-
eign superintendent, there will be a demand
for a large appropriation, and,those Indians
will be fed and taught to believe that they can
live without labor, and we shall have them all
dying off. Now they are taking care of them-
selves and we have a public sentiment that
protects the Indians and treats them kindly.
I want a superintendent for them, a man who
will not come here all the time asking for large
appropriations. The name of one was sent in
from Kansas to go to Nevada. I am afraid
of him, because Kansas has been in the habit
of having large appropriations.
Mr. POMEROY. Nobody from Kansas has
been nominated for Indian superintendent of
Nevada. The one nominated as superin-
tendent from Kansas has gone to Dakota, not
to Nevada.
Mr. RAMSEY. Would a motion to adjourn
be in order?
The VICE PRESIDENT. It would be.
Mr. STEWART. I shall not take a moment
longer.
Mr. RAMSEY. I withdraw the motion.
The VICE PRESIDENT. This amend-
ment will be reserved. If the Senator from
Nevada desires to move an amendment for a
superintendent in Nevada, he will have to
move the amendment after the committee's
amendments are agreed to.
Mr. Sl'EWART. I am willing that this
number shall be cut down if we are allowed to
have one of the eight. I will offer an amend-
ment. to-morrow to give Nevada one of the
eight superintendents.

ten dollars for each Indian roaming:, as per same
article, a sum ndt exceeding 35,000.
Mr. POMEROY. I do not know why the
committee should strike out the words "one
thousand souls." Is it because they think
these Indians have no souls? [Laughter.]

Mr. POMEROY. The appropriation for
the Kickapoo tribe of Indians comes next,
and I have received an amendment from the
department which I suppose ought to be in-
serted at the end of line six hundred and
ninety-two, on page 20. It relates to a treaty.
A treaty was made with the Kickapoos giving
certain privileges to males being heads of fam-
ilies. The Commissioner of Indian Affairs
said there were heads of families, widows who
had children, who were not males, and he wanted
this amendment inserted:
That the President of the United States is author-
ized to execute the provisions of the third article of
the treaty concluded with the Kickapoo tribe of
Indians June 28,1862, without restricting the sam 
to adult males being heads of families.
If the Committee on Indian Affairs make
any objection to this amendment to-morrow
we can have another vote upon it.
The VICE PRESIDENT. These bills will
not probably be taken up to-morrow, as the
Senate has already set aside that day for the
consideration of reports from three commit-
tees.
Mr. POMEROY. The amendment does
not make any appropriation. It simply re-
lates to the maimer of administering upon a
treaty.
The VICE PRESIDENT. Does tbe Sena-
tor from California object to this amendment?
Mr. COLE. I could not hear the amend-
ment read ; but I ask the Senator to waive it
for the present.
Mr. POMEROY. Very well.
Mr. COLE. Probably the Committee on
Indian Affairs will make some proposition in
regard to those Indians.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The chairman
of the Committee on Indian Affairs is not
present to-night, and action to-night is simply
on amendments reported by the Committee on
Appropriations.
Mr. POMEROY. I will reserve the amend-
ment for the present.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Secretary
will continue the reading of the amendments
of the Committee on Appropriations.
The next a mendment reported by the Com-
mittee on Appropriations was on page 34, in

teen and insert "$10,000;" so as to read,
