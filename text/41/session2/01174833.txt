Mr. STOCKTON". I move to postpone.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senatorfrom
New Jersey moves to postpone the present and
all other orders, for the purpose of continuing
the consideration of the joint resolution in re-
gard to Cuba.
Mr. CONKLING. May I inquire of the
Senator from New Jersey if his purpose is
merely to enable the Senator from California
to conclude his remarks?
Mr. STOCKTON. Certainly. I have no
other purpose in the world.
Mr. CONKLING. Now, may I ask the hon-
orable Senator whether there is any exigency
attending the conclusion of those remarks to-
day ?
Mr. STOCKTON. I will answer the Senator
that yesterday morning the Senator from Cal-
ifornia attempted to address the Senate on this
subject, but was interrupted and cut off by
the expiration of the morning hour. He com-
menced this morning, and was interrupted four
or five timesby gentlemen, untilhereceivedall
sorts of questions in the middle of his speech ;
and just as he was in a happy train of argument,
as his friends hoped,and was progressing nicely,
the morning hourexpired, and hesimply asks the
courtesy of beitigallowed to finish his remarks.
I do not think the Senate ever refused such a
request under such circumstances.
Mr. CONKLING. We all know that the
Senator from California was in a happy mood,
as he always is, and will be so if a future occa-
sion is allowed to him; but may I ask the
Senator how much time the Senator from Cali-
fornia wishes for the conclusion of his obser-
vations?
Mr. CASSERLY. I shall not want much ;
but I decline to speak under the mere permis-
sion of the Senator from New York.
Mr. CONKLING. The Senator will have
no objection I suppose to indicating some limit
of time that will be ample. He need not use
it all unless he chooses.
Mr. THURMAN. May I be permitted to
ask whether or not everything is to be post-
poned for this measure, which is brought in
here at the end of eighty-one years since this
Government, went into existence, and sought
to be forced through here on this day? Does
the Senator from New York really suppose he
can force this bill through here this day? If
he does, he is the most mistaken man that
ever was on this floor.
Mr. CONKLING. Mr. President, I think
the Senate should see pretty clearly now that
there is something more in this than a mere
matter of courtesy to the Senator from Califor-
nia. Now, I propose, without any discourtesy
to that Senator or to any other Senator, to see
whether a majority of this body will stand by
a measure to reform the naturalization laws,
and we can all postpone together our remarks
on the Cuban question if a majority of the body
will proceed with this bill. Therefore, I insist
upon it. Let us take the question.
Mr. STOCKTON. The Senator from New
York inquired of me whether I had any other
object in view but to allow the Senator from
California to finish his remarks. I replied to
him certainly not; that I had no other motive.
Under those circumstances I think he has no
right to rise in this body and attribute-
Mr. CONKLING. My honorable friend from
New Jersey quite misapprehends me. I did
not allude to him ; I alluded to the remarks of
the Senator from Ohio about a measure that
has been brought in here at the end of the ses-
sion, after eighty-one years of the existence of
the Government. AVe see now that friendli-
ness to this bill does not go hand in hand with
the motion to postpone. That is what I meant
to say.
Mr. THURMAN. The Senator had just as
little right to attribute any such motive to me.
What 1 object to is that the Senator seems to
assume that he has a right to make everything
subordinate to this favorite pet measure of his,
41st Cong. 2d Se$s.â€”Ko. 303.
brought in here now after eighty-one years. I
deny that.
Mr. CONKLING. Well, Mr. President, I
only assume, against the Senator and bis party,
that I have the right, if I can find votes enough
in this Chamber, to put the heel of legislation
upon frauds and outrages which turn popular
elections in this country into a farce. I as-
sume that, and I will see whether the vote of
the Senate will justify me in my assumption.
Mr. THURMAN. Well, we shall see.
Mr. CASSERLY. Mr. President, it is proper,
after this untoward controversy has arisen, pro-
voked entirely by the Senatorfrom New York,
that I should say for myself that while I have
a very fixed opinion about his bill and the ob-
ject of bringing it forward at this time, I was
not even thinking of it; my mind was entirely
full of the subject upon which I was speaking ;
and I should deem myself a very unworthy
member of this body if, under the guise of
seeking to terminate my remarks on one meas-
ure, I was really practicing for some delay
against some other measure to which I was
opposed. That is all I have to say on that sub-
