repulsed. We held the bridge until relieved by the infantry under General Blair in the afternoon of the following day, when we moved to Galss' Bridge below Lovejoy's Station, repaired the bridge, which had been burned by the enemy, crossed, and maintained our position upon the opposite side for two days, constantly annoying the enemy's flank and rear, repulsing with loss every attack he made, and formed a junction with the right of the infantry of the Army of the Tennessee near Lovejoy's Station, September 3; we remained in this position until 11 o'clock September 5, and then moved back, first to Anthony's Bridge, then to Red Oak, and finally to Sandtown, having covered the rear and flank of the Army of the Tennessee in its retrograde movement from Lovejoy's Station to its present position.

Accompanying this report will be found a tabulated list of the casualties of this command during the campaign, as well as of prisoners and property captured.

Before closing my report, I desire to assure the chief of cavalry that the officers and men of my command have endeavored to zealously and faithfully discharge every duty assigned them, and I only hope that he and those my seniors in rank are as well satisfied with my conduct and operations as I am with the efforts of my command.

Respectfully submitted.
