If there is any sincerity in the boasted pur-
pose to relieve the people and'unburden their '
industrial capacities by reductions in the rates .
of taxes, why is it not made manifest by some
offer to reduce the duties on some of those
vitally important commodities, such as iron,
steel, lumber, and leather, which are chiefly or
in great part produced in this ccmtitry, and the
cost of which, in all their multifarious forms of
usefulness is vastly and cpnstantly augmented
to the consumers by the duties, without paying
to the Treasury any equivalent or considerable
revenue, and whose chief effect is to swell
indefinitely the gains of the monopolists or
favored classes at the expense of the people
and of the general prosperity of the coun-
try ?
Let me point out n few evidences of the
gross inconsistency and partiality of this bill
in these respects. The steel and iron manu-
facturers of the eouutry are more prosperous
to-day than the great majority of men engaged
in other legitimate industries, except some law-
protected monopolies like the national banks.
In the session of Congress of 18G0-G7 tho Com-
mittee of Ways' and Means was solemnly as-
sured by tho steelmakers over their own names
that, the present duties were sufficient to insure
their prosperity, and were "well adapted to
the condilion of tho steel manufacture in this
country." All men except protectionists then
considered them oppressively high, becauso
on some varieties of steel they were equal to
more than 100 per cent, of their cost. Since
then the internal revenue tax, equal ut one
time to two cents per pound, has been wholly
removed, which is equivalent to tho samo
amount of protixilon to tho domestic manu-
facturer. xet these same steelmakers now de-
mand very largely increased duties on imported
steel, and the committee have granted their
demand. Tho following statement will show
tho present rate of duty, the rate proposed to
be established, and the percentage of the pro-
posed increase of duty by the present, hill:

All these articles are raw materials of the
most indispensable and universal use, and
whatever aggravates their cost, is a direct bur-
den upon almost every form of industry, labor,
and production in our country, the extent of

which, in all the ramifications of business it
is impossible to estimate. Steel rails, for
example, are rapidly becoming vitally import-
ant in the construction of our railroads. About
550 miles of them were laid down in this coun-
try in 1869. Under the present tariff, which
is 4-5 per cent, ad valorem, the direct charge
to the railroads with gold at 120, would be
$1,050,000. But under the proposed increase
of 2 cents per pound, it would be $2,970,800,
equal to 80 per cent, of their cost.
On street railway frogs, fish-bars, and frog-
points the present duty is 45 per cent., or about
$80 per ton, «,«<! the proposed duty is 3J cents
per pound, or $72 80 per ton, being 142 per
cent, increase. The present duty on ingot steel
is 2£ cents per pound, or $50 40 per ton, and
the proposed duty is 3.\- cents per pound, equal
to $72 80 per tori, or near GO per cent, of cost.
The present duty 011 billets of steel is 30 per
cent., equal to $13 per ton. This it is pro-
posed to raise to 8J- cents per pound, equal to
$72 80 per ton, or 460 per cent, increase. This
is simply spoliation and robbery. It is an
unjustifiable outrage thus to plunder from every
industry in the counlry, from every farmer,
mechanic, and laborer, in order to gratify tho
grasping cupidity of a few steel-makers in
Pennsylvania.
STEEI. RAILS AND 1UU.KO.IDS.
Mr. Chairman, it is a very significant fact,
and an alarming evidence of the progress of
tariff consolidation, and of the supremacy of
selfishness, that tho same steelmakers, build-
ers and owners of railroads, and consumers of
steel rails, who three years apo demanded a
reduction of the t.iritl'on the latter article, now
present a memorial to the Committee of Ways
mid Means, asking a very large increase of
that, duty. This memorial is conceived in the
interests of monopoly, of combined and con-
solidated monopoly, in Pennsylvania chiefly,
and is executed entirely by railroad men, at
whose head stand the names of most of the
railroad kings of that State. It may well be
inquired, why this change of front by these
men? Have they become interested as manu-
facturers of steel and steel rails, and therefore
anxious to increase their cost in order to en
rich themselves and the rings of railroad men
who will control the business, at the great
expense of the whole country and even of the
innoccnt holders of stock in their own roads?
Have they concluded that they will thus enable
themselves to make steel rails cheap for their
own roads '? And by an absolute monopoly of
their manufacture, to dictate tho price to all
other roads, to all Western and Southern roads,
so that 110 railroads in the country shall have
tho advantage of cheapened construction ?
I think these inquiries fairly indicate the
motive of this change. This memorial discloses
a wicked conspiracy among several of the most
powerful corporations in the country to oppress
and injure one of its most vital interests. What-
ever retards the construction and extension, or
aggravates tho cost of railroads, adds directly
to the burdens of industry, of production, of
commerce, and is equivalent to a direct, un-
just, and covert tax 011 every bushel of wheat,
or pound of agricultural products, or ton of
any kind of freight which needs to be trans-
ported by rail to market. A few facts will
make these considerations more striking.
Jt was not until I860 that any considerable
amount of freight was transported over rail-
roads. In 184!) their receipts for transporta-
tion were only $20,000,000. In 180!) they were
$280,000,000. The increase in freights carried
was probably in double this ratio, as charges
in 1849 were twice greater than they now are.
The tonnage transported by rail last year ex-
ceeded 100,000,000 tons, worth in the aggre-
gate, at a low estimate, $10,000,000,000. Kail-
roads have added annually to the internal
commerce of the country at least S500,000,000,
and still more to the value of its products. Yet
these wonderful achievements are the growth
Of only about twenty years. During the last
year near 5,000 miles of new line were built,
atacost of about $150,000,000, opening thereby
to market a territory of near 100,000 square
■miles. In view of these facts does any interest
in our couaafcry more imperatively demand, or
more richly deserve protection against oppres-
sion and unjust exactions ?
But it may be well also to know that these
roads made in last year consumed in construe-
tion over 500,000 tons pf rails,, ,two thirds of
which were supplied by domestic mills. Be-
sides the roads in operation required for tjieir
maintenance in the same year, fully 400,000
tons more, the most of which was supplied by
the same mills. The value of the home pro-
duct of rails for the same time was about
$45,000,000. It should also be remembered
that the iron and steel that enter into the con-
struction of railroads is inconsiderable, com-
pared with the vast quantities for which they
immediately create a demand. The domestic
iron maker can calculate with great certainty
that where one ton of iron or steel rails are
used, the consumption of three tons for other
purposes will be the necessary consequence.
He should, therefore, be the first person to
throw off all burdens upon the construction or
maintenance of railroads as the most effective
means" of developing his own interests. A
most competent authority states that—
"Tho charges of transportation on our railroads,
tho past year, equaled almost 2# cents per ton and
l>er passenger per mile. The total cost of operating
all our roads equaled $280,000,000. A reduction oi a
quarterof a cent, per mile, consequently, would effect
a saving of $26,000,000. At, cents per mile, thccost
of transporting a ton of wheat from the Mississippi
rivor to Now York, or Boston, will equal $30, or very
nearly SI per bushel. This fact explains the reason
why wheat is selling at 50 cents per bushel in Iowa,
and $1 50 upon the seaboard. Twice its price where
UisKiown is now consumed in its transportation.
Tho great problem, therefore, now before our people
is tho reduction in tho cost of movement."
* % I • «=. <• X tjs * *
"Where the English railways pay $29 per ton for
rails, we pay $59 in gold. Whore the former pays
$49 for steel rails, wo pay from $85 to $90. Upon other
items of cost there is a similar disproportion. Charges
of transportation in England represent co.st, and
nothing more. They should represent cost in thjs
country, and nothing more. Just as we increase
cost of transportation we reduce the volume, and
restrict the area of tho business of our railroads. .If
the charges of transportation could be reduced to
It cent per ton or per passenger per mile, the sav-
ins in a single year would equal $140,000,000, a sum
largor by $20,000,000 than the intereslon the national
debt. Economies, we know, are of slow growth; but
we can at onco commence by reducing the cost of
mateiial and by substituting good forbad. The first
step is tho use of steel rails. Iron is utterly inade-
quate to the high speed and heavy trains now used.
With a revenue tariff steel would be within the reach
of our poorest lines. The first great step to a reduc-
tion of cost would then be taken, to be followed up
by other reforms, which would continue till the low-
est limit of cost of transportation was reached. While
the railroads would, in fact, he equally remunerative,
the saving effected to be divided among our pro-
ducers and consumers would, in time, be counted by
hundreds of millions/'
Butihose impositions upon liberty and labor,
trade and commerce, are not accomplished by
individuals acting alone or separately. They
are always the offspring of combinations.
The cunning strategists of protection keenly
appreciate the power of Union. They consol-
idate their power with consummate skill.
They appeal to the cupidity of classes and
concentrate the tremendous influence of cap-
ital. This truth is illustrated in every part of
our tariff system. It is manifest in this bill.
Look at the propositions in this bill to raise,
certain duties above their present monstrous
rates and see how many interests are to be
served \ii the result and how well tite inereased
tribute is to be distributed among the favored
classes. If I had time it would be easy to
arrange the different propositions in this bill
m juxtaposition so as to make- this truth very
impressive, but time forbids me'to do it now.
In the face of a present excess of annual reve-
nues over expenditures of near $100,000,000,
and of the present enormous prices of these
articles in our country, the following increased
duties are proposed by the committee s
