THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
January 23,
numerate the Government for the expense it has
incurred in feeding them?
Mr. DUNN. I have not been a frequenter of
Duff*Green's Row, and therefore cannot answer
thequestion. [Laughter.] Iwithdrawmyamend-
ment.
Mr. COX. I move to amend the amendment
of my colleague by striking out the last word of
the section.
Mr. Chairman, I have no wish to enter into
this debate in the spirit in which it seems to have
been indulged. The gentleman from New York
[Mr. Oli\t] finds fault with my colleague, [Mr.
White,] who sits on my right, for what he has
said to the committee. He called it "rant and
fustian," when he stated facts and laid down a
principle which cannot be and lias not been con-
troverted.
I do not understand the gentleman from Indiana
to claim that any payment of money for the sup-
port of contrabands was either legal or constitu-
tional. i wish to know if I understood the gen-
tleman correctly. I ask the gentleman whether
he maintains before this House that any payment
of money by the Government for the support of
these ne<rroes is in accordance with law?
Mr. DUNN. In reply to the gentleman's ques-
tion, I have to say that if negroes are employed
by the Government, they are entitled to compen-
sation for their services as well as white persons.
I do not think the Government has any right to
donate money to them merely aa chaiity, and I
do not understand that they have done any such
thing.
Mr. COX. Now, Mr. Chairman, the proposi-
tion of my friend from Indiana was this. Here-
marked a while ago that there was 110 law for the
appropriation of money to these people. Now he
says that if they are employed they are entitled
to compensation. Let mg ask him to show me
the law for employing these contrabands and pay-
ing them anything, or for supporting them.
Mr. McPHISRSON. It'the gentleman will al-
low me 1 will show him the law.
Mr. COX, I cannot yield to the gentleman just
now. The gentleman says that the public mind
in the West has been poisoned !>y the gentleman
from Kentucky, [Mr. VVicki.ikfi:.] Mr. Chair-
man, if there has been any poisoning of the pub-
lic mind on this subject, it has been'by the other
side of the House, who have persistently and con-
sistently voted down every ett'ort made upon this
side of the House to obtain infoimation upon this
subject.
Mr. DUNN. I did not.
Mr. COX. I know you did not, but your side
of the Housedid. Hut when (he gentleman fmm
Indiana [Mr. Dunn] offers a resolution to accom-
plish the same object, >t is adopted ncmine conh-a-
dicente. Everybody favoied it; although when the
same proposition was made on thts'side of the
House, neatly everybody 011 the other stdi voted
against it. Well, sir, I think the Depaitmeni
might as well tell the truth when asked by gen-
tlemen on this side of the House as when th'e gen-
tleman from Indiana propounds the same inter-
rogatories, which I proposed in the last session,
and which were voted down by the House.
Why, sir, another resolution was introduced
the other day by my friend from Maryland [Mr.
CaivbrtJ hi front of me. 1 charged upon this
floor, upon the statement made by him to me, that
sixty negroes at Hilton Head, South Carolina,
cost this Government, as appears riom the repoi t
ot a quartermaster of that department, the sum of
$35,000 per month; but when 1 cailed for inform-
ation upon that subject, the resolution was voted
down.
The gentleman talks about poisoning the public
mind! Lot the facts come out. I know thatthoy
are coming at this late day. Gentlemen :it the
last 6>*\«sio!i had an opportunity of ^ivm^the an-
tidote wi:li the poison, but they would not do u.
Why.' I do not believe that the tacts are truly re-
lated by fhe Government, nor that the statement
of the gentleman from New York [Mr. Olijc] will
turn out to be correct. Wo do know that the
most exorbitant pnd prodigal expenditures are
roadp for ihis useless business, and, ay my col-
league [Mr. White] remarked, without law and
against the Constitution. If the gentleman from
Pennsylvania [Mr. McPhersojtJ can show mo
the law, I should be glad to hear it now.
There is aftQther stated by my friend from
Ohio, who is alleged as having uttered 44 lant and
fustian." Unpleasant facts may be considered in
that category, at this time, by gentlemen on tSie
other side of the House. There is no waruuu m
the Constitution by which we arc authorized to
tax our people to nay for negroes of Missouri,
or Texas, or anywhere else. Show me that war-
rant when you are looking up the law and the Con-
stitution. The people of Ohio and of the West—
if they decided anything in the last election—
decided that they would not be burdened with
taxation for any such purpose. ^
[Here the hammer fell ]
Mr. McPHERSON. Let me read the law on
the subject to winch reference is made. The
twelfth section of that law is as follows:
" That the President be and he is authorized to receive
into the seivice of the United State*, for the purpose of
constructing mti enchment^, or performing camp sei vice, or
any othei labor, or any military or naval seivice, Soi winch
they may be competent, person* of Afuoan descent; and
such poisons shall be enrolled and organized under smci)
legulations, riot inconsistent with The Constitution and
laws, as the President may piescribc.'1
Mr. COX. What is the date of that law?
Mr. MrPHERSON. July 17, 1362
Mr. COX. Then it was passed in liie last days
of the last session.
Mr. McPHER.SON. I will read also the fif-
teenth section of that law. It is as follows:
"That all persons who have been or shall be heieafter
emolled in the service ol ihe United .States iindei fhi< act,
shall rofeive the p-ty and l at ions rnnv aliowou by law to «oi
diers nocoidm^ to then respective guides : Piovtdc.l. Tli.u
peisons of AfiHMii difcent who. under this law.-hall be
employed, -hall teeeiw ten dollats pci month and one la-
tum ; thtee dollars of which month!} pa} ntaj be in cloth-
ing."
Mr. Chairman, I take it, that section gave the
| President full power to receive into the service of
the United States persons of African descent; to
employ them for the purpose of digging or per-
forming camp duty, or any oilier labor, or any
military or naval seivice.
M'-. VVICKLlFUltl. I wish to make an in-
quiry of the gentleman from Pennsylvania. Are
the children and women of Afucan de^-mt, the
sick and young negroes, now m the city of \V ash-
mgion, employed in the military or naval service
of the (Juiied States ? [Laughter.]
Mr. McPlIERMON. i cannot answer the gen-
tleman from Kentucky. That is a class of ttio
population of Washington with whom I am not
familiar. I am not aware that there are any such
people m this town us are intended to be alluded
to by the gentleman from Kentucky. I
I know nothing of the particular facts of which j
gentiomen complain. I do not know how many
contrabands theie are upon the mast of South
Carolina who have been abandoned by their u bel
masters, and left there withoutany means of sup-
port. Their industry the Government may have
attempted to control for the benefit of the military
ai m ot the service, or in the general service. 1 sup-
pose that, whexi Unofficial reports, are made, it
will be demonstrated that, as far as practicable,
this class of population have be<. n mudc to sub-
serve some useful purpose. Gentlemen must see
that our military commanders in the southern
►States, having this largo population upon them,
may be embarrassed respecting the proper man-
agement, They ore within our lines. You cannot
turn them out. You cannot drive them into the
ocean. You cannot send them into the enemy's
lines, tor the legisiauon of the rtbid States shows
j that 'hey are ustn^ n^roes for building in-
trencinnentf, and oieer military purposes. The
larger number ofncjnicN you put iruo their hands,
the more you add to the;;- resources for carrying
oo this war. I hope there is no one here who
would justify n commander m driving these ne-
.<ra>es fr^m our lines into the enemy'^. If not,
they ivi.u '>0 m some way to benefit the Gov-
ernnieot: and this, 1 uhd^rstind. has been done,
j Kere the luimnvrftli. t
Mr. HORTOiN. j move that the committee rise
tor the purpose of closing debate on this section.
The motion was agreed to.
So the committee U'bo: and the Speaker having
resumed the chair. Mi, Pike reported that the
Committee of the Whole on the state of the Union
had, according to order, had the Union gener-
aily juider consideration, and particularly House ■
bill Ko. 659, to provide ways and means for the
support of the Government, and had corne to no
conclusion thereon.
Mr. IJOHTOjN' moved that the debate in the
Committee of the Whole on tho state of tho Union
on the pending section of the bill be-lot^ it he
closed in one minute after its consideration shall
be resumed.
The motion was agreed to.
Mr. HORTO.N moved that the rules be sus-
pended, and the House resolve itself in to the Com-
mittee of the Whole on the state of the Union.
The motion was agreed to.
So the rules were suspended; and the House re-
solved itself into the Committee of the Whole on
the state of the Union, (Mr. Pike in the chair,)
and resumed the consideration of the bill of the
House (No. 659) to provide ways and means for
the support of the Government.
Mr. COX. i move to strike out the last word
of the section, for the purpose of occupying the
one minute to which debate has been limited.
The gentleman fiom Pennsylvania quoted a law
here for tin: payment of these contrabands. I
want it understood that that law was passed in the
last hours of the session.
[Here the hammer felL]
The amendment of Mr. White, of Ohio, was
reje< ted; there beintj—ayes 29, noes 72.
