THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
Jan. ¿7,
and in sentiment, as they were at the time when I1
at the polls they instructed me      Shall  1, then, |
when possessed of the unchanged ev dence of my   I
distiict upon tl is bubjec!, t rn traitor to the trust [
confided to me'  SI all I disappoint the wis! es of |
amaj nty of some eigntoi ten tho> sand votéis, to j
g-ati y a meeting called by some seven hundred    |
And that meeting eomp o ed, too, mainly of my  |
opponents' for m the whole catalogue of names
which appeal upon the papei calling this, meeting,
I only recogniz1 the names of some hah a dozen
who  supported  me     Sir, I would   be   íecreant
to that trust, aposta'e to those principles which I
avowed should ever govern me, and a craven cul
put at the forum of my own conscience, it 1 were
now to act in obedience to their in  ructions     !
never can, then, and never will give   i vote by
which 1 s mil a d d lectly or aidneclly the powei ¡
orpeipetuity ofthismosiodiousinstiiu ion   Why, j
sir, you hive, i i the language of tl is meim nal, I
no hiug moie toan a iaiieiaiion of the same Ccl la
cíes which weie employed by the signers to defeat
my election      Tne issue, sir, between the bmk
and the country wis faiily and fully tiled a yeai
ago     Ajiryol the xihole diJuc1 sat in judgment
upon them, and by a Urge maj irity of more than
six hundred cf the panel I hau a veidm against
the bank      Si,  the  judgment was a rghteous
one, and no aid of mine shall ever be given to
reveise it
I have said, sn, that the memorialists weie of
the most elevated and respectable character—m
dividuals towards whom 1 entertain a high per
eonaliegard, but who lost no opportunity that their
wealth, the r talents, their   big1*   s adding, their
long lesidence among the people, oi tneir until in?
industry cotU effect to deteu my election, in vn
tue of all these auxiliaries, and upon the \ tiy pun
ciple which gave bitLh to tins me noi tl     As !
could not compromise ther,I will scuicciy uecom
nodate them now
But is itnot stiange,and worthy of some notice,
Mr   S[ callea , that  several ot   the moot efic ent
manageis of   this meeting vveie men who ha\ e,
thiough a long life, been attached toa put/ which
hasever ienied the whole do'Hrine of i isti   ^ ion —
staunch I ederahsts, wiio h tve mtdeih  -epiesent

now, for the fust time, come foiwud as cot veils
to the old  republican doct me of tepieseiitative ¡
amenabi'ity, and apply, or  u enpt ti   ipply, to .
me the i newly adopte I principle, and on an oc- '
easion when it is most smgulaily inapphoal le?
Why, sir, if 1 had ne\er h°aid of my co istitu   I
ents since my election, tne very name  on that
paper would be enough to satisfy me (I mean the
gieat body of  them) that those who supported
me then weie opposed at this time  o the vie vs of
the memonalists
It is on'y by elections, Mr Speakei, that a pei
feet expression of the popular will can evet  be
obtained    The worthy gen lemen who beie claim

at the expense of what Í humbly conceive to be
every principle of constitutional hbeity, had an

they did make t! is effort, and it they failed, God I

the r  hip standing  in the community affoided
them to carry these points in their exertions to

rash to pie ge the House by such a íesolution,

resol ation requi ed merely an inquiry concerning
the sa'e, if wuuid not be obnoxious to his objec-
