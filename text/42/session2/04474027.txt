Dad the presidential election been close, the
votes of these States might have elected a Pres-
ident and Vice President pledged to the decla-
ration that the reconstruction laws of Congress
■were unconstitutional, revolutionary, and void,
and to the policy of overthrowing the recon-
structed State governments.
Not only was the Republican vote reduced,
but Republicans were compelled to vote the
Democratic ticket; and in the States of North
Carolina, Texas, Tennessee, South Carolina,
Georgia, and Louisiana, if you compare suc-
cessive elections, you will find that the Ku
Klux Klan changed 230,445 votes.
In North Carolina, in 1868, Holden carried
the State by 18,641; in the fall, Grant's ma-
jority was only 12,136; loss from spring of
6,505. In 1870 the Democrats carried the
State by 4,088; loss from State election of
1868, 23,729.
In Texas, in 1869, the lowest Republican
majority for State officers was 11,579. In
1871 on the vote for Congressmen, including
rejected votes, it was 24,270 ; loss 35,858.
In Tennessee, in the spring, the majority for
Brownlow over Etheridge was 51,936 ; i:i the
fall the majority for Grant and Colfax was
30,446; change, 21,490.
In South Carolina in the spring the majority
forthe new constitution was 43,470; in the fall
the majority for Grant and Colfax was 17,064 ;
change, 26,406.
In Georgia the majority in the spring for
Bullock was 7,047 ; in the fall the majority for
Seymour and Blair over Grant and Colfax was
45,688; a change of 52,135 votes.
In Louisiana, in the spring, the majority for
Warmoth over all others was 23,265 ; in the
fall the majority for Seymour and Blair over
Grant and Colfax was 56,952 ; a change of
70,227 votes.
The total change in four States from the
spring of 1868 to the presidential election of
that year was 230,445 votes, representing more
than a million and a half of people.
Certainly this is the tnost powerful political
organization ever devised by man or fiend.
Here is a table showing the result in the
State of Georgia, where in twenty-five coun-
ties the Republican vote was reduced, from
spring to fall, from Bullock to Grant, over
fourteen thousand. In eight of these counties,
in some of which the Republicans had a major-
ity , Grant received not a single vote:

" Her" was n change, from spring to fall of 1868, in
nineteen parishes, of 50.966 votes ; and then in lb.0,
the next elei-iion, they change back. Whoever
-wain's t" consider the e.m^cs which bavp piouuood
this political phenomenon will find them fully feet
forth in the te>nroony taken by the committee ot
the U.-Uf.c of Itcpi'OM-.itdUvcs luveatisahus the mat-
ter in Luui.;i;Ton ill 1S1.9- Oo pages 161 and lbi % o -
ume two. of the testimony, the So,lowing tables
appear, showing the number ot outrages committed
on Republicans in that tetate between the spring
election and the presidential election ol Ms, pim
cipally within a few weeks of the presidential elec-
tion."
The means used to produce this result are
shown by a table exhibiting the number ot
outrages committed in Louisiana prior to elec-
tions in 1868, eighteen hundred and eighty-
seven in a single State.
Among the excuses made by those who con-
tfol and defend this organization is that they
feared the negroes; yet General Gordon and
all southern men of intelligence testify that
the negroes of the South have behaved better
than any other people ever did under the same
circumstances. General Gordon says:
" Question. Have the negroes, as a general thing,
behaved well since the war?
" Answer. They have behaved so -well that the re-
mark is not uncommon in Georgia that no race on
earth, relieved from servitude under such circum-
stances as they were, would have behaved so well.'
They pretend that the Government of the
United States has oppressed them, yet that
Government, to which they had forfeited prop-
erty, liberty, life, spared their lives, allowed
them their liberty, and returned them their
property. No confiscated property is with-
held from its owners, although some abandoned
property was taken ; yet the only estate remain-
ing in the hands of the Government is Arling-
ton, and there are gentlemen in both Houses of
Congress anxious to remove the remains of
our soldiers and give the cemetery back to its
rebel owners. No life has been taken for trea-
son. Jefferson Davis is as free as the air, a
citizen of the Republic. Few political rights
are denied, but a few hundred remain tmam-
nestied, and the only issue that can be made
on amnesty is whether the remnant should be
amnestied also. The difference between par-
ties this fall will be whether the Republican
party has been derelict in not restoring to
political power even Jefferson Davis himself.
But, sir, the apologists for the conspiracy-
say that they have been oppressed and robbed
by the reconstructed State governments. Let
us look at this charge for a moment. It is com-
pletely answered by the fact that the conspiracy
was organized long before reconstruction ; but
as it is pretended that this conspiracy was
organized to save property, let us look at the
financial records of the geatlemen who organ-
ized it.
On page 215 of the report of the com-
mittee will be found a statement of the effect of
the rebellion on the property of the South, from
which it appears that, exclusive of slaves, there
was propeity in the rebelling States in 1860
valued by the census at $2,728,000,000. They
went into rebellion and lost their slaves, and
wasted and destroyed $1,272,000,000 worth
of other property. And they piled up a debt
amounting to over twenty-five hundred million
dollars. The rebellion cost these financiers
nearly four thousand million dollars in debt
and property exclusive of slaves, and including
slaves six thousand million dollars. And yet
these same men tell us that they organize treas-
onable conspiracies against the Government
to save money.
What has been the financial result of recon-
struction? The Government and the people
of the North forgave to the people of the
South and caused them to repudiate as debts
more than twenty-five hundred million dollars.
We relieved them by constitutional amend-
ments, and by the generosity of our people, of
debts nearly double the property their own
crimes had left. If the Government and the
people of the North had simply withheld their
hands from the South, and left the conquered
rebels to their own financial devices, the South
would have sunk in bankruptcy and ruin as a
mail thrown into the sea with a millstone about
his neck. The Government and people of the
North rescued them, fed them, advanced money
and property, restored peace and order, and
gave them the opportunity to revive their tor-
tunes.
And what is the result ? The white people ot
the South continually upbraid the colored peo-
ple, saying "The negro will not work." Yet,
wherever you go you see scores of white^ men
lounging on the piazzas of the hotels, shifting
their chairs to keep out of the sun, and moving
only to get "refreshments,"' while fieedmen are
laboring in the fields earning money to er"ak'e
the whites to lounge. The laborers of the
, South have produced in cotton and other agri-
