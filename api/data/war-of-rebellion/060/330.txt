Colonel McCASLIN,

SIR John's Run:

I have ordered General Averell to send a cavalry scout to-morro across by Shanghai and Unger's Store to Bloomery. Keep your scouts on the alert. Don't suffer your command to be surprised. No rebel force in Winchester.

Signal Officer.
HEADQUARTERS FIRST ARMY CORPS,January 3, 1864.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

SIR: I inclose herewith sketch* showing position of the Second Division, together with a note* from General Robinson. I received one last night complaining about the non-establishment of the picket-line, as directed by you, and immediately wrote to General Merritt on the subject. Unless the cavalry can be so posted as to give General Robinson adequate notice of a hostile approach, I should respectfully recommended the withdrawal of the infantry division from Cedar Mountain, as the risk would then counterbalance any advantage to be gained by occupying such position. The cavalry pickets have not advanced beyond Cedar Mountain.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JNO. NEWTON,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS CAVALRY CORPS,January 3, 1864.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: I have the honor to inform you that instructions were yesterday given General Merritt in regard to posting his pickets, as directed. He is ordered to report as soon as the line is established.
