Lieutenant G. WEITZEL,

U. S. Engineers, Chief Engineers Department of the Gulf:

SIR: In compliance with our orders, dated April 30 and May 13, I reported to Col. E. F. Jones, Twenty-sixth Regiment Massachusetts Volunteers, at Fort Jackson, May 6, and have examined the condition of the two forts here, made a list of their ordnance, and given him such assistance in starting repairs as I was able. He will need further instructions from you, as I will explain to you when I see you.

I have the honor to inclose herewith a list of the ordnance of the two forts here, a rough sketch of Fort Jackson, giving the positions of its guns, and also a copy of a letter to Colonel Jones, accompanying a copy of this sketch.
