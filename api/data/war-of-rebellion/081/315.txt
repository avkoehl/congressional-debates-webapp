HEADQUARTERS SIXTH CORPS,June 22, 1864-5.05 p.m.

Major-General MEADE:

The enemy on our left flank continue to press their skirmishers with vigor. I can see some of the cavalry coming back, but some continue to hold on. General Wheaton is in position and making a breast-work. General Wright has sent for a brigade from General Russell.
