Here, then, Mr. Chairman, is my "conjecture"
in regard to the Mate and prospects of the Treasury
for the present year. The committee will judge
what reliance is to be placed upon it. I have given
tttem the «rounds on which I have proceeded in
Tnere was available m the Treasury
on the 1st of January, 1841, accord-
ing to the Secretai y, though it ¡snow
undersiood that the amount is much
Jes.-, the sum of §1,590,655, which
deduct         .           .           .           .1 590,855
Leaving as a charge in the Treasury m
1841, on account of Treasury notes
outstanding on the 1st of Januaty,
over and above any balance in the
Treasury, this sum .           .,          . $2,759,145 i
To this sum of $2,759,145 is to be                     ,
added Ihe balances oí appropriations                     j
made m 1840, and previously, s and-
mg over on the  1st January, 1841,
and wh ch w ill be a charge on tne                     j
Tieaairy   wi h.n   the    jear    1841,                     I
amounting to, though I suppose this,                     I
sum is not enough by §3,002,000    . 10,411,027
Making together          .                        gl¿,170,172
Thus we have $ 13,170,172 chargeable
on  the  Treasury   in   1841, before
making any new appropriations what-
ever for that year.   Aad to this is
now to be aaded the auount of new
and permanent appropna ions to tie
extent to which they will bec-mea
charge on tne Treasury  within the
yea
The es imates of the Secretary for new
ard permanent appropriations aud
ferpuohcdetitamount to f 19,399,200
To this I add for all errors
and omissions, the parti-
culars of which I hive
before explained, es the

I compute at     .            .   8,000,OQO

maliit g these cakalauons L>>t them be impeached
it thfy can be. I do not mean u  cltum. i or ihem
any son oí in allibihty. 1 have made the best use
of the materia s I had, and have endeavored to
come to í onest and just results. I nwy havs fallen
into errors, but t as, 1 will say, that if the Secretary
and his friends ara willing to abidt by his estimates
far the year, I am willing to abite ty mine, and
we will see whose "conjecture" will n.rn out to be
nearest the truib.
I have i o «, Mr. Chairman, one impeachment
mort, an J only ope, to orlar, of the accuiacy of
the haanciat s'atements of the Secretary and the
Present. "Thi-.," says the President, "is .tin
only G)/rnment wh.cb, having mdy and la'tb-
fu ly paid all its creditors, has also rtluved ilulf
entirdyfrom d bt." The .on!} shadow ef exception
to ¡his sweeping declaration wh ch I can find,
either in the Message or Repeat, relates to Treasti
ry no'esoubtandmur, and to "an obligation entered
inio in behali of tae D s net of Co'ambia," and
faith these Hems are readily disposed of. As to f>e
four anda h'.f niilhons of Treasury notesoat-
sUndias, >npy are to be redeemed m 1841, out of
"curruu revenue.*' Th- s'atsmen s 1 have sub-
muted, as well as the very bi I now before us for a
nev issue of no'e ,show «hat chance there is of
tnat. And as to t^e ' oo> gation in behalf oí ih¡ 
D strict ot" Columb a,'' wny, ihat «b.igation ' must
sovD be d"s hirg'd'—as if the di bt was to be paid
by ¡hs D,- net of Columbia, and that would re-
lieve tnis Government from the ' obliga ¡oa." I
will only say, sir, that, as I understand this mailer,
this cielt is o-ri, aad not that of tne corporate cities
of ibis Disinct. It has been distinctly assumed by
tb's Grovernmpttt, upon a good con^Jera'icn pass-
ing between the pai tfs, and tr-e^c Cit es hsve no-
thing fuiin r to do with i
Bui tie P.e ident thirty hmiself justified m de-
claring, mile whole, that to s Government has
'•relieved i'self entirely from debt." I am not able
to iwuer mjself so much in regard to this item m
cur financial condition, as the ommous statements
which I 1'o'd in my hand, and will now present,
may setve to show.

So that the whole amourt of indebted-
ness and liabilities,onaccount of past
transactions., was, on the 1st of Janu-
ary, 1841, probably not less than     #38,015,000
I have only a word or two of remsik to offer
with ih's-sta ement. In the accoont of actual and
a eerlamed debt, I J ut (¡own f 5 000,000 as the
value or purchase of the annuities to tediara.
Wh a kokmg at taese annuities as a debt, #at
dt bt can on y be stated id a principal sum. I have
not mj-etf made a computation of the value of
these annuiUes—a thing easily done, according to
well es abashed ruks and principles, but I as  in-
formed by o bers, who have looked more etesely
into the subject, ihat their valne is tatieb greater
than I have supposed. It is probably eight or ten
millions. I do not sa?, of course, that this prinél-
¡>alsom is ever to be patd; but there can bes#jwst
compuuuon  f how much the country osves, wjA-
oat itatmg this item, and stating rt in this way.
Tne same general remark applies to tbe item of
sums required by law to be invested for Indians, if
the pol cy shall hereafter be, as it has hitherto been,
to pay an annual interest en the«e sums, instead of
investing th'm. It is not lively, however, that the
p^si' ve tb igatioLs ot .reaties are hereafter to be
so l'ghily legarded. The Government will proba-
bly pay what u really owes
In the account of general liabilities, which I
have added to the statement of actual and certain
debt, I do not mean to be understood that any tWag
there is beyond doubt or cavil. That the "c'aims"
there mentioned exist, and that the amoants are sot
exaggiraied, I confidently believe. Maay sappojse
the amounts to be vastly greater. I believe the
Treasury will yet groan under them. The fourth
instalment of deposite money is claimed by some
of the Sta*es at least. So much, at any rate, is
true, that a law now ex s's directing, m the most
p ^itive i^s iWs imney to be deDOsi ed with the
¡3 at s, and tnat Uw has never bren repealed, and
it has pever been executed. Until one or the other
*nmg 'akes place, 1 can dj no otherwise thaneoimt
thi^ as a " ¿ability" ot ihe Government. In re-
gard to the last Hem m this account, I do not tore
ay ti.at the claims on account of French spolia-
tions ought to'be allowed—I will give my opinion
about th">t at ihe proper lime, if called upon to do
s', but we know that they have many advocates,
and my op.>..üii is, toat it is quit- likely ihat this
will uairnateíy be acknowleaged m Congiess as a
jus. d~at lop  aue by the Government, and, there-
in ie, to be paid.
