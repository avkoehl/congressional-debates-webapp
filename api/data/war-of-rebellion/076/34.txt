tahoochee. I want you and McPherson to threaten the flank of the enemy from Ruff's Mill; also in the direction of Turner's Ferry. We have gathered in many prisoners, and by pushing them will get many more. Send this to McPherson. Cross the Nickajack with a strong head of column so as to threaten the enemy and take advantage of any confusion resulting from Thomas' pursuit.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.

General SHERMAN:

I have just received your dispatch of 11.35 and shown it to McPherson. He is moving out, and I will support him if necessary. Our signal officers were informed from Lost Mountain that you had not taken Marietta or I would have been some distance ahead.

Respectfully,

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.

JULY 3, 1864.

General SCHOFIELD:

I will send McPherson according to former orders to Widow Mitchell's. General Thomas with his whole army will follow the enemy's main army, and in case he crosses the Chattahoochee I propose to move you again over to the left, but in mean time let your skirmishers fall down to and across Nickajack. Let your wagons get provisions at Big Shanty to-day.

Major-General.
