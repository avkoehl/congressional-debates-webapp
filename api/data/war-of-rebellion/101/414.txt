HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE MISSOURI,Saint Louis, Mo., January 4, 1865.

Brigadier General THOMAS EWING, Jr.,

Commanding Saint Louis District:

The general commanding desires to be informed what were the reasons of occasion of placing a garrison at Caruthersville, on the Mississippi River.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. W. BARNES,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

[Indorsement.]
HEADQUARTERS SAINT LOUIS DISTRICT,Saint Louis, Mo., January 7, 1865.

Respectfully returned.

The garrison was placed at Caruthersville by Major-General Pleasanton when in command of this district last fall. I see no good reason why a garrison should be placed there. I will withdraw this garrison and strengthen Bloomfield with it.

THOMAS EWING, JR.,

Brigadier-General.

PILOT KNOB, January 4, 1865.

General EWING:

Captain Bostwick, commanding at Patterson, informs me by telegraph this morning that a citizen scout sent down to within twenty miles of Pocahontas has just returned and reports that he could not hear of any organized rebel force in that part of Arkansas.

H. M. HILLER,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS SUB-DISTRICT,Cape Girardeau, Mo., January 4, 1865.

Major-General DODGE, Commanding:

I sent an expedition last week to the Arkansas line below Hornesrsville. * They killed eight who belonged to White's brigade. I sent another to Poplar Bluff, in Butler County, who killed several, some of whom had furloughs on their persons, from White's command. This strengthens my belief from other sources that they are raising a force there. I have sent a force of 150 cavalry, who crossed Indian Ford, near Poplar Bluff, to-day with orders to proceed until they find the enemy and ascertain the truth. I will other parties.

J. B. ROGERS,

Colonel

Colonel ROGERS, Cape Girardeau, Mo.:

Could not the troops at Caruthersville do better service at Bloomfield?

Major-General.
