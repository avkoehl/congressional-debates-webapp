Making public officers depositories—Mr. Naylo
H- of Reps.
these circumstances, the I ict that theie will be one nundied
thousand of these men-—I say they will in some ca=*es, inevita
bly misappiopriate the money Largo amounts ol it must be
lost The treasuies of the countiy will be plundered Undei
such a system ihcie is no safety ioi the public funds
But, sir, this is not the only evil that Í see m this r easuie
The loas wf thepubl c moneys will be nothing, compared to the
moral and political evils that mibt flow fiom it "I paiI ns not
into temptation," was the sublinn piayei of our God Our
raters, disregarding thit> div ne 3esson,bcem determined to sur
round their public oftic is with a consuming fiieoftempta

sciences ate to be seared, and they are to goabioid conupted
andconupting, until the whole bodv politic becomes one ol
fensive maesof putudity, smelling to Heaven, and tainting the
very atmospheie of fieedom This may be strong language
But I see the evil strongly—I feel it strongly
I have heiid of he dangei of uniting the purse and the
sword All the union*! of this kind heretofore depienatedas
existing in this country are a& ropes oi sandoi btmdsol gns^a

You will not only unite owe puue and one sword, in, air, you

of all ties and teat lies them i]ieir power This is the reason why
credit and despotism are never found togetr-er It makes men
too strong for tyrants'   Were it possible to diffuse, at once   \
thioughout all Russia, the credit that pievads in thiscoun'iy
the iron bonds of Russian despotism would be buist asundei as
by magie, and the Russian serf, springing at once into the iu'l
dig iity of freedom, would stand erect and anehackled'
It tsthe policy of tyiants to keep their subjee isapait They
are for weakening the ties that bind them togethei They aie
for disconnecting «¿veiy man from his neighbor, forcing him
to stand isolated and atohe, mowing the seeds oi jealousy,
distrust, and individual disunion , destroying all combina
lions, and making every one depend lone upon the sove
reisn power
This state of things cannot exist with a credit system Cred
it gives men onejntei est, makes them depend upon one anofhei,
and combines them into one uresistible whole .P erefoio it is
th it despo s are at wai with credit They must keep men
apait m savage, barbnons, desolate isolation The moment
a common mteiest, given by a common undeistanlmg and mu

the i eason why Iibei ty and credit ai e found s de hy s de togeth

Look at all the non ciedit countnes of Emope They aie all
despotisms, every ore of them1 And what are they doing foi
man for civilizan m, for the spread of free pnnuples?
Why nothing—absolutely nothing' There they die m chains
and wretchedness, without liberty, without domestic com
foit, envelopted m ignorance and baibaiism, without even
the hope of íational fieedom to cheer and hnghten un the
future"                                                                                    l
