Staff of the General-in-Chief, Washington:

COLONEL: I have the honor to forward to you the inclosed letter of Major-General W. S. Rosecrans, commanding department. The general desired me to make such verbal explanations as the General-in-Chief might require.

I also inclose a statement of our available force in and about Murfreesborough, which differs considerably from the "paper" army.

I shall remain in the city no longer than to-morrow, as my health will not permit me to put further off that care and treatment which I can only obtain at home.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
