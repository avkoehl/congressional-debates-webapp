Colonel HARKER, Mooresville:

(To be sent by special messenger from Decatur.)

Your brigade will move at once to Bridgeport, the infantry and baggage going by rail and the artillery and wagon train marching. Caps will be sent as soon as they can be got ready; probably to-morrow. The artillery and wagons can come here without escort, and cavalry escort will be sent with them from here on.

Directions: The operator will give copy of this to the regiment opposite Decatur, and it and battery will go at once to Mooresville.

General MANSON, Camp near Athens:

General Buell directs that you send a brigade under Colonel Hazen to rebuild the railroad to Reynold's Station. There must be four regiments, and they will be posted as follows: One at Elk River; one at tunnel, to camp at north end; one at Butterford, south side of Richland Creel; one 2 1/2 miles south of Reynolds' Station, north side of Richland Creek. These regiments must fill all the demands for working parties made by engineers and the work must be pushed with all possible dispatch, the regiments not to leave the duty without special orders from here. Move the brigade at once. If there are not four regiments present with Hazen's brigade assign him enough to make that number. General Buell trusts Colonel Hazen will give his personal attention to the rapid prosecution of this work.

He will make his headquarters at the north end of the tunnel.
