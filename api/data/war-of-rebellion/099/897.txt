SPECIAL HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT AND FIELD ORDERS, ARMY OF THE TENNESSEE, No. 65. Falling Creek Church, N. C., March 19, 1865.

The following operations of this command will take place to-morrow: Major General John A. Logan, commanding Fifteenth Army Corps, will move one brigade with a section of artillery and drive the enemy across Cox's Bridge and get possession of the same or force the enemy to destroy it. He will then immediately move the rest of his command toward Bentonville. Major General F. P. Blair, commanding Seventeenth Army Corps, will move as rapidly as possible to Falling Creek Church, and taking the road to the left, move out and take position on the left of the Fifteenth Army Corps. All wagons now here, including those of department headquarters, which are not required during our engagement, will be parked at the cross-roads near Cox's Bridge. The surplus trains will be parked closely and carefully so that their guard, which is necessarily small, may be able to protect them against the enemy's cavalry.

By order of Major General O. O. Howard:

Assistant Adjutant-General.
