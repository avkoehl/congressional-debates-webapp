Chief of Staff:

GENERAL; I find that the flag I saw was the enemy's, and that they have reoccupied all the line we drove them from except a little around the crater, which a small force of ours still holds.

Respectfully,G. K. WARREN.

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC.

July 30, 1864-5 p.m.

Major-Generals WARREN and BURNSIDE:

Signal officers report the enemy returning rapidly from the north side of the James. Every preparation should be made to strengthen the line of works where any obstacles have to-day been removed. The lines should be held strongly with infantry and artillery posted wherever practicable. Available reserves held in hand ready for movement in case it becomes necessary. I anticipate offensive movement on the part of the enemy, and expect it will be by a movable column turning our left and threatening our rear.

GEO. G. MEADE.

Major-General, Commanding.

Major-General Hancock will, to-night, resume his former position, and General Ord his, also.
