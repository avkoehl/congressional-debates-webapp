Major-General HALLECK:

DEAR GENERAL: By some mistake I fear the letter of which the inclosed is a duplicate not sent to you.

Everything is going on well. Seymour, who is the hands of a set of the meanest ward politicians in this State, held out to the last and then backed out. He was pledged to support the opposition to the draft. Some of the men about him had the impudence to say that his militia would be more than a match for the U. S. troops. His proclamation, which the mob consider an abandonment of his pledges, received, as far as I can learn, a general cursing in that quarter yesterday.

Colonel Nugent is preparing for the draft in the other city districts, and I think will be ready on Monday.

I am, very truly, yours,

JOHN A. DIX.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

GENERAL: I am much gratified by the prompt and efficient preparation made by the Government to sustain its authority. I trust it will overawe resistance, and under any circumstances it will have salutary effect. You need not fear that the rioters, if they show themselves, will be tenderly treated. My orders on the day I took command were: First, to use no blank cartridges; and second, not only to disperse the mob, but to follow them up and so deal with them that the same persons should never be assembled again.

I went out with General Canby yesterday and selected the position to be occupied by the troops, some of whom we hope to see to- morrow morning.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOHN A. DIX,

Major-General.
