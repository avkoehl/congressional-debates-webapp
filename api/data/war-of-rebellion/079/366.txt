NASHVILLE, October 19, 1864 - 9 p. m.

Major-General SHERMAN:

General Washburn is here. He reports his force not large enough to undertake the capture of Eastport, as he represents Forrest has a larger force there, with considerable artillery. Have just heard from commanding officer gun-boat fleet, at Mound City, who says he will not be able to furnish an iron-clad for the expedition. Morgan's and Wagner's DIVISIONS having been sent to you, I have no force to aid Washburn, but if you will send me one of my DIVISIONS, one of General Howard's, I will organize a force to operate against Eastport and destroy railroad. If my information of Forrest's strength is correct, there should be from 5,000 to 6,000 reliable infantry added to the cavalry force that can be raised, to insure success. Major-General Mower is here, and if General Howard can send a DIVISION of infantry the expedition might be placed under command of General Mower.

Your dispatch is received. It is impossible to furnish an iron- clad; besides, there is not water enough for them. I have sent three light-draughts to operate against Eastport.

Join me by way of Rome. I can at this time only given you a DIVISION, but I want you to give energy to the head of a column. I sent for you for another purpose, but will explain all when I see you.
