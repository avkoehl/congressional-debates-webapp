Brigadier General JOHN H. KELLY,

Commanding, &amp;c.:

The general directs me to say that there is no news of importance here. Wheeler dispatches from Newnan that he has completed the killing, capturing, and breaking up of the raiding party under McCook. Yours of 9.40 received.

ATLANTA, August 1, 1864-9 p. m.

Colonel CUYLER and

Major MALLETT,

Ordnance Officers, Macon, Ga.:

General Bragg directs that you send me at once all the negroes employed on public buildings at your post.

J. B. HOOD,

General.

COLUMBUS, August 1, 1864.

Colonel JOHN B. SALE:

Roddey's command will reassemble at Opelika and march to North Alabama. The withdrawal was most unfortunate. The raid upon Macon is driven back, and railroad and telegraphic communication will soon be restored; but we are reaping the bitter fruits of seed long since sown. Many of Hood's brigades are so reduced in numbers, some as low as 500, and the material for commanders so exhausted, that I suggest to the President the expediency of consolidation when the commanding general deems it best.

BRAXTON BRAGG.
