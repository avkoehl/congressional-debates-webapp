the same rate as coffee, and therefore upon chic-
cory, though a much cheaper article, a fluty 13
proposed of four cents in the root and five cents
when burnt or ground. An article so largely
■used as a substitute for coffee'it is quite cleaf
should bear an equal tax, and if it is more health-
ful, or has a more delightful flavor, as is con-
tended for by its commercial friends, such an
.equality in the eye of the law should meet with
no objection.
It is most unfortunate that our currency is sub-
ject to so great fluctuations,^ the tendency is to
draw even solid men into the arena of speculators
where they may invest legal tenders in stocks or
other property with a view to a rise. This makes
it for the interest of allgproperty holders, and es-
pecially large holders ol merchandise, to depress
the value of legal tenders. A decisive victory,
•whenever it comes, will prove a sharp remedy;
but at present, as I profoundly believe, an equally
heroic remedy would be to cease the future issue
of legal tenders, to cut that base, and rely ex-
clusively on loans, and the sale of United States
stocks. As soon as our new internal revenue and
tariff bills get into operation, even with the present
rate of funding, it is true there will no longer be
any necessity for a further issue of legal tenders
of any description. I think some portion of the
amount now afloat should be withdrawn even at
the cost of higher rates of interest. This specu-
lative fever enables all holders of merchandise,
whether manufacturers or merchants, to realize
larger prices and larger profits than they could
otherwise,do. With the idea that merchandise
is sure to rise, they advance prices and realize
gains in advance. But it is so uneertain and fic-
titious that even these would hail solidity and
permanence of values as a great boon.
It is also true that many large holders of mer-
candise urge heavy additions to the duties upon
certain articles and assume that they will be so
laid to p'romote the interests of the public Treas-
ury. Meantime, whether currency goes up or
not, or whether the tariff goes up or not, prices
do go up and all are on the alert to secure the
profits based on prophecies destined not to come
to pass. Men get drugged with these ideas and
are powerless in the hands of sk'iHful operators.
But a combination takes place and high prices
are in the ascendant. The consumer, more or less
panic-stricken, forgetting that the entire wealth
of the nation, earned and unearned, stands be-
hind the United States legal tenders, easily be-
comes a willing dupe and no longer rejects any-
thing in consequence of the price, if the seller
will only accept of "greenbacks" in payment for
his commodities. I allude to this matter to show
that it is not taxes or the tariff which so much
enhance prices.. Drugs have been affected in
* tins way, spices to some extent, and possibly
teaa—affected by what it has been boldly pro-
claimed Congress would do. It may be said that
it requires some boldness to say what Congress
would not do, as the times have seemed to require
some exceptionable measures, or at least do not
permit things to remain in their former repose.
The existing duties upon teas of ail kinds, and
-1 speak without reference to the fifty percent, ad-
dition recently made by the joint resolution, is
twenty cents per pound. It is thought prices have
already been advanced as far as they can be sus-
tained if we raise the duty upon teas to twenty-five
cents per pound. Although not entirely relevant
t,ow it will be on the second Tuesday of Decem-
ber, when the reciprocity treaty again comes up—
I desire to show in connection with teas how the
American tea trade with the Biitish provinces now
stands, as it will illustrate theirsystem oflevymg
duties. The Canadian tariff imposes on teas three
cents per pound, and fifteen per cent, ad vctlovefti
at the port or place whence last imported, (It is
now somewhat changed by law of 1862.) Black
teas cost about twenty-five cents and green teas
about thirty-five cents per pound upon an average
in China. The cost to import teas per pound, not
including the cost in China, is, .with gold at 185,
about soventy-g cents per pound, which brings
the first costof teas in NewYork at$l 10 per pound.
Their value then is from that sum to $1 40, say
$1 25. Now the specific duty is'say three cents,
then fifteen per cent, ad valorem when imported
from the United States would be levied on 25,
and i|3 eighteen cents and seven 'mills, making
twenty-one cents and seven mills. When the s.ame
tea is imported to Canada from China the specific
is the same, three cents, and the fifteen per cent, ad
valorem is, on thirty-five cents,five cents and two
mills, making eight cents and two mills; so that
tea cannot be exported from the United States to
Canada without paying about thirteen and a half
cents more than when it is brought there from
China. And this is the discrimination intended
to practically exclude and does exclude us from
their trade.
No more has been proposed because, in pro-
portion to its original cost, that is a high duty;
more would be as likely to diminish as to increase
the revenue, and with our people it has been an
article of necessity which £t cheers but doe^ not
inebriate." In times of peace teas have been ad-
mitted free of duty, and we may hope for that
time again, but not now. We consume of green
teas about 13,000,000 pounds, and of black about
14,500,000 pounds, or in all 27*,500,000 pounds.
The actual importations of 1863 were 29,761,037
pounds. The increased revenue from this source
may bo estimated at one and one fourth million
dollars.
One question has more perplexed the Congress
of the united States than almost any other that
I am aware of, and that is the adjustment of the
duties on wool and woolens so fis to obtain revenue
and at the same time to distribute justice to all
parties. Some encouragement has been intended
always to increase the production of wool. But
up to 1860 the increase on the growth of wool
was less than the increase of almost anything
else of" which the census makes any return. Prom
1850 to I860 the increase was less than ten mil-
lion pounds. Population increased thirty-five
and wool .only fifteen per cent. The tariff of 1861
was intended to oblain some revenue upon the
importations of such wool as comes into compe-
tition with American wools. To this end a duty
of three cents per pound was placed on all wools
costing between eighteen and twenty-four cents,
and nine cents per pound on all above twenty-
four cents per pound. Wool below eighteen cents
was intended to cover only coarse wools for car-
pets, of which very little is grown here, and on
this only five per cent, was placed. I then thought
that the coarse wools should have been fixed be-
low fifteen cents, but others thought differently.
In fact, at that time all the woolen manufacturers,
save one, that 1 knew, gave the tariff of 1861 the
cold shoulder. It had very little support from
them, although in the duties upon woolens a spe-
cific duty upon the pound of woolen cloth was
proposed, reckoning two pounds of American
wool as equivalent to one pound of cloth; and
this was intended to cover and did cover all or
nearly all the duties proposed on wool. The
woolen manufacturing establishments have since
prospered, and I am rejoiced that they have pros-
pered. Before this time their capital invested was
not worth seventy-five cents on the dollar of first
cost. Now they are .generally worth par or a
premium. We now manufacture many millions
more of woolen goods than ever before, and our
importations are at least eight to ten millions less,
though still very large. The wool-grower has
so far prospered, also, as to increase the stock of
American-grown wools more in three years than
three decades before, and yet he has not kept
pace with the wants of the woolen manufacturers.
The clip of wool for 1863 may be estimated at
eighty"to eighty-five million pounds,and will not
be (with the ten millions produced in the seceded
States) much less than one hundred millions for
1864. There is much of last year's clip of wool
now on hand unsold, and at a time when we can-
not affoid to hoard it and send away gold to pay
for foreign wools. This shows there is some (le-
fe.ct in the law that must be remedied, and that
the manufacturer is in a better position than 'the
wool-grower. This more clearly appears from
the trade in wools! ! •-V.

To this must be added the amount of waste or
shoddy (in 1862 it was 6,291,077 pounds,) esti-
mated at 8,000,000 pounds, making 82,838,046
pounds, or nearl/ as much as was raised in the
United States the same year, which itmay be a lib-
eral estimate to call 85,000,000 pounds, and this
makes 167,838,046 pounds.
The capacity of our woolen rriitlsin 1860 did not
exceed 100,000,000 pounds of wool, and Che ad-
dition of new machines and increased speed does
not now probably go beyond 150,000,000pounds,
and they cannot be supposed to have actually-
worked up much over 140,000,000 pounds. Slip-
posing there are 25,000,000 of loyal people'to
clothe, and that it requires four pounds of wool
for each, it would amount, with the not less than
40,000,000 pounds worked up into Army cloths,
blankets,&c.,to 140,000,000 pounds manufactured
in the United States. This would leave gO,000,000
pounds or more of domestic wools of last year's
clip on- hand to serve no other purpose than to de-
press the price of this year's clip. Ought such
a state of facts to continue ?
Of the immense amount of imported* wools,
(74,838,046 pounds,) almost equal to the whole
clip of the "United States, there was valued above
eighteen cents only 7,617,861 pounds; leaving
6f,220,185 pounds—valued abroad upon an aver-
age of seventeen cents per pound—which paid a
duty only of five per cent, less the free wool under
the reciprocity treaty. ' ' " ;
I will give m tabular form the amount of wool
and woolens, domestic and foreign, consumed in
the United States:

The facts shown here are that onr domestic
wools had notdoubled in twenty years, while the
importation of foreign wools had more than
doubled. Our woolen manufactures in the same
time had more than trebled, and the importations
of foreign woolens had more than quadrupled.
This is far from creditable to uses a great nation.
The market price of wool has advanced recently
about six cents per pound, or forgocd fleece wool
to about eighty cents; but when reduced toaspe-
cie standard by discounting the premium on gold,
now at about ninety per cent., it brings the price
down to less than it was at the depressed period
of 1861,when, according to Mr. Livermore's ( Bos-
ton) tables, fine wool was selling at forty-four
cents per pound. Under these circumstances the
woolen manufacturers should be the first to rec-
ognize, with their business so extended, with the
hTgh price of cotton and the multiform fabrics
introduced for ladies' and gentlemen's summer
wear, and not likely soon to go out of fashion,
all requiring a very large stock of the raw mate-
rial, that their business might be seriously em-
barrassed and imperiled by checking the growth
of sheep in this country or compelling the wool-
growers to take the prices for which wool can be
produced on the grassy but uncultivated plains
of Russia, South America, and Australia, or where
they slaughter bullocks for their hides and horses
for their tails. It is very clear they will not and
