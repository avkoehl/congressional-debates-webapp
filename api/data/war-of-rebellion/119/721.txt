Every officer connected officially with such prisoners, on permanent or daily duty, will make himself familiar with the contents of that circular, and will strictly carry out its orders in letter and spirit. He will report to the commander of the post any deviations from the above circular in order that they may be remedied in the public interests and for the protection of all engaged in duties of great difficulty and responsibility.

Special Orders, No. 247, November 6, says:

Articles of food or clothing intended for prisoners of war, or Union prisoners, will be left at the exterior gate in charge of the officer of the guard, carefully labeled.

Special Orders, No. 252, says:

The articles left for prisoners at the exterior gate are subject at all times to the orders of the provost-marshal.

In pursuance of the recommendation of the post surgeon the prisoners confined in the interior (under charges of being spies, etc.) will be allowed to exercise in the open air for half an hour each day under guard.

A similar order was issued on December 13 in regard to other prisoners of the same class. An order of the same date says:

The provost-marshal, in pursuance of Paragraph IV, circular of Commissary-General of Prisoners, will give notice of any clothing needed for prisoners of war in order that the proper requisitions may be made at these headquarters.
