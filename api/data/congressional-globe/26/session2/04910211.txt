vernment, have been distributed to the States in
the ratio prescribed. Sir, this will not do The
doctrine contended or, on the other side, involves
its advocates in too much difficuUy. There is no
mystery in this whole matter, nor is there, m my
judgment, any ambiguity in the deeds of cession
And Í should like to find.in the debates of theConti-
tmental Congress, any authority for the assumption
that these lands were not ceded to the Untied States,to
constitute a commcn fund for their use and benefit
I should like to have some Senate r m tne Opposi-
tion show ma a line or a letter, m the history of
that period, sanction ng th° idea that the States of
the Confederacy had tne right to claim the avails
of the public lands to the prejudice of the Con-
fedeiacy The his'o y of tr-e times gives n© au-
thority for bach a position—and the deed;, them-
selves give no authority for such a position The
grant was made to the United States t0 constitute
a common fund, and for what1 For the use and
benefit of sach of the United Stales as may be-
come members of the Federal alliance, Virginia
inclusive, according to their usual respective pro-
portions in the geieral charge and expenditure
Now, sir, mark tne expressions Hi  grant was
made to the United Sutes. This was the style
given by the first article of the Confederation to
the Confederacy of Statss, and "what then com-
posed the Untied State0—those Sta'es which had be-
come members of the Federal alliance, including Vir
gima And by the same Articles of Conf^derat on
other States might be formed and admitted num-
bers of the Confederacy and upon any such oc
currence, the States thus added to the alliance were
also made part of &<• United States Virginia then,
by h r deed, conveyed to all the States by the name
and style of the United States, a portion of hpr do-
main, for the purpose of constituting a common
fund for the use and benefit of all such States, ?c-
cording to their respec ive proportions m the gene-
ral charge and expenditure—an expression perfect-
ly well understood at that time The deed con-
tained no direction to divide among the States the
proceeds of the land, but such proceeds were to
remain a common fund for their general use
The object mu%t have been, m thus granting this
large tract of unsettled country, clearly to confine
the applications of the proceeds to the public use
To direct that in all time to cane, the avails should
go to deiray the expenses and charge* of the Con-
federacy—that they should not be granted wilh
out price—that the Slates then members of the Fe-
deral alliance should practrally derive a benefit in
the sale and disposition of these lands by the United
States, m fair an just propoition to their part in
the general charge and expenditure The United
States were to ho'ct the laads, and they were to
constitute a common fund for the use and benefit
of the whole Confederacy It was thf object of
Virginia, in making the grant, to provide a com
mon fund It was the anxious wish and the con-
stant and earnest request of Congress, that hese
cessions should be made, so that a common fund
might thereby be provided for the use and benefit
of all the States If the purpose could have been
such as is contended ft r, •« ould the deeds, have been
thus drawn? If the cesMons had besp for the
use and benefit of the respective Stales as indepen-
dent communities, would not the nature of the trust
and the use been clearly expressed? It ?eems to
me to be idle to contend that by these deeds ai ob-
ligation is imposed upon Congress to divide the
proceeds of the lands among the States. And this
must be maintained, or eke the ded  oí cession
must be wholly excluded. Let us look a little fur-
ther into these deeds It will be recollec'ed, at the
time these gran*s were mpde, Congress did not pos-
sess the power, under the Articles of Confederation,
to impose taxes upon the State . That was done
by the States themselyes The States then mem
bers, and those which might afterwards become
members of the Federal alliance, were to derive a
benefit in the proce els of th' public lands accord-
ing *o their respective proDert on  m the g neial
charge and expenditure The United Slates cou'd
not, according to the deeds, appropriate the avails
of the public lands to relieve any one State from
its embarrassment, nor could it appropriate the
avails for the exclusive benefit ef any particu-
lar numbei of the States No Congress was
bound to apply the aval's for the common be-
nefit of all, and each were to derive a benefit in
proportion to its charge and expenditure. This
was all the benefit reserved in the deeds fir the re-
spe tive States, and the proportion of the States in
the general charge and expenditure was a matter
perfectly well understood at that period of our his-
tory    By the eigoth article of the Confederation—
"All charges ofwar and all other expenses that shall ba
incurre 1 foi the common defence orgeneral welfare and allow
ed by the Urine 1 State  in Congress assemb ed shall be <le
iraye lout of a common Tieasiry whuh shall be supplied hy
tne sever il States in pr poition to the value of all land
within eacli feme giantel to or surveyed for any person as
such Ian i and the buddings anl imprtvemems thereon
shall be estn idled according to such mole as the Ijmted fotates
m Congte s assembled shall from time to time dnect and ap
point
' The taxes for paying that proportion shall be lai 1 and levied
by the aulhoiity and direction of the Legislatures ol the several
states, within the time agreed upon by the United States in Con
gress assembled '
And during the existence of the Confederation
was not this provision of the deed  fully answered.
Could it have been otherwise' If a million of dol-
lar  had been received from the sales of ihe publ c
lands—would it have not been dtposned in the
public Trcasur), and must not Virginia ha\e ne-
cessarily derived a benefit fiom suth a receipt ac-
cording to her proportion m the geneial charge and
expenditure'' Suppose that enough had been re-
ceived in any one year from tie lands to have paid
a'l the expenses of the G vernment, would not the
States have been benefited in the exact proportion
mentioned in the deed, ac-ordmg to ihe Articles of
Confederation Would nit Virginia have been
relieved f.cm her contnbuhoi for any such
year 1 And would r>ot New Hampshire
have b^en m like manre" relieved"* These
Stales were all represented in the then Con-
gress of the United S at"s and all the revenue de-
rived from the sales of the public lands during the
continuance ot tne Confederation enured to the
benefit of the S* ite , according to their respective
proportion in the genera! charge and expenditure.
The terms of ¡he grant then v.ete literally ful-
filled And so it has been since the adoption of the
Constitution Our revenue^ are now derived from
customs as well as from lands But suppose that
the import system were abolished, and a direct tax
upon property were to be imposed in order to sup-
ply a revenue for the support of Government. It
would b* apportioned among the Slates according
to their rtpresentat on Bat instead of a direct
tax, let us suppose the whole revenue necessary
for the support if Government for a single year
were derived from the sales of the public lands,
would it rot follow tho the States would be benefited
according to their respective pi ~> rtionsm the gene-
ral charge and expenditure" It does not seem to
me to admit of a question, that the great object in
obtaining these cessions, and that the great object
in making thes" se sions to the United State", were
for the purpose of providing a common fund for
the u e and benefit of ? II t e States—that this pur-
pose has been most faithful y executed—and that
a distribution among the Stite>of the pioceedsof
lands would defeat th¡> very object of the grantors
as well a? the gran'ees—because such a distri-
bution would clearly add to ihe burdens of the
people. The objects in obtaining these grant* were
ievenue—were pecun arv means, to be applied for
ihe benefit of toe wno!e Union As I have before
said, if the deeds of cession impose the obi gation
upon Congress to distribute among the States the
avaiis, such avails could not, at any time of our
hi  ory, have been applied in goo 1 faitn for public
purpose' The proceeds eith r belonged to the
United States or to the Sta'es If the United S ates
are the ti usees of the Sates, then Congress is
boeind to collect its revenue from imports, or by
direct taxation, and the proceeds oi the lands
should go a* once to the Slates This is denied
The cne;in of the«e cession  gives to them their
cha-acter anl pjipo e
Jhf history of tne events of lh  devolution in
relati n to ihi« subjec , eani< t fail to give much
valuable instruction The articles of confedera-
tion were proposed as early as November, 1777,
those States which had not within their limits any
ungranted lands, felt a strong jealousy of the pow-
er and influence of those States which bad unlimit-
ed grants of territory That feeling long prevent-
ed the adop ion of the Articles of Confederation,
and not until late in 1778 were they assented to by
my own State, and by the State of New Jersey,
notwithstanding the earnest and pressing solicitude
of Congress, declaring that "this salutary measure,
the Confederation, can no longer be delayed," yet it
did not readily receive the sanction of the States.
It was then declared as essential to our very exist-
ence as a free people, and without it we may soon
be constrained to bid adieu to independence, to li-
berty, and safety. And it was urged upon the
States "under a conviction of uniting all our re-
sources and all our strength to maintain and defend
our common liberties ' Such appeals had the de-
sired efiect, and finally induced the ratification o£
the articles by the requisite majority of the States.
But the feeling then entertained by many of the
States was manifested by the representation of New
Jersey, as subjoined
' The ninth article provides that no State shall be deprived of
territory lor the benefit of the United States whether we are to
undei stand, that by teuitory is intended any land, the property
of which was heretofore vested m the crown of Great Britain,
or, that no mention of su h land is madem the Confederation,
we are constrained lo observe that the present war, as we al
ways apprehended was undertaken for the general defence and
interest of the confederating colonies, now the United States It
was even the confident expectation of this State, that the benefits
derived from a successful contest were to be general and pro
portionate and that the property of the common enemy, falling
in eonseq Knee of a prosperous issue of the war, would belong
to the United States and be appropriated to heir use We are
theiefore greatly disappointed m finding no provision made in
the Confederation for empoweri g the Congress to dispose of
such propeity but especially the vacant and unpatented lands
commo ly calle 1 the crown 1 inda for defraj ing the expenses of
the war md fir such other public and general purposes The
juusdiction ought in every instance to belong to the respective
Stale** within t e chartei or determined limits of which such
lands m ly 1 p spate 1 but reason and justice must decide that the
property which existed in the crown of Great Britain previous
to the piesent Revolution ought now to belong to the Congress
mttust for the u^eand benefit of the United States They have
fought and bled for it in proportion totheir respecuve abilities,
and therefore the reward ought not to be predilectionally distn
buted Shall such States as ate shut oat by situation from
availing themselves of the laast advantage from this quarter, be
left to sink under an enormous debt, whilst others are enabled
m a short period to replace alt their expenditures firom.the.har
earnings of the whole Confederacy?'
This was a common sentiment, founded m im-
mutable justice—in the nature and fitness of things,
and so strong and so deep was it impressed upon
the public mind, that it would have been a vain.
effort to have resisted its, influence
Congress, on the sixth of September, 1780, m its
recommendation to the States, resolved that "it ap-
pears advisable to press upon those States, which
can remove the embarrassment respecting the
Western country, a liberal surrender of a portion
of her territorial claims, since they cannot be pre-
served entire without endangering the slabthPy of
the general Confederacy To remind them how in-
di pensably necessary it is to establish a Federal
Union on a fixed and permanent basis, and en
principles acceptable to all its respective members;
how essential to public peace and confidence in
support of au army, to the vigor of our councils,
and sucre s of our measures, to our tranquillity at
home, ts our reputation abroad, to ow very exist'
ence   as afree sovereign, and independent people "
And in perfect accordance with the general senti-
ment contained in the preceding resolutions of
Congress, we find that, on the 10th of October,
1780, Congress resolved "that the unappropriated
lands that may be eed<>d or rehngnished to the
United States by any particular S ate, pursuant to
the recommendation oí Conzress of the 6th Sep-
tember last, shall be disposed of for the common bene-
fit of the United State " How idle, then, to con-
tend that by these very deeds of cession an obliga-
tion is imposed upon CoDgress to divide among th©
States the revenue derived from ihe lands, thus in-
creasing the burdens which it was intended thereby
to lessen1
The State of New York had, previous to this
proceeding of the Continental Congress, passed a
law to make a ceision of a portion t f her i¡>nds.
Vngmia did the same early m ihe fol'owmg i tax.
And long after the pass?ge of the art by the Legis-
lature of Virginia, giving authority to make the

when the defects of the system of confederation
had become apparent, and Congress was deeply
impressed with the necessity of making  better
