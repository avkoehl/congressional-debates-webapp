JEFFERSON CITY, MO., October 14, 1864-8 p. m.

Honorable S. H. BOYD,

Colonel, U. S. Volunteers, Springfield, Mo.:

The general does not think it advisable to accept a six-month's regiment, but would recommend organizing three-years' men as rapidly as possible. You must try to live on the country as much as possible, as we may not able to send you rations for some time.

JOHN V. DU BOIS,

Colonel and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF SOUTHWEST MISSOURI,Springfield, Mo., October 14, 1864.

Colonel J. V. DU BOIS,

Chief of Staff, Saint Louis:

Major Burch, commanding at Neosho, reports that Cooper, Brooks, and Adair are concentrating their forces, about 300, in Benton County Ark., with a view of making a raid into this State. I have ordered Burch, with 500 men, to attack them. Guerrillas are very active through the southwest. Several citizens have been murdered in this vicinity.

J. D. BRUTSCHE,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF SOUTHWEST MISSOURI,Springfield, Mo., October 14, 1864.

Major MILTON BURCH,

Commanding, Neosho:

I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your communication of the 13th instant, informing me that Cooper, Brooks &amp; Co., are concentrating their forces in Benton County, Ark., with a view of making a raid into this State. I have ordered Major Moore, with 200 men, and Captain Ray, with 100 men, to proceed by forced marches to Neosho and report to you. Upon their arrival at Neosho you will take command of the above troops and, with 200 men of the Eighth Missouri State Militia of your command at Neosho, move on the enemy if he is in the vicinity of Bentonville. Keep your communication with Neosho and guard against the enemy moving around your force and taking Neosho. Leave sufficient force to hold that place. The move, however, should be made at once in order that you can send Major Moore's and Captain Ray's commands back to their respective posts at the earliest possible moment, as Price's movements may make it necessary to concentrate our forces. Keep me fully advised of your movements.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. D. BRUTSCHE,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF SOUTHWEST MISSOURI,Springfield, Mo., October 14, 1864.

Major MELTON,

Major Burch reports Cooper, Brooks & Co. in Benton County, on their way to Neosho. Adair is reported [with] them. Keep scouts
