NASHVILLE, December 14, 1864-11.10 p. m.

Colonel JAMES GILFILLAN,

Eleventh Minnesota Infantry, Gallatin:

Your dispatch of this evening just received. Re-enforce the guard at the tunnel at once and hold that place. Have the squadron of cavalry collected together and sent to the threatened point as soon as possible.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding.

GALLATIN, December 14, 1864-12 p. m.

Major-General THOMAS,

Commanding:

Have nothing further from the tunnel. Captain Buck sent a man through with a message to the effect that upon learning the presence of the enemy, he sent out a party, who ascertained that hey numbered about 200 and that they were destroying the road. Whose command they were of he did not learn. The trains going up have been turned back. Am sending up all my disposable infantry force.

JAMES GILFILLAN,

Colonel, Commanding.

BRIDGEPORT, December 14, 1864.

Captain FORD,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General:

Scouts that came in to-night report a company of forty rebels twelve miles from this place, on the south side of the river. They claim to be an independent organization, and are scouting the country. The defenses of this place will require considerable labor to put them it a defensible condition, and an additional force of from 300 to 500 would be desirable for the purpose of fatigue and garrison duty.

M. C. TAYLOR,

Colonel, Commanding.

PADUCAH, KY., December 14, 1864.

Brigadier General WILLIAM D. WHIPPLE,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

General Lyon took possession of Princeton, Ky., last night, plundered the place and conscripted all he could, and is reported to be moving on Eddyville, Ky. This news is received from a resident of Princeton that escaped and has just arrived at Smithland. The four regiments of infantry have not arrived yet. Could I have the cavalry when they arrive, which would enable me to pursue him? Please answer.

S. MEREDITH,

Brigadier-General.
