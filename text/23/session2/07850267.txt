1835.
THE •CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
[The chairman of the committee [Mr Hawes}
here mquned whether the gentleman from New
Jersey intended to assert or insinuate that the
committee had not been properly summoned ]
Mr D proceeded 1 have no such intention,
but state the general proposition, and will let the
House undeistand the use I intend to make of a
betoie I ¿it down, and from the feelings of friend-
ship which Í have for the chairman and, indeed,
for all of the majouty of the committee, I have an
assurance that any remaiks which I may make
upon this subject will not be considered personal
or of an unfriendly character
I contend, further, that it is not only the privi-
lege of every member of a committee, but their
duty, to consult together and discuss the matters
submitted 10 their investigation     ThisiSan essen-
tial puviltge of each member, and the duty of
all     If, then, a majori'y of a committee should
deprive the minority of tnis puvilege, I insist that
any report which shou'd he made under the en -
cumstances could not be considered as the report
of the committee     In  this respect the report of
a committee  may justiy be compared with the |
report of arbitrators or referees, their report may
be valid and effec ual, if signed by a majority?!
but it is essent al  to  its validity that it be the
resu't or the consultation of the whole, although !
by the terms of the submission it be agreed that
the report of the majority shall be final and con- 1
elusive                                                                            I
In order to show the application of the pnnci
pies which 1 have submitted to the House, 1 will
now proceed to state the facts connected with the
case, and I take thiscourse, not fiom any personal
connderations, but because I believe that if the
leport be i eoeived and adopted as the report of a
commmee composed of a member from each State,
i' woi,ld have an effect prejudicial to the ms itu-
ti >n, and believ r,g as I do that the institution is
one which oujht not to be destioyed, 1 cannot
consent to any m-ssure which in my opinion will
have that tendency
l\ will be recollected by the House that this
commutee was oigamzed in the early part of the i
session Sooi afterwards they had a meeting
A mdjinty of the commi tee appeared, and I nave
n i doubt but that al! «ere íegularly summoned
Upor that occasion a sub committee of five was
appointed lo investigate certain points winch were
designated, and to make report thereon to the
mam committee 1 do not at this moment recol-
le t the exact woids of the resolution appointirg
that «u ) committee, but my impression was, and
r I is, that the duty assigned to that sub-com- |
mittee v as to leport the facts whicn weie desig
na ed 11 the resolution, and not to report argu
men s or contusions Ihe investigation of the
latís necessary to enable the comm ttee at large
todruv their cunclu i >ns, wasadu y which could
not % ell have been performed by the whole com-
mi tee, and therefore that duty was assigned to a
sub ( >r mit ee, by whom it could more conve-
niently be executed Another circumstance which
satisfies me that I am conect in my impressions
is to the duty of the sub committee is, that the
oi gmal resolution which was introduced before
the committee for the appointment of this sub-
c mi mil tee, authorized them 11 very teims to repot t
treir "opinion" upon thedifferent points of i íves-
tigation Tus featu e in the íesolution became
tlit sub|ect of dist ussion befoi e the committee, and
upon my motion die woid " opinion" w«s stricken
o ii ot the ltMilu i >n, ami,as I understood u,u, on
ttiee\|re a griund that the sub committee we>"e
11 re[ lit the f at onlv I would never have con-
sented to delegate the whole power of the com-
mi tee i v the s b commi'tee, hut was willing that
they should íeport the fads, in order that the
committee might discuss those ficts, and make
su h lomluiions, and report thereon, as the case
i light require About te i da/^ agí the commit-
tee viere again summoned to meet in the evening,
i pi i which oicasion i meteen of the committee
appeared 1 attended that meeting, expecting to
lieai a iepoit of ti e facts called foi by the resolu-
iion npnoiiitin.,' the s ib committee,and to proceed
to execute the duty assigned to us by this House,
by dis uBsing the matters refened to us, and
repoiung the result of our deliberations But
i steid of this a full report is made by the sub-
committee, ocl ipyiu¿ uioie than two hours in
267
reading, and containing facts, opinions, aigu-
ments, and conclusions, accompanied by the bill
which has just been read Ti e reading of this
report occupied the time until a late hour at night,
when it was adopted Yes, sir, this report of the
sub committee, which had occupied them most of
the session to make, and taken more than two
hours to read, ard embracing a great variety of
facts and of statistical tables, was adopted by
the committee by a vote of ten to nine, accoid
ing to my recollection? and that vote taken in
opposition to the wishes of the minority, v.ho
claimed the right before voting to examine the
report In this respect, I consider that injustice
has been done, and that the minority of that com-
mittee have been deprived of their rights No
opportunity was given for the examination or
discussion of the important measure under con-
sideration, and it places the report upon the same
ground that it would have stood, if the mmonty
of ihe commi tee had never been summoned to
attend Jhe meeting It is a me-e mockery to
summon a member of a committee to attend, if
he cannot have the opportunity,when assembled,
of executing, in a free, deliberate, and proper
manner, the duties which are assigned to him, by
his appointment
Mr  D  concluded by moving that the report
and bill be recommitted to the committee
Mr HAWES (thechairman of the select com-
mittee) said this was a most singular proceeding
He thought the House would be of the same '
opinion when the facts should be stated He
would ask if such was the sanctity of this institu-
tion that a committee of twenty four membeis,
selected from each State in the Union, were not at
liberty to make a leport in relation to it' It was
a pait of the Government, and was under the
control of Congress What do we see here' An
objection has been made at the very outset to a
report which he was bold to say would blow the
institution to atoms
In a few days alter the committee was appointed
he had called a meeting of the same     He had sent ,
a summons to every member of the committee,
and if they did not receive them he, at lea^-t, was
innocent    A majority attended the meeting     In !
consequence of the largeness of the committee, it
was deened expedient to appoint a sub committee
o* five,to collect facts and repoit to the committee
Could the gentleman from New Jersey [Mr Dick
ersov] expect tha'th sub committee would leport
the facts withoutexplaming ihem, that thev would
give figures without explaining them'   If he did,
he was a wisei man than he supposed him to be,
and he wou d admit that he was very wise
The sub committee, aftei a laborious investiga-
tion, announced to him (Mr 11 ) that they were
prepared to report He agiun called a meeting of
the committee The meeting took place Ihe
House met at eleven o 'clock ,Tand tor w ant of time
the committee adjiumed to meet at his room at
Crown's on the same evening Each member
was notified to attend A majori'y of the com
mittee accordingly met Thesub committee made
a report, whifh was read The bill was not read
because it was substantially set forth m the con-
clusion of the repoit A proposition was made
by the gentleman from Alabama [Mi LewisI that
the íeport of the sub committee be adopted aathe
report ofth  whole committee This proposition
was discussed fully and freely He recollected
that the gentleman from Missouri [Mr Ashley]
mide two speeches, the gentleman from Ohio,
fVIr AiLE>.,]and the gentleman from Indiana,
I Vh H^wt-Gvi-,] also made speeches Indeed,
he uelieved that all the members present, except
the chairman, took part in the debate Tí e vote
was finally taken, and the leport and bill of the
subcommittee weie adopted—ayes 10, noes 8,
(one membei having left the room ) It was the
pnv lege of every member of a commi tee to be
present at its m etin?s, u they choose The chair
man had no authority to force their attendance
In this instance all were summoned, and nineteen
out of the twenty four att nded The minority
of the coTimutee asked that the report should not
be made forthwith The majority yielded to tn.s
íequest, and they were allowed one more day than
thev requned Under the instructions of the com-
mittee, he should heve reported on yesterday if he
had been pel muted by the House    The minority
had also requested the chairman to furnish them
with the report and doru.uents, foi the purpose,
as he understood, that a review of the repoit might
be prepared He declined furnishing ¡he leport,
buttendered the documents which formed its basis
in order that the minority might, if they thought
proper, draw up a counter report He was told
that a portion of the majority were in favor of
submitting the íeport to the minority, to which he
replied mat, under ihe cucumstances of the case,
he would take the responsibility of withholding it
The^ were ihe facts whicn preceded the report
which he had jjst made, and he would leave it to
the House to t.ay whethei or not the course pur-
sued by the gentleman fiom New Jersey [Mr
DicKER3oti] was not most extraordinary and un-
called for
When Mr HAWES concluded his remarks,
several gentlemen rose to addiess the House, but
further proceedings on the subject weie arrested
by a motion sulmmed by
Mi POLK, to proceed to the consideration of
the ordeis of the day, which was agreed to

The bill to regulate the deposite of the public
moneys ot the United States in certain local banks
was taken up
The qifestion pending was the motion of Mr
Pllmmlk, to leconsidei the vote of the House
adopting tne loltowing ainei dment of Mr Bin vet
to the bill
S like out the second article of the section,and
in lieu theieof insert the follow  g
" To keep in us vaults an amount of specie
' which, together with the balance of all its accounts
' with specie pay ii, banks, shall be equal to cne-
'fi th of the amount ot its notes and bills in c r
'culation, and its public and private deposites "
At the end of tl «. louith ai ic'  of the second
section insert two addinonal articles as follows
" Ptflhly To do and perfuim the duties tf

'pei sation, exceot for the actual cost of books and

'equal to five per centum of its capital actually
'paid in Piovvled, That no interest be pavabie
' when the said aver \ge quart ! ¡y balance does not
' exceed fifty thousand dollars "
Mr POLK (who «as entitled to thefiior) pro-
ceeded to sty that, under existing circumstances,
he should confine what he had to say within aa
brief a space as possible, and pioceed to show the
inexpediency of adopting the amendment in ques-
tion He remarl ed that he had the o her day
d monstrated to some extent that, if the construe
ticn of the gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mr
Biwtv] were to be placed upon the amendment,
it would utteily destroy and break up the whole
system of employing local banks as fiscal agents
ot .he Government in every pait of the country,
except in the ¡aigei cities    In the cities the banks
