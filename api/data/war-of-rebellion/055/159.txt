HDQRS. NINETY-SIXTH REGIMENT ILLINOIS VOL. INFANTRY, Lookout Mountain, Tennessee, November 30, 1863.

LIEUTENANT: Owing to the illness of Colonel Thomas E. Champion, I have made out the following report of the action of the Ninety-sixth Illinois Volunteers since leaving Shelmound, which report is herewith submitted, respectfully:

The regiment left Shellmound with the brigade on the 23d, and took place in the column as rear guard. We arrived within General Hooker's lines at 9 p.m., and encamped for the night. The regiment was in line before daylight of the 24th, and soon afterward followed General Geary's command up the Lookout Valley. We crossed Lookout Creek and ascended the mountain to the base of the cliff, having our position on the right of the third line. We then moved along the mountain side, conforming our movements to those of the preceding lines, and receiving a sharp fire from the enemy's sharpshooters on the cliff above us. About noon we were ordered forward with the Fifty-first Ohio to the support of the first line, and Colonel Champion was placed in command of the two regiments, the undersigned assuming the command of the Ninety-sixth Regiment. Passing through the second line, the regiment advanced until it reached a point just above the white house, near which the Fortieth Ohio was severely pressed. In obedience to prompt orders from Colonel Champion, this regiment was rapidly moved down the side of the mountain to the assistance of the Fortieth Ohio, and poured in on the enemy a hot enfilading fire. The contest was ended almost as soon as begun, the enemy retreating precipitately. The regiment then resumed its former course of march, and proceeded some hundreds of yards, until it reached a point where a portion of General Geary's command was lying in line. Pursuant to orders we halted there, forming on the right of the line. Here for nearly three hours we were engaged with the enemy, but our position was so strong and sheltered that the loss was comparatively light. A regiment was sent to relieve us about 3 o'clock in the afternoon, but took position mainly on our left, and it was not thought advisable to withdraw
