On receipt of your first dispatch this morning I ordered Morgan's force to Point Pleasant. His troops are not absolutely required for defense of Cincinnati.

Major General H. W. HALLECK, General-in-Chief:

General Morgan's forces are at Portland, Ohio, 24 miles form Gallipolis. They arrived without clothes, shoes, ammunition, camp equipage, &amp;c., all of which have been supplied as rapidly as the transportation would permit. The last of these will be sent to-morrow. I have just returned from the various offices, where I went to ascertain personally the cause of delay, and am satisfied it had been unavailable. The river is too low to admit of its being used and the railroad is very deficient
