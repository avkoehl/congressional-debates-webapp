Major G. A. H. BLAKE,

First Dragoons, Commanding Fort Churchill, Nev. Ter.:

SIR: The general commanding the department has had intimation from Captain Hendrickson and other definite sources, as well as from general rumor, of designs on the part of certain persons in the district of country about you, especially at Virginai City, to disturb the peace of this department by acts subversive of the authority of the General Government. These intimations go to the extent of anticipating an attack upon your post, or at least the seizure of public property there or elsewhere. The general does not much credith the existence of any deliberate plan of rthe object stated, though there may be in certain quarters such a disposition; but he deems it proper, nevertheless, that you shall be watchful of the proceedings about you, and fully prepared for any emergency. He wishes also, if the opportunity offers, that you shall, without ostentation or clamor, but in unequivocal terms, let it be understood that the proclamation of the President against unlawful combinations is as binding in this department as elsewhere, and that any attempt to subvert the rights of the people and the just authority of the General Government will be met in a very decided way. You are expected to report with dispatch any important information you may receive in reference to these matters. It is the intention of the general to re-enforce your post withoud delay if you think it necessary.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

D. C. BUELL,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
