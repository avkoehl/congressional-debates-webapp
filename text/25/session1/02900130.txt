Mississippi Election—Air. Pennybacker
Sept. 1837.
H. of Reps.
■words: ""When vacaaucs happen in tV repr sen
taüon fiom any State, the Executive auihony
thereof shall issue writs of elect ori to fill such ta-
vanctes " In Older to arrive at the legitimate in-
terpretation of this section, gentlemen advocating
different sides of ibis perplexed question have had
reference to the thtrd sec ion ot the first article of
the same instrument, which provides tor the filling
of vacancies that may happen in the United States
Senate. They hive a'so lead and commented on
the cases of Lanman and Sevier, and n ist that
thosa casa  are decisive oí the question now under
consideration.
I have taken a different view of th.s subject Let
us for a moment reflect and see xvhat was intended
tobepiovidid for hy each ol those sections, by
vhich means I think we will be enabled to arrive
al the true intent and meaning of the section w h ch
provides for the fil'ing of vacancies in this Hi use,
and in. doing thio, I do not (eel myself called on to
inquire mio the cot redness of the cases lefore re-
ferred to I hold, s r, that the ! tamers of the Con-
stitution did intend that each State should have Us
fall representation in each branch of the Congress
of the United States, and effectually to secure
which, the tw o sections wh'cb. I have adverte I to,
were insette 1, and in each of «Inch the word haj-
ptn is used. The use of this word create  ihe onh
doubt or difficulty in the case Let us compart
the two sections, and see if we can not, by that
means, arrive at ihe sense and meinu g i f the
word happen, which the frameis of that lnsuti-
ment intended it to have Let it Le borne
m mind, that in the case of a Senator, ti e va-
cant y is to be nded, net by an election, tl e
onlv safe and constitutional mode of appointing
members of that body, but by the temporary ep-
pomtmenlof the Governor, to continue only mi il
the Legislature of the St ite shall I e m s ssu n,
when they shall fill such vacancy This, «n, «r
confining a veiy extraoidinary pOwci upon the
Executive oí a Stite, one, in the opinion oi the
framers of the Constitution, veiy unsafe, and
therefore not to be exercised, except on extraordi-
nary oeeassions, and times of great emergency
And, sir, to prevent an abuse of that poxy er by
the Executive att'hotities of the States, ihe fiamtts
of the Constitution have carefully inserted addi-
tional guards to pievent Executive usurpations of
power This, sir, brings us to a more minute and
critical examination and compatison of the two
sections of t>' * C nstitulion now undei considera-
tion
Tlie second secti n, su, simply piovides that if
tacancies skmtld uaii&\ m theieprcscntaiionof any
State, then the Executive theieof shall issue his
writ of ecction to fill such vacancy. In ihe cast
of a Senator, the pioyision is very difTcient It
piorides that ihoitld a vacancy happen, by us\%na-
licn o? othnwtie, m the tecess of Ihe Le¿i$latnic, then
the Executive may appoint, &c
Here, s r, to auihonze the Executive to make an
appointment, lheie mist not onh be a vacancy,
hut tt at y-.cant y mist l ave otcmrui in the recess
of the Legislaniu', and by r si^naiion or oihcr-
w se Permit me to ask yon, Air Speaker, why
these ysni 1, were used m the timet section' Weie
they not used for the puipose ol liinumg and re-
st lUin? ihe pjuci of the Govnnor' anel  .s not
this limitation and this íesliic'ion imposed to pre-
vtiit the fr*qnenui t ora fouerwrifh thefiameis
of Ihe Constiluuon bel e\ed to be safely, and with
moie pronnety, lodged vv ith t eimmediate ropie^en-
tativcsofthe people' Tin , sir, it«eems tome,vill
not be controvetted by any o¡ e Th nthcy ñ ved the
tenure of ihe Senate rul office at m year-- It «as
believed that no vacancy could, e>r would, happen
n the recess of ihe Legislature, excem these pro-
duced by lesigaation, dealb, or removal, and there-
fore tnej mad the power to appoint to be depen-
dent oi tie c<tjse yvhuh policed the vacancy, f>
wit by resijna'ion ciotheiwise. It can not, and
I presura>, will not, be pretended, tmt tie word
"■otherats'," .is used m the stcíioii vu!l have the
effect, or was designed, to destroy the sense and
meaning ot tie woids "by resi<-"at on," but a!'
roust igree that that word v as inscued tocnyei
every possible case where a vacancy occurred by
any unforeseen event, and in the recess of the Le-
" si .ture , a   1, ->ii, I an ijily sus _iped m thiscon-
clus on, by tlu cases x/hicn have  1 ecn refcired to
We come now, Mi Spea' er, to consider more
fully the ^ccoad section of the first article of the
Consti'uticn of the United States Heie we find
no such language to limit and restrict the power of
the G ivernor of a S'ate to issue h s wit to fill a
vacancy m this House, that we find to limit and
r^iinct his power to fill a vacancy in ti e Senate by
his own appointment In the case of a Senator,
sk, I have shown the vacancy is to be tilled, not by
the sare and const>mti >nal mode of an el^ct on, but
by the legíl coas mited authority, giving rise to
an nnceitain and d ngerous exercise of Executive
pationage
How, sir, m relation to filling vacancies xvh ch
occur in 11 s House, is there a e'epartme fre m the
faldamenta! pnncip'es of the Government. In
this case the member is to be e'ected bv the people,
and will any me nber on this floor pretend that Ihe
pe. p'e can not at all time-*, and und i all eucum-
stances, he bust d to choose tl eir own agents to
represeut them in this House
Out, «ir, to return to ihe section undei considera-
tion If the framers of the Constitution intended
to limit the power of the Executive to issue ms
writ of ekc¿ion lo cpseswhei,. the vacancy hpd noi
only happened, but to such vacancies c's 1 ad been
produced hi " lesignaticn or otheiw ise" of ihe m-
com'ent, I isk why they did not so express it by
the.t language, °s thev did m t'e esc of a Sena
toil Sir, the fact of their failing to do so, coupled
v. llh ihe consideration tha there was no good rea-
son vvhv this power should 1 e limited, is c< nc'u-
stve, to rnv mind, that such vyps ar t tneir intention,
?nd I am more in ) n ri io tl is rpimon from the
consideiation tl>at the n eanmj, of ihe vvorrl \anpen,
as u cd in. th s bid or, vas t «uljectof d liben-
tto i v hen the 0< ns'itu ion w ~s framed, and hat t
wis lutcii kd tOiiii h< n/ea c' empower the Execn
tive to iss i lis'ii to eicct on in a i casi s vv heie
a vacancy exi ted in the repusentalion of a &t ,ie
In the cas- of Seialoi, the power of the State
Executive is made to depend in t alone upon the
fact of vacancy, but that lh$t vacancy must have
been produced by a siecified cause There the
Constitution iorks not onlv to the vacancy to be
filled, but also to the cause which produced il In
this case, however, the Consntution looks alone to
the vacancy, and, if it is feund to exist, it provides
the mode and manner by which it is to be filled
This, sir, h is been done in this instance, and in
sit ct t mfoimiiy with the ptovisons of the Con-
stitution
But suppose, li I v as m stake i in this y ievv of
the subject and that it should be believed, as insis-
ted on bv my colleague, (Mr Maury,) that the
second section is to be viewed and inteipreted in
the same Unvted and restucted sense that is embra-
ced in the third section, st 11, sir, if the case of
Sevier is to be received as authority, Messis
Cla'borne and Gholsi n are entitled to their se?ts
' In that case the vac-ncv happened bv the expira-
tion of the 'erm oi serx ice of ihe Senatoi, and that
term was made t) depend upon the a'lotnent of
the Senat r, vvhoh allotmei t and expiration hap-
p ned during the recess of the L"gis|ature, and,
of course w js unfoieserii, and, consequent! , could
not be piovided foi In ihis case, cfse, su, the
Sena'e has made the word "olhtmiie" embrace not
onlv t! e ca es of death oí íemovai, but a7so to em-
brace every possible case of unforeseen vacuity,
although thdt vacancy may hamper bv ihe expira-
tion of the teim of s"ivice What, su, is Ihis case'
The Constitution provides that Congiess ihall cor-
ven  .it least once a year, and that the time of
m« t ng, until otherwise altered by law,s]!all be en
the first Monday of Dccmbei It also authorizes
t' o Eres dent to convene Congress on extiaordinary
oc asions IIeie,sir, the Legidatnie ofMis«issippi,
« uh a full iiiou le Ije that Congress vt as not to mnet
on'il the mrnlh of Tieeer)!  r, h id fixe 1 by law tl e
day of clectii a in tie momh of November, in
amp!" ti op for their members to amve n time to
tike the r v^a's on the fist day of the se sion
E it s r, i" the mild of the Piesident of the Umted
S' tes, Congress ought to be convem-d to consiele"
of and act upon weighty and important business
of ihe nation, at an earlier day than that fixed by
the Constitution, and he accordingly is sues his
proclamation for t'-at purpose Did the Legislature
of Mississ ppi know that the President wouid issue
his proclamation' Could they have known of
those extraoulmary events which rendered it neces-
sary for him to do so, oí were not those circum-
stances which rende1 ed the filling of the vacancies
of the repre-entdtion fiom that State at an earlier
period than that fixed by the Constitution, and were
not all these circumstances unforeseen by them'
If so, su, then acct rdtng to the strictest construc-
tion contended for, those gentlemen are entitled to
their seats
But, Mi Speaker, it is contended by the gentle-
man iiom Kentucky, that fot as much as the Con-
sntution icquires mat the Legislatures oi the States
should fix the t meo and places ofholding election',
th?t this election is vi d, 1 eca>i--e the Legislature
oi Mississippi had not bv l?w fixed the day on
w inch this election v as he'd as the day of election
oi their íepieseatativesto th s Hott'e This argu-
ment, si, if it piov e> any ihmg, it proves too much;
for, sir, if no elect en biu those held on the
days fixed by law aie lega!, then, sir, if a
seat was v jcated,ciihei bv lesignatun, o, death,or
reniova!, the Executive of tt c&a'ei ou'd have no
pcmti to issue his writ of election t^ hi such va-
cancy, because he would havero powci'u pre-
scribe the time of hoVmg t e same This general
pioyision of the Constitution, and the laws enacted
in pnisuance thereof, were on'y inttrded to regu-
late the time, place, and manner of conducung the
geneial electicn , and was not intended to inter-
fere vi nh or io abi due the povvei in those «pecial
cases, piovi led for in the section under which tins
e eetion vvps ' eid
M Speakei, Permit me here to admonish gen-
tlemen to pause an I red 'ct L"t -e they gp e their
xo'es, deny n« to the reopl  ol Mississippi the right
to bf re i tit d en lh Ho >r auaht su,which has
been s(<.iii->d 'o lien by t at ins'iument which
g ves lut a  d ex s'ence to this Government, and
winch, sir,each ol us stands most solemnly p'edged
to suppoit I am one of those, su, who believe that
the people aie capable of self government, and that
they ccn, and ought to be, trusted at all times, and
undei all circum tances and when I am called on
to give a construction to the great chai ter of our
libetttes, I shall endeavor to a lopt that rule of m-
terpietatton which wdi best secme to the great
mass of the people their full privileges and powers,
aid knov mg, as I do, that ihe Stale oi Mississippi
has an widen at'e right tohpr rtprecentationm this
House, and lelie msr that her late election xvas at
least authorised by the spirit and meaning of the
Constitution, and also by its letter, I v nl, sir, unless
the reasons w inch has brought my mind to this con-
clusion, shall be met and confuted, vote foi a con-
ciurence m the rcpott upon join table
