Major ECKERT:

It is necessary to send telegrams to General Lockwood unless they interest his command.

HARPER'S FERRY, W. VA.,

January 1, 1864 - 10. 30 a. m. (Received 11. 45 a. m.)

Brigadier-General CULLUM,

Chief of Staff:

Captain Bailey, of the First New York Cavalry, has returned, reporting a force of cavalry in Winchester, and he supposed a force of infantry near. It was so dark he could obtain no news that would give him an opportunity to judge of their numbers.

J. C. SULLIVAN,

Brigadier-General.

HARPER'S FERRY, W. VA.,

January 1, 1864 - 1 p. m. (Received 4. 20 p. m.)

Brigadier-General CULLUM,

Chief of Staff:

The scare at Martinsburg was occupied by a scouting party, who saw but few rebels, yet learned from prisoners that about 1,000 cavalry were approaching. My forces are distributed as follows: Martinsburg, 3,000; Charlestown, 800; cavalry between Charleston and Bunker Hill, 800; cavalry, with infantry ready to support, from this place, 800. I am not strong enough in infantry here to attempt to get in their rear. Orders have been given to Martinsburg to drive the force below Winchester.

J. C. SULLIVAN,

Brigadier-General.

General-in-Chief.

(Received 5. 20 p. m.)

Brigadier General G. W. CULLUM,

Chief of Staff:

I can learn nothing that need cause any apprehension. I believe a scare of pickets only has produced this excitement. Trains run regularly, and nothing can be found of any enemy by my forces from Charlestown.

J. C. SULLIVAN,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
