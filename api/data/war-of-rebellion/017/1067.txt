Major-General BURNSIDE:

Have just received orders from General Pope to move Sykes to-morrow to within 2 miles of Warrenton, and to call up more to same point, leaving the fords guarded by the cavalry. He says the troops in rear should be brought up as rapidly as possible, leaving only a small rear guard at Rappahannock Station, and that he cannot see how a general engagement can be put off more than a day or two. I shall move up as ordered, but the want of grain, and the necessity of receiving a supply of subsistence, will cause some delay. Please hasten back the wagons sent down, and inform McClellan, that I may know that I am doing right. Banks is at Fayetteville; McDowell, Sigel, and Ricketts
