ADVANCED BEYOND THE WOODS IN FRONT OF THE TOWN, AND WAS ENGAGED WITH A CONFEDERATE BATTERY. GENERAL PLEASONTON HAVING SENT FOR ANOTHER SECTION, I ORDERED THE WHOLE BATTERY FORWARD, AND CAME INTO ACTION ON THE RIGHT OF LIEUTENANT MEINELL. AFTER A HOT CANNONADING OF A LITTLE OVER HALF AN HOUR, THE LIMBER CASE OF ONE OF THE ENEMY'S GUNS WAS BLOWN UP BY A PERCUSSION SHELL FROM THIS BATTERY, WHEN THEY MOVED OFF TASTILY, LEAVING BEHIND ONE GUN AND ITS LIMBER, THE HORSES OF WHICH HAD BEEN DISABLED BY THE EXPLOSION OF THE AMMUNITION CHEST. THE BATTERY IMMEDIATELY ADVANCED, TAKING UP NEW POSITIONS, AND ENGAGING THE ENEMY IN HIS NEXT POSITION, FROM WHICH HE HAD AGAIN OPENED FIRE. THE ENEMY WAS DRIVEN FROM THIS POSITION AS BEFORE, LEAVING 1 MAN DEAD ON THE GROUND, HORRIBLY MANGLED, AND TRACES OF BLOOD WHERE THEY HAD CARRIED OFF THEIR WOUNDED, TO TESTIFY TO THE ACCURACY OF OUR FIRE. THE BATTERY WAS ALSO ENGAGED AT GOOSE CREEK, UPPERVILLE, AND NEAR THE ENTRANCE TO ASHBY'S GAP. AT THE LATTER PLACE IT REMAINED IN POSITION UNTIL AFTER DARK, IN ADVANCE OF ALL BUT OUR PICKETS, WHEN IT WAS WITHDRAWN TO UPPERVILLE FOR THE NIGHT, AND RETURNED NEXT DAY TO ALDIE. ON THIS OCCASION OUR LOSS WAS 1 MAN KILLED BY A ROUND SHOT, AND 3 WOUNDED BY THE ACCIDENTAL EXPLOSION OF AN AMMUNITION CHEST. WE CAPTURED FROM THE BATTERY WHICH ENGAGED US ONE IRON RIFLED GUN (BLAKELY'S PATENT), LIMBER, AND CAISSON. THE GUN WAS TURNED OVER BY THE BATTERY TO THE QUARTERMASTER AT FAIRFAX STATION FOR TRANSPORTATION TO WASHINGTON, D. C., AS A TROPHY. THIS GUN THREW A PROJECTILE WEIGHING 16 OR 17 POUNDS WITH GREAT FORCE AND PRECISION. IT WAS STAMPED WITH THE DATE 1862, AND WAS MADE IN LIVERPOOL, ENGLAND. IT IS SUPERIOR TO OUR 3-INCH ORDNANCE GUN IN EVERY RESPECT. ON JUNE 26, WE MARCHED TO LEESBURG, AND ON THE 27TH CROSSED THE POTOMAC AT EDWARDS FERRY. THE SAME NIGHT MARCHED ON, REACHING FREDERICK CITY, MD., ABOUT NOON ON THE 28TH. THE SAME DAY THE BATTERY WAS ORDERED TO MOVE WITH THE CAVALRY TO MEET STUART'S CAVALRY, THEN MOVING TOWARD WASHINGTON. THE BATTERY MARCHED TO RITCHIEVILLE, REMAINED ALL NIGHT ON THE ROAD IN POSITION UNTIL THE NEXT NIGHT (29TH), WHEN WE MARCHED ALL NIGHT, REACHING WESTMINSTER EARLY IN THE MORNING OF THE 30TH. AFTER A FEW HOURS' REST, THE BATTERY MARCHED TO MANCHESTER, AND ENCAMPED. ON THE SUCCEEDING MORNING, JULY 1, WE MARCHED FOR YORK, PA. ON ARRIVING WITHIN A FEW MILES OF THAT TOWN, WE WERE ORDERED BACK TO MANCHESTER. ON THE NIGHT OF JULY 3, THE BATTERY MARCHED FOR EMMITSBURG, MD., ARRIVING THERE ON JULY 4, AND IMMEDIATELY RECEIVED ORDERS TO JOIN KILPATRICK'S DIVISION OF CAVALRY. THIS DIVISION WAS ACCOMPANIED BY TWO FRESH BATTERIES, AND WAS ITSELF COMPOSED OF CAVALRY WITH FRESH HORSES. AT 6 P. M. LEFT EMMITSBURG. JULY 4, CROSSED THE MOUNTAINS A LITTLE TO THE NORTH OF EMMITSBURG, REACHING THE MONTEREY HOUSE, ON THE SUMMIT OF THE MOUNTAINS, AT MIDNIGHT AND IN A DRENCHING RAIN-STORM. THE CAVALRY PASSED DOWN THE MOUNTAIN, CAPTURING PRISONERS AND DESTROYING WAGONS WITHOUT MUCH RESISTANCE FROM THE ENEMY. THE DIVISION AND BATTERIES PUSHED ON TO SMITHSBURG, OR CAVETOWN, ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MOUNTAINS, REACHING THAT PLACE AT ABOUT NOON ON THE 5TH. THIS BATTERY TOOK POSITION ON A HILL TO THE NORTH OF THE TOWN. THE ENEMY HAD CLOSELY FOLLOWED US ALL NIGHT, CAPTURING OUR STRAGGLERS, BUT DID NOT APPEAR IN FORCE UNTIL AFTER 4 O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON, WHEN A COLUMN OF CONFEDERATE CAVALRY CAME OUT IN SIGHT TO THE NORTH OF SMITHSBURG. I FIRED THREE CASE SHOT AT THEM WITH EFFECT, AS
