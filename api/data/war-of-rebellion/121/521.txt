Honorable EDWIN M. STANTON, Secretary of War:

Since the resumption of exchanges we have received about 34,000 returned Union prisoners. There were estimated to be about 11,000 to be returned. These were to be delivered at points on the Atlantic and the Mississippi River, but the actual delivery has not been under our control, and it has only through newspapers that we have understood that about 5,000 were to be delivered at Darien, Ga. They, when delivered, were to be sent to Camp Parole, at Annapolis, Md., under the direction of the commanding officer at Darien. They have not yet been reported as delivered even at Darien.
