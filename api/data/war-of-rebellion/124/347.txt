Colonel CONRAD BAKER,

Acting Assistant Provost-Marshal-General, Indianapolis:

Is the report of difficulty in Rush County true as given in the papers? Give me the facts and state what action has been taken.

Provost-Marshal-General.

INDIANAPOLIS, June 12, 1863.

Colonel JAMES B. FRY:

It is true that one officer was killed and another mortally wounded. The murder was committed by only two men ambushed in a wheat field. Two companies of infantry and one of cavalry were immediate sent with district provost-marshal, under judicious officers. Two mn have been arrested, and there is strong circumstantial evidence of their guilt. [All] is now quiet. Enrollment in that region progressing peaceably. The military will remain there until it is completed. Letter by mail.

Acting Assistant Provost-Marshal-General.

STATE OF INDIANA, OFFICE ACTG. ASSISTANT PROVOST-MARSHAL-GENERAL,

Indianapolis, June 12, 1863.

Colonel JAMES B. FRY,

Provost-Marshal-General:

SIR: Since telegraphing you to-day three men charged with the murder in Rush County were brought to this city by provost- marshal of the Fourth District and surrendered to the U. S. marshal.

Affidavits have been filed with the district attorney charging them with obstructing the enrolling officer. I suggested to the district attorney that affidavits charging them with murder should be prepared, so that if they give bail in the Federal court they may immediately be arrested for murder on process issued by State tribunal.

Craycraft, one of the men who was shot and said to be mortally wounded, is still living, and I understand there is hope of his recovery.

The enrollment has been completed in the sub-district in which the murder was committed. The danger was that the truly loyal citizens would take the law in their own hands, but moderation prevailed, and I hope the danger from this quarter has ceased to exist.

I have the honor to be, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

CONRAD BAKER,

Acting Assistant Provost-Marshal-General for Indiana.
