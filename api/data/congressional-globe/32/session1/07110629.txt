Mr. WALKER presented the memorial of John
H. Sherburne, submitting a plan to save property
and life by means of a floating anchorage or break-
water on the lakes. The memorialist states that in
view of the immense loss on the lakes, amounting
to over two millions of dollars m property and six
hundred human lives, he submits a plan by which
this immense amount of loss of property and
human life may in future be mainly if not wholly !
obviated at a cost of much less than one eighth of !
the above amount. The plan consists of a 4 4 Float-
ing Breakwater or Safety Anchorage," which
can be completed and placed in the harbors of
Oswego, Buffalo, Dunkirk, Cleveland, Chicago,
and Milwaukie, in the short space of three months.
Accompanying the petition is a letter signed by

and L. 11. Colton, Esq., United Slates Marshal,
expressive of their approbation of the plan,
recommending a trial of it by the Government]#

The memorial having been read,
Mr. WALKER. 1 move to refer these papers
to the Committee on Commerce, and ask that
Colonel Sherburne may have an opportunity of
submitting his plan to them at as early day as
may suit the convenience of the committee. For ;
my own part, it has impressed me very favorably, j
I believe he has discovered what will be of vast j
importance, and 1 am very confident that if his i
plan should be adopted on the lakes, it would be '
one of the best things that could be adopted for j
the security of life and property. '
The motion to refer was agreed to. 1
Mr. liAMLIN. I present a memorial very ,
numerously signed by citizens of the State of j
Maine, remonstrating against the extension of the '
patent granted to Austin and Zebuion Parker, for ;
improvements in water-wheels. The Committee :
on Patents have already reported a bill renewing !
that patent. This is a question in which all who !
are engaged in the mill interests in the State of s
Maine are much concerned; and they aver in this ,
memorial, that years before the original letters j
patent were granted to Zebuion Parker these i
wheels were in use in their mills. I ask that this <
remonstrance may be referred to the Committee ,
on Patents, giving notice that when the bill shall |
come'up, I shall move to recommit it to the Com- 1
mittee on Patents, in order that these remonstrants ij
may be fairly heard. I will move now that the
bill be taken up with a view to recommitment. ji
The motion vas agreed to; and the bill, with ||
