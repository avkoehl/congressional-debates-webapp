say of two years, the privilege to. use steam
over the line where it has been used for the
last three years; and within those two years
I have no doubt we shall pass a bill authoriz-
ing a tunnel, because they can make it per-
fectly secure, and within that time perhaps
they may complete the tunnel east of the
Capitol.
Mr. FESSENDEN. Why not pass the tun-
neling bill, and in that bill tell them they
must have their tunnel done in a certain time,
and until that time expires they may use this
crossing?
Mr. HENDERSON. I have no objection
to that course of proceeding.
Mr. FESSENDEN. Then you would make
one dependent on the other.
Mr. HENDERSON. I have no charge of
this bill.
Mr. FESSENDEN. Your committee has
charge of the question.
Mr. HENDERSON. It is as the Senator
from Maine [Mr. Morrill] may see fit in regard

shall pass that bill. It was put in my charge.

up another.

freedmen's bureau.
Mr. LAFLIN introduced the following reso-
lution. upon which he demanded the previous
question;
Resolved, That the Commissioner of the Bureau of
Freedmen, Retugees, and Abandoned Lands be di-
rected to communicate to this House the reports
recently made concerning the action of the bureau
by Generals Steedman and Fullerton and by Gen-
erals Whittlesey and Sewell and such other reports
recently made and not heretofore communicated to
Congress as may be in the possession of that bureau.
The SPEAKER. This being a call for ex-
ecutive information, it requires unanimous con-
sent for its consideration to-day.
Mr. LE BLOND. I desire to move an
amendment to the resolution. I desire to have
these reports published in connection with the
testimony taken by the reconstruction com-
mitee, that they may go to the country for
what they purport to be.
Mr. LAFLIN. It would be impossible to
have that done now, because the printing of
the report of the reconstruction committee is
in such a condition that it would be impossible
to do it.
Mr. LE BLOND. I ask if the report of the
committee on reconstruction has been pub-
lished.
Mr. LAFLIN. It has not yet been delivered,
but it is in print.
The SPEAKER. The Chair would state
that if the resolution gives rise to debate it
goes over under the rule.
Mr. LE BLOND. I simply wish to say that
mv understanding is that the report is being
printed, but that it is in that condition that the
reports of these generals can be added to it,
and it ought to go to the country in that shape.
Mr. LAFLIN. I demand the previous
question.
Mr. RANDALL, of Pennsylvania. I desire
to know if an objection does not make this
resolution go over.
The SPEAKER. It would not do so now.
The resolution has been debated since it was
introduced, and it is too late to make the point.
The previous question was seconded and the
main question ordered; and under the oper-
ation thereof the resolution was agreed to.
Mr. ELIOT moved to reconsider the vote by
which the resolution was adopted ; and also
moved that the motion to reconsider be laid
upon the table.
The latter motion was agreed to.
