States of America, approved February 28, 1861, the Secretary of the Treasury did proceed to offer $5,000,000 of said loan, conformably to the provisions of said act;

And whereas, in many portions of the Confederate States the currency was and is composed of notes of banks which have suspended specie payment, not of necessity, but as a measure of public policy;

And whereas, certain of said banks did agree to redeem in coin or its equivalent such of their notes as should be paid in by subscribers to said loan;

And whereas, the Secretary of the Treasury, in view of the exigencies of the times and with a desire to give to the people of all parts of the Confederate States the opportunity of subscribing to said loan, did authorize the loan commissioners to receive the notes of the banks hereinbefore referred to; and to avoid inconvenience and the risk of transit, has authorized the said loan commissioners to deposit the moneys received by them in said banks: Now, therefore,

The Congress of the Confederate States of America do enact, That all of the acts and doings of the Secretary of the Treasury, of his subordinate officers, and of the loan commissioners, consistent with the facts recited in the foregoing preamble, are hereby confirmed and made valid, any law, usage, or custom to the contrary notwithstanding; and the said Secretary, his subordinate officers, and the loan commissioners, are hereby authorized to continue so to act in regard to the said loan, until the whole amount authorized by said act shall have been fully subscribed for, and their duties regarding the same shall have determined; and the said Secretary is authorized to make and continue the deposits of moneys received or to be received on account of the said loan in any of the said banks; and the Treasurer of the Confederate States is authorized to draw checks or warrant on said banks on account of said deposits, payable either in coin or its equivalent, or in curren the Secretary of the Treasury may direct.
