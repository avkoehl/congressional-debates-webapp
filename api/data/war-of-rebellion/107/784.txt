HARPER'S FERRY, September 3, 1862.

Major-General WOOL,

Baltimore:

I have every thing in readiness for any demonstration of the enemy. General White evacuated his fortifications at Winchester last night, destroyed what he could not bring away, spiked those big guns, and, as I anticipated, left them. Part of the general's men, guard, sick, and baggage have arrived. He is at Summit Point. I have ordered troops on Winchester road to this place, and remnant of Cole's cavalry back to Berlin to cross Potomac and watch the enemy. We want forage and our requisitions for ordnance filled.

D. S. MILES,

Colonel Second Infantry.
