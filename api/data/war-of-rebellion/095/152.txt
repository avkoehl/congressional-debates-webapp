HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,February 6, 1865 - 7.15 a. m.

Major-Generals Warren and Humphreys have both telegraphed me this morning, and inform me of their being in position, their right, well supported, near Fort Cummings, and two divisions of the Fifth Corps over Hatcher's Run forming their left. Gregg's cavalry is now with Warren. Trains all came up the Vaughan road. I have telegraphed to them to move out at once to determine whether or not Hill's or any portion of the enemy's force is now outside of their line of works. In case any should be found they are to be driven in. Heath charged in two lines, and was badly repulsed. Subsequently the whole of Hill's corps participated in the attack. The above is the report of deserters.

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,Hatcher's Run, February 6, 1865 - 7.30 p. m.

(Via Aiken's House, 8.40 p. m.)

Major-General Warren advanced about 2 p. m. on the Dabney's Mill and Vaughan roads. Both columns had a spirited contest with the enemy, and steadily drove him before them till about 6 p. m., when the column on the mill road, having forced the enemy beyond Badney's Mill and until he opened on them with artillery, indicating he was in his line of works, when, being re-enforced, Warren's troops were, in turn, compelled to retire in considerable confucian. The enemy was, however, checked before reaching the position occupied this morning, and Warren's troops rallied in this position. The column on the Vaughan road was recalled when the others were forced back. The troops are now formed in the lines occupied this morning. The fighting has been determined, principally in dense woods, and the losses considerable, particularly in the column compelled to retire. I am not able at present to give an estimate of them.
