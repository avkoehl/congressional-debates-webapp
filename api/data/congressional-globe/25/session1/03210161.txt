positories, we must review the whole history of its
operations. And here I might appeal to the Sena-
tor from Missouri, (Mr Benton,) who was the
zealous champion of this system at a period when
its capacities were put to the severest test, if it did
not then give the amplest proofs of its usefulness
and efficiency. I refer to the memorable struggle
of 1834, when the Bank of the United States, en-
raged by the loss of the public depositee, and
stimulated by the desire of regaining them, waged
^open and violent war on these State institutions—
•when some of the State banks iherrselves, coerced
cor subsidized by the Bank of the United States,
joined in the unnatural and fratricidal conflict—
•when the eloquence of his body was thundering
«pon the system, and the aitillery of the press at
the same ,time pouring in its unrelenting and de-
structive fire. Did not these abused institutions
then give triumphant evidence alike of their strength
and their fidelity, and bear the country and them-
selves harmless through the conflict 1 There can
be but one answer to the question.
In reference to the stirring and important events
of that day, I will say, that no one more heartily
approved the conduct of the late Executive in re-
moving the public deposites from the Bank of the
United States than I did. I believed that the bank
Trad not on'y failed n the prompt and faithful dis-
charge of its fiscal duties to the G-oveu ment, but,
in one instance particularly, that it had balked and
counteracted the execution of a great measure of
public policy. It had, moreover, manifested a
dangerous spirit of ambition by an active interfe-
rence in the politics of the country. I held, there-
fore, the conduct of the late President, m the re-
moval of the public depositee from the Bank of the
United States, perfectly justifiable , and I viewed
it with the more satisfaction, because, believing the
institution uselfto be unconstitutional, I saw in
•the measure of the Pres dent ihe most certain
«leans of preventing its recharter But while I
considered the removal of the public deposites, un-
der the circumstances of the case, lawful, justifiable,
and proper, it was evidently a bold measure, and
not without hazard of disturbing, for a time, the
business and pecuniary interests of the country.
It was the firm, judicious, and patriotic conduct of
the selected State banks, sustained, as they then
were, by the prudent confidence of the Govern-
ment, that mitigated, and, m a great degree, obvia-
ted the threatened pressure, and ultimately recon-
ciled the public mind to this bold and decisive
measure of State pohev I little supposed, while >
the Government v as thus leaning on these State
institutions for co-operation and support, that they,
too, in their turn, were destined for the sacrifice ,
and that the only favor they v, ere to expect was
the Cyclops' boo  to Ulysses—that of " being last
devoured."
But, sir, not to dwell, in particular, on the suc-
cess and services of the deposite banks in that peí íod
of tual and danger, let us mqune what have been
their general conduct and efficiency Have we not
seen the satisfactory manner in which they have .
discharged their duties as fiscal agents of the Go-
vernment, year after year, made the subject of the
warmest eulogies in the anaaal messages of the
President, and the leports of the Secretary of the
Treasuiy, and put in striking and advantageous
contrast with the operations of the Bank of the
Unued States' In the -very last menage of the
late President, (m December last,) m bearing his
testimony to the promptitude and regularity «vith
which the tiansfers of the public monejs had been
made by the deposite banks, he 'howed that the
amount of these transfers duung the preceding
year (about forty million of dollar,) was more than
double the largest sum which had ever been trans-
ferred during an equal period by the Bank of the
United States , and all this had b  n effected with-
out the smallest expense or co t to the Government
At the same time he states that an anount of do-
mestic exchanges had been negotiated by the banks
for the public exceeding more than three times the
operations of the Bank of the United States, in the
same way, during an equal period of time, and
generally at rates below tho=e charged by th-t in-
stitution. What more could be expected or de-
sired 1   And what does the Secretary of the Trea-
sury mow tell us as to these deposite banks' That
their condition, m regard to the great elements of
soundness, was never better than at present; that,
in a comparative view of their means and liabili-
ties, both immediate and ultimate, the proportion of
the foi mer to the latter is considerably increased,
and is now much greater than has been customary
with the banks of this country, or evens with the
Bank of England, that, since the suspension of
specie payments, they have paid the drafts and ac-
counts of the Treasury upon them to the amount of
■ between fifteen and twenty millions, m a manner
acceptable to the holders ; that there remains now
but a comparatively small sum due from them to
the Government; and that of that sum there is no
reason to apprehend the loss of a single dollar
In the presence of these facts, with what pro-
priety can it be said that the State bank deposite
system has failed? If a temporaiy suspension of
specie payments, under most extraordinary circum-
stances, constitutes a failure of a system, then the
national bank sj stem and the hard money system
have equally failed. I say the national bank sys-
tem, because the Pennsylvania Bank of the United
States, (which w e all know suspended specie pay-
ments at the same t'ine with the deposite and other
State banks,) we have the authori'v of its President
foi «aying, possessed all the strength and jeal ad-
ían tages under its charter from the State of Penn-
sylvania that it did under its chaiter from the
United States. If it had been a national, instead of
a State institution, it wou'd equally have suspended
specie payments, under the extraordinary circum-
stances of the crisis And has not the hard money
system, it we apply the same test, also failed"!
Where now is all that boasted abundance of gold
and silver which, we were told, was to ovei-pread
and rejoice the land ' Do you see a dollar of it in
circulation, performing its true office of effecting
payments 1.1 the business of the country' No, sir
all, all has disappeared.
If, then, the State bank deposite system has
failed, the other systems, proposed by one par'y or
another to be substituted for it, ara equally demon-
strated to have failed. But, sir, this S3'Stem has
not failed. The banks have been embarrassed and
momentarily obstrucled in sime of their functions,
by circumstances which have embairassed and de-
ranged the whole commercial world. If thev have
bent, for a time, beneath a tornado which has
swept over the g'obe, it is only that they may rise
a«am, and resume their eiectness and vigor, when
trie fun  of the st rm is spent
But, superadded to thes  geneial causes of em-
bamssinent, theie hive been pe"uliar and extraoi-
dinary causes operating here, (most of them origi-
nating m the errors of our public policy,) which
have mainly contributed to the recent disaster, and
which, being such as will not occur, or may be
guarded against in future, prove nothing against
the system itself. Some of these anomalous and
disturbing causes I will briefly advert to and first,
to that en-Jimons surplus revenue which we per-
mitted to giov up, under our own improvident
legislation Tony millions of public money were
thus thiovvii into the banks, upon which ihey were
not merely authorised, but invited, to found new
discounts and accommodations to the public. It
was a virtual addition of so much to the capitals
of the banks, by act of the Government itself,
which naturally led to an increase and dangerous
expansion of their business But, sn, another dre-
tiubing cause, n it less mischievous m its operation,
has been the factitious importation of gold and
silv ei into the country, during the last three or four
years It i<¡ estimated that the quantitv of the pre-
cious metals m the country has been increased in
•hat time, undei the various provocatives adminis-
tered in one way or another, neaily another sum
of forty million^ This enormous augmentation
of the precious metals has been the subject of
much inconsiderate exultation; but, m truth, sir,
i* has been one of the most efficient causes of the
piesent deiangement of oui curiency. What be-
came of all this gold and silvei, as it was brought
into the countr* t It could not enter mto circula-
tion, because the channels of circulation were al-
ready occupied by the smaller bank notes, whi^h
vv e have seen, will invariably exclude coins of the
same denominations. It went, then, to enlarge
the specie basis of the banks, and for every hard
dollar they thus acquired they put out, in the usual
ratio of their circulation to their spec.e, three or
four paper dollars
Gentlemen who have patronized this artificial
importation of gold and silver, with a view to en-
large the metallic circulation, and restoreihe " con-
stitutional currencv," have committed a great mis-
take They began at the w  o>ig end They Should
have first provided foi the suppression of small
notes, and then the gold and silver, as they came
into the country, would at once have entered into
circulation. But, brought into the country as they
were in laige quantities, before any opening was
made for their circulation by the previous suppres-
sion of the small notes, they accumulated m banks,
where they furnished the basis of new issues and
discounts, and thus formed one of the chief causes
of that undue distension of the paper system, which
terminated in the recent catastrophe.
I have already alluded, Mr. President, to a mea-
sure, Ihe protracted continuance of which had, in
my opinion, no small agency m producing the sus-
pension of specie payments by the banks I mean
the specie circulai It has been common to as-
sume the amount of specie paid into the land offices
as ihe Hue ireasure of the opeiation of that Older.
Bnt this is a %eiy fallacious and inadequate view
of the subject What is called Land office money,
oi money receivable in payment for the public
lands, is the universal standard of the currency in
the west. In all private payments and transac-
tions, it is the sort of money that is requ red.
When, therefore, bv the specie circular, convertible
bank notes, however sound, were no longer receiv-
able in payment for public lands, and gold and sil-
ver were made the onlv Land office money, every
body wanted gold and silvei This necessarily
<rave use to extensive demands upon the banks m
that portion of the Union for specie, which they
provided foi by drawing large supplies from the
east But this was not all. All persons emi-
grating to the west, whether they intended to buy
public land  or net, felt it necessary to provide
themselves with Land office money—the general and
standard currencv of the country to which they
were going The ordinary preparation for removal
was first to convert all the bank notes held by them.
into gold and silver. This, I know, has beets exten-
sively the case m Virginia, for many of my fnends
and neighbors have recently m grated to the west,
and m every case they h~\e gone to the banks,
whose paper the) held, to exchange it for specie.
The same thing has, doubtless, occurred in, every
poition of the Union whence emigiations have
taken place io the west. I have 1 een informed,
particulaily, that it was so m the northern and
eastern States—that great hive which has poured
forth so many swarms of useful and enterprising
citizens to people and subdue the western forest.
Gentlemen who represent those States here can
conect me, if my information has been erroneous.
These multiplied and extensive calls for specie,
resulting fiom the direct and indirect opera'ion of
the Treasury order, mu«t have produced av ery se-
rious piessure upon the b?nks throughout the coun-
ti v, but especially in the Atlantic cities It was a
sudden and unnatural displacement of the precious
metals, which could not fail to give a violent shock
to ihe whole S3 stem of bank credit founded upon
them But when the Government announced its
final determination to continue this specie circular
as the permanent policy of the coiintiy, the blow
w as decisive and fatal In the permanent and m-
■ discriminate refusal of the notes of all banks in the
laigest branch o! the public revenue, an official
discredit was s'amped by the Government upon
bank paper, which, in the critical state to which it
had already been brought bv the circular, it could
not suiuve. Public confidence was shaken, dis-
trust and panic were produced, systematic runs
upon the banks commenced; under which, what-
ever then ultimate ability, they were forced to suc-
cumb for the time
I know, sir, that this catastrophe has been some-
times, in particular quarters, at ubuted to the trans-
fers of public money under the deposite apt. gut
if the specie circular had not been issued, and that
