Brigadier General J. T. BOYLE, Louisville:

Send me your re-enforcements via Cumberland River. Let me know when they can get to Louisville, or, if you can, send them by rail to the gap in the road, and march them across thence to Munfordville, thence by rail here. I thank you for prompt care of me and mine. Hope you will soon open the road.

HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND, Murfreesborough, January 6, 1863.

Major-General WRIGHT, Cincinnati:

I did not write you because I was too busy, and uncertain of the result of the battle. It is now evident that their loss was excessive. Their own officers and men estimate their loss at from 13,000 to 15,000. I now wish to push them to the wall, but the pursuit will be heavy work. Send me what force you can spare, and take care of the railroad. I will write you soon. I congratulate you on the success of the Carter expedition, and the final expulsion of John H. Morgan. I wish you would get ready a large lot of saddles and horses, and mount your infantry to pursue him the next time he makes a raid.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.
