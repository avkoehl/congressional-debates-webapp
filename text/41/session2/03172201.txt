1870.
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

understanding and appreciating the extent of
every interest in the country it would have
been a remarkable fact.
I desire as briefly as possible to refer to an
interest which has to some degree been for
years protected by a provision of the existing
law, yet in point of fact its protection has been
chiefly due to the financial condition of the
country since 1880. My purpose in doing so
at the present time is to prepare the minds of
members for an amendment which I propose
to offer to the bill when it is under consider-
ation in the committee of the whole House. It
is well known that only five minutes are allowed
in explaining an amendment offered while the
bill is being considered by sections; conse-
quently all the information which members
possess as a general thing is obtained from its
discussion under that rule, which is often insuf-
ficient for a correct understanding of the inter-
est affected. I intend at the proper time to
offer an amendment to increase the rate of
duty on crockery, which is classed in the tariff
bills in the clause, " On all earthen, stone, or
crockery wares," to 50 per cent, ad valorem,
which will be an increase of 10 per cent, over
the present rate of duty. Under the present
law it is 40 per cent, ad valorem. I am satis-
fied that the facts in regard to this interest will
justify the adoption of this amendment by the
committee.
When the tariff bill of the Thirty-Ninth Con-
gress was under consideration by the Senate a
similar amendment was proposed to that bill
by Senator Fessenden, and was unanimously
agreed to by the Senate. If that bill had be-
come a law the rate of duty on earthen, stone,
and crockery wares would have been what my
proposition will now make it. I think I can
show if there was any necessity for additional
protection of this interest at that time there
is more than five times such necessity at the
present time. The facts were not probably
brought to the attention of the Committee of
Ways and Means, and it may not be generally
known to the members of this House that the
potteries of the United States constitute an
important manufacturing interest. Previous
to the_war the potteries of the United States
were limited both in number and capacity, and
had never challenged any particular atten-
tion ; and this fact was due to a number of rea-
sons ; but they were largely increased both in
number and capacity by the stimulus of unpre-
cedented protection during the years of the war.
It is said, ar.d it may be justly claimed, that
the development and success of this important
manufacturing interest are the results of the
war, the high and unexampled price of gold at
that time being equivalent to additional tariff
protection, which encouraged and developed
this interest, causing establishments for the
manufacture of this ware to spring up all over
the United States. They are no longer insig-
nificant and unknown, but have entered so
vigorously into competition with the great pot-
teries of England that their opposition has
been both felt and feared. But the protection
afforded by the high price of gold is taken
from them as gold approaches par, and the
result has been to leave them weak and unable
to compete with the English in a business that
has for its heaviest items of cost of production
labor and.coal; and this is one of the reasons
that the parties engaged in this manufacture, in
order to keep their business in successful oper-
ation, are compelled to ask for an additional rate
of duty. The growth both in numbers and
capacity during the last ten years of the pot-
teries in the United States has been remark-
able. 1 find by reference to the census of
1860 the ioilowing facta in regard to the pot-
teries established in the United States at that
time, to which I desire to invite attention :

The foregoing table shows the number of
potteries, where located, the capital invested,
amount of raw material, hands employed, an-
nual cost of labor, and the annual value of the
products in 1860; and it also clearly shows that
this manufacture is not confined to any one
locality, and never has been. In 1800, when
this interest in the United States was in its
infancy, potteries were established in twenty-
eight States, and probably as the present time
every State in point of fact in the Union is con-
cerned and interested in their welfare in some
degree on account of one or more potteries
being established' within its borders. I have
not in my possession, nor have I been able t,o
obtain information in regard to the number,
locality, or capacity of all the potteries now
established in the United States. James P.
Stephens, esq., corresponding secretary of the
Potters' Association of the city of Trenton, to
whom I am indebted for much of the inform-
ation I have upon this subject, has sent me the
names of some of the chief points at which the
business is now carried on, with a statement
of their capacity of production, from which a
pretty correct idea can be formed of the in-
crease of this manufacture since 1860 and the
importance of this interest
The points, to which I will only direct atten-
tion, where this manufacture is quite extensively
carried on, and which will be sufficient to convey
an idea of this interest, are the following:
New Jersey:
Trenton  57
Jersey City  j
Gloucester  °
Ohio:
East Liverpool  40
Cincinnati    12
New York:
Flushing and Greenpomt, Long Island  8
New York city  i
Pennsylvania: ■*
Pittsburg  8
Illinois:
Peoria  *
Maryland:
Baltimore  4
Massachusetts:
Boston 
Making a total of.    146
which as it will be seen are divided among
seven States. Now, I am informed that the
146 kilns above mentioned, if worked to their
capacity, will produce over 50,000 crates of
ware, and in doing so would consume about
75,000 tons of clay and a like quantity of coal.
If there has been a corresponding increase of
this manufacturing interest in the country to
the increase in New Jersey—and I see no good
reason why there should not have been, for
many of the States have increased more rapidly
in population—the annual products in 1870
will amountto $20,000,000, if not more, against
some $2,000,000 in I860, as I shall presently
show.
The proprietors and stockholders it is true
are interested in these potteries, but they are
not all who are interested in their success and
who would derive benefit from such a policy as
would put and sustain them in active operation.
The supply of coal, clays, and other materials
for all these establishments must necessarily
be large, and the outlay of capital and labor in
the furnishing of that supply very great. The
different materials used in this manufacture
are obtained from various points. In Chester
county, Pennsylvania, and m other counties of
Pennsylvania lying adjoining and also in Dela-
ware, are located tbe establishments for the
mining, working, and preparation of kaolin or
line china-clay. Not only in these localities
are rich deposits found, but the article of
kaolin there produced is said to be fully equal
if not superior to the finest that comes from
Cornwall, England. I am informed that in
South Carolina, Georgia, and in Pope county.
Illinois, are beds of these fine clays, the lat-
ter of a peculiarly valuable character and
highly esteemed by the western potteries. In
Maine, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Delaware,
and Maryland are mines of quartz and feldspar
rock, «.d mills to grind these materials, filled
with heavy and expensivegrinding-machinery.
Ihe mills have been erected at a number of
points: in Middletown, Connecticut; Valley
Forge, Pennsylvania; near Havre de Grace,
Maryland: Trenton, New Jersey; and at points
about Pittsburg and further west. The more
common qualities of clays are fouud in many
places, and the digging of them has been an
interest of considerable local importance in
some sections, as at Woodbridge and Amboy,
New Jersey. All of these interests, in addi-
, tion to the potteries themselves, as well as
the manufactures of white lead, oxide zinc,
