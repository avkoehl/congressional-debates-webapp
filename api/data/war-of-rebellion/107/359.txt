YORK, April 21, 1861.

Major F. J. PORTER:

Captain Cochran desires me to say that he will have a company of fifty men ready by Wednesday morning. Perhaps one of the Hannover companies would supply their places until then if necessary. The York company will require arms and ammunition. Your dispatch was received, and will be attended to. Have they persons and tools in camp to cut the beef, or shall I send one along?

ALEX. SMALL.

Major F. J. PORTER:

If the troops from below will not remain in York we can supply them with bread and meat at the cars. It will be difficult to have coffee there for the whole number. Let me know whether any will remain here, and how the Hanover troops are to be provident for.

ALEX. SMALL.

Major PORTER:

There is a company of 130 men at the Hanover Junction waiting for conveyance to this place. The junction is twelve miles from fork, on the railway. They are out of provisions. The officer now here wishes to know what shall be done.

ALEX. SMALL.

Major PORTER:

The two companies from Hanover will require provisions. Shall I supply them out of the rations for troops to arrive?

YORK, April 21, 1861.

Major PORTER:

I will have ready to be shipped 15,400 rations by 7 o'clock to-morrow morning. Our citizens will send enough to our York troops to last them several days. Two companies from Hanover just arrived here; one of them with few or no arms. Say to J. D. Cameron to have a train here at 6 o'clock in the morning to take the rations to Parkton. We may probably raise another company here, but have neither arms for ammunition.
