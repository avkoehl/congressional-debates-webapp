LIST OP CLAIMS.
Mr. EVANS, I hold in my hand a resolution
in relation to the book which was published some
years ago by order of Congress, called the " List
of Claims." In the House of Representatives
it has been brought down to the present time; in
the Senate it has not been brought down to a later
I period than 1849. I have found it, in the course
| of rny investigations, a book of immense value.
| Without it 1 should never have known what was
i done in a great number of cases which I have
I been called upon to examine. The object of this
i resolution is to direct the Secretary to continue the
work to the present time. I offer the resolution,
and ask for its immediate consideration:
Resoh-cd, That the Secretary of the Senate cause the
"List of Claims,51 hcrelofoie prepared l>y him, to he printed
for the use of the Senate ; and that he cause the list to be
brought down to the close of the piesent session, including
such continuation in the list thus to be printed J and that
the usual number of copies be printed.
The resolution was considered by unanimous
consent, and agreed to.
On motion by Mr. BROWN", the Senate took
a recess for two hours.
The Senate reassembled at half-past eight
o'clock, a. m., [of Sunday, March 4.]
ENROLLED BILLS SIGNED.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore signed the
following enrolled btlls, which had been previously
signed by the Speaker of the House:
An act further to amend the act entitled "An
act to reduce and modify the rates of postage in
the United States,and for other purposes," passed
March 3, 1851;
An oct to amend an act entitled "An act for
the relief of George M. Bentley, of the State of
Indiana," approved August 5, 1854; and
An act for the relief of Irene Gr. Scarritt.
BARIC SARANAC.
Mr. STUART. I desire to have a bill passed
which is a mere matter of form, to change the
name of a vessel trading to Wilmington, North
Carolina. The whole thing is a matter of form,
and 1 suppose there can be no possible objection
to it.
There being no objection, leave was granted to
introduce a bill " to change the name of the bark
Saranac, and grant her a new register;" and it
was read the first and second time, and considered
as in Committee of the Whole.
The Saranac is an Amefican-built vessel, now
owned by citizens of Wilmington, North Carolina,
and the object is to have the name changed.
The bill was reported to the Senate without
amendment, ordered to be engrossed for a third
reading, read the third time, and passed.
SAMUEL SMOOT.
Mr. BADGER. Under the resolution which
was adopted last night in favor of the pages, there
is a small boy, Samuel Smoot, a page employed
in the office of the Secretary of the Senate, who is
excluded. The committee have come to the con-
clusion that he is not embraced in the resolution.
I am sure it was not the intention of the Senate to
exclude him. It is supposed by the committee
that he is not included in the resolution because he
happens to be employed in the Secretary's office
insteiid of in the Senate Chamber. I.deaire to ask
whether there can beany doubt about the intention
of the Senate?
Several Senators. *Of course not.
Mr. BADGER. Then I ask, by unanimous
consent, that the resolution may be amended by
adding at the end of it, " and Samuel Smoot, a
page in the Secretary's office."
There being no objaction, the resolution was
ordered to be so modified.
JUDICIARY OF THE DISTRICT.
A message was received from the House of
Representatives, by Mr. Forney, their Clerk,
announcing that the House had agreed to the re-
port of the committee of conference on the dis-
agreeing votes of the two Houses on the bill to
reorganize the courts in the District of Columbia,
and to reform and improve the laws thereof.
Mr. BADGER made the following report:
The managers at the conference on the disagreeing votes
of the two [louses on the biil entitled " An act to reorganize
the courts of the District of Columbia, and to reform and
improve the laws thereof," have met, and, after full and
free conference, have agreed to recommend, and do recom-
mend to their respective Houses, as follows:
First. That the Senate recede from its amendments to
the nineteenth section of the bill, and agree to the same
section as passed by the Bouse.

GEORGIA AND FLORIDA BOUNDARY LUSTE.
Mr. MALLORY. There is on the table a
resolution for printing so much of a public docu-
ment as relates to the boundary line between
Georgia and Florida. The propriety of printing
it is evident from the fact that the Attorney Gen-
eral has interfered in the suit before the Supreme
Court on behalf of the United States. The reso-
lution was laid aside on a former occasion at the
suggestion of the Senator from North Carolina,
[Mr. Badger.] Hehas withdrawn his objection,
and I ask the Senate now to take it up.
The motion was agreed to, and the Senate pro-
ceeded to consider the following resolution sub-
mitted by Mr. Mallory on the 22d of February;
^mn1iI^3hat-the Secretary of lbe Senate cause to be
compiled and printed, with the documents of the present
session, all the documents and other papers in anywwe re-
1 S !e boundary line between the States of Geomia
and 1- ioriua,.heretofore laid before either House of Con-
gress, and of the reports of committees, and all proceedings
cยซnd action of either House thereon, so arranging the same
that no pepsr be twice printed iu such compilation.
