with both howitzers and rifles. For instance, the Indians were cross firing us from both hills, the balls flying fast, the men would use their rifles as much as possible, rendering the fire from the howitzers very slow.

I am, sir, most respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. A. THOMPSON,

First Lieutenant, First Infantry California Volunteers,

Commanding Howitzer Detachment.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE PACIFIC,San Francisco, Cal., July 18, 1862.

Colonel FRANCIS J. LIPPITT,

Second Infantry California Volunteers,

Commanding District of Humboldt, Fort Humboldt, Cal.:

SIR: You will direct Captain Akey, Second Cavalry, to proceed with his company, via Long Valley, to Red Bluffs, on the Sacramenty River, taking his camp and garrison equiPAGEand other company property. As this command is intended to operate without the limits of your district, it will be dropped from the returns thereof. The general desires this movement to be made with the least practicable delay. Should it be necessary, Captain Akey is authorized to procure the services of a competent guide to conduct his command over the shortest practicable route to the point above indicated, where further instructions, as well as supplies, will reach him. The captain will be instructed to telegraph to these headquarters his arrival at Red Bluffs.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

RICHD. C. DRUM,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE PACIFIC,San Francisco, Cal., July 18, 1862.

Captain DAVID B. AKEY,

Second Cavalry California Volunteers, Red Bluffs, Cal.:

SIR: Immediately on your arrival at Red Bluffs the department commander desires you to forward information to that effect to Captain Mellen, Second Cavalry, at Fort Crook. The latter has been instructed to co-operate with your force in, if possible, discovering and chastising the band of Indians which recently committed murders in Tehama County, in this State. A copy of the letter to Captain Mellen is herewith inclosed. * When ready, you will move with your company in the direction of Lassen's Peak, unless you have received reliable information at Red Bluffs of the Indians having retreated in some other direction. It is not improbable that the party committing the murders may belong to the Hot Creek band of Indians. Of this, however, you may be able to procure much more satisfactory information than has been furnished the general commanding. The several departments have been instructed to forward your supplies to Red Bluffs.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

RICHD. C. DRUM,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
