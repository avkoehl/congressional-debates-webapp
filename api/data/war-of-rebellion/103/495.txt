which they have been associated. To my field and staff officers, for their constant and hearty co-operation, and particular to Lieutenant-Colonel Jones and Lieutenant M. S. Crawford, acting adjutant, I tender my thanks and mention the two latter officers as having on all occasions shown the utmost coolness and daring on the field. Lieutenant-Colonel Jones has been at all times at his post and led the men to victory. The chaplain of the regiment, Rev. James W. Latham, has during this expedition, been faithful in an extraordinary degree to the discharge of his duties, and so long as the regiment retains as sacred the memory of our noble men who have fallen for our country's cause, will it respect and cherish with affectionate regard the pious labors of him who composed our comrades' remains, and with Christian burial secured them decent resting places on the field where they fell.
