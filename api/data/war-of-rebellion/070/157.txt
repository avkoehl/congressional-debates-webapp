Lynchburg, and burnt Concord dept, on South Side Railroad, and pushed on before daylight to Campbell Court-House. I have sent an adequate force to try and overhaul them. They are believed to be making for the Danville railroad to destroy bridges. I have telegraph General Bragg to notify him of the danger to that road; have also apprised him of whereabouts and the state of affairs here. Your speedy arrival here is of vast importance. There is nothing in the way of your coming by the most direct route except the force of cavalry under Duffie, which I hope we can break up. As soon as it is ascertained positively that Hunter is moving upon this place from Buchanan I will dispatch other couriers to you . My men and horses are much jaded, but I hope be able to do good service to-day.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
