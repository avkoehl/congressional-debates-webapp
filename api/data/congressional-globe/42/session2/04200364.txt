The Tariff—Mr. Blair.
42d Cong....2d Sess.
come in competition with our own. I can
assure our free-trade friends that the time is
far distant when this will be done.
Taking into consideration the modification
and reduction of the internal revenue now rec-
ommended, and its speedy extinction as de-
manded by public opinion, and the legitimate
demands of the national Treasury under an hon-
est and economical administration, I estimate
our annual expenditures, including War, Navy,
Indian, Pension, miscellaneous expenses, in-
terest on the public debt, and sinking fund,
at $200,000,000. I am well aware that they
have far exceeded this sum heretofore nearly
double that amount, but the public judgment
condemns such reckless waste and public ex-
travagance, and public indignation will reform
such abuses and punish the guilty party. The
public conscience is awakened, the people are
aroused, and will demand and enforce genuine
civil service reform from the President down
to the humblest public servant; then we will
effect revenue reform—genuine, permanent,
and lasting; the entire abolition of the internal
revenue system with its thousand of officers,
assessors, collectors, supervisors, spies, and
informers, who now cost us millions annually;
also, the correction and removal of all the gross
extravagances and abuses now existing in the
custom-houses of New York, New Orleans, and
elsewhere. When these reforms are brought
about, the sum I have named will answer all the
honest and legitimate demands on the Treas-
ury. That such a sum can be realized from
customs duties the returns of the past year fully
prove. They were over two hundred and six
millions, and the returns of the present year
as far as received indicate a revenue of two
hundred and twenty or thirty millions. Taking
into consideration the reduction arising from
the modifications I have suggested, the cus-
toms duties would not fall much, if any, short
of two hundred millions the first year, and the
necessary increase and extension of manufac-
turing industry consequent upon the reduced
prices of the necessaries of life for the laborer
and his family, and the reduced price of the
raw material to the manufacturer, would ne-
cessarily greatly stimulate business and increase
both our imports and exports, arid conse-
quently increase the revenue from customs.
Besides, if any deficit existed, that would
be more than made up from that portion of
internal revenue tax which the committee
propose to retain for the preseut.
1 am well satisfiedsuch a system would secure
cheap necessaries for the laborer and his
famiU, cheap raw materials for the manufac-
turer when they ate produced abroad, and
ample encouragement, and protection to all our
manufacturing interests, as well as revenue
sufficient for all national purposes. This is the
mollification of our present tariff that we re-
quire ; a modification that would insure the
greatest possible degree of material growth and
national development, and increase the pros-
perity and happiness of the people, and en-
large the consumption of both domestic and
foreign goods, by increasing the ability to pur-
chase and pay for ihe same. Such*a tariff
the requirements of the national Treasury
will demand for many years io come, and such
a tariff willfully satisfy all the interests of our
country. Mr. Wells, a free-trader, appears
to recognize this necessity, for in the report
from which 1 have quoted, on page 23, he uses
the^ following language under the head of
"National Taxation under the Tariff:"
*'We come next to the consideration of the influence
of national taxation under the tariff on prices and
the cot of domesiic production ; a Mibjoct the dis-
cussion of which is attendedwith the embarrassment
that it involves more of prejudice and of opinion
founded on private self-iuterest than almost any
Other which since the abolition of shivery has
occupied the attention of the American people.
JN otwithstanding this, it is important to recognize
the fact, that under the existing financial condition
of the country the old-time issues between the
advocates of free trade on the one hand, and pro-
tection on the other, have ceased to be of any real
practical importance—inasmuch as in the arrange-
ment of a tariff with a view to revenue the require-
ments of the Government must certainly, for the
present, necessitate so high an average of duties as
to afford all that can be reasonably asked for on the
grounds of protection; and with a given require-
ment, moreover, for revenue, in excess of what can
be derived from the taxation under the tariff of
acknowledged luxuries, there would seem to be no
valid objection to distributing the additional taxa-
tion in such a manner as to favor those branches of
industry most exposed to foreign competition."
Here we have the distinct statement that the
old issues between free trade and protection
"have ceased to be of any real practical im-
portance," and why? Because the require-
ments of the Government demand a rate of
duty for revenue that will secure protection.
And he admits that there is no valid objection
in arranging taxation (tariff) in such a manner
as to favor those branches of industry most
exposed to foreign competition. I wish to
add, for the purpose of correcting a misap-
prehension in the public mind in regard to
the effect of the present tariff on the farming
interests, the following extract from the able
speech of the gentleman from Ohio, [Mr.
Wilson.] He says :
" Free-trade economists are unceasing in their dec
larations of sympathy for the farmer.declaring tbat
he is oppressed and robbed by tariff laws for the
benefit of manufacturing monopolists; that he is
taxed on his iron and steel, his hardware and cut-
lery, his cotton and woolen goods, and on everything
that he uses, forgetting to tell him that as an offset
he is protected on everything he produces, and that
all this protection inures to the benefit of the labor
of the country and to the United States Treasury.
There is not a single production of the field, the
orcnard, or the dairy tnat does not share this pro-
tection, in proof of which I annex the following
table, compiled from the report of the chief of the
Bureau of Statistics, for the fiscal year ending June
30,1871, exhibiting a few of the leading agricultural
productions imported into this country during that
year, together with the value and the duty thereon :

"Thus we have the fact established by figures
from an undoubted source ttiat the leading agricul-
tural productions represented in the foregoing
table, amounting to nearly one hundred and thirty-
three million dollars, are protected by an aggregate
duty of nearly fifty-one million dollars, or an aver-
age duty of about thirty-eight per cent., in which
the great grain-growing, stock, and wool-producing
States of the West and Northwest fully participate;
and yet the delega-tions from those States, with few
exceptions, are opposed to protection. Wipe out
or even reduce the tariff on grain, stock, and wool,
and no class would suffer more than western farmers
Canada, with her cheap labor and unbounded pas-
turage, could drive them from the markets.
"1'he States of Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, Michigan
Wisconsin, and Minnesota produced in 1870 one
hundred and twenty million bushels of wheat or
over one half the entire crop of the United ''
on which they enjoyed the benefit of a duty of
twenty cents per bushel, amounting to §24,000,000
protection, and yet they received per bushel but
little over one half the price received by the New
England States. The same is true as to price of
other cereals; and the reason is obviously because
in the West probably nine tenths of the labor is
employed in agriculture, while in New England
it is divided between agriculture and manufactures.
Our importations the last fiscal year exceeded $518,-
000,000, on which wo collected duties amounting to
largely over $200,000,000. Now, there can bo no
doubt but that a critical examination would show
that from thirty to thirty-three per cent, at least of
these importations was made up of articles strictly
agricultural from which full average duties were
collected. And, so far from being robbed, as has
been alleged, the farmer fully and equally partici-
pates with other producers in the benefits of protec-
tion."
Mr. Speaker, in conclusion, I would say
that if the West and South would diversify
their productions by a greater division of
labor, if they would build furnaces, forges,
cotton and woolen mills, and other manufac-
turing establishments, it would have a most
happy effect in equalizing the value of farms
and farm products over our entire country,
and the laborers, thus transferred from the
producing class to the consuming, would fur-
nish them a ready market at good prices at
home for the flour, pork, beef, and other agri-
cultural products now sent to distant markets
at great cost. If the commercial classes wish
a permanent increase and extension of com-
merce, let them encourage and aid such an
adjustment of our revenue laws as will secure
the greatest development of the agricultural
and manufacturing resources of our country
possible, a sure and only reliable foundation
for a world-wide commerce.
Therefore I would ask gentlemen to ap-
proach this great and important national ques-
tion free from passion and State or sectional
rivalry and jealousy, carefully and calmly to
investigate the principles that should govern
us in the imposition of duties on foreign im-
ports and the discriminations that are required
by national self-interest, which is the highest
patriotism, and we shall then secure such an
adjustment as will do justice to all sections of
our country, secure the greatest possible degree
of material development of all our resources,
promote and advance the general peace, pros-
perity, and happiness of all our people, and
impose the least possible burdens ou the
industries of the country, while we secure
ample revenue for our Government.
The Tariff.
REMARKS OF HON. J. G. BLAIR,
Of MISSOURI,
In the House op Representatives,
May 4, 1872.
The House having met for debate as in Commit-
tee of the Whole on the state of the Union—
Mr. BLAIR, of Missouri, said :
Mr. Speaker: Were it not that my silence
upon the subject of tariff now under debate
might be misconstrued I would refrain from
any remarks upon this occasion.
_ Ihe people of the United States are divided
into tariff and anti-tariff, free-traders and pro-
tectionists. Free trade strictly means no tariff
upon importations, yet all who oppose a tariff
for protection, even though they may favor a
tariff for revenue without protection, are like-
wise styled "free-traders." Of this latter
class I am one.
In principle I may be properly called a free-
trader, yet practically I am in favor of a tariff
fo r revenue solely, as being the best means for
raising revenue to pay the debts and defray
the expenses of Government.
_ Although it is strongly denied by protec-
tionists upon this floor, yet I think it suscep-
