between the regiment on Neuse road and you? If so, I would prefer to trust to the cavalry patrol and recall the regiment to act as a reserve. A small infantry picket, part of the way out, might support the cavalry and see that they did their duty, without the same risk.

J. D. COX,

Major-General.

MARCH 10, 1865-11. 45 a. m.

Brigadier-General PALMER:

A demonstration made on my left makes it advisable to send over at least one regiment from your right. If all is quiet there send one on double-quick.

J. D. COX,

Major-General.

[MARCH 10, 1865]-12. 10 m.

Brigadier-General PALMER:

The orders I have sent are that if I send woard that I cannot hold here, you will make an orderly retreat to New Berne, but I think the weight of the enemy's attack is over. If he is quiet in your front I want a brigade, and want everything got well in hand to move in any direction. I need help and rely on you to send whatever you can.

J. D. COX,

Major-General.

Signal down the railroad for General Schofield not to leave the train to come to the front this morning.

MARCH 10, 1865-12. 30 m.

Brigadier-General PALMER:

Hoke's division made a brisk attack on my left and is now repulsed. Signal General Schofield that he can safely come up, as the road is not now endangered. I will send back your men as soon as the pursuit is pushed farther. I have a good many prisoners.

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIRST DIVISION,March 10, 1865-5. 10 p. m.

General J. D. COX,

Commanding, &amp;c., Wise's Cross-Roads:

GENERAL: The three men who came through with dispatches from General Couch passed out again some hour or less since. Two of them returned about half an hour since to the camp at Gum Swamp and informed the officer in command there that they had seen a brigade of rebels passing down (I cannot discover on what road) on our left. Major Camp will furnish further information as soon as he can obtain it. This news is brought to me by the quazrtermaster of the Eighth Minnesota, now at Gum Swamp.

Very respectfully, yours,

I. N. PALMER,

Brigadier-General.
