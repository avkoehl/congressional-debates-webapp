My trains are procuring forage in abundance at present. To-morrow I will try the country thoroughly, by sending out every wagon that can be spared. I believe I could remain here several days. Do you think my locality a proper one to accomplish your purposes? No word from you since your dispatch of the 25th.

Your obedient servant,

WM. WEER,

Colonel, Commanding Division.
HDQRS. FIRST DIVISION, ARMY OF THE FRONTIER,Camp at Carrollton, Ark., March 31, 1863.

Lieutenant-Colonel KENT,

Commanding Troops at Forsyth:

I reached here on last evening, and to-day have sent an expedition against the rebel forces at Crooked Creek, who are distant some 30 miles. I have thus far found forage in abundance. How long it will last I do not know. The effect of my expedition will at least have the effect to clean Crooked Creek. In the mean time I would recommend that you send your forage train to Berryville vicinity. There is a large amount of forage on the Osage and King's Rivers, in that neighborhood. They should go prepared to make at least a two days' trip of it. A direct road leads from Forsyth. If I can accumulate any forage here, so as to supply you, will let you know. I have had no response to my letter sent yesterday, though three of my men came down to-day. I trust it has reached you. Please attend to the suggestions therein made, particularly in regard to my ambulance and train. We are here on half rations of some articles. Can White River be forded at Forsyth with loaded wagons? What is the depth of water at present, and is it rising or falling? Please communicate any news in regard to Marmaduke, and also inform me, if possible, the locality of the other two divisions.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

WM. WEER,

Colonel, Commanding Division.
