diciary, reported a bill for the relief of Nathaniel
Tyler     Read twice, and committed
Mr DUNCAN, from the Committee on the
Public Lands, moved that the Committee of the
Whole be discharged from the bill providing for
the establishment of two additional land offices in
the State of Illinois, &c , for the purpose of having
the bill immediately considered
Mr DUNCAN informed the House that a large
district of country had been surveyed, and the
plats filed in the General Land Office, and only
wanted the passage of this bill to be biought into
market He said that sales of public land usually
took place in the spring and fall, that if this bill
could not be passed out of its present order on the
files of the House, the sale would be postponed
until fall, which would be equally injurious to the
interests of the Government, and the citizens re
siding in the country, who wished to purchase
their homes, and make permanent improvements
The motion was lost
PUBLIC DEPOSITES.
The House resumed the consideration of the
following resolution, offered by Mr Makdis, of
Alabama
Resolied, That the Committee of Ways and
Means be instructed to mqune into the expediency
of reporting a bill requiring the Secretary of the
Tieasury to deposite the public moneys of the Uni-
ted States in the State banks, and, also, as to the
expediency of defining by law all contiacts here
after to be made with the Secretary for the safe-
keeping, management, and disbursement of the
same
Mr BURGES took the floor, and asked if it
was in order to move an amendment to the reso-
lution, so as to move a different instruction on the
same subject.
The CHAIR said the motion would.be in order
under certain restuctions, which he indicated
Mr BURGES proceeded to reply to the argu
«lent of the gentleman from Alabama, [Mr Mar-
bis,] and after speaking about half an hour, gave
■way to a motion to proceed to the orders of the
Any
TheSPEAKERpiofem (Mi Foot)announced
that the pension bill was the special order
Mr POLK moved that the House resolve itself
into Committee of the Whole on the state of the
Union, for the purpose of taking up the bill
making
APPROPRIATIONS FOR THE ARMY.
Mr MARSHALL contended for his right to
the fl ;or
The SPEAKER decided that the order of the
day not having been announced, the motion of Mr
Polk was m Older
Mi POLK then called for the yeas and nays,
which weie ordered
The House decided to go into Committee, Mr
Wayne in the chair—yeas 134, nays 37
The bill having been taken up, the motion
pending being one made by Mr McKAY,to reduce
the miscellaneous appropriation from ¡¡,356,000 to
$306 000,
Mr MeKAY said that, having had an interview
on this subject with the chairman of the Committee
of Ways and Means, who had, on examination
of some of the items, consented to reduce them
considerably, he would withdiaw his motion
Mr POLK admitted that there might be a
reduction made in the item of fuel, which was
compnsed in this, ahd he moved to strike out
#356,000, and insert $344,000     Agreed to
The next item being for transportation of cloth-
ing, subsistence, ordnince, &c   $150,000,
Mi POLK moved to reduce it to $145,000,
which was agreed to
The allowance to officers for the transportation
of their baggage, when on duty, and for per diem,
allowance to officers in topographical duty, was i
reduced from $70,000 to $5d,000                               |
The item for the rewards, and other expenses
mcideit to the apprehension of deserters, $8,000,
was stricken out
For contingencies of the Army, $10,000, was
agieed to
Foi carrying on the works in the city of Sa-
vannah, Georgia, $25,000.
Mr VANCE inquired what sort of works this
appropriation was for
Mr POLK said this was to complete the erec-
tion of barracks, for which there was an appropri-
ation made the last year
Mr VANCE was opposed to the whole bar-
rack system, as unnecessary and burdensome He
thought it ought to be curtailed Barracks were
often elected at great expense, after which they
would be abandoned lie instanced the case of
Fort G bson, for which there was an item in this
bill making an appropriat on of £25 000 to erect
barracks there, whilst there was on the table a
bill reported which went to change the military
station from that place into the Territory of Ar
kansas
Mr POLK said, that when the bill alluded to
by the member from Ohio came up, he hoped to
be able to show him that it ought not to pass
The present appropriation was absolutely neces-
sary to afford protection to the Army The ap
propnation of last year had been applied to the
purchase of the site on which the erections were to
be made With respect to the erection of barracks
atFort Gibson, it would be recollected that, in con
sequence of the removal of the Indians, it became
one of the most important posts in the West The
present building was in a state of decay, and as it
was deemed moie economical to erect a permanent
building of brick and stone, the Secretary of War
had dnected an estimate to be submitted for that
purpose, upon which the committee felt it their
duty to report an a[ propnation for it
Mr R M JOHNSON pledged himself to show
to the House that it would not be politic to change
the military station from Fort Gibson into the In
dian territories, for the troops of the United States
ought to be placed on our own borders, as much
to protect our own citizens as to keep peace among
the Indian tribes
Mi JONES, ofGeorgia,and Mr WILLIAMS,
objected to the approp-iations for banacks
Mr GAMBLE b ire testimony to the necessity
there wis of them in Savannah
Mr POLK said that, where there were no bar-
rackb, the health of the officers and soldiers must
be hazarded by being turned into the open air It
would not require more than twenty dollars a man
to furnish them with i importable banacks
Mi WARD enlaiged upon then importance in
a military point of view, and advocated the ap-
propriations
The appropuation was agreed to
The items for continuing íepuirsand alterations,
&c , at Baton Rouge, Louisiana, ftlO 000,
Foi erecting officeis'quarters at Fort Severn,
Annapolis, $5 000,
For carrying on the works at Green Bay, Mich-
igan, $10 000, weie severally agreed to
Forextendmg the woiksand erecting additional
barracks at Fort Gibson, Arkansas, $25 000
Mr SEVIER moved to st-ike out this appro
priation and mseit $10 000 for erection of a fort
on the Arkansas river He stated that the gar
rison was in an unsuitable place, wheie it was of
no use, and as long as it was there, he was not
in favor of appropriating a cent foi its accommo-
dation
Mr POLK went into some explanations to
show that, in the opinion of the War Department,
Fort Gibson was one of the most important posts 
in the western country If there had been a force
there formerly, it would have saved the Govern-
ment the expense of a million of dollars All the
information which he had received on this point
went to assure him that this information was
necessary
Mr ASHLEY was surprised at the opinion of
the Secretary of War, that so large a sum as
$10,000 should be expended for the erection of
banacks at Fort Gibson, because so many Indians
were located there The great mass of Indians
were farther north on the Missouri river, and the
commissioners appointed to look out for proper
locations for Indians were looking five hundred
miles up the Missouri for proper situations A
post at Fort Gibson was not so important, there-
foie, as had been represented
Mr EVERETT, of Vermont, said he was will-
ing to make such an appropriation for the repairs
of the barracks at Fort Gibson as might be neces-
sary to render them comfortable He did not
think it would be good policy to retain a post
within the settlements of the Indiars,and he should
object to appropriations which contemplated any
permin^nt posts m their vicinity
Mr VA1NCE thought, he said, that the soldiers
ought to erect their own barracks generally He
was not in favor of this bill when it was reported,
but he thought that those who had charge of the
defence of the country were better judges of the
eligibility of different posts than the people of Ar-
kansas Believing, hov/ever, that the general ap-
propriation for the repairs of barracks was suffi-
cient, without this specific appropriation, he should
vote for striking out the clause
Mr SEVIFR made some further remarks in
suppoit of his motion, dissenting from the opinion
of the Secretary of War, and contending that the
garrison might as well be in Cuba as the place
where it was It was true that in that portion of
Arkansas a post was highly necessary, but the
Indians and the people of Aikansas weie both op-
posed to the present position of the garrison, and
no one was in favor of it except the Secretary of
War
Mr CAGE opposed the motion to strike out,
and contended that the Secretaiy of War, obtain-
ing, as he did, the best information fiom the offi-
cers of the army, was better qualified than any
one else to form an opinion as to the advantages
of different positions for the establishment of mili-
tary posts The gentleman says that the people
of Arnansas do not wish to have the post in its
present position It might be that the garrison,
in its present position, does not afford them so
good a market for their eggs, chickens, and ducks,
as it might in another situation, but that consider-
ation might not have guided the Secretary of War
in forming his opinion Mr C spoke earnestly
in support of the policy and justice of making am-
ple provision for the defence of the frontiers from
the hostilities of the Indians
Mr CLAYTON supported the motion The
Cherokee Indians, against whom the people of
Arkansas wished to be protected, were between
them and the fort, and the fort was, therefore, as
beneficial to the Cnerokees as to the people of Ar-
kansas If the fort was to protect Aikansas, it
ought t« come back to the Arkansas line
Mi R M JOHNSON regretted that a matter
so easily understood had consumed so much time,
and proceeded to make some explanations respect-
ing it The question was whether we should keep
a post forty miles within the Indian country or
bung it back to the Arkansas line He conte ided
that the intercourse between the garrison and the
Indians was highly disadvantageous to the morals
of the latter
Mr HUBBARD opposed the motion Perma-
nent barracks were not wanted, but the Secretary
merely proposed to repair the barracks for the ac-
commodation of the troops now at the post As
to the position of the fort, he contended that every
fort ought to be in advance of civilization, and
that it was absurd to erect a line of posts on the
frontier of its defence ajamst the Indians The "
gentleman from Kentucky was mistaken in sup-
posing that the fort was built on lands belonging
to the Indians, the land having been reserved to
the United States Had the gentleman informed
us of any acts of depredation committed by In-
dians east of Fort Gibson > He had not He
hoped the House would decide upon the motion,
in order that we might get the bill through the
committee
Mr SPEIGHT remarked, that the reservation
referred to by the gentleman from New Hamp-
shire was so limited, that it could not be used for
the purpose of this fort The Committee on Mili-
tary Affairs wish to check the disturbances which
grew out of the vicinity of the posts to the Indian
settlements
Mr EVERETT, of Vermont, proposed an
amendment to the bill, which the Chair pronounced
to be out of order.
Mr H EVERETT said that incase the amend-
ment of the gentleman from Arkansas should be
rejected, he would move to strike out the words
"creating additional barracks at Fort Gibson,"
and the word " twenty," so as to reduce the ap-
propriation to five thousand dollars
