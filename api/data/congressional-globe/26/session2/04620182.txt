Í also enclose to you the letter and answer of Mi Andeison of
Kentucky to twelvequesttons propounded to him lelatmg to the
above mentioned subject There aie many other statements
made by gentlemen of hjgh standing, i elating to tlie same sub
ject, which have been presented to Congress and retened to
the committee m the Senate haying charge of the «ubjpcf, with
the reading of which 1 do not desire to trouble you all express
fig a desire that something may be dono to relieve tho com
mercefrom the burdens now imposed upon it by improving
the navigation at that point in sime way, either by impioving
the present canal, or the navigation through the falls* of the
nvei( orto improve both, or to construct a canal on the I wham
shore
This is a subject of vast importance, in which a large portion
uf the people <t£,th& United States ia deeply mteiested, near one
half of the whole number of the States of the Union arediiectly
interested m it
"From the advanced period of the pi eaent session ofCongress,
ins ieared by many who feel a lively interest in this matter
and who desire that something may bt- speedily done that
Congress will not find time to act upon the befóte mentionel
bill during the present session I th°refoie most respectfully in
quire, in the absence of the passage of said bill, if the ¡secretary
at Wai would have the power to cause suth survey and e\
animation u> be made during the present season and if not, \
beg leave to suggest, if, m the judgment of the ¡secretary it be
deemed pioper, to furnish the Committee of Ways and Mean*!

purpi ses, to the smallest po «ibl«, mount con-is ent
with therubiic talere t. Ihs is ih  policy esta-
blished by the p ecedmg zrd the p'e ent Admin s-
trattons
In 1S29, when the Republican party were re-
stored to powet and place, they found the country
m dabt, and taxfd to the h'^h st point of endu-
rance, for purports unwarranted by the Constitu-
tion, and unknown lo its Revo'utionary framers
The then President's aim was to res ore the Cor-
stttutton, and lo put the Government again on its
Republican track and de tmatton   to confine it to
tie few  and simple purpo es  for  whicn  it had
been instituted, and to leave the State auihonties
fiee and untrammelled, to gaard the rights and the
mun cipal interests of the citizen      The  ccurse
thin recommended to eifect ttm policy, was lo re-
duce the revenue of the Government to tre wants
of an economical AJniiui^tiHlio",  and this  po-
licy was adopted by the act commonly known as
the compromise act     I do not now mean to refer
to that act ss reconciling the great and opposing
intere ts of the manufacturer of thp North and the
planter of the South,  uhich bal so Ion  agitated
thi-   country   with   its  eai hquaire like   commo-
tion, and not only porlerded a dissolution of the
Union, but   threatened  to  deluge  the  land with
blood, and  crowd   the «caffold  with some of tha
country's rao.t gifted ¿nd d «-iinguished sins.   Nor
do 1 intend tj   refer  to   that act as having re-
duced the revenue of the Government during the
last and piesent Administrations, nearly one hun-
dred millions of dcllar>,  on   those  articles which
en'i-rid in o the daily Use o* evry consumer; nor
do I design to refer toihit^c' a° the  pre-eminent
indication given  oy this nation   of   its purpose to
sustain and advance the dcctnnps of free trade, in
opposition to ihs restrictive policy  of the nations
ot the old wotld     But I would refer to i1 as a de-
claration of pulicy by the Government, that the re-
venues shall not exceed an economical administra-
tion    This is the pledge given  to  the tax-payer:
tha the Government will not extort from him, that
it shall not have unlimited contioi over the earn-
ings of industry, that it will not require any more
taxes fiom him than v hat are nrcc sary for an eco-
nomical Government     Thai is what I conceive the
most valuable  in ihn  act— he de ¡aration of the
policy—ihe establishment of a principle by the Go-
vernment which his been sanctioned here, and ap-
proved by the constituent,     I  «ai f,  sir, that the
declared policy of   this  ( oseroment wa>, that the
expenditures for  the  acknt ule 'aed constitutional
purposes of he Government, should be  limited to
ihe smallest  posible aratnnt cuisisient with the
public service.    Here, sir, permit me to invite your
consideration to the depo iti act of 1836    There
you tee, sir, that, whi'e the other nauons ot the
globe were scheming and planning to impose the
utmost lirthmgcf laxa ion lhat human  mdu'try
could en lure, to sustain larpe standing armies, su-
perb sjhtems  of fortihcat ons, magnificent naval
forces, and th   splendor ind idlentss of privileged
orders, this Government we see planning to >eturn
back to the peop.e, by cons itu i nal mea')-., money
collected by the Governrndit, that w, s not needed
for an economical  an [ r mstitu'ional expenditure.
And wt inert see, by ti ¡, ac , ih it, ms ead of mak-
ing large  and exna/igant   expenditures for   ac-
Icnowkdg d cons t utional purposes,   the   surplus
revenue was ordered   to   be deposi ed   with   the
Stales, for the use an I Let efit of  the people, until
required  for the public  service, or the  defence of
the country     That e onimv, whicn was deemed
one ot the chief virtuis m a Republic, mi,;ht not be
perilled, that great  patronage  in any   one of the
deoaitm-nts, wh ch is  dieaded as one of its  chief
vic°s,  r-n,,ht not be here fosieied by ihe  expendi-
tures ot  Iprgesumscf   iro r>  fcr the public ser-
vic , ard  that ihe burdens ef Government might
rest li«hily on  the cui7en, it was deemed v, se po-
I cy to deposite this money wi h the Sutes, until it
hould be reamred fer  the t'efenc  a^d service ol
the Govirnmcnt
Ami not right, ther, Mi Cha rmin, in spying
that ihe declared pehry ot tWs Gi vernmentcon-
s steel, man eminent degree, m a if>v< nue for an
eeonmical Admit «ir to —,n an expenditure,
limited to the smallest amount consisient wi h fhe
public interest?
All gentlemen h°re say mat these acts which
have given peace to the ron try, ?nd satisfaction
to the peopie, «hou d lenam undisturbed—that
they should be ne.' mvio'ablff I have heard no
one on this floor s v he v oa d d'Muro ti, one ac,
by asking foe protecn-e duties ncr the oth r, by
asking that the revenue deposited vtnh the S ates
be demanded, and requ red to be returned But
gentlemen here strive secre ly to undermine this
policy, by asking that the proceeds ot the sales of
