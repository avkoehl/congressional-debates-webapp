Question. Did you see that battery directly in front of Captain Rigby's?

Answer. He was away on the other end to the extreme left, and it was difficult for me to see.

Question. Was there a battery there that enfiladed our line?

Answer. Yes, sir. The battery that I say I do not know whether it was beyond the Shenandoah or not, that enfiladed the hill up, say half-way.

Question. Taking from Maryland Heights around by the way of Loudoun Heights, and so on much around to the Charlestown road, was not their fire delivered from nearly all points of the compass upon us?

Question. Please state your loss, if any, in killed and wounded, during the siege of Harper's Ferry.

Answer. None.

Question. Did the percussion shells you used explode or not?

Answer. I watched them very closely to see if they did, and I saw none explode.

Question. How many did you fire?

Answer. I fired some on Sunday and some on Saturday.

Question. How many in all?

Answer. Some twenty or thirty, I think; perhaps more than that. I did not keep any account. We were firing all the while. When we got out of long fuses we took those; and I tried some on Saturday before I got out of long fuses. If they had exploded I think I should have seen them.

Question. Whose make were those shells?

Answer. Schenkl's.

Question. What do you mean by long fuses-wooden fuses?

Answer. No, sir; paper fuses; twenty seconds.

Question. You mean long-time fuses?

Answer. Yes, sir.

By General WHITE:

Question. Those percussion shells were of very little use to you as shells?

Answer. Very little use as I could see. Colonel Ford said he fired some and they exploded; none of mine did.

By the COURT:

Question. How long had you those shells on hand?

Answer. I do not know how long they had them in the arsenal.

Question. You got them from the arsenal?

Answer. Yes, sir. I had them perhaps two weeks. My orderly sergeant fired some of them also, and he said they did not explode.
