about. As soon as we got to work, they began to assemble in great numbers from all quarters, and the more remote are still arriving. I took about 50 prisoners, and they report that the changes remarked in their camps proceeded from the reorganization of their army, and the assignment of them to new camps. All of Longstreet's command are now with Lee, but no part of the Charleston forces. They have no infantry force higher up the Rappahannock than it junction with the Rapidan. Their cavalry is assembled around Culpeper, I shall keep my bridges down a few days.

Major-General HALLECK:

As the accumulation of the heavy rebel force of cavalry about Culpeper may mean mischief, I am determined, if practicable, to break it up in it incipiency. I shall send my cavalry against them, stiffened by about 3, 000 infantry. It will require until the morning of the 9th for my forces to gain their positions, and at daylight on that day it is my intention to attack them in their camps. As many of my cavalry are still unserviceable from the effects of Stoneman's raid, I am too weak to cope with the numbers of the enemy if as large as represented. It would add much to my efficiency if some of Stahel's forces could advance, and hold fords at Beverly and Sulphur Springs some time during the forenoon of the 9th. If this should be done, I desire that the officer in command should not be informed of the object of his march, but merely to hold these fords. It is next to impossible to confine information to it proper limits. I have 2, 500 sabers on a reconnaissance to-day in the vicinity of Jefferson. Jones' brigade, which has been hovering about Milroy all winter numbering 1, 600, is among them; also an additional brigade from North Carolina.

I request that I May be informed whether or not I am receive assistance in my attack on the rebel forces at Culpeper from any portion of Major-General Heintzelman's forces, and if so, what?

Major-General HALLECK:

Brigadier-General Pleasonton reports that, after a severe encounter with the rebel cavalry over the Beverly Ford, he has not bee able to make head against it. He reports that his movement was anticipated.
