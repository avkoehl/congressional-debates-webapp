connection with one of Warren's would close the line between them. Upon reading your dispatch (respecting Warren's having the White Oak road) to General Miles, as I was riding with him from the left of his line, where a road ran to the White Oak road at the point held by Warren, he said that he had held that point in the White Oak road, but had moved from it to his right to connect, as both his flanks were in air. He asked me to say so, which I therefore do. I have ordered the line to be entrenched and slashed.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,March 31, 1865-8.15 p.m. (Received 2.45 a.m. April 1.)

General WEBB:

I think I have put 400 men killed and wounded to-day. There are 375 wounded in hospital now reported. My provost-marshal has received about 150 prisoners, but General Miles reports his provost-marshal sending more than 100 and that his Fourth Brigade sent in 160 prisoners besides, and his Third Brigade 124. General Miles says he thinks that a large portion of the prisoners captured by his division passed through the Fifth Corps lines.
