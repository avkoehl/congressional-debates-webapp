WAR DEPARTMENT, ADJUTANT-GENERAL'S OFFICE, July 28, 1864.

The GOVERNOR OF WISCONSIN,

Madison, Wis.:

You are authorized to raise eight new regiments of infantry. Full instructions by mail. Cavalry and artillery cannot be authorized. The regulations are adverse to detailing officers and men from the field to assist in recruiting new regiments.

THOMAS M. VINCENT,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

LOUISVILLE, KY., July 29, 1864.

Colonel E. D. TOWNSEND,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Washington, D. C.:

Does Circular Numbers 49, current series, War Department, apply to the colored regiments already organized by me? Vacancies of field officers are constantly occurring, and it will be most inconvenient to refer them to department commanders.

L. THOMAS,

Adjutant-General.

WAR DEPARTMENT, ADJUTANT-GENERAL'S OFFICE, July 29, 1864.

GENERAL COMMANDING ARMY OF THE POTOMAC:

Please cause one commissioned officer from each Michigan regiment of your command to be detailed immediately for recruiting service, with orders to report to the superintendent at Detroit, Mich. Regimental commanders should select good officers for the duty.

By order of the Secretary of War:

THOMAS M. VINCENT,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

(Copy to generals commanding Departments of the Cumberland, Tennessee, Ohio, and of Washington.)

SPRINGFIELD, ILL., July 29, 1864.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

I must have a district commander for this State. A large portion of my time is consumed by appeals to put down disloyal desperadoes, against whom the courts are no protection. Numbers of men are now here, driven from their homes by an armed force of 150 men in Fayette County. Shall I place enough of the arms I have on hand into the hands of citizens to defend themselves in the part of the State where the disturbances are taking place? I have suffered as long from complaints of loyal citizens whose rights have been trampled on as is proper for me to, and the Administration is losing the confidence of the people in consequence of these outbreaks.

RICHD. YATES,

Governor.
