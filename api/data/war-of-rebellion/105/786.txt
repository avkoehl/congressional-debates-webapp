Supt. Indian Affairs, Northern Dist. of Cal., Marysville, Cal.:

SIR: The Indian disturbances in the northwestern part of this State render it absolutely necessary to take prompt measures to collect all the Indians in that quarter and place them on the reservations set apart for their home. I have created the District of Humboldt and placed it under the command of Colonel Lippitt, of the Second Infantry California Volunteers. Colonel Lippit will take with him the headquarters of his regiment and two companies, and establish the headquarters of the district at Fort Humboldt. The district which I have organized embraces all the counties from Sonora to Del Norte, inclusive. Colonel Lippitt will be instructed to act promptly and vigorously in removing those Indians to the reservations, and I trust that the Indian Department will be prepared to receive and subsist them when collected together.
