CITY POINT, VA., March 14, 1865.

Major General P. H. SHERIDAN,

Middle Military Division:

Inclosed with his I send you some information obtained by the provost-marshal-general about the Northern Neck.* I do not expect you to remain where you are, however, long enough to take advantage of it. Information just received from Richmond indicates that everything was being sent from there to Lynchburg, and that the place would have been cleared out but for your interference. I am disposed now to bring your cavalry over here and to unite it with what we have and see if the Danville and South Side roads cannot be cut. You could come by Long Bridge and Deep Bottom, or Aiken's Landing, at both of which places we have bridges. Troops can be thrown out from the Army of the James to protect you in crossing, and a bridge for the Chickahominy can be sent from here if you are not sufficiently provided. Write to me how soon you fell you could start and what assistance you would want from here. Do not start, however, until you hear from me again. You want to send a staff officer by the boat that takes this, to have your supplies of forage and provisions distributed for your command all the way from the Chickahominy to Hatcher's Run. When you start I want no halt made until you make the intended raid, unless rest is necessary; in that case take it before crossing the James.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
