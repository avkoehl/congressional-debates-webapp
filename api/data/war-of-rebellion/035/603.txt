NASHVILLE, TENN., August 9, 1863. [Received 9.15 p.m.]

His Excellency ABRAHAM LINCOLN,

President of the United States:

Three hundred men, of Second West Tennessee Cavalry, who were captured by Forrest and paroled, have been at Camp Chase since December last [1862]. They are good soldiers and are anxious to join their regiments. Numbers of other troops have been exchanged since they were sent to Camp Chase, and I hope steps will be taken to have these released.

Now is the time for an entrance into East Tennessee. If you will let us mass the entire Tennessee force, we will enter, take, and hold the country, without regard to transportation, which has always seemed to be an obstacle that could not be overcome.

ANDREW JOHNSON,

Military Governor.

WAR DEPARTMENT, Washington, August 9, 1863-11.10 a.m.

Major-General BURNSIDE,

Cincinnati, Ohio:

The Secretary of War ask for a report of the number of mounted troops in your command. Please telegraph the number immediately.

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.

LEXINGTON, KY., August 10, 1863.

General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

The mounted force in this department will amount to 8,000 men as soon as all of the organizations are perfect, which will be in a very few days. I leave for Hickman Bridge at once.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.

FORT DONELSON, August 10, 1863.

Captain W. C. BUSSELL,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Nashville, Tenn.:

Scouting party from Wells' Creek, under Captain [A. N.] Randall, have returned, and have scoured the country to Magnolia and Waverly. At Magnolia they encountered the bush whackers, who fired on them. We wounded 2, captured 5, with 6 horses and a number of fire-arms. Three hundred guerrillas being expected in Magnolia in a half an hour, the scout had to return.

River falling slowly.

Respectfully,

A. A. SMITH,

Colonel Eighty-third Illinois Volunteers, Commanding.
