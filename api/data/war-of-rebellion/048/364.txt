The officer commanding picket at Freeman's Ford reports all quiet. General warren is about 3 miles in my rear and left. It is my impression that at least one corps of Lee's army is in my front.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Colonel, Commanding Brigade.

General Gregg's indorsement that the enemy were driven back does not indicate a large force on this side of the river.

GENERAL: I found the enemy in force at Rappahannock Station last evening. Drove them behind the works at that place. This morning I found them still there, and disposed to fight.

I have directed my advance to fall back on Fayetteville in case the enemy push them. My own camp is about 1 mile from Fayetteville, on the Warrenton road.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. IRVIN GREGG,

Colonel, Commanding Brigade.
