So the motion was disagreed to
Tne bill was then oidered to be engrossed fort
third reading         *
A^SALLl   LPOt*  THE  PRE-IDENT.
The CHAIR laid befoie the Seiate a commu
nicition fiom the  Hon    George  Poindeytfr,
calling the attention ot the Senate to  an auony
mous  letter, stauns that affidavits  were   in   the
possession ot the Ptesident of the United S ates,
piovmg that interviews had taken place between
Mi    Foi\dl\ter and  Richard Lawrence, i few  j
days previous  to tne attempt on the life of the
Piesident, and asking the appointment of a select
oommi'tee to investigate the facts and ieport them
to the Sena'e
Tne communicUion was read,and also a docu
ment signed by D J Phrci , a membei oí the
House, te tifying (is the leporter understood it)
that he saw such depositions in the hands of the
Pi evident
Mr   CLAY rose and siid that the commumca
tion  and document which  had just  been  read,
insj ned  1 im with nothing but the deepest mom
fi -Uionatd icgiet, and «hen he «aw the ai ony-
nious leitei to which the communication íeferred,
he did not be'ieve there wjs the s'ightest founda
tion for it     It was impossible for him to credit the |
statement, that affidavits should have been pro    ¡
cmed at the instance of the Chief Magistiate, for
the purpose of implicating a Senator of the U u  I
t-d States in so foul a transaction     that such a |
pl-u of injuring a fellow citizen should be adopt-
ed, ¡«ftdttw's of such a tenor procuied, and put I
away foi  the puipose of producing them under I
277
such circumstances as should prevent the charges
from being met, he«ehould not credit, but upon
the producfon of much higher evidence than had
yet been adduced
But (saiü Mr C ) the communication calls on
us for the ejercise ot a most unpleasant duty, and
at a most unpropitioue season—atra time when the
Senate is within seven or eight days of the close
of its session, and when the official existence of
the Senator himself, for a time at least, is near
its close But although the time is short, that
should not become a question when the duty ot
this body requires it to act It was thedutyof the
Senate to examine into the case, as requested by
the Senator, and if it should turn out to be true
tint he had the slightest agency in that most nefa-
nous attempt involving the life of a fellow citi-
zen, and that citizen ihe Chief Magistrate of the
country, he had no doubt, painful as the alterna-
tive mignt be, that we would be called on to exer-
cise the high functions confened on the Senate by
the Constitution, of expelling so unworthy a
member But if it should turn out that there was
not the slightest foundation for the charge, and
that there had been no agency on the part of the
Chief Magistrate in procuring such affidavits, it
was due to the country that he should be vindi-
cated from the aspersion Taking this view of the
case, he thought there could not be the slightest
objection to crea'ing the committee of investiga-
tion, as asked for
Mr C concluded by moving that a committee
of five be appointed for this purpose, clothed with
power to send for persons and papéis
The motion was agreed to
On ball >!in? for the committee, it appeared that
Messrs TYLER, SMITH, MANGUM, KING
of Geoigia, and WR1GH1, were appointed
