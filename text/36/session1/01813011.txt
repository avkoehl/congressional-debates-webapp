naces were not only useless, bat were mischiev-
ous, in maintaining a competition which did not
profit them, but injured others that were in a bet-
ter condition. I recollect last* year to have ad-
verted to the iron trade in Great Britain, and to
have shown that there it had been subject to the
same fluctuations that it had suffered from here;
and that in every instance it could be traced to
some fluctuation m the credit system of the coun-
try.
But what, let me ask, is the actual history of
the operations of this tariff on the importations of
iron into this country? Iliad a table prepared
which will probably startle some of the croakers:

It will be found that, for the last two years un-
der the tariff of 1857, the importations of iron, as
compared with those of the last two years of the
preceding tariff, have been not as much as two
thirds of the amount of the latter. They have
fallen off nearly half. It will be found, too, that
the exports of iron and the manufactures of iron
have increased largely in the last two years; and
that, when you come to subtract the exports of
iron and the manufactures of iron from the quan-
tity of iron imported, it will not be more than a
sum of between eleven and twelve million dol-
lars a year. Now, sir. suppose that import had
been actually prohibited: would the additional con-
sumption of American iron, in that event, have
been enough to have been severely felt by so large
an interest?
To show that this view is correct, that, so far
as the tariff of 1857 is concerned, it has not in-
jured the iron interests, I should iike to advert for
a moment—I know it is tedious; but still these
are things that ought to go before the country—
to the actual advantages which they derive under
the present state of things. I think I can show
that those advantages are, in many instances,
equal, and more than equal, to the twenty-four
per cent, duty which is laid upon it. I shall ex-
hibit, among other things, accounts copied from
the books of Payne & Smith, merchants, who
import hardware in New York. They exhibited
their books to me, and I asked for copies of several
of the accounts, that I might show what was the
actual advantage, independent of the duty de-
rived by the Government:

Thus I might go through with the whole list:
horse-shoe nails, saucepans, log chains, and an-
vils; and it will be found, when you come to add
these advantages to the actual duty, that the two
together give a protection of from fifty to sixty
per cent. Can it be supposed, with such advant-
ages as those, that the producer of iron can suffer
from foreign competition? I know they say these
are charges which the producer of iron at the
forge has to undergo in order to send it to New
York and Philadelphia; but whilst the charges to
send it to New York and Philadelphia are mani-
festly less than those from Great Britain, we know
that the American iron master distributes his prod-
ucts to most of the places of consumption, em-
bracing a great area of country, with less charge
than they could be distributed for from Philadel-
phia and New York.
I refer to these things for the purpose of show-
ing the large amount of real protection which is
already enjoyed by the iron interest. I have given
the history of imports, to show that, so far from
increasing under this tariff of 1857, they have
largely diminished. I do not say that the tariff
of 1857 was the cause of the diminution, but I say
this proves that the tariff of 1857 has not been the
cause of any depression under which they have
suffered. On tlin contrary, f believe that this
tariff of] 857 was one reason why we went through
the pressure at that period much more easily than
we have ever done in any preceding crisis. It
happened, luckily, that the duties generally had
been reduced something like one fifth. "We thus
facilitated the export trade. In tins way we di-
minished the exchange abroad, and the return
from that export trade it was that enabled the
northern and other banks to stand after the first
shock, and prevented this crisis from producing
as much disaster and suffering as had generally
attended such catastrophes heretofore.
If all this be true, then, sir, I ask why should
we be pressed, unless some better showing can
be made, to change this tariff of 1857, which has
worked out such results. No man can dispute
the fact that it is soon to yield much more revenue
than it now does. No man can dispute the fact
that its financial operation, so far, in curtailing
expenditure, has been salutary; and I think it is
a matter to be regretted that its restraints are not
to last longer than it will do, forit will soon afford
the means of a larger expenditure than any m
which this Government in time of peace ought to
embark. It was reduced for that very purpose.
It has given all that was promised. There was
no deception; there was no mistake about it, It
was reduced for the very purpose of diminishing
the expenditures; and we know from experience
that there is no other way to curtail them. It is
true, it went into operation in the time of a great
commercial crisiy in 1857; but it is also true that
wo had large expenditures which had been under-
taken, such as the public buildings and other
things, when the revenues were abundant, and
we were obliged to spend more than would other-
wise have been necessary, for a while, m order to
meet the necessities of the case. We know, too,
that we had an expedition into the Moimon Ter-
ritory as expensive as an actual war would have
been. These are the demands which consumed
the surplus and the amounts raised by loan. I
ou°"ht to add that the deficiency of revenue in the
year of crisis was also supplied by the use of
Government credit. But "for the last two years
we have not added to the public debt; and for the
next, in my opinion, this tariff will provide enough
to meet the ordinary expenses of the Govern-
ment and to pay the interest upon the public debt.
If I were to express my hopes, I should acknowl-
edge that they are even higher than that; but 1
choose to be sober in the calculation which 1 am
makin*. I say the fault that is found with this
tariff is not that it failed to do what it promised,
but because it is doing exactly what was prom-
ised; and it is for the reason that it is doing its
work, and causing some effort at retrenchment
and reform, that gentlemen are now so anxious
to change it.
But suppose they were right; admit, for ar-
gument's sake, that there ought to be a change;
that there is some evil to be remedied. If there
were, I say that this tariff bill which has been
sent to us from the House of Representatives
is no cure for that evil. In the first place, it js so"
exorbitant in its rates of duty that it-would give
us much less revenue than what we are now
receiving. That is the opinion of persons well
informed on this subject. A table was made out
at the Treasury Department to show the opera-
tion of this tariff upon the imports of the last year.
We received then about fifty njwffion under the
tariff of 1857. This, as we all know, was at a
time when credit and commerce had not revived.
We know, too, that the importations were noth-
ing like what they will be when the country is in
the full tide of prosperity; and yet it is calculated
that if this tariff had not reduced importation, if
it had not acted to cut off foreign trade, it would
have brought us last year, upon its diminished
importations, something like seventy-three mil-
lion. Docs not every one see that duties so ex-
cessive as these would have operated to diminish
the imports? and in doing so, I believe, would
have diminished the revenue.
But this is not all. It is so complicated a piece
of legislation that it would double your army of
officials in order to execute it. It would open the
doors to more fraud than any financial system
that was ever devised here before. Upon some
articles they pay not only by the yard, but by the
pound, and they pay not only specific but ad va-
lorem duty; and then, before the duty can be col-
lected , we have to make an estimate of maximum
and minimum. Look at this, sir:
" On all broadcloths, twilled or plain, valued at one dol-
lar or less per square yard"—
There is a minimum—
" a duty of sixteen cents per pound—
There is a specific duty. There is both the
measurement and weight—
" and in addition thereto, fifteen per centum ad valorem.11
There is an ad valorem duty. So that you havo
not only to measure and weigh it, but you havo
to enter into all the calculation of the foreign cost,
in order to assess the duties specific and ad valo-
rem which are laid. In other cases it is actually
necessary to count the threads in an inch square;
as, for instance:
"On all manufactures of cotton not bleached, colored,
stained, painted, or punted, and not exceeding one hun-
dred thieads to the square inch, counting the warp and fill-
ing,"" &c.
Seeing these provisions I caused an inquiry to
be directed to the collector at New York, to know
what would be the operation of this tariff in re-
gaid to the additional officers that it would re-
quire. Here is the letter of Mr. Schell:
u The appraisers, as will be seen, express the opinion
that the execution of the proposed law (tariff) would re-
quite, in their department, double the present store accom-
modation'', and three times the force of the present em-
ployes. In the custom-house proper, I am persuaded, an
increase of from one third to one half would be required
in the foiee of liquidating, measurers, weighers, &c., and
the emhanassment and delay to importers, in obtaining a
disposable possession of their goods, would be increased a
hundred fold."
In order that we might not act in the dark on
this subject, I asked the Secretary of the Treasury
to consult the New York appraisers, and to cause
them to convert this tariff of specifics into th®
corresponding ad valorem duties. I will turn to
some of them. 1 begin with the tariff on liquors
and wines:
