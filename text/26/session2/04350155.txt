and plume him with feathers, and a black cockade,
but you cannot make a milit?r} chieltam cf him,
only as he has made himself so
Mr D. was here called to order by seveial
Whigs,and the Chair reminded him that hi> re-

called a jackass, and his cabinet and cal met officeis

Federal gaily came into power on no avowed prin-

not make a beginning towards an independent use of our own
money—towaid  holding our own bank m all the depositee
wheieitisreceived,and letting the treasurer give his draft or

At ectionate s tUlation*
Washington, December 13,1803
In th'S communication Mr Jefferson speaks in
he language of prophecy He anticipated the
difficulties vuhich we have witnessed, and are
now witnes«ing, not only in relation to banks, but
of corporations m general And his objections
did not more exist upon the grounds of policy, than
upon the uncons Hut onali y of all corporations,
bat more especially that of a National Bank I
have not time to rerer to all his arguments
against a National Bank, nor is it mcessary I
will, however, ask the Clerk toread one more pas-
sage, which is found in his Ana Jefferson's Woiks,
vol   4, pages 523-7    The Clerk read.
I regret that the length of th s expose will pre-
vent 111  from making it a part of my printed re-
marks, I hope it vi'd be iufficient to say that it
is his cabinet opinion against Ihe cons'iutionality
of a National Bank His arguments are conclu-
sive and irresistible. I wish every man in this
Union could be furnished with a ccpy of this opi-
nion, he would cease to be a bank man, or wilful-
ly violate the Constitution
Mr Jefferson was oppose to a national debt, pa-
per currency, strckjobbing interests, and assump-
tion of States He looked up m them all as cor-
r iptmg in their tendencies, and destructive m their
effects, bo h in i private and political sense.
I hold it. my hand th  "Li e of Jefferson " Vol.
1, pag' 38?-9, in a cor venation with General
Washm tjn, ho siys a nong other things
"That the two grett comntamts were that the national debt
was unneces inly ir ere ised and that i furnished the means of
