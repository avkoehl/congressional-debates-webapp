town bounties to them, but thus far for nothing. Now, if the draft was kept off and we were permitted to work on, the practical application of these errors, in their direct effect, would be little noticed. And thus it is that I have desired that we might be let alone, and permitted to do the most useful thing, instead of being compelled to submit to the harsher operation of a draft.

I am, very respectfully, yours,

JOHN A. ANDREW.

NEW YORK, May 10, 1864.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

There are from 8,000 to 10,000 men on a strike in this city. The police have notified me that their entire is engaged in maintaining order, and the mayor has sequester me to suspend the draft for a few days. I have taken the responsibility of doing so in the city districts. It is going on it the country districts. The deficiency in this city is only 1,000. I send copy of the mayor's communication by mail.

JNO. A. DIX,

Major-General.

SENATE CHAMBER, May 10, 1864.

General J. B. FRY,

Provost-Marshal-General:

DEAR SIR: i inclose a dispatch which speaks for itself. Others as well as mr. Weed have fears.

Yours, truly,

E. D. MORGAN.

ASTOR HOUSE, N. Y., May 10, [1864.]

E. D. MORGAN,

If possible to do so, stop the draft to-morrow.

T. WEED.

DES MOINES, IOWA, May 11, 1864.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

My 10,000 shall be raised. Several counties and townships are behind on all former calls because they are copperheads. This embarrasses me. I anxious and determined they shall come to time, I earnestly ask for and must have a draft, so that these unfriendly sub-districts may be compelled to furnish an amount of 100-days" man in proportion to their delinquencies under three- year calls. This is but justice, and the real sentiment of the State demands it. Assure me that I may have it and I will succeed. Instruct provost-marshals accordingly, and charge responsibility to me.

W. M. STONE.
