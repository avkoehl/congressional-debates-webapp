Commodore D. D. PORTER,

Cairo, Ill.:

At my request Major-General Rosecrans applied to you to station a gun-boat at New Madrid. The application was made to secure the somewhat small garrison there, not to regulate trade in the district. I am informed that Captain Mitchell, commanding the gun-boat, stops all goods shipped there with my approval. Please order him to report to the commanding officer at New Madrid, who is charged with the duty, under the orders of myself and the department commander, of regulating trade to that town; or at least to cease interfering with shipments there made with my approval. Please answer.

THOMAS EWING, JR.,

Brigadier-General.
