noble comrades, brave soldiers who have fallen in defense of their county's flag. The names of the honored dead shall live in history and in the hearts of their surviving comrades; in the hearts of those who have shared with them the dangers and toils of the field, and who never will fail to remember associations formed in the hour of danger, and they will be securely stored and highly treasured. Sympathizing deeply with the sick and wounded in hospitals, it is consoling to know that a grateful Government will provide for their necessities. As for the present force of the command, it consists of tried heroes; of men who have withstood all hardships, have endured all fatigue, and who have bravely fought in half a dozen desperate engagements. Their spirit is splendid and their health good. A month's rest, with a full supply of clothing, is all that is needed to prepare them for the vigorous fall campaign that is promised us.

Officers and men all have performed their duty, and I have no one, therefore, to specially commend above another. As we have fought and acted in the past so shall we strive to do in the future; and feeling assured that we have gained the confidence of the division commander, we trust that in days to come, when new battles are to be fought, and new victories won, he may ever feel sure of his Second Brigade, and not hesitate to call upon it in any emergency.

Accompanying this report please find a tabular list of the casualties for this campaign. I refer your to regimental reports for nominal ones.

I am, captain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEO. W. MINDIL,

Colonel Thirty-third New Jersey Vols., Commanding Brigadier

Captain W. T. FORBES,

Actg. Asst. Adjt. General, Second Div., Twentieth Corps.
