In order that the Treasury of the United States may not be burdened with the pay of unnecessary officers, the Governor proposes that, although the State law requires him to appoint upon the general staff an adjutant-general, a commissary-general, and inspector-general, a quartermaster-general, a paymaster-general, and a surgeon-general, each with the rank of colonel of cavalry, yet he proposes that the Government of the United States pay only the adjutant-general, the quartermaster-general, and inspector-general, their services being necessary in the relations which would exist between the State Militia and the United States.
