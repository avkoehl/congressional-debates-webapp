ciary, to whom was referred the amendment
of the Senate to House bill No. 1017, to pre-
vent and punish tbe obstruction of the admin-
istration of justice in the courts of the United
States, have directed me to report back the

That if any person or persons shall corruptly, or
by throats or force, or by_ threatening letters, or any

just taken ; and also moved that the motion to

homesteads e0k soldiers and sailors.
Mr. COBURN. I now ask a vote on my
proposition. 1 will state that this bill confines
the right to the homestead of one hundred and
sixty acres to the soldier or sailor or the mem-
bers of his family. He is allowed to assign
it to his son or daughter, and the benefits of
the homestead may accrue, in case of his death,
to his widow, his eldest child, his brother, or
sister. It is also provided that if there be
neither children nor brother nor sister, the
land shall go to the father or mother of the
soldier or sailor.
Mr. RANDALL. Doesthebill give the oldest
children an advantage over younger children ?
Mr. COBURN. Oh no.
Mr. BINGHAM. I ask the gentleman to
say whether this bill gives the land i,n equal
quantities to the surviving children of the sol-
dier or sailor ?
Mr. COBURN. It is to be apportioned
among all tbe children. I have amended
the proposition by inserting "children" in-
stead of " eldest child."
Mr. HOLMAN. I think it would meet the
approval of the country if in a law of this kind
the benefits of the homestead should be en-
joyed without cultivation by any widow, minor
children, or disabled soldier.
Mr. COBURN. What is the gentleman's
proposition ?
Mr. HOLMAN. My proposition is to amend
by adding to the bill the following :
Provided further. That settlementon or cultivation
of the land entered shall not be required of any
widow, minor children, or permanently disabled
soldier entitled to the benefits of said act, to cntitlo
such widow, minorchildren, orpermanently disabled
soldier to a patent for such lana.
Mr. COBURN. I will allow a vote to be
taken on that amendment.
The amendment was agreed to.
The question recurring on the motion of
Mr. Coburn, the bill (H. R. No. 2983) as
amended was passed, (two thirds voting in
favor thereof.)
clerk to c0m51ittee.
Mr. STORM. I offer the following pream-
ble and resolution:
Whereas the clerk of the Committee on Education
and Labor has been instructed to complete the cor-
respondence existing between the trades unions,
superintendents of schools, educational institutions,
teachers' institute and the said committee: There-
fore,
Be it resolved, That the said committee be author-
ized to employ a clerk at the present compensation
until ordered otherwise by the House.
Mr. L. MYERS. I move to amend that
resolution by adding the following in favor of
the clerks of two of the committees.
Mr. RANDALL. Why not include all of
the committees?
Mr. L. MYERS. There is a reason for this:
That the clerk of the Committee on Patents and
the clerk of the Committee on Private Land Claims,
be continued during the recess of Congress at the
present rate of compensation.
Mr. DAWES. Why not put in the clerks
of all of the committees ? Tt would be better
than passing in favor of some and leaving out
others.
The amendment was disagreed to.
The resolution was rejected.
