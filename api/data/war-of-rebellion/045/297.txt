BLOODY RUN, June 24, 1863.

Major-General COUCH:

Colonel [Joseph L.] Moss, at McConnellsburg, reports the rebels are in large force at Chambersburg, and 500 went out on the Philadelphia road yesterday, and had not returned to-day, and they are advancing on Loudon, and are now within 2 miles of that place. They have also a considerable cavalry force at Mercersburg, and three regiments of infantry advancing there. I have ordered a regiment of infantry, as you directed, but doubt the policy of scattering my little command so widely at this time. The militia at Cove Mountain and vicinity have all run away excepting 90.
