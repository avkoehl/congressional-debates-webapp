Major General H. W. Halleck,

General-in-Chief:

Please send Brigadier General J. J. Reynolds to duty in this army corps. There are but twenty-one brigadier-generals for forty brigades and twelve divisions. I hope General Reynolds' commission will be of the same date that it was before he resigned. There are urgent reasons why it should be.

Hon. E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

I respectfully request that Captain A. E. Strickle, commissary of subsistence, be ordered to duty in this department, to attend to the breadbaking for the army. I intend to get the flour from the country through which we pass, and thereby save the expense of transportation. Captain Strickle was attending to this business in my command before I left Mississippi, and is not being used by my successor.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Lieut. Colonel ARTHUR C. DUCAT:

As ordered last evening, General Wood sent Colonel Harker's brigade to try and capture Morgan's command. I had command. Both Harker and Zahm reached here about the same time, just after daylight, but Morgan had already escaped. They pressed him closely, capturing 18 of his men, with their horses and accouterments. I have no supply train
