APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
June, 1838,
25th  Cong   --2nd Sfe-ss.
Cumberland Road—Mr. Alherton.
H. of Reps.
within which the public collections oi disburse-
ments require a depository, the said Secretary may
make arrangements mth a bank or bmhsin some other
State, Territory or District, to estabhA an agency or
agencies, in thr States, Territories or Districts so desti-
tute of banks, as banks of depcsite, and to receive
through such agency such deportes of the public money
as may be directed to be made at the points desig-
nated, and io make such (hsbursements as the public
service may lequire at tnose points
What would hare been the operation of this sec-
tion but for the last clause of the eighth section'' or
what would it be it the Secretary could now revive
the act? It is said thai a few banks, among others
the Bank of Missouri and the Bank of Wheeling,
have not violated the provisions of that act, though
I doubt whether they have not "paid out" the bills
or notes of other bank  or corporations of a less
denomination than five dollars But, suppose
eithei of these banks had not, under such a con-
stiuction, it woald have been, and would still be,
the Secretary's duty to make arrangements with the
Bank of Wheeling, or of Missouri, to establish
Hgenc es throaghout the Union to receive and dis
burse the public money If such be the true con-
tractu n of the act, it would be his duty to mike
arringemtnts with some one of the new free trade
banks in New York to establish agencies in ilmost
every State of the Union But such is not the law
The case provided for in the act of 1836 has occur-
red Deposite banks coming within all the provi-
sions of that act w ere not to be found, and the pub-
lic money has gone, according to the last and ex-
press condition of that act, into the custody of the
Treasurer of the United States It cannot be drawn
from the depositories, created under the act of 1789,
to be placed in banks, under the deposite act of
1836, the former having superseded the latter in all
the collection distnets throughout the Union, with
very lew exceptions Until the law is changed,
the deposites mut-t be made under the authority of
"the laws m force" prior to the existence of the act
of June, 1836.
So far, then, as it regards the question of re-
viving a State bank deposite system, it is not very
material whether the first twelve sections of the act
of 1836 be repealed or not With the exception
of a very few districts, where little revenue is col-
lected, (he depositories are all establ shed undsr the
laws in force prior to the act of 1836, and if the
remnant of tint act wtre repealed, we should have,
as we ought, one system for the whole Union
The first section of the bill is more important
It removes the restriction on the receipt of ti e
note? of banks which have, since the 4th of July,
183G, issued notes of a less denomination than live
dollars There is, under existing circumstances,
an obvious propriety m removing the discrimi-
nation which now exists
The notes of banks which have zealously labored
to resume specie payments, cannot be received
in paj ment of public dues, while those of the Bank
of the United States and of other banks, which
have uniformly resisted the resumpt o wou'd be
received Whatever opinion may be ema'amed
of the receipt of bank notes of any denomination
all such di crimination should, for the present, be
removed We can agree on this point, if we can-
not concur in any judicious financial plan The
next most important measure for the public is an
adjournment When this session ceases, we shall
not be disturbed by ridiculous alarms about the
Sub-Treasury, spread abroad by those «ho never
read a section of the bill. It is now in operation,
and the longer we try it the bet er shall we appre-
ciate its simplicity and economy JNoothei sys-
tem can relieve trade from an embarrassing con-
nection with Government, and render our Treasuiy
independent of banks
CUMBERLAND ROAD
REMARKS OF MR. ATHERTON,
Op Nfav Hampshire,
in the House of Representatives, June, 1838—On the
bill making appropriations for the contmuance of
the Cumberlard road m the States of Ohio, In
diana, and Illinois.
Mr ATHERTON said he would detain the
House but a few momen s The gentleman from
Kentucky who reported the bill [Mr Pope] had
several times, in his remarks, referred to the bill as
coming from the Committee of Wajs and Means
So far as this circumstance would indicate that a
majority of the members of that committee ap-
proved of the principles of the bill, it might lead
to an erroneous conclusion It was hi1, impression
that a majority of the members oi the committee
were not favorably disposed to the bill, and that
they had merely suffered it to be reported because
it referred to a subject in which many members oí
the House felt much interest, and which was pro-
per for the consideration and decision of the House,
and which they would hardly expect the commit-
tee to retain from them, or to reject At any rate
he could speak for himself, and say that such were
the views by which he ha 1 been governed, if he
had voted to report the bu', for he was decidedly
opposed to its passage
He considered the system of internal improve-
ment b) the General Government as intimately
connected with a high protecting tariff, as it is
called, for when such a system is undertaken, w hat
limit can br fixed to the expenditures to be mide in
pursuance of u"1—what limit to the revenue to re
raised for the purpose of being wastefully lavished
in those expenditure ?
Notwithstanding the ingenuity and ability mani-
fested by those who have supported the bill, he had
listened m vain for arguments to show that the sys-
tem which the hill proposed to continue was either
ju>t and expedient, er constitutional Sir, w hat has
been the mam argument relied upon to prove to us
to.at we oughi to pass this bill? Why, that the Go-
vernment is bound by the obligation of a contract
to do this, and that not to do it would be a breaeh
of faith This consideration was most strenu ush
urged bj the gentleman from Indiana, [Mr Ew
ing ] and was also touched upon by the gentleman
from Kentucky, [Mi  Pons ]
When he heard gentlemen of acknovvlc Iged
ability rely mainly for the support of a measure on
an argument utterly and entirely destitute of ? ij
foundation—an argument which had long since
been abandoned bj the leading advocates of the
measure, he w as induced, at once, to conclude that
reasoni., with them, were not as "plenty as b'ack-
birnes,' aid that the measure was, b} this verj
circumstance, rendered liable to just suspicion
And he must say that it was with some surnnse
that, at this time, he heard this preterded obhgat on
brought forward gravely to the notice of the Hou^e,
and the House told they were bojnd, "by con
tract," to con inr t'ns svstem Sir, the person who
may be considered the foande of this system of
internal improvements, or, who, if not i s foun er,
has certainly been, ard is s'ill, its most distinguish-
ed advocate—the individual who has carried lis
doctnms in favor both of the constitutionality and
expediency of the sys em toa grea er extent, per
hips, han any o'her statesman in the count)}, i1 e
('imf n of the "Jim?! fan st/s/nti " so oa'led has,
long ago, dismissed this iigu"ierit as unjust fiable
and unten b e He has abindo led tins position
He has lebuked and repudiattd th s pretence as
having no foundation To show this, he [Mr 4]
w oUld trouble the House by reading a passage or
two from the Registtr if Debt's

and repair of the Cumberland road, in the States o<"
Ohio, Indiana and Mtssc mi," which took pifce in
the Senate of the United States, m tne vear lo35
Mr Cw fN& of Ohu> an advocate of me bill, sai'
That the S tator from So thCaroli a seemed t« inte i ir

Mates for five } ears "
Mr Clay of Kentucky, also an advocate of the
bill, ir. the course of his remarks on the subj.tt,
used the following language
" Now he did not consur with the gentle nan
[Mr Ewing] that Ohio could, as a matter of stnet
right, demand of the Government to keep this load
w repair, and why so?   Because, by the term? of
the compact under the operation of which the road
was made, there was a restricted and defined fund
set apart, in order to accomplish that object, and
Tiur FOtvD MFASLRED THE  OBLIGATION  OP THE GO-
vtRVMENT It had been, however, long since kx-
fai th) There was no obligation then on the
part of the Government to keep the road m re-
pair "
He (Mr \ ) w ould, then, repeat his surprise
th, t an argument so untenable, and which has thus
been repudiated bj the ehampion of the internal
improvement sj stem, snould be now brought for-
ward and urged in favor of that system, and his
convienen tha' the fnerd  of the s)stem must be
hard pressed for argumen's
He agreed with the gentleman from South Caro-
lina, [Mr Campbell,] that it was a matter of con-
gratulation that the gentleman from Kentucky,
[Mr Undeiiwood,] formerly a friend of the system
of internal improvement, and, even now, believing
in its constitutionality, shou'd have come out
frankly and openly against its contmuance The
gen ieman from Kentuck) acknowledges that he
has become convinced that the s\s em is pirtial m
its operat on, ard propel 1} sajsthat he wishes to
treat all sections ahkt, "rd if any ststem is to be
adopted, he cal s for a sj stem of equal justice Sif,
tnese argumen's have again and again been urged
against the adoption and the continuance of this
sjstem, and he was happy to know that some of
those formed} its friends, have become convinced
of their truth The gen leman from Kentucky also
sa} s, that, to stop this sy stem, cuts off patronage
from the General Government, and throws it into
hands that can exercise it belter, and th?t ex-
penditures thus earned on are wasteful and
ext avasant, compared vv th the execution of pro-
jtcts carried on by States u prompted bv indivi-
dual ínteres*. This is most fue These argu-
ments he (Mr A ) re r embered to ha\ e seen stated
ni what he considered a mod una"swerab e speech,
del vertd on this ftVor mary vear? Mn*-e by a dis-
tinguished representative from Virginia, now on
t>e bench of the Supreme Coua of the United
St.-tes He was happy thai the force of these ar-
guments was now admitted, and that the lessons of
expenence had caused the abandonment of ths
odious and unjust system by some of those who had
honestly heretofore supported it
The argument that there is any obligation result-
ing trom a compact binding u-. to pass this bill, is
show n to be utterly futile The sjstem of internal
improvements recogn s°d in the Dill is admitted b}
i s former friends and suppor ets io be unequal,
na-tial, and unjust Wh_,, then he would ask,
shiil this s\s tin of inequality, i <ti lalav, and mjus-
i ce, be continued* Wh«t excuse can be ir"?gined
foi its con nuance? What re i on can we give to
our own consciences, or to our cons ¡tuents, for
passing this bill appropriating nearly half a million
of dollars, and more especial 1} it *be prese" time'
