HEADQUARTERS U. S. FORCES,Franklin, Tenn., February 11, 1863.

Brigadier General N. B. FORREST,

Commanding Confederate Forces.

GENERAL: Your communication in regard to the exchange of prisoners was received by Lieutenant Wilson and party, who met your messenger under flag of truce a few miles in advance of my lines and by whom they were promptly delivered.

All Confederate prisoners captured by my command since leaving Murfreesborough the 31st ultimo (except a few sick) have been sent to that place and Nashville to be disposed of according to Department orders regulating exchanges. Colonel Carroll and Major Rambaut have both been sent to Nashville.

I have no authority to negotiate an exchange of prisoners, general, and cannot therefore entertain your proposition however much I might desire to do so. Captain Von Minden's communication will be forwarded and an early exchange recommended.

Very respectfully, yours,

JEFF. C. DAVIS,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
