Public Lands—Mr. Harrison.
Ho. of Reps.
to the Constitution will furnish us a guide for the
purpose of learning what they now are The
Declaration oflndependence says
" We therefore, the representatives of the United States
of Amenca in Congress assembled, appealing to the Su
preine Judge of the worl 1 for therecututle ol our intentions
do in the name and by the authority of the good people ot
these colonies, solemnly publish and declare tint thei>e
united colonies are, and of right ought lo be, free and in
dependent States , that tliey ire absolved from all alie
gtance to the Bn isli Crown and that all political connec
non between them and the Stale of da it Britain is, and
ou2ht to be, lotailj dissolved , tnd that, as trel and inde
pendent States they have tail pawoi tokvy war, con
elude peace contract alliances establish commerce and
to do all otiicit acts and things which independent
States may ok rioht do "
Here, sit, you have a full and unequivocal ex-
planation of what was meant by " free and inde
pendent States" at that day And it must not
be foigotten thyit the word " State" is applied to
Gieat Britain, evidently meaning by the applica
tion of the term that it was an independent Powei
IF, then, these States had all the atlrtbutes of
sovereignty which belong to other independent
Poweis, how far was that soveieignty limited by
the Confederation' Exactly to the extent men
tioned in the second article Now, su, I put the
question to the House and the countiy, are the
new States, with tin conditions and ustiictions
thataie imposed upon them, as fiec, sovereign,
and independent as the old States' No, sir, they
aie not And the conclusion is inevitable th it
all such conditions and restuctions aie thciefoie
void
But, sir, I am answeicd by some, and told that
we tup bound by oui compacts—the compacts we
made with the Gencial Government at the time
of our admission into the Union I repiy, by
asking if any compact, oidmanee, or treaty, can
give a jieio powei to the Constitution' Can it
enlarge, dtminish, 01 in any respect whatever
modify the powcis of the Constitution? They
must conform to the Constitution, and not the
Constitution to them Thcio is no use for a Con-
stitution if such mtans can change its ehaiactei
The Constitution never had and ntver can have
but such as nicgianted powcis The power must
be delegated, or it cannot be used But the State s
—the new Suites—gave up c nun lights and
powers Did they, indeed Upon whose stein
demand woe the y give n up' Wi wiie fine id
to do it, or not allowed to como into tin Union
J'ut, gianting that they did give up vv lint you k
qu "ed of them, ran the G neial Government i<
eeivc them ' By what auihouty can sin n« ive
rights and powcifc. win I  diminish the Incdom
and independence ol the new Static, and on
large the splurc of hoi own If a Sute can
give up one power to the Gi n< ml Gove mine nt,
shi can give up auothei, until all aie given up,
and if a new State can do this, time is nothing
to pievent one of the old ones fiom doing the
same And, sn, if such a thing eem t iki place,
then the General Government cm (Ustioythe
Constitution, and biealc down all its bamris, by
the simple contrivance of compacts One ot the
lights which we have given up, is the right of
taxing yotu lands, a light which belongs to and
is lnscpariblc fiom sovereignty 11 is tin right
\ihich gives to a State the power of cnuying on
its opeiations It is the salient punciple ot po
litical existence, the fundamental element of the
life, the action, and the vigor of all communities
If it be true that we have given up the rights
as contended for, then indeed have we not only
given up sovereign rights which belong to the
other States of this Confederacy, but also that in
heient right of self preservation which belongs
'o eveiy people, and lies at the bottom of all Gov
ernments You have, for instance, in the Sutes
c f Louisiana, Arkansas, and Missoun, immense
bodies of land subject to inundation, and coveied
■sutil impenotiable swamps, that are the fiuitful
sources of disease and death They have been
untouched ever since the country was acquued
ficm Fiance, without an eifort on your pait to
íemove the evil According to your doctrine, we,
although fiee and independent State", being as
f e", so\eieign,and independent as the old States,
cannot do it, because the lands aie yours, and any
attempt on  our pait to do so would be a trespass
pon your domain, which might, perhaps, subject
as to an action for tiespass committed upon so
much of your lands covered with water Have we
no power to abate such a nuisance without being
called to an account for it' Have we not the
right, common to all Governments on earth, of
taking care of our people and preserving then
health and their lives fiom the contagious effects
of such loathsome and fatal nuisances ' Will any
man here tell me that a community of people
may exist as a governmen without the powei of
protecting itself fiom destruction' I turn with
disgust fiom the thought It is an inherent, in-
defeasible, and inalienable right, which we can-
not give away, and which cannot be taken fiom
us without sweeping fiom under us the very
foundations upon which aie built the hbeities of
all just Governments
Accoidmg to the right which you claim, you
fittei us in such a way as to deprive us, too, of
all the means of moving on with the march of the
age in all those woilts of internal improvement
which constitute the glory of those who have
undertaken them, those woiks which are almost
annihilating distance and time, infusing a new
life into society, icorgamzing the elements out of
which it is composed,and developing powers and
lesources which the startled senses can scarcely
ye t lialize We cannot constiuct a load oi dig
a canal without yom peimission The hnds aie
yowi, and wc would be v olating public ftitlut we
daied to exercise those common attnbu cs of
soveieignty which belong to all Governments—
of rallying on a system ot internal improvement,
nccoiding to our own will We cannot impiove
the condition of our people, we cannot contnbute
to our own piospenty, wc cannot increase the
facilities of communication foi cither traveling or
carrying our suiplus produce to maiket, we can
not develop our lesoutccs, we can do nothing that
an independent State ought to do Wheiever we
turn we see your non gtasp wherever we move
we fid its power Should we desne to construct
a road or dig a canil, we must do as you did when
you weie, as we are now, colonus of an unre
lenting Power, to piopitiate whose favor, and to
gi t what your \i i y necessities requned,you were
coinpelleel to kn el in the attitude of a servile ap-
| hcaut, btsieeluug ami supplicating it the foot

(lei ' jou, oi that it is the pioject of some ltmv
ish spieul itioti Su, to my knowledge, applica
ti in lies lie en made- to you, time attci time, for
the i ight of wiy only ti const! letn i ulroad from
the li in Mount tin, in my Sute, one of the gi eat
est natui il cuiiosities in the known wotld to the
Mississippi nvii and to this hour we have not
jet succeeded in this most modest and modélate
íeeiiust
it is thus, sir, that we are depnved of all those
ficilmes which lead on to the advincement and
piospenty ofapeople,and stimulate them to noble
eve ition
But, m anothei point of view, I contend that
the compacts which you have m xde with the new
States are void, for a noil compliance on youi
pait of those stipulations which you have obli-
gated yourselves to perfoim
It will be seen, by a reference to all the com-
parts made between the new States and the Gen
oral Government, that the Government bound
itself to apply a certain poition of the money
arising from the sales of the lands to construct
roads from the waters of the Atlantic to the sev
eial States respectively The States, on then
part, agreed to ceitain conditions that ueie re
quned, and which are mentioned in the compact
Have you kept youi piomi<¡es with the States'
Have you observed the obligations which you
solemnly stipulated to peifoim' Where aie the
loads you were to make' Many of these com
pacts have been madefor moie than twenty years,
and, with the exception ot the Cumbeiland road
through Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois, you have not
made a move, nor have you even evinced an in
tention of miking amove, toweids fulfilling the
solemn obligations of youi plighted faith     Tell
me not of the promises that would be broken, the
faith that would be violated by the propositions
I have introduced     Wheie is youi  own faith '
Have you kept it'    What excuse can you lender
to the injured States who have relied so long and
so implicitly on your plighted word '    Have we
not, in eveiy instance, and to the very letter, kept
all the promises we made you'    Have you evei
complained of us foi a violation of faith'   And
yet we are constantly having homilies pleached
to us about the observance of public faith '   The
conditions and stipulations which weie entered
into at the time of the admission of the States
were mutual and concurrent     They were made
foi the  íeciprocal benefit of both  parties     We
have performed, on oui part,all that you íequired,
and all that can be demanded     You have done
nothing, and in the faceof this gioss violation of
I your own obligations, you give us a lecture about
I the impottance of preserving public faith    Now,
sir, by eveiy principle of the construction of com-
I pacts, where theie aie mutual obligations to be
performed by both, anon compliance on the part
I of one for an unreasonable length of time, of
¡ those engagements which the paity was bound
i to perfoim, discharges the othei party fiom the
perfoi manee of his obligations, and completely
and effectually annuls the agreement
But some gentlemen take the ground that there
is no power in the Constitution that authouzes
the Geneial Government to constiuct woiks of
internal improvement If there be none, then these
compacts are void, because the Government en-
tered into an engagement to fulfill an impossible
obligation—to execute a powei which did not
belong to them, the consideiation for which foi med
the stipulations which the States, on their part,
assumed When gentlemen who hold this doc-
trine talk of our violating public faith, they have
íeason to be more piudent and circumspect when
they look upon this act of the Government—an
act that transcends in enoimity a breach of prom-
ise, or a violation of faith, foi, having no power
to carry out and perform its obligations, it was
the double act of fiaud and deception to come
under such re sponsibilities
1 know, su , that my doctrines are unpalatable
Many aie stauled and seem terrified at the bold-
ness of mv piopositions But, sir, the doctrine la
not new Would to God 1 could claim to be the
author of it It has justice, truth, and íeason as
the eteinal foundation upon which it rests, and
difies the test of human scrutiny, and the search-
ing analysis of the piofoundest ability The same
doctrine has found advocates in other quaiters,
and in other times Ohio took the ground in a
memorial to Congress, in which, although she
was asking the permission of Congress to sell her
sixteenth section, she claimed it as an inketent
light to do of her own accoid, all that she re-
quested of Congress And when is Ohio now'
I'aithless to all her former professions and doc-
tnnes, she has taken sides with those that denom-
inate us plundeiers and land pirates Rich in
population, nch in resources, with but a few
ncies of the public lands remaining unsold within
hei limits, she turns traitoi to all her former prin-
ciples, and, with giacious complacency, under
takes to pieach to us lectures upon the enormity
of violating public faith ' This is the unkindest
i ut of all And I cannot think of it without being
foicibly lemmded of the memorable expiession
of Cossar in the hands of his assassins, when his
eye caught the form of his friend Brutus among
them, " Hi (it Biute "
Tennessee also took the same ground after she
became a State, and the difficulty which giewout
of it between her and North Caiolma, as the
lands lying within hei limits were to go mainly
for the benefit of Noith Carolina, was not settled
until in 1806, when, by an act of Congiess, the
matter was compromised and ananged
Indiana m 1829 assumed the giound as broadly
as I have done, without qualification or reserva-
tion     Whether she is to act the part of Oh o I
will not say, but I must acknowledge I have my
, suspicions
Louisiana and Illinois seem, from certain me
I moríais of theiis, to be strongly inclined to the
doctime, although   they have  not assumed the
i doctrine in bioad terms    But, sn, it is not alone
I the new States, or those fiom the new States,
