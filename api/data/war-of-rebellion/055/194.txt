Report of Colonel Francis T. Sherman, Eighty-eighth Illinois Infantry, commanding First Brigade.

HDQRS. FIRST BRIG., SECOND DIV., FOURTH ARMY CORPS, Knoxville, E. Tennessee, January 22, 1864.

SIR: I have the honor to submit the following report of the part taken by the First Brigade at the battle of Mission Ridge on November 25, 1863:

On Monday, the 23d, my brigade was ordered to be in readiness to move to the front and beyond our lines of works at Chattanooga at 1 p.m. At the hour named the brigade marched, following the Third Brigade, and took position with my right resting on the Dalton road. By command of General Sheridan, the brigade was drawn up in two lines. The first was, by my order, placed under the command of Colonel Silas Miller, Thirty-sixth Infantry Illinois Volunteers. The second line was by me placed under command of Colonel B. Laiboldt, Second Missouri Infantry Volunteers. During the afternoon the brigade lines were advanced 600 yards, and remained in position during the night, the men sleeping on their arms.

At 3 a.m. of the 24th, I received orders to move the brigade by the left, and take position in reserve and rear of the Third Brigade, which was promptly done. At 4 a.m. orders were received to place three regiments of my brigade on the right of the Third Brigade, in prolongation of their first line, behind hastily constructed rifle-pits. In obedience to this order the Forty-fourth Illinois, Thirty-sixth Illinois, and the Seventy-third Illinois were thus placed, and Colonel W. W. Barrett, Forty-fourth Illinois, assigned to take command of them. The Eighty-eighth Illinois and Seventy-fourth Illinois were placed in rear, as support to the above regiments.

This disposition of the brigade remained unchanged until 12 m. of the 25th, when the entire division line was moved forward some 300
