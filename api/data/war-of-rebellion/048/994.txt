past 2 a.m., December 29, 1863. The infantry arrived at the barracks about 8 p.m.

It was the original intention to send Colonel E. H. Ripley, of the North Vermont Volunteers, in command of a detachment to operate at and about Swansborough, and form a junction with me at Saunders' Mills, but, in the absence of the enemy at Swansborough, it became unnecessary. Colonel Ripley accompanied me throughout and was of great assistance to me. The infantry, under command of Lieutenant-Colonel McNary, marched a distance of 70 miles in a period of fifty-two hours, during that time performing the necessary guard, picket, and scouting duty.

The advance guard was commanded by Lieutenant Budlong, of Mix's (New York) Cavalry, who performed his duty well.

Lieutenant King, acting Assistant Inspector-General, who acted as aide-de-camp; Lieutenant Gerard, acting Assistant Quartermaster, and Lieutenant Connolly, acting aide-de-camp, of my staff, deserve my best thanks for the prompt and efficient manner in which they performed the duties assigned to them.

Had I been furnished with the means of mounting infantry, as I anticipated, the original plan of the expedition would have been carried out with complete success, as our movement was a total surprise, even citizens living within a short distance of the captured picket stations being ignorant of out presence up to 11 a.m. of the 28th.

My thanks are due to Conductor Covell for the energy he displayed in hastening the transportation of troops from Morehead to Newport and return.

All of which is submitted for the information of the general commanding.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. JOURDAN,

Colonel, Commanding.

Major B. B. Foster,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

DECEMBER 28-31, 1863 - SCOUTS FROM VIENNA TO HOPEWELL GAP, WHITE PLAINS, ETC. VA., AND SKIRMISH.

Report of Colonel Charles R. Lowell, jr., Second Massachusetts Cavalry.

Vienna, Va.,

December 31, 1863.

COLONEL: I have the honor to report that the parties sent from here Monday night have returned. They scouted through Hopewell Gap, White Plains, Landmark, Middleburg, upperville, Philomont, and Mountville, one party returning through Dranesville.

Mosby's cavalry had met at Rectortown (not Rector's Cross-Roads) Monday forenoon. A dispatch from the Army of the Potomac led us to expect clothing had been issued to them on that day, and that they had been ordered to meet again on Tuesday, but our presence and some movement from the Army of the Potomac prevented this. No body of troops was found together in any part of the route,
