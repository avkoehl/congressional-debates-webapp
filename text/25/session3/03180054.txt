equity, to make this distinction between the cit-
izens of the old and new States' He could see
none, and he thought that none existed
Mr C said if we were compelled to acton this
subject at the present time, he was for restricting
the operations of the bill as much as possible But
he thought it very unwise at this session to ¡egis
late at all upon this subject, for reasons he had
given at a former day, but if we aie to act, let us
conform to the sense of the Senate as expressed
in their instructions The ¡senate, by their vote
on that question, declaied tit intention to be to
hmit the advantages of the bill to actual settlers
He was for sustaining that declaration,and trusted
there Would be no enlargement of its provisions
After the question was taken on the recommit-
ment, and decided in the affirmative, an appeal was
made by different Senators to the mover [Mr
Clay, of Kentucky) to withdraw the call for the
yefts and Days on the instructions to confine the
provisions of the bill to actual settlers, to which
he assented
Mr SMITH, of Indiana, objected, he said he
had voted to recommit the bill, but it was with a
knowledge that the question upon the instructions
was still pending, without the instructions he
could nothavegiven that vote He nowrequned
that the yeas and nays shall be put upon the Jour
rials that it may be seen who are the fuendsof the
actual settler in preference to the speculator His
previous vote would then be fully explained He
went for graduation, but he wished the benefit of
the reduced price to inure to the actual settler
Mr CLAY, of Kentucky, was not aware that
lie exhibited this morning anything like the bold-
ness which had been attributed to him by the
Senator from Mississippi It was a quality of
which he never boasted, and of which he did not
believe he was particularly deficient The bold-
ness which he exhibited, according to the Senator
from Mississippi, was an attempt to airay the old
States against the new, and to contrast their pop-
ulation Now, ¡f there had been an attempt to
discriminate between the old and new States, it
was the amendment brought in by the Senator
from Mississippi and his colleague on the com
tmttee and even admitting that there had been
an extraordinary dpgiee of boldness, it was not
exhibited till it was necessary to speak the tuuh
What was the proposition of the Senator fiom
Mississippi > It was to disfranchise the old States,
to cut oil tiom the puvil°gesof tins bill the thirteen
old States who established our independence, in
favor ot the occupants in the new fetates The
object ot the Senate, on a foimer occasion, was to
restnot the settlements to emigrants fiom all the
States, but not content with that restriction, it
was pioposed to extend the privilege to owners
of lands in the laige States who have been settled
ior vears to make grants to them at the ej-pense
of the freeholders of Virginia, Pennsylvania, and
the othei old States
Mi   C denied that he hid attempted to anay
the old States against the new    It wis the gentle
men  who repelled  every attempt to make  this
common piopertyconducivelo the common benefit
—who seek, in  Ihe way of „radu ition  and pie
emption laws, to secme  exclusive privileges for
their own States, and  the mc merit i proposition
was made to íer der the ben eh s fiom tl is common

is ir ¡unous to the new bta es "   Mi   C  said that
no [art of lis policy evei looked to a smjle sec
Uon    His object had been to seek the good of the
whole
B it the Senator from Mississippi tells us that if
theie has been a discrimination, it was made by
me in tne proposition to limit the light to pur-
i hase to ctual settlers, at the reduced price 1 his
he denied His proposition applied to a'l the
inhabitants of all the States who chose to emigrate
and settle down on the public lands     His prcpn
won was not limited to any part of the Union
it was offered to all the poor and indigent m all
quaiteis of the Union In regard to the resident

Mr C concluded with some remarks in reply
to the argument of Mr Smith, of Indiana, that
the settlement enhanced the value of the remaining
lands
Mr ROANE said, that throughout the whole
discussion of this interesting subject, during the
last session of Congress, he had contented him-
self with giving a silent vote against a bill similar
to that now unaerconsideration Heshould have
puisued the same course on the present occasion,
but for the remaiks which have fallen from
the honorable Senator fiom Mississippi, [Mr
Whker ] He íose to repel the idea that Vw
g ma, in any nart of her conduct, past or present,
has ever manifested the slightest jealousy towards
the new States, or the possibility that such a feel
mg can ex st He would furthermoie inform that
Senator, that whatever he might think of the de
sire of the Senator from Kentucky [Mr Clay] to
excite the jealousy of 'he old States, especially
Vngima, against the new ones, that it is far above
the power of that eloquent Senator, even if he di
sired so to do, (which I am sure he does not,) or
of any mortal man, to excite such a feeling Vir
gima jealous of the new Slates' Why, sir, they
aie the flesh of hei flesh, and blood of her blood
There has been no earthly cause foi jealousy,
there never can be any It has always been her
high pride to have contnbuted as much as she
has done towards their birth and then growth
As long as the hardy and enterpusirg sons of
Virginia left her barren or her exhausted soil,
and for a moderate price purchased pubhc land as
rich as the banks of the Nile, their mother State
had no other feeling than that of the gratification
and pleasure at knowing, that whilst in the far
West they had greatly bettered their own condition,
they had, at the same time, contributed laigely to
the productive labor of the nation, and the best
interests of all the States, for which she had made
so many generous sacrifices, and foi which only
was the land ceded by her to the United Spates
She has had cause, sir, to enjoy moie than this
oidmary share of parental pleasure Whilst
looking through your legislative, executive, and
judicial halls, in all time past and present, she
has felt her bosom throb with pride and j )y, at
seeing her enterprising sons, fiom all the States
and Temtories to which thev had migrated, sit
ting on their benches, and distinguished for then
talents and their patriotism Away, then, with
the idea of the jealousy of Virginia of the giowth
and prosperity of her daughters and sisters of the
Wet As well might you talk about the jealousy
of the home bee, of the sedulous laborers who
íange abroad, and return loaded with honey ex-
tracted fiom every flovver of the forest, for the
common benefit of the whole hive As well might
you talk of a jealousy of our hardy tars, who
duve our noble merchantmen into every sea, and
return to our ports fiejghted with the rich products
of every clime Sir, I oppose this bill, not from
any feeling of jealousy, but because 1 do most
conscientiously think it illegal and unjust The
land to which it relates wis ceded for the common
benefit of all the States Here, su, aie the very
woids of the grant made by Virginia, and if the
draughtsman of thosearticles of cession could hav e
foreseen a purpose to divert these lands from the
objects in contemplation, he could not have used
stronger language After making certain reser
vations, the articles of cession say, that all the
remaining land "shall le considei ed as a common
'fund for the use and bci efit of such of the United
' ¡states as have become or shall beco-ne membci s of the
' ( onfedei of ion or Pedei al alliance of the said Slates,
' fnginia mchmic, accoidmg to then usual tespett
' we prono) lions in the general chaige and expend
Uuie, an 1 shall be faithfully 3.na bona fide diSDOsed
' of  fo   that purpose, and for no other use or pui
'pose w i ttsoeiei "    These, sir, are the terms of
the cession      Can vvords bestiongef—can  Ian
gu igel e | lime- than this3   But, sir, how has this
' comnon fund" been   disposed of   I will not
now dwell upon the millions of a res wr ich have
b en diverted fiom it 'o pin ale and local pirposes
As lonir, mi, as people viol J cioss the Atlantic
ocean, °nd buy the pi blic lands at the very lew
puce al   i/s demanded ioi them, the public good
was gteatiy advanced, became we were, by that
process, süpp'ied with one o' out j,i e Uest wants—
population As long as fertile public lands could
be purchased attheGovernmentpiice by our poor
and enterpnsmg citizens of the old States, tne
public interest Was greatly promoted byimpiov-
ing the industry and increasing the wealth of the
nation at large But, sir, whenever the intention
or the effect of any measure m regard to the pub-
lic lands ¡s to diveit them from the purposes for
which they were so obviously, and, m my opinion,
so justly designed, or without adding one soul to
the population of the United States, oi one iota to
their wealth, the effect is merely and only to bans-
pose"people from the Hast to the West—yes, sir,
to induce them to leave good lands and comfort-
able healths, to settle On the " lefuse lands" in ths
new States, merely to swell their population, 1 for
one will enter my dissent
Mr President, Virginia has been drained of
much of her wealth and her population, and With
it has gone many, very many of her men of enter-
prise, genius, and talent, but, sir, of this we have
never complained, because, although it might bea
local loss, it nevertheless contributed to the gen-
eral good of the whole Union, and, sir, should that
free and voluntary emigration to the fertile lands
of the West continue till Virginia should become
l a deserted wilderness, there could be no just cause
of complaint What I do complain of is this, that
a sponge should be applied to her surface, to take
up from it every remaining soul, and to squeeze
them out upon the " refuse lands," the pine bar-
rens, and sand hi'lsof the new States, That when
i theie is no more pubhc land worth cultivating left
in the new States, a bounty should be offered to
I the inhabitants of the old ones to come and settle on
their "refuse lands " But, Mr   President, 1 see
I that this bill takes care to permit all persons own-
ing lands adjacent to the public lands, as Well as
the actual settler, to purchase a section (six hun-
dí ed and forty acres) at the reduced price of seven
ty five cents an acre, and goes on most carefully
to piovide, that after having purchased those six
hundred and forty acies at that price, they may
be at liberty to purchase as much more as they
may choose, at the piesent Government price of
§1 25 per acre, and, sir, it is not hazaidirgmuch
to say tnat land that is not worth $1 2d, is not
worth seventy five cents The effect of this bill,
if it passes, will be to enable the landholders con-
tiguous to the public lands, to enlarge greatly
their domains, at a very reduced price It is an
old saying, that poor land is nota safe friend, but
an excellent neighbor Sir, who that has a feitile
tract of land which he wishes to bring into full
cultivation, does not know the value of poor con-
tiguous lands' He can well afford to pay a good
price foi them, whether his object be to keep off
bad neighbors, to obtain water, f uel, timber,range,
minerals, or anything else, even, sir, to swell his
acres, and gratify his pude by enlarging his do-
main In every possible view which I can take
of this subject, not omitting that containea in the
report of the Committee on Finance, and the ac
companying letter of the Secretary of the Tieas-
uiy, which I have carefully read, 1 am constrained
to vote against the amendment, and against the
bill, and in so doing, I declare again, that I have
no other interest or feeling than a settled convic-
tion that they are in violation of lav,, justice,and
equity
Mr Piesident,! cannot resume my seat without
expressing my sincere wish that this whole sub-
ject could, in some manner satisfactory and just to
all, be withdrawn from the scope of our legisla
tion It is a delicate, intricate, and important
subject It is every day becoming moie and more
unpleasant, and sooner than that, which was in-
tended by our forefathers as a bond of cement,
and a iund of wealth to us all, should become a
bitter apple of discord among friends and brethien,
I for one am wi'hng to vote for any measure which
the united wisdom, justice, and patriotism of Con
gress may devise, to dispose, finally and forever (f
this subject, as one of national legislation I would
do this not because /have any material objection
to our land system, but, su, I would do it for
peace, harmony and fnet «ship B it, Mr Piesi
dent, until some such meisi -e shall be adopted, I
never wi'I, whilst I retain a seat here, vote foi
laws in regard to this subject which neither my
understanding noi my conscience can sanction
