APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
26th Cong......2-«d Sess.
Message of ihe Prtbi'hnt.
of tbe preceding year, and nine or ten millions less
than those of 1837. Nor has it been found neces-
sary, in order to produce this result, to resort to the
power conferred by Congas?, of pi stpomng cer-
tain classes of the pub n work , except by defer-
ring expenditures fcr a shoit period upon a limited
portion of them, and «Inch postponement term -
nated some time s'nee, at the moment the Trea
sury Department, by further receipts from the in-
debted banks, became fully assured of its ability 'o
meet them without prejudice to the public service
in other respects. Causes are in operation which
will, it is believed, j notify a «ill furiher reduction,
without injury to any important national interest.
The expenses of sustaining tbe troops employed in
Florida have been gradually and greatly reduced,
through the persevering efforts of tne War Depart-
ment; and a reasonable hope may b° entertained that
the necessity for military operations n that quarter
Will soon cease. Tne removal of the Indiana from
wi'hin our settled borders is nearly completed. The
pension list, one of the heaviest charges upon the
Treasury, is rapidly diminishing by death. The
most costly of our public buildings are either
finished, or nearly so; and we may, I think, safely
promise ourselves a continued exemption from bor-
der difficulties
The available balance in the Treasury on the
first of January next is estimated at one million
and a half of dollars. This sum, with the ex-
pected receipts from all sources during the next
year, will, it is believed, be sufficient to enable the
Government to meet every engagement, and leave
a suitable balance in the Treasury at the end of the
year, if the remedial measures connected with the
customs and the public land*, heretofore recom-
mended, shall be adop'ed, and the new apptoprla-
tions by Congress shall not carry the expenditures
beyond the official estimates.
The new system established by Congress for the
safekeeping of ¡he public money, prescribing the
kind of currency to be received for the pub-
lic revenue, and providing additional guaids and
securities against losies, has now been several
months m operation Al hough it might be prema-
ture, upon an experience ef such limited duration,
to form a definite opinion in regard to the extent of
its influences in correcting many evils under which
the Federal Government and the country have hi-
therto suffered, espfcially tho«e that have grown
out of banking expinsions, a depr ciateJ cuuency,
and offical defalcations, jet it is bat right to say
that nothing has occurred in t*~e practical opera-
tion of the system to weaken in the s'ightest degree,
but much to strengthen the confident anticipations
of its friends. The grounds of these have been
heretofore so fully explained, as to require no reca-
pitulation. In respect to the facility and conve-
nience it affords in conducting the public service,
and the ability of the Government to discharge
through its agency every du'y attendant on the col-
lection, transfer, and disbursement of the public
money with promptuuda and success, I can say
with confidence that the apprehensions oí those who
lelt it to be their duty to oppose its adoption, have
proved to be unfounded. On the contrary, this
branch of the fiscal affairs of the Government has
been, and it is believed may always be, thus car-
ried on with every desirable facility and security.
A few changes aid improvements in the details of
the system, without affecting any principles involv-
ed in it, will be submitted to you by th¿ Secretary
of the Treasury, and will, I am sure, receive at
your bands that attention to which they may, on
examination, be found to be entitled.
I have deemed this brief nummary of our fiscal
affairs necessary to the due perfoi¡nance of a duty
specially enjoined upon me by the CoaiH'a ion. it
will serve, also, to illustrate more fu'ly the pnnci-
ples by which I have been guided m reference lo
two contested points n our pubLc policy, which
were earliest in their development, and have been
more important m their ooi sequences, than any that
have arisen under our complicated and difficult,
yst admirable, system of Government: I allude to,
a national deb', and a national bank. It was in
these that the political contests by which the coun-
try has been agitated ever since the adoption of the
Constituiion, in a great measure, originated; and
there is too much reasoi to apprehend that the con-
flicting interests and o¡ posing principles thus mar-
sha'led, will continue, as h retofore, to produce
similar, if not aggravated, consequences.
Coming lii'o office the declared enemy of both,
I have earnestly endeavo ed to prevent a report to
either.
The consideration that a large public debt affords
an apology, and produces, in some negree, a neces-
sity also, for resorting to a S)stem and extent of
taxation wh'ch is not only oppressive throughout,
bat likewise so aft lo lead, in the end, to the com-
mission ot that mc«t odious of all offences against
the principles of Republican government—tre pros-
titution ot political power, conferred for the gen ral
benefit, to the aggrancizement of particular classes,
and the gratification of md vidual cupidity—<s
alone sufficient, independently ot the ve.ghty ob-
j ct'ons which have already been urged, to render
its creation and ex.stence the sources of bitter and
unappeasable discord If wc add to this, its inevi-
table tendency to produce and foster extravagant
expenditures of the pnbbc monpv, by wh>ch a
necessity is created for new loans and new
burdens on tne people, ard, finally, if we
refer t > the examples of every Government which
has existed, for pro f how se'dom i* is that the
system, when ores adopted ao.d implanted m
the policy of a country, has failed to expand itself,
until public credit was exhausted, and the peop'e
were no longer ab'e t> enjute its increasing
weight, it seems impossible lo ¡e--ist the conclu-
sion, that no benefits resulting irom its career, no
extent of conquest, no accession ot wealth to par-
fcular classes, nor aDy, nor a'l i s combined ad-
vantages, can counterbalance Us ultimate but cer-
tain results—a splendid* Government, and an im-
poverished people.
If a National Bank was, as is um'en'ab'e, re-
pudiated by the framers of the Constitution as
incompatible with th° rights of the States and the
liberties of the people, i', from the beginning, it
has teen regarded by large portions of our citizens
as coming m direct coIUm n \u h hat great and
vital amendment of the Constitution, which de-
clares that all powers rot c^me-rei by 'h't insir'i-
ment on the General Government are reserved to
the States ?nd to the people, it i lias been viewed
by them as the first great s ep in the march of lati-
tudmous construction, wh eh, unchecked, womd
r nder ih->t sacred instinrrent of as lit le ^altie ns-
an unwritten Cmstitutien, depem'ent, as nvonld
alone be, for its meaning, on thi  m'eies'ed m er-
pretat on of a dominant party, rnd afford ng no se-
curity to the rights oí the atirió!, , if such !•> unde-
niably the ca«e, what r? íonal g cinds could have
been conceived for anti lpating aught but de. er-
mmed opposition to such an in*t tufon at the pre-
sent day
Coulda different re-ulthavebe n expected, when
the consequences which have flowed from its cre-
ation, and pirticularlv from l's st'uigl^s to
perpetuate its existenc , had confirmed, in so
striking a manner, the apprehensions of its earli-
est opponent?; when it had been so e'early
demonstrated that a concentrated money power,
wielding so vast a capital, and combining such in-
calculable means of influence, may, in those pe-
culiar conjunctures to which this Government is
unavoidably exposed, prove an overmatch for tre
political power of the people themselves; when the
true character of its cap-jcity to fgu'ate, according
to us will and its interests, std the in'erests of i's
favori'es, the value and production of the lab r
and property of ever/ man in tmsextenlei coun-
try, had been so faily and fearfully developed,
when it was notorious that a'l classes of th s gre?t
community bad, by means of the powei and mfiu
ence it thus p-s.eses, be-n inf c'vd 'o rradness
wi ha spirit of h-edlecs spccu'auon, nhen it had
been seen that, secure in tbe s jppoit of the combi
nation of mfluerces by vhich it was surr mrded, it
could vio'ale its charter, ard set the law-, at defi-
ance with impunity, and when, too, it h~d become
most apparent ihst to be leve that such an seeumti-
lation of powers can ever be graaied without the
certainty of being abused, v<as to indulge in a fatal
delusion?
To avoid the necessity of a permanent debt, and
Sen. & H. of Repg.
its inevitable consequences, I have advocated, and
endeavored ti carry into effect, the policy of con-
finisg the appropriations for the public  service
to such ob,°cts only as  are'.clearly  withm  the
constitut'onal authority of  the Federal  Govern-
ment; of excluding from its expenses those impro-
vident and unauthorized grants of public mosey
for works of internal improvement, which were
so wisely arrested by the constitutional  interpo-
sition ot my predecessor, and which, if they had
not  been   so   checked,   would long  before   this
time   have   involved   the   finances   of  the Ge-
neral Governm-nt m embarrassments far greater
than those which are no v experienced by any of
ihe States, of limiting all our expenditures to that
simple, unostentatious, and economical administra-
l on of pnbl'c affairs, which is alone consistent
with the character of our institutions, of collecting
annually from ihe cus'oms, and the sales of public
land", a revenue fully adequate to defray all the ex-
penses thus incurred, but, under no pretence what-
soever, to itrpose taxes upon the people to a greater
amount than was actually necessary to the public
serv ce, conduc ed upon the principles I have stated.
In lieu of a national bank, or a dependence upon
banks cf anv t'escnption, for the management of
our fiscal affair ,1 recommended the aioption of
the system which  is now in successful operation.
TKit sjs'em affords every requisite facility for the
transaction c f the pecuniary concerns of the Go-
vernment, will, it is eonfidently anticipated, pro-
duce in other respec s many of the benefits which
have been from time to time expected from the
ereaiion of a nai oral bank, but which have never
been realized, avoid the manifold evils inseparable
from such an institutior; diminish, to a greater ex-
tent than could be accomplisned by any other mea-
sure of reform, the patronage of the Federal Go-
vernment—a wise policy in all Governments, but
more especially so in one like ours, which works
well only in proportion as it is made to rely for its
support upon the unbiassed and unadulterated opi-
nions of its constituents, d  away, forever, all de-
pendence on corporate bodies either m the raising,
col'ecting, safekeeping, or  disbursing the public
re* enues, and place the Government equally above
the temptation of fostering a dangerous and uncon-
stitutional institution at home, or the neceiiity of
adapting its policy ta the tows and interests of a
still more formidable money-power abroad.
ft is by adop'irg and carrjmg out these princi-
oles, under circumstances the most ¿rduous and
discouraging, 'hat the attempt has been made, thus
f<ir successfully, to demonstrate to the people of the
United States that a National Bank at all times; and
a national debt, except it be incurred at a period
when he hor>or and safpty of the nation demand
the temporary saCrific of a p )1 cy, wh ch should
only be abandoned m such exigencies, are not
merely unnecessary, but m direct and deadly hos-
tdity to ihe principles of their Government, and to
their own permanent welfare.
Tne progress made in the developement of these
positions-, appears in the preceding sketch of tbe
past history and present sta'e of the financial con-
cerns of the Federal Government. The faefs there
stated fully authorize tbe assertion, that all the pur-
poses for which tbw Government was instituted
have been accomplished durirg four years of great-
er pecuniary embarrassment than were ever before
experienced in time of peace, and in the face of op-
position as forraidab'e as any that was ever before
arrajed agaitio' the policy of an Administration;
tbat this has b°en done when the ordinary revenues
cf the Government were generally decreasing, as
w 11 from the operalioi i/ the laws, as the condi-
tion ot ih" country, w.itfa'>ut the creation oí a per-
ifirnent public debt, or incjrntigany liaoiUty, other
t >aa such as tbe i idinary resources of the Govern-
ment -will *ne=f.ily disc  arge, and without the
rgency of a Nitional Bank.
If this view of the proceedings cf the Govern-
ment, for ihe period it embraces, be warranted by
tbe facts as hey aie known to exist; if the army
and navy hive been sustained to the full extent
authorized b> law, and which Congress deemed suf-
ficient for the defence of the country and the
protection of its rights and itshenor, if its civil and
diplomatic service has been equslly sustained; if
