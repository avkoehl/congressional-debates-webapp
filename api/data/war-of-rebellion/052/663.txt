General McPherson has been compelled to send his largest division to Steele and another to Natchez. His garrison at Vicksburg is small, and we must keep up that picket on the Valley road, relieving it by a new one weekly. You can take all the horses of Corse's scouts except 10, and send Corse's scouts to him. Mount as many as you can to serve as scouts and patrols to your front. Send Corse's scouts to him to-day; he needs them as messengers.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.

GENERAL: Official information having just been received from General Steele that he is in Little Rock, and that Price is retreating, pursued by Davidson, I have, by direction of Major-General Grant, ordered Brigadier General John E. Smith to return to this place with his command without disembarking it, unless General Steele has some important move on hand which renders it necessary that he should remain for the present.

GENERAL: Your communication of the 13th reached me here. I was at the points your speak of myself, but neither saw nor heard of any indications of guerrillas.

If anything occurs requiring immediate action, will you please notify me here, until Captain Phelps returns to his station. I can sooner meet requisitions for gunboats.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
