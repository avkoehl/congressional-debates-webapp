General Wood will march for Pace's Ferry at 5 a. m. to-morrow. After examination, I concluded to start a trestle bridge, and will try to finish it by to-morrow night.

GENERAL: In consequence of Major-General Sherman wishing to wait until he hears from General Stoneman before crossing the Fourteenth Corps, the major-general commanding directs me to write that you need not move your division down the river in the morning, as heretofore ordered, but await further orders in your present camp.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

GENERAL: A pontoon bridge will be laid at Pace's Ferry to-morrow morning probably by 8 o'clock.

As soon as you get one division across please relieve General Howard's division and permit it to return to its camp.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WM. D. WHIPPLE,
