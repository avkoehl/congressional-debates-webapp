DEPARTMENT OF STATE, Washington, October 23, 1861.

Major General N. P. BANKS, &amp;c.

GENERAL: I learn that Mr. Barnard, who is an agent of the Associated Press, is with your army. Information which leaves no room for mistake satisfies me that until last May he was an agent of the disunionist press in this city. You will I think do well to have his correspondence strictly observed and to guard against any treachery on his part.

I am, general, your obedient servant,

WILLIAM H. SEWARD.

DEPARTMENT OF STATE, Washington, October 23, 1861.

ROBERT MURRAY, Esq., U. S. Marshal, New York.

SIR: Complaints still come that the comforts which might be allowed the prisoners at Fort Lafayette are not enjoined by them. Although these complaints have their origin in reports which arose before you went there to look after the comfort of the prisoners you will proceed again to the fort and remedy what admits of remedy. * * *

I am, sir, your obedient servant,

WILLIAM H. SEWARD.

DEPARTMENT OF STATE, Washington, October 23, 1861.

DAVID H. CARR, Esq., U. S. Marshal, New Haven, Conn.

SIR: Your communication* of the 17th instant addressed to the Honorable Simon Cameron, Secretary of War, and by him referred to this Department has been received. In reply you are authorized to arrest and send to Fort Lafayette any persons engaged in inducing soldiers to desert or otherwise obstructing the recruiting officers in the discharge of their duties. It is to be hoped that the exercise of this authority in a few cases will serve as an example which will deter the class of persons referred to from their disloyal practices.

I am, sir, your obedient servant,

F. W. SEWARD,

Assistant Secretary.

WASHINGTON, October 25, 1861.

Honorable SECRETARY OF STATE.

DEAR SIR: I returned from Canada this morning. I found at the Clifton House, Niagara Falls, a large number of prominent secessionists who have just returned from Europe. I would like an order for the arrest and conveyance to Fort Lafayely and O. B. Caruthers, the first named being a member of the so-called Confederate Congress at this time. These traitors are awaiting an opportunity to go South. They have very important correspondence in their possession some of which I have seen. I am confident I shall succeeded in inducing them to visit our side of the river, which of course will be the only opportunity of arresting them.

Yours, very respectfully,

L. C. BAKER.
