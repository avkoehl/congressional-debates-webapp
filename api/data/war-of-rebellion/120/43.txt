ALTON, ILL., April 13, 1864.

Colonel JAMES A. HARDIE, Inspector-General U. S. Army:

COLONEL: I have the honor to submit the following inspection report of Alton military prison, Ill.:

Commanding officer, Colonel William Weer, Tenth Kansas Volunteer Infantry. Colonel Weer is an intelligent but very intemperate man. He was drunk when I saw him, and in my opinion is entirely unfit to hold any position in the military service of the United States. I cannot too strongly urge his removal from the command of this post. Colonel Weer has in his possession $493. 88 belonging to the prison fund.

Sutler appointed by the Secretary of War. Sales restricted to legitimate articles, and no business relations existing with officers. No list of prices posted up. No pecuniary transactions discovered between officers and person furnishing supplies for the prison.

Prison and hospital fund properly accounted for by Captain R. C. Rutherford, commissary of subsistence and treasurer of prison fund. Prison fund March 31, 1864, $10,276. 33; prison hospital fund March 31, 1864,

$952,54.

Disbursing and supply department, Captain R. C. Rutherford, commissary of subsistence, reports, March 31, as due the United States, $19,159. 38, accounted for as follows:

J. H. SIGNOR,

Lieutenant and Acting Assistant Quartermaster.

Balance due the United States March 31, $13. 04; due creditors of the United States and remaining unpaid for want of funds, $490. 65.

Lieutenant Signor has purchased stores, consisting of knives, forks, tin cups, lumber, butts ad screws, rope, nails, locks, coal oil, and coffins, without authority, to the amount of $107. 77. The business in this department appears to be carefully transacted; contracts and purchases made at fair rates; quality of stores good, and not in excess of the wants of the post. The garrison consists of the Tenth Kansas Volunteer Infantry. The men are quiet and orderly, but the regiment is deficient in discipline and efficiency. The guards are careless, but the prison is sufficiently strong and secure to assure the comparative safe-keeping of its inmates, though four have escaped this month from within its walls. The health, clothing, and food of the prisoners is entirely satisfactory. But little judgment is exhibited in the constructions of bunks. The discipline of the prison should be improved. The yard and quarters are not properly policed. The cells are in a filthy condition; the hospital, though badly located, is clean and the patients well cared for. Smallpox and erysipelas have nearly disappeared. The garrison can be reduced 25 per cent.

A building leased at $166. 66 per month is used as quarters for the officers on duty with their regiment, the men occupying tents at considerable distance away. I think the officers should remain with their commands in camp.

Number of rebel prisoners, 509; Federal prisoners, 142.

JOHN F. MARSH,

Lieutenant Colonel Twenty-fourth Regiment Veteran Reserve Corps, Inspector.
