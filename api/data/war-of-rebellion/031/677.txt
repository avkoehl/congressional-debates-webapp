I would particularly mention Brigadier-Generals Jones and Paxton, Colonel Warren [Tenth Virginia], commanding Taliaferro's brigade, and Colonel [Edmund] Pendleton [Fifteenth Louisiana], commanding Starke's brigade, whose reports are herewith forwarded, and who make special mention of some of their officers; among them most particularly Lieutenant-Colonel [R. D.] Gardner, Fourth Virginia Infantry, who was severely wounded.

I cannot too highly mention the gallantry of Captain [J. B.] Brockenbrough, chief of artillery, and of Captain Wooding, and Lieutenant [Joseph H.] Jones, Wooding's battery, and Lieutenant [William T.] Lambie, Carpenter's battery, all of whom were severely wounded; and of Captain [William H.] Caskie, Lieutenants McKendree, [Thomas W.] Hunton, Statham, [William] Early, and [William K.] Donald.

It is with great pain I have to add that the division has to deplore the loss of one of its most gallant officers of artillery-Lieutenant [D. R.] Barton-and two gallant officers of the Twenty-first Virginia Regiment-Captain [Thomas S.] Ames and Lieutenant [George W.] Swoope-who fell, nobly discharging their duty.

I take occasion, in conclusion, to acknowledge my obligations to the officers of my staff -Captain W. T. Taliaferro, assistant adjutant-general; Captain [Edwin L.] Moore, inspector-general, and Major T. S. Taliaferro, volunteer aide-de-camp-and to call attention to the excellent arrangements made for the comfort of the wounded by Surgeon [R. T.] Coleman, medical director of division.

I inclose a list of killed and wounded, amounting to 190.*

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WM. B. TALIAFERRO,

Brigadier-General, Commanding Jackson's Division.

Captain A. S. PENDLETON,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
