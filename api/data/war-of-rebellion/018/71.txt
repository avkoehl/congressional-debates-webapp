Brigadier-General ROSECRANS, Winchester:

Blenker's division is reported to be at Salem, near the line of the Manassas Gap road, between Front Royal and Manassas Junction. General Fremont directs that Blenker go to Moorefield. It may be well to go across from Strasburg. The route, however, is left to your discretion. Blenker is said to be disabled by a fall from his horse. You will take command until the division reaches the destination designed by General Fremont.

Secretary of War:

I suggest the prompt repair by the Eighth New York Cavalry, now without horses. Your dispatch received, and shall assume command and direct column accordingly.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Brigadier-General.

WHEELING, VA., April 12, 1862-10 a. m.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

Agreeably to telegram of last night I send an officer to direct the march of Blenker's division. It best suits my plans, and will involve the least expense, that the division march directly to Moorefield. Will you give such directions as may be necessary to further the movement?

J. C. FREMONT.

WAR DEPARTMENT, Washington, April 12, 1862.

Major-General FREMONT, Wheeling, Va.:

Blenker is reported to be at Salem, between Front Royal and Manassas Junction. I have sent General Rosecrans to take command until the division is brought in position for your command. It will probably go from Strasburg across to Moorefield, where you request it to be posted.
