Gem, and to take one section on board the ferry-boat Athern, all under command of General Mason, to whom I was ordered to report. We proceeded up the river, stopping at various points, and arrived at Cincinnati Monday night, June 13, and I reported to Captain Gibson, chief of artillery. On the morning of the 14th was ordered to Camp Dennison to meet Morgan's forces with the section of artillery then under my command, arriving too late to meet the enemy. On the morning of the 15th I was ordered by Lieutenant-Colonel Neff to take my section of battery, with eighty cavalry, command by Captain Shuman, of the Eleventh Ohio Volunteer Cavalry, and proceed in prusuit of Morgan's forces, and as early as possible report to General Hobson, then in pursuit. I overtook General Hobson's column at Batavia; reported and was ordered to join the advancing column in the pursuit. The forces under my commnad, except those who were compelled to fall out of column owing to horses giving out and dying, have continued in the pursuit until the capture of the enemy at Cheshire, on the Ohio River. I was ordered by General Hobson to act as chief of artillery, and other sections of artillery were placed under my command and remained so up to our leaving Cheshire for Cincinnati. During our pursuit each hour was a forced march, both night and day, never halting over three hours to rest and feeding of horses. The day's march was never under thirty-three miles per day, and some days over forty miles, and the last day's march was fifty-one miles. The weather was inteusely hot and the animals suffered much from heat, dust, and want of water. I have to report casualties to animals as follows:

Twenty-first Battery: Horses.

On the evening of the 23rd I was ordered by General Judah to take my command on board the steam-boat Ida May and proceed to Cincinnati. I have now to report following forces awaiting orders: Twenty-first Battery, Captain J. W. Patterson, with Lieutenant Smith and 28 privates, with 1 section of artillery, 1 ammunition wagon, and 1 forage wagon, adn 24 horses. Twenty-third Indiana Battery, Lieutenant John W.
