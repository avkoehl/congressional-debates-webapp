SPEECH OF MR. HALSTEAD,
Of New Jersev.
In the House of Repi esenlalives, September 23,1837—
On, the bill to postpone the fourth instalment of
deposite with the States
Mr. HALSTE 4.D, of New Jersey, addressed the
house as follows
Mr Chairman I regret that I am compelled, at
this late stage of the debate, to trespass upon the
attention of this committee, while I present to their
consideration some of the reasons which have oper-
ated upon mv mind to induce me to withhold my
assent to the passage of the bill upon your table
Sir, I consider the passage of this bill as unneces-
sa>y and inexpedient, and, under these two general
heads, I shall endeavor to comprise the observations
I have to subnvt to this committee
The friereis ot this bill have advocated it as
necessary, upon fh<> alleged ground of a deficiency
in the Treasury to meet the current expenditures
of the government it is incumbent on those
who, in this day of calamity, would take from the
People the sum of $9,367,214 98, to prove that
deficiency be 'ond all doabt I have carefully read
over the report ot the Secretary of the Treasury ,
and it might seem anogince m me to say mat I
understand it, after so many gentlemen in this
house, older and abler than myself confess them-
Sfhes unable to comprehend it, and when the
Chan man of the Committee ot Ways and Means
informs us that to undetstanl Treasury reports is a
science, and that he, after sixteen years1 service in
this house, could not understand it, but that he
went to the Treasury himself, and there, from the
records of the Department, made out his explana-
tory statement of the stale of the finances, which
has been laid on our tables But so far as 1 do un-
deistand the report of the Sedear) , u does not ap-
pear to me that theie is any deficit in th  public
Treasury. The statement and calculations of the
honorable member from Tennessee (Mr Bell) are
entirely satisfactory to my mind to prove that there
is ns deficit But it will, I ihmk, be conceded, aftei
the vano is views and calculations which have been
made by he norable gentlemen who have preceded
me, all differing as to the amount really in the
Treasury, that it is at least doubtful wheiher there
is or is not any deficiency to meet the public expen-
ditures. Then, sir, if a doubt rests upon this sub
ject, that doubt ought to be solved m favor of the
People As guardians of the money of the people,
when we are a«kedto unlock their coffers, and take
out $9,000,000, and place it in the hinds of the
Government, prudence, as well as true democratic
principle, of which we have heard °o much in the
course of this debate, requires thai something more
than a doubtful case should be made out The
advocates of this hill appear to have taken it for
granted tnat if they proved the existence of a de-
ficit in the 1 reasury, they had proved the necessity
of passing the act The conclusion does not follow,
that tbej must go one step further They must not
only prove there is a deficiency in th<° Treasurv,
but they mast prove that there are no othei availa-
ble funds within the powei of the Government, to
which it may resort to supply that deficiency For
if there are other sources from which to supply all
deficieaues to meet the exigencies of the Got em-
inent, without l&jortmg to the fourth instalment re-
quired by law to be deposited with the States then
I cannot vote for this bJl I will, for the sake of
the argument, admit that the excessof expenditures
over both the receipts and die balance in the Trea-
sury at the commencement of the yeai is $5,876 565,
and that §1,000,000 moie wil' be required for the
efficient operations of the Mint, and three or four
milh ns to answer sudden and contingent calls on
the Treasur} , the aggregate sum thus required bj
the Government for all the e objects is $10,000,000,
which the Secietary tells us nust be obtained either
from the deposites or some o h*r sourc The ques-
t.oa then is, cannot the Government make tip this
sum,without vviihholdmsr from theS ates #9,000,000
and upwards, to which they are entitled under the
deposite act? I undertake to show that it c m , and I
would make up this vim from the following sources
First 1< appears that there aie $5,000,000 in
the hands oí disbursing ofhceis of the Govern-
ment    This money is juot as much within the
power of the Government as if it was m the Trea-
sury I see no reason why this large sum should
be left m the hands of disbursing officers, it might
just as well be applied to the purposes of the Gov-
ernment as to be lying idle in the coffers of the of-
ficers or the vaults of a bank, and $3,000,000 of
this sum, at least, may be withdrawn from their
hands without any detriment to the public service
Secondly The Government is in the possesion of
the bonds of the Bank of the United States to the
amount of $8,000,000 The whole of these can be
sold at once, if necessary, and thus the whole defi-
ciency can be supplied But this is not the only
source to which I would resort to supply the defi-
ciency , for, in the third place, I would repeal some
ot the kiwi passed at the last session, mak ng un-
necessary appropriations The Piesident m his
Message, (page 19,) accounts for the fact thit the-
receipts of the cm rent year fall shoi t of the expen-
ditures more than was anticipated, by saving that
" it is to be attributed not on'y to the occurrence of
greater pecuniary embarrassments in the business
of the country than those which were then predict-
ed, and consequently a greater diminution m the
revenue, but also to th  fact that the appropriations
exceeded bv nearly §6 000,000 the amount which
was asked for tn the estimates then submitted " If
the Government did not ask for these appropria-
tions, and do not want them, suiely the money ap-
propriated to these unnecessaiy objects may, with-
out any detriment to the public service, be now di-
verted from Sdch unnecessary objects, and applied
to the more urgent demands of the Government
The items of unnecessary appropriations made at
the last session of Congress, which may b° dispens-
ed with for the ptesent, were fully enumeiated by
the honoiable m-mba fiom Tennessee, (Mr Bell )
Tl ey const ted of appropriations for the construc-
tion of additional Mints and machinen , for public
works in th s ni5, such a~ a pew Patent Office and
Treasury , for ai moues for the armament of forti-
fications, aisenals, canals, equipping the militia,
building vessels o¡f war, light-hous's, dealing out
rivers public roads, custom-houses, and the exploi-
ing expedition The amount appropriated to these
items is $6,376,734 Three or four millions might
be saved to the country, and taken to meet the pie-
sent exigencies of the Tieasury by rppealmg some
of these appropriations The honorable member
from South Carolina (Mr Pickens) chaiactcrrzed
these appropriations as not on'y extravagant, but
man of them fintastic and useless And, mi, in
looking over the " act making appioprntions for
building light houses, hght-boat , beacon-lights,
buoys, and do'plnns," I could hardly withhold my
assent to his remark, for I saivm that act appro-
priations for almost everj van< ty of nime and
object, from "Saddleback ledge" to " Whiieback
light," from "Bhck Boy's reef" to "Papoose
Squaw point" But among other appropnitions,
I found one which I thought verj necessan , and
winch I would bv no means repeal, and that wrs
an appropuatnn of ^,2,700 to build a light-house at
V n Buren harbor I cn'v, regret that this appro-
priation hid not been made soonei The light-
house ought to have been elected previous to the
laat Piesidential election Hid there been a
beacon-light erected at the entrance of that harbor,
the good ship United States might havp avoided the
perilous position she now occupies Sir, there are
shoals and sand bars m that harbor w hich threaten
the sa'etv of that noble vessel and her gallant crew
There aie currents and counter cmicnts, eddies
and undertows, sunken rocks and hidden leefs
which rondel its i avigation difficult, and still more
difficult *o moor a vessel in safety I think it high
time i h'-ron-light was erected at the entrance of
that harbor 1 am for running it up immediately,
and I w ould have it so high that it should enable
the crew of tint gallant ship to see she is dnvmg
fist upon a lee shoie , that there are breakeis
ahead, and that they are surrounded with íoc1 s
and with reefs on the right and on the lelt, thit
they shou'd be enabled t« see that theie is no «a^e
anehoiage in Van Buren hirboi , tint then onlv,
safety umv is to slip their cables, about ship, and
crowd all sad out of ih-t haibor, and not to drop
anchoi agam until they can find a good Clay
bottom.

But, sir, if there is a deficiency m the Treasury,
if (as it is said) theie is not money enough to pay
this instalment then this law is unnecessary The
argument of the honorable member fro-n Virginia
(Mr. Robertson) struck my mmd with great force;
" Why pass a law to postpone the payment of
this fourth instalment, when, if there is no mo-
ney to pay it, it is postponed as a matter of course?"
If the only object of this bill was to postpone the
payment of the fourth instalment, (as the title im-
ports,) the argument of the honorable member
would be absolutely conclusive But, sir, that is
not the object of die bill Its title is deceptive.
Let gentlemen examine the sixth line of this bill,
and see what pregnant meaning lui Its in the follow-
ing wo ds " postponed tilt further provision ¡¡y law.'"
Do noi gentl men perceive that they might as well
vote to take the deposites from the St Ues al once,
as to vote for a bill containing this clause1 When
will fmllier provision by law be made for the dis
tnbution of thtse deposites'? While the present in-
cumbent of the Executive chair is at the head of
the administration ? No, sir Let gentlemen read
the letter of the present Executive to the honorable
Sherrod Williams, (dated 8'h August, 1836,) and
they wi'l there see that he is hostile to the deposité
act His language is this " In my opinion, Con-
gress does not possess the powei, under the consti-
tution, to raise money for distiibution among the
States, and if a distinction can be maintained be-
tween msing money for such puipo--e, and the dis-
tribution of an unexpected surplus, of which I am
not satisfied, I think it ought not to be attempted
witnout a previous amendment of lh" constitution,
defining the authority and regulating its exercise "
The p esent Executive will never sign a bill to
make lurther provision by 1 w foi the distribution
uf i ie dept sues , he wdl apii'y to it the exercise ot
h s veto po,v°i Hon, the n, ci i the rnenIs, of Ihe
deposite act vote for this bill, without aaan lomng
tl e hope of obtaining this fouilh instalment? The
honorable member fiom Tennessee (Mr. Bell) weH
said that the piesent measnie was proposed by
those who were hostile to the deposite act, and
permit me to add, by wiy of caution to the friends
of that act, " Timeo Dañaos et dona fermtes " The
proposeis o" this measure belong to that class of
politicians who are for uniting the purse and the
sword m the same hands The getleman from
Oh'O, (Mr Duncan,) told us money was power
Wo adm nisti tion ever understood th"t maxim bet-
ter than i>e present
Gentlemen deprecate the idea oí mcturino- a na-
tional debt I concur vv till them in that sentiment,
but I do not percei e the force of its application to
the present bill. If this bill passes, we are still to
create a national debt The Secretary of the Trea-
sury tells us (m page 8 of his repoi t) " if the fouith
instalment be deferred, yet, being eh efly in the
custo 1 / of banks not paying specie, it is manifest it
cannot be immed ately realized in funds suitable
to meet existing appropnations," and he therefore
wishes to hive authority to issue Treasury drafis
to the amount of $10,000,000 And the Committee
of Wavs a-d Means concur in the suggestion of the
Secietary, andhaxe introduced a. bill for that ob-
ject If, then, we ire to be subjected to a national
debt, w e mav as \\ ell incm the debt for $20,000 000,
and pa\ the fourth instalment to the States, as to
create a debt of only $10,000,000, and withhold the
fourth instalment The odium of a national debt,
if it be an odium, will exist in both cases
But, su, there is anether objection to this bill,
more form dable, to my mind, than any which I
have -yet urged It is, that the passage of this bill
involve a violation ot natunal faith Foi I re-
gard the deposite act of TÍ36 as containing in it a
proposition to the Sta'es, which proposition, when
accee led to bv the States, by the passage of the ne-
cessary acts for the acceptance and safe-keeping
and re urn o the surplus monej, accoidmg to the
terms aid requisitions of th it act, became binding
upon the United States, and constituted a firm and
valid contract The terms of the ttuiteenth section
of the deposite act, and the acceptance of those
terms b) ihe Legislalure of Isevv Jersey, b} the act
accepting those deposites, corda n al! the essential
elements°of a contiaet Thtse aie, parties able to
contract, a «object matta about which to contract;
