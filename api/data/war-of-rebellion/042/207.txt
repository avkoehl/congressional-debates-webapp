In making the schedule of prices, the commissioners have done the best they could with the lights before them. Notwithstanding their advertisement in all the State papers, calling upon quartermasters, commissaries, and the citizens for information, we have received nothing excepting from officers at this post. Under these circumstances, there are doubtless defects. Our aim has been to do justice to the Government as well as to the holders of all articles necessary for army purposes. The schedule may occasionally work a hardship; so may all general laws or regulations. We would suggest to officers the propriety of making their purchase of any article in that region in which it is most abundant, and at the same time to avoid stripping one section so that prices there will put necessaries out of the reach of the families of the soldiers and of the poor. We still solicit information as to the value and supply of commodities from officers and citizens from all portions of the State.

Address us at Marshall or Rusk.
