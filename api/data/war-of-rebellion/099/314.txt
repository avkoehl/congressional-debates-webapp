CAPTAIN: I have the honor to report that nothing of importance has taken place since my report of yesterday. Fatigue parties continue as before mentioned on Castle Pinckney and other of the enemy's works. It being very clear last evening the enemy's pickets on James Island could be more distinctly seen than usual, and showed almost double their former numbers. Cheering has been heard this morning along the rebel line on James Island. A blockade runner passed in safely last night. The steamer Cosmopolitan arrived this a.m. with the detachment of the Fifty-fourth New York Veteran Volunteers from General Hatch's command.

I have the honor to be, your obedient servant,

Captain W. L. M. BURGER,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

CAPTAIN: I have the honor to report that I to-day effected a crossing of the Salkehatchie at two points. The upper point where the railroad crosses was without opposition. At Combahee Ferry we met with some resistance, but succeeded in forcing the passage without loss on our side. One lieutenant of artillery was captured at the latter point. I shall cross in force at one of these points as soon as the bridges are built so that artillery can be got over. At present I have foot bridges at both points.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. P. HATCH,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
