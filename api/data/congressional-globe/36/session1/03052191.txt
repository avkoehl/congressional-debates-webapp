sin, in favor of the erection of a beacon-light on

Committee on Commerce.
Mr. BROWN presented the petition of Samuel
Byington, John P. Coyle, and others, holders of
property fronting on Missouri avenue, between
Third and Sixth streets, in the city ofWashing-
ton, praying that an appropriation be made to
pave the sidewalk on the south side of that ave-
nue, owned by the Government; which was re-
ferred to the Committee on the District of Co-
lumbia.
Mr. HARL&N. I present the memorial of the
Dubuque and Pacific; Railroad Company, in which
they allege that on the loth of May, 1856, Con-
gress granted certain lands to the State of Iowa,
to aid in the construction of a railroad from the
Mississippi river at Dubuque to Sioux City; that
on the 14thof July, 1856, thoselands were granted
by the Slate to the memorialists; that the tenth and
eleventh sections of that act of the Legislature of
the State of Iowa were intended to protect settlers
on these lands who wire bona fide settlers at the
time of making the grants by Congress; that liti-
gation has arisen between this company and cer-
tain claimants under a company appointed by the
State to improve the navigation of the Des Moines
river, which has been decided by the Supreme
Court in favor of the memorialists; and that they
understand that a bill is now pending which will
divest them of the title to a part of these lands;
and they pray that, as the settlers are fully pro-
tected by the laws of Iowa, the bill alluded to may
not pass. I move that the memorial for the pres-
ent lie on the table, and be printed.
The memorial was laid on the table; and the
motion to print was referred to the Committee on
Printing.
Mr. CHANDLER presented a communication
from Captain F. Martain, of the revenue-cutter
service, m favor of an amendment of" the act to
organize an institution for the insane of the Army
and Navy and of the District of Columbia," to
include the revenue-cutter service; which was re-
ferred to the Committee on Commerce.
Mr. WIGFALL presented the petition of
Charles Taylor, of Victoria county, Texas, pray-
ing compensation for services rendered and sup-
plies furnished to the United States, at Chicago,
Illinois, during the Black Hawk war, in 1832;
which was refrrred to the Committee on Claims.
BILL INTRODUCED.
Mr. HALE asked, and by unanimous consent
obtained, leave to introduce a bill (S. No. 451) to
alter and improve the construction of the Senate
Chamber; which was read twice by its title.
Mr. HALE. As this is a bill relating to the
construction of the Chamber, I do not know of
any appropriate committee, and 1 ask the indul-
gence of the Senate to appoint a select committee
of three, to be appointed by the Chair, to whom
it may be referred. I make that motion.
Mr. CLINGMAN. I supposed that we al-
ready had a Committee on Public Buildings and
Grounds, to whom it might properly go. How-
ever, I shall not oppose the motion, though I am
utterly averse to the proposition. 1 have no idea
that we are likely to improve the Chamber; but,
at the same time, if it be regarded as inappropri-
ate to refer the matter to the Committee on Public
Buildings and Grounds, I shall not resist this
motion.
Mr. HALE. It is from no want of respect to
the committee; but I may as well state the fact
that I referred a resolution to that committee a
year or two ago, and wo never heard from it,and
I have reason to think the committee will not
report upon it. I simply want a report of some
sort.
Mr. CLINGMAN. It docs not seem to me
that it is a sufficient reason for depriving a com-
mittee of the jurisdiction of a proposition that
properly belongs to them, that they have not re-
ported on it heretofore favoiably. I presume if
they had favored it they would have reported it.
I shall not, however, ask the Senate to divide on
the motion, but let it go for what it is worth.
The motion to refer the bill to a select commit-
tee of three was agreed to
Mr. HALE. I move that the committee be
appointed by the Vice President.
The motion was agreed to, by unanimous con-
sent.
