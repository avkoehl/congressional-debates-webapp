THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

And where is it produced ? Not in Penn-
sylvania alone. I see the Representative from
Alabama [Mr. Turner] listening intently to
what I say. I ask him what is the history of
the town of Sheffield or Birmingham in his
State? Why, it is the creation of a Pennsyl-
vania iron master. Two years ago there was
neither hut nor hamlet there, when constit-
uents of my own went there and bought the
iron ore that lay in the earth and the forests
around. Aud now there is a town there, with
a population numbering more than three thou-
sand, and its_ leading stores present fronts of
stone and brick of an elegance unequaled in
any old southern town or city. Its people are
prosperous, and Alabama will this year stand
fairly among the great iron producing States
of the Union.
Gentlemen from Virginia, what can you say
on the subject? What is the most earnest
wish of your hearts and of your constituents ?
Is it not that your coal beds may be worked, and
that the furnace, the forge, the rolling mill, and
the locomotive factory shall bring from England
and the eastern States a prosperous and intel-
ligent people, to consume at the door of your
farmers the products which they cannot now
get to market, near as they are to the seaboard ?
You cannot, I assure you, tempt them by clos-
ingthe now busy and prosperous ship yards and
machine works of the country.
And gentlemen from Tennessee, especially
you who represent the Knoxville and Chatta-
nooga districtsâ€”but why go over the States?
Four gentlemen from North Carolina have
since the holidays been with me to know with
whom they might communicate in Pennsylva-
nia with a reasonable hope of quickening into
vitality the resources buried and still dormant
in the hills of that State. And how is this to
be done? Is it to be accomplished by send-
ing abroad for ships to carry your coal to mar-
ket? Is it to be done by sending abroad not
only for the material with which to construct
your railroads, your locomotives, your houses,
but for the ships themselves, even the steamers
to navigate the rivers of your States, for this
is within the scope of the amendment offered
by the gentlemen from New York, [Mr. Cox?]
Yes, gentlemen, this is the feast to which the
gentleman and other free-traders of the coun-
try invite you. This, Representatives of the
Mississippi and Missouri valley, is the feast to
which you are invited by these cosmopolitan
theorists, and which you and your constituents
are asked to enjoy, while you see the crops of
last year rot in your fields, and in your despair
are without faith to induce you to plant one
for the coming season.
Again I affirm whereof I know, for I have
been through those valleys and seen the rich
abundance of agricultural products accompa-
nied by want of the lnxuriesand refinement and
ease of life which are obtained by free local
commercial exchanges. I have now answered
as I could impromptu the suggestions of my
friend, the gentleman from New York.
Mr. BECK, of Kentucky. Will the gentle-
man yield now to a motion to adjourn ? He
will have the floor in the morning.
Mr. KELLEY. I think I have about ex-
hausted my hour. At any rate, I think I have
answered my antagonist, aud that is all I cared
to do. I do not want any more time on this
subject now.
Mr. BECK, of Kentucky. I move that the
House now adjourn.
Fending the motion to adjourn,
BANKING AND CtJKRBNCY.
Mr. RANDALL, by unanimous consent,

The .SPEAKER. The Senate has sent to
the IUhu.u a concurrent resolution in relation
to printing the addresses delivered on the occa-
sion of the death of the late Senator Garrett
Davis, of Kentucky. If no objection is made, it
will be referred to the Committee on Printing.
No objection was made, and the resolution
was referred accordingly.
FOX AND WISCONSIN RIVERS.
The SPEAKER, by unanimous consent,
laid before the Honse a letter from the Secre-
tary of War, in answer to a resolution of the
House of December, 1872, in relation to the
Pox and Wisconsin rivers improvement; which
was referred to the Committee on Commerce,
and ordered to be printed.
SWAMP LANDS IN POTOMAC RIVER.
The SPEAKER, by unanimous consent,
also laid before the House a letter from the
Attorney General of the United States, in
answer to a resolution of the House, in rela-
tion to swamp lands in the Potomac river, and
eastern branch thereof, from Little falls to
Benning's bridge ; which was referred to the

Resolved, That the Secretary of War be requested
to transmit to this House a copy of the report of the
board of engineers recently convened to make an
examination of the harbor of Toledo.
CATTARAUGUS AND ALLEGHANY INDIANS.
Mr. SHANKS. I am directed by the Com-
mittee on Indian Affairs to report back the
Senate amendments to the bill (H. R. No. 2264)
to authorize the Cattaraugus and Alleghany
Indians in New York to lease lands and con-
firm leases. On behalfofthe committee, I ask
that the amendments be non-concurred in and
a committee of conference appointed.
The SPEAKER. If there be no objection,
that order will be made.
There was no objection, and it was ordered
accordingly.
JUDGE S. H. DURM.L.
Mr. WILSON, of Indiana. I am directed
by the Committee on the Judiciary to ask the
adoption of the following resolution:
Resolved, That in addition to the inquiries here-
tofore directed by the House to be made into the
official conduct of Judge E.H. Durell, the Judiciary
Committee be instruoted further to inquire whether
said Durell should be impeached for high crimes
and misdemeanors in office, and that said committee
have leave to report at any time.
The reason for introducing this resolution
is that there is some uncertainty in the phrase-
ology of the resolution under which the com-
mittee is now acting.
Mr. CONGER. I think it would be better
to have the facts reported to the House before
we order proceedings for impeachment.
Mr. WILSON, of Indiana. That is just
what tve propose.
Mr. CONGER. Does not this resolution
instruct the committee to bring in articles of
impeachment?
Mr. WILSON, of Indiana. No sir ; simply
to make an inquiry.
There being no objection, the resolution was
adopted.
The question being taken on the motion of
Mr. Beck, of Kentucky, that the House now
adjourn, it was agreed to ; and accordingly
(at four o'clock and fifty-five minutes p. m.)
the House adjourned.
