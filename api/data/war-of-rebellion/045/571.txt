WASHINGTON, D. C., July 6, 1863.

Major-General SCHENCK, Baltimore, Md.:

Major-General SCHENCK, Baltimore, Md.:

The troops ordered to Frederick will move directly forward in the cars to Harper's Ferry, unless otherwise ordered by General French. Telegraph how many you send and when they leave. The portion of the Eighty-seventh Pennsylvania has been sent forward to General French. Send him the fragment that you have with you. Push forward the troops with all possible dispatch.

They will expect, on arrival at the Monocacy, to meet your instructions there, whether they are to stop or to remain in the cars and push on immediately to Harper's Ferry.
