TALLADEGA, Sunday, April 16, 1865.

Lieutenant-Colonel SURGET,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

COLONEL: I forward Brigadier-General Adam's courier, with horse, by railroad, to Montevallo, and direct him to go from there to Marion Junction and take railroad to Meridian. This railroad is in running order from Blue Mountain to Montevallo, and can be put in order for trains to run to Selma, if proper energy is given, in ten days or two weeks. This I believe from information received. If you desire, it I will look to its speedy completion, impress, if necessary, hand, &amp;c., for the use of the road, &c. If you desire this, send me an order to that effect. We have a line of courier from Oxford, twenty miles above this place on railroad, to Newnan, Ga. Can send dispatches or any matter through for you. Newnan on railroad between West Point and Atlanta. No enemy here on near here. Enemy have been reported at Wetumpka, fifteen miles from Montgomery, but not reliable. I will keep you advised of any movement on this place. We have one engine and cars on this end of the road. The cavalry are very much demoralized and straggling through the country. The arly completion of this road is very important, as all the posts, &c., will and must be abandoned for want of forage and subsistence, and there will be great suffering here among the poor families, as all the corn has been brought from the canebrake lands beyond Selma. The iron-works in and around Montevallo have been burned, but I learn can be put in order very soon, the machinery being damaged but little.

I am, colonel, very respectfully,

T. A. MELLON,

Colonel, Commanding Post.
