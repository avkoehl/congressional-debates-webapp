It has been reported to me, and I credit it, that about 250 rebels have been breaking ground directly across from Liverpool Point to-day. The river is 3 1\2 miles across at that point, and if for the purpose of establishing a battery, it can do no harm. If they cannot strike vessels distant I mile, they are not to be apprehended at more than three times that distance. It is estimated that about 250 men are at work there.

As Captain Wyman did not call on me on his return, as was expected by the Major-General Commanding in his letter of the 17th instant, and not knowing but that there might be something remaining which that officer had not communicated to me, I visited him this p. m. This was my earliest opportunity of doing so.

I learned nothing of the subject of our meeting which had not already answered by my letter to Brigadier S. Williams on the same day.

My observations from the balloon satisfy me that the batteries in my
