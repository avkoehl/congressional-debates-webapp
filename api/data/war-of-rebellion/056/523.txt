HEADQUARTERS SIXTEENTH ARMY CORPS,Memphis, Tennessee, December 28, 1863.

Major General W. T. SHERMAN,

Comdg. Department of the Tennessee, via Nashville:

Forrest, driven from Jackson, eluded Grierson's cavalry and crossed the railroad at La Grange last night. This was owing to neglect of orders in not destroying bridge over Wolf in rear of La Fayette. He had been repulsed between Somerville and Middleburg. Telegraph and railroad east of Collierville are cut; damage not known.

Grierson was at La Grange at last accounts, and I suppose is pursuing. Smith not yet heard from.
