BRISTOL, December 5, 1863.

President DAVIS,

Richmond, Va.:

I have just returned from an ineffectual effort to reach General Ransom at Bean's Station. I am credibly informed he left there Thursday morning for Knoxville, where I could not follow for want of proper horses. Your telegram did not reach me. Please repeat. No news from Longstreet later than 2nd December.

DALTON, December 7, 1863.

President DAVIS:

The army, about 30,000, exclusive of cavalry, is about this place. Infantry advance at Tunnel Hill. The cavalry at ringgold. Slight skirmishing with enemy's cavalry at that point to-day, but no advance is expected. Condition of troops improved, though considerable despondency and disorder yet exist. Total loss in late battle about 7,000, and mostly prisoners and stragglers; very few killed and wounded. General Hardee's information leads us to believe that Grant is not preparing to occupy missionary Ridge and that he is withdrawing from Chattanooga, intending to keep his main army during the winter on the opposite side of the river, but in supporting distance of the town. Should Grant move forward, the general intends to try and crush his advancing divisions by detail, and is prepared to meet any cavalry raid which may be made to Rome or elsewhere. But I think he is of opinion that there will be no further operations; that Grant will not move and cannot be attacked in his position. It is thought that 15,000 or 20,000 have been sent to the relief of Burnside. General Ledbetter reports that the attack made on Knoxville on the 30th was very feeble. He expected Longstreet to retreat. General Hardee desires immediate instructions respecting the two brigades recalled by General Johnston, and which General H[ardee] has asked the Department to allow him to retain. Should think it would be well, at least till events develp themselves, to grant his request. The commander of the Second Corps alluded to in Bragg's dispatch was General Breckinridge. Bragg ordered Hindman and Cleburne to change positions. This puts Hindman in command of Breckinridge's corps.

DUBLIN, December 8, 1863.

President JEFFERSON DAVIS,

Richmond, Va.:

General Ransom was at Bean's Station on the 6th and telegraphed on the 7th that Longstreet was at Rutledge. General Jones reached here last night from Salt Sulphur. All quiet in northwest. I will reach Richmond Thursday morning.

W. P. JOHNSTON.
