TairelEt D to pr nt the reports—
Mr MASON of Ohio, oojectedto the publication
of the repot of the majouty, because it was par-
tial, presented a one-sided view of the subject, and,
instead of summ ng up the evidence, m a fair and
impartial manner, between the parties, had aggra-
vated the guilt of one side and mitigated that of the
other Mi M w.is proceeding to discuss the merits
of the report, when he was arrested by the Chair
as not being in order
Mr M remarked that, as the "Globe" of this
morning stated they had been twenty days discus-
sing a subject without gomg in'oits merits, he hoped
he might have been permitted now to touch upon the
merits a little      He did not desire to travel out of
the report itself, but upon the face of that document
to show that it d d manifest injustice to some  of
the parties    Mr M cited that' part of it setting
forth that  the proposition to shoi ten the distance
w as an aggravat jn,   whereas the parties were
fighting at a distance ol twelve jards farther than
was originally agreed upon by Mr Cilcet himself,
and there was no evidence to show that the dis-
tance was proposed to be shortened less than the
original eightj  yards    Moreover, in speaking of
Mr Cillfy, the report dealt throughout in superla-
tives, by speal mp of his high character, noble
bearing, and fire f'elmg, whereas nothing of that
kind was said of the othsis
He p'so objected to  the printing, in the convic-
|   tarn that it would  produce  no good,  produce no
moral result and in no way be calculated to effect
j    that end which should have been the sole object of
I   the committee    It w as more like an electioneering
.   document than any thirg else, endeavoring to prove
one partv flagrantly guilty, and the other purely
innocent     Upon a further ground he also objected
13 th  printing that a large edition had already
been privately printed and circulated from one end
of the country to  the other, and there was thence
|l p less necessity for printing another large edition
oi the same document
I       At this stage, the hour foi morning business hav-
i   ing expired—
Mr  CAMBUDLDNG called for the orders of
I   the dat,
Mr WHITTLESEY of Ohio, suggested to the
gentleman to waive the motion lor a time to give
I   the committees an opportunity of leportmg
'       Mr CVMBRELENG a-senied, with the under-
I   sending that as soon as this business was gone
through, his motion would be agreed to
