The steamer Harriet De Ford was captured by rebels last night at Fair Haven, about thirty miles below Annapolis, and Commodore Dornin reports that another steamer was captured in the Patuxent at the same time. The Navy have no steamers here to send in pursuit. Have telegraphed to Fortress Monroe, as it is reported that the two steamers went down the bay. If the Navy Department is informed perhaps Commander Parker can overtake them.
