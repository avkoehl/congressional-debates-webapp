the attention of the general commanding to the fact that passes in and out of the posts of Sedalia, Springfield, and Kansas City, signed by commanders of the posts, and also permits to carry arms, were found on the bodies of a number of the rebels killed in the fight; and from them and other papers, there is no doubt but that a portion of Quantrill's force was made up of persons belonging to the Missouri militia.

I desire to take special notice of the bravery and coolness of Lieutenant James B. Pond, Company C, Third Wisconsin Cavalry, commanding the camp; Sergeant McKenzie, of Company C, Third Wisconsin Cavalry, and the first sergeant, R. W. Smith, of said company.

The number of the killed is as follows:

Major H. Z. Curtis, Lieutenant A. W. Farr, Lieutenant [Ralph E.] Cook........................................................... 3

Members of brigade band....................................... 14

Clerks and orderlies........................................... 6

Company A, Fourteenth Kansas................................... 18

Company I, Third Wisconsin..................................... 23

Company C, Third Wisconsin (in camp)........................... 6

Citizens....................................................... 10

80

Wounded........................................................ 18

Total.......................................................... 98

The loss of the enemy, as far as known, is between 20 and 30.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

In doing this, 4 of my men were shot down. I was in my tent about 200 yards west of the camp when I heard the first firing.
