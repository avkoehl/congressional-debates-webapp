ADJUTANT-GENERAL U. S. Army, Washington, D. C.

SIR: I have the honor to inform you that Bvt. Lieutenant Colonel J. V. Bomford has been sent for* and will when he arrives be released in exchange for myself. As I had anticipated the Confederate Government will not for a moment entertain the idea of giving up Colonel Willcox under existing circumstances. I am now under parole to report myself at Fortress Monroe by the 15th of February. Please send me authority to remain here until Colonel Bomford arrives, it being of course understood I am not to bear arms until his release.

Very respectfully,

JNO PEGRAM,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Provisional Army, C. S.

LOUISVILLE, KY., January 27, 1862.

Honorable E. M. STANTON.

SIR: I take the liberty of addressing you hoping you will answer me candidly, honestly, even if for the worst. My husband, Colonel W. E. Woodruff, is held as a hostage for the privateers. Are they to be exchanged or not? I have had assurances time and again that he would be at home in four or five weeks but he comes not. Suspense is but a living death. Oh, sir, for the sake of humanity return him; he will do honor to his country and its flag.

Respectfully,

F. M. WOODRUFF.
