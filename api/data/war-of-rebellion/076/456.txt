NEAR ATLANTA, GA., August 11, 1864-8 a.m.

(Received 1 p.m.)

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

Glorious news of Mobile just received. I have the same news, embracing the capture of Mobile City, through deserters. Now, if General Canby can follow it up by the capture of the Alabama River, my position would be much improved. All well here. I am knocking Atlanta with 4 1/2-inch rifle-shells.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, near Atlanta, August 11, 1864.

General THOMAS:

General Howard reports that General Corse advanced his skirmish line this morning, taking a certain hill which I have wanted for a week. He took some prisoners, dismounted cavalry, of Ferguson's brigade. Prisoners say our folks have the city of Mobile.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.

(Same to General Schofield).
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, near Atlanta, August 11, 1864.

General THOMAS:

General Corse this morning fought for a hill which to my eye is 300 yards nearer the heart of Atlanta than General Geary's battery. The hill is next to General Williams' right, where I ordered one of the 4 1/2-inch guns yesterday. General Barry tells me that General Brannan instead of sending that gun to General Williams' right sent it to the same point the other three were. You will please have General Brannan report what this means; why my orders were not obeyed; why when ordered to place that gun on General Williams' right he sent it in an opposite direction.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
