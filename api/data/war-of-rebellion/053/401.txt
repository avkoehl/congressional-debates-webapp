In the name of Christianity and humanity! in the name of God and liberty! for the sake of their wives and children and everything they hold sacred and dear on earth! the loyal people of Tennessee appeal to you and implore you not to abandon them again to the merciless dominion of the rebels by a withdraw of the U. S. forces from upper East Tennessee.
