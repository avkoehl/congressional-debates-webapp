14, 1863 he recommends in strong terms Colonel Morgan's promotion. General Warren also specially recommended him last fall. Major-General Couch, formerly in command of the Second Corps, has also recommended his promotion. I have recommended him many times, not only in my official reports, but on special occasions. All his recommendations are unsought, and the result of his valuable service in the field. Though now a staff officers, he has commanded troops, having been commandant of artillery of the Second Corps for more than a year. The immediate occasion of this letter is that General Morgan cannot take command on his brevet rank, as he would then be obliged to give up his appointment as assistant inspector-general, and would draw pay as captain only. I trust that before the expiration of the present Congress General Morgan may receive his appointment, so that he can get command of troops in the spring campaign.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

The following is received from Green Spring Run Station:

Information has been received that General Payne's brigade arrived at Moorefield last Friday. Imboden's command is encamped at Pendleton, Rosser's men at Moorefield. This information comes through Mr. C. Taylor, who came to my pickets to tell me. He gets his information from one of Rosser's scouts, who is a relation of his. The scout says they are making preparations to make a raid on the road.
