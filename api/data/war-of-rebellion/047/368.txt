General S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General, Richmond, Va.:

Nothing to report since last dispatch. Wise's brigade has arrived. Enemy still working industriously on Morris Island batteries, without returning our fire. If I had two or three long-range Parrott or Whitworth guns, small caliber, I could much annoy his fleet in Light-House, 2 1/2 or 3 miles from James Island. Weather still windy.
