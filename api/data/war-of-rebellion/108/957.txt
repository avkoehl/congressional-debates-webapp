NEAR CHESTER, May 24, 1864.

General B. BRAGG,

Richmond:

The Third Virginia and the Sixth North Carolina have already been ordered to their respective brigades. There are only four companies of the First Battalion North Carolina in the department. They are at Wilmington on heavy artillery duty. It is not reported as forming a part of Hoke's old brigade. Should it join the brigade?

G. T. BEAUREGARD.

SAMARIA CHURCH, May 24, 1864--5.30 a. m.

General B. BRAGG:

GENERAL: I have reached this point and will push ahead to Kennon's on river. Reports from three different scouts report Sheridan's cavalry corps to have crossed Pamunkey near White House, going up through King William to Grant. I think it would be as well to order Lomax, commanding the remainder of my troops at Atlee's, and all available cavalry at once up to General Lee, as a counteracting force. I can supply their places as I come back.

Most respectfully,

FITZ. LEE,

Major-General.
