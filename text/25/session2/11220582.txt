i ice ílimew h he i-ecomippiil ti n of ive Prp^idert and
the Sk jetar/oi she 1 ita¡ ury( Congress parsed the act of the
12th of October, lb37, authorizing die emission of ten millions
of Trea ury notes     The measure   was adopted with great
reluctauce by m«my, as they assented at the mne, and naanv
were the prote&tauons, fubhcly *nÓ pnvately, then, and such
has been the case at the present session, that never would they
again sanction another emission oíTreasmy notes Theexcuse
lor resorting to this unusual mode oí lepiertishmg the TVeaeury
at that iinu was, that there existed a great pressure in. the tiaáe
andcommetceof the country, produced by what was called
tevulsion in trade and the suspension of specie pavments by
the banks That this state of things would be of short dona-
tion, as the causes were tempoiary which produced if, bo &
temporaiy relief to the Tie sury, by authorizing the issu.ug of
ua millions o! dolíais of Treasury note*, would veheve it of
a 1 émbaní sment, and thereafter the Government would re*
sort to the usual mode of laising money to supply the wants of
the Treasury But, sir, it seems that this method of raising *hs
supplies i£ to be the settled policy of the Admimstrau n, that a
lrea=«uiy baik n fact, whatever it may bt m name, is tobe
established You doubtless íememher that the bill, as reported
by the Committee of Ways ajid Means, at the last session of
Congress contal ed no limitation as >.o the time in which the
notes should be issued, nor did it contain any provis on for can
celling them after they should be returned to the Treasury.
The ptoviso to the 12th section, which provides for this object,
was adopted by th^ House on the motion of the honorable gen-
tleman irom Kentucky, [Mr Southgate j But for this pro-
vigo, the notes might, and no doubt would, havebeen reissued,
10 that instead of furnishing the Government with supplies to
the amount ot ten millions, a grant, m effect, would have been
made of thnty or iotty millions, the amount depending, alone,
011 the discretion of the Secrptaryofthe Treasury Had the bill
passed without the proviso, does any man believe we should be
called on it (hits time for an additional ten millions? Ij (or one,
do not TheTieasuiy would, in that event, have been as mde-
Dendent ol Congress as it desires to be of he people
Well, sir, the bill on yotu table provides for issuing ten mil
lions of Treasury notes, m pursuance of the act of the I2th ©f
October, 1837, hut it does not provide th-\t, when leceived m
payment by the Treasury, they shall be cancelled, in pursu
anee t f the provision of that act On the contrary, it it> avowed
that it ib intended they shall be reissued, if, m the opinion of
the Treasury Department, it shall be necessary so todo In
deed, the Prest tent, in his recent message on this subject, says
' 1 he principal difficulty an&es from apiohibmon \n the pre
sen law to reissue such Treasury notes as might be paid in be-
fore they fal1 due, and may beeffecuially obviated by giving the
Tieasury duringihe whoieyear the benefit of the full amount
originally authorized  the remedy would *eem to be obvious

And the Secretary in hi** communication accompanying that
message rei crates substantially ihe same thing Here, then,

M r Chin man, the people of th *? country are not yet prepared
for tins addifonal experiment    They have not forgot en that
in the eiily history 01 our country, when we were engaged m the
doubtful but glorious <*nuggle loi liberty and independence,
wall a gall ut md piwcrlul nation, the Congress  of that day
w i«.compelled to icon  ¡o continental mosey to supply the
want  of an exhausted Trea"ury    E\ en then it was done with
reluctance     What excuse can iow be given to the people for
1 etorting to the «ame means for the same purpose!    I am not to
be told that, inasmuch as weaie now a more numerous and
powerful people,  possessed of boundless resources,  vigor
out and  en'erprising, at  peace   with   the whole  world,  and
the Government of „ atpeuod was engaged in war, the peo-
1 le few m  number, and  their  limited íesources dned up
by the   MCi>situdt-s   incident   to   that state of things, it   is,
therefore, pi oper now, as it was indispensable then    This an
swer, sir, will not satunv the country   The people will see that
now, as then, the Government has resorted to a paper cur-
lency, founded on no capital other than its credit, and the re-
centdiscoveiy, promulgated ¡or the first time m another part of
this Capitol, that a paper currency, founded on the cisdit and
resources of ihe Government was superior to thai, supported by
actual capital, and convertible into specie at any time at the
P'easme of the holder, has not, so far as I know   met with a
íavoiabieiespípsefiom any quarter    It is a financial heresy,
whose author, for the sake of being thought «.rigtnai, has m this
lespect rendered himee fr dtculons    The histoty ol the coun-
try furnishes no example of a resort to Trea&ury notes for the
purposes of the Government, except in times of war, and then
only when all other means ofsupplying theTreasury had failed
But now, m a period of profound peace, with all the elements
of ptospenty scattered around us in i-ch profusion, this system
s attempts I to be f 3 ened on toe countiy, not as a temporary
