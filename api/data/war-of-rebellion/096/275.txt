Richmond Whig of the 27th contains the following:

Brigadier General J. A. RAWLINS,

Chief of Staff, City Point, Va.:

GENERAL: I have the honor to report that no essential change in the condition of affairs here has taken place since my last report. Hoke is still in our front, remaining quietly behind his intrenchemnets. Fort Fisher is being put into a defensible condition under the direction of Brevet Brigadier-General Comstock. The line toward Wilmington has been made much stronger, and additional guns from among those captured in the fort have been placed upon it. I have sent two regiments to occupy Smithville and Fort Caswell, relieving the seamen and marines placed thee by the navy. The enemy are busily working on Fort Anderson, and from the number of camp-fires seen I think that they have some force there. I am inclined to think, however, that it is a part of Hoke's division, especially as deserters inform me that the remnant of Hagood's brigade is there.

I have the honor to be, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

ALFRED H. TERRY,

Major-General.
