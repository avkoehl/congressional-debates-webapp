[January 25,
3onds of United States Bank—Mr. Wright.
Senate.
25th Cong....3d Skss.
appended to the report of the Secretary of the
Treasury, ona from the cashier of the Dank, in
the following words
Baix of the Unite  States, August ], 1838
I hereby certify that Chirles Macalester, Esq , ha  this
day deposited to the credit of the Treasurer of the United
States, insvccial deposit, the sum of two million two hun
dred and fitly four thnusaud eignthimdred and seventy one
dollars ¿nd thnty eight cents, sub|ect to the drafts of the
said Treasiiier.                     J CQWPEltTHWAIf,
Cashier
Now this paper is either true or false. If true,
then the payment was made according to the
terms of the agreement for the sale of the bond,
was made in " money m hand," which money
was, by the very act of payment, disposed of as
the second section of the act referred to requited
Does any one doubt the truth of the ceitifieate '
Does the gentleman himself doubt that this amount
of money was in the bank, as its property, and
subject to its disposition, at the time the certifi-
cate was given' Bad, Mr President as is the
authority of this bank and its officers, with me,
upon most subjects, I do not believe that one of
them would issue a false official and responsible
paper of this charactei, nor do I believe that the
cashier was ignoiant of the natuie of a " special
deposit," or of the import of the facts to which
he certified Any collateral undcistind ng, ex
isting at the time, as to the mannei in which the
Treasurer should dispose of this money, 01 in
which the bulk might, by making ceitain othei
payments, discharge itself fiom us liability thus
mcuried foi this deposit, could neither destioy
the fact of the payment, nor alter the chai ictcr
of the deposit at tht lime whin ti  i eitihcatc
was given But suppose, sn, that this cci tificate
was f ih>e at the time it was given Then the
whole transaction was, void,fiom the fiaud puie-
ticed upon the Secietary, and the legal propi íty
in the bond did not pass to the bank by the
delivery, as that delivery was in considciation
of the certificate, and it was the only evidence
of the value received Upon this supposition,
thorefoie, the bond was not sold, and that could
not be an illegal sale, which was not a sale at all
The honoiablo Senator next takes the position
that the ttansaction was a disadvantageous one to
the Government, because that, out of the pioooeds
f the bond deposited, as we hwi seen, the bink
■vas to answerdrafts of tin JTiiasuui for the use
of the Wat Depaitment to the amount of but
$500,000 monthly, while the statemt nts fiom that
Depaitment show that its wants weie equ il to
$1,000,000 pei month
1 his position is susceptible of seveialansuois
Fust, the bank would agite to no moie ftvoiable
nriiuigemeut, and the Secretaiy of the Ticasuiy
must const lit to withdraw the deposit it tht rate
¡of $500,000 monthly, or ho must foiogo the sale
of the bond altogothi i, and thus got nothing fiom
this bond in aid of theTif asury,as no otlu l pm-
chaser could be found who would pay the puce
fixed by the law Seiond, the gentleman has
ovcilooked tht fact that payments weie making,
at the same time, upon tht bond of 183^, at the
late of §800,000 per month, so that, from both
soui ees, the bank would moiothan mictvvhathe
says were the necessities of the War Dtputment
Thnd, the piocteds of these bonds wete not all
the means of the Treasmy The whole cuirent
levenut remained, besidts other defined debts,
and what the Wai Department should requne,
which the bank was not to pay, it would be the
duty of the Secretary of the lieasury to supply
from these other souiccs
Another ground assumed by the honoiable
gentleman is, that the bonds might have been,
and should have been, sold abroad, and that a
special agent should hate been sent abioid to
negotiate the sale, and then he ínfeio that the
S cietaiyoftht Treasury was not diiven to m ike
tht sale to the bank, had hepmsued propeily the
toui se which the law pointed out
I have befoie shown, geneially, what the Sec-
retai y did do, by way of effecting a sale of these
bonds abioad, and, from the results of those ef
f ins, had he any encouiagement to pursue them
faitnei This is the fair question, when we ate
di c i«s ng the f nth and intentions of the offcei
Xn \I i) , | ending the p issage of the law, and al-
most immediately upon its mtioditciion before
Congic^s, the Secretary wrote to a banker of high
standing in each of the cities of Philadelphia and
New York, to inquire as to the prospect of a sale
of the bonds, at home or abroad, within the terms
proposed to be piescribed They both answer
him, substantially, that, upon the teims of the
bill and without a gurantee, no sale could proba-
bly be effected in this country, unless to the bank
itself Mr Solms, the President of the Mova-
mensmg bank of Philadelphia, gave it as his opin-
ion that a favoiable sah of the bonds might be
made in England, and seems to rest that opinion
upon the then state of the English money mar-
ket, and the fact that the agent of the bank in
London wouid, he thought, be induced, "by
weighty considerations," to become apuichaser
This is the only duect opinion favorable to the
sale of those bonds abroad, which I have found
among the papers, and this seems to have been
formed at least as much upon the expectation that
the bank itself would be the purchaser as upon
any other consideration This gentleman did not
propose to free the Secretary from a sale to the
bank by sending him to London for a market
Mr Newbold, the President of the Bank of
Amenca, New Yoik, says
" J lie bonds have too short i time to run to warrant any
reasonable expectation of a ale of them m turope on favor
able terms during the present rate of exchange "
After the passage of the law, the Secietary im
mediately wrote to the house of N M de Fsoths-
child & Sons, bankers of London, and requested
them, if possible, within the íestuctions of the
law, to make salt of the bonds They declined
to puichase, for the íeasons which I have btfoie
stated, and say that a sale upon the terms pre-
scribed, cannot be effected in London I cannot
sptak fiom ptisonal acquaintance as to the pro-
pi íety of the Secietary's selection of his English
' correspondents for this object, but I understand
the bouse to be among the first banking houses in
London, and suppose it will be conceded by all
that there is no fault in the course of the Secre-
tary in this íespect
He also wrote, without delay, to our Minister
at Pans, and requested him to consult the best
bankeis in Fiance, and effect a sale of the bonds
thiie, if it could be done within the limits of his
authouty As the gentleman his commented
upon the unsatisfactoiy chaiactct of the leply
fiom this qu utor, I will lead a pait of C-overnoi

Could the Secietary, aftei such an opinion,
coming from such a souice, and based upon such
authority, ¡ongei hope to find in Fi inte a maiket
foi these bonds, within tnc limitations of the liw '
, Can his motives be suspected, because lie íelied
and acted upon su h evidence'
Tht Secretary fuither, immediately aftei the
passage of Uip law, opened a conespondence
with a Mi Belmont of New York, an agent, ics-
ulent theie, of extensive banking houses in Lon
don and Pans This coirespondence was con-
tinued fiom the 9th to the 21st of July, and
resulted in an entire declination to purchase the
bonds within the íestrictions of the law, either
i foi h'mself, or for account of his principals in
I Euiope
I     But, says the honorable Senator, the Secretary
ought to have sent an agent to Euiope to nego
I tiate a sale of the bonds, and not to have depend-
1 ed upon  the uncertainty of conespondence     I
have shown that an effort was made by the Sec
j retary to employ an agent, soon after the passage
of the law, but that the peison applied to, con
ceded by the gentleman to be qualified and com-
petent, declined to accept the compensation offtied
by the Sccictaiy—eight dollars per day ard ne
cessaiy expenses—and demt nded a commission
of one fouith of one uer cent upon the amount
of the bonds, if a sale was effected, and the pay
and mileage of a member of Congiess if he should
I fail m the mission    1 have made upon my table
a hasty casting of the amount of this commis-
sion demanded by the agent, and, if I am not mis-
taken, it is, upon both bonds, a trifling fraction
below §10,000 This expense the Secietaiy did
not feel willing to incur m any event, while tne
prospect of a sale did not seem to him to author-
ize the pay and mileage of a member of Con-
gress for ajourney fiom this countiyto England
and France, and the return, simply to make the
experiment Hedid not, therefore,send theagent
In this he may have erred, for it is not my pur-
pose to prove that the Secretary is perfect, or
exempt from error This point I cheerfully leave
to the decision of this body and the public My
only anxiety is, that the whole truth sh ill appear
before the decision is pronounced that it shall be
distinctly known that the bond was sold at the
par value, as fixed in the law, and that every
dollar of the proceeds has paid a dollar of debt
against the public Treasury, without any deduc-
tion of§10,000, or any other sum, for the expenses
of negotiating that sale If, then, the conclusion
shall be that the Secretary has brought the Gov-
ernment into improper connection with a hostile
bank, by the negotiation, it must be admitted that
he has saved this $10,000 to the Treasury of his
country by the opeiotion
The Senator next says, there is no evidence of
the necessity of the sale of this bond at all, and
indicates an opinion that it is the duty of the Sec-
retary, and of those who are willing to apologize
for his acts, to show that necessity befoie they
attempt to justify the sale he made TotheSen-
atoi 's arguments upon this position I have several
answers
First, the Secretary has himself stated that the
calls upon the Tieasuiy for the month of June
" had exceededfour and a half millions," that he
anticipated, " as the fact turned out to be," that
those calls would equal about seven millions for
the two following months of July and August;
" that the available balance in the Treasury, ap-
plicable to general purposes, and subject to draft,
fell below one million, that payments were mak-
ing, at times, in new Treasury notes, which
could not be lendered at all available," and that,
j theiefore, he considered it <( neeessaiy to effect a
sale of at Uast one oj the bonds, at an earlier day
than advices could be received and any proceeds
realized fiom Euiope" This is a state of the
Tieasury, and the exhibition of its necessities,
fiom the head of that Department, and I, sir,
have been accustomed to place confidence in state-
ments upon that point, from that authority
Second, the law authorizing the Secrttaiyto
issue Tieasuiy notes for the supply of the Tieas-
uiy, expicssly limits that powei to its necessities,
aftei all the othei lawful means of supply have
been exhausted Hence the sale of the bonds
became a duty, before the credit of the Govern
ment, in the shape of these notes, was lesoited
to, while the only powei existing to issue notes,
at the petiod of these tiansactions, was the power
to issue new notes, under the law of 1838, m the
pi ice of those paid m and canceled undei the law
, of 1837, and it was, in the nature of things, im-
possible foi human foiesight to say how lapidly
the old notes would come in, and, consequently,
what might be the extent of the powei, within
any given period, to issue new notes
Third The apparent balances of money on
deposit in bank, to the ciedit of the Tieasurti,
afford no standard by which to form a judgment
as to the amount of available means of the lieas-
ury on any given day, because those balances
were constantly made the basis of drafts by tht
Treasurer, which, the Secretary tells us in the
conespondence, would necessarily be out fiom
thnty to ninety days, before they would come
round to the bank to be there debited to the
Ticasuiei, and deducted fiom the amount stand-
ing to Ins credit upon the books of the bank
These are believed to be full and pufect answeis
to the positions taken by the Senatoi to show
that a necessity for the sale of the bond did not
I   exist   The condition of the Treasuiv, therefoie,
II  at the time the sale was natte, appears fiom the
'j statement of the Secreta y ebovi   given, unim
peached by the eonsideiations to which the feeii-
, a or has referred, and which he seemed to sup
' pose inconsistent with it Is, then, the officei
i having chaige of the Tieasuiy Depaitment to be
j  taken as authouty for the state of the Tieasurj ,
its wants, and Us necessities, at any given period'
