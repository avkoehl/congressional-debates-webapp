could not believe the able membeis, who he ex-
pected uoii Id be opposed to the resolution, would
take a course so unworthy of them. If tney be-
lieve the resolution to be true, he expected them to
say so, an 11 > vote for it, but, if not, to say so,
and to ass ¿n Ihs ir reasons boldly and directly, and
not to kill it 1 y arguments foreign to the question.
In conclusion, he expressed his regret that his
colleague should think proper to make the motion
he did, and would assure him that, whatever might
be their difference of opinion on the great political
questions oí the day, he would, on all occasions,
abstain from making any moUon to embarráis any
measure which he might think proper to introduce

ne assumed, upon all occasions, with extreme re-
luctance He also felt that, in oppooxng the bill,

tneir v orldlv loitunes upen tne success of this
claim He knew that In"1 c'« um"i had tnan\
and \ aluable and worthy friends 11 this body, and
he «as free to admit, that their eondi'ion justly
d'ew towaids them the sympathies of ail It
should be his studied purpose, m the remaiks he
had to make, to say notning which could wound
toe feelings of the most tender friendship, or be
otTensiv e to the liveliest sy mpath es
When he asked a snoit postponement of the
i nal question upon the bill, several days «nice, he
avowed his object to be to obtain time to le-ex-
aimne the claim, having, several years since, and
when a member of the other House, made a paitial
examination of it, and formed conclusions strongly
unfavoiabie to its validity He h-id made the ex-
amination again, and found his tormer impressions
iully confhmed, and he now merely proposed to
give to the Senate, as briefly as it could be done, a
statement of the facts upon which his opinions
i sted He regretted that he could not have found
an oppoitunity to discharge this daty at an earlier
hour oí the eHv, and in a fullei Senate, as rn felt
conscious that many of the members were even
less a< qua n ed w ith the history of the claim than
he was btmselt Still he would not ask further de-
lav He had been prepared tor the question upon
the bill, on the day to which it was postponed upon
his motion, and as none of the delay which had
taken place since that lime was chargeable to him,
s > he would not now incur such a chaige, but
would proceed duectly to the task he had assumed
He found, i torn the papers m the case, that Mi
Meadt, hem? acifi7enof the Snteof Pennsylvania,
left this comilij foi Spam in the jcai 1803,tbathis
busings vv is exclusively of a private character, and
was, as he states himself, to obtain the idease oí
sime piopcih detained at But nos Ayns that In
was unexpectedly delay ed in the prosecution of this
attempt to release the property, and was finally un-
successful ¡n the undertakmsr, that while absent, he
conceived the design of establishing a commercial
house at Cadi/, in Spam, and, as soon as his other
cnltrpr sc was abandoned, carried that design into
execution, that lie opened an extensive American
liado, purcipally in provisions, and succeeded m
obtaining various contracts for the supply of the
Government and armies of Spam with provisions,
that successive contracts were made, and large sup-
plies furnished, through asertes of years, during the
w hole of which time Mr. Meade was a resident of
Spam, was domiciliated there, and made commerce
his business and pursuit.
In 1806 he was appointed Navy Agent of the
U"ited States for the port of Cadi/, which agency
of this G j veniment he continued to ho'd until some
time m the y ear 1816 or 1817, but it does not ap-
pear, nor is it alleged, that any of his troubles with
tne Spanish Government, or any part of this c'aim,
aro->e from anv transaction connected with his
agency foi the United Stages On the contrary, it
is admitted on all hands, and so thp fact' prove,
that his claims, whatev er they were against Spain,
and whatever they may no* be against this Go-
vernment, ha 2 grown solely out of his private
tiansactions with the Spanish authorities, out of his
contraes to furnish provisions, and the like, and
out of htigahons Between him and the Spanish au-
thorities, and between him and individuals, with
which the United States had no connection, directly
or ítidirecth, and in all of which he was acting

sofai as he had been ab'e to gather the h stor, from
the papers In the year 1812, Mr Meade s'at^s that
he found himself largely in advance to Spam, on
account of the supplies he had furn shed under his
several con'racts, to the amount of some eight hun-
dred or more thousand dollars, that he satisfied
himself, (upon what evidence he does not state)
that the Treasurei General of Spam Tras using
funds which, m good faith, and according to his
u ntiacts. with the Gov eramem, ought to have bpen
paid to him, that he wiote and published a pam-
phlet, setting forth the nature, cha-actei, and ex-

mencement of his difficulties with the Spanish au-
thouties
Vnother litigation, which seems to have con-
nee ted itself immediately and important!) with the
claims ot Mr Meade, arose as fallows
An in lie idnal by the- name of Glass, a merchant
01  (\idu, sometime in theveai l&li usii d Eiis-
lanct, was arrested there in consequence of his pe-
cuniary liabilities to the House oi Planter Ra ney
and Co oí London, ar>d a commission ot bank-
mptcy was obtained against him ía England, where
he was himself detained «pott to arrest A
¡Spanish tribunal, denominated "the Trítanal tíf
Commerce at Cadiz," took jurisdiction of tbeal&iis
and estate of Glass at Cadiz; and it sesms to be
admitted, on all hands, that the jorisáíeíSoa as-
sumed by this tribunal was rightfully SsmsmBi
In the course of its proceedings, this tabanal-ap^
pointed Mr. Meade the assignee of the «state of
Glass m Spam, requiring front hint bonds, contaia-
mg, among other conditions, one that he should "be
responsible solely to the tribunal" for the proceeds
of the estate of Glass, committed to his possesion,
care, and management. Mr Meade aeeeptwl the
trust, and entered upon its discharge. He closed
the affairs of the estate m Spam, and paid off all
the demands existing against it there. This being
done, he found an amount of about fifty-two thou-
sand dollars m money in his hands, being proceeds
oí the estate unexpended This balance, he sup-
posed, belonged to the assignees of Glass m Eng-
land and he s'ates that he made frequent applica-
tions to "the Tribunal of Commerce of Cadiz" for
leave to pay it to the English assignees, but that
the leave was not granted Sometime m the year
1816, Hunter, of the London house of Hunter,
Ramey and Co. visited Cadiz, upon the business
between tV at house and the estate of Glass. At
about the same time, Glass escaped from his bail
m England, reappeared at Cadiz, and laid an in-
junction upon the money m the hands- ot Mr.
Meade, to prevent its payment to Hauler, alleging;
that the property, of which this money was the pro-
ceeds, had been improperly considered as bound
by the commission of bankruptcy. A litigation,
therefore, arosp before "the Tribunal of Com-
merce of Cadu," between Hunter, representing
the London house of Hunter, Ramey and Co. and
G'as*, as to which had the right to receive the
mo iev trom Mr Meade Pending this litigation
be'v e n these par'ies, the tribunal, upon whose
application, or wh<nherupon any application at all,
does not appear from the papers, made an erder
that Mr Meade should, upon a day named in the
older, make a deposite of the money m the royal
treasury of Spam, there to await the decision of ihe
question to whom the money of right belonged
Mr Meade made a deposite under the order, and.
obtained a certificate of deposite therefor, which
was laid before the tribunal, or the purport and
effect of it made known to that judicatory. Fend-
ing the litigation, Hunter appointed a person by
the name of McDermot the agent of the London
house, and left Spam. DcDermot, subsequently,
raised a question before the tribunal as to the
sufficiency ot the depute made by Mr. Meade
n t íe rov al treasurv, in pursuance of its order,
allesi s that ihe deposite was not made in
specie but m soi<ie description of Government pa-
per le a valuable than specie. Mr Meade con-
ten led that tne ceruftcate of deposite showed that
the deposite hid been made m " effective specte,"
and tha*, whenever the tribunal should order the
pavment of the sum, "his Majesty would pay in
tlte same cotn " Still McDermot sued Meade, be-
fore the same tribunal, for the money, and reco-
v ered against him Meade appealed to a superior
judicial tribunal of the country, called " alzadas,"
but before this last named tribunal had gamed
possession of the cause, and had passed judgment
upon it, McDermot obtained an order, by which it
was transferred from ihe "al/adas" to "the Su-
preme Council ot War " This council confirmed
the decision of " the Tribunal of Commerce ot
Cadiz ' that Mr Meade was still liable, notwith-
stardmg the deposite he had made in the King's
tieastiiv, ta pay the fifty-two thousand dollars to
McDe-mot, or tho%e he represented From this
decision of the Supreme Council of War, Mr.
Meade attempted to take a further app*a!, but Jus
application for that purpose was not granted. Á
rehearing, however, before the same tribunal was
granted, and five new judges were added to the
court, to sit upon the new trial Before this new
trial took plat e, McDermot made an application
1oi the arrest of Mr Meade, upon the ground that
he was about to leave Spam, which application was
successful, and, on the second day of May, 1816,
Mr Meade was arrested and imprisoned in a pri-
son called "Santa CaUluia," at Cadiz
