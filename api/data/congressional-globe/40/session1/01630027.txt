Mr. STEWART. I move that that be re-
ferred (o a select committee of seven.
Mr. WILSON. Oh, no ; let itgo to the Com-
mittee on the Judiciary. You are on that com-
mittee.
Mr. STEWART. Very well; I move its
reference to the Committee on the Judiciary,
and that it be printed.

PETITIONS AND MEMORIALS.
Mr. WILSON presented the petition of
Maria Raftery, widow of Patrick Raftery, late
a corporal in the thirty-third regiment Mas-
sachusetts volunteers, praying for a pension;
which was referred to the Committee on Pen-
sions.
Mr. RAMSEY. I present a memorial of a
committee appointed by the River Improve-
ment Convention, held in St. Louis February
13, 1807, composed of delegates from some
ten or twelve States in the valley of the Mis-
sissippi, praying for an appropriation for the
improvement of the Mississippi and Ohio rivers.
The memorial contains some very valuable
statistical information, and I will therefore
move that it be printed and referred to the
Committee on Commerce.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. It will bo
so referred, and the order to print will be made
unless objected to.
Mr. GRIMES. The motion to print goes
to the Committee on Printing under the rule.
Mr. CONNESS. Not necessarily.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the
rule it will go to the Committee on Printing.
Mr. CONNESS. I think that question might
as well be settled here. My understanding of
the rule is that it is only a proposition 1 o
print extra copies that goes to the Committee
on Printing. It has not been the practice to
print memorials; I admit that; but there are
cases where memorials are of great importance
as in the present case, as stated by the Sena-
tor from Minnesota. I do not understand
that a motion to print need go to the Committee
on Printing under the rule unless it involves
the printing of an extra number of copies.
Mr. ANTHONY. There are certain ex-
cepted eases. A motion to print memorials'
must go to the Committee on Printing. A
law of Congress provides for it.
Mr. CONNESS. The chairman of the com-
mittee informs me that in this respect I am
wrong. Therefore I ask that it be printed by
unanimous consent.
Mr. GRIMES. Let it take its regular
course. We meet here to-morrow.
Mr. CONNESS. We cannot bo here to-
morrow.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. It can be
printed by unanimous consent: but under the
rule it goes to the Committee on Printing. If
there be no objection, it will be printed. The
Chair hears none; and the order to print will
be made.
Mr. MORGAN presented a memorial of offi-
cers and privates of the twenty-first New York

but eighty-four dollars; which was referred to
the Committee on .Military Affairs and the
Militia.
. Mr. TRUMBULL. I present a petition of
loyal citizens of- Jefferson county, Arkansas,
for the reduction Of the semi-rebel State gov-
ernment in that State to a Territory,' and the
appointment of General Powell Clayton as Ter-
ritorial Governor. As Congress have acted on
that subject '
Mr. SUMNER. I do not understand that
Congress has acted on that subject: I think
that is the great question before us at the pres-
ent session.
Mr. â€¢ TRUMBULL. To what committee
have you referred similar petitions presented
by you ?
Mr. SUMNER. They have not yet been
referred to any committee.
Mr. TRUMBULL. Then I will ask that
this petition lie on the table for the present..
The motion was agreed to.
Mr. TRUMBULL. I have also a memorial
of the so-called General Assembly of the State
of Arkansas, asking for an appropriation of
$2,500,000 for the construction of levees on
the Mississippi river in that State. I ask leave
to present it to the Senate and move its refer-
ence to the Committee on Finance.
It was so referred.
Mr. CHANDLER. I present a memorial of
citizens of Louisiana, asking for aid of the Gov-
ernment in rebuilding their levees, and as a sim-
ilar mernorialjhas just been referred to the Com-
mittee on Finance, I move that this be referred
to the same committee.
11 was so referred.
Mr. SHERMAN. I am requested to present
the memorial of a meeting of citizens of the State
of South Carolina residing in Anderson district,
j praying the aid of Congress for the establish-
j ment of an orphan home for the education of
j orphans, white and colored, upon the labor-
j school plan, accompanied by a number of
; papers, which show that the movement is an
| important one, and I think will heartily meet
j the approbation of Congress. It is supported
by a great number of citizens in that region of
country, and very earnestly urged by clergymen
of the Methodist Episcopal Church. If there
is any way by which the Government of the
United States could aid in such an object, I
would be very glad to see it done. I move the
reference of the memorial to the Committee on
Agriculture.
The motion was agreed to.
