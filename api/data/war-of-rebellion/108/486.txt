General S. COOPER,Adjutant and Inspector General C. S. Army, Richmond, Va.:

GENERAL: The steamer Nashville is now lying at the wharf at Morehead City in a very exposed situation, as I conceive. She is not immediately under the guns of Fort Macon, and there seems to be no good reason why the enemy could not advance up Core Sound at night in their launches and burn her without the fort being able to render any assistance or knowing of it until the thing was accomplished. I mention this with the hope that it may be communicate to Captain Pegram, of whose address I am ignorant.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Brigadier-General, commanding.

If there is just grounds for believing the charges to be true, please require him to turn over all the public funds in his possession, place in him under arrest, and prefer charges. We can't get rid of improper officers too soon, particularly those in the disbursing departments.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. C. GATLIN,

Brigadier-General, commanding.
