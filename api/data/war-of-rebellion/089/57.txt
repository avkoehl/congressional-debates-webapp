October 3, 1864.

It was ascertained by inspection this morning that a considerable part of the First and Second Divisions were not under arms at day-light. a situation where this precaution is more imperatively called for can hardly be imagined. Division commanders will have a staff officer on the line each morning to see that the troops are placed under arms at early dawn.

By order of Major-General Hancock:

H. H. BINGHAM,

Major, Judge-Advocate and Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.

Major H. H. BINGHAM,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General, Second Corps:

I have the honor to report that nothing of importance occurred on this line during yesterday. It is reported that the 8-inch columbiad to our left and front of Fort Morton is again in position. A few rounds were fired by the mortar battery and also from Fort Davis in reply to the enemy. No casualties.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JNumbers G. HAZARD,

Major, Commanding.
