CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
is a clear manifestation of public sentiment m favor
of stteh a measure."
The question pending was the motion of Mr.
SERGEANT to commit the resolution to the Com-
mittee of the Whole on the state of the Union.
Mr. BYNUM, who was entitled to the floor, said
he had" B©i risen on yesterday, so much with the
intention of making a speech, as to expess his hearty
concurrence in the sentiments expressed by the
honorable gentleman   from Georgia, (Mr. Glas-
cock,) and the honorable gentleman from   New
YórSr^Mr. Clark,) and he exceedingly regretted
<he if became the duty of the Chair to interpose and
arrest the remarks of those honorable gentlemen,
knowing that they would have been able to place the
subject in a clearer point of view than it was in his
power to do.   He also rose to express his astonish-
ment at the extraordinary course pursued by ihe
gentleman from Pennsylvania, (Mr Sergeant,) in
moving to commit the resolution to a Commitiee of
the "Whole on thestate of the Union, after having
been indulged by the House for three or four days
in succession, in lecturing the House and admini-
stration, and eulogizing—almost delivering a fune-
ral sermon over the corse of the dead monster—
the bank. After all this, it appeared to him strange
that the gentleman should conceive it to be his du-
ty, to the prejudice of those who feel it to be the r
duty to oppose a recharter of the Unite 1 States
Bank, to move to commit the resolution to the
Committee of ihe Whole, thereby depriving them
of the opportunity of defendin¿ themselves, or re-
plying to the arguments adduced by the gentleman,
because it is well Known that the rules' present a
member m Committee of the Whole from replying
to arguments made m the House    He hoped the
House would not adopt the motion made by the
gentleman from Pennsylvania, for this reason" that
these gentleman had raised the hue-and-cry about
the distresses under which the country was labor-
ing , when, in his opinion, if there was any distress
in this country, it had spmng from the action of
that profligate and monstrous institution, the Bank
of the United States.   He believed it was the Pan-
dora's box which had been the cause of all the
complaints, all the evils, and all the distresses,
of which we have heard so much on this floor.
He hoped the question might be taken at the pre-
sent session of Congress, so that the country might
be put at rest in relatien to it    Let gentlemen
come up to the question, and toe the maik.   Let
the question be decided in the House, and not sent
to the Committee of the Whole, where no vote can
be taken on it, and wheie discussion will onlv add
to the distresses which already exist     In his hum-
ble opinion, theie could be  nothing which would
affoid more solid and substantial íeüel than a deci-
sion  of this House, that will show  to those  ho
make complaints oí distress, and ring the changes
on the word panic, that their (avorite project is
hopeless; that a United Stales Bank can not be
chartered by the Congress of the United States ,
and   that    it  wis   m    vain    for   ihem   to   be
indulging   themselves   with    ihe   hope    that    it
can.   The sooner this was done ihe betler it will
be for the people  of the coantrj     In his opinion,
if we intend to act in good faith to the people, and
do any thing for the relief of the people of ihe coun-
try, and the distresses of that people, the verv fhst
thing we should do would be to detenmne uhethei
the establishment of a Umled States Bank was to
be expected by any parly in the counttj, to settle
and hx the question linally, so that the people of
the country and ihe capitalists of the country might
know what to do    He hadno douht that there was
a great deal of capita1 now held up which would be
invested in other business, if this question was de-
termined, and why not determine it at once, and
put it at rest1   Gentlemen, in «nppor1 of their mo-
tion to  refer this resolution to the Committee of
the Whole, say they want a d scussion of ihe sub-
ject.   Why, do Ihey not Know that it has been dis-
cussed ft ora year to vcarfor the last six jears,
throughout thewhoie country, and in bolh blanches
of Congress''   Do they not Know mat it has been
discussed in boih  branches ol   Congress at the
present session,   on almost   euiy subject which
has   been   brought   forward 1     Have    wc   not
heard the  ditties wheh ha\t  bien sun" in this
House by the gentlemen from Pennsylvania, in
eulogy Of their favorite institution. And do gen-
tlemen not know that this subject has been dis-
cussed until a large majority of the people oí the
country turn away from it with loathing and dis-
gust? It has been decided at the ballot box that a
majority of the people of the country were opposed
to the establishment of a national bank, and he
wished to be permitted to tell gentlemen that they
mistook the intelligence, virtue, and patriotism of
the people of the country, if they expect by this
piotracted discussion of the question, to drive
them from their oppose"™ l° a Bank of the United
States It was m vaii for them ,0 expect to rivet
the chains which had sP™nS from that institution,
on the necks of the peop'ei and lhc 'ooner the mat-
ter was decided, the bet'cr f°r lhe country, ah
it will put at rest all agitation a„j tuimoi!
The President of the Umted stales has been
accused of taking an extraord'nary course, and
of endeavoring to forestall public opinion, by
the very consistent gentlemen of the opposition
He has been denounced and declaimed against by
those who deal in declamaban, for the extraordi-
nary and high handed course he has pursued , and
it will be recollected by every gentleman heie, that
those who now denounce him for throwing out his
opinions in advance, denounced him two s ears as;o
because of bis non-committalism These gentle-
men then said that he was non-commi tal on every
thmg—that he would never toe the mark—that he
would never go in advance of publ c opinion, but
always followed after it Now, how evei, thev sav
the Presi lent has introduced both reckless and ex-
traordinary measmes, and they denounce him for
endeavoring to forestall public opinion All these
aiguments and denunciations should be (, irly met,
and he would ask the gentleman from Pennsjlva-
nia, whether the faends of the administration
would have the opportun ty of answ enn<r him in
Committee of the Whole' because the gentleman
well know s it is against the rule to reply to argu-
ments made in the House He w ished to see a direct
and eaily vote upon f us subject The people of the
country require it. They want to know what pros-
pects there are for the recharter of a national bank,
so that thf y may know what to expect He did
not believe that there was any gentleman in th s
House who was mimical to the establishment of a
national bank, who desired to avoid the question
by referring it to .the Committee of the Whole
Every individual who was at heart hostile to a re-
charter of the bank, must be disponed to keep the
subjetíÉrh the House, and not permit it to go to the
Committee of the Whole, where it may be discus-
sed to Ihe end of the session without coming to
any conclusiontheieon Gentlemen hive ulked a
gteat deal about sKulking and dodging question ,
but he would ask wno e\er saw sueh dodging ns
there had been on this question Gentlemen de-
sired not only to dodge the question, but to dodge
behind the rules of the House to save themselves
fiom having their arguments answeicd, and their
denunciations exposed
It was ea^y to make assertions, but it w as not so
easy to pi ove them therefoie, gentlemen endeavor
to shield themselves bv havnu? th" subject referred
to the Committee of the Whole Lot the Ameri-
can people see what party support i national
bank, let them see then sliensth and whit piospect
there is for them to succeed, and they w II be
satisfied The farm n" and mechanical interests
are now sitisfied Who, then are rnkins; ill
these complnnisi It )s the bmkite% the ng ba-
rons, and the stockjobbets These are the men
who are cndenonng to render the Go eminent
unpopular w ith the people, and mike then discon-
tented with th'ir counttv The rapid strides which
the bank is making for almost universal dominion
in America, warn us of the necessity of lettirg the
countty and the wotld know its lite as soon as
possible We haie heard but letenlly of this
institution sending an agent to Europe, p i!nps to
mletfcre with our commerce C\eiy day admo-
nishes us of the danger of the b ink and shall we
longer «it by and encourage agitation, and ?dd
to its power of doing injury to the ci un-
try1 He hoped that the demociacy of this
House would  give   it   as   then  op.mon  to   the
I democracy of thi'(ounliy, and to the agntulluial,
' mechanical, and laboring mlercs s of thf conntu,
that it was inexpedient to establish an institution
which had declared war upon the country, an I
stood out against ihe sovereignty oí the people
themselves. Let them know tins, let the wor d
know it, and we will hear but liti'e of this distress
which has been so long sounded in oui ears If,
however, this subject is kept in agitation before this
House and the country, the cry of distress, and pa*
nic, and confusion will be kppt up, the Piesilent
will be denounced, and a Bank of the United State,
will be held up as the only panacea for the coun-
try Gentlemen could not suppose we are igno-
íantofthe game they are playing They tell us
the tune has not ai rived for mtroiuemg tie subject
of a national bank But what do they mean by
this? They mean that they do not want it con-
demned, they do nt t want the tine voice oí the peo-
ple spoken on this subject, because they know it
would be against them
He hoped that no one who was oppos 1 to the
rechai ter oí this institution would hesiut  in voting
to reject the proposition submitted by the gentle-
man from Pennsylvania, to leiei this resolution to
the Committee of the Whole on the State of the
Union.
Mr CUSHMAN said, that believing every gen-
tleman to have made up his mind on the quest < n
in relation to the expediency of chartering a na-
tional bank, and that the stale ot the public busi-
ness would not permit of its funnel discu sion, he
moved the previous question.
Mr HAYNES moted a call of the Honse,whic'i
was ordered, and the roll ha\ mg been cabed o\ei,
and 195 members answere 1 to their names—
Mr MORGAN moied to dispense with all
luither pioceedmgs unlcr the call, which was
agretd to.
The previous qnestio i was then seconded—ay ts
