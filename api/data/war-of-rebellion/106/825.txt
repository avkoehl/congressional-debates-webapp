a force of about thirty fighting Indians with him from Upper Redwood, Grouse, and Boulder Creeks, with perhaps some from Mad River. It was this party that Lieutenant Geer, First Battalion Mountaineers, California Volunteers, had a fight with about the 29th of February. While this band is abroad they will infest the road between this place and Camp Curtis, making it dangerous to small parties this place and very unsafe for pack trains without a suffidcient escort.

Lieutenant Colonel R. C. DRUM,

Assistant Adjutant-General, U. S. Army,

Hdqrs. Department of the Pacific, San Francisco, Cal.:

COLONEL: Instructions from department headquarters, of the 2nd instant, directing me to send a company to Camp Wright, withdrawing Captain Douglas and his company to some other station, reached me just on the eve of my departure from camp near Fort Gaston, and I take advantage of this the first opportunity to state for the information of the department commander that it is almost impossibel for me to make the change at this present time without interfering most materially with my plans and operations of the troops in this district. I am working all, or at least trying so to do, to their utmost, and to stop now a part of same would in my opinion be decidedly injurious. I will therefore delay making this change till further orders are received on the subject, with the hope that the department commander will approve of the course taken by me.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. M. BLACK,

Colonel Sixth Infantry California Volunteers, Commanding.
