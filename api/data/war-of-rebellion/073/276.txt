Reports of Colonel George A. Cobham, jr., One hundred and eleventh Pennsylvania Infantry, commanding Third Brigade, of operations May 15-June 2.
HDQRS. THIRD Brigadier, SECOND DIV., 20TH ARMY CORPS,Near Cassville, Ga., May 21, 1864.

CAPTAIN: I have the honor to transmit the following report of the part taken by my command in the engagement at Resaca, Ga., on the 15th instant. I also inclose reports of the regimental commanders of the part taken by their respective regiments:

At 10 a.m. of the 15th the brigade received orders to move from its position on the extreme left of the line to a position near the Dalton, road, and was there massed in column of regiments in a ravine nearly parallel to the road and but a short distance from it. About 12 m. the brigade was ordered forward by Colonel Ireland, under direction of General Geary, and advanced up the hill, changing direction to the right. I advanced with my own regiment, the One hundred and eleventh Pennsylvania Veteran Volunteers crossed the Dalton road, and changing direction to the right, ascended the hill in front while a desultory firing was kept up the enemy's sharpshooters, and drew my regiment up in line on the summit. Here I was ordered by Major-General Hooker, commanding Twentieth Corps, to advance to the summit of the opposite ridge, on which the enemy had a battery in position and a strong line of breast-works and hold the position if possible. I immediately moved my line forward, down the hill, across the intervening plain, and up the opposite ridge. The ground for the whole distance of about half a mile was thickly covered with timber and brush and exposed to the enemy's fire. On reaching the summit we were met by a terrible fire from the rebel breast-works and also from sharpshooters in the trees.
