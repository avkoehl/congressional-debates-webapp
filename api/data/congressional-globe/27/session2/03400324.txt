Moas} as the Reporteirtmderate'od, whether he [Mr F 3 pro-
posee to lay aside the civil and diplomatic appropriation bill
until the loan bill had been disposed of?
Mr FILLMORE w&s understood to reply m the affirmative
Mr WISE snd it would occupy too much time
Mr TiLLMOREaaid he. trusted not Tbe exigencies of the
Treasury were^uch&s, he hoped, to induct the House, when
they understood ihera, to pass-the bill with as much despatch
an practicable
The SPEAKER, said that the vote of a majority only would
be required to gotnto committee, and it would then be in the
power of the committee to take tip what bill they chose
Some Conversation followed, in which Messrs EVERETT
andATUERTON participated
And the attention of the House was?called to the fact that on
a former day, a motion had been made to lay aside the civil
list bill, in order to take up the apportionment bill, that the
chairman £ Mr Bmaos] had decided the motion to be out of or-
der, and that, on an appeal taken, the committee had sua amed
the decision of the Chair
Mr FILLMORE then again asked the unanimous consent of
the House to go into committee, for tbe puipe^e of taking up
the loan bill
Mr. SMITH of Virginia objected
Mr FILLMORE moved that the i ules of the House be sus
pended for the purpose indicated, and asked the yeas and nays
on that motion, which wereordeied

On motion of Mr FÜ I MORE the House resolved itself into
Committee of the Whole on the state of tbe Union, (>ii
BiuGoa of Massachusetts in the Chair >
And the CHAIRMAN! navmg statu! the pending qnes ion on
the General Appropiiation bill (under consideration for some
time past)
Mr FILLMORE asked the unanimous consent of the Com
mittee to lay aside the said bill,  in order to take up  the Loan
Mr SMITH of Virginia objected
Mr FILLMORE mquned of the Chairman whether it was
in the power oí the committee to postpone the further conside
ration of the Civil and Diplomatic Appropriation bill
And Mr V submitted a motion to postpone
T he CHAIRMAN said tliat, according to the uniform prac
tice heretofore, such a motion was not m ouler    Inthejudg

the bill wis parhammnry
Mr MORGAN app aledfiom the decision
'I he CHAIRMAN surcd the question, íemarl tng that the

Some convention nilowed, m which Messrs PICKENS

So the decision of the Chair wa* i everwd in 1 the ( omrmttee
derided that a motion to postpone the consideration of the said
W1I was in older
And the question recuri mg on the motion to postpone, it. \\£s
^•teiifcml decided m tieafíunutive
So the further consideration of the civil and diplomatic ap
piopnation bill was postponed
And, on motion of Mr FILLMORE the committee took up
the bill for the extension of the loan of 184i,and for an addition
of five millions of dollars thereto
And the bill, having been first read throueh, was taken up'by
sections, and various amendments were offered by Mr FILL-
MORE and agreed to
And the fifth section being under consideration, and Mr
FILI MORE being in the act oi proposing certain amendments
thereto—                                                                    ,      ,
The whole business had to be done over again, for ihe rea
son that scarce any thing had been heard of what had been
going on, in conssquence of the buzz and confusion in the
Halt
Mr WISE rose and asked what ihe amendment proposed
was? He could not, so great was the noise in the Hall, heat a
word that was„said
'I he CHAIRMAN explained
Mr WISE Has thesecond section, or the first section, been
amended?
The CHAIRMAN Thefiisthas not been amended, the ¿e
cond has
Mr   WI E asked that the Cleik would tell him hoic
The Clerk being about to read the second section—
Mi WISE said it was utterly impossible for 'he Clerk or the
amendments to be heard unless order was preseived
The CíTAÍRMaN hoped that oidei w uld be preserved
The Chair could not do that which the members would not aid
him in doing, and he appealed to the committee to aid him m
maintaining that older winch was indispensably nece^ary to
the transaction of the public business
Mi CARUTHERSsaid he had been given to understand that
several amendments had been adopted, but in his pait of the
House they had not heard one of them
He pioposed that the bill be again read from the beginning,
that the members misht understand what they were about
So the work began again
And the first section of the bill being under consideration, in
the words following
Be %t enacted by tlie Senate and House of Representa
Uves of ihe United States of fymenca in Ca/ngiess assetn
bled, Thit the time limned by Cfee first section of the act of
Congress entitled "An act authouzfcig a loan nfct exceeding the
sum of twelve millions of dollars," q&piovedütfly 2lst, 1841,
fivobtai ing said loan, shall bi* and «¿ samehs hereby extend
ed for one year from the passage of thf&act
No amendment was offered thereto  \
And ihe second section being under \oiisideraiion, in the
words following                                           i
And be it fui ther enacted, That so niuch of said loan as
may be obtained aftei the passage of this act shall be made re
imhursaba eitheral the will of the Secretary of the Treasury
after six months notice oratany time after twelve years fiom
the first day of January next
On motion of Mr FIII MORE it was so amended as to read
at the close of the section, * not exceeding twelve )ears," in
stead of 'after' twelve years
And on motion oí Mr F (underdirectiouofthe Committee of
Ways and Means)thesecti m was fuither ampnded by adding
at the end theieof the words "as shall be agieed upon and de
termined at ihe time of issuing said stock '
Mr WISE then moved further to amend the section by ^tnk
in a out the woid "twelve" years, and inserting 'fifteen " [«o
as to extpn 1 ihe loan fo fifteen yean instead ot twelve]
Mr CARUTITER-) desiied to be in for n&\ by t ic Clidinnm
of the Committee of Wiys and Meuis[Mr Fn rvonEl whether
theie had been any opinion fiom the Executive Departments
in i elation to the time1
Mr FII LMORC All the communications we have ft >m
the Depattments specify the time of  welve yeais, and none
Mi WISE observed tha*, when the loan bill had fiist been rt
ported from the Committee of Ways and Means, the period
proposed for the loan had been eight years, but the House had
reduced U to three years, the effect of which had been to bring
the credit of the Government into mtei disgrace lie wag for
providing ample means to meet and to releem the entire pub
lie debt but this could not be done without allowing ampie
time He was wilhnsto go as fat is he tin' went fdithest b th
as to the extent an 1 the permai ncy oí the means of ipdemp
tion, and as the Secietary pi oponed that on six months notice
the whole amount will be redeemable at any time, Mie question
of durat on became a ma ter of the less consequence He did
not doubt that an extension of the time would enable the Go
vernment to get the mont> H wanted ?t a much cheaper i ate
than could otherwise be possible, and thus aconsi lei able saving
wouUVeffe<te<l
Mr GORDON utterly denied that the shortening the period
of the loan at the last bessi >u had brought the eredit of the G )-
vernment into disgrace, as had been affiirnedhy the gentleman
fiom Virginia
Mr WISE said he had not exactly said that it was the mere
shmiemnfc of the term which had biought Government credit
intodissrace, but tint it had led to hawking the Government
secuuties about the streets, and this had disgraced the Govern
menl                ,   ,        .         ...
Mr GORDON sad that this term " hawking" was a n w
teim which the gentleman had not u-ed be^bit but he denied
(hateven the * hawking " was what disgraced th" Government
No it wa^ the R vine; away the ptopei ty of the Government m

Mi CARDTHER^ halogen anxious to know from the chair
man of be ( ommittee of Ways an 1 Means whether the Eve u
ti -bianch of the G iveinmen had fixe I the length of time f i
the loan which, n theirjudsment would be nece saiy to gue it
-iucce-1 1 He had put this mquirv md the ch turnan ha ' jc
^ponded that twelve years Was the nme mentioned Mr ^ re
he 1 en the calculations and the information of those winse duly
it was t> behest informed on thesubjec1, and if they asked for
twelve ypars, he wou d not vote to extend the time

rreasuiy,™
and professed his readmess to vote the necessary aid to the Ga 
vernment, without any regaid to party piefe enees He was
for redeeming the Government of his country from the deep
disgrace of havingus notes publicly protested—a thing new m
the history of the Republic, and which he hoped might never
again occur It was obviously their duty to make the speed i
est provision for ielief, but he was not willing, with a view to
this, to extend the period of the loan, as now proposed One of
the strongest objections against a loan wa¡=, that it went to cre-
ate a permanent debt, and tms was the very t bjeuion by force
of which the period bad been so greatly reduced at the late ex-
tra'session Mr C thought the time then fixed was much too
shortcut fifteen years was as much too long, unless it could be
demonstrated that the money could he obtained on no other
terms, in wl ich case he would vote even for that, sooner than
leave the credit of the Government thus prostiate He should
like the chairman oí thecommnteetomakea disclosure of-facts
as to the wishes of the Depaitment
Mr UOOSE\ ELT rose to defend himself and his colleagues
onthatfloorfiom what he considered an unjust imputation.
They had been censured our of doors for remissness m pro-
viding the requisite funus tocairy on the Government, but he
too'c no parto! the chaige to himself Congiesswasumvenedat
the last session to provide the wavsand means, and the twelve
million loan bill was passed I here was ad veisity of opinion
m iegard to that bill but, aítci sufhcien t discussiun,it became the
law of the lana He would admit that the Treasuiy Depart
ment did a that time designate eight years for the ioan as the
peiiod calcula ed foi the neceas of the measure, it was right,
howevei to say that the Finance Commit e*- of that House,
after mature convídela i n of that question ame to the con
elusion-and he though it would be seen that it was not an
unwise cupclu&ion—to lecomnend that the term of eight years
should be ¡educed to three year'*, and that, n tead of 5 per
c< nt they lecomm^nded that 6 per cer shou] 11 e paid, it be-
irg moiecongenid! with out institutions to saddle our debts on
ourselves—that is to make the teim as shoi t a  possible—rather
than throw t le debt on om posteuty It that he, Mr R thought
they were correct Congress thought so in both branches, and
the bill beci mealaw But the first hill pioposesat this ses*
sion to designate a period four times as lone as that fixed by the
lawoftlelast session, and his friend from Virginia [Mr Wise]
piopose3to add another term of three years, making it five
times as Ions as that designated in the bill of the extra ¡session
Now he (Mr Roosevelt) thought the term proposed by the
committee long enot-sh, and he thought that was too long, if
this loan cou i be contracted, as it could have been at the last
session The gentleman fiom Vngmia labored under a mistake
in at rib ting t he failure of the loan to the shortness oí the time,
if he wasconectly írfoimed—andbe had reason to believe that
hismicmat on was pretty accui ate—the fault ldy not m the
bi I hut in tt e t thcer wl o had charge of it not the present
Secietaiy of theTieasuiv,bur his immediate ptedecessor And
he asked the chanman of die Coi ipiutee of Wavs and Means

But there wa^a trafnVing to get a half per cent moie Boston,
aid Philadelphia, and Baltimore were called Uf on, and it was
not eflected it 5¿ per cent, and he a-«ked the chairman of the
Committee of Ways and Means if there was not apioposal
made to theSecietaiy (Mr Ewmg) to the full extent of the loan

Mr FILLMORr lephed that he had no cfhcial information
on that point he had nothing but rumor as his authority, and

at this moment Ihe Government notes were protested, and
suits weie threatened against ir dividual citizens for hundreds of
thousand* of dollars What was to be done1 They must de
vise, somehow or other the ways an 1 means to get rid of the
difficulties and the proposi ion was to extend tie time of the
loan as an inducement with persons to take it He should have
been muoh better satisfied if it had been proposed to suspend the
opera ion of the Distribution act 1 here was then m the Trea 
sury about $203 000 received sirce the 1st of January last, and
this would be applicable to the wants ol the Government if the
land bill were repealed or su=perded, and if so, a portion of that
monev miaht have been made avai able and thereby the honoi
of the Government might havej^een saved Bat there was
no such proposition beiore tl em, to suspend that law, or
he should vote for it, and that not being before them, the
question was whether they should adopt this loan as a substi-
