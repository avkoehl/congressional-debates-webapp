THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
2223
my friend from North Carolina, that this might
create cases where a junior officer would be found
on board a ship drawing larger pay than the
senior officer, I beg simply to say this: from an
inspection of the legister, I find that such a con-
tingency could occur in very few cases. But
where it does, it occurs because of the fact that
the junior lieutenant has been attending for a
longer term of years to the active duties of his
profession than the senior officer; and I maintain
that on all principles of justice he is entitled to
receive the increased compensation. When that
objection was suggested m the committee, I made
inquiry about ics practical operation, and found,
011 the testimony of some of the most distin-
guished officers of the Navy, that it would not,
in any degree, tend to injure discipline or produce
bad feeling in the service.
Now, Mr. Speaker, my bill is the same as the
Senate bill, in so far as that provides for the pay
of captains, commanders, pursers, chaplains,
lieutenants, and every grade but surgeons and
engineers. 1 beg now to say to gentlcmen*ln the
House who are disposed to increase the pay of
this most meritorious and worst paid arm of the
public service, that if they pass a substitute in
this House that changes the principle of the Sen-
ate bill of sea-service as to the giade of lieuten-
ants— the point upon which the .fight has mainly
been made in the Senate— they give a death-blow to
any pay bill for the Navy this Congress, and keep
the service, it may be for years to come, upon the
miserable and insufficient pittance it now receives.
Mr. JHATTON. I desire to ask the gentleman
from Maryland a question. In pointing out the
difference between his bill and the Senate bill, 1
did not understand him to state whether his bill
differs from the Senate bill in reference to the pay
of Commander Maury.
Mr. HARRIS, of Maryland. It agrees in that
particular with the bill sent us from the Senate.
Mr. HATTON. Does the gentleman's bill
amend the Senate bill in reference to the pay of
Lieutenant Maury?
Mr. HARRIS, of Maryland. Yes, sir; it in-
creases it.
Mr. HATTON. Your bill does?
Mr. HARRIS, of Maryland. Yes, sir.
Mr. BRANCH. I would like to ask the gen-
tleman from Maryland a question for information.
I desire to inquire of the gentleman from Mary-
land, or of any other gentleman who is acquainted
with the provisions of this bill, whether the com-
pensation specified in the sections of the bill con-
stitutes the whole pay and allowance and emol-
uments of the officers of the Navy? I ask the
question because, m the Thirty-Fourth Congress,
t voted with a great deal of pleasuic for a bill in-
creasing the pay of the officers of the Army to a
point which i regarded as just and liberal and
fair; and I afterwards ascertained that they re-
ceived emoluments arid allowances that I knew
nothing about, and received about fifty per cent,
more than 1 supposed they would receive. I de-
sire, therefore, to know whether this covers all
the emoluments to officers of the Navy?
Mr. MORSE. The bill leaves the returns as
they are now at twenty-five cents per ration, and
the sailors and officers are treated just alike; and
there is no other emolument. The officers of the
Army are treated very unequally in that particu-
lar; but only one ration is allowed to officers of
all grades in the Navy, and to the sailois.
Mr. BRANCH. I would ask the gentleman
whether, under the existing law, officers of the
Navy ©f any grade are allowed more than one
ration ?
Mr. MORSE. None at all.
Mr. BRANCH. That is all I wished to know.
Mr. RUFFIN. 1 ask for the reading of the
amendments proposed by the Committee on Na-
val Affairs.
The Clerk read the amendments.

majority of the committee:
