PAW PAW, VA., February 19, 1862.

Major General R. B. MARCY:

Three regiments and one battery just gone by order from Town Creek to General Rosecrans, and a force at New Creek and Hancock, say two regiments, from distant sources. I am told there are 60,000 men at Winchester. What it means I don't know, perhaps you may. I want no more green batteries, but the rear being long and the enemy behind earth-works, would like 4,000 infantry. If you can't spare them order me to take Winchester and give me authority to burn it. I am confident I can do it with what I have. Muhlenberg's section was a terrible loss to me, having tried him under fire. My artillery can hit nothing.

F. W. LANDER.
