laws in said States.
The pending question being on the amend-
ment of Mr. Sherman, which was to add the
following:
And the report that may be made by tho Judiciary
Committee on that subject.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator from
Delaware is entitled to the floor.
Mr. BAYARD. I make this proposition:
if a vote can be taken on the resolution of the
honorable Senator from Rhode Islahd without
debate, I have no objection, but on the con-
trary I would desire to see it done, and then
we can proceed to the consideration of the
resolution offered by the Senator from Ohio.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator
from Delaware states that if a vote can be
taken on this resolution and thepending amend-
ment, without further debate, he will yield the
floor and make his remarks on the resolution
of the Senator from Ohio.
Several Senators. That is right.
Mr. TEIURMAN. I concur in that, but I
only wish to say that if the amendment moved
by my colleague to that resolution be adopted,
I shall feel constrained to vote against the
resolution.
The VICE PRESIDENT. Is there objec-
tion to the proposition of the Senator from
Delaware?
Mr. TRUMBULL. I shall offer some amend-
ments.
Mr. SUMNER. I have an amendment to
offer
Mr. CONKLING. Let them be offered and
voted upon.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The proposition
does not preclude the offering of amendments.
Mr. TRUMBULL. I do not agree to any
proposition that debate shall not take place.
I do not know that I shall debate the amend-
ments, but I do not agree to any arrangement
that will preclude debate.
Mr. SUMNER. I have something to say
also.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator from
Massachusetts and the Senator from Illinois
both state that they have probably remarks to
submit.
Mr. BAYARD. Mr. President 
The VICE PRESIDENT. Before the Sen-
ator from Delaware proceeds the Chair will
state that t.he Senator's remarks will not be
arrested at one o'clock, as this resolution is
the unfinished business of the last adjournment
as well as the hu<iness now before the Senate.
Mr. BAYARD addressed the Senate at
lengih. [His speech is withheld for revision,
and will be published in the Appendix.]
Mr. AMES obtained the floor.
Mr. S fEVENSON. Will the Senator yield
to me for a moment 1
Mr. AMES. Certainly, sir.
Mr. STEVENSON. Mr. President, the
Postmaster General lias called my attention
to a technical mistake of fact in the speech
made by me on Saturday last as reported in
the Globe. I am reported as having said :
"I have given you the statement of the mail
agent. 1 ga-ve it to the Postmaster General."
I called on the Postmaster General with that
statement. I uudprstood him to say he already
had it. This is a mere technical inaccuracy.
He tells me that he did not receive it, that it
had been sent to him with my message, but
that he never saw it until to day. My failure
to hand it to him was from the fact that one
of his subordinates told me that my message,
with this statement, was on his table. I do
not desire to misrepresent him, and I wish to
state the fact precisely as it occurred.
Mr. SAWYER. I send to the table" an
amendment to the ameudment of the Senator
from Ohio, which I propose to offer, and I
will state to the Senate that I shall try to get
the floor to make some remarks on it to-mor-
row morning.
