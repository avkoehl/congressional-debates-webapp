I came up with his rear guard this morning five miles from here on the Summerville road, but not knowing your exact position I concluded to return to La Fayette and await orders. I will camp to-night in the vicinity of Trion Factory and push on early in the morning and try and communicate with General Garrard.

Very respectfully,

Colonel, Commanding Brigade.

P. S. - Please request the ladies in my name not to leave Resaca at present.
