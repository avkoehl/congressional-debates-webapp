COLONEL: You will fire ten shots at the city during this afternoon and twenty during the night. You will give orders that all of the enemy's steamers in Charleston Harbor which can be reached by our artillery, or which may appear at the Mount Pleasant Wharf, shall be fired upon. The latter place and Mount Pleasant itself will be carefully watched.

Rear-Admiral D. D. PORTER,

Commanding North Atlantic Squadron:

ADMIRAL: If the wind continues favorable I intend to turn the enemy's position to-night by crossing Masonborough Sound, about two miles below the inlet. I propose to send a brigade of troops outside, in small steamers, with my pontoon boats and such small boats as you can furnish me. Let them land and haul the boats over the beach into the sound and thus cross to the mainland. The main portion of the troops will march up the beach to the point of crossing. I would like about thirty boats from the navy with strong crews, also the steam tug Wilderness, with the pilot who went with General Comstock yesterday. It is also important to have a strong naval force outside to cover the landing. I would like to have the boats report to General Comstock at the wharf at 4 o'clock this p. m. The men should be provided with two or three days' rations.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General, Commanding.
