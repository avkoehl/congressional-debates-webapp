GENERAL: The enemy has retired his line opposite our left, so as now [to be] almost in a perpendicular direction to the woods, in our front yesterday. He holds on the his right. From the left of my picket-line can be seen his intrenched line, apparently of some strength. I am swinging around very much on the left. The connection is well kept up with the Ninth Corps, but on the left there is nothing. I am still advancing, driving the enemy's skirmishers.
