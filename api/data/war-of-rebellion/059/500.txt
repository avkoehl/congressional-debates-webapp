KNOXVILLE, April 26, 1864.

Brigadier-General COX,

Bull's Gap:

I hope you will hear to-night or in the morning the result of the expedition above. Manson will, of course, have to remain where he can support the cavalry until he knows it is safe. Cars will go up to-night. I will give you the number and all details soon.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.

BULL'S GAP, April 26, 1864.

Major-General SCHOFIELD,

Knoxville:

Yours of this morning received. I will have Reilly quit work at noon and reach here this evening. We will do our best to carry out the programme. Manson was last night 100 miles from Knoxville, and Reilly 70. As soon as it is settled what number of cars can be put at my disposal please have Ransom inform me. There is a possibility that the enemy may run down a force to meet our cavalry, and so involve Manson in some delay. I shall not feel that we are free from contingencies till I know he is at Greeneville.

J. D. COX,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

BULL'S GAP, April 26, 1864.

Major-General SCHOFIELD,

Knoxville:

A train of seven cars has arrived, on which I send down part of Eighth Tennessee. They have four days' rations. The telegraph line was not working this afternoon, and I h ad no notice of the coming of the train. One regiment will march at daylight, the other I shall have to keep till I hear from Manson, who has sent me no news as yet. I have ordered the Eighth Tennessee to march from Knoxville at daylight unless otherwise ordered by you, and to draw two wagons to carry their cooking utensils and extra rations. As wagons and animals cannot go by rail we shall have no supply the regiments with new transportation, or let them wait at some point where they can be supplied by rail till their wagons arrive. Which mode shall we take?

J. D. COX,

Brigadier-General, Commanding Third Division.

KNOXVILLE, April 26, 1864.

Major General GEORGE STONEMAN,

Nicholasville, Ky.:

General Sherman directs that you come forward at once with all the cavalry which is now ready, and let the rest follow as soon as practicable. What force can you start now?

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.
