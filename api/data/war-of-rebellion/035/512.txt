why re-enforcements cannot be sent from Richmond to Lee, one of which is that "General Bragg has been weakened by withdrawing his troops and sending them to Joe Johnston; that he is threatened with attack; has fallen back to his entrenched position at Tullahoma, and called on Buckner for aid."

A three days' battle has been going on near Gettysburg between General Meade and General Lee; thus far successful on our side, with promise of a brilliant victory over Lee.
