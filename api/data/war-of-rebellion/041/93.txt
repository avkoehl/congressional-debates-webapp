A lieutenant of Grierson's cavalry is here, and says the enemy cannot escape across Thompson's Creek and between Fancy Point and the river. They must take the Bayou Sara road, if they escape at all. Should you wish me to fire again at night in the direction indicated in your note, throw up a rocket half an hour before I am to begin. Send me the news.
