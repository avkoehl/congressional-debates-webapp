HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE MISSOURI,June 17, 1865.

Brigadier General P. E. CONNOR,

Julesburg:

General Sully sends report, coming from Fort Rice:

Met 3,000 Indians on Heart River. Those Indians report that the Platte Valley Indians, Cheyennes, &amp;c., have joined this camp. They have learned that troops are after them. They are trying to get all the Sioux to join them. Large numbers have done so. The intention of these Sioux Indians and other hostile tribes is to abandon the country south of the Big Cheyenne River, but continue to hold the upper country, which is filled with buffalo. Before doing this they propose to clean out all the posts along the Missouri River.

When we make a final settlement with these Indians that is the very country we would confine them to.

G. M. DODGE,

Major-General.

I shall put one across Loup fork and one across Platte River near Fort Kearny. They are to be used as permanent bridges; are not fit for field service. More cavalry will go forward to You as fast as they arrive, and infantry are on the way here, which will be pushed right out.

Major WILLIAM McCLEAVE,

Commanding at Fort Sumner, N. Mex.:

MAJOR: I was obliged to return direct to Santa Fe from Franklin, but as soon as the business which has accumulated during my absence is done I shall come to Fort Sumner. The Congressional committee, now en route to New Mexico, will probably arrive within ten days, and will doubtless come to the Bosque within a few days after their arrival. From what I have learned below I do not believe any large armed party of hostile men will come to this Territory from the direction of Texas. Be sure and have all absent Indians at the Bonsque when the committee
