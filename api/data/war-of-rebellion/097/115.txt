Major-General MEADE,

City Point:

General Parke announces the reoccupation of the whole line, capture of many prisoners, and that all is quiet. In obedience to his orders I have notified corps commanders and sent shaft officers to haled Fifth Corps. Crawford is at Gurley house, Ayres behind him: Griffin at the Wyatt house. Wheaton's division probably reached Jones' house by the time General Parke sent his dispatch. The troops halted are awaiting further orders. I have asked General Parke is he desires Provisional Brigade any longer.
