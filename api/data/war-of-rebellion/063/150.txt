HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF COLORADO,Denver, Colo. Ter., April 13, 1864.

Captain S. H. COOK,

1st Cav. of Colo. Commanding Officer, Camp Fillmore, Colo. Ter.:

CAPTAIN: Keep a sharp lookout for Indians. Lieutenant Eayre is out on headwaters Smoky Hill after the Cheyennes, and Lieutenant Dunn had a fight last Tuesday (12th instant) and had 4 men badly, wounded, 2 fatally, and several Indians were killed. No telling where they will strike next. They are stealing large numbers of stock, and refusing to give them up, and there is but one course left for us to pursue, that is, to make them behave or kill them, which latter it now seems we shall have to do. Carbines and carbine ammunition are now on the way for your command. When you send men after these red robbers, arm with only carbines and pistols; leave sabers in camp. Be careful to provide your men on scouts, so that they will not be compelled to return just as they are about to overtake the Indians.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEO. H. STILWELL,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF COLORADO,Denver, Colo. Ter., April 13, 1864.

Captain GEORGE L. SANBORN,

1st Cav. of Colo. Commanding Officer, Camp Sanborn, Colo. Ter.:

SIR: Yours is received giving account of Indian fight.* Surgeon leaves in few minutes. Am sorry Lieutenant Dunn left the Indians at all. Put your force in best trim and avenge the injury done to it. I send to Camp Collins for Hawkins to cut them off; also to Fort Laramie. I now have Lieutenant Eayre on the headwaters of the Smoky Hill after them. They stole 175 head of cattle. You will have to be very vigilant. Carbine cartridges come to you by to-morrow's coach; look out for them that they are not carried past you.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEO. H. STILWELL,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF COLORADO,Denver, Colo. Ter., April 13, 1864.

Lieutenant Colonel WILLIAM O. COLLINS,

Commanding, Fort Laramie:

Lieutenant Dunn, First Cavalry of Colorado, had a fight with band of Cheyennes near Fremont's Orchard on the 12th instant; 4 men wounded, 2 fatally; several Indians killed. They have gone with stolen stock in your direction. Look out for them and skill them. They are stealing in every direction, and refusing to give up stock when caught.

J. M. CHIVINGTON,

Colonel, Commanding District of Colorado.
