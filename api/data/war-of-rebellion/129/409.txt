In relation to Mr. Rutland's case, I will state that in the entire Third Purchasing Division of South Carolina he is the only party who has forced me to issue impressment paper, and in this case I felt it my duty to proceed; otherwise the people of moderate means seeing a man of wealth allowed to retain his cattle, a disposition to do the same might become general and force me to a general impressment. The statement of John E. Robertson is regard to the impressment of his two cows with calf is rebutted by Mr. Myers' sworn statement, and Mr. Myers informs me that he has never carried out the impressment in this case, nor had any cattle whatever from Mr. John E. Robertson.

Paper No. 3 is indorsed "Copy of letter of Governor M. L. Bonham, Columbia, S. C., March 2, 1864. "* In connection with this I will premise that while the Legislature was in session I was in Columbia and conversed with one of the members of that body, stating to him the mode of procedure adopted be me in procuring the provisions of the country. In answer to the letter of His Excellency Governor Bonham I will state that General Orders, No. 37, section 11, paragraph II, distinctly states that the notice which the officer is directed to serve upon the owner 'shall bind the said property until the completion of the negotiation for the sale or appropriation thereof, so that there can be no removal or transfer of the same; " and as regards the nature of the peril incurred, I have never regarded it as His Excellency terms it, "personal peril," but only that peril which every person incurs in resisting the carrying out of the laws by the properly authorized officers. Governor Bonham states that the effect of this notice has been to cause distress to the poor of the country, the people of the towns and cities, and refugees, &amp;c. To this I answer that I received orders from the chief commissary of the State, Major H. C. Guerin, commissary of subsistence, not to interfere with provisions in transit to the markets, and I have given to all agents from the first moment of my taking charge of this division strict orders on this point, and I have frequently seen parcels of subsistence stores passing over the roads to Columbia and Charleston, and have often aided their transit. If the people of the towns and cities have suffered, it has most likely been from the speculators among themselves, to whom the farmers have been eager to sell the supplies which the Government needed for higher prices than the Department was authorized to pay, and who, swarming the country, have overbid each other and continued to accede to the increased demands of the farmers, and then in turn exacted from their customers prico suit their views.

As regards preventing the sale of a bushel of meal or flour to the needy at home, this may have happened, but I opine it was only in cases where the holders were only too glad to have a loop-hole to escape from that duty of benevolence; and I imagine that at the same time the opportunity was not lost to get good prices from speculators. It is true that supplies were interrupted, or rather that I vainly endeavored to interrupt them in transit out of the State. In this I acted under orders, but not being supported, and in danger of coming in conflict with the people, I abandoned the efforts, and thousands of bushels and pounds of subsistence stores have passed out, sold by the farmer to parties from neighboring States. This has been also another fruitful cause of the exorbitant demands of the farmers for provisions.
