HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF NORTH CAROLINA,New Berne, N. C., May 10, 1864.

Brigadier General L. THOMAS,

Adjt. General U. S. Army, Washington, D. C.:

I presume that it will be needless for me to inform you that the article contained in the New York Herald, of the 6th instant, stating that immense amounts of public property were destroyed by fire in recent evacuation of Little Washington, &amp;c., is absolutely false. No public property was abandoned or destroyed-that is, none of value. It is difficult to trace the firing of the buildings, but I hope yet to discover the incendiaries. All of the refugees are being cared for.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

I. N. PALMER,

Brigadier-General.
