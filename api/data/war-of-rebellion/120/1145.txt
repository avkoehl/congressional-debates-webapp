I do not understand this as an order to send these parties off by flag of truce, but simply that they are subject to be sent when a due occasion offers. If I am wrong I can be corrected. If I wait awhile I can make good use of them. Please let me have your views.

Have just received letter from rebel General Vaughn saying he is authorized by his Secretary of War to meet me or other agents to agree upon terms for exchange of non-combatants of East Tennessee held by either Government. I am authorized by Secretary of War to complete arrangements of exchange already commenced. Shall I meet him?
