Captain J. D. ROUSE,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General:

SIR: I have the honor to report the head of my column near Magnolia, Fish River, and that I expect to get all my artillery and trains up and in camp by dark to-night. The camp-ground is very good, and there is enough room to accommodate a corps. The roads from this point (East Fork of Fish River) to Magnolia are very bad, owing to the late rains. I would also respectfully report that three brigades of the Sixteenth Army Corps and the pontoon trains have arrived and landed opposite Magnolia.

Hoping that the above will prove satisfactory, I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

HENRY BERTRAM,

Colonel Twentieth Wisconsin, Commanding First Brigade, Second Division.
