The board most earnestly call attention to the fact, as shown in Appendix C, that these are but twenty-eight guns in the exterior line of river defense, and of these eleven only are heavy guns.

The board also call particular attention to the insufficient armament of Fort Boggs, a most important work in the interior line of the river defenses, and the urgent necessity for the seven heavy guns recommended.
