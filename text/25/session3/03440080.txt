pose that the House are about to organize a com-
mittee less fairly than he has done The Speaker
has, in all cases, had all parties well represented
on the important committees. How can we, if we
pioceed by ballot, foresee the result' We may
have a committee composed entirely of members
of one or the other party One member of the
House will not know who are balloted for by
others, and it may happen that a majority of the
House, desiring to have a fair committee, may
have that wish frustrated by a few members act-
ing in phalanx, while the great majority of us are
acting without concert or previous consultation
If, on the contrary, we proceed to elect vwa voce,
each member will have an opportunity to see how
others vote, and the House may select a commit-
tee entitled to the confidence of the country.
The gentleman from New York has thought
proper to delivei a eulogy upon the merchants of
the city of which he 13 a Representative There
did not appear to me to be any necessity for so
doing No one has undertaken to question the
integiity of the great body of the merchants any-
wheie There is no class of citizens who can
have strict (ustice done to all who compose it, by
eulogies or condemnations pronounced upon the
whole maas There are honest men and rogues
to be iound among farmers, manufacturers, or
mechanics, and the gentleman must not consider
me ilhbeial m supposing that there may be one,
two, 01 even a halt dozen black sheep in the flock of
merchants whom he has praised in i>uch handsome
language Notwithstanding all that has been said
of them as a body, dnd I íespond to most that has
been f>aid, it may appeal that one or more of thebe
merchants, whose bonds were delivered up by
Ssvartwout,gave in exchange for them not money,
but houses, and lots, or fancy stocks, estimated at
four times their intrinsic value.
I was about to dwell a moment upon the ques-
tion, how far is the Secretary of the Treasury
chaigeable with negligence in failing to discover
the defalcation of Swaitwoutatan early day But
I will not do so now. I will merely remaik, that
no candid man will deny but that the defective
chaiai ter of our laws ¡iflonled facilities to commit
the plundei of which the late New York collector
js guilty. He was authonzed, under the law, to
retain luige amounts of public money in his hands,
to pny the salaues of officers in the employment of
the United States at New Yoilf, and to satisfy
claims oí meichants of various chaiacteis and of
laige amount, niismg under oui revenue laws
Besides, undei the old deposit law, which is now
exuiK t, the collector had placed to his own credit,
111 the deposit banks, all the money ieceived from
meioharus in payment of duty bonds This im-
mense fund he could dispose of as he pleased,
without having ihe previous consent of the Secre-
tary of the Tieasury
That this discretionary power ought not to have
been given to any one man, we all now see and
confess     But the law which conferied it did not
emanate fiom the Executive Department     It was ,
passed by Congress, and received the sanction of
all parties here   And now, when the discretionary "
power which it gave to our collectors of the cus- h
toms has been giossly abused by one of them, an |
attempt is made to heap upon the head of one man,
the becretaiy of the  Tieasury, all that responsi- j
bihty which should be shared, in some degree, by '
eveiy public man who has aided to frame the sys-
tem of laws regulating the Treasury Department
Iheie is ásense  of stern justice in  the  public
mind, that will revolt at such a procedure    Again, ,
1 say, let us perfect the laws, and then, and not
till then, arraign the chief executive officers for a
failure to guard against all misconduct upon the
part oí those in employment urder them.                 1
DRY DOCK Af PHILADELPHIA

improvement at Philadelphia, being under consid-
eration in the House as in the Committee of the
"Whole,
Mr. KEIM said he should trouble the commit-
tee but a short time, but could not allow this op-
portunity to pass by without briefly expressing
his views on a proposition which had met with
such decided, and, to him, unexpected, opposi-
tion He could perceive a disposition to refuse
the amendment of his colleague, [Mr Pavnter,]
and deny that to Philadelphia which was pro-
posed for New York But if this was the inten-
tion, he trusted the bill itself would be rejected;
for there had not been advanced a single reason
in favor of one situation that did not with equal
force apply to the other.
He would ask in what respect Philadelphia was
less worthy than her sister city of the bounty and
protection of the General Government' Is there
less skill amongst her mechanics > It is too well
known that she stands unrivaled for all that
science can suggest, or ingenuity can achieve, in
the art of ship building Will it be contended
that materials are there procured at greater cost?
Or on what possible ground can the committee
have reported this bill, without being obnoxious
to the charge of paitiality > It is not for Phila-
delphia alone that this improvement is urged, but
I for the benefit of the whole Union It is, as a
national measure, essential to the welfare of the
whole country, and connected closely with the
protection of an extensive line of coast, otherwise
entirely at the mercy of an invading enemy In
the midst of a war it is no time to incur the risk
of sending ships to other distant ports for the pur-
pose of completing them. What a reproach upon
the patriotic feelings of our industrious working
men, that they should witness a ship of the line
lying in ordinary, because, forsooth, there is no
facility for her completion There is too much
dangei,not only from the elements themselves,
but from the steamers of the enemy, to counte-
nance the propriety of any ship of war quitting
port without being prepared for battle.
Pennsylvania demands as a right the fullest pro-
tection to her commerce That mighty Common-
wealth, through an extensive system of internal
impiovement, and at an expense of more than
$25,000,000, has concentiated her trade from the
interior to her metropolis The interest of nearly
every section of the State finds a marketatPhiladel
phia And is it asking too much that it should
find at least the assuiance of safety at the hands of
the Geneial Government ? The erection of dry-
docks was one of Mr Jefferson's earliestand most
favoi ed topics In his message to Congress in
1802, he earnestly recommended the commence-
mentof dry-docks in this Distnct,capacious enough
for twelve frigates of forty-four guns each And
when we reflect at the lapse of time that has oc-
curred since then, it is impossible to withhold our
admiration at the sagacity of that great statesman
and philosopher Thirty-iix years have now
elapsed,and although each succeeding Adminis-
tration has urged similar objects, yet such is the
apathy on the subject, that it betokens a great and
culpable neglect somewhere. Shall it be said that
we will only adopt measures when other nations
have lejected them, or when the march of im-
piovement shall have superseded their necessity'
The necessity for dry-docks at every naval station
is indisputable, nay, is conceded by the concur-
rent opinions of the Secretary of the Navy and
Navy Commissioners By them calculations have
been made of the great expense and loss of time
that occurs in repairing vessels below the water's
edge, and the advantages of a dry-dock are very
clearly set forth The report of the committee
also insists that every navy-yard should have a
dock-
"The necessity for dry-docks being, then, well
' established, the inquiry will be, how many are
' requisite' And here starts the question, whether,
' to secure a proper efficiency in our naval con-
' struction, it is not necessary that every navy-
' yard should have a dock One thing is clear and
'ceitain, and was well said, that in time of war
' vessels cannot betaken from the port where they
'are fitted, to another port, to be docked, with-
' out great risk of capture Another suggestion
' is, that to secure a ship every advantage in sail-
Ho. of Reps.
' mg, her form should be kept to its original shape,
' and lest she might be strained, or receive bruises
' to her bottom, in sailing for another port, it is
' desirable she should be coppered at the yard
' where she was built. Again, it is suggested
' that no ship of any magnitude should be cop-
' pered on her ways, being liable to have her cop-
' per injured from launching However careful
' carpenters and calkers may be, leaks are frequent-
' ly left, which will discover themselves as soon
'as the ship is launched, and can then besubstan-
' tially repaired as soon as she is got into dock It
' would, moreover, probably be no more than an
' act of justice to the mechanics and ship-builders
'at each station, that the arrangement at each
' yard should be such as would enable them fully
' to complete the work before it went to sea. Un-
' der this view of this subject, it does appear to be
' a matter of importance, if not of essential neces-
' sity, that a dry dock should be constructed at
' each of the navy-yards where vessels of a large
' class or size are built "
There are many objections from southern gen-
tlemen as to the locating of these improvements,
and many scruples entertained as to the expendi-
ture to carry them on It seemed to him (Mr. K )
that no measure could be more exphcit'y detailed
under the provisions of the Constitution than this.
The power " to provide and maintain a navy" is
so explicit that " he who runs may read " and
comprehend it, nor can any contend that a navy
can be provided without means are dispensed for
that purpose.
The policy of delay has been practiced too long
for any good result A few thousand dollars,
promptly applied to the satisfaction of a few Indian
claimants, might have saved the expenditure of
twenty millions in the Florida war; a few dollars,
promptly invested now, may save us incalculable
sums, when the period returns which shall present
a hostile fleet upon our coast. In all human cal-
culation, the atmosphere of peace may soon be
reddened with blood, and its dull portentous
silence be disturbed by flashes of fire and the thun-
der of cannon
It will then be too late to resort to any effort
that will divert our physical energies from deeds
of war to works of peace. In defense of the coun-
try a human hecatomb must assuage the neglect
of a high duty, so often and so justly solicited
from us
He was sorry to hear his colleague [Mr. Petki-
ken] denounce these appropriations as not being
Democratic, and had only now to say that he had
yet to learn that true Democracy consisted in op-
posing measures having for their object the gen-
eral defense of the country. He believed we were
not only empowered by the Constitution, but that
one of the great objects for which our Government
was established was to render aid whenever re-
quired,to strengthen the line of coast defense, and
so to protect it as to be prepared to meet the com-
mon enemy.
He was satisfied, without regard to sectional
distinctions, whether of the North or the South,
that all were alike entitled to ask aid for such pur-
poses, and that all alike ought to be sustained. He
discarded all sectional feeling, and had but one ob-
ject in view, and that was, the general defense of
the whole Union. The beautiful metaphor that,
"from the South comes the whirlwind, and cold
from the North," cannot apply in this debate.
They were all here, or ought to be here, acting as
freemen combined for the public good, they were
not here for the purpose of representing sectional
differences Territory did not weigh an atom
with him, it was the fitness of things, the adapt-
ation of the site to the purpose for which it was
designed, and the peculiar position of the country,
no matter whether North or South, would alike
find in him a friendly support Let me tell you,
sir, that we are behind the age m most of our prep-
arations for war Whilst it is said that other
nations are already applying the steam engine to
their vessels, we have the merit of the first appli-
cation of the principle, without a single evidence of
its utility There was no one opposed to expendi-
tures more sincerely than himself—unnecessary or
uncalled for expenditures—but experience had
confirmed the maxim that " in peace prepare
II for war " Economy is, indeed, a virtue, but a
