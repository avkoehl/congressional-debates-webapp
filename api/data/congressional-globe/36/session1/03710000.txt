amendments. The only way to avoid this sys-
tem of legislation is to defeat a few of these appro-
priation bills; and perhaps it is as well to com-
mence with this.
Mr. STEVENS, of Pennsylvania. I want to
know whether gentlemen consider that a non-
concurrenco in the report of the committee of
conference is equivalent to a defeat of the bill ? As
I understand it, it is no such tiling. We can have
another committee of conference right away.
Mr. WASHBURNJ2, of Illinois. I object to
this indiscriminate farming out of the floor.
Mr. SHERMAN. I will not detain the House
much longer. As a record of the facts, and to
show the action of the House on all of the appro-
priation bills, 1 will send to the reporters the table
I have referred to, in order that it may go into
the Congressional Globe in connection with these
few remarks. It will show precisely the condi-
tion of the appropriation bills when they came
from the Committee of Ways and Means, what
it was when they passed the House, what it was
when they passed the Senate, and what it was
when they went to the committees of conference.
It will then be shown who loads down the ordi-
nary appropriation bills. It will be seen how far
the declaration of the Secretary of the Treasury
is sustained that Congress loads down these bills.
It will be seen that Congress has not done it; that
the Committee of Ways and Means has not done
it; that the House has not done it; but that the
Democratic Senate has done it. It will be seen
that a Democratic Senate have insisted on its
amendments in the committee of conference. And
now, forsooth, when we have made as good a
bargain as we could with a Democratic Senate;
when we have reduced the appropriations as low
as wc could, we are told by gentlemen on. the
other side that, because this thing or that thing
does not suit them, they will defeat the bill! I
do not care if they do. Upon their shoulders will
rest the responsibility. It is their Administra-
tion, and not ours. 1 have voted for the report,
because it is the best we can get from the Senate.
If another conference be held, instead of further
reduction, other amendments of the Senate will
be insisted on, I have no doubt.

Mr. BRANCH. Mr. Speaker, the House, I
think, will do me the justice to say that there was
nothing in my it-marks to justify the attempt of the
honorable chairman of the Committee of Ways
and Means to give u party complexion to tiie
differences on the report of the committee of con-
ference now before us. I have not assailed the
201
other side of the House. I have appealed to my
own side as well as to that side of the House.
I slated distinctly that I voted in the negative to
enable me to move to reconsider, and to appeal
to both sides to adopt the report of the committee
of conference. I shall join no issue with the gen-
tleman from Ohio as to which party is responsi-
ble for the defeat of the bill. If the gentleman
can show that the Senate have put on this bill the
items that are offensive, then he will only suc-
ceed in showing that that body has acted in a
manner deserving of condemnation. I do not
join issue with him on that. If I chose to join
issue with him, perhaps the records of the Senate
