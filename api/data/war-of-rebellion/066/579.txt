BATTERY Numbers 2, July 10, 1864-3.10 p. m.(Received 4.25 p. m.)

Major STRINGFELLOW,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

Five transports, with troops, have passed out of the Stono, going south. Fourth transport loads were landed at Battery Island; they may be there still. The mortar-boats have dropped down to Battery Island. The Pawnee and Atlanta are near the wharf on John's Island, and are shelling the woods on John's Island. They may see out troops. No vessels in range of our guns except one monitor at old anchorage. Four transports are in the StoNumbers Two monitors, Pawnee, Atlanta, and two transports this side of Battery Island. I cannot tell, for the woods, how many of the enemy are on the peninsula; not many ar visible. I will be on the alert, for this sending vessels out may be a dodge. I should have mentioned this morning that I sent out some of the Naval Battalion in boats and brought ashore the fire-rafts last night, before they reached the bridge.

WM. B. TALIAFERRO,

Brigadier-General.
