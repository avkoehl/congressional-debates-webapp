WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, July 16, 1864. (Sent 8.30 a.m.)

Major-General WARREN,Commanding Fifth Corps:

I am instructed to inform you that General Gregg is ordered to return to his former camp on Jordan's Point, and leave one of his brigades to picket and patrol on the left of the army. The commander of the brigade will be directed to report to you everything that occurs as well as to these headquarters. He will picket about on the line now picketed, connecting with the infantry picket on the right, and extending around to the plank road near the church. Will patrol well down the plank road, well down the old Norfolk road, and send out scouting parties toward the railroad, Wyatt's, and toward Reams' Station.

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS, July 16, 1864. (Received 9.50 a.m.)

General WILLIAMS,Assistant Adjutant-General:

Nothing unusual occurred in front of my lines during the night.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS, July 16, 1864-11 a.m.

General HUMPHREYS:

I think it would be a good arrangement to have a brigade of the Second Corps relieve General Ferrero's picket-line and let us have his troops to work with. It will make a better working force and a better picket-line. The line is not in sight of the enemy and can be relieved at any time.

Respectfully,G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, [July] 16, 1864.

Major-General WARREN:

I will be at your headquarters to-day, but I can't set an hour at present. Captain Harwood was ordered to report to you this morning.

G. H. MENDELL,

Captain, &amp;c.
