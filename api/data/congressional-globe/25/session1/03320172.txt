25th CoivG    1st Sess                                     Mukins; public officers depositories—Mr. Webit
of the precious m"ta!s will, it is b 1 eved, bp a ten
poraryenl, but, until they can again be rendered
the general merimm of exchange, it devolves on the
wisdom of Congiess to pioviele a substitute, which
shall equally engage the confidence, and aecommo
date the wants, of the citi7ens throughout the
Union If the operation of the State h inks can not
produce this result, the probable operation of a na-
tional bank will meiit consideration, and if neither
of these expedients be deemed effectual, it maj be-
come necessary to ascertain the terms upon which
the notes of the Government (no longer required as
an instrument of credit) shall be issued, upon mo-
tives of general policy, a* a common nWwm of
circulat on "
Here, sn, is the express lecommcrdation to Con-
gress to provide a " Natural Cürrfncy," apaper
currency, a uniform currenc\, for the uses of the
community, as a substtfu e for the precious metals,
and as a medium of exchange It devolves on
Congress, sais Mr Madison, to provide such asub-
stitute as shall engage the confidence and accom-
modate the w ants ot the citizens throughout the
Union, and if the S ate banks can not pioduce this
result, a national benk «ill meiit consideration
Can language be more explicit* Currency, national
currency, cunency foi exchange, currency which
shall accommodate all the people, is the great and
leading, and, I may add, the sole and single object
of the recommendation
Contrast now, sir, this language, and these sen-
timents, with those ot the Message before us Did
Mr Madison confine his recommendation to such
measures of relief as might be useful to Govern-
ment merely1 Did he loox exclusively to the
Treasury ? Did he content himself with suggest
mg a proper medium for the icceipt of revenue, or
a proper deposite for its sa<e-ko"pm"? Far othei-
wise Ills view was genual, siateimrdikc nd
fitted to the exigency of the times Th< existing
evil was one whieh afflicted tht whole conntiy
and the íemedy proposed bj him was, as it hould
have been, commensurate wnh the while evil
And, sir, what a shock it would have produced at
that time, if Mr Madison seeing the piostrate
state of commerce and business all around him,
had recommended to Congress to do nothing m the
woild but to take care that the taxes w ere collected,
and those in the employment of Government well
paid
We!!, sir whit was done with tnis message?
Why, mi , the House ot Representatives resolved
" that so much of the Piesiduu's Message as rela-
ted to a umloim national eurunoy should be teler
red to a selecteemmittee " Such a committee was
raised, and Ihc honorable membei irom South Ca-
rolina was placed at its head, as lit well deserve I
to be, lioni his standing in the H )t se and his well
known opinions on thissubjut 1 he he noiab c
member was thus at the head of a eommulec, ap-
pointed, noton the subject oí a leveuut e unene j,
or a currency for Government, but a i mioi m na-
tional OLiini ncs , and, to effect the gieat object of
this appointment, he bion<*hf m a hiK tor the esta-
blishment oí a Bank ol the Uniied Slate •>
As had been the case formeily so on this occa
sion, the Seerttaiy oí the Tieasmy mae'e a 'epoit

whenever tne emergency occuis that d" mn's a
change of systen, it «eems necessa ily to ' hoi
that the  authority  which was alone competen   to
establish the national com„ is alone competent to
create a national substitute It has happened,
however, that the com of the United States has
ceased to be the circulating medium of exchange,
and that no substitute has h iherto been provided
by the national authority During the last year,
the principal banks cs^bbshed south and west oí
New England, resolved that they would no longei
issue '•om m payment of their notes, or of the
draft-, of their customeis, for money received upon
deposite In this act the Government of the Uni-
ted States had no partieipatiem, and yet the imme-
diate effect of the act was to superseele the only
legal currency of the nation Bv this act, although
no S'ate can constitutionally emit bills of credit,
corporations erected hy the several States have been
enabled to circulate a paper medium, subject to
rniny of the practical inconveniences of the pro-
hibited bd Is of credit "
" Of the services rendered to the Government by
some of the State banks, during the late war, and
of the libeiaht} by which some of them aie actuated
in their intercourse with the Treasury, justice le-
quiies an explicit acknowledgment It is a fact,
however, mcontestably proved, that those institu-
tions can not, at this time, be successfully employed
to furnish a uniform national currency The fail-
me of one attempt to associate them, with that
view, has already been stated Another attempt,
by their agency m cnculalmg Treasury notes to
overcome the inequalities of the exchanges, has
only been paitially successful \nd a plan recently
pn posed, with the design to curtail the issues of
bank notes, to fix the publi" confidence in the ad-
ministratii n of the affans of the banks, anel to give
to each bank a legitimate share in the circu'at on,
is not likely to receive the general sanction of the
hanks The tuith is, that the charter restnctionsof
some of the banks, the mull 1 relation ant de-
pendnnee of the banks o"-the same State and even
et the banks oí the difftient States, and the duty
w Inch the dire ctoi 9 of each bank conceiv e they ow t
to their immediate constituents upon points of se
cimty or emolument, interpose an insuperable ob-
stae'e to an) volunf">ry arrangement, upon national
consideiations alone, for the estabhshment of a na-
tional medium through the agency of the State
banks "
"The establishment of a national bank is re
garde d as the best, and perhaps the only adequate
resource to relieve the country and the Government

This language, it must be admitted js explicit

pro"i eti an I °xpediency of establishing a bank, as
ihe best mean^ of exercising these powers and ful-
filling thee duties I agreed then and I agree
now , to the geneial sentiments expressed in th at
sneech, heartily and entirely I would refer to it
oa th s occasion both as an able argument and a
high authority  and beg to adopt it, as setting foith,
Senate.
111 a strong light, the sentiments which I am new
endeavoring to enforce
[Mr Calholn here rose to make an explanation.
He said that he never saw the reporter's note sof
his speech on that occasion, and, therefore, what
he d d say, may not have been what he would
have vaid There were points 01 omission m that
speech which occupied a column and a half of the
National Intelligencer Mr C said, that he took
care, then, a* now, to fortify himself, and leave a
jr road open to oppose, at any coming time, a na-
tional b^nk He then said that he was opposed to
a bank, but that he submitted to the necessity of
the case There was then a connection between
the Government and the banks, and if the Go-
\ernment had a right to regulate the currency,
there was no means of doing it but by a national
bank He had, both then, and since then, contenel-
ed that Government had no right to have any
connection with any banks In his opinion, the
United States Bank (which he then advocated, and
assisted to establish) was not established accoidmg
to the Constitution Congress had no right to
establish such a bank He acted ©ontrary to
his ow n impressions of right Many people may
do things which they do not believe to be lawful,
from necessity     He acted from necessity ]
Mr Webstbr, resuming his remarks, said, he
thought the gentleman had said, formerly, that m
consequence of the decision of the question, he felt
thenceforward, proclueted from opposing the bank
as being unconstitut onal
[Mr Caihoun again explained He (Mi C)
thought the connection betw een Government and
banks was now broken, and that set him at liberty ,
so that now he could oppose what he had then, and
since, earnestly advocated ]
It is not my desire, sir, to hold the gentleman to
a report oflns speech, which he may choose, even
now , to disclaim I have never heard of his dis-
claiming it before, and, even now, sir, I do not
understand him as being desirous oí letractmg or
denjinganv thing contained in the printed report
of his speech, respecting the importance of a uni-
form national currency That topic makes up the
sum anel substance of his w hole speech It was
the topic of the occasion, it was the expiess pur-
pose for which his committee had been raised, and
for the accomplishment of which the whole pro-
ceeding w as gone into It was all currency, cur-
re icy, currency, and whether the gentleman now
think? the law constitutional or unconstitutional,
he can not deny that his own object, and the object
of Congiess, was to furnish a ciiculatmg medium
foi the country And here Again, so unimportant,
relatively, was the mere custoely or deposue of the
public monejs in the bank, that the bi'l as origi-
nally introduced, cop'amed no piovi ion for that
object A section was afterwards mtrotluced, in
Committee of the Whole, 011 my motion piovidmg
for the deposite of the public monejs wi h the bank,
unless the Secretary of the T eisury should, at any
time, otherwise order and dneet, a reservation of
povvet to the Secretaiv, which, as I think, and al-
, iijs have thought, was greatly abused, by the re-
moval of the deposites, 111 1S13
B} refeience to the debates, sir, it will be found
that other inends of Ihe measme followed up the
■ geneial ideas of 'he honoiable gentleman from
South Carjlma, an 1 supponed the bank as a ne-
ce sary agent 01 mstmmenl for establishing anew a
natie 1 al currency for the uses of commerce and
exchange
Tne operation of the jeint resolution of April,
181f, aiued no eloubt, in a proper oegiee, by the
lrstitUm of the bank, and the currency which it
fma shed, flceemipli lied th- great end of the re-
s imption of sp"cie ppyments, and, fur a long p^-
r oil, we ha! no further trouble w ilh the cuirency
And I now proceed to say, s r, tnat the hte Pre-
sident oí the United States has acknowledged this
daty a« often, and as full, and cleaily, as any of
his pice'tacssor^ His various ad millions, or r -
cognitions, of this ob!ihalion, are too recent and tco
