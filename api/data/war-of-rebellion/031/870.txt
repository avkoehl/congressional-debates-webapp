Should the general idea be adopted, these can be thoroughly digested and worked out by the generals and their staffs to whom the execution of the plans is committed.

Very respectfully, your obedient servants,

DECEMBER 20, 1862.

General STOUGHTON,

Commanding Forces at Fairfax Court-House:

A rebel cavalry force, said to be from Manassas, went into Occoquan yesterday afternoon. They captured some wagons, took two of our guides, and fired upon the Seventeenth Pennsylvania Cavalry, on its march to Falmouth. Lieutenant-Colonel Brinton leaves here this morning for the vicinity of Wolf Run Shoals. He will be in command of all my cavalry from the left of Centreville to the Potomac. He will communicate with you, if necessary, and receive any suggestions you may think advisable.

R. BUTLER PRICE,

Colonel, Commanding Cavalry Brigade.

CUMBERLAND, MD., December 20, 1862-9.15 p.m.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

I returned this evening from Hagerstown, where I went to see General Morell, to learn from him the number and location of his troops, but he, unfortunately, had left for Washington. I ordered the Seventh and Eighth Maryland Regiments, near Williamsport, to report without delay to General Kenly, at Harper's Ferry. The cavalry I ordered across the river to Martinsburg, which place we now occupy. The telegraph line is now repaired to that place, and the trains will run there on Monday. All quiet. The enemy has not shown himself for several days. General Milroy sent an expedition yesterday from Moorefield across to Woodstock. Will report as soon as result is known.

B. F. KELLEY,

Brigadier-General.

WASHINGTON, D. C., December 21, 1862-10.30 p.m.

General PARKE,

Headquarters:

Send messenger to Averell, telling him to do all in his power to head Stuart off. He was last heard from about Aldie.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.
