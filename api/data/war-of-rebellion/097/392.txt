[MARCH 31, 1865.-Fort roster of troops operating against Richmond at this date, see Part I, p. 564.]

CITY POINT, VA., April 1, 1865-1 p.m.

Honorable EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

I have had two dispatches from General Grant since my last to you, but they contain little additional, except that General Sheridan also had pretty hot work yesterday; that infantry was sent to his support during the night, and that he (Grant) has not since heard from Sheridan. Mrs. Lincoln has started home, and I will thank you to see that our coachman is at the arsenal wharf at 8 o'clock to-morrow morning, there to wait until she arrives.

A. LINCOLN.

CITY POINT, VA., April 1, 1865-5.30 p.m.

Honorable W. H. SEWARD,

Secretary of State, Fort Monroe:

Dispatch just received, showing that Sheridan, aided by Warren, had, at 2 p.m., pushed the enemy back, so as to retake the Five Forks and bring his own headquarters up to J. Boisseau's. The Five Forks were barricaded by the enemy and carried by Devin's division of cavalry. This part of the enemy seem to now be trying to work along the White Oak road, to join the main force in front of Grant, while Sheridan and Warren are pressing them as closely as possible.

A. LINCOLN.

(Same to Honorable Edwin M. Stanton, Secretary of War.)
