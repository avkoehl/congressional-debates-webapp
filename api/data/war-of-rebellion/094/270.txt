COLONEL: General Grose's brigade are at work. They have felled trees, but the trees would not reach across. General Grose is now making a raft and with every prospect of success. He will probably, almost certainly, have his brigade all across before morning. My troops will all be rationed, as your ordered, before morning. I have just come from the creek, and everything is going as well as possible under the circumstances.

Very respectfully,

NATHAN KIMBALL,

Brigadier-General.

The rebels are making their appearance in front of General Grose. They were not there when he first want down.
