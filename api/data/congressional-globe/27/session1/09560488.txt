informed, would amount to prohibition, and yield not a dollar to
the Government And his correspondent added that there rer
ta nly must be' some oversight in to, as the Government!)! this
tountry could never conten platt so directa tax on printing It
wo ild be to tax the diffusion and di^sem'nation of knowledge
o ^veiykind—apnncipleand an act fit only for tho«e despotic
Ujv mments where the presan a terror ' Now, Mr W well
kn«w that his honorable friend, the chairman of the Committee
oí Wayq and Means, would be the last man m the House to put
a fax. op printing knowingly There was no man in the House
for whom, personally and politically, he had a higher respect.
Tin whose patriotism he would sooner confide He quoted
this letter merely to exemplify the danger of acting on so sweep-
ing a hill without more light
fMr Fii/r\ioRE here explained, and observed that the mam
article employedm the manufacture of type metal, namely, re
guius of antimony, was free from duty
Mr Winthrop Yes, but not type metal itself ihatwaa
not nameaVamong the free artic'ts                       *
Mr Dawson heie interposed and inquired whethei the in
dividual from whom the letter came was a type founder?
Mr Winthoo* replied that he could not himself precisely
pieusely say what his piofe^ion was lie had every íeason,
however, for ere iitmg his testimony ]
A third fact which nod been brought to his no'ice was, that
indigo—of which fiom eleven to twelve hundred thousand dot
i irs' worth was used annually in the manufaciuung establish
rnentsof New Engl md, and which stood at the heal 01 the
li-t of articles wbic i the compromise act itself stipulated
shmil be free after July, 1842—was not contained in the
iree list of this bill, and of course would be subject to a
duty of 20 per cent m direct contribution of what
some gentlemen seemed to regard is an inviolable
compact Now, he knew that the honoiable chiiriran would
inform the House that this waq a mere mistake—a clerical er-
ror, if you please But Mr W'a very purpose in alluding to it
was to prove how extrely liable we were to mike such mis
taires, byactmgso hastily on a measure bO complicated and
extensive If tins bill had passed a week ago, this mistake
might have been irreparable, and lfit passed a week hence, he
Iff It sure that other mistakes would ultimately be discovered no
lesa consi ierable in then charactei
Anotiiei fact which ha 1 been brought to Mr W's notice, te
kted to a little arricie called flaxseed, which gentlemen might
i egard as a very tnfl ng thing to he made the subject ofa speech
He had been furm hed with some statistics on the subject,
howevrs which wind perhaps change then views He was

thutthey had already reduced the puce rf the aiticle to the ron
sumer at least 2j per cent They «sed about seven thousand
tons of the seed a year At least three fourth*! ot this quantity
was imported, and formed a main element in our Calcutta trade
Afertheoil wa« evprebsed, two thirds ot the biilk lemained,
which was exp tried under the name of oilcake for the Hiitish
fauneis to feed their cattle with Touiteen ships, of 500 tona
each, were employed in the impoitation of this seel, of an
amount of tonnige tqual to such a number of ships and halfas
many more in txpouine tht, cake From lo to ,0 000 ions of
chipping all told, coasting tia.de included, were said to be em
ployed in this business alone And this was in aiticle which has
never been so much as named in any of the old tai lfls, and the
business to which it had recently givfn use was probably im
known to every member of the Hou'e That business would
hepiostrated if this bill passed These establishments would
beciushulas efltciually as ihe teed in their own milis, and
without one pnticlp of benefit to the Government Lven the
carg íes of seed now on then way would bo reexported foi

It was to meet cises of this sort as well as to answer other
ends of vastly 1 i^hei impir'ance, tha he had originated the re
solution of lnqnny, which was lost the other day on the motion
to reconsider, after having been reported unanimously by the
Committee on Commeice, and canted in the House by a small
majouty    We needed irfoimation     Eveiy legislative body
oufijht to obtain it befoie acting on any of the great interests of
trade    And there wti probuly, ro legislative body on earth
with so hule mercantile expenence, or practical knowledge
among its membei s, as this House    As he included himself m
tne Fame category of iffnoranc*1 with others he hoped no um
tna^e would be taken at the remark    We held our sessions
away from any of the gieat <u 01 ghfaies of commerce, ata
distance from any active business community    We were out of

They were fewer no pract cal m inn facturéis   He might hive
mistaken theprofe^iors of pome oTns fuend^ but he believed
we were mainly an assembly of lawyeis, accustomed to com.
pare testimony and examine ev dence, and aisueRrmciples,
but iccustomed, also, to have the fans furrished, the evidence
procured, and the witne^e* summoned    He hoppd some ie--u
hi ion to meet this  condition of thm^ might still be adopted
There had been some je tin u^y exhibiré ? the other day as to the
composition of the committee to which such an investigation
should be entrusted    It was wholly groundless    No Speaker
could fail to select an impaitial committee foi such a service—
ceitanly not his honora le luend  who presided so ably and
acceptably o\( 1 tl is Hon t.     The wl ole aun and ertdtft-uch
ir mquiiy would be def lei   weie it not pio ecuted   by an
impai ti*l committee com 1 pctlo1, members of all   parties  ¿ml
fiom a 1 sections    For himself,   he co ild honestly say tbeie
was but one member of the House  whom he was unwilling to

They could thus obtain all the ie venue, without involving so
much injustice to a thousand little manufacturing interests
[Mi Dawson heie asked Mr Winihrop, why he did not

But whenever a duty on tea and coffee was laid it ought to
be a specific duty, and notan ad valorem duty Indeed the
