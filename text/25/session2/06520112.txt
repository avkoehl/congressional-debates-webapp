interest," would seem to indicate taat payment was
intended from othei resources, and not from, the
money to be advanced by the United States Under
the treaty, but that Mr. Meade almost instantly
left Spain, after the award was made, without even
a demand foi payment there, that he came to this
country with the award as the evidence of his
claim, and that the Spanish authorities ever, after
the perfection of the treaty, insisted that the claims
of this individual were, and were intended to be,
embraced under its provisions, would seem pretty
effectually to rebut any presumption that the Spa-
nish Government evpr intended to pay the award,
or that Mr Meade ever expected to receive pay-
ment, in any other way than from the provisions
made m the treaty for the claims of our citizens
A fuither examination of the facts in, the case
will confirm this view of it The treaty was rati-
fied by Spain in October, 1820 Mr Meade was
then m this country, with the award of the Spanish
commission as evidence of his claims, and, as we
shall soon see, contending that the treaty should be
so amended as expressly to exempt them, or to pro-
vide for their instant and entire payment These
facts, connected with the ground constantly assum-
ed by Spam, that the treaty did provide for Mr
Meade's claims, would certainly authorize the in-
ference, without a want of charity to either of the
parties, that the existence of the treaty, in it* un-
finished state, was not disiegaided, when the final
steps were taken for the settlement between them
But to recur again to the argument Mr Meado
solicited, in his memorial to the Pre ident, which
was transmitted to the Senate with the tieaty, that
his claim should be wholly exempted from its ope-
ration, or that an amendment, "by way of rider,"
should be mcorpoiated in the ratification by the
United States, containing a distinct recognition of
his claim, so that it might be specifically piovided
for in the appropriations necessary to carry the
treaty into effect.
As some of ths iriends of the bill found the
claim of Mr Meade against this Government, upon
the ratification of the treaty by the Senate, m open
disregard of these requests oí his, and in its ongi
gmal shape, as signed by the negotiators, he was
bound to give this point a moment's examination
And here, he must ask, what was the state of
things1 What were the relations of the high con-
tracting parties' and what were the public and
private interests involved in the ratification or le-
jection of the treaty?
The history of the period answers all there inqui-
ries. The claims oí our citizens upon Spam tor
spoliations upon our commerce, and other acts,
strictly and only cognizable by the national autho-
rities, were numerous and large The settlement
of those claims, and the security of the most ample
indemnity which could be obtained, was the
imperious duty of our Government towaids lis
suffering citizens A difficulty as to the boundary
between the possessions of the two Governments in
the southwest, had given use to some disturbing
questions, and promised, unless amicably settled,
to be a fruitful source oí discord m future Spam
owned a tract of country between the territories of
the United States and the Gulf of Mexico, which it
was highly desnable to us to own, that we might
push our limits to that natural boundary, and that
we might gain jurisdiction over the ferocious
bands oí savages inhabiting the territory and en-
dangering our border settlements Recent dis-
turbances, and the law of self-preservation and
protection, had compelled Us to carry our arms
into tnat territory in pursuit of the hostile savages,
and this had given use to complaints on the part of
Spam The adjustment of all these difficulties
had been the object of the negotiation which
resulted m the treaty in question, and the treaty, as
made and signed, had settled them all
In nothing did these important matters involve
mere dealings by contract between any of our citi-
zens and the Spanish Government, nor did our Go-
vernment, in making that treaty, pretend to take
jurisdiction of any such dealings, but upon the
appeal, and at the solicitation, of the citizens inte-
rested. This was Mr Meade's case, and he- had
before shown his repeated and express appeals to
the protection of his Government in reference to
this particular treaty.
What, then, was the character of his request
made to the Senate, through the President, and
what might be its influence upon the claims of
other citizens provided for in the treaty, and upon
the public interests of the whole nation?   It might,
and most likely would, if complied with in either
form, by any alteration of the treaty, have defeated
and destroyed the treaty itself.   The ratification of
it in its original shape was reluctantly made on the
part of Spain.   It was not made at all within the
time stipulated m the treaty, and not till many
month? after that time    It was then made without
any change of the instrument from its original
form, and to our Government was left the option
to take  the treaty as it was, or to open again, to
new negotiation, at the pleasure of Spam, all the
important public and private inteiests of which he
had spoken, and which a simple ratification of
that treaty by the Senate would finally, and for
ever, adjust    Could the Senate hesitate'   Ought
they to have hesitated, because an individual, who
held claims against  Spain—claims not such in
their charat ter as to make it the duty of his Go-
vernment to interfere with them, claims such as his
Government hadno rightto interfere withbutupon
his direct solicitation, and which it did interfere
with upon such solicitation, repeatedly made, so far
as there was in fact any interference by this treaty,
claims which, if affected at all by the treaty, were
piovided for in the same manner, by the same
rule, and to the same extent, with the claims oí the
other citizens of the country—had changed the con-
dition of his claims, and theiefore changed his
mind, aitei  the tieaty was signed?   Because that
individual,  not  only after   the treaty had, been
signed, but after it had been solemnly ratified by
Spain, with a full knowledge of the changed con-
dition of his claims, chose to interpose himselj, and
to ask that he should be specially preferred to all
other claimants, or that the final conclusion of the
treaty, and consequently the  indemnities oi five
millions to others, and the great public interests se-
cured by it  should be put at hazard, or wholly de-
feated''   Most certainly not    The Senate would
not have been true to the country, oi to the other
citizens interested in the treaty, if they had, by an
amendment added at the personal ¡solicitation, and
for the sole benefit, of this individual, incurred
even a risk of the final loss of the treaty itseli,
much less, if they had done that under the circum-
stances surrounding this negotiation, and proving
that the other contracting party had most reluc-
tantly consented to the adjustment as it was    The
memorial of Mr Meade was dated on the 8th of
Febiuary, 1821    On the 13th of the same month
ii, together with the tieaty, was communicated by
the President to the Senate, and, on the 19th, the
Senate gave lis advice and consent to the latifica-
tion of the treaty, without alteiationor amendment
He had already said that, m this act, the Senate,in
his judgment, discharged an imperious duty to the
country and its cilizens
Did they, in that act, incur a liability on the part
of our Government in favor of Mr Meade' This
was contended, but upon what foundation' The
chims of Mr Meade either were, or were not, em-
braced within the provisions of the treaty, and pro-
vided for by them If they were embraced and
provided for, they were placed upon a piense equal-
ity with the claims of all other citizens, of whatever
character their claims might be, and surely, as his
claims were not such as entitled him to the protec-
tion of the Government, and that protection, if ex-
tended to him at all, must be so extended as a mat-
ter of favor exclusively, and upon his dfect appli-
cation, he could not expect that a prefeience would
be given to him over those claimants « hose claims
gave them the right to call upon their Government
for protection and indemnity Did he expect, or
even ask, such a preference' No In his first ap-
peal to the Secretary of State for the protection of
his country, made on the 6th of June, 1818, he con-
cludes m these words "being confident that, when-
ever such an event (the conclusion of a treaty) does
take place, provision will be made," for what?
For his whole debt' No, but "for ihe claims of our
citizens,"   What was the language of his second
appeal, made through Mis. Meade, on th£ 17th, of
January, 1819, but one month fee/ore the treaty was
actually signed?.  This appeal concludes with this
language; trusting that, "ire the event of a speedy eoa-
cittsion. of a treaty between our country and Spam,
this document (a statement of his claims, prepared
by Mr. Meade himself, and, by his direction, trans-
mitted to the Secretary of State by Mrs. Meade)
would serve as a guide for that protection, which his
Government may think proper to grunt Aw ."   By
himself then his claims are classed with "the claims
of our citizens" generally, and no preference is ask-
ed or expected, and the protection he demands, or
asks, is "that protection which his Government may
think proper to grant him."   If, then, his claims be
included in, and provided for, by ihe treaty,  they
are placed exactly upon ihe same footing with the
claims of all other citizens, and that was the protec-
tion which he asked, and which his Government
thought proper to grant him     Every thing was'
therefore, done in conformity with his personal ap-
peals and requests, and neither preference, nor pre-
judice, as to him, was expected on his part, or in-
tended on the part of his Government    Up to this
period, then, there is no pretence for a claim on the
part of Mr Meade against the United States, even
upon the assumption that his demands upon Spam
were embraced by the treaty, and Spam thus dis-
charged from them, and, if they were not so em-
braced, most certainly there is no ground of claim,
as it had been seen, and was admitted on all hands,
that the character of the claims were such as to give
him no right to protection, and to make that pro-
tection, it extended at all, a mere favor    The with-
holding it, therefore, could not create a liability, or
lay the foundation for a claim, against our Govern-
ment
If, then, no liability, or foundation, for a claim
i xisted, up to the time that the treaty was ratified
by the Senate, can either be derived from that act?
The treaty was, among other things, one of indem-
nity to our citizens who had claims upon Spam.
Among the most matarial of its provisions were
those securing thi=: personal and individual indem-
nity to our suffering countrymen If Mr Meade
was one of the citizens thus protected, it had been,
already seen that he was so by his own request, as
a matter of mere favor, and upon the same footing
with those claimants, who had a right to appeal to
their Government for protection. Thus all were
placed by the treaty in February, 1819, and with
that condition, neither Mr. Meade, nor any other
claimant, then expressed discontent. No act of
our Government, from that time until February,
1821, changed at all the relations of any of the
parties. Not so, however, with Mr Meade. His
acts, and those of the Spanish Government, had
changed his claims, so far as those two parties
were concerned, from a disputed and unliquidated
balance to a defined and specified amount This
change, however, had taken place months before
the ratification of the treaty by Spain, and yet that
ratification was not made to conform itself to any
changed stale of any of the relations, public or
private, affected by the treaty Still, when that
ratification comes up for action by our authorities,
Mr Meade presents himself, and, upon the ground
of the change which had been produced, as to his
claims, by the co-action of himse'f and the autho-
rities of Spam, claims that the Senate should re-
fuse to ratify the treaty, without special provisions
for his benefit Upon what ground of right could
this claim upon the action of the Senate rest?
That the treaty, so far as Mr Meade and his
claims were concerned, was right in itself, and
strictly conformable to his own requests, at the
time it was signed, has been seen. That our Go-
vernment had made itself a party to no change of
circumstances, either affecting his claim, or any
other interest under the treaty, after its execution
by the negotiators, and before its ratification by the
Senate has also been seen. If, then, the treaty
had been ratified by the two Governments, imme-
diately after its conclusion, no pretence of claim
could have arisen on the part of Mr Meade The
provision for him would have been the same as for
our other citizens, as he requested it should be, and
would have been that protection which his Govern-
ment thought proper to grant him, and the only
