CHARLESTON, February 8, 1864-9 p. m.

Enemy's demonstration at Jacksonville, Fla., indicates intention to cut off our supplies from that quarter. Five thousand State troops in South Carolina and Georgia have just been discharged. Cannot their place be supplied from another source to enable me to send sufficient force to Florida without endangering Charleston and Savannah?

General S. COOPER.

CHARLESTON, February 9, 1864-11.16 a. m.

Have already sent General Finegan, from Savannah, two regiments infantry and one light battery, all I can spare. Am sending Colquitt's brigade form here to Savannah to replace them, and supply place of Georgia State troops lately discharged. Can't a brigade be sent to Florida temporarily form some other department? Our supplies in that State are becoming indispensable. I suppose enemy's movement is a feint to draw troops from South Carolina and Georgia.

Honorable J. A. SEDDON.

CHARLESTON, February 9, 1864-1 p. m.

Enemy from Seabrook Island has driven back advanced pickets on John's Island; must stop part of Colquitt's brigade just leaving for Savannah. I can't guard from here to Florida, including, unless re-enforced temporarily.
