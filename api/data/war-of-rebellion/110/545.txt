Captain MANNING:

Both bridges opposite town are gone. Two small steamers are the only visible means of communication from bank to bank. Granger's corps still occupies the ridge in rear of town.

JEFFERSON DAVIS,

President, Meridian, Miss.:

No reply from General Hood. He is reported much improved. Heavy rains have broken our temporary bridges. Will only result in delay of a forward movement. The enemy suffers the same inconvenience to a greater extent.

His Excellency President DAVIS,

Meridian, Miss.:

After earnest conference I find the feeling and opinion such as to render the object unattainable. Any furtehr pressure in that direction would be injudicious. A field in Richmond, I think, opens the best solution.

The object is unattainable. Perhaps assignment to Richmond presents the best solution.
