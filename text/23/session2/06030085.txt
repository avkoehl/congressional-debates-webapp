Mi GRUNDY said, that the people of the dis-
trict of country alluded to, were already supplied
with the mail But it was proper to say, that the
contracts foi the transpoi tation of it which ex-
isted at the time the act was passed, had not yet
expned, hut aftei they had expired, the loute
would be put in operation m the way prescribed
by thclaw But was it expedient 01 piopei,hem-
quired, to put it in operation when the old con-
tracts had not yet e\pued? There was one thing
which was much to be regiettcd, and that was,
that the transportation of passengeis seemed, in
most places, to have got the upper hand of the
transportaron of the mail, when, in fact, it should
beentnely subordinate and secondary to that ob-
ject The use of post coaches for cauj ing pas-
sengeis, it was true, was \eiy convenient and
desirable, but even tins would be done on the
route alluded to, when the existing contiactshad
expned
Mr BLACK replied, that the honoiable mem
bei from Tennessee was light in saying that the
tiansportation of passengers should be suboidi
nate to that of the mail But he behe\ed that
the old contracts had all expned since the passage
of the act of Congiess establishing the route, and
although there was a mail carried on it, yet the
entue benefits of the law had been lost to that
countiy by the communication not being kept up
directly Letters took an lndnec* couise, some-
times above and sometimes below the route
The motion to print and refer to the Post
Office Committee, was agieed to

February, 1823, and who has made some pi og-
ress m the work, be continued m said seiviee
antil the maps herein dnected to be made out are
completed
Mi WRIGHT expressed a hope that this res
olution might not be pressed this morning It
had not attracted his attention till now, and theie-
fore he was not prepared to vote upon it. A simi
lai íesolution had been passed, he believed, some
years ago, requiring the Secretary of the Treas-
ury to form a similar work to that contemplated
by the resolution, arid some progiess had been
made in it He (Mi W ) desired to inquire
whethei the Secietaiy of the Senate had it in his
power to prepare it, and next, what the piobable
expense would be, he was ignorant of the effect
which the íesolution was calculated to have, and
whether the work was proper to be perfoimed
Mi POINDEXTER said that the resolution
was submitted at the instance of the Committee
on Public Lands It was to furnish a work which
should presenta complete view of all the States
and Temtories in which the public lands weie
situated, as well as of the several surveys and
grants of lands made The Secretary of the
Treasury was not the agent of the Senate, and if
done by the Secretary of the Senate, the expense
of it would form a part of the contingent expense
He had no objection to the leference to the Sec-
retary of the Treasury, but he thought the hon
oiable member [Mi Wright] would percer c the
importance of the resolution, he had no objection
that it should he foi a short time, indeed, he had
rathei it would take that course
The resolution was laid on the table, and, on
motion of Mr. POINDEXTER, it was ordered
to be printed                                             «

IMPROVEMENT OF  THE WABASH RIVER.
The bill making an appropuation for the lm-
piovement of the river Wabash, being under con-
sideration as m Committee of the Whole,
Mr HENDRICKS said that the position he
occupied in relation to the bill now before the
Senate, as well as to former bills on the same
subject, tendered it necessary and proper for him
to say a few words on the piesent occasion, that
duty and inclination alike impelled him to this
course, and that if any apology should be thought
necessary for obtruding himself on the attention
of the Senate, it would be found on the table
of every Senator, in the form of instructions to
himself and his colleague, from the Legislature
of the State they had the honor to lepresent
Th*e accompanied the punted íepoit recently
made by the Committee on Roads and Canals, on
the subject of this bill
It would be lecollected (said Mr H ) that, at
the last session, the bill to improve the navigation
of the Wabash, about which so much has re-
cently been said, here and elsewhere, had been
mtioduced by himself, on leave of the Si inte
