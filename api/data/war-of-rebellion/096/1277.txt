HEADQUARTERS FIRST ARMY CORPS,March 2, 1865.

Major General J. B. KERSHAW,

Commanding Division:

General Longstreet desires you to transfer Bratton's brigade from the right to the left of your line, and move your division to the right so as to occupy the position Bratton now holds. Bratton will thus be brought in contact with his own division, and will again become a part of it.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

O. LATROBE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
