MAJOR: Since my orders of January 2 in relation to our handsome affair near Greenville, I have received the rebel accounts, which concede much more than I claimed.

The Raleigh State Journal says:

The enemy, represented as being 1,000 strong, composed of cavalry, artillery, and infantry, attacked our outpost below Greenville on the south side of the Tar River, and report says that our side suffered severely. Major Moore, of the Third North Carolina Cavalry, is reported killed, and Company g, of his regiment, and Company K, of the Fifty-seventh Virginia, of General Barton's brigade, taken prisoners. One gun of Colonel Starr's old battery was captured.

A later dispatch concedes some 20-odd as their loss.

I have reported the arrival of Major-General Pickett, department commander, at Kinston since the 1st, with re-enforcements of a brigade. Generals Clingman and Barton are also there. The force at Kinston alone is about equal to my whole effective force in North Carolina.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOHN J. PECK,

Major-General.

Major R. S. Davis,

Assistant Adjutant, Department Headquarters.
