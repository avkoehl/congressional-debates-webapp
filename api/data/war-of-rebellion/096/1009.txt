going to South Carolina temporarily. Its wagons, &amp;c., will be left with the division quartermaster. General Field will be instructed to aid you in your picket-line as much as necessary, and General Picket will start a brigade to take Conner's place at daylight. How many horses will transportation be wanted for? I suppose the brigade will carry between 1,700 and 2,000 men.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

O. LATROBE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

A staff officer had better be sent in from the brigade and ahead of it sometime to notify the railroad authorities of its coming.

JANUARY 3, 1865.

General B. BRAGG,

Commanding Department of North Carolina, Wilmington:

Am surprised to hear that Hoke's division is so much in want of shoes. There has been no time within four months past when the wants of the Army of Northern Virginia could not have been fully supplied as to shoes. Major Cameron is authorized to issue shoes to relieve the necessities of Hoke's division, and report the number that Lieutenant-Colonel Corley may be apprised of same.

A. R. LAWTON,

Quartermaster-General.
