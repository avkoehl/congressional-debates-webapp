No. 7. Reports of Major Jeptha Garrard, Third New York Cavalry, of operations December 15-17.

SIR: I have the honor to report that in obedience to orders from Major General Foster I took three companies of the Third New York Cavalry and one section of Jenney's battery Third New York Artillery on the evening of December 15 and marched to White Hall, on the Neuse River. No enemy was found on the south side of the river. The artillery threw eight or ten shells into a skeleton gunboat on the opposite side. Private Butler, of Company C, Third New York Cavalry, volunteered to swim the river and set fire to the boat. He did swim over, though shot at three times, and returned safely. The command then marched to camp.

Very respectfully,

JEPTHA GARRARD,

Major, Third New York Cavalry.

Lieutenant Colonel JOHN MIX,

Commanding Third New York Cavalry.

SIR: I have the honor to report that in obedience to orders from Major General J. G. Foster I marched, on December 16, with two guns of Ransom's battery Twenty-third New York Artillery and five companies of Third New York Cavalry, to Mount Olive Station, on the Goldsborough and Wilmington Railroad, 14 miles below Goldsborough. The railroad was destroyed at this point for about 1 mile. Four miles beyond this point, toward Wilmington, a bridge over the Goshen Swamp was destroyed, and between Mount Olive Station and this bridge the road was torn up and burned in five places.

The object of the march being fully accomplished the command returned to camp.

Very respectfully,

JEPTHA GARRARD,

Major, Third New York Cavalry.

Lieutenant Colonel JOHN MIX,

Commanding Third New York Cavalry.

The bridge was found to be already burned by the enemy. The enemy was found to be in force (artillery and infantry) on the opposite side.
