department, 29,366, and it is not believed the enemy has more than half that number. In view of the limited number of troops at command of the Department, and necessity existing for those in different quarters, the expediency of interposing to compel return of General Anderson's brigade, or of sending corresponding force to you at present, is not perceived. No responsibility justly attaching to the Department or yourself can be avoided by either.

S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General.
HDQRS. DEPT. SOUTH CAROLINA, GEORGIA, AND FLORIDA, Charleston, S. C., October 30, 1973.

Brigadier General R. S. RIPLEY,Commanding First Military District, Charleston, S. C.:

GENERAL: As a boat attack may be anticipated on Fort Sumter after the heavy bombardment which that work has been undergoing for some days, the commanding general directs that all the batteries bearing on it shall be held ready at night to sweep its exterior faces at a concerted signal from Major Elliott, or whensoever the approach of hostile boats shall be evident. Concert of action, however, is most desirable.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

[THOMAS JORDAN,]

Chief of Staff.

I have the honor to state, in reply, that I have had a correspondence with Major Elliott on the subject, and the orders for the batteries within my command have been issued now for some hours.

R. S. RIPLEY,

Brigadier-General.

STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA, EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT, Columbia, October 30, 1863.

General G. T. BEAUREGARD:

GENERAL: In the present condition of affairs, I think it would be well forme to the Rogers' company of mounted men from the coast, and send them to Boykin, in the mountains, provided you can farther extend your cavalry pickets so as to cover the ground now occupied by him.

Very respectfully, yours,

M. L. BONHAM.
