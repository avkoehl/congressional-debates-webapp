wagons, and ammunition train, also, such brigade and division headquarters wagons as your good judgment will permit; one wagon to each should suffice. The balance of the wagons of your division will be parked at Richardsville, where you are now encamped; they will be guarded by your dismounted men, and will move with the balance of the army trains from Richardsville. Your trains will be under the direction of your quartermaster. All the trains of the corps will be in charge of Lieutenant-Colonel Howard, corps quartermaster. General Wilson's division will cross at Germanna Ford at the same time that you cross at Ely's, and as soon as the Fifth Corps reaches the ford will move forward and take position at or near Parker's Store, and will then move forward reconnaissances on the pike toward Orange Court-House as far as Robertson's Tavern, and also on the plank road, Catharpin, Pamunkey, Hope Church, and Ormand's [Almond's] roads. Open communications with General Wilson after crossing the river, and keep them open. The Second Corps will encamp at or near Chancellorsville, the Fifth Corps at Old Wilderness Tavern on the night of the 4th. Cavalry Corps headquarters will be near army headquarters on the night of the 4th instant, and at a point between the Fifth and Sixth Army Corps, on the Germanna plank road, near Old Wilderness. The general directs me to impress on you the absolute necessity of communicating freely with the commanding general of the Second Army Corps, that supports you, and these headquarters.

Lieutenant-Colonel and Chief of Staff.

Brigadier-General GREGG:

Very respectfully,
