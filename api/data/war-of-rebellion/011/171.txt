will undoubtedly remain at Corinth to give us battle. Re-enforcements are coming rapidly to them. Pope's column will be ready to march in thirty minutes, and will reach the enemy's line about noon. Weather clear.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

Forces all back in camp. We had 3 men killed and several wounded; drove the enemy within their works at Corinth, and obtained some information of value in regard to their defenses. I presume the several divisions of the army will move up close to Corinth tomorrow.

Be prepared to cover the retreat of General Pope's reconnoitering party if it should be driven back and pursued.

POPE'S HEADQUARTERS,

May 8, 1862.

Major-General HALLECK:

The enemy's skirmishers have commenced to drive in our pickets beyond Farmington, and from reports are approaching in some force. I will advise you further very soon. I presume it is only a demonstration on the town. I have a brigade and battery on the other side of the creek to support the pickets.

JNumbers POPE,

Major-General.

MONTEREY,

May 8, 1862-11 a. m.

General POPE:

Avoid any general engagement. I can get no reply from General Buell, and he may not have received my orders to support you.

Sherman's movement on the right shows enemy to be in force.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General.
