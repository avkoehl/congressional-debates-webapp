the citizens presented by a delegation sent to me they were yesterday relieved from the penalty. The force under Martin Green has been driven into the northern part of Adair County. Colonels Moore and Bussey from the east and 550 men and two pieces of artillery from the south are moving upon him and will probably unite to-day in the immediate vicinity of his camp. No doubt his forces will disperse as has been usual. No surprises are possible in a country where all the inhabitants are willing to warn if not to assist such parties. With these exceptions all is quiet in North Missouri as reported to me by the committees of public safety appointed in conformity to General Orders, Numbers 3. That order seems to have united all responsible persons who have anything to lose in efforts to preserve the peace and they have organized for that purpose. If any skirmishing is done it will be done by the people themselves who are abundantly able to protect themselves and who have a motive to do so which they had not before. Of course they wish troops sent to do this service as it will save them the necessity of personal exertion, but I think it best that they should do the work themselves where it can be done.

Both railroads are undisturbed since the penalty inflicted in Marion County. Of course there is much excitement and uneasiness among the people since the affair at Springfield but I think from the best information I can get that it will result in no disturbance of moment.

Captain J. C. KELTON, Assistant Adjutant-General.

CAPTAIN: I have this moment received telegraphic dispatch from General Hurlbut stating that the train carrying the force which has been quartered upon the county of Marion to Hudson City was fired upon as it left Palmyra and again at Hunnewell, the western edge of the same county. One man of the Sixteenth Illinois Volunteers was killed and another wounded. The train was halted and the rebels dispersed with loss of five of their number killed. This county of Marion has been the principal seat of the disturbances in North Missouri, and it is my purpose immediately to inflict such punishment as will be remembered.
