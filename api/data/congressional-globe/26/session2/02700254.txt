(page 669,) though haying officers, and making offi
eerss, almost without number And Justice Story
adds, in respect' to grants of power to State officers
or to contracts, relative to iheir offices," &c.
(pages 693 and 694 ) "When the Legislature
makes la contract with a public officer, as m the
case of a stipulated salary /or his services during
a limited period, this, during the limited period, is
just as much a contract within the purview of the
constitutional provision as a like contract would
be between two private citizens "
Yet the Senator from North Carolina contends
that the Senate, though it constantly appoints offi
cers, and helps to fix their salaries, cannot enter into
any contract, or be m any way a party to any
contract. And th« Senator from South Carolina
[Mr Preston] is understood to contend that there
can be no contract with a person elected Again,
Justice Story says "Many dignities and offices, ex-
isting at common law, are merely honorary and
without profit, and sometimes are onerous Yet a
grant to them has never been supposed the less a
contract on that account " (page 699.)
But how much more is such an omcer a con-
tractor, if a grant of privilege to print, etc is made
to him, and the party to be protected as hi Iding
rights under a contrcct, if he possess a private bene
ficial interest in the duties attached to the station,
and if large amounts of property are to beheld,
procured, and delivered under the contradi, as m the
present case, and for a Vmted period, and at certain
price*. The judge add- also, "in respect to
franchiees, whi tliei corporate or not, which m
elude a permanency of pri fits, such asa tight of
fishing or to hold a feiry, a market or a fair, or to
erect a turnpike, bank or budge, there is no pre
tenee to say the grants of ihem are not wi Inn the
Constitution," (page 699 ) That is, there is no
pretence they are net contract*, or do not involve
the rights and duties of a contract
1 quote the remarks to gentlemen on the other
side, that they may call to mm I what has been de
cided, and «aid m the lushest judienl tribunal of
the country on point- anahgou   to that in d spute
here, and how they have diffirul from their pre
sent position
It will thus be seen, that, m the r pinion of such
a tribunal, officers may he elected <r appointed,
and still hate rights under thur offices, and under
grants which are in the nature of a cintrad, which
no legislative power can Ian tally impair
In the «ame case, it is held, as has been quoted,
that bank charters possj s a like character oí a
contract, and, in 1813, on the removal of the
deposites, to which the gentleman from South Ca-
rolina [Mr Calhoun] tus referred, it wasne t denied,
by the then Administration, that the chaitei gave
certain right  in the nature oí a contrae, but, the
question was merely concerning the extent and limi-
tations of the contrac i'hc Opposition, at that
time, concluded, that the inb,taiitt of the contract
prohibited the removal of the deposites unlt-s first
ascertained to be un-aie in the vanli  of the Bank
The Executive contended thete was no such limi-
tation or qualification, *becau e the charter itself
expressly provided "that the deposites of the money
of the United Slat?s in places in which the said
Bank aDd the branches thereof may be established,
shall be made m «aid Bank or the branches thereof,
unless the Secretary ot the Treasury -hall, at any
time, otherwise order and direct," iiU (set lion
16 h ) The Secretary did "otheiwise order and di
lect," and, consequently, according to t! e views i f
the Executive, conformed to the contiact, instad
of violating it by removing the depo«i es
In the prrs-nt case, the other indica ions of a
contract, beyond all which has yet leen stated, are
decisive There not only always •was a cot tract,
and nothing but a ct n rau, before 1819, but always
since has there been a contr ict, not a mere bond to
perform a naked public trust, as in tases of mere
officer , but a bond to comply «win the particulars
of the joint re-olution, artl ¡hus to furni-h certain
materials, of paper and ink which equal in value
nearly half the stipulated pnce o be pan? ft r the
whole work No such conuact or ergafcement
exists with most other officers, and none such wuh
mere officers In this case, the law on the om?
side, and the bond on the other, make it a part of
the contract on the one side, that they shall furnish
these materials during a limited period, which is
one of the te«ts of a contract by Justice Story, that
is, for two years, or the next Congre«s, as well as
to perform the labor, and provide a fixed capital,
necessary to do the work promptly, in types,
pres-es, etc This capital equals thirty or forty
thousand dollars
Again- on the other side, it is v.rtually engaged,
as a consideration for this bond, that they shall
have the work for a definite time, that they shall
be paid a stipulated price for the work, during that
stipulated time Thu makes it exactly, through-
out, one of the case  adduced in the Supreme
Court, to lllu-tra e what is^ a contract, in the ca«e
of certain officer  Couple these consideration*
with other', before mentioned in this debate, that
these Printers are designated to furnish the mate-
rials, and do the duties as a firm, and not as indi-
viduals, showing the business character ot the
case, that they are proposed in this very resolution
to be dismissed as a firm, and not Mr Biair alone—
who «eemi alone to be objectionable—that they
cannot re-ign without our con ent, which is the
case with no mere officers—th it they have given,
and the law requires them to givt, bonds, not to dj
the duties of an officer, but "for the prompt, accu-
rate, and neat execution of the work " And the
who'e undertaking comes as clearly, as any case on
record, within the form, as well as substance, not only
of definitions, b it of decisions, in íespect to contracts
Sound common sense, and ímmemoaal usage,
cannot, in my opinion, justify any other view of
thesubjett No scholastic subtlety can long be-
wilder ti h>r this body or the community as to the
reí) e-sence ot the transaction However party
feeling may insensibly waip s< me of us for a time,
and it may all of us—however sudltn nutation
may have provoked and rendered plausible the ex-
pression of doubtful opinions—however any Sena
tor may, in his ¿■•al to serve others and the public,
indulge in eloquent indignation at «upposed vice—
and however all this, undei human frailty, may
make some feel power and forget right, without
any motive existing actually to violate vested
rights, jet the «crutmy of free di-cusuon and of
time will dispel ill delusion All attacks on pri-
va r charters and coutracts have a revolutionary
tendency, and one of the sage- ot '76 is depicted
as holding up to the world's abhorrence various
encroachment^ and, among them, a broken char
ter, and olher lawless acts of ministerial power
Reactions wni ome Truth must follow after

sion, though committed on the humblest individual
An emanation from Deity himself is constantly at
work in. the human heart to correct evil, to bung
back erring man from wrong, and to do justice to
the aggrieved, however late
In closing, allow me to invite you, before you
vote for the present resolution, to look <it a few
ca-es of the operations of such a feeling and prin-
ciple in man, and especially m relation to this for-
midable class m si ciety, composed of those con-
nected wuh the public press.
In our provincial weakness as colóme , a practi-
cal printer,* once as their agent, stood before the
assembled power of an English Parliament Though
faithful to hi- arduous tiust, he was stigmatised by
the reckless Weddeibumes of that day as a libeller,
and guilty of various other high crimes and misde-
meanors, which it is not nece -ary here to repeat
The petition- ne p'e-ented were trampled in. the
dust—the pnyers of his constituents rejected with
«com—and the proscribed and insulted ag nt wa¡,

my He at once devoted all hi* energies to the
causu, and did more, perhaps, by his pen, tongue,
and the press, than any other individual, to prepare
us for the coming crisis What was the terminat oh
of the outrage? A few years after the «ame punter
appeared at the «ame court as the representa-
tive of thirteen free, independent, and sovereign

name to the treaty of peace, in which his oppo-
nents virtually acknowledged the wrongs they had
inflicted, and the sacred rights we had claimed.
But nearer home, m this very body, withm the re-
collection of many of us, and deeply so of myself,
a printer from my native State,t when nominated to
office,was rejected, principally, it is apprehended, on
the ground ol a supposed libel published some years *
previously. I then believed, and still do, that he
was impo<ed on by others as to the facts of the
ca e, and that no express mabce existed, sor any
intentional wrong was designed to any one. But
the blood was up even in this grave assemblage.
Reason was, in some degree, blinded and stifled by
honest indignation, at what was considered licen-
tiousness ot the press, and, without trial or con-
viction in the courts of law, and with a private life
of great purity, an untiring industry, and singular
clearness of intellect, he was driven from his sub-
ordinate office in apparent disgrace Only one brief
year afterward1; what did we behold of returning
justice and popular indemnity' This same printer
i  sent here as the representa ive of a sovereign
State, to sit and act by ihe sids of those who had
rejected him and is soon afterwards exalted still
further, by his elevation to the chair of its Chief
Magis'racy
One olher illustration, and I have done
In the case of John Wilkes, known wherever
popular liberty is kaown, and the particulars of
which need not, therefore, be detailed, hi  papers
were seized by the minions of power, under a gene-
ral search-warrant, because he had caused to be
printed what were considered libels Tne com-
munity looked to the outrage by such a seizure on
him and his papers, a!]c¡ his domestic sanctuary,
rather thin to the individual guilt or innocence.
They regarded the oppression, rather than the cha-
racter, of the intended victim of ministerial usur-
piuon. To evinc  their indignation at the profli-
gate invasion of his rights they at orce elected
him to the House of Commons From that House
he was expelled (or dismissed, as this resolution
would term it) by the pliant supporters of that
ministry This was a second outrage, not much
less fhgrait than the first, and the people again
returned him there by acclamation. Yea, more—
the friends of liberty, of law, and the sacied rights
of property and drmestic exemption from inquisi-
torial seaicn warrants, caused the record ot his
expulsion to be expunged It stands expunged to
the present day, and I may venture to predict it
will continue to stand expunged, till free principles
themselves shall be expelled from the birthplace of
our fathers
In referring to this case, do I justify the conduct
of Wilkes, m m^ny respects' or do I undertake
officially to decide on any general imputations, cast
m debate, on the present Printer ? Par from it.
This seems to me not to be the proper time or pro-
per stage in the proceedings for thatpurpose They
will ably vindicate themselves I have no doubt,
when notified of any specific charges and allowed
to defend themselves against accusations like other
free citizens in a free country, before they are con-
demned.
But Junius justly said of Wilkes, whatever may
have been his character, it was, ma public view, the
precedent and the principle, and not his character,
which was most involved Like Pame, during the
Revolution, our faihers looked to his politics, rather
than to hi  infidelity, and Mr Jefferson afterwards
generously protected him for his political rather
than religious principles Hence, Junius proceded
further, and observed as to Wilkes, if he had vices,
his very vices pleaded for him in such a case, be-
cause they were made an apology by others for an
^ct of oppression Thus, (Letter 11th ) ' But, let
Mr Wilkes's character be what it may, this at
least is certain, that circumstanced as he is, with
regard to the public, even his vices plead for him.
The people ot England have too much discernment
to suffer yc ur Grace to lake advantage of the fail-
ings of a private character to establish a p-ecedent
by which the public liberty is affected, and whieh
you may hereafter with equal ease and justification
employ to the rum of the best man in the kingdom "
