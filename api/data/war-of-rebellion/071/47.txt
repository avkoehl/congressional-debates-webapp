General B. F. KELLEY:

A deserter says Early is in command of Ewell's corps, and also Breckinridge has command of corps. They had when he left Staunton about 20,000 infantry, 10,000 cavalry, and 60 pieces of artillery. He said they all moved down the Valley to make a raid on Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. His major told him they were going there.

Colonel HOY,

New Creek:

Patteron's Creek has just been occupied by the enemy. I had withdrawn the company to North Branch bridge. I presume it is McNeill's company. When will Colonel Stevenson probably reach New Creek? Captain Faris, from Altamont, will report to you to-night.
