and other arms. He may send troops farther, but the Vicksburg move may require all the river force.

If the rivers obstruct eastern movement, come round them.

HEADQUARTERS, Houston, Mo., January 24, 1863.

Colonel N. P. CHIPMAN,Chief of Staff, Saint Louis, Mo.:

COLONEL: The order of the general commanding which refers to paroling officers, dated January 6, did not reach me until the evening of January 20. All of my action with the prisoners at Hartville was taken, therefore, before the reception of the order. Twenty-seven prisoners were sent from Lebanon to Rolla, and 69, including 2 captains and 2 lieutenants, to Hartville. General Davidson sent Major Lippert, of his staff, to communicate with my yesterday. I wait his further orders. The roads are said to be absolutely impassable for transportation. On receipt of your order to move on Monday last, I sent a courier to Rolla to hurry forward my transportation, but yesterday it had not moved. I am anxious and impatient to move, but I am helpless at this time. I could send forward part of the command, but as you have ordered me to keep it together, I shall not separate it.

I am informed that Colonel Glover is anxious to have the six companies of his regiment now with me ordered back to Rolla. You may not be aware that a portion of these soldiers are from Illinois. There is not a good feeling between that part of the command and the Missouri contingent. Those with me are averse to going back, and I should be very sorry to loss them. I have drilled and disciplined them into good soldiers.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

FITZ HENRY WARREN,

Brigadier-General.

[DEPARTMENT OF THE MISSOURI,] January 24, 1863.

General WARREN, Houston:

If you have not moved forward as ordered on the 19th, you will turn over the command to next in rank, fall back to Rolla yourself, and explain your neglect of orders. If the force has not moved, the Second Missouri Artillery will remain.

SAML. R. CURTIS,

Major-General.

[DEPARTMENT OF THE MISSOURI,] January 24, 1863.

Colonel W. M. STONE, Rolla:

Move your regiment forward toward Houston. If, when you get to Salem or Houston, you find you are not likely to overtake the Warren forces, halt and await further orders. I telegraph to relieve General Warren. I cannot perceive why he should so long delay his march.

SAML. R. CURTIS,

Major-General.
