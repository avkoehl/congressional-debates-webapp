III. General Cox will cross the river at Turner's this morning and advance toward Raleigh on the road between Swift Creek and Middle Creek, unless the latter be occupied by General Slocum's troops, in which case General Cox will take the next road to the left. General Terry will continue his march toward Raleigh, taking the next practicable road to General Cox, and will communicate with the commanding general at the head of General Cox's column by all cross-roads. Each corps will take with it about six days' supply of bread, sugar, and coffee, in wagons; other supply trains will be left at Turner's Bridge until further orders; a strong regiment will be left with the train of each corps. The pontoon bridge will remain at Turner's until further orders.

By command of Major-General Schofield:

Lieutenant-Colonel and Assistant Adjutant-General.

Major General J. D. COX,

Commanding Twenty-third Army Corps:

GENERAL: You may resume your march at 6 o'clock in the morning, turning toward Raleigh when you strike the Raleigh road. I cannot give you more definite instructions until I hear from General Sherman, which will probably be near morning. General Terry has not quite reached the Raleigh road and reports the enemy in his front intrenched, what or how strong he does not know. I have directed him to turn this way on reaching the Raleigh road.

Yours, truly,

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.
