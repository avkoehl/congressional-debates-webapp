APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
Indian Hostilities—Mr. Hayne
May, 1S38.
H. of Reps.
leave to the adversaries of Georgia, and defy them
to answer Let moralists say what they will, it
does not become the people el this country, espe-
cially those of the older States, to arraign the
course of Georgia on this subject. Well might «he
say to them, "Let him who is without sin fir=t c?st
a stone at me " Tn 1828 and 1829, the exten to
which Georgia carried her authority over the Che-
rokees, was to protect such ol that people as mighl
desire to emigrate from the barbarous inflictions, oí
(he laws of the tribe In 1830, a Cherokee by the
name of Tassels committed murder upon, one of his
own countrymen, for which he was arraigned be-
fore the superior court of Hall county for trial,
and upon solemn inquest was found guilty of mur-
der I might heie show that it was far better, on
the ground of humanity, tor an Indian to be tried
by the white man's law than by the liw of the
Indian, by the Anglo Saxon institutions than
the bloody code of his own countrymen , by that
law which not only requires proof of the fact of
lulling, but which require  to be brought home to
the culprit malice aforethought, express or implied
But Georgia was not permitted to proceed quietly
in the exeicise of her jurisdiction over this Ihdian
murderer. A hue-and-cry was raised against hei
throughout the whole length and breadth of the
land, and the power of the Supreme Court of the
United States was invoked to arrest his execution,
and to take him away from her authority A
citation was served upon the Governor of Georgia,
and upon the judge before whom the murderer had
been been tr'ed and convicted, and because the
authorities of the State went on to execute Tassels
in conformity with his sentence, Georgia was ac-
cused ol braving and defying the authority of the
United States I may say here, before I proceed
further with the narrative ot the contest between
Georgia and the Cherokees, that in the case oí
Tassels there was no haste to execute the sentence
of the law. On the contrary, the day of execution
was made so distant as to enable the unfortunate
convict and his friends to invoke Executive clemen-
cy for a respite, and to memorialize the Legislature
ior a pardon. No mitigating circumstances being
shown, the pardon was refused, and he was exe-
cuted But even according to the doctrine con-
tended for, that the Supreme Court had appellaie
jurisdiction over the case, under what obligations
did Georgia stand to obey the citation of that tri-
bunal? How she braved the authority of thp Su-
preme Court, w 11 be seen by refening to the deci-
sion of the late Chief Justice Marshall, in the case
of Cohens against the State of Virginia In con-
sulting what a citation is, Judge Marshall says
' And what is i citationi It is simply notice to the opposite
party that the recoul is tiansfencd to anothei comt, wheie he
may ipjcn oi decline to appeir, ts lnyju Igment oí inclina
Hon may detormme As the party who lias obuim d the ju ig
mentis out of comt, and may therefoienot know tint hti cauie
is temoved, common justice requires that notice ol the I ict
should be given to him Butthisnolico it not a suit vioi has it
the effect of process If the p irty d íes n it ch lose to appear
he cannot be biought into couK not is his falluie to appear
consldeied as a deiault
Sir, if a citation is neither suit nor process
against an individual, I should like to know how
it can be so against a State' Such an idea would
be preposterous in the extreme
To show, still further, that n was the ques-
tion of jurisdiction alone which was in controver
sy, and not the mode of its e xercise, it is only ne-
cessary to refer to the celebrated Cherokee chancery
bill against the State of Georgia, which was argued
before, and determined by, the Supreme Court, at
its session in 1831 That bill denied entirely the
jurisdiction of Georgia over the Cherokees, and
prayed the Court to enjoin that State against the
future exercise of such jurisdiction And what
was the'decision of the Court,as delivered m March,
1831' We shall learn from the following extract
from its decision, delivered by Chief Justice Mar-
shall himself.
In delivering the opinion of the Court,Clncf Justice Marshall
observes ' The Court has bestowed its best at ention on this
question and, after matute deliberation the majonty is of
opinion that an Indian tribe or nation within the United Staes,
is nota foreign State m the sense of the Constitution, and can
not maintain an action in the courts ot the United States         *
* "A serious additional objection exists to the pi
risdiction of the Court Is the matter oí the bill the proper sub
ject for inquiry and decision"! It seeks to restrain a State fiom
the forcible exercise of legislative power over a neighboring
people asserting ..heir independence, their right to winch the
Slate denies On the several matters alleged in the bill, (for
example, on the laws rriaking It criminal to exercise the usual
powers of self government m their own country By the Chero
kee nation) this Court cannot interpon, at least in the form in
which these matters are presented >'
In reference to thejunsdiction of Geoigia ovei the possession
ol lands by the Cherokees, Chief Justice Mai-.hall says "The
mere question of right might, peihaps be decided by this Court
in a propel case, with propci parlies but the Court is asked to
do mole than to decide on the title The bill requites us to con
trol the legislation «f Georgia, and to restrain the exercise of its
t hysical force The propriety of such an interposition by the
Comt may be well questioned It savois too much ofthe exer
cise t f political power to be within the proper province of the
judicial department "
In the closing paragraph ofthe opinion of the Couit it is oh
set ved ' U it be true that the Cherokee nation have rights this
is not thotiibunal m which tlle'e lights aie to be asserted If
i be ti ut. tha wiongs have been inflicted, and that still greater
ateto be apprehended, this is tlrt thetiibunal which can íedress
the past ol pi event the futuic "
"The motion for an injunction is denied "
It is very remarkable that, after pronouncing
such an opinion as this, disclaiming jurisdiction,
and that too for the reason that its exercise would
savor too much of the exercise of political power,
in one short year, the Supreme Court of the United
States should have attempted to arrest the jurisdic-
tion of Gesrgia over one of her own citizens, resi-
ding in the country occupied by the Cherokees,
and still moie so that the Court should have sought
to justify it, by assuming the individual to be the
citizen of a State some eight or ten hundred miles
off, when he had a permanent residence within the
limits of Georgia.
If ever there was an attempt by a judicial tribu-
nal in thib country to usurp power not belonging to
the Government of which it was a member, that
attempt was made by the Supreme Court in the
case of Worcester and Butler against the State of
Georgia, an attempt which, I venture to predict,
will never be renewed by that Court against any
member of this Union
The State of Georgia, in the progress of her
legislation for the purpose of extending her juris-
diction over the Cherokees, organized counties,
and established her civil and other authorities
within them. In 1831 the Legislature oí the State
went the whole extent of the doctrine contained m
the extract from the Plymouth speech which was
read at the commencement of my remarks, by
surveying and apportioning the waste lands in the
Cherokee country among her own people, securing
the Indians in the possession of such portions as
were occupied and improved by them.
There is, m connection with the legislation of
Georgia, and the course of the pnncipal chief of
the Cherokees, one important circumstance which
has not yet been brought to the notice of
the committee I have said, the Legislature of
Georgia had determined to take possession of
the country, subject to the principle of In-
dian occupancy, to which I have already ad
verted, and I will now say, that, up to the 25th
of May, 1838, the Cherokees were protected in the
possession of the improvements occupied by them
to the extent of from one hundred and twenty to one
hundred and sixty acres, lo each head of an occu-
pant family This was the state of the case be-
tween Georgia and the Cherokees, when the dele-
gation, at the head of which was John Eoss, urged
upon the Executive of the United States to submit
the valuation of all the lands occupied by them east of
the Mississippi, to the decision of the Senate, as has
been shown by more than one gentleman who has
already addressed the committee, and most particu-
larly by the gentleman irom North Carolina [Mr
Graham ]
In February, 1835, that delegation, clothed, as I
believe, with the whole power of their tribe, being
essentially its Government—for I consider John
Ross as the impersonation and embodiment of Che-
rokee power and Cherokee will—through the Se-
cretary of War, proposed to submit the question of
the valuation of their land to the Senate of the
United States, pledging themselves to use their ef-
forts to induce their people to accept the award
That award was made, and the committee have al-
ready been told, that when the delegation was
urged to enter into stipulations on the basis of five
millions of dollars awarded by the Senate, their own
especial umpire, they then for the first time disco-
vered that they had no power to enter into such sti-
pulations. They could not treat at Washington,
but must tieat in the Cherokee nation-   Pending
the transaction, after the question had been sub-
mitted to the Senate ofthe United States, after that
body had awarded five millions of dollars as an
ample indemnity to the Eastern Cherokees as the
price of their removal to the West, a very short
time before the proposed meeting of the Com-
missioners of the United States with Ross and his
people in their country, for the purpose of there
consummating the award of the Senate, while the
Cherokees were still under the protection of the
laws of Georgia for an indefinite time, John Ross
and his council transmitted to the Governor of
Georgia a communication, a copy of which I will
ask the Clerk to lead.
The Clerk read the following'
Council Ground or the Cherokee Nation,
Red Clay, October 26, 1836
Sm The undersigned, thepiincipal Chief, the assistant pun
cipal Chief, the Committee, and Council of the Cherokee
nation, trust you will appreciate the purity of their motives foi
thus addressing you You aie aware of the distressing sltua
tion in which our country stands We are the earliei posset
sors ofthe soil, which we yet retain, but where events, which
we have have had no share whatevei in producing, surround
us with all the anxieties and privations ol wal, although m a
perlect state of peace
Various attempts have been made to airange our difficulties,
and upon conditions which may satisfy the people We ha\ e
been misrepresented, we have betn slandered The General
Government of the United Slates has been swayed by agents
of its own, who do not enter into the feelings of our nation,
and who adopt a course in reference to it which has made the
nation distrustful The Cherokees will only put faith m those
whose devotedness to them has been tried They hav e ap
pointed a delegation to settle their difficulties To accomplish
this, they have invested that delegation with the fullest powers
If souices of mitation are now avoided, we doubt not all will
be accomplished which can be desired on the close of the pre
sent session of Congress, should we not greatly misapprehend
the feelings ofthe General Government
Under these circumstances, we have thought it due to our
selves, to you, to the united States, to the interest of humanity
to make this representation, and to ask that you will submit it
the Legislature, of which you are the head, and, in submitting
it, that you will entreat the Legislature, whatever they may
have had the purpose of doing regarding those pouions of our
nation which bordei on then possessions to abstain, at any
rate until this negotiation shall be completed, horn passing any
law, ofsanctioning any proceedings, which may furthei haiass
a people so deeply galled that a renewal ol irritating measures
at a moment so critical, might entirely defeat the objects of
thohe who have nothing at heait but the peace and happiness
of their own countrymen, and a permanent friendship with
yours
We have the honor to be, sir,
Your Excellency R most ob'tseivants,

To his Excellency the Governor of the State of Georgia
I stated, Mr Chairman, that at the time this
communication was made to the Governor of
Georgia, the Cherokee Indians were secured, for
an indefinite period, in the possession oí their im-
piovements m Georgia, to the extent of one hun-
dred and twenty to one hundred and sixty acres of
land for each family. Therefore, there could have
been no motive on the part ofthe State ot Georgia
to have changed hervlegislation on the subject, un
less it was intended to bring this matter to a close
But, acting on this pledge from John Ross, the Le-
gislature, in November thereafter, passed an act
securing Indian occupants in their possessions
until November or December, 1836, reserving to
the State the power still further to extend then
right of occupancy John Ross and his Council
stated to the Governor of Georgia, that, relying on
the disposition of the Executive of the United
States, not starting any difficulty in relation to the
award of their own umpire, the Senate of the
United States, but leaving Georgia to act on the
clear, distinct, and unquestionable presumption
that they would carry out that award by the neces-
