General CHALMERS:

Just received dispatch from Vaughan's Station that only a few marines, with eight field pieces, on transports. Just learned that Colonel [S. W.] Ferguson is below Greenwood with 500 men. Four large steamers sunk there to obstruct river. Captain Brown, of navy, with 150 artillerists there; [has] up two heavy guns. Had I not better await further developments and organize battalion? Answer immediately.
