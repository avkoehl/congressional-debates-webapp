t7TH Con&"««1st Sess.   *                                    Public Lands—Mr. Calhoun.                                                                     Senate.
tween those who live by their own means and m- -
dustry, and those who live 01 expect to live on the
public crib—woujd add greatly to that discord and
strife within, and weakness without, which is ne-
cessarily consequent on the entire system oí meas-
ures of winch it forms a part
But its mischievous effects on the extenor rela
tions of the country would not be limited to us in
direct consequences There it would strike a di
rect and deadly blow, by withdrawing entirely
from the defences of the country one ol the only
two sources of our revenue, and that much the
most permanent and growing- [i is now m the
power of Congiess to pledge permanent!j this great
and increasing fund to that important object—to
completing the system of fortifications, andbutlding,
equipping, and maintaining a gallant navj It
was proposed to strike out the whole bill, to ex-
punge the detestable project of distribution , and to
substitute m its place the icvenue fiom the public
lands, as a permanent fund, sacred to the defences
of the country And from -«hit quarter did this
patriotic and trulv statesmanlike proposition come i
From the far and gallant west, from a Senator
(Mr Linn) ol a State the most remote from the
ocean, and secure from danger And by whom
was 11 voted down1 Strange to tell, by bcnatois
from maritime Siatcs—Sutes most exposed, and
having the deepest inteiest m the i leisure defeated
by their repreoeiilativ es on this flor i Wonderful
as it may seem, Louisiana, Mississippi, Georgia,
and South Caiolma, each ga e a vote against it
North Carolina, Virginia Maryland, Delaware,
and New Jerscv, gave each two \otes against it
New York gave one and eveiy vote from New
England, but two from New Hampshire and one
irom Maine,was castagamstit Beit remembere I
in all alter times, that these votes irom States so
exposed, and having so r^:ep a stake in the defence
oí the countiy, were cast in favor of distribution—
oí giving gratuitously a large portion of the fund
from the public domain to wealthy British capita)
i-.ts, and against the pioposition ior appljmg it per
manentlv to the saciad purpose of deienc'mg their
own shores Irom insult and dangei How strange
that New York and New England, with their hun
dreds of millions of property, and so many thous
ands of hardy and enterprising sailois annual!}
afloat, should gne so large a vole for a measuie
above all others best calculated to withdraw pro
tection from both, and «o small <i vole igainst one
best calculated to afford them piotection ' Bat,
«¡range as that may be, it is still more stiangc that
the staple States,—the States that will leceivc so
little from distribution, and wmch must pay so
much to make up the deficiency it will cause-
States so defenceless on the.r maritime fiontier—
should cast so large a vote for their own oppres
sion, and against their ov n defence' Can folly,
can party infatuation, be the cause one or both, go •
further1
Let me say to the benatois from the comnieieial
and navigating States, ]n all súbeme s, that there
is now a wirm and generous feeling cliffu eel
throughout the entne Union m favo i of the aim
of defence with which jour inteiest andgloiyare
so closely identified Is it w ise by any act of} oui s
to weaken 01 ahenale such íeelmgs i AndfOUid
you do an act more duectly calculated to doso'i
Remembei, it is a deep punciple ol om nature not
to regard the safety oí those who do not legarel
their own II jon are indifferent to jour own
safety, jou must not be surprise 1 if those, less n-
terested should become still more so
But as much as die deiences of the co mtry w ould
be weakened etiiecilj bj the x ithdiawal oí solaige
a fund, the blow would be by no means so heavy
as that which, in its consciences woi Id fall on
them. That would paialvzc the light aim of our
power 'Io undeistand fully how it would hate
that effect, we must look not only to the amount of
the sum to be withdrawn, but a'so on what the bur-
den would fall to make up the deficiency It w ould
fall on the commerce of the countrj, exactly where
it would do most to cupple the medí s ol defence
To illustrate the truth of what I sla < it will be
necessary to inquire what would be mi best svs
tern of defen-e And that woul 1 involve ll e prioi
question —from what quarter are we most exposed
todanger'    With that,I shall accordingly begin
There is but one nation on the globe fro n which
we have anything serious to apprehend, but lint
is the most powerful that non exists, or evei did
exist I refet to Great Britain She is in effect
our near neighbor, though the wide Atlantic di
vides us Her colonial possessions stretch along \
the whole extent of our eastern and northern bor-
ders, from the Atlantic to the Pacific ocean Her
power and influence extend oxer the numerous
Indian tribes scattered along our western border,
from our nor hem boundary to the infant republic
of Texas But it is on out maritime frontier, ex-
tending from the mouth of the Sabine to that of St
Croix—a distance, with the undulations of the
coas', of thousands of miles, deeply indented with
bays and navigable rivers, and studded with our
great commercial emporiums ,—it is there, on that
long line oí fiontier, that she is the most powerful,
and we the weakest and most vulnerable It is
there she stands íeadv, with her powerful na/y,
sheltered in the commanding positions of Halifax,
Bet muda, and the Bahamas, to strike a blow at
any i oint she maj select on this long line of coast
Such is ihe quarter from wInch onlj w e hat e da i-
ger to apprehend and the important inquiry which
next presents itseif is, how can web st defend oui-
selves ap-'mst a power so formidable, thus touching
us on ail points, except ng the small poraon of our
boundary along which Texas joins us 1
Evert poitionof our extended frontier demands
attention, inhrd as well as maritime, but with
this «tnkmg díñeteme —tint on the former, our
power is much gie iter than hers, as hers is greatei
than oars on the mauttme Theie we would be
the assailant and uhatevci works maj be eree'ed
there ought to have lefercnce to (hat fact, and look
mainly io pro ectirg impomnt points from sudden
seizuie and de station lather than to guard
against any ppimanent lodgment of a force within
our boideis
The difficult p'oblem is the defence of om man
time irontiei      That, of course, must consist  of
loi tifications and a nav y, but the question is, wInch
ought to be mainly relied on, and to what extent
the one may beconsi'ered as superselmgthe othci
On both points 1 pioposr to make a few remarks
Fortifications, as th" means of defeire aieh hie
to two foimidablc obiectmis either of \\1 ich is
decisive against them as an cxclusxc svstem of
rlefencp The list is t'nt they aie putei) deicn
s„ve Let the sjstem be evei so pcifect the woiks
located to the greatest advantage and planned and
constiticle 1 in the best ímnne , and all fhty can do
is to tcpel at ark Thcj cannot assail Thevait
like a shield \ ilhout a swoul If thev should be
regarded as suincieut to d di nd om mai Hime ci es,
still they cannot command icspeit oi give seeunty
to out widely spiead and impoitan' co nmercial
an 1 naxigatmg interests
But regarded simply as the means of defence,
thev aie defective Fortifications- are nothing
without men to gurison them, and if we should
have no othei means of defence Great Biitatn
could compel us, with a modélate fleet stationed at
the points mentione 1, and with but a small poitun
of her large military establishment, to keep upon
om pait, to guard our coast, ten limes the lorce, at
many times the cost, to gain on eur nnm ro is
fills Aided by (he swiftness ol steam he could
menace at the same time evei y point < f oui coa I
while we ignorant o! the time oi point \ hrrethe
blow might fill, would hav to stand ptepa ed at
exe*y moment and at every point to icptl hei at
ta k A bundled thousand men constantly ui der
aims would be insufficient for tue purpose , and we
would b1 compelled to vnld, n thi end.mgloiious
H without sinking a blow simply tiom tin ex-
haustion of our means
So ne 3 her n ode of d"i nee then, mu f b-
sought Thcie is noie othei bul a nax, I of
course, include steam as well as nil  If vie want
to defend our coast an 1 pints ct our rights ibirnd
it is absolute1} nece san I he onlv questions aie
hvw fat out rm il f nee ought to be carried and to
what extent it would supeisedc the sjstem of foiti
ficalion'i
Before 1 enter on the consideialion oí this ím
portant point [ owe it to inysMf and the subject to
piennse that my polu \ is ppace and tint I look fi
the na\ v but as the u,ht a m of define-, —not a      i
inthiimcnl of  co iqvcsl  o    r„..! indi-Cinen*     Out
load to gieatne's, as I said on a Hte o< casion  lies
not over the rums of otheis     Pioxidence has he
stowed on us a new and-vast lesion, abounding in
esources be\ oíd anj conntij of the same extent on
the glob"    Ouis is a peaceful task—io improve
this rich inheritance , to level its foiests    cultivate
its feitile soil    develop its vast minen I resources ,
on e the greatest rapidity and facility of mteicouise
between its widely extended parts   stud its wide
surface with flourishing cities, towns, and villages,
and spread over it nc hly cultivated fields So vast
is our country, that generations after generations
may pass away m executing this task, during the
whole of which time we would be rising more
surety and rapidly in numbers, wealth, greatness,
and influence, than any other people have ever
done by arms But, to carry out successfully this,
our li ue plan of acquiring greatness and happiness,
it is not of itself suificient to haxe peace and tran-
quillity within. These are indeed necessary, in,
order to leave the States and their citizens m the
full and undisturbed possession of their resources
and energy, by which to work out, m generous
rivalry the high destiny which certainly awai's
our country if we shou el be but true to ourselves
But, as important as they may be, it is not much
less so to have safety against external danger, and
the influence and lespectabihty abroad necessary
to seeuie out exterior interests and rights (so im-
portant to our prosperity) against aggression I
look to a navy lor these objects , and it is within
the limits they assign I would confine its growth
To what extent, then, with these views, ought our
navy to be eai ried 1 In my opimon, any navy less
t! an that w hich w ould giv e us the habitual com-
mand of our own coast and seas, would be little
short of useless One that could be driven irom
sea and kept m haibor bj the force which Great
Brit tin could safely and constantly allot to oui
coas, would be of little more service lhan an aux-
dixij a d to out fortifications in defending our
haibors and maritime cities It would be almost
as pa sive as thej are, and would do nothing to
dimmish the expense, which I have shown would
be so exhausting, to defend the coast exclusively
bv fortifications
But the  difficult question   still remains to be
solved—What naval lorce would be sufficient for
that purpose"*    It will not be expected that I should
give more than a conjectanl answer to such a
ques ion     I have neither the data nor the knowl-
edge of na   il xv arfa e to «peak \ ith any thing like
pieeison, but  I feel assured   that  the force re-
quned would be far less than what would be'hought
wh n the question is first propounded     The very
idea of defending ourselves on the ocean against
the immense pow ei of Gi eat Bntamon that element,
Ins sjinething stattling at the fust blush     But, as
greatly as she outnumbers us in ship   and naval
resources   w    have advantages that counteivail
that, in leference to the subject in hand     If she
Ins main ships, she his also many points to guard,
and these as widclv separated asare thepaitsof
hei w idelv extended cm] i e     She is forced to keep
a home fleet in the channel,—another in the oaltie,
—another in the Mediteiranean,—one beyond the
Cape of Good Hope, to gua dhei important posses-
sions in the east,—and anothei m the Pacific    Our
situation is the íeverse    We have no foreign pos
sessions, and not a point to guird beyond oui own
maritime Irontiei     There oui whole torce may be
concenluted, icatly to strike nhenevet a vulnera-
1 le point is  exposed     It to thrse advantages  be
adit 1,  that b^'h  Prance  and Russia have large

Great Bn am would effect what I contemplate    I
