[The memorial sets forth that the institution of
slavery has ever been interwoven with society in
some way or other, and results from the nature of
things, and must continue an accompaniment (by
necessity) of whatever partakes of human ordi-
nances and human institutions. It is of divine or-
igin, recognized and sustained by the precepts of
the Bible, and rules laid down for its regulation
clearly and explicitly. One-half the States of this
Union recognize the institution of slavery, and
iru^ranty the right of property in slaves. To pass
laws forbidding the extension of the institution to
the Territories of the Union would in process of
time abrogate the institution where it now exists,
and thereby partake of the nature of an ex post
facto law, in violation of the express terms of the
Constitution.]

personal explanation.
Mr. FOOTE. I feel it to be due to myself as a
member of this body, and to the Senate itself* that
I should offer a short explanation in response to a
card which I find to have appeared on yesterday
morning in the National Intelligencer, over the
signature of his honor Justice McLean, which con-
tains denials of statements made by me in debate
here a few days ago, and assertions of fact touching
matters discussed by me on the occasion referred
to, which, appearing in one of he respectable
papers in which we publish an official account of
our proceedings, seems to be specially entitled to
the kind of notice which it is my design to bestow.
The Judge commences his card as follows:
"Respect for the Senate, where remarks were made abu-
sive ot myself on the 18th instant, induces me to make the
following statements."
He then goes on to observe thatâ
"The first accusation (alluding to myself) was, that F have
said that1 our institutions will never be well and wisetyand
'succesj-fuily maintained and administeied until what he is
'pleased to call moral influence can be hi ought to bear upon
{the Governmentâwho daies to denounce the sekcted can-
didates of the great political parties of the country as mere
' prize~jizhters., The lerm " prize-fighters'was never used by
me in reference to any individuals; the thought of making
the application to the late candidates for the Presidency
never entered into my mind."
I wish it were in my power to withdraw the
accusation which has been so positively denied:
which I would certainly do were I satisfied that 1
had done injustice to the learned Judge. But as,
upon a reexamination of a certain letter of his
quoted the other day from memory, I find that i
did not at all misunderstand or misrepresent its
contents, instead of withdrawing the accusation, 1
