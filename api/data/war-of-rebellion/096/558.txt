Prickett that it did not enter his mind to fire on these two mounted men, so confident was he that they were our own officers. One, the leading man, was dressed in officer's jacket and dark pants, and finely mounted; the second one, much younger, and acting as if he was an orderly, was dressed in a blouse and light uniform pants, and was also well mounted. Charges will be preferred against Lieutenant Prickett for gross neglect of duty, and if, after an investigation of his past record, I find his previous services have not been particularly meritorious. I shall make application to have him summarily discharged the service, with reasons stated.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
