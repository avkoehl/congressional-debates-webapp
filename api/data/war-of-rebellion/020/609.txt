In entering upon my duties, which may involve at an early day the defense of two of the most important cities in the Confederate States against the most formidable efforts of our powerful enemy, I shall rely upon the ardent patriotism, the intelligence, and unconquerable spirit of the officers and men under my command to sustain me successfully. But to maintain our posts with credit to our country and our own honor and avoid irremediable disaster it is essential that all shall yield implicit obedience to any orders emanating from superior authority.

Brigadier General Thomas Jordan is announced as adjutant and inspector general and chief of staff of the department.

G. T. BEAUREGARD,

General, Commanding.
HDQRS. DEPT. OF SOUTH CAROLINA AND GEORGIA, September 24, 1862.

General G. T. BEAUREGARD,Charleston, S. C.:

GENERAL: I have the honor to state, in answer to your inquiry, that in my opinion this department can be successfully defended against any reasonable force which it is probable the enemy may bring against it, to wit:

James Island: 10,000 infantry, 1,000 heavy artillery, 500 cavalry, 5 field batteries.

Morris Island: 1,000 infantry, 250 heavy artillery, 50 cavalry.

Sullivan's Island: 1,500 infantry, 800 heavy artillery, 50 cavalry, 1 field battery.

Christ Church: 1,000 infantry, 100 heavy artillery, 200 cavalry, 1 field battery.

Saint Andrew's: 2,000 infantry (movable column), 200 heavy artillery, 200 cavalry, 2 field batteries.

Third Military District: 5,000 troops of all arms.

Savannah: 10,000 infantry, 1,200 heavy artillery, 2,000 cavalry, 8 field batteries.

Fort Sumter: 500 heavy artillery, 100 riflemen.

Georgetown (merely for purposes of preventing marauding, the defense of Winyaw Bay requiring obstructions and a numerous heavy artillery, both of which are entirely out of the question): 7 companies of cavalry, 3 batteries of artillery, 3 companies of infantry.

The above estimate is based upon the supposition that attacks may be made simultaneously upon different points.

I am, genera, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. C. PEMBERTON,

Major-General, Provisional Army.

[Indorsement.]

CHARLESTON, S. C., September 24, 1862.

Approved as the minimum force required, as above stated, to guard with security the Department of South Carolina and Georgia.

G. T. BEAUREGARD,

General, Commanding.
