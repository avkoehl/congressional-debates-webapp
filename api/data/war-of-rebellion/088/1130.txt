In case of firing down the plank road or Norfolk road, you will please send the rest of your reserve regiments to the point indicated above and commence thinking out your line so as to get your reserve available, holding your front line with the inclosed works and batteries now garrisoned only, or with the aid of these works and a skirmish line in the connecting pits.
