On the 7th and 8th, the brigade again met the enemy near Boonsborough, and fought him with advantage several hours each day. On the 9th, he was again engaged and driven several miles, when cess all the way through. During these combats, which were mostly on foot (the enemy's infantry being engaged), there were some dashing, telling charges made, mounded. I mention particularly one made by the Sixth U. S. Cavalry, followed up by the First U. S. Cavalry, on the Boonsborough and Hagerstown road. In both of these the enemy was severely punished, and captures, were made in hand-to-hand conflicts. Battery K, First U. S. Artillery(Captain Graham), did excellent service during all this season. It was directed with skill by its accomplished, soldierly commander. It was disabled by the guns were brought away, and the battery is now in good repair. In the affair of the 14th, at Falling Waters, the brigade made captures and took parts as set forth in reports of regimental commanders. The list of casualties is remarkably small for so much hard fighting. The men of the brigade, from long and constant practice, are becoming perfect in the art of foot fighting and skirmishing, and obeyed all orders(save the one to retire) with an alacrity and vim which shows a determination and courage that cannot be conquered by double their number. Thy drove infantry from strong positions and always worsted the enemy's cavalry wherever found. It is next to impossible to furnish any elaborate account of events which occurred, as these did, through several days of extreme activity in the field. Part of the time the brigade, was without wagons or packs, and for five days during the time from the 1st we were without a regular issue of rations or forage. The rations, I think, should be commuted to the command. The regimental commanders and officers, without exception, to my knowledge, displayed a zeal and valor which shows them eminently fitted for the command of the brave soldiers in the brigade. My staff did everything that finished officers could do. The lines were necessarily long, and they were continually called on to ride in exposed places along the entire front. Lieutenant McQuesten, acting assistant adjutant-general, is particularly deserving of praise for his untiring exertions in transmitting orders and expediting their execution; so, also, Lieutenants[Edward] Myers and [Eugene P.] Bertrand. I cannot close this report without specially thanking 	Captain C. E. Norris, Second U. S. Cavalry, who was acting on my staff, for his valuable service during the entire time embraced in this report. Sergeant[Charles]Polk and Corporal[James A.]Pearson, Second U. S. Cavalry, performed important service. I inclose list of casualties* and reports of regimental commanders.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. MERRITT

Brigadier General of Volunteers, Commanding Reserve Brigade.

Captain M. W. KREOGH, A. A. A. G., First Division, Cavalry Corps.

P. S. -Since writing the above, I have been able to get reports from the Sixth U. S. Cavalry, as also list of casualties, * which I inclose, They are necessarily more or less informal.
