WINCHESTER, VA., April 16, 1862.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

Messenger sent out with copy of order, and mine based thereon met General Blenker at Paris and Berry's Ferry and brought reply, which was telegraphed to Strasburg 10 o'clock last night, grumbling at your order, and failing to report the strength, condition of ammunition, camp equipage, supplies of subsistence, transportation, and forage. I telegraphed immediately at this place, to be forwarded to him, that your orders left me and him no discretion; that he was not to surrender his command, but obey my orders, and calling for information. Messenger not yet returned.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Brigadier-General, U. S. Army.

WINCHESTER, VA., April 16, 1862.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

An officer in from Blenker's. Three regiments of Bohlen's brigade crossed Berry's Ferry. The last one lost 60 men and 2 officers, drowned by upsetting the boat. This stopped further crossing there. The remaining troops go to Snicker's Ferry. If you approve my plan orders ought to come at once. General Fremont will not need more than one brigade until he gets down below Staunton. The combined movement will make it easy to re-enforce him from General Banks', while the latter can draw from the remainder of the division toward Luray.

W. S. ROSECRANS.

WINCHESTER, VA., April 16, 1862.

Brigadier General LORENZO THOMAS,

Adjutant-General, U. S. Army:

GENERAL: I have just received the inclosed report of an unfortunate occurrence at Berry's Ferry, over the Shenandoah, by which we have lost a captain and 60 men, drowned by the upsetting of the ferry-boat.

It is evident that there was a want of order and discipline, by which the men were permitted to stand up and wear their knapsacks. It also shows there was no adequate provision of ropes and other means of crossing fords or ferries made to accompany this division; a matter which if not promptly attended to will work us yet further and greater injuries.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Brigadier-General, U. S. Army.
