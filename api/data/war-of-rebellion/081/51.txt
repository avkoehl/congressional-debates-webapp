Has the train arrived and ready to cross? If so, show this telegram to General Benham, and direct the bridge to be immediately closed, and the train to commence crossing. What news from the wharf and the boats for ferrying below?

BRIDGE, June 15, 1864-1.50 p.m.

Major-General MEADE:

The trains have not come in sight, but are expected in half an hour. They should be ready to cross as soon as the draw can be closed. I shall so inform General Benham. I have taken Pitkin and party to Douthat's Wharf. He will have it repaired, another made at Wind Mill Point, and will send a party to City Point. I have not been to Wilson's Wharf, but there is not doubt but that infantry can be ferried from that point to Fort Powhatan. We have plenty of steamers above and below.
