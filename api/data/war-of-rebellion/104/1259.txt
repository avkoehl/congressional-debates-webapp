Lieutenant-General FORREST,

Meridian, Miss.:

Your order for General Jackson received at 10 last night. I sent courier with it to Greensborough. They will have to cross by steamboats, as there are not sufficient pontoons.

Lieutenant GEORGE MARSHALL,

Suggsville, Ala.:

LIEUTENANT: Your communication of yesterday is at hand, for which I thank you. Lieutenant-General Forrest is now with me and desires that you will very vigilantly scout the river as low down as the junction of the two rivers, and keep a bright lookout-for the boats of the enemy, as it is through they may now be moving up. Horseflesh must not be spared day or night in sending the speediest information to this post of any discoveries that may be made. Get information of all movements by land as well as by the river, and keep your scouts busily employed. Early and reliable information is all-important at this time.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. JONES,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding Post.
