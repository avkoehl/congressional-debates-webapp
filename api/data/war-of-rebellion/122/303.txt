times were devoted solely to the arts of peace were yet ready on the instant to rush to arms in defense of their rights when assailed. At the present moment the Government presents the striking anomaly of being embarrassed by the generous outpouring of volunteers to sustain its action. Instead of laboring under the difficulty of monarchical governments, the want of men to fill its armies (which in other countries has compelled a resort to forced conscription), one of its main difficulties is to keep down the proportion of the Army and to prevent it from swelling beyond the actual force required.

The commanding officers of the regiments in the volunteer service, both for the three-months' service and for the war, have in many instances not yet furnished the Department with the muster-rolls of their regiments. For the want of these returns it is impossible to present as accurate an enumeration of the volunteer force accepted and in the field as could be desired.

Under the proclamation issued by you on the 15th of April last the Governors of different States were called upon to detach from the militia under their command a certain quota to serve as infantry or riflemen for the period of three months, unless sooner discharged. The call so made amounted in the aggregate to ninety-four regiments, making 73,391 officers and men. Of the States called upon, the Governors of Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Arkansas, Kentucky, and Missouri peremptorily refused to comply with the requirements made by the Department. All the other States promptly furnished the number required of them, except Maryland, whose Governor, though manifesting entire readiness to comply, was prevented from so doing by the outbreak at Baltimore.

In the States of Virginia, Delaware, and Missouri, notwithstanding the positive refusal of their executive officers to co-operate with the Government, patriotic citizens voluntarily united together and organized regiments for the Government service. Delaware and Virginia furnished each a regiment, both of which are on duty in the field. In a similar patriotic spirit the loyal people of Missouri raised a force of 11,445 officers and men, making in round numbers twelve organized regiments to sustain the Government and to put down rebellion in that State; and so also the citizens of the District of Columbia, emulating these Honorable examples, furnished no less than 2,823 officers and men, making in all four full regiments, all of which are yet in the field doing active and efficient service. Thus, notwithstanding the refusal of disloyal Governors to respond, the Government, instead of having been furnished with only the number of troops called for under your proclamation of the 15th of April last, has received and has now in service under that call, in round numbers, at least 80,000.

Under your second proclamation of the 4th [3rd] of May last, calling for volunteers to serve during the war, there have been accepted up to this date 208 regiments. A number of other regiments have been accepted, but on condition of being ready to be mustered into the service within a specified time, the limitation of which has in some instances not expired. It is not possible to state how many of these may be ready before the meeting of Congress. Of the regiments accepted, all are infantry and riflemen, with the exception of two battalions of artillery and four regiments of cavalry. A number of regiments mustered as infantry have, however, attached to them one or more artillery companies, and there are also some regiments partly made up of companies of cavalry.
