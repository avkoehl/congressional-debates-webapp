Our territory, exclusive of Alaska, embraces
2,819,811 square miles, and lias an estimated
population of forty millions.
The United Kingdom, in the narrow circuit
of 120,879 miles has nearly thirty millions.
Germany (North and South combined) has
208,57-1 square miles with over thirty-eight
millions, France 274,480 square miles, with
also thirty-eight millions, and Russia nearly
two million square miles with sixty-eight mil-
lion inhabitants.
A comparison of these figures .shows that the
area of the United States surpasses the terri-
torial extent of these four countries combined
by more than two hundred thousand square
miles: or by a stretch of land larger than
Germany, or twice as large as the kingdom of
Great Britain. The population of these four
countries, however, is four times as large as
ours, and even thinly settled. Russia has half
as many more inhabitants than we have, or, in
other words, Great Britain has twenty heads
and forty hands, Germany thirteen brains and
twenty-six hands, France hasten minds and
twenty arms, and Russia has two heads and
four arms for the development, improvement,
and defense of every spot of ground for which
we have but one head and two arms.
What does this prove, if not that in com-
parison with them we are poor and weak in
the midst of our immense stores and treasures
us long as wo are short of men to gather the
former and collect and defend the latter?
Need I say that our forests are useless with-
out the application of labor, our fields refuse
to bestow the gifts of nature without the skill
of the husbandman, and our mineral wealth
remains hidden forever without the combined
elements of industry? Need I state that, sup-
posing wo have rough labor enough to sup-
ply our primitive wants, without more skilled
labor we will be, for comfort, always in degrad-
ing dependence upon countries, some of which
have manifested direct hostility against our
national interests and most saercd rights? Wo
cannot afford to wait patiently until the neces-
sary complement of skillful American labor
utilizes the riches of our forests, constructs
buildings of comfort and vessels of commerce,
brings forth the treasures of the earth and
molds our stores of gold, silver, iron, copper,
and lead into emblems of beauty and struc-
tures of use and defense.
What then is our best policy to remove
these deficiencies and to elevate the standard
of our industry to an equality with that of the
favored capitalists who arc our overbearing
neighbors?
The natural increase 01 population is a slow
process in face of our pressing demands, and
nothing but a continuous immigration and espe-
cially a large influx of mechanical skill can ame-
lioriate our present condition. The access of
foreign agricultural labor, valuable and desir-
able as it is, is not half so important as that
of other industrial producers. Our agricul-
tural production is already greatly in excess
of our home consumption, but our manufactur-
ing and mining activity is so insufficient for our
domestic demands that in spite of all tariffs
our imports constantly exceed our exports of
manufactures, and thereby exercise continually
a heavy drainage of our capital. In proof of
this I refer you to the table of values of our
imports and exports in each of the twelve years
from 1857 to 1868 inclusive, namely:
Years. Imports. Exports.
185 7 $360,890,141 $338,985,065
185 8  282,013,150 293,758,279
185 9  383,768,130 335,894,385
1860   362,166,254 373,189,284
186 1  335,650,153 228,699,486
18(52  205,771,729 213,069,519
186 3  252,919,920 305,884,998
186 4  329,562,895 320,035,199
186 5  248,555,652 323,743,187
186 6  445,512,158 550,684,277
186 7  417,833,575 43b',577,312
1808  371,624,808 154,301,713
At the first glance it would seem as if these
figures would not confirm my statement; but
when it is considered that our imports repre-
sent invariably gold prices, while our export
values are given in currency rates, it will be
found that with the exception of 1858, when
the foregoing crisis, (or the reduced tariff,) and
18C0, when the imminence of war had shaken
our credit in Europe, my assertions are strictly
correct. It must be also remembered that of
our exports at least four fifths consist of raw
materials and mostly of agricultural products,
such as cereals, tobacco, and cotton, while
our imports, nearly in the same ratio, repre-
sent manufactures, and it will be easily under-
stood under what enormous disadvantage our
industry labors.
I wish I could enter upon a minute exam-
ination of all classes of the separate articles,
and show in detail the relation of our imports
and exports, as their figures present most strik-
ing arguments against free trade; but I can only
mention a few of them, beginning with steel.
In the six years from 1857 to 1863 wo did not
exportone dollar's worth of steel, while during
the same period we imported §538,337,424 worth
of that article.
From 1803 to 18C8 we exported $1,941,734
worth, but imported $30,042,465 worth of the
same. Our war measures had no undue influ-
ence upon these imports, as is clearly shown
by the fact that before the war and after its
close the imports of steel were larger than
during the same.
The price of steel was reduced by the war
from eighteen to thirteen cents in 1801, and
in the war our steel sold at thirty-two cents,
while the English material, and no better arti-
cle, was up to forty-five cents. Thus home
manufacture lowered prices and saved us from
a pitiful dependence upon England.
This is a convincing proof of three things :
First, that our steel industry received during
the war an enormous impulse and development
by the demands of our belligerent condition;
Second, that notwithstanding the unprece-
dented progress during the war, it is still not
strong enough for successful competition with
the foreign steel manufacturers; and
Third, that the latter, in spite of the much
decried tariff, still seeks and finds a remuner-
ative market in our country.
These $72,000,000 iu gold withheld from
this single branch of industry during twelve
years is, with the exception of the revenue col-
lected thereon, a clear loss not only to industry,
but also to agriculture and commerce.
Would it not be a great advantage to our
farmers and merchants to have more mechan-
ical force, so that we might ourselves manu-
facture our own supplies and more? Is not
every artisan a consumer for the farmers pro-
duce as well as a customer for the merchant's
trade? Does he not more than compensate
the farmer for a small increase in the price of
his tools by raising the domestic demand and
price of agricultural produce, or does the mer-
chant realize less profit on the sale of domestic
than on foreign manufactures? Is it, then, bad
policy to induce especially the immigration of
mechanics to flow to our shores?
But descriptions of our blooming prairies
have but little charm to the educated mechanic;
he wields his trade implements with ease, and
therefore loves them; but he is awkward with
plow and harrow, and therefore dislikes them.
Nothing but high wages, plenty of work, com-
fort, educational advantages, and civil liberty
will entice him to leave his home and settle
among us, and these advantages can only bo
secured by a proper protection of our industry
until it is strong enough to fight its own battle
and hold its own ground against foreign com-
petition.
In reply to the argument advanced by the
gentleman from New York [Mr. Beooks] and
other advocates of free trade, I will state that
protection by a tariff is not deemed necessary
in this country only.
Europe, with its crowded population, cheap
labor, and great capital, all giving superior
advantages for manufacturing, does not pre-
sent, in face of all ingenious professions for
free trade, a single country, not even Great
Britain excepted, which docs not guard some
branches of its industry by a tariff.
I am guided in this assertion by an examin-
ation into the custom tariffs of fourteen lead-
ing nations, and I acknowledge that their cus-
tom imposts are mostly lower than ours ; yet
there are several instances of equal and even
some of higher rates. France, enlightened
France, exhibits quite ai number of articles
entirely prohibited, among which I hope our
free traders may not overlook steel.
The rates of tariff are or should be regulated,
not by theories or fixed rules, but by the rates
of interest, wages, state of trade, debt, natural
resources, &c., of each nation; and what might
be a low tariff in one country may be a high
one in another, and vice versa.
In France, silk manufactures are free of
import duty; yet the reason is because the
slightest impost (a single cent per pound)
would be equal to prohibition there, while here
it would be ridiculously low, and would not
pay the expense of collection. Thus, reasons
entirely inapplicable to one country may be
conclusive and powerful with other countries.
Cotton yarn is charged in France with sev-
enty-three cents of import duty per pound,
while we tax it with forty per cent, ad valorem,
and yet, in 1868, we imported $11,928,461 of
cotton manufactures, and exported only $4,-
871,054 of the same.
Pig-iron in our country now pays nine dol-
lars per ton, and the bill before the House
proposes to reduce the duty to seven dollars,
while France charges $7 80, a fact which is
strikingly significant, and to which I wish to
call your notice.
The duty on cast-iron pipes is proposed to
be fixed at one and three fourths cent per
pound, and on other cast iron at thirty-five per
cent, ad valorem, while France (another illus-
trative fact) prohibits the import of all iron
castings entirely.
In regard to manufactures of iron it is also
worth observing that under the present tariff,
which is proposed to be reduced, we imported
in 1868 $10,473,010 worth, and only exported
$2,597,809 worth of the same.
Refined sugar pays in this country an im-
port duty which the new tariff contemplates to
lessen to four cents per pound, but in France
it is entirely prohibited.
Our imports of these articles in 1868 may
be found expressed in values in the following
table:
Articles. Imports. Exports.
Value m gold. Vamain currency.
Cotton yarn  $11,928,461 $4,871,054
Iron manufactures... 10,473,619 2,597,809
Sugars and molasses. 61,605,786 313,378
Total  884,007,866
87,782,241
On these imports the revenue alone amounts
to a great deal more than our total values of
the export as given above, which, however,
will he greatly reduced if the proposed tariff
be adopted.
I regret that I am unable to present the
specified subdivisions of these three classes
of products, as they would demonstrate still
