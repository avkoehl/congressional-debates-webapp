Colonel PHIL. STOCKTON, Commanding Arsenal:

COLONEL: The lieutenant-general commanding directs me to say that a dispatch just received from Vicksburg states that at this, the moment of greatest need, "the ammunition for heavy guns is nearly exhausted there; " that, therefore, he desires that you will take immediate and energetic measures to throw in a sufficient supply in the quickest possible time. If you have not enough on hand, take measures to procure it, and, of impeded by them, to the neglect of forms, regulations, allowances, &amp;c., as the exigencies of the case do not admit these for a moment to be considered.

Very respectfully,

J. C. TAYLOR,

Aide-de-Camp.

P. S. -At least 200 rounds per gun should be kept constantly on hand, and what you have now should be immediately sent.
