POLE CAT CREEK, May 22, [1864]--1.15 p. m.

General LEE:

GENERAL: Two hours ago I took position here, where the ground is very strong, leaving pickets from Wright's Tavern down. About two brigades infantry were then in sight, and I have been skirmishing with them since. They are pushing on sharply, but I can hold them here for some time. Everything is clear, and I only wish to mask the movement of the infantry. This is Burnside's corps, which crossed at Milford, and I fear that nothing else is here. Scouts do not report any troops going down the old Stage road across the Mattapony, and I have failed to hear of any other than Burnside's column lower than Guiney's Station. I would like to receive orders before night. Corn can be got near here, and I am feeding. General Bragg telegraphs that one regiment started up on the 19th. If you hear of them will your order them to the Junction? I hope the others will join me there.

I am, very respectfully, yours,

WADE HAMPTON,

Major-General.
