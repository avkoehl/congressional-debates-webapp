his counti y, though some evils may exist m them,
stand as a mark of admiration for the rest of the
woild If so, then has lie, incautiously, perhaps,
been betrayed by party feeling into the introduc-
tion of a measure which bungs his own eotmtry
into comparison with a country and State, of so-
ciety which cannot be -compared with her with-
out disparagement
Mi President, perhaps wécould ]udge this case
more cleatly if, in a simple manner, we in-quired
under what institutions ofGovei nment,and under
what state of society, patronage becomes a pow-
erful principle, capable of producing sucli gteat
effects as to iequne an exuaeidmary remedy,
also, under what form of Government, and m
what state of society, it is a principle that wmks
mischief, and is therefore to be counteracted by,
means dangerous to the best pruaeiptos of Gov-
ernment. Let us trieri bring this English example,
that has been so admired, into companson with
ours in regard to this matter
What «re flie íñMUtftions of that Government,
and wKat is the structure of society in that coun-
try, where patr-Ormge is a formidable principte to
be met by powerful means, lest it should oveiturn
public hbeity ' It is that Goiemimnt, and that
state of society, in which the Government is in
the possession of a particular t lass of sot lety, and
that cla-s"! not the most numerous, who ai o in
then feeling8 and opinions to be influenced by
such patromge This is the fiist condition of so
ciety in which patronage is so poweiful that it
should be watched with jealousy The ne\t con-
dition of that society is this that the executive
or patronizing power should have the means of
drawing to itself the products of the laboi of the
producing classes; and the thud condition of this
society is, that there should be thoie establish-
ments in the country which Would enable the ex-
ecutive so to extend that pvtronage as to keep
down the governed class If any one of these
conditions fail, pationage rsmecessarily feeble, if
they concur, it is hardly to be resisted, and in
England these conditions all' concurring, patron-
age has there overcome all resistance
The Government of England is in tlioliardsof
a class—perhaps I should say the anstoeiaey and j
tho fund-boliieis—and llio Govemmint being m
the possesion of this class, not the most nuinei- [
ous, pationage may influence thesiiiTiogesof that
< lass, to aieomphsfi its measures and sustain its
power The peculmiity of England is this that
while it has a powerful aristocracy, this class has
gioat necessities to meet, for which it must de-
pend on the Government When Isaythis much,
evi ry fat muor's thoughts anticipate what is to
follow i he punciple of prmiogonituie isestab
Imhed in England,and runs ihiough all her laws,
customs, and habits, because that principle is
necessary to maintain in rank, influence, and
sfilendor, the nnstoeraey, which has possession
ot the Government That veiy principle which
throws this class in servile dependence upon the
Government makes it Us most zealous and effi-
ciuu supportei Theeldest son mheiiting all tho
¡iropcrty of the parent, there is thrown upon so-
ciety a vast number of youngei children, who
must either be provided for by the Government,
or left in a slate of destitution, which would bung
that aristocracy into«0 tempt The pi mciple of
primogeniture, therefore, which m the strength of
the aristocracy, is also then* weakness, because
the younger children, lnheuting no patnmony,
must find some other means of procuring sub-
sistence, or they are thrown in servile depend-
ence upon the Government That means is found
m the numerous and lucrative offices in tlie gift
of the Crown Theseare the commissionsin the
army and wvy—the church livings of various
degrees of emotatnent—numerous places in the
law—offices connected with their vast colonial
possessions, tog«her With hundreds of sinecure
places, altogether unknown to our simple and
economical insulations.
The nexrtquesli«h is-has she the revenue drawn
from the productive tabor, and the preeeeds of
the property of the g¡reat body ef the nation—
has she means by which the Executive., Ih pro-'
cut mg powei, can, in this manner, contribute to
the support of, and entirely sustain, this numer-
ous class, with ilitsir families' She "has always
Ua<t 1805,080,000* düasw* ímm 4b* frodifctiw
classes, for her annual levenue For the taxing
power being in the hands of a powerful aristoc-
racy, in consequence of the limitation of the right
of suffrage, by which the laboiing and productive
classes, from whom the taxes aie drawn, ire de-
nied a voice in assessing them, this aristocracy,
who are, in fact, tlie tax consumers., have an in-
terest in levying a sufficient amount to support
the numerous offices which are to be filled by
those connected with them At the vei y moment
that thie Ministry are boasting of their economy,
at the moment that the complaint is made that
the economy of the Government is so strict that
it is paung to the quick, this unproductive class
is entirely sustained from the proceeds of the labor
of the productive The second condition is there-
fore answered. The first was, that the Govern-
ment should be in the possession of a few who
ire to be influenced by its patronage. The second
was, that the Government should have the meaos
of approaching them with patronage And the
third condition was, that the Government should
have those establishments which might become
tho instruments by which to reach the patronized
anuocracy or governing class
What fuiuishi s the agency5 The ofioes, by
which the Gow rnmcnt is biought into contact
with the class which is to fill tht in Tht u is the
army, with its numerous commissions, a power
ful navy, of which ninety bhips aie in commie
sion at this moment, when two 01 three ships-of-
wai aie sufficient to piotect our lueiative com-
meice in all paits of the woild There aie ilso

means of powerful pationage Then theieisthe
bar, with its numeious places, and the church,
with plaies more numerous still Turn youreyes
whole you will,and you bdiold the land coveied
with the ptiesthood of tho national cliuieh, from
tho mitored bishop to the paush priest, suppoiu d
fiom. the national tovonue, directly or indtnctly
under tho patronage of the Government, and com
posed almost exiluSWi ly of the younger sons of
tho puviloged class Ihe Chunh of England is

Give me a gov imng <lnss small in tht 11 nnm
bns, and that class wielding the power of tlu
Government not only without ugatd to tin in
ten sis of the gital body of tlu pe pie, but with
an express lnohnition to keep them in x state of
depiession, and pievent them from aequninn; th
power of ovoi turning thou monopoly, and I can
tasilyshow that tiny possess a patronage ut-
terly destructive of liboity Give them the means
ot operating on the pioductive classes by the n
numeious inteiofitod agents, and what follows'
They will pioclaim that the strictest economy is
exorcised in the admimstiation of the Govern-
ment When their interest íequiies it, the peo-
ple will be assailed with appeals to their passions
and their piejudices Wai, horud war, will be
proclaimed as necessary for the honor and in-
terests of the nation That horrid god, with
bloody ]aws and furious eyes, will be invoked to
tho aid of the govei mng class in maintaining tin ir
supremacy over the governed Who ever heaid
of a plan for educating the people proposed by
their aiistocratic opprcssois' Who evei heatd
this olass uige that war was to be avoided, that
it made widows and orphans, that it was the
cause of physical pains to those whoentoicd into
tho eomhat, and of demoralization to all' The
contrary feeling proceeds fiom false honor, and
it was that feeling which the governing class
sought to infuse into the governed Shall the na-
tion submit to insult' Shall the pride of Britain
submit to an indignity? and shall we not always
be prepaied with laige means, not only to repel
aggression and chastise insult, but fot final tn-
umph, by having the means of giving the first
and effectual blow' By such arguments as this,
a state of things was produced which enabled
the Government to contribute to the support of
the younger sons of fheir aristocracy, and by
which means they were not only supported, but
supported in a degree of pompand luxury suited
to their high pretensions' Thus, having put the
Government in the hands df a few, you have all
that is desired to perpetuate their power, and en-
able them to support it from tho pióducts of the
l«fe«f ffi tm prdaWte classes.
Mr. President, to these thiee great conditions
in the Government of England, there aro two aux-
iliary conditions, powerfully contributing to their
strength The first auxiliary is, tliattlie Executive
or patronizing power should be hmeditary. This
being the case, parties are not formed whose in-
terest it is to countciact Executive usurpations.
This power being unchanging, that puncrple by
which those seeking office counteract the influence
ot those m office is entirely lost No one who
desires office dares to insult that Executive, by
questioning the justice or propriety of his appoint-
ments, as such an act would condemn him to de-
spair of ever holding office himself, it would only
disappoint his own wishes The next auxiliary
principle is this where it is difficult to procure
the means of subsistence, there patronage requires
tsevr vigor Where it is difficult to procure sub-
sistence, where all the employments of active life
aie filled up, there the pursuit of office ra one of
great anxiety and perseverance How is it in
England' There the liberal professions are all
filled to overflowing The bar, the church, the-
medical profession, are all overstocked, and m
mercantile pursuits, the business of trade, and
even of laboi, where tho whole day of toil barely
proeuies blend enough to sustain life, there are
hosts ol eager, anxious competitors jostling each
othi i In the mnnufactuung distncts, whcie Ihe
laboréis ask only foi employment and biead, they
have been answered %vith steel Aimed troops
nish on them, and cut them down with sivage
butchery, while no íosource is left them but pas-
sive submission Thus all the piofessious and
employments of life, the church, the bar, the
medical profession, the aimy and navy, with all
tho employments afloided by cofnmeice and the
arts, are filled up with eager and anxious com-
pctitois lleie, then, is a condition of society in
winch the desno foi, and necessity of, employ-
inc nt is so stiong as to make pitronagc a power-
ful pimciplc
Now, mi, how will these principles apply to
oui < mini y Can fiom two and a hilf to throe
milliin votéis be influenced by the limited tx-
pendituus of this Crovenmient' A whole na-
ti m to patiomzo itself ' An idea too ludicrous,
too nbsuid,to need i letutation In our country
sufTiti^e is ( sscntmliy umvcis<il—the exci ptions
bemn so tuflii g as to allow me to consider it so
Pitionagp is then tobo applied not to the govern
ing oi "oveined class, but to scattered individuals
of an entire people How infatuated then mould
tint Admimstiation be, which would think of ap-
plying its pationage to an unwoithy purpose'
Most of us do not see the Federal Government by
the meins of its officeis Many of us at our
homos may cast our eyes around, and taking the
whole hoiizon m view, hardly see a spot in which
even a little postmaster may be found Andheie,
with this limited patronage, is an Administration
which is so usurp the liberties of the people, by
inesns of suon patronage' Reason c-tnnot com-
pielund it—the absurdity is too great to aHow of
its being íefuted
Gentlemen say that there are certain points in
the Union where patronage is concentrated In
Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York, and Boston.
What then' Has the Administration carried the
elections in these cities by means of its officers '
Far different is the state of facts The Adminis-
tration has lield all this concentrated patronage in
vain Can it be believed that, in a city like New
York, where three hundred thousand people are
roused to the highest state of excitement in what
they believed to be a struggle for their liberties,
they could be controlled by a few office-holders'
The idea is too absurd When such a popula-
tion is roused by those influences which agitate
fieernen, you could no more resist them with your
handfull of office-holders than a feather could re-
sist a storm To test this matter by fact, let us
inquire, what has been the history of patronage
under the American Government And here I
set out with stating this principle where there is
a calm and tranquil state of society, where there
are no violent stiuggles of parties, patronage, may
exercise some influence, but where there is a se-
vere party struggle, and ohe which is continued
with regard to principle, the power of patronage
cease's As in the calm and uiirufited waters the*
fteblsst -swimmei makes his way, while in the;
