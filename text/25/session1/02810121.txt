the mteres'süi i-o banks wou'd indue" them, \oluntardy, to
subject themselves to die restrictions proposed, exceptsuch as
should ho selected as depositories The value of this patronage
would tie gieally impaired if die notes of the ( eposlte banks

bring them elves within the restrictions and within the benefits
of tie system What, then, would be the effect in \ ractice,

of the whole, and it is known at the Treasury and will

buisements, and the safe management of the pimhc funds, can
ever rcquue But suppose the 1 lghest number here ifoie

anount, equal to your receipts and disbursements, in a con
s'an ly active state In this way alone, in his judgment, is it in
ihe power of this Government to expand the specie basis fer our
immense paper cnculation
He could not see that the action of the b 11 proposed by the
Senatoi frim Virginia would accomplish tin object, while it
did a[ i at to him that a perfect separation from the banks and
a gradual return to a metallic currency foi the operations of the
National freasuiy, might reach it
Tie only othei alternative which had been presented was a
natiwnalbank No distinct propc >ttion m a legisl tme form,
for such an institution was heft re the Senate but the débale
liad developed the f ict tha such an ins i ution was the lavoute
alternative ol a luge mmorm Í he bo ly mil tliei oie he
made this allusion to i It was not Ins purp ise to discuss t in
any mannel In the absence ot anv distinct pioposition, and
after the lecent expression of the Senate upon that point, he
coukl not feel wairantcd in taking the time even to reply to the
a euments which had been advancedin favol of this plan The
whole subject h id constituted a topic of copstant discussion be
fore the count! y for years, and he could not hope, at tine late
day, to give an> new ideas upon it to ihe Senate or to the public
He had upon his notes several other replies which he had
intended to make but the latenessof the lioul, find the full dls
cussiin which every important point m the debate had received
fiom others, would miace him to omit them, with a single ex
ception
The hononblo Senator from Virginia, (Mr Rives) had seem
ed o suppose that nothing had transpired to weaken the confi
de ire i thos8 who had foirnerly lavored the system of State
bank deposites H* was one who had favored tint system,
whei it w as a 'op ed by the Execu ive in 1S33 4 lie then ex

thusp stnitir is Their su ¡sequent con luet hal gone ftrto
convi re htm thachis t anfi lence was excesslvo and misplaced
He would not say that that system of depontes had entirely
f lied as thats emed r0 1 e ap it of debate and ques ion bi t
1 " wou! 1 °av that the banks bad failed to comply with their
o iligatio is that both the Gf ivernment and the peop e had been
ledUePd to extremities by this fallare on nen part that we
found ouiselves here at this un easonab c penol, in conse
q i i cp of it and that in view ol the e facts he heard with
some suipi se, the deelnation oonfidentiy pronounces!, that
noth ng ha 11 iken pi ice to authorize a chanse of opinion as to
he safety of that system
He had been ieoeatedIy published to the courtly as grossly
inconsistent for supporting and sustt ning that system of de
posites ni 1S34 and for fa 1ms to support it now He d' 1 not

when convinced of his erioi he was most cheerlul to retract

swept away by the voluntary action of the banks themst he?
No sir suthwas not his course He left the defence of such
a position to those who could s"e no difference between cound
specie paying banks, and banks which lefused to pay specie
upon their piomises between banks which promptly upon
demand fulfilled all their obligations to the public and tke

REMARKS OF MR. CALHOUN.
In Senate, October 3,1836 —In reply, on his amend-
ment to separate the Government from ihe banks
Mr Pri^idesi In reviewing this discussion, I
have been struck with the fact, that the argument
on the «ppoaile side has been limited, almost ex-
clusively, to the questions of rebel and the cuuen-
cy These are, undoubtedly, impoitant questions,
and well desemng the dehbeiateeonsisleration of the
Senate, but there aie olher questions involved in this
issue, of a far more <*leva*ed character and com-
manding control, and which more imperiously de-
mand our attention The binks have ceased to be
maie moneyed incorporations They have becc me
great political institutions with vast influence over
the welfare oí the communitj, so much so, that a
high'y distinguished Senator (Mi Clay) hasdeolared,
m his place that ihe question of the disunion of
the Government and tne banks involved m its con-
sequences the disunion of the Slates themselves
With this dcckiation sounding in our eats, it is
time to look into the origin of a system which
has already acquned such mighty mftucnci, to
inquire into the causes which have nroduced it, and
whethei they are still on the mere, se, in what they
wnl tenmnate, if leít to themselves, and, flrallv,
whether the system is favorable to the peimanenc}
of onr tree institutions, to the industry and business
of the countrj, and, above all, to the moral an j in-
tellectual development of the community I fiel
the vast impoitatice and magnitude of these topics,
as well as (heir great delicacy. I shall touch them
v.ith extreme reluctance, and only because I be-
lieve them to belon  to the occasion, and that it
would be a dereliction of public dutv to withhold
any opinion, which I hate deliberately formed, on
Ihe subject undei discus* on
The r ^e and progress of the bcinkm¿ sj stem is
one ol the most u-Mnaiktb'e «n 1 curious pb nomc-
non of modern times Its origin is modern and
humble, and gave no indication ol the extraordinary
growth and influence which it was destined to at-
tain It dates back to 1609, the year that the bank
of Amsterdam was established Other banking in-
stitutions pteceded it, but they were insulated, and
not immediately connected with the systems which
have since spiting up, and which may be dis-
tinctly traced to the Bank of Amsterdam. That
was a bank of deposite—a meie store-house—esta-
blished under the authority of that great commer-
cial metropolis, for the puiposc of safe Keep, igthe
prco ous inetals, and meditating the vast s\stem of
exchanges w hich then centeied there. The whole
system was (he most simple and beautiful that can
be imagined The depositor, on delivering his
bullion or coin in store, received a credit, estimated
at the standaid value on the books of the bink,
and a certifícale of deposite for the amount,
which was transferable from hand to hand,
and eutit'ed the holder to withdraw the deposite
on pa> ment of a moderate fee for the expense
and hazard of safe keeping These certificates
became, in fact, the circulatirg medium of the
community, perfoiming, as it were, the hazard and
drudgery, while the precious meta's, which they,
in truth, represented, guilder for gudder, lay quick-
ly in store, ttithout being exposed to the wear and
tear, or losses, mcidenta' to actual use It was
thus a paper currercy was created, having all the
sohdity, satety, and uniformity, of a metilhe, with
the facility belonging to thit of paper Tne whole
arrangemtnt was admirable, and v orthy ot the
strong sense and downright honest) of the people
with whom it originated
Out of thi« which may be called the first era of
ths system, giew the bank of deposit, discount, and
circulation—a great and mighty change, desaned
to effect a revolution 11 the condition of modern
societj 11 is not difficult to explain how the one
svatem should originate m the other, notwithstand
nigihe striking dissimilarity in features and charac-
ter between the offsmmg and the patent. A vast sum,
not less than thiee muhons 'teihns, accumulated
and remained habitually in deposite in the Bank of
Amsteitlam—tne place of the íeturned certificates
being constantly supplied bv new depositors Wi'h
so vast a standing deposite, it required but little re-
flection to peiceive, that a very large portion of it
might be withdrawn, and that a sufficient amount
would be still left to meet the returning cert ficaies;
o', w^at would be the same m effect, that an equal
amount of ficl.tious eeitificates might be issued be-
\ond the sum actually deposited. Eithev piocess,
'f interest be charged on the deposite withdrawn,
or the fictitious certificates issued, would be a near
approach to a bank ol discount This once seen,
it lequired but hule reflection to perceive, that the
same process would be equally applicable to a
capital placed in bank, as stock , and from that the
transition was easy to issuing bank note1, payable
on demand, on bills of exchange, oi promissoiy
noles, ha\ nig but a short time, to run These com-
bined, constitute ihe elements ol a bank of discount,
deposite and cue' lation.
Modem ingenuity and dishonesty wou'd not have
been long in perceiving and turmrg such advanta-
ges to account, but the faculty of the plain Be'-
gian was either too blunt to perceive, oi lus honesty
too stern to avail himscif of th m To his hi nor,
tl ere is reason to believe, notwithstanding the
temptation, the deposites were sacredl) kept, and
that for q\"\v cAiliucate in circulation, there was
■• ctnespoiidrng amount in bullion or coin in
sto'e It was i seiveu fo>- another people, either
more ingenious or less scrupulous, to make the
ch-inge
The Bank of England v. as i icorporated m 1694,
eighty five \ears after that of Amsterdam, and
was the first bank of depc si e, uiscount and circu-
lati >n. Its capital was ¿£1,200,000, consisting
wholly of Government stock, bearing an interest
of eight per cent per annum Its notes were re-
ceived in tie dues of th" Government, and the
public leveim  wis deposited in the batik It was
luthon/ d 'o emu "e exchequer bills, and make
loans to (.Tiuunment Let us pause for a mo-
ment and contemplate this complex and po ent
mat'nt , mdei ns \aiious c'i iacter and fune-
lons
As a bank of deposite, it was authorized to
receive deposites, not simply for safe keeping, to
be returned when demanded by the depositor, but
to be used and loaned out foi the benefit of the
institution, tare being taken alwajs to be provided
with the means of leturnmg an equal amount,
when demanded As a bank of discount and cir-
culation, it r=sued its notes on the faith ot its capi-
tal stock and deposites, or discounted bills of
exchange and promissoiy notes backed by respon-
sible endorsers, chaigmg an merest something
greatei th^n w is authorized b\ law to be chatged
on loans, and thus allowing it, for the use of its
ciedit, a higher late of compensation than what
individuals were authonzed to receive for the use
and hazard ot money or capital loaned out. It
will, pethaps, place this point in a clear light, if we
should consider the transaction m its true charac-
ter, not as a loan, but as a mere exchange of credit.
In discounting, the bank takes, in the shape of a
piomissory note, the credits oí an individual so
good that another, equally responsible, endorses his
no'e for nothing, and gnes out its credit in the
form oí a bank n¡ le The tiansaction is obviously
a mere change ot ciedi' If the drawer and
endorsers bieak, tie lo«s is tl e bank's, but if the
bai k bieaks, the loss tails on the commumU, and
yet tms tian«-aotion, so oissimiiai, is conrounded
with a loan, and the banks permitted to charge, on
a meie exchange ol credit, in which the hazard of
the bieaking of the d^awei andei doiseris incurred
bv the bink, and that of tne bank by the commu-
nity, a highei sum than the Icaal rate of interest on
a loan, m which, beside  the usa of his capital, the
hazard is all on the s£de of the lendei
Tuinmg from these to the advantages which it
deined from its coinection with the Government,
v e shall find them rot less striking Among the
first of these in urpcrtance is the fact of its notes
being "ecivcd in tne dues of the Government, by
which the «edit of the Government wa> added to
that of the bank, w hich added so greall to the
iiiciease or its cnculation These asa i, when
co lected b) the Government, were placed in depo-
site in the bank, ilms gumg to it not oni_, the profit

from the time of collection 111 disbursement, but
also that from the use of the public dep sues in the
