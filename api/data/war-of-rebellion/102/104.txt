LEAVENWORTH, April 15, 1865-1,30 p. m.

Major-General POPE:

On the 12th I received a telegram from General Dodge directing me, that in view of the threatened raid of Stand Watie, to remain in Kansas until the danger was past, and that orders would be telegraphed me from you, but I have as yet received no such telegraphic orders. Colonel Blair is in southwest part of the State with about 500 men. I received a dispatch from him on yesterday, in which he says there is no danger threatened. If Stand Watie has at any time been north of the Arkansas River he has returned again. I think there is no necessity for my remaining here longer for apprehended danger on the southern border of Kansas. Shall I proceed to Saint Louis in accordance with your telegram of the 7th instant?
