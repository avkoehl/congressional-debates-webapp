Independent Treasury—Mr. While.
H. of Reps.
of looking to the Government foi too much '   The throno has
become impatient with the "roans ol asuflering people      O,
the beneficence of modern Deimcricy'   How temier a regard
forpopularwinuandguei-.'     What an example of «ubui.s
«onto popular will, 'the lite blood ol a Republic "   Now, sii,
if this be all true, and it shall turn out, upon a tair examination,
that neither the paet or the present Administration, (which is
merely «supplementto the past, the present rulers being re
fponsrble for the misconduct  of both, us 1 shall demonstrate
before I have dona,) has had a>iy agency in brni^ ng íbout
the existing state ol things, I shall be, I acknowledge, most re
luctantly forced to the conclusion that the people, w th malice
prepense, without excuse or ap >logv, have been the cause of
their own ruin     But I shall rejuire  proof more clear, and
reasoning  mere forcible, than 1 have read in the elabordte
messa?esofthe President, or the still more elaboiate reports
olthe Secretary of the Treasury, or in the speeches ol the
supporters ofthe \dministration in this or the other branch of
Congress, before I will be compelled to this unwilling conclu
non     Why, sir, what does this explanation amount to?   It
remires itself into this    1 hat we hatea very wi«e and good
Administration,  but that wo are a very loolish and «icked
people—eelf ieatroyers— way ward beings— unkind and ungrate
tul constituent* opposing the measures and vilifying public
officers, whose whole studv and aim is our prosperity and
happiness, unalloyed by any selfish motives     Why, sir, if
these things all be true, 1 look upon our Chief Magistrate and his
tssociates in power as the most uniortunate ol men     But it
«eems.to me, this must be a pamfil admisión, a grievous
acknowledgment, for a  set of doting Democrats,    like our
Chief Magistrate and his fnend3      What, concede that the
ptep'e, the dear people, the intelligent, the virtuous peop'c,
ire not capable ot self governmtn', charge them with know-
ingly and willingly running headlong into the whirlpool of em-
barrassment, in despi e ol the admonitions and intercessions of
wi« and benevolence rulers     This doctrine strikes a death
b'nw at the vitals of Democracy     It establishes the supreme
folly ofthe sages and patriots ot the Revolution, who expended
their treasure, and poured  out their  blood, m erecting this
Government, based upon the fundamental principle that man
wis capable of self government.     It bhall be my purpose, fi r
i lew momenta, t  look into this matter    Federalist and aristo
crat as I am denominated, as well as all others, who question
the infallibility of the  powers that be, (by  the sell-styled
Democrats,)   I mteipose, as the advocate of sell government
It vindicate the people from this false and foul imputation
It shall be my purpose, in a very concise manner, to prove
that our difficulties both public and private are maimy, if not
entirely, jusJy ascribab'e U the policy-of the past and present
Administration;   to  the  violent aid lawless assaults upon
useful,necessary, and well tried insiuulons      The unceasing
tinkering with the currency, and commerce, is ínsepaiable
handmaid, violating and destroying all he approved and esta
b'ished principles and laws of both, abusing the highest pre
roiajveof the Government, the currency power ol the Con-
•Ltuuoi, using it as a privileged weapon, ol political capita],
prosutuung il to the selfish and sordid purpose of party profit,
and party aggrandizement,  reckless of the destruction  of
thousands and tens of thousands who fell victims of credulity,
to the mserable humbugs that were kept unceasme y dancing
before their eyes, recommended and endorsed l v the Executive
and his leading suppoittrs, with the most extravagant asouran
ees of sound policy and permanent su cess
Now, Mr. Chairman, to expljJe tins fine theory of the
President's to the satisfaction ot you and ail o her believers in
his infallibility, it is only necessary to call your attention to
certain parts of the annual message, communicated to Con
«res  the present session. After three year ln'ense and pro-
found study of finance, and commerce, the President has dis-
covered that his confident speculations of '37 on the embar-
rassments of the country were all a mistake, altogether a
superficial view of the subject. The President having turned
bu a ten Hon to the investigation of the profound mysteries of
trade, exchange, credit and fi lance, wun a confidence un-
wtveiing, and a satisfaction associated wi h self congratulation^
infolds to Congress and the country, fie unsuspected and un
discovered cause ofthe umveisal suspension ol our ban^s, in
1S37, the embarrassment ol the finances, and the universal
derangement of commerce and business ol all kinds He traces
l.wiih a clearness, as he savs, that puts to rest all dispute,
that the radical, fundamental cause is to be found in the de
pendence of the trade, exchange, baikmg system, and credit
system of this country, upon the ' money power" in Gieat
Bntato,—the Bank of England The President in his message
undertakes, in his way, to anatomize the principles and lav>s
of trade, exchange and credit, and b.) satisfactory are the re
nllsof Ins examination, to hisown mind, that be concludes n
must be an admitted axiom, now and hear ..after in the science
of poitxal economy— that such is the indissoluble connection
between the commerce and banking system of this country
and the commerce and banking system of Great Britain, that
the prosperity of trade, the solidity of he currency and credit
of the United States, is ostered, cherished and supported by the
ftrbearance and smiles, and can be blighted and destroyed by
the frowns or nod "f the "money power of Great Britain, the
Bank of England " That such is the natural link of con
necuou,between the banks, currency trade and credit of this
country, with with the money powei of Eng'and, that her influ-
ence over all these essential and vital interests—vi al to our
prosperity as a people—vital to oui liberty as a free nation
—is absolute, supreme, omnipotent If tins be true, we are in
a mest deplorable condition, it is positively humiliating to
the mind of every patriot, andas tins theory swallows up the
previous speculations of the President and has received the
solemn endorsement—the fulsome laudation of several dis-
tinguished followers ofthe President in both branches of Con-
fess. "This sober second thought" deserves examination It
Botbeiog my lot to be one of the believers in the infallibility of
** President, upon questions of currt ncy and finance, I am
dtoosed to doubt the correctness of his concl usions I go fur-
ther, I say their fallacy is exposed, broadly contradicted by ex-
perience, the mother of true wisdom m nuance and trade by
pUin and indisputable historic farts, Let history speak upon
the (abject. In 1791, we had in this country several State banks,
•ad a United Staea Bank, a commeice with England and the
world. The Bank of England had ex sted a century, just, in
JJ94, when it suspended specie payments, by order of the
Pnvy Council, and continued suspended for twenty-eight suc-
J** f* years, by acn of restriction esacted by Parliament,
in the mean time our commerce continued prosperous, with
 l>«ht revulsions, with England and the world    Our National
B i k felt noshock ftom the suspension ofthe Bank of England
—live money poner of Great Britain, it continued without inter
rup ion, to lei'cem its notes in gold and silver, feeding com-
mer< e and receiving support fh return—aiding our finances for
twenty v i ars, the lite of its charter. The State banks vastly
increascdin the mean time, with now an then an exception, pre-
serving their currency sound, redeeming their paper in specie.
This binigs u-> down in the history Oi this country lo the yeai
Ibll, when the Bank ofthe United States expires by the limita
tions of its charter—Congress refuses a re chatter State bonks
are multiplied, preserve their credit, as asvstcm, redtem their
notes in gold and silver, unttl by the disasters and calamities
olwar, a portion are forced to suspend, the suspens on only
partial In 1816, a new United States Bank is established for
twenty years, goes into operation in 1817, by the aid of
the United States Bank, the generous aid of the General
Government, the State Banks, in a body, rise and pay specie
The United States Bank and State banks preseve their credit
fuinibh a sate and sound circulating medium, redeem their
notes in gold and silver, without an hour's suspension until
the month of May 1837—twenty longyears The Bank of
England continuing suspended until 1828 This great central
money power, around which all other money powers resolve,
according to the recent discovery of our learned Chief Magis
trate Now, sir, in the lace of these plain historic facts known
oi should be known, to every tyro in political economy, the
President, this modern Turgot, gravely tells Congress, the coun
try, and the civilized world, that this nation has not now, nor is
it in the power of Government to create, a sound paper currency,
such is the degraded dependence of trade, currency, exchange,
and credit of this country, upon the money power of Great
Britain—the Bank of England Thatasuspei sion, yeaanunfa
vorable breath, from this moneyed monster, strikes our com
merce with a paralysis, and explodes our currency Su, the
naked historic facts 1 have briefly enumerated, not only refutes
the flimsy sophism ofthe message, but they establish, as far
as long tried experience can establish the truth of any proposi
Hon, that there exists a power in this Governmont, a sale power,
a beneficial power, to create acunency, that defies the money
power of Great Britian and the world to impair its uniformity oi
affect its solidity.
Mr Chairman, having laid bare the policy ofthe boasted
"second thought" of the President, not by flat denial, not by
counter theory or speculation, or argument of my ow n, but by
the use of better weapons, plain, indisputable, unvarnished his-
torical truths I now return to the theory ol 1837 This deserves
critical analysis, not fer its profundity, but because ofthe high
authority reflected by official station That the overtrading,
overbanking, and overspeculaling, enumerate J by the Pre1* dent
in his inessige of 183?, as the causes ofthe embarrassment and
distress that then afflicted the country were the Immedia'e
opeiating causes no one doubts, no one disputes, every candid
man concedes the position But this admission doe« not at all
meet the mqniry, it is altogether superficial, it does not prove
the question to the bottom, it isa surface view The question
still recurs, what produced this overtrading, overbanking, over
speculating? What where the "antecedent causes that stimula-
ted" all this, so modestly hinted at, so softly touched, m> dell
cately broached, bv the President in the same paragraph In
the language of the gentleman from Illinois (Mr Reynolds)
"here hangs the law and the prophets " The cause , enu
merated by the Piesident, were nothing, but the irresistible
effectsof primary causes It is due then to truth, ami a fan
understanding of this question, to look deepennto tins subjeit,
tiace through these secondary causes, to the "antecedent"
causes, the fountain—the root of the evil I n~>w propose
to prosecute this inquiry I have already said that the
embarrassment and distress was attributable lo the measures
and policy of the past and Ipresent Administrations This is
my humble opinion was the cause; cause abundantly sufficient,
cause fully adequate to the effect; sound philosophy requires
no further assignment of caures I now piopose to establish
my position A trne, succinct, and intelligible summary of the
causes may be stated in the follow in* manner —
First. The embarrassment and distress have grown out of
overtrading and over speculating Second The overtrading
and overspeculating have mainly proceeded from overbanking
Third The overbanking was engendered by the desti ucuon of
the United States Bank and the removal ol the public deposites,
coupled with the existence of a large surplus m the National
Treasury, which enabled the State deposite banks to increase
their discounts fifty millions Fourth This excessive surpl us
was derived altogether frorr the sales of the public lands
filth. The extraordinaiy sales ofthe public lands, by the
unwise policy of rushing the most choice lands into market
treble as fastas the demand for cultivation required, stimu-
lated by the facilities furnished speculators from the deposite
banks S xth These facilities are derived from the instruc-
tions of the President and the (Secretary to grant loans freely to
supply the vacuum pro I jced by the withdrawal of the branches
of the United States Bank This ismy humble judgment is a
fair summary ofthe causes of the embarrassment and distress
in 1837 But for auxiliary causes, causes for which the Ad
ministration were equally responsible, the catastrophe might
have been postponed. The suspension poss bly would have
been only partial, but for the adoption of other Government
measures I doubt not but the manner of executing the
deposite act, coupled with tfce pernicious effect of the specie
wreular, upon the currency, banks anduade of the country,
hastened the suspension, a catastrophe unavoidable and in
dependent of these collateral causes,
Now, Mr Cahirman, to the proof in support ofthe foregoing
propositions The first and second propositions being admitted
truths, conceded on all hands, they stand as axioms in the con-
troversy The third proposition ¡i controverted, flatly con
trad cted in this debate, and the responsibility a'tempted to
be thrown upon the shoulders if the Opposition It is an im-
portant proposition, «.demands calm and iooI inquiry and con-
sideratun, in fact it is the gist ofthe wholematter. When we
havese'tled who caused the immense increase of bank capital,
and the excessive issues, we have fixed the sin of responsibility
for the afflictions of this country upon the proper shoulders. I
proceed to establish my view of the subject by history and
figures The chartsrof the Bank of the United States did not
expire by its limitation until March, 1636, yet the past Admi
nietration opened hostilities upon it early as 1829 I do not in-
tend here to stop and go into the reasons of this premature
assault, though that it was purely political, is susceptible of
proof satisfactory to any upiejudiced mind The war upon the
bank programed with unabatable fury until 1832, Congress
passes a bill of «charter, the President vetoed th  bill.   In 1683
Congress passed a resolution declaring the Bank sound, and,
the public deposites secure in its vaults, the President, by Ex-
ecutive order, the same year, commanded the removal of the
deposites March, 1836, the rSiarter expired, the Bank went
out of existence This is the L istory ofthe United States Bank
from 185;9 to 1836 Now, s r, let u* look into the history ofthe
State banks for the same period First, their number in 1829;
second, their increase up to 1837, third, the mercase of their
capital, fourth, the increase of circulation, fifth, depositee,
liabilities on bills and deposites; and see what light cold statis-
tics will shed upon this much disputed subject On the first
of January in the following } " rs, the condition of the State
bunks was as follows —

By this tab e, Mr Ch-irman, which is accurately taken from
the various reports ol the Secretary of the Treasury, it appears
that, in the short space of seven years, commenci ig wun the
first year of the past Administration and the declaration of war
upon the United States Bank, end ending with the destruction
ol that institution, the numbei ol Sate banks doubled—their
capital more than doubled—their loans trebled—their circula-
tion   trebled—their liabilities on bills and deposites trebled
I now offer the statistics to the committee, lo establish the
fourth proposition, which, toge her with tb* fifth and sixth,
arc only corollaries ofthe third.—

The table I have just read establishes conclusively, the4th pio-
position It is accurately compiled from the different reports
of the Secretary of the Treasury I have read ihis table lor a
double iiurpose 1st To sufain the proposition as connected
with this subject 2d To ex rlodc an error that has insinuated
it°eif into the head of many Southern politicians That the
surplus revenue in the lreasury,surhafnghtful source of evil,
has arisen from the tariff of '28 A perfect delusion, nothing
more fallacious, n  trnthin it. figures contradict it Nothing
but an omission totxamine tfce statistics, ever could have im-
pressed u pon the mm J of any one, so erroneous a conclusion.
My 5th pioposmon is fully Maintained by the tables I have
read 1 now ask the attention of the committee to the evidence
in support of the 6th proposmrn This is an important pro-
position, in the prosecution oi this mjuiry I intend to make
it clear bejondquibble, >>oldlyand unblubhingly as it hds been
denied on this fi or, in the progress of this debate I hope the
committee will im'uleeme somewhat in detail upon this point.
Tins question of who caused the excessive issues, I intend to
place beyond any cavil I read m the first place from the
mamle8toof t e President in 1833, speaking upon the subject
of the removal of the deposites, he says "The funds of the
Government Mil not be annihilated by being transferred, they
will immediately be issued for the benefit of trade, and if the
Bank ofthe United States curtails us loans, the State banks,
strengthened  by the depositee1, will exterd theirs "
Again, uponthispomt I now rtad from the msiructmnjQfMr .
Taney, whilst Secretary ol the Treasury, IrMHrtlHI élflfllerthe
order removin  the deposites in '33 On the 9 h ot October,
Mr Taney wrote as follows to the deposite basks throughout
the country, commarding them to open their vaults to the
people This is bis emplial'C langoare" 'The depwittsóf tie
public money will enable you to afford increased faeHWee to
the commercial and other classes ofthe community; and the
Department anticipatesfrom you the adoption of such a course
respecting your accommodations, as will prove acceptable
to the people and safe to the Government " But, eir, 1 hold
in my hand testimony of>nuch more recent date—testimony
that comes directly home to the present Chief Magistrate and
h s Secretary It is a shot t letter, 1 will read the whole of it.
It speaks voiumes upon this point, and cot only upon this
point, it sheds a flood of light upon other points, v tally
maU-iial in this discussion    I will read the letter
' Treasury Department, January 29th, 1837
"In selecting > our institution as one of the fiscal agents of tbe
Government, I need only rely on its solidity as affording a
sufficient guarantee for the safety of the public money en-

towards oiher institutions The deposite of the public money

Now, sir, I must analyze this letter     Thera are some re-
markable features in it, though it is written with much brevity.
In the first place, I call the attention of the committee to the
date—dates are «otnctimss all nrportant—Jan 29, 1839, three
short months before the susprnsior-    The universal explosion,
subsequent, (as I will Ehow, in *he covrse of my remarks, before
I have done,) to a conversafion of the President and a dig-
distinguished Senator, in which they agree, there must very
shortly be an explosion, at atirae when there was fifty million*
of public monej s in these deposite banks       Another remarka.
ble feature in this epistle, it is to be found in the concluding
sentence.   Compare it with the last sentence in the Secretary
Taney's—verb ard letter, the tame     It would seem from tbl*
exact phaseology, in the material part of these letter*, that from
Oct  '33, one short month after the order for tbe removal of U 
deposites, the department kept a form of instruction  to these
banks, commanding free dweonnts    Such an order seems to
„  hav e become a part of the official duty ofthe Secretary,   with
M all th«M evidences, evidence* indleputed and indispu'able,
