find to my surprise that I am taken from an independent position to be placed in a subordinate one. The change cannot be regarded by the public in any other light that of a censure and a degradation. I beg you to let me take General Wool's command as it was, with instructions to send to General McClellan all the troops I can spare.

JOHN A. DIX,

Major-General.
