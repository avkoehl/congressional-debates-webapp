JOHN SPELMAN, Raleigh, N. C.:

Seward willing to acept Rice's proposition for Territories. Fugitive slave law to be enforced and uncosntitutional personal libery laws repealed. Invasion of States to be punished by law. Constitutional guarantee for slavery in States. Evidently disposed to settle, but proposition not satisfactory to South. Thinks war inevitable from dissolution.
