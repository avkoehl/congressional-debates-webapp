HDQRS. SECOND DIV., TWENTY-FIRST ARMY CORPS,DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,

February 6, 1863-8 p.m.

COLONEL: In reply to note of Lieutenant Stone, acting assistant adjutant-general, received an hour since at these headquarters, addressed to General Palmer, I will say that the records of the division adjutant's office do not contain data for an accurate statement of the effective force of this command, which went into the actions of 31st December and 2nd ultimo. I am able to make an approximate statement only (in time limited by the note for reply), which is presumed to be substantially correct. One of the brigades of this divisions is at Readyville and another at Cripple Creek, and it is impossible to communicate with them without the lepse of some hours.

General Palmer has been absent since the 31st ultimo, and may have such statement among his private papers, which I have not examined.

The following, I think, nearly correct. It is as near as can be arrived at from figures here:

Brigades. 	 Commanding	 Effective	 Effective

 officers	 strength	 strength

 	 December 31.	 January 2.

First	 General Cruft	 1,207	 801

Second	 Colonel Hazen	 1,385	 975

Third	 Colonel Grose	 1,768	 1,139

Total 	 	 4,360	 2,915

A more accurate statement can be furnished upon giving time to regimental commanders.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, yours, &amp;c.

CHARLES CRUFT,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

C. GODDARD, Lieutenant Colonel and Asst. Adjt. Gen.
