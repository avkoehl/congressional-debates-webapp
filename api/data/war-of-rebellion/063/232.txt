HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE MISSOURI,Saint Louis, Mo., April 19, 1864.

Brigadier-General FISK:

See Colonel Williams, who is in command of the Seventh Military District, Enrolled Missouri Militia, at Saint Joseph. It is proposed to reorganize the militia; that is just what we wish to do. New companies and regiments can be formed; it would be impracticable, as well as almost impossible, to resuscitate the old organizations. Commissaries of exemption are authorized to muster in new companies and will see General Rosecrans about it.

JOHN BB. GRAY,

Adjutant-General of Missouri.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF NORTH MISSOURI,Saint Joseph, Mo., April 19, 1864.

JOHN B. GRAY, Adjutant-General of Missouri:

It is the intention to have all the militia organized. You will remember that the old Twenty-fifth and Forty-first Enrolled Missouri Militia were disbanded. The men of those regiments will very reluctantly enroll to be assigned to the Paw Paw companies. I believe it would be primitive of peace and good order in this section to reorganize this disbanded militia at once. I will superintend the reorganization myself. The enrollment is progressing very slowly. Put the whole thing in my hands to manage, under your orders, and I will push it through with speed and safety. Please reply at once, as my headquarters are besieged by committees from all the counties in the northwest.

CLINTON B. FISK,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF NORTH MISSOURI,Saint Joseph, Mo., April 19, 1864.

Lieutenant-Colonel DRAPER, Macon City, Mo.:

I have just received the following telegram from Major-General Rosecrans:

Jackman, the bushwhacker, is at the house of the ex-sheriff of Howard County, 20 miles northwest of Glasgow, with 15 or 20 desperado companions. You must with all dispatch and secrecy and with ample force fall upon them; let none escape. Sharp and secret must be your motto.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.

Major Leonard must move sharply and secretly on Jackman and party. I hope for the greatest success.

Captain WEST,

Enrolling Officer, Com. of Exemptions, Andrew Co., Mo.:

CAPTAIN: I desire that you promptly and cheerfully, as I know you will, assist the unorganized militia at Savannah and in Andrew
