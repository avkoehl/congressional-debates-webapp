1839.
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
HI
would at once, at the close of tins session, return
back to the people the trust I hold, to be con-
ferred by them accoidmg to their pleasure But
n the long inteival to ensue before anothei elec
tion in that Stite, very calamitous íesults might,
in my appiehension, attend an immediate íesig
nation Every man knows that a most import-
ant political struggle is now going on in the land,
piegn int, as all admit, with the most interesting
consequences Each paityis full of hope, and
expects victory in the issue Afcathei may turn
the scale The diminution of force on one side,
or a slight accession on the other, may decide
the contioversy And shall I cast a feather into
the scale of my adveisanes' It is my duty to
stand heie, and do my utmost in advancement of
those principles which I hold sacied It is my
duty, if for no other icason but to keep those out
who would certainly be sent in my place I know
there are many men of both pames in North
Carolina who are bettei qualified than myself to
fill this station But of the many able sons ot
North Caiohnawho diffci with me in political
opinions, and for whom 1 have the highest pel
sonal respect, I should leluctantly see any one
heie at the piesent moment Those who sent
me heie, thtieforc, h ive a right to e\pti t that I
will maintain my ¡ost, unless duven irom it by
some paiamount pimciple, and that I do notaban
don it in a cowardly mannei, upon the occunence
of the first difficulty Iheie is but one gicatand
paramount principle which can b< foi a moment
snpposi d to demand my lesignation and that is
the doctune of instiuction Upon thitdoctune
my colleague ha  fully and ably enlaigfd
Am I, then, byanycieed upon tint subject,
placed m a situation to lender m / its, gnation a
duty' Of the political paity of \ Inch a majouty
of those who voted foi these if s >lutioi s comsti
tute a part, it is a pimciple that theie is no light
in the Legislature to instiuet, and, consequently ,
no obligation on the pait of the Stnitoi cithei to
obey 01 lesign No com, ldint, then fore, can be
made by them of nr y eouise which we m ly think
piopei to adopt Of the political paity to which
I have been attack d, the cu d is to be found in
Mi Leigh's celebiated íepoit in the Vngmia
Legislatuie, and in the uniform piactite ot all
those Legisiatuies who have attempted any effi-
cient action m Federal affairs In the document
before mentioned it is said, " Si nators aie in-
structed, and Repiesentatives requested," and it
goes on to give the reason foi this difference of
language, that over the one a right to command
is claimed, and towards the other the meie tendel
of a<fvi( t In the one case, they may assume to
declue the popular will in the language piopei to
the expiession of will—command, and whin so
expitsscd, it must stand fot that will, whether
íeally so oi not In the other, then command
does not stand foi the populai will, and the re
sponsibility still tests u) on the Ilepiesmutive to
find out what it is This  dim íeiice of language
has been uniformly used, so fai as I am able to
loam, in all rcsoktions ulopted by Legislatures
of tne different States, whenever they have at
tempted any direct action in Fnleial alian s They
have assumed that the LegisKtuie is íecognized
as embodying the populai will of the State, so fai
as Senatois aie concerned, whenever they think
pioper to use language appropriate to the uttei-
ance of will But whenever they adopt on'ysuch
language as they may with pi opi irty use to a
Representative, in addressing then Senatois, it is
not intended to be more opeiottve upon the one
than the other In the one case, they themselves
assume the lesponsibihty, and stand between the
Senator and the people of the State In the other,
they do not undeitake to uttei the public will,
but while they suggest, leave the publ c servant
to judge of that will upon hisown lesponsibihty
Such has been the obvious understanding of all
the preceding Legislatures of Noith Carolina, who
have undertaken to address their agents m this
body í rom their eailiest action, down to 1834,
when the resolutions were passed commanding
the act now denounced as unconstitutional, and
dictated by party servility, they used this pecuhai
phraseology Language consists nuiely of the
signs, which, by common consent, have been u
ceived as representing particulai ideas Technical
language frequently differs from common lan-
guage By common consent, the word mstiuc
turns has received a technical signification, when
used in an address by the Legislatuie of a State
to its Sen itors in Congiess These facts vtsere all
known to the Legislatuie of North C-uohna, which
passed the icsolutions under consideration
Was, then, the omission of the woid uniformly
used by the Legislatures heretofore, when they
designed direct action uponiheu Senatois, an ac-
cidental oi whimsical omission merely, and was
it intended oi believed that those used would be
coefficient' I have not the slightest idea that it
was In the fiist place, the known belief of many
who voted for these resolutions that the Legisla-
ture has no light to instiuet Senators, and con-
sequently that there is no obligation on Senators
to obey, foibids the idea They could not have
intended what they believed they had no right to
do Such a suspicion would, I am peisuaded,do
them great injustice The pjst conclusion is, that
they meant to do just what they have done—the
expiession of their belief that public opinion is
what they set forth in those resolutions to be their
own opinions, believing, most justly, that while
they had nougbttocommand,then opinions would
be mostiespectfully consideied by their Senators
The omission of the woid " instructions" was
designed And why* Because it wats well known
that a pecuhai force and signification was attached
to it, and an opeiation given to it which they did
not appiove, and theiefore did not wish to sanc-
tion by its use That the omission was designed
is fuithei proved by the fact, which is a mattei of
histoiy, that in both Houses a proposed amend-
ment by its lnsemon was rejected But to place
the mattei beyond all doubt, my colleague and
myself addressed a joint lettei to the Legislatuie
—not inquiiing what effect they intended their
resolutions to have, not implying a doubt which
I we did not entertain—but openly declaimg what
we firmly believed, that we should not hold them
as inductions, at the same time declaimg our
purpose to obey or lesign, should we beinstiucted
This lettt r was written in the most peifectsm-
centy and good faith I caie not who may think
pi oper to question it I can appeal to God and
my own conscience for my truth
But it is also known to fueuds heie, to whom
I declared my determination to lesign if my con-
stiuction of the resolutions was pioiiouiicedeiio-
neous It was not so pionounced We received
no answei to oui commumcuion The vindica
tion oí my sinceuty in addiessing that letter,
theiefoie, presents a strong consideiaiion against
íesignation If I resign now, it may be justly
said that when I wrote my letter to the Legisla-
tuie! consideied these icsolutions is instructions,
in the fací of my dfelaiation to the contraiy,and
am now boi no down by the weight of my convic-
tion I still think, us I thought then, that they
are not instructions eithei in fact or accoidmg to
the intention of most of those who voted foi them,
and so believing, the alternative of obedience or
| íesignation is not pioscnted to me Is there, then, I
I any obligation upon me toiesign ' Does any hu- |
| man being peiceive any' AVho can point it out5 i
I Peifect obtdience is out of tne question It foi
1 lows, tlnn, in my judgment, that foi the present
! it is my duty to lemun here, and, while I do not
treat the icsolutions as instructions, 1 will show
them all due íespeCt and give to them such mfiu
ence ovei mv conduct as myjudgment may ap
| pi ove I have said that had the Legislatuie met
during the ensuing yeai, I would iei>i.rii at the
I close of tins session, but it is still my pui pose to
afford the sovereign people of Noith Caiohna the
earliest opportunity of deciding the mipoitant
question, by what class of politicians they choose
to be repiesen ted in this body The Legislatui e,
at its fiist biennial session, shall have an oppoi
tunity of selecting for the seat 1 fill a Demociat
or a Federalist one who thinks it right to wipe
off the foul and unjust stigma cast upon the fame
of Andrew Jackson, or one who is foi perpetu-
ating it through all generations 1 his they will
have an opportunity of doing, under a fair ex-
pi ession of popular sentiment, and to the people of
Not th Carolina will I cheerfully submi t the issue
Mr CLAY, of Kentucky, contended that these
íesolufions were neither mdecoious noi disie-
spectful
Mr STRANGD said he made no allusion to
disiespectful language
Mt CLAY said he understood at least one of
the Senators to say that one of the resolutions
was disrespectful to the Senate
Mr BROWN said he spoke of one of the res-
olutions, but, emanating as they did from the
Legislatuie of his State, in no possible contin-
gency could he have refused -to piesent them
Mr CLAY said, if theie was mdecorum, it
was his duty, under the rules of the Senate, not
to piesent the «solutions
Mr BROWN said there was a very marked
difference between the Legislature of a sovereign
btate and individuals on this subject.
Mr CLAY said he was not aware there was
any such distinction in the rules, and if the Le-
gislature of a State uses disrespectful language,
it is no more to be received than if it were from
a private citizen.    But the Senators gave as a
reason for not complying with the resolutions of
the Legislature, that they did not contain the
word " instruct "   He thought it was infinitely
moie respectful to those íeceiving the instruc-
tions, not to use the woid " mstiuct "   Sir, sup-
| pose I say to my man Charles, " please bring me
1 my boots or shoes " he does it with alactity.
But if I should say, " Charles, I instiuet you to
bring me my boots," he would think it strange
j language, and veiy probably would ask me for
I an explanation     Mr  C   said, while the Sena-
I tors expressed then disinclination so strongly to
I obeying these instiuetions, they seemed  alto-
gether to oveilook that there was an alternative
presented to them—that of resignation
Mi STRANGE replied, that he certainly felt
much indebted to the Senator from Kentucky
[Mr Clay] for the advice he had keen profier to
volunteer on the present occasion But it had
been very long since it had been his wont to look
for political infoimation from that quarter. On
the contraiy, he viewed the Senatoi from Ken-
tucky, with all his talents, lather as a beacon than
a guide, and when a course was indicated by him,
geneially (onsideied it a leason for shunning,
rather than pursuing it It was not, therefore,
to be consideied at alt remarkable if his sugges-
tions, on the present occasion, should have but
little weight lhe Senatoi is pleased to say that
he considers my complaint, that I have neither
favor nor justice to expect fiom my political op-
ponents, a little gratuitous No man knows bet-
tei where the shoe pinches than he who wears it
The Senatoi knows nothing of the ground upon
which this complaint is made, and has, therefore,
no right to say whethei it is giatuitous or not.
He (Mr S ) had said, that sad experience had
warned him not to expect either favor or justice
from his political opponents—and he said so truly.
And now that the Senatoi had somewhat forced
it upon him, he would remaik, that no man had
shown more comity or defeience to his political
opponents than himself, and yet not only the
scumlous paitisan newspapers of the country,
but even by those with whom he had exchanged
the courtesies of life, and fiom whom hehad parted
with the giasp of friendship, had his motives
been assailed and his conduct impeached With
such fads befoie him, he might well say that he
could expect neither favoi nor justice from his
political opponents The Senatoi from Ken-
tucky, with an unfairness and coarseness which
he had not thought altogether becoming, had ob-
i served, that in lemaiking upon the impractica-
bility of obedience, he (Mr S ) and his colleague
seemed to have ovei looked anothei alternative,
I and that was lesignation Now, unless the Sen-
ator's senses were less acute than usual, he must
have heard both him and his colleague very dis-
I tinctly advert to that altei native, and himself to
decíate that were he at hbeity to act in obedi-
j ence to his own feelings, he would resign, but
that, undei present circumstances, a. hi^h sense
of duty to those who ¡sent him here compelled
him to remain
The Senator from Kentucky then takes up the
doctrine of instruction, and, according to his
wont in the absence of argument and leason, at-
tempts to dnve us fiom our position by railery
and jest, and for that puipose paiades before us
that evet favorite and fertile theme, his man
i Charles, and entei tains the Senate with a dialogue
between himself and that distinguished peisonage.
But his illustration has no application to the sub-
ject There is no parity between the lelationship
subsisting between the sovereignty of a State and
its íepiesentative upon this floor, and that between
the Senatoi and his slave He was tiie servant
of the people of North Carolina, but not their
