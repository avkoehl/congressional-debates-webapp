CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
he said on yesterday, and called upon the gentle-
man from Massachusetts (Governoi Lincoln) to
<=ay whether Dutee J Pearce had not admitted m
presence of Colonel Campbell and himself that
Hallett had drawn up the report, and that tne
notes, were furnished him by Abijah Mann and
Mr Pearce himself
Mi LINCOLN stated that Mr Pearce had ad-
mitted, in a personal conversation, that he was not
the author of the report, and more than this, that,
npon reflection, he disapproved of its language
He would slate further, that he believed whatever
had occurred of an unpleasant character m that
committee, was in consequence of the action of
that agent, m connection with some persons not on
the committee He was bound, however, in can-
dor, to say that when the majontv of the committee
ascertained the language m which that report was
drawn up, it was as severely reprobated by them
as by the membeis of the minority
Mr. WISE hoped that the statement w Inch he
had made was so fully corioborated, as to make it
peifectlv satisfactory to every gentleman w ho heard
him He would leave it to the House, to eveiy
gentleman m the House, and to e\ery person in the
countij, whether he was to be reproved for telling
a truth, tor stating that which must be looked upon
by every person as ti ue, and which was not denied
by the gentleman from Pennsylvania himself, and
he had stated this truth upon the authonty of Du-
tee J Pearce himsdf If it was offensive to the
chaiactei of Dutee J Pearce, he himself was th.°
author of ¡t He (Pearce) was the authority he
had for stating that Hallett, the clerk of the com-
mittee, wrote the report of the majority He beg-
ged leave to say to the gentleman from Pennsylva-
nia, that he entertained the highest respect for his
heart He had the greatest respect for the gentle-
man's food heait, but he must say to him that if
ever he was put upon another committee of inves-
tigation, and did not discharge his duties on that
committee somewhat differently, and a little better,
than he did last wintei, and take particular care that
the report he is called upon to sign is his own, or
that it contains his sentiments, he could not enter-
tain any very great respect for his head
[Mr Muhlenbbrg presented his respects to the
gentleman for his good opinion ]
Mr W knew that the clerk of the committee
had a spell of sickness, and that Doctor Sewall
at! nded him He knew it lrom his pallid counte-
nance, when he r< turned to the committee room,
and from the fc/er blistcis on his lips, but this was
at a time when the c< mmitlee weie not prepared to
make any report, and when he could not be engaged
in writing it, as there was no maieuals furnished
for pioceedmg m  that business     But some time
a'teiuaid  he was again absent foi several dajs__a
w eek, peihaps, w hen he u as not confined bj actual
smkne s, as he believed A portion of the time
members of the committee performed the duties,
and at length a inembci of the majority introduced
a tesolutmn to employ an assistant clerk, and an
assistant was employed, who did all the duties, and
received but four dolíais a day, whde the other,
who was absent, received eight dollars a day
Mr W then went into a detailed account
of the occurrence m the committee room at the
tune the report of the majority was brought in Near
th" close ot the session of Congress he gave notice
to the committee that he should expect a repon to
be prepared in the course oí some few days, and a
day was appointed lor the labors of the committee
10  cease On the Monday previous to the adjourn-
ment if Congress, he inquired if therepoit of the
inajonty was ready He was answered no On
J. uesday he again made the inquiry, and received
ti e same answer but on Wednesday the report
came m A member of the maionty (Mr Mann
ofNewYoik) commenced reading it, when Col
Campbell mqiuwd if it could be amended He
(Mr W ) consideied that it was subject to amend-
ment A discussion arose upon the question wheth-
er any portion could be stricken out, and after
some time spent in discussion, the majority
determined that they would read it through, and
mark the objectionable passages, and then take up
11   question whether it was m order to stnke an>
1 ->rtion of it out.   Coi, CampelJ then took pen m
hand, while Abijan Mann lead the report, and took
notes of the ofTens ve paity until he filled nearly
half a page when they came to a whole paragraph,
whuh was of the most oilensive character Mr
Campbell said " draw a line round that, mark it,
expunge it," and he immediately rose fiom his
seat, and slapped his hand on the table, and uttered
an oath which occasioned him (Mr W ) to call
him to order. The Colonel then said to Mi.
Mann " Sir, I warn you that the man who dares
to present that report to the House, filled as it is
with falsehoods and lies, I will hold responsible to
me personallj, and if he don't hold himself respon-
sible, I will chastise him " He then locked the
door of the committee room, put the key m his
pocket, and swore that not an individual should
leave that room until those infamous falsehoods
weie expunged
He would do the gentleman from Pennsj lvama
the justice to say, that when the leport was read he
rose and said to Mr Pearce that he did not believe
the report to be the truth, but that it was filled with
falsehood The minouty of the committee then re-
tired—the majority having determined to strike out
the offensive parts—leaving them to pursue their
labor of evpungmg ihose portions, and then
Hallett had the insolence to complain that they had
stiuck out the only parts which gave it point He
would, however, do the justice to the gentleman
from Pennsj lvama to say, that he did not believe
that the gentleman knew that Hailett wrote the re-
port It will be recollected it was on Wednesday
that the íepoit was piesented, and on the next Fri-
day Congress adjourned No discussion arose in
the House on the subject, or he would have made
the statement which he now made, for, Rowland oi
Olivei, no human being, though he were but a
worm in spirit and in strength, could fear
Dutee J Pearce You could only fear him
when yout charactei might be attainted with his
company You could only fear mm as .you would
a micjnight assassin oi a thief In relation to
another pait of the statement of the gentleman
from Pennsylvania, m relation to the report of the
minouty The three members of the minouty had
no opportunity of consulting m relation to the re-
poit, as their time was entirely taken up, and it
was not tobe expected that they would blindly
=ngn his report, w íthout any opportunity to compare
their statements and papers, and he considered that
the two gentlemen of the minority were perfectly
justified m notsigning it But a general report was
diannup, and tint report they all did sign He
would tike this occasion to state to the gentleman
fiom Pennsylvania, that there never was any dif-
ficulty in relation to his (Mr W's) ipport, as it
never was lead in committee He did to be sure take
Mr Mann aside at his own i equest, and read to him
that pait which related to that gentleman personally
There was language in that report which, perhaps,
a person of a different temperament would con-
demn, but theie was not a letter in it which he was
not the authoi of There was not a cross on a (,
or a dot over an t, which was not his own, whether
w oi thy or unworthy, propel orimproper Governor
Lincoln and General Campbsll had not the oppor-
tunity to aid in drawing it up, and it could not be
expected of them blindly to sign it He hoped he
had disposed of this subject now and for ever Mr
W then replied to the remarks of the gentleman
fiom Maryland, (Mr Howard) in relation to the
reference of the subject to the Committee on Mili-
taiy Affairs. Theie were nine members on that
committee,among whom was to be found but one sin-
gle oppos Uon man, the other eight being friends and
supporters of the administration His friend from
South Carolina (Mr Thompson) was the only one
of the nine who was not a supporter of the adminis-
tration On the two selectcommitteeslast winter they
hadsix to three,which was bad enough buthewould
ask gentlemen if it was not rather too bad that an im
portant matter of this kind shdild he referred to a
committee of eight to one. He hoped the íesolution
would be agreed to, in some form or othei, that a
proper investigation might be had If gentlemen
wcic not able to form an opinion m relation to this
matter, let them have a committee which would do
it justice, and they would have data, and the whole
country would hare data, to make up an opinion
in relation to it He desired to have light on the sub-
ject, and the whole American people desired light.
Mr W. then modified his resolution by omitting
the woids " enormous" and " extravagant."
Mi GLASCOCK regretted exceedingly the un-
pleasant feeling w hich seemed to exi t on this sub-
ject, and that a discussion should be got up which
was entirely irrelevant to the subject before the
House The House had nothing to do with the
controversy which had been going on, and he hoped
w e would hear no more of it So far as he was
concerned, he was disposed to go heart and hand
for this investigation and he bel eved there was no
friend of ihe administration who had expressed a
disposition to evade the inquiry All weie desirous
that it should be had The whole country was
looking anxiouslj forward to the time when the
matter would h« mauned into If there was any
individual m this House, or out of it, who had
raised his voice against the laising of this com-
mittee, he had not heard it There had, to be sure,
been objection made to the mode of appointment,
and 111 s he himself objected to His object was
that the committee should be so constituted that all
•he officers, and all the parties interested in the
issue, «hould have fill and complete justice done
them, and to effect this, he liad come to the con-
clusion that the committee ought to be appointed,
as all other committees are appointed in this House,
by the Chair This would be throwing the respon-
sibility wheie it belo igs, because m a matter ot so
much importance to the country, the Speaker
would appoint such a committee as w ould do the
subject amp*e and complete justice The gentle-
man had pioposed to appoint the committee by bal-
lot His objection to this was, that the interests of
all those concerned m the campaign could not be
so well guarded The committee mij,ht be preju-
diced against one, and in favor of another, but if
the Speaker appointed the committee, he would
take this into consideration, and see that each would
have his fiiends on the committee, so that all might
have justice done them If they were elected, there
would be a majontj of one party or the other on
the committee, and the objection on political grounds
would be the same He would go for the appoint-
ment of the committee by the Chair, and if he ap-
pointed such committee as would do injus-
tice to the investigation, he confessed that ho
should entertain a diffeient feeling townds the
Speaker from that which he now entertained
That the committee should be so made up as to have
a majority of the party m power on it, was ac-
cording to all parliamentary usage, but that w as no
evidence that thev would not do justice to the sub-
ject referred to them If the committee weie to be
elected, how should the election take place? Were
they to be elected by a majority or a pluiality? And
when they were elected, the same objection might
be raised to them on political grounds, as one party
or the other must be in the majority It appeared
to him that it ought to be the desire and the wish
of all, that every gentleman concerned in the cam-
paign should have his mteiests represented on the
committee, and thii could only be effected by ap-
pointing it in the usual way He had no political
views to giatify, and only desired that the people
of the countiy might be placed m possession of all
the facfs m relation to this matter
Without taking the question, the House, on
motion of Mr CAMBRELENC4, proceeded to the
orders of the day, and on motion of the same gen-
tleman, went into Committee of the Whole on the
state of the Union, Mr Hiynes m the chaii, and
resumed the consideration of the bill to
POSTPONE THE FOURTH INSTALMENT Willi HIE
STATES
The question pending was on the amendment of
Mr PICKENS to strike from the bill the indefinite
clause " till further provision by law," and insert
" the first day of January, 1839 "
Mr LOOMIS, of Ohio, who was em tied to the
floor, addressed the commtitee at length in opposi-
tion to the bill, insisting that it was proposing to in-
flinge a vested right, acquired undei the deposite
act by the States, who had pledged their faith to
repay the money. He then reviewed the acts and
policy of the late and present administrations m ie-
