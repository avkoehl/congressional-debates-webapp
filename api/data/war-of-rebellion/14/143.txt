
Brooks is ordered to be with you by daylight, and a staff officer during the night, to post the general fully about the condition of things.

BIVOUAC IN FIELD, NEAR WILLIAMSBURG, May 5, 1862-9.40 p.m.

General W. B. FRANKLIN:

GENERAL: I found great confusion here, but all is now right.

Hancock made a magnificent charge, taking 150 prisoners - killing as many more. I now feel safe.

Have ordered Sedgwick to fall back at daylight to Yorktown, there to embark under your orders.

Please push your movement as rapidly as possible, securing the landing beyond all doubt, and being cautious though bold in your advance. Keep me fully informed. I think the enemy will evacuate during the night; if not, I can probably beat him. I will, as soon as matters are developed here, push up Porter's, the regulars, and other division, joining you myself as soon as I feel safe here.

We have now a tangent hit. I arrived in time.

Ever, yours,

GEO. B. McCLELLAN,

Major-General, Commanding.

P. S.-Since the above was written it is ascertained that Joe Johnston is in command in front beyond a doubt.

Hon. E. M. STANTON:

The desponding tone of Major-General McClellan's dispatch of last evening more than surprise me. He says his entire force is undoubtedly considerably inferior to that of the rebels. If such is the fact I am still more surprised that they should have abandoned Yorktown.

No order has been given to deprive you of any transportation. Neither has it been contemplated to deprive you of any, by only to employ any surplus not required for your use.
