too small a force at that point, with its flank exposed on the Frederick road. I want more cavalry. Send Averell to me as soon as he can come; also Tidball's battery. The next two or three days will be busy, and my cavalry cannot do all the work necessary here.

MUDDY BRANCH, MD.,

September 5, 1862 - 7 p. m.

General R. B. MARCY:

Signal officer of Banks' corps reports from Sugar Loaf Mountain:

The enemy crossed at Noland's Ferry last evening. The river is easily fordable at that point. Saw about 2,000 of the enemy on this side, scattered along from the aqueduct to Noland Ferry. Think they are cavalry. Saw two guns in position on opposite side of the river, at Noland's Ferry. Cannot discover the enemy in force at that point, nor near Leesburg. Such reports are, however, current.

MUDDY BRANCH, MD.,

September 5, 1862 - 11.30 p. m.

General R. B. MARCY, Chief of Staff:

Captain Crowninshield, First Massachusetts Cavalry, just in from Edwards Ferry, reports no enemy there. Saw dust of enemy at White's Ferry, 7 miles above. From direction of dust it is thought the enemy is moving toward Frederick. He has a large force on this side of the river. A rebel deserter told Captain Crowninshield that Jackson, Longstreet, Smith, and Hill were crossing, and that they had sixty pieces of cannon, and a force of between 30,000 and 45,000 men. Banks' corps is some 4 miles to the rear of me, on this road, and Sumner was moving up this evening. My pickets are about 2 miles beyond Darnestown at this time. One Captain Chamberlain, of the First Massachusetts Cavalry, is missing, and some 21 men prisoners. One killed and 1 badly wounded in skirmish to-day.

Brigadier-General.

HALL'S HILL, VA., September 5, 1862.

General R. B. MARCY:

The enemy's infantry again appeared this afternoon on our picket line in sufficient force to drive in small parties on Barret's Hill. The enemy boasted of their intention to have and hold it to-day. All quiet to-night. I had insufficient force to furnish the picket line, hence the late hour at which I was informed of this approach, the report having to be brought by footmen. The pickets are about 4 miles out.

F. J. PORTER,

Major-General, Commanding.

HALL'S HILL, VA.,

September 5, 1862 - 11.50 p. m.

Brigadier-General MARCY:

I request that the picket line in McDowell's front be made to connect with mine at Barret's, on the turnpike, and the old line of last winter
