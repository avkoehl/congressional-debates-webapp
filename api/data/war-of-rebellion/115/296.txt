transferred to Fort Warren by order of the Secretary of State on the 30th day of October, 1861. The returns from Fort Warren make no mention of this person nor is any further evidence concerning him to be found in the papers of the Department of State. (Released to be exchanged for Abbott December 19, 1861.)

These persons [John W. and Ezra E. Cornell] were taken prisoners at Fort Hatteras* and committed to Fort Columbis and from thence transferred to Fort Warren. They were held as prisoners of war. Application having been made for their release and statements made of a satisfactory character that they were compelled to join the Confederate Army and that they were willing to give their parole to do no further hostile act against the United States Government, an order was issued from the Department of State directing Colonel Dimick, commanding at Fort Warren, to release them on their engaging on oath not to leave the State of New York without permission off State and not to hold any treasonable correspondence or do any act hostile or injurious to the Government of the United States. They were accordingly released from confinement November 2, 1861.

This person [F. V. Hoskins] was one of the prisoners taken at Hatteras* by the expedition under General Butler and was confined in Fort Columbus. He claimed to be a chaplian in the service of the rebels. But order of the Secretary of State said F. V. Hoskins was released October 21, 1861, on taking on oath to do no act hostile or injurious to the Government of the United States nor enter nor correspond with any State in revolt against the authority of the United States during the present insurrection without permission of the Secretary of State.

Richard S. Freeman, of Macon, Ga., was arrested in New York by the superintendent of police on the 29th day of August, 1861. He was taken to Fort Lafayette and afterward transferred to Fort Warren. Freeman was charged with giving aid and assistance to the rebels by purchasing and transmitting to them necessary and useful machinery and other articles, and making efforts to do so, and with being a spy. His papers show that he left Macon on the 9th of August, 1861, with means and instructions to purchase a shoe peg machine and with intorduction to parties in Louisville, Ky., who it was hoped would be able to get the machine conveyed southward through the lines of the U. S. forces. This machine was so much desired at Macon that it was represented as a public necessity. Freeman's papers also show that he had taken some steps toward furlfilling this commission before his arrest, and was engaged therein up to the day of his arrest; and also that he was on the lookout for other purchases which he might judge to be useful and profitable if made and conveyed to Georgia. Freeman had a check and letter of credit from the Bank of Middle Georgia on Messrs. Bingham &amp; Parsons, 18 Exchange Place, New York. The said Freeman remained in custody at Fort Warren February 15, 1862, when in comformity with the order of the War Department of the preceding day he was transferred to the charge of that Department. (Ordered released February 21, 1862. Released February 22, 1862.)
