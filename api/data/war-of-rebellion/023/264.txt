HEADQUARTERS, Huntsville, August 5, 1862.

Colonel INNES, Depot:

Designate for me all the bridges you or your officers know of which could be rebuilt in twenty-four hours in case they are destroyed.

D. C. BUELL.
HEADQUARTERS, Huntsville, August 5, 1862.

Captain MORTON,Corps of Engineers, Duck River, via Tullahoma:

The plan of erecting the stockades successively will not answer. The time cannot be spared. The work must be done simultaneously. Use what negroes you can collect in the vicinity of each brigade. The troops must also work industriously. You may warn the officers that in two or three days they will be left to their own resources, and he who fails to give a satisfactory account of his trust will be-held to a responsibility that will not be trifling. The matter is too urgent and of too serious consequence to be treated lightly any longer.

D. C. BUELL.
HEADQUARTERS, Huntsville, August 5, 1862.

General SMITH, Tullahoma:

Buckley's brigade will pass to the command of General McCook unless an emergency should render it necessary to you, in which case you must report the fact here.

JAMES B. FRY.

BATTLE CREEK, August 5, 1862.

Colonel J. B. FRY:

One of my men just in; he left opposite Chattanooga yesterday. He neither saw nor heard of any troops crossing save small parties. The Anderson road has not been passed; cavalry can pass it. I am momentarily expecting a man from Harrison who will know all.

McCOOK,General.

HDQRS. FIRST DIVISION, DISTRICT OF THE OHIO, Decherd, Tenn.,

August 5, 1862.

Major-General BUELL:

By some mismanagement on the railroad I did not succeed in getting here until to-day. Will start the troops as you directed to-morrow, if possible.

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers.
