AUGUST 30, 1864--11.30 a. m.

Lieutenant-General LEE:

General Hood calls attention to the necessity of using the greatest exertion to procure a sufficient supply of forage. The wagons of the command, whether appropriated to that use or not, should be used to gather green corn from the country between the Macon and Augusta railroads. The matter requires the attention of the commanding officers.
