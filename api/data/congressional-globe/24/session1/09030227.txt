APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

24th Cong....1st Sess.
Maritime Defenses—Mr. Thompson.
Ho. or Reps.
detail, upon detached, minute, and separate mem- i
bers. I cannot doubt that all the materials are
at hand, and that there are officers capable of
digesting such a plan. Why is it not doner What
is the pressing exigency by which we are required
in such haste to act on these particular navy-
yards? Why is it that the appropriations for
these yards are thus pressed upon us, and brought
up in this unusual mode, when the application
for a yard at Pensacola, more important than any
of them, and in my judgment of as much import-
ance aa all of them put together, is condemned to
the usual, but dilatory course of a reference to
the Naval Committee? Whenever, sir, such a
plan aa I have suggested is presented, I am will-
ing to appropriate aa much money as can be
wisely and economically expended; and if some-
thing like justice is done to the South and West,
I shall not be over captious as to the greater mag-
nitude of the appropriations to the North. Until
that is done, I will not vote one farthing; I will
not vote these appropriations, and then take the
chances for our own. No, sir, it is a common
board, at which all must sit down, or none. I
will not wait for the second table, and take the
fragments which may be left by the appetites
which I will not call voracious, but which I shall
■how are not very easily satisfied.
The items of appropriation now under consid-
eration are taken without the change of a letter
er figure from the report of the Secretary of the
Navy I therefore take it for granted, that the
other recommendations of the Secretary, in imme-
diate connection with this subject, will in due
season also be presented to us. I have only to
regret that they are not ail under consideration at
once. It may, however, have been prudent to
give them to us in broken doses. 1 shall, how-
ever, take leave to advert to ail of them in this
discussion; I will also endeavor to collect these
scattered sweets, and I am utterly mistaken in the
force of truth, if the result does not astonish this
House and this nation.
Expecting, as I do, sir, the aid and coopera-
tion of very many honorable members who are
attached to the Adminstration party, I shall
endeavor, as far as practicable, to avoid even the
imputation of making this unnecessarily a party
Soestion. Its importance rises infinitely higher
san any such considerations. I have no motive
to do so. The President of the United States is
rapidly passing from the stage of public action,
and is about to assume his station in history. I
will not anticipate what that station will be; I
feel that I am not an impartial judge. I cannot
forbear to express the happiness which I feel
that we are called upon to act upon this important
■abject free from the extraneous and exciting in-
fluence of the prospect of a collision with France.
I can now vote money for permanent and pro-
gressive works, which, under such an apprehen-
sion, I would have husbanded for men and ships;
and, sir, I will not disguise that the adjustment
of our differences with France affords me a per-
sonal—a selfish satisfaction, as justifying remarks
heretofore made, that I saw ih the course of
France nothing of threat or intimidation, but
everything of conciliation, even of kindness.
Through the magnanimous interference of Eng-
land, that controversy is now settled—magnan-
imous (if disinterested) beyond anything in his-
tory. Our maritime frontier may properly be
divided into three sections. 1. From Maine to
the Capes qf Virginia, denominated the North
Atlantic. 2. From the Capes of Virginia to
Florida point, the South Atlantic. 3. From
Florida point to the Sabine, or the Gulf frontier.
From the Capes of Virginia to Maine is less than
one third of the whole frontier, and the country
dependent upon it less than one fifth of the terri-
tory of the United States. I will endeavor to
show, from the report of the Secretary of the
Navy and other measures before the House, how
much it is proposed to appropriate to these sec-
tions respectively. I am aware, sir, that I am
entering upon an invidious duty. I hope that it
is not my nature to be over querulous or jealous.
I know that I should not properly represent those
who send me here if I were to scrutinize too
nicely the measures of disbursement to the differ-
ent sections of our common country—a disburse-
ment necessarily unequal to a certain extent.   I
trust, sir, for my apology to the facts which I
will develop.
Sums specifically estimated for the navy-yards
on the North Atlantic.
Pay of Officers and others.

South Atlantic. How much do you suppose,
sir? You would never guess. I will tell you—
nothing, sir, nothing: Whole Gulf frontier,
$275,000.
I would forbear to remark upon these separate
points until I had presented the whole, but I can-
not. Is there anyone man whose sense of justice
does not revolt at this. One third of the frontier
and one fifth of the territory is to receive, for one
item of expenditure, $3,225,000; another section,
more than equal in extent of coast and territory,
to receive nothing; and against this enormous
sum appropriated to this small section, you have
$275,000 to the other four fifths. Can any people
bear this—ought any people to bear it—from a
Government, too, under the most sacred obliga-
tions to distribute, as equally as practicable, its
burdens and its benefits ?
I will now give you the estimates, the expendi-
tures of which must principally be made on the

To which, sir, allow me to add the proposed
appropriations for fortifications, which give to
this same favored section $2,326,000, and $170,800
to the remaining four fifths.   It stands thus:

One fifth of the country receives appropriations
at about the rate of two millions to every hun-
dred thousand given to the remaining four fifths.
These, Mr. Chairman, «re facts depending on
figures, about which I think there can be and is
no mistake. If there be any error, I am happy
to know that 1 shall be corrected, and no one be
misled by me. Are they not appalling facts ? Do
they not demand the solemn consideration of the
people of the South and West? Is this terrible
inequality unavoidable ? Is there anything in the
circumstances of the two sections, natural, social,
or political, which causes it, and for which there
is no remedy? I sincerely hope—I believe not.
If I were to say otherwise I should feel that X naa
entitled myself, for the first time.to a name often
unjustly applied to me—that of disumonist. Sir,
if this be true, it never was designed; it cannot
come to good, that two People with interests so
incompatible should remain together. If, sir,
there is no remedy for all this; if you announce,
by a perseverance in this course of legislation,
i that this state of things must continue, one sec-
11 tion almost exclusively to pay taxes, and another
