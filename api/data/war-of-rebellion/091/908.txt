lines. I have before me now a list of the families, numbering upward of 100 men, women, and children, who have for a long tim been harboring and sheltering and encouraging deserters - their husbands, sons, &amp;c. - and who will continue to do so. They have always been disloyal and haters of our Government and people and institutions. Loyal people and these people cannot live together, and I propose, with the consent of the general, to order Thurmond to remove all of these people cannot live together, and I propose, with the consent of the general, to order Thurmond to remove all of these people beyond our lines toward the Kanawha and over the mountains. Nothing else will do. When they are gone the deserters will go, too, and others will not come in. I forwarded a paper from Captain Thurmond on this subject some days ago and asked the general's consent to my giving the order, but I have not yet heard from it. Whatever is done must be done very soon, as the winter is approaching, during which it might seem cruel to send out women and children. Please let me hear as soon as possible.

I am, major, very respectfully, &c.,

JNO. ECHOLS,

Brigadier-General.

Major General J. C. BRECKINRIDGE:

Major Bosang has just telegraphed me that the enemy dashed into Lewisburg last night. He does not give the numbers. Has not Duke's men better be ordered not to go up to Wytheville; they may possibly be stopped before they get far away from here.
