HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,October 15, 1862.

General A. PLEASONTON,

Commanding Cavalry:

GENERAL: General Hancock is to make a reconnaissance in force from Harper's Ferry toward Bunker Hill to-morrow morning at daylight. I have ordered all the cavalry to him that we have here, but the general commanding does not think it sufficient. If you can fit out 200 or 300 men from your command to report to him or General Couch at Harper's Ferry by daylight to-morrow morning please do so, and send Farnsworth or some good colonel to command all the cavalry. Hancock takes about 5,000 infantry with him. Please answer.

Very respectfully,

R. B. MARCY,

Chief of Staff.

General KELLEY,

Commanding, Cumberland, Md.:

A rumor has reached here that the main portion of the Confederate army is crossing the Potomac at Cumberland. While no credence whatever is attached to this, it may be well to exercise particular vigilance in that vicinity, and be on the alert for any indication of such a design.

R. B. MARCY,

Chief of Staff.
