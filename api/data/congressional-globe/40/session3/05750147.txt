40th Cong. ... 3d Sess.
Equal Suffrage, &c.—Mr. French.
Ho. of Reps,
of whom there was not one who would not have
risked his own life for the white Union soldier
or refugee who invoked his protection ; not one
to whom it may not be said in the day of judg-
ment, "1 was an hungered, and ye gave me
meat; I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink; I
was a stranger, and ye took me in."
Such faithful allies in the hour of its victory
the nation could not spurn, and in the insur-
gent States she promptly acknowledged their
right to vote. And through such sacrifices as
you who were not witnesses can little under-
stand they so voted as to reestablish civil and
loyal government in seven of those rent and
distracted States. In the light, then, of expe-
rience does not the trial of black voting in the
South warrant its extension to all the States ?
, Whure in all the history of the world has
there been better voting than by the colored
men of the rebel States during these last eight-
een months? And does not the nation owe it
to these faithful friends and their white Union
allies in the South that she lift the ban from
colored voting and make it universal through-
out the Republic?
Placing ourselves squarely upon our repub-
lican principles, in unquestioning faith that
they are to fill and redeem the earth, making
all its waste places glad, let us enter upon out-
grand destiny. Every citizen protected in all
rights, the humblest most cared for, the Re-
public meaning justice and peace, let us turn
our attention to the development of the un-
counted resources of our county, this grand
continent, the first lifted above the waters, but
withheld from man's occupancy until the full-
ness of time when freedom should come down
from Heaven to dwell with the children of
earth.
We are thirty-five millions, and not a man of
us a slave, and garnered from the best blood
of all the nations. With common rights and
a common inheritance and common hopes,
with stout and cheerful heart, let us to our
work. Plant and till these rich valleys and
broad prairies, capable of feeding the world,
until they shall smile with an unwonted luxu-
riance. Let none ot our grand rivers longer
run idly to the sea,but with the music of the
water-fall mingle the hum of the loom and
spindle, and the happy shouts of well-paid
labor. Let our mines no longer slumber in the
sleep of ages, but on mountain slope and
through hushed valleys light the fires of the
furnace and awaken the ring of the forge until
new settlements shall shout to their fellows
through all our happy borders. Let us extend
our railroads and devise new ones. Somebody
has said that " iron is the great civilizerof the
age," and it may be added, never more so than
when stretched across States and continents in
the form of railroad bars. Railroads make
neighbors and friends of those who else would
be strangers and aliens, bind distant peoples
with a common interest, develop business,
multiply population, quicken thought, and
hasten action. Already has the nation's wise
munificence nearly completed a grand iron
road across the continent. The rich commerce
of the East awaits its completion to come to us,
while they in turn await the coming of our
institutions and our civilization. And other
lines of iron railway should be laid across the
continent for reasons that I may not stop here
to enumerate. A few weeks since the argu-
ments for a northern line were right royally
presented in the exhaustive speech of the hon-
orable gentleman from Minnesota. A like
statement could be made in behalf of a south-
ern line more directly connecting the rising
and soon to be important States of the South
with the Pacific coast. Across these grand
national railways is to flow the commerce of
the world. With trade will ride ideas and
sentiments, and while Asia and the islands of
the sea shall give us of their wealth we shall
return to them the thoughts andteachings of
our better civilization. The Orient and the
Occident, no longer distant and stranger, shall
become neighbor and friend, and quickened by
common sentiment keep step in the march of
life.
But we are often warned, sir, in this House
not further to squander the " people's land "
upon railroads. What is the land worth i o the
"people " without railroads ? We are also re-
minded that the nation is heavily in debt, poor,
and burdened with taxation. Indeed we are
in debt, and grievously taxed ; but we are not
poor, but beyond all other nations rich in all
manner of resources, and the sensible w.ay of
lightening taxation and paying debts lies not
through despair and idleness, but by the ener-
getic and courageous development and working
of these native resources. Let me submit for
the consideration of the House a few signifi-
cant figures, telling what railroads have already
done in our own and other countries in the way
of developing trade and wealth.
Great Britain has about four thousand miles
of navigable waters. For a number of years
prior to 1833 the exports and imports of that
country had averaged about $400,000,000; but
during the seven succeeding years lines of rail-
roads were constructed which have been added
to from year to year, and the construction of
railroads and increase of commerce is shown to
be as follows:

1865 13,289 2,393,000,000
1867  - 2,500,000,000
Thus it will be seen that the commerce of
Great Britain, which had increased but little
for many years, received a new impulse from
railroad development, and from $400,000,000
in 1833 reached the enormous sum of $2,500,-
000,000 in 1867.
Let us now see what effect the construction
of railroads has had upon the commerce of
France, whose people are blessed with about
seventy-seven hundred miles of navigable
waters.
The following figures will show the progress
of commercial development in connection with
railroad construction in that country:

1865 8,130 1,432,000,000
1867  - 1,440,000,000
Here it will be seen that commercial prosper-
ity kept pace with railroad construction ; so
that from $403,000,000 in 1840 the exports and
imports of France increased to $1,440,000,000
in 1867.
I will now bring to the attention of the House
the remarkable effect that the construction of
railroads has had upon the trade of the two
busy little States of Belgium and Netherlands.
While under the Government of the United
Netherlands their commerce reached a point
of considerable importance ; but at the time
of their separation, in 1830, the total exports
and imports of the Netherlands were nearly
treble those of Belgium, resulting mainly from
the fact of superior means of transportation
by canals and by sea; but in 1835 Belgium
commenced the construction of a wise system
of railroads so as to give her an outlet into
Germany, Austria, and France.
Immediately production and trade received
a powerful impulse, and with the progress of
her railroad system the commerce of Belgium
increased in a ratio unparalleled by that of
any other nation on earth. The soil was more
skillfully tilled; valuable mines were opened ;
furnaces and workshops were erected, and the
little State, insignificant in point of territorial
extent, outstripping her neighbor, the Nether-
lands, has taken a firsi-class position as a pro-
ducing and commercial people. The following
figures may prove interesting as showing the
progress of commerce in Belgium in relation
to railroad construction, and the manner in
which she outran the Netherlands in the race
of progress:

I now wish to compare the figures showing
the commerce of those two countries, calling
attention to the fact that the Netherlands con-
structed no considerable extent of railroads
until as late as 1856, and that she possessed
vastly superior advantages over Belgium in the
way of water communication by means of her
extensive canals and by the river Bhine, com-
manding the trade of Germany:

This enormous production and interchange
of wealth is the result of the labor of a popu-
lation of a little more than four million five
hundred thousand, on a territory of eleven
thousand four hundred and two square miles,
Belgium being, in fact, but little larger than
the State of Maryland.
Now, with that pride which is the right of all
of us, I turn to a table showing the progress of
railroad construction and commercial develop-
ment in the United States :

Here we see the commerce of the United
States, which in 1830 amounted to $160,000,000
reach the enormous sum of $1,003,000,000
in 1866; and while Great Britain, India, France,
Belgium, and the United States had a total
commerce in 1840 of $1,471,000,000, in 1866
their commerce reached the startling sum of
$6,003,000,000.
The pro rate increase of exports and imports
of those countries since 1833, for each mile of
railroad constructed, is as follows:

Countries. mile of railroad.
Great Britain $110,000
France  69,000
India  65,000
Belgium  ^§'2!?!?
United States  25,000
As I have just shown, the total exports and
imports of those countries increased from 1840
to 1866, a period of twenty-six years, $4,532,-
000,000, while the increase of railroads during
the same period was sixty-three thousand and
eighteen miles, which gives an average increase
of $71,000 of commerce every mile of railroad
built.
Previous to the opening of the Erie canal,
in 1827, the tonnage crossing the Alleghany
range in both directions, and from the lakes to
New York, did not exceed 15,000 tons. This
tonnage consisted almost wholly of merchan-
dise going west, the cost of transportation
being a complete bar to the movement east ot
western produce. The only outlet of the in-
terior was the Mississippi river with ks tribu-
taries, the navigation of which was tedious and
hazardous, and so expensive as to leave little
profit either to the forwarder or the producer.
