The Chaplain, Rev. Edgar H. Gray, offered
the following prayer:

Thou hast made him a little lower than the
angels, and yet hast crowned him with life and
immortality beyond tho grave. O God, we
pray that all the dispensations of Thv pro\i-

places that know him now shall know him no
more forever. So teach us to number our days
that wo may apply our hearts unto wisdom and
become wise unto everlasting life. Guide and
direct us in the discharge of all the responsi-
bilities resting upon us, and when we have dis-
