must have the effect of greatly augmenting existing difficulties
anil dis res«, and of rendering the present confusion m the ex
changes and currency of the country more confounded It will
destro) what itmains of credit and confidence, it will either re
move from circulat on entirely e H bank paper, and force the
country through scenes of rum and suffering, of whicn what
now exista is but a faint pnd distant outline, to a purely metal
lie currency Or, should the necessities of the people compel
a continuance among them of the use of bank paper <is a cur
icney, the resumption of specie payments by the banks must
be postponed to some period beyond the continuance of such a
policy, for it is idie to think of banks resuming specie payments,

worth that sum will be required to pay the debt it sold at the
reduced rates The banks will have a rich harvest truly, in

ing to the country, in the course-of a iew years, by the use of st,
pai ec medium, is amazing to one who has not thought or taken.
ibe trouble to n ake a calculation upon the subject. I hi*ye
1 takeü the pains to make some calculations upon ifcis point* I
will state them Assuming three for one to he, under ordinary
circumtsiances, a safe relation between: bank issues aud tíietaaie
talic basis upon which they resf, and this appears to be gen*
era! ly admitted to be coi rect, let «s suppose $400,000,900 to be
the ¿mount of Circulating medium required by the. coujttry;
then, if you use paper, properly regulated, you will require
only $100,000,000 of com, the other three hundred millions is
made up of paper which coats the country nothing.
J o the country then, there is a saving of the interest upon
the e $300,0.30,01)0, calculate this interest at six percent per
an'Utn, and compound it only once in a year, (a rate much
slowe 1 than the actual accumulations from capital employed
in r ^t oftheactive pursuits of om country,)and you have, in
the course of twenty five years, ihe enormous sum of
&87J,4 8,055, as the amount saved ro interest onlv, fey the use
ofa mixed currency, though regulated and kept always coa-
v ci! Ide into com a sum which, immense as it is, wdl cease to
a^oaish when we look around upon the country and behold
what have been the practical efTecs of the system during the
las twenty 3 eais The effects of the proposed wise pohcy of
employing the dearest of all materials to effect purposes whick
can be as well or bettei effected by much cheaper means, of in 
dulsim^ a ridiculoufe fondness for the glitter and jingle of gold
ano silver, I will illustrate m another way suppose two per-
sons, 1 will say two \01mg farmers, (because I like them, they
arc of my own kind ) ba\e each five thousand dollars The
one m furnishing his hou^e cho s^s to Wy out his jStb thousand

T' it a mixed currency can be rendered safe and much more
useful ai d convemen* than one puiely meta'lic needs no argu-
