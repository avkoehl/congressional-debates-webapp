Assistant Adjutant-General:

The following dispatch, in answer to questions submitted, is just received:

PINE BLUFF, May 22, 1865.

Colonel JOHN LEVERING,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

All the information I have in regard to Kirby Smith's surrender is from the twenty-six men of West's rebel battery who came in last evening. The sergeant commanding the party says that on the 12th instant there was a conference of State men and commanding officer at Marshall, Tex. ; that a surrender was made at Shreveport on the 15th to Colonel Sprague, on General Pope's staff, and that the commanding officer at Hickory Mount, twenty-seven miles this side of Shreveport, where he was stationed, told his men that as Kirby Smith had surrendered they must go to the military post near their homes and give themselves up. This sergeant is an intelligent and seems to be a reliable man. I believe his report.

POWELL CLAYTON,

Brigadier-General.

Very respectfully.

J. J. REYNOLDS.

GENERAL: The major-general commanding recognizes the importance of placing a small force of one or two companies at Searcy and submits to you the selection of the same from the Third Minnesota Volunteers or Thirty-sixth Iowa Volunteers. If a field officer of the regiment from which troops are selected can be spared, it is advisable that he should serve with the detachment. Please instruct the commanding officer of the regiment sent to Batesville that no separate headquarters of post will be established by him. He will retain command of his regiment.
