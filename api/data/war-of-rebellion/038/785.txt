TULLAHOMA, April 25, 1863.

Lieutenant-General PEMBERTON:

Is there not a regiment of cavalry at Columbus to intercept that of the Federals just reported at Newton Station?

J. E. Johnston.

JACKSON, April 25, 1863.

General John ADAMS,

Lake Station, Southern Railroad:

You say in your dispatch to General Buckner "all is lost, unless," &amp;c. Correct it. I never authorized you to use such an expression.

J. C. PEMBERTON.

JACKSON, April 25, 1863.

General John ADAMS,

Lake Station, Southern Railroad:

Be on the alert. Enemy probably returns from Enterprise by way of Newton. Bright lookout at night.

J. C. PEMBERTON.

JACKSON, April 25, 1863.

General John ADAMS, Lake Station:

Do not move to Morton, but carry out my instructions of this afternoon.

J. C. PEMBERTON.

JACKSON, April 25, 1863.

Brigadier-General CHALMERS:

Some 700 to 1,100 cavalry, with a section of artillery, report near Kosciusko this morning. They went from Carthage yesterday. Featherston is at Grenada with his brigade. In your movements you must be guided by circumstances. If you could play the same game on enemy by cutting Memphis and Charleston Railroad, or getting in rear of column moving on Panola, it would be well. Confidence is felt in your direction.

J. C. PEMBERTON.
