and incurred thejr censure and displeasure. Under
such circumstances, and while man continues wnat
he is, we know tnat personal resentmen's are too
apt to be indulged and to temain, and often, per-
haps, difficult to be extinguished, even In the
noblest minds, but levenge will not harbor there
Higher pi inciples than !ese?itmeni,and bet.er prm
ciples than levenge, will animate men whose
thoughts and heai s aie liberal and enlarged, and
especially where there is high intellectual ab hty
and moral integrity if, then, under the influence
of momentary excitement and passion, if, in the
eageiness of controversy or the commotion of
debate, anything unkind or harsh should have be< n
said or done, either on my part or on yours, let us,
1 pray you, forgive and forget it, and letus separate
in the spirit of peace and good will. Let not this
moment of our final separation be poisoned or
embittered by feelings of personal resentment oi
political hosulity Let the spirit of peace and
charity shed its holy calm around us, refreshing
alike to the affections and the intellect, and let us
blot fiom oui minds and hearts every feeling of
personal or party resentment, and separate like
brethren of one household, and as the Repiesent-
atives of a free and virtuous people. I have my-
self no injuries to complain of, and no memory
for them, if I had, I carne to this chan to gratify
no private friendships, to indulge no petsonal
hostility, and all that 1 have now to ask of you is,
to do justice to the motives which have irfluenced
and governed my conduct, and when I am gone,
to protect my character as the presiding officer of
th s House, which may now be regarded, in some
measure, as the property of my country, fiomall
unjust and unworthy imputations. To those who
have known me longest, and have known me best—
to the liberal and ju t of all parties, and on all bides
of this House—this appeal, I flatter myself, will
not be made in vain. One word more, and I have
done.
Although I am about to leave you, gentlemen,
and in all probability fotever, I shall never cease
to regaid this House, and everything connected
with it, with feelings of the deepest solicitude and
affection.
1 need not remind you of the character and sta-
tion which this House holds in the eyes of the
American people. They justly regard it as the
sanctuary of liberty, and ¡aw, and order, and
justly repose on it with unlimited confidence and
affection. In its deliberations and proceedings is
essentially involved the security of our free in-
stitutions. How much, gentlemen, will depend
upon the manner in which its high duties shall be
performed '
Noi is it needful, I am sure, that I should ad-
monish you that you are the Representatives of
our whole country,and notofa part, that our Con-
federation can only exist and prosper under the
influenceof a wise, equal, and just system of legis-
lation, by the ties of common mteiestand brotheily
affection, by a spirit of mutual forbearance and
moderation, and by cherishing a hallowed devo-
tion to that liberty and union secured to us by the
blood of our common fathers These are the
foundations upon which alone our safety and
Becunty can rest
Although our country, of late, gentlemen, has
been deeply and painfully excited, and our coun-
cils, too, greatly divided, may we not hope that
the causes of excitement are daily passing off, and |
subsiding, and that peace and tranquillity will
again be restored to us > At such a time, and under
such circumstances, is it not the duty of every
wise, and liberal, and good man, in public or pn-
vate life, without distinction of party, to unite foi i
the purpose of healing these divisions, and giving
peace and repose to the public mind ? And should i
not those especially who wield the public councils
pour oil upon this stoi my sea, and still its troubled i
wateis >                                                                          |
I invoke you, gentlemen, to peace and harmony,
to union and action for the common good                 ,
The people expect it, the prosperity and hap-
piness of your country demand it                             I
God   grant that  you   may  prove   yourselves
worthy of the high trust, and equal to the crisis,
and that your labors may ultimately prove sue- .
cessful in giving peace and repose to oui beloved [
country                                                                          I
This is the last time that I shall ever address
you from the chair
We separate this day, many, very many of us,
to meet no more
I pray to God to protect and bless you and our
country, and I tender to you this, my last and
affectionate faiewell'

necessat y to a choice
JOHN BELL, of Tennessee, having 114, was
declared duly elected Speaker ot the House, and
was conducted to the chau by Messis J Q.
Advms and R M Jounsos After taking tue
chan the Speaker elect made the following ad-
dress
Gentlemen of the House of Repi eientnluei
With the greatest smcer ty I dedal e to you, that
although I am duly and gntefully impiessed by
this mark of the partiality and confidence of the
House, and by no means insensible to the dis-
tinction intended to   be conferred on me, it is not
without some distrust of the wisdom of my course
in accepting; this station, which  your choice has
assigned me     Without the slightest experience
in the chair, it may be justly apprehended that
your selection'of a presiding officei has been too
much influenced by personal kindness and friend-
ship     And I shall be quite happy if the public
interest shall suffer no detriment through a defec-
tive administration of the duties of the chair     In
ordinary times, and undei ordinary ciicumstances,
I could ilattei myself that, by dihgentapplication,
I might be able, in a shoi t time, to supply the
want of experience, and to jus<.tfy, in some degree,
the  confidence  indicated   by the   House     That
moie than usual embarrassments must be encoun-
tered at this moment by any incumbent of the
chan, will be admitted by all     The impatience,
not to say nutation—the natural result of a pro-
tracted session, the  excitement growing out of
those sharp conflicts of opinion upon questions of
public policy—conflicts exaspeiated  and embit-
tered at the piesent moment in an extraordinary
degree—all ¡present themselves to increase the dif-
ficulties and call forth the exertions of a new and
unpracttsed incumbent of the chan     And 1 feel,
gentlemen, that whatevei exertions may be made
on my part must be vain, without your forbear-
ance; nay, that they must fail altogether without
your cordial support and cooperation.    When I
reflect how gieat are the interests connected with
this House, its character and action, interests not
of a day or of a paity, but of all time, of posier-
lty, and of all the parties which are, or ever will
be, arrayed against each other, and when I furthei
reflect how much the character and action of this
House depends on a skilful, firm, and impartial
admimstiation of the duties of the chair, I confesa
I feel the deepest solicitude
It is not so geneially understood, I regret to be
heve, as it should be, in how great a degree tho
measures of a legislative assembly are modified
and influenced by the manner of its deliberations.
All will concede that if it shall ever happen that
this body shall fall into disrepute, and fail to com-
mand the respect and confidence of the people, our
institutions will be in the greatest peril Ñ ot only
the character of the House, the wisdom and effi-
ciency ol its act.on, but the existence of oui
admuable frame of polity itself, may be said to
depend, in some degree, upon the older and dignity
of the delibeiations of this House While, then,
I eoireat the indulgence of the House to my own
defects, I earnestly invoke the assistance of every
member of it m ei deavormg to maintain and pre-
seive, so far as depends upon the proceedings of
this body, those great and pnmaiy mteiests of
constitutional Government and freedom, in sup-
port of which, I am suie> whatever difference of
opinion theiemuy be upon points of construction,
policy, oi administration, theie is not a heart here,
noi all American heart anywhere, that does not
beat high
On motion of Mr  BARRINGER,
The House then adjourned
IN SENATE
Tuesday, lime 3, 1834
Mr McKEAN said, a committee of thirty cit-
izens, of the first lespectabilny, from various sec-
tions of Pennsylvania, all of whom, he believed,
weie now in the lobby of the Senate, had hono.ed
him by putting into his charge a memorial to be
piesented to the Senate, signed by more than two
hundred delega.es from the diffeient counties of
that Slate, who assembled at Harnsburg, the seat
of government,on the 27th ultimo, to consultas to
the cause of public distress and mode of relief
And though, he said, a d ffeienoe of opinion, as
we'l as on questions of abs'ract exped ency,
existed between a portion of the memorialists and
himself, it was nevertheless his desire to represent
them fanly, and it was no less his pride than his
duty to say, that this convention compused as
much of ies|)ectability, talent, and weight of pub-
lic and pi i vate charactei, as any convention of men
that had assembled anywheie within his knowl-
edge, and whose expei lence entitled their opinions
to the most respectful consideration.
He had been furnished with a statement show-
ing the general, as well as political, complexion of
the convention, and he took occasion to say, that
the latter was corroborated by his own knowledge
of the facts as stated The whole number of del-
egates present was two hundred and nine, of this
number, seventy-five were original Jackson men,
about thirty of whom supported General Jackson
in 1832 Delegates were appointed from forty-
eight counties, and delegates were in actual attend-
ance from foity four counties, including the city
of Philadelphia—accidents having prevented the
atiendonce fiom the other four. He had been
particularly mstiucted to say, that the entire pro-
ceedings had been distinguished for harmony,
unanimity, and zeal, and the whole character of
the convention furnished the strongest evidence of
a great political change in Pennsylvania, and a
growing opposition to the recent measures of the
present Administration of the General Govern-
ment The memorial was written with great foice
and ability, and condemns, tu. tolo, the conduct of
the Executive branch of the Government in refer-
ence to the bank, to which cause they ascribe all
the present distresses of the country, and ask
Congress for relief
Mi McKEAN then presented the memorial,
and moved that it be read, referred to the Commit-
tee on Finance, and printed, with the names.
Mi. WEBSTER lose, and asked, Is this the
tiue voice of Pennsylvania' That was the ques-
tion in which not only Pennsylvania, but every
State in this Union, was at this moment inter-
ested If it be, we might hope that a day of relief
to the country, a day of restoration of the Consti-
tution and laws, was at hand When we looked
at the great central States of the Union, we saw a
population so numerous and so poweifu), who, if
they chose to come to the relief of the country
and puccorof the Constitution, might come, and it '
would be relieved and succored    He believed the
