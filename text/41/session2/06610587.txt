CUBREXCY LIMITATION.
By legislative enactment a limit has been
placed upon the further issue of paper cur-
rency. Are these restrictions wise and salu-
tary '! Do they permit sufficient circulation?
Ought the limitation to be modified or repealed?
Convertible paper currency adjusts its volume
to the laws of trade and demands of business,
lledeemable and based upon coin as the stand-
ard, it will be affected by the same causes that
vary the value or diminish the quantity of
specie remaining in the country.
The advantages of using paper currency will
stimulate its issue, while the necessity of re-
demption will limit its quantity to the point of
safe and easy convertibility. An irredeemable
currency requires an arbitrary limit to its issue;
there is no other check. It will increase to
the utmost extent authorized, but no law of
trade will expand or contract its volume, with
the demands of business. It will drive all coin
out of circulation, except wher.e the use of the
latter is specially required and indispensable.
Havingdisplaced coin its value depreciates and
fluctuates with its volume, compared with the
varying amounts required for circulation and
the probability of its future redemption or res-
toration to par %'alue. All our paper currency
being now irredeemable, without self-adjusting
power to accommodate its volume to the needs
of business, its further issue restrained not by
financial laws but by legislative limitation, the
inquiry becomes important,
HOW MUCH CIRCULATION IS NECESSARY?
No arbitrary rule can be laid down. The
quantity must vary with the condition, wealth,
habits, and business of the people. The com-
parative amounts used by other commercial
nations, or by our own, in periods of special
financial prominence, will aid us in forming a
correct conclusion. Proper allowance, how-
ever, must be made for difference in circum-
stances as to less or greater frequency ot ex-
changes, or use of checks and mutual credits
or other substitutes for money, as well as to
comparative amount of loanable capital, wealth,
and production.
CIRCULATION OF OTHER COUNTRIES.
The most reliable estimates of the circulation
of Great Britain make the amount of coin in
that country $400,000,000; bank notes, $196,-
000,000: total circulation, $596,000,000; less
amount coin in banks, $131,000,000. I have
no data as to the amount of bank notes in the
various banks in GreatBritain ; butasthe Bank
of England notes circulate as readily as coin,
and can be used in payment of all sums above
five pounds, it must be very considerable,
probably from one third to one fourth of tne
whole bank circulation, say $05,000,000. But
taking the figures given above as correct, and
estimating the population of Great Britain at
thirty millions, we have a per capita on the
total"circulation of §10 87, and on the actual
circulation of $15 50.

such an enormous amount of unemployed capital

Regarding the circulation of coin in Erance, it
is difiicult to say what amount is in actual circula-
tion among the forty million inhabitants; but at a
recent session of the superior council ofcommcrce
and industry, the question of the unification of coin,
&c., being discussed, it was stated that France had
coined some 6,000,000,000 francs in pieces of twenty
francs, of which half remained in the country. Con-
sequently we can presume, adding the smaller coins
of gold and the fractional coin, that four to five thou-
sand million irancsin gold and silver aro among the
people; which would only givo about one hundred
and twenty-five francs to each head. However, we
repeat that it is almost impossible to come to any
correct approximation of the coin circulation. .
"VVeshall be happy to furnish any other information
desired, and remain, dear sir, your very obedient
servant, SELIGMAN FRERES ET CIE.
Ilis Excellency Mr. 10. B. Washburne,
United titaies Minister, present.
This estimate gives twenty-five dollars in coin
and about seven dollars in currency as the per
capita circulation of France, a total of thirty-
two dollars. It seems very high in compari-
son with the amount in this country, but it must
be remembered that the political condition of
that country and habits of the people, as well
as greater wealth, require a very large amount
for reserve capital. Gold is laid away in the
strong box and hoarded for future use to a
larger extent thau-with us.
CIRCULATION OP TUB UNITED STATES.
The chief difficul ty in ascertaining the amount
of circulation in the United States arises from
the uncertainty in estimating the coin in the
country and Government paperusedas money.
The other data for accurate calculation can be
procured from official sources.
Prior to 1861 the currency consisted wholly
of bank notes and coin. Government notes
have since been added. As records are^kept
of these paper issues the bank returns and Treas-
ury reports from year to year will show the
amount in. circulation, but not with exactness,
since sometimes legal-tender notes, bearing
interest, have been held as investments, while
even seven-thirty bonds have been used as cur-
rency. The estimates of coin made by statis-
ticians, as well as statesmen, widely differ.
Assuming that the estimate of $41,000,000
made by the Secretary of the Treasury in 1834
is correct, if to it we add the yearly coinage of
American gold and silver, imports of specie,
and amount brought by immigrants, subtract-
ing the exports and loss from various sources,
we can approximately ascertain the amounts
of coin now in the country or during any given
time. How much is yearly brought by immi-
grants, or disappears by loss, wear, or other
use, is in some degree conjectural. In 1848
the Secretary of the Treasury, Hon. Robert J.
Walker, estimated the former at $8,000,000.
As the annual immigration then but little
exceeded two hundred thousand, this would
allow each immigrant nearly forty dollais. f
think this is altogether too high, certainly for
late years. Over seven million immigiants
have'arrived since 1830, and allowing $100 per
family, or twenty dollais apiece, seems suffi-
cientl'y large. Many coine without funds except
remittances from friends here, usually barely
sufficient to pay for passage and necessary
expenees.
Without any more reliable data I arbitrarily
assume twenty dollars apiece as tlie^ amount
received from immigrants, and three fourths o
one per cent, as the annual loss by wear and
other use. . ,
I submit two tables which I have prepared
after much careful investigation and examina-
tion of authorities and comparison of different
official documents. The first gives the amount
of total and per capita circulation for the 1st ot
January of each year from A. D. 18^4 to lcOO,
with rates of interest during portions oi that
time The f frond table 's similar to the urs
