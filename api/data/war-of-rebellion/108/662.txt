Brigadier-General RANSON,

Commanding Division:

GENERAL: General Longstreet desires you to connect the redoubts in your front with rifle-trenches. There may be some tools near you. Should there be none, you can get supply by calling on General McLaws. By beninning to work with full fatigue parties at moonrise,

the work may be finished before light.

I am, general, very respectfully,

[21.] Assistant Adjutant-General.

Major General J. B. HOOD,

Commanding Division:

GENERAL: I have the honor to acknowledge receipt of your communication of this evening, which has been laid before the lieutenant-general commanding. He directs me to say in reply that it is not designed to make a forward movement to-morrow. The design is to sustain the enemy's attack and repel them until they become exhausted and demoralized. When this takes place, General Jackson, from the right, will bear down on them, and if possible force them back, when the opportunity for the advance of our front will present itself. These movements will of course depend materially on the developments that may take place in the course of the day.

I am, general, very respectfully,

G. M. SOREEL,

[21.] Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIRST CORPS,December 13, 1862.

[Colonel WALTON:]

COLONEL: Do not be uneasy about your left. General Anderson has been ordered to hold the heights on the left with his whole force if necessary.

Very respectfully,

G. M. SORREL,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

Have all necessary arrangements made to replenish your chests once. Do not get out of ammunition.

Private: We have been looking at your practice; it is very pretty, and I congratulate you on it.

G. M. S.
