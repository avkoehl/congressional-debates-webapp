£6th Cong«-*'£nd Sess.
At the conclusion of the debate, ana just before
the vote was taken on his proposition to dispose of
the public lands to the new Slates m which ihey
are situated, «pon certa n conditions, Mr. Cal-
hoüíí roce in his place, and read from Gales and
Seaton's Register of Debates, in support of his po-
sition, the following extract from the speech of
Mr. /ohn Randolph, of Virginia, m the Senate of
the United Sates, in March, 1826, m reply to Ge-
neral Harrison, m Ohio; the subject of the Cum-
berland road being under cons deration:
uMr Randolph agam rose, and said The gentleman is mis
taken if he supposes that 1 begrudge the people from Ohio the
landa wittua the body of Ohio I wish that every new State
had all the lands within the State, that,m the shape of receiver
ships and other ways, these States might not be brought under
the influence of this ten miles square In other words, I wish
that all the patronage of the land office was in the hand*? of the
individual States, and not in the hands of the General Govern
tnent lam the fr^nd of State rights, and will cut down the
patronage of this General Government, which has increased, is
increasing, and must be diminished, or we, the States, shall be
not only 'shorn of our beams,' sir, but 'abolished quite > "
Mr. Benton then ros>e, and read the following
extract from a speech of Mr. Van Buren on the
same subject, delivered in the Senate on the 18th
of May, 1826:
"Mf Van Buren sai^  The subject of the public bnds was
becoming daily more and more interesting1, and would occupy
much time in legislation    It extended the patronage of the Go
yemnient over these States toa great extent, it subjected the
States 1ft which those lands were situated to an unwise and un
profitabfedependencc on the Tederal Government    Mr V   B
said he should vote for eveiy cdl on that subjut, to enable
them at some futui e d iy to act understanding^ on it   No man
could render the country a ííieatei bei vice iban he who should    >
devise some plan by which the United ¡States might í e i chevul    j
from the ownership oí this property, by some equitable mode     j
He would vote ioi a pioposiuonto vest the lands m the ¡states    |
in which they stood on some just an 1 equitable teims aa 10
lated to the other States of the Confederacy    He hope 1 that,    ,
after having full information on the subject, they would be able
to effect thatgreat object    IU believed tint if thote land-* were
disposed ef at once to the several States, u would be satisiac
tory to all"
Mr. Benton also read from the Senate Journal
of May SO, 1826, the following motion, as having
been submitted by Mr Tazewe'l ot Virg-ma to the   i
effect as stated.
"Mr Tii^vWell submitted the followm"" motion

SPEECH OF MR. REYNOLDS,
Or ILLINOIS
In the House of Representatives, February 5, 1841—
la C mimttee of the Whole, on tae Treasury
note bill
Mr. REYNOLDS addressed the committee as
fol ow
Mr Chairman Although I admire the eloquence
of the honorable gentleman from North Carolina,
[Mr Rayner ] who has just taken his seat, yet I
canBot subscribe to the principles contained m
many of his r mark>. Ha obsfrved he would
have no conn lenca in the party to suslam and vup.
port the ptmciple^ and doc nnes of State right?,
who wrnld comtrat  uch political fins a« they d d
tn the case of the ffew Jersey election.
Whenever it bácomes necessary to discuss politt-
ctl subjects from the siinnfis in Dimes, I take the
Nsw Jersey electiims as my text, to demonstrate to
the people that orj party did right, and the other did
wrong, in thc-e elections. I charge no corruption
in the action of this Hcuse; but to some of the ac-
tors in New Jersey I think at least a suspicion, to-
larably well lounded, m gli* attach That a majo-
rity ot the vo'ea m that election were given tor the
Democratic memb r?, all sdmit Tne Governor of
New Jersey, like olheis mu->t have seen and known
these tacts, yet, nevertheless, he gave the certificate
and seal to the party having the inn ority of votes.
These being the facts before the House in the con-
tested election, the decision was rendered m fa-
vor of the majority of vote , and the present mem-
bers of New Jersey thereby obtained their seats.
So soon as the present political excitement which
arises out of other causes in the S ate of New Jer-
sey subsides, and the people, in their crol and re-
flecting moments shall act on this ca«e, they will
give the same judgment m favor of ti e majority
governing, a*, the House of Repiesentattves did la-,t
session. I might,sk m turn what would 'State
Rights" expect at the hands ot a party who voted
for a m nonty to govern1 State and national rights
b th would be in a ^ery precarious situation, if mi-
noritie  govern maio íiies.
The g'fat seal if New J.rsey reemed to have
with some ¿s mi'ch power in tl is contiovery as ihe
phil sophcr's stone with its devotees. A sral with-
out the majori'y ought to have no more virtue than
the aforesaid ". true "
I will relate a case that took pipce in England,
peihaps in feuial times. I state it, because almost
all aiound me, and who are honoring me Witn their
attention, mo^e than I deserve, a e lawjers.
It bad been established m Ergland, in a court of
jus ice, and recorded, that a c nam person was
de^d AOerwa'ds, it became neccsarj, on the
trial of another cause m court, to prove the death
of this person. The record, and tne great seal at-
tached to it, v ere produced m conr', but lo and be-
hold ! at the trial the van who had been supposed
to be dead, appeared in full life ¡a < pen court The
question was, must the record or the man himself
be believed"!
Mr Chairman, m our country (Illinois) we
would raiher believe the man than tha record and
seal. In New Jersey, peihaps with a party it
mijht be otherwise.
FLORIDA  WiR.
Mr. Chanran, the gentleman [Mr Raynm] to-
day, and ihe Whig party on all occasions, charge
the Administration with remissness and want of
energy and capacity in carrying on the Florida
