Brigadier General B. H. ROBERTSON,

Adams' Run, S. C.:

The major-general commanding desires me to say that, at present, he needs no more artillery. The Washington Artillery will be sent for as you suggest if wanted. The enemy landed on James Island in force this morning, but were kept in check by the pickets. Our casualties, 6 or 7. Up to this time nothing of importance has taken place. General Taliaferro has been re-enforced.

H. W. FEILDEN,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

General G. T. BEAUREGARD,

Hancock's House, via Chester, Va.:

The detailed and detached men of Hagood's and Colquitt's brigades will be sent on under an officer as soon as possible. I cannot possibly spare the two companies you mention. One of them is serving an important battery, and the other is on scouting duty, for which it is peculiarly fitted, and neither can be replaced.

SAM. JONES,

Major-General.
