GEO. B. DRAKE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

DEVALL'S BLUFF, June 9, 1864.

Captain C. H. DYER,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

It will be impossible to send scouts on the east side of White River without sending them by boats either to Clarendon or up the river to Augusta, as there are no landings between these points where troops can leave the river. It would then be necessary to send a strong enough party to take care of themselves under any emergency.

W. F. GEIGER,

Colonel, Commanding.
