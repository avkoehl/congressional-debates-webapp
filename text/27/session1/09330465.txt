Revenue Bill~~-Mr* Birnard.
H. oí Reps.
Sir we have aheady an important and a growing trad*1
Witti Bi z ' a tiude v hich may be preatly augmented by
judicio " jipao a ¡ii ii aeures And it is wi'h reference to
oar impiru t conmerciai relations with that empire that I
s'iould hi kit piud nt o forbear imposing the duty indues
tion at the p esent time I have lately heard itstated fiora a
respectable so ace that 160 000 barrel*, of our flour were enterred
af Rio alone dunug the last year And that the whole amount
received at al! the p ins of the empire was probably not less than
300 000 barrels Í he Brazilians take alao our cotton fabrics m
considerab e qua itity, and some ether of our manufactures
O l the other hand they send us from 50,000000 to £60 000,000
pounds ofcofflcina year This is to them a most"profit<ibie
trade and the r strong desne is to extend and cultivate com
meiciaUxchanges with this country At present Great Bn
tain supplies them mainly with cotton goods, and with hard-
vare, cutlery, and other manufactures But Great Britain
takes from them very little in retuin but cash It is an une
qual ar d oppres tve trade to them, an 1 it is said to be the
known determination of the pi esent Ministry of the Emperor to
lay heavy counterv ulinz duties on imports from Great Bntaui
At any late it is believed that then disposition is every way fa
vorabl° o tpe cultivation oí mu ual beneficial relations m tiade
with this co ntiy and it woul i be deeply to be regretted if any
ha ryle_is atún on our parr jus at thisiuncture should mar
the giow ng m „rcs s which we have m this trade So much
at least Iumletstand that id eanpiehension of such a duty as
isheiepro o^ed on cofF e is suonff!y felt among Brazilian
planters <mtoiriet« whieh to ceprecited by them,  of couist,
0 i the ground ol t ^r^iia! interest Then fear is that i*" «uch
a duty i imp ed toe producer must pay it by having so
much taken off"from the \ jnhs of production, ms e d of us
boms paid by the '■n i$u ier m this countiy by at enhance
mentofsomu Innthepri e he may p?*y fort e article Th.p
truth ptobioiy bes omewheie ab mt the m ddle of this propo
siuofi but that is no pa t oi my pre=ent bu mess An 1 1 have

own govert mem many final action on this subject but only
as suggesting liobabie grounds for urging the piopnety of
ca ttion a d foibearance in what we may propose todo in le
gaid to laying a duty at this time on coffee It isq lite possi
bU* that we may shodly have important negotiations to con
duct with Brazil, m regard to out commercial relations with
that power
I say again then sir that I should greitly prefer not now to
go a3 far as is proposed in th s bill n (he revision of the tariff

which we may get in vaiim  ways before we come together

ou of office there w^re hanging over this Government debts,
cla nis ind liabilities waich (me uon g a ei i able balarte to
remain in tie rrea*iiry)imoiif,ied to not less than $10000000,
md I oehev*1 a very laige poaion of this sum will l^ve to be
provided for within the ioui yeaie of the present Administra
tion Ue have alreaty passed a bill Ui raieing S12000,000 by
loan I think: we shall have to provide for at least as much
more within the four years, the whole of which will be m addi
«on to tie expenditures for current sen ice This would make
$24 000 000 to be paid, in all, foi public debt, or an average of
$6,000 000 ayear, which added to the yearly expenditure for
current serv ice, makes up a total of $28,500,000
This I believe to be the least sum which the Ti easiiry must
bear yearly for current support and the public debt during the
term rf the piesent Administration, The question is, where is
the money to come from? It muot be raised in some mode, m
the shape of revenue for smely it is not mten led that we shall
perpetuate the present public debt by borrowing, and borrowing
again, a.id adding to tha debt constantly by the same pioccss,
as we must do unlcs wc report piomp ly to some mode of rais
mg a moie ample revenue than seems to 1 e in the contempla
tion of many gentlemen on this floor Anl i his brings me to
speak oí the a mj romise act, so much the sub ect of comment
on all bides of flnsHouse
In the first place, can we rai^-eievenue e ough bv duties on
imports, within the maximum 1 mited by tint act1  forrobody
thinks s nous y of r using revenue, at this tin , by any other
m de    Si«- it iS demonstrable that we cannot
Tie maximum ib 20 percent and if that maximum should
b*, imposed on the whole amount of importan n", excepting only
btillu n and specie an 1 a few articles of con parativdy tr fling
value enumerate! in the fifth section of the comí, lomise act,
wh ch mustal\\a)s come in reeoidutj the amount of netti eve
nue produced would he about ®20,S9u 030 I take the- annual
impoitsat S140 000000 as estimated by the Secretary of the
l reasjry on i comparison of tht, importa for the las' seven
yeir  Only $14^00 000 are deductel from this sum for
the ha lion an 1 specie anl other mieles which must be a i
mi ted free Wvme the amount on which it is possible to lew
dun s atS125 700 0GO Twentv pet cent on this sum would
j induct a 21 jss imou t of $23140 000 out of which mu t
cone Sl,250 000 for drawbacks bounties and expenses of
collection, accord ng to the Seer tary s estimate, which
brines us to the result of a nett revenue by this piocess of
$20 S90 000
This, it must be remembered, is the la«t and most violent re
sou of the compiomtseact it is turning the screw for the last
time, and such is ¡heiesult Wewantmthe I reasury twenty
eigi t ind a half milhon^ ayear we can eet from customs un
dei this act aoo-ut twenty million*, ind h half which leaves the
lieasuiy minus emht nnlliona ^year If we should continue
to keLp the public Jaitkas avonr e of revenue when. I tiu^t
we hall nat, to the gieit injuiv of the j pt rights 01 the State 
s ill the-ewoullbei yearly deficit of 9  000 000
Well sir this bungs us to a point an I a s 1 id where we must
decide on our course We have but one alternative we must
have more and more bon owing, or we must raise duties beyond
the 20 pel cent maximum For one, I do not hesitate, I go for
higher duties
Butwe aie told m various quaiter", that the compromise act
1= sicred and must not be toucheJ—a barrier which must
not be overleape 1 ¡sir, without íegatding that act as a nt w
Constitution, 01 subscribing to a! that has been sail about its
sacred character and binding obligations I have been wilhrg
anl anxious, ard I still am to pr^btive and adheie to i s
«pint and its terms as far as it is pract cablp to do o ^how
me ho v revenue enough is tobe obtai le I within the maximum
of that act for the ^xu sol th G ivernment, preserving at
the same time, the ^j rt ¡In* 1 tftut 1 t in other re

t andiiure certa  ly, and oich as couict not have been suti^i-
pated when the compromise act was framed At any ra ^, «.he
relation w ach revenue fiom customs alon bore to expenditure,
111 four years, from January, 1833, to 31st JUecember, 1840, is
plain enough and easily stated The revenue from customs
was in all a little less ttun sixty fourmUhons, the expenditures
for current service and support alone, were more than one hun
dred and twelve millions and all this time not one half the
reduc ion in duties had taken place which were contemplated
by the compromise act
Well, sir, on the 4th of March last a new Administration
came in, and w nix what financial prospects lor its term of four
years'1 A heav> debt thrown upon it, an expensive war 01
our hands a pressing necessity for heavy expenditures for de
fenceb and all the while a 1 eduction oí dutjpson imports going
on steiddy under existing laws, ano the e dudes weie to be
the only source of revenue left to the Government feir, will
anybody now contend that it was suppo ed or believed by any
body in 1833, that the maximum oí duties prescribed by the
compromise act could stand 01 ought to stand, m the face of
such a state of things^ It would be an imoeachment of the
comm inest wisdom and foresight, m ho*e who had a princi
pa! hand in that measure, to say so or to think so No, sn,
that maximum must have been inter de*1 to be not a fixed, but
a variable quantity whishma^t of necessity yield to the exi
gencies of thetime feuppiseawar should breik out with the
Indian tribes along our ilnoat mteiminable wettem boiders

extraordinary expenditure but with reference to what etpen
ence might prove m rega-d to ordinary expenditure and ordi
nary returns from customs when the compromise act should
come to have or approich us fuil operation and efTecf
Well, sir, I have come to he cojiclu^ion that it will be mdio
p nsdb e that we pioceed, at the nexfe^ion of Congree*, to re
construct the whole tariff passing beyond the lim tation by
wt-ich the compiomise act woul 1 restnct the im| osi onofdu

But *Jir I de ire to be 11 lder* 001 on thi-- pu1 j c There is
moie matter n tint act than merely the maxim an referred fo,
anl because I find a necessity for passing over that single re
stricfion lam not therefore, to b? taken as desirous, or even
willing, that in reconsti uctmg the tariff we shall piss wholly out
of sight of that let I wish to keep steadily in new, particu-
larly since there ar ,beieand m the country important per
sons and parties who aie disposed to insist upon it I am wil-
ling at least to try fairly the experiment proposed in that act, I
am for preserving us spirit and its general des sn, and its
terms isfai as the unavoidable necessities oí this Government
will allow
Mr Chairman there are two cardinal points embr iced m that
