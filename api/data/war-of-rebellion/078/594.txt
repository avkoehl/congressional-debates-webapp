DEMOPOLIS, ALA., May 11, 1864.

Major-General FORREST,

Tupelo, Miss.:

Your dispatch received; the following from General Adams, near Benton:

Enemy has remained motionless all day, apparently in readiness for attack. Cannot divine the purpose of the expedition, unless it be to detain troops here while a movement is made by his cavalry against Forrest. Such an expedition is freely spoken of in Vicksburg.

You will look to this force from Memphis at once.

S. D. LEE,

Commanding Department.

Dispatch relative to Forrest's DIVISION received. * Forrest is threatened from Moscow. Everything reported quiet at Decatur. With information now before me do not deem the move expeditious now. Answer.
