tariff bill.
The SPEAKERpro tempore, (Mr. Wheeler. )
The House is in session as in Committee of
the Whole on the state of the Union, for de-
bate -only, ott the bill (H. R. No. 1068) to
amend existing laws relating to the duty on
imports, and 'for other purposes.
Mr. HAY addressed the committee. [His
remarks will be published in the Appendix.]
Mr. STRICKLAND. Mr. Speaker, the ques-
tion under consideration is One of great import-
ance in its relation to the growth and prosperity
of our country.
The people of the country, for thepurpose
of this discussion, may be properly divided into
three classes, which may be denominated or
designated producers, consumers, and carriers.
The first class named, the producers, are
never prosperous unless they find the second
class, the consumers, sufficiently numerous to
buy whatever they may have to dispose of.
Whenever the production is beyond the de-
mand the producer suffers; and, on the other
hand, when the demand is beyond the supply
the consumer of necessity must submit to ex-
orbitant prices. The existence of these two
classes causes the third class, the carriers, and
this class is strong and prosperous or weak
and suffering just in proportion to the dis-
tance between the producer andconsumer.
The entire cost of this carrying business
must be paid by the producers and consumers.
This feet demonstrates beyond any kind of
question that every dollar unnecessarily paid
to the carrier is atl absolute loss; therefore it
is clear'that this class should be limited to the
least number of men and the smallest number
of dollars which can be employed in furnish-
ing the necessities of life.
In the ratio1 of reduction in this carrying
business will come wealth to the other two
Classes. This can only be done by shortening
the distance between the producer and the con-
sumer. Any system of legislation that shall
tend to distribute the different branches of
business over the country is in the right direc-
tion. Whenevert-heproducetandconsumerare
found together this loss of carrying is saved
and goes into the credit side of the aceount.
In the States where the products of the soil
are to any considerable extent required to feed
the manufacturer, or in other Words, where the
producer and consumer are Sido by side, the
most rapid advance in wealth and population
is found.
For the purpose of illustrating this position
contrast the States of Michigan and Iowa. I
select fbwa for the comparison in order to pre-
sent the question faifly. She has made more
rapid progress than any other State principally
engaged in agricultural pursuits. Under the
censusof1860 each State was entitled to six Rep-
resentatives in Congress. Each of said States
is well adapted to agriculture. Iowa has done
but little ill the matter of manufacture, while
Michigan has made considerable progress in
that direction, taking the front rank among the
younger States. Michigan has found a home
market for a large portion of her agricultural
products and has paid the carrier loss money;
while Iowa, for want of consumers, has been
compelled to send to a distant market her large
surplus of agricultural products, paying largely
to the carrier. In 1868 Michigan cast SI,000
more votes than Iowa, indicating, that she had
increasedin population 180,000 more than Iowa
in the eight years from 1800 to 1868.
The incidental protection to the manufac-
tures of our own country has been the basis
of this rapid growth in Michigan.
I propose to give some facts and figures bear-
ing upon the lumber, salt, and mining inter-
