APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
41st Cong.... 2d Sess.
Postal Telegraphs-Mr. Washburn.
Ho. of Reps.
According to the pamphlet before alluded to
and published during the present year, the
Western Union Company has 50,760 miles.of
line, and 97,416 miles of wjre, and the value
of the same they estimate at $47,ยง77,350 61,
or $943 21 per mile of line.
As before observed, they nowhere say that
their lines have cost any such sum, but to prove
that they have, they say that " the average cost
of a mile of line ia England and Ireland is in
currency $1,029 71, in Belgium $274 14, in Ba-
varia $240, in France $351 75, or an average
of $610 76 a tttile of line. Taking the average
cost per mile of telegraph line in England as a
basis for calculation of the cost of the Western
Union lines, we have a total value of $52,166,-
079 60. If we estimate the cost of our lines by
the average cost of all the telegraph lines in
Europe of which any statistics ean be obtained
we have a total value of $31,002,177 60."
To understand properly the fairness of these
estimates it should be stated that the lines of
Great Britain average five wires, and France
and Belgium each three wires, while the West-
ern Union averages a trifle less than two wires.
A glance at the figures given to swell the aver-
age cost of the European lines will prove their
falsity; for how can it be possible that a mile
of line should cost in England $1,029 71, and
only $274 14 in Belgium and $240 in Bavaria?
This statement as to the cost of telegraph
lines in Europe is repeated in a late report of
the Western Union Company, signed by the
president of that company. He says on page 31:
"The average eost of telegraph lines per mile in
England, as sworn to before tho committee of tho
House of Commons in July. 1868. was $718 75 in gold.
Upon this basis our lines are worth $37,446,156, which
after the payment of the bonded debt would leave
$83 per share in gold for the stock."
Now, I undertake to say that this statement
ia wholly erroneous. On reading it I became
satisfied that it could not be true, and I accord-
ingly addressed a note to Mr. Scudamore_ call-
ing his attention to the statement, to which I
received a reply which I will append, and from
which it will be seen that the total cost of
building, maintaining, and working a mile of
telegraph line for fifteen or sixteen years was
less than half of what Mr. Orten says that the
bare building of a mile of line has cost in that
country.
I have before me Mr. Scudamore's report
made to Lord Stanley of Alderly, alluded to in
the letter I have read, which shows conclu-
sively that he never could have given testimony
bearing the construction put upon it by the
president of the Western Union Company.
I have carefully looked over the testimony
of the witnesses before the parliamentary com-
mission, and the only testimony I find bearing
upon the question of cost of a mile of telegraph
in Great Britain is in that of R. S. Cully, esq.,
engineer in chief to the Electric and Inter-
national Telegraph Company, with which he
had been connected twenty-two years :
" Question 960, by committee. Whatupon the average
is the cost per mile of telegraph posts and wires, say
for two wires?
Answer. Twenty-three or twenty-four pounds a
mile to do fcho work properly. More in some oases
and in some cases less."
The following is the cost, derived from official
sources, of constructing telegraph lines in the
countries named:
Average enxtper mile of line.
France   $215 19
Belgium  186 83
Switzerland      171 86
Prussia    233 78
Bavaria     16S 10
Average east per mile of wire.
France         $65 25
Belgium  65 83
Switzerland   101 07
Prussia       ,    70 85
Bavaria  71 04
It will be seen that an average of the cost
of a mile of line in these countries is $198 50
and $74 80 for a mile of wire. Of course the
above figures are in gold. It is not likely that
the average of British lines will vary much
from these figures. I have received and have
before me the financial report of the Electric
and International Telegraph Campany, a com-
pany which occupies about the same position iu
England that the Western Union does in this
country, owning 45,672 miles of wire out of
80,466, the total number of miles in the kingdom.
The cost of construction, including preliminary
expenses, is put down at ยฃ727,103 18a. 8d., or
equal to 4! 15 19s. per mile of wire. That the
Western Union may have no further excuse for
misrepresentation, I would publish this state-
ment in full in the Globe, except that it' would
occupy too much apace, but anybody can see it
who desires. On the basis of the cost of this prin-
cipal English line the property of the Western
Union would be worth about $8,000,000in gold.
It will not be denied that it costs more to
build a mile of telegraph line in this country
than in those named. In the item of poles,
which is the largest by far in the construction
of single telegraph lines, the cost in this coun-
try is considerably less than in the countries
named, where timber is scarce and poles are
brought from Canada and Norway. In the
item of wire the eost in this country would
exceed that of Belgium by the amount of duty
thereon. It is reasonable to suppose that the
saving on the poles would balance the excess
of the cost of wire, so that the real difference
would be found in the difference of the price
of the labor employed in erecting the lines;
but as the total amount of labor in this coun-
try, as already shown, is only about fifteen
dollars per mile, the difference of the cost be-
tween this country and the countries named
would be inconsiderable.
As furnishing additional evidence of the oost
of their lines, the Western Union Company in-
voke the testimony of Mr. (r. B. Prescott, &s
before named, and this involves the necessity
of inquiring into the statements of the witness,
which are sought to be imposed upon Congress.
Mr.Prescott is understood to be in the employ of
the Western Union Telegraph Company, and to
be experienced in the arts of telegraphy. In I860
he published a work, as I have before stated, on
the electric telegraph, and in that work lie puts
the cost of constructing lines at that time at
$6180 per mile. The same he repeats inhis edi-
tioninl8G6. Saidhe: "Thisisaboutthecostof
the construction of a majority of our lines; but
if built as they should be they would cost $150
per mile." Now, as over fifty thousand miles
of the present telegraph lines were built and in
operation in 1860, the year Mr. Prescott's last
edition appeared, it follows that a majority of
these lines, or over twenty-five thousand miles,
were built for $61 80 per mile. Bat when the
Postmaster General late ia 1866 called on Mr.
Prescott for his views on the subject they are
found to have undergone a marvelous change,
and in his reply he says:
"A substantial telegraph line constructed on the
line of a railroad, with cedar or chestnut poles thirty
feet in length and six inches at the top by twelve at
the butt, set forty to the mile, with most .improved
form of insulator and best galvanized,wire, would
cost $400 per mile for a single wire; additional wires
would cost $200 per mile."
That the cost of constructing amile of tele-
graph line has largely increased since the war,
is admitted. That increase probably reaches
fifty per cent., and possibly may reach seventy-
five per cent., bat certainly no more. Yet Mr.
Prescott makes a jump from $61 80 to $400
per mile, and says that each additional mile of
wire will cost ยง200, at which it will be seen a
line of six wire3 would cost $1,400. The West-
ern Union Company in their pamphlet quote
and indorse the statement of Mr. Prescott, but
while professing to quote accurately they sup-
press the statement made by him that ''addt-
tional wires would cost $200 per mile." This
statement alone brands him as an unreliable
witness, to use no harsher language; and the
suppression of his so transparently raise state-
ment is not honorable to the managers ot the
company. That the statement was false is im-
mediately proved by their own estimate of the
cost of a line to New York which follows the
statement of Prescott, for there they only claim
the cost of a mile of wire to be forty dollars.
Having shown that all their estimates and
conclusions are false, I wish to show what the
actual cosfc will beto establish better lines than
the Western Union Company. That company
claims to have 50,760 miles of line and 97,416
miles of wire. Of what is the cost of thsse
lines made up ? Referring to their own state-
ments we find that the items are oost of poles,
arms, wire, insulators, and labor. At 30 poles
per mile, there would be required for 50,760
miles of line 1,522,800 poles. The cost of
poles would depend on the location where
used; but it is safe to say that the average
would not exeeed two dollars each, or $3,045,-
600; but experienced men in building lines
inform me that the average would not exceed
ยง1 25. Ninety-seven thousand four hundred
and sixteen miles of wire, at forty dollars per
mile, (being the estimate of the three presi-
dents, and which is too high by twenty-five per
cent.,) would cost $3,898,640; 1,522,800 arms,
at twenty-five cents each, would cost $380,700;
3,045,600 insulators, at ten cents each, $304,-
560. Add for labor of erecting lines twenty
dollars per mile for 50,760 miles, $1,015,200;
the whole cost would then foot up as follows :
1,522,800 polos, for 50,760 miles line at $2 $3,0i5.600
97.416 miles wiro, at $40 per mile  3,896,640
1,522,800 arms, at 25 cents oaah  380,700
3,045,600 insulators, at 20 cents.... 
Labor of eroetion, at $20 iter mile  1,015,200
lotal      8,947,760
which is a fair estimate of the cost of the West-
ern Union lines; and I think that I shall be
able to demonstrate that that sum is all they have
actually cost. With all these evidences that I
have produced to show the gross exaggeration
by the Western Union Company of the cost of
its lines I might well be content to stop here,
but I shall not stop. That company has un-
fortunately betrayed itself in its late report to
its stockholders issued a few weeks since. On
page 10 they say that from July 1, 1866, to July
1, 1869, the company "constructed7,968miles
of poles and 18,127 miles of wire; and referring
to page 23 of same report we find that the cost
at which it was constructed was $1,238,870 11,
or equal to $155 50 fo  a mile of line and $69
per mile of wire.
I have shown that the average cost per mile
in Europe is $74 80 per mile of wire. At the
same rate the 97,416 miles of the Western
Union telegraph would cost $7,186,716 in gold.
It is my deliberate judgment that $10,000,000,
the amount in currency that was so cheerfully
voted away to pay for Alaska, will establish
more and better lines than the entire lines of
the Western Union Company and bring the
use of the telegraph within the reach of the
humblest among us. .
But I am not disposed to drive a hard bar-
gain ; I would not have the Government set up
an opposition business unless as a last resort.
Let the Government buy existing lines and pay
a fair price. ,
In securing bo great a boon as this is to be,
I would not haggle over small matters. Let
the Government buy out the lines, transfer the
management to the Post Office Department,
and reduce at once the cost of telegraphing to
a uniform rate for any distance to twenty cents
for twenty words, and you will bring blessings
and benefits to millions of our people who have
heretofore been deprived of the use of the tele-
graph. The mind can scarcely comprehend
the vast advantages to the whole country that
will ensue if this system is adopted. The ex-
perience of cheap telegraphy in Europe has
demonstrated that sixty per cent, of dispatches
sent are upon social or family matters, while
here it is rarely used except upon urgent "usi-
ness, A money-order system such as is adopted
in Europe would be of incalculable benebt to
the whole country, and would stimulate and
