leave to visit the company I did not expect such a course would be pursued. I am compelled, therefore, to forbid any visiting, only in company with an officer of the C. S. Army.

When the men are to be visited Captain James Duff will accompany the officer, or some other officer will detailed by him.

Memorandum relating to the arrest of Colonel Waite, U. S. Army, and the officers of the Army on duty at San Antonio, Tex.

SAN ANTONIO, TEX., April 23, 1861.

Captain WILCOX (with his sword, commanding Texas troops). Good morning, colonel. (At Colonel Waite's quarters, Colonel Waite and Major Sprague only present.)

Colonel WAITE. Good morning, sir.

Captain WILCOX. I have come to request you to go ovin's office.

Colonel WAITE. For what purpose, sir?

Captain WILCOX. As a prisoner of war.

" Thereupon Captain Wilcox said, "I have the force," and started for the public storehouse, and immediately returned with thirty-six footmen, Texas troops, armed with rifles and saber bayonets. The command was halted in front of Colonel Waite's quarters, when Captain Wilcox entered the house. Colonel Waite then walked to the door, and upon looking out remarked, "is that your guard, sir?" "Yes, sir," replied Captain Wilcox. "These are more men," remarked Colonel Waite, "than I can resist, and I against protest, in the name of my country, against this gross and unwarranted act of usurpation and the violation of personal rights. where do you wish me to go, sir?" "To the ordnance office, sir," said Captain Wilcox.

Colonel Waite then took his hat and passed to the front of the guard, when arms were shouldered, and the crowd proceeded through the pub-
