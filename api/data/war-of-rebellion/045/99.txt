Major-General SEDGWICK,

Commanding Sixth Corps:

GENERAL: The major-general commanding directs that you post a brigade and a battery on the roads approaching Stafford CourtHouse from Berea Church and Hartwood Church, to cover the passage of the trains, &amp;c., and remain until Hancock comes up. This force will guard particularly against any force that may come from that direction; skirmishers well out. The general says your trains move slowly and cause much delay. He desires that you will use every exertion to push them through rapidly. If your headquarters can be at Stafford Court-House to-night, you will be in telegraphic communication with the general at Dumfries.
