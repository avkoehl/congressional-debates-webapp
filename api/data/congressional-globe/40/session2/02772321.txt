Mr. PIKE, from the same committee,
ported back, with the recommendation that
do pass, the bill (S. No. 410) for the relief
of John S. Cunningham, paymaster United
States Navy.
The bill directs the proper accounting offi-
cers of the Government, in the settlement of
the accounts of John S. Cunningham, paymas-
ter United States Navy, to allow a credit to
him of $1,071 07, the amount of public money
stolen from the money chest of the United
States frigate Colorado while said chest was
under his charge.
Mr. MAYNARD. Is there a report ?
Mr. SPALDING. I would like to hear the
report in this case.
Mr. PIKE. A report accompanies the bill,
and I ask that it be read. It is a matter of
$1,000, and the report explains it.
The report wasread. It sets forth that Joliu
S. Cunningham is a paymaster in the Navy,
and during the years 1805 and 1866 was fleet
paymaster on board the United States frigate
Colorado, flagship of the United States Euro-
pean squadron. Between the months of Au-
gust, 1865, and February, 1866, the safe in
which he kept the public money on board that
ship was repeatedly opened by Riley and Watts,
two seamen belonging to the ship, and money
was abstracted therefrom, said by Paymaster
Cunningham to amount to $1,071 07, for which
robbery, after tiial and conviction, the pris-
oners themselves confessing the acts, the said
Riley and Watts were sentenced to five years'
imprisonment and a forfeiture of all pay and
allowances due or to become due to them. It
does not appear that the petitioner was in any
way careless or remiss, and the committee
recommend the passage of the bill for his
relief.
Mr. UPSON. I would like to inquire whether
there is any other evidence as to theamountof
the loss except the statement of the claimant?
Mr. PIKE. There is none.
Mr. UPSON. Is it not rather a loose rule
to take his word for the amount?
Mr. PIKE. I will state in relation to tins
matter that this loss occurred on board tho
steamship Colorado. The money was taken
from the chest from time time by means of
false keys by two seamen, and the theft was
discovered by one of the confederates confess-
ing it to the surgeon. Tt seems that Paymas-
ter Cunningham discovered from time to time
that money had been taken. He is, by the
testimony of all his associates, a very careful
man, careful in the management of the money
and of the safe, which was, of itself, of a very-
poor quality. This thing ran along for some
months, and finally, by a confession made to
the surgeon, it was discovered who the parties
who stole the money were. They were then
arraigned and tried by court-martial; the men
were convicted, and the judgment of the court
having been approved by Admiral Groldsbor-
ough, they are now serving out their sentence.
