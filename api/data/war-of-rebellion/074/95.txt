While examining the surrounding country by my direction, Major C. J. Stolbrand, chief of artillery of the corps, a gallant and untiring officer, was captured by a squad of the enemy's cavalry.

The command rested at this point until the morning of the 23d, by which time twenty days' supplies had been procured. On the 23rd I moved nearly south, on Van Wert road, crossing the Etowah River at Wooley's Bridge, and camping at night on the Euharlee Creek, making a distance of eighteen miles. May 24, I marched through Van Wert toward Dallas, a distance of eight miles. May 25, advanced to Pumpkin Vine Creek, camping in line of battle. Hearing heavy firing in the direction of Dallas, and learning from deserters and others that the enemy were near that place in heavy force, commanded by Johnston in person, I moved my command forward cautiously on the 26th, with a strong advance guard and flankers. General Dodge's command advanced on my left. The cavalry force, assisted by my artillery, having after a spirited skirmish, driven away the enemy's light troops, which were confronting us, on the west side of Dallas, we entered and marched through the town, taking the powder Springs road to the eastward. At the distance of two miles beyond the town the enemy was found by our skirmishers in heavy force, occupying strong field-works. I caused their line to be felt of sharply, and by night had developed its general position, the general course of which was north-northeast and south-west, extending across the Powder Springs and Marietta road,s with their flanks well advanced. I immediately placed my command in position, as shown in accompanying plan (Numbers 2*), Harrow's division being on the right, extending just across the Villa Rica road, Morgan L. Smith i the center, crossing the Marietta road, and Osterhaus on the left, connecting with General Dodge's command. Our right was afterward joined by the mounted infantry of Wilder's brigade. In this position I caused the most favorable line of works practicable to be thrown up during the night. On the 27th heavy skirmishing and artillery firing was kept up during the entire day. In the afternoon a strong demonstration was made by the enemy upon General Harrow's front, which was checked promptly by his troops. The 28th opened with rapid skirmishing, which continued until 3.30 o'clock in the afternoon, when the enemy (afterward ascertained to be Hardee's entire command, estimated by prisoners to be 25,000) made determined assaults, in columns of regiments, on the most assailable positions along our entire front. The first assault was on Harrow, and was made directly down the line of the Villa Rica road, the weakest point in our whole position. The road there runs directly up he backbone of a ridge, which curved continuously to our right and constantly increased in height. It had been considered impracticable to carry our line far enough forward across this ridge to overcome this objectionable point, without weakening it too much elsewhere in thus adding to its length. The enemy at this point approached within 150 yards, without either having been seen or exposed to our fire. His assault was made in columns of regiments, and with the utmost dash and confidence. three guns of the First Iowa Battery, which had been run out on the skirmish line, were temporarily surrounded by the enemy. they cannot be said, however, to have been in his possession
