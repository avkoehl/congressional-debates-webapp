This skirmish I regard as quite a success; not a man on our side killed or wounded.

Smyrna is the place where arms, &amp;c., for [the] Confederate States have been landed, and the enemy were seeking to capture them. The enemy are preparing to advance from Jacksonville to Baldwin to cut them off there.

I have the honor to subscribe myself, respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. S. DILWORTH,

Colonel, Commanding.

Numbers 1. Report of Brigadier General Egbert L. Viele, U. S. Army.

DAUFUSKIE ISLAND, S. C., March 30, 1862.

GENERAL: I inclose a report from Major Beard. This is the third report on the iron-clad vessels. In case the vessels of the Navy are withdrawn, I can suggest no other plan than supplying their place with schooners armed with rifled guns and howitzers, and occupied by an infantry force-one in Mud River, one in Wright River, one at mouth of New River, and one in Cooper River. No batteries on land can possibly be erected to accomplish the results that would be obtained by these floating batteries.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

EGBERT L. VIELE,

Brigadier-General.

Numbers 2. Report of Major Oliver T. Beard, Forty-eighth New York Infantry.

BATTERY HAMILTON, GA., March 28, 1862.

CAPTAIN: I have the honor to report that I this day made a reconnaissance of the land about the mouth of Saint Augustine Creek. The best view was obtained from the summit of the upper Coast Survey station, on Elba Island. I send you a sketch of observations. The only rebel pickets about the mouth of Saint Augustine are stationed at the points indicated. In case of an attempt to cut them off their only chance of escape would be by swimming the bayou.
