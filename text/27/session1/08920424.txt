Case of McTétod—Mr. Linn.
H. of Reps
quence in ftvet of hbtrty in South America, upon the same
basut upon  which they were placed by the iron pen of the gen
tiemanirom Massachusetts, [Mr   Adams, then (Secretary of
State ] sanctioned by the name and influence oí the then Presi
dent, James Monroe, and  this, too, done m a language and
manner of which any patriot or diplomat may b  pioud    The
gentleman from Pennsylvania has indeed said, the paper was
too beautiful    The gentleman is a scholar, and, assuch, I punt
to him to show me a paper, in ancient or modern times, more
severely chaste, more simple, moie direct in its purpose, or un
ambiguous in its tone    The paper is indeed beautiful, most
beautiful, but like all papers emanating from its author, its
beauty consists m its want of all factitious ornament its pure
and unadultered English, audits irresistible strength of argu
ment.   It puts forward two gi eat but entirely distinct proposi
Hon?    The one, that M'Leod may be personally purtected, un
dei orders of his Government or its officers, amounting to com
pulsion    The other that the "Britibh Government must show
a necessity of self defence, instant, overwhelming, leaving no
chotce-of means, and no moment for delibei ation "   And what
A menean doubts the con ectness of either of these pi oposmons1
Who would have allowed General Jackson, or his humblest
iol'ower to have suffered personally for any of the necessary
acts growingout of the invasion ot Honda, then a piovmce of
a powti with whteh we were in amity and peace, 01 foi the ex
ecutioa of Arbuthnot and Ambiister?    And who will allow
England to escape the consequences oí an invasion of om boil,
and the destruction of the Caroline, unless she can make out the
t ase made by us in the Florid i invasion—a cist appiovedby
fepam by England, nay, by the civilized woild"?   &oone,no
one, and, leastof all, the pie^ent Admtnist) ation
1 have now, sir, given you my leasons, as briefly as I could
aftei the course this debate had taken, for voting against the i<
solution under consideration, aid for believing thi-3 whole sub

SPEECH OP MR. LINN,
OP  NEW  YORK
In the House of Representatives, July 10, 18it—On the
following resolution ofieted by Mr Tlo\d
Resole?^ That the President of the United States be le
quoted to inform this Hous , if not incompatible with the
public service, whether anyofficei ol the aimy or the Attorney
General of the United States has, since the 4th March last,

Mr LlNN-Ak!  I do v\ot n^c, Mr   speaker, to puitucthio

it has been con hicttd     rhe resolution hefoie the Ifoiibe in

tobe treatul as a mere naui&an question    Had it bten tieued
otherwise,I should not hiveintituled myself upon the House
X cannot feci under any obligations to my paxty, whilt debating
aquesuon, on which icsults so solemn and tenous depend
jNo, sir, I rise at the impulse of the moment to dischatge adu
ty, which I feel is due to the country, not to the Adminisua
ti m or even to the Secretary ot Sute, demolished as he m iy
it wn been by the speech of my colleague, [Mr   Gordon ]

subject The answei of Mv Webster to the iasr letter of the
British Minuter, meets iheit entire and coidial approbation
They do not view a single Une os his correspondence, or a sin
gle movement ol the Government on th* subject, other than as
consistent with the sovereign rights of theState and the national
Ghatacter and honor They find no capitulation of right oi
honor, no impioper conceesioi, no one jubtmable cause for the
complaints which a factious* opposition have <=o suddenly gene
rated, and -which they nurse so assiduously McLeod, who
stmds indicted tor an offence against hei laws, is m the hands
of thp adminístralos of her laws—m legal durance, awauing
not the action oftheFedeial Government, not the demands of
the Butish Minister, but a full and fair adjudication of his cas°,
conformable with well established principles ol Saw, to be dp
plied by an independent and enlightened mdiciary The State
oi New York findsno cause foi complaint in the íecogniuon by
the Fedeial Go\einment¿íf those plain ttrinctples of public law,
and the u^age s oí civilized ^late1*, by which alone McLeod can
escape, if guilty of the crime for whish he is indicted ^he
finds  no desne, cithenn an obstinate adherence to State rights,
or in a fdh>e patriotism, to refuse ag^ent to a rule oí national Uw,
