should fall back and make a strike across the country at Yazoo City or do something else to draw off the rebel force from Vicksburg and again come to the charge.

I am, general, very truly, your obedient servant,

SAML. R. CURTIS,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF EASTERN ARKANSAS,Helena, December 23, 1862.

Major-General GRANT:

I will start 2,000 cavalry to the Tallahatchie to-morrow, will be at mouth of Coldwater the 25th. If they can cross they will come to Oxford; if not, will wait a day or two to hear from you. But if it comes on rain we must return to the Mississippi River, as they cannot cross the river bottom and would be cut off by mire and overflow. General Sherman will be at the mouth of Yazoo on the 24th.

I have infantry at Friar's Point.

W. A. GORMAN,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

Major-General GRANT:

An order was issued for the troops at Grand Junction and La Grange to fall back to Bolivar. They were unable to obey on account of the enemy being in their rear. Shall I reissue the order? No news of the rebels. I will be able to reach Trenton to-day with cars.

The order to fall back to Bolivar was countermanded. I now have three regiments of cavalry and four of infantry besides the old garrison there; think they will be able to take car of all the rebels this side of Bolivar.
