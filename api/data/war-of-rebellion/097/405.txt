ordered the division commander to keep his line advanced with Ord's, and had it examined yesterday by one of my best staff officers. It was reported to me yesterday that Ord's line was farther upstream than mine, but that the reason was that the ground on my side was better where Hays' line was for every object then in view than a position on line with General Turner's, and that it was thus mutually understood between the two division commanders. I was about proceeding to the right of my line when your communication reached me. I was on my General Meade. I inclose copies of General Ord's dispatch and of General Hays' report of an attempted attack upon the Crow house work yesterday. I should add that direction were issued by me this morning for every preparation to be made to carry out the instructions respecting the Crow house work.

P. S.-Colonel Hazard, whom I sent to examine the work again to-day, has just returned and informs me that the chief of artillery of General Gibbon [or perhaps of General Ord] stated to him that the batteries will not be finished before night, a statement which his own opinion confirmed upon an examination of them.
