early to-day, but the inclemency of the weather and unfavorable condition of the roads have dissuaded me from attempting it at present. I give the statement for what it is worth. It is the general impression that the enemy is gone.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

My men who went out to repair line near Etowah bridge returned, and report that the line was cut in two places, and a rail taken up from the railroad track at a point two miles and a half beyond Allatoona, by a party of twenty-five rebels, and that a patrol was fired on by them, killing 1 man and wounding 1.

CAMP NEAR NOYES' CREEK, June 18, 1864-8.30 p. m.

Major ECKERT,

Washington, D. C.:

All last night and until 5 p. m. to-day it has rained heavily till the creek is a river and every rivulet a line of defense. No material progress. General Sherman still in doubt as to Johnston's design, but thinks we shall get the trial of strength here, or hopes so; said to me "to-morrow will tell that." Twenty-two hundred cavalry said to have gone around our left to strike railroads. Can't harm us; if so, it's too late.

J. C. VAN DUZER.
