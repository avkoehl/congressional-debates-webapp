HEADQUARTERS, In Front of the Enemy, May 6, 1864-7.20 a.m.

[Colonel F. T. LOCKE:]

COLONEL: The disposition have been made as ordered by general. The enemy have a strong line of entrenchments in our front, an open space in front of Griffin which is swept by his artillery. My left is strongly felt by the enemy. I am closely connected with Griffin's right, and already to advance. My skirmish line has been attacked twice in same place.

S. W. CRAWFORD,Brigadier-General.

MAY 6, 1864.

General CRAWFORD:

As soon as General Griffin replaces your forces by his (a heavy skirmish line), bring your brigade to my headquarters.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.

BATTLE-FIELD, May 6, 1864-11 a.m.

General WARREN:

The order received by Lieutenant Higbee has been carried into effect, and one brigade has moved to the entrenchments. This movement has left my left entirely exposed, and the enemy, taking advantage of it, has made an attack upon it, which has been repulsed. There is an immediate necessity for troops on my left.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. W. CRAWFORD,

Brigadier-General.

MAY 6, 1864.

(Received 11.15 a.m.)

General CRAWFORD:

You can recall your brigade, if you need it. Throw your left back and strengthen it.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS, May 6, 1864-12.30 a.m.

General CRAWFORD:

You must attack the enemy to-morrow [to-day] at 5 a.m., May 6. By 3 a.m. you must move line to the right, so as to connect with General Griffin, relieving the Maryland Brigade, which you will direct to move out to the open field to their rear, mass,and await orders. You must replenish your ammunition to-night. My headquarters are at the Lacy house. When you march forward let your line of march be due west and your line of battle perpendicular. Keep closed in toward General Griffin on your right, and double back your left, so as to prevent a flank fire from any force you may drive back.

G. K. WARREN,Major-General, Commanding.
