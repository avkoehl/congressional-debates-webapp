5th of December last, was in close confinement at Camp Morton some three weeks ago. As I have released and delivered to you every prisoner who has been so confined in the South, including even deserters and those charged with being speis, will you not order the release of Captain Castleman and have him delivered to our authorities?

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

RO. OULD,

Agent of Exchange.

RICHMOND, March 9, 1865.

Lieutenant Colonel JOHN E. MULFORD, Assistant Agent of Exchange:

SIR: It has been credibly represented to me that Charles W. Meeks, C. S. collector in Tennessee, was captured at Bristol on or about the 15th of December last and taken to Knoxville, where he and his son, William B. Meeks, not yet sixteen years of age, are still confined in jail, the former on a charge of treason for holding the office of collector under the Confederate States Government and the latter on a totally unfounded charge of bushwhacking. I will think you to take immediate steps for inquiry into this matter, that you may inform me what are the purposes of your authorities.

In view of the course I have pursued in relation to civilian prisoners, will you not have them promplty released?

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

RO. OULD,

Agent of Exchange.
