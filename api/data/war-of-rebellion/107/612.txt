GENERAL ORDERS, HEADQUARTERS OF DIVISION, Numbers 51. Near West Point, Va., May 10, 1862.

The general commanding congratulates the officers and men of the command upon their gallant conduct and success in the action of the 7th instant near West Point. Landing upon a hostile shore, with no knowledge of the country inland or of the force that would be likely to meet them, they were attacked by the enemy with immense superiority of numbers before the landing was completed. They not only regained their ground after having been repulsed by a greatly superior force, but gained an advanced position, from which they could not be driven by all the efforts of the enemy. The general commanding expected much from his division, and it has so far come fully up to his expectations. So good a commencement augurs well for the final reputation of the division and the success of the cause.

By order of Brigadier-General Franklin:

E. SPARROW PURDY,

Captain and Assistant Adjutant-General.

General HARTSUFF,

Near Catlett's:

Duryea is three miles west of Alexandria. I give you what has just been received respecting his movement from General Wadsworth: "I hope to get one regiment through by morning." General McDowell directs you to move when two regiments of Duryea's shall have arrived. Prevent straggling if possible, as there are irregular rebels on the road ready to pick them up.

ED. SCHRIVER,

Chief of Staff.
