I also have the honor further to report that in obedience to an order by telegraph from the Secretary of War I adopt as instruction the inclosed letter from the Secretary to Colonel James Chesnut. By invitation of the Governor and Council I attended a consolation on the topics therein embraced. From information derived in that consultation and from other sources, and from my own observation, I conclude that if the four regiments therein named were accepted, and the conscription confined to the rest of the State, I could bring into the field within thirty days over 3,000 men; but that if these regiments are not accepted the entire force under the present order of conscription will not exceed 1,000. The extension of the order to the age of forty-five would bring, perhaps, 2,000. A large number of the persons under forty and forty-five now in these regiments as volunteers will be exempted under the act of Congress. Exemptions will be claimed under conscription which will be waived under volunteering. These four regiments, as they are, will bring 3,000 men into the field. Abstract those under forty and you will reduce them, perhaps, 500. Of these 500 a third or more will, perhaps, be entitled to exemption. I am proceeding with preparations to facilitate the enrollment by obtaining the rolls of the State and extracting the names between thirty-five and forty and forty and forty-five. On the 5th day of this month I will send the enrolling officers to their posts and hope to have every man in camp in twenty days, or on the 1st day of December at farthest. Having but a single company of sixty men at this post to do the entire guard duty over large Government stores, the prison, and the conscripts in camp, I shall be compelled to call on the general commanding for frequent aid in arresting the conscripts in the remote mountainous and the swamp regions of the State. All who are now remaining of the late enrollment are either in the gorges of the mountains or the impenetrable swamps of the lower country. I have the honor to inclose copies of my correspondence with the State authorities on a demand for assistance in the enrollment and arrests. It is proper to state that the authorities most earnestly and promptly tender all reasonable aid in the prosecution of the enrollment. While they yield their organizations from the impracticability of acceding to the propositions of the Secretary, they at once and to the full extent
