RICHMOND, March 9, 1865.

Lieutenant Colonel JOHN E. MULFORD, Assistant Agent of Exchange:

SIR: Colonel John H. Winston, Surg. W. [S.] Wright, Captain Samuel [L.] Winston, Captain Griffin Frost, and Captain William Perry are at Alton Prison, wearing ball and chain. All of these are Confederate officers and were acting under orders when captured. I have several times called your special attention to the cases of Colonel Winston and Doctor Wright without obtaining any response. Why are these officers thus kept in irons in violation of an agreement which has been so faithfully carried out on our part? Why are they not delivered to us in pursuance of that agreement? I hope at least I shall have an answer.

I have now before me a letter written by one of the prisoners at Alton, bearing date February 20, 1865, which states that-

there are confined and held under sentence of military commission and courts-martial at this place 250 soldiers and citizens of the Confederate States.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

RO. OULD,

Agent of Exchange.

RICHMOND, March 9, 1865.

Lieutenant Colonel JOHN E. MULFORD, Assistant Agent of Exchange:

SIR: I have learned that Messrs. Ramsey, Sperry, and Fox, citizens of Tennessee, are kept chained together and made to parade the streets
