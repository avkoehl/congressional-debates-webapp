CITY POINT, VA., June 21, 1864-1.30 p. m.

General INGALLS:

Two hundred sets of rail-twisters will go back by mail-boat this evening; 300 more to-morrow or next day. I have requested Ordnance Department to send bridge torpedoes. The only mode of blowing up a canal culvert or any masonry culvert is to barricade and tamp the culvert, putting sufficient powder in the center. As the quantity of powder needed is large and the time employed considerable, and as any railroad culvert can be bridged by a piece of timber, I do not think it will be worth while to undertake to blow up such culverts. Canal culverts, however, should, if possible, be blown up. Powder in barrels should be used with cannon fuse.

M. C. MEIGS,

Quartermaster-General.
