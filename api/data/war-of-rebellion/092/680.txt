Captain L. M. DAYTON,

Aide-de-Camp:

CAPTAIN: At this point my column found our road very badly obstructed and the enemy on opposite side with two small works. We drove him from the works, and have removed all obstructions, and I do not anticipate much difficulty between here and the railroad. We move at daylight. Davis is moving, but his road is a difficult one. I think I shall meet him near Cherokee Hill to-day.

Very respectfully, &amp;c.,

H. W. SLOCUM,

Major-General.

Major General J. C. DAVIS,

Commanding Fourteenth Corps:

The major-General commanding directs that you put your command in camp where you now are. He intends to develop the enemy's line with the Twentieth Corps this p. m., and as soon as we can find out something about the country here a position will be found for your corps. The Seventeenth Corps are well up on our right, and have been feeling of the enemy a little this forenoon. You had better send a staff officer toward to find a place to park your train near here.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. C. RODGERS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
