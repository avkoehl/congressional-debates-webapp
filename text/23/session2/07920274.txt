Alabama, 1 en lessee, Mississippi, &c , which be-
longed 10 tne llnited States, and which we should
then acq me The fi^st gieat ol jeet of the bill
wa  10 fulfil om obligatiors towards the Indians,
the next to redeem the faith we had pledged to
v aids the S ate of Georgia the thud to acqutie a
tei"ito y foi out selves m those States wherein the
Indian titles b-bnged exclusively to the Govern-
m nt of the Un ted States
The eieat question was, if the bi 1 vould effect
these objects First, with regaid to theCheiokees
in Georgia, it was a Leltel, well founded, that as
soon as the bill was passed, that tube would emi-
gra e, and one great end would be answeied, that
of disposing of thos  mtiicate aid embarrassing
questions, vI¿Kh had so long Leen asitated,not
only in the State of &eoi"ia, but also in other sec-
tions of the country     Mr  E  then enteied into a
review of tn° various sections of the bill senaUm
With regard to the nleged mdisposi ion of the In-
dians to e nigrate, Mr  E  sai J the committee had
satisfactory evidence befoie them that the tribes
were willing to do so, if then  territorial govern
nient could be e lsured     The committee had pro-
euied a translation of the bill, and submitted it to a
delegation in Washington, who expiessed them-
selves satisfied with   it      The object was 1 ot to
toice it upon the Indians, but to organize a plan,
and to provide an    ffi-er on the spot, who might
aid and assist m canying it into effect      Much
error  had  arisen   fiom   the   name   given to that
I ( fficc, from his being called Governor, instead of
! Superintendent, and it was thence imagined that
i it wa     he ol ject of the bill to foim an Indian
governmert    tint this was not so      The plan of
the council was tor the purpose of then forming a
confedeiation of the diffeient tnt es     Itvvas indis-
pensable that the presidios power should be some-
wheie,   it was   in   the   President  of the   United
States, who, as Com Hinder in Chief of ih  Aimy,
was lequned   to s°e the bill cairied   into effect,
which could only be ensured  by a military force,
and  the commander of that force would be ap-
pointed 111  the usual manner     Sufficient poweis
had   been   íeseived   to the United S ates, in the
provisions of the bill, between the different tribes
With legald  to a delegate, it was  absolutely
nece saiy that th  Indians should have one m that
House     What objection might be urged against
it he knew not, but if they were to examine the
sul ject minutely, the/ would find it exceedingly
difñeult to discovei   b) what authonty a delegate
from either of the Territories come theie      The
end of the committee had been to provide for every
thirg which could civilize the Indian tubes, and
no provision was thought moie conducive to that
end than the provisi >n authoi izmg a delegate to be
sent to Congiees     It would also be productive of
a great saving to the United States, and would
eventually do away with much of the expenses of
the Indian d partment
Mi   JOHííQ.  ADAMS legietted to see that
1 theie was an evident disposition on the part of the
House to piss this bill      It was a bill interfering
I with the laws of nations, and proposing the es-
j tabhshment of a despotism      Jt was a bill to liter
j the Cons ltu'ion of the United  States, and was
j contrai y to the second-section of that instrument
I lie asked tl e gentlcmai   who reported the bill,
, [Mi   Fvckett,)  to show him any artte'e of the
Constitution authoiizmg the establishment of an
Indian   leri'ory       This   land   wis  guarantied
I to the Indians, and what right  had  W£ to take
¡ upon ourselves to form  the Indians into an  inte-
¡ gial Dirt of Ihe United States'    Such an instance
■ was nevei known undei the Constit ttion      If you
! uid this, what could  prevent you   from  having a
negioterntoryinthe United States,and authorizing
it to send a delegate to C( ngressJ    W're gen le-
men preptieií foi   this'   lie believed not, but it
might come
,     It was also a bi'l to change the laws of nations
j The relations 1 1 whuh the United States existed
towaids the Indian , were relations un ¡ei the com-
mon compact of the law" of n itions     The Indians
j had retained  the | owei of self government     Vv e
had made "tieaties with them, and if we proposed
any such control over their   as that inttnded ly
the present bill, it could only be done by trcity
We were assuming more than we had a nsh' to,
m doing it by lejiis'ation, though he  vas not un-
I aware that an Indian treat/ was a mockery
It was a bill for the es a1 lishment of a despo-
tism It was in contra/ention of the laws of na-
I tions, and was therefoie despotic Under the
Constitution, every State must be republican, and
I the people were so punctilhous, that although
they reserved certain sovereign rights to the States,
they m°de it a fuidsment ' principle with them
ai!, that no government in th s Ui ion should be
established, other than republican If they did
so, the other States were bound to put it down
by foioe This bill was not republican at all, it
established a militaiy desDoti^n     To prote this
