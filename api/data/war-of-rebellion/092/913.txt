borough or down the Ogeechee. I estimate their infantry at about 30,000, or less, and their cavalry at from 3,000 to 3,500. They seem very apprehensive of meeting a large force in front, and are hurrying on as rapidly as possible.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. W. FERGUSON,

Brigadier-General.

AUGUSTA, November 30, 1864.

Major General SAMUEL JONES:

With the forces sent you must beat back the enemy and hold the Savannah railroad. Prompt and vigorous measures will accomplish it. Sherman, nevertheless, appears to be advancing very slowly, if at all, with his main force. Wheeler has beaten back his cavalry to the Ogeechee, west of Millen.

BRAXTON BRAGG.

AUGUSTA, November 30, 1864.

General SAMUEL JONES:

What is your information from the enemy in your district? Did my troops arrive in time for the action? We have opened communication again from here with Savannah. The enemy's infantry is advancing on this point, and our troops must return at the earliest possible moment.
