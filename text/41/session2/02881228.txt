THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
February 115
supplied themselves to a great degree from the
committee-rooms or elsewhere.
Now, no gentleman will suppose that I am
making a reflection on himself when I make this
statement. Bat I do assert, And I do not think
even my distinguished friend from Wisconsin
[Mr. Eldridoe} will gainsay it, that no mem-
ber of the House, were he to sit down, at the
commencement of the short aes3ion, and write
continuously during the whole of the three
months, could possibly consume the $125 worth
of stationery, to say nothing of reading the
newspapers provided for in the appropria-
tion.
Mr. MORRILL, of Maine. I move to amend
the amendment by striking out the one hundred
and forty-eighth, ooe hundred and forty-ninth,
and one hundred and fiftieth lines, and also
the word 4 'and" in the one hundred and fifty-
first line, and by Striking out'' ten'' and insert-
ing "five" in lieu thereof; so that the para-
graph will, read, " For stationery for commit-
tee, $5,000." .
Mr. Chairman, ai we hare repealed the
franking privilege, we. want very little paper,
und members are quite able to purchase their
owa, and when we purchase our own paper
we c&n, dispense with the stationery-room and
with the officers there and make a real saving
4 o t he Government. I insist that here is a good
opportunity, to show our hands, and I am cer-
tain that the economists of this House will be
ready to go heart and band for striking out this
appropriation entirely.
. Mr. DAWES. This appropriation is in pur-
suance of law. Unless it is made, and without
farther legislation in addition to striking it out,
members will take their newspapers and sta-
tionery precisely as before, and the appropria?
tion will go into,a deficiency bill next Congress.
It is necessary, in order to reach the desirable
object the gentleman from Maine has in view,
for him to introduce a bill to repeal the law
that entitle* each member to $125 worth of
stationery and newspapers.
Mr. MORRILL, or Maine* Allow me to
remark that we will do that [Laughter. ]
Mr. DAWES. Well, when the gentleman
from Maine gets Ms bHl through to repeal the
law allowing members newspapers and sta-
tionery, then this appropriation will be of no
avail, and nobody will get a dollar from it.
Bnt if he strikes out the appropriation and
leaves the law in force, then members will
continue to receive their newspapers and sta-
tion^iy, and the pay for them will go into a
deficiency bill the nextyear.
I wtoit to sky farther, that that law was
passed to correct an abuse which existed, if I
may say so without offense to my friends, at
the other end of the Gapitol, a very large
amount being received by members under the
head of newspapers and stationery. A statute
wm passed giving to each member at both
ends of the Capitol the same amount, and that
is $125 for his newspapers and stationery.
When gentleman from Maine introdnces
his bill to repeal that la** I will vote for it,
but so long as it stands upon the statute-book,
it is idle to undertake to stop this practice by
refusing the appropriation, for it will not touch
the matter. I hope we shall have a vote now.
Mr. WELKER. I move toamend theatnetid-
ment by striking out "five" and inserting
'/six/'
The CHAIRMAN. That is nofr in order.
Tbere ig an amendment to the amendment
already pending.
Mr. WELKER. Idid notunderstandthat.
Mr. MOBBILL, of Maine; I withdraw the
amendment to the amendment, so as to enable
the gentkman to offer an amendment.
Ww.i WELK6R. I renew the amendment
to the amendment. I desire to call the atten-
tion of the committee to the items under this'
clause. We appropriate $10yOOO for stationery
tor the committees' f the Honse. In that
matter I am very well satisfied-there har been
great abuse. I hold hi my hand a statement
of the amounts of stationery drawn by differ-
ent committees at the long session of the
Fortieth Congress, and I find that during that
session the amount drawn by the committees
was $4,489 02. The Committee on Accounts
of the present Congress have taken this matter
in hand, and have limited the various commit-
tees to sums of money which bring'down this
item to $2,165. I think the Committee on
Accounts is entitled to great credit for the
manner in which they have Stopped this little
leak in the Treasury.
I notice several curious things in the state-
ment of the amounts drawn by the comriiittees
during the long session of the Fortieth Con-
gress. I see that one committee of that Con-
gress drew out as stationery for the use of the
committee the amount of $482 54. I find that
another committee—Private Land Claims-^
only drew stationery to the amount of $29 94.
That was the lowest figure, and the sums drawn
varied from that amount to $432 54. The
$10,000 proposed to be appropriated by this
bill might lead to the same kind of abases in
this Congress.
There is another thing to which I desire to
call attention. On motion of the gentleman
from Massachusetts, [Mr. Dawes,] the words
"and officers" have been inserted in this para-
graph. I propose to notice a few little items
which show where and how this stationery has
been disposed of by some of these officers.
Mr. DAWES. I think I ought not to have
made that motion. I am perfectly willing that
those words shall be stricken out. • ■
Mr. WELKER. Wellj as the clause now
stands it authorizes an expettditiuro on station*
ery for the tise of the officers of the House.
They should receive1 an amount suffvei^ftt to
discharge their duties* • On lookingiato the let'
ter of the Clerk of the House, shbwing the
expenditures ofthe contingent fuwd of the
Fortieth Congress, I find that the Clerk has
charged his department, in schedule 0, con-
taining stationery furnished to tbe Clerk'8 office
during the long sessiofc, with stationery to the
amount of $8,025 38.. Among the items are
included thirty geld pens«Ofiting$166 66, some-
costing as high as $1815, and eighty-four pen-
knives oosting in all $247 78, and some cost-
ing as high as $9 69. I see also charged in
that account fifty-two porte-monnaies costing in
all $135 48, and sons costing as high as $9 75.
I find also fifty-seven packages of visiting cards
and forty-six pairs of shears, seventeen scrap*
books costing $24 85, twenty'seven autograph-
books costing $5145, nine portfolios costing
$46 66, and some costing as high as $10 83,
and several diaries to be nsed by these clerks.
It does not seem to me that so many: of these
articles are necessary to the discharge of their
duties. There is now no limit by law or order
of the House in this respect. It is time these
small abuses were stopped. Catting down this
appropriation I hope will have that effect.
[Here the hammer fell.]
Mr. DAWES. There • can be no mystery
about the amounts expended for the Several
committees for stationery." Any member of
the Honse can ascertain all about that matter
by going to the stationery-room of the Bouse.
I hold in my hand a statement of the various
amounts that have been allowed to committees,
and the amounts they have actually drawn
during the first session of this Congress, and
up to this time in the present session. If any
member desires to know just exactly what has
been paid, and what committee has had the
stationery, I will send the statement to the
Clerk's desk to be read.
Mr. WELKER. Let it be read.
• Mr. DAWES; I send the statement to th«
Clerk's desk, and ask that it be read for the
information of members. The figures in the
first column are the amounts of Stationery i
aljowed the respective committees by the Com- j
mittee on Accjpunts; the figures in the second:'

Mr. WELKER. I withdraw my amendment.
Mr. ARNELL. I renew it.
Mf; MAYNARD. Will the gentleman from
Ohio [Mr. Welker] inform us what, accord-
ing to his statement, were the contingent
expenses of the last Congress ?
Mr. WELKER. If the chairman of the
Committee on Appropriations [Mr. Dawes]
will consent, the statement can be read.
Mr. DAWES> I have no objection.
Mr. DAVIS. Let the aggregate be stated.
. Mr. WELKER. I have -already stated the
aggregate., My remarks do not relate to the
same kind of expenditures that the chairman
of the Committee on Appropriations has re-
ferred to.
.Mr. ARNELL. I desire to say in regard
to this matter, that in the first session of this
Congress, at a meeting of the Committee on
Accounts, it was determined to allow a certain
amount of stationery, not exceeding fifty dol-
lars in value, to each of the principal commit-
tees of the -House. I presume the statement
which has just been read from the Clerk's desk
at the request of the gentleman from Massa-
chusetts [Mr. Dawes] embraces the station-
ery for committees during the first session of
the present Congress and during the present
session up to this time.
Mr. DAWES. That is correct.
Mr. ARNELL. In this connection 1 desire
to say that I think the Amendment moved by
the gentleman from Ohio [Mr. Welker] is an
eminently proper one. The sutti of $5,000 is
amply sufficient to supply the different com-
mittees of this House with all the stationery
necessary for them for twelve months, or at
least for a long session of Congress. I trust,
therefore, his amendment will prevail.
Mr. DAWES. Let us have a vote on the
pending amendments.
The CHAIRMAN. The first question is
upon the amendment of the gentleman from
New York, [Mr. Davis.]
The amendment was to make the paragraph
read as follows:
For newspapers and stationery for members and
Delegates,, at fifty dollars each per annum, $12,500.
The question was taken; and upon a divis-
ion it was not agreed to—ayes twelve, noes
not cotintod. ■ < • ■/
