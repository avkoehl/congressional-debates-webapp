MARTINSBURG, June 19, 1864.

Brigadier-General KELLEY:

The commanding general directs that the Twenty-first New York Cavalry be sent to this place from Beverly without delay. They have not been able to go through to General Hunter.

T. A. MEYSENBURG,

C. A. FREEMAN,

Lieutenant and Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.

CITY POINT, VA., June 20, 1864.

Major-General MEADE,

Commanding, &amp;c.:

In view of the location of General Hunter, as reported in the rebel papers, and the fact that General Sheridan cannot carry supplies with him from the White House to make an effective raid against the enemy's communications north of the James, you may direct his immediate return to the Army of the Potomac. The manner of returning and route is left to you. Direct the commanding officer at White House to break up that post and send his Veteran Reserve troops back to Washington, bringing all the balance to City Point; this latter to take place on the departure of General Sheridan.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

I am, general, most respectfully, your obedient servant,
