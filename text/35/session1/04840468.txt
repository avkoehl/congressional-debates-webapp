Senate.
the earnings of freight and insurance. If he brings
that $40,000—and many of our imports are in
coin as well as ingoods—to New York, of course
he has sent $50,000 out and brings but $40,000
back, and he has lost $10,000. That must be
perfectly clear. The Senator, however, seems to
think not, but says he must bring back something
to pay the duty. Well, now, instead of bringing
back the $40,000 for which he sold the cotton in
Liverpool, suppose he lays out the money in
British goods at Manchester. If he has only got
|40,000 there to buy goods with, and ho carried
out §50,000, he has lost $10,000, and all the
earnings of freight and insurance. There can be
no mistake about that. Inasmuch as you take
the valuation at Liverpool, I take that test. He
sells the cotton for money and puts the money
into goods. If he brings back but $40,000 of
goods, he does a losing trade. I have shown you
it is not a losing trade, but the custom-house ex-
hibiting only $40,000 of import for that export of
$50,000, it necessarily follows either that there
was undervaluation, or that the trade must have
been a losing one. If the merchant laid out the
$50,000 in Liverpool in goods he would be even,
though he lost insurance and freight and profit;
but if he sold his cotton for $00,000, then whether
he put it in blankets or hats or cottons, or any-
thing else, the invoices must show $60,000
worth of goods exported from Liverpool to New
York.
I say, then, it is an unerring test, that unless
the imports do equal the exports, you have cither
done a losing trade, the commerce of the country
has lost, or the goods are undervalued, and there
is no escape from it. There were two elements
which I stated that might have an effect on the
calculation, and I called on the Senator from Vir-
ginia to name any others, if he could; but, after
forty-eight hours, he has not been able to give
another. I said it was subject to these modifica-
tions: first, the amount of goods that went abroad
to pay for interest on loans; and another element
to set off against that was the amount of money
borrowed in the three years to carry on our im-
provements. If as many new bonds were issued
as paid the interest on previous loans, that would
not appear in the statement of the account, but it
would be squared. There is no other element to
disturb the calculation, except.smuggling, and that
1 allowed for. 1 showed that.there were $70,000,000
against us, and I allowed $20,000,000 lor loss by
smuggling. It was a large estimate; I think an
excessive one. Then I showed that (be under-
valuation must amount to at least fifty million dol-
lars a year. Then, if you put the earnings of
freight, and insurance, and the profits of business
on an exportation of $,'100,000,000, at twenty per
cent., you would have $60,000,000, or an annua]
excess of exports over imports of $10,000,000
more, making $70,000,000; and if the profits, in-
surance, and l'reiglits were more than twenty per
cent, the amount would go up to eighty or per-
haps one hundred millions. The more profitable j
the trade, the greater the amount of undervalua- |'
Hon there must necessarily be. If cotton sold for |
one hundred per cent, advance; if the $50,000,000 j
exportation sold for $100,000,000, and the custom- j
house only showed $40,000,000 of imports in re-
turn, there was an undervaluation of $60,000,000;
and no figures, no logic of my friend from Vir-
ginia, can get around it. He has committed the
singular blunder of supposing that you may do a
good business, and yet bring in fewer goods m
value, buy less goods—and it will be the same,
whether you take goods or money, and I will take
the case of money. Suppose we export $100,000
in gold, and that we buy with it $90,000 in goods, :;
what becomes of the other $10,000? Much of j]
our export consists in gold—forty or lif'ty mil-;
lions. Suppose it had all been gold, and we sent1
to Liverpool from New Yoik $60,000,000, and ;!
brought in $40,000,000 of goods: then it would :j
be absolutely certain that we had lost precisely 'j
$20,000,000, unless there was a duty on gold in jj
Liverpool, for the gold did not lose anything in jj
going across the Atlantic ocean. Suppose our'
whole exportation of$300,000,000 had been in gold,
we should have received in return $300,000',000
in goods valued in Liverpool; and if it brought in
imports to a less amount than three hundred mil-
lion dollars, it is clear there was a loss in the
trade, and the Senator cannot account for it in any
other way on the best settled principles of political
economy. An old idea once obtained that a nation
which imported more than she exported was
getting in debt, and I believe some people who
write on these subjects in newspapers now have
that singular idea. I say, on the other hand, it
is an unfailing test of prosperity. If you bring in
no more than the avails of what you send out, if
it is $100,000,000, it shows $100,000,000 of pros-
perous trade, but if you go in debt beyond the
price of your commodities at the place you sell
them, that is another matter. But I say that the
basis which I went upon to show undervaluation
is correct. The element the Senator has put in
to-day does not exist, and he can find no other
than the one of smuggling, for which I have made
a liberal allowance.
On the other questions which have been raised,1
I agree with the principles laid down by my hon-
orable friend from Virginia. I was opposed to
the loan bill because it was opposed to my prin-
ciples; and I think it ought to have been opposed
to his. At the last session of Congress, when
the taiiff of 1857 was made, we estimated that,
upon the then importations, it would produce
but $48,000,000. We calculated to reduce taxes
$15,000,000. I voted for it because it did reduce
taxes to that extent. 1 intended, of course, as a
corollary to the raising of only $48,000,000, that
I would not spend more than forty-eight million
dollars, with what should be raised from lands and
miscellaneous sources, amounting in all to some
fifty-five million dollars. I am not willing to go
beyond this, except that I am ready to supply
any diminution of the revenue occasioned by ex-
traordinary causes. Such a diminution exists to
the extent of $7,000,000. Owing to the commer-
cial revulsion we have this year a revenue of
$41,000,000, instead of $48,000,000, which we
estimated when wc passed that lull. I say that
$7,000,000 is a legitimate subject for a loan. I
would also borrow for extraordinary expendi-
tures like the Utah war. We have appropriated
$9,000,000 for the Utah war, and borrowed the
money. There is $7,000,000 deficiency in the rev-
enue, and $9,000,000 for the Utah war to be pro-
vided, making $16,000,000; and the Government
has already had authority to borrow $20,000,000 !
by Treasury notes—$4,000,000 more than ought
to be wanted.
Mr. HUNTER. My friend is not to confine
the expenses of the Utah war to the deficiency
bill; because, after we have got the whole Army
concentrated into Utah valley wo have to supply
them; and the expenses of transporting and sub-
sisting them will be much greater than it would
be if they were differently posted. That causes
a great, portion of the expenses.
Mr, TOOMBS. My principle is that 1 will
provide for extraoidinary expenses, though I do
not, approve the policy, and for extraordinary
diminution of the revenue; but it has not been
shown, there is no exhibition of the honorable
Senator at the head of the Committee on Finance
of this body, that the extraordinary expenses and
deficiencies amount to $35,000,000; and that is
the only true basis of calculation for a loan. If
he had shown that the object of the $20,000,000
loan in the early part of the session, and the
$15,000,000 now, was to make up a deficiency of
the estimated levenue, and to provide for extraor-
dinary expenses, and had shown that$35,000,Q00
would bo needed for these purposes, then the loan
bills would be legitimate and proper; but, ill my
judgment, the chairman of the Committee on Fi-
nance lias not shown that there is any extraordi-
nary expenditures calling for this loan. I have
no idea that the extraordinary expenditures of
the Army, now that we have peace in Utah, will
go to £,15,000,000; or, if they should, I trust there
will be wisdom enough ill the executive depart-
ment of this Government to stop it, and turn the
Army back. Colonel Steptoe was there with a
portion of the Army two or three years ago, on
the old estimates. He was offered, by President
Pierce, the Governorship of that Territory, and
he very wisely declined it. We have had armies
there before. It may be expedient to keep some
addition to their number, out it will not do to
say that because there are increased expenditures
we must allow any amount of loan. What are
the increased expenditures? I have a right to
know them when I am called upon for a loan.
But, sir, I totally dissent from gentlemen on
this side of the House. I do not intend to bor-
row this money, and I mean to reduce the public
expenditures. I do not intend to falsify the pol-
icy which I adopted with my honorable friend
from Virginia fifteen months ago. I believe that
the present tariff levies taxes enough, and I do
not intend to vote for any more, or to pay any
more. I am pursuing my own policy, and I do
not intend to be diverted from it by anybody. It
is sound policy. I do not intend to spend more
than this tariff yields in ordinary circumstances,
but I would provide for extraordinary deficien-
cies or extraordinary disbursements. I will not
deviate from that principle until I am satisfied it
is wrong; and if it is wrong, the Senator from
Virginia ought not to have brought in aloan bill,
but a measure for increasing the revenue. If we
are not to bring down our expenditures to what
the tariff will yield under ordinary circumstances,
wc ought to raise taxation, because it is unwise
and unstatesmanlike to carry yourexpenditures to
$80,000,000 and leave your revenue at $50,000,000,
tor that policy will compel you to borrow the sum
of $30,000,000 a year. I will not do so great vio-
lence to all correct and sound principles of gov-
erning a great country as to do any such thing.
If your ordinary expenditures have gone beyond
your estimates for ordinary revenue, you ought
to raise your taxes. As I ao not intend to do it,
as I do not intend that the revenue shall go be-
yond it, I make my opposition on your appro-
priation bills, and will leave those gentlemen who
vote to carry the ordinary expenses up to eighty
or ninety million dollars to raise the money to
pay them. I will not do it. I think gentlemen
on the other side of the House who go for en-
larging the expenditures of the Government are
bound to provide for them by taxation orby loans;
but that is not their policy.
The amendment of my honorable friend from
Virginia is a wise one to this bill—not the wisest,
because an increase of taxation in some form
would be the wisest, but it is the next wisest. In-
asmuch as your estimates upon which you pred-
icated the $15,000,000 loan do not include this
amount of $G()0,000, of course it 13 but the dic-
tate of common sense and common honesty to
raise the money which you appropriate. The
revenue will not do it, according to anybody's
calculation. The existing loans will not do it.
The Administrationonly estimate what they mean
to spend, according to existing laws, and this is
not in their estimate. Then, when you appro-
priate these $600,000, or any other amount, for
these objects, statesmanship, patriotism,and duty
demand that ho who votes to expend the money,
ought, in some way, to provide it. The Secretary
of the Treasury cannotpay the money merely be-
cause you appropriate it; and I cast no censure oil
him. He finds the appropriations of the past year
seventy or eighty million dollars, and the revenue
only $41,000,000; and yet gentlemen turn round
and reproach him when he has asked loans to pay
your appropriations. You tell him to pay, out of
$50,000,000, the amountof $80,000,000. You ap-
propriate $80,000,000, and then turn round and
say, what a Secretary of the Treasury wc have
got; he comes to us for two loans in one Congress !
Yes, sir; and he will come for another one next
week, if you pnss some of the bills on the table,
that I reckon will get the vote of nearly every
gentleman here who is opposed to these loans.
They do not carry their opposition to appropria-
tions. I can name a pension bill that has been
started in the other House—perhaps it is here by
this time—amounting to $11,000,000; I can name
the French spoliation bill, involving $5,000,000;
I could name three or four other bills, which, if
you pass before the adjournment, it will be the
duty of the Secretary of the Treasury, as a states-
man and a patriot, to come to you next week for
a loan of $20,000,000 more.
Sir, the difficulty lies here in the legislative de-
partment. It is folly, it is unmanly, it is un-
statesmanlike to say you will carry the expendi-
ture to eighty or ninety or one hundred millions,
while you levy no more than fifty million dollars
by taxation, and then vote against loan bills. Gen-
tlemen can never bring down expenditures in that
