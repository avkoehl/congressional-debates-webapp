Numbers 7. Report of Major General Oliver O. Howard, U. S. Army, commanding Army of the Tennessee. HDQRS. DEPARTMENT AND ARMY OF THE TENNESSEE, Savannah, Ga., December 28, 1864.

CAPTAIN: The campaign of Savannah is so closely connected with the campaign into Alabama, just closed, and I have so carefully stated the strength of my army and left it concentrated at Atlanta, where it remained but one day, that I will not weary you with a repetition. General Sherman's Field Orders, Nos. 115 and 119, issued from Kingston, Ga.,* so remarkable for completeness and so explicit that they could not be misunderstood, have been faithfully adhered to. They were the means of initiating preparations fully adequate to the work that has been accomplished.

My command consisted of two army corps-the Fifteenth (Major General P. J. Osterhaus), of four divisions, as follows: First Division, Brigadier-General Woods: Second Division, Brigadier General W. B. Hazen; Third Division, Brigadier General John E. Smith; Fourth Division, Brigadier General J. M. Corse; the Seventeenth Army Corps, Major General F. P. Blair commanding, consisted of three divisions, as follows: First Division, Major General J. A. Mower; Third Division, Brigadier General M. D. Leggett; Fourth Division, Brigadier General Giles A. Smith-one regiment cavalry (First Alabama), one regiment of engineers (First Missouri), and a bridge train of sufficient capacity to throw two bridges across any stream that we found en route.
