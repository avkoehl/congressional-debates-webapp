ations now practicable in that quarter, larger than is necessary to defend the works from assault, and so large as to be exposed unnecessarily to the heavy batteries which the enemy may soon open upon us. Therefore, you may reduce that force to a command competent simply to hold the works against an attempted coup de main. This command you will please relieve at least once in forty-eight hours by fresh troops. The commanding general finds it necessary that General Clingman shall have a command on James Island; for example, the one he held when in the department before, to wit, the western lines on James Island, leaving General Hagood to command the eastern, with General Colquitt as second in command. This is not to interfere with an attack to-night, which will be carried out by General Hagood, as already arranged.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

THOMAS JORDAN,

Chief of Staff.

Brigadier General R. S. RIPLEY, Commanding 1st Mil. Dist., Charleston, S. C.:

GENERAL: The commanding general suggests that several hundred rice and other casks shall be furnished the troops on Morris Island for the construction of "rat-holes." It will be well, also, he thinks, to send to Savannah, Augusta, Wilmington, &amp; c., for at least 1,000 empty casks. A high lookout should be constructed at or about Fort Johnson, for the purpose of keeping a close watch on the enemy's movements from that point.

The commanding general further desires that hulks or other obstructions shall be sunk or established in the creeks west of Morris Island and north of Sullivan's Island, and that a good line of communication must be opened from the latter island to the city, via Christ Church Parish, and across Cooper River.

The commanding general further suggests that in the event of a protracted siege it may be very difficult to supply the batteries with ammunition, or even procure any from the arsenal; he therefore desires you to instruct your ordnance officers to make timely arrangements for an ample supply of ammunition for the possible wants of all the guns of different calibers in the First Military District.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

THOMAS JORDAN,

Chief of Staff.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,
