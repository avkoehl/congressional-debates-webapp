PROTECTION OF LABORERS, SEIZURES, AND PAYMENTS.

Under the provisions of general orders from department headquarters for the protection of plantation laborers, I have found it necessary, in certain instances, in order to secure payments of wages, to make seizures either of the produce or other property belonging to hirers, or of funds from merchants and others who had received produce without regard to the lien of the laborers, converting it to their own business account and interest. Thus far only twelve plantations have been reduced to the necessity of our resorting to this process of securing payments of freedmen working them.
