of the admiral, who he will compliment by present of the 9-inch piece of the Indianola and the pieces of the Harriet Lane, recaptured. The quartermaster has no paint, however, and we shall not be able to repeat the inscriptions of Haynes' Bluff.

My command is in occupation of the fort, and will be engaged to-day and to-morrow in the demolition of the casemates, bridges, &amp;c., and finally the following up of the magazine. The main body, under the command of General Mower, convoyed by Admiral Porter, sailed last night for Alexandria, where I expect to join them in three days. General A. J. Smith remains with me; also the gun-boat Benton, Captain Greer. My command is in excellent health and fine spirits; deserve compliment for their steadiness, discipline, and marching qualities. Dispatch-boat waits my orders. I write hurriedly, or rather dictate from horseback. Shall hope to send you good account of my stewardship.

I meanwhile have the honor to be, with highest respect, your obedient servant and friend,

THOS. KILBY SMITH,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

Major General J. B. McPHERSON,

Commanding Seventeenth Army Corps, Vicksburg.

P. S.- I send Colonel Nale with prisoners and dispatches to Baton Rouge. Opportunity permitting, he will make written reports, filling them on his return.

Haste,

T. K. S.
