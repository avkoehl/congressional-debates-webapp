Colonel KENNETT,

Commanding Cavalry Division, Hartsville, Tenn.:

COLONEL: Leaving one regiment of cavalry at Hartsville, with direction to report to Major-General Thomas, you will then, with the remainder of your force, take up the line of march for this city, and report at these headquarters. Use your own discretion as to route you will follow. Not being acquainted with the condition of your command, the general is unwilling to give you positive orders, but if, without undue risk, you could cross the Cumberland near to where you are now encamped, and come round by the way of Lebanon, he would be pleased to have you do so.

I am, colonel, yours, very respectfully,

Assistant Adjutant-General and Chief of Staff.
