No. 2. Report of Brigadier General Braxton Bragg, C. S. Army.
HEADQUARTERS TROOPS OF THE CONFEDERATE STATES, Near Pensacola, Fla., September 16, 1861.

SIR: I have the honor to report, for the information of the Department, that a row-boat, with nine enlisted men of marines, sent on patrol duty on the night of the 8th instant in the harbor, failed to return. The crew has no doubt deserted to the enemy. It was a gross neglect on the part of the officer in charge of this service in not sending an officer in command on such a duty.

On the night of the 13th a boat expedition of three ships' launches, heavily armed, made an attack on a point at the navy-yard where the boats of our harbor police were moored, and succeeded in setting fire to and destroying a small armed vessel in our service. Our guards were not surprised, but by some strange neglect, which is now under investigation, permitted the success of this daring exploit, led, no doubt, by our deserters. I hope to fix the responsibility and make an example of the guilty parties.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,BRAXTON BRAGG,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
