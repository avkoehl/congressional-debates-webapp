THE OFFICIAL PROCEEDINGS OF CONGRESS, PUBLISHED BY JOHN C. RIVES, WASHINGTON, D. C.
33d Congress, 2d Session.
THURSDAY, MARCH 1, 1855.
New Series....No. 66.
Mr. HUNTER. I think the Senator said yes-
terday, when he made his first remarks upon this
bill, that,as a separate and independent measure,
he would not object to the proposition. I think
I heard him say so. Now, if, as a separate and
independent measure, it was so nearly right as
that, how in the world would he be justified in
wishing to see the civil and diplomatic appropri-
ation bill fail because of its connection with it ?
What would be the result of the failure of that
bill at this time ? What would be the effect of an
extra session which would, of necessity, have to
be called in the spring, at a time when a number
of the southern States would not have filled their
delegation; when we should have a Congress com-
posed almost entirely of representatives from par-
ticular sections ? What would be the effect upon
business, upon trade, upon the prosperity, aye,
sir, and upon the peace of the country ?
Mr. President, 1 acknowledge that the House of
Representatives have not dealt by the Senate as
they should have done, in sending up these appro-
priations at the proper time. But, although we
cannot apply the remedy now, we may at another
session. The remedy consists not in defeating one
of the appropriation bills, and forcing the Execu-
tive to call an extra session under such circum-
stances, but the remedy would be in originating
such measures in the Senate hereafter, and taking
them up in time to consider and discuss them. I
do think that hereafter we ought to do that, and if
■we do, we shall have found an effectual remedy
against this mischief which seems to alarm gen-
tlemen so much. It is to be remembered, in re-
gard to this precedent, that it is a precedent that
has been set, not by the Senate, but by the House
of Representatives. We do not unite these in-
congruous subjects. They come to us in a bill
from that House; and it will not be for them to
quote their own precedents in order to practice
wrong on us hereafter.
I believe, sir, under the circumstances, the
■wisest and best thing we could do would be to
pass this measure. I do not believe—I should
regret to think—that it would carry a pang to the
bosom of any man in Pennsylvania, or injure a
single individual, as the Senator from that State
seems to suppose. 1 do not believe it would in-
jure any of his constituents; on the contrary, I
have no sort of doubt but that it would prove to
be a beneficial measure to that great State. I know
the alarm and apprehension which she felt in 184G,
for I was here at the time. Can she say that she
has been injured by the tariff of that year? Has
she not arisen strengthened and refreshed by its
influence and operation ? I believe the same result
will follow if this measure passes. Her iron in-
terest will enjoy the highest measure of protection.
It stands along side of sugar and manufactures of
wool, and all those articles which are most pro-
tected. What more can she ask ? Is she not
willing to " share and share alike" with her sister
States, and with their interests? Is she not con-
tent if she is placed along side of those who have
the most? Does she desire to get more than an
equal share? Surely she would not be justified,
from the prospect of the passage of such a measure
as this, in defeating the appropriation bill. How
did this measure pass? Is it a sectional measure?
Was it passed by any one party over another? I
hold in my hand an analysis of the vote. I have
not time to go over it and give the number of
votes from each State, but it will be found, I be-
lieve, that it embraced a large majority of the free
States of the Northwest; it will be found that it was
advocated by many from New England; it will be
found that it received votes from every section of
the Union, from the Representatives of every in-
terest in the community.
Mr. JAMES. I would suggest to the honorable
Senator, as he is quoting the different States which
supported this bill, that many members, I have no
doubt, voted for it with the understanding that it
would be amended in this body. Otherwise they
would not have voted for it.
Mr. HUNTER. I do not know how that was.
I am not prepared to say. But, sir, I find that
66
Pennsylvania contributed seven votes in favor of
the bill; and so it will be found that all the States
of this Union have given votes to its passage. It
is an equal and a just measure. It is no new thing.
It is a modification of the old law, which is well
understood by everybody who has ever paid atten-
tion to the subject. It raises the duties upon
nothing. Silks, which have been heretofore re-
garded as the subject of a sumptuary list, are
diminished but one per cent. The manufactures
of flax, like those of silk, as yet constitute but a
small interest in this country; they paid but twenty
per cent, under the tariff of 1846, and would pay
the same under this. Blankets would pay us,
under this, but twenty per cent.—this being still a
lower rate of duty than that imposed upon most
other manufactures of wool. For the rest, the
twenty per cent, reduction may be said to fall
upon nearly all important articles. The duties
upon iron, sugar, manufactures of wool and of
cotton, are all reduced one fifth. Some dye-stuffs
are, it is true, greatly reduced, or put on the free
list; but it will be seen, from the table which I hold
in my hand, that the entire amount of duties lost
by this reduction is comparatively small. Upon
wool, as a raw material, the reduction is much
larger; but it would not be. difficult to show that
the wool-grower here, as was proved lately in
England, would derive more benefit from the in-
creased activity of woolen manufacturing at home
than from the exclusion of foreign competition by
high duties upon raw material. In every mate-
rial point of view, then, this measure is to be com-
mended as wise and good.
Why, then, this angry denunciation, and what
are the provisions which would justify the defeat of
the general appropriation bill. The table which I
hold in my hand will show that the modifications
which it makes in the tariff of 1846 are simple and
few. But upon this topic 1 will forbear to enlarge.
The following are the documents that were
referred to:
Revenue on substitute proposed, based upon the Importations o/1853
Articles transferred from one class to another, and
which prove exceptions to the uniform reduction of
