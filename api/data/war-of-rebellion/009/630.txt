can send against this Territory. We have now in the service of the Government and under fair discipline something more than 4,000 volunteers and militia of this Territory; also, say, 1,500 regular troops. With this force and what I could call into the field of the organized militia in a few days' notice I am sure we can repel any force that will be sent against this Territory.

We are in great want of arms and ammunition, and hope that by the early spring trains our requisition will be filled.

The Navajo and Apache Indians still continue their depredations to an alarming extent, altogether in robberies. Few deaths occur, but a continual spoliation of property. The losses of the Territory the past year will not fall short of half a million of dollars. The Texan keep us in such continual uneasiness that we can make no effective campaign against those hostile tribes.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

HENRY CONNELLY,

Governor of New Mexico.
