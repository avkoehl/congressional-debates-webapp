OFFICE ASST. AGENT FOR EXCHANGE OF PRISONERS,

FLAG-OF-TRUCE STEAMER NEW YORK,

November 29, 1864.

Major-General BUTLER, Commissioner for Exchange, &c.:

GENERAL: I have the honor to inform you that to the present time we have received about 4,600 prisoners from the enemy. They have, however, been unable to get a prisoner into Savannah since last Friday.

Yesterday Captain Hatch came down and informed me that 1,000 were on the way from Florence, and exhibited a telegram to that effect. They should have arrived in Savannah last night; but we have had no communication with Savannah to-day, and I am inclined to think the Charleston and Savannah Railroad has been cut by General Foster's command. I shall hear to-day, and if possible will inform you by this mail.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JNO E. MULFORD,

Lieutenant-Colonel and U. S. Assistant Agent for Exchange.
