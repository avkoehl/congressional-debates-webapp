HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS, August 15, 1864.

General GREGG,Commanding Second Division Cavalry:

GENERAL: I wish you would be careful that the enemy do not deceive you with dismounted cavalry. If that brigade gets to the Charles City road I wish you would press forward so as to relieve them, as I wish General Birney to make an attack as soon as he can find a hole in their lines. I therefore desire that you should press the enemy well back on the Charles City road, looking our well at the same time for your right. I have since received your dispatch stating that your dismounted cavalry have the Charles City road.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General, Commanding.
