CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
The import  for the corresponding quarter of last year were
twenty two millions, to the best of his recollection deducting
the falling off atthe rate of ten per cent the reduction will be
over two millions [Mr Calhoun asked what was the amount
of free goods? Mr Evans replied that he understood it was
$3,800,000 3 The imports in some cases had fallen off fifty per
cent —m others less, and it may be concluded that the impoit
lag merchants will not, during the current and succeeding
quarters, do any thing like the game amount of busi
ness they have been doing for the first quarter, so
that a much larger reduction of revenue irom cus
toms than ten per cent may be expected There
may be a counteracting cause, which he would mention It is
well known that this stagnation of mercantile business is some
what ««usual, andpievails, perhaps, more extensively mother
countries than mthw. Indeed amid the univeisal suspension of
commercial enterprise, he believed it was not saying too much
to assert that this country jwas suffering comparatively less
than any Other with which it had commercial intercourse The
reeultof this would be that other countries, not being able to
import as much as usual, a greatei quantity of imports would
be thrown into this country than might otherwise be induced,
and to that extent the falling off vould be counteracted He
thought, that on the whole the reduction of impoits for thn
year might be fairíy es imated at 10 per cept He had no idea
that this deficit ought to be provided for by a, new loan, on the
contrary, he was decidedly of opinion that all deficiencies of
means to meet the wants of the Government ought to be met by
an adequate revenue But if Congress wilt not lay on a
sufficient tariff to provide adequate means, the deficit would un
doubtedly be increased by the falling off in imports, and what-
ever deficit should arise must be met by loans if not by reve
mie The Secretary of the Treasury, atthe beginning of the
year, estimated the deficit of the yeai at seven million"! if to
that the two millions oeadded lor falling off in the imports, the
deficit will be nine millions Congress, howevei, contemplated
a reduction on the estimates of t,voand a half millions, winch
would leave a deficit of six and a half millions Now, it Con
gress will neglect to provide an adequate revenue for the Go-
vernment, the greater part of this deficit will have to be met by
a reissue oí Treasury notes, so that the indebtedness of the Go
vernment at the end of the year will be twenty one millions
Oa the other hand, should adequate revenue be provided, the
whole idebt wiU.be but seventeen millions [Mr Bcghanan
asked ii he understood the Senator from Mame to say that if
Congress did not piovide additional means, the debt at the end
of the year would ¿etwenty one millions'*] Mr EvAt^s replied
that he did He would recapitulate what he had said In the
first place the Secretary of the Treasury estimated the deficit
atsevenanda quarter millions Adr* to it the twe millions of
deficit from duties cause J by the falling off in imports, making
nine and a quarter millions, from which take five millions pio
vided for by Treasury notes, leaving four and a quarter millions
to be added to the indebtedness of th" loan bill, that is the
twelve million loan bill, and this five million loan bii!, making
twenty one and a quarter millions, in the aggregate The ex
pected saving from the curtailing of the estimates would be
counteracted by the leductionon dutie 
Here Mr Eva>.s went into a general íeview of the condition
of the Treasuiy and the circumstances under which the Irea
auiy notes had become depressed He estimated the wants of
the Government fot the current qaarter at eleven an I three
tenths milhonsjthree of which would be íequited fortheied mp-
tion of Treasury notes, and the rest for ordinary expenditures
If, however, the general appropriation bills should be kept back
by Congress, the demands on the Treasury would not beso gieat
for the^ethree month" That would be only a postponement, for
the amount would have to be met in the next quarter If the
> appropriation bills are not delayed by Congress the Treasury
will want eleven millions and three tenth* t« meet its engige
menta Its means f >r the quartei are &6 319 Out) le iving i t!L
licit of fmr millions and thiee fourths In this defici'aiein
elude! Treasury notes to be met, amounting to thiee millions,
so that the deficit of ordinary means to meet ouhnary expenses
for the quarter, is one million and tti ee quarters But the
Treasury notes cannot be laid out of the question, fort'iey
have to be redeemed, or th y v. 11 be forct ] baccuvon he

it is not merely the Treasury notes due vv thin this >ea that

It is not only indispensable that Congress sioulrt ittio>i?e
a loan sufficient to  meet the engage Ttenu. of the Governmen ,
b at that it should be done m <3uch a manner as to  enable tl e
Secretary of the Treasury to make toe authority availab
That, in the present condition of things, can be fone in no
other way hit that of allowing him to ok>u n the money oi the
besttermehe can under  all the  encumbrances    Hue Mr
Evans entei«d into a long argument to show the necessity of
thecase, and referred to (he action of the Government m si
miiar cncumstancei on former occasions     He referred  to one
instance m which eight per cent {interest had been authorized
by Congress to obtain a loan, and   another in which Tiea
bury note3   were funded at seven  per c^nt   interest   aWo to
tome instances in which Givemment stock had been authn

the lea&t pjis&ioie del iy on tiie i art of Í ongies^ to ¡slippy th*
Treasury and to placa the finai e al affair* uf the Oo\einmert
upon a sound and stable footing, yet the honorable chairma
ot the Comnuuee on Finance must pardon bim if he asserted d'
the outset, that he could not feel upon this occasion, and with
all these great interests surrounding and piessmg upon him,
that the necessities of the country, growing out of i state of
wai, should be any precedent for their guidance upon tris oc
casion And agam, though he appreciated the appeal which
had been made to them by the honorable chairman of the Fi
nance Committee, as to the necessity for speedy action upon
the bill, he must be pardoned for «aying, that while the lionora
ble Senator was compelled to stand up and make that appeal
on behalfof the Treasury telling them, while he did so. that it
was perfecting their measures to give away one eighth cf the
whole revenue of thecountiy his appeal, we! as that appeal
had bem made in manner and in feeing lo t moie than half
its force by virtue ol that declaration They coitld not close
then eyes to the condition in which party mo% emen s—and he
would say nothing of the motives oi puipcses by which thty
were actuated—placed the agents of paity, as was tie ca5e in
this instance with the honorable Senator, the chanman m the
Tinance Committee, when, after having taken one en ne
source of their revenue and wienched it ou* of the \a
tional Tieasury, as had been represented by the i onorable
chauman himself, he found him elf compeled to come for*
ward and appeal to the Senate m the most moving teimsto
make good the deficiency thereby cheated in the Treasury
Th s was the only view that the"< oulduke of the maitei ind
feeling thus, while they were willing (o accord to honotatle
Sena orson the of her side all due credit for sincerity of pi rpo«e*
in the policy they had pursued, it would be exceeding y un
kind m them to charge u1* with inteni.onal deiay, with mten

them, before you prostrate oui poud credit in the dust tike

to that body for legis'ative action might be clearly undei^ood
And first, as to the time limited for the redempt on of the loan

making 817 000,000 mall There was in the arguments of the
