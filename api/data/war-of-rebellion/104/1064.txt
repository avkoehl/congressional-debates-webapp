Responsible person was sent at the time. He further telegraphs that a more desirable state of affairs could not prevail than now obtains over all of Georgia west and south of the Ogeechee and Altamaha. All that is needed to protect the interest of the Government is an ample force for the Treasury Department and proper representatives of the Feedmen's Bureau.

Bvt. Major General J. H. WILSON,

Macon, Ga.:

General Grant telegraphs me that you need not send any more cavalry to South Carolina than Gillmore needs. I will send you Croxton and Minty, and La Grange, if he is continued in the service. Have you any officers for your negro regiments, or how many more do you want? After my telegram to you of the 1st of July I received G. W. Smith's application for the amnesty, which was favorably indorsed by me and forwarded. I see no objection to his resuming Etowah Iron-Works, unless the Treasury Department has libeled them. He must, however, arrange that with the agent of the Treasury Department. I am inclined to think that the President permitted J. E. Brown to resign as Governor, but you did right to forward his resignation and address to the people to General Steedman, to be referred to the Executive.
