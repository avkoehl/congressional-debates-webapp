CITY POINT, July 29, 1864 - 4.20 p. m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

In the opinion of the engineers another bridge south of the creek in impracticable because of the steepness of the bluff and the narrowness of the roadway along the bank of the creek. If it were, we have not the material to construct it. Shall send down to Deep Bottom, and if possible to do anything to aid crossing it shall be done. Lieutenant Michie has gone for the purpose. Shall Birge's brigade, of the Nineteenth Corps, leave Bermuda Hundred with Hancock, or shall it [remain] at Deep Bottom on this side the James to aid Foster or repel an attempt to cross?

BENJ. F. BUTLER,

Major-General, Commanding.
