THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
April 4,
a high price, to the injury of the new States. This
bill, obviates that objection. It provides for the
distribution of no lands directly to the old States,
but that the States shall be entitled to receive and
to dispose of land warrants (not leiis than eighty
nor more than one hundred and sixty acres each)
to the amount in all granted to each State. These
warrants will be sold to actual settlers going into
the new States, and that the old States shall have
the benefit of the sale of these warrants; but no
State is to locate any warrants in its own name,
or for its own benefit. Instead of the General Gov-
ernment, as now, selling the lands to this amount,
and receiving the avails into the public Treasury,
(after deducting the expense of sales, &c.,) each
of the old States is to be allowed to sell an amount
of land warrants equal to the amount granted to
that State, and retain the proceeds for the benefit
of the State for school purposes, or purposes sim-
ilar to those for which the lands are granted to the
land States.
The land warrant system is in practical opera-
tion now; and as it exists, is adopted by this bill.
It takes up the system as we find it, and through
that system avails itself of the opportunity of
making an equivalent to the old States, without
prejudice to the land States, in any way, for the
large grants made to them. We desire a settle-
ment among the States of the land account before
this system goes further. Many gentlemen do not
understand the large amount of grants' that have
been made to a few States. I have said that I
admitted the power of Congress to dispose of the
public lands. If Congress has not that power,
there is no Department of the Government which
has. The exclusive and entire right to dispose of
these lands is conferred, by the Constitution, as
clearly as any other power which Congress may
exercise. This power has been exercised by
Congress. Ever since the days of Jefferson down
to the present time, the public lands have been
granted for almost every conceivable purpose; but
, they have been granted for the benefit of the land
States alone, and not for the benefit of all the
States. I have a report before me giving the
amount granted to apart of theStates, as follows:
Congress lias not only made theso grants often, hut to
large amounts. The aiuouul ot land granted away by Con-
gress exceeds the amount ihat has been sold.
An official statement from the Commissioner of Public
Tjftmte shows that there has been granted to tin* States and

Thes.e grants (except for military services) are for the
benefit of only .a part of the States, and the old States have
been wholly excluded.
The swamp lands granted to California are many mil-
lions of acres, but have not been renimed, and are not
included above.
Had ihe land granted to the land States and the Terri-
tories—123,062,451 acres—been sold at Government price,
it would have amounted to $153,848,054. The share of
New York in this, according torepiesentauon, would have
been $21,693,824.
Sir, there haa been appropriated to the land
States and Territories, for all purposes, about
twenty million acres more land than have been
sold up to June 30, 1853, exclusive of grants for
military service of some twenty-four million acres.
Is it reasonable, or is it just or proper, if this
system is to be pursued, that the lands should go
exclusively for the benefit of the land States? is
it right, when we have granted nearly fifty mil-
lion acres of land for school purposes to the land
States and Territories, that we should not grant
any lands for school purposes to the old States?
If all the lands granted away had been sold, and the
proceeds divided among all theStates, the share be-
longing to New York, according to representation,
would have amounted to more than $20,000,000—
enough to pay our whole State debt for internal
improvements.
But, sir, that is passed; these grants have been
made; and the question now is, shall we allow the
land States to appropriate all the lands which yet
remain—lands which were purchased by the com-
mon property of the country? I take occasion
here to say that I care not what reports may
have been presented upon the subject, I do not
believe it can be demonstrated that the public
lands have been a source of revenue to the Gov-
ernment. We have paid millions and hundreds
of millions of dollars for these lands more than
has been received from the sales, if all that is
justly chargeable to the lands is placed in the ac-
count, and charged ag.iinst them.
By the report of the Commissioner of the Gen-
eral Land Office, I see that we have paid the In-
dians $35,000,000 for land purchased of them. As
long ago as 1839, in reply to a resolution of some
Senator, I think Mr. Corvvin, there was an official
report made to the Senate, by which it appeared
that over $85,000,000 had been paid to the Indians
for lands, up to that time. Purchases and pay-
ments have been made ever since; and now it is
stated at $35,000,000. How does this happen ?
I3y what process was it reduced, instead of in-
creasing? We have been making new purchases
ever since 183f), and paying annuities, some of
which cease only with the existence of the Indian
tribes to whom they are paid. We havealsogiven
money,goods, and other lands, in exchange. We
have since been repeatedly making appropriations
for gifts, and presents, and expenses of commis-
sioners to make new treaties with the Indians, and
pmchase lands of them. There is scarcely an In-
dian appropriation bill pusses that does not contain
forty, fifty, or a hundred thousand dollars for
these or similar purposes.
But, sir, I will not now pursue this train of ar-
gument further; I have not the proper documents
before me. I repeat, that if all that is justly charge-
able to the public lands were placed in the account,
I do not believe they have ever been a source of
revenue to the Government; I do not believe they
ever will be. I am m favor of grants of the public
land for railroad purposes, if made equally for
the benefit of all the States. I am not opposing
the policy; but, in making the grants, I want the
old States treated fairly. The public lands are
the common property of all the States; the old
States should not be excluded. But we are asked
to vote for those railroad grants, when it is pro-
claimed that they are to be made for the benefit
of the land States alone.
It is contended that the old States have no right
to complain, because, as it is said, they lose nothing
by these railroad grants. And it is urged that
the price of the alternate sections of land is
doubled, and_ that all the land granted is thus
paid for. This argument has been pressed beyond
all kind of reason, it was a very ingenious mode
of getting the land; but it has never been true to
anything like the extent claimed. To sh ow this,
I have only to refer to the Illinois Central rail-
road.
Take, for example, the Illinois Central railroad, as most
favorable for those lelying upon this argument. The grants
for that road wei e as follows:
To Illinois      2,595,053 acres.
To Mississippi  737,130 acres.
To Alabama  419,528 "
Amount granted to that road  3.75),711
Reserved to be offered at double price:
In Illinois  1,223,921 acres.
In Mississippi  288,495 "
In Alabama  167,045 "
Amount to be offered at double price... 1,051,874 "
The land granted to the road, 3,751,711 acres, amounts
at Government price, to $4,689,639.
If all the reserved sections could be sold at double price,
it still leaves a clear gift to this road of $-2,624,897. But
the act only reserved these sections, and required them tft
be offered at the increabed price before they were sold at the
ordinary rate.
They were brought into market in July, 1852 and up to
September, 30, ]8i3, (one year and three months,) there
had been sold in Illinois, at the double price, only 284,080
aci es, and the amount over the ordinary price received was
§35>,!00, (and from this all additional expenses should be
deducted,) to repay Government for the grant or gift of land,
to the amount of $4,689,639—not one thirteenth pait as
much. It isdoubtful whether any raihoad grant, madeor to
be made, under this admirable " lose-nothing*' system, (for
it has come to be a system,) will repay to Government, in-
cluding all additional expenses, one dollar in ten of the
value of the land given to the road.
That road had nearly four million acres of the
public land granted to it. It passed through the
States of Illinois, Mississippi, and Alabama. Its
selections of land were made within a range of
fifteen miles on each side of the road, and the
doubled sections only extended six miles on each
side, and that has been the precedent and pattern
for all the grants made since. The alternate
sections, to the amount of one million six hun-
dred thousand and odd acres were doubled in
price. If every acre of that land were sold at
double price, there would be still a clear gift of
over $2,500,000 to the road.
But it was further alleged that the alternate sec-
tions would be sold as soon as they were brought
into market, at the double price. The alternate
sections of the public land along the central Illinois
railroad, were brought into market in July, 1852,
and up to the 30th June, 1853, when they had
been in market one year, only about two hundred
and eighty thousand acres were sold within the
limits of Illinois. The land in the other States
was but trifling in amount. The argument that
the Government would not be a loser by the
grants is not true fact, and never has been. If all
the extra expense of a public sale and of putting
the land into market at the double price, were
taken into account, I do not believe that the pro-
ceeds of the alternate sections would pay one tenth
part of the value of the land granted to the road.
The idea of doubling the price of the public land
does not amount to much in fact, so far as the
States can show. And the theory of doubling the
price of the public land is wrong, in my judg-
ment; I do not think that we ought to double the
price of the public land, but to make the grants
independent of that consideration. Let those who
emigrate to the West have the best of the land to
settle on, if they make the first settlements and
locations.
We should not forget, too, that in doubling the
price of the public land, we only tax the actual
settlers to build the roads for the benefit of com-
panies and corporations. The land given to the
railroad is, by this system, also increased in price.
Thecompany will hold it for atime,and then putit
into the market at an exceedingly advanced price.
I could not vote for grants of the public land for
railroad purposes upon the theory that they pay
for themselves. I do not believe it. I deny it alto-
gether.
It is also said that the grants increase sales, and
thereby benefit the United States, just as if that
were a matter of great importance, whether the
sales were made more or less rapidly. We are
now selling our public land as fast as emigration
demands; and it is certainly wrong to stimulate
settlement to an undue and unnatural extent.
But look at the table of sales, and while the
system of railroad grants has been in full opera-
tion, and yau will.fmd that the sales have not in-
creased.* In 1852 the sales were not as great
as they had been for either of the twelve years
* There was more land sold in 1838 than has been sold
for the la>t twelve years up to January, 1853, (the returns
for 1853 are not yet all made.) Yet this railroad system
(that is said so rapidly to inrrpuse the sales) had been
in lull opeiation for two or three of the last years. The
lowest sales in any one year were in 1852, (less than one
