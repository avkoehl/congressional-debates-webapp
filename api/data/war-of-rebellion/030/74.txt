NASHVILLE, November 19, 1862.

Major General HORATIO G. WRIGHT:

I must ask you to please provide immediately for the protection of Bowling Green. I need absolutely, and at once, General Granger's brigade here. Answer by telegraph.

Major-General U. S. Vols., Comdg. Dept. of the Cumberland.

Major General W. S. ROSECRANS,

Nashville, Tenn.:

I had supposed Granger's brigade was to be left at Bowling Green, and have made my arrangements accordingly. Must you have him?

I send you five regiments of East Tennesseeans, old troops, and two others, incomplete. Won't they answer your necessities without Granger? If not, I must send troops from Lexington to relieve him, and it will require some time. Shall await your answer. What is the least force that will suffice for Bowling Green?

H. G. WRIGHT,

Major-General, Commanding.

Major General W. S. ROSECRANS,

Nashville, Tenn.:

Bruce has been ordered. I hope rebels will fight in Tennessee, but doubt it, unless it be in eastern part. With your forces in front, it seems to me, and the present force at Bowling Green and Columbus, a regiment of cavalry about Jamestown and another about Burkesville is sufficient to cover that part of the country. This disposition, with Bruce at Hopkinsville, a force of Granger's command at Somerset and Big Hill, a larger one at Crab Orchard, with the rest in reserve at points in rear, seems to me all that is advisable till you make your move or till depots are established on the Cumberland. It will be next to impossible to maintain a force of any great strength on the Cumberland this winter until it can be supplied by water. The roads will soon become impassable, and the country will supply little. This disposition will enable me to concentrate against any raid, through Cumberland Gap or gaps to the westward, designed to reach the blue-grass region. Short of that the enemy will not stop in force, as he cannot subsist. Morgan's division has been withdrawn from the Kanawha, and the Tennessee regiments sent to you; the remainder down the Mississippi. No more can be withdrawn at present. Nothing new in this section or eastward.

H. G. WRIGHT,

Major-General, Commanding.
