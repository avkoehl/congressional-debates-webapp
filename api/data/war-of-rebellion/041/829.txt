QUARTERMASTER GENERAL'S OFFICE,

Washington, D. C., December 1, 1863.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War, Washington, D. C.:

SIR: I have the honor to return herewith the letter of the Honorable S. Hooper, of Boston, dated the 24th instant [ultimo], in relation to providing one or two steam tugs for the use of General Banks, in Texas, referred to me yesterday, and have to report that, immediately upon the receipt of General Banks' letter* at this office, a copy of which was submitted to you, a very superior and fast new tug, coppered, called the Perry, was purchased, fitted out in Philadelphia, and dispatched to New Orleans for service on the coast of Texas. She sailed on Monday, the 30th ultimo.

From the lists on file in this office, another suitable tug, the James Murray, has been selected, and will be dispatched forthwith from Fort Monroe. She will be ready this week.

To guard against accidents on the coast of Texas, and replace the tug I. W. Hancox, lost on the expedition, I have selected a third one, the Ajax, of 83 tons, which can be ready by Monday next.

In selecting these tugs, I have endeavored to be careful in procuring vessels suitable for the trying service they will be called upon to perform on that hazardous coast, and I trust I have succeeded in doing so.

From the foregoing, it will be seen that the tugs named by the Honorable Mr. Hooper are not needed unless more than three are required.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

CHAS. THOMAS,

Acting Quartermaster-General.

NEW ORLEANS, December 1, 1863.

Major-General FRANKLIN, New Iberia:

GENERAL: The major-general commanding expresses the greatest satisfaction with the condition of affairs in the region under your control.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

CHAS. P. STONE,

Brigadier-General, and Chief of Staff.
