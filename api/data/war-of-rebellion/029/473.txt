My staff officers, including Captains Palmer and Bestow, of General Wood's staff, not heretofore mentioned by me, all performed their duty gallantly, and ably assisted me in every way possible.

I would also refer to my report as brigade commander, as that gives more in detail and more truthfully than any other report the operations of Colonel Wagner's and my brigade on the 31st, they being both under my personal observation and control after the heavy fighting commenced that day.

The casualties in the division were as follows:

The First Brigade went into action with 71 officers and 1 454 enlisted men, and lost-officers killed, 4; officers wounded, 21; enlisted men killed, 42; enlisted men wounded, 278; enlisted men missing, 34.

The Second Brigade went into action with 86 officers and 1,389 enlisted men,and lost-officers killed, 2; officers wounded, 18; enlisted men killed, 54; enlisted men wounded, 269; enlisted men missing, 32.

The Third Brigade went into action with 97 officers and 1,790 enlisted men, including the Sixth Ohio Battery, and lost-officers killed, 5; officers wounded, 17; enlisted men killed, 104; enlisted men wounded, 312; enlisted men missing, 101.
