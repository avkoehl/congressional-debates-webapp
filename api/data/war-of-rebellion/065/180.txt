They are situated at the foot of the scarp of the main work of Gregg. No observation can be made this morning.

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding.

Lieutenant S. C. BOYLSTON,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.

FORT SUMTER, January 14, 1864.

SIR: I have the honor to report that affairs continue quiet. The density of the fog affords good cause for an assault, but it would not find us unprepared.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
