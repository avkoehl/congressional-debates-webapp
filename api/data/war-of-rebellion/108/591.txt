(I am not sure which) to advance against the enemy by the road running to the left through the fields. Afterward Captain Fairfax met me on the way and guided me to the immediate vicinity of the field of battle, where I met Brigadier-General Pryor, who gave me further information of the position of our own troops and of the enemy in the thickets before us, upon which information I led my brigade into aciton. I met Major-General Longstreet near the Building toward the top of the hill after taking the left hand road, and has some short conversation with him in reference to the movement of my brigade, of which I do not retain any distinct recollection. I presume that General Longstreet sent Captain Fairfax to guide me. General Longstreet had nothing else to do, so far as I know, with putting my brigade into position.

With high respect, very truly, yours,

MAXCY GREGG.
