MAY 6, 1864-4 p.m.

General [A. E. BURNSIDE]:

Colonel Humphrey reports that the Tenth Regulars have connected with Eighty-fourth Pennsylvania about one mile on his right. If Mott attacks, my right can move forward as he gains ground. but it will require Potter's division at least to support my right a mile in length. I propose to refuse the left till the right comes up.

Very respectfully,

O. B. WILLCOX.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
