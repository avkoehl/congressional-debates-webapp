more than an hour after the battle ceased I was ordered about 1 p. m. to withdraw the brigade to the high ground at the edge of the river bottom, which was accordingly done, and we encamped for the night.

I desire to call the attention of the brigadier-general commanding to the heroic fortitude and indomitable courage exhibited by the men and officers under my command. Although we had marched a distance of nearly 50 miles in less than two days, furnished with but a scant supply of provisions, and almost entirely without blankets or other protection from the rain and dampness, the alacrity and cheerfulness with which they obeyed orders and responded to every call made upon them throughout that trying march and subsequent battle vindicated the high reputation they have always borne as patriots and soldiers.

It is difficult to conceive of ground more unfavorable on which to fight a battle than that in the vicinity of Jenkins' Ferry. The battle-field was a low swamp in the Saline River bottom, which was rendered almost impassable by the rains which had previously fallen and the bayous and lagoons which intersect it in every direction. It was over this marshy ground that my men marched and fought for nearly six hours. Their exhaustion and fatigue at the close of the action can better be imagined than portrayed.

I beg to make favorable mention of Colonel William M. Moore, commanding Tenth Missouri Infantry. This gallant officer was severely wounded near the close of the action while at his post encouraging his men, and refused to quit the field until ordered by me to do so. Lieutenant Colonel Simon Harris, of the same regiment, was instantly killed while bravely [engaged] in the discharge of his duty. The army has not been called to mourn the loss of a more gallant or efficient officer nor the country a more disinterested patriot and citizen than Simon Harris. Endeared to all who knew him, his memory is enshrined in the hearts of his comrades in arms. His loss to the country is irreparable. Major Magoffin efficiently commanded the regiment after the command devolved upon him. Lieutenant Cols. P. W. H. Cumming and Thomas H. Murray, commanding, respectively, the Sixteenth and Eleventh Missouri Regiments of infantry, deserve the highest praise for their gallant bearing on the field and the ability which they displayed in handling their commands in action. Major L. A. Pindall, commanding battalion of sharpshooters deserve especial merit for the sturdy and unwavering courage displayed by them ont he battle-field. Captain A. A. Lesueur, commanding Missouri Light Battery, belonging to this brigade, was detached from my command at the beginning of the engagement and ordered to report to Brigadier-General Marmaduke, commanding cavalry. He rendered efficient service with his battery on another portion of the field. I desire to return my thanks to Lieutenant Samuel M. Morrison, acting assistant adjutant-general of the brigade, and Lieutenant H. Buford Armistead, my aide-de-camp. The zeal and intelligence which they exhibited in carrying and delivering my orders, and their gallant bearing in the face of the enemy, renders honorable mention of them but an act of justice. My entire loss in the engagement was 10 killed and 50 wounded, a list* of which is herewith
