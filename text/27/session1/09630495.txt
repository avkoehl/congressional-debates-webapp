SPEECH OP MR. STOKELY,
OF   CHIO
Inthe House of Representatives—On the resolution submitted
by Mr Winthewp for the appointment of a Committee to take
evidence as to the operation of the exiting system and rate*
of duties on imports, &c
The following resolution, submitted by Mi Wi throp,
from the Comml'tcc on Commerce, being undei considera
Hot. viz
"Resolved, That a committee of nine members, not more
than one of whom shall be from any one fctate, he appointed
bv the Chair, to sit during the lecess, for the purpose of talc
ing evidence at tiie prmupal poits ofentiy, and elsewhere,
as to the operation of the existing system and rales of du
ties on imports upon the manulacturing, agricultural, and
commercial m'eiestsof the country, and of procuring, gene
rally buch mfoi mation as may be useful to Confess in any íe
vision of the revenuelaws which may beattempted at the next
session "
Mr STOKELY rose and addressed the House as follow 
Mr Speaker Ido not rise fir the purpose of making a speech
on this resolution, but merely to say a few words in lepiy to tne
honorable gentleman fiom New Yoik city, [Mr McSeon ] who
has just taken his seat, and to bring to the attention of the
House some persons interested m this question, and some mte
rests to be affected seriously by these inquiries It has hereto
fore been treated as a matter wholly interesting to the Nonh and
the South, and no mention has yet been made of that vast and
fertile country watered by the Ohio and its branches, and which
is capable oí containing, nay, sustaining in ease and comfort, a
population equal to ail that part of the United States lying east
of the Al'eghany mountains' This county, and the hardy and
independent occupants of it, are richly entitled to, and confi
dently expect, the fostering care and protection of the Fedeial
Government. The several gentlemen who have addressed the
House on this subject seem to take it for granted th it there has
been a compromise, a final settlement of this matter between the
North and the South, that the object of this committee, and
the labor of theinepou, willbe to undermine and destioy this
compromise, and a d in the le establishment of a "protective
tariff" It appears tome sir, that this is an unjnstand im
proper view of tne subject What reason experience mav
have furnished for the senouschaige that a committee, "electco
with the care and precaution we aie assured the Speaker will
observe in the selection of this impoitant one, will be a one
sided, partial, and unjust one, I cannot pretend to know, being,
as I am, a new member But if so little faith c in be placed m
the committees of this House as is alleged, if they can be so for
eetful of the duty they owe to themselves, to the country, and
to the great interests thus specially entiusted to their caie and
investigation, as to labor to present a partial and uniust repoi t,
can facts be so distorted, so discolored and varnished over as
not to present some true statistical information for
the benefit of Congiess and the country) Could this
committee, even if so disposed like hired counsel, to ar
sue and insist upon one side only of this gieat question,
pervert the facts, and suppress the information' Certainly not
Still we shall have the testimony taken by them submitted in
wrmn" and no doubt printed, and upon these, outside the argu
ment, Congress and the country can tetui n c true, enlightened,
and impartial verdict, followed up by leaislative execution
Gentlemen who are opposed to this investigation triumphantly
a,k What benefit has been derived from the investigations of
the'committees of the British Pathament on this subject' The
c mse of humanity has been advanced bv bringing to light the
inhumanity and barbarity exeicised towards the operatives in
some of then laige manufactories and the remedies applied bv
the Parliament consequent therein And although the whole
e<Toit of the committees in Great Britain appeals to be partial
and intended to effect political obiects still the facts are slated,
and sometimes stand ou   m bold relief to contiadict the argu
""if 1 undeis'tand the ob|ect of this resolution, it is one that is

been the complaint of the business men of this countrv, that

the gentleman from New Yoi k says that he goes for no party
or set of people that unfurl the flig of "protection ¡oagrn nliuie,

I .evented hv the shortness of the lime allowed me li >m going
into an argument I have only to s,y that his assertion is ill
rectly contradicted by the enlightened experience of all civi
lized nations, by the best and standard authois on political eco
nomv, and by the unifoim practice of this Government from
the time of the adoption of the Federal Constitution, and the
enlightened experience of our own country is worth a thousand
theoretical books, w.ltten on this sbiect in Europp for exporta
tion entirely—not made the foundation of any action at home
Let me ask the gentleman tolookto Ins own country, lis vailed
inteiests resources   and productions, and not to the nriiralshy
the last steamship from England'   In the kindest and very 1 est
feeings let me invite htm and the gmtleman from South Cam-
boato ascend with mc the lofty peak of the  Alleghany, and
lnnlc west into the magnificent valley watered bv t\ e beautiful
Ohio and its tr butaiy streams    Hi will theie find a countiy
and a people their inteiesis and productions, which demand
his attentioi as a  legislator     They aie as yet, merely the
hardy  pioneeis of those  who will one  day dwell there in
peace,   independence,  and safety, and who  will number as
many p opleas arc now scattoiedovei  this broad Union '   ITe
will find there themeuno rejoicing as much as he did on the
banks of the "Duero, and a thousand flecks with  the finest
fleeces covering the greenest and richest of all green lullt^
while the valleys below will remind him of those of Anda

have imported these productions, we are detei mined, for «ur
selves, never to become a dependent British province, nor to go
back to a state of colonial vassalage t   The Western editnn

"-  •    ■- of our community, much mors benefit,we think, than
the firest drawn argument, or nicest set of abstractions, inge-
nuity could make or deduce
But why should I dwell upon these subjects in detail? Itis
as clear as d monsnation can mike it, that eveiy country, to
beenuiely independent, must manufacture for itself, and hava
within it not only the material, butthe fabucation, of all things
necessary for its comfort, safety, and defence The only ques-
tion is, what aie these' Anieles of metal are admitted by all
to be of this class Are not the others equady essential to our
independence' Is not the fleece 1 have already menuoned,
and which is of more impottance to us than was the "golden
fleece" to the Argonauts of tld, the essential mateiial of that
wholesome envelope which waims your infant in us cradle,
youi grandsne m his chair, and your soldier in his lent! WiJl
you be dependent on a foreign couniry for that which enables
you to face the stoi ms of weather and ol war? Blankets and
tents aie as essential to your soldier and sentinel as are the
muskets and cannon with which you arm them And n is just
as absurd and dependent to impon, and depend upon the con-
tmgencies of commetce foi the one as for the other.
Will ai y one dale to place his country in the position to beg
of a fo.eigu foe, who may be thundering in all the panoply of
modem wai all along youi coast, to wait until you import the
munitions of defence, and to please not mo'est them on their
pa=sa ,e? In reply, I may be told that oui legislation is now not
lor wai, but foi times of peace We all know that the history
ol nations is but little else than an account ot bloody and con-
tinued w,i« and although we as a nation have been greatly
hhssedhya long continuance of pt ace, yet, even m this happy
and peaceful countiv, the Temp'e of Janus has never been for
a long lime shut, and it has now stood open fir more than five
years, while we warred with a handful of half aimed savages.
But the history of one section of our country presents such a
lovely picture ol happiness and piosperny, derived principally
from Ibis policy, that I need only point to it in older lo enlist
us exper.erce in favoi of protection, even m times of the
most profound and uninterrupted peace
Thecouutiy to whieu I allude is equally unblcst, mitsgene-
lal g ography, by a feitile soil or a genial enmate What,
then, his rendered it the object of universal admiration, un-
equalled for ihe elegance and refinement of us inhabitants, the
e imfoit an 1 ease m which they live, and the high station they
hold tlnoughout the world for all the attributes of a free, en-
lighted and independent people—the very gaiden spot m all
tins wide Union? The foundation of the singu'ai and unparal-
leled impiovement of New England was laid in that veiy
protective policy, now so loudl) denounced upon this floor '
It was that detided and here movers illy denounced system
that produced the magnificent m,nufaetones and mansions that
be unify us hills and villejs, making the hum ol mdustiy to he
hend iiom the oican to the heads of hei nveis It was this
that i an ed noble cmes to 11 e, as if by magic, at every water-
fall and convened hei cascades into ihe means oi diffusing
coinfoit and competence, elegance and intelligence, overall
that sterile land—making the mill turn, die anvil ring, and the
merry shuttle dance'—presenting to the admiring eye of the
historian and philo6ophei the unusual union of health, morality,
virtue, and the highct intelligence and mechanical skill, m a
dt nse and crowded population' These aie some of the results
of that system which gentlemen have refeued to as having
In ed ]ust long enough to be universally condemned. Not so.
These results will, I tiust, long la tas hying evidence of its ex-
cellence T, for one, have fol it ihe kindest lecollections,
although it is for the present dead, nay, buried, under a load of
useless and impracticable abstiactions—this same much lauded
compromise act being foi it a slow, but sure, executioner For
this law I have about as much respect and affection as a man
would have foi the guillotine that would slowly decapitate his
oldest and best fin nd liut now is not the lime or the occasion
to discuss either us propr ety, amendment, oi repeal When
th amine does arnve, I hope to be here to take part I shall
consider anl use it as an honoi anda high privilege indeed to
do so                                                                  ,   ^   .
Peimitme heie, howtvtv, to say one word of obituary no-
tice of that old American system 1 believe it to have done
much very much m its short and piecatious 1 fe, to develope
the resources multiply the meansof happiness and prosperity,
and to have given that impetus to improvement and indepen-
dence throughoutour countiy which can never again betaJsen
away or extinguished It was marching on, I thought, to great
and glorious attainments and of its constitutionality I had no
doubt Ihe internal commerce of this gieat and extended
country was cherished and sninulated by the removal of many
impenetrable instructions Mountains inleivenmg between
commeicial States were passed over wuh App.an ways Long
and noble nveis were cleaied out and niüde to beat on their
bosoms the rich productions of thousands oimnesoftbc most
ferule land  from their banks to their naturtl maiket Theex-
tiemes ol this extended empire were being brought nearer
together every day by thi removal of natural obstacles, and your
Government heie, at the centre, could be made to reaeh the
extremities of the Union with locom tive velocity, thus carry
m  the means of intelligence and its salutary action to its re
molest constituents wi hout regaid to lime and space In short,
theselntercommuu.cajons wee be ommg fountain  ofwealih,

social union and intercourse that ever blessed or beautified any

But I am admonished by the approach of the hour of adjourn-
ment to hasten to acl re and have only to say in conclusion,
that I hope this resolution willbe adopted that a careful and
impartial investiga ion will be made, and a mass ot facts and
statistical mf imationbe ibtained fiom business, intelligent,
