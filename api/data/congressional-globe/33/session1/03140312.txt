' of purchasing: a site. Then, whoever is at the
head of the Treasury Department, pressed as he
is by those about him locally interested, thinks
the expenditure may as well be enlarged in refer-
ence to the particular work, and enters into some
contract, or some arrangement, without an appro-
priation, and in advance of the action of this
House and of Congress.
Now, sir, I have placed my vote in the Com-
mittee on Ways and Means, and I mean to place
it here, simply upon the ground, that in reference
to such expenditures by the Government this
House should lead, and the Executive officers fol-
low. If the Committee on Commerce, or any
gentleman who has this matter at heart, will to-
morrow, or at any reasonable time, introduce a
bill which shall place a proper guard or restriction
around these custom-houses, and around the officer
who has the construction of them in charge, I am
ready to vote, and will vote, for it; and when it is
adopted, 1 am ready to vote, and will vote, the
amount of money which the Secretary may think
necessary, or which he now thinks necessary, to
complete these custom-houses. I do not doubt but
that these houses ought to be completed; nay,
more, there are others that ought to be built; but,
sir, they should be built upon some system, not
by allowing the Secretary of the Treasury to con-
tract for any amount he chooses, but by having
estimates properly submitted in advance, and upon
approval by this House. Let Congress make
the appropriations in advance of the contract and
the labor, and avoid this following after the Sec-
retary, and constructing our public works and edi-
fices on a system of deficiencies, so to speak.
Sir, I am not speaking with reference to the
''present Secretary particularly, nor am 1 speaking
with reference to any one in the past; but we owe
it to those in the future, and we owe it to our-
selves, and the country, that we put upon the
Secretaries some legal restraint; that we should
make them responsible for the contracts they make
unauthorized by Congress.
There should be some specific amount provided,
beyond which no Secretary could go; that amount
should be placed in your regular appropriation
bills, and not made up by deficiencies. Some gen-
eral system; some general plan; some general
bill, with appropriate restrictions, should be
adopted. This House should assert its rights, ;
and the Executive branch of the Government j
should be made to follow this House in the admin- 1
istration of law.
For these reasons, and others of like character,
as one of the members of the Committee on Ways
and Means, I have resisted what 1 believe to be a
usurpation upon the rights of this House upon
the part of an Executive oflirer of the Govern-
ment, in making contracts for the expenditure of
money in advance of appropiiafions by Congiess,
and thus, year after year, creating these large de-
ficiencies. I know, sir, it has been done by former
officers as well as this one; they are equally
wrong. I have not given my consent to former
appropriations for deficiencies of this character,
and I cannot give my conscnt now.
Mr. McMULLlN. I have been very much
gratified by recent developments, and especially
from my friend from New Hampshire 
The CHAIRMAN. The Chair must remind
the gentleman that the discussion, under the rule,
upon the pending amendments has exhausted it-
self.
Mr. McMULLIN. It is not my purpose to
enter into any discussion. I move that the com-
mittee do now rise.
The question was put, and the motion was
agreed to.
The committee accordingly rose, and the
Speaker having resumed the chair, the Chairman
reported that the Committee of the Whole on the
state of the Union had, according to order, had
the Union generally under consideration, and par-
ticularly the bill of the House (No. 49) to
supply deficiencies in the appropriations for the j
service of the fiscal year ending the 30th of June, j
1854>"and had come to no resolution thereon. |
Mr. CAMPBELL. I move that the House do j
now adjourn. ^ I
The question was put, and the motion agreed |
to, and,   |
At,a charter before four o'clock the House ad- j
jourhed until to-morrow at twelve o'clock, m. I
