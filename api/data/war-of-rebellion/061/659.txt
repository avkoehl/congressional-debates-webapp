Numbers 2. Report of Major General Frederick Steele, U. S. Army, commanding Department of Arkansas.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF ARKANSAS, Camp 20 miles from Arkadelphia, Ark., March 27, 1864. (Received April 6.)

GENERAL: Yours of the 20th instant is received. I moved as soon as possible. General Banks sent me a dispatch informing me that his movement had been delayed by rain and bad roads. General Thayer telegraphed me that the troops at Fort Smith could not be ready before the 21st instant. On that day he started. He is to join me at Arkadephia. I shall be through before him. I expect to hear from Banks in a day or two. I am probably ahead of him.

It is officially reported that a large force of the enemy is fortifying at Monticello. More than half of my cavalry are dismounted, and most of the rest very poorly mounted. Artillery horses and transportation in the same condition. This department is the last to be served, my troops scattered all over Arkansas, and still I am expected to move on short notice. We have had to haul most of our forage 30 and 40 miles for months. Still I am confident of being able to do my share of the work before me.

F. STEELE,Major-General, Commanding.

Major General W. T. SHERMAN,

Louisville, Ky.
