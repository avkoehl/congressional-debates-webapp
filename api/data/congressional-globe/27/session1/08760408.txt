greater good could not be done to Spam than to relieve them
from, the curse of those settlements, and make them an in-
dustrious people hk© their neighbors A gieater evil could
not happen to England than to add them to our already over
grown possessions He equally objected to our idle ch mefa of
aft, expedition to PortFerrajo, and to oui disastrous conquests
in. the West Indies It was a clear candid proposition o^peace,
accompanied with a rigorous economy of expense, that could
alone recover us fromjthe shock that this Order of Council had
given to public credit "
The Lord Chancelloi came from the woolsack to make a
"single observation upon the latter part oí what fell fiom the
noble Maiquis He had deprecated the idea of forcing bank
paper into circulation by making it a legal tendei He thought
it just necessary to say that it never entered into the contem-
plation of his Majesty's ministers to use any foicible means Ic
was impossible to say in this stage of the business what plan
the wisdom of the Legislature might devise, upon the report
of the committee, but he could take upon himself to say, that
it never yet had been conceived, that it wou dbc wise or piu
dent to make banknotes a legal tender
The Marquis of Lansdowne expressed considerable satis
faction at the information imparted to him by the noble and
learned lord on the woolsack, and said he was extremely happy
eo find such were the feelings and sentiments o< mmisteis Had
he known as much before he began his speech it would have
saved him and the house some time He flattered himself
that by lenient measures and peisuasive means, the good
/sense of the country might he worked upon to produce the hap-
piest effects
Parliamentary discussion or any book aftnrds few, if any,
better explanations of money and credit than this, finespeech oí
Lansduwne, whose merits history Will weigh m scales m
which the nobility of Petty's descendant will be as nothing to
the prophetic wisdom of his supenoT knowledge of the truths
of political economy Of all the whole peeiige of Great Bn
tain, but eleven could then be found to vote with him, anl of
those, not one of the bench of bishops or of ¡aw The Than
cellor, indeed, epuld not stomach the infraction of it, winch
making bank bills a legal tender, would peipetuate, but left the
woolsack to condemn it, uninformed perhaps that the minister
designed to go a length, which the actof Pdrhament itself \ eils
in mystery. Common sense, morality and economy weie
equally offended by this stioke of pol cy, which may indeed
have saved the ministry, and possibly th1 king from his threat
ened escape to Hanover But it saved the ministry and mo
narch at an expense to the country which po&teiny can
nevei pay, and of law, morals, and n, on, not confine I *o

A seciet committee was appointed by the House ol
Lords to leport on the necessity of providing; foi the
cunhi mation and continuance of measures raktn m pur
suance of the Sunday minute of council The ministerial
design of this committee was to put the best face
that could be on the high handed measure of invalidating
the currency, and impairing the contracts bv which the bank
was bound to maintain itundefiled These voluminous reports
resemble all others on similar occasions, by making the de
ntred argument They, of course, reported to the Hnus-> a-- their
opinion, after ashow ol examination into the state ol the bank,
"thdt it was necessary to continue asid contnm the measures
already taken, for such time, and under such limitations and ie
sanctions, and with such power of discontinuing the same as to
the wisdom of Pai hament may seem expedit n t " 'I he i epoi t
acknowledges the inability of the committer to isteitam the
tcldtive proportion of com and papei but that n could ninny
be doubted, that there wai too little British coin particularly
silver, current in the kingdom The cnculation of paper was
carried fo its gieanst height a shoit time previous to the be
cmnms:of the yeai 1793, andjust when the circulation began
to be so much diminished the war commenced A state of war
alway requiresamore ample cnculation even within the kins
dom, the public loans which, in all w r«, are necessary, and
m that war were paiticulaiiy gieat, employ a consi
derable portion of the circulating capital The sums
expended on the Em opean continent during the foui
years of war were about fifteen millions sterling, but
the war exports, during war, to Germany aione, amoun ed
to eight million  sterling a year, while m peace they were
ie«s than two millions The exports toGerminv alone, intime
if war, were more than tw.ee as much is all ihe exports to
Fiance, rianders, lioltand, and Geiminy, in fnip ofpea.ee
The quantity of bullion coined at the Mint in '95 and J96, was
considerably less than one million of pound , when was not
more than one'-nth of the quantity coined the two preceding
years Theaverage amount of bonk notes m cnculation for
several years previous to the yen 17%, wis. between ten and
eeven millions of pound* sterling The amount nn the ¿5th
Fe^iuary, 1797, was but little more thin tin ee millions and a

minute of Council of the 26th February, 1797, in payments of
cash by the Bank, confined such limitation to the 24th June
thereafter, that is, about seven weeks, and no more. So deep
waseithertho delusion oi the imposture The preamble re-
cites unusual demands foi specie, in consequence of ill founded
or exaggerated alarms, rendering it indispensably necessary
for the public service that the Bank should forbear issuing cash
in payments, except for unavoidable purposes, preludes an
act indemnifying every person concerned therein, forbids the
is&ue of cash m payment of any debt, except allowed by the
special provisions of that act, authonzes the fatal one
pound notes by the issue ot any sum in cash not exceeding
twenty shillings, stops legal proceedings for recoveiy of ai y
other sums, directs payment m bank notes to be good for public
revenue, and that no persona shall be held to special bail who
offer payment m bank notes, and deposite them m court On
the 22d June, this act of Farliament was continued by another
like it, limiting the restriction on cash payments to one month
after the commencement of the next session of Parliament, but
authorizing coin payments to any amount to the army, navy,
ordnance,and to Government if required by Older m Council, and
to collectois of public revenue, thus legalizing one kind of cunen-
cy foi public servants, and another for private persons That ses
sion of Parliament closed on the 20th July, 1797 The first act
of the next session, on the 39th November of that year,
so far put an end to delusion, as to renew the suspension oí
cash payments until one year after the conclusion of the war
authoiizmgthe Bank to receive in ea^h any sum less than Ü5G0,
and to repay only thiee fourths in cash, but to pay cashfor all
demands on giving previous notice thereof to the Speaker of the
House of Commons, who was to publish it
Such notice would nevei have been given, but the suspen-
sion made pei petual, had it not been coercivel r, after a most dis-
tressing struggle, put a stop to, by act of Parliament, alter a
quarter of a centuiy'  dishonest endurance
During thetiuce between England and France, called the
peace of Amiens, the Miniatei Addmgton, who kept Pitt's place
for him, and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Vansittart, re-
iterating the hackneyed delusive demand foi further temporary
suspension of cash payments, of course got it from Parlia

violence took four millions of dollars in specie, with other pie

At that time, above all others, English gibbets groaned with
victims to the bloody code which papei money piled on them.

remorseless security of papei money Ihe Bank of England
inflexible, the King, privy council, and ministers inexorable,
in bringing all counterfeiters, to what was the lawful and deemed

refused to execute their part of this code of blood transpor-
tation eot rid of more convicts that in the same period
of time Siberia received from Russian condemnation An Eng

duties by the order of abigoted King, whit h marks an epoch m
national economy with oveiwhelming debt, and a let in the
course of law by unprecedented obstacle to it Soon sanctioned
by the fuice and solemnities of legislation, stupendous fraud
became the reputed deliberate act of Parliament The few
weeks to which this dictatorship in finance was at first appa-
rently restricted, lapsed into months and years, until a quarter
of a century confirmed the imposture The agony of recover-
ing fiona the consequences of the first fatal aberration convulsed
Great Britain The lesson ol impostuie was soon learned by
the United State*., and the worst parts of British precedent
grossly exaggerated, without any ol its redeeming qualities
Not till twelve years after peace, by which time France, on
the broad foundations of solid currency, had completely reco-
veied, when the insane King of England had paid the debt of
nature, whose obstinacy lost America, alienated Ireland,
and subdued France, was even the attempt seriously made of
restoring English cuirency The tribulation of it extorted tTie
wildest laving^ of blind avance, against which bCience and rea-
son long contended in vain
The banks of England and North America, from which all
American banks arc sprung, weije .merchants* expedients,
adopted by Governments as shifts for finance, but founded on
money Their foundations have been almost entirely removed
by modern banking on paper The aboriginal and pervading
delusion is, that Government buys credit from banks with less
credit than Government, and borrows that ciedit m promises to
pay when its own credit should command money Like an
imaginary sinking fund, when expenditure exceeds income,
and the balance is evened by loans, banks incorporated of indi-
viiuals to issue paper substitutes for money, are demonstrable
and costly delusion, however familiar and habitual favorites of
communities The metaphysical cloak of chartered entity
might as well be dispensed with, but for the contrivance of a
few and prejudice of the many One individual as a corpora-
tion, alore, might as well be endowed with the mysterious in
tangibility of the more diffused yet identical responsibility of
several in the aggregate corpoiauon Public sentiment would
at once revolt at investing a single president of a bank with the
corporate rights, privileges and immunities conferred on the
president, directors, and company Government cannot grant
charters butfor public good Though the real object is always
pnvate gam, yet the only right Legislatures have to mcorpo
late it. foi the good of the public Few a re aware of this, which
is nevertheless the unquestionable cornel stone o^the whole au-
thority
When to abuseofit is superadded that of paper money, to be
made by corpoiate powei, the authority becomeb stionger than
the Government of law Otherwise Gov ernment would never
be pre\ailed over so egregiously as to impair and absolve b>
law the obligation of contracts i\on payment ofbank notes is
moie illegal and immoral than failure to perform any other
piomise Necessity and general accommodation are mere pre-
textsffor bank suspensions The effects of extra judicial, above
all legislative mterferencebetween bank  and their creditors, is
much more detrimental than between man and man, because
