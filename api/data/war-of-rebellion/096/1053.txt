SUGAR LOAF, January 14, 1865 - 11 a. m.

His Excellency Z. B. VANCE,

Governor of North Carolina, Raleigh:

The enemy has landed a heavy force, and evidently intend making a strong effort. We need all your assistance, and as soon as you can send it. Bombardment of Fisher yesterday was heavy, but damage and loss slight.

General R. E. LEE,

Richmond:

The land force remains in position, covered by gun-boats and heavy ships. The bombardment of Fort Fisher by the fleet was heavy yesterday until dark. Damage and casualties very slight.

SUGAR LOAF, January 14, 1865 - 8 p. m.

General R. E. LEE,

Richmond, Va.:

The enemy succeeded last night in extending his line across the peninsula, and interposed between us and Fort Fisher. His line has been closely examined by myself and General Hoke, and he considers it too hazardous to assault with such an inferior force. Fisher has been re-enforced with sufficient veterans to make it safe. The width of the river is such the enemy cannot control it from his position even with artillery, and he has yet landed none. Weather continues fine and sea smooth. Bombardment to-day light.

SUGAR LOAF, January 14, 1865 - 7 p. m.

Major General J. F. GILMER,

Richmond, Va.:

Our operations here are likely to eventuate in a siege of Fort Fisher. It is therefore of the utmost importance I should have the services of Major Johnson. So far nothing has been heard of him since your dispatch.

SUGAR LOAF, January 14, 1865 - 10.30 a. m.

Flag-Officer PINCKNEY,

Wilmington:

Enemy has extended across the neck, and has his left resting on river about two miles and a half above Fisher. This offers fine opportunity for our gun-boat, as enemy has no artillery. If you will let gun-boat stop at Fort Anderson, and report arrival to me, I will send a staff officer to point out enemy's line, so as to distinguish it from ours.
