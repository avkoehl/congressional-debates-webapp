teen passed here yesterday. Last evening twenty-two blockaders were in sight, this morning only thirteen are seen. One monitor reported in Great Ogeechee and one in Vernon River, Georgia; two more are supposed to be at Hilton Head. All this would indicate an attack on Savannah or that Foster is going to re-enforce Banks. Under first supposition, I must have my troops back from Wilmington with additional, or Savannah may be taken.

General, Commanding.
HDQRS. DEPT. OF SOUTH CAROLINA AND GEORGIA, Charleston, S. C., February 2, 1863.

Brigadier General R. S. RIPLEY,Commanding First District, Charleston, S. C.:

GENERAL: The movements of the enemy seem to indicate Savannah as their future objective point. The battery at Genesis Point, on the Great Ogeechee, has twice been unsuccessfully attacked with an ironclad (a monitor), four gunboats, and one mortar boat, to which the battery could oppose only two effective guns-an 8-inch columbiad and a 32-pounder rifled. The result must be very encouraging to us for the defenses of this harbor. I desire sending to Genesis Point (if it can possibly be spared from this district) one 42-pounder rifled, with some ammunition, &amp;c., complete. You will, then, if it can be done, send one to the railroad depot for Savannah as soon as practicable.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. T. BEAUREGARD,

General, Commanding.

WAR DEPARTMENT, C. S. A., Richmond, Va., February 3, 1863.

General G. T. BEAUREGARD, Charleston, S. C.:

I order General Whitting to return you a brigade and to hold another ready for transportation. I have telegraphed Governor Bonham ot urge the immediate passage of a law to retain the reserve regiments, or, failing that, to retain than as militia. You had better urge the same course.

J. A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War.

General R. E. LEE, Fredericksburg, Va.:

General Beauregard expects an early attack. I must return his troops sent to Wilmington. I shall telegraph General French, in command at Goldsborough, to replace them as far as practicable with re-enforcements. I give you the information that you may consider the necessities of the situation and judge as to the advisability of sending any troops toward North Carolina.

J. A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War.
