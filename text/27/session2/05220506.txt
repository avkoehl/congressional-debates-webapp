aliun, undei which they have ^o long been deprived of their
rights and I will here ask Uy what authority, under this
chartei, (if it doe  exist,) do Senators from that State occupy
i laces upon this floor? Does the charteraulhoriz  the State to
elect Senators to thcCongiess of the United States? Sir, does
the charter authorize a convention of the people of Rhode Is
land to incorporate that State into the body of the American
Republic? I presume not, sir By what authority, then.did
they act, when they became a constituent part of this Union?
Was it under that charter, granted more than a century be
fore the Revolution—was it by virtue oí that charter, under
which the majority of the inhabitants were disfranchised, that
¿at State took refuge like a tempest tost vessel, and became
saftly mooted m the harbor of the Republic? Do you bring
the charter into the Federal Constitution with you? IVo, sir,
the people oí the State of Rhode Island adopted, in solemn
convention assembled, the Federal Constitution—the vital,
elemental y principle of civil liberty It wasrecognised by all
parties Without this the State could not have become a
member of in* Union, because the Constitution requires that
tins's ¡all be done This waB not the work ofapaity, i' wasef
fected by the fathers oí the Revolution, who laid down the
fundamental law of civil libeity—men whose veins were
drained of their life blood in procuring that independence and
the enjoyment of that civil liberty, for then descendants What
did that convention do? They declared "that there are certain
natural rights, of which men, when they forma social com
pact, cannot deprive or divest their posterity, among which
are the enjoyment of hie and liberty, with the means of ac
quiring, possessing, and piotectmg property and pursuing
and obtaining happiness and safety " "that all power is na
turally vested in, and consequently derived from, the peo
pie, that magistrates, therefore, are their trustees and agents,
and at all times amenab e to them " that the powers of gov-
ernment may be reassumed by the people whensoever it
shall become necessary to their happiness "
Never was tbeie a declaration stronger or more comprehen-
sive than this made by the sovereign people of the State of
Rhode Island Well, sir, what have they subsequently done?
Why, as soon as they got snugly established as a part of the
Union the Governor and Company of the Province effected the
resumption of the sovereignty because there was not popular
power enough around them to resist 'I hey resumed thesover-
eignty, meting out to the people as much right and as much
wiong as those sovereign legislators thought proper to mete out
Instead of having their own duties prescribed to them, they as-
sumed the right to prescribe to the people, their lords and mas
ters how much liberty they shouid enjoy Sir, the President of
the United State? it seems is now called upon to sustain this
charter of a Biitish monarch íohn Tyler is called on to act
a-, Challes lí of England would have done, in enforcing this
charter—by force ofarms Who ever beioie heard of an appeal
toan American Piesidenttosupport British authority? And I
say again, if he has the right to call in the aid of an armed force
to sustain that authority, the independence of {his country does
notetist Such a proceeding might be tolerated in Canada,
but, in relation to one of the States of this Union, the supposition
is as ridiculous as it is odious The President declares that he
feels himself bound, and thatit is hisefuty, to employ an armed
force, il it becomes neces°ary m order to enforce obedience to
trii^ usuipation, which has been foi half a century in existence
in Rhode Island He will march an armed force of American
citizens into that State in martial amy, to shoot down the peo-
ple, in order to sustain that charter, which it was the main ob
jectof the Revolution to destroy Let him try it' let him try
i ' The Piesident is a man, and but d man He is an offi-
cer of the Government, and but an officer
The powei which constitutes the President rests neither with
thio bod / nor its ft lend" it possesses a moral force which is su
perior to eithei Let the President undertake to march an army
into Rhode Inland, to pit down the liberies of the people at
the point of the bayonet, and he will have done a deed of which
his posterity will be ashamed—of which the nation will be
ashamed But though he threatens to do it, and stands officially
pledged todo it, I tell him, as I have told him faceto face, that
the A menean people will not permit him to doit Heieiswhat
will test the question [holding up a placard ] This I look upon
as the first flash of indignation from the enraged brow of an
angry people, and I warn the President to take notice of the
lightning's flash as being the foierunnei of a stoim that will
cover him with deep disgrace
Yes, sir this is a Government of principle, sustained by the
sense of the people, and the man who rashly undertakes to put
down pcpulai lrbeity m this country, will meet with signal dis-
comfiture In connexion with my honorable colleague, I have
the honor of representing one of the great and glorious States
of this Union, and, sir, I can assure you that I speak the feel-
ings of the great body of the people, acting only under the
promptings of a bold and heroic magnanimity, when I eay that
they would be roused—that they would rally as one man m de
fence of our glorious liberties, whether invaded by foreign or
domestic foes
I now offer n resolution which will test the sense of this body

ant is it than a y question of a bank, a tariff oi any question
of national policy which can arise under om form of sovern

taken to decide the question for the American people—and that,
too, against the people themselves Well sir, I ban1, ard I re
peat it and it is with no unkind feelings towards any one—for
reasons for such feeling I have none, but for thecontrary feeling I
have many—but to illustrate the beanngofa gieat truth—a truth
which has shaken the globe itself, and which I hope will con
tmue to govern the world as long as it Continues i*s revolutions
upon its axis I say again, there was no constitutional form of

be considered to he propeily a member of this, Union until the
