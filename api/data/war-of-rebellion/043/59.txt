HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,Poolesville, Md., June 27, 1863. (Received 9 a. m.)

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

That there may be no misunderstanding as to my force, I would respectfully state that, including the portions of General Heintzelman's command, and General Schenck's, now with me, my whole force of enlisted men for duty will not exceed 105, 000. Fourteen batteries of the Artillery Reserve have been sent to Washington. Of General Abercrombie's force, one brigade has just been sent home from expiration of service, and the others go shortly. One brigade of General Crawford's force has not reported with it. I state these facts that there may not be expected of me more than I have material to do with. My headquarters at Frederick to-night. Three corps at Middletown, one corps at Knoxville, two at Frederick, and the remaining infantry corps very near there to-night.

JOSEPH HOOKER,

Major-General.

General HOOKER,

Army of the Potomac:

Major [James C.] Duane and Captain [George H.] Mendell were ordered to your army, and it is presumed that they are en route. I do not know where they now are, unless in your army. Maryland Heights have always been regarded as an important point to be held by us, and much expense and labor incurred in fortifying them. I cannot approve their abandonment, except in case of absolute necessity.
