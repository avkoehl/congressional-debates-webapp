HEADQUARTERS, Louisville Ky., December 4, 1863.

Colonel True notified me his pickets were driven in last night at Mount Sterling,on the Perryville road;that the enemy[numbered] 8OO. He hat taken to the houses. I ordered him out of the houses to fight;that enemy could burn town. Enemy not exceeding 2OO,and that he could and must whip them. Don't believe there are 2OO.

He telegraphed General Fry that it was reported that 3, OOO of Longstreet's had come in. Colonel Gallup is at Paintsville. The whole story a rebel lie to scare Colonel True. I leave for Lebanon and Camp Nelson. Will you send Major Simpson to meet me there in regard to roads and place for working negroes?
