heard nothing of Judah, Hobson, or Shackelford. I fear Morgan has picked up some of my scouts at Bardstown. None of them have returned according to orders.

J. T. BOYLE,

Brigadier-General.

JULY 6, 1863.

General BOYLE, Louisville:

I learn that Morgan the Twentieth kentucky at Springfield, and then moved toward Bardstown. A small body of rebels reported at Harrodsburg. The sheriff of Woodford Country reports that the Home Guards' pickets at Lawrenceburg were driving in. It is said that [R. S.] Cluke, with a portion of Morgan's force, went from Lebanon in the direction of Columbia after the surrender. I am anxiously awaiting to hear of the whereabouts of Judah's force. A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.

JULY 6, 1863.

General HARTSUFF, Camp Nelson, Ky.:

The following just received from Boyle:*

I am satisfied that a portion of morgan's force went toward Columbia from Lebanon. Parties should look after them. The cavalry force at Lebanon and those with Judah can look after Morgan's main body. I want the whole available command of the State put in readiness for a rapid movement as soon as Morgan is driven out. I have Boyle to direct the force at Lebanon, if necessary.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.

JULY 6, 1863.

General BOYLE, Louisville, Ky.:

I think your force at Louisville ample. At any rate, it will be impossible now with the road broken to get troops up from Munfordville, even if you could get orders to them. Telegraph to the force at Shepherdsville to hold their position till our cavalry come up, which will be either to-night or early in the morning. If you have any guards between Louisville and Shepherdsville, they be sent down to re-enforce the garrison there. I will try to send you some infantry and a battery from this place. I may be able to send you a gunboat.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.

JULY 6, 1863.

General BOYLE, Louisville, Ky.:

Have ordered the telegraph from Danville to be repaired; am expecting to hear of its being ready every moment. Have received the following telegraph from Hobson:

I move. Not safe to give particulars. General Judah is in the right place. He could not get with me. I have advised at to the proper disposition of force.

HOBSON.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.
