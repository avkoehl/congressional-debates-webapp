HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,Manassas Junction, July 17, 1861.

General EWELL,

Union Mills:

The enemy being in such force we may not be able to attack Centerville with safety. You will confine yourself to protecting the right flank and rear of Jones' brigade, and be careful to protect your own flank from any attack in the direction of Fairfax Station. Keep strong pickets on roads leading in that direction, and let not the rear of Early's brigade move too far from the Union Mills Station. But should you in the course of events find it practicable to make a sudden and successful attack on Centerville you are at liberty to do so.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. T. BEAUREGARD,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

Brigadier-General BONHAM,

Commanding First Brigade:

GENERAL: I have just telegraphed you as follows: "Your dispatch is received. You can commence moving to Mitchell's Ford to-night, altogether, if necessary." You were written to on the subject through Major Rhett. I now furthermore instruct you to use entirely your own discretion as to when and how you should fall back on Mitchell's Ford. I have ordered Colonel Kelly's battalion Louisiana Volunteers and one North Carolina regiment to report to you at Mitchell's Ford, to support you as a reserve or to extend on your left for the defense of Bull Run in that direction, if necessary.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. T. BEAUREGARD,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
