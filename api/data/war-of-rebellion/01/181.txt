FORT SUMTER, S. C., February 22, 11861.

General JOS. G. TOTTEN,

Chief Engineer U. S. Army, Washington, D. C.:

GENERAL: The work on the third breaching battery on Cummings Point has progressed so that the embrasures, three in number, are being commenced. Some work was also done on Fort Moultrie yesterday and the day before; at least it was commenced the day before. This consists of a parapet of earth in front of the scarp wall of the front that faces us, apparently intended to serve as a glaces, as it rises to the height of the cordon. It is reverted on the side next the scarp wall with barrels, and has a pretty steep slope upon the side towards us.
