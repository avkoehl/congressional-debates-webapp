1834._________           THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.                                     35
terms, and by a decision of the courts, applicable
to the case only of debtors, who, unlike the bank
in this instance, obtain possession of the public
money, i  their capacity of public officers. What
may be the design now in making, " for obtaining
a decision, "a proposition, which would doubtless
fail if accepted, is best known to yourself and such
" distinguished" counsel of the Bank as you cite
to this Department, m your other published letter
of the 26th ultimo. It must be admitted, that the
bank, in the next place, evinces great frankness
in proceeding to disclose, under five separatespe-
cifications, what it expects to prove on trial.
"Whether there is much likelihood that this ex-
pectation will ever be realized, others must de-
cide: but the ingeniousness in stating beforehand
to "the opposite party what is to be proved against
him, should not pass withoutdne commendation,
though it is regretted that, under all the circum-
stances, a suspicion—it may be an unjust one—
has arisen, that the statement was made rather
with a view to be immediately laid before the
community by the bank, either to " inflame the
passions" or to forestall public opinion on those
points before a reply was received from this De-
partment.
In laying down the first position which the
batik asserts it " will always be ready to prove,"
viz: " that the bill of exchange on the French Gov-
ernment was drawn without the slightest authority
whatever from that Government," it is feared that
the zeal of the bank to vindicate a foreign Gov-
ernment has led you to overlook the treaty, in
which that Government expressly stipulates to
pay " the sum of twenty-five millions of francs
' at Paris, in six annual installments of four mil-
' lions one hundred and sixty-six thousand six
' hundred and sixty-six francs and sixty-six eent-
' imes each, into the hand of such person or persons
' asshallbe authorizedby the Government of the United
' States to receive it." The bankappears, moreover,
to have forgotten the written authority, under
seal from the President of the United States,
which accompanied the bill, and empowered the
holder, as the person designated in the treaty
and in pursuance of it, to receive the money,
which -had then become honestly due from the
French Government, and should, notwithstand-
ing your apology, have been promptly paid, ac-
cording to every principle of national good faith.
In your ardent defense of a foreign country, for
a neglect to fulliil its treaties, and attack upon a
Department of your own, " for acting without the
slightest authority whatever," it also seems to
have escaped notice that the Treasury acted, not
only under the authority beforenamed, from
Prance, of a solemn stipulation to make the pay-
ment to any " persons" " authorized by the Gov-
ernment of the United States"—and that the
holders of this bill were so specially authorized
by this Department and the President*, but that
Congress had previously empowered and required
the Secretary of the Treasury, by the actof July
13, 1832, " to cause this money to be received
' from the French Government, and transferred to
' the United States, in such manner as he may
' ¿eem best." If, notwithstanding all this, unfor-
tunately for your own country, the bank should
be able to support the position, that " the bill
was drawn without the slightest authority" from
Prance, you certainly will deserve her acknowl-
edgments for the aid thus rendered to get rid
probably of the whole of a claim which she has
appeared not very eager to discharge; because,
if France was not liable, under all the circum-
stances, to pay it in that form, it is difficult to
discover how she is liable to pay it in any form.
It is to be regretted that, in your professions
of regard " for the credit of the Treasury, "know-
ing then as now what its authority was for draw-
ing the bill, you did not refuse entirely to take it,
as the bank must have foreseen and believed, that
the money would not probably be paid on an in-
strument if drawn " without the slightest author-
ity," and that the affair would probably end in a
claim by it for large damages. Were it not for
the solicitude, since expressed by the bank, to
accommodate the Treasury, and the " indiffer-
ence" the bank now professes as " to the money,"
it might be inferred by some, that possessing the
beforementioned opinions, and pursuing the be-
forementioned course, it must have meditated
originally a speculation as to the protest and
exoected damages.
What seems at first rather inexplicable is, that
the bank, knowing, and being ready to prove,
that this Department drew the bill " without the
slightest authority," and hence could not require
France to pay any damages if the bill was pro-
tested—should yet insist that the claims of dam-
ages by the bank was " an indispensable act of
duty, to enable the Treasury to claim damages of
the French Government." This great kindness
to wards thoGovermnentof yourown country, un-
invited and voluntarily to seize on its revenue, and
attempt to plunge it into a lawsuit at home, and
a controversy abroad, to enable it to obtain large
damages of another country, which it must, if
obtained, immediately pay over to the bank, cer-
tainly deserves all due acknowledgment. In fine,
while the bank is professing to give all this
friendly advice for the benefit of the Treasury,
and to feel, itself, " a great indifference about the
money," its regard for the Treasury upon this
particular subject seems, when stripped of all
blandishments, to consist in urging the Govern-
ment to demand, and to hazaid a new quarrel
with France to obtain, large and vindictive dam-
ages, by asserting that thoy aro as much due " as
the principal," when in fact the United States
are entitled from France to only the reasonable
and actual damages sustained, and when large
and vindictive ones are to be sought in behalf, not
of the Treasury, but of the disinterested institu-
tion which is urging this indefensible measure;
and when, if such aggravated damages are ob-
tained, they are expected to go at once, and ex-
clusively, not into the Treasury, but into the
vaults of the bank; or, wjiich is virtually the
same, are to supply the place of the great amount
of public revenue the bank has already on this
account seized and withhold.
But notwithstanding this, if now, or at any
other period, the bank shall, as alleged, be ready
to prove that " the money was paid by the agents
of the bank to save the credit of the Treasury,"
the favor will be cheerfully acknowledged by this
Department, as in that event no right in the bank
to the aggravated damages claimed against the
Treasury, and which has led to the outrage of
seizing on the public dividends, could well be pre-
tended to exist. It is hoped, as you profess to
consider that'" the claim of damages by the bank
■was an indispensable act of duty," you will also
not hesitate to perform another equally " indis-
pensable act of duty," by furnishing, as early as
practicable, the evidence to prove the point just
mentioned; since, if such evidence is furnished,
not only should the aggravated damages be relin-
quished, but the conduct of those agents, and of
the bank in that particular, be duly appreciated.
In that event, they of course did not pay the
money for " the credit of the Treasury," for the
purpose of exacting from it, on account of the
professed favor, the large constructive damages
of $ 130,000 or $170,000; but it must be presumed j
they paid it with a view to save the Treasury
from exposure to such a claim by some foreigner
who might be heartless or sordid, and whose pe-
cuniary profit being alone concerned, might be so
destitute of patriotic feeling for his country as to
permit the bill not-only to be protested abroad,
and the " credit of the Treasury" to suffer, so as
to have it returned home protested, but who
might thereupon immediately make a demand on
the Treasury beyond the actual damages and
costs sustained, and even for great, and it may
be properly added, penal damages, and to pursue
this demand in so inexorable a spirit as not to
wait for the decision of Congress upon it, but,
without legal precept or any previous notice of
his design, to seize upon a large amount of the
public revenue, for the purpose of discharging
it.
In relation to your third head of proof, " that
' of the money so paid by the bank, the whole
' waff immediately appropriated by the Treasury,
' and a part used in the current expenses of the
'Government," it gives me pleasure to attempt
a correction thus early of these misapprehen-
sions.
This Department has, in the reports sent here
monthly by the direction of the president of the
bank, statements which show that the amount
standing to the credit of the public in the Bank,
which of course includes its branches, was at no
time after the purchase of the French bill on the
Uth of February, 1833, until the formal return
of the money to the bank on the 18ttí of May,
1833, less than eight millions of dollars; that of
this, at no time, was less than four millions left
in the bank and its branches, to the credit of the
Treasurer, subject to draft for any purpose, and
that the residue was deposited on account of the
public debt and of the public collecting and dis-
bursing offices. So that, whatever sum of money
may have been "appropriated by the Treasury"
or "used" between those periods, it still left in
the vaults of the bank and m its use, standing to
the credit of the Treasurer, at the times of all
your intervening returns, a sum from three to
four millions beyond the amount of the bill, or
j from three to four times more than the amount
I which you had, in form only, paid to the Treas-
: ury, or passed to its credit, in trust for the nu-
i merous sufferers by French spoliations. And no
: part of the sum received on the bill was ever so
"appropriated" or "used" by the Treasury,a?
to be carried into it by warrant; or it could not,
until Congress should have passed a new law,
have refunded, as it did, the whole amount, the
moment notice was given of the protest of the
bill.
In regard to the practice which you cite of thia
Department in charging  damages on   ordinary
bills of exchange bought of individuals who sus-
tain no official relations with the Government,
and who neglect to provide funds abroad to meet
those billsand to pay punctually our creditors and
officers in a foreign country, it is hardly neces-
sary here to show the difference between the two
cases, in both form and substance, after the pre-
ceding remarks, and after the views contained
in the first opinion of the Attorney General, pub-
lished with the late annual report from this De-
partment.     Still  less   is   it  necessary  to   show
further that in none of those cases probably did
the idea ever enter into the imagination of the
officers of the Government, that they ought, in
order to obtain the damages due and often actually
accruing to the full'amount received on protested
| bills, to resort, without either notice, lawful pro-
¡ cess, or a previous adjudication, to a seizure'of
j the property or dues of the individuals who drew
! and sold them.    As in conclusion you giveassu-
| ranees that" all" your allegations " will be made
! manifest whenever the Treasury resorts to the
i proper tribunals," this Department takes the Iib-
I erty to renew the expressions of its opinion that
j it lias already resorted to the proper tribunal, in
| the first instance, by submitting this whole trans-
] action to the consideration of Congress, where
you will doubtless be indulged with an opportu-
nity, if desired, to make all your charges " man-
I' ifest."   But the bank may rest satisfied, that it
I will be long, unless otherwise directed by Con-
gress, before this Department, however urgently
! " invited" by the bank, will consent to enter into
' any arrangement, or to institute any proceedings,
! which, under existing circumstances, will, in their
! operation, be likely to take from Congress, and
j transfer  to some other tribunal, the  power  to
i adjust controverted claims, when no law has been
passed, nor/ippr.opriation made, to pay them; and
which will be likely to break down those salutary
checks  and distinctions between the legislative
and judicial departments, as to the disposal of
the public money, which the people and the States
have, with much clearness and wisdom, estab-
j lished in the great charter of their Union.    For
1 ample views on the law and equity of the whole
¡ case, and for any further reply which may be
i proper to any of the principles advanced in your
| letter, in support of the extraordinary claims and
: proceedings of the bank, you are referred to the
! late annual report of this Department, and to the
! opinions of the Attorney General that accompany
I it.
| Had the bank thought more of following, in its
¡own example, the salutary advice it so frankly
| bestows on others, not to "prejudge" or "dis-
| cuss" this question of its claim to damages, and
I had it omitted to " prejudge" or "discuss" it in
| the report of its committee" last December, and in
; your letter now under consideration, the preced-
i mg remarks m relation to it would most cheer-
; fully have been forborne, This Department has
i now, very reluctantly, but in the manner that
i seemed to be required by the tone and contents
¡ of your co'mmumcation, replied to such portions
: of it as appeared to merit notice, and can sincere-
i ly conclude with the consoling reflection, uttered
