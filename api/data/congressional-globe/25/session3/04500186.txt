APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
[February 15}
25th Cong..-.3d Sess.
Interference in Elections—Mr. Moane.
Senate.
somersault with which to delight and astonish any
person Mr President, if I should speak less of
the bill which is the immediate subject of delib-
eration for the Senate, than of other matters, I
find my apology and excuse in the many exam-
ples which have been set me in this Chamber, and
in the comity invariably extended by the Senate
to its members With this introduction, and
with a view that I should not seem to have been
inattentive to the important, the vital bill now on
your table, I beg leave to make a few remarks in
regard to it.
Sir, I agree with my colleague m regard to that
bill, only so far as he represents it to be one of
treat and of pervading importance None could
e moie so I might well leave the report of the
Committee on the Judiciary, which has, in a
masterly manner, exposed the dangers of this bill,
to the luminous speech of its author, the honoi -
able Senatoi from New Jersey, [Mr Wall,] in
defense of its positions, and the bill itself, and the
arguments in its favor, to the masteily, and, in
my opinion, unanswerable speech of the honora
ble Senator from Pennsylvania, [Mi Buchanan ]
Anything from me now would be but a vain at
tempt to " add a perfume to the violet " But,
sir, I differ so totally and entirely fiom my col-
league on this question, that I cannot, and will not
foibear to notice some of his points And, sa,
first and foremost, I beg leave to say that 1 nttuly
differ from him in tht doctune he uigesin defense
of this bill, and has often pressed on other occa
sions—of the "duty of the Government to tale
care of the rEOPLE " Sir, I repudiate and uttoily
deny any such doctrine It is at war With the
genius of our institutions, it is at wai with the
spirit of the Constitution, it is at wai with all
my observation and understanding of the practi-
cal operation of our Government, from the year
1789 to the present moment It was the intention
of those who fiamed it, to make this, as near as
possible, a Government of the people, identified
with them, and finding its only suppoit m their
virtue, affections, intelligence, and wisdom The
doctrine, sir, that it is the duty of the Government
to take caie of the people, is a doctrine much bi t-
ter suited to that country which has a " king that
can do no wrong," and a Legislaluie that is " om
nipotent," than to this country, where all tht
power of the Government is gitintcd by the peo
pie, and that power not specifically gtanted, is
specially waved to them Sir, Lngland lias been
glorified in this Chamber, ami held up as the
fountain of oui liberty, and tht piopci model for
our imitation I will, by and by, touch upon
that view taken by my colleague, for the pr« sent
I will only remark on this one gieat essential
difference between the hbeity of the people of
England and this countiy It is this Tint all
the liberty which the people of England enjoy is
by grams foiced and extorted fiom their Govi in-
ment, whilst all the power possessed by the Gov-
ernment of America has been cautiously and sum
mgly gi anted by the itofll, who retained to
themselves all that is not plainly and cleat lygi anted
Sir, I acknowledge not this doctrine of the "duty
of Government to take care of the peoph " Theie
)s no knowing the dangers and excesses to which
it might not lead I adopt, as my creed, precisely
the reverse of such a doctune, and say that it is
the duty of the people to take care of í'ietr Gov
ernment The Government belongs to them, and
not they to the Government So much, sir, has-
tily, for this point.
Sir, what is the bill on your table> It proposes
to make it highly penal for certain persons hold-
ing offices under the General Government to give
their opinion, except by a vote at the polls, about
any public election whatever, whether for the
General or State governments' And this bill is
advocated by my colleague' Sir, I do most cor-
dially agree with ray honorable fi lend from Penn-
sylvania [Mr Buchanan] when he calls it agog
lau, and pionounces it to be worse than the " se-
dition law " That law went to abudge the fiee-
dom of the press, and permitted the tiuth to be
given inevidence, and this goes directly and openly
" to abudge the freedom and liberty of speech,"
which is so sieiedly guarded by the Constitu-
tion "None of these enumerated office holders,"
says the bill, " shall persuade or dissuade any
elector to give,or not to give, a vote!" Persuade,
sir, means to advise, and advice is most frequently
the mere expression of opinion. And, sir, we
are told that one hundred thousand freemen of
America are to be put under the ban of this odious
law, and subjected to the surveilance of the mil-
lion of base informers, who, by it, are to be re-
warded with money for eavesdropping, and dis-
torting and repoiting the generous impulses of
the freemen of your States, to whom alone is left
the power to legislate on the great right of suf-
frage Theie is not a State m this Union that
has not legislated on it, that has not passed laws
to protect its freedom, and to punish its abuse
But, sir, why is it that this bill has not em
braced all  the officers of the General Govern-
ment'    Why has it omitted  the highest, who,
fiom theirsiu/io , then talent, and fieqtiently their
wealth, might be supposed to have influence on
then countrymen'   It has assailed those who, its
advocates say, owe their brea I to the Government
Yes, sir, we have heard a great deal about cus-
tom house officeis, about weighers and gaugers
and tide wai teis, as if their " pu suasion'* or " dis-
suasion** was to control the destinies of elections
Sir, when we  see men filling the  s< cond  most
elevated sta'ion in the woild interfiling in elec
tions—nay, sn .endeavoring to piomotc then own
to the veiy highest station, it is mock iy, indeed,
to pass a 1 iw tomuzzk, to gag, and silente weigh
as, gangerst tidewaiteis, and quill di nets'   And
at hist, su, what is, oi has ever Ik en, the power
and lnflut nee of these " legions," these '  Pieto
nan bands," as my colleague talis  them'    in
the cities, wheie  Government officers are most
numeious, the Admmistiation has been deflated
Look to New Yoik, Boston, Philadelphia, Balti
moie and Richmond     Indeed, sir, look thiough-
out every village even, where " two or three are
gatheied togelhei" in commeice, and you will see
now impotent are all your public officers against
the all corrupting power and influence of money,
and yet, su, we cannot pitvail upon these gen
tlemtn, who are willing to abudge the freedom of
speech of these poor nnpottnt pubht officers, to
aid us m any i floi t to rescue the Governme nt and
the people of this countiy tiom the foul and eiuel
dominion ofassotiated   wealth—of monopnln s,
of banks     But what dots the experience of by-
[ gone timos say about the dangoious nid o nnipo-
| tent  influentes  of   tin so   public   office n>—these
ham bands, these cohoili, and such  nanus, with
which tin y ate di sígnate d >   Suiely no one will
say that it  was by then  mighty influence that
Washington,   Teffeison, Madison, and  Monioe
weit I opt in offi t foi eight ytats '    And  low
was   t, sir, that the e hler and   the junioi Adams
rae l  went by the board, and woe mcigod, and
drowne d, and sunk foiever m the ocean of popu
lar indignation '    Their " legions" of public ofli
ceis  were  impotent to save  them      All tneir
pationage was of no avail
But why, sir, should 1 be assailing this bill on
tin so d< tails, when it is to its pnnciples I object'
Why should I attack it on the facts 1 have stated,
when, if they weie all untrue and unfmnded, I
should be opposed to it I am oppose d to it, sir,
j because it is unconstitutional I am opposed to it
because the Congicss of the United States have no
light to pass any law " abndging the fieedom of
speech " Nay, I go fuithei, and siy they have
no light to pass any law abndging the fieedom
of election, which gieat subject is left with the
States, and it is of the very essence of that fiee-
dom, the " i ight of Jí eely examining public chai acters
and measuies, and office communication among the
people theieon " But, sn, this tiuth is gotten over
on the present occasion by a view which, as far
as my memory serves me, was not piesented by
any of the sagacious and bold defendéis of the
"sedition law " That view is taken by my col
league It is, that the office-holders aie no por-
tion of the people, embraced by the provisions of
the Constitution, or whose rights aie defended by
theoelebiated iepoitof Mi Madison1 Heinforms
the Senator from New Jei^ey [Mr Wali] that
he does not understand that gi eat work, that he
has lead it to but little advantage if he does not
see that public officeis are no portion of the people,
contemplated in that unequaled defense of con
stitutional right' I, su.hke my ft lend fiom New
Jersey, have also read this glonous document,
[holding Madison's Repoit in his hand]—this
little book, which I once heard John Rindolph call
his political Bible—to but little purjiose, if one
hundred thousand free citizens, (the nUmbei men-
tioned by my colleague,) who have rendered
themselves respectable enough in their vanous
callings of life to become public officers, aie at
that moment cut off from the great constitutional
rights secured, without exception, to all the peo-
ple ' Officers of the Government not a portion ot
the people' The pioposition is staitlmg, it is, to
me, monstrous ' I haidly know how to refute it
But, sir, I turn to this sacied papei, the Constitu-
tion You will there find that the woid people is
mentioned six times, and six times only I will
be as little tedious as possible, but let us look
into it The first time the word orcuis is in the
preamble "We the people," &c , "to secute
the blessings of liberty to owselves and postetity,"
&c Now, su,it is evident that no office holders
of the Government could be members of the con-
vention that cieated it, yet, sir, if my colleague's
doctrine is coriect, that the office holders are not a
poition of the people, it would inevitably follow
that those men who now hold offices under the
General Government, who aie the " posterity"
of the then people of the United States, aie not
entitled to the " blessings- of libeity," which that
chaiter intended to secure to "themselves and
postmly "
The second occurrence of the word is in the
second section of the fiist aiticle " Members,
&.c , shall be chosen eveiy second yeai, by the
ptopLr of the seveial States, and the electors m
each State," eve Now, sir, in this place the peo-
ple are mentioned without lestuction, and such of
them as are electors, by the State laws, aie secured
in all the qualifications granted by the laws of
the State, and there is no law in any State that I
know of—certainly not in Vngima—that deprives
Federal officers of any of the rights of othei elec-
tors
The thud instance occuis in the first amend-
ment to the Constitution " Congitss shall make
no law abndging tht ntehtof the people ptateably
to assemble," &c Now, sir, if tht officeis of the
federal Government aie not a poi lion of the peo
pie, tin y lose this inestimable pi ivilege
The fiuith ociui rente of this word people in
oui chartei is in tht second amendment "A well
icgulatfd rnihtu, &c The right of the people to
beai arms shall not be questioned " W ho does
not peueive that, undei this extraordmaiy d :c-
timi advanced by my colleague, no public officer
embiuud in this bill tan keep mfueloc1 '
The fifth time tins woid people is written m the
Constitution, is found in  the touith amendment
" The light of the people to be secuie in then pei
sons, houses, papéis, and effects, against unioa-
sonahle seaiches and seizuies, shill not be ques-
tioned "   What security have tht pooi  public
olhctis igainst staich and seiztuc, it  this mon
stious doctune, that they fotm no poition of the
people, is to pie vail    '
I hi sixth and 1 ist ti ne in which the word peo-
ple is to be found in the Constitution, is in the
t nth ameiidm nt " Flic poioeis not delegated to
the United States, &c , are icseivod to the States,
lesptetively, oi to tin people "
1 am sony, Mi Piesident, to have been thus
tedious Who does not see, fiom this plain, sim
pie reading of the Constitution, that an oflicer of
this Government, who ought to feel at least that
he is a freeman, is cut off fiom evtry light which
this Constitution meant to secuie to fitemen, if
this new and astounding doctrine be tiue ' But,
Mr President, I must pass to other points, as Í
have much to say on othei matters besides this
bill
My colleague says " he floes not look upon
the leport against this bill as the work of an mdi-
vidual, hutas a concerted system to sustain the
Lxecutive by the party '" Strange language this
fiom thatsource May 1 ask him what he means
by " the pirty " What paity, su,does my col-
ltague speak of It is too eaily for him to be
talking with emphasis about " the party " Such
language mny evince his feeling towards the
" executive" he is so distiessed to see receiving
support, but I must be permitted to say that it
can have no further effect Itib " adcaptjndum,"
and can oily be intended to aid in brca'u lg
down this Administration   My colleague asks the
