General R. E. LEE:

(Via Guiney's Station.)

Your dispatches of this date received. I will nominate General Gordon to- morrow morning, as recommmended. The withdrawl of the enemy across the Chickahominy and the expected arrivl of General Beauregard with nearly two brigades seemed to permit the sending of Hoke's brigade to you, and it was brought tot he depaot for that purpose, but a dispatch from GeneralHoke informed GenerL Bragg that the enemy from Bermuda Hundered had perssed him heavily, and had passed above Drewry's Bluff, upon which the order to Hoke's brigade was countemanded. I anitipated your want of fresh troops, and have earnestly watched for an opportunity to send them. I dare not promise anything now. If possible, will sustain you in your unequal struggle, so long and nobly mintained.

JEFFERSON DAVIS.

SInce the repulse of the enemyw ho was pursued from your army we hear of amovement on SOuth Side to CHester, a ndit sis sid the Dnaville railroad is broken. There is indicated a fixed purpose to break the railroad communicatin, and for obvious reasons. YOu know the time it would require to rebuild the Anna bridges. I trust your effort to obtin supplies by promise to return them in kind has been successful. Hav e directed the promptest measures for rebuilding Chickahmony bfrtidges so as to restore communicatin with yo.
