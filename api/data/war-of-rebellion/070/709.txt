HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF WESTERN VIRGINIA,Dublin, May 2, 1864.

Brigadier-General ECHOLS,

Commanding, &amp;c.:

GENERAL: I have this moment received a letter* from General R. E. Lee, expressing the opinion that Averell is on his old ground near New Creek, and that while we are threatened from the Kanawha a general movement may be intended on Staunton. Can't you send some picked men to penetrate the country at all hazards and solve the question whether it is near railroad or on Kanawha, and what their forces are?

Yours, truly, in haste,

JNO. C. BRECKINRIDGE,

Major-General.

Colonel JOHN McCAUSLAND,

Commanding, &c.:

COLONEL: I have this moment received a letter from General Lee, expressing his opinion that Averell is on his old ground near New Creek. I had felt confident from our information that he was in Kanawha Valley. Can't you send some picked men to penetrate the country at all hazards, and solve the question?

Yours,

J. C. BRECKINRIDGE,

Major-General.

DUBLIN DEPOT, VA., May 2, 1864-8.30 p. m.

Colonel McCAUSLAND,

Commanding, Narrows of New River:

From two sources I learn a considerable force is in Logan County, supposed for a raid on Saltville, railroad, and lead mines. I have asked General W. E. Jones, now at Saltville, to move to Jeffersonville, and told him you will be at Princeton to-morrow. Wharton should be at Giles Court-House to-night. A raid may be accompanied by a real or feigned movement from Fayetteville. Tell De L'Isle to hold the new ferry-boats ready at Narrows. I suppose he has stretched the ropes at Shanklin's Ferry.

JOHN C. BRECKINRIDGE,

Major-General.

ABINGDON, VA., May 2, 1864.

General BRECKINRIDGE,

Dublin:

A courier just in from Logan County reports 400 cavalry of the enemy reached there Friday last. Seven regiments are said to be on their way to the same point. Everything, it is believed by our friends there, indicate a raid in this direction.

W. E. JONES,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
