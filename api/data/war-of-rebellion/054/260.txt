and delaying enemy as much as possible. All workshops and mills will be destroyed here and elsewhere on the line of retreat. The force of the enemy reported as Longstreet's two divisions, Stevenson's division, and Wheeler's cavalry entire. Burnside does not feel sure whether he will be compelled to pas the mountains. Possibly he may be able to stop this side, and not entirely abandon East Tennessee. In the former event he may lose his trains and animals, but can save artillery.

I leave immediately for Chattanooga, passing the Clinch somewhere north of Kingston.

LENOIR'S STATION, November 14, 1863-11.30 a.m.

It is reported here enemy have not yet finished their bridges; have no artillery or cavalry across. Burnside is resolved to attack them with one division of the Ninth Corps, about 3,000 strong. Distance

hence about 10 miles.

CHATTANOOGA, Tennessee, November 18, 1863-12 m.

Arrived here last evening. Had my departure from Burnside been delayed a single day I could only have got out through Cumberland Gap or that of Big Creek.

Burnside's present position seems safe except for Longstreet's great superiority in cavalry, the latter having Wheeler's whole force with him, from 7,000 to 9,000 strong, while Burnside cannot concentrate more than 3,000 without abandoning the upper part of the valley to Sam. Jones, and endangering his communications on that side. Still, there is a reasonable probability that Burnside will be able to hold Knoxville until relieved by operations here. I found him possessed by the idea that he must expose his whole force to capture rather than withdraw from the country, and so firmly was this notion fixed in his mind that when the report arrived at 1 a.m. on the 14th that Longstreet had begun to build bridges at Loudon, he actually dictated the orders for throwing his whole army south of the Holston into Blount County, where all his communications would be cut off at once, and where on his own estimate he could not subsist more than three weeks, while General Parke thought ten days' subsistence would be the utmost to be found there. Parke argued against this idea in vain, but finally General Wilson overcame it by representing that Grant did not wish him to include the capture of his entire army among the elements of his plan of operations. Burnside's command is in great want of first-rate general officers, both the Ninth and Twenty-third Corps being commanded by brigadiers who are comparatively inexperienced, General Hartsuff being incapacitated and General Parke employed as chief of staff.
