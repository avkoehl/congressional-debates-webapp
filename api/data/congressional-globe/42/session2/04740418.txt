, Avenira margin from September, 1868, to December, 1870, inclusive, 1 213-221. Diffeienco of margin in
Liverpool during tho two periods a fraction loss than one half cent per pound.
By a comparison of these tables it will bo
observed that while the United States exports
to Great Britain fully two thirds of the cotton
produced by us, we furnished in 1805 and
1806 bat fifteen por cent.,'in I860 atid 1807
thirty-eight p«r cent., and in 1807 and 1868
foity-one per cept. of the cotlop in the Liver-
pool and London markets. 1 call attention to
the otl)e.f fact, that (he average margin between
New York ami Liverpool, the ruling cotton
murketof the world, during the existence of the
Cotton t$x, was nearly oup half per cent, greater
than it lias been subsequently, showing con-
clusively that the price ,of cotton in this coun-
try has been relatively greater sincc tho repeal
of that tax than it was during its existence, and
per consequence the burden of tho tax was
borne by the producer and not by the consumer.
lu laying this tax. Congress assumed that
it was a duty, impost, or excise, and not a
direct tyx. No attempt to apportion was made.
Consequently, if it be a direct tax, it is uncon-
stitutional upon that delect.. In conclusion
of the argument as to the constitutionality of
the cotton tax of July 18, I860, i submit that
the propositions upon which 1 have based my
remarks, namely, that it was unconstitutional
because, first, it was a tax or duty on articles
exported from the several States producing
cotton; second, if it were a duty, impost, or
excise, it was not uniform; third, if it were a
direct tax, it was not apportioned among the
several States according to their respective
numbers, stand proven.
The unconstitutionality of the law of July
IB, 18G6, once fuliy established in the minds
of the members, I presume there is no man
upon the floor of this House who will oppose
the repayment of'the moneys wrongfully taken
from the cotton producors of the country
under its operation : and the only question is
how it may be made. Upon this subject I
u ^we-11. My colleague from
the fourth district of Mississippi has presented
to the House a bill containing in its provisions
a method of reimbursing the parties wrong-
fully compelled to pay this tax. This bill is
now in the, hands of the Committee of Ways
aod Means, and 1 hope wjll bp soon Reported
upon with such amendments as they may deem
wise and judicious.
The great, broad equity which should em-
brace all its provisions are:
First, that the Government having wrong-
fully taken from the citizen a portion of his
substance shall make prompt and full restitu-
tion to the uttermost farthing;.
Second, that such restitution shoald be so
made as to embrace as far as practicable all
classes, from the laborer in the field to the
factor who furnished the supplies necessary for
the making of the crop. The bill offered by
my colleague was intended to cover these
points; if it does not, the Committee of Ways
and Means or the House will undoubtedly
make such amendments as will remedy the
defect. The bill is on the files, and I hope
will be thoroughly considered by members
before it is brought before the House for final
consideration.
In presenting my views upon this question
I have endeavored to speak in a perfectly un-
ltnpassioned and impartial manner. The sub-
ject is entirely outside of any party issues. It
affects neither the Republican nor the Demo-
cratic party. It is an appeal from one entire
section of the country, including all classes,
all colors, all parties, to the General Govern-
ment. It is true that the cotton tax was im-
posed upon the people of the South at a time
when their fortunes were at the very lowest
ebb; when war had passed over their fair
fi-lds, blasting and destroying their homes
and fortunes; when the very interest upqu
which the imposition of this tax bore so griev-
ously was perhaps at its lowest estate;'when
the cotton-planters, both white and colored,
hud neither hoes nqv plows wherewith to plant,
lacked mules and horses wherewith to culti-
vate, wanted far bread and meat, had abso-
lutely nothing but their industry and the dis-
position to retrieve their fallen fortunes. In
my own county, in 1807, I knew of a number
of colored men who pitched and cultivated
.their crops with hoes, and whose sole subsist-
ence for a month at a time.was unripe corn.
I know of other persons during the disas-
trous years of 1866 s-nd 1867, persons of re-
finement and culture and of former wealth,
who went' hungry for want of bread. The
cotton crops of 1866 and 1867 in the States of
Louisiana and Mississippi cost the producers
thirty-three and a thjrd per cent, more than
the cotton sold for in the marjeets of the world,
and ruin and want at)d misery were spread
broadcast over the length and breadth of those
fair States. None escaped. The prosperity of
our section depends entirely upon our agricultu-
ral success. With us a failure of crops affects all
classes, the merchant, the mechanic, and man-
ufacturer, as well as the farmer, to a far greater
extent than it does iu the North, where the
crops are more diversified, and where an entire
failure of produce is almost impossible. The
picture is not overdrawn when 1 assert that in
the years 18G6 and 1867 tine material interests
of the South were almost wholly prostrated,
and the cotton tax collected of a poverty-
stricken people. But. sir, 1 have yet to learn
that the people of the United States will grant
or refuse a right because of the wealth and
prosperity of the claimants on the one hand,
or their poverty and distress on the other.
We do not come before this House as sup-
pliants for favors. We challenge the justice
of the nation. The tax-gatherers of the Federal
Government—and I make no invidious use of
the term—put their hands into our purses
and took our money without the authority of
constitutional law. We ask, and we believe we
have the right to demand, that the Govern-
ment make as full and complete restitution as
is possible.
It must be remembered that the cotton of
the United States is t-he product of the toil of
the colored men of the South. It was so before
the war, when Uie profits of their labor inured
to the benefit of the yhite slave-owners ; it is
110 less so now, when their labor is their own.
The cotton tax in the light of this fact was
simply monstrous and inhuman. The colored
man, freed from his servitude, was cast upon
the world homeless, houseless, penniless, un-
clothed. His only hope for the future was
his industry in the fields of labor then open
to him—the cotton fields of the South. The
planters, ruined by the disasters of the war,
were unable to employ them save upon shares
iu the crops to be raised, and then only when
they could obtain sufficient supplies or ad-
vances from their factors to purchase the
necessary farming implements and stock tQ
perform the labor of cultivation and feed
and support their hands. The factor, iu order
to secure himself for the advances made, took
a Hen upon the crops to be made.
The cotton produced did not pay the ad-
vances made by the factor, and at the end of
the year all were involved in a common ruin.
The factor lost his advances, the planter his
credit, and the colored man, after his year of
hibor from early dawn until dark, found him-
self at the close of the season iu the same con-
dition lie was at its commencement, a penni-
less, homeless wanderer. To this state of
affairs the cotton tax contributed its full share
of desolation. The Government conferred the
great and inestimable boon of freedom upon
the colored people of the South, but at the
same time Congress, through its cotton tax,
withheld their bread. I do not assert this
was intentional. On the contrary, I know
that this legislation arose entirely through a
