e zn Poweis, yet he is but one of the three great
dipiumtnts ot   the Federal Government, com-
niiinic Uing to, and communing with, the  othtr

tive may express unkind 111 lings tow aid foiLign
Powers, and such evpus&ions maytend to 1x1s-
ptratL them, >et such Powers cannot call upon
us ti expliin or apologize as 1 nation, for it is
not the nauon that his spoken in tin Executive
m ssagi      But  Fiance seems to think, because
the  Pi-sidiiH has attackLd the I101101   of thur

he ma\ do, and it is promr In should, (though
not up in l impulsion,) 111 the vny way 111 whu h
he c uiimitted the wrong—b\ his message to the
two  Houses  of Cmgress, and th it, indeed, it
seems tirat, he has sul st intia'ly done     But he
cannot, in  mv   judgment, without digiadation,

Piwtrs, and our communications with them, the
Presidí nt is the nation, Iil lcpresents the whole
Republic, and it would  piLSint the case of the
whole nation, through  th  ir appiopnate organ,
apo'o? zingtoaforeignPowci for what one branch
of thr~ir Government had said of that Power in
communicating with its cioidmate branches.    It
would 1 e admitting a forLign Power to come into
our rastl , and witness the workings of the ma-
chinery ot our Government, not as a whole, but
in us several parts     It might thus put it in the
power, and mak   it the interest of foreign Gov-
ernments to loik to the  parts, rather than the
whole, in their communication and  intcicouise
with the nation, and Liidcavor to m  ke those parts
so act upon caLh othi r as to produce a result
fivorable to the wishes of the foreign Powei
Ev  rj thing that looks to this,howew r remotely,
I c  ndi mn, and 1 am pioud to see that there is a
tr 1    \mt rican spun abioid upon this sul jeet    I,
for one, could not, without the grossest incon-
sistency, entel tain an> other opinion     One of the
first, I believe the vLry fiist subject on which I
raised my voice in this Hall, «as to condemn
what I then thought, and  what I still think, a
compromitting of the national honor similar to
that which is now demanded, and which is so
properly refused
You cannot have forgotten, sir, for you were
prese nt in this Hall, and took pait in the debate

In the a t ol July 1C23 \ou cannot press this view ol the
subject too earni -ah upon th * eonsuleiation of the British
Ministry It has bearings and relations which reach beyond
the immediate question under discussion "
Does it not bear me out fully in what I said of
its analogy to the question of apology before us'
It diliersonly in this: that in the case which I
have read there was no real or supposed wrong
to be redressed, no wounded feelings to be healed,
nothing but a wish to obtain a treaty, which was
woise than worthless when thus obtained. That
blot upon our escutcheon is there, and can never
be expunged, but as it mustiemain, let ltiemain,
a solitary instance ot our national humiliation.   I
wish no President of my country, whatever be
his party, to repeat  or  imitate   it     However
divided we may be at home, when we present
ourselves abroad and to foreign nations, whether
in diplomacy or in the field, let us be seen as a
nation, one and indivisible     I am, theiefore, op-
posed  to anything like   apology addressed   to
France by the American Piesident     Let the five
millions sink, or five times its sum, if it can only
be saved by a stain upon  our national honor
But I am not foi war     There is nothing in this
contioversy.as I have already said, out of which
war can  arise, consistently with the laws and
usages of civilized nations   Theiefore, whatever
appiopnations we make for the objects named in
these lesolutions should be made without refei-
etice to this controveisy, neithei more nor less
than if it had never ansen, and 1 for one am not
disposed to dnect all the energies of the countiy
to preparations for military or naval defenses,
when there is no danger of attack, and thus to
gratify a mere fieak of fancy, or something less
innocuous—draw all the money of the countiy
from the interior, and expend it upon the sca-
boaid    But if we were in actual danger of a rup-
tuie with a foreign Power, and wished to prepare
for the contest, or if we wish to stiengthen our
hands as much as possible for any future emer-
gency, it is not ships or foits alone that would
stand us instead     Easy and expeditious means
of transferí ing our military strength from the
interior to the sea-coast, and with them munitions
of wai, so as to bring such force as may be ne-
cessary speedily to  bear  upon any one point
would be worth to us moie than all the foits that
all our funds would erect on the coast    Yes, sit,
the Chesapeake and Ohio canal, the Baltimore
and Ohio railroad, and other works of a similar
character, aie woith, as military defenses, thiee
times told.as much as then cost in fortifications
Both, to a'reasonable extent, aie necessary   But
if either should be dispensed with, as a defense
merely, it should bo the fort, and not the canal
01 railroad     And the city of New Oileans now
(though not when menaced in 1815) is defended
by a fleet of steamboats which can bear to its
defense, at any time that it is menaced, a hun-
died thousand figl '1 lg men in t me to lopel any
attack, though as sudden as the natuie of the
lakes and seas will permit to be made upon it
Theie is but one subject more that I wish to
touch, and of that I have buta few words to say.
The Senator from Missouri has called upon us
to state how we make up the thirty millions of
surplus money which gentlemen on this side of
the House have said is in, oi ought to be in, the
Tieasuiy     I will tell him how.
The Secretary of the Tieasury, in his report
to Congress at this session, (Doc. 2, page 2,)
states the amount in the Tieasury on the 1st of
January, by computation, at $18,047,598, in a
paper laid on our table a short time since, he
admits that the receipts for the last quarter have
exceeded the estimates $6,200,000, and the bank
stock which can be commanded in cash at any
time, is woith |8,500,000, making in the aggre-
gate |32,797,598 This is the amount on hand,
and the sum which the resolution pioposed at
once to appiopnate to fortifications and the Navy.
If there were real danger of war, I would do it
I would expend this, or even a much larger sum,
and I would build forts, though they might not
outlast the summer, but in the true and actual
state of our country, it is not necessary to lavish
or waste oui resources, or impoverish the inte-
rior and drain it of all its wealth, for the purpose
of sinking the money in ill-advised and ill-exe-
cuted fortifications, or permit that money to re-
main in the city banks as unexpended balances
for years to come These are my views, and I
shall be guided by them in mv votes on these
lesolutions, and such bills as may be hereafter
presented to us in pursuance of their principles.
EXPLORING THE PACIFIC.
SPEECH OF HON. JOHN REED,
OF MASSACHUSETTS,
In the House or Representatives,
May 9, 1836,
On the appropriation providing for Surveying and Explor-
ing the Pacific Ocean and South Sea .
Mr REED said he was highly gratified to hear
the gentleman from Ohio, [Mr Hamer,] who
had last spoken,and others íesiding far fiom the
ocean, in suppoi t of the projected expedition. As
a member of this House, representing those more
dnectlyand immediately interested, and having
for yeais advocated the measure, he took the
liberty to tender to those gentlemen his thanks.
Their views were liberal and statesmanlike. In
my opinion, (said Mi R ,) those gentlemen, so
fai fiom having done injustice to then own im-
mediate constituents, (as some have represented,)
have consulted their true inteiest, and I trust
their policy will be undeistood and duly appre-
ciated
All parts of our wide and extended country are
stuvnig and exciting eveiy nerve to improve the
navigation of the rivers, and to make railroads
and canals—avenues to the ocean Who at this
day calls in question the polie y of the measure 
The proposition we are now considering is a prop-
osition to follow up the same policy, and to im-
prove and extend oui intercourse and commerce
to the remotest parts of the world, and of course
all parts of the country, and the whole country,
have a common interest Owing to an infiimity
in the understandings of men, they often take so
limited a view of things as to disregard their own
interest When a public measure is proposed,
we are too apt to ask, who will show us any good >
Instead of asking that, is the pioposed measuie
beneficial to the nation—to the country' We
are too apt to question the expediency of a meas-
uie notdirectly beneficial to ouiselves, 01, rather,
because we do not perceive the benefit. Our
vision is limited to a nairow circle, but if we
would impaitially consult our understandings,
tney would te ich us that theie often exists a
mutual and close connection between inteicsts
apparently disconnected and remote, that, upon
the selfish principle ofregaiding our own interest
