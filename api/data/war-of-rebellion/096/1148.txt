CAMP OF NINTH REGIMENT FLORIDA VOLUNTEERS, January 22, 1865.

Lieutenant B. F. PARKER, Adjutant:

SIR: The undersigned, company officers of the Ninth Florida Regiment, respectfully call the attention of the commanding officer of this regiemtn to the discontent of the men of their companies, which, noticeable for some time past, is now so general as to deserve serious consideration. They give it as their opinion that the recent desertions from the regiment are mainly the result of this discontent, and that the chief causes of this state of feeling are the insufficiency of rations and the failure of the paymaster to pay the men off.
