the Goveirment pay ajust debt and ead the war, and then go
on and canvass, and censure, and impeach, whoever deserved
punishment Had he [Mi 1) ] the management of matters, he
would certainly give the gentleman a committee to his own full
hatisfaction—a committee of his own choice, and not let the
frienda of the Administration make the tepoH, because, how
ever true it might be, coming from them it would have little
i weight with the public Give thegentleman his own commit,

] As to the hire of wagons, Art was tne countiy to be told that,
bt cause neaily a thousand mihtia officers  had been employed,
and many of them ftom necessity made disbursing oiheers, this
was made a rcpioach upon the Government? Were his con
ptituentí, tobe publicly abused on the floor of Congress, foi this?
Ihebe things, if tine, do not attach to the skirts of the Govern
ment What unjust and illegal claim had been passed by the
Dt paitments? What Quartei master had been pioved guilty of
malfeasanci? Was the Government tobe held answerable for
ell the acts of these thousand militia officers? Were charges to
be publicly made here based on anonymous letteis-—anony
mou«, at ie i^t, to the House?
[Mi Wibb hete said the letteis to which he had leferred
weie not anonymous, and he had pioduced affidavits, with the
nimesof the witnesses signed to them ]
Mi D ^aidall thatmightbo so la the gentleman cany this

picned frai dulciit, he was very sure they would not be passed
J it the Department.. If the real object of the gentleman was
to pic\ ent Aauds, that was his obvious course If ins papera

m in fiom Virginia to be an upright, woithy man, who aimed
at doing just cc he never had entertained any othei opinion of
