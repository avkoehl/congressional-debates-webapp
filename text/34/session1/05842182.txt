THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
August 16,
South Carolina, [Mr. Orr,] I do not feel disposed
to take the responsibility of defeating this appro-
priation bill; but I wish the House to understand
that there are some four or five millions of dol-
lars involved in these amendments. If these
amendments go to the committee of conference
upon a general disagreement to all, a single vote
will be taken, when the committee report, upon
agreeingordisagreeingto the amendments. Now,
the committee of conference, if appointed now,
would have no indication as to what amendments
of the Senate the House desires to agree or dis-
agree to. The House is cut off from all oppor-
tunity of expressing its opinion in detail upon
them. I confess that I would rather sit all night
and Sunday until twelve o'clock, than adopt this
wholesale way of disposing of these amendments.
Mr. CAMPBELL. Does my colleague ob-
ject? I think he has had as much to do with
throwing- obstacles in the way of these appro-
friation oills as any other member of this House.
wish to know whether he objects ?
Mr. STANTON. As my colleague challenges
me to object, I do object.
Mr. CAMPBELL. Then I move to suspend
the rules.
Mr. JONES, of Tennessee. If the gentleman
from Ohio will hear me, I will propose that he
call the previous question upon these amend-
ments, and then we will have them read over, and
have a vote of the House upon them separately
without debate. It is an extraordinary course, I
know; but we are in an extraordinary condition,
and, therefore, I make the suggestion. The
House, under that course, may agree to some of
the amendments, and refer those to which it dis-
agrees to a committee of conference.
Mr. MILLSON. I am inclined to think, from
what has just passed before us, that the gentle-
man from Ohio, [Mr. Stanton,] who made objec-
tion, did not seriously intend to make objection;
but fancying that he was challenged by his col-
league to make an objection, he did so because
some little personal feeling or pride of position
was involved. I beg leave to suggest to the gen-
tleman from Ohio, who may feel disposed to make
objection to the proposed proceeding, that this
course is one exceedingly common in this Hall,
especially at this peiiod of the session; and the
gentleman will find that, while the present couise
is well calculated to save time, the difficulties
which he suggests will not be avoided by the
adoption of the mode which lie indicated just
now; for if we concur or non-concur in many
amendments of the Senate, at last all those v/jfl
be subject to the action of the committee of con-
ference, and we shall in the end be compelled to
vote upon the report of that committee as a whole.
And I suggest to the gentleman from Ohio that
we obtain a decided advantage in the conference
by objecting to all the amendments of the Senate,
for then in the committee we may recede from
a number of them, and use our disposition to
recede as a reason for urging the Senate to recede
from some of their amendments.
The SPEAKER. The motion to suspend the
rules is not debatable, unless by general consent.
Mr. STANTON. My purpose in rising before
was to indicate to the House what the result of
this mode of proceeding would be; and I did not
intend, until challenged to do so by my colleague,
to interpose any objection. I will now withdraw
my objection.
Mr. MILLSON. Then there is no objection.
The SPEAKER. The Chair understands that
there is no objection. %
Mr. FLAGLER. It will be in order, I sup-
pose, to ask for a separate vote upon any amend-
ment where it is desired *
The SPEAKER. The amendments arc to be
considered together, by tho unanimous consent of
the House, just given, as the Chair understood.
Mr. WALKER. I desire to know what will
be the effect of such an order of the House re-
ferring the amendments to a committee of confer-
ence? Will the committee be bound by the action
of the House upon the amendments ?
The SPEAKER. The whole matter will be
m the discretion of the committee of conference.
Mr. MACE. If the proposition is to disagiee
to these amendments in the aggregate, and then
refer the whole matter to a committee of confer-
ence, I object.
The SPEAKER. The motion of the gentle-
man from Ohio has been adopted by general con-
sent.
Mr. FLAGLER. We can have the amend-
ments read?
The SPEAKER. They will be read if request-
ed.
Mr. FLAGLER. I call for the reading of
them.
Mr. ORR. If the gentleman from New York
requires that the amendments shall be read, I
suppose that the House can, with the consump-
tion of but little more time, vote upon them as
they are reported by the Clerk.
Mr. CAMPBELL. If the gentleman from New
York insists upon the reading of the amendments,
I will withdraw my motion, and move the previ-
ous question upon the amendments. I wish to
know whether the gentleman insists upon his
demand ?
Mr. FLAGLER. I think that the amendments
ought to be read; but if we can have a separate
vote upon any amendments we may designate, I
am willing that the vote shall be taken in gross
upon the others.
The previous question was seconded, and the
main question was ordered.
