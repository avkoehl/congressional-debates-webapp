HEADQUARTERS SIXTH CORPS,November 29, 1863.

[Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:]

My right brigade rested very near the Raccoon road. I have moved it a short distance to the right, and it now covers the road.

JOHN SEDGWICK,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS SIXTH CORPS,November 29, 1863.

[Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:]

I think I am not mistaken in the Raccoon road. The one Mr. Barlow mentioned is the road that runs into the Raccoon. My staff officers have not yet returned, and Mr. Barlow has gone to meet them.

JOHN SEDGWICK,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS SIXTH CORPS,November 29, 1863.

[Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:]

SIR: I should like to have the general commanding or yourself to take a look at the enemy's position from this point. It cannot be more than three-quarters of a mile.

JOHN SEDGWICK,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS SIXTH ARMY CORPS,November 29, 1863.

[Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:]

There is no material change in my front. The enemy were at work last night slashing timber and working on their rifle-pits. I believe it to be impossible to take wagons to the rear except by the main road. My artillery could have come in near general headquarters.

General Wright has officers out examining further.

JOHN SEDGWICK,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS CAVALRY CORPS,November 29, 1863-2 p. m.

[Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:]

SIR: There is no truth in the report about our wagon train 2 miles from here having been attacked. I have just heard from Old Wilderness. The enemy's cavalry appear to be making for Ely's Ford. Our troops there have been notified.

A. PLEASONTON,

Major-General, Commanding.
