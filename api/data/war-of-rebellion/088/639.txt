The major-general commanding consents to the substitution of General Crawford's division for that of General Ayres. The commander of the infantry will not have charge of the operation, which is necessarily intrusted to General Gregg, but will support the cavalry. The commanding general requests that you will see that the directions for the movements of the infantry are conveyed to the new commander.
