cite no instances of individual gallantry for fear of doing injustice to others equally brave. I know not the extent of damage inflicted on the enemy by our artillery. If we committed and errors we trust we may be afforded an opportunity in future to rectify them.

Very respectfully,

Captain, Commanding Battery.

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.

AUGUST 6, 1863.- Capture and Recapture of Sutlers' Wagons near Fairfax Court-House. Va.

Report of Brigadier General Rufus King, U. S. Army.

CENTREVILLE, VA.,

August 7, 1863.

COLONEL: A party of cavalry, reported 100 strong, approached Accotink Bridge last night; was discovered by our pickets, and immediately left. All is quiet along the railroad. A number of sutlers and sutlers' teams were captured last evening by a party of 40 or 50 guerrillas, 2 of 3 miles the other side of Fairfax Court-House. A portion of the Twelfth Illinois Cavalry lying in the vicinity, hearing the alarm, immediately gave chase, and succeeded in recapturing all, or nearly all, of the prisoners and stolen property.

RUFUS KING,

Brigadier-General.

Colonel J. H. TAYLOR,

AUGUST 7, 1863.- Affair at Burke's Station, Va.

Report of Brigadier General Herman Haupt, U. S. Army.

ALEXANDRIA DEPOT, VA.,

August 8, 1863.

GENERAL: Last night an attack was made 1 mile east of Burke's on our railroad forces, employed in cutting wood. We were so fortunate as to have the guard which your ordered at my request. The enemy, finding a force prepared to resist them, fired a few shots and retired. We had about 60 men, with twenty-five four-horse teams and drivers, and all of them would have been captured, but for the guard. The enemy appeared to consist of dismounted cavalry; number about 25.

H. HAUPT.

Major-General HEINTZELMAN.
