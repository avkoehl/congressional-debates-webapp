De Glaize road and beat you to Evergreen. Mouton's brigade is en route for Evergreen to unite with you. Polignac's brigade will reach here to-morrow and be pushed to Lecompte. Try and obtain as correct an estimate as possible of the enemy's strength, and whether he comes from down the river or not. The line of couriers from here to the Teche passes on the Boeuf, thus you can communicate from Evergreen or vicinity by Huffpower. If the fort is not tenable at all for the garrison it should not be sacrificed, but as re-enforcements are coming forward the delay of a few days would be of incalculable advantage to the cause. This will be carried down by the Frolic, which I have detained for the purpose. I suppose you have the light artillery which was on the river below the fort with you; if not, remove it either with you or to this point. The Countess, Frolic, and Dixie can doubtless bring off everything not required for the fort. A dispatch from Vincent of the 11th reports no movement at that date. Thus we have only the force in your front for the present. Try and obtain as correct estimate as possible of this, for if not too large we may defeat it before Banks gets up from below. In this view the holding of De Russy for a few days becomes of vast importance. Unless I hear from you something to prevent, I shall join you by the Huffpower as soon as I clear this place of all Government stores and make the necessary arrangements regarding my whole command.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. TAYLOR,

Major-General.

HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF WEST LOUISIANA, Alexandria, March 15, 1864.

Major-General WALKER,Commanding Division:

GENERAL: Yours of 4 p. m. just received. If the fort has fallen when you receive this, or it is certain that it will fall, march to Lecompte at once, leaving a few mounted men to observe if the enemy follow you. You can in the event of moving to Lecompte send back word to Gray and Polignac, who is marching from here to-day. I have depots between Lecompte and Natchitoches and I shall make for the latter place. We can come out at Cotile or McNutt's if we wish, or Red River, or continue to Natchitoches. I leave this in half an hour to join you.

R. TAYLOR,

Major-General.
