Sixteenth Kentucky Veteran Infantry, One hundred and twelfth Illinois Volunteer Infantry, and One hundredth Ohio Volunteer Infantry, being in front line of the brigade, passed up the slope over the crest and the rifle-pits without a perceivable halt in their lines more than was unavoidable from the character of the ground. The front line of the brigade moved to crest of ridge immediately in front of the enemy's batteries, located in their second line of works. The brigade, particularly the first line, was exposed to a very severe fire of musketry and canister, after passing first line of enemy's pits, while advancing to second crest and during the greater portion of the time they held the position. The second line of brigade (the Eighth Tennessee Volunteer Infantry and One hundred and fourth Ohio Volunteer Infantry) advancing to the first line of enemy's rifle-pits, the command was here halted, the front and second line occupying the respective positions as herein stated, which were held by the brigade until relieved by a portion of the Fourth Army Corps a short time before dark, some of the regiments not being relieved until the dark of the evening. After brigade was halted the Eighth Tennessee Volunteer Infantry was moved from second line into position on the left of brigade, to protect the flank, which was exposed at that time. In the charge upon the first line of pits, in moving up to second crest and while holding that position, the brigade lost in killed and wounded as follows: Killed, enlisted men, 12; wounded, commissioned officers, 4; enlisted men, 129; missing, 9. Among the many brave men wounded I regret to say is Colonel Thomas J. Henderson, of One hundred and twelfth Illinois Infantry, slightly; Captain Wright, of said regiment, severely; Captain Pumpelly, Sixteenth Kentucky Veteran Infantry, severely, and Lieutenant Laurie, of said regiment, mortally (since dead). Some 3 to 5 prisoners were taken in first line of rebel rifle-pits and sent to rear. After being relieved the brigade was moved with the balance of division some three-quarters of a mile to rear and bivouacked for the night. May 15, the brigade, with division, moved this morning to a position on left of army near railroad, and in flank and rear of Twentieth Corps. No part of the brigade was engaged during the day other than in constructing protection for themselves in case of attack. The lines were constructed during the day and evening.

The officers and men of the whole command, with two exceptions, reported by Colonel Reeve, Eighth Tennessee Volunteer Infantry, faithfully and gallantly performed their duties during the time herein mentioned, more particularly at the battle of Resaca, where all seemed to vie with each other in pushing forward and encouraging their respective commands. I would respectfully call attention to the reports of regimental commanders herewith submitted.

A statement of casualties in the brigade is hereto appended.* A detailed statement was forwarded soon after the battle of Resaca.

I would be doing injustice should I neglect to honorably mention the members of my staff--Lieutenant James Coughlan, aide-de-camp; Lieutenant E. E. Tracy, inspector and aide-de-camp, and J. Walter McClymonds, acting assistant adjutant-general--all of whom cheerfully performed their duties efficiently and promptly, rendering all the assistance that could be expected of any officers in their position, and at the battle of Resaca exposing themselves at all times on the line in the performance of their duty, where occasionally destruction seemed almost inevitable.
