BATTLE CREEK, July 25, 1862.

Colonel J. B. FRY, Huntsville:

I don't believe a word of it. None had crossed Wednesday at 11 p.m. I have men watching and will know in eight or ten hours if such a thing be possible. Nelson wishes you to know that he liveth. They are going to make a move soon, pressing wagons, &amp;c., I believe, to Dalton or Atlanta.

McCOOK,

General.
HEADQUARTERS,Huntsville, July 25, 1862.

General SCHOEPF, Decatur:

March your brigade on Winchester via Huntsville. Make fair marches, though not to crowd the men so as to leave stragglers. Preserve good order. Bring all the provisions you can carry. Buy your forage on the route and see that your quartermaster does this in a regular way.

(Operator at Decatur send copy of this to General Thomas at Tuscumbia.)

BATTLE CREEK, July 25, 1862.

Colonel J. B. FRY:

One of my men left Chattanooga last evening after dusk. I have Atlanta papers of the 24th. The rebels say they will have 40,000 there in eighteen days. Orders have been issued not to ship any more freight on the State road in order to pass them. None had crossed the river at 10 last night. They have been clearing out the Anderson road, and 1,000 men were to have crossed yesterday, but did not do so. On Wednesday 18 wagons and yesterday 40 head of horses and mules went over to them. Reports say that orders were issued yesterday to cross a force to-day; how many not known. The general talk is they are going to make a campaign to Middle Tennessee. I will watch them.

McCOOK,

General.

As soon as you are satisfied the country is clear of rebel cavalry concentrate your force at Murfreesborough. It is desirable for you to do so as soon as possible. Ac-knowledge receipt.
