information possible concerning Sheridan, and if he hears of the capture of any prisoners to ascertain whether they are being sent up, and assist in getting them here. If Mosby is found to be where he can be reached the general desires him to be attacked. The commander will, of course, understand the need of great caution while on the march. Unless Cedar Creek is not fordable the general would like to have the command go down as far as Edenburg. They should be supplied with two days' rations for the men and two days' forage.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

C. H. MORGAN,

Brevet Brigadier-General, Chief of Staff.

Commissary General of Prisoners, Washington, D. C.:

I send about 1,400 rebel prisoners, officers and men, Sheridan's capture, to Baltimore this morning; will arrive there this evening. Have arrangements made to relieve my guard on arrival and returned, as General Hancock has use for the troops.

I send by train to-day 1,333 enlisted men and 62 officers, rebel prisoners, captured by General Sheridan.

The train will arrive at Baltimore about 7 o'clock this evening.

Respectfully,

JOHN D. STEVENSON,
