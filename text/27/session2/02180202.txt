So the resolutions werejaidontl etabie
Mr ADAM^ said the evidence was exceedingly important,
and he must confess when he saw the votes on the resolutions
asking for that information, which would not be denied to the
vilest villain 10. the land, that it bore on him m a heavy it anner
aa to what he wa= to expect from. tV votes of the same party
hereafter He thanked again the Hon*e for allowing him a
portion of uiat i ¡formation which he had reques ed, hut he
thought it ntces<=ary once moro to put the n embers of the
House m mind of the position which they occupied now, and
which he occupied He would readoace more an extiact from
a report made by a gentleman from Soutu Carolina on a lor
mer occasion, of the proceedings of this Hojse in regard to a
violation of its rules, which was rea Í the othei day by tre Clerk,
but amidst so much i oníusion lie wa3 afraid it was not heard by
many of the members
One of the grounds he shou d take for his own defence would
be, that he had been, neither by himself nor by the petitioners
whjse petition he had mtaonttd, gui ty oí any o^enct- against
tfee laws of the land whats ev^i and tha* so fax aa leUted to
this, he wm un ier ro it p > isibiLi y hmng declared at the
time he presented the [ tution and i ptati ¡g n >w, that their
petition was the last thing ¡i the w ild ho would evei \  te to
grant And he hopxl hatha should De ah e to show that for
attachment to this  Union, he misht out sixty 01 --event) years
of public lift b Mrc almos all ucm&indin pioof Ii th^re w is 
one membu of this House who had given moie s long more
clear and unequ'vocal prooN of attichment to the Union of
these fctatcs than the man who now stood charged Aiih truno
before this Hou<=e, j$. did not klow who that man w^s Ho
hoped to be allowed to prove that to this líoiw
He said then, so taras respected his own nt which was tht,
presentatiun i f the petition here bti re this 1Í u<=e and m
presenceof h s God, he did it under acense of itren issible
duty At the last session of Congress he heard a gieat de 1 in
the subject of wn it was to be ctl owed to tht toi science of
the Preaiuent oí ihe United * ¿tes Ho was n ip of those who
fully allowed him the benefit of the dictates of hia conscience
in every thing he did, and he now ctai led, before ti lb
House and the countiy, the right to have a conscience as well
as he                                                                                      *,
He satd, further, that this was no new thins to this House
and this countiy líe had been now ten veaii  successively a
Representative of a portion oí the peo¡ ie of the fimmmi

having met m conclave, and having been pxepaied to foros  c

fence Wa3 there evei such a thing done before? There was
*>uch a cambiuation—he had exposed what the nature of it was
some days ago—of parties, as had never before been seen m this
House, meetmg in a dungeon here, and determining tnat they
would expel him or pass the strongest poss>ble ctnsure upon
him, and then i resolution prepared by one of the members of
that conclave, eputng on h n so thatf he moment the eentleman
had done, the bpeakei told h in that the question would be on
the adoption of the resolution
The SPEAKFTl here said that he had, on a formei day, an
noui ced to the gentleman from Massachusetts that the quest on
would be on the aioption of the resolu ion, unless he or some
rrieid moved its pos poneme^t and that he had intimated this
to the gentlemar solely for the purpose that he might under
stand, without doubt, what his rights m the premises were
Mr AHAM^ said he was willing to receive the correction
He had understood the Senator to eay that if the gentleman
from Massachusetts had any thing to «ay, then was the time, for
the question would be on the adoption of the it=o!umn This
was a matter of vci y little consequence He did not intend o
say that the Speakei desired many mannei to debar him fiom
his rights as a member of this House But he asked again,
had there ever been, since the fonndati >n of this Government,
in this Hall or in any deliberative body, such a process"*

vindication of the d'gn ty of the House that its power shotild
sometimes be exeicr-ed, it «hould be done only m cases of strong
necessity, and never earned beyond what was absolutely re
quired by the existing emergencies It cannot be forgotten, too,
that in these proceedings the House lslawmakci, accuser, wit
ness/andjudge, in its own cause And,should ltpronounee a
sentence of expulsion, it could not be reversed It was the
final doom, and, before bem  pronounced it should be made
mosttaiefuily, and be found indispensably necessary ]
One particular to which he (Mr A ) had refened was, that,
in addition to the compound character of law maker, accuser,
witness, judge, and executioner here was that of a party in se
cret conclave, worse than that of the Venitian Inquisition, pre
pannga proposition before *he measuie was biought into the
House
He asked of the House such time as it might think pi oper in
its own msdom to allow, for opportunity to obtain the lrfor
