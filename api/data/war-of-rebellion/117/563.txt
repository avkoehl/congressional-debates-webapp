HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE OHIO,September 26, 1862.

General BRAXTON BRAGG, Commanding Confederate Forces.

GENERAL: I have the honor to inform you that under the cartel for exchange of prisoners I have restored to duty Brigadier General R. W. Johnson, Lieutenant Tyler A. Mason, quartermaster Thirteenth Indiana Battery, and Captain Turner, assistant adjutant-general, and request that you will inform me of the release you may think proper to make in exchange for these persons in accordance with the terms of the cartel.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

D. C. BUELL,

Major-General, Commanding.

COLUMBUS, OHIO, September 26, 1862.

Honorable E. M. STANTON:

Do not send any more paroled prisoners here. It is impossible to do anything with those now in Camp Chase. They generally refuse to be organized or do any duty whatever. Every detachment that arrives only swells a mob already dangerous. The Eastern troops are particularly disinclined to the Indian service. Let me have time to do something with those now on hand before the task thickens.

LEW. WALLACE,

Major-General.

ADJUTANT-GENERAL'S OFFICE, September 26, 1862.

Major-General McCLELLAN,

Headquarters of the Army of the Potomac:

Please send me a list of the rebel prisoners captured and paroled by you on the Peninsula. I shall need it soon in considering exchanges.

L. THOMAS,

Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,September 26, 1862.

General L. THOMAS, Adjutant-General:

Major Wood, acting provost-marshal-general, reports that so far as he know none of the prisoners captured on the Peninsula were paroled. Lists of the captured prisoners were forwarded to your office. Duplicates can be furnished if necessary.

GEO. B. McCLELLAN,

Major-General, Commanding.

CRAWFORDSVILLE, IND., September 26, 1862.

General L. THOMAS, Washington City.

SIR: I was taken prisoners by the enemy on the 30th of August at the battle of Richmond, Ky., and paroled on the 1st instant. I reported to you from Paris, Ky., on the 4th instant. I have not yet received any orders from your office. I am exceedingly anxious to be exchanged. The official reports of that battle will I think show that I did my whole duty.

Very respectfully,

M. D. MANSON,

Brigadier-General, U. S. Volunteers.
