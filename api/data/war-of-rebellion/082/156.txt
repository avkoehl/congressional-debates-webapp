3. All packages containing liquors and wines ordered by an officer shall be turned over to the officer ordering the same within twenty-four hours after reaching the point of delivery, * * * and be kept by such officer in his own private quarters or tent. A longer detention of the liquor by the sutler shall be regarded as evidence of his keeping the same for sale, and subject him to the penalties of the law and existing orders attached to such offense.

7. The attention of the commanding general has been called to the abuses likely to arise in the employment, as authorized, of agents for supplying the wants of officers. Unless this privilege is properly enjoyed and officers are careful not to give their names except in cases where the article is in reality for their immediate personal use, and unless officers exercise some discretion in the amount and number of supplies sent for, the commanding general will be obliged to withdraw the privilege altogether and compel officer to look to sutlers alone.

* * * * *

9. The following decision, given at these headquarters on 2nd of June last, is now published for the guidance of all concerned:

The agents provided for in paragraph 3 of General Orders, No. 78 of August 20, 1863, must be one of the regular appointed sutlers or some person properly connected with his stablishment. As there are from fifteen to twenty sutlers in each division, the commanding general directs that the number shall not be increased. Generals of division, brigades, and corps can designate one sutler already attached to some organization in their commands for the purpose of supplying whatever is wanted for headquarters.

By command of Major-General Meade:

S. WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
