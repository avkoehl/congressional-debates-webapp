unable to give a more detailed account of the action of this day. Our loss during this engagement was 16 killed and 35 wounded; of the latter 6 are known to have since died. Among those who particularly distinguished themselves for gallantry on this occasion I have to mention the following: Captain Edward A. Irvin (severely wounded), Captain A. E. Niles, Adjt. William R. Hartshorne, Lieuts. James M. Welch, Lucius Truman, S. A. Mack, Jr. (wounded), N. B. Kinsey, David G. McNaughton., and Sergt. Major Roger Sherman. I felt great reluctance in singling out individuals, as the officers and men on this occasion behaved most gallantly.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

DENNIS McGEE,

Captain, Commanding First Rifles,

HDQRS. 1ST RIFLES, PENNSYLVANIA RESERVE VOL. CORPS,September 22, 1862.

COLONEL: I have to report that the First Rifles, under the command of Colonel Hugh W. McNeil, was, about 4 p. m. of the 16th instant, ordered by General Seymour to deploy as skirmishers and ascertain the enemy's position. Four companies were immediately deployed, the remaining six, under command of Lieutenant Welch, held in reserve. The whole advance moved forward steadily but cautiously for about three-quarters of a mile, when the enemy's pickets were discovered extending in a line across a plowed field in front of a large strip of woods, in which a large body were masked. They at once opened upon us a raking fire from the infantry, which was replied to, the reserve of our regiment being at once called to the support of our skirmishers. No sooner had we formed a line of battle than we were opened upon by two batteries, one upon our right, with grape and canister, the other on our left, throwing shell. After remaining in this position some fifteen minutes Colonel McNeil gave the order to charge and drive the enemy from the woods. Gallantly placing himself in the advance, he led the command to within a few paces of the woods, when he fell, pierced to the heart by a rifle-ball. Still we did not pause, but drove the enemy from the woods and maintained the position during the night, re-enforcements having come to our assistance. As soon as daylight appeared on the following morning (the 17th instant) the enemy again opened upon us. We remained in our position until our ammunition was expended, when, relieved by another regiment, we were ordered to fall back to supply ourselves afresh with ammunition. About 12 o'clock we were again ordered to the front, but were not brought into action. Our loss during this battle was 6 killed, among whom was Colonel McNeil and Lieutenant William Allison; 23 wounded, including 2 officers, Lieutenants Welch and Bell. We also lost in missing 10 men, of whom nothing has since been learned. I cannot speak too highly of the conduct of the officers and men on this occasion, and feel unwilling to make a distinction.

I have the honor to be, colonel, your obedient servant,

DENNIS McGEE,

Captain, Commanding First Rifles.

Colonel R. BIDDLE ROBERTS,

Commanding First Brigade.
