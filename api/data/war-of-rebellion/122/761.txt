to decrease the number of officers and thus proportionably diminish the expenses of the Army. As the recruiting will be done as heretofore by volunteer officers, it is believed that a sufficient number of men will be obtained from time to time to meet the requirements of the service. This Department fully appreciates the ability and energy displayed by the authorities of the State of New York, and will not, whenever occasion requires, hesitate to avail itself of their services. It cannot, however, consent to rescind the portions of the order designated, inasmuch as it is deemed desirable to bring all recruiting accounts under the control of the proper officers, with a view to their speedy settlement whenever necessary.

I am, Governor, with high respect, your obedient servant,

SIMON CAMERON,

Secretary of War.

Honorable THOMAstant Secretary of War:

Lewis and Murray not here, and James gone home. I have ordered the regiments to go once more. I could send Gregory, who is full, and a regiment from Camp Curtin. I expect to be in Washington tomorrow evening. As I have not long to stay, would be obliged if you will offer me the facilities in your power to transact my business. We can look over all these affairs. Answer.
