HEADQUARTERS EIGHTEENTH ARMY CORPS,July 1, 1864. (Received 11.02 a.m.)

General RAWLINS,

Chief of Staff:

Quite a conflagration was observed last night in Petersburg, probably caused by our shells. General Weitzel telegraphs me as follows this morning, and I think he is correct in his supposition:

Eight car-loads of troops, apparently dressed in blue uniforms, have just passed to Petersburg. Is it not possible that these are our men to be put there to prevent the shelling of the city?

WM. F. SMITH,

Major-General.
