HEADQUARTERS FOURTH ARMY CORPS,Near Pine Top Knob, Ga., June 13, 1864 - 12.10 a. m.

Major-General THOMAS:

GENERAL: A report dated June 12.10 p. m., of which the following is a copy, has just been received here:

The officer in command of pickets reports the enemy his column at this hour. The movements seems from rebel left to right and about the Pine Top. Their commands can be plainly heard, such as "Bring your column this way," &amp;c. The rebels have built quite large fires on Pine Top. Their picket-line is still maintained, and fire occasionally.

D. S. STANLEY,

Major-General of Volunteers.

HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,Big. Shanty, June 13, 1864 - 3.40 a. m.

Major General O. O. HOWARD,

Commanding Fourth Army Corps:

GENERAL: Your note has been received. Should the enemy mean a night attack on you all that can be done is to hold yourself in readiness. Should he mean to attack McPherson's left and get around his left flank at our wagon train, which is probably his other object, you will hold yourself in readiness to move to the left to Moon's Station. At the same time, at the first signal of activity in the rebel lines, yourself and General Hooker will open heavy with artillery on the enemy and push for Pine Hill. Major-General Sherman informs us that the enemy has had his cavalry feeling well in the space between McPherson's (Blair's) left and Garrard's.

By command of Major-General Thomas:

WM. D. WHIPPLE,

Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,Big Shanty, June 13, 1864.

Major General J. M. PALMER,

Commanding Fourteenth Army Corps:

GENERAL: General Stanley reports, through Major-General Howard, that the enemy is moving his column from the rebel left to the rebel right this night. You will, therefore, hold yourself in readiness for a night attack from them, or, should they be preparing for daylight, their design is on McPherson's left and around his left flank at our wagon train, which can be seen so plainly near these headquarters. You will hold your corps ready to move to the left to Moon's Station, to which point their Fourth Corps will also be ordered to move should it become evident that such is the design of the enemy.

By command of Major-General Thomas;

WM. D. WHIPPLE,

Chief of Staff.
