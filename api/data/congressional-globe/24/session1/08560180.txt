APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

24th Cong....1st Sess.
The Land Bill—Surplus Revenue—Mr. Hill.
Senate.
place tinder the compromise act of 1833.* That
reduction, admitting all the calculations and an-
ticipations of ihe íeport to be correct, would,
after the year 1842, leave but a sm;\ll sum to be
divided; and when it is considered that, while
the whole amount of imports has for some years
been increasing, that portion of imports paying
dutifs has been diminishing: and that the actual
consumption in the United States of such foreign
merchandise as pays duties, is little more than
one third of the whole value of our imports, no
impartió! ,md prudent statesman, on a calculation
of the ordinary risk of depression in trade, or of
the casualties incident to relations between dif-
ferent Governments, would have found it in his
heart to recommend that ways and means should
be found for the division of a surplus revenue.
May it not be safe to calculate, as the Secretary
of the Treasury has calculated, that the biennial
reduction of $1,000,000, in the rates under the
last tariff, will not be made up by the increased
quantity, when it is officially ascertained that the
annual increase of consumption of foreign mer-
chandise has not equaled the annual increase of
population ?
The Senator has said, in substance, the esti-
mates since the commencement of the present
Administration have been a series of blunders;
that the present Secretary has been so incorrect,
that he places no reliance upon them. A recur-
rence to all the estimates from the year 1802 up
to the present time, will show that the recent
calculations have been much more accurate than
they were formerly. At the same time it must
be admitted that the credit system extending from
ten months to two years after the duties were
secured, furnished data for more accurate calcu-
lations than the present system of cash pay-
ments.

Mr. Calhoun before the production of that report by the

lished with the other documents.

Whatever may be the faults of the present
heads of Departments, it will not be urged that
they present themselves as rival and conflicting
aspirants for a still higher place than they now
occupy. Or if perchance any one of them looks
for advancement, it is through an honest and
faithful discharge of his public duty, and not in
virtue of the "line of saf«; precedents." The
eight years subsequent to the last war with Great
Britain was marked,I believe, by John Randolph,
ns the Administration which, at its second term,
" came in unanimously, and went out unani-
mously." The President of that day might mean
well; but the Administration was not his own.
The State Department was grubbing its way to
the Presidency on a sectional contest in favor of
northern principles and northern predilections.
The War attempted to force itself into the public
favor by its " growing and excessive patronage"
—by " great and extravagant expenditures"—by
patting on the back every man who would do its
work, and by butchering in cold blood every
other man who discovered a scintilla of independ-
ence. The Treasury was also of the candidates:
it had all the real democracy which the amalga-
mating policy of an Administration without any
definite political character had left in most of the
States; but it was weakened much in the North
from the circumstance that many of the old Feder-
alists pretended (as they have since pretended to
General Jackson) to support that, rather than, the
northern pretender by whom they have been be-
trayed. This was the state of things: three candi-
dates for the Presidency in the Cabinet,and another
contending for the palm as premier of the House of
Representatives. The battle was fought as if the
politicians here, and not the people at home, were
to make the President. The principal candidates
had each his newspaper in this city to advocate his
claims. The War Department, for several years,
as if determined to carry the question by a coitp
dc main, went on the high-pressure principle, till at
length a demonstration on Pennsylvania discov-
ered it could neither carry that nor probably any
other State of the Union; when, making a virtue
of necessity, at the eleventh hour, it yields its
pretensions in favor of General Jackson, whom
it sees carrying everything by the people which
it had the presumption to claim for itself. I have
been thus particular in stating this controversy,
because it involved a scene in the Cabinet of those
times which we may hope never to see acted
again—a scene in which the patronage of office,
and of emoluments, and of contracts, in one De-
partment at least, were directed to promote the
election of a man to the first office in the Govern-
ment who had no hold upon the people, and who
could not, with all that patronage, command a
single vote—a scene in which every public man
was assailed and sacrificed who would not min-
ister to the most greedy pretender—a scene in
which the "public morals were corrupted and
degraded to the lowest ebb."
During the last session of Congress, a Senator
charged on the Post Office Department " rotten-
ness and " corruption," and " abominable vio-
lations of trust;" and then said we " must have
reform, or we must have revolution." During
the present session, the same Senator has charged
on the friends of the Administration that they
are the "parasites of power," of the "spoils
party," and made use of other epithets equally
odious. Now, sir, it is a common and a true
saying—that " evil thinketh he who evil doeth."
If corruption and rottenness exist in any depart-
ment of this Government, the diseased part can-
not be too soon taken away, whether it be neces-
sary to apply the cautery or the knife. I will
refer to, or recapitulate a few of the abuses, the
"unwarranted exercises of executive power,"
under a former Administration, and leave it with
the people to judge whether, if reform has not
thoroughly done its work, finding it impossible
to do all things at once, the evils that are left will
not, many of them, be referred back to a time
when the Senator himself was a part of the exist-
ing Administration.
At the commencement of the year 1817, the
Army of the United States, in the aggregate,
amounted to ten thousand and twenty-four men.
There were recruited in that year three thousand
nine hundred and thirty-nine; in 1618, four thou-
sand two hundred and thirty-eight; in 1819, four
thousand three hundred and four; in the three
years, twelve thousand four hundred and eighty-
one. But at the close of the year 1819, the Army
amounted to eight thousand six hundred and
eighty-eight; les3 than the aggregate at the com-
mencement of the year 1817, one thousand three
hundred and thirty-six, this number added to
twelve thousand four hundred and eighty-one,
the number recruited, amounts to thirteen thou-
sand eight hundred and seventeen men lost to the
Army, mostly by desertion, in the space of three
years.
In this state of things, tho Secretary of Wa,
(Calhoun) called on Congress for an appropria-
tion of $183,925, for the recruiting service of 1820.
The House of Representatives paid so little atten-
tion to the Secretary's estimates as to appropriate
no more than $34,125 for the whole recruiting
service of that year. The House of Represent-
atives particularly specified the number to be
raised by the words, "forbounties and premiums;
for fifteen hundred recruits." Yet, in violation of
this law, and, as was said, " to keep in pay near
seven hundred commissioned officers," the Sec-
retary recruited three thousand two hundred and
eleven instead of fifteen hundred men, and ex-
pended for the recruiting service $66,398 22,
instead of $34,125. And when called on to account
for the expenditure beyond the law, the Adjutant
General reported that the money had been made
up from the balance of old appropriations, which
balances were not in the Treasury. One of these
balances was for " amount due Robert Brent, late
' Paymaster General, being part of the advance
' made him on account of bounties and premiums
' out of the appropriation of 1816, refunded in
' 1820, on settlement of his account, $35,364 56,"
respecting which it was expressly stated by the
Second Auditor that it " ought not to be under-
stood that he refunded that sum in money; he
refunded it in settlement of account only."
I would also refer to Document No. 99, of the
first session of the Twenty-First Congress, for
examples of executive legislation by the Secre-
tary of War, by which the pay and emoluments
of sundry officers of the Army were enormously
increased at several times by a simple order,
sometimes subscribed in pencil by the initials of
that officer. The pay and emoluments were
increased in a manner which the law never con-
templated. The legislation of the Secretary was
always quite laconic; it ran in this manner:
" Until otherwise ordered, the chief engineer,
' while resident in Washington, will be allowed
' at the rate of nine hundred dollars a year, in
' lieu of fuel and quarters. He will also receive
' double rations.                         J. C. Calhoun.
".Voy 12, 1818."
" You will instruct the paymaster of the corps
' of engineers at West Point, to pay the super-
' intendent of the Military Academy at that post
' triple rations from the 1st of September last,
' until further orders.                J. C. Calhoun.
" October 16,1820."
" Does the command of the corps of engineers
' entitle Major Worth to brevet pay and emolu-
*  merits ? A battalion of infantry consists of three
*  hundred and forty men.
" answer. The command of Major Worth is
' equal to his brevet rank, and his payas such is
'allowed.                                     J. C. Calhouw.
"January 6, 1821."
" The quartermaster general, commissary gen-
' eral of subsistence, the colonel of engineers,
* and the chief of the ordnance department, while
' stationed at the seat of Government, will be
' allowed double rations from this date.
««J. C. Calhoun.
"July 27,1821."
" In the absence of the chief of staff bureaus,
' the allowance of double rations will devolve on
' the officer having charge in their absence.
"J. C. Calhock.
"June 4,1822."
The speoial decisions of the Secretary of War,
allowing officers of the Army extra pay and emol-
uments, nowhere to be found authorized in any
law of Congress, are numerous in the document
1 have referred to. A decision in one case has
been held tobe a rule in all similar caaes; and by
