ma, and I have some time since tluown off the robes of the bar
But I had supposed that there was one great statute in the
books, which lay at the threshold of all legal knowledge in the
United States, and that no man m this countiy could gam ad
mission into the temple of justice, as a minister there, without
beai ing that statute m his hond I refer to the judiciary act of
1789, in the 2oth section of which express provision is made foi
the transfer of precisely such cases as this fiom the courts of
the Spates to tho=e of the United States And as to the power to
entei a noUe prosequi, I appeal to any and every lawyer on
this floor to ¡say whether this pown does not belong to the law
officer of the Government, accoidmg to the e-tablished practice
of every nibunal,lughor low, thicughom the tinned States
But in the socond place the gentleman and his friends, while
they seem to admit that upon the main point m controversy
the pwnciplesof the Secretary ol ¡state, as developed in his
letter to Mr Pox, are substantially conect, yet fasten upon the
letter of i struction to Mi Crittenden as the gi eat cause of
(omplamt, they seem to admit that, so fai as regards Cheat
lintdin, i( the two letteib had gone together, m point of date,
they would have constituteil the satisfactory answei to that Go
vcrnment, but that the letter to Mr Crittenden, standing by
itself da ed on the lo h March is a concession to England in
lact, while the lettei 10 Mr I ox w v= but i denial of concession
in lorm, and that the visit of Mi CiMendtnm New\orkwas
an act of mteifeiente with the tubunaU of th it ¡state on the
part of the Fedcial Government f state th*1 e objections thus

Sir, it remains only that I briefly touch one othet subject in
conclusion of the lemarka which I had contemplated subout-
ting to the House The gentleman from Pennsylvania puts.
to us very emphatically the supposed dilemma in which the
United States would be involved either way, whether the Su-
preme Court of New York shall oven ule thcp'eaof McLeod
and send him to his trial at bar, or whether, on the other hand,
that court shall decide on the sui render of McL°od I have said
already, and I repeat, that! will not ie aigue at length that
pan ol this case which has been discus=ed in the Senate, and I
touch upon nnowoniysofaras maybe lequtsite to the com
pletene-s of my reply to the gentlemen fiom Pennsylvania X
could not but be amused to hear that gentleman lamenting 
with such interesting sadness, the omission of Mr Webster to
copy the language of Mr Monroe in the message quoted by
him (or lather of Mi Adams, whose woids they were,) mmak.
ingstatementofthe pnnciples which giaie the foreign policy
o! the United ¡states Now it so happen- that, m the mrst nn
portantand mateual part of his lettei to Mr EoX, Mr Webster,
anxious to be light, and to be light in accordance with those
principles of our foicign policy which time and authority ha\ e
sanctified, d es follow the precise language oi one of the most
celelnatedof the State papéis of Mi Monroe Hwt let lhat
pass The question is, whether the United States are in-
volved many uikmma, which human loiecasi could have:
pi evented
Mi Po\ demands the immediate release of McLeod, to this
Mr Webstei replies that that is impobsible, McLeod is hi the
hands ol the law and by th it law only can he be discharged
It is not for the United States tu loose his bonds by any sum-
mary mteiposion on their pan His arrest, imprisonment, and
trial, must take then course in the couitB of the State of New-
York, oi (in cei lam contingencia) ot the United States Th«
United States area Government of constitutional and limited
power, and it is perfectly well understood at the present day,
as= a point of international law, that constitutional Governments
cannot and will not interpose, arbitrarily, to change the course
of municipal justice, for the satisfaction of any grievance, real
oi supposed, of a f reign power Tf is principle has been re
cognised by England herself, in a most celebrated case In ih&
reign of Queen Anne, the tzai Peter, of Muscovy, being ag-
gneved by an injury done m Lnaland to his Ambassador, An-
drew Mattueof, sent to dema d rediess, and this in the peremp 
tory form of a thieat of instant wai if that rediess were not
granted But the Queen's Government most nobly replied that
sne could not grant the rediess demanded, because it involved a
violation of the law of the land, and that she could do nothing
implicating the rights, though it wcie of the meanest of her sub-
lects un is-, wauanted by the law of tlie land The Govern
ment oí 1 ogland was one of constitution and laws, not of arbi-
rdr> poweis To the same eiiect, and with still greater reason,
doas the Government of the United States say, in the present
(ase, that we cannot lawfully, and therefore, even if otherwise
disposed, we will not undeitake, by aibitiary interference, to
arrest the constitutional action of the laws in the State of
^ew York For if Q,ueen Annewas bound by the law of the
land, how much more strctly is not the President of tha
United States restrained within the limits of the Tederal Con-
stitution i
But in certain contingencies the Federal Government doae
contemplate the liberation of McLeod as a thing to happen in
the coarse of law He may be ined by aiuiy and found not
guilty of participation in the aitack on the Caroline That is
one possibility i ml the gentleman from Pennsylvania is alto-
geth< r to i quick to dec de that question u ion his own impei-
lect 1 now'edge of the fn ts Mr Allan Mc> ib, for instance,
\v* i-s positively tint McLeod was not present Then a juiv,
though u t-hiuld find him to have been peoent m the attack,
yet may give Vilm the benefit oí his plea inju^ rficauon,ashap*
peued in the great revoiutiona.iy case of Pie;,ton3s ttial m Bos-

of that plea i i this prehmui try stajje of the trnl Oi the casa
may tmd us way into the Supreme Court f the Vmud ht&tee,,
