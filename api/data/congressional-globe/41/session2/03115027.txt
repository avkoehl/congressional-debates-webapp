The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator from
California objects, and the Secretary will re-
sume the reading of the Journal.
The Secretary resumed the reading of the
Journal.
Mr. CASSERLY. I withdraw the objection
to dispensing with the reading of the Journal.
The VICE PRESIDENT. 1Â£ there be no
further objection the reading or the Journal
will be dispensed with. The Chair hears no
objection, and it is dispensed with.
FUR-BEARING ANIMALS.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Chair, under
the twenty-fourth rule, lays before the Senate
the amendment of the House of Representatives
to the bill (S. No. 82) to prevent the extermin-
ation of fur-bearing animals in Alaska.
Mr. WILSON. I wish that to lie over for
the present.
Mr. WILLIAMS. I hope the Senate will
concur in the amendment now.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The question is
on concurrence.
Mr. CASSERLY. I understood that bill
was ordered to be printed with the amend-
ment of the House.
The VICE PRESIDENT. It was ordered
to be printed yesterday, but it still remains on
the table as business from the House of Rep-
resentatives to be laid before the Senate.
Mr. CASSERLY. I should like to have an
opportunity to examine it.
The VICE PRESIDENT. Under the twen-
ty-fourth rule it is the duty of the Chair at the
opening of the session each day to submit
messages and bills from the House of Repre-
sentatives.
Mr. WILSON. I hope the bill will lie over
for the present.
The VICE PRESIDENT. If the Senator
from Oregon consents, it will lie over until
to-morrow.
Mr. MORTON. I hope it will not lie over
unless some very good reason can be given for
that course.
The VICE PRESIDENT. It is before the
Senate under the twenty-fourth rule. The
Chair has performed his duty. It is for the
Senate to act upon it.
Mr. WILLIAMS. I will state that this bill,
as it comes to the Senate from the House, has
been printed since March of last year in almost
the identical words in which it is now before
the Senate ; and if Senators have neglected to
examine it, of course they cannot find fault
with the legislation on the subject. There are
obvious reasons why some action should be
taken on the subject at this time. The season
is rapidly passing away when the seals can _ be
taken, and unless there be some legislation
the Government will lose this year the revenue
from the seal fishery. Two hundred and fifty
thousand dollars per annum is provided for as
the income of the Government from this bill.
The Government has lost that amount for the
last year. This is a provision to put $250,000
into the Treasury of the United States.
Mr. STEWART. The only substantial
amendment to the Senate bill is increasing the
amount to be paid by the company on each seal.
Mr. SCHURZ. Has this bill come over
from the House now?
The VICE PRESIDENT. This is an amend-
ment of the House to a Senate bill, which has
been submitted by the Chair under the twenty-
fourth rule.
Mr. SCHURZ. Will an objection throw it
over until to-morrow?
The VICE PRESIDENT. It will not. The
Senate can decide what it will do with it. It
is entirely within the control of the Senate.
Mr. WILLIAMS. I will state that all the
amendments made by the House are simply in
the interest of the Government. The Senate
bill fixed the tax at one dollar on each seal.
The House has fixed it at two dollars. The
Senate did not fix any amount of rental, and
this bill provides that the rental shall not be
less than $50,000 yearly, in addition to two
dollars per head on each sea!; so that all the
amendments of the House are entirely in the
interest of the Government and for the protec-
tion of the seal-fisheries.
Mr. SCHURZ. It seems to me that there
is a question of considerable magnitude in-
volved in this bill. It appears to me very
questionable whether it is the best policy of
the Government to put the seal-fisheries into
the hands of a monopoly, or to open them to
general competition.
Mr. WILLIAMS. There is no question
about that. That has been settled.
Mr. SCHURZ. How has it been settled?
No bill has been passed.
Mr. MORTON. This bill did pass the
Senate.
Mr. FOWLER. I did not know that it had
Mr. MORTON. It passed after fall discus-
sion.
Mr. WILLIAMS. That is the opinion of
the Secretary of the Treasury, and the opinion
of the House, after along examination, and the
Senate has so decided once.
Mr. STEWART. Twice.
Mr. WILLIAMS. That question seems to
be settled.
Mr. SCHURZ. At any rate, I hope the bill
will not be acted upon before Senators can
have an opportunity to look into it. I should
like to see it. I heard a great deal of it while
in California last year.
Mr. HOWARD. I ask leave to introduce
a bill.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The morning
business has not yet commenced. It is made
the duty of the Presiding Officer of the Senate,
under the twenty-fourth rule, after the reading
of the Journal, to lay before the Senate mes-
sages from the President, reports from the Ex-
ecutive Departments, and bills and joint reso-
lutions or other messages from the House of
Representatives. This amendment of the House
is before the Senate under the twenty-fourth
rule.
Mr. WILLIAMS. I hope the Senate will
concur in it.
Mr. CASSERLY. I have 110 disposition to
delay this bill, but I do think that I ought to be
allowed to look over the House amendment and
compare it with the general body of the Senate
bill; and I suggest to the Senator from Oregon,
if he has no objection, that it be passed over
informally to permit me to do that. He can
take it up some time during the day.
Mr. WILLIAMS. I do nothear the Senator.
Mr. CASSERLY. I say that I have no dis-
position to delay this bill, and I simply ask to
be allowed to read the House amendment,
which I have never seen, and compare it with
the general body of the bill; and I suggest to
the Senator that he allow his motion to be
passed over informally for the present, with
liberty to him to take it up by and by, after I
have had an opportunity to examine the bill
and the amendment.
Mr. DRAKE. Can we not hear the amend-
ment read?
Mr. WILLIAMS. The Senator from Cali-
fornia knows well enough that it is almost im-
possible to get up a bill here at any time by a
motion, unless it comes up in the regular order.
The amendment of the House to the Senate
bill can be read. It has been printed, and
printed for months. I have a copy here that
has been printed since March, containing the
identical language of the amendment of the
House.
Mr. MORTON. I desire to say one word
on this subject. The Government has some
interest in the passage of this bill at the pres-
ent session. The Senate passed this bill, im-
posing a tax of one dollar, I believe, on the
seal. The House has put it up to two dollars. If
this bill fails, the Government will get nothing.
Mr. WILLIAMS. It will lose $250,000per
Mr. WILSON. I have no objection to the
bill being acted upon, but I want to hear the
amendment of the House read.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The question is
on concurring iu the amendment of the House.
The amendment will be reported.
The Chief Clerk. The amendment of the
House of Representatives is to strike out all
of the Senate bill after the enacting clause, and
to insert in lieu thereof the following  
Mr. WILSON. I do not ask to have the
whole of the amendment read. I desire to
have that portion of it providing for a lease for
twenty years of these islands to this corpora-
tion read.
Mr. EDMUNDS. I want to hear the whole
of the amendment read if we are going to act
upon it. I only ask that it may be reported
iu the usual course, only once, so that we may
understand what it is.
The VICE PRESIDENT. Precisely; it is
now being reported in the usual course. The
Senator from Missouri [Mr. Schurz] also
desires it to be reported in full.
The Chief Clerk read the amendment of the
House of Representatives; which was to sub-
stitute for the Senate bill the following :
That it shall be unlawful to kill any fur-seal upon
the islands of St. "Paul and St. George, or in the
waters adjacent thereto, except (luring the months
