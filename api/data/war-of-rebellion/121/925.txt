[Inclosure.]

FORTRESS MONROE, VA., June 6, 1866.

Major General NELSON A. MILES, U. S. Volunteers,

Commanding Military District of Fort Monroe, Fort Monroe, Va.:

SIR: I respectfully report that the general health of state prisoner Jefferson Davis is slowly but decidedly improving. His appetite is becoming better and he relishes his food more than at any time since he has been under my charge. Though still quite weak he seems to be gaining muscular strength and he walks with less evidence of fatigue than heretofore. His nervous system, too, seems less irritable and he sleeps better, though he still complains of the tramp of the sentinels, but states they disturb him less than heretofore. He principal complaint is of the light burning in his room, which he states irritates his eye and prevents him from sleeping, as he otherwise would. The removal, as far as possible, of the disturbing cause of his sleep and the liberty of the fort during the day has been of great and decided benefit to him.

Your obedient servant,

GEO. E. COOPER,

Surgeon, U. S. Army.

WAR DEPARTMENT, Washington City, June 6, 1866.
