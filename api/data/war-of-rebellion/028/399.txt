HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, October 7, 1862-10 p.m.

General W. W. AVERELL,Green Spring, Va.:

Your dispatch of 6 p.m. just received; also one from Colonel Campbell, at Sir John's Run, dated 6.40 p.m. He represents the infantry force reported this morning as only about 700, and it is believed to be in Hedgesville. The cavalry has fallen back to Pughtown. Please exercise your own judgment about operating against the rebel forces on the Upper Potomac, but use every effort to destroy some of these bridge-burners before you return.

General B. F. KELLEY,Cumberland:

Your dispatch of 10 a.m. received. General Averell has been ordered to proceed at once to Sir John's Run, and resist the advance of the rebels toward Colonel Campbell. Should he receive such information as to render it probable the rebel force is too strong for him, you will please furnish him such additional force of infantry from your command as may be necessary. Colonel Campbell should keep his cavalry scouts well out, and if the force approaching proves to be very large, he should fall back, to unite with General Averell's advance. Please report often.

R. B. MARCY,

Chief of Staff.

General Averell has been ordered to march to your support from Cumberland, and will assume command on his arrival. Keep your cavalry scouts well out, and if you get positive information that the approaching force is too large for you, you will fall back to meet General Averell.
