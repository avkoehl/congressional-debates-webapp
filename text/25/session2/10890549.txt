APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
Public Lands—Mr* C. Johnson*
549
H. of Reps,
sanction if the question were brought home to the bosom of
every mn m the Union Many propositions of a like and
kindred c ¡aractei have been submitted m this House and in the
Senate
On thf 12th of Februaiy, 1823, Mr White moved that the
House d o jrae to the following resolution, viz
" Resolved, 1 hat the Committee of Ways and Means be in
stiuctedto inquire into the expediency of appropriating and set
ting apart" muiety ot portion of (he avails oí the annual sales of
the public Iand**, for the purpose of establishing a permanent
jncieas m iund , the mteiestof which, after it shall have in
cleased « a given sum, shad be distributed for thepiomotion of
education m the several States, according to the principles of
equal right md justice '
The following year, (1824,) Mr Strong submitted the follow
ing lesolution
" Resolved, That all moneys which shall be íeceived on ac
count of the sales and entries ol the public lands, after the 4th
day of July, 1825, ought to be appropriated exclusively to the
suppoit of common school , and the construction of loads and
canals, and that the said moneys ought to be divided between
the «everal States and Territories, in proportion to the represen
tfttio i of each in tne House of liepiesentatives oí the United
State3, and applied by them respects ely to the aforesaid pur
pos°s, in such manner, and with such limitations and conditions,
da the Congress may prescribe '
The next year, (1890 ) Mr Dickerson, of the Senate, made a
report upon a similar resolution
The comiii tee state that they " hav e come to the conclusion,
that gieat advantages wouldresult to the United States fiom an
annual distribution among them, by some equitable ratio, of a
portion of our national revenue, for the pui poses of education
and internal improvement, as the State Governments may re
epectivefy deem most to their advantage, <fcc
' Money, distributed as proposed, would give rew activity to
mdu try and enteipri«e in all the States, and that equally and
simultaneously
' It would create a vigilance on the p&rt of the State Govern
mentso/er the expenditures of the Geneial Government, and
theieby prevent the waste of money, and the adoption of extrav-
agant measuies that might diminish the amount of the annual
úiiudenú*
ff It would secure impartial justice to all the States in the chs
tribution of tt eeipendituiesof our ie venue, afailure of which
at present is a subject of 'oud and just complaint
' It would leheve the General Govemmentof the serious in
convenient e oí an overflowing Treasury, w hich, if not provided
for n the manner proposed, oi bv a reduction of out revenue,
will impah   he moatimpoitant principles of oui Constitution
1 wou1 1 relieve the two House ol Congress of a large pox
tioa of legisla ion, now devoted to the disposal of our -surplus
iund —le¿   ¡ation of the woist kind, calculated to pioduce com
Unanoiib, sectional feelings, injustice, and waste of the public
treasure '
Althougn tnere was at that lime a large national debt, estimat
ed by the report of the Secretary of the Treasury to be on the
1st day of January, 1826, $30,935,537 25, yet the Senate s com
mutee repoireum favor oí the plan of dividing the revenues
iiom ibe oiuiic lands among the States for the purposes ol
e'ucation n d internal improvement and state that—
' Under a n an to du> nbute amone, the States a poition of our
na íonaí icvenue and at tha &ame tine to piovide forthegrad

b¿armg thi^c per cent interest, to be redeemed at some distant
period "
Vdiions otier propositions have been urged, or rather in tro
du^ed into each of the two Houses priOL and sub&eq lent to the
pe iodi htv< ■> iuded to O.ie, which was reported by Mr
Clay, oí hrn ucky, and was, ably supported, passed both

I have read all (he a i les ol cession, allthe compacts and
can nowh°re find e\ en an intimation, a sentence of doubt tl at
will allow one "5iate to haveagieater propo.nonof benefit from
the proceeds of the public lands than another The General
<?dv*i**ient has been made an agent, a tiustee, by the Sutes,
for their mutual convenience and benefit, with express mjunc
turns to be impartial m the appropriation and disuibution of
the common propeuy of all the States of this Limon
On this part of the subject I BhaU offer one other extract, and
that !s ftom the proceedings of the Legislature of Ohio, and I
cannot withhold my admiration of the sound and firm ground 
which it has taken on this subject A State, whicii but forty
years ago was a vast wilderness, by the bounty of the General
Government and its soil, with an enterprising population, is now
the third S'ate m the tfmonin population and power, and al
lead y
------.-----------1 leads
New colonies forth.! that towards the Western seas
Spread like rapid fiame among the autumnal tree* "
The resolutions were passed on the 2d February, 1838, and
the part v> hich I shall lead is as follows
" We do, therefoie, declare that the public landsof the United
States at e the pioperty of the whole Union held m trust ior the
States, that this trust can only be answered by givins to all the
Stales the proper proceeds of their value, that we protest
against any change in the long established system of managing
the national estate, as it was devised by the Congress of the
revolution, andsustamedby every administration of the Govern
ment till the present, and ?ve maintain that the lands shall be
sold at their pioper price, ior the benefit of all the people of
the States not squandered and confiscated for the benefit of a
few, and we also maintain that the six hundred millions of
acres yet unsold are the great inheritance of the future people
of these States, and that any faithless consent of this genera
tion to abandon that inheritance to the Federal Government, to
be sold piecemeal, and the money used as common íevenue,
would be to make that Government moie powerful, and to fos
ter extravagance in public expenditure while it would lessen
the rights of the States and deprive them, of Ihi? unfailing
means of advancing the condition of then people for cen
tunes to come "
For the reputation of the new States, 1 could wish that such
sentiments were more generally pievalent among them And
I may as well say at this time that my remarks m relation to
appropnations ol land, made by the Geneial Government to
the Western States for the promotion of education, do not apply
but in a very limited de/ree to Kentucky and Tennessee Ken
tucky has recen ed a small portion, to aid some oí her elemosy
naiy institutions, and Tennessee has received about two hun
dred thousand acres for academies and colleges
The views taken by the Legislature of Ohio aie worthy ©f
that enteiprisins! and enlightened ^tate, and commend them
selves to the emulation of the oldei, less fortunate, and less
prosperous States of the Union, they show piactical intelli-
gence and sagacious wisdom, they look beyond the present, and
point to the distant future Instead oi treating and using the
vast public domain as a fund foi political «rambling and political
bribery instead oí throwing it oi t as a lure to the ambitious or
the avaricious, as is too much the case m the pie's nt day, how
much better would itbe for the piesent and rutine geneiations
if it were set apait as a sacied fund, to be used for educational
purposes ard no other, not to be touched for am othei purpose,
ii eithei peace or war I the whole piocee/s weie set apart
for that exclusive purpos  \ ith the privilege of the sues to
invest one half of then distributive shares in wor1 s of internal
improvement, mst enaiantymgtothe Goveinrrent a the asent

Government continued ) the legal interest of the State on the

General Goverjmpnts would cease, th's conflict between dir
feient sections of tne Union would end, and a policv as endur

character, and which controls their pursui & m an emu ert de
giee—the acquisition, by the shortest road, of the puze of efflu
ence and wealth The slow and gtadual puisu t of gun our
íestive and enterprising rnmds will neither apprecia'e nor com
prehend We lie down with dreamy visiors of wealth and
awake boldly nerved for its speedy attainment But we know
th« value of «ducation, and I am confident m the belief that
the Government will adopt commensurate meara for its more
general diffusion And, were we to extend our inquiries abroad,
in order to ascertain if there is an urgent and pressing neces-
sity to send the " schoolmaster abroad in the land," we would
find, to our national reproachand deep and abiding mollifica
tion, that every region of the nation calls aloud for his services
There is no civilized and chi istian nation on earth which boss's
of its lefinement, iu, wisdom^ and its fame, thati3o'imperatrv ely
requires a more liberal system of public schools
Let us examine, for a moment, the condition of education m
the nations which we have too often been m the habit of con
sidering as inferior to our own m the onwaid march of civiliza-
tion and instruction Acroi ding to Lord Brougham^ statement,
in 487 parishes m England, there had been educated m 1818,
when England adopted a moje liberal system of populax edu
cation, 56000 children What, let me ask, was the effect of
that system? In the same parishes, m 1828, there were edu-
cated 105,000, so that, m the bnef period often years, the num
ber of children who had recen ed the benefits of education had
more than doubled What, let me ask, is the extent of the
system pursued in other nations, and especially Prussia"i We
find, from an extract in Cousin, from a report published m the
Royal Gazette of Berlin, m 1828, that according to the census
made at the end of 1825, the number of inhabitants irr the whole
of the Prussian morarchy, amounted to 12,256,725, amongst
whom weie 4,487,421 children under 14 years of age , which
gives 366 children for every 1,000 inhabitants, or about eleven
thirtieths of the nation
Admitting education m the public schools to begin at the age
of seven years complete, we may calculate that three sevenths
of the entire population of children are ofanasre to go to school,
and we should have for the entire Prussian monarchy the num
ber of 1932,200 children capable of íeceiving the benefits of
education    ivow, atthe end of 182T , theie were in the kingt om
