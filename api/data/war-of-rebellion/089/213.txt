Major-General BUTLER:

The men will be sent to the regiment to which they were assigned by the War Department. There is no evidence that these men have been tampered with here. They certainly have not been by the provost officers in charge of them here. Please send an officer to take charge of them and conduct them to their regiment.

By command of Lieutenant-General Grant:

Commanding U. S. Armies, Headquarters City Point:

I forward to you the inclosed dispatch* from General Terry as the result so far of his reconnaissance, which he begun this morning at daylight. Shall I order an attack on the works? They extend in a line from the house marked E. Cunningham on the map, near Darbytown road, about two miles from the intermediate line, round to the point near New Market road, marked Laurel Hill.

CITY POINT, VA., October 13, 1864

Major-General BUTLER,

I would not attack the enemy in his intrenchments. The reconnaissance now serves to locate them for any future operation. To attack now we would lose more than the enemy and only gain ground which we are not prepared to hold, nor are we prepared to hold, nor are we prepared to follow up any advantage we might gain.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
