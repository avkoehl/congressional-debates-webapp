power of appointing the judges of the supreme and
inferior courts, but he has no control over them
when appointed—no power of removal, no right of
dictation. Thejudieial branch is perfectly distinct
from the executive; each has its own rights and
own duties The argument is therefore nugatory
The judges being once appointed hold their offices
independent of the President; they depend not on
him for their term of office.
Not so with the departments of the executive
governments. The President is bound to see that
their operations are in accordance with the laws.
They hold their offices by his choice, and they are
appoimableand removable at his will, being in the
eye of the law consideied but as his auxiliaries,
and perfoimmg for him the functions of his depart-
ment of the Government. The executive power
is not vested in them, but in him
In the first debate on passing the bill in Congress,
Sedgwick is reported to have said, that a great
majority of the House had acknowledged that all
the officers of the Treasury Department were de-
pendent on the President for their continuance in
office, and rightfully so, as he was responsible for
their conduct. Thus, therefore, have we the acts
and speeches of the House of that Congress agi ee-
ing together, and agreeing with the practice of the
present Executive, and the acts of the Senate at
that period, although we have not their sayings,
for then they sat with closed doors; but we may
leasonably infer that they came to the same result,
on the same grounds, with the House, and there-
fore infer that their doings and sayings were alike
in concert.
There is, therefore, no doubt of the true puipose
of the First Congress in instituting the Treasury
Department, at the same time with the Depart-
ments for Foreign Affairs and for War; and there
can be no justifiable doubt that these several de-
partments weie intended as branches of the exec-
utive government, not as dependencies of Con-
gress—not all, nor one
But this is also strikingly exemplified in the
clauses specifying the auties of the Secretary of
the Treasury, in the I ill creating that department
These duties are of two kinds The first are
strictly official, as requir.ng him to supeuntend
the collection of the public revenues, to regulate
the sales of public land, and to control the finances
These duties are evidently executive in then char-
actei, not, ceitamly, of a legislative nature The
second duties, not official, require no use of public
power, and have no immediate effect oñ public
light; no official authority whatever is exeited,
such as the digesting of plans to regulate comm erce,
"to be laid before Congiess; his forming estimates
of finance, &c
These acts are nullities in the eye of the Con- !
stitution and law, conveying no authonty or
power, having no íesponsibihty nor effect. They
leqaire skill, intel'igence,and fidelity, and nothing
more. But m the former duties he acts as an ex-
ecutive agent, invested wi h authority as such

Friday, Januaty 17, 1834
Mr C P WHITE leported a hill for the relief
of ¡he legal representatives of John Coleman, de-
ceased.
Mr. WATMOÜGH reported a bill for the relief
of William P Zantzmger, late a purser in the
United States Navy.
Mr. ALLEN, of Ohio, reported a bill for the
relief of------- Fisher, all which bills were read
twice and committed.
Mr. WATMOÜGH reported a bill concerning
Navy pensions and the Navy pension fund, and
Mr POLK, a bill making appropriations for
revolutionary and other pensioners of the United
States for the year 1834, both of which bills were
severally referred to the Committee of the Whole
on the state of the Union, and ordered to be printed.
THE  PENSION LAWS.
The resolution submitted by Mr CHILTON,
to appoint a select committee toinqune into the
expediency of so extending the general pension
law, as to embrace within its piovisions those
persons who were engaged in the Indian wars
down to 1794, with the amendments thereto, sub-
mitted by Mr. Bouldin, to appoint a committee
to inquire into the moial effects of the pension
system, coming up as the unfinished business,
Mr PEYTON resumed his remaiks. He said
that any vote of the House, by which the services
of the persons engaged in the conflicts with the
Indians might be recognized, would be to them
the proudest day of their existence, and its effect
would be to relieve many who had long experi-
enced undeserved want and misery Adverting
to the statement made by the honorable membei
from Rhode Island, [Mr Rurges,] " that this was
a petty warfare," lie asked, could that be consid-
ered a petty warfare which raged from Georgia
to Canada, and in which thousands and tens of
thousands of savages had been engaged for years'
But to show that those wars were neither petty
nor inglorious, he referred the gentleman to an
instance in which a small party of only nineteen
whites had resisted and proved victorious over a
band of Indians, who outnumbeied them in the
(proportion of one hundred to one, and he described
these conflicts, and said that although after the
savages obtained victories, they had used their
powers barbarously; that in eveiy Indian camp
the íemnants of human skeletons,the remnants of
those whose bodies were consumed at the stake,
were to be met with, even the skeletons of women
and children, yet he must repel the insinuation
that the whites had committed similar atrocities,
and asked the gentleman if he ever heard of a
white man injuring women and children, begging
him, when he should hear such a charge made, to
set it down as false That gentleman was unspar-
ing of his censuie upon these hardy bands for
defending themselves, or forpursuing the savages.
But was he equally so upon the privateering of
those from his own State during the last war'
No1 Yet his patriotic blood seemed to cuidle in
his veins when he leflected upon the conduct of
the white man who was forced to pel ll his life
against the most fearful odds. He talked, too,
" of atiocious acts of íetahation having been com-
mitted by the frontier men," but Mi P denied
thejast'ce of this charge and referred the gentle-
man to the history of Kentucky and of the times,
by which he would learn such was not the conduct
of Boon w^en he penetrated into the deep forest
in pursuit of the two Miss Calloways, whom he
lfgained from the Indians and restored to their
homes Boon was not alone in such achievements
There was a long list in which the name of Weeks
and others were to be enrolled Theie were 1Ó0O
women and children who were taken captive,
wounded, or slam, at least 2,000 horses, and not
less than 5,000 dollar 'worth of piopeity taken
fiom the hiis-ssed and hUeding hunters Yet this
was all " petty" in the gentleman's opinion Mr
P contended rt length that it was owing to their
gallantexei'ions thestand irdiaised by Cornwallts
in the South, at the instigation of the Tories, had
been palled down, and attei detailing the events of
the battle at King's Mountain, as having contrib-
uted as much as any othei to estaba h the inde-
pet deuce of the Unned Suites, he eipieosed his
hope that the gloiy of that and their other actions
would be peí m ted to stand as a proud monument
of then fime, that the surviving remnant of such
a heroic band would be considered as not the
least deseivmg of'hose who now enjoyed the
bounty of the nation.
Mr. P1NCKNÉY said that he valued as highly
as any person the rich inhentance of independ-
ence that was left them by their fathers, and duly
appreciated the price at which it was purchased.
But he would prefer showing his veneration for
those engaged in the Revolution in some other way
than by increasing taxation, or the burdens of the
nation The mover of the resolution had cer-
tainly taken such captivating ground, that even he,
deprecating, as he must ever do,.the consequences
of its adoption by the House,was almost tempted
to give freely the pittance which was claimed so
eloquently for the war-worn veterans of the West.
But he had a higher duty to perform than to give
way to his feelings; as he must contend that the
House had no constitutional right to adopt the
resolution. The whole pension system was es-
tablished without constitutional authority, and he
defied the utmost ingenuity to point out any one
article in the Constitution fiom which the power
to establish it could be inferred. If, then, it was
not constitutional to establish the system for the
soldier of the Revolution, how much more unjust
was it to include within the provisions of that
law those who, whatever were their services else-
where, had no agency in that war' Their services
having been subsequent to that event, they had
not contributed to lay the glorious foundation on
which the Federal Constitution was raised. He
could not assent to the pension system being
established, much less being extended; for, by the
annual message of the President, as well as the
report from the Secretary of the Treasury, they
were plainly told that economy was necessary;
that tliere was some doubt that the revenue of
the country would keep pace with the expenditure;
and they were warned of this in order to prevent
them indulging their feelings by making appro-
priations of this character But notwithstanding
this warning, scarcely a day passed without some
schemes being presented which had for their object
an extension of the public expenditure. There
were propositions to distribute the public lands; to
make appropriations for subscriptions to various
roads and canals; and lastly, the pension system,
as now sought, was to be increased. He called
on the House to consider that the certain effect of
proceeding m this way must be to oblige them
again to have recourse to most onerous taxation;
and that for this purpose, notwithstanding all the
agitation which prevailed on the subject of the
tariff had been sealed by the compromise bill, that
subject must be again opened. But were Congress
prepared to convulse the country as it had been on
that question' Would they have the country so
torn and distracted as it was, and this, too, not for
the benefit of any great manufacturing interest, but
for such a measuie as this, which was only based
on an appeal to then feelings of generosity ' He
trusted not, for his motto was justice, rather than
geneiosity; and it was not justice to tax the pub
he for the benefit of a class of persons who had
no claims whatever. He would íejoice to see the
pension system abolished altogether, considering
that it was notoriously a branch which had its
origin in the protective system, ¡t had been de-
vised under color of showing gratitude to those
who achieved the independence of the country;
but, in reality, to keep up the system of high du-
ties, and this being the understandmgofthepeople
of the South as to its origin, it was most odious
to them, for they knew that so long as the expend-
iture of the Government was incieased, or kept
up unnecessarily, taxation mutt be resorted to.
They were now about to commence a new era;
the public detits were to be paid off There was
no longei a pretex' for the continuance of ta'V.aiion.
Economy was one principle on which the present
Administration came into office, to correctabuses
and reform institutions was another But how
had these promises been fulfilled' Where was
the letrenchment, where was the expenditure
reduced ' Instead of re renchment, they found
&uch extravagance to prevail, that some of the
departments were insolvent, and, ¡n such a state
of things, ought Congress to mciease the expend-
iture, oi to reduce the revenue to the legitimate
wants of the people' \s long as there was the
pretext of the public debt, the people bore taxa-
tion, but now that they Itnow that pretext is re-
moved, they demand as a right that no more tax-
ation, no more appropriations, shall be made than
