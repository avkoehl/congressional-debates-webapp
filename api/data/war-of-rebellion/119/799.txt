prisoners, capable of holding 200 patients, with ventilation, furnaces, hydrants, bath-room, &amp;c.

Fourth. Hospital and medical supplies are furnished by Surg. J. B. Porter, U. S. Army, medical purveyor at Chicago, promptly in accordance with 'supply table" for the medical department of the U. S. Army for 1863, and of the same quality as for U. S. troops at this camp.

Fifth. The kitchens are well supplied with stoves and appliances for cooking, and table furniture, chairs, stools, and benches. The cooks are detailed from the prisoners, and their kitchens and cooking are inspected daily by the surgeon in charge and three times a week by the post surgeon.

Sixth. The buildings now occupied as hospital [by] both Federals and prisoners were originally built for other purposes than which they are now used, and hence many inconveniences are experienced daily in treating the sick properly.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

First Michigan Sharpshooters, Post Surgeon.
HDQRS. COMMANDER OF POST CAMP DOUGLAS,Chicago, Ill, December 26, 1863.

Brigadier-General ORME, Commanding Post:

SIR: In obedience to your verbal order requiring me to report in writing the amount of clothing issued by myself to prisoners of war, together with such other facts as might be necessary to determine the present and past treatment of those confined here, I have the honor to submit the following:

I commenced to at as commissary of prisoners on the 23rd of September, 1863. At that time there were 3,127 prisoners present here; the greatest number here at any time since is 6,105.

1. On the arrival of the prisoners here some were found to be comfortably and others very poorly clad. Under verbal orders received by me from Colonel De Land, commanding post, I commenced at once to clothe the needy. There was a large amount of work to be done in the camp and not enough Federal soldiers to do it. The needy prisoners were detailed to work and the clothing given to them as a recompense. Those that were not detailed to work were given clothing from that furnished by Government for that purpose. Under this arrangement since the 23rd of September, 1863, I have issued to the needy:

A part of this clothing is receipted for on clothing receipt rolls by the prisoners. Those rolls show the amount issued from September 23, 1863, down to November 2, 1863; from November 2, 1863, to this date, I have kept a clothing book, in which may be found the names of the persons to whom clothing has been issued, and the articles. Besides the clothing so furnished by the Government the immediate relations of the prisoners have been permitted to furnish them clothing when they were really needy. If, on examination, the party to whom the clothing was directed was found not to be needy then the clothing was given to some one who was in want of it. I am unable to give the
