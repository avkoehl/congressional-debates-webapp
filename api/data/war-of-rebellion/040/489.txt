The question creating most embarrassment in he minds of the board was how to provide for line officers who have no knapsacks, but it is considered that all difficulties can be obviated upon ordinary marches if each line officer is required to employ the servant for which he is paid. The officer himself can carry his blanket and two days' rations, and the servant the balance; it being understood that his necessary baggage and mess-chest should be carried in a reserve column of transportation.

The foregoing is stated to show what can be carried under the most favorable circumstances, but considering the climate, the state of the roads, and the fact that three days' [rations] has heretofore been the maximum amount, the board recommend as follows:

1. That all extra clothing, except a change of underclothing, be stored.

2. That five days' rations of bread and small-stores be placed in the knapsacks.

3. Three days' cooked rations in the haversacks, and five days' fresh beef upon the hoof.

4. Two mules per regiment to carry camp-kettles, rice, beans, &amp;c.

Each soldier will carry-
