port from Col Bomford, oí the board of ordnance,
to the Secretary of War, in which it was stated
that the board consisted of twenty-eight officers,
and that a considerable accession was indispensa-
ble for the use of the service; and he actually rec-
ommended that the board be ircrea=ed to forty-two
in all, by the addition of two captains and twelve
lieutenants He took it for granted, therefore, that
there were no officers to spare from that board to
superintend the armories at Springfield and Har-
per's Ferry. No saving: could possibly be effected
by the change, for, if officers ot the corps of en-
gineers were appointed to these places, others
would have to be appointed to supply their places.
A military man (said Mr B) was only fit to
eommand, he was accustomed to command, and
that, too, in a dialect which our mechanics and
farmers did not understand, and it would take
years before these freemen could become so broken
in spirit as to snbmit to the despotism of a military
rule.
Mr. B ihen dwelt with much force upon the de-
plorable condition to which the armorers, who had
grown grey la the service of the Government, had
been reduced at Springfield since the armory had
been placed under military supenntendency. There
had been, ever «ince lhat time, one continual scene
of confusion and hardship Many had beca dis
charged because they could not submit to their
grievances Some had been discharged because
they had dared to raise their voices of complaint to
the Executive, and to Congress, to seek redress of
their grievances. Mr. B., after passing a high
eulogium on the character and capacity of the ar-
morers employed at Springfield—who, he «aid, were
among the most respectable, temperate, and meri-
torious men of that place—appealed to the Senate
to adopt the amendment, as the only means by
which any hope of redress could be entertained
Mr. PRESTON observed that he had looked
through the statements made by the workmen from
both SprmgfHd and Haiper'o Ferry, and, m do-
ing so, had scrupulously avoided being mfluerced
by any prejndices He was sorry to say that, pre-
vious (o these repre ent&aons, the armorers had
adopted a cour e of proceedings which he <,ould
not approve—«uch as forming as ooiations, and
adopting a tanffof puces for themselves, without
consulting ihe general interests of all concerned in
their art With mm h of what they «aid in their re-
monstrance, he concurred But if tbe rules and re-
gulations which they compiam of are oppressively
strict, it is noi the superintendents (civil or milita-
ry) they should blame, because they are bound to
carry out the rules and regulations which are «n-
acted for them to see carried out The gtievance
is not, therefore, the estibh^hment of a rwlitary
superintendence, but the i tiles themselves He con-
sidered that the men who had attended here as dele-
gates, were as respee'able, intelligent, and worthy
citizens, as any he knew, and he hoped, when their
excited minds ■¡■hall have had time 10 cool down,
they will find the reasonableness of some of the
regulations which they now complam of as gnev
anees
Two >earsap'o, the Ordnance department being
dissatisfied with the condition of the armories and
the expense of making arms, appointed a commis-
sion of o/hcers to mi estimate 'he whole establish-
ment A report was made, ( ibich he read,) n com-
mending the change to a military control. This
seemed to him to leave nodiscietion wi h trie bosrd
of ordmncebut to make tnesu^enntendeneea mili-
tary superintendence His own opinion was, that
in every branch of the military department, the
principles of strict military discipline and regula-
tions should be carried out It was found th?t the
worst consequences flowed from a mixed and
motley sy tern—half cifA, and half militar) It
would be better to have the armones controlled by
a civil system, than by a half militar/ system But
under a military department, these estabiisnments
should b" g verned bv a military di cip ine
Mr P here entered into a narra ¡ve of ¡he pro-
ceedings nf the Ordnance dcpa"ment wi h regard
to experiments
Mr. "kOUNG understood there was no existing
law to authorize the suppression of the civil super-
intendence, «nd that the armories are now under
CONCESSIONAL GLOSE.
military rule It seemed that these armorers are
unwilling to remain under military discipline. He
thought there could be no great inconvenience m
accommodating them. He should, therefore, sub-
mit the following amendment
That the duties of theofficesof superintendent at the aimo
ríes at bpringfield and Harper's Ferry shall not be performed
by officers oí the ordnance corps, or other officers ol the army
butshall be confined to the civil superintendents, of competent
knowledge, as heretofore
Mr BITES accepted the modification proposed
by the Senator from Illinois, [Mr Young ]
Mr. BENTON observed lhat it was owing to the
smallness of the ordnance estabhshment, that civil
officers were appointed as superintendents. Now
there are officers enough The question whether
the superintendent should be a military man or a
civilian, was not a question competent for the
workmen to entertam: it was a question for the
Government to decide But when it came to the
question of the fitness of the individual selected to
be superintendent, it was one which the armorers
were competent to entertain, and remonstrate upen
Mr. BATES observed that the President of ti>e
United Slates alone had the power of appointing
these superintendents, and the Ordnance depart-
ment can have no authority to break such appoint-
ments In reference to the allusion of the chair-
man of the Military Committee to combinations or
associations of the armorers, he could assure the
honorable chairman that there had been no combi-
nations—no associations!, he armorers had merely
appointed a committee to wait upon the superin-
tendent with a statement of their complaints, and
he refused to hear them He asked the S-nator
froto Missouri why the mere mechanical operat on
of making gun-stocks, or any other branch of gun-
making, should be subject to military discipline ?
They were purely mechanical arts—not military
evolutions. He deprecated the idea of subjecting
men in the pursuit of any branch of industry, to
military discipline in the performance of their la
bors He pointed out many of the oppressive and
vexatious consequences of such unnecessary rules
Mr. CONRAD, since he had been appointed a
member of th- Military Committee had paid some
attention to this subject, but he h^d not been able to
see the matter m the same light as that in which it
was viewed and depicted by the Senator from
Massachusetts [Mr Bates] He onsiuered the
only question which could be entertained, was as to
the chaiactTand conduct of the individual actmg
as supenntendent, and not as to his being a mili-
tary man or a civilian
Mr PHELPS asked that the proposition might
be read ?s u now stands
The CH \IR read the original claase and pro-
pos d amendment, as modi&Vd
Mr PHELPS ^ald he had not devoted much at-
tentioT to the subject, and it was, th-reiore, with
much difhdenc , h^ rose to dissent from th  opinions
of the chairman of the Mi mry Corrmittee. He
had, however, come to Ihe conclu ion that the
armories should be under a civil superintendent
He thought there was a very serious error m not
drawing a precise line of demotion between iho e
portions of the military es abhshments which are
pu'ely civil, and those which are purely mil ary,
for there are various parts of those establishments
as distm"tly civil as any occupation of life can
be He pointed out the vexations which persons
exerci irg those occupations must be subj ct to
under military difo p'me
Mr BATES read, from a document in his hand,
a table showing the cost <f muskets manufactured
at the armories for a long series of year The
cost pow, is from three to four dollars per gun
more man prior to 1840 This is the effect of
military superintendence or the armor es

Mr BUCHANAN said he was inclined to agree
with the Senator from Ohio, but he would appeal

to the chairman of the Military Committee wheth-
er it would not be best to exclude tho p doubtful
clauses, and allow the bill to pass through at once.
The bill weuld only be retarded by the<e amend-
ments Thes ubject might be introduced as a sep-
arate measure
Mr. PRESTON did not think it was necessary
that the man who supermdends a mechanical es-
tablishment should be competent to make the
mechanism wbch he superintends. The logic
was by no means cor elusive It reminded
him of what had once been said—.very beau-
tifully, to be sure, but not very conclusively—
"who rules o'er freemen, should himself be free,"
the logic of which was aptly parodied by an emi-
nent man—"who drives fat oxen, must himself be
fat. 
He contended that, as educated men, as practi-
cal men, and as gentlemen, there was not a corps
on ths face of the earth supenoi to the ordnance
corp.. Mostly military men, educated at West
Point, they were the fittest persons to be chosen by
the Ordnance depaitment to carry into effect the
purposes of the department, and according to the
rules and regulations of the department itself,
which they perfectly understand. They were edu-
cated men, andwastheie not a be ter chance of
their making agieeab'e superintendent., to tbe ar-
morers themselves, than civilians, cho en from the
rani s of briefless lawyers or broken down, hack
politicians'!
Mr CONRAD made some explanation in refer-
ence to a remark of bis which the Senator from
Massachusetts appeared to misunderstand.
Mr. ARCHER stated the grounds of grievance
complained of by the armorers of Harpa N Ferry,
whose memorial had been read to-day No com-
plaint has been !o ged against these men, and no
complaint ca be lodged against them, yet a mili-
tary administration is brought to contiol them,
which has puduced nothing but di'content and
discord These are men not accustomed to milita-
ry contiol, and who never should be made subject
to it against their wi'l It should not be forgotten
that they are freemen and cmz-ni like ourselves,
and, while Congress is stud) irg to efTec ihe desira-
ble objec of auaimng strictness of discipline in the
mili'ary establishment , it should not be attempted
to establish it at the <aenfi',e of the feelings and
consciousness of freedom of those men
Mr HUNTINGTON would vote against the
amendment proposed H  considered these ar-
mories purely military establishments It would,
in his mind, te a strange anomaly to place a mili-
tary establishment under the control of a civilian.
The duties of th" effiee required tiat they should be
executed by military men fcesides, the exp n?es
of the department will be reduced upwards of four
thousand dollars, as officers in the ordnance
coros, aheady in the service of the Givernment,
can be emp'oyed as superintendents, and supersede
the necessity of retaining the civilians now employ-
ed Another advantage would be in having the
office executed by individual* aloof from politics,
and that it would no longer be a source of reward
for poiifcol  ervices
Mr SIMMONS remark d that, ,f the armorers
tnd to perform military duty, the arguments of the
Senator from Connec íeut would be perfectly cor-
rect Bat as the duties to be performed are mechan-
ical, the supenntendent shou d b  a civilian. Mili-
tary men had nothing to do with the business. The
effect of this military superintendence would be to
raise the prices of ihe services to be performed.
If a mechanic is to be subjected to extraordinary
restraints he must be paid ex raordioary wages
for it He would not htmself, if he wa^ an armo-
rer, work under su-h discipline unless he was paid

Why no' let well en ugh aline? This nc" system
