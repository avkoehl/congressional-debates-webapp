The inclosed copy of General Sherman's communication is respectfully forwarded for information of Major-General Howard.

SOUTHARD HOFFMAN,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,July 7, 1864-4.30 p.m.

Major-General HOWARD,

Commanding Fourth Corps:

GENERAL: General Sherman has ordered Schofield to cross the river to-night at Roswell Factory, and secure a lodgment on the south side. To divert the enemy's attention as much as possible from him I wish you to display a force in front of Pace's Ferry, about sundown, as if you were making preparations to cross there. Open with your artillery on their batteries on the opposite side, and after getting the range cease firing until about 8 p.m. At that hour fire rapidly for fifteen minutes or half an hour, with the elevation necessary to reach the enemy's batteries, and have persons posted near the river, in some secure place, with instructions to give commands as if marching a strong column to the ferry to effect the laying of a bridge; at the same time keeping up a heavy fire from the skirmish line on the river-bank.

Respectfully,

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,Near Vining's Station, Ga., July 7, 1864.

Major General O. O. HOWARD,

Commanding Fourth Army Corps:

GENERAL: The major-general commanding directs that you send a regiment along up the river to connect with General Schofield, the bridge over Rottenwood Creek having been repaired.

I am, very respectfully,

SOUTHARD HOFFMAN,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

Respectfully forwarded.

I have directed General Newton to comply with the within order; but I do not precisely understand it, since the bridge across Rottenwood Creek is reported uninjured, and the place for Schofield's crossing to-night is Roswell Factory, between fifteen and twenty miles distant. The hour of sending this dispatch is not named. Shall I dispatch the regiment at once to Roswell Factory? I have ordered it at daylight to-morrow.

O. O. HOWARD,

Major-General.
