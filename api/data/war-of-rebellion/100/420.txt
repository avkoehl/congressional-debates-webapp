General Meade's army, two corps, passed through Richmond yesterday. One of General Slocum's corps is now going into camp at Manchester. General Howard leaves Petersburg to-day and will be in Manchester to-morrow. It will require about three days to fit them out. General Sherman is not expected until about the 15th. Shall the troops, when ready, move on to Alexandria, or await General Sherman's arrival here?
