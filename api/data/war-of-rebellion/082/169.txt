The means I should adopt would be to send to ask Ould to meet Major Mulford at Port Walthall. They will explain to you if you desire it, or will inform me before they go, the subject of their mission.

CITY POINT, VA., July 11, 1864.

Major-General BUTLER,

Commanding,&amp;c.:

Hill's corps was moved from its position at 5 p.m. yesterday, citizens say, to go North. Have your scouts or men from the observatory discovered any movement of troops between Petersburg and Richmond? Please make an effort to ascertain about this. I am not willing to let Mr. Gilmore and Colonel Jaquess go through our lines until I know the object of their going.

HDQRS. DEPT. OF VIRGINIA AND NORTH CAROLINA, In the Field, July 11, 1864-4.20 p.m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT,Commanding Armies of the United States:

I have caused the matter in relation to the moving of Hill's corps to be investigated. I cannot hear of any movement of any troops, either over the turnpike or railroad or over Chaffin's farm. It is certain that none have been moved by daylight and that none have been moved at night over the railroad, because we can hear them. They might go over the turnpike at night without our hearing them. Five deserters are just in from our front Pickett's division, but they have heard nothing of any movement of any troops. I will take every pains to keep you informed upon this and kindred subjects.

BENJ. F. BUTLER,

Major-General, Commanding.

CITY POINT, VA., July 11, 1864.

Major-General BUTLER,

Commanding,&c.:

I have seen and heard Mr. Gilmore and Colonel Jaquess. You may effect an interview between them and Commissioner Ould, and permit them to pass through out lines if they will be received by the other party.
