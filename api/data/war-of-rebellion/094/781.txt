Honorable J. A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War, Richmond:

I respectfully request to be relived from the command of this army.

J. B. HOOD,

General.

MOBILE, January 13, 1865.

President DAVIS:

Halligan, with torpedo and boat, will not attack enemy; has been transferred by Commodore Farrand. Please have him and boat placed under my orders, with authority to me to place an officer of the army or navy in command, that the enemy may be attacked at once. The boat is said to be the best of the kind. Halligan and five or six men have now been for months exempt from service on account of her. There has never been so good an opportunity for a torpedo boat to operate as is afforded by the fleet off Mobile.

DABNEY H. MAURY,

Major-General.

[Indorsement.]

JANUARY 18, 1865.

Secretary of Navy does not know that his Department has any control over the boat, but has directed Captain Farrand, if under his control, to turn it over to you.

Honorable J. A. SEDDON:

Have this day delivered to Captain Noyes, U. S. Army, the officer designated to receive the 1,000 bales of cotton to be disposed of for benefit of C. S. prisoners. The elements and inclemency of the weather have occasioned the delay. A boat of the lightest draught was selected, and even then a portion of the cotton had to be lightened over the obstructions. The receipt will be forwarded as soon as the cotton is transferred to a U. S. vessel lying some distance down the bay.

D. H. MAURY,

Major-General, Commanding.
