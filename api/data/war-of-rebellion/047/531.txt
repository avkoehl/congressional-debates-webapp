CHARLESTON, S. C., December 1, 1863.

General S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General, Richmond, Va.:

Enemy's bombardment of Sumter has slackened considerably in last two days, shelling principally at night, to cut off communications. No casualties since 27th ultimo. Ten shells were thrown in city last night in direction of my residence, with little damage and no casualties. Practice, however, very good.
