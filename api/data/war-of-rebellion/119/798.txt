POST HOSPITAL, Camp Douglas, Ill., December 27, 1863.

Brigadier-General ORME, Commanding Post:

SIR: In obedience to Special Orders, Numbers 60, of the 26th instant, I have the honor to submit the following report concerning sick prisoners of war in hospital at Camp Douglas:

First. There are now sick in hospital 217, distributed in six wards, with an average atmospheric capacity of 975 cubic feet to the patient. Each has a cot bed, sack filled with hay, sheets, pillows of hair or hay, pillow slips or cases, two blankets to each bed and more when the surgeons deem it necessary for the health or comfort of the sick, and to those who are confined to their beds, drawers, shirts, and socks from the hospital clothing, all of which are frequently changed.

Second. The rations issued to the sick prisoners are the same in quality and quality as issued to U. S. troops sick in hospital, which consist of bacon, beans, beef (fresh), soft bread, potatoes, rice, tea, coffee, sugar, &amp;c. The purchases from hospital savings are butter, eggs, cabbages, beets, parsnips, turnips, onions, chickens, oysters, fresh fish, salt fish (and lemons when prescribed or recommended by the attending surgeon), dried apples, berries, currants, cherries, all in such quantities as are needed and in accordance with the "diet table" recommended by the Surgeon-General.

Third. There are four contract surgeons, on duty with prisoners, and five acting surgeons, who volunteered their services, and were detailed from among the prisoners, being graduates of medical colleges, and so far have shown themselves to be men of fine medical talent anxious to do their duty and conform to the rules of the camp and hospital. There is not hospital capacity enough at present, but will soon be remedied, for there is now being erected a fine, commodious building for use of sick
