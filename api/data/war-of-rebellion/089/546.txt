HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,November 7, 1864.

General HUMPHREYS:

GENERAL: The commander of my picket-line on the river reports that during the p. m. two guns were moved by the enemy from their left to their center. A verbal report was sent to the corps officer of the day just before dark, by the picket officer, that the enemy were heard at work cutting timber opposite the island. At this place there is only about thirty feet of deep water between our side and the island. It is possible the enemy may be fixing bridges to communicate with their pickets in the marsh at that place. I have directed General Gibbon to keep a very close watch across the river, and have sent a staff officer to the point referred to make observations.
