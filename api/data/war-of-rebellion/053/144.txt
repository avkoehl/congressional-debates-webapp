MUNFORDVILLE, KY., October 6, 1863.

Captain A. C. SEMPLE,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Louisville:

Information from Cave City says rebels have left Glasgow; gone toward Burkesvile. Have not learned what number of Martin's men were captured. Rebels took private deposits from bank. No other damage done. If Colonel Spaulding has not moved it will be well to send him through Columbia if he is mounted.

Dispatch from Glasgow to Colonel Lauck from Major Martin says rebel Colonel Hughs captured 100 of his men, burned his commissary building, and carried off much private property. Major Martin intends pursuing Hughs to-night with 60 men. Will Major Martin and Colonel Spaulding be ordered to report to me for orders?
