It appearel to him that tne statement ol the Senator ought to
suffice, and he asked the Senator r ot to m&i->t upon the adoption
of Vus resolution The feenate had no right to institute such an
inquiry It wouldbea great assumption of power on their part
w-m^mj-e mto the conduct of the editor of the Mddisonjan    If
it affected the rights of the Senate, they might, with propriety
take some action as on a breach of privilege, but any publica
tion, whether founded on real or supposed facets, was not a
proper subject for the action of the standing committees of the
Senate, he therefore hoped that body would weigh well the
consequences whichmightresultfrom the adoption of the reso
lution
Mr BENTON followed the Senator from Maryland, [Mr
Merrick,] and said the inquiry proposed was of a very differ
ent nature from the supposed character given it by the gen
Ueman     Instead of being a private inquiry into the conduct of
an editor, it was a public inquiry in íelation to a public matter?
commenced on this floor—not by himself, but by those now op
posed to it     i hough nominally a newspaper editorial, the pub
lication in question, upon its own face, was the work of the head
of the Post Office Department, and made m violation of the
íuleswhnh he prescubes for others    The article bears evi
dence upon its face of being the work of the Postmaster Gene
ral for «.contains three letteis which must have been furnish
ed by him foi publication and also assumes to speak of things
done, and not done m the Pot t Office Department, and which
implies a knowledge and contt ol of its pape s and archives   To
sh >w that the article was the work of the head of the depai iment,
Mi  B read the thiee letteis refei red to, constituting part of the
am le, and which be undertook to say must have come from
the Postmastei General    The first letter was that ot the Post
master General to the Senate's committee, answering then call
for the Chuichid recommendations, aid superadding a lecom
mendationof hisown     J his letter could be only furnished frr
publication by tl e membeis of the committee, oi the PoHmas
ter General himself    \ou heaid the answers of the two Sena
lois of the committee on yesterday   [Messrs  McRobert1* ird
Merrick ] that neither of them had given out copies, or auth i
ízed the publication    Thegentleme i are both piesent and can
speak foi themselves    (They signified assent from then seats )
1 his, then, lay*, the publication ol that letter at the door of the
Postmaster Geneial and shows him contributing to the article in
question  The nextletfei was the reply of the Senatui fiom Ilh
nois [Mr McRobbrts] to the inquiry into the publication of the
four letters in the St Louis papers, and which was addressed to
the Postmaster Geneial   Only himself or the benator from Ilh
noia—that is to say, the leceiver or the writer of the letter—
could have furnished it for publication and it may beassumed
that the writer did not    [Mi   McRoBrRTS said he had not ao
furnished it ]   Then, said Mr B   the Postmaster General mubt
have furnished it, and this constiu tes another item of proof that
he is the author of the article  The third letter is ihe one which
closes the article, and which it, referred to as being the proper
conclusion of the subject    It is the letter of the Postmastei
General to the Piesident of the United fcta es giving the Pres
idtntan account of the result of his application for a know!
edge of the publishei ot the Our letteis     This was a cor
reap ndence between the President and the Postmaster Gen
era!, it was between them one or theothermust have furnished
it foi publication, and the whole context oí the article, as well
as th  probabilities of the case shows it to have come froii the
Postmaster Gereial Neithei of these thiee letters ha 1 been pre
viously published in any paper    They appear for the fir&t
time m this publication, constitute part of it, and make the
staple of its argument    It is a first publication of their con
tents  the facts show t lat they could only come from the Post
master General, and, therefore, the article in which theyap
pear bears evidence upon its face of being hiswoik    This
was the first branch of hit* evidence to fix the publication upon
that officer
Mr B then leferredto the second branch of his testimony to
show the same thing and that also was internal and arose out
of the article itself—out of that part of it which assumed to
know what th< Postmastei General holds, to be the secret and
confidential archives of the department—to know what is mine
office and what is not in it and the mouvesand circuirá ai ces
under which an appointment was made He read from thear
tide (hese words He (Ml Benton) will not deriy that he
addressed President Van But en in Mr Watson s hekt lf}

them, and call for the original letter Two letters have been
produced, both falsifying this quotation I call for the rest, and

the affirmation, it must stand as the declaration of one who had
examined a letter of mine to Mr Van Buren andqaoted from
it the objectionable words placed between themveited com

Mi P then read farther from the aiticle
"He (Mr. Benton) will not deny that he then addressed a let

Mr B said those three letters falsified the publication referred
to mall its esbential points, and showed ihe danger and injus-
tice oi attempting to make seciets of the Post Office archives
keeping them ¡=ecret from those whom they concerned, and
publishing false and garbled accounts ot their contents' He
(Mr B)aveired there were no letteis of hi , of the character
