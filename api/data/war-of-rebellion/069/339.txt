HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,May 30, 1864 - 11.12 a. m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

Your dispatch of 10.15 just received. When I wrote you at 9 a. m. Major Morton was at my crossing of the Totopotomoy, going to the south of it, and I was told General Hancock's left extended to the stream. This must have been all changed, as he did not come over. I did not extend south on the other road. I have officers out now looking for the left of Burnside of Hancock. The picket-firing is well on my right. I have ceased to advance, and am pushing to the right again to feel and learn the country.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,May 30, 1864 - 12 m.

General HUMPHREYS:

General Griffin's skirmishers connect with General Burnside's, and I have given directions to press back the enemy's skirmishers. We have taken 3 prisoners from Rode's division, Ewell's corps, who say that his whole corps is entrenched about half or three-quarters of a mile on Griffin's front, which bring them nearly at Shady Grove. I have seen Colonel Forsyth, of General Sheridan's staff, and informed him of the position of my left.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,May 30, 1864 - 1 p. m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

I have no recent reports from my front. There have been a few cannon-shots recently. I think they were mine. One of the prisoners says it is Ewell that is sick, and in Richmond. He had heard it was Lee, But did not think that was so. At any rate Early is in command of the corps. The prisoners are North Carolinians, and I have sent them up.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.

GENERAL WARREN'S HEADQUARTERS,

May 30, 1864 - 1.30 p. m.

Brigadier-General RAWLINS, Chief of Staff:

General Warren's skirmishers are still advancing. He is in advance of the troops on his right. He has taken some more prisoners of Ewell's corps. They report earth-works about three-fourths of a mile from Griffin's line.

O. E. BABCOCK,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Aide-de-Camp.

MAY 30, 1864 - 2.10 p. m.

General HUMPHREYS:

There seems to be some mistake about the cavalry covering my left. General Crawford just sends me word that he sent a brigade
