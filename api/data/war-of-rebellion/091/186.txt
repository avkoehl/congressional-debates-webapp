General B. F. KELLEY:

A citizen arrived from Weston. The rebel force he represent as 600, mounted. I have nothing yet from direction of Buckhannon. They entered Weston about 4.30.

CITY POINT, VA., September 27, 1864-11 a. m. (Received 3 p. m.)

Major-General HALLECK,

Washington, D. C.:

From Richmond papers of yesterday I gather that firing was heard at Staunton on Sunday morning. People were leaving Staunton in great alarm. No troops have passed through Richmond to re-enforce Early. All that have left, so far as can be learned, are two regiments and a city battalion for Lynchburg. I shall make a beak here on the 29th.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

CITY POINT, VA., September 27, 1864-11.30 a. m. (Received 2 p. mm.)

Major-General HALLECK,

Washington:

I have said no more on the subject of opening railroad communication with Sheridan, because, whilst he is moving, it is hard to say where he will want it. If General Augur can protect the road to the Rappahannock, however, I think it will be advisable to open the road that far.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

WASHINGTON, D. C., September 27, 1864-1 p. m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT,

City Point:

The six Michigan regiments will not make three. A consolidation was ordered a week ago, but it is not yet completed, the fragments being scattered over the State. Sherman telegraphs urging that all new troops from the West be sent to protect his communications. These regiments, however, will by your orders be sent to City Point. No reply has been received from you in regear of railroads.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
