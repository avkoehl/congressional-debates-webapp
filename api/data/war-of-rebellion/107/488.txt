from and opposite to their left. On that side the rest of the country is much lower than our position or theirs. My examination of their flanks while occupying them in front has satisifed me that they are not so strong as we, except in cannon; that they were surprised by our approach; that their flanks are accessible, and that we can whip them, and for the purpose of forcing a retreat have probably done so already.

SEPTEMBER 25, 1861.

General W. S. ROSECRANS:

The enemy have not left us entirely, though they undoubtedly moved back part of their force. They still hold the position, and there are some signs of a gun on the bald hill I have mentioned, apparently with a view to protect their left flank. I will keep reconnoitering, but as much as possible without fighting, till you arrive. I have thought their actions indicated a disposition to leave the Lewisburg turnpike and move toward Blue Sulphur Springs.
