THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
February 6,
Mr. DAWES. If we could have any assur-
ance from the other side of the House that
they would not again leave us in a position
wanting a quorum I would withdraw the mo-
tion that there be a call of the House.
Mr. ELDRIDGE. I believe we have a right
to adjourn. I hope the gentleman from Mas-
sachusetts will consent to an adjournment.
Mr. DAWES. I will the momentthis matter
'.s brought before the House.
Mr. ELDRIDGE. I move the House do
now adjourn.
Mr. MAYNARD. Is it not permissible for
gentlemen who were in the Hall when the
roll was being called at this stage to have their
votes recorded?
Mr. DAWES. I do not ask any more than
that this subject be taken up and allowed to
go over till to-morrow.
Mr. ELDRIDGE. I rise to a privileged
question.
Mr. DAWES. I call for the regular order.
Mr. ELDRIDGE. I move that the House
do now adjourn.
The SPEAKER. The Chair will" call the
attention of the House to an interesting point
that has arisen under the rule, which the Clerk
will read.
Mr. STILES. Let it be read slowly.
[Laughter.]
The SPEAKER. The Clerk will read it
very slowly. [Renewed laughter.]
The Clerk read as follows :
" Pending a motion to suspend the rules, the
Speaker will entertain one motion: that the House
do now adjourn. But after the result thereon is
announced he shall not entertain any other dila-
tory motion till the vote is taken on suspension."
The SPEAKER. The Chair, after consult-
ation with the compiler of the Digest, on
whose opinion he relies in all cases of doubt
in regard to parliamentary law, would be com-
pelled to rule that the motion to adjourn is
in order. The vote having been taken on a
suspension of the rules discloses the absence
of a quorum. Should the Chair rule that
under those circumstances there was no power
to adjourn, then, though every one of the one
hundred and thirteen members present except
the gentleman who made the motion to suspend
the rules desired an adjournment, it would
be incompetent for the House to adjourn. The
Chair considers that it must be in the power
of the House, after the vote is taken which
discloses the absence of a quorum, to entertain
'i motion to adjourn. Of course it is for the
House to say whether it shall agree to the
motion. But it must be in the power of the
House, after the vote is taken, to determine
whether it will adjourn. And pending the call
of the House the gentleman from Wisconsin
[Mr. Eldridge] moves that the House adjourn.
The question was taken on the motion to
adjourn ; ana there were—ayes 43, noes 80.
So the House refused to adjourn.
Mr. ELDRIDGE. I may state that in mov-
ing the adjournment my object was merely to
have a construction put upon the rule.
The SPEAKER. The Chair has construed
it. The House having refused to adjourn, the
next business in order is a call of the House.
The Clerk will call the roll.
The Clerk proceeded to call the roll; when
the following named members failed to answer
to their names :
