time previous and, with the exception of the loss of 2 guns, was completely victorious. The enemy were badly beaten at all points of our lines, and retired before night-fall from our immediate front.

We captured from the enemy 481 prisoners, and buried of their dead over 400 bodies in front of our lines. Many of their dead we no doubt secured by them before retiring. The losses of the corps were 118 killed, 414 wounded, and 535 missing; aggregate, 1,067, and 2 guns. The troops engaged immediately in front of the corps were ascertained to be the old corps of General Hood, commanded by Major-General Cheatham.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. R. TOWNES,

Lieutenant Colonel, Asst. Adjt., General, and Chief of Staff.
