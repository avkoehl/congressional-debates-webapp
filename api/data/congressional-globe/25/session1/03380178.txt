25th Coi«&....1st Srss._______________Making public officers depositories—Mr. Pickew._________________________H. of Reps.
dwell upon particular'; now, jet I will lake occa-
sion to «aj to tho«e gentleman who were deeply lden-
t fled vv ith that institution, those gentlemen vvho were
the bitter po] tical opponents of the then President
of the United States what was the spectacle they
exhibited' When he asked for the sword of this
Government to be buried in the vitals of our peo-
ple, they came forward and gave it to him freely.
And wh}' Because they dreaded a revulsion
which would shake the credit sjstem, and that in-
stitution •with those who depended upon it, to the
deepest foundation Sir, no part of this country
under the mfluerce of a Bank of the United States
■Rill ever resia* the encroachments of this Govern-
ment, or the Givernment it«e'f, bonever despotic
it may be Sneh an institution then, connected
with this Government, to control the moneyed
power cf this countn, I confess I do dread i
confess I do look with dread and terror upon its
influences Sir, if you want to mike the Govern-
ment of this Union despotic, create a Bank of the
United States, and connect it with the destinies of
this Government, and my life upon it you can
nev er escape
You cm never resist this Government in the
nands oí the moncjed power of the country, and
the result will be that the fairest portions of this
Union will become tributary to othe1' and more
powerful sections
Mr Chairman, while making these observations,
I contevs that I will go as far a= any gentleman to
sustain those peculiar local institutions organized
by the States for their benefit, and to carry on their
commerce with the different sections of this coun-
tiy If they be properly organized, and limited
within proper bounds, I will go as far as any man
to sustain them, andgive them vigor, as long as they
a*, t upon bona fide capital, for the good of
the community, as well as for theirown individual
interest, such mstitut ons are essential to the present
state of commerce But while I say this, 1 am
compelled to jaj that I believe the banking system
of modern times, as oigamzed in different sections
oí th s cmnir), has any thing but a tendency to
el vate or give liberty to man Even this very
session we have heard gentlemen upon this floor
from the State of New York denounoe the manner
in which things have been conducted thete as dis-
giacetVil and outrageous charléis granted, stocks
3i>hibu ed, to pohtical partisans for political power
ai d escondan m
The minority theie, as m many other section^ of
the country, have been piactically reduced to po-
litical vassalagi, and it is idle to discuss or question
the fact, that stock opciations have been oigamzcd
with a sole view to sustain political power, and
m vke the labor of the country tributary to them-
selves
Now, sir, a gentleman fiom Massachusetts (Mi
Cnshmg,) not manydavs ago, warned southern
pentlemen, and declared tint the " progies-. of ia
dteahsm at the North was nothing more than the
progiess of abolitionism" Sir, I have thought of
th s nutter I have considered it with painful
arviety, and I ft el hound to pi e>ent what I con-
ceive to be the true interests of this countiy We
are a peculiar people, I admit We ow n nearly
one hall of out population We hold them by
physical force, and the law of necessity. I make
this liank and cand d avowal And I will here
take the occ ion to say that the connection which
ex sis belneen the slave-laborer and capitalists of
tlit South, is one of the deepest inteiest to the noctli-
ei i and middle sections of this Union We are
n fitted in the bona fide profits of daily labor, foi we
own not only the proceeds of laboi,but labor itself,
an 1 lint Government which interferes as 1 tt'e as is
possible, by anv cTtificial anangements, with the
management or proceeds of labor, is the Govern-
ncut for us, becpuse it leaves us in undisputed and
undivided control over all profits of labor
We are, then, in fict, capitalists standing in the
place of laborers, and are, to all intents and pur-
poses, laborers There is little or no separa'ion
with us of capitalists and laborers The} are, in
fdci, one and the same. The laborers of the non-
sUveholdmg States are interested also m the bona
fide (not spurious or doubtful) profits of daily labor.
The struggle of their capitalists (I speak ol pecuni-
ary interest, and ;t is nature) is to divide those pro-
fits with them Hence they resort to all the aviiA
cial modes known to Government, by which they
are brought to act with system and energy as one
man, through corporations of all sorts, and the most
important of whieh is the banking system You
pretend to give universal equabty and equal power
to all, and if this were practically earned into effect,
after society has gone through an era long enough
to be pressed down into its natural classifications,
the inevitable result w ould be in a conflict that la-
bor w ould make capital tributary, until it vv ould, m
the opeiation, change hands To prevent this,
where you profess to make all equal in political
power, you are compelled to resort t© those artifi-
cial combinations created by the Government, to
give jou that control which will enable vou to sus-
tain yourselves, and make your capital profitable,
bv the management of labor which your political
professions forbid you to own Now, sir, when
gentlemen preach up, as they have done for the
last three years, msunection to the slaves of our
community, I wain them that their own institutions
are not so pure as they might at first suppose, and
that I will preach up insuirection to the laborers of
the North, when the tendency of things is such as
to swindle them out of their power, by the fraud,
duplicity, and cunning oí modern times
As far as mere pecuniary interest is involved, the
relation oí capital and labor is the same as that which
exists Ihcre, in Great Bntainand every where else,
thatis,jnst to allow laborasmuch as is necessary for
subsistence, and to take the balance to divide among
themseh es, by all the inventions which the fraud
of Government can create. This will be finally the
interest of our northern capitalists They have no
standing armies to peipetuate this state of things,
as in other countries, and the consequence is, that
though they can not keep the laborers m physical
subjection, they are compelled to resort to banking
corporations and chartered institutions While
they preach to us universal equality and universal
emancipation, tney themselves are destined, if
unreformed, to hold m tribute not only the labor of
their own section, but also of this Confederacy
The tvo s} stems of subjugation which how
divide the woild, seem to be a resort either to/nrad
or fmce, by which one-half of mankind may íule
the other half.
Mr Jefferson proclaimed, thirty years ago, that
the demociacy of the north were our natural allies,
and there was piofound philosophy in that declaia-
tion When we contend for the undivided profits
and proceed? of our labor do you not see that we
stand precisely in the same situation as the laborer
of the north' We are, to all intents and purposes,
in the place of laborer  We are the only class of
capitalists, as far as pecuniary interest is concerned,
which, as a class, are identified with the laborers
of the countiy, while, at the same time, we
shall ever form a barrier against breaking up the
laws and foundation of society I know this
is a proposition which will strike lome men
with astoni hment, and I know, too, that I utter
words which bum But I know, sn, it is the
truth, and when these gentlemen expect to preach
up insurrection and rebellion to the slaves of our
country, I will preach back to them the same doc-
tune, by proclaiming universal equality, universal
puvi'eges, a universal right to northern laboiers to
be íedeemed from the fraud, duplicity, and cunning
by v htch they are destined to be made tributary to
those who wield capital, connected w th pohtical
putei The whole banking system ther" is a poV
tical substitute for the standing aroues of Europe,
without which the capitalists of the north would be
compelled to submit to a loss of pow oL
Su, these are my sentiments, an 1 I believe that,
as far as oui people are concerned, w e are nol
compelled to resort to those artificial institutions of
society by which non-slave-holding legions seek
to delude an 1 deceive their victims No, sir, we
avow to the vvsrld that we own our black popula-
tion, and we will maintain that ownership, if need;,
be, to the last extiemity
Mr Chairman, m maintaining these peculiar
sentiments, and in proclaiming the peculiar identi-
ty of interest existing between the capudists of the
slave-holding region, and the democracy of the
North, I am aware that I come under denuncia-
tion and am liable to the charge, from certain
quarters, of being a "loco foco " For maintain-
ing my own rights and interests, and the rights and
interests of those I represent, I may be called a
"loco foco," but this name shall never terrify or
deter me when the question arises, from maintain
ing the interests oí those with whom I expect to
live and hope to die And, sir, when gent'emen
tell me these things, I tell them I proclaim
the doctrines of Jefferson, that the democracy
of the north are the natural allies oí the
South, and this arises from peculiar interests
which I, for one, am not disposed to sacrifice
on thio floor " Loco foco'" Gentlemen seem to
raise up that name as a ghost to create terror and
alarm The progress and tendency of things to be
carried away by piejudices and paity feelings, are
monstious Why, oir, it was but the other night
that while holding a portrait of John Milton in my
hand, a very estimable fuend of mine looked at it,
sneenngly, and denounced him asa " loco foco'"
John Milton a loco foco '' And pray, sir, who
was he, but a man, the grandeur of whose soul,
and the sp'cndor of whose genius, breathed not
only inspiration into poetry, but threw a halo of
glory over those burning pages which he devoted to
English liberty1 Sir, it is nature for tho^e small
birds that hop from branch to branch m the shrubs
of the forest, to gaze with envy and hatred upon
the noble eagle, as he soars aloft in the sunbeams
of heaven, whose brow defies even the concentrated
iury of the elements, and whose eye scans in scorn
the earth beneath him If John Milton was a
" loco loco," then I, too, glory m catching, if I can,
one live coal from off that altai which he hallowed
and consecrated to the everlasting lights of man
Si , it I maintain the universal freedoai of the
white race, and the inalienable rights of man,
shall I be deterred from my position by the con-
temptible name of "loco foco''" The scribbling
wnters of the day mav call me what they please,
their denunciation have no teirors I scorn and
despise them
fVrhaps, Mr Chairman, in the sentiments I am
aboii. to utter, I may be considered as behind the
age, and they will be regarded as very stngulai, if
not unpalatable, by gentlemen raised fiom their in-
fancy in large cities, or under the controlling in-
fluence of newspaper essays But my excuse for
entertaining them is, that the people among whom
I was educated and trained up, are also peculiar in
their habits and then institutions, and partake more
of the impress of antiqmtv than of modern im-
provements And I confess to you, sir, that I feel
for them a lingering affection and attachment, be-
cause they were the customs and the habits
of those ancestors vv ho have given to us, all that
w e inherit m virtue and freedom I do not believe
much in the great blessings of your modern foims of
«ociety, and the great "improvements of the age "
I do not believe the intel'ectual and moral en-
dowments of man have been advanced oi elevated
of recent jcars. Sir, I admire the people who have
gone before us, and bequeathed and transmitted
examples worthy of our admnation It is true we
have more we ilth,more enterpnse,more speculation,
and mere of the gaud} ¿how, and pomp, and tempta-
tions of commerce and luxury, but as far as the
heart is concerned, as far as intellectual and moral
qualities arp concerned, I do not believe man has
advanced for the last ten years No, sir It may
be from m} peculiar situation that I entertain these
sentiments You have drawn together the world,
}ou have made your splendid works of improve-
ment, by which contented and remote parts of so-
ciety hat0 been drawn undei the temptations and
vicissitudes of speculation, you have your credit
and banking s}stem by which all Christendom has
been concentrated into one consolidated living
mass, and we have been brought by that s}stem to
bow in subjecjion before the banks and bankers of
London and Wall street, and we look with more
interest and admiration upon the movements of
Shylocks gathpied together in the exenanges of
commercial cities, than we do to those noble pages
of history which transmit to us the glory of arms or
oratory
Our people are consumed with avarice, deep, absoib
ing, unfeeling, mean avarice Yes, sir,selfishness,
hypocrisy, fraud, and cunning, seem to me to be
the great characteristics of modern times, instead
