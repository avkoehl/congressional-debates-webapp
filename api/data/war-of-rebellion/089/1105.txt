Lieutenant-General GRANT,

City Point, Va.:

I learn, form a letter of General Foster, that all able-bodied negroes brought in by Sherman are to be shipped to City Point. Permit me to suggest that they be armed, organized, and used in the Department of the South during the winter. Our experience is that negroes brought north during the cold weather from a warm climate are almost useless. Moreover, they suffer very much from cold. To send them north at the present time would create a panic among them, and prevent others
