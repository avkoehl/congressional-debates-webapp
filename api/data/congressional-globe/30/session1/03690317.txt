property in that kingdom <{more than the entire
amount of the national debt /"
If severe pressures upon the money markets of
highly commercial nations thus seriously affect the
value of property of all kinds, what reason could
I render the intelligent constituency which I have
the honor to represent in this House, if I were to
cast their vote in favor of renewing a huge system
of internal improvements in time of war, in time of
a large treasury deficiency, and in the face of a re-
stricted money market and an adverse foreign ex-
change? None, sir; none.
This Government ought not to enter the market
at this time for a solitary dollar not indispensably
necessary to the preservation of its honor. It is
cruel to do so at a time when States, cities, rail-
roads, canals, individuals, and corporations arc
vigorously struggling not only to relieve them-
selves from the consequcnces that overtook them
in the financial catastrophe of 1837, but to prepare
honorably to sustain themselves in that generous
competition now everywhere manifest, to excel in
all that is desirable and right.
By a wise, vigorous, and patriotic effort, the
business circles will be able, I hope and believe, to
supply the Government of the United States with
the means it will find really indispensable, at mod-
erate rates, and without producing serious finan-
cial derangements. But if to these indispensable
loans arc to be added others, devised to carry out
ill-considered schemes to construct harbors in differ-
ent and distant States, at difficult, nearly unknown,
and but little frequented landings, it becomes the
duty of this House to inquire whether it were not
better to leave to the several States, or to resident
citizens, the taskoffoundingand beautifyingtowns,
villages, and cities, and of opening and maintain-
ing the roads and canals, and all other avenues
of approach to them, rather than to embarrass the
Government and the people with a burden not
legitimately their own. If, upon this day, citizens
residing upon the beautiful shores of the Chesa-
peake, and others upon the banks of the majestic
Lake Superior, and others still upon the Gulf
coast, resolve to lay out and build up villages or
cities, is their right to come here, in time of war,
to demand of this body an appropriation to con-
struct for their use, and for the use of such as ma|
desire to trade with them, either a road, a canal, or
a harbor, sufficiently clear to justify us in the eyes
of the people of this country in granting their
request, at the known risk of deranging the
markets and of depreciating the prices or all the
property in this country? But if those citizens,
thus far removed from each other, and located
where cities may well be expected to arise, had
commenced (instead of to-day) one year ago, or
ten, or twenty, or a hundred years, and had
actually erected one or many buildings, could it
be «aid that so mandatory are the provisions of
the Constitution, we must, at the peril of rendeiing
money scarce, and labor cheap, and property un-
salable but at depreciated rates, borrow large
sums of money at large rates of interest, and
increase the taxes of the people to pay it, in order
to build the asked-for road, canal, or harbor?
If the Constitution does thus order us to make
such expenditures for the benefit of isolated indi-
viduals or of local communities, and at the ex-
pense of all the rest of the people, in times of war
and of pence, of prosperity and of adversity, atalf
hazards, and in defiance of all the maxims of com-
mercial experience, I have failed to read it aright.
If the Constitution does not positively order us to
borrow money, in time of war, to clear out rivers,
construct harbors, build roads, dig canals, drain
swamps, build observatories, and establish uni-
versities, then we ought to abstain from these
things, if thedoing of them will be injurious to the
credit of the Government, and ruinous to many of
the interests of the citizens; for all good govern-
ments were instituted for the good of the governed,
and their acts, general and singular, should ever
be in harmony with this, the principle upon which
they were founded.
I cannot vote, m time of war, to borrow money
to engage in a general system of internal improve-
ments. I cannot vote to borrow money to be ex-
pended to please a few towns, when, by so doing,
1 know that I am placing all the property of all the
citizens of tins great country in imminent danger
of depreciation." The interests of the many should
not be made to depend upon the schemes and the
wishes of the few; nor with a hope of benefiting a
few persons, a few villages, a few cities, or even
several important States, should the property of
all the citizens be exposed to probable loss.
But. in the next place, if we were not engaged
in war—if we were not in the money market,
forcing weaker parties to pay higher rates of in-
terest in consequence of our unwelcome intrusion
—has not the past legislative action of Congress
been such, towards certain cities, as to render the
adoption of such a system an act of injustice to
those cities? I think it has, and will, with the
permission of the House, submit a few reasons in
support of this opinion.
Several cities and towns have had their harbors
improved, or wholly created, at the expense of the
treasury of the United States—to some, the appro-
priations have been complete; to others, partial.
But the greater number, the principal part, of the
harbors of the United States, have never been the
subjects of Government attention. If improved at
all, they have been improved by those who have
an interest therein.
Baltimore is one of the most important cities of
the Republic, and has been so from the period
when this Government was organized. As it is
important to the argument which I propose to sub-
mit to be able to prove this, I have obtained from
the Treasury Department a statement showing the
amount of revenue collected at the'port of Balti-
more from the year 1789 to 1847, both years inclu-
sive ; also a statement showing the amount of
revenue collected at all the ports of the United
States during the same period.

DANIEL GRAHAM, Register.
This table shows, that from 1789 to 1800, both
years included, the revenue of the United States, col-,
lected at all the ports, amounted to ,..$59,,402,458 60;
of this amount, $7>661,519 98 was .collected at the
port of Baltimore—being nearly one-eighth of the
whole. It is thus seen that about one-eighth of
all the revenues of the Government of the United'
States, during the first eleven years of its existence,
was derived from the port4of Baltimore !
The next seven years snows a total revenue of
$88,216,704 43; of this, there was collected at Bal-
timore $8,301,266 13—being nearly one-tenth of the
whole.
By looking at the table, it will also be seen that
more than one-half-—in fact, more than five-ninths—
of all the revenue of the United Spates was col-
lected at Baltimore in the year 1815!—the whole
amount being $7,282,942 22: collected at Balti-
more, §4,052,132 90! Beginning with 1815, and
going down to 1820, (five years,) and we sec a
total revenue of $107,333,159 35; of this, no less
a sum than $11,902,945 55 was collected at the port
of Baltimore—being about one-ninth part of the
whole!
Take still another period. From 1825 to 1831,
both years included, the revenue from Baltimore
(the net revenue, after deducting all expenses)
exceeded annually one million of dollars ! The
revenue received from Baltimore by the United
States, after deducting all expenses of collection, in
fifty-seven years, amounts to the stupendous sum
of fifty-five millions seven hundred and sixty-
one thousand five hundred and ninety-seven dollars
and sixty-se>en cents, ($55,761,597 67)—a sum
which would have constructed our canal to Cum-
berland, and our railroad to the Ohio river; created
a laige school-fund; improved our harbors; con-
structed and maintained our light-houses, and
greatly assisted to defray the expenses of the State
and the city governments.
This is what Baltimore has actually contributed
to the common fund for the promotion of the com-
mon good and the general welfare. And what has
she received?
I hold in my hand a statement from the Treas-
ury Department, which shows that in fifty-seven
years $55,000 have been expended by the United
States upon the harbor of Baltimore! Not a thou-
sand a year for a port from which nearly fifty-six
millions of dollars have been received!
And now let us examine the justice and the
equality of the general system of internal improve-
ments sought to be established in the midst of this
war. And let us judge of it, not by what its ene-
mies prophesy as likely to grow out of it, nor by
the promises which its indiscreet friends make for
it; let us judge it by the past. The past may be
known—the future cannot be.
Under the revenue system, eight hundred and
ninety millions of dollars have been collected by
the United States; of this sum, $9,837,894 58
(neat ly $10,000,000) have been expended by Gov-
ernment in the prosecution of works of internal
improvement. If Baltimore had received its pro
rata share of the money expended oil improve-
ments, estimating according to what that port con-
tributed to the treasury, as compared with sister
ports, no less than one-sixteenth part of the ten
millions of dollars would have been expended at
Baltimore.
Now, sir, instead of having $625,000 expended
in our city, we have had but $55,000 ! If, there-
fore, we are to prosecute a general system of inter-
nal improvements, the old plan of expending
moneys will not suit Baltimore, however well it
may work elsewhere. For, of the $10,000,000,
it contributed $625,000, and obtained $55,000! It
would be infinitely better for us to make our own
improvements; though 1 can easily understand ivhy
persons living in distant portions of the republic,
paying little or nothing, and receiving moneys
collectcd from the pockets of my constituents,
should entertain a different opinion, and insist that
it is to our interest to pay $625,000 in order to"
obtain $55,000! Pay twelve dollars in order to
receive one back!
Maryland surrendered to the United States the
right to impose taxes upon the flourishing com-
merce of Baltimore, in order, amongother things,
il to ensure domestic tranquillityV'and ii to provide
for the common defence" against foreign aggres-
sion. These duties have been satisfactorily per-
formed—at least to an extent as great as can
reasonably be expected from a government in-
trusted with duties so difficult and extensive. Our
flag has been nobly upheld in the face of all nations,
