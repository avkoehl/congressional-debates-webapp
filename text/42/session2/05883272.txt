PETITIONS AND MEMORIALS.
Mr. WILSON presented two petitions of
late soldiers and sailors of the United States
volunteer Army and Navy, in favor of the pas-
sage of a bill to provide industrial homes and
training schools lor the orphans of the soldiers
and sailors who served in the Army or Navy
ol the United States during the war of the re-
bellion ; which were referred to the Committee
on -Military Affairs.
Tho VICE PRESIDENT. The Chair de-
sires to state that yesterday he received a peti-
tion by telegraph from the chairman and sec-
retary of a committee of one hundred of San
Francisco, on the subject of the bill in regard
to Goat Island, objecting to it, and protesting
against some non-publication in the newspapers
of protests they have heretofore sent.
Mr. COLE. I ask that it be read, and pub-
lished in the Globe.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator
from California desires this to be laid on the
table, and printed in the Globe.
Mr. CAMERON. I object to that.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator
from Pennsylvania objects.
Mr. CAMERON. I think it would be a very
wrong precedent to have telegrams read here
to operate on the proceedings of this body.
Mr. COLE. Then it had better be read.
The VICE PRESIDENT. If objection is
made, the Chair will reserve it, for he does
not desire to obtrude petitions sent to him
upon the Senate. In his opinion, they should
be sent to the Senators representing the States.
Mr. MORRILL, of Vermont. I am directed
by the Committee 
Mr. CASSERLY. Allow me to ask the
Chair what disposition was made of that peti-
tion?
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Chair stated
that he had received a telegraphic dispatch
which has the signatures in writing of Richard
G. Smith, chairman, and Albert Wheeling,
secretary, but written' of course by the tele-
graph operator, complaining of the non-public-
ation by certain newspapers of the Associated
Press of some protests sent on by telegraph in
opposition to the bill in regard to Goat Island,
and also opposing that bill, and asking the
Vice President and the Speaker of the House
to lay this before the Congress of the United
States by order of the committee of one hun-
dred. The Chair has always doubted whether
telegraphic dispatches could be regarded as
petitions; but as he was requested t,o lay this
lietore the body, he asked consent to do so.
There was objection to that; and the Chair
stated that these petitions should be sent really
through Senators when the States are repre-
sented. There appears to be objection, the
Chair understands, to this petition being thus
transmitted through the Chair.
Mr. CASSERLY. I regret the objection.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator
from Pennsylvania [Mr. Cameron] objected.
Mr. CASSERLY. The course has been
frequently followed since I have been in the
Senate, at least several times, of having a
memorial by telegraph read as though it had
been regularly forwarded by mail.
Mr. SHERMAN. The objection is not to
the presentation in the form of a telegram,
because that has been done many times ; but
by the Vice President, who is not a member
of this body. The Vice President can hand
it to either of the Senators, and they can
present it.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Chair will,
with great pleasure, hand the petition to either
of the Senators from California; and they can
test the question before the Senate, as the
Chair could not, because he cannot debate
questions of that kind as a member of the
body, which ho is not.
Mr. FliELINGHUYSEN presented the
memorial of the Presbyterian society of Dal-
ton, Georgia, praying compensation for a
church building alleged to have been de-
stroyed by United States troops ; which was
referred to the Committee on Claims.
He also presented the petition of William
H. Hendrickson, president of the board of
visitors of the agricultural college of New
Brunswick, New Jersey, praying Congress to
bestow a further grant of land to certain scien-
tific and polytechnic institutions in the various
States of the Union which received the ben-
efits of the congressional act of July 2, 1802,
for the promotion of colleges of agriculture
and the mechanic acts ; which was leferredto
the Committee on Education and Labor.
He also presented a memorial of citizens of
the United States, protesting against any
