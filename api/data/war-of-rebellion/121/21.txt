NEW YORK, January 4, 1865.

Major General H. W. HALLECK, Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: I have the honor to inclose certain papers* relating to General Beall's case, having referred to them in a letter this day sent. My attention was called to the matter of the sign some days since, but knowing that it was a small tin sign attached to the glass door on the inside, I did not object to it and am, perhaps, myself at fault. If the weather permits we shall go to Fort Lafayette to-morrow, unless I hear by telegraph from you in reply to my telegram of this date.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

HALBERT E. PAINE,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers.

NEW YORK, January 4, 1865.

GENERAL: I have the honor to state that I called at General Dix's headquarters to-day, and learning the cause of the order, hope to be able to get it changed. Will you meet me at General Dix's headquarters at some hour as soon as possible convenient to you? Please answer.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WM. N. R. BEALL,
