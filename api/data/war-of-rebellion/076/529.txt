August 16, 1864.

Major- General SHERMAN

General Garrard came back last night. He had some fighting with the rebels. He found them in force, about seven regiments. They fell back behind breast- works. Some rebel cavalry passed our flank about Cross Keys yesterday. They killed one man on picket. I presume General Garrard has already reported.
