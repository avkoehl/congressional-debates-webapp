HARRISBURG, November 22, 1861.

Honorable THOMAS A. SCOTT,

Assistant Secretary of War:

The Anderson Troop is ready, except carbines. Can you not give them to the troops or order them purchased? We have purchased no arms, but have expended $ 70,000 in repairing guns of the State which are in service. This troop should have carbines, and do make an effort to get them immediately. Answer this immediately, and my dispatch of yesterday.

I gave Mr. Palmer orders upon the Ordnance Department for all his arms. Your message of last night was answered early this morning.

HARRISBURG, November 22, 1861.

Colonel T. A. SCOTT,

Assistant Secretary of War:

You gave Palmer an order for pistols and sabers, but not carbines, of which you are having over 100 per day made at Hartford. This company should by all means have the carbine, according to the request of General Anderson, appended to the original plain of organization. Pennsylvania has furnished 12,000 stand of arms for the service of the General Government, and asks as a matter of reciprocity that you should at least arm this company properly. Please answer saying that Palmer may make a requisition on General Ripley for the 100 carbines. They want to move very shortly.
