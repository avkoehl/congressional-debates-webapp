If they have not been paroled in accordance with General Orders, Numbers 100, which I think doubtful, they are to be arrested at once, returned to Nashville, and reported to Brigadier-General Granger for duty.

Major Martin telegraphed from Glasgow that reliable citizens report Forrest this side of Cumberland River with a large force. I have given him instructions to ascertain the facts, and hold himself and command in readiness to fall back to this point if large force approaches Glasgow. Colonel Strickland requests that the remainder of his regiment be ordered to join him at this place.

Send out reliable scouts in direction of Tompkinsville with instructions that they are to give you timely information of the approach. In the mean time have everything in readiness to fall back to this place. It would be well to send the stores, if any on hand, in wagons
