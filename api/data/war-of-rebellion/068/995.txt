HEADQUARTERS,Drewry's House, May 12, 1864-12.30 a.m.

Honorable J. A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War:

Your dispatch ordering me to Richmond has been received. I will send one brigade by the boats and march the other by the turnpike.

R. RANSOM, JR.,

Major-General.

MAY 12, 1864-10 p.m.

Major General R. RANSOM,

Richmond:

The strength of the enemy in my front prevents a division of my forces. If you could join me here and we drive them immediately in my front it would protect this place and Richmond, and at the same time would cut off the retreat of the enemy, who have gone toward Chesterfield, and also be of advantage to Petersburg. Major Branch writes me from Chesterfield Court-House that 3,000 cavalry, with six howitzers, passed there this evening for Bellona Arsenal, on the Danville road, and from there they expected to go to Richmond on the river road.

R. F. HOKE,

Major-General.

MAY 12, 1864-11 o'clock.

General BRAGG:

Barton left 10.45. One hour loading from inconvenience of barges. Next column reported miles off. No time will be lost.

FRANK S. PARKER, JR.,

Aide-de-Camp.

MAY 12, 1864-9 p.m.

General B. BRAGG,

Richmond:

Have just received your dispatch. It has been suggested to me that it refers to the movement of General Hoke's old brigade. That brigade moved from here this morning across the pontoon bridge, but whether it went to Richmond or Chaffin's I do not know.

Very respectfully,

G. H. TERRETT,

Major, Commanding Post.
