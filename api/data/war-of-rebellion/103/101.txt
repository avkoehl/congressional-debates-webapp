GENERAL ORDERS, HDQRS. MIL. DIV. OF WEST MISSISSIPPI, Numbers 40. New Orleans, La., April 23, 1865.

The following General Field Order is republished for the information of all concerned:

GENERAL FIELD ORDERS, HDQRS. ARMY AND DIV. OF WEST MISSISSIPPI, Numbers 32. Mobile, Ala., April 22, 1865.

The major-general commanding thinks it proper to announce as the general results of the operations around this city: The capture of the enemy's works as Spanish Fort and Blakely; the surrender of Mobile; the capture of more than 5,000 prisoners, 12 flags, nearly 300 pieces of artillery, several thousand sand of small-arms, and large stores of ammunition and other material of war.

It is his province to report results, that of a higher authority to bestow appropriate commendations and rewards; but it is not improper to express his personal thanks to the officers and men of this army for their zeal, energy, and gallantry, and to the officers and men of the navy for their hearty and zealous co-operation in the work that has been accomplished. He begs that the Sabbath next ensuing the receipt of this order may be made the occasion of thanks giving for the past, and prayer for the future; and that all will unite with him in the earnest petition that God in his mercy will deal tenderly with the relatives and friends and friends or our dead and wounded comrades.

By order of Major General E. R. S. Canby:

C. T. CHRISTENSEN,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Assistant Adjutant-General.

By order of Major General E. R. S. Canby:

C. H. DYER,
