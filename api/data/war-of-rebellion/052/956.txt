therefore I moved to clear out the whole of East Tennessee of the enemy's forces and destroy their salt-works in Southwest Virginia. While in the execution of this design I received an order from the President to move to your support. My command is now being concentrated, and I will soon be prepared to move in accordance with one of the three subjoined plans*, which I have submitted to the General-in-Chief for his decision, and upon which I would like you to furnish him with your views.

You may rest assured that any call for support will receive from me as hearty and willing a response as it is possible to render.

Honorable E. M. STANTON:

To avoid the delay of a full compliance General Orders, Numbers 238, can authority be given to accept resignation of volunteer-officers, and suspend any balance of pay due until they can furnish the paymaster with evidence that they are not indebted to the Government?

Major-General BURNSIDE:

Since my dispatch of yesterday to Halleck (copy sent to you), a considerable force of the enemy is reported opposite Washington. I rely on you to protect my left flank. It is obvious they should not be allowed to separate us.

The mass of the rebel cavalry have crossed the river about Washington, and you will have to close up your force and cut them off. We have sent ours, and you will have to close with them.
