the branches to take each other's notes, why should
a branch demand a premium on a check' This
view proved conclusively that the universal cir-
culation of the paper of the United States Bank
was not owing to its accommodating disposition,
but to the causes which he had mentioned. If the
bank did not charge the same rate of premium on
exchange which the brokers in New York and
Philadelphia charged, how could the brokers exist
in those places > Why did any person resort to
the bank > From the flourishing condition of the
brokers in the neighborhood of the bank, he was
led to the conclusion that exchange was afforded
as cheap by the brokers as by the bank. Why,
he would ask, should not the notes of a local de-
posite bank, paying specie for its notes, giving
weekly statements of its condition, its notes being
also receivable in payment of dues to the Govern-
ment, be quite as current as the notes of the United
States Bank> Would the people have no security,
if his plan were adopted' They would have the
same security for the safety of the deposites which
the charter of the United States Bank gave them.
The condition of the deposite banks would be
made known in the same manner But it may be
said that these reports are not alone sufficient, and
that the charter of the United States Bank offered
other security by the appointment of Government
directors But these were merely nominal direct-
ors The Government has dnectors, but they
can know nothing of the concerns of tjje bank, be-
cause all information is denied to them Of this
lact we had the most conclusive evidence It came
to us in such a manner that we should do violence
to oui judgmental supposing that the Government
directors had any direct paiticipation in the man
agement of the institution But wei e not the State
bank's, under the management of individuals, quite
as respectable and trustworthy as the United
States Bank > Were they not also accountable to
the Legislatures in their respective States > Were
they not under the d rect supervision of the people,
through their Legislatures' They were directly
amenable to the people, who were affected by the
management of the institution The United States
Bank was amenable to the people of the Union But
an act done at that boaid might be justified by nine-
t nths of the Union, and the tenth portion, to whom
the act was mjunous, would have no ledress An
act which was injurious to the interests of Alabama,
might be approved of in New York, or in other
northern cities The people, therefoie, could be
better secured in their rights through the immedi-
ate responsibility of the State banks, than through
th e general responsibility of a national bank This
liability, connected with the safeguards which he
had refei red to, would afford perfect security to the
people of the nation
It was said that the whole commercial interests
of the countiy would be piostrated by the meas
ure which he had advocated     But if the commer-
cial prosperity of the country depended upon the
amount  of capital  emplojment, no such  effect
could take place     Not a cert of capital would be
annihilated by the meaeuie   The riere withdrawal
of capital from one bank, and its tiansfer to others,
did not dim nish the capital of the country to the
amount of a single cent    The amount of revenue ¡
would be the same whether it was received by the
State bank or a national bank, and it was likely I
that the local banks would make as much use of |
it as the United Stptes Bank would make     What
inducement would the local banks have to with- |
1-old discounts5   The people would have the same |
use of then own money, and it wou'd be distrib- .
uted more generally than it would if deposited in
the United States Btnk     He might be told that (
the íate of .exchange wou'd be so injuriously af-
fected by the measme,  that internal exchanges
could not becarncdon     Mr M went on to show I
that though the equalization of exchange was one
of the objects for which the United States Birk
was bro ight into existence, yet the bank had not
effected this obiect     In 1832 and 1833, the bank
íeceived from premiums on  e^hat ge $217,24}
The bank  by this,  course had violited tne gieat
principle on which it was founded     In support of
this view, he read a passage from a letter of Ml
Crawford     The universality of the cuirsncy of
the United States Bank enabled it to carry on e\- ,
changes at a low rate of premium, but the local |
deposite banks, when they have, from similar
Government facilities, the same general currency
for their notes, will be able to effect the internal
exchanges at the same low rates.
Mr. M. would now proceed to the last view of
the case Gentlemen seem to think that the whole
business of the country rested in the hands of the
United States Bank They forget that there is
any private capital in the country. They forget
even what the organ of the bank had announced,
that the distress of the community was not so
much owing to the withdrawal of capital from the
bank, as from the want of confidence which it
produced He would ask gentlemen not to come
to the supportof General Jackson's measures, but
to come forward, at this crisis, and arrest the fur-
ther progress of bank tyranny—to come forward
and assist in restoring the lost rights of the people.
We are told that we are in the midst of a revolu-
tion, and he concurred m the opinion. A mighty
struggle was going on between the people and
the bank, between money-powei and the rights
and liberties of the people The people had
made up the issue, and they would abide by it.
They know that it was m the power of the bank
to bring much suffering and calamity upon them,
but they would meet it all as they would the pri-
vations and toils of a war declared for their inde-
pendence
Mr CLOWNEY rose and obtained the floor
The hour allotted for the consideration of res-
olutions having expired, the ordei of the day was
taken up
The House proceeded to the orders of the day,
and took up the bill making
APPROPRIATIONS TOR FORTIFICATIONS.
The question thereon before the House being a
motion submitted by Mr McDtirFiE to commit
the bill to the Committee of the Whole on the Btate
of the Union—
Mr McD remarked, that he had been induced
to submit his motion in consequence of the bill
having passed thiough the House without objec-
tion The bill being in its final stage, he wished
to have it committed that it might be in the power
of the House to reject such of the appropriations
for places which, upon full discussion, would be
found expedient Withaviewtoascrtam whether
theie was any spuit of economy existing in the
House, he would call for the yeas and nays, which
were ordered
Mr  POLK would not then enter in any dis-
cussion upon the policy of the system of fortifica-
tions,, but he wished to remind the House of the
state of the present bill     It has been regularly
reported with the usual appropriations, and there
had been appropriations made in it for four new
works, for which some small appropriations had
been made the last session   A portion of the money
had been expended preparatory to their comple-
tion    One was intended for the protection of Bos-
ton harbor, nnothei at New Orleans, and one at
Foster's Bank, Flonda, which was part of the |
system of defence for Pensa-ola     It was for the I
House, then, to consider whethei they would go on
with these works or have them prostrated   It was
deemed important that these should be completed,
andaltbougntheapproprmt onforallthoseplacesm I
the aggregate exceeded thatcf last y eai by J,G4,000,
yet it was less than the appropriations made in |
odiei years for these purposes     The defence of
the countiy must mainly be aided by such fortifi-
cations, and he had been given to undeistand that i
the contemplated works were most important
Mr WILDEob.ectedtothewholesystem which
had been adopted for erecting and supporting forti-
fications foryeais past, and said heteared that the
gentleman from South Carolina had fallen upon a I
wiong subject to expect that cooperation fiom the
House which it merited on the gi ound of economy
He maintained that as the foitifications were now
extended, they could not Le sufficiently manned or
aimed in less than twenty years, and that as they
were useless in a time of peace, they must, when
unarmed, he more pernicious than anything else
in the even  of any sudden «a'
Mr CAMBRELENG, although he differed in |
opinion on this subject with the honorable mem-
ber fiom Souih Carolina, expressed his 1 ope that, I
m order to acce'eiate the passage of the bill, ihe j
motion to commit would be a'ceded to     He de-
sired that every oppoitumt} should be given for I
inquiry into the expenditures of the country, ard
he did not think that when these inquiries were
made that the excess complained of would be found
in the appropriations made for the support of the
army or navy, but in the appropriations made by
the House on other subjects.
Mr. PINCKNEY said, unless the bill was com-
mitted, he would be compelled to vote against it;
but whilst he fully agreed in the policy of support-
ing fortifications, as it appeared there had been
large met eased appropriations, it was necessary
that some economy should be practised. That it
should be looked into whether any of the places
might be abandoned with propriety, whether there
was any immediate necessity, from the state of the
country, for the appropriations now made.
Mr. P. was proceeding on the general subject,
when—
The SPEAKER interposed, and said it was not
in order to discuss it.
Mr. PINCKNEY resumed,and said he wished
to state he desired the commitment of the bill that
he might move an amendment to strike out the
clause in relation to the appropriation for a fortifi-
cation in Charleston, $50,000, which was utterly
useless unless it was intended that they should be
used, as they had been, not outward to the ocean,
but against the citizens themselves He could not
vote for any fortifications in Charleston, whilst
the force bill was in existence They had enough
of tyranny from the Federal Government, and he
would stand upon the Constitution, and put the
question at once, whether there could be any forti-
fications erected without the consent of the States
themselves He would submit whether it was in-
tended to erect these forts without the consent of
the State, asked or obtained If so, he maintained
it would be a gross infraction of the agreement en-
tered into between the several States
Mr WAYNEcould not recognise the propriety
of recommitting the bill unless it could be speedily
pointed out that there was extravagance in any of
the appropriations made, and that the recommit-
ment might be thus found necessary He did not
believe that the obseivations that were made by
the honorable member from South Carolina [Mr
Pinckney] would find any corresponding voice in
the House It seemed to that gentleman, that the
contemplated works were foi the protection of
Charleston alone This was not so The im-
portance of that harbor in a time of war, as con-
venient to the West Indies, was of the highest
older The Government was acting on a general
system for the benefit of those to come after them,
as well as with a view to their present safe'y
Mr McKAY went into some statements to show
that the appropriations for fortifications were in-
creasing in amount He advocated the recommit-
ment, that there might be a more regular and eco-
nomical appropriation made than we had been in
the habit of having The increase appeared to be
since 1831, at the rate of twenty five percent upon
the first item in the bill, for the pieservation of
Castle Island He ti usted that the bill would be
recommitted, that the esumates submitted by the
engineers for these various foitifications should be
mqjired into He was going into the general
subject, when—
'lhe SPEAKER reminded him he was not in
order
Mi PARKER said, as there appeared to be in-
stances in which the appropriations made last year
for the preparatory measures, were not applied,it
might induce the Committee of the Whole to see
that there was no necessity for appropriations
being made for the completion of the works them-
selves
Mr VANDERPOEL said, although he believed
he should vote for the bill, yet, undei the circum-
stances under which the House had been placed
latteily, he did not think that the request of the
honorable member from South Carolina, masking
for a delay, unreasonable, and particularly when
it was stated that it had passed sub sikntw He
could not see that there could be any objection \s>
a sciuttny by the Committee of the Whole into a
bill which appropriated so large a sum as $800,000
There might be some membeis who might object
to appropriations for particular places, for, although
willing to swallow a single oil!, it did not therefore
follow that they should swallow an apothecary's
shop.
