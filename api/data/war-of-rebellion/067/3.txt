stand thus; General Warren's corps at Spotsylvania Court-House; Hancock's at Todd's Tavern; Sedgwick's on road from Piney Branch Church to Spotsylvania, and General Burnside at Alrich's. It is not yet demonstrated what the enemy will do, but the best of feeling prevails in this army, and I feel at present no apprehension for the result. My efforts will be form a junction with General Butler as early as possible, and be prepared to meet any enemy interposing. The result of the three days' fight at Old Wilderness was decidedly in our favor. The enemy having a strongly entrenched position to fall back on when hard pressed, and the extensive train we have to cover, rendered it impossible to inflict the heavy blow on Lee's army I had hoped. My exact route to the James River I have no yet definitely marked out.

If matters are still favorable with Butler send him all re-enforcements you can. The enemy now moving from our immediate front either to interpose between us and Fredericksburg or to get the inside road to Richmond. My movements are terribly embarrassed by our immense wagon train. It could not be avoided, however.

NEAR SPOTSYLVANIA COURT-HOUSE,

May 10, 1864 - 9.30 a. m. (Received 7.45 a. m., 11th.)

The enemy hold our front in very strong force and evince a strong determination to interpose between us and Richmond to the last. I shall take no backward steps, but may be compelled to send back to Belle Plain for further supplies. Please have supplies of forage and provisions sent there at once and 50 rounds of ammunition (infantry) for 100,000 men. Send General Benham with the necessary bridge train for the Rappahannock river. We can maintain ourselves at least, and, in the end, beat Lee's army, I believe. With present position of the armies, 10,000 men can be spared from the defenses of Washington, besides all the troops that have reached there since Burnside's departure. Some may also be brought form Wallace's department. We want no more wagons nor artillery.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
