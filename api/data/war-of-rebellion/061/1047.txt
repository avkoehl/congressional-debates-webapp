HEADQUARTERS CLARENDON EXPEDITION,Camp near Bayou De View Bridge, june 28, 1864.

Shelby is still going north. He made a turn toward the bridge, crossed Caney, and a first made me believe he had crossed, but my cavalry has followed him 8 miles above the bridge, and he still going and gaining on us. It is impossible to catch him with infantry, and I have only 750 cavalry. He has about 1,500 men and 4 guns. I have captured 2 guns, one of them navy; wounded about 60 killed about 12, and captured 2. Colonel Shanks, First Missouri (rebel) Cavalry, has his leg amputee. My loss, 1 killed, 16 wounded. My infantry has not touched him since the first day, through I have pressed them to the utmost. Many are reported sunstruck; their shoes are many of them soaked to pieces going through mud and swamps, and some of them left their rations on the first battle-field. Neither my cavalry nor artillery horses have had a feed of grain since we started, and some of the artillery are unshod. Finding it impossible to catch him, fearing to be drawn too far north, I have determined to return, and expect to be at Clarendon to-morrow, 29th, before noon. Please send boats for the troops with rations and forage.

2.15 p. m.- Shelby may cross the bayou still farther up, and may go on north; in any case, he should be attacked from Missouri. My cavalry will keep up the pursuit as long as they will let them, probably all day to-day, and then come in to Clarendon.

June 29, 1864 - 8.20 p. m.

COLONEL: I have just arrived. My troops are en route and will arrive here in the course of the night, as the boats can get in. Do you wish any of my troops to come to Little Rock; if so, what part? Please answer this to-night, as they are loading the cars with stores. My cavalry left a point 8 miles above Bayou De View bridge last night at 12 o'clock. Shelby passed there yesterday morning; had abandoned a wagon, sponge staff, and some harness. That point is fully 40 miles from Clarendon. His artillery had not yet crossed the bayou, but some of hi troops had. Tyler, Platte Valley, and Gladiator, with bearer of dispatches, left Clarendon at 5 o'clock this morning for down river. Emma Numbers 2 is to leave here for Memphis in an hour. What news?
