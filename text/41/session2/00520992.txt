He also presented the petition of R. H. Rid-
dick, of Suffolk, Nansemond county, Virginia,
praying the removal of his political disabili-
ties ; which was referred to the select Com-
mittee on the Removal ofPolitical Disabilities.
He also presented several petitions of citi-
zens of Virginia, praying for the abolition of

lie on the table.
Mr. VICKERS presented three petitions of
citizens of Maryland, praying for the abolition
of the franking privilege; which were ordered

zens of Delaware, praying for the abolition of

of citizens of New York, praying for the abo-
lition of the franking privilege; which were

He also presented the petition of members
of the Cigar-makers' Union No. 90, of the city
of New York, praying a duty of three dollars
per pound and fifty per cent, ad valorem on all
imported cigars; which was referred to the
Committee on Finance.
Mr. EDMONDS. I have, I believe, six
petitions praying for the abolition of the frank-
ing privilege, which I am advised by those
learned in the law were sent from this city in
violation of law, but are returned in conform-
ity with law. I move that they lie on the table.
The motion was agreed to.
Mr. EDMUNDS. I also present, or rather
ask the Senate to advise me of the propriety
of presenting, a petition of a widow of a Boldier
of the Army of the United States, by the name
of Rosina Lenzingen, who represents that she
now resides in the republic of Switzerland.
She asks for a pension. We have granted pen-
sions to the widows of several soldiers of Swiss
origin who served in our war; but, if I am not
mistaken, there is some rule or usage of the
Senate which denies to foreigners the right of
petition. Am I right about that?
The VICE PRESIDENT. It has been so
decided three times in the Senate.
Mr. EDMUNDS. Then, I suppose, it would
not be proper for me to present it. I will en-
deavor to find some other method of bringing
it before the Senate.
The VICE PRESIDENT. If no Senator
interposeB an objection, as the petitioner is
the widow of an American soldier, the petition
might be received by unanimous consent.
Mr. EDMUNDS. I will ask unanimous
consent to have the petition presented and
referred to the Committee on Pensions.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Chair hears
no objection, and it will be so referred.
Mr. EDMUNDS also presented a petition
of citizens of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania,
praying that a pension may be allowed the
surviving soldiers of the war of 1812, and also
the widows of Such as are deceased; which
was referred to the Committee on Pensions.

of the Danbufy and Norwalk Railroad Com-
pany, praying for a reduction of the duties on

mittee on Finance.

izens of Connecticut^ praying for the abolition
of tfe&iranking privilege; which were ordered
to iieon the table.

REPORTS OP COMMITTEES.
Mr. SHERMAN. I am directed by the
Committee on Finance, to whom was referred
the bill (S. No. 380) to authorize the refund-
ing and consolidation of the national debt, to
extend banking facilities, and to establish
specie payments, to report the bill back with
an amendment in the nature of a substitute. I
ask that it be printed; and I will move to post-
pone the further considerationpf it until Mon-
day, the 14th of February, and I hope to get
the attention of the Senate to it then until the
matter is disposed of.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator from
Ohio reports from the Committee on Finance
Senate bill No. 380, with an amendment in
the nature of a substitute, and moves the post-
ponement of its further consideration until the
14th instant, at one o'clock.
Mr. TRUMBULL. I should like to inquire
whether the postponement of the bill to that
hour would give it precedence on that day ?
The VICE. PRESIDENT. It would not if
there were unfinished business of the preced-
ing day.
Mr. TRUMBULL. If there be no unfinished
business, will it have precedence over any
other business? If so, 1 must object to it.
The VICE PRESIDENT. By the usage of
the Senate it would not give it any priority,
unless it was made a special order, which will
require a two-thirds vote.
Mr. TRUMBULL. It is not moved to make
a special order.
The VICE PRESIDENT. It is not.
Mr. SHERMAN. I suppose that the gravity
of the subject itself will call it to the attention
of the Senate as soon as the Senate is ready
for it.
Mr. TRUMBULL. I presume it will; but
I wish to say that I am charged with some two
or three bills from the Committee on the Judi-
ciary that I hare been trying for a month to
get the attention of the Senate to, and I think
they ought to be considered.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Chair under-
stands that this is only a notice.

Offices and Post Roads, to whom was referred
the bill (S. No. 402) to amend an act entitled

indefinitely postponed; which was agreed to.
