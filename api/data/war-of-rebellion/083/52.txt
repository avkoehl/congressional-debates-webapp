Numbers 3. Reports of Colonel James H. Ford, Second Colorado Cavalry.

INDEPENDENCE, MO., July 7, 1864.

(Received 8.30 a. m. 8th.)

CAPTAIN: Captain Wagoner, Company C, scouting from Raytown, with twenty- five men, was attacked by Todd with over 100 guerrillas, well armed, about two miles south of the Little Blue, on Independence and Pleasant Hill road. Captain W. and 7 man killed, 1 wounded. Enemy's loss we do not know. They took the coach and carried off their dead and wounded. Enemy immediately retreated into eastern Jackson and western La Fayette, dividing up into small squads as usual. Our foot scouts killed 2 on their retreat, 1 dressed in Confederate uniform. We hope it is Todd. They were collecting for the purpose of attacking General Totten and myself en route from Pleasant Hill to Independence. We came via Hickman Mills to inspect troops at that place. The skirmish took place Wednesday, the 6th, just at 2 p. m.
