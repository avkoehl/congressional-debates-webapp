NEAR ATLANTA, July 12, 1864.

General BRAXTON BRAGG,

Richmond:

The enemy holds several fords from eight to twelve miles above, where he has troops intrenched on this side. Elsewhere everything quiet, except a little occasional skirmishing at long range across the river, and artillery firing by the enemy, principally near railroad, ineffective.

Major E. S. BURFORD,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Wheeler's Corps:

MAJOR: I am just in receipt of your note of this evening. The enemy are in statu quo in my front. This force is small and chiefly of infantry. Two hundred or 300 mounted men came up the Isham's Ferry road about two hours ago, but after a few shots from my pickets went back. Some scouts who went some days ago with Captain Humber across the Etowah have returned. They killed and wounded 12 Yankees and got their horses. The captain is badly wounded himself.

Respectfully,

JNO. S. WILLIAMS.

P. S.-I will send out my remaining scouts at once.

J. S. W.
