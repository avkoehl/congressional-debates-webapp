THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
same direction. They might not always quite
overtake it, as caution was necessary; but they
approximated it. Wheat, which before the war
was at $1, has been $2 50 when gold was 250,
and is now over $2 per bushel when gold is at
about 200. Beef was from $8 to $10, now at
$10 to $20; and so of everything else. Certain
theorists are in the habit of attributing this to an
inflated currency. This, in my judgment, has
had much less to do with it than isgenerally sup-
posed. If that were so, prices would not fluc-
tuate with the fluctuations in the gold market;
for th'e volume of currency does not thus vary.
The merchant holds his goods higher or lower
as the price of gold rises or falls. He marks and
re-maiks them according to the thermometer of
the Israelites in the gold-room, not according to
the contraction or expansion of the currency.
I know that when the currency is unduly ex-
panded it raises prices. When too much con-
tracted, prices fall. It makes not a particleof dif-
ference whether that currency is in coin or in paper.
California has never had any other but a gold
currency, but prices have always been double
those east of the mountains. The sole cause was
that gold was abundant there. The circulating
medium was larger than the business required.
The effect would have been precisely the same
had her currency been paper.
The currency is never inflated so long as there
is no more than is necessary for the business of
the country. The proper quantity depends not
on a fixed amount, but on the quantum of busi-
ness. I do not believe that our currency is swollen
much beyond the necessary amount. Before
the war our circulation in coin and bank notes
was about $400,000,000. Our circulation now is
about $600,000,000—I doubt if the actual circu-
lation is so large. A lai\°;e portion of the legal
tenders are hoarded. When lately the banks
took a loan of $50,000,000 they had great diffi-
culty in procuring sufficient legal tenders to fill
it. The compound-interest notes are nearly all
placed as investments.
But suppose the circulation to be one third
larger than before the war. Does not the busi-
ness of the counti y requite double the amount of
currency that it did then? The Government con-
tracts then were about $80,000,000, including all
her expenses. They are now at least $900,000,000;
and 1 believe that individuals—including new
branches of contracts in the loyal States, to-
bacco, petroleum, &c.—are quite as large as then.
Our merchants then required about $90,000,000
to pay their duties. They now require of our
cutrency $300,000,000.
I behove, therefore, that we have no more cir-
culation than is necessary to carry on the in-
creased business of the nation. The exorbitant
prices are not, to any great extent, at least, due to
excessive circulation, but to the vicious stand-
ard of value erected by Congress when, having
demonetized coin, they made the commodity of
gold the measure of all other commodities; and
which, being in so small a volume, enabled spec-
ulators to control the whole business of the coun-
try, and play havoc with the interest of the na-
tion. In times of suspension the amount of cir-
culation has very little influence on prices; the
discount line of the banks has much more to do
with it. Then banks discount on their capital
and deposits, thus flooding the country with
money easily obtained. Take, as a sample, the
state of the Philadelphia banks on the 20ih of
this month. Their discount line was nearly
$49,000,000, while their circulation was $4,856,-
771, and specie was $1,569,223; their capital
$13,740,000, and deposits $37,141,910. Here
was no inflation of the currency, it was notone
fourth the amount of theircapital. But there was
a monstrous inflation of their loans. If gentle-
men had directed their taxation to depositsinstead
ofcirculation they would have shown more states-
manship. Had all our loans been for lawful
money there wouid have been no difficulty in
having them taken at six per cent, at par. All
" lawful money " being received for duties and in-
terest. U was said they wouid never have been
taken abroad. That to me would have been a
merit. The annual net earings of this country
would have been sufficient to absorb all our loans
and pay ail the expensesof the war. Now what
is sold abroad is sold at forty dollais on the hun-
dred, and we immediately pay §100 in coin for it
as interest, and must ultimately pay $100 princi-
pal for every $40 received when specie payments
are resumed. What an immense sacrifice to a
foolish theory!
But that evil is now upon us, and in order to
sell our present loan, payable in lawful money,
we miist make it as desirable as the past loans.
I think eight per cent, interest, irredeemable for
ten years, will accomplish that object. In my
judgment it will be the most advantageous loan
for capitalists yet issued. We have three kinds
of loans:
1. The five-twenties, interest payable in coin,
redeemable at the pleasure of the Government
after five years, in lawful money, and payable ab-
solutely in twenty years in money.
2. Ten-forties, redeemable in ten years at pleas-
ure of Government, and payable in forty years,
principal and interest, in coin, at five per cent.
3. Seven-thirties, interest in money and con-
vertible in three years into five-twenties, or re-
deemable in money.
Let us take up these several loans and see if
the present one, while it relieves the Government
from the payment of coin, is not the best for
holders. Suppose gold to remain at 200, the five-
twenties will bear twelve percent, for three years,
which they have yet to run, and will then be paid
in money. Of course, thereafter it is to be in-
vested in a six per cent. loan. One hundred dol-
lars, at twelve per cent, for three years, will be
$36; and for seven years,at six percent., $42: ten
years, equal to $78. At eight per cent, for ten
years it would be $80.
The seven-thirties are payable in money, and
therefoie less valuable than are eight per cent,
stock, as they are not convertible until the five-
twenties will be payable in currency, or near that
time.
The ten-forties are the only ones about which
there can be a doubt, as the interestand principal
are both payable in coin after ten years at five
per cent.
Now their comparative value depends entirely
upon the time when we shall resume specie pay-
ments. If we should resume specie payments in
three years, as most financiers believe, then the
money in which the interest and principal of the
ten-forties will be paid will be no better than that
in which this loan of eight per cent, will be paid
—both will be coin—while for three years the
ten-forties will bear five per cent, gold, equal to
ten per cent, at present price of gold, yet for the
balance of the ten years, that is, for seven years,
they will bear five per cent., and this loan will
be eight per cent. The account will be thus:
ten per cent, on $100 for three years will he $30;
five per cent, for seven years, equal to $35, $65;
eight per cent, for ten years $80—$15 in favor of
the eight per cent, bonds.
This is supposing gold to remain at 200. But
if thesegold-bearing bonds can be stopped where
they are, and those out be converted, and the
duties paid in lawful money, gold would fall to
par, and this loan for ten years would be three
per cent, better than the ten-forties and two per
cent, better than the five-twenties. It seems to
me that all the outstanding gold-bearing bonds
would soon be converted.
I suppose no capitalist would desire more for
his money than eigiit per cent., especially if that
could be secured for ten years. It would be much
better than an interest whose rate depended upon
the varying prices of the gold room.
Can we afford to pay eight percent? I have sup-
nosed our debt would ultimately be $4,000,000,-
000, and $3,500,000,000 would bear interest. We
should always have half a billion that would bear
no interest. The interest would be $280,000,000,
to which must be added $100,000,000 for ordinary
expenses, making $380,000,000, to he provided
for. 1 think that no one can doubt that our
present internal tax law, when properly executed,
will produce $320,000,000; and our duties, when
payable in money, at least$150,000,000; making
$470,000,000. This would leave a surplus of
$90,000,000 for a sinking fund. If we stop where
we are, with gold-bearing bonds we can manage
our interest without any increase in the price of
^ Our gold-bearing interest is now $63,000,000.
it will be increased a little when the seven-thirties
areconverted. With our foreign demand we may
need $70,000,000. i have no doubt that our
average duties while payable in coin, will be
$80,000,000.
With $2,000,000,000 of our debt at six per cent,
or bearing no interest, of which $29,000,000 of the
interest is payable in currency, suppose it be in-
creased to $2,000,000,000 more at eight per cent.,
being $160,000,000, the amount would stand: e*old
bearing bonds, interest say $70,000,000; which
would be paid by duties thus squaring it:
Present debt beaming currency interest $29,698,000
Interest on §2,000,000,000, at eight per cent 160.000.000
Leaving to be provided by interna! datfes 189,698,000
I believe our pie&eut internal tax will produce 320,000,000
Leaving a balance for a sinking tund of. 130,302,000
Doduct ordinary uxpenbes... 100.000,000
$30,302,000
This supposes no conversions.
Some have suggested that the value of our cur-
rency would be affected by the amount of our
taxation; that the price of greenbacks would rise
and the price of gold fall just in proportion as we
lay burdens on the people. 1 think my excellent
colleague from Vermont [Mr. Morrill] fell into
this notion.
1 think there never was a balder fallacy. No
doubt thevalue of our bonds depends on thecoo-
fidence which the people have m our solvency.
But so long as we raise sufficient revenue to pay
the interest on the public debt, and the people
confide in the ability and will of the Government to
pay, taxation can have no influence on the rela-
tive value of legal tenders and coin. Now, there
has never been a day since this war began that
the people have not had perfect confidence in the
ability and disposition of the Government to pay
all its liabilities. There never has been an hour
since our first tax law was passed that our rev-
enue would not pay all our accruing interestand
ordinary expenses. At this day, with our new
tax law in full operation, our revenue will be
quite sufficient to pay our ordinary expenses
and the interest on the full amount of debt after
two years more of war accumulations,unless we
should continue to make that interest payable in
com. In that event it will pay just about half
of it. Yet notwithstanding that ability and pub-
he confidence, the price of gold has not been
affected by taxation.
Some of our tariff friends are almost reconciled
to the high price of gold because they think it
acts as a protection to domestic industry. In this
I think they are mistaken. The price abroad
of goods is not raised as ours is. It remains
the same as before the war. The duty is paid
on the foreign valuation. Hence the amount,
though payable in coin, is small compared with
the price when once imported. The enormous
price here pays the importer a larger profit, not-
withstanding the gold duties. Hence importa-
tions are not discouraged by the high price of
coin.
Suppose before the war the price of an article
abroad was $100, the duty twenty-five per cent.
It would cost, exclusive of charges, $125 here;
if it brought here $150, the net profit would be
$25. Now, the price abroad is the same, $100;
uut the duty being (in currency) twice as much
would make the cost here $150. We know that
every article is more than twice the price it was.
It would sell for $300; deduct the $150, and it
would leave a profit of $150 instead of $25.
Let us sum up the result of the argument.
The interest, payable in com, after our loans
already authonzed arc taken, will be about $70,-
000,000. This will be paid by the coin received
for duties, say $70,000,000, so that they balance
each other. *
