Major-General HUMPHREYS, Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: Two deserters from Cobb's (Georgia) Legion, who left their command yesterday morning, just arrived here. They are natives of Maine; have lived south about five years, and about three weeks ago were conscripted. They state that a few days ago they overheard the officers of their regiment talking about the strength of their cavalry force. They concluded that there were not more than 4,500 mounted men in Hampton's command, and about 2,000 dismounted. I think, however, that their estimate in regard to dismounted men is rather small. There are 100 mounted men and 400 dismounted in Cobb's Legion. The Seventh Georgia has about 40 mounted and 350 dismounted. Dearing's and Gary's brigades are nearly all mounted. They left their brigade yesterday morning on the Vaughan road about six miles from Reams' Station.
