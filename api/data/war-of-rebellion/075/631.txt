Major- General SCHOFIELD:

I will probably come down to- day, and in the mean time will send Captain Poe to study out the flank movement, if we must make it that way.

Major- General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE TENNESSEE,June 28, 1864.

Major- General SHERMAN:

I have no news of importance this morning. Have not heard from Garrard, but have sent to him for report. Blair lost 175 killed, wounded, and missing in his two divisions yesterday; Dodge about 35; and no official report from the Fifteenth Army Corps.

JAS. B. McPHERSON,

Major- General.
HDQRS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, Kenesaw, June 28, 1864.

General McPHERSON:

Is there any news on your flank! How long will it take you to load up and be ready to move for ten days, independent of the railroad!

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major- General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE TENNESSEE,June 28, 1864.

Major- General SHERMAN:

Nothing of importance on this flank to- day. The usual amount of artillery and picket- firing. Enemy appears to be in about the same strength as usual on the mountain and around the eastern slope. I will be ready to move as soon as the cars can bring me six days' rations and five days' forage.

JAS. B. McPHERSON,

Major- General.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, near Kenesaw, June 28, 1864.

Major- General McPHERSON:

You may send back all your wounded; fill up your wagons with food and ammunition; get your troops well arranged to be moved toward either flank, and then I will determine which direction to move. In the mean time watch the enemy close about the southwest base of Kenesaw, of r I think General Schofield's position will force Johnston to attack or move to the river.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major- General.
