that our pickets at Millstone Point had been driven in. I am awaiting here until the strength and intentions of the enemy are known. In the meantime can you not send us some forage and rations very soon, as my command is out of both?

WM. W. AVERELL,

Brigadier-General.

SIR JOHN'S RUN, August 4, 1864.

General KELLEY,

Cumberland:

Report proved false. I have ordered the arrest of the officer who sent it, together with his pickets. If you can send me some rations and forage now I shall lose nothing by the delay, as I desire to be out three or four days and we are destitute. Answer.

WM. W. AVERELL,

Brigadier-General.

Your request will be promptly complied with.
