It is difficult at all times to estimate in advance
the probable receipts into the Treasury for the
next one and two years. Our revenue being de-
rived principally from duties on imported mer-
chandise entered at the custom-houses for con-
sumption, the amount is necessarily dependent,
not only upon all those causes which affect trade
and commerce, but on such as control the inclina-
tions.and ability of the people in the purchase of
such merchandise for consumption.
Ordinarily an approximation can be made to
the probable result, provided no unlooked-for
cause shall intervene to disturb the usual course
of trade and consumption.
The events of the present fiscal year furnish a
striking illustration of the uncertainty of all such
estimates from the operation of unforeseen causes
which exert a controlling influence over the rev-
enue from customs.
When the estimates for the present fiscal year
were made to the last Congress by my predeces-
sor, it was impossible to foresee either the mate-
rial change in the rates of duty, which were
among its last acts, or the present revulsion in
trade and commerce, both which have deeply
affected the revenue, and satisfactorily accountfor
the difference between his estimates and those now
submitted. With these two disturbing causes now
in view, it is very difficult to form satisfactory
estimates of the probable receipts from customs.
The tariff act of March 3, 1857, has not been in
operation long enough to test its effects upon the
revenue, even under ordinary circumstances.
Simultaneous with this act going into operation,
the country is subjected to a disastrous revulsion.
To what extent importations would have been
affected by it, had there been no revulsion in trade
and commerce, is now as much a matter of con-
jecture as it was before the passage of the act.
Experience has thrown no light on the subject.
The probability is that it would, to a limited ex-
tent, have increased importations, though not to
the extent of supplying the deficiency created by
the reduction of the duties.
In submitting to Congress, under these circum-
stances, estimates of the receipts for the present
and the next fiscal year, it is deemed proper to
accompany them with a statement of facts and
principles upon which they have been made, in
order that Congress may pass its own judgment
upon the credit to which they are entitled.
The exports and imports of the United States
have always borne a relative proportion, the re-
spective amounts not often differing materially
from each other. Both have steadily insreased,
with occasional exceptions, with the growth and
progress of the country. In seeking, therefore,
to ascertain the probable importations into the
country, the amount of our probable exports
constitutes an important clement in the calcula-
tion. The exports for the year ending June 30,
1857, amounted to $362,949,144, and the imports
for the same period were $360,890,141. The
amount of our exports depends not only on the
quantity, but the value of the articles exported.
The quantity of some and the value of others
may be considerably diminished, and yet the
deficiency thus created may be supplied by either
the increased quantity or value of other articles.
It is probable that this very state of things may
occur during the present fiscal year. The indica-
tions at present are, that the exports of bread-
stuffs and provisions will decrease both in quan-
tity and value; but the increased value of cotton,
at its probable prices, which constitutes much
the largest item of our exports, would make up
such deficiency. Prom the best information
which can be obtained, the opinion is entertained
that the exports for the present fiscal year will
not fall below those of last year more than ten
per centum.
Looking to the importations for the last ten
years, it may be safely stated that the ratio of
annual increase has not been less than ten per
centum; though, withm that period, there were
two years in which there was a falling off. This
was attributable, doubtless, to temporary causes
which do not affect the general proposition.
The foreign merchandise subject to duty im-
poitcd during the first quarter, ending 30th Sep-
tember last, of the present fiscal year, by the
statement marked 3, amounted to $88,819,385;
and the customs received during that quarter
were, as stated in the estimates, $18,573,729 37.
1 he tariff of the 3d March last having gone into
operation on the first day of that quarter, the
circumstances under which a considerable portion
of that amount was realized were so exceptional
as to form no satisfactory guide for the remaining
three quarters of the present fiscal year; and it
becomes an important consideration, in view of
the probable means in the Treasury to meet ex-
isting appropriations, to approximate the amount
of merchandise subject to duty which will be
entered for consumption during that period.
In making the estimates herewith submitted,
the amount of merchandise subject to duty im-
ported during the corresponding three quarters of
the lastfiscal year were taken, being $210,000,000,
to which ten percentum was added for the annual
increase, had there been no disturbing causes—
giving for the amount of merchandise paying
duty, under the then existing tariff of 1846, an
aggregate of $231,000,000.
The inquiry now presents itself—to what ex-
tent will this approximated amount of merchan-
dise paying duty be diminished by the revulsion
which has come upon the country ?
An answer to this inquiry constitutes the
most serious difficulty in the way of making an
estimate of the receipts into the Treasury from
customs. Looking, however, to our probable
exports, the great resources of our country, its
unexampled prosperity in many branches of in-
dustry, its capacity to recover from temporary
pressure in its trade and business, the opinion
is expressed, with some confidence, that the re-
duction from this cause will not exceed twenty-
five per centum. This would bring the amount
of merchandise paying duties down to about
one hundred and seventy-four millions for the
remaining three quarters of the present fiscal
year. For several years the average rate of duty
upon all dutiable merchandise, by the tariff of
1846, appears to have been within a fraction of
twenty-five per centum, which would produce
on that amount $43,000,000.
The next point of inquiry is—how much will
this sum be diminished by the reduced rates
provided by the act of March 3, 1857?
From the calculations made of duties under
that act upon the importations of the last fiscal
year, compared with the amount of duty actually
realized under the tariff of 1846, it appears that
about one quarter should be deducted for the
effect of the tariff of 1857. Ten million dollars
have, therefore, been deducted on that account,
making the probable receipts from customs, du-
ring the remaining three quarters of the present
fiscal year, thirty-three millions, which has ac-
cordingly been placed in the estimates.
It will, of course, be understood that the re-
turns of dutiable merchandise, from which these
inferences are drawn, are of merchandise im-
ported, while the customs revenue is exclusively
derived from merchandise entered for consump-
tion. In these estimates the amount of merchan-
dise imported is supposed to equal the amount
entered for consumption. In periods of commer-
cial difficulty, like the present, the amount of
merchandise imported and placed in warehouse
without payment of duty will, no doubt, exceed
the amount entered for consumption; but such
excess is generally temporary, and is soon ob-
viated by diminished importations and increased
withdrawals for consumption, which restores the
equilibrium without giving occasion for the dis-
cussion of such details in any general statement
of the revenue.
The receipts from customs for the next fiscal
year, from July 1, 1858, to June 30, 1859, will
depend, in a great measure, upon the extent to
which commercial and monetary transactions
shall have returned to their ordinary channels.
It is probable that the immediate effects of the
present revulsion in trade will have ceased by that
time, and that the usual amount of dutiable mer-
chandise will be required for consumption. The
estimate submitted is based on the amount of
three hundred and seventy millions of dutiable
merchandise, being the amount assumed for the
present fiscal year with the usual increase, and
without any deduction for the effects of the pres-
ent revulsion. Upon this amount the customs,
under the act of 1846, with the deduction hereto-
fore explained for the effect of the tariff of 3d
March last, would produce about sixty-nine and.
one half million dollars.
The annual estimates in detail, as prepared by
the Register of the Treasury, are presented sep-
arately by this Department. These estimated
expenditures are divided into three classes.
1. Balances of unexpended appropriations
which may, and probably will, be required by
the respective Departments in the course of the
next fiscal year.
2. Expenditures under indefinite and permanent
appropriations. In this class was placed the
standing appropriation made by the joint resolu-
tion of February 14, 1850, of $2,450,000 for ex-
penses of collecting the customs. It is proposed
to change this permanent appropriation forannual
appropriations of increased amounts, for reasons
set forth in another part of this report. In the
mean time, as the proposition has not been sanc-
tioned by Congress, the estimate remains in this
class.
3. In the third class are comprised the estimates
