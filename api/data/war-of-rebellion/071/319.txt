(Received 12. 36 a. m. 15th.)

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

I have just received the following dispatch* from General Kelley. The line is now open to Sandy Hook. Our agent reports that General Sullivan arrived at Harper's Ferry last p. m. from Martinsburg. Our agent at Monocacy reports a portion of General Howe's forces is as far east as Sugar Loaf Mountain, and as far as he can learn there is no enemy north of the Potomac, west of Monocacy River. I judge you can now reach General Hunter, as our whole line appears to be covered by telegraph to Sandy Hook, and courier thence, his location being now not distant from that point. General Howe is stated to be at Harper's Ferry, and he can, therefore, also be reached by telegraph. I have urged reports from them direct to your Department, which, I trust, have reached you. I hope that during the 15th our telegraphic communication will be perfected over the entire route.

J. W. GARRETT,

President.
