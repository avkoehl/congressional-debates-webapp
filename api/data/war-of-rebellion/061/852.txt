MARCH 24 - 31, 1864. - Expedition from Batesville to Coon Creek, Devil's Fork of Red River, &amp; c., and skirmish (27th) near Cross-Roads, Ark.

Report of Captain Albert B. Kauffman, Eleventh Missouri Cavalry.*

CAMP STEELE, Batesville, Ark., April 1, 1864.

SIR: In pursuance of instructions from regimental headquarters Eleventh Missouri Cavalry Volunteers, March 23, 1864, I took command of a detachment of 200 men and 6 officers to accomplish certain purposes therein expressed.

March 24, 8 a. m. - I left Batesville with command, fording White River at Ruddle's Ford. From thence I pursued a westerly direction to near the mouth of Wolf Bayou, crossing Wolf Bayou, thence in the same direction across to and up Briar Creek, some 4 miles. At this point I discovered fresh signs of horsemen. At a house near by I learned that Britewell, with a command of about 50 men (rebel), had passed down the creek some two hours previous, the men giving out as they passed they were going to the swamps. As my horses had but little feed for the last forty-eight hours, I considered it imprudent to follow with uncertain results. Leaving Briar Creek at this point I intended to move in a westerly direction across to Coon Creek, distance about 8 miles, where I expected to find forage, but just on rising the mountain from Briar my guides lost the trail, and turning off to the left led me in a southerly direction. Discovering soon their error, I sent one of them back to discover the trail, but returned without being able to find it. Proceeding on the route south-southwest, over a mountainous and broken country, some 7 miles, I found myself at Dr. Martin's, near the head of Wolf Bayou, some 8 miles out of my direction. From Dr. Martin's I proceeded in a northwest direction 8 miles to Johnson's, on Coon Creek. From Johnson's the road passes over a high and abrupt ridge for 2 1/2 miles, descending on Coon Creek at McCarle's, where I arrived at 7 p. m. and camped, having marched since morning 34 miles. I here found plenty of corn and fodder for my command. I also found four sets of Government mule harness in his possession which he had hid in the mountains in a turkey-pen, being part of the gears captured by Rutherford from Captain Castle. McCarle has a good mill which grinds for Richwoods and neighborhood. Weather cloudy, and rain during the night.

March 25, 2 p. m. - Marched in a northwesterly direction 3 miles, and encamped on the mountain above Coon Creek. Sent a scout back some 10 miles to bring up two jaded animals abandoned on the road the day before. The scout returned with one, the other not being able to travel. Near camp the men found a cave containing some 300 pounds of ham and bacon, which they confiscated. Found corn and fodder at Hesse's for the horses.

March 26, 7 a.m. - Marched in a northwesterly direction 6 miles to Kemp's, near Richwoods. Found Kemp absent from home hiding out from the Federal troops. Captured his negro man attempting to escape with a horse; also Mr. Fullbright, formerly of Springfield, Mo., who attempted to escape on the approach of the troops. Kemp has seven loads of corn hid in the mountains one-half mile northeast of his house. Sent out scouts to the northwest and west; found Copeland's men (rebel) ranging through the country, but scattered.
