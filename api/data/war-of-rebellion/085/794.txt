FORT LEAVENWORTH, October 11, 1864.

Major General J. G. BLUNT, Paola:

Send to Colonel Ford, Pleasant Hill, information of matters generally. Also that men go out this morning to repair telegraph beyond Independence. Also that Major Pritchard telegraphs from Kansas City that guerrillas, 100 or 200 strong, are concentrating on Big Blue, near Hickman Mills.

Major-General.

PAOLA, October 11, 1864.

Major-General CURTIS:

Many of the militia coming in are not armed. Captain Clark, ordnance officer of Fort Scott, informs me that he has 2,500 stand of arms and ammunition of all kinds. Had not 1,000 stand better be sent here at once? Answer.

Major-General.

PAOLA, October 11, 1864.

Major-General CURTIS:

I would respectfully suggest that all the force in the State, both regular and irregular, except what will garrison important points against a small force, be concentrated as rapidly as possible at this point and Olathe, and at once take the offensive against Price by moving into Missouri. I believe this the only way by which Kansas can be saved from invasion. We will then be in force and prepared to move down the border on his flank, in case he moves south. In my opinion, the militia that are ordered to Fort Scott and Mound City should be ordered here. I do not believe Price will venture north of the Kansas River, but will strike as far up on the south side of the river as he can. Please answer and let me know your views.

J. G. BLUNT,

Major-General.

FORT LEAVENWORTH, October 11, 1864.

General BLUNT:

Of course Price is to be meet; when and where will depend on his position and our collection and organization. This latter business should occupy your whole attention now. Price was at Boonville in force last night, probably advancing on Lexington. I have referred the matter of arms to Major McNutt. The arms can be placed in the hands of Federal officers, who must have some charge of militia who use them. This is the order from Washington, which Captain Clark must try to operate.

S. R. CURTIS,

Major-General.

PAOLA, October 11, 1864.

Major General S. R. CURTIS, Fort Leavenworth:

Have you any knowledge of the strength of General Sanborn's forces in Price's rear, and what amount of cavalry has he?

JAS. G. BLUNT,

Major-General.
