HEADQUARTERS FIRST ARMY CORPS, March 23, 1865.

Admiral SEMMES,Commanding James River Squadron, Chaffin's:

General Longstreet directs me to inform you that a Federal deserter reports the enemy are about to make an attack by land and water on the north side of the James. Porter with the fleet was to have come up last night. The attack is expected to take place at any time.

O. LATROBE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIRST ARMY CORPS, March 23, 1865-2 a.m.

Lieutenant-General EWELL,Commanding Department of Richmond:

GENERAL: General R. E. Lee advises General Longstreet that the enemy is preparing along his whole line for a movement. He thinks he will demonstrate on one flank and attack on the other. He desires General Longstreet to be ready to move with all the men he can liberate from the trenches to any point attacked. You will make all arrangements to put the troops of your command in the works around the city at a moment's notice. Early advices will be sent you of any advance of the enemy against the north side of the city. Your lines would only be threatened by cavalry, and our cavalry would be ordered to co-operate with you. Our infantry will probably all be required elsewhere and will not be able to afford you any assistance.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

O. LATROBE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

What number of dismounted men have you and what number has Rosser? Rosser is under your command.
