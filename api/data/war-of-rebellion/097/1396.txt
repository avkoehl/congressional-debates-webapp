FAUQUIER, April 21, 1865.

SOLDIERS: I have summoned you together for the last time. The vision that we have cherished of a free and independent country has vanished, and that country is now the spoil of the conqueror. I disband your organization in preference to surrendering it to our enemies. I am no longer your commanders. After an association of more than two eventful years, I part from you with a just pride in the fame of your achievements and grateful recollections of your generous kindness to myself. And now at this moment, in bidding you a final adieu, accept the assurances of my unchanging confidence and regards.

Farewell.

J. S. MOSBY,

Colonel.
