From this place we changed our direction northeast, crossing the Catawba River at Rocky Mount on the evening of the 23rd. Here, and for several days following, we found the roads almost impossible from the heavy rains that fell. We camped near Hanging Rock on the 26th of February.

On the 3rd of March we reached Chesterfield Court-House, and on the 6th we passed through Cheraw and crossed the Great Pedee. Continuing our direction northeast, reached Fayetteville, N. C., March 12. From this point we crossed the Cape Fear River, arriving at Goldsborough, N. C., March 24, after being fifty-seven days on this inland campaign, and marching about 400 miles.

In conclusion I beg leave to thank the officers and men fro the uniformity and willingness in discharging their duties. It was a trying campaign; our marched were long and exceedingly tiresome.

Accompanying please find a list of casualties. * I had four men captured, one of whom was with the regiment, who was captured near the last camp. I sent him out with a few others for forage. The other three were detached men, of whom I am unable to give the particulars.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

HDQRS. 147TH PENNSYLVANIA VOLUNTEER INFANTRY,Near Bladensburg, Md., May 29, 1865.

SIR: In compliance with orders received I have the honor to submit the following report of the part taken by the regiment in the campaign after leaving Goldsborough, N. C.:

On Sunday, April 9, orders were received to have my command in readiness to move at daylight next morning. The 10th instant, at 6 a.m., we moved out of camp, taking the River road toward Smithfield, N. C., which place we reached on the afternoon of the 11th instant. On the morning of the 12th we again took up our lien of March for Raleigh, N. C., reaching it on the afternoon of the 13th instant. Here we remained until the morning of April 25, when we again moved on General Johnston. About this time the capitulation between Sherman and Johnston took place, so on the 28th we moved back to Raleigh again, and on the 30th of April we took up our line of March northward, reaching near Manchester, Va., May 8, 1865.

May 11 we struck camp again, marching through Manchester and Richmond, Va., reaching the vicinity of Alexandria, near Cloud's Mills, May 17, making a complete circuit around the so-called Confederacy.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOHN CRAIG,

Lieutenant-Colonel 147th Regiment Pennsylvania Vols., Commanding

Captain A. H. W. CREIGH,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
