I shall therefore remain here until I hear where you are. I have sent strong parties toward Peytonsville and the Ridge Meeting-House, also to open communication with you.

MAJOR: A sergeant of the Twelfth Missouri, taken prisoner at Campbellsville, escaped from the enemy and came into our lines with a battalion of the Eighth Michigan Cavalry this morning. He says he left Gordon's Ferry, on Duck River, at 1 and Williamsport at 2 p.m. yesterday. The One hundred and twenty-third Illinois was at those two points when he left, making no preparations to leave. Nothing new has developed itself in my front.
