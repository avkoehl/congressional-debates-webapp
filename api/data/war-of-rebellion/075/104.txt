men, estimated, and is endeavoring to cut our lines of communication. Gresham must be in the vicinity of Athens and Pulaski, and Force in Clinton or near there, though I have not heard from them in several days. I am running [pushing] through Snake Creek Gap. My advance commanded the debouch on the eastern side last night and was seven miles from Resaca. I have parked my trains near the west entrance and left two brigades to guard them. No news from Garrard.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Major-General HOOKER,

Commanding Twentieth Army Corps:

GENERAL: I am pushing on through Snake Creek Gap and will undoubtedly meet the enemy. I have left two brigades of infantry to guard my trains at the west entrance and shall move through in light fighting order. There is a road leading over the mountain from Dalton about six miles to the north of Snake Creek Gap. This road, I understood from General Kilpatrick, is controlled by your troops. If it is not guarded it leaves my trains and flank exposed.

Truly, yours,

JAS. B. McPHERSON,

Major-General, Commanding.

Major General J. B. McPHERSON,

Commanding, &amp;c., Snake Creek Gap:

GENERAL: I have heard from Corse. Garrard will surely be with you to-day. General Hooker will be ready to move to you on a signal. General Kilpatrick can operate directly on your flank till General Garrard gets up. You can send your trains up this valley to Ringgold, not exposing them at all in Chickamauga Valley. The railroad is now done to this depot. We will push the enemy at all points to-day, ready to take advantage of the effect of your movement. Open communication with General Hooker by signals.

I am, yours, &c.,
