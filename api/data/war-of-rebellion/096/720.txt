HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,February 27, 1865.

Major General G. K. WARREN:

A colored refugee, just escaped from the rebel lines, 4 p.m., reports that the enemy is moving his heavy guns from the lines in front of Petersburg toward Richmond via the Chesterfield route. Last Tuesday he saw the guns moved through the streets of Petersburg himself, and knows that advantage is taken of every dark night to get guns to the rear. They are also moving cotton and tobacco to Lynchburg. His names is John Roberts, and appears intelligent; was servant to officer in signal corps, and was afraid of being put in the rebel ranks as a soldier (though he says he knows the niggers there will not fight). A company was formed of niggers who all voted not to fight the Yankees. They were then whipped and the company disbanded. Knows nothing about the movement of troops either to or from Petersburg.

Respectfully,

H. W. RYDER,

Major and Provost-Marshal.

P. S.-I shall forward this man immediately, unless the major-general wishes to see him.

H. W. R.

[Indorsement.]

The negro has been sent to headquarters.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General of Volunteers.
HEADQUARTERS SIXTH ARMY CORPS,February 27, 1865. (Received 10.15 a.m.)

Brevet Major-General WEBB:

Nothing of importance has occurred on my lines during past twenty-four hours. Fifteen deserters came in, three bringing arms.

H. G. WRIGHT,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS SIXTH ARMY CORPS,February 27, 1865. (Received 10.35 a.m.)

General WEBB:

Deserters report that the Seventh North Carolina Regiment, about 200 strong, leaves for that State this morning, with eight days' rations, to arrest deserters. A report that one brigade from Mahone's division had gone is contradicted by deserters more lately from camp. The fire in Petersburg on evening of the 25th is said to have been the Express office.

H. G. WRIGHT,

Major-General.
