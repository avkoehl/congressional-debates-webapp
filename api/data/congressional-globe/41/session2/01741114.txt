IIAUBOR OF CHICAGO.
Mr. INGERSOLL. Before making a motion
to reconsider, I wish to call the attention of the
Chair to the fact that a bill was introduced this
morning asking an appropriation for the im-
provement of the harbor of Chicago. Accord-
ing to the Journal that bill was referred to the
Committee on Appropriations) while it should
have been referred to the Committee on Com-
merce.
The SPEAKER. That reference was made
in pursuance of a motion to that effect by the
gentleman from Illinois [Mr. Judd] who intro-
duced the bill.
Mr. JUDD. I desired to have the bill
referred to the Committee on Appropriations.
Mr. IN GERSOLL. I desire to take the
sense of the House on that question.
The SPEAKER. Does the gentleman from
New York [Mr. Churchill] yield for that pur-
pose?
Mr. CHURCHILL. I decline to yield for
that purpose.
Mr. INGERSOLL. Then I desire to have
entered on the Journal a motion to reconsider
the vote by which the House referred that bill
to the Committee on Appropriations.
The SPEAKER. That motion will be
entered on the Journal.
Mr. JUDD. I move that the motion to recon-
sider be laid on the table.
The SPEAKER. That motion is not now
in order. It can be made when the House
shall consider the motion to reconsider.
ORDER OF BUSINESS.
Mr. CHURCHILL. I now desire to call
up the contested-election case of Covode vs.
Foster.
Mr. GARFIELD, of Ohio. Has there been
any morning hour?
The SPEAKER. There has not.
Mr. GARFIELD, of Ohio. I think there
should be a morning hour.
The SPEAKER. The gentleman from New

of the contested-election case of Foster vs.

The question was upon the adoption of the

Iietolved, That Henry D. Foster is not entitled to
a seat in this House as Representative from the
twenty-first congressional district of Pennsylvania.
Retolved, That John Covode was duly elected Rep-
resentative in Congress from the twenty-first con-
gressional district of Pennsylvania at the election
held therein on the 13th day_ of October, 1868, and
that he is entitled to a seat in this House as such
Representative.
Mr. STILES. I desire to say to the gentle-
man from New York [Mr. Churchill] who
reported these resolutions that General Fos-
ter, one of the parties to this contest, is not
now present. He desires to be heard upon it;
and I therefore ask the gentleman to permit
this case to lie over until he can arrive here.
He is on his way here now, and probably has
been delayed by the storm.
Mr. CHURCHILL. I cannot yield now.
Mr. STILES. Will not the gentleman con-
sent to the case being postponed until General
Foster arrives?
Mr. CHURCHILL. I must decline.
Mr. STILES. I merely wish the House to
understand that this case is taken up in the
absence of General Foster.
Mr. CHURCHILL. I will say to the gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. Stiles] that
I have called up this case with the full under-
standing of the gentleman from Pennsylvania,
[Mr. Randall,] my colleague on the Commit-
tee of Elections, and who has charge of this
matter on behalf of the minority.
Mr. RANDALL. That leads me to say a
word.
Mr. STILES. I rise to a point of order.
The SPEAKER. The gentleman will state
his point of order.
Mr. STILES. As this is a very important
case, not only to the people of the twenty-first
district of Pennsylvania, but also to the entire
State, I ask that order be preserved during the
remarks of the gentleman from New York,
[Mr. CburchilIa]
