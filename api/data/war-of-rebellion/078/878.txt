WYTHEVILLE, September 27, 1864.

Honorable JAMES A. SEDDON:

This department is in much peril. Troops are much needed. General John S. Williams in it with 2,500 men. He is under orders to go to Georgia. If he leaves, it is equivalent to our abandonment of this department. We do not think it can be defended without him; if he stays till the crisis passes it can be defended. We earnestly urge that he be ordered to report for duty temporarily to the commanding general of this department.

LANDON C. HAYNES.
