(Received 12. 45 p. m.)

Honorable E. M. STANTON:

I have no doubt that a volunteer militia force of two or three regiments could be at once organized in Baltimore, if they could be furnished immediately with eligible arms. General Wallace promised me several days ago to communicate with you on that subject. I will go to Baltimore this afternoon and confer with him again. Please communicate to the general or myself at that city whether you can supply arms and equipments as soon as organized.

A. W. BRADFORD,

Governor.

WASHINGTON CITY, May 13, 1864-2 p. m.

Major-General WALLACE, Baltimore:

Governor Bradford says he can furnish two or three regiments of militia to take the place of other troops temporarily in Baltimore. The President desired he should do so. The Governor will be in Baltimore this afternoon to confer with you. The troops can be armed immediately with first-class Enfield muskets. They are first-class arms, and the same furnished the Western troops. They are to be received on the same terms as the Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, and Wisconsin troops.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

WASHINGTON, D. C., May 13, 1864-3. 35 p. m.

Major-General WALLACE, Baltimore:

The One hundred and forty-ninth Ohio left Camp Dennison for Baltimore on the 11th, and the One hundred and forty-fourth left Columbus for Baltimore on the 12th. Has either arrived? If so, send forward Porter's regiment with all possible dispatch.

H. W. HALLECK,
