and the threatening position of the enemy at other vital points renders it absolutely impossible to send him more men. The major-general commanding, therefore, appeals to you to assist him in the defense of the city by furnishing 50 able-bodied negroes. he feels sure that the citizens will cheerfully submit to this impressment rendered absolutely necessary. The small garrison of the fort is unable to do the work required, and we cannot afford to give up the fort which has proved of such importance in the progress of the siege of Charleston. It cannot be held unless the damage done by the fire of the enemy is constantly and promptly repaired.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
