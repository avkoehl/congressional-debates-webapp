troops. Confirmatoryof this information is the fact that there are three distinct wires hence to Alexandria, and no answer can be had from latter office. General Lee is much mortified; admits he was unprepared, having only 600 troops at Alexandria. Colonel Gregg's South Carolina regiment should have been at Manassas Junction last night, also General Bonham. Kershaw leaves to-day. General Lee says he will order another regiment to that post immediately.

L. P. WALKER:

Returns so far received show almost unamious ratification of ordinance secession. Nothing received from Northwest Virginia. Competent judges estimate majority 140,000. General Lee informs me our troops at Alexandria retired in full view of the enemy to Fairfax Station, about ten miles. Principal operator at Alexandria arrived at Manassas.
