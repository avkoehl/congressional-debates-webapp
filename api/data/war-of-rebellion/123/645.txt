Governor of Minnesota.
HEADQUARTERS FOR FORWARDING TROOPS, &amp;C.,New York, October 2, 1862.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War, Washington:

SIR: The movement of troops from this State seems quite at a standstill at the present moment. Besides the Second Metropolitan Regiment, referred to yesterday as about ready to start, there is nothing ready to move. A regiment organized in Sullivan County was to have been paid off yesterday, but a controversy sprung up between a colonel in expectancy and one who had received the appointment, producing almost a state of mutiny, and the regiment will be ordered here, doubtless, by Governor Morgan to receive their pay and then move on to Washington. A regiment is about ready to leave camp at Delhi, and a regiment from New England is expected here to-morrow en route for Washington. Some recruits have gone from here to-day.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WM. K. STRONG,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers.

WAR DEPARTMENT,

Washington City, D. C., October 3, 1862.

Adjt. General A. C. FULLER,

Springfield, Ill.:

All three-years" troops specially authorized by this Department are entitled to advance pay and bounty, unless the contrary is expressed in the order.

By order of the Secretary of War:

C. P. BUCKINGHAM,

Brigadier-General and Assistant Adjutant-General.
