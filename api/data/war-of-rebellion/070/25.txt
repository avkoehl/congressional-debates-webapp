Having thus gained the summit, I deployed two companies to the right and left of the road and began our descent southward, after driving in their skirmishers, and proceeded forward to within about 600 paces of the clearing and base of the mountain. We were here met by a fearful fire of shell and spherical case-shot from the enemy's batteries. The column was immediately halted and the troops placed under cover of woods. We were here joined by the commanding general, the Third Pennsylvania Reserves and Eleventh Virginia Regiment, who had accompanied Colonel White's command up the north slope of the mountain. Some time was occupied in reconnoiter the enemy's position and awaiting the occupied of Colonel White's command on the extreme left. At 11 a. m. the brigade was place in order of battle as follows: First, Lieutenant-Colonel Morris, with six companies of the Fifteenth Regiment Virginia Infantry on the extreme right, covering a gorge in the mountain and commanding the only approach to our right and rear; Major Wells, with four companies of the same regiment, on right of the Dublin road, in line, facing south; the Eleventh Virginia Regiment, Colonel D. Frost, commanding, on the Dublin road, facing south, with the Third and Fourth Pennsylvania Reserves on his left, directly opposite the enemy's works. About 12 m. the brigade was ordered to advance upon the enemy's works, which was done in a most satisfactory manner under the most galling artillery and musketry fire I have ever witnessed. Notwithstanding, our line moved steadily on, engaging the enemy in his works, completely routing him, capturing many prisoners, 2 pieces of artillery and a large number of small-arms, together with a considerable amount of ammunition, camp and garrison equipage, &amp;c.

For further details I would respectfully refer you to the accompanying reports of the regimental commanders, which will be found very completely and instructive.

In this engagement a number of valuable officers were killed and wounded. Among the number killed is Colonel R. H. Wollworth, of the Fourth Pennsylvania Reserves, a brave and accomplished officer, in whose death the country has sustained a serious loss. Among those seriously wounded, are Captain J. Lenhart, jr., of the Third Pennsylvania Reserves, at the time commanding the regiment, and Lieutenant J. H. McLaughlin, adjutant of the Eleventh Virginia Volunteers, acting aide-de-camp on my staff.

The annexed table* of casualties exhibits fully the number of killed, wounded, and missing, and nature of their wounds.

The brigade was again put in and ordered to pursue the retiring enemy, who was hastily retreating on the Dublin road southward. The pursuit was kept up with some skirmishing through Dublin and one mile beyond the Tennessee and Virginia Railroad, when it was ascertained that the enemy had left our front, and the brigade was ordered into camp one-half mile north of the village. A large amount of commissary, quartermaster, and ordnance stores here fell into our hands.

May 10, marched at 5 a. m., following the railroad southward about two and a half miles, when we took the road toward Pepper's Ferry, on New River, Pulaski County, leaving the railroad to our right. We proceeded in a southeasterly direction about three miles, and failing to the right through a dense woods, came upon New River
