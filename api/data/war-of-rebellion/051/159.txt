Report of Brigadier General S. A. M. Wood, C. S. Army, commanding brigade.
HEADQUARTERS WOOD'S BRIGADE,Missionary Ridge, Tenn., October 9, 1863.

SIR: The undersigned submits the following report of the part taken by his brigade in the battle of September 19 and 20, near Chickamauga River:

The brigade consisted of the Thirty-second and Forty-fifth Mississippi Regiments, commanded by Colonel M. P. Lowrey; the Thirty-third Alabama, Colonel Samuel Adams; the Forty-fifth Alabama, Colonel Breedlove, and the Sixteenth Alabama, Major McGaughy; also Major A. T. Hawkin's battalion of sharpshooters. Semple's battery is attached to this brigade, but had been, about the time we arrived in the field, directed by orders form the division chief of artillery.

At 12 o'clock on the 19th, the brigade was in line of battle on the La Fayette and Chattanooga road, near where where the left of our army was engaged with the enemy. Orders were received to march in rear of Brigadier-General Polk's brigade. After moving in a northeastwardly direction for 4 or 5 miles, we approached the field near the right of our army and formed in line of battle after crossing the West Chickamauga Creek at a ford, the men wading. This delayed batteries taking the road. The brigade was formed in line as follows:

Hawkins. Lowrey. Breedlove. McGaughy. Adams.
