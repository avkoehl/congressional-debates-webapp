HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF NORTH MISSOURI, Saint Joseph, Mo., June 15, 1864.

Major General S. R. CURTIS,Fort Leavenworth, Kans.:

GENERAL: Yours introducing Major Wright was duly presented. I am expecting other troops soon. I shall take immediate steps to remove Captain Woods with his company to Platte City, and I shall organize a home guard under the auspices of the major until I get troops. It is a difficult question to solve, but really, in my opinion, neither class of militia ought now be on duty in Northwest Missouri. Allow me to tender you my most sincere thanks for the kindly interest you manifest in behalf of my command and for the many kindnesses extended me officially and otherwise. Be assured that everything that can be done to foster and protect our loyal people will be done speedily and gladly.

I have the honor to be, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

CLINTON B. FISK,

Brigadier-General.

PAOLA, KANS., June 15, 1864.

Lieutenant G. G. BENNETT,

Olathe, Kans.:

See Colonel Keller about militia. A company should be at Shawnee, another at or near the Mission, and one at Oxford, if practicable, the object being to replace the volunteer companies. It is probable the 300 cannot be raised. Report to-morrow morning what officers of the court ar still at Olathe. Let Lieutenant Donovan and Captain Shaw remain at Olathe until further orders. Will communication about court-martial further to-morrow.
