open field. I inclose a rough sketch.* The change I made was simply to fill the two pits then unoccupied. This part of line has been called weak, but when we consider that an enemy advancing across this open field would be exposed to a fire from two directions, it seems to me to be rather the strongest part of the line. The picket-line might easily be established where the vedettes now are and vedettes still thrown out from there. This would make it a fatigue party to prepare the pits quietly. One deserter came into the lines and was sent to division headquarters. Several cases of neglect of duty were noticed, and charged will be sent in during the day.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
