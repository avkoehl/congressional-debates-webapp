NASHVILLE, TENN., December 2, 1864.

Colonel E. D. TOWNSEND,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Washington, D. C.:

I have received your dispatch of November 28.* General Burbridge is wrong in saying I had "relieved him from the command assigned by the President." He still commands the District of Kentucky, to which he was assigned according to his brevet rank. He was also authorized, under my direction, to exercise the powers of department commander. I have simply informed him that I do not direct him to exercise any such powers, because I have selected another officer to represent me in my absence. I respectfully submit, that as department commander I have clearly a right so to do. If this is not so, then Brevet Major-General Burbridge is independent of me, and I am only nominally in command of the Department of the Ohio. I shall, of course, obey the honorable Secretary's order at once, although I believe it greatly injurious to the service at this critical time.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.

Major J. A. CAMPBELL,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Army of the Ohio:

MAJOR: The display of the enemy's force on the south front is such, as reported by the signal officers, that I am extremely anxious to know whether any final determination has been reached as to my position. The brigade commanders of the Fourth Corps near me say no position has as yet been assigned them, and I fear there has been some delay in the transmittal of orders which may embarrass us if the enemy push in rapidly.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. D. COX,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
