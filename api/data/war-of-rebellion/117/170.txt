HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,July 11, 1862.

General R. E. LEE,

Commanding Army of Northern Virginia.

GENERAL: If agreeable to you I would be glad to forward by the transports which go for the wounded the baggage, &amp;c., of my wounded and unwounded officers in your hands.

I will gladly receive and forward anything intended for your officers in possession of my Government.

I have the honor to be, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEO. B. McCLELLAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,Camp near Harrison's Landing, July 11, 1862

Honorable EDWIN M. STANTON, Secretary of War.

SIR: I have the honor to forward herewith a letter* with two newspaper slips inclosed therein received to-day from General R. E. Lee, bearing date the 6th instant, and relating to two persons alleged to have been executed by authorities of the United States as enemies of the Government. I also send a copy of my reply.

The General Orders, Numbers 71, from the War Department, Adjutant-General's Office, covers every case of prisoners taken in arms against the United States and forbids their execution except by order of the President. I suggest whether this should not be extended to all prisoners charged with hostility to the Government. Crimes against individuals, as murder, rape, arson, &c., may be safely left to subordinate authorities as far as they fall under military jurisdiction and the exigencies of warfare require that they should be summarily and often capitally punished. The case is different in regard to political offenses.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEO. B. McCLELLAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,July 11, 1862.

General R. E. LEE,

Commanding Army of Northern Virginia.

GENERAL: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt to-day of your communication of the 6th instant respecting the alleged execution of Mr. William B. Mumford at New Orleans and Colonel John L. Owen in Missouri by authorities of the United States.

I have forwarded your letter and the two newspaper slips included therein to the Secretary of War. I am wholly ignorant of the cases complained of in your letter. On the receipt of the communication from the Secretary of War in response to your complaint I will at once address you on the subject. I am glad that nothing has occurred among the forces under my command which can in any point of view subject any prisoners taken from them to any retaliatory action under any circumstances.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEO. B. McCLELLAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
