SIGEL'S HEADQUARTERS, October 3, 1862-9.30 p.m.

Major-General HEINTZELMAN:

A party, under Lieutenant E. Koenig, has just returned from Stevensburg, near Culpeper. There are two regiments of cavalry, three of infantry, and one battery of the enemy at the Rappahannock Station. The rebels are at work at that bridge, which will probably be finished by to-morrow night, in order to run three locomotives and the freight cars over. There are about 2,000 wounded and sick at Culpeper, which are removed as fast as possible. But few troops at Fredericksburg; two companies of cavalry and three companies of infantry, about 300 men in all.

F. SIGEL,

Major-General.
