General S. COOPER,

Richmond:

I have been informed by Major-General Wharton that he has applied to the President for transfer to the Trans-Mississippi Department. I cordially approve the application, and if granted ask that Brigadier-General Robertson be assigned here, if General Beauregard consents.

J. E. JOHNSTON.

Governor CLARK,

Macon, Miss.:

General Forrest's scouts inform him a Yankee force of 5,000 cavalry and 4,000 infantry are at La Grange, Tenn., preparing to move on Grenada. This information is given for the benefit of your force under General Gholson.

General FORREST,

Como:

Dispatch mentioning evacuation of Corinth and movement of troops and guns down the road received. Down what road did they move? Have your ordered Thrall's battery at Columbus over to General Chalmers? If not, had you not better order it? Answer.

L. POLK,

Lieutenant-General.

MERIDIAN, January 19, 1864.

General LEE,

Jackson, Miss.:

General Forrest reports that his scouts inform him 5,000 cavalry and 4,000 infantry at La Grange preparing to move on Grenada. I suggest the expediency of your recalling General Adams and having your command in hand. Has Colonel Ross returned to his position from the swamp? If not, recall him also. I have ordered Waties' battery at Brandon to hold itself subject to your order. I will order Wilbourn's regiment to report to you.

L. POLK,

Lieutenant-General.
