GUINEY'S STATION, May 21, 1864-7.50 p.m. (Received 11 p.m.)

Since my dispatch at 5.30 p.m., cannonading has been heard on the southwest; whether from Stanard's Mill or Thornburg, it is impossible to determine. It was doubtless from Burnside's advance, but is not heavy enough to indicate any considerable engagement. It ceased about fifteen minutes ago, but as I write it opens again. It has been ascertained that Longstreet's corps moved from Spotsylvania southward at 1 o'clock last night. Hancock moved an hour and a half previously.

GUINEY'S STATION, VA., May 22, 1864-6.30 a.m. (Received 11.55 a.m.)

General Burnside, finding his crossing at Stanard's Mill opposed by a battery, made no strong effort to cross there, but in compliance with his orders, marched this way and is now near here on Warren's right, beyond the Po. After Burnside left, two brigades, or, as some prisoners say, four brigades, came off from Spotsylvania and attacked Wright, but were easily repulsed, and he is also up in safety. Warren and Wright move this morning upon Harris' Store; Burnside to Coleman's Crossing and Corrat's [Cobbett's?] Tavern to support Hancock, who is in advance of Milford. Hancock had some insignificant skirmishes yesterday. We are now in a fine, clear country, good to move and fight in.

P. S.-Hancock reports Longstreet's corps, with Hoke's, from south of Richmond, in front of him.

Warren has possession of the Telegraph road beyond Stanard's Mill. He reports that Ewell's corps, following after Longstreet, marched over that road last night. The last of the rebel train was seen at 7.30 this morning beyond Stanard's. Everything indicates that the rebel army has fallen back beyond the North Anna. General Grant estimates Lee's present force, including Hoke's re-enforcements, at 50,000 effective men. This does not include the cavalry.
