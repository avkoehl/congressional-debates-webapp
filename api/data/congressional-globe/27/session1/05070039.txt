adding the debt the Secretary proposes to create for
his sarplus and new b-mk, will swell them to
twenty-four millions higher that even that six
Bat if twenty or twenty-one millions should be
expended under any peculiar though unexplained
crcumstarces in the vear, which i? one and a haif
to two and a half tail lions more than is justified by
the experience of finy years, the  estimate is some
millions too h gh, and th're   would s'lll be no defi-
cit, becpuse ¡tie Ses r l< ry  has. included among his
expenu tures to ,edece Tieasury notes, an item of
$1,110 611, with interest, equalling about $66 000,
which notes are not due till next y ear,and so tar from
its being probaoie, as the Secretary supposes, that
they may be paid in 'or duties prcmaiure'y, and
before due, th° reverse is true, looking to the con-
dition of he money marl e ,  «o very ea?y, and the
demand foi these notes as in investment «o very
great    The] are worth  ¡ere a   quar er   to three-
fourihs per cent mote  man specie     But we have,
in his own experience, a fact that   there are not
likely to be p ll in, under such circumstances be-
cause his own monthly ¡e nrn for the first of June
exhibits bit $80,00(1 paid m if r^ar foa- million ,
whica   had   b^en   iss an?   during  the  last three
months    Tbus hi, own records prove that, m the
ratio of this amount, not two  minlred thousand
dollars of the whole would probab'y straggle into
the custom-houses and land ofnees till the   next
yeai,wh°n they b"carre due    Near a qaartei of
a million more in his aprésate, looking at the
monthly rpturn ai the beginning of this year, is out
and lost, or hoarded, or in circulation as currency,
wh>ch, with the merest he has computed on th°rn,
wid probably not cons note a charge the present
year.    Several   tirmsanl   n>i irs of the ¡ssa %
cen m the last war oí 1312, are su 1 out, „o na ,
aft°r   milang   taese deductions,   ant   admng   to
his   m an=    the   balance   in   trie   mint, which
can   be    reported    to   wnen    necesfary,   and
the    additional    sum   due    from    banks    for
¡nicest, &,c. being about   $150,000   more,  and
gentlemen will see, that in-tead ot a deficit, a very
con iderable balance would be m the Treasury
without adding near a million from duties and
lands when the Secretary has probably underes-
timated     To thnt, however, we w 11 advert more,
soon     But the Secretary would, under this econo
mical Admiputration, defeat aU  tea, and spend
twenty-six mi liens m 1841, wh n the p? t extrava-
gant   Administration   proposed   to   expeit  cniy
twenty m llions at the utmo t     The past Admini-
stration was in and out of Congress anl by candi
dates for very high offi e , assailed as. wastef il y
expending  forty ~to fifty tmh ons a year, when in
realty  it never expended, m  the usual and true
meaning ot the term, exclunnf   t u-.t-, between
tmrty two and  "nrty-h-ee  m    ons, and reduced
th-expeise   from that pmojjt as  low as twenty-
three millions    Yet tho e who belied them in this
respc-t over the wnole ccun'ry, would now, instead
of reducing th°m to the eigh een or twenty we pro-
posed, or tie th rteon they  promised, are now try-
in" to ron tnemt,p to mere than twice this last
amount b^ pushing rapt II y all expenditures and
snaking enoimous n w appropriations,   and   by
asking leave to incur a d bt- beside on their own
account and for th-ir   own schemes, exceeding
twenty-fojr mJl ors more
Indeed toe Scptorfr m Kentucky, m a memo-
rial that he pres°nted from Georgia, a few
days ago, endorse! anl aporoved us v ews,
where the ex|ei ii'urc-. he dolo-e yarly we,e
rgain exaggerated to f r y or fifty millions,
whei in truth th°y n^ver nominally reacied
even forty, nor lealb;, excluding trusts, evei reach-
ed thirty-three m Ilion?, and wief, as just observed,
tney had b come reduced in 1840 to only twenty -
three millions and m 1840, wete in ended to be
not above twenty millions
Trie Georgia memorial, become important only
by that Senator's approval of its contents, asked
to have them reduced to thirteen or fifteen mil-
No w are this report and its recommendations the
first lllasiiation of the sincerity m om opponents
as to such a reduction* Is it to be effected, as the
report recommends, by augmenting our expenses
to ten or twelve millions beyond even the fifteen
which ¡s to be the i maximum'2 Is this their mode
of fulfilling such promises, to the people* But
enough of tms at present
I pass on then, sir, to the only other and most
material deficit, se imated for the next three m mhs
by the Pres dent, at $4,845,000, and by the Se-
cretary at $5,251,388 This is toe great point
upon which the session, in a financial view, is to
be vindicated cr fail. If either of those amounts
was lwely to oe needed as early as September, in the
u«uil administration of the Treasury, m frugal
and vigilase attention to prevent such a calamity,
rather than to hasten it, then I admit mat the pub
1 c faith ought to be pro ected, and proper mea-
suies be seasonably adopted for that purpose
Bat thi  should not be allowed unnecessarily, aid
especially after Congress had just tren in session,
and provided all it deemed proper tobe expei ded,
and no new facts or disclosure , material to th.s
question, had been made since their adjournment
Much can be accomplished to prevent unnecesary
advance's ?nd premature expenditures by atten-
tion to tut  subject in the head of the Department,
whose imperious duty it is to guard well ihe public
treasure astamst being called out before needed, or
in a manner apparently inconsiderate, precipitant
and dangerous- and when he entertains doubts on
these points, to state them, if required, to prevent
waste—to have the moral courage to remonstrate
in the proper quarter.
In reaching the result that a large deficit must
happen by September, it is by this time, I think,
deemed possible, if not probable, that the Secretary
may have fat en into som! mistakes, fioin bio
wis.he, and anxiety ti find ome apology for our
early mee ng He naturally wouid f el inclined,
when aty ptausib e data exio ed, to ncrei c the
expected am rant of expense , and lesben the ex
pected amount of receipts. This we have already
seen would be characteristic.
In examining the grounds of his supposed defied
for the next three months, as bearing on tne ne
ces"ily for our early call here, and for fundirg and
making a national debt in consequence, and of a
high tariff, some of the most important measures
submitted for our action, it is proper to be accurate
as possibte The result, if showing a real deficit f
five to six millions, is the great pivot of the
present «e^-Mon If showing none, we certain-
ly ought not to have been now called ftom our
ho-nes ¿nd might usefully adjourn to-aio'ro*
Whit, then, was lwely to be the deficit when we
were ummoned, or worn we met* Many would
infer from the repo.t and the message, that it was
nea- five millions of do 1 tr= The President sajs,
"Leaving a probaüe deficit on the 1st of Septem-
ber next, of about #4,845 000 " The Secretary
says, "Leaving a deficit of $5,251,388 30 " In
this differ-"nee or di-agieementof more than four
h indrei thou and dollars it w 11 be com ttous and
liberal f> consider it between them, first, at the
Presi lent'  estimate, and _then at tae Secieta-
ry'o.
But it will be observd in toeouuet th?t this is
not the deficit wh ch has occurred, or is likely to
occur, under exis'ing appropriations   But it is one
which those office's expect to have, if you will au-
thorize further new expenditures, and also, accord-
ing to the Secretv>, insert among them, to mike a
deficit t) jrslify an extri ses ion, the expen es ex-
pected to oe incun<*d b/ ho dng *hat vety session
Let us tnen deduct, first, from tne §4,845,000, all
the new appnpna *oru not yet made, but winch lie

partment
$294 030
3i0 000
2,521 336
These make
3 165,336
And would leave           #1 679 661
If it he said that it is not cleat 'rom the messes
no-- ev?n the lucid report, that the new War De-
partment expenses are included, then I say, that
the expenses estimated for the War Department
under old appropriations alone, a-e quite this
amount too high.   They are, in the Secretary's re-
port, estimated at $4 591(098, which woulá be at
the rate of $18,364,39 i per year for that Depart-
ment alone, when they should not be over ten or
eleven millions. So the President's expenditure of
$8,100,000 for "the current service" in those three
months would be equally too high, as th,ey would
be at the rats for the current service alone, of
more than $32,000,000 for the year.
It is immaterial, th'iefore, as to the result, which
hypothesis is ths true one, under the want of cer-
tainly that exists
Deducting this amount of appropriations, not yet
made, or a man ifest over-estimate of expenditure
under the existing appropriations for the current
service, and the whole deficit on the face of the re-
port d«md es down, as before stated, to
only              ....   $1,679,664
Btu the Secretary admits that theTrea-
rury rotes tobe redeemed are not
so high as the President states them
to be by              -           -          -            93,100
Deduct that, and there is left only          $1,536,864
I shall next proceed to show, that by inadver-
tence the Secretary has himself probably computed
the old Treasury note that will be redeemed la the
next three months too high by quite a million of
dollars.
Tau^, by the monthly report published on the l«t
inst. the aggregate of Treasury notes out and
is ued under ne old acto, and not the present
one, was   ....   #3981,000
Of the->e  we have before shocn that
thcri. were issued b tween the 1st of
January ard he 4 h of March, and
of cou ^e not fa ling due m he nsxt
tbree nun h , near           -           -      1,110,000
It appears, also, frou another part of
the Secretary's repori, that of these
were   issued   between   the 4 h of
March and the 30ih, under the old
law, about        ...            413,000
We have before estimated and stated
facts in the actual returns as evi-
dence of it, that at least one-fourth
of a million of these are  old notes
lost and m circu'a'ion, which will
pro'jab y not be presented for pay-
ment ai all in 1^41    This, with-                   *
out ínteres, wout   be near             -       240,004
It funher app ars, from the monthly
statiments m U st September, Oc-
tober,   November, December, and
January,   that   in   the    last  four
mon lis   of   the   last year,  there
were  issued, whicn  will   not fall
due till after the 1st of September,
1841, Treasary note  equal to       -        670,000
Now supposmg these all to remain
out till due, as is probable, and the
whole, with those not likely to be
presented, cons nutesan aggregate of $2,433,000
Wmch  will not, on their face, be
pi^able and presented  in the  next
three months.
Dei. net tms trom all the old notes out
Ou t e  1st of June, and it  would
leave but, -           -           -           -     1548,000
and interest on the sum, about #00,000, to be
reuesm^d in the next three mon hs, instead o£
$2 850,000,  mc'udmg interest
iheeuorot tre ¡secretary has probably arisen
from supposing that most of those issued in the
Cjnespondmg month  in 1840 were still out, when
it i5 1 kely that in the pressure for money last fail
and winter, when the United States Bank was
puiauing us extraordinary course towards New
Vork, many of the Treasury notes before issued,
were paid in for duties
Aid interest on the above amount,
and a lowing beside near $200,000
for any contingencies as  to other
notes being paid in prematurely,
&c. &c and the million excess is
probable,   and if deducted   from
the residue of the deficit, leaves oí
the whole but      -           -           «      l^5!!
