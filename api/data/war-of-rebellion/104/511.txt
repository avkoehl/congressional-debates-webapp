Major F. W. EMERY,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Thirteenth Army Corps:

I have the honor to request that the entrenching tools for which requisition has been made be forwarded as soon as practicable. Lieutenant-Colonel Palfrey has laid out the fort, and such progress is being made with the work as the limited number of tools in the command will admit of. My troops have an excellent camp and their health continues good. I have reliable information that Colonel Spence's cavalry are now at the State line and have pickets and scouts between them and Citronelle.

I am, major, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. P. BENTON,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
