BALTIMORE, June 15, 1863.

R. F. WEIR,

Asst. Surg., in Charge of Hospital at Frederick, Md.:

Get away all the stores that you can. Avoid panic. What you cannot get away, prepare for destruction, and, when perfectly sure that the enemy is at hand, destroy them. We have no clear evidence yet that any of the enemy has reached Hagerstown or is moving toward Frederick. We will send assistance, if possible.

By order:

DONN PIATT,

Chief of Staff.

All is being done that is in our power to resist the invasion, but, as matters look now, all south of the Susquehanna will be swept. Orders are being sent north to run out all horses. &amp;c.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

If you could send to Harrisburg four or five organized and equipped batteries for General Couch, they would be of great service, and give much confidence to new men coming in. Please see if they cannot be spared and forwarded at once.
