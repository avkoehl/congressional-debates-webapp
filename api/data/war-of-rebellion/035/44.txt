CLARKSVILLE, February 4, 1863.

Major-General ROSECRANS:

Sent 200 cavalry down. Heard nothing as yet. Cannonading was heard until 2 o'clock last night. One gunboat was lying there yesterday. Harding was notified the day before by messenger from here that they were moving in his direction. Will advise you the moment messenger arrives.

S. D. BRUCE,

Colonel, Commanding Post.

NASHVILLE, February 4, 1863.

General ROSECRANS:

Wheeler and Forrest are defeated at Fort Donelson. They may all be taken, if General Davis can be informed at an early moment. They will return hugging the Tennessee River. I think General Mitchell leaves for Charlotte County to-night.

WM. TRUESDAIL,

Chief of Police.

MURFREESBOROUGH, February 4, 1863.

Brigadier General JEFFERSON C. DAVIS, Franklin:

Colonel Lowe telegraphs from Donelson that they have whipped the cavalry under Wheeler, Forrest, and Wharton. Forrest wounded. Rebels in full retreat. Lowe's cavalry following. He says they are out of rations and ammunition, and are retreating toward Charlotte and Shelbyville, and that a small force could capture the whole. Look out for them, and do your best to catch them.

By order of Major-General Rosecrans:

C. GODDARD,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

FIRST DIVISION, FOURTEENTH ARMY CORPS, Franklin, Tenn., February 4, 1863.

Colonel GODDARD, Assistant Adjutant-General:

Dispatch in regard to rebel attack on Donelson received. Will carry out instructions to intercept the enemy with best of my ability. The cavalry is in bad condition, but is kept well out scouting in advance. I think the enemy will, if repulsed, retreat by Centreville. Will try and keep him out of Columbia. This is the most I can do in my present condition. Infantry badly off for shoes and supplies. Will try and get them at Nashville. My cavalry force is less than 1,000 effective men. If it were strong enough, I would go with it myself to Charlotte. General Mitchell has informed me that he will co-operate with me.

JEFF. C. DAVIS,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

HEADQUARTERS UNITED STATES FORCES, Nashville, Tenn., February 4, 1863.

Brigadier General JEFFERSON C. DAVIS, Commanding Division:

GENERAL: I have the honor to inclose herewith copies of telegrams from Fort Donelson, which are self-explanatory.*
