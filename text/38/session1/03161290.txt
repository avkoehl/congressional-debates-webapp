THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
March 25,
that court, (Mr. Middleton,) I requested the.gen-
tleman from Ohio [Mr. Spalding] to go with mo
and give me an introduction to-hiru. He con-
sented, though with some reluctance, to go with
me. We were both absent in the discharge of
that duty when our names were calle'd. But we
came jr., I believe, before the doors were shut.

whether he stopped at the refreshment saloon,
called "The Hole in the Wall."
Mr. HUBBARD, of Connecticut. Not at all.
I am a stranger to that place.
Mr. GANSON. I would like to ask the gen-
tleman whether the Supreme Court is sitting to-
day?
Mr. HUBBARD, of Connecticut. It is not;

kindly agreed that the entry should be made in
the case.

time for the gentleman from Connecticut to ex-
cuse himself, he having been absent when his

not present when their names were called will be
