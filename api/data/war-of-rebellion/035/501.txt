Orders have been given to General Brannan to send Steedman's brigade forward to reconnoiter as near Tullahoma as possible. The general directs that you support his left with your two regiments and what cavalry you have at your disposal. It is believed from pretty good authority that the last of the rebels left Tullahoma last night. You will be prepared to move, should this information prove authentic.
