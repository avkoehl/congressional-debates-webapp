KANSAS CITY, July 25, 1864.

Colonel O. D. GREENE,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

I am getting pack animals and all fixed for a ten- days' scout in the brush on north side of the river. Will start over to-morrow early. They have three companies of troops at Liberty; can I use some of them if I want to! It would have been much better if General Fisk had left me Colonel Draper's command. I will do the best I can. What other troops are in that district! We should have signals or hailing signs, or we may get into trouble. All U. S. troops should carry guidons.

J. H. FORD,

Colonel, Commanding.

Colonel O. D. GREENE,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

Express just arrived from Liberty. Major Smith has returned to that place. He ran on enemy's rear guard; killed there of them. The scattered in every direction. I start in the morning with my pack- mule outfit. Hope to give you a better report hereafter.

Colonel FORD,

Kansas City:

Pack animal business approved. You can take the three companies of militia at Liberty,a s also any other companies that are not in direct communication with General Fisk. It is too late to establish any system of signals between different detachments of our forces. The only way to prevent unfortunate collisions is to make use of caution and circumspection.
