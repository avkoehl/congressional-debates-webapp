HEADQUARTERS NORTHERN DEPARTMENT, Columbus, Ohio, June 18, 1864-10. 45 a. m.

Brigadier General S. G. BURBRIDGE,Commanding, &amp;c., Lexington, Ky.:

The One hundred and sixty-eighth and One hundred and seventy-first Ohio National Guard did not enter Kentucky, en route south, but to aid in repelling Morgan. Their services are indispensable in Ohio. I am now much in want of those companies still in the vicinity of Covington. When can you relieve them? The Secretary of War wishes me to ascertain the circumstances of General Hobson's surrender; can you give me any information? All the field officers of these regiments are, I believe, with him; where is General Hobson?

(Received 21st.)

Major-General SHERMAN:

I will have the Sturgis disaster thoroughly investigated. Your order in regard to General A. J. Smith has been anticipated. With his own troops and such others as I can give him he will have a force ample to whip anything this side of Georgia.

C. C. WASHBURN,

Major-General.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI, In the Field, Big Shanty, June 18, 1864.

General WASHBURN:

Yours of 16th received. Say to General Mower that I want him advanced, and if he will whip Forrest I will pledge him my influence for a major-general, and will ask the President as a personal favor to hold a vacancy for him.

W. T. SHERMAN,Major-General, Commanding.

LOUISVILLE, KY., June 19, 1864.

Lieutenant E. B. HARLAN,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General, Munfordville, Ky.:

The rebel Jessee yesterday captured 25 convalescent under charge of Lieutenant Driskill, Forty-eighth Kentucky, at Bardstown, and paroled them. I am afraid the surrender was unnecessary. The rebels burned water station and bridge on Lebanon Branch last evening at Boston. They crossed the Nashville road two miles north of Elizabethtown last night, numbering about 300, and going on in the direction of Grayson County. Will report by mail.
