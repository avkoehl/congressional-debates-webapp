I have received information of the rebels being at Piney Point. Have ordered the Anocostia to cruise there to-night if she could be spared by the guard vessel.

WINCHESTER, VA., April 17, 1865.

Honorable E. M. STANTON:

Altough I have consulted with two of Mosby's officers here I do not intend to meet him in person at this time. General Chapman is to have an interview with him to-morrow at Millwood. I have reason to believe that Mosby may surrender his forces. His proposition was to suspend hostilities against him until he could hear from the Confederate authorities. I have declined to enter into a suspension of hostilities only until to-morrow. One of his men came in to-day. If Mosby surrenders I will endeavor to ascertain from or throuhg him something concerning the matter you especially refer to, and will probably have an interview with him. I hve now a suitable person engaged in seeking information of that kind from Mosby's men. I thank you for your caution to me against surprise.

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General.
