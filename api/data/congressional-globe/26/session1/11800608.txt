A STATEMENT showing the amount of goH arid silver, which
weni out of this country in 1321 aivl l<2¿. after the excessive
importat'onsol loreigtigoods i.i 18'7, ISIS, and It •"), and,al-
so, the anion \t that went out m lt>39 alter the excessive im-
portations ol 1833,1836, and 1S37.
These tables show that, commencing with the
exfattaonaoi the Bank in" 1817, in three jean ,
theipHad been brought into this country and con-
sotiied, gocKh from other pans of the world, above
all that was produced and sent abroad, upwards of
ftfty-seyen mill'Ons of dttl'ars—an amount wWch
had pecrued in three jears pgainst this country
equal to more th°.n three-loor h^ ot the who'e sum
spent in the last war w,tn Gr°at B'ttain. Tnis
balance asainst us had to be paid, and \on per-
ceive fromihe table, that immediately afirr, and
in the midst of ihe<l'stiess of oar people, all the gold
a"d silver which came into the country was earned
out, ar.d of vfhat was in th? oenntry befiT*, more
than nin? mi.lions, in addition, being thrre times a1!
great as aH the sp?c e heid by the Bsn'j at atiy one
time du i«2 tha' ppr.od. Precisely so it ru.s bren,
commencing «i.q th" expansion of a'l the baiiks
in 1835. In three years ihe impoits into the coun-
try exceeded ihe exports from it upwards of one
hundred aid ihiiteen millions of dollars; and as
the etpan-iin of all the kanks wss gre?ter ih^n
that of the Bank of the (Jniled States, so the excess
aaamst us in the last three years is much larger
than the excrss of the first three. Thus the coun-
try, at the commencement of 1838, had a balance
against it in amount nearly equal to the whole na
tional debt in 1816; and a* in ihe first instance, so
ia the last—the gold and Mlver began to go abroad;
and in 1839 all thai came in went oat, with an ad-
ditional sum of nearly eight millions—equal to onc-
eighth of ihe eiiimated amount of all the i-pecie in
the coantry. This drain is still going on, and must
continue through this year and perhaps neft, un-
less our exnors -hall exceed  ur imports, as was
the ca-e in 1821.
High* tariffs could not prevent this excess, i% I
have shown, but increased issues of bank pater in-
duced them; and whea the country is in debt, it
must pay. This produces disiress. The operation
to the whole coun'ry is' precisely as it would be to
an individual. Pursuing this subject still furthur,
the following ub'e shows that ihe banks have
c-i used tie r resent '"W pvices for produce, and low
wages lor labor, by calling in their loans and pa-
per.

The price of fijur is taken fiom an Opposition
paper in Cincinnati, Ohio, and the contractions, from
the monthly returns of ihe banlfi^made pursuant to
liw, The statement shows that as the banks cal'ed
in their paper, and reduced the circulation, the
price of flour, which i-i a'wajs a fa>r average of
oiher kinds ot produce, and of labcr, continued to
ral'; until, at th° erd of eleven moi.ths, ihe paper
circulation in the Mater was reduced nearly one-
ijalf, and Ihe jtíjc of flour in th? sam  proport'on,
evjn io a fraction. Fri>m this, and o her txaiiiii-a-
lions I ha*.e made, I have no dou' t, if the mquiiy
wa« car'i^d out, the same res-ul's would be
found in all the othfr Slates. This is fairly
in Seated by the last colunns ol the table,
showing the pikes of produce ia 1821 and 1840.
Under these circumstance*, it is now troyosed
by the Opposition to renew the s< stem, by creating
another bank, with larger capital than the last; to
do which it is icce^sary, and is proposed, to have
a national debt, equal in magnitu 'e lo  the pro-
posed  Bank.   This debt  is  io be rreatrd by the
"Veral Government   assuming the Sate  debts,
and becoming paymaster to Ihe British bankers,
who hold them.
Cut off the only source from which the Govera-
ji ment receives mon^y  ¡nto its Tre.vurv,  without
\' taxing the reoPle> l>y givitg nwjy the public lands,
11 and this  will necessarily require  mee money to
I    be collected from the people, either by direcunxa-
, uon'or cq"ally odious discrmiinat n; du'i"s.    The
first  open avowal of thjs  «hole écheme of the
pury oppo^in- tne Sub-Tieasuiy >n ihis Hi use, is
found   ¡n the journals of the pre.ent session,  page
i   222, January t're 18'h, 1840:
II       "Mr Gentry give notice that he shonld to-morrow, or on
jl  the earliest 0|>poriunity wlncn picoemej iiself, ask leaie to
I     oiingin a hill piovuhng for ihe.is-u.ni.non of certain debts of
'    the Siateí, and for the appiopra inn ol tht piuceeds of tie
public lands lor tile pay neut thereof "
II       Tnis proposition comes from a gentleman of
¡1 acknowledge ab.liiy, from ihi State of Tennessee,
j! and one who deservedly stands hiah with his party.
'I      Asain, on the journals, pages 541 and 542, the
fol'owing motion will be found, v-hich   was made
I    by a member who has been s ane years in Con 
jl gress, and may be .considered a kaHer ci the Oppo-
i! siiiun ia this House:
ii     '-The States were now called fjr resolutions, commencing
with Ken'ucky.
i'      ' Mr. Pope moved the lollswieg:
"Resolinl. That it is neces a.y and proper to cstahUsh a

gorate all branches of business and industry, give employment
to the Idb'inng cln<?si s at fair wages in good money, lelieve the
people fiom the heavy burden of taxes now imposed on them
by the present deranged condition of the exchanges and bank
paper, íeform the ex s'ing disoiders in the currency, and se-
cure to the na'ion a stable and uniform standard of value by
excluding a spurious and ruinous paper currency from circu-
lation, and to prepare in part Ihe pecuniary means of war; ten

■ I The whole system is here developed; and the ob-
jee's which are to be effected by it, are those which
I have shown neither tariff cor bank has ever jet
been able to do. It acunes lo rd.ere the people
from pmbarrassm°nt and taxatim; but instead of
he-e, will mereate both. A lew brief reflt-ctions
will prove this.
