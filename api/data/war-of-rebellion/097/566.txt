BROADWAY LANDING, VA., April 4, 1865-12 p.m.

Lieutenant W. R. KING,

Acting Chief Engineer, Richmond:

I am using all my means of transportation in removing the captured ordnance at Petersburg and on Bermuda lines. Hope to be able to begin on those of Richmond day after to-morrow. Can you give me a list of most important localities? The water batteries are so very heavy that they had better remain until last. If possible a small guard should be placed over the best guns. I shall try to load the water batteries on a flat boat if the quartermaster can supply one.

Colonel CHARLES G. LORING

Assistant Inspector-General, Ninth Army Corps:

COLONEL: I have just seen for the first time your note to General H. W. Benham relieving the troops of his command from duty with the Ninth Corps, and am very grateful to Major-General Parke for the complimentary language he uses in speaking of my troops. Immediately upon leaving the Defenses of City Point my brigade became a separate and distinct command, not in any way subject to the orders of General Benham, and what was done by me was under the immediate direction of Brigadier-General Griffin, to whom I was ordered to report. I mention this in justice both to my command General Griffin, and myself.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

CHARLES H. T. COLLIS,

Brevet Brigadier-General, Commanding.
