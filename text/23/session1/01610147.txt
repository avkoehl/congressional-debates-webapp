ported to market, and having also extensive quar-
ries of limestone and marble, which are worked,
and the lime and marble slupoed to a market, she
is deeply interested in trade, commerce, exchange,
and a sound currency So gieat aie the quanti-
ties of these materials and of domestic manufac-
tures, and so extensive her intercouise witn the
British provinces and with the other S ates, that
her coasting trade is very -valuable Her tonnage
employed in that trade, and other commerce, is to
such an amount that there are now, it is believed,
but two States whose tonnage is greater Much
of the success of her industrious and very enter-
prising people dependo upon the successful prose-
cution of this trade and commerce, and her people
must therefore be supposed to understand their
own interests
Little more than five years ago, and but one out
of nine of hei electoral votes was given to the
piesent Chief Magistrate At the last election the
whole vote of the State was given to him
Ihe resolutions now offered were passed in her
House of Representatives by a vote of 119 to 53,
and in her Senate by a vote of 22 to 2 The elec-
tion of these membeis, it is true, took place before
the removal of the deposites, but the persons
elected remained among the people electing them
until after tne discussion of the question com-
menced here, and they carried with them the
opinions of the people whom they represented,
and those opinions are embodied in their resolu-
tions. These facts show that a large majority of
the people of Maine do not regard the conduct of
the President in the manner that my colleague
does
What he understands to be an accumulation of
power in the Executive by the exercise of the veto
power, as it is called, they understand to be a pros-
tiation of power attempted to be accumulated
They have seen the President exeicise a power
guen to him by the Constitution, to break down
tha* assumption of power which would control
a id manage the internal improvements of the
S ate* They have se°n him exercise the same
power to prostrate a bank charter calculated to
contiol their own moneyed concerns,and to bring
them and all their great and growing interests
within its influence, and to enable it to brighten or
blacken then piospects at its will They desire to
be delievered from suJi a power, and hence the
vote on these resolutions The other topics alluded
to by my colleague have all been discussed, and
an opinion formed upon them in Maine, and that
opinion is so distinctly made known in tnese reso-
lutions, that it is not necessary that I should say
anything respecting them I concur in all the
opinions expressed in these resolutions
Mr SPRAGCJE said he was always disposed
to be governed by the voice of the people when
expressed That while the resolutions of the
Legislature of Mame emanated fiom that body in
.1 paity character almost exc'usively, the resolu
tions from the city of Portland spoke the vo ce of
the people of that city, that they were suffering
serious distress and embarrassment While he
differed in opinion from the Legislature of Maine,
a body for which he entertained great respect, and
a'so from his honorable colleague, yet he was
always ready and willing to renaer an account to
the people for his public acts
Mr SHEPLEY, in reply, said he would only
siite a fact or two All the representatives of the
city of Portland were among the 119 voting foi the
l evolutions, that all the Senators from the county
of Cumberland, in whieh that city is si'uated,
were also among the number of Senatois who
voted for them, that one of the Sena'ors from Ken-
nebec county, and an opponent to the Administra-
tion, asked to be excused from vo'mg, on the
ground that he was of opinion that the President
had assumed a power that did not belong to him,
and yet he cou! 1 not vote to restore the deposites,
thinking it would be inexpedient
The resolutions were then read and referred to
the Committee on Finance, and ordered to be
tnnted
Mr McKEAN presented the petition of sundry
citizens of Pittsbuig, disapproving of the course
of the Secretary of the Treasuiy m removing the
deposites, which was referred to the Committee
on Finance
Mr. McK observed that this memorial had been
committed to his care for presentation by the Rep-
resentative in the House of Representatives from
Pittsburg, Pennsylvania, [Mr Denny,] who de-
sired him to say that the memorial was numerous-
ly and respectably signed by citizens of that place,
without distinction of party He had also in his
possess on a letter, left with him by Mr Denny,
which any gentleman might see wno desired it
Mr WILKINS presented two or three memo-
rials from Pittsburg, sustaining the Secretary of
the Treasury upon the removal of the deposites,
which were refei red to the Committee on Finance,
and ordered to be printed
Mr WEBSTER suggested the propriety of
having the names of the memorialists to all the
petitions on this subject printed
Mr WILKINS piesented the petition of the
heirs of Andrew Gardner, which was refeired to
the Commi'tee on Revolutionary Claims
Mr TYLER presented two petitions of a private
nature
Mr TIPTON communicated the memorial of
the Legislative Council of Michigan relative to the
improvement of certain rivers in that Territory,
which was referred to the Committee on Com-
merce.
Mr POINDEXTER, from the Committee on
Public Lands, reported a bill for the removal of
the office of the surveyor general from Ohio to
Indiana
Which was read twice and committed.
Mr. POINDEXTER, fiom the same commit-
tee, reported a bill from the House of Representa-
tives for the relief of George K Jackson, and gave
notice that he was instructed by the committee
that, when the bill was called up, he should move
its indefinite postponement
Mr KING, of Alabama, gave notice that he
should to moriow ask leave to introduce a bill for
the relief of John Donelson and Stephen Heard
The following resolution was submitted by Mr
POINDEXTER
Resolved, That the President be requested to
cause to be laid before the Senate a copy of any
correspondence, if any shall have taken place, be-
tween the War Department or any office attached
to it, and the Bank of the Unued States, in respect
to the agency of the said bank, under the act of 7th
June, 1832, or any other act of Congress, in the
payment of pensionéis
The resolutions of Mr POINDEXTER sub-
mitted on Friday, were then taken up
Mr WEBS1ER suggested to the gentleman
from Mississippi, and the gentleman from Ken- i
tucky, the propriety of referring these resolutions,
and the letter o^tne Secretary of the Tieasury on
the removal of the deposites, to the Committee on
Finance, and allow the resolutions thereon to re-
main before the Senate, so that the debate might
proceed without inteiruption
Mr POINDEXTER suggested a question of
order, whether that could be done without tak ng
the whole subject from the possession of the Sen-
ate
Mr CLAY said he had no objection to the prop
osition, if it was understood that the debate ontre
resolutions could go on Helioped noth.ng would
be allowed to interiupt that
Mr WRIGHT said it seemed to him, as the
second reso'ution related exclusively to the reasons
of the Secretary, that if i| were referred to the
committee, the debate upon it could not proceed
He objected to withdiawmg it from the Senate, as
he desired, when a convenient opportunity pre
ser'ed, to give his views to the Senate upon it
The VICE PRESIDENT was unde-stood to
say, that the reference to the committee wou'd
withdraw the subject from tne Senate
Mr CLAY observed that the President's mes-
sage was before the committee, and there was
nothing to prevent them from proceeding upon
it
Mr WEBSTER said the message was not the
Secretary's reasons The message was before the
committee, and they were not to be supposed to
be inattentive to it, or the memorials on the sub-
ject of thedeposites, and if the Secretary's reasons
wei e before the conmi'tee, they would not require
to have possession of them more than a day He
thought if the paper was to go to the committee it
was time it was there.
Mr POINDEXTER asked that Mr Clay's
second resolution might then be read, which was
done
Mr POINDEXTER said it did not follow that
the reference of the report carried the resolution
with it Every Senator had the original report
printed and on his file The reasons of the Sec-
retary were in possession of every Senator It
was competent for the Senate to go on with the
discussion, and put the committee in possession of
the paper at the same time If fee was right, he
preferred that the report should go to the commit-
tee now, no inconvenience would result from it,
and the report would be had in a day or two.
Mr. WEBSTER would relieve the apprehen-
sion of gentlemen by saying, that at the close of
the debate to-day, he would move to refer the Sec-
retary's letter to the Committee on Finance, and
the íeport should be made to-morrow at the meet-
ing of the Senate
Mr KING, of Alabama, said that this difficulty,
which was apparent, arose from the eagerness
with which these various resolutions had been
pressed upon the Senate If the resolutions were
separated from the subject on which they weie
founded, the whole matter would betaken out of
the possession of the Senate, and would go to the
Committee on Finance, where it ought to have
gone in the firbt instance Now, he asked the
gentleman from Mississippi what object he had in
his resolutions' Did they vary the powers of the
committee upon the memorials, or was it necessary
to coerce the committee upon the subject' Wag
it necessary to instruct the committee upon the
condition of the currency* That was a part of their
duty They had it before them in the message
and the various memorials which had been referíed
to them All the gentleman's resolutions were to
the same point, except the one relating to the dis-
tress existing in the community He was opposed
to the adoption of the resolutions, because it was
not customary to authorize the committee to send
for persons and papers withoutan intimation from
the committee that they wished it It was usual
to ask for the power, and when it was necessary
we gave it to them
Mr POINDEXTER remarked, the gentleman
[Mr King] had opened the discussion, which fiom
the first he wished to avoid. He would not follow
his example
Mr WILKINS said there was something to
him quite objectionable m the mode suggested. He
thougnt the proposition,as he understood the gen-
tleman from Massachusetts, would carry tlie whole
.subject from the Senate, and he understood that
the Chair had so intimated He had no objection
to the íeference to the Committee on Finance, but
he hoped an arrangement could be made, that the
debate might continue That was all he asked,
lie had yielded the floor to the gentleman from
New Jeisey [Mr Frelinghdtsen] with that ex-
pectafon If it was the subject of any arrange-
ment, he hoped his claim to the floor in the line of
succession justified him in expressing the hope
that it would be made
Mr WEBSTER remarked, that he was sur-
prised he had been misunderstood He said he
would propose at the conclusion of the discussion
to day, to refer the subject to the Committee on
Finance, and that thf report of the committee
«mould be made to morrow He did not recognize
any line of succession in the debase, but if the gen-
tleman objected to that course, or thought he would
be affected by it, he would postpone his motion
until the gentleman had spoken
Mr WILKINS replied, that if the report of the
committee could be made to morrow, he would not
interrupt the debate Heheartily concurred in ihe
proposition
Mr  FORSYTH thought the Senate were likely
to be greatly embarrassed by these resolutions    If
1 e was not m staken, they would entirely stop the
discussion     Tne resolutions instructed the com-
mittee to inquire into the whole subject embraced
by theresolutionsofthe gentleman from Kentucky.
They swept away the whole of the Secretary's rea-
1 sons     It was impossible, without the Secretary's
I reasons, for the committee to enter into it    He
1 thought it better to let the subject he on the table
I for the present, and not to press it till the report of
I the Secretary was disposed of.
