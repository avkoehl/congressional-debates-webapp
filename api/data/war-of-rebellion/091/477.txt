(Received 7 p. m.)

ASSISTANT ADJUTANT-GENERAL,

Headquarters:

SIR: Nothing to report this evening, except Major-General augur telegraphs me from Rectortown that the Second District of Columbia Volunteers will be returned here between this and Saturday, to relieve the Forty-second Massachusetts Volunteers.

Respectfully,

JNO. P. SLOUGH,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIRST INFANTRY DIVISION, DEPARTMENT OF WEST VIRGINIA, Cedar Creek, Va., October 27, 1864.

Captain WILLIAM McKINLEY, JR.,Acting Assistant Adjutant-General:

CAPTAIN: I would respectfully request, if practicable, that the Second Brigade of my division, now on duty at Newtown, be ordered to join the command at this point. I make this request on account of the extremely heavy detail to which my command is subject at present. Between 350 and 400 men are required for picket duty besides the details for forage, train guard, &amp;c. My first Brigade is very small, the Fifth Heavy Artillery having gone to Harper's Ferry, and the Thirty-fourth Massachusetts being on duty at Newtown. As the Second Brigade would augment my force to such an extent as to materially lighten the duty, I make this request.

I am, captain, yours, faithfully,

T. M. HARRIS,

Colonel, Commanding.
