General S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General:

Enemy's ordinary fleet reported to have left Hilton Head, probably for an expedition on coast or for the north; if the latter, it indicates Burnside's operations. Will telegraph further when more is known here.

CHARLESTON, S. C., November 29, 1862-8.15 a. m.

Brigadier General R. S. RIPLEY,

Commanding 1st Mil. Dist., Dept. of S. C. and Ga., Charleston, S. C.:

GENERAL: I am informed the enemy's fleet has left Hilton Head. We must be prepared to meet him at all points. You will issue three days' provisions to movable troops and sufficient ammunition. See that all troops are provided with haversacks. Collect cars enough to transport two regiments at a time on the Charleston and Savannah Railroad and the Northeastern Railroad. No train should be overloaded.

My impression is that the enemy's demonstration is intended against Georgetown; if so, we may have to march also some troops from here; make all the necessary preparations. You will be put in command of all troops moving in that direction. You will please forward by express the inclosed note to General Trapier.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. T. BEAUREGARD,

General, Commanding.

[Inclosure.]

CHARLESTON, November 29, 1862.

Brigadier General J. H. TRAPIER:

Be on lookout; enemy's fleet has left Hilton Head; issue three days' provisions to movable troops; look to ammunition and haversacks.

G. T. BEAUREGARD.

CHARLESTON, November 29, 1862.

Brigadier General W. H. C. WHITING, Wilmington, N. C.:

Enemy's fleet reported to have left Hilton Head; look out for them.
