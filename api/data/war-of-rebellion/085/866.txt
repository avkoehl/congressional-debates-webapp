Assistant Adjutant-General, Saint Louis:

Shelby is not in Northern Missouri. Anderson has 400 men. Colonel

Clark, with a regiment and some artillery, moving up the river toward Glasgow. Tell General Douglass.

JOHN V. DU BOIS,

Colonel and Chief of Staff.

HERMAN, MO., October 14, 1864-1 a. m.

Brigadier-General DOUGLASS,

Mexico, Mo.:

Price has left Boonville for the west. Hardly think Shelby will stay north of the river. Can't Forbes defend Macon and the rolling-stock there? If Shelby threatens you concentrate Forbes and all the militia on the Hannibal and Saint Joseph Railroad at Macon and fortify. If you can't defend Mexico, retire to the Perruque bridge. General Ewing will send re-enforcements to Saint Charles, where he can re-enforce you. Why have you not fortified Mexico? Are there not block-houses at the ridges? If so, leave Mexico and defend the bridges by riflepits and the block-houses. Telegraph General Ewing.

JOHN V. DU BOIS,

Colonel and Chief of Staff.

Several small bands prowling round in squads of sixty to eighty. I have no cavalry to follow them. Could do so with 500. I have my stockade nearly completed here. All safe. No other news.

HERMANN, October 14, 1864.

Captain FRANK ENO,
