Colonel BLAIR, Fort Scott:

Is all of the Third Wisconsin Cavalry mounted? If not, how many horses will it take to mount it? What condition is Fifteenth Kansas Cavalry in? How many mounted? How many need horses?

G. M. DODGE,

Major-General.

FORT SCOTT, KANS., May 18, 1865.

Major-General DODGE, Saint Louis, Mo.:

All of the Third Wisconsin Cavalry that are in my command are mounted. Eighty-five men belonging to my companies are at Lexington, Mo., and sixty in the District of the Upper Arkansas. I don't know how they are off for horses. I have saved as many horses as I think will mount them if I get them back. The Fifteenth Kansas Cavalry is absolutely dismounted. It will take at least 600 horses to put them in good shape. I have forwarded requisitions to Brigadier-General Mitchell for that number for the regiment. About eighty men mounted in the regiment. These two detachments taken from my four companies of Wisconsin troops impair their efficiency very much. I would like to get them back, and if necessary send to Lexington a company with its officers, rolls, records, &amp;c., so they might be properly managed and could get their pay.

CHAS. W. BLAIR,

Colonel.
