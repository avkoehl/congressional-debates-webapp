HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS, July 30, 1864.

Major-General WARREN:

General Burnside is directed if his mine has failed to open all his batteries and assault. Upon hearing his batteries open you will open all in your front.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,Major-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS, July 30, 1864-5.30 a. m.

Major-General WARREN:

GENERAL: General Crawford reports things in his front about as usual; but very little firing and not much show of men.

FRED. T. LOCKE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, July 30, 1864-5.50 a. m.

Major-General WARREN:

General Burnside is occupying the crater with some of his troops. He reports no enemy is seen in that line. How is it in your front? Are the enemy in force there or weak? If there is apparently an opportunity to carry their works take advantage of it and push forward your troops.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,Major-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS, July 30, 1864-6 a. m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

Your dispatch just received. It is difficult to say how strong the enemy may be in my front. His batteries extend along the whole of it. I will watch for the first opportunity. I can see the whole line well where I am. The enemy has been running from the first line in front of General Burnside's right for some minutes; but there seems to be a very heavy line of troops just behind it in very high breast-works. There is a battery in front of General Burnside's left, which fires toward the river the same as it did on the 18th of June, and which our artillery fire has but very little effect on.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,* July 30, 1864-6.15 a. m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

I have just received a report from my line on the center and left. The enemy opened with musketry when our firing began, but our own fire kept it down; also that of all their artillery, except in the second line on the main ridge, from which they fire a little. Major Fitzhugh, of the artillery, is badly wounded by a musket-ball in the thigh. None of the enemy have left my front that I can see.

G. K. WARREN,Major-General.
