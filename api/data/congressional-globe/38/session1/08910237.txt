ticular case, for the due protection of the interests
of the captors and of the Navy pension fund; and
under the direction of the Secretary of the Navy
such counsel may institute and prosecute such
proceedings in the case as may be necessary and
proper for the protection of such interests. The
court may allow such compensation as it shall
deem just under the circumstances of each case

trict attorney or any of his assistants, whether
appointed by a Department of the Government or
by the captors, for services actually rendered in
the cause, to be paid as costs, in whole or in part
either from the entire fund or from the portion
awarded to the captors; but no such allowance
shall be made except for services rendered on
matters as to which the party the counsel repre-
sents has an adverse interest to the United Slates,

' for services rendered in a contestation between
parties claiming to participate in the distribution

priated for defray ing the expenses of suits in which
the United States is a party or interested.
Sec. 25. And be it further enacted, That when-
ever the court shall allow fees to any witness in a
prize cause, or fees for taking evidence out of the
district in which the court sits, and there is no
money subject to its order in the cause, the same
shall bo paid by the marshal, and shall be repaid
to him from any money deposited to the order of
the eourt in said cause; and any amount not so
repaid the marshal shall be allowed as witness fees
paid by him in cases in which the United States

Sec. 26. Andbeitfurtherenaeted, Thatnopvize

stipulation, deposit, or other security, except
where there has been a decree of restitution and
the captors have appealed therefrom, or where
the court, after a full hearing on the preparatory
proofs, has refused to condemn the property on
those proofs, and has given the captors leave to
take further proofs, or where the claimant of any
property shall satisfy the court that the same has
a peculiar and intrinsic value to him, independent
of its market value. In any of these cases, the
court may deliver the property on stipulation or
deposit of its value, if it shall be satisfied that the
rights and interests of the United States and cap-
tors, or of other claimants, will not be prejudiced
thereby, a satisfactory appraisement being first
made, with an opportunity given to the district
attorney and naval prize commissioner to be
heard as to the appointment of appraisers. And

money collected on a stipulation, not being costs,
shall be deposited with the assistant treasurer in
the same manner as proceeds of a sale.

inventoried by persons as competent and impar-
tial as can be obtained,and the survey,appraise-
ment, and inventory shall be sent to the court in
which proceedings are to be had; and if taken
afterwards, sufficient notice shall first be given to
enable the court to have the property appraised
for the protection of the rights of the claimants
and captors. In all cases of prize property here-
tofore taken for, or appropriated, to the use of
the Government, or that shall hereafter be so
taken or appropriated, the Department for whose
use it was or shall be taken of appropriated, shall
deposit the value thereof with the assistant treas-
urer of the United States nearest to the place of
the session of the court, subject to the order of
the court in the cause.
Sec. 28. And be it further enacted, That in case
of any capture heretofore made, or that shall here-
after be made, if, by reason of its condition, or
because the whole has been appropriated to the
use of the United States, no part of the captured
property has been or can be sent in for adjudica-
tion, or if the captured property be entirely lost
or destroyed, proceedings for adjudication may
be commenced in any district the Secretary of the
Navy may designate. And in any such case the
proceeds of anything sold, or the value of any-
thing taken or appropriated for the use of the
Government, shall be deposited with the assist-
ant treasurer in or nearest to that district, sub-
ject to the order of the couit in the cause. If,
when no property can be sent in for adjudication,
the Secretary of the Navy shall not, within three
months after any capture, designate a district for
the institution of proceedings, the captors may
institute proceedings for adjudication in any dis-
trict. And if, in any case of capture, no proceed-
ings for adjudication shall be commenced within
a reasonable time, any parties claiming the cap-
tured property may, m any district court as a
court of prize, move for a monition to show cau^ft
why such proceedings shall not be commenced,
or institute an original suit in such court for res-
titution, and the monition issued in either case
shall be served on the attorney of the United
States for the district, and on the Secretary of the
Navy, as well as on such other persons as the
court shall order to be notified.
Sec. 29. And be it further enacted, That when
any vessel or other property shall have been cap-
tured by any force hostile to the United States,
and shall be recaptured.and it shall appear to the
court that the same had not been condemned as
prize before its recapture, by any competent au-
thority, the cor.it shall award a meet and compe-
tent sain as salvage, accoidiug to the circum-
stances ofeach case; and if the captured property
belonged to the United States, it shall be restored
to the United States, and there shall be paid from
the Treasury of the United States the salvager
costs, and expenses ordered by the court; and if
the recaptured property belonged to persons re-
siding within or under the protection of the United
States,the court shall ad judge the property to be
restored to its owners upon their claim, on the
payment of such sum as the eourt may award-as
salvage, co%ts, and expenses; and if the recap-
tared property belonged to atly person pei-sp&-
nently resident within the territory and under
the protection of any foreign prance, Go-vernmertt,.

law or usage of such prince, Government, or State,
the property ofacitizen of the United States would
be restored under like circumstances of recap-
ture, it sljall be adjudged to be restored to such
owner upon his claim, upon such terms as by
the law or usage of such prince, Government, or
State would be required of a citizen of the United
States under like circumstanccs of recapture; and.
when no such law or usage shall be known, it
shall be adjudged to be restored upon the pay-
ment of such salvage, costs, and expenses as the â¢
court shall order: Providtd, That nothing in this
act shall be construed to contravene any treaty
of the United States.- And the whole amount
awarded as salvage shall be decreed to the captors,
and no part to the United States, and shall be
distributed as in the case of proceeds of property
condemned a^ prize.
Sec. 30. And fee itfurthcrcnactcd, Thatifitshafi
appear to the court, in the case of any prize prop-
erty ordered to be sold, that it will be for the in-
terest of all parties to have it sold in another dis-
trict, the court may direct the marshal to transfer
the same to the district selected by the court for
the sale, and to insure the same with proper
orders as to the time and manner of selling the
same. And it shall be theduty of the marshal so
to transfer the property, and keep and sell the
same in like manner as if the property were in
his own district; and he shall deposit the gross
proceeds of the sale with the assistant treasurer
nearest to the place of sale, subject to the order
of the court in which the adjudication thereon
is pending; and the necessary expense attending
the insuring, transferring, receiving, keeping, and
selling the said property shall be a charge there-
upon and upon the proceeds thereof; and when-
ever any such expense is paid in advance by the
marshal, and he shall not be repaid from the pro-
ceeds, any amount not so repaid he shall be al-
lowed as in case of expenses incurred in suits in
which the United States is a party. The Secre-
tary of the Navy may, in like manner, either by
a general regulation or special direction in any
cause, require a marshal to transfer any prize
property from the district in which the judicial
proceedings are pending to any other district for
sale, and the same proceedings shall be had as if
such transfer had been made by order of the court,

with the property, or to any deposition or other
document or paper connected with the proceed-
ings, with intent to defraud, delay, or injure the

impiisonment not exceeding five years, or both,
at the discretion of the court.
