[Indorsement.]
HEADQUARTERS EIGHTEENTH ARMY CORPS, New Berne, N. C., April 19, 1863.

Respectfully returned to Colonel Pickett. The signature attacked is evidently not his own. This same communication will be properly signed and returned to office.

By order of Brigadier-General Palmer commanding:

J. A. JUDSON,Captain and Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS FOURTH CORPS, Yorktown, April 20, 1863.

Major-General DIX,

Commanding Department of Virginia, Fort Monroe:

It is reported at Williamsburg that General Wise has been retired, and that General Hood replaces him on this Peninsula with an additional regiment of cavalry. If so, I need two more regiments of infantry without delay and the replacement of the artillery sent from here to Norfolk two night ago. My men are overworked now.

The rebels are anxious about their Merrimac Numbers 2; something seems to have gone wrong with them in that matter. If anything could add to the importance of holding the line of Fort Magruder it would be the appearance of the Merrimac.

E. D. KEYES,

Major-General.

SUFFOLK, April 21, 1863.

Major-General DIX:

It gives pleasure to say that General Getty is safe on this side with all the material of war and without loss. The prisoners were sent last night, and attempted to escape by uncoupling the cars, but did not succeed. I shall send out at once on the Swamp or E. road and assail Longstreet's right flank cautiously.

PECK,

Major-General.

SUFFOLK, VA., April 21, 1863.

Major-General DIX:

General Halleck seemed well pleased with affairs here, and I am very glad he made a visit. I hope you arrived all safe.

JOHN J. PECK,

Major-General.

SUFFOLK, VA,. April 21, 1863.

Major-General DIX:

General Getty thinks the enemy has not fallen back. He thought so at one time yesterday. All over safe. Fires at night have not diminished.

JOHN J. PECK,

Major-General.
