v hich is to be in yv riting, the statute stops The
States are to pa) back, not m sums of §10,000, or
$20,000, nor at any particular times, but m any
sums, at any times, whenever the Secretary of the
Treasury shall require it To be sure, m a pro-
viso to the law, the Secietary of the Treasury is
prohibited fiom calling back the deposite except
upon notice of thirty days, and then only in limited
amounts, But w ith this the Stales hav e nothing to
do, any farther than they are mdnectly benefited
by the regulations imposed bj the Government for
its ow n purposes This proviso does not consti-
tute a part of the sontract, but was a restriction im-
posed by Congress upon the Secretary, who, they
had reason to believe, w as hostile to the law, and,
they perhaps feared, "would call back the deposite
more rapidly than they might deem necessaiy
But I do not take this giound, sir, because I am
in favor oí calling this money back fiom the States,
so far as the deposite has been made And here I
differ with the gentleman from Georgia (Mr Hol-
sey) who has just taken his seat I do not believe
a vote can ever be obtained for calling it back, and,
with my present views, I should not be willing to
be instrumental in effecting that object The mis-
chief has been done, and it cannot be remedied bj
insisting upon a repayment of the monej
If my views of the legal rights of the parties to
this eoniract be coriect, then the only question is,
/ whether it is expedient to vvithho'd the payment of
' the fouith instalment And, in regaid to this
question, I cannot conceive how there can be two
opinions, except as between those who hold that a
national debt is a national blessmg, and thost who
hold otherwise For we are shown,most cleaily, in
the repoit of the Secretary, that there will be a
deficit in the Treasur) if this instalment be paid
to the States I know that gentlemen talk about
this report being a Cretan laby rmth that they can
not understand how theie is to be anv deficit,
that thev are in a mist and cannot s e oleaily
Sir, is the Scietarvto Wane foi this"! If gentle-
men are groping their way in the mists of error,
let them make haste to reach those elevated
grounds, wheie the clear sunlight of truth will
chase away all mists, and enable them to see
clearly The tepoit of the Secretary appears
to me to state the facts m a manner peifeefly
clear and intelligible, so that he who runs may
read These facts have also been p!aced before
us m different modes by the gentleman from Vir-
ginia, (Mr Jones,) and by the gentleman from
Georgia, (Mr Holsey,) all arriving at the same
lesult, and showing, most conclusively, that if this
instalment be paid ovei, there will necessanlv be
a deficit in the Treasurj The only question then
is, whether we shall resort to a loan to raise money
for the purpose of depositing it with the States.
Sir, what would be thougnt of the man who
should hire money from one ban1? for the put pose
of depositing it m another nithovt iüíe>esl't Would
he not be legarded as a fit SLOje t foi an insane
hospital'2 And why should we not be exhibiting a
similar spectacle, by lefusmg to pass thi-. bill, and
j resoitmg to a loan to raise money for deposite
with the States'2
In every view which I can take of this case, it
seems to roe that a postponement of the payment of
this instalment is called foi by every consideration
of common sense, pru lenoe, and patriotism But
shall the postponement be indefinite, as by the bill,
or to January, 1839, as propo ed bv the amend-
ment* Sir, I prefer the bill without the amend-
ment We are told heie of the disappoint-
ments to which the States will be subjected bv
withholding this money, how it w ill thw art then
plans and multiply the troubles which are al-
ready sufficiently abundant I ask, then, if we
should not by adapting the amendment be
probably subjecting the States to the same dis-
appointments and troubles over again If we fix
a defim'e time w hen the instalment is to he paid,
will not States go on as heretofore, lay±ng their
plans, and arranging their affairs m coirespon-
dence with such holding out on our pait? And if
so, will they not be destined to disappointment1
For one, sir, I trust that such a policy is to be pur-
sued that we are to have no more laige surpluses,
that the people are no longer to be taxed that Go-

vernment may be enabled to return to them again
the amount thus lev i^d, deducting a large propor-
tion of it for expenses, losses, etc The gertleman
from Noith Carolina, (Mr rihepard,) legiets the
disagreeable sci ambles that have been witnessed
for appropi ntions for internal improvements m
the States, and j et is in fav or, as it seems to me
of a policy uho"e n cessary tendency is to renew
those scrambles Go on with y our system of divi-
sion, and you directly and powerfully strengthen
the motives to cieate a surplus, and whenevei
there is a surplus, there will be wltnessed a disa-
greeable sci ambling for its possession Sir, I
dread a suiplus nearly as much as I do a na
tional debt Neithei of them are compatible with
the interests of our people The one imposes
taxes, and ofien very unequally, to pay interest
and the salaries of a hoide of petty officeis, while
the tendency of the other is to coirupt all the
stieams of legislat on, and to generate a low and
mercenaty spirit among the people I would then
avoid them both Let the Government be adminis-
tered in plain republican smiohcity and economy
Let no moie money be abstracted fi om the pockets
of the people, either dnectly or indirectly, than is
w anted for this puipose, and let the States pie-
¡' serve their dignity and independence, bv relying
': upon their own resouices for internal lmprove-
j merits oi other objects, instead of being humble
suppliants foi the bounty of the General Govern-
ment But, sn, I have detained the committee
much longer than I had intended, and w ill now
close, thanking them fur the attention which they
have given me
Mr PARKER said it had not been his intention
to take any part in the discuss on of this bill, and
he should not now do so, if he had not learned
from the r iraiks of his colleague, (Mr Sibley,)
that some of th delegation from the State of New
York entertained on this subject sentiments \ery
diffei?nt from h s o in lit there'bre considered
it a duty he i ued to his constitucn s, as we 1 as his
colleagues, to state bneflv to the committee the rea-
sons that would induce him to vote m favoi of the
bill
It has been said, Mr Chairman, by the honora-
ble gentleman fiom Tennessee, (Mr Bell,) that
this measure has originated in a settled hostility
to the deposite act of 1836 I do not know, sir,
what facts within the knowledge of that gentleman
may have led him to that conclusion, but I am
bound to say no such inference can be fairly drawn
fiom the histoiy of the deposite act, or of the bill
now under discussion That act w as passed on
the 23d of June, 1836, ard during the whole ses-
sion which intervened between that time and the
present, no effort was made by the administration
oi its friends to repeal any portion of it Since
the close of the last session, the revulsions and pe-
cuniary einbariassments, so prevalent throughout
the commercial woild, have reached even l^e
finances of the Co ernment The levenuc aris-
ing from dates ha¿ been gr< t dim n shed and
the sales of pub1 c lan's Us aicl The Treasuiy
has kcome nearly exhausted, ana we are c\pies ly
told by the Secretar) ot the Treasun in lus leport,
that the funds in the Tica^ury on nV 1st Cctobei
next will be entnely insufficient foi the pavment
of the foul th instalment under the deposite act
Such is the state of tl e final ces of the United Slates,
t at the Secretary of the Tieasury find' it necessary
to recommend the issuing of Tr-asury notes to
meet temporarily the expenses of G ivernment
With all these facts before me, sir, I am led irre-
sistibly to the conclusion, that the measure oi ígi-
nates from the actual nece sity of the case, and not
from an} hosihty to the deposite act Whatever
mav be the fate < f this bi'l, ti°iefor , the fi urlh
íustalmei t cannot be pa d Ihere are no funjs to
meet it
But it is said bj some honorable membns of tl is
committee, that it is the duty ot Congress to autho-
rs a loan for this purpose I admit tins is the
only alternative, and the consideration oi this pro-
position involves quest)ans of a most grave and
imponant character
In the first pmce, it is very doubtful whether
Congiess have power to boirovv money for such a
purpose    The eghth section  of the Consti'utton
59
give  to Congress " the power to borrow money on
the credit of the United S a'es " Taken in connec-
tion w th the tenoi of the oau ptovisions, it seems
fa r to infer the true construciion to be, that money
may be borrowed to pay the debts, and provide for
ihe common dele ice and general welfare, of the
United States It cannrt be suppesed that the
framers of that instrument intended this powei
should be exercised in tbe manna proposed—that
money saould be bonowed—that a national debt
should be cicated, foi the sole p irpose of deposit-
ing the mone) vy^th the Sta'es A stuct construc-
tion of that instrument would hardly warrant such
an inference
But, sr, even if such a law wen- not unconstitu-
tional, it would be apiecedent entirely new, and in my
opinion, of the most dangerous tendency The act
of 18"?6 only proposed that a sinpiui actually in the
Treasury should be deposited with ihe States A.
veiy different question is now presented Wo arc
noyv asked to fo a step farther, and borrow money
for that purpose To borrow money and pay in-
terest on it, and loan it to the States without interest
If nine millions may be bonowed by the Geneial
Government for such a puipose—if this principle
is once established by such a precedent—loans foi
hundreds of millions imy yet be effected for distn-
bution among the fetales Sir, this viould bean
alluring bait—a golden prize It would endanger
the independence of the soveieign States It wou'd
place them in a situation of dependence on the
General Government incompatib e with thur true
interests, if rot with their separa'e existence, and
these immense debts of the Geneial Gov eminent
could only be paid by an excessive tariff, oi by
other diiect oi indirect taxation of the people
But it is said by some, that withholding this
instalment is a breach of contiact .md In otheis,
that it is a violation of good fai i tow aids the
