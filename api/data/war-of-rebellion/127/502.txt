letter of credit or order for the $157,250 on Messrs. Cahuzac &amp; Co. had not been accepted. We deemed it no more than our duty as your agents to give him a little friendly counsel, and get the money and deposit the same in the Bank of Spain. Our reasons for giving this advice was simply this: On our arrival and since the money market here has been excessively tight, and the extent of our purchase being for the amount as per memorandum of folio 9 [PAGE501], the amount drawn for might subject the parties to some inconvenience and us to some disappointment, for in pricing the articles and quality and quality we were asked in more than one instance how payment was going to be made. Our reply was by draft on Messrs. Cahuzac at sight. Fort the powder and caps this was declined, the parties saying they would take a check on the Bank of Spain or the ounces for their bills, but not a draft on Cahuzac & Co. Whether there was any foundation for this distrust of the house of Cahuzac & Co. or not we cannot say, but seeing a feeling oested in the community we thought it our duty to have the aforesaid amount transferred into indisputable safety, knowing full well the Confederate States could not afford to have that amount locked up. This advice, which we thought prudential, Colonel Lewis deemed unworthy of his consideration, he declining to act accordingly.

On the evening of July 20 we introduced the gentlemen from whom we could procure the munitions of war to Colonel Lewis. They discoursed on the subject for some time, during which Colonel Lewis manifested such a feeling of distrust or want of confidence in them and ourselves that after we (Colonel Lewis, Messrs. Chalard and Betterton) left they resolved to have nothing to do with him, and so informed us, as per the annexed letter from them to us. * And to this letter we particularly invite your attention, to further show you with what good feeling and confidence we were esteemed. On our arrival in Havana, so confident were we of our mission that we advised Mr. Lavedan of the quantity of arms we wanted. To accommodate us he sent to Portio Rico by steamer for 3,000 of the arms and paid for the same, but in the transaction and interview he had with Colonel Lewis he (Colonel Lewis) became so odious that he (Mr. Lavedan) refused to hold further intercourse with him (Colonel Lewis), and pocket all the loss attending getting the arms from there, he seeing very plainly from the spirit of our contract nothing could be done whilst Colonel Lewis held such reins on our actions.

In relation to the officials of this island, we can assure you greater sympathy could not be manifested for any cause than the one you have the honor to direct. As proof of which we will relate a conversation that look place at the Quinta, the summer residence of Marshal Serrano, the honorable captain-general of Cuba, between him and the president (judge) of the supreme court of the island:

PRESIDENT OF COURT. Well, Marshal, how are our friends in the South getting along? Have you any late news?

Marshal [SERRANO]. Very well, and advantageously at last accounts. But here is my friend, Mr. Lavedan, and enthusiastic friend and warm admirer of the South, who can freely express himself on the subject when others who are as good friends to the South are precluded from manifesting their feelings.

We also have the honor to report that every encouragement was given us and facility promised by the officials under Marshals Serrano and other authorities of this place (Havana) to consummate our mission, when at the same time we were cognizant of the fact that per-
