to adopt a measure which must lead to this pressure on the!

Bonds') I would at this time press neither These considera-l
tions bring up at once the 8ub ireasuiy scheme and the me-l
tallicouirency They are all cognate branches of the sama
system of measures, and ont oí them cannot be properly con'
sideied disconnected with the others
As to this new expedient of Sub Treasuries, 1 am opposed to
it in any and everv form m which it can be presented This
new expedient1 yes, sir, the old word experiment is somewhat
odious, 1 have not heard it from the mouth of an Admimsuation
man for some months No, sir, itis an ugly word 1 fear that
if the present regime is to continue, one half of the words of our
language will become equally odious I like thisnew word bet
t r it is singularly appropriate it is one evidence of a better
state of things—that the lack Cade banner, which has been lor
e'ght long year  floating over us, with the motto " hang all the
schoolmas'ers," has been lowered The meaning of this word
"expedient," is "means employed in an exigency" If our
whole languase had been searched, a word more singularly sig-
nificant could not have been found But I cannot consent, by
this dangerous expedient, to relieve our rulers from an exigency
lito which they have been led by confident folly and reckless
ignorance I have been too long denouncing tins scheme Of
bub'I leasuries as a tremendous engine of power and Corrup-
tion ta support it now, although It may be called hy another
name By giving to a coiled anaconda a harmless name, I will
not be induced to lay my head upon it It is said that this is not
a Sub-Treasury system Indeed' will some gentleman inform
me what has heretofore been understood by a Sub Treasury
system? Will he give some definition of such a system which
does not describe that which is proposed to us? It is the very
system which was first suggested by a very worthy gen leman,
with a very savage name, (Mr Gouge,) with the exception that
It does not specially direct the sliding shelves and hydrostatic
balances In every important particular, in every point oí po
litical danger, In surrendeung to the President the unlimited
control of the public purse, it is the piecise system which a
few short months since was so generally and justly denounced
It is, sir, a Sob Treasury system I go farther—it is not only ihe
embryo,it is the living form and shape and substance of a Go
vernment bank, and that in its most dangerous form Sir, it is
one of the most melancholy signs of the limes Th" sword of
the Government was absolutely surrendered to the late Preei
dent. The present incumbent not being exactly the man to
wield the sword of Achilles, as if in the yery wantonness of a
surrender of every guaranty of public liberty, it is-now pro
posed to surrender to him a  instrument more compatible, but
not less powerful—the purse of the country Is any patriot
willing, on the eve of a warmly contested election, (in the city
of New York, for example,) upon which the destiny of the Re
pdblic may depend, to trust five millions of the public money,
with the power and the temptation to use it, in the hands Of one
man, and that one man the appointee of the President, whose
very bread may depend upon the tesutt of that election, as it
may turn m favui or against the Administration? Suppose a
wicked and ambitious man filling the Piesidental chair, (and
these are things to be lookt d to and guarded against, for confi
dence is not a lepubhcan virtue,") will he not place at the head
of these treasuries his own corrupt minions and pai aeitesi Are
you willing to place in his hands twenty millions, to corrupt
your people and perpetuate his power? I said, sir that it was in
fact a bank 1 care not by what name you may designate it
It is admitted to have that character as a place of deposite
Will the system not also necessauly involve the business of dis
count or exchange? How ateynur funds to be transferred fiom
places where they are redundant to places wheie there are
none'' By hauling money fiom jNew York—say to Pittsbuigl
No, sir, but by drafts or bills These bills will be bought at a
premium, when above par, at less, when below par What
power of speculation and fraud do you not thus place m the
hands of your agents? How many losses shall we opt suffer
fiom bills thuspurchased and not paid* Who is to lose in such
cases, the Government or the agent? We shall have hundreds
ofapphcationsto release oui agents from such liabilities, 01 the
same chaiacter as the famous Purviance claim But it may be
«aid that transfers will be made by drawing dralts on those
p'aces where the funds most accumulate Does not every one
see, by whatever name you may call it, that this will makeof
the agency in New York a great cential power, around which
the whole sjstem must revolie, dependent upon it for light,
heat and mstion? Thenas to issue Is it not pi oponed thatihe
drafts of these agencies, and the Tieasiuy notes about to be
issued shall be the cuirency? It will then be a bank ol issue,
depesite and discount, and m lis tsorst foim, with gieater mse
cunty, ffreatel power and temptation to speculation and dis

Why, sir, shall webediiven into tin" dangerous and untiltd
expedient, when, to say nothing ol other plans that of special
deposites with the banls is bum in eveiy possible point of
view! In&pam, wheie as'jstem of Sub Tleasitries exists, H is
estimated that not moie than one louilh ol the revenue re
ceived ever finds us way into the public 1 reasury In Fiance,
not mote than half The banks will be more cheap deposi
tones, all will admit, moie secuie.astheie-ponsibili y of the
banks will be greatei than that which can be secured fiom a

me state a ese, and, stating it furnishes the ¡insw er 1 *o mil

President The same amount is deposited with a,bank-of -ar
million capital, receiving thesau e compensation, to fceftSvideu
amongst a thousand stockholders over which is the President
likely to wield the greatest power? Would special deposites
with the banks increase their power? I cannot, for the life of
me, see how But the banks, it ísraid, are not tobe Hasted Is
this true, sir? Will any man rise in his place andsay that he
would fear to deposit* his own money, jewels, or pla'e. in a
bank, orthat he would have the slightest doubt of having them
restored!  him on application; Bui, the banks have stopped
payment, they are, therefore, broker la an inability to pay
specie equivalent to insolvency? Between man and man is it
so regarded? Does he who holds the note ol his neighbor for
one bundled dollars, who is woith one hundred thousand, re
gard his debtor as insolvent, or his debt insecure, because he
has not the hundied dolíais in specie' The piomise of a bank
to pay K no more than that of an individual It is a piomise
which places it in the power ol the cteduor, m both cases, to
exactspecie, or tosaenhee the property of the debtor if he fails
to pay it, with this decided advantage on the part of the bank-
that the creditoi íslully informed of the condition of the bank,
and well knows that the bank has more notes out than it has
specie, and moie than in times of pa lie and apprehension can,
by any possibility, be ^mmanded The credit is not given
on Ihe faith of the bank having specie, but that it has piopettv,
oi, what is the same thing, liens upon ihe propprty ol its deb't
ors, to meetits engagements, that property, being a measme ol
the value of which constitutes the gieat value otspecie, and to
buy which, specie isalone wanted
Take, as an example, the condition of the deposite banks m
the State of New \ork They had, at the dateof our tastan
nual Treasury report, $4,087,t7i m specie, to meet demands
upon them of 844,737,475 and jet, knowing this, the¡Secietary
made his deposites, and gave to Congress the most confident
assurances that the public money was safe eso it was, sir, not
because the banks could pay all their obligations m specie, but
because they could pay, and have paid, nearly the whole
amount m that which alone was expected
Ihe oanks not only acted wisely and honestly m stopping
at the lime they did, but they would not have acted thus ii they
had continued to pay until their last dollar was exhausted It
would have given a preference to some bill holdeis and deposi
tore overothers—thai very preference which it is the object of
a bankiupt system to jncvent, and might, beside-, have put it
out of then power lo pay their other debtors anything No,
sir, the banks are not only entiled to the appiobation, hut to the
gratitude of the countiy, and that they have received both, is
conclusively s town by the fact that eveiy where the people
have abstained from the exercise of their powei to coerce pay
mentsinsp ele They have stood—nobly have they btoud—
between the people and general bankiuptcy I hey have done
more have enabled our merchants to save their own high cha
rtcter and thttof the countiy fiom the infamy of paying their
debts by wilful and fiaudulent bankiuptcy—a course reconi
mended to them by those, and the organs of those, in high
But, Mr Speaker, the insolent effiontery of these charges
upon the banksmust excite a just indignation, when it is seen
that every single act imputed by the Government to the banks
as a crime has been committed by that very Government, not
only without excuse, but with aggravated enormity 1 he Go
vétnment has stopped paying specie, when it is unquestionably
m its powei to do if It may atany day raise funds in specie by
loan, the banks can not The Government has caused, by its
action, theimpossibihty to pay specie, the banks have not The
Government, whilst it refuses to pay its debts in specie, demands
specie ofits debtois, the banks only demand the same currency
that they pay I ake the conduct of the Government in the mat
ter of the French indemnity, that indemnity, rather than delay
which fot thiee months, until the meeting of the French
Chambers, we were welt nigh being involved in war Alter it
was obtained, instead al allowing the claimants to draw foi it,
and have the premium of a foreign bill on their own money, it
is delayed lor a year, that it may be bi ought home in specie, at
the loss of the premium, the delay, and the expense of transpoi
tation When it arrives, is it paid in specie to the claimants by
the Government, their mere agent? Oh' no, sir, but in paper,
and the very next day the man who was refused his own speci-
fic money, if he owes to the Government, (yesteiday his debtor,
and lefusmg to pay specie) is forced to pay lusown debt to the
Government m specie If the banks had been guilty ol conduct
so fiagiant and flagitious, what shouts of indignation should we
not have heaid from one end ol the Imion to the othei Í Bui the
banks have shipped specie to England—a charge, I believe,
wholly without evidence, but, if nut, has not the Government
done the ver) same thing? Jias it not veiy lately paid a debt to
the Barings m specie'—to those odious Bannss, who ha\e been
guilty of the unpardonal le offence of placing lntl is young ami
vigorous ewnntiy, with its immense energies undeveloped, that
capital which we needed, and giving the sole contiolot it to
American citizens But, at worst, it is but a dieoilmmallen be
tween creditors, anda charge tor it comes with an ill grace from
a Government which pa)s us, who h&ld tbeiod ovei them, in
gold, whilst they pay to the time worn veleians of the ltevolu
tion, and to the soldiers in jour Florida campaigns, bank rags
Sir, unpudenceand etTiontety can <;o no further
I am, if possible, still moie opposed to the othei untried expo
dlent, of demanding the dues of ihe Government in specie I
will not venture oil the experiment in the pi esenI condition of

almost desperate disease I wi 1 not \ entute on another and a

deep witheting, and permanent. It does seem that philosophy
has been teaching by example to,little purpose In every ami
lar crisis in other countries  the conduct  f Government has not
been like that proposed to uswthe cold, selfish, and heartless
policy of the greedy miser sternly exacting his own dues, and
careless of the unit ersal suffering of pthers No, sir, it has been
kind, paternal, wise, and efficient, taking their lull share of the
suffering and embarrassments of their people—rejoicing when
they rejoice, sorrowing when they sorrow
On the bmsting of the Mississippi bubble in Franco, when
the indebtedness of the people was more than the value of the
whole propei ty of ihe kingdom—a ume ofdismayanddespan—
the Government slepped forward and restored confidence and
business, and gave repose and happiness to its People The
same was the course of England on the blowing up of the Mis-
sissippi scheme
A moie striking instance perhaps, than either, was the me-
moi able yeai in England, of 1793, a period ol unprecedented
embarrassment and difficulty The Government came for-
ward, not as a grinding creditor, but to relieve the general dis-
tress by the issue of five millions of exchequer bills The fiat
of Omnipotence could not have been more instantaneous than
the effects of this order Before one cent was «sued, confi-
dence was restored, and not more than half the sum ever was
drawn bo it would be here. Our Government has it in its
power, by the simplest means, to re establish confidence, and
restore business to us accustomed channels But it can not do
this by expressing its own distrust, by the demand of specie
Our who'e d sease 1 as been more a disease of credit than of
currencv It is the fashion to say that our currency lb redun-
dant Willi gentlemen, before they talk of redundancy, tell
me what is their measure of the proper amount of cuirency—
what propottion to the value of property, to importations, or
internal commerce? When they shall have §xed upon this
standard, they will have done what the ablest writers on | ohti
cal economv nave huherto failed todo I venture the proposi-
tion, that, according to all the established indicia of redun-
dancy, our currency never has been redundant Will yon lake
as a standard the cunency of Fiance? By the last accounts Í
have seer, the specie alone of France was £120000,000, or
about SbOO 000,000, if to this you add a million of paper, you
have $700,000,000, with a population just double oui* But it
is a law of currency ¡hit it is required m an inverse nllo with
the denstness ol i opulatitn Our peí ulation is moie diffused!
than that ot Trance and ourmtemal commtrce much grtdtei
lam satisfied that we requne as much cunency as France,
yet ours is «140,000,000, less thin one fourth I speak of pa
per; for specie, for years, has not been an articlepf cuuency,
but of commerce
But take the established entena—the rate of exchange, oi
the maiket price of bullion; and neithei has indicated any ex
cess But these are umertam, and liable to variation from
other cause* There is one rule which, in my judgment can
not fail It is this can articles be purchased in our cur ency
and sold in a foreign market, where the currency is sound, at a
profit, after paylMg expenses? If so, our currency can not be
unsound, or else an unsound currency is as good as a sound
one, foi this thing of excess ol currency only exists in. relation
to other countries. By tins standard, our currency has never,
been sounder than it is now Will y«u take the specie basisT
tNever has that, either m the banks or m the country, been
greater than now in 1833 it stood thus 817,000,000 specie Io>
$78,000,000 circulation, now it is, even after the banks have
beeo depleted by the panic, «30,000,000 specie to 8140,080,000
circulation If you take the aggregate specie in the countrj,
we have 880,000,000 of specie to «140,900,000 of circulation, a
larger basis than has existed at any former period No, sir,
with our sparse population, vast internal commerce, and unde
veloped energies and capacities, twice the amount of currency
that we have ever had would be a blessing inslead of a curse
We have only been enabled to get along at all, by the deficiency
of currency being supplied by bills of exchange and other
forms of credit
It is a mistake to say that our paper has depreciated Spe-
cie has appreciated papei, to every other article, hears the.
same relation it has heietofore done Specie is in greater de
mand The great law of demand and supply, which is the
foundation principle of the whole system of political economy,
applies to specie as to every thing else The return of Bona
pane litnii Elba raised the market price of specie, m one

game and apprehension which was cauped by the war of the
overnmei.t on ihe cuirenty, as evidenced by the Treasury
