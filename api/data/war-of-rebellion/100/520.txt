Honorable C. A. DANA,

Assistant Secretary of War, Washington, D. C.:

SIR: By direction of Major-General Halleck I send to you the records of the late rebel War Department found at Charlotte. I was informed of their being at that place by General Johnston, soon after the surrender of his army, and sent an officer of my staff to take charge of them and bring them to this place. A few of the boxes had been broken open, and the contents, principally flags, scattered about. Doubtless some of them have been carried away. All that remained were carefully collected and replaced in the boxes where they seemed to belong. I inclose an invoice of the boxes. They are in charge of Captain N. P. Stockwell, One hundred and third Ohio Volunteers, who is the bearer of this letter.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.
