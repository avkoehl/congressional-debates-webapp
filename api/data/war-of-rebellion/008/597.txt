enforcing heavily from above, two large steamboats having arrived in the course of the night heavily loaded with troops.

Please hurry forward the five infantry regiments as rapidly as possible, as I must assure Plummer's position against any attack whatever. I thank you heartily for your friendly congratulations upon my promotion.

I am, general, respectfully, your obedient servant,

JNO. POPE,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

CAIRO, March 8, 1862.

Major-General HALLECK:

Pope's messenger just in. Lodgment at Point Pleasant made where gunboats cannot dislodge them. River closed to transports from below.

G. W. CULLUM,

Brigadier-General.

CAIRO, ILL., March 8, 1862.

Major-General HALLECK:

Commodore Foote says it is impossible for fleet to be ready before Wednesday, and I hope General Pope can maintain position until then.

Can you arrange to meet General Buell in Louisville on Monday? If you leave Saint Louis Sunday evening by way of Mitchell's you can reach Louisville on Monday morning. It seems to me important that an interview should take place, and thus fully understand the work before both. Please answer.

THOMAS A. SCOTT,

Assistant Secretary of War.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE MISSOURI, Saint Louis, March 8, 1862.

THOMAS A. SCOTT,Assistant Secretary of War, Cairo, Ill.:

Two additional gunboats (unarmored will do) should be sent up the Tennessee. I have just received General Pope's dispatch of the 5th, saying that he occupied Point Pleasant on the evening of the 4th and could hold it. If so, perhaps he had better hold on and not withdraw his forces. I am anxiously waiting for further information.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE MISSOURI, Saint Louis, March 8, 1862.

Brigadier-General CULLUM,Cairo, Ill.:

I have this moment received General Pope's dispatch of the 5th, saying that he had taken and could hold Point Pleasant. This may change the programme and it may be advisable for him to remain.
