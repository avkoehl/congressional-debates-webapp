the distribution land bill Sir, our truest glory
Will be, not in distributing money, but in aug-
menting our population, m filling up our whole
country with a hardy and industrious people, not
in restraining, but in encouraging emigration, not
in keeping States out of the Union, but in bring-
ing them into it, not in retarding, but in mcreas-
ir-goui agricultural products, and he whose course
here shall cause the settlement of a single State,
nay, of a single county, will acquire more glory,
and confer more lasting benefits upon his country,
than he who shall extract for distribution millions
of dollars, extorted by a heartless, speculating
policy from the pockets of a suffering and impov-
erished people But the Senator from Kentucky
asks, why Was not the graduation principle of
this bill founded upon an actual valuation? Does
not the Senator remember that this principle was
incorporated in the bill reported by the committee
at the last session, that it was then stricken out
by the almost unanimous vote of the Senate'
But the Senator from Kentucky deslíes us to wait
until 1841, and why  That he may then have
the census of 1840, from which to draw new dis-
criminations and excite new jealousies between
the old and the new States No, sir, now is the
proper time to act upon this bill, not only for the
benefit of the new States, but to supply the wants
of the Treasury
Mr BENTON said that the Senator from Ken-
tucky, in examining the report made of the return
of sates, ha"d oveilookeda portion of thedocument
Had he examined that part of it, he would have
found the information, the absence of which is so
much complained of This answer, which is the
subject?of tío much animadversion, was made out
at my request As a member of the Committee on
Finance, I called at the Department, and requested
the clerk to furnish these details, and to send them
to me the next morning, when the bill was to be
taken up The clerk was requested to give the
amounts, excluding fractions, which are not neces
sary for purposes of legislation He thought that
this course was equally dignified as the reading of
newspaper paragraphs and letters, and making
them the foundation for charges in that Chamber,
or a Senator getting ^tp and stating things as facts
which he did not know 6f his own knowledge
If arty Senator desired this information, which is
now said to be important for correct legislation
on this subject, why did he not call for it' He
could have got it without any difficulty many
days -ago The Secretary of the Treasury was
arraigned—and he had been the subject of many
arraignments lately—for not furnishing the de-
tailed statements and tables on which his opinion
was formed—he was blamed for not putting on
one page of this document, what the Commit-
tee on Finance had already placed on the other
Now, sir, we all know the Secretary is a hard-
working man, but 1 hope the Senate will excuse
Hm for not performing this unnecessary labor
Mr President, you hav« been m Congress a quar-
ter of a, century, ami I would ask you is there any
subject upon which we have more printed inform-
ation than this subject of the public lands' Why,
sir, we have entire volumes of figures on the sub
ject The Finance Committee had all the ttesired
information before them, without calling on the
Secretary for a single item of information We
had it all before us
Mr B here read details of amount of lands in
the States subject to be operated upon by the bill
He went over the new States, one by one, and
showed that all the information was before the
Senate which the subject required, and far more
than was used by those who- were calling out for
more, without seeming to know how much was
already on hand. He was certain that there was
full ¡«formation before the Senate, ahd that there
had b«en(n  compromise of senatorial dignity in
the manner of obtaining it
After áotrte remarks from Mr  MERRIGIC,
Mr WA1/KER observed that the Senator from
Maryland [Mr Merrick] had offeree a resolution
to call for the quantity of land sold since the 30th
of September, 1837, which liad, in January last,
been returned by the Secretary of the Treasury
as having been in market five, ten, fifteen, and
twenty years prior to the 1st of January, 1833
Mr. W regretted that this information was flot
No. 4
now before the Senate, for he was convinced that
the returns of sale would show that m very many
of the land districts these lands, if sold m the
time to come, at the same rate at which they had
been disposed of during the last year, would not
be sold at the present mmtmum price m a period
exceeding that which had elapsed since the form-
ation of the world And m relation to the entire
aggregate of these land?, Mr W was persuaded
that the returns would show that a present sale
of all these lands, even at twenty-five cents per
acre, would be a better financial operation than
to sell them within the time designated by these
returns, (calculating the los*s of interest,) at $1 25
per acre Unless the Senator from Maryland
can produce some document which Will show that
these lands will sell in sixteen years at the pres-
ent price, he ought not, as a financier, to oppose
this measure
January 3, 1839
TheSenate resumed the consideration of the bill.
Mr CLAY, of Alabama, observed that the
proposition of the Senator from Kentucky was the
first that he had ever made in favor of actual set-
tlers on the public lands It c*me unfortunately,
however, at the present moment, as the existing
laws gave the preemption right to the actual set-
tler till the 22d June, 1840 This fact Would he
ascertained by looking at the act itself, whidi Was
approved 22d June, 1838> declaring in the very
first clause, " That every actual settler of thepub-
' lie lands, being the head of a family, or over
' twenty-one years of age, who was in possession
' and a housekeeper, by personal residence thereon,
1 at the time of the passage of the act, and for four
' months next preceding, shall be entitled to all
' the benefits and privileges of an act entitled ' An
' act to grant preemption rights to settlers on the
« public lands,' approved 29th May, 1830 "
But, as he said yesterday, where was the neces-
sity for recommitting this bill, when it was open
for amendment? Would this recommittal have
any other effect than that of defeating the bill by
delay * The gentleman had spoken of the immense
quantities of public lands subject to the Operations
of this bill But the gentleman omitted to mention
the length of time that a vast portion of them had
been in the market without finding porehaaers
Mr 0 thought the provisions of the bill, in all
its bearings, were well understood, and, therefore,
it Would be much better to amend it in the Senate
than to send it back to the committee As, hepre
sumed, the question on the gentleman's motion
was divisible, he moved that ihe question on the
several branches of recommitment, and of instruct-
ing the committee, be taken separately, and that
they be taken by yeas and nays
The yeas and nays were accordingly ordered
Mr CLAY, of Kentucky, asketl if the Senator
from Alabama intended to say that the preemption
law of last session gave the actual settler the right
of entry at one dollar, or at seventy five cents per
acre, as his remarks would bear that construction
If bo, the Senator was certainly mistaken Mr
C said he thought it much better to recommit the
bill with instructions, -as the committee-room was
much the best place for remodeling it so as to make
its details conform to the principle contained in the
instructions
Mr CL AY, of Alabama, said he did not wish to
be misunderstood He certainly agreed with the
Senator from Kentucky, that the preemption act
did not, without a further provision, give to the
settlers the right to purchase, at the reduced
prices, but what he meant to be understood as
saying was this the law of the last session did
give the right of preemption to every settler on the
public lands, whether the lands occupied by him
had been offered at public auction or not! and if,
said he, we reduce the price of the public lands I
by this bill, the individual occupant would have
the right to purchase at such reduced price This
law, then, would operate to give the settler not
only the right of preemption but that right at the
reduced price He had no objection to hrmt the
right of preemption at period  after theTeduction
But he-Wished that, for «certain number of months
after the reduction, the occupant jrbould have the
Tijght of preemption.   His object warn to protect
the occupants, But not to limit the fight of pur-
Chasing these infertor lands to occupants alone.
His object was to let all the lands embraced by
the bill be subject to sale at the reduced prices,
whether occupied or not, always, however, giving
the right of preemption to the occupant for atimei
Mr WILLIAMS, of Mississippi, said, that he
did not rise to enter at large into the discussion of
this subject, already so ably elucidated by Senators
i in favor of the passage of the bill, but merely to
reply to that portion of the speech of the honorable
, Senator fiom Kentucky, based on the report of the
i Secretary of the Treasury, exhibiong the sales
I of land under s treaty made with the Chickasaw
! Indians m 1832, which treaty containsa provision
for the graduation of the price of the land on
principles precisely similar to the provisions of
the bill now under discussion,'but much moré
rapidly than the provisions of the present bill.
Sir, (said Mr  W ,) the provisions of that treaty-
are, that all land  offered for sale, and not sold 
shall be subject to private sale or entry for on*
year thereafter, at $1 25 per acre, after which time
the bajartce remaining Unsold shall-be subject to
sale or entry at one dollar per acre for the space
Of one year, and that tor und durisg the third
y*«ar, the remainder shaM be¡ subject to sale  <w
entry at fifty cents per acre 
By this treatylhe. Chickasaw Indians ceded a
country containing a fraction less than sixmiihona
of acres; the treaty also contained aproíísioh-for
allowing the Indians liberal reserves, winehvittei*
settled by the constituted authorities at about
three thousand three hundred sections,.equal to
two millions one hundred ami twelve thousand
acres, (he spoke from memory,) being n re thaii
one tnird part of the whole territory ceded by the
Indiana to the Government The country was
then, for all practical purposes, a country of re*
fuse land at the date of the President's first proc-
lamation of a Bale But the honorable Senator',
finding from the report of the Secretary «£ the
Treasury that less land had been sold on the third
year, when offered at fifty cents, than was sold
either of the twopreceding yearsathigherprices,
assumed the position that tlie gale of the whole
public domain Was limited to a demand of about
three and a half millions annuaUy, a*id eame to
the sage conclusion that the sale would not bef at
all promoted by a reduction «f price, Mod as evi-
dence of the «orreethess of this pewjoj , h« main-
tained the more the price was tfedaced fefy the
operation of the Chickasaw treatyr teas' land "was
sold Mr. P/esldent, <said Mr W,,) the Se sf-
tor held up this report of the Secretary of the
Treasury, and exultmgly proclaimed ~K t  be &
refutation of the graduation principle' Mr. Wl
would call the particular iattetjiiKsn ¿f the honor-
able Senator to the subject On the coirecliiess of
this position he would fearlessly risk the fate of
the bill now under consideration It appears by
this same report of the Secretary of the Treasury
from which the gentleman read, that the first sale
of the Chickasaw land in Mississippi was com-
menced on the 4th day of January, 1836,at which
sale 960,023 acres were offered, and at the close
of the sale there remained unsold and subject to
sale at private entry 576,892 acres at $1 25 per
acre for twelve months thereafter, during which
time 207,545 acres were «old, and that during the
second year, when the land was subject to entry
at $ 1 per acre, 37,016 acres were sold, amounting
to an average sale of 101 acres per day, after
which timé the land remaining unsokl was subject
to sale or entry at fifty cents per acre, and so con-
tinued to the dgte of this report, the 30th of Sep-
tember, 1838, embracing a period of near ten
months, during which time 53,565 seres were
sold, being at the average rate of 197 acres per
day, nearly doubling the sale of the previous
year
And now, Mr President, (said Mr W,)letuB
examine the second sale began on the 5th Septem-
ber, 1836, there was then offered 2,601,130 acres,
and at the close of the sale there remained of the
land then offered and unsold 2,026,127 acres, sub-
ject to private sale for one year thereafter, daring
Which time 189,500 acres were sold at fl 25 per
acre, being at the Average rate of §19 iteres per
day, and that of the balance remaining ansold,
and subject to entry during tire eeeosid year, at
