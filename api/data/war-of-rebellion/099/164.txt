through the water along the wagon road. I think the water must have subsided enough for this. Also let a party take tools and prepare on the railroad causeway a place (countersunk) for two guns in embrasure. Report to me what it seen by night. I will remain here till I hear from General Slocum about Robertsville, when the whole army will move north, leaving you to cover this point. I deem it important to hold the position on the railroad for some time, say ten days, after I leave, and during that time to feel across the Salkehatchie in the direction of Charleston, so as to destroy the railroad as far toward the Edisto as possible. As long as the railroad is intact up to Salkehatchie you will see an enemy may rapidly interpose between here and Port Royal, which might incommode us. At the same time General Foster will try and cut the road between this and Charleston, the effect of which will be to make the enemy guard the road in its whole length. After I have reached the Augusta road I do not think this road will be of much use to the enemy.

I am, with respect,
