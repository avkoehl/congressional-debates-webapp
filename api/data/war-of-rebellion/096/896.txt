I will send on the first train by a staff officer the original dispatch from General Sheridan, which was sent you by telegraph as soon as received. This dispatch was sent by Lieutenant-Colonel Boice, who was not the commander of the detachment, and was not delivered to me until 3 p.m.

WINCHESTER, March 8, 1865

Honorable E. M. STANTON:

General Sheridan's report has already been forwarded by telegraph.* The additional particulars I can get are that Colonel Thompson, who brought back the prisoners, on reaching Harrisonburg learned through the inhabitants that Charlottesville had been captured by General Sheridan; that Sheridan had with him his pontoon train, artillery, and all wagons intact; and that he was over the worst part of the road. When advancing it was ascertained at Staunton that Thomas' scouts, or those from the West, had already been there. Colonel Thompson was sharply attacked in front and rear at Rude's Hill, but repelled the attack and lost none of his prisoners. Four dispatches were sent here in advance of Colonel Thompson, but none of them have reached their destination. At Staunton, on his return, Colonel Thompson heard a rumor that a large force of ours was approaching Lynchburg from the west. Colonel Thompson's impression seemed to be decidedly that General Sheridan's thoughts and movements were still onward.

W. H. EMORY,

Brevet Major-General.
