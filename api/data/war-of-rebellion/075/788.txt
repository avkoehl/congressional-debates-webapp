D. WEST,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
HDQRS. DEPARTMENT OF ALA., MISS., AND EAST LA.,Meridian, Miss., June 23, 1864.

Brigadier General GIDEON J. PILLOW,

Commanding Cavalry:

GENERAL: General Lee received your telegram from Gadsden, requesting him to make a demonstration upon Rome, Ga., and in reply thereto directs me to say that it is impossible for him to do so, as the whole of his force is now required in Mississippi, to meet several heavy raids which are now threatened by the enemy. A. J. Smith is reported to have a large force at Memphis, preparing to move, and a force is also reported to be collecting at Vicksburg. Under these circumstances it is necessary that all his available force should be concentrated to meet the enemy. The general has ordered rations and forage to be collected at Blue Mountain and Oxford for your command.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WILLIAM ELLIOTT,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

JUNE 24, 1864.

General BRAXTON BRAGG,

Richmond:

Lieutenant-General Hood, on our left, reports that, being attacked on the afternoon of the 22d, he drove back the enemy, taking one entire line of his breast-works. The pursuit was stopped by exposure to fire of fixed batteries. Stevenson's division mainly engaged; Hindman's slightly. Brisk skirmishing on Hardee's front much of the day yesterday, and a good deal of cannonading on Loring's.

General BRAXTON BRAGG:

Generals Hardee and Cheatham recommend the promotion of Colonel John C. Carter, Thirty-eighth Tennessee, to Wright's brigade, regarding General Wright physically disqualified. Carter has commanded the brigade gallantly and well.

J. E. JOHNSTON,

General.
