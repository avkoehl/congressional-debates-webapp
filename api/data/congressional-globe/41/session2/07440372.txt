Bat though, his report abotfnds in hypotheses
atid calenlatio'n's based on estimates and sup-
positions," he notvhere tells or attempts to tell
us -tfhat -\Ye would have been made to pay the
British iron matter for his inferior pig, bar,
sh*eet, arid rails if the American production of
pig-iron had ttot b*6fen more than doubled since
the establishment of this duty, and if the man-
ufacture of cast-steel and Bessemer rails had
not also been established at so many points
within our liiuitg. He is not ignorant of the
fact that in little moire than a year past sixty-
five Jiew blast furnaces have" been erected,
and that they are to employ a portion of the
people of fifteen States. Six of them are in
Ne«r York, one in Nevr Jersey, nineteen in
Pennsylvania, one in Maryland, four in Vir;
;inia, six in Ohio, five in Indiana, three in
llinois, five in Michigan, two in Wisconsin,
six in Missouri,' three in Kentucky,_ one in
Georgia, two in Alabama, and one in Ten-
nfesSee. These furnaces have increased our
productive power to nearly two million five
hundred thousand tons per annum._ Arrange-
ments are also making for the erection of more
than fifty other furnaces during the year upon
frhich we have just entered, many of which
have been commenced. The estimated prod-
uct of pig-iron for this year is two million two
hundred and twenty-five thousand tons, or about
fifty per cent, of the annual average produc-
tion of Great Britain.
These facts are, I repeat, known to the Com-
missioner; and he knows also that by a law as
inevitable as that of gravitation domestic com-
petition increasing in such a ratio must at an
early day bring down the price of iron as it has
that of wheat and flour, and of knit and other
cotton and woolen goods, to a point beyond
danger from foreign competition ; and by thus
relieving us from dependence on England for
the first essential in a great war, will also make
us her competitor in the markets of the world
in a field her supremacy in which has hitherto
made her the commercial mistress of the world.
I will not offer an estimate of what would
have been the price of pig-iron had not the
product, embracing the three Qualities of iron,
namoly, Nos. 1, 2, and 3.
Wo respectfully express the conviction that tlio
foregoing average cost of tho product of the furnaces
wo roprosont is below the average cost of the product
of American furnaces collectively; it being our belief
that wo represent interests having important eco-
nomic advantages.
In viow of tho foregoing statements wo respect-
fully ask as an act of justice to tho Commissioner, to
tho producer of American pig iron, to tho public and
to its Representatives in Congress, that you will make
a special and searching inquiry for tho data on which
tho Commissioner has based his statements, and into
tho accuracy of our statements as above, that the
truth inny bomadepublic and error, however strongly
indorsed, be effectually confuted.

necessities of the Government compelled it to
impose a duty that was protective and which
justified men of enterprise in opfening coal
mines and ore-beds and erecting furnaces ; but
to enable gentlemen to judge for themselves, I
submit the following. On pagel^ of the report
I am considering the Commissioner says:
" How great the demand of the future is likfely to
prove may be inferred from the circumstance that
while tire per capita consumption of Great Britain
and Belgium, after allowing for exportation, has
reached one hundred and eighty-nine pounds per
annum, the present annual consumption of the Uni-
ted States is not in excess of one hundred pounds
per capita. No nation, furthermore, afc the present
time, with the exception of Great Britain, is pro-
ducing pig-iron in sufficient excess of its needs to
allow of a surplus for exportation; and in Great
Britain the prospect of any future increase is entirely
dependent upon the uncertain condition of her being
able to supply coal on a scale of consumption that is
already in excess of one hundred and four million
tons per annum."
On page 3 of his report made January, 1869,
Mr. Wells tells us that—
"In France the annual product of pig-iron'was in
1SC61,253,100 tons, and in 18671.142,800 tons, showing
a declino of 110,300 tons.
"In Austria the official returns of the iron trade
show a diminution of forty-two per cent, in 1866 as
compared with 1860, and of sixty per cent, as com-
pared with 1862."
And in that valuable paper, the report of
A. S. Hewetl, esq., United States commis-
sioner to the Paris Exposition, we learn that
ours is almost the only country in the world
that can largely expand its production of iron.
Mr. Hewett agrees with Mr. Wells that it is
problematical as to whether England can for
the present increase her production mate-
rially. He thinks she may maintain her present
position among other continental producers;
but beyond this he does not think she can go,
by reason of the depth of her mines and the
"intrinsic difficulties of producing the re-
quired supply of materials and labor, without
an enormous increase of cost."
The iron production of the world for 1806,
as stated by Mr. Hewett, was as follows:

Thus it appears that with a production of less
than ten million tons for the world's supply no
other country than ours is in a position to make
a large and immediate addition to its annual
production. The difficulties in the way may
be briefly stated thus: Sweden possesses ex-
haustless supplies of the richest primitive ores,
but she has no coal, and her annual production
of charcoal-iron is believed to have reached its
limit. Her function will henceforth be to mine
and export ore. Iiussia has ample supplies of
ore, but so far as exploration has yet discov-
ered is deficient in coal. She can, however, for
i some time somewhat augment her production
! of charcoal-iron. Austria, Italy, Spain, and the
I States of the Zollverein have ore, but little or
J no coal available for iron-making, and are
; unable to extend, if they can maintain, their
present production of charcoal-iron. France
has neither coal nor ore sufficient to supply her
wants. England furnishes her with one third
the coal she now consumes in the manufacture
of iron. Little Belgium has both coal and ore,
and they are advantageously situated, but the
field is so contracted that she cannot increase
her production beyond her own wants, and
Prussia is a large importer of coal and pig-iron
from England. So much for prospective in-
crease of supplies; while, as illustrative of the
growing demand, I need only allude to the
gigantic systems of railroads buildingin Russia
and India, the latter at immense cost by Eng-
land, in the hope of impairing our supremacy
as producers of cotton.
Had we continued to rely upon England for
pig-iron in excess of our capacity to produce
it at the time of fixing nine dollars as the duty,
and also to draw our supplies of cast-steel and
Bessemer rails from her, the extension of our
railroad system must have been cheeked and
the per copj'toconsumption of iron in this coun-
try been much restricted. For nine years
before the imposition of that duty our annual
production had been less than 800,000 tons,
and that of England had not increased at the
rate of 100,000 tons per annum. Our demand
increases at the rate of from 170,000 to 200,000
tons per annum. Whence but from our own
ore beds and coal mines could the supply have
been drawn? The production of pig-iron in
England and the United States from 1854 to
1862 inclusive was as follows :
United
England. States.
1851 3,069,833 716,674
185 5 3,218,154 754,178
185 6 3,586,377 874,428
185 7 3,659,447 798,157
185$ 3,456,064 705,034
185 9 3,712,904 840,427
1860  3.826,752 913,774
186 1 .3,712,890 731,564
186 2 3,943,469 787,662
These figures show that the two great iron-
producing countries of the world, England
and the United States, increased their joint
production less than one hundred thousand
tons per annum for nine consecutive years,
while we alone demand an increase of at least
one hundred and seventy thousand tons, and
prove the assertion that but for the applica-
tion of an incentive to the production of iron
in this country the expansion of our railroad
system and our general material progress
must have been impossible. Was there any
charm by which an increased supply could be
evoked? Was there any means by which the
disparity between the wages of English labor-
ers in iron-works and such as were essential to
the support of American citizens who might
engage in similar employments could be coun-
terbalanced? Yes, Mr. Chairman, there was
one, and that was applied. It was such a duty
as would give capitalists and men of enterprise
a guarantee that if they paid workmen fail-
American wages for building furnaces, digging
and hauling coal, ore, and limestone, and con-
verting them into pig-iron they should not be
undersold in our own markets by the produc-
tions of underpaid British workmen. Nine dol-
lars per ton it was believed would give them
1hat guarantee, and yet leave our markets so
largely open to English competition that we
should derive more duty from pig-iron than we
had done under lower duties.
I have spoken of the difference between the
wages of English and American workmen. Let
me show how great it is. The English shilling
is twenty-five cents of our money. Commercial
men know this; there are, however, many of
our people not familiar with the details of com-
merce and the exchangeable value of money to
whom it may be proper to state the fact. Turn-
ing again to the report of Mr. Hewett, which I
recur to frequently and always with a renewed
sense of obligation, I find the rates of wages
paid in England in 1860 to have been as follows:
