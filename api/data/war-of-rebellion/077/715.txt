shoulder shift," and not to fire until the taking of the work. The left was ordered to skirt the river-bank, and the battalion to guide by that flank. The regiment then moved along the river-bank under cover for 150 yards, until the head reached the Federal line of rifle-pits; here a halt was ordered, skirmishers were thrown out, the line formed, the colors unfurled, the advance ordered. The appearance of the regiment on the crest of the ridge drew the enemy's fire. I ordered "forward, double-quick," and the charge began. I had scarcely taken the work until an order reached me to return at once. Retreat was ordered, and the line reformed in the ravine whence it started twenty minutes before. The whole distance passed over was near 1,500 yards. The enemy recovered from his fright, and while I occupied his works reformed and moved for my rear, and rendered my position very hazardous. A fleet foot saved the regiment. On the rifle-pits a few of the enemy were killed. As Captain Rolph was retreating a rebel seized him by the collar, and paid the forfeit of life by a stroke from the captain's sword. One of the enemy laid hands upon a soldier of the Fourteenth, and the soldier dispatched him with the stock of his musket. A sergeant started to rear with a prisoner, a corporal with another, but finding it impossible to bring them away they sent them to seek medical aid among their friends. Captain C. W. Baker brought off 1 prisoner and delivered him into the hands of the provost-marshal. Three wounded and 1 man killed of my covered by the fire of pickets thrown out from the command; the others were recovered the morning of the 29th. So far as I an ascertain, and I have sought the truth earnestly, only two men left their arms on the field. The wounded man found near the enemy's line the next morning had his gun under his head. Sergeant King brought away his own and two of the enemy's rifles. I submit a list of casualties furnished me by Doctor Charles W. Oleson, assistant surgeon, list marked C. * I append a diagram, marked D,+ kindly furnished me by Lieutenant H. H. Guernsey, of my command.

I can only speak in praise of the officers who assisted in the work. Lieutenant-Colonel Corbin, Adjutant Avery, and Sergt. Major George Griffith did excellent work. No officer failed to discharge his duty. During the night of the 28th Lieutenant-Colonel Corbin, in charge of 250 men, picketed the left of the line and annoyed the enemy who spent the greater portion of the night in digging a new line of rifle-pits nearer to our line. Toward morning of the 29th I became convinced that a movement was being made by the enemy toward our right, and so notified the general commanding. At early light I ordered a reconnaissance and found the enemy had withdrawn from the front of the left, which fact was promptly communication to the commanding officer. By direction of Colonel Charles C. Doolittle I reconnoitered the ground held by the enemy in front of the left and center of our line and moved until he was found in too strong force for my command. A line of battle was formed under a brisk fire, was retired and hidden under the crest of a ridge, the skirmishers were pressed forward, and an officer sent to post commandant for orders. By his direction the command was withdrawn and placed within the inner works. Lieutenant Charles Woodworth was killed in battle line by a musket-ball, and three enlisted men were wounded on the 30th. The command of the regiment was turned over
