WASHINGTON, D. C., February 4, 1865.

Major-General THOMAS,

Eastport:

The order was to send about 5,000 cavalry, not five divisions. Both Smith and the cavalry must have their transportation, but we want Smith's infantry sent as quickly as possible to Canby to assist at Mobile. The transportation which they cannot conveniently take along can follow as well as the cavalry and artillery. Would it be convenient to have Memphis and all West Tennessee added to your department, leaving the troops there subject as now to be moved by General Canby's orders, if required, down the river or on west side? The present department lines are inconvenient, and yet it seems important that all posts on the river should be under one command, in order to prevent Kirby Smith from crossing.

Major-General and Chief of Staff.

HUNTSVILLE, February 4, 1865.

Brigadier-General WHIPPLE:

Colonel Palmer, Fifteenth Pennsylvania Cavalry, has returned from twelve days' scout. I think Mead and his guerrillas are chased across the river. Cannot Palmer stay here? He is worth a whole brigade of most cavalry. Could not the Fifth Tennessee, now at Fayetteville, take Palmer's place at Chattanooga?

D. S. STANLEY,

Major-General.

Major-General THOMAS,

Eastport, Miss.:

Yours of February 2, directing that the division need not be sent to Eastport, is received. General Wood is at Nasville with his division, and about to embark for Eastport. I have ordered him to return. His train is probably over Elk River by this time. I have ordered it back to Athens.

D. S. STANLEY,

Major-General, Commanding.

HUNTSVILLE, February 4, 1865 - 10.30 p. m.

Brigadier-General WHIPPLE:

I received an order from General Thomas to-day saying I need not send a division to Eastport. I have telegraphed General Wood to return to this point with his division. Will you ascertain if he received it? If he has embarked for Eastport have him disembark and return here. You will find copy of the order at the telegraph office.

D. S. STANLEY,

Major-General, Commanding.
