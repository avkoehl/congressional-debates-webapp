Major-General HALLECK,

Washington, D. C.:

I have ordered the remainder of the Sixth Corps to Washington. On account of scarcity of transportation I do not send wagons or artillery, but they will follow if you say it is wanted. I think most of the 3,000 cavalry sent are fit for duty. They certainly must have reached Baltimore with the other troops. If the Nineteenth Corps reaches Fortress Monroe in time you can take it also if you deem it advisable.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

CITY POINT, VA., July 9, 1864-6 p. m. (Received 1. 05 p. m. 10th.)

If the President thinks it advisable that I should go to Washington in person I can start in an hour after receiving notice, leaving everything here on the defensive.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

Major General U. S. GRANT,

City Point, Va.:

A dispatch not signed by Lew. Wallace, but approved by him, to the newspaper press states that they had a severe battle to-day near Monocacy bridge, and that our troops were defeated and are now retreating on the Baltimore road. Knowing the character of the source, you can judge of its reliability. Nothing further from Hunter. I do not deem it safe to withdraw any forces from Har-
