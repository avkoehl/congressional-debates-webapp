HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,March 31, 1865-9.40 a.m. (Received 10.30 a.m.)

General WEBB,

Chief of Staff:

I have just received report from General Ayres that the enemy have their pickets still this side of the White Oak road so that their communication is continuous along it. I have sent out word to him to try and drive them off or develop with what force the road is held by them.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMIES OPERATING AGAINST RICHMOND,March 31, 1865-10.30 a.m. (Received 11.40 a.m.)

Major General G. K . WARREN,

Commanding Fifth Corps:

Your dispatch giving Ayres' position is received. General Meade directs that should you determine by your reconnaissance that you can get possession of and h old the White Oak road you are to do so notwithstanding the orders to suspend operations to-day.

ALEX. S. WEBB,

Brevet Major-General and Chief of Staff.

MARCH 31, 1865-1 p. m.

General WEBB,

Chief of Staff:

General Ayres made an advance with a small force at 10 a.m., which the enemy drove back and followed up in heavy force, compelling both Ayres and Crawford to fall back on Griffin, and of course in much confusion. Griffin's troops held the enemy at the run, west of the plank road. General Miles' division afterward attacked the enemy and were forced back on my right. My skirmish line in front of Griffin (most of it) has advanced on the left. I am going to send forward a brigade from my left, supported by all I can get of Crawford and Ayres, and attack swinging on our right. Arrangements are being made for this, and it will place about 1.45 p.m., if the enemy does not attack sooner.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,March 31, 1865-2.50 p.m.

Major-General WARREN,

Commanding Fifth Corps:

The following received from General Humphreys:

From the prisoners taken it is apparent that the left of Pickett's division is opposite the center of Miles. An advance of the Fifth Corps, swinging round, must necessarily take Pickett on his right flank. Pickett is the right of their line.

A. A. H.,

Major-General.
