shore, but nothing put aboard the boat. He met the Nevada eight miles this side of Saint Charles. Captain Rogers represents the earth-works and defenses at Saint Charles as very formidable, and thinks it very dangerous if the rebels are allowed to occupy them; says the gun-boats there could not keep them out. I think of sending a scout down on a boat this p. m., to go out from Saint's Charles.

Very respectfully,

Captain C. H. DYER,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Little Rock, Ark.:

General Carr's dispatch of 6.30 p. m. just received. It is impossible to spare a man of cavalry. It was as much as I could do to get sixty men to-day for scout toward Arkansas River. My force is extremely small for the work to be done here.

Very respectfully,

C. C. ANDREWS,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF LITTLE ROCK,Little Rock, Ark., September 1, 1864-8 p. m.

COMMANDING OFFICER,

Post of Lewisburg:

General West's command is across White River below Jacksonport. If Shelby wants to get across the Arkansas he will be in your neighborhood soon. Keep scouts well out to the east and northwest and be in readiness to move your whole camp at short notice. Should the enemy come, divide your force and operate in his front, flanks, and rear; General West will probably be close after him.

By order of Brigadier General E. A. Carr:

S. E. GRAVES,

Captain and Acting Aide-de-Camp.
