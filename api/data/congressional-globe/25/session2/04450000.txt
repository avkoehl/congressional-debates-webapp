1 What proportions of the imih of the United
Stales consist of free parcels estima td by weight
'i What proportion consists of free parcels esti-
mated by amount of postage, apt! paicels tlia* pay
postage, and accounting all printed documents at

3   Wli it would be the proportion of the amount

4   To how low a rate the tar if of post i?c would

all paicels conveyed by mail were char eable with

rctaimng the present franking privileges, and sus-
Min the Depaitment, with a rate of tariff deemed
judicious and propei by him, in rase such reduc-
l on should be ort'orrd

MORE
Resolved, That the Secretary of War be instruct-
ed to communicate to the House of Representatives,
at the commencement of the next session of Con-
gress, a copy of each survey, and chart ascompa-
nymg the same, that has been heretofore made, of
the shoies, harbors, inlets, and waters of Lake Erie,
also, a copy of each similar survey that has been
made of Lake Michigan.
Mr BRONSON moved to include "Lake On-
tano "
Mi. CRAEY thought that if the Committee on
Commerce had made themselves acquainted with
the character of the lake surveys, they '.vould not
have proposed this resolution Ail me surveys
heretofore had been confined to the momhs of
rivers and creeks, and were of no general ten ice
in the lake navigation. He had called the atten-
tion of the House to this subject early in the ses-
