Report of Colonel Emerson Opdycke, One hundred and twenty-fifth Ohio Infantry, commanding First Brigade, of operations August 6-September 8.
HDQRS. FIRST Brigadier, SECOND DIV., 4TH ARMY CORPS,Atlanta, Ga., September 10, 1864.

CAPTAIN: I respectfully make the following report of the operations of this brigade from August 6, 1864, when, in obedience to division orders, I assumed command, to the capture of Atlanta:

I. Found the brigade composed of the Eighty-eighth Illinois, Major Smith; Seventy-fourth Illinois, Captain Bryan; Seventy-third Illinois, Major Motherspaw; Forty-fourth Illinois, Lieutenant-Colonel Russell; Thirty-sixth Illinois, Captain McNeal; Twenty-fourth Wisconsin, Major MacArthur; Fifteenth Missouri, Colonel Conrad, all aggregating an effective force of 1,143 officers and men. It was the extreme left of the infantry forces and but a few rods from the Howard house. The First Brigade of First Division was to my right and Colonel Minty's brigade of cavalry to my left. My pickets occupied the old works, where the Fifteenth Corps fought in the engagement of the 22nd of July.

At 5 p. m. August 6 I was ordered to make a demonstration toward Atlanta, with a re-enforced skirmish line. The demonstration was continued till dusk, when the original status was resumed without casualty. August 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11, nothing but the ordinary picket duty was required of this brigade. 12th, at 11 a. m. made a reconnaissance to the front with two of my regiments and two of the First Division. Drove back the rebel pickets and got a good view of their main works on the Decatur road. Lost 1 man killed. Returned by 2 p. m. 13th and 14th, all quiet in my com-
