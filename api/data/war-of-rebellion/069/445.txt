works are just reported as well filled with men since our sharpshooters have been pushing forward. The ground in my front is well swept by the enemy's artillery and infantry, and I have no artillery in position on the line.

Respectfully,

JOHN GIBBON,

Major-General, Commanding.
HDQRS. SECOND Brigadier, SECOND DIV., 2nd ARMY CORPS,June 1, 1864-11.15 a. m.

Major JOHN M. NORVELL,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Second Division:

SIR: I have the honor to report that I sent out this morning 60 men under experience officers with orders to advance as far as practicable, to obtain all information possible of the enemy's position and strength, and so to annoy him as to prevent his leaving our present front. I find that the enemy has concentrated his fire upon my left and left center, doing considerable execution, even in rear of my works, to prevent which I am now constructing traverses. The enemy's sharpshooters are in the open plain in front of his works, covered by sunken rifle-pits. I am not able to annoy him much as I have no sharpshooters and but little cover of any kind in my front. His batteries are in the same position as yesterday and his strength apparently the same.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOSHUA T. OWEN,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND BRIGADE,June 1, 1864-2.30 p. m.

Major J. M. NORVELL,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Second Division:

SIR: I have the honor to report the enemy is still moving to the right, apparently in great haste. It is evidently his intention either to attack the right or to repel one anticipated.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOSHUA T. OWEN,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

[Indorsement.]
HEADQUARTERS SECOND DIVISION,June 1, 1864-2.40 p. m.

Respectfully forwarded for the information of the major-general commanding the corps.

I have had these reports from so many different sources that I am convinced the enemy is moving to our right, and think it would be advisable to make an assault, or at least a strong demonstration of one.

JOHN GIBBON,

Brigadier-General, Commanding Division.
