IN THE FIELD, October 19, 1862.

General WRIGHT, Cincinnati:

Your troops have nothing to guard against but cavalry raids. Let them move by rapid marches. They can draw supplies better from Frankfort than from Cincinnati.

D. C. BUELL.

LOUISVILLE, October 19, 1862.

Major-General WRIGHT, Cincinnati, Ohio:

General Dumont sends following dispatch:

FRANKFORT, October 18, 1862.

Morgan passed through Versailles this evening about 5 o'clock, with 2,200 men, to ward Lawrenceburg. I would think his object might be to try to cut off Buell's supply train. What steps can be taken you will know better than I. Can you not order two of the regiments from Indianapolis here? The whole work just done on the railroad will be destroyed without I have more force.

J. T. BOYLE,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE OHIO,Cincinnati, Ohio, October 19, 1862.

Brigadier General J. T. BOYLE, Louisville, Ky.:

You shall have the first two regiments ready for the field, whether from Illinois or Indiana. There is doubt as to direction in which Morgan moved from Lexington and whether he is still in possession. He is reported to have been positively seen near Winchester yesterday afternoon.

H. G. WRIGHT,

Major-General, Commanding.

LOUISVILLE, October 129, 1862.

Major-General WRIGHT, Cincinnati, Ohio:

Wire cut or down and your dispatch is just getting through. Morgan drove out Home Guards and two companies of cavalry at Lexington. I have no doubt Morgan will capture some of our escort, and destroy trains, telegraph, railroads, &amp;c. If I had two regiments I could protect the bridges just built. I informed General Buell that Morgan was at Lexington, and that he would destroy trains, &c., if not prevented. I have ordered Bruce to send force to Green River and co-operate with Colonel Craddock, Sixteenth Kentucky, in cutting him off.

J. T. BOYLE,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE OHIO,Cincinnati, Ohio, October 19, 1862 - 1.10 a. m.

Brigadier-General BOYLE, Louisville, Ky.:

Report says Morgan took 500 of Dumont's cavalry at Lexington. Head of one of Granger's columns at Paris, the other near Big Eagle.
