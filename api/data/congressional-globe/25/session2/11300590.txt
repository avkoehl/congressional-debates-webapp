25th Cong-««-2nd Sess.                             Independent Treasury—Mr. Southgate.                                                   H. of Reps.
ríate, ai e subsequent to the letter of Mí Woodbury, and are
eiuiieiy dt vanai ce with it How then, can liie country be
quiete i w i Iioul sumt, Cougiss^iuial action ( n the &ubject?
Mr Cüdinudii, í sha t uoi deny that a change in the opinion1!
of our iulers has taken place, but it by no means follows that
there ib to be any change in tt eir conduct, and thdtis the jm
portant thin¿ for the public It become** very necessary, there
lore, that'hebc opinions should be looked into, their nature, and
how formed, as it wiJl t-xp'am much that has taken place, and
is the only way fo detetrmnc their future action, seeing that
iiiey will give us no pledge on the subject
When the suspension oi specie payments took place, the Ad
ministration was compelled. 10 aa decisively and in great fuste
upon the sjhject It admitted of no dckiy There could be no
halt wa> ¿round They must either sustain the banks, or thty
inustgo against them This will appear very evident Irom a
slight examination
l>id they iAt the first course, doubtless the country might
h„ sooner renved Butjudginp horn experience, it would be
a work of yeais, icquire great contiactioii of the currrency,
(always accomj at leu wi li dieuess ) and much greater conceit
ot actum among the banks thar, Irom their number and dissimi
lar lnteiest--, cu ihi be expected And with alt he Government
could give, it n ight still be imposs b!e to ellect the object, (as
was found tht ca^e befoie,) without a National Bank and tint
th<* President had unloitunately pledaed himself not to grant
Any delay in the i «sumption was dangerous, nay, fatal, for
popular imhguuion would increase, and as it was well known
that the Opposition hail warned the country of this event, and
had tried to prevent it, it was veiy ceitain that the blame ol
the disaster would tail wheie it deseived to do, upon the Ad
ministration Its already shattered reputation could not with
*tand ihis additionil shock That course was therefore out i f
th question Isow, on the other side, it was doubtful whe her tht
bank  could resume when aided by the Government, it was
held móntele u that they coulu nntwhen opposed by it T ic
banks, would netessanly bt. the hrst objects ol the i eopk's ven
genance, and by being the first and 1 müest m the outeiy against
them, the Admims ration stoo\ i fan chance of tin rung the
eyes of the ( eople horn us own delmquer eies, and placing the
whole blame and puni*hmtnt upon these i sutuuons
It was seen howeisily the pub ic had been duped )> ie
fal-ehoodb propagated agamst (he United States Bank, and by
thepromistsot a better cunency II, by such a coui&e of
abuse, overwhelming detraction and gasconading promises, the
pai ty had been able to ov erturn that institution m the day ol us
prospenty, at the very moment when it was doing tite most good,
and conferring the most public bmefit, what might not be *>x
pectedby an eaily, united, and v who uve proveí ption ol the
•state ms ltutions m their then embarrassed condition? So, al o,
the opportunity was the best that had yet oocui rtd since Gene
ml Jackson ntuat attempt, peihups Wdi the only one that ever
would o„cur, to force the I eastirv bank upon the country It
was loieseen that, m a umt, of quiet diid leflecfon, it would
never be adopted, and it vaa supposed to be the only remaining
measme required to perpetuate the powei ef the party
fei-, the fear on the one hand, and the hope on the othei, wei c
too gi eat foi then vntue     I he inteiests of the country, m an
earlj and efficient icstorationofite business, were lost sight of,
and from every quar ei of the Union, prets, pen, and voice weie   ,
emp oyed to piostiate the fctau¡ institutions
But, sir, they were mistaken m more respects than one The '
confidence of the peopla had bscn too often abused to permit
e-tipty declam uion and round assertion to be aken as puor
Ihe party watchwords had lost then magic rue people hid
become jealous of power, and determined to sustain the ¡sute
banks in their efluits to lestoie a sound circulation So, i'st,
some ol the banks havealready resumed, and aotwithandin¿
the advirt- of the GI >be to ' the productive clause* ' io get a
fchare ol their gold and silver a  soon as possible, no runs have
been made upon them Much greatei unanimity and concert
of action appea-s among ihe bii ks than was expecte i All
have acted vuh gieatpiudencein prepaiing lei the event, and
confidence seems to be gradually but firmly gaming giound
In it e*a things, then, the gullibility of the people, and the
ability of the banksta usume, the AdminHtr ition has been mis
taken, and, bo far, a change ol opm.on has taken p'ace, and,
should the b inks hi ablt to persevere, it is more than i'kely > ou
will soon see, not merely a baggier heie and theie declaung
himself not opposed to the banks but the w hule par y, prcs*
and people, declai mg the same thing An! as they never ¿c ¡
knowledge an tnoi, or take any thing back, they will doubtless
(ontend that they have never said i haid word against tliem
But the question still remains, will this change of opinion
and situation of thing- produce a change n the tonduct ol the
Goveinn ent towards th* st leading mtuefctfe of the counin? In
my judsmen* this uepends very much upon another qutt-ti n,
ami that is, whethei the Administration has become van fn-d,
not on!} that the banks will resume, but that no action of the
Government can cause them to suspend again loi, eir, it
must be borne liniiiiiil that such an event hasb^en anticipate 1,
and is looked f r by the Vlminibtiat on, and until they «ne
up that ho| e, I giea Jy ¡ear ti ey will not heartny join in the ex J
enions now makti g foi the ben. fit ifthecountiy                         I
■Mr, we have abundant proofs that both theue opinions wcie
entertained, viz that the banks couid not generally resume at d
that, if some did, new explosions would take plict, in therepe it
mid*- by the chairman of the Committee of Ways and \feai sin
t he 5th of March last I will refer you to a few particulars i i

Ihe ex¡ o*ion of the ¡state bank deposite system was tnoie
cent to wanant the expectation oí M itr ewal at ar early pe lod,   I
it at all'                                                                                             !
He then thought the propoMtton to renew the connectunbe
twte i the í*oví>r iimen tat id the bank  as "eztiamdinary ' md j
he says "It would seem to be time enough to diotu^s Hb ex r c
diency after a geneial resump  on ofspecic pa>mtnts II n w
adoptt-d, he savs, we shall have tlenosite banks m the I aM ai d
an Independent Treasury in the West
Now, sir, thise will show that, so recent1? as the 5th of March
last, the party had no expectatio  of a gmtral lesumptf^n
Some banks might resume, but let us s e whethei the commit
tee thought they could tniatain themselves "they lemsik
further
"We must certainly anticipate embarrassment n some sec
tio s, and we should accordingly pitpaic fur u The banking
s>gtem of this country must be thoio&ghly refoimed, beiou con
bdence m the convertibility of bank notes can be peimpnernly
revived ?so such reform can, at this time, be anticip ueá A
lew moie disastrous revulsions ma\ compel us, at some lutuie
period, to eorieu the vices of oui ^stem, but, for the piesent, it
is evident that our local currencies are to be still further vitiated
by State legislation "
Again he tajs that the "system is liable at all tinses o ex
plosion "
Again
* U is obvious that the p^wer and the mischiefs of our "bank
mg system are about to become still moje formidable, and there
is too much reason to apprehend, in a few years, an explosion
more disastrous to all btanches of industry than any we have
hitherto felt While the States continue to multiply banks r o
effoitof the General Government, whether by a National Bank,
orat is«ue oí Ireasuiy notes, could prevert a suspension of
specie payments" !• would it least seem tobe prudent to
collect from the I nnks oui sia millions oí suspended balanct p,
befoiC we inquire into the evped ency ul again placing the Iiea
sury of the \ tilledí^ta es m jeopaidy "
A^ain
'Ine finances of the lattei mu tL°come tmbanassed at eve
ry rerulsion,solongas our revenue consists oí bank notes oi
bank deposites The conveitibility ol either into specie is
wholly i lusive, and has been hi the) to sustained by confidence
alone That confidence is now destroyed If a few banks
only had suspended specie payments Irom bad management,
cunfideuee might have been continued in others Oi jf, as in
t me of war Government had deemed it expedient to borrow
their credit and sanction its abusts, it might have revued wi'h
the return of peace," &o
It is thus very evident that the Admims lation has looked to
and calculaled upon, oihei anl fuitltei expl stons It is heie
giveo as a reason why the funds d the Government should not
ue jeopaidedeithu m the way of 'hank notes oi bank depo
sites " It is directly alleged that the.conveitibilny oí etthei is
wholly illusive, and can be sustained by confidence alone That
confidence is now tcstroyed, and Government will not seek to
rtstoie u Ihe rásemela of the system tre to become moie for
midable the local cunency still furthei vitiated by ¡state legis
lation A few more 'disastious revulsions ' are to lake place
before that 'thorough refoun" can be applied wh eh sietes
sary, and until which it will be unsafe for the Government to
have any connection with these institutions
iNow, sn, what is that' ihoioueh refoim? ' We have tm
derstood it to be the introduction of the Sub Treasury p m
Has then the Guveinmentgnen ltup? Where do we find any

Mr Chairman, I am unable to perceive, m all that hae^een
gnen to us, anv thing: that can justify me m the Isehef
that all the difficulties, and embarrassments, tfnei derangements
oí business, and '•urrenry, art!, exchanges, aie at an ene. Ai d
«owe reasons may be given why the joy marfnested by tho ger
tleuaan may be found in ioca1 and party considerations, in w nuch
the gi eat body oi the people cannot participate
If it be ti ue, as hds been said that the original experiment on
thecuiiency arose frota a títsne to change the great money
íeeulator from Chestnut to Wail street, and if it be true, as is
alleged by the gentleman from New York, that t£wer had no
bank it g c ipital adequate to the pressure" n that city, and he
pereeives m this new cneasi ie that increase of capita!, and the
change of that power of regulation, why, as acmzenof ¿sew
York, he may have cause to i^joice
I it be al«o true as w e hav< heard it ruiaored, thai there *s
to be established in that city real thirty or fifty million mon
^/eí under this n w system, *o be made the Government depo
•-itory, and which may be owt ed and governed by the Treasury
why, as a party man he may have cause of lejoicmg B it,
sn, I fail to perceive how the whole country, its business and
exchanges, are to be benefited by this new arrangement X
cannot conceive that any large bankjn New York, orelsewheie,
oi any number of them, can gi\e to the ithole country what the
Bank of the United States did—a sound currency and cheap ex
chati-.es—unless you give it the tame powers which that Bank
possessed
We m ty have a sound currency furnished by well managed
and cautious ^iate banks, but the equalization of exchanges can
only be effected by some large institution having its branches
exte ded o\pr the whole countrj, possessing the confidence and
business of the Government, and having the power of trans
ftrung i*s ~apital to those places wheie most wanted, accoidit g
to the turns of trade and changes ot season I doubt whetlier
the people of this country would consent that such power
should b*> bestowed ^n any local institution If so bestowed, it
is qut-stionahle whether the power may not be used for local
nthfci than general bertfit JNot deriving its authority frot 
Congress, it will feel no respontibihiy, nor will it submit to in
vestigauon It may be, however that these very qualities, 'he
absence of control b CongiP£:s,and freedom from search, make
it tin moie desnable fui a Sub 1-maaury
I have thus, sir, gone thiough with this subject Desultory
I necessarily had to be to meet the positions of those who pre-
ceded me It nas been my object to maintain what I firmly be
lie^e, the existence oT a hostile feeling on the part of th* Admi
mstiation against he loca! banks and that there is great reason
toieai its fuither continuance Whether the motive* I i ave a?
Miri "d f t this host hty aie the true one*, is a minor constdeia
