CONGRESSIONAL GLOM
477
this House denominated the grand inquest of the nation, if,
throughits committees, it has no power to inquire into abuses?
In the House of Representatives, 23d September, 1814, a com
mittee was appointed to inquire into the cauaesof the success
of the enemy in his recent enterprises against this metropolis
and the neighboring town of Alexandria, and into the manner
in which the public buildings and property were destroyed, and
the amount thereof, and that they have power to send for per
sons and papers
Mr Johnson of Kentucky, Mr Lowndes, Mr Stockton, Mr
Miller, Mr Goldsborough, Mr Barbour, and Mr Pickens, were
appelated the said committee
Of all delicate relations, the war arrangements of the Gov
eminent, flagrante bello, must be most delicate OJ alien
titled tobe considered at, confidential, the conduct of military
operations must be especially so
This committee summoned to give testimony the Secretaries
of State, of War, and of the Navy the Attorney General, and the
Secretary of the Treasury, besides other persons, in official and
private stations The heads ofdepaitments were questioned as
to what had occurred in cabinet council— they weie requested
to testify of what occurred during theirdeiibeiations as cabinet
officers, and they did so The Attorney Geneial(Mr Ru=>h)
testified—but with a protest—thatordinanly he might refuse to
give evidence on subjects of executive consideration, 'but he
intimated he was notiestrained by prohibitory injunctions from
the quarter whence alone they could is«ue," by which I under
stand he consulted the President as to the propnety of answer
mg the committee
These cabinet officers did testify as to the deliberations of the
cabinet
To show how far the commit'ee thought they had a right to
inquire, Mr S read a etter from the Hon William Jones to the
chairman ofthe committee
Here, then, was a committee, composed ofthe distinguished
men whom I have named, with a total want of delicacy, accord
mg to one «f the cowboys, dogging the heads of departments,
and prying into cabinet secrets '
Mr Madison at that time was President He did not regard
the pro( eedmgs of a committee constituted by the House of
Representan ves—the grand inquest ofthe nation—as transcend
mg their authority, or violating-decorum, by asking of members
of the cabinet what had been done in cabinet council Mi
Madison did not think that these cabinet meetings were held for
his "own information " He thought they were public officers
and by the directions of the Father ofthe ConstitJtion, they did
testify to the occurrences in cabinet meeting51 How ridiculous,
then, is the pretence now set up that the Commi lee on Public
Expenditures were guilty of a breach of decorum m calling for
the proceedings of public officers'
Another case In December, 18 6 charges of a very out
rageous character were preferred against Mr Calhoun while
he was Secretary of War He asked the House of Representa
uves to institute an inquiry On the 29th of December, 182b, it
was—
"Ordered, That the letter from the Vice Piesident of the
United States, asking an official investigation nto his official
conduct while Secretary of the Depaitmentof War, this day
communicated to the House, be lefened to a select commi tee
and that the committee have power to send for persons and pa
pers And Mr rioyd, Mr Wught, Mr Williams, Mr Camp
bell, Mr Clarke Mr IngersolI,andMr Sprague, weieappomted
said committee "
[Mr S here read a letter from the chairman of the committee
to the Hon Mr Barboui, Secretary of Wai, requesting his at
tendance, and stated that Mr Baihour, m reply desired that
Mr Rush, Mr Southard, General Macomb and Colonel R M
Johnson, should be summoned, and Mr Barbour, Mr Rush,
Colonel Johnson, (Senator fiom Kentucky,) Mr Southard, and
General Macomb gave deposi ions before the committee ]
As usual with the gentleman from Virginia, he contradicted
himself and o verth re w his own stafemeu tm one or two partic
ulars The first charge as to the President's letter was, that it
was a private letter On Saturday we weie told distinctly it
was a letter written ' aa President' to one of the commission
ers Where, then the impropriety of layirg before the House
this letter, which had been submitted to the committee by the
commissioner'* It was an official lettei, written by Mr Tyler
to Mr Poinuexter as chairman of the board of commissioners
So much for the charge of using a private letter
The gentleman challenge the production of proof of the mis
conduct of officers at New York Pioof fie wan s Well, sir,
if he will have patience the proof he will get, and the who e
proof that has been handed to the committee, and not merely
such parts as the President shall «ee fit to send
The gentleman disclaimed all wi h to injure the manufactur
ers Oh, h wktnd' What a sudden love has seized the gen
tleman It was only the day before he used the following" re-
marks, which I rea I from the Intelligencer, the accuracy of
which will be vouched for by all who 1 earcl them
"The whole measure originated with him, and a most impor-
tant report it is It not only involves the conduct and chaiacter
vi men in the New Yoik custom house—of Hoyt, of Cuiti*, of
Carnes, of Wasson and others in that establishment but I ran
tell New England gentlemen on this floor that it involves «some
men of the very highest standing in lioston and in Lowell—the
gentry of New England—the lushest class of capitalists—the^e,
too are involved, and if the statements m the report are true,
men of misdescription have been engaged in a conspiracy to
bribe the custom hou*e officers to seize on woollen goo Is P r

men of high standing in Boston and in Lowed, the gentry of
New England, were engaged m a conspiracy to bnbe custom

quitiesofthe protective system were expose\ in the report'
Arid yet, sir, it is very probable all this was not meant in any
spirit of unktndnefcs to the manufacturei u was only a hint
To terrify the Massachusetts delegation, by sajtng to them,
Your constituents are implicated, better smother up this busi
ness
[Mr EVERETI I wish to state that it was in consequence
of the deel nations of tbe gentleman from Virginia that the re
consideration was refused A number of gentlemen near me
from Maaaachubettg had made up their minds to vote to recon
sider, but the moment they h^ard what the een'lcman said as
to the contents ofthe reoorr, thpv changed their purpose 1
Mr ¡slANLY resumed It is only one of many instan
ees n which the gentleman has defeated his own purposes
The gentleman say* there was no blow aimed by the Pie«i
dent at the manufacturers Can it be posible that the Presi
dent dues m t dim a blow at the iniquities ol the protective sy==
tf m which is advocated by the manufacturing interest? Can it
be possible that the gentlema i s President will aim no blow to
save the Souih from the "infliction" ofthe iniquities ofthe
protective system'' Surely, the gentleman speaks without con
sideration —unless the President intends to change his ground,
or get a new conscience, upen the subject of domestic manu
factures
Among othei complaints, and of about the «ame dignity and
gravity, urged against the committee was this that the report
had not been l read to the House " I took down the words as
they weie utteied Now, sir, how many reports aie read to
this House? Not one in a hundred If all reports weie read,
the House could do no other business No reports of investí
gating committees have been read, to my knowledge, since I
have beenamembei of thisllouse
The report in March 1837, from an investigating committee
of which the gentleman was chairman, wai made on tht 31 of
March Congress aljoumed next day Was this report read?
The report contained 91 pages and the journal contained 318
prges besides an appendix of 153 pages Were all ihese read?
No sir, there was not time, it won] 1 have been unusual and
ridiculous So in another repoitofSi p3ges (ftom Mr Gar
land's committee, in February, lo^?,) mdj mrnal, with accom
panyina p tpeib of 636 paees—aieport mate March 1st, 1^7
Was thi , were all these papers read to the H >use? ' The gen
tleman was on that committee ateo No sn, they wtre not
leid I venture to ^ay, sir that much of the matter accompa
nymg those íeports was nevei read by the committee
The gtntleiridn says th^t justice requires that the whole truth
should appear This is exactly my opinion This the < om
mittee on Public Lxpenditures thought would he be^t effected
by their couise especially when they saw the monstious doc
time avowed by ti e President The committee thought they
perceived a design m the Piesident to usp the report foi his
own tnformaton, and they thought that ( ongre^s had some
thing to do with it So will this House and this country think,
and like tie committee the honest people of the country
wilt be astounded at the doctrines expressed in the letter of the
President
But the gentleman's ' delicacy" has been shocked at the i lea
of taking this report from the Pjesident's keeping let us see
what precedents have been established a<? far as the gentleman
from Vjigmia is concerned, in procuring information, docu
ments, and papers from executive officers During the 21
session of the 24th Congress a committee was appointed whose
duty it was, aimng otherthings to inquire whether any agent
ofthe deposite banks was employed 'at the request or thiough
the pro uretnent ofthe Treasury Departmeit ' No delitacy
here towards executive officers He elet me correcta mistake
Ithougnt it wa*i piuvedthatMr Whitney was employed at the
request of the department It seems this was nor so But the
minority of the committee—the gentleman fiom Virginia being
one^-contended he was so employed, and endeavoied to a^cer
tain from him on what terms he was employed and how pa d
In prosecuting their delicate inquines, they asked the following
question
"State whether any agent oi agents, in cornexioo with any
officers ot the Government, or any other person or persons,
company or companies, have oi have not been engaged, either
directly or indirectly, m speculations in the public lands, in
Tiea--uiy certificates of deposite, since the issuance ofthe
Treasury order oi July II, 1836 or in the stocks of banks, corpoi
ations &c and w)"ihci such speculations have or have not
coi si tuted a part oí the compensaron or emol meni of said
agent or agents of the dep site ba iks  '
A motion was made to strikeout thewoids '^nyoffi er or

Wise No 194, befoie referred t  He 'dpsented ' from the
majority of couise    Y\ hen did he assent to any thing tliat he
did not originate and control?    Speaking of things to be exam
med, he says
''A.mong these, the first in importance, and the first pro&esed
to be examined, were the subjects of Executive patronage to
the public press, nf Executive appointments to office, of the
application of contingent items of appropriation, or inegular
expenditures, allowance^, and paymen s, and of sinecures "
This I think exhibited as great a want of delicacy as the pro-
ceedings of any other committee And then the gentleman in
troduced a resolution calling for—
"A list or lists of all officers, or agents, or deputies, who have
?g2n appointed, or employed and paid, since the 4th of March,
1829, to he 1st of December last, by the President, oi either of
said heads of departments, respectively, without nomirauon
to, or the advice and consent of the Senati of the United States,
showing the names of such officers, agents, or deputies, the
sums paid to each the sprvices rendered, and by what authoi-
ity appointed and paid "
Now, sir, I ask, would not the services rendered have shown
a few Executive reportsj Most unquestionably, if the resolu-
tion ha I been answered
I must, sir, at the risk of bnng tediou3, furnish the House
with a few more extracts from this report I read the following
extract from page 27, and almost thought some one was speak
mg of the present times    listen «ir
"Usurpations are rare, they are generally flagrant, and
they rarely ever are the cause, butoftenerthe effect, of corrup
tion
"The latter first steals into the administration of the laws 
and then prepares the pretext for the open aggressions of the
f >rmer
' The fewaccounts which may havf been paid to printers be
yond what the Jaw allows, were nothing, compared to the cor
rupting and bribing abuse of legal authority, to discharge a
long established press, with extensive circulation and numerous
subscribers, from the prin mgof the lawsand public adveruse
ments, because its polmcs happened not to agree with the powers
that be, or with the men who were to be in power, tmd to estab
hsh with pledges ofthe Government patronage, a new press,
without subscribers, and without c rculanon, except through
the franking privilege of privileged partisans for the uses of
party, and to organize these pens oned presses thus brought m
existence by the generating power of corruption into a com
bmed phalanx of types fiom one e"d of the Union to the other,
speaking the came words echoing the same sentiment, prais
mff or denouncing the same men or measure? riepnndeot ani
living -md moving, and having their beinD m the same fiat of
Executive will "                                                  «
Tim though not strictly ippl cable to the t-ubject, is certain
ly applicable to the times
But here is an extract that does bear on the subject now under
Cunsideration    Listen
"An oflicei is one who perrorm«i public service, and i eceives
payana emolument from the Government The Constitution
prescribes ihe mode in which officers shall be appoint  d The
principle is sacred an 1 vital to a Republic that the public offi
cers, their pay and their duties, shall be known to the people
and their Representatives morder that they may be duly re
sponsible, and at all times amenable to them It was repre
spnted to thecommittee that many ofiicers or agents had been
appointed, employed, and paid by the Executive, who are not
known to the Constitution and the laws, and whose emoluments
were not appropriated by bilk before they were employed and
I aid by the President, without the advice and consent of the
Senate, or nomination, and without the appointment of such
officeis hawng been invested in the President alone, m the
courts of law, or in the heads of departments There is said
and believed to be a long list of such officers or agents almost as
numeious as those legally appointed—"¡uch as commeiciai
agents, specialcommissiowi of various kinds, with large com-
pen^ition, as m the case of those to settle the controversy of the
Michigan and Ohio boundary line, and innumerable other
agents whose pay and service are never reported, and are
known only to the Executive "
?\ow, sir, let me atdi, if this wa<s '■orrect ooctnne as stated by
the gentleman himself in 1839 is ¡t not correct now? Was Mi
Pomdexter perfoi mmg "public service," receiving emo'ument
from the Government, oi was he only procuring "information"
fir Captain Tylei i To «¡ay nothing at present of the right to
institute ^uch a commi^ion where ia the ' sicred and vital
