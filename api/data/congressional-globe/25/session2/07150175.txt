25th Cong-"'2nd Sess.                         Making public officers depositaries—Mr. Norvell.                                                         Senate.
the rums of the Bank of the United States and the
State banks Sir, this position of the Senator is
sustained by his mere assertion alone The bill
affords upon it? face the most decisive evidence of
the fallacy of the assertion There is not a bank
feature in the bill, any more than is there in the
counting-house of a merchant, who has a till or a
vault to keep his money or his papers m I leave
the gratuitous assumption of the Senator on this
point to the people, who are as capable of reading
and understanding a bill as we are
The Senator chaiges the late and present Admi-
nistrations with a design to overthrow the S ate
banks Nothing is to be found in any message of
either the late or present President to justify this
accusation The late Administration, both in
word and action, exerted all its efforts to sustain
the State banks They were its pets Sir, these
banks have overthrown themselves, as far as they
have been overthrown, by thfnr own improvidence,
theii avidity for gam, and perhaps their anxiety to
accommodate The system of State bank depo-
sites was continued by this Administration until
that system put an end to itself The recommen-
dations of the present Executive are not now, and
never have been, adverse to the State banks, pro-
perly conducted They are adverse to their excesses
and their abuses The Administration, having
failed in their zealous and liberal attempts to ren-
der the Stale banks safe depositories of the national
revenue, have been dm en to suggest a more safe
mode of public deposites, one more under the con-
trol of Congress and the Executive, one 'which
prevents the public moneys from being used for
speculating purposes, and at the same time leaves
the State banks to the exclusive control of their
directors and the Governments of the several
States The Independent Treasury system while
it. will bring the sound Slate banus up to the right
standard and principle of useful and safe banking,
•will, I have no doubt, hasten the day of final settle-
ment, to which the unsound institutions must come,
and the sooner they arrive at that period, the better
for the people, the country, and the currency of the
country The bill before the Senate will not over-
throw the State bank system It will correct and
keep it m check, it will give it more stability, and
thus secure to it more of the public confidence
The substitute of the honorable Senator from
Virginia [Mr Rives] proposes the restoration of
the system of State bank deposites, -which has just
been tried, and signally failed The modifications
which he suggests render the s} stem, m my judg-
ment, infinitely worse than that which was its mo-
del The Senator limits the number of deposite
ban us to twenty-five Why he nas fixed upon
that number, it is difficult for me to perceive We
have twenty six States- and two Territories m the
Union But let that pass The limited number
proposed is a monopoly of public favor, w hich will
create discontent and dissatisfaction, engender bad
feelings and exciting rivalry, and produce a con-
stant succession of agitations, which will not only
reach the Executive mansion, but these hall' In-
stability and change in banking operations will ns-
eessanly follow But, sir, the honorablp Senator
introduces a new feature into the Constitution of
this Government Heretofore, Congress have ne-
ver been called on to approve, by joint resolution,
the selection of deposite banks, or the appointment
of public agents An innovation fraught with
more mischief could not, in ray opm on, have been
proposed to this bod) Sir, what will be the in
evitable effect' The Secretary of the Treasury
will select the deposite banks He will send them
to the two Houses for their approbation The dis-
appointed bank applicants will besiege these halls
to effect a rejection of the nominated institutions,
and to substitute their own A scene of elec-
tioneering, deception, perjury, and perhaps worse,
will open upon us Senators from the same State
will differ as to the soundness, safety, and ability
of the selected banks The two Houses may -"li-
fer Individual members may be tampered wi i
The golden apple of discord may be thrown wuhin
these sacred walls, dedicated to the enactment of
salutary laws for the promotion of the public wel-
waie Who, sir, can contemplate such a state of
thmgs without trembling for the consequences upon
the purity of the legislative department of this Go-
vernment' Sir, if it were possible for this suboti-
lute" to be adopted, the dangerous feature to which
I have called your attention ought certainly never
to receive the sanction of this body
Sir, the honorable Senator from Virginia [Mr
Rives] told the Senate, in a speech delivered here
four years ago, that the Bank of the United States
had wantonly inflicted distress npon the country,
with the obvious design of influencing and control-
ling your proceedings If that was the case then,
it is much more obvious at this time, that whatever
pressure may have caused the suspension of specie
payments in May last, no pressure now exists to
justify the continuance of the suspension The de-
sign is to control your pioe edwgs In truth, sir,
I have heard and believe, that some of the leading
banks, which now refuse to unite in the resumption
of specie payments, have determined to persevere
in that course, until they coerce this Government
into an abandonment of the plan of divorcing itself
from the banks a« its fiscal agents and depositories
I acquit the banks in the city of New York of that
purpose They have determined to resume It
remains to be seen, Mr President, whether Con-
gress or the Legislatures of the States are to be cor-
rupted and driven into a base surrender of the po-
litical powers of the country, its liberties and mde
pendence, into the hands of irresponsible banks?
Sir, he must have closed his eyes to passing trans-
actions, who has not lately witnessed the fearful
strides of thi= moneyed power to dominion ovr the
whole lep vlation of the country He must have
been purposely blind, who has not seen its disas-
trous mfljence in obtaining legislative instructions
to honorable Senator-, here, to vote against a mea-
sure intended to effect a separation of Bank and
State, and esserlial to the protection of American
legislation from the contaminating impur ties of
bank operations I deep'v regret, sir, to find the
honorable Senator from Virginia, of whose purity
and patriotism I have never doubted, drawn into
an apparent support of bank interests, at the ex-
pense, as I think, of the Republican institutions of
the nation The Senator, four years ago, had the
firmness to stand up against all the bank clamor
and menaces of the day, "and to regard the cause
of the Constitution and public liberty as dearer to
the American people than the transitory state of
the money maiket " Sir I quote the language of
the honorable Senator on that trying occasion, when
I express the hope, that we shall now follow his
noble examp'e then "If we yield to the panic
with which we are now assailed, and restore to the
banks the deposites which they have justly forfeit-
ed," the triumph of these institutions will be com-
plete, and their domination m the politics of the
country \n ually established They will alike
"overshadow the Government and the peop'e " I
thank the honorable Senator for teaching me that
phrase These coi pora tiona penetrate eierj pa-t
of the Union, and act m solid phalanx to sustain
themselves and each othei, and to break down the
Government to their purposes Restrained w ithm
their proper bounds, permitted to exercise no
influence m the politics and measures of
tie Government, the connection with them
dissolved, they will attend to their appro-
pnate banking duties, they will keep their
issues within the possibility of ¡edempion,
they will afford moderatp facilities and accommo-
dations to their fellow citizens, their paper wi'l
have a \alue corresponding with that which it
professes to represent, and the country, and the m
stitutions of the country, will not find in them an
interest adverse and hostile to them "Sir, «aid
the Senator, on a formei occasion "of all the re-
forms, social, political, or economical required bj
the great interests of the country, that which ¡s
most urgentlj demanded, and which promises m
its accomplishment, the largest results of -utility
s cunty, and public benefit, is,beyond compirism,
the restoration of the Goiernment to «hat it was
intended b} the framers of the Cons itution to be,
a haul money Government' It is, Mr President,
this reform which we are now striving, to a certain
extent, to accomplish and I am sorry that the hono-
rable Senator from Virginia has so far changed his
views, as that we have lost his co-operation to-
wards its accomplishment That which the Sena-
tor then thought more deeply interesting than any
other reform, to the safety and prosperity of the
country, the requirement of the public dues in
specie, he now, unfortunately for his feiends, con
siders Utopian and impossible That which he
then thought "an object worthy to engage the most
anxious labors of the patriot and statesman," he
now denounces as pernicious *nd fatal to the pub-
lic interests He then conjured honorable Sena-
tors, with whom he is now co-operating against the
hard money system, to leave the Bank of the Uni-
ted States to its fate, and to bring forward their
powerful aid in an effort to restore the Government
to its, true constitutional character and destination
—"that of a simple, solid, hard money Government "
Now, when we are making the effort to restore
the Government to its true constitutional charac-
ter and destination, the Senator has volunteered
against us, has withdiawn from us the aid of his
powerful talents, has lent them to the enemies of
the "simple, so'id, hard money Government," and
charges us with "fostering a popular prejudice
against banks, as a fund for political speculation,
at the expense of all the sober reajities of life, and
the practical, pervading, and hc4MM ed interests
of the conntr} " Sir, I un ite the Senator from
Virginia to a reperusal of his speech on the remo-
val of the deposites I appeal from the Senator
as he now is, to th  Senator as he then was I re-
gret that the Senator has so often produced the
authority of Edmund Burke in support of his
views The name and the fate of that talented
man are of evil omen He commenced his public
career as a patriot, of free, liberal, firm, Whig prin-
ciples He ended an apostate, a champion of
the di\ me right of kings and queens, and a pen-
sioner upon the administration of hi  enemies Sir,
the purp mind of the Virginia Senator, educated,
as he was, at the feet of the great Gamaliel of Re-
publican learning and liberty, should revolt from
deriving its supports, its principle  or illustrations,
on any occasion, from such a source as Edmund
Burke Another passage, of British history is
worthy of his profound consideration Need I
name the coalition between Charles James Fox and
Lord North, which fixeo a lasting stigma upon the
character of the illustrious English Commoner'
Let the honorable 'Senator ponder on what may
be recorded of these our times by the future his-
torian'
Mr President, the honorable Senator from Ken-
tuck} [Mr CrAY] has lately taken frequent occa-
sion to rem nd the majority of this body of their
obedience to Executive commands, of their being
tie household troops, and of prostiatmg themselves
at the feet cf the Executive Such language is dis-
respectful to the S nate I do not belie\e that the
Senator mtende i to insult us But let me remind
htm of the per od when, m another part of this
bu lding,he was the aVe and eloquent Republican
s n porter of the idmimstiahon of James Madison
Lef n e remind him that he and the majority acting
with him were then denounced, bj some of his pre-
sent allies, m language similar to that in which he
has permitted himself to indulge towards the Re-
publican majority of this body at this trme Let
me tell him of the indignant rebukes which such
lai gnage cilled down upon their heads from his
lips, and that reminiscence will bring home to him
what we ought to feel and what, I trust, some of
us do <eel, at his íeproaehes, even if ne have too
tamelv forborne to give utterance to the mdignation
which mw weiesowell calculated to excite In
the e-lei ated position which the Senator occupies in
v ew of mat, still more elevated, to which he as-
1 ires, I submit ft it u does not become him to use
woids which imply as httie respect for himself, as
'o many of thi se w ith w horn he is associated m
legislation
We hive heard much heie of pension agents,
ind of their use of the public money as a compen-
sation for their tro lble Wh\ sn, this is no new
thing- The 3> atonal Bank perfoimed the duties
oí pens on agents Did it do so for nothing? No,
sir It performed these and other duties m conside-
rs on of the use of trie public deposites committed
to its charge Its average annual compen ation
was at least half a million of dollars
