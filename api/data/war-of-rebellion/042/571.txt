The amount of funds in my hands is nominally &amp;7,000,000; from this deduct amounts advanced to the disbursing officers of the quartermaster's, commissary, ordnance, and engineer departments, uncovered by warrants, &2,270,000, and two war warrants in favor of Major J. F. Minter, chief quartermaster, drawn on the Treasurer in Richmond, cashed by me, &2,300,000, leaving on hand &2,700,000 in round numbers. By advises received a few days ago, there was in the depository at San Antonio &1,000,000. There are several other depositories in this State appointed to forward the funding of Texas notes. From the fact that their instructions, mailed in Richmond, did not reach them (some of them), and they applied to me for information and instructions only a few weeks before the time for funding expired, I infer the amount of funds in their hands is inconsiderable, amounting in the aggregate to, say, &1,000,000; thus making total amount in Texas, &4,700,000. The amount in the other portions of this department I have no means of knowing; it is probably as much more, or, say in the whole department, &10,000,000.

The funds in my office were received from-

Confederate States war tax of 1862 and 1863.........&1,944,600

Sequestration fund.................................. 817,000

Agent Confederate States produce loan............... 218,500

Founded in 8 per cent. on certificates.............. 1,872,000

Founded in 7 per cent, on certificates.............. 1,905,000

---------

6,757,100

The bonds to lift my certificates have not been received. The amount required to pay the interest on the public debt and the notes mutilated and canceled will be about &500,000.

The secretary of the Treasury, in one of his reports to Congress, estimates the amount of Treasury notes held in Department of Trans-Mississippi-I quote from memory-at &150,000,000. This estimate, I presume, is made from the records of his office, showing amount sent out. Of this a large portion, probably more than half, is 7.30 interest notes, which enter but little into circulation, being held as investments. From the frequent applications made to me to receive funds on deposit and give certificates payable at the Treasury in Richmond, thus serving as exchange, I am satisfied many millions have been sent to the States east of the Mississippi. I applied to the Secretary of the Treasury for permission to receive such deposits, thus accommodating both the people and the Government in the transmission, but he declined for want of authority from Congress.

The estimates generally made of the amount to be collected in money in this State for the Confederate States war tax for 1863, due this mouth, is &15,000,000.

On the arrival of Lieutenant-General Smith in this department last spring, the major-general commanding informed me that he was forwarding a report of the military status of the district to General Smith, and suggested to me to forward what information I could about the money resources. I did so, under date of 26th of April, stating the amount in my hands, and that a large portion of it was funded notes, which I had orders from the Secretary of the Treasury to cancel, but had withheld the execution of the order because drafts on me to large amount were held by disbursing officers, predicated on funds sent from Richmond, which funds were detained in Jackson awaiting safe transmission, and which might fail to arrive in time to meet the necessities of the officers holding the drafts. I suggested to him, in view of the increasing danger of crossing funds over the river, and the possibility
