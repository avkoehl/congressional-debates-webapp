Please report your three-years" regiment to General Banks, and send it on without any delay to New York; and also the seven militia regiments as soon as filled up.

COLUMBUS, OHIO, October 31, 1862-4.30 p.m.

Honorable EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

are the drafted men to be organized into companies before being sent to old regiments? If not, what officer will take charge of them?

DAVID TOD.

WAR DEPARTMENT,

Washington City, D. C., October 31, 1862.

Governor TOD,

Columbus, Ohio:

The troops assigned to old regiments are not to be organized into companies, but when reported ready an officer from each regiment will be detailed to go to the rendezvous and receive the men for his regiment.

Where this would occasion delay some other officer will be detailed for that duty on notice of the men being ready reaching the Department.

If it be properly explained that the men thus secure the advantage of being under command of tried and experienced officers they will greatly prefer the old regiments to a raw organization.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

COLUMBUS, October 31, 1862-5.30 p.m.
