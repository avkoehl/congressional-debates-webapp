ALEXANDRIA, October 17, 1864.

(Received 5 p.m.)

ASSISTANT ADJUTANT-GENERAL, DEPT. OF WASHINGTON:

Colonel Barnes, at Fairfax Station, has satisfied himself that 200 or 300 rebel cavalry are now south of him near Braddock road. The telegraph line is not working beyond Manassas. Have you any cavalry to send out in direction of Burke's? Anticipating Mosby's next appearance at this end of the line I have strengthened it very much.

Respectfully,

JNO. P. SLOUGH,

Brigadier-General.
HDQRS. DEPARTMENT OF WASHINGTON, 22ND ARMY CORPS,October 17, 1864.

Brigadier-General SLOUGH,

Military Governor of Alexandria:

Dispatch received. There is no cavalry to send. Notify Lazelle, at Falls Church, that he may not be surprised. Your infantry certainly is strong enough to hold any force of Mosby's in check. I shall endeavor to communicate with General Augur and ask what cavalry may be sent in pursuit.

Respectfully,

J. H. TAYLOR,

Chief of Staff and Assistant Adjutant-General.
HDQRS. DEPARTMENT OF WASHINGTON, 22ND ARMY CORPS,October 17, 1864-8 p.m.

GENERAL: Mosby has driven in Lazelle's pickets. Send Wells' cavalry, if any is in Alexandria, to Lazelle, and let the Fifth Wisconsin move rapidly to Annandale. De Russy sends infantry to Fort Buffalo. Be pleased to expedite the movement as much as possible.

Respectfully,

J. H. TAYLOR,

Chief of Staff and Assistant Adjutant-General.
