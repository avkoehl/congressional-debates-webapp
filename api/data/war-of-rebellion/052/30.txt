CINCINNATI, August 14, 1863.

Major-General BURNSIDE,

Camp Nelson, Ky:

Arrived this morning. Colonel Boven will go to Lexington this evening. Does General Potter's division come through Cincinnati, or will it go through Louisville? General Ferrero is now in Louisville. The great scarcity of boats at vicksburg has been much vexation. The strength of the corps is very materially weakened by the campaign. the sudden death of General Welsh is a very severe shock to us all.

I have concluded to have the Ninth Corps all concentrated at Cincinnati. Please give orders accordingly.
