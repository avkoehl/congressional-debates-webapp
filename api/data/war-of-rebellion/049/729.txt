ENGINEER BUREAU, October 1, 1863.

Respectfully returned to honorable Secretary of War.

An officer of Engineers of good reputation has been ordered to Western North Carolina, as desired by General Whiting and Governor Vance.

ALFRED L. RIVES,

Lieutenant-Colonel, and Acting Chief of Bureau.

OCTOBER 1, 1863.

ADJUTANT-GENERAL:

If Corse's brigade be returned, it might be expedient for General Pickett to extend command to Weldon and leave General Ransom's brigade in part free. Suppose you consult General Pickett on this point.

SECRETARY OF WAR:

I have seen and conversed with General Pickett, and we both think I would be unwise to send any part of Brigaider-General Ransom's brigade to Western North Carolina, General Hoke having been sent some time since by General Lee with sufficient force, including a regiment of Ransom's, besides cavalry, for this purpose.

S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General.

STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA, EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT,

Raleigh, September 14, 1863.

General WHITING:

MY DEAR SIR: By the occupation of East Tennessee by the enemy, the mountain region of North Carolina has become exposed to destructive raids and incursions of the Federals and tories.

Large numbers of deserters are also crowding in there.

The mountains have a strong force of warlike militia, used to the rifle, who are calling upon me to organize them for a fight. I desire to send them an engineer to show them how to fortify the passes, &amp;c., and a brigadier to organize them and command. Can you send me the engineer-an active, intelligent man, who could comprehend the topography and probable operation of a large extent of country? Let me know immediately.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Z. B. VANCE.

GENERAL ORDERS, HDQRS. CAVALRY CORPS, A. N. VA., No. 3. September 17, 1863.

Officers immediately in command on the battle-field will be held to strick accountability for the safety of artillery operating with their commands. They will see that a sufficient support of cavalry sharpshooters is in every case specially charged with its support and protection at all hazards.

By command of Major General J. E. B. Stuart:

H. B. McCLELLAN,

Major, and Assistant Adjutant-General.
