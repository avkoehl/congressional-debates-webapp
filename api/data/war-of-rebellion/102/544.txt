HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE MISSOURI,Saint Louis, Mo., May 22, 1865.

Major-General POPE:

General Connor reports that 500 Indians attacked three crossings on Sweetwater and tore down telegraph wire. He says the Indians are coming down from the north in large bodies, and threaten the line all the way to Saint Lake, and that he will need considerable more cavalry. I think we better get a few regiments at Fort Leavenworth, besides those here. If I have to throw in more troops on the South Pass line it will take some three regiments more.

G. M. DODGE,

Major-General.

General DODGE:

Have nothing to do with quarrels about civil officers in this State. The military have nothing to do with it.

JOHN POPE,

Major-General.
