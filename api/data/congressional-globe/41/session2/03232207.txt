"Railroads also connect with most of the import-
ant soa-ports, and these roads are being extended
and new ones constructed, so that soon, by means of
the rail and the rivers, nearly all portions of these
countries will be easily accessible tor commercial and
passenger traffic.
"This soa and tributaries, and rivers emptying
into them, are navigated by hundredsof sailing ves-
sels, and by over 300 steamships and steam vessels
of various tonnage, but all engaged in commerce
and traffic. Well organized and powerful lines of
steamships run from the ports of Italy and of south-
ern France, Spain, and Portugal, to the ports of
Braail and the La Platte, England, and Scotland, by
which alarge andprofitable freight and business are
ti affie are carried on." *
It seems to be conceded that the price of
wheat abroad determines the price of all the
wheat in this country. Butwhat determines the
price of the wheat in foreign countries? De-
mand for food is constant, and its intensity
depends upon the supply. American wheat in
part feeds the manufacturers of England and
France. It must compete with the wheatraised
there and in other European or Asiatic coun-
tries and submit to receive the price at which
continental wheat-growers can afford or are
willing to sell. The American wheat-grower
must, compete with the cheap labor of European
countries. He must accept the price at which
the cheap labor and cheaper transportation can
furnish food to the consumer. So long as there
is a surplus for export it is conceded that this
would be the ease. It is impossible to consume
in this country the whole of our present agri-
cultural produce. Our yearly surplus of wheat
would furnish nearly 6,000,000 people with
bread, and our other exports of provisions
would supply them with meats and other food.
There seems to be no practical method of
preventingour farmers from raising a surplus.
The argument seems to be that by imposing
duties which discriminate most heavily against
their industry, increasing the cost of raising
wheat and the profits of manufacturing, some
of the farmers will be forced to engage in
manufacturing.
While the farmer, struggling to maintain a
livelihood, pressed on the one side by the low
price of farm products and the excessive cost
of what he must buy, is preparing his fields
for another unremunerativc crop, the manufac-
turer is asking us to increase the burdens upon
agricultural production. The manufacturer,
more fortunate, if engaged in unprofitable un-
dertakings, if his furnace is too far from coal
or lacks cheap transportation to the ore or
to the markets for the finished product, can
change his investment of capital and remove
his machinery to other localities whero natu-
ral advantages and ability to purchase cheap
material enable him to work to better advan-
tage and more profit. But the farmer cannot
remove his capital; it is fixed. His home is by
his fields. He cannot abandon his possessions
and transfer his industry to other enterprises.
The advocates of prohibitory duties or high
protective duties have conceded that the pres-
ent prices are not remunerative.
The following statement is based on a yield
of 20 bushels per acre, but the actual average
yield of the northwestern States is 13 bushels ;
so that the actual cost would be nearly of
U0J=$1 38 as the average cost of producing
winter wheat in the northwestern States:

Considering the straw and pasture worth the wear
and tear of tools, harness, &c., the above I consider
a fair estimate of tho cost of one bushel of wheat.
Desiring to know why currency was so scarce
at the West, and was so rapidly being drawn
to the East at the present time, I desired a
friend in my district to estimate carefully the
cost per acre to the farmers of the Northwest
incurred in raising the principal crops of that
region. The data of yield per acre and cost
of labor are taken from statistics for the State
of Illinois for 1868, by the Commissioner of
Agriculture. The following is the table:

Tho deterioration of soil may bo considered charged in the rental, or if not the loss would be greater.
It shows a loss per acre of $-1 67 on wheat.
The acreage of wheat in Illinois for 18U8 was
returned at 2,488,-178. Tho yield is reported to
have been less per acre; but if the acreage is
the same, the loss on wheat to the farmers of
that State for the last year, if marketed at pres-
ent prices, is $11,.598,000—a sum equal to the
entire national banking capital of the State ;
on corn about $13,000,000, and on oats about
$ 1,000,000, making a total loss of $18,000,000
in that State in a single year. There were
10,000,000 aeres of wheat raised in 1868 in
the northwestern States, and the average yield
was about. 2 bushels more per acre than in
Illinois. This would reducc the loss to ,$;> 50
per acre, and make the loss $35,000,000 on
wheat in those States at present cost and prices.
Can the manufacturers of salt, iron, and
woolens show a depression in their business
equal to this? Tho farmer asks that in the
revision of the tariff the duty upon articles
heavily taxed, of which he is the chief con-
sumer, shall bo lessened. If you permit him
to reduce the cost of production, tho competi-
tion with the cheapagricultural labor of foreign
countries and consequent low prices will not
utterly destroy tho agricultural interests here.
His implements are more expensive; 10 cents
in gold are added to the pricc of his horseshoes.
The salt to feed his stock or cure his provisions
is doubled in pricc. The stove on which his
meals are cooked has from $1 to $2 added
to its price for tho duty on tho pig-iron it coti-
"tains. He is the greatest of all consumers of
wrought iron and steel, upon which the duty is
proposed to be raised. The cost of the grades
of steel which enter largely into the manufac-
ture ofplows, reapers, mowers, averages nearly
8.5 cents per pound. The present duty is an
average of about 2.} cents per pound, making
the duty over 80 per cent, on first cost. The
tariff bill reported by the committee proposes
to raise this duty to an average duty of 3} cents
per pound. This would increase the cost of
plows, wagons, tools, and farm implements to
a corresponding degree.
The advocates of a high tariff claim that
they do it in the interest and for the protec-
tion of American labor against, as they say,
the pauper labor of Europe; but the claim is
erroneous, as far at least as the labor of farm-
ers is concerned. The labor of one part of
the world must compete with the labor of other
parts of the world so long as there is any inter-
change of products. Prohibitory laws may pre-
vent competition from foreign labor in regard
to particular employments or industries, but so
long as there is an exportable product whose
growth or manufacture is common to all coun-
tries, and whose price is regulated in part by
the amount of labor bestowed to bring it to the
consumer, so long must there be competition
with foreign labor, and this competition will
in time extend to all industries. The relative
rewards of labor between the mechanic or other
artisan abroad will determine to some degree
the number employed in that occupation. The
more profitable it is the more persons will en-
gage in it, until the rewards of laborare lowered
and equalized.
The United States produce an excess of food
above their own wants. They export to coun-
tries producing less an amount yearly exceed-
ing an export valuation ofg75,000,000. In 1868
they exported 20,000,000 bushels of wheat, and
the yearly shipment of wheat and flour alone
for the last thirteen years has ranged from
15,000,000 to 60,000,000 bushels. The average
cost at which all the grain-producing nations
from year to year can produce and afford to
sell their wheat will determine the average
price.
If one nation by increased economic methods,
better harvests, or cheaper methods of trans-
portation or cheap labor can lessen the cost
of production the price will ultimately fall, for
increased profit will stimulate production and
competition will reduce the price. If labor is
cneaper abroad it will diminish the cost of rais-
ing wheat or other grain, as well as producing
iron, lhe agriculturist here must compete with
that cheap labor in the raising of his products,
lhe great and primal demand is food. The
producers of food, outnumbering all other occu -
pations, extend to all parts of the habitable
globe, and the consumers embrace the whole
population living upon the earth. Wherever
there is a mouth to be fed there is a demand
or the products of the farm. Every food-pro-
ducing country, in the nature of things, most
compete with every other food-producing coun-
try m supplying this demand. The least price
at which the people of any nation can and are
willing to deliver it where there is the greatest
demand will be the ruling price through the
world; ana the average price at any other
place will be measured by the total cost of
labor, risk, and profit in transporting the eorn-
i t!le P^ace of supply to the place
