MAY 6--6.30 a. m.

Captain ALDEN:

Cannot say when the Hartford will return, but not until to pass below Port Hudson.

FARRAGUT.

Sent. "Porter has captured Grand Gulf. Took nine big guns. Grant is behind Grand Gulf with 30,000 men. Has captured 500 prisoners and one battery. Hopes to bag all."

Received. "Very windy. Be brief."

Sent. "We are off. Cease signaling."

Received. "Cease signaling."

On the 8th of May, Admiral Farragut and staff went to New Orleans by way of the Atchafalaya. I accompanied him. Reported for duty again to General Banks at his headquarters at Bayou Sara about midnight, May 23, 1863. Immediately ordered to the Hartford.

U. S. S. HARTFORD,

New Port Hudson, May 24--10.30 a. m.

Admiral FARRAGUT:

I have nothing from General Banks since yesterday morning, when he had joined Augur at Newport.

PALMER,

Commodore.

We are in communication with him, and they now invest Port Hudson. Wait for a reply from the admiral. Do not send a message till I answer your call.

JACKSON.

Sent. "I am Eaton. Was signaling to Hall at Bayou Sara. He can see you. Can't you see him? Look a little to the left of me. Where is the admiral?"

U. S. S. MONONGAHELA.

Commodore PALMER:

Hold on and watch events, and be ready to take advantage of them.

D. G. FARRAGUT.

Admiral FARRAGUT:

I have now in the Mississippi the Albatross, Arizona, and Sachem, the two latter at Bayou Sara. I have the Estrella on the Atchafalaya. The Pittsburgh I sent yesterday to report to Captain Walker, to assist in blockade of Red River. General Grant has been everywhere successful. We hope Vicksburg by this time has fallen. I have received about 120 tons of coal for all of us. Hope to get 100 more from the army. I have sent over an officer with a communication for you.

J. S. PALMER,

Commodore.

Commodore PALMER:

To fire from above on the batteries would injure our troops more than the enemy, perhaps.

ALDEN,

Captain.

Received. "I cannot see to read, but will send you a message. General Banks' troops are on the Point. Augur is a mile from the forts, and the rest near."

Sent. "Cease signaling."

(In communication with Bayou Sara station.)

MAY 25--7.30 a. m.

Sent. "Where is General Weitzel?"

Received. "He has just passed here."

Sent. "How long since?"

Received. "About two hours ago. Weitzel's brigade is here. He passed to the front himself with one aide at 6 this morning."

Sent. "Who are you?"

Received. "Dana. 'Tis very smoky; use large flag. I leave son with Weitzel's brigade. Hall remains here."

Sent. "Would I were with thee! The guns of the army seem to be shelling Port Hudson."

Received. "Too hard on eyes. Cease signaling."

Sent. "Cease signaling."
