MACON, GA., November 24, 1864.

General J. B. HOOD:

Sherman's movement is progressing rapidly toward Atlantic coast, doubtless to re-enforce Grant. It is essential you should take offensive and crush enemy's force in Middle Tennessee soon as practicable, to relieve Lee.

G. T. BEAUREGARD.

General.
HEADQUARTERS FORREST'S CAVALRY,Mount Pleasant, November 24, 1864 - 11 a. m.

Brigadier General W. H. JACKSON:

GENERAL: The major-general directs me to say he is informed the enemy are all leaving Pulaski, and that you will leave one brigade on the Lawrenceburg road to protect his flank, and move with the balance of your command on the railroad between Pulaski and Columbia, and endeavor to cut off their retreat. If they have evacuated Pulaski you will move forward and press them hard on to Columbia. General Chalmers' division is now fighting the enemy within four miles of Columbia. You will communicate with the major-general at this place.

Respectfully,

J. P. STRANGE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

P. S. - General Buford has the same instructions as the above, with the exception of sending a brigade on the Lawrenceburg road; and the major-general directs that if you think a brigade is a greater number than necessary, you will send only a sufficiency to protect his right flank.

J. P. S.

NOVEMBER 24, 1864.

[General JACKSON:]

General Buford says that the prisoners had better be ordered to Mount Pleasant.

Yours, respectfully,

J. P. STRANGE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

P. S. - The major-general directs me to say that two corps have certainly passed from Pulaski on to Columbia, and you will press them hard. General Buford has been ordered to do the same.

[General JACKSON:]

GENERAL: The movement we agreed on this evening just before I left you covers the case. I do not think that there is any necessity for a force to be sent on the Lawrenceburg road now. Do not move in the morning without seeing me.

Yours,

A. BUFORD,

Brigadier-General.
