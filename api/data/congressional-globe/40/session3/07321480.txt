THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
February 2$,
Mr. POMEROY. I desire to present a_m_e-
taorial, with ari accompanying bill, if it is in
order at this time. The memorial is from the
Agricultural and Mechanical Association of
Leavenworth county, in the State of Kansas,
respectfully memorializing Congress that they
may have a right to purchase a portion of the
Fort Leavenworth military reservation. They
do not* ask for any gift or donation, but that,
upon a price to be determined by trhe Secretary
of War, they may have a right to purchase a
portion of the, reservation ; and to carry out
the prayer of this p.etition I respectfully ask
leave to introduce a joint resolution.
By unanimous consent, leave was granted to
introducea jointresolution (S. No. 234)author-
izing the sale of a portion of the Port Leav-
enworth military reservation to the Kansas
Agricultural. and Mechanical Association of
Leavenworth; which was read twice by its title.
Mr. POMEROY. I move that the joint
resolution be printed, and, together with the
memorial, referred to the Committee cm Military
Affairs.
The motion was agreed to.
Mr. POMEROY. I have a memoriarfrom
a large number of citizens of Georgetown, Dis-
trict of Columbia, in which'they set forth that
at the time a charter was given to the Oak Hill
Cemetery in this District it was provided in the
charter that no: person not owning three hun-
dred feet square in that cemetery should have
the right to vote. It has occurred latterly that
those lots are Very much divided, and persons
now desire to participate in the government of
that corporation and the management of the
cemetery who are not allowed to do so because
they do not each of them own three hundred
feet square of the ground. I have examined
the memorial and desire to present it, and ask
to have it referred to .the Committee on the
District of Columbia, together with the accom-
panying bill, which I ask may be printed and
referred to the same committee.
By unanimous consent, leave was granted to
introduce a bill (S. No. 960) to equalize and
define the rights of all persons who own lota in
the Oak Hill Cemetery, District of Columbia ;
which was read twice by its title, referred with
the memorial to the Committee on the District
of Columbia, and ordered to be printed.
Air. MORRILL, of Vermont, presented two
petitions ot citizens of Vermont, praying for
puch an amendment to the Constitution of the
United States as will fully recognize the obli-
gations of the Christian religion; which was
referred to the Committee on the Judiciary.
Mr. CONKLING presented a memorial of
merchants of New York, remonstrating against
the passage of the bill for the relief of Polly
Hunt, which involves the revival of an expired
patent for paper collars: which was referred
to the Committee on Patents.
Mr. BUCKALEW presented l-esolntions of
the Philadelphia Board of Trade, approving of
the passage of the bill to prohibit secret sales
of gold or bonds on account of the United
States; which was referred to the Committee
on Finance.
Mr. SAWYER presented the petition of the
Board of Trade of Charleston, South Caro-
lina, prayinj* for such ;jn amendment to the
act of March 28, 1854, as to allow the western

any port of entry on the Atlantic or Gulf coasts
and transport them in bond to the place of
destination; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on Commerce.
KEPOKTS OF COMMITTEES.
Mr. ^ SHERMAN. I am directed by the
Commit tee on Finance to report back a num-
ber of House bills and joint resolutions, most
of them rcmittingcluties on statuary, bells, and
various other articles imported for colleges,
&c. The Committee on Finance direct me to
report back the bill (H. R. No. 327) author-
izing the Secretary of the Treasury to remit
the duty on certain meridian circles, being one
of this series, with an amendment in the nature
of a substitute containing a general provision
remitting duties on philosophical apparatus
and other apparatus imported'by colleges and
public libraries, with a view to dispose of all
applications "of this kind. I wish to say that
this amendment simply revives the tariff act
of 1861, including only philosophical apparatus,
and at an early day, as soon as I can get the
floor, I shall call it up with a view to its pas-
sage. There are quite numerous applications
on the subject. We propose to make a private
bill a general bill to cover all that class of
cases.
â€¢ The Committee on Finance were discharged
from the further consideration of the joint res-
olution (H. R. No. 339) authorizing the remis-
sion of the duties on a chime of bells imported
for presentation to the Episcopal church at
Hoosic, Rensselaer county, New York, and the
bill (S. No. 616) to remit the duties on a cer-
tain statue intended to surmount the soldiers'

Mr. SUMNER. I am directed by the Com-
mittee on Foreign Relations to report back to
the Senate a copy of eight rules agreed upon
between the Chinese imperial Government and
the ministers of the United States and of other

which have been transmitted by the President
to Congress in pursuance of the requirements
of the sixth section of the act of Juno 22,1860,
with a view to the approbation of Congress, if
there is any occasion for the expression of such
approbation. On examining these rules the
committee have come to the conclusion that
there is no action of Congress necessary on the
subject, and 1 am directed to report them back
and to ash to be discharged from the further
consideration thereof.
The report was agreed to.
Mr. SUMNER. The same committee, to
