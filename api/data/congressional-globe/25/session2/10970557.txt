Annexation of Texm—Mr. Pfestón.
Senate.
entertained and urged by the two last Administrations; andj
although not adopted by the present, as an Administration mea
sure, is known to have been favorably entertained by the Presi
dent, and at least one distinguished member of the Cabinet It
is strange that a measure which has been urged for twelve years
past should now, for the fiist time, be met by a tem«totur o*}
position, and it is very strange that he sJiuaK[ be found lidmg
uponanddirectingthestoim, rfno Was the very first manto
propose the annexation of Texas, as one of the very earliest
measures of his Administration, after he was made President
Yes, Mr President, Mr John Qmncy Adams had hardly as
cended the Presidential chaii befóte he assiduously addressed
himself to the task of repairing the mjuiy inflicted upon the
country by the treaty of 181**, m the making of which it has
been since understood he was the reluctant agent As Secre
tary of State, in 1819, he negotiated the tieaty of transfer, as
President of the United States, in 1821, he instituted a negoirn
tion for the reannexatien Through his Secretary of State,
Mr Clay, (whote name heretofore has been always connected
with op position to the cession, and with advocacy Of reannexa
tion of Texas, and whom I should be glad, to find standing on
the same ground now that he occupied from 1819 to 1829,) the
President instructed Mr Poinsett, then minister to Mexico, to
opeaatonceand vigorously uige a negotiation for thereacquisi
«ton of Texas, and the le establishment of the southwest line of
the United States at the Rio Grande delNoite The Secietary
urged it upon the envoy, as a matter ol the deepest interest to the
country, and the higher polioj of the Government The
advantages ate elaborately and zealously set forth, and al
though the countiy at that time labored under a large debt,
the envoy was authorized to oFer five millions lor the acquisi
«on It is gieatiy to be lamented that the joint effoitsol Mr
Adams, Mr Clay, and Mr Poinsett, failed upon this occasion,
aa the ¿joint efforts of General Jackson, Mi Van Buren, and Mr
Poinsett, did upon a subsequent occasion, when the ptoposiuon
Was renewed, orrather continued, underanewAdmmistiation
From the beginning to the end of his Administration, Mr
Adams kept steadily in view this important measure, and when
his successor came m, ask was supposed, with opinions differ
lag on all points, and with pi orm&es and pledges of all soi ts oí
changes^ amidst the general bouleoei sement of all that had been
áone or attempted, this measure alone was held sacred, it was
adopted as it stood upon the record, and urged with the charac
terisüc en i gy of the man who felt, and truly felt, that he was
not so much the functional y of a Constitutional Government,
as the representative of the Democracy oí this country, as Na
poleon had been of that of Trance Jackson, Van Buren, and
Poinsett, took the place ot Adams, Clay, and Poinsett, but push-
ed on the negotiation Howoi why it failed, it were useless now
to inquire Whethei it was loot oight of amongst the vulgar and
paltry eontroveisies of Scotmos and Yorkinos, or postponed by
the massacies and plundering of the succado, oí suspended by
the ceaseless revolutions of that fated country, is now of no con
sequence. This is certain, that President Jacírson never lost
eight of it, and that he continued to look to its -accomplishment
as one of the greatest events of his Administration, to the mo
ment when the title of Mexico was extinguished forever by the
battle of ban Jacmto
And the object, sir, was well wort y of the solicitude of a pa
mot statesman, for the country lost to us by the fatal treaty of
1819 is one of the finest upon the whole earth Its beautiful
prairies expand beneath as genial a climate as evei blessed the
milder latitudes of the temperate zone, and, rising with a gen
tie slope irom the Gulf towaids the north, present the appear
anee of a vast lawn, mteispersed with streams and woodland
No heavy foiests em umber its sutface and present obstacles
to its settlement, no bairen wastes of sand disfigure it, no
marshy swamps mai its atmosphere with unhealthy exhala
tions Under a sun which ripens the ougar cane and coffee, the
suiface isas green as New England, and it is as exempt from
disease as any portion ol the valley of the Mississippi It is m
tersectedat short distances by large rivers, which form bays
and estuaries along the Gulf coast, eminently fitted for com
merce Under the quickening influences of oui policy and
our people, this fine tract of countiy, doomed to be an eternal
wasteif possessed by the Mexicans or Camanchcs, will spang
into a glorious and vigorous existence Its fields will teem with
the richest productions of the earth, its livers will beat down
to what should always be considered in the policy of this bo
vernmentas out sea (mare nostrum) an unbounded produce,
to enhance the navigation ot the Northern States, while an in
cieasing population augments the demand for their manufac
tures
But the boundary line established by the treatv of 1819 not
only deprives us of this extensive and fertile territory, but
winds with "adeep indent" upon the valley of the Mississippi
itself, umning upon the Red river and the Aikansas It places
a foi eurn nation m the reat of our Mississippi settlements, and
brings ft within a stone's throw of that great outlet which dis
charges the commerce of half the Union The mouth of the
Sabine and the mouih of the Mississippi are of a dangerous vi
cimty The great object of the purchase of Louisiana was to
remove all possible interference of foreign States in the vast
commeice of the outlet of so many States By the cession of
Texas, this policy was, to a certain extent, compiomised
On this subject, Mr Van Bui en, m his instructions to Mr
Poinsett, holds the following language
^The line proposed as the one most desuable to us would
constitute a most natural separatio i ol the resource  of the tw o
nations It is fhe centre of a country uninhabitable on the Gulf,
and on the mountains, so difficult of access, and so poii as to
furnish no inducements foi a land intercourse, and, of couise,
no thea're for those difference*, that are almest inseparable from
a neighboi hood of commercial inteiests It corresponds with
the habitual feelings of the people of Mexico, and with the
avowed policy of the Mexican Government by causing a wide
separation and difficulties of intercourse between the mhabi
tants of the two countries, by preventing those excitements
and bickerings mvauably produced by the contiguous operation
of conflicting laws, habits, and interests The commeicial es
tabhshment which would be forthwith made at the Neures,
and in its vicinity, would enable us topieserve, wasieatde
gree, the moialsof the inhabitant  of both sides, by the pre
vention of smuggling, and the Mexican Government, by thus
respecting the real intetesis of the United States, without auual
prejudice to its own, would affoid the strongest eviltnceof
that spint Oi ftiendahip by which ihe United States have al
ways been influenced towards >t, and which should ever cha
rwtense the conduct of neighboring Republics '

report ^ tt committee of the House of Representatives of
Massachusetts, now m session  I appioach with due deferir ce,
sir, whatever comes from the funcuonanes of that great Com
monweaitfi, (for, although i think hei opinions and,policy have
not been exempt fiom serious, mistakes an-4 errois, still, from
the time of her Hancocks and Adamses, she has piosecuted her
purposes with a firmness and intelligence certainly not sur
passed by any State in the Union )   She has at all times been
fertile in great men    She has alwajs had the consideration
abroad, and that self cofideuce, (a mam source of stiength,)
that result irom a glorious past, and these advantages, com
bmed with her superior magnitude and wealth, have constituí
ed her the head and leader of New England    What she says
and does is therefore entitled to the greatest consideration, and
this is the more especially demanded at my hands by the tern
perate and courteous maunei in which the committee has done
me the honor to treat me and the resolution which is now the
subject of our deliberations
The icport says
1 The committee do not believe that any power exists m any
bianch oi this Government, or in all of them united, to consent
to such a union, (viz with the sovtretgn state of Texas,) noi,
indeed, does such authonty pertain, asan incident of sove
reignty, oi otherwise, to the Government, however absolute, of
any nation "
Both these piopositions I controvert, and, first, as to thepow
ers of this Government
Ihe committee, it appears to me, has been led to erroneous
conclusions on this subject by a fundamental mistake as to the
nature and chatacter of our Government a mistake which has
peivaded and perverted all its reasoning, and has foi a long
time been the abundant source of much practical mischief in
the action of this Government, and of verydaugeious specula
tion The mistake lies in considering this, as to its nature and
poweis, a consolidated Government of one people, instead df 4
confedeiated Government of many States There is no one
single act performed by the people of the United States, under
the Constitution, as one people Even in the popular branch
of Congiesb thio disti \ tion is maintained A certain numbei
ol delegates is assigned to each State, and the people of each
Sta e elect foi their own State When the functionaues of the
Government assembk here, they have no couice of power but
the Constitution, w*m i presci ibes, defines, and limits their ac
tion, and constitutes them, mt leir aggregate capacity, a trust
or agency, lor the ptrfoimanee of certain duties confided to
them Ly various States or communities This Government
i", therefore, a confedeiacy of so-reieum States, as ouaung
themselves togethei for mutual advantages They ongmally
came togethei as ¡sovereign States, having no authority and pie
tending to no power of iecipiocal control North Carolina
a d Rhode Island stood off for a time, refusing to join the Con
federacy, and at length came into n by the exeicise of a sove
reign d scretion So too of Missouri, who wa? a State ful y or
gamzed and perfect, and self governed, beiore she was a State
of this Union, and, m the very nature of things, this lias been
the case with all the States heretofore admitted, and must al
ways continue to beso Where, then, is the difficuliy of ad
nutting another State into this Confederacy? The powertoad
mit new States is expressly given "New States may bettdmit
ted by the Congress into this Union " By the very terms of the
grant, they must be States before they are admitted, when ad-
mitted, they become States of the Union The term'!, restric-
tions, and principles upon which new States are to be recm ed,
aie matteis to be i emulated by Congress, under the Constitution
The puwer conferred by the Constitution upon Congress is
not to cieate, but to admit, new States The States create
themselves, Missouri and Michigan did so and exercised all
the 1 unctions of self government, while Congress deliberated
whether they should be admitted In the mean time, the terri-
torial oigamyation was abrogated, and the laws of Congress
superseded, and if Congiess declined to admit them, they, of
necessity remained foreign and independent States
Heretorore, in the acquisition ol Louisiana and Florida,
France and Spain both stipulated that the inhabitants of the
ceded Territories should be incorporated in the Union of the
United States as soon as may be consistent with the principles
of the Federal Constitution, and admitted to all the privileges,
rights, and immunities of the citizens of the United States In
compila ice with th'bstipulation, Louisiana, Arkansas, and Mis
Eouii have been admitted into the Union, and at no distant day
Florida will be Now if we contrpctwith France and Spam
for the admission of Spates, why shall we not with Texas? If
Fiance can sell to us hei subjects and her territory, why can
not the People of Texas give themselves and their terruoiy to
us^ Is it more consistent with our republican notions that men
and temtory can be transferred by the arbitrary will of a mon
arch, for a price, thin that a free people may be associated
with us by mutual consentí Can we buy, or, accoidmg to the
leport of the Massachusetts committee, conquer, and yet not
enter into an amicable agreement to effect the same object, in
pursuance of the ascertained will of all paities concerned?
There is some display of learning m the íeport to show that
conque&t can effect what consent cannot Not so War itself
is but a mode of argument—ultima ratio, conquest n an en
fotced consent It does not terminate in actual physical
restraint, permanently ipplied, but in the assent of the conquei
ed party that submission is preferable to further resistance A
State or a people mcorpoiated with anothei by such means has
come to the conclusion that union is better than the calamities
of war Why cannot the same State come to the conclusion
that union is better than other calamities to which it is exposed
oi of itself promises benefits giealci than tho=e resulting irom
a s-epaiate existence"*
It is supposed that theie is a sort of political Impossibility,
resulting from the nature of things, to effect the proposed union?
The committee sa> - that "the measuie is m fact the union of
two independen Governments J Cei tamly the union of twen
ty seven "independent Governments," but the committee adds,
that it -hould lathei be teimed the dissolution of both and the
foimation of a new one, which, whether founded on the same
oi anothpr wnften Constitution, is, as to its identi¡y, different
from eithei   This can only be effected by the summum ¡us, ¿u,
A full answei to this objection, even if many o'herb weie not
at hand, as tar as Texas is concerned, is contained m the fact
that the summum jus has been exercised
Her citizens, by a unanimous vo'e, hive deckled in favoi of
* annexation   find, leoordmg to he admission M* the committee
thn is sufficiently potent to drool ve then Government, and to
surrender themselves to be absorbed by ours To. receive t$B
augmentation of our territory and population, manifestly-dees
not dissolve this Government, ot even-remodel it Its identity
is not disturbed. There is no appeal necessary to the swnm&fra
luspopuh for such a political arrangemefit on-our pact, «m
If the summum jus populi could be predicated of this Govern-
ment, which it cannot Now, it is Very obvious that-twofree
States may associate for common purposes, and that these cona*
mon puiposes may be multiplied in number or increased is im-
portance at the discretion of the parties They may establish
a common agency foi the transaction ot their business} and
this may incjude a portion, or all of their political functions.
The new creation may be, an agency if ciested by Siate% or a
Guv eminent if created by the people for the people have a
right to abolish and ci eate Governments Does any one doubt
whether Texas could rejoin the Republic of Mexico? Why
not, then, rejoin this Republic?
No one doubts that the State* now composing this Union
might have joined Great Britain after the declaration of indepen-
dence The learned committee would not contend that thetfi
was a political impossibility in the Union of Scotlarid and Ertg
land, tít of Ireland and Britain, or that, m the nature of things,
it would be impossible for Louisiana, if she were a sovereign
State out of this Union, to join with the sovereign State of Texas
m foiminga new Government
There is no point of view in which the pioposition foi annek
ation can be considered, that any seiious obstacle m point bf
form pie&ents itself If this Government be a confederation bf
Statesjihen it is pioposed to add another State to the Confede
racy if this Government bea consolidation, then His proposed to
add to it additional temtory and population That we can annex,
and afterwards admit, the cases of Florida and Lousianá prove
We can, therefore deal wi'h the people of Texas for the Tern
tory o 1 Texas and the peoplecan be seemed in the fights and
privileges of the Constitution, as Were the subjects of Spain and
France
So much for the formal difficulties I now approach those
which have exercised a more decisive influence over that por-
tion of the Union which is offering a determined opposition to
tms measure
Ihe Massachusetts commi tee experience much difficulty in
ascertaining the mode of action by which the proposed atmexá
lion can be effected, and demand "in what form Would foe the
practical e?erci&e of the supposed power? In what department
does it lie?" The progress of events already, m a great mea-
sure, answers this objection Texas has taken the initiative
JJpr mim«tei has mtioduced the subject to that Department
which is alone capable of receiving communications from fo
reign Governments, and the Executive has submit ed the cor
resr ondence to Concress The resolutions before you propose
an expie^sion of opinion by Congress, which, if made, the Exe-
cutive wuldoubtless address iteelfearnestly, m conjunction with
the authorities of Texas, to the consummation of the joint
wiohebof the parties, which can be accomplished by treaty,
emanating from one depaitment of this Governmen^to be ear-
ned into eftect by the passage of all nepdiul laws by the legisla
Uve department, and try the exercise of the express powei of
Congiess to adn it new S'ates
I am aware, Mi Presi lent, of the full extent and of the de
cided charactei of the opposition which this measure encoun
ters in a laige section of the Union A vast number of i emon-
s'rances, memorials, and petition", with countless signatures,
have been presented, characterized m almost every instance by
a very excited temper Several of the most respectable States,
too have solemnly adjured Congiess to decline my proposed
measure Vermont led the way, m a violent and denunciatory
papei The populous State of Ohio followed m such determin
ed hostility that her Legislature has volunteered a denial of
the constitutionality of that acquisition which affords the outlet
to her commerce The gravity and diguity of Massachusetts
have been enlisted to the same end, and, in short, all the North-
em and Middle States, in one form or other, have urged ob
jections upon us If the views of so large and respectable a
poition oí the country be determined by broad reasons of gene
ral policy, conceived m a ipint of patriotism, and embracing
the various interests of the whole Union in a just and equal
consideration, they would come lecommende*! to us by a very
weighty authority, but, on the other hand, if this joint move 
ment be a combination, conceived m a spirit of hostility to
wards one section, and for the purpose of aggrandizing the po-
litical power of anothei, then both the purpose and temper m
which it is conceived con&titute an irresistible reason, on the
part of all who value this Union, for urging and consummating
this measuie
Stripped of all circumlocution, the proposition is this We
are hostile to the institutions of the South, and propose then
destruction, we have a predominating power, daily increasing,
over that section, and we do not intend that it shall put itself m
a condition to i esist our power, when we may choose to exercise
it I put it tc every candid man, whether this is not the just
mterpie'ation, the sum and substance, of the proceedings m
Massachusetts and Ohio, and of all those numerous petitions
which have been presented from the non slaveholdmg States
I do not now speak of that wild and blind fanaticism, or still
blinder cant, which infects the public mind on this subject, and
which even m this country has (I say it with shame and sorrow)
received an impulse from that impersonation of the blackguard
ism of Europe, Mr O'Connell, but I speak of the grave lan-
guage of distinguished men, and the dignified proceedings of
legislative bodies, and when the South finds m these a question
of political power íaised against her, coupled with, or rather
founded upon an objection to hei social institutions, she ought,
she must, make up her mind to give up those institutions, or to
demand a guatanty for them The question of her existence
is forced upon hei, and if you will not consent to adopt some
measure to protect hei, (and I confess that I see nothing but
what I now propose,) it will be her duty by hei own action to
provide foi her own safety
It cannot ^aiJ to make a oeep and mournful impression upon
the South, that the opposition to the proposed measuie is con-
temporaneous wi'h the lecent excitement on the subject of
abolition All men, of all paities, from all sections, in and out
of office, Mi Vlam* most conspicuous amongst them, desired
the acquisition of Texas until the clamorous mteiference in the
affairs of the South was caught up in New England, fiom Old
England Then for the first time objections are made to this
measure, the  those very statesmen who were anxious to
make the acquisition of Texas their glory, found out that 4
would subvert the Constitution and rum the country Ws 01
