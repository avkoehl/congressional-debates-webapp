CHAMBERSBURG, PA., July 11, 1863. (Received 11. 40 p. m.)

Major-General MEADE,

Army of the Potomac:

My latest information is that the enemy have evacuated Hagerstown. This was 8 o'clock this morning. Part of Ewell's corps fell back, it is supposed, toward Clear Spring. A few cavalry were on the road to Funkstown. I have no information that is positive of the enemy having taken the direction of Clear Spring, across the Conococheague.

D. N. COUCH,

Major-General.

HARRISBURG, July 11, 1863-8 p. m.

General WARREN,

Army of the Potomac:

Cavalry reports that the enemy are apparently falling back near Hagerstown. They, however, send out foraging parties composed of the three arms of the service. If possible, I will get off Dana' division, two brigades, this evening, to march toward Waynesborough.

D. N. COUCH,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE SUSQUEHANNA,Chambersburg, July 11, 1863.

[General WILLIAM F. SMITH:]

DEAR GENERAL: Your dispatch received, and I think that I will move down under Dana, and probably go along with, what troops we can move. Unless Meade desires us to join him, nothing could be better than do as you suggest; and, in my opinion, we can help more by remaining in an attitude to fall upon the enemy at the proper moment than doing anything else.

I dread the effect on the Army of the Potomac, if our men should conclude not to fight in Maryland or break on the field; I think, however, that a good many of the Pennsylvania troops would do well. Potter went through to Meade last night with certain propositions, and I hope to hear shortly. It appears that your movement through by Pine Grove was the very best thing you could have done. If you hear anything, please keep me advised. The shoes have gone forward. Truly,

D. N. COUCH,

Major-General.

CHAMBERSBURG, July 11, 1863-9. 30 p. m.

[General WILLIAM F. SMITH:]

GENERAL: Your dispatch received. It is all right, your moving down. On the receipt of information that Hagerstown was evacuated, I intended moving down as soon as I could get Dana's troops in motion. It will trouble me a good deal to supply the command with provisions. I will try and press teams to-morrow for this use.

D. N. COUCH,

Major-General.
