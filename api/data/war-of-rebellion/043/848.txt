I should acknowledge the valuable services of Lieutenants Thomas J. Leiper and J. Spencer Smith, of my staff. In the absence of Captain J. P. Green, assistant adjutant-general, Lieutenant Leiper served as acting assistant adjutant-general with unvarying ability. The few of our killed were unhappily among our best men. Second Lieutenant Edward J. Harvey, Company K, Twenty-ninth Pennsylvania Volunteers, was a man of fine and elevated character; Lieutenant McKeever, Company A, Twenty-ninth Pennsylvania Volunteers, an ardent patriot and faithful officer; Sergeant-Major [Charles H.] Letford, Twenty-ninth Pennsylvania Volunteers, youth of the fairest promise; Color-Sergt. John E. Greenwood, One hundred and ninth, Sergts. E. F. Allen, One hundred and eleventh, and Anthony E. Thomas, Edward N. Sommerkamp, and Jacob Lower, Twenty-ninth; Corporal [William] Louder, Twenty-ninth, and Privates [John] Sheemer, [Orlando S.] Campbell, [Charles] Miller, [John M.] Richardson, One hundred and eleventh; [Casper H.] Warner. [Thomas] Acton, [Robert] Hews, [Robert] Lockhart, [John] Applegate, [John] Watson, [Emanuel] McLaughlin, [James] Morrow, Twenty-ninth, and [Thomas C.] Ochs and [De Lany S.] Veale, One hundred and ninth, were all patriotic and brave men, whose loss is seriously to be deplored. Young Vealel, often noticed for his singularly handsome and bright countenance, was adjutant`s clerk of his regiment, but insisted on going into action with his rifle.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

THOMAS L. KANE,

Brigadier-General U. S. Volunteers.

Captain THOMAS H. ELLIOTT,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
