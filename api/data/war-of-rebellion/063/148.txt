HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE MISSOURI,Saint Louis, Mo., April 13, 1864.

Admiral D. D. PORTER:

SIR: Personal experience in this department has fully satisfied me of the very great importance of having an able and thoroughly reliable detective at Memphis. With such an officer there, having a clear and full understanding with the provost-marshal-general of this department, I am persuaded that the contraband trade and travel on the river, between here and Memphis, could be broken up and a great public good accomplished. Permit me, therefore, to suggest the propriety of authorizing Lieutenant J. B. Devoe, who is now here, to take up his quarters, for a while at Memphis, and take charge there of the duties indicated.

I am, sir, very respectfully,

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS SAINT LOUIS DISTRICT,Saint Louis, April 13, 1864.

COMMANDING OFFICER,

Pilot Knob:

Has Captain Milks' company yet gone to Saint Genevieve to take station? I telegraphed you several days ago to know whether the three howitzers at Camp Curtis and the company at Centreville might not advantageously be sent to Patterson, but have yet received no answer.

THOMAS EWING, JR.,

Brigadier-General.
