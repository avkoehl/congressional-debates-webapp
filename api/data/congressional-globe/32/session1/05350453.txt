1852.
THE- CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE,
m
Uuie. I will proceed. The coalition in Massa-
chusetts ix two ^pabW., "and the positscm tsf th«
Democratic party too well established, to say more
in reference to them. We all know what is the
position <&f t5ae 33ei«<rcsu&c pmy h. the Stsfe* of
Ohio now, and what it has been for some tiaa«
past. We know the principle upon which the
present Governor ^as reosKthy elected, alqjpeugh
lie has, in his last message, proclaimed sentiments
whifth meet my approbation, so far as they go.
But the Qoveraor of Ohio was elected upon his
declaration that " the fugitive slave law can never
receive the voluntary -cosoperatiow of the people of
the State of Ohio." That was the principle upon
which hz 'effected his election—opposition to the !
fugitive slave law. Now, I allude to this fact be- i
cause a gentleman now occupying the chair, [Mr. i
Olds,] in a recent speech, spoke of the peculiar j
Southernism of the Democracy of Ohio, as shown
in this election and m other instances Again, sir,
the late ©emwmuc Coweatifla ot Ohio passed a
resolution declaring " that slavery is an evil which
ought to be eradicated, and its extension prevented
by all lawfui means." We know that in that
•convention, held in the State of Ohio, this senti-
ment was avowed; and such has been the inroad
of Free-Soilism upon the Democracy of that State
that in a district lately represented by a distin-
guished vnemher from Ohio, [Mr. Root,] a tree
soil Whig, whose •anti-slavery opinions are we$
known, is now represented by a free soil Demo-
crat, though, as 1 am informed, there was a de-
cided "W hig 'Majority m Jthe-dtswitfL The coalition
by which Mr."Chase was elected to the Senate is
a flaatter of history. The fkct is, Mr, Chairman,
the Democrats have fairly outbid die Whigs in
this State, as in Massachusetts: and as T heard an
Ohio Whig complaining, <k the Democrats have
bought up or stolen most of our Whig free sell-
ers." Well, sir, J am glad of it. I rejoice that
the Whigs are getting rid of them, and i hope
the Democracy will make better use o^thetn than
the Whigs did.
Mr. G1DDINGS. I hope the"ge#Ieman will
allow me to correct him. I know he intends to
state his positions correctly. J Jut I wiltsMUfto
him, that in so<me portions of the State to which
he has made allusion, the Democrats have bought
up the Whigs. If he will examine the recent po-
litical history of that Stat e, he will see that in one
portion of the State the whole Whig party were
found voting for a Democrat and the Democratic
ticket, and that ticket was elected. And that dis-
trict, which was formerly a strong Whig district,
is now one of the strongest Democratic districts in
the State. So it seems" that the Democrats have
bought both the Whigs and Democrats,
laughter.]
Mr. CABELL. This only confirms what I
have said. I have not time to allude to coalitions
in other States, with which we are all familial.
Now to return to this Constiluiion.il Union party,
or father, I shook! pjy; the Constitutional Union
Democratic party. 1 ask the gentlemen of that |
party why it is they come forward now and ;-eek j
to force a union with the old Democratic party t \
What is the position of the great mass of the Dem-
ocratic party at the South upon the questions upon
which the Union party was formed ? Then posi-
tion is directly at war with the principles of^ the
Constitutional Union party.. The position of the
"Whig party of the South cannot be mistaken. It
has been clearly defined by their declaration of
sentiments, given here and elsewhere, by the voles
which have been given by those gentlemen on all
occasions upon this floor. They have almost uni-
formly declared for the Union and the compro-
mise. In this connection 1 beg to call the atten-
tion of the committee to a certain paper wiuen
was signed by a. good many membeis nt the
House of Representatives and a few of the Senate,
during the last Congress ot the United Stages.
That paper shows the opinion of the two parties
in relation to those questions upon which the
XJnion party was formed:
The undersigned, member* of riie Tbirty-Qrss Conpe-ss
of the United State*, behoving that a renewal ol sectional
controversy upon the object of alavciy would be both dan-
gerous to the Union and destructive ot its oh,ret, and seeing
no mode by which suchcontroveisy can be avoided, except
by a strict adheience to the settlement theieot effected by
the compromise acts passed la«t session ot Longre^,do
hereby deciaie their intention to maintain the Mime s- ttie
ment inviolate, and to ie«ist all attempts to repeal or alter
the acts aforesaid, unless by the general content ot the
frieii(i <dtf tlie a&e&J&s-eiv to femcly such evils, if any, j
as time and experience may devolop; and foi the purjjoke '
of making Ujjs resolution elective, tiny: further declare that j
they will not support for the office of President, or of Y*ce !
President, or ot {Senator, or of Representatives m Congress, '
or as member of a State Legislature, any man, of whatever ;
party, who is not known to be opposed to the disturbance !
of the settlement aforesaid, and to the renewal in any form x
of agitation upon the subject of slavery

This{paper kj in substance, a pledge to «tavi !
by the principles laid down by the (JonstiuuiowaJ |
Union party, and by the measures known -as the |
Compromise ^neasures. The pledge was cjrcu- 1
lated in the last session, and has appended to it, I i
believe, the name of every Southern Whig in this j
House except the gentleman from North Carolina, j
[Mr. Cuxgwax,] and his colleague, [Mr. Wtan- 1
ly .] But there was not a single Democratic mem- i
ber who was willing to put his name upon that
p«pn r, except the distinguished gentleman now \
Governor of Georgia, and late Speaker of this ,
House; and in the Senate, but four gentlemen
vNtgiw <4 it. !
in this connection, let me say to my Onion >
friends* how different has been the course of th* [
{Southern Whigs upon the subject heretofore, and |
how did'eient is the course which they have hud !
out for themseivc.s foi the future. The Whigs of
Geoigia gave their cordial support to Hon. How- [
ell Cobb, and I rejoice that they did so. We— ;
and L say ice, because I am a member of the j
Southern Whi-j; party, and as such inrerentcd in j
this matter—have pledged ourselves to carry out |
the resolutions of your Union Convention. Yet
you
you will not act with us—you will not vote for
Whig though heHiould puthimsell'upon the ree- ^
cords as a Union man; but you wb-h to carry us !
along, Whig and Deuiociat, into a Democratic 1
convention—composed m part ot tho^e v<ho have |
expressed their opinions upon ibis .subject adverse (
to your own, and who are closely allied to those ,
who ha\e been making war upon our institutions
at the South.
Another re^ou why, it seemed to me, the 1
Union party, if they expressed any preference,
should not have expressed it so decidedly m fa\or
of the Democratic party, is, that in the organiza-
tion of this Hoiu-e at the coinmcmvment ot the
present .scs.sion, the Whig pa;ty met in caucus ,
and po.-'Bfd a resolution by w hn'ii _ tiiey pledged
tlieuiselvev to sustain flie compromi.se nieasiuesof
the last Congress, and by \vh:,-U tisey_ declared
thnt tho.-je ineasuies were tlie lust ivhicji could
ha\e 'neon adopted inid^r the circunumncex. That

Tins, sir, is the very principle on which the
Union paity v."as formed. The Democratic ^cau-
cus refused to adopt any such resolution. Now,_
gentlemen of the Union party, n^the name ot
common sense, and m the name oi tairness and
justice, why is it that you should attempt to con-
nect yourselves with the Democratic party, which
has refused to adopt your resolutions and sustain
your principles, and refuse to unite with those
who have adopted those resolutions, and who have
pledged themselves to act with yoo?
The present Wing President, (Mr. Fillmore,)
in his message, has said:
"The series of measuius to which I have alluded arere-
g&r&?d by me a ^tOe^enVj m principle nad gubstkftce-^
a Snal s^uleineut—of the dangerous and excitmg
which they embraced."
And the Secretary -©f Stat-e>, Mr- Webster^ lm&
also said, in hfs letter to the Union meeting' in
Westchester*
The Presidewfa message, at the opening of the present
"Ofwrnn of Congress, expresses fttlly and plainly Jus crnnt
a«d the unanimous opinion of ail those associated with
l«m in «thc Executive admnnst) atioti of the Government,
in regard lo what a?o ca-lte^ ^>e adjustment or -eempr©«iise
measures of lail session.
Now, sir-, why, under these circumstances, was
it. that the Union party determined to select the
Democratic party with which to act, and lo ask
us Whigs to go alongf with them r
Sir, my opinion i-s, that a "change is now going
I on in the pubhc mind" at the JNorth, among- the
i Whig party, favorable to the South, and I have
| deeply regretted, as a Southern man, to seethe
| disposition manifested by Southern Democrats to
; sneer at every indication of returning sound senti-
I ment among the Whig men of the North. For
| my part, sir, I rejoice, and I have ever rejoiced to
I see any man, Whig or Democrat, at the North,
j coming back to a sound, constitutional view of the
rights of the South, I have expressed by appro-
bation at the views set forth m the last message
of the present Democratic Cfovernor of the State
of Ohio, although they are entirely at variance
with those he expressed before his election. I
expressed my gratification at the election of the
Democratic Governor of Pennsylvania, though it
is known that, as a member of the State Legisla-
ture of that State, he voted for the anti-jail law
of Pennsylvania, He voted for that law depriv-
ing the people of the South of the use of their jails
for the purpose of confining then* fugitive -slaves.
But he has changed his opinion, and I give him
credit for it, I rejoice at his election, th<.fu£h David
Wihnot was run on the ticket with him and elected
a Judge by the Democratic party. And why is
it that we hear gentlemen sneering and attributing
it to the most selfish and unkind motives, when a
gentleman of the Whig party of the North shows
a disposition to depart from that former unsound
position ?
How often have we heard the most unkind and
disparaging allusions made to (he present position
of the Secretary of State and the Governor of New
Yoik, and of other Noithern men who now act
so much in opposition to opinions heretofore en-
tertained and expressed
After the gentleman from Ohio, [Mr. Taylor,]
who I do not now see m his seat, had made the
patriotic speech which he did afevv days ;!.<_ro, upon
this floor, i could not but be ^urpnsni at the feel-
ing of crntitUMtion which seemed io exhibit itself
in the fives of many Southern irentiemen, when
his colleague [Mr. Oi.om lephtd m a tone of in-
vective and sneering, bcau-^e he had had the manli-
ness to vote for the fugitive slave bill.
Mr. M KADE. I openly expressed my gronii-
ention at the stand taken by the utntleman from
Ohio {Mr. Taylcu] at the nmo; and it is obvious
that every Southern mmi must luv, c k-k g:atif-ed
by it. i should like the ornUemmi <o print out a
Southern man who was nut graiilV-il wuh thai po-
sition.
Mr, OA HELL. The iomk.mui m's.md'-.-.stoncs
mo. I *.ud 1 was .-urpii^d at the i;r«airjcalion
wall which the remarks mad<* by the gentlema-i
: from <Mno, [Mr, Oins,] in reply to the maniv and
; patriotic speech of his colleague, [Mr. TAYLOft,!
i wns received. But, inasmuch hm that gentleman is
■ not, now in his seat, I shfdl forbear to make ony
! further allusion to the subject.
Mr. MKADE. That gentleman voted tor the
1 fu£>iti\ e slave law. _
' Mr. CAOELL. That is rruite a mistake. rhe
i ;t-ntleman did not vote lor the ta«u:\e slave^la^v.
F have shown o t-uiVici«nt reason nhy the Union
I party of the South should not go into convention
I with" the Democratic party.
! The paper from which I have re."d, and which
' recommends the sending of de'ega.os to Baltimore,
gives the most conclusive reason whv this should
not be done. I refer to that pan m which the coa-
' lition between the Southern Democrats and the
' Abolitionists is alluded to. Nov, my opinion is
that the Union party has nothing to do with either
of these conventions. 1 think they have no right
to scad delegates to one or the other. Eut I have
shov.-ii a leasnn why, if they send Je)efat^® °
! either of them, there is certainly as much leason
