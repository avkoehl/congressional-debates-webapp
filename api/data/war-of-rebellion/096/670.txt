HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,February 24, 1865-3.05 p. m.

General JOHN A. RAWLINS,

Chief of Staff, City Point:

A deserter from the Fifth Alabama, doing provost guard duty north of South Side Railroad and near the city, states that Early's corps crossed the upper or western bridge on the Appomattox yesterday morning and through the day. After crossing, marched west, along the South Side Railroad. This cannot be either Gordon or Pegram. Our artillery this morning drew a response from the usual batteries on our right. On the left, or rather from the signal tower at Fort Fisher, the signal officers report no apparent change in the position of the enemy's guns or batteries this morning.

JNO. G. PARKE,

Major-General.

One hundred and fourteen deserters have been received to-day, representing every division in our front. They state no troops had moved from their camps, and confirm the previous reports about marching orders, &amp;c., about orders to remove stores to the north of the Appomattox. From those who have come in since dark (thirty-five in number) we learn that there has been no change in the ordinary issue of rations.
