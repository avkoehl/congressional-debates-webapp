dent of his district.
As has been stated by the chairman of the
committee, we have adopted as the rule in all
eases to make the pension dale from the passage
of the act.. Of course we must find the case to
be a meritorious oneor we would not recommend
a pension at all. In this case application was
made to the department for a pension under
existing laws, and the party was not able to
prove that any assistance had actually been
rendered by the son. And although his letters
were of a nature to show that he probably
would have assisted his mother to the extent
of his means if he had lived, he never did
actually afford her any direct, positive aid.
Therefore it has seemed to the committee that
it is right and just that the pension should bo
granted to this party the same as to other par-
ties, so as to take effect from the date of the
act. We see no reason why this should be
singled out to be made an exceptional case.
We must be not only generous, but just Many
have been denied any pensions at all whose
claims may have been quite as meritorious as
those in this instance.
The question was taken on Mr. Donley's
amendment; and there were, on a divisionâ€”
ayes twenty-five, noes not counted.
So the amendment was not agreed to.
The bill was ordered to be engrossed and
read a third time; and being engrossed, it was
accordingly read the third time, and passed.
Mr. BENTON moved to reconsider the vote
by which the bill was passed ; and also moved
that the motion to reconsider be laid on the
table.
The latter motion was agreed to.

Mr. POMEROY. I am charged with the
Eresentation of a memorial from about one
undred citizens in the southern part of the
State of Kansas, headed by Mr. George S.
Weaver, in which they represent that they are
unable to drive cattle from Texas through the
Indian country into the State of Kansas, to put
them on the railroads to be sent to Chicago
and other eastern cities, because of the taxes
levied on them by the Indians. They repre-
sent that onerous, illegal, and extortionate
taxes are levied by the Indian tribes in the
Indian country. The matter has been before
the several Departments. It has been before
the Attorney General, the Secretary of the
Interior, the Commissioner of Indian Affairs,
and now finally they appeal to Congress to
be protected in driving their cattle across the
Indian country from Texas against the taxes
levied by the Indian authorities in violation of
law, as they think. I commend thia subject to
the Committee on Indian Affairs, and I hope
that they will report, and that we shall pass
some resolution bywhich the trade in cattle
through Texas to Kansas shall not be inter-
fered with. I move that this memorial be
referred to the Committee on Indian Affairs.
The motion was agreed to.
