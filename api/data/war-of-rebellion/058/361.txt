LEXINGTON, KY., February 10, 1864.

Brigadier General S. S. FRY,

Point Burnside, Ky.:

You will at once turn over your command to the senior colonel, with instructions to move with the command to Knoxville with all dispatch. You will then at once proceed to Knoxville, Tenn., report in person at headquarters Department of the Ohio, and account for the delay in moving forward with your command.

Please acknowledge by telegram receipt of this.

By command of Major-General Foster:

W. P. ANDERSON,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

KNOXVILLE, TENN.,

February 10, 1864.

Captain W. P. ANDERSON,

Lexington, Ky.:

The cavalry are ordered to Mount Sterling to be remounted and reorganized. It would interfere seriously with this arrangement to detach a regiment from the command at present.

The petition of Governor Bramlette and others to have General Burbridge assigned to the command of the District of Kentucky was returned to General Grant, with the indorsement that General Ammen had already been assigned to that command.

I telegraphed to you on the 3rd of February that General Hobson would assume command of the District of Kentucky during the absence of General Ammen.

EDWARD E. POTTER,

Chief of Staff.

WASHINGTON, February 10, 1864-4 p.m.

Major-General GRANT,

Nashville, Tenn.:

Mr. Beckwith has been restored. Captain Stokes will be made quartermasters with the rank of lieutenant-colonel. Governors of States have authority to furlough troops. Please report any cases that have occurred, and the Secretary of War will so inform the governors who have done so.

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.

MOUNT STERLING, February 10, 1864.

Captain W. P. ANDERSON:

A report is generally current among rebel sympathizers that a mounted force is advancing on this point. Citizens are skedaddling from Owingsville. I do not credit the report, as I have a strong scout under my best captain at Salyersville.

JOHN MASON BROWN,

Colonel Forty-fifth Kentucky, Commanding Post.
