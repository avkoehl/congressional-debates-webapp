Where was the distinción, and why change the
whole Navy pens on system?
Mr PIERCE replied at some length
Mr SEY1ER ^aie!, if he understood the act of
1834, it was to give the wid ^ws a pension for five
year ; but, if the act wa-, tobe renewed,he thougat
thpy might as well r^new it for life at once, instead
ot every five years, when they were to have fresh
spp'ais ms=de to their sympathies.
M.i BtfCHANAN' said in every service tha
wi 1o-js of those who have been slain m battle, or
had died from wounds received therein, w«re pen
loned eiiher for hf« or for a certain number of
years S 'eh a system of proceeding might be con-
somnt w th -ound policy, but to pension the
w ]i ws of tho*  who died in service from any
easiiii'ty, wou d exh"uct any treasury on the face
ot ihe e^r h The pens on system, at its ongn,
had no such intention.

Distnct^of Ci lambía, wh'ch had been reported nth

The r\ )>ion was ag eed to
Mr ALLEN desired to have the eff c of the
amendment evp'ained.
Mr M'iURICK said it laid in a nutsueU. The
bill, as or'gmally reponed, ob ised the banks to
te'ume siccie payin-n's on all their own notes and
Labilities, wiih some other wnolesome and salutary
restrictions and regalitions A p-opos tion was
thei made by the Senator from Mis oun, wh'ch
prevailed in the Senate, prohibiting the bank  from
paying out or loaning any notes other than those
of specie-pacing b.nks This excluded the losti
tutions of ihe D s'net from dealing in the paper of
the circi'mpeeat S ites, with which the people
transt-cied a gieat aaan'ity of bu'mess, and there-
by renjir-d the b 11 a nullity for all practical pur
poses Ihefff-ctof ih^ b 11, Mr M sa d, woald

ev<>n bear ts a'ue in i sfa c If he p'-oph were
to be pen t'e 1 to have a bank at all, it was all
important that the imendmenl should be sustained
Another amendment wh ch 'he committee thouzhl

wa  to al'ow of the i-sue of small notes of one and
two d<dU> , 'ilidi wiuld have the effect of giving

Mr ALLC í ui, afer'he amendment of the

Was not the evil of au irredeemable paper fhett
mce^ed, when the e banks were allow© t to put
such notes in circulation? I asli that Senator (said
Mr A ) in all c?ndoi and kindness, if it will not be
so. I ask him in behalf of the suffering people of
this District (about wh ch he had told us so mach)
if ihe effect will not be the introduction rjf an irre-
deemable paper to the exclusion of all sound ana
beilthy currenc) 1 If it Wit] not, I ask him to show
me how or vthy it will not.
Mr   MERRICK rephed at considerable lejigih.
Mr ALLEN answered the observations made by
ftir Merbick, and showed that there was the JH¡o«t
glaring inconsistency between the arguments"on the
otnsr side in favot of the Fiscal Bank regulator,
and t.iose now in favor of legalizing an irredeema-
ble currency m the District of Columbia.
Mr S^JITH of Indiana spoke at some length in
favor of Mr Merhiok'  motroi.
Mr LINN sai', he thought from the iranquyíli-
tv of tie S -aior from Maryland, that all tfiijst
h?ve I'•en arranged m Coucus, ind the passage of
the bill looked on as certain. He regarded the pro-
po itiop to nmsdy t^e evils of this District by ad-
ding new bank", to be as great a piece of humbug
as that of 'he S_nator from Kentucky which his re-
gulator of the currency.
Mr L considered it the most unfortunate thing
m the world for ihu District, that the people liad
not re^pwtpd the law of Congress, that Jaw would
have * cured lo them a sound currency, had they
been governed by i s provisions
Mr BERRIEN rose to make a suggestion,
whis,h he h ipod would be adopted He could not
al o  himself to \o'e for a ch-irtei which admitted
of th  tanks <sj tig rrcdi-aniaUe p?-per. He
wool Í not c,n"tnt o su ke oft the fea'uie which
th  S natcr frrm Mis-oun had introduced <n a
prior occasion, but he would move to mo-iiiy it so
as 'o re d, "sht'l not, after the ilk of March next,"
&e. B/th=t ti'iie, th-moneiary condition ot the
countrv, •¡f hal no doi bt, would stand on a differ-
ent and be tei bas s, as ih  Bank of th  Urn ed
States would the  be m operation He beheveá
the mod ficadon he proposedwould have a tenden-
cy to relieve the people, while it would not violate
tt-e piiRcipleshehadlaid down for his oWn go-
vernment
M'. MERRICK said he accepted the modifica-
tion with pleasure.
M-. BENTON wou'd ask the Senator from
Georgia to put his amend'ie it somewhere e'se, for
Go "s sal % and not irtrcduce it along nle of an/
