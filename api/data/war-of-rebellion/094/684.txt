The instructions to pursue enemy yesterday were based on report from Colonel Maury that enemy were moving down west bank of Pascagoula. He reports at 10 p. m. yesterday, and enemy is advancing and crossing Pascagoula. Of course, you will get quicker and better information than any I can send you, and must act accordingly. Try and communicate with Colonel Scott, now moving from direction of Shubuta; get him re-enforce you.
