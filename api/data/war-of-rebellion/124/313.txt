BALLOON IN THE AIR,

May 1, 1863 - 9.15 a. m.

Major-General SEDGWICK,

Commanding Left Wing, Army of the Potomac:

GENERAL: Heavy columns of the enemy's infantry and artillery are now moving up the river accompanied by many army wagons, the foremost column being about opposite Falmouth and three miles from the river. There is also a heavy reserve on the heights opposite the upper crossing, and all the rifle-pits are well filled.

T. S. C. LOWE.

9.30 A. M.

Still another column has just started from opposite the upper crossing, but not those mentioned as reserved in my last dispatch. They are moving with great rapidity.

T. S. C. LOWE.

10 A. M.

A column of the enemy are now crossing a small run that empties into the Rappahannock at Banks" Ford. One of the columns that left from opposite here required thirty minutes to pass a given point. The balloon at Banks" Ford is continually up. Long trains of wagons are still moving to the right.

T. S. C. LOWE.

11 A. M.

I can see no earth-works on the Bowling Green road. I should judge that the guns had been taken from the earth-works to the right of Fredericksburg. Another train of wagons is moving to the right on a road about one mile from beyond the heights opposite Franklin's Crossing. The enemy's barracks opposite Banks" Ford are entirely deserted. The largest column of the enemy is moving on the road toward Chancellorsville. The enemy on the opposite heights I judge considerably diminished. Can see no change under the heights and in the riflepits. I can see no diminution in the enemy's tents.

T. S. C. LOWE.

12.30 P. M.

In a west-northwest direction, about twelve miles an engagement is going on. Can see heavy smoke and hear artillery. In a west- southwest direction, about four miles, artillery is moving toward the engagement. A large force of the enemy are now digging rifle-pits-extending from Deep Run to down beyond the lower crossing just by the edge of woods at the foot of the opposite heights. There are but few troops in sight now except those manning batteries and in the rifle-pits. There appears to be a strong force in the rifle-pits.

T. S. C. LOWE.

2.15 P. M.

The enemy opposite here remain the same as last reported. Immense volumes of smoke are arising where the battle is going on opposite United States Ford. A large force must be engaged on both sides. this would be a good time for some staff officer to ascend, if it is desirable to you.

T. S. C. LOWE.

2.45 P. M.

The enemy are throwing up earth-works for artillery on a little rise of ground at the foot of the height about 300 yards from Deep Run.

T. S. C. LOWE.

3.45 P. M.

The smoke from the battle appears to be in the same position, but in much lighter volumes. Everything opposite here remains the same.

T. S. C. LOWE,

Chief of Aeronautics, Army of the Potomac.
