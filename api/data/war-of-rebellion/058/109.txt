Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

Longstreet is said to be moving toward Knoxville by the main Virginia road, re-enforced by one division from Ewell's corps; another division expected. I have advised General Foster to keep between Longstreet and Thomas, and the latter to use every exertion to forward supplies. The question of supplies makes it impossible to re-enforce Foster where he now is, and will, I think, defeat the enemy.

I have directed General Thomas to relieve General Crook, and order him to report to General Kelley. I would respectfully ask that General Ransom, now in the Department of the Gulf, be ordered here to take his place.

NASHVILLE, TENN.,

January 16, 1864-2 p. m. (Received 7. 20 p. m.)

Major-General HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

I would respectfully suggest the propriety of ordering such new troops as have been organized in the Western States to report to me for other at once. I could replace veterans with them, and enable all re-enlisted troops to take their furlough and return by spring. They would also have better opportunities for drilling during the winter season in the South, and would improved by contact with old troops.

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General.

NASHVILLE, January 16, 1864.

Major General J. G. FOSTER,

Knoxville:

I am advised that Longstreet has been re-enforced by a division of Ewell's corps, and that another division is expected. Longstreet
