cannot vvtihhol' the expression of mv ¡>sinni-hment
that the Senator from Kentucky, who, whatever

devotion to the Unitn should now menace th<it
Union with overthrow, if we do not take to our
embrace the banki ig povv<r
[Mr Clay lit re arose ind said, that the resnect-
fulmannerm which h s name hi! been tntrodiced
by the Senator frora Mississippi, md iced h'tn to
explain to thst Senator that he had not p>-opos d
the re-ej-tabl'shment of the present Bank of the
United States, much less had he «It-red any
mi naces against the Union, that he had only ex-
piessed tne opin'on that th  failure to establish a
naticn*d bank, winch alone could supply a sound
iuid umfo m enrrene , mul.t endanger theUn on ]
Mr Wm>E siid ! did not s ate that ihe Sena-
tor fro n lüntuciv had propose 1 the rechaiter of
the Bank tf the United S ates, for he had proposed
genc-a'lv the cieation of a new nat onal bank, nor
did I intend to say, or v, i-di to 1 e understood as
stating or belevmg, that the Senitor from Ken-
tucky desticd a dissolution of th" Union, far í ther-
■w is(, but that Senator had decían d that the ques.
tt m of establishing a national bank and a °oiind
currency was a question of union or disunion
This wa  his ver} language, for I was sUitled and
«ísiounded bv the declaration, and could view it in
no other light than as an open declaration b" the
great national banking power that it was nee s-sary
to the ex s ence of the Union, and, consequently,
could uphold or d'Stioy it at its pleasure

ouent ace o* ee of the office he now holds from
h s personal antipolítica! fríen 1,President Van Bu-
rén* Did nr t the Senate, at the time, hail this ap-
pomfmert with instantaneous and unanimous
app-obution1 A.nd m ab-indon rg a in st lucr-'tive
practice f  this st tion, in soidid or sinister mo-
tives could have influenced his choice The Sena-
tor from Kentucky should have seen, in all th s,
nothma which rendered Mr Dallas's conduct a fust
subject for comm'Matv or reproach upon this occa
sion, and peimtt me ti say, that ihe Senator from
Kentucky is the last man m this house, or in this
country, whosl ould allude to iny chang' of opinion
bv Mr Dillas n regard 'o ti e Bank of the United
State , for had not the Senator from Kentucky
changed bis ovv n v lews upon this subject, and once
denounced the banlnn bis well know n and eloquent
address in this bodv as most inexpedient, mos' dan-
gerous to libeilj, and ¡jrosslv unronsnt itional
And let me fuither add, that if the Senator fiom
Keniucky thinks t a matter of reproach than any
individual should have (hanged his views in regprd
to the bank, oi a Bank of the United States, he wdl
embrace m this censure nearly every eminent
alternan n America, including tne Senator from
Kentuck) himself, and nearly eveiy member of
this body To have supported at one time the re
charter, wah adecúate limitations, of the Bank of
the United States, ere it had entered the arena of
politics, "nd to have abandoned that si pport when
the bank let fall the curtain which concealed its
danserons p )w s and alarming tendencies, is cer
tainly not on  of those extraoidmary eases which
could justify the Senator from Kentnekv n bring
mg into th s debate the name of Mi Dallas That
gentkmin ha' sustained at all times, from his
jouti upv irds the democratic partv of hi-, '¡t'te
and of ('it Un on, and tners is n thin" at a 1 ic-
maikab'e in his go ng with that panv m 1832 m
suoport of the bank v cto of ex-President Jackson
Buf the Senator from Kentucky has also told ns,
that, after anxious consideration, he believes that
the great measure of relief would be a chanse of
ruléis and he seems especially opposed to the re-
election to the Pres dency of a certain incumbent,
whom he describes as five feet eight No doubt,
if another gentleman of six feet one, a gentleman
of captivating eloquence, and many excellent so-
cial qualities and fine genius, was substituted in
p'ace of ourpiescnt Chief Magréate it would be
" certain re'iet to the numerous friends of that cen-
tle nan, and a gieat consolation to himself
The Senator from Kentucky strong ol jtcts that
Ihe Piesident has pledged the veto in certain cases
These cases are the vetos upon abolition, and a
Bink of die United Slates The«e uo pioimsed
vetos are the great rampaits of the Constitution
and op the Union Yes, abolition and the bank arc
toshaiethe same fate from the President's veto
He has so declared it, and those who heic oforc most
unjustly íepi-esaitedhim to the public as concea.hmr
or withholding his opin ons, now charge that lis í x-
presses his vi< w s 11 advance Well, s r, the cha s,t
of non eommittahsm, so often and s0 uijusfy
urjed a« unst M< Van Buren, is thus ope dj
abandoned—tht e is i o non committah m in die
Misv?g(   but all is eler, bold, manh, and dnect
And now, ha' ng discussed tne question of a
national bank, it-, A vngerous tendencies aid its
inapplicability as a measure of lehef for ire pre-
sent—that meas ire having -t all c\ «nt-,, been v oted
down bv a majority of more than ft* i to one m this
body—no bank chai tcr being presented by its fnends
for our cons deration, <md no one -ssertirg, not
even the SenMoi from Kentuck}, that we ought to
degrade this Government, bv placing it in the atti-
tude of a suppliant for the aid and patronage of the
Bank or the United States—tne quest on rectus, wh't
must be done' Thrt something must be dc ne as
regards tht receipts, safe 1 ecnmg and d sbursement
of the public moievs, all concrde, for since the
repeal of tne depjsite bank svstcm by the failure of
the banl s to redeem the r notes m specie, ana pay
the Government demand , a contingency upon
« hich the express prov sions of the in require that
the system should cease, the whole public moneys
are left to the unregulated control of the Secretary
of th-* TnasK T t ihi- Siate of things can be
pirmitted to cmtinie, is den ed bj all What,
then, is the reme< v, o !« r t an the s\ stem proposed
m the bill-nd •> nendm°nt now b^fcre us? But
one oihei tern i e ü ofeicd, and that is the cur-
rency bill, foi s d as a sUbsttln'e by the able,
patriotic "nddis'nm V S n t >r from Virginia,
(Mr Rives ) But he e permit me to remind that
gentleman that his bill does not meet the case
it makes no provision for he present, it makes
no provision for anv der>mte peiud, it leaves a
blank for some daj m the )ear 1338, when the
hill is to go into eftect, an 1 not certainly, but uaon
the doub ful contiiigncy of the real inption of spe-
nt pii ments by the banks Then hn sv^tem is to
appl) to ihe banks resuming specie pa)ments by
s>me unknown da> in the vear 1838 To my
mind the objectun ta the bill is dtcisive, that the
event contemplated by the bill may never take
place, ard that, in the mean time, it leaves the
Treasury Depaitmentand the public monevs unre-
gulated by law, and necessarily in hopeless confu-
sion We must make present, substantive, ceitam
regulation , and if it be ever proper to support the
bill of the Senator fiom Virginia, it will be at some
future period, when the banks shad have resumed
and the measure can go into operat on But I
have higher and still stronger objections I am
opposed io re-uniting the banks and the Govern-
ment, and here I shall recur to the facts on this
subject The currency bill now in'ioduced by the
Senator from Vngmia, (with the exception of one
v er> material modification as to the banks to be
included or excluded bj the operation of his pro-
viso,) is substantially the same bill which received
the sanction of the great mass of the friends ot the
adrnmstration in this bodv at the last session
The bill war regarded by me, and so declaied
b> me at the time as supplemental in its operation
to th" fir,h ■■"Ciion of ihe i epos te <ict of June,
lsfi8 That section prescribed that no note of any
bank issuing notes under five dollars should be re-
ceived in revenue payments The currency bill
extended the exclusa n to " all banks issuing bills
or no'es of a less denomination than twenty dol-
lars " No one then proposed the abandonment of
the banks as depositories, and I conceived that the
currency bill, so long as the deposite bank sv stem was
adopted, would, if carried into operation, have the
wholesome effect of excluding all bank paper of all
banks issuing notes under twenty dollars from re-
venue payments, with the hope of enlarging greatly
the specie, ¿nd diminishing ihe papei circulation
Indeed, I vottd for an amendment to the fifth sec-
tion of the deposite l^w of 1836, having a similar
ooj°ct in view, when that bill was passed, as ap-
peals bvthe S nate jouina', as follow ' June 13,
1836 —The deposite bill being under consideration
On motion of Mr Benton to amen' the reported
amendment, by inserting, a' the end of the fifth
section, the foil >win, ' and, in selecting and con-
tinuing banks as depositones of puolic money, a
jire'ererce shall be guen to the banks of good cre-
dit which shall ¡el nquish the circulation of all pa-
pel currency nnJ't twent; dollars, and which shall
enter mti arrpncioments to piomote the cnculation
of gold' ' Mj vote i-, let orded upon the journal
m fnor of tie amendment, but, unfortunately, it
did not prevf 1 The cunency b II I considered as
aimmg at the sane object, and, m that view, it íe-
ceived my support
The deposite ban' s were then proceeding m full
and successful opeiation, aere highly recommend-
ed m the President's Message, and no one proposed
then abane onment at thai time as depositories But
does the Senator fiom Vrgmia fail to observe
that this union then existing between the depo-
si'e banks and the Government has been dis-
solved, and that they have all most lamen-
tably failed, and íeduced themselves and the Go-
vernment to bankruptej t It is the banks that
have changed their coi rse as fiscal agents of the
Government, and not tho e who now oppose the
re-union And h"re let me ask the opponents of
the adm nistration who so long and loudly de-
nounced the deposite bank svstem, when it was
successful, whv have they now changed, and
when the svst«m his failed, now yield it their aup-
ppit andeonntenanet1 Let me also askihem another
