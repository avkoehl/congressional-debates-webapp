command at Pueblo in two and a half days' drive from this place, provided I can cross the creeks, which I understand are very high. I have thus far been very fortunate with my stock, but I understand that Captain Soule has taken up two that stampeded before I took command. I wish you would have them sent down, as I am very short of horses and they were the best in the company. I shall be out of forage by the time I arrive at Pueblo. I have fifteen days' rations. I have seven Government wagons, a portion of which I shall send back to Ford Garland in the morning. A messenger tells me that the roads are terrible and that the Arkansas cannot be forded at any place, but I shall try and get through as soon as I can.

Yours, respectfully,

ISAAC GRAY,

Captain Co. E, First Cavalry of Colorado.

P. S.-I shall send this by messenger to Pueblo.
