The question recurring on the adoption of Mr
Clay's resolutions,
Mi SOUTHARD said that as the question
recuired upon the reasons of the Secretary of the
Treasury for the removal of the deposites, and
the resolutions of the gentleman from Kentucky
founded upon them, he would endeavor to meet
it It presented a serious ard very important
question For sixteen years past the money of
We people had been deponed m the place selected
by Congress and the laws for its reception, and it
has now been removed and deposited in places
wnere Congress has not directed it to be placed,
to wit in some twenty or thirty of the State banks
It was, before the removal, in the place which
Congress had cieated, and it is now where Con
gress has no control over it It therefore presents
a question most intimately connected with the
safety, weliare, and best interests of the country
It was not a question of office or of place, or
whether the Bank of the United States should be
rechartered or not It is a question placed far
above it, it rises higher, and fixes and determines
fomei aftei the powers delegated to a high func
tionary of the Government, and when political
aspi-ants shall be forgotten, and the scramble for
office shall be at an end, it will stand in bold relief
before posterity as the assump'ion and exercise of
an enormous power It becomes us, therefore, to
consider the subject with calmness and delibera-
tion, and he proDosed to consider—fiist, what the
Secretary has done, second, the principles by
which he has been governed, a>id third, the rea-
sors he has given for doing the act
1st What has the Secietary done' He has
ordered the inferior officers and debtors of the
Government to place the money of the Govern-
ment in places which he has selected, so that here-
after the money shall be placed there according to
his orders, and on teims which he has prescribed,
and these terms are to be found in the agreement
made with the banks where the moneys are to be
deposited In page 40 of the pamphlet copy of
the report, we find the terms, or tne agreement,
which has been made vvuh the banks to receive
the money To know what is done, and how it
has been done, it is necessary to refer to that
cgreement The first item is, that "thesa d bank
' agrees to receive and enter to the credi' of the
' T reasurer of the United States all sums of money
' offeied to be deposi ed Qn account of the United
' States, &c , whether in gold or silver, or notes of
' theBankof theUmted States or branches,in notes
' of any bank which are convertible into com in
' its immediate vicinity, or in notes of any uank
'which it i<!,for the time being, m the habit of
* receiving " Which it ism the hab tof receiving'
Let it be remarked that these receiving banks con-
fine themselves to a particular specified kind of
money which they rece ve in their immediate
vicinity The second item is, " that if the depos
' ltesmsaid bank shall exceed one half of its capital
' stock actually paid in, it is agreed that collateial
' secunty si all be given,"&c Then let it be ob
sened, too, that heie is no present security for the
people's money It has been placed in ceitain
banks without first taking the necessary security,
even if the Secretary possessed the power to do
so And if hereafter it snould be taken, it must
be done by the Secretaiy.not by Congiess The
Secietaiy has not obta.ned the security, and he
could not possibly know the necessity for it, for
he says e\piessly he has not seen ti e charters of
the selected banks And he was in such a huny
to effect the removal, that one of the banks was
actually incapable of leceiving them Another
item is, that the banks aie to maketransfeis of the
public moneys fiom place to place on reasonable
notice given And what is to be undeistood by
reasonable notice' Suppose an order should be |
«sued to transfer £,200,000 to a particular place
in five days is that reasonable notice' and would
the bank notified agree that it was reasonable
notice' Another item is, that all the services re
quired of these banks are to be performed in
their immediate vicinity And heie there is a
perfect surrender of the rights which Congiess
should possess of transferring the money to any
point in the country Another item is, that an
agent or agents are to be appointed by the Secre-
tary of the Treasury, and the compensation and
expenses of this agency are to be fixed by him,
placed under the control of the Secretary, and as
to the banKs, why they are to pay for it And,
sir, the consequences are apparent The seventh
item authorizes the Secretary to dismiss the re
ceiving banks at his will and pleasure But the
Secretary has omitted to tell us when contracts
were made with most of the banks The dates of
some he has given, but as to the others the time at
which they were entered into he has altogether
omitted to state Sir, when the Secretary was
about to give his reasons for the act in question,
was it ingenuous, was it honest to conceal from
Congress when these contracts were made as going
to operate on those very reasons ' There was
another thing, tne solvency or insolvency of the
selected banks which the Secretary had not in-
quired into, and therefore he could know nothing
about it He had not seen the charters, but was
go imprudent as to act without the necessary in-
formation and now Congres? was called on to
justify him in an act which affects the!Treasury of
the nation The time selected by him, the period
at which the action took place, manifests too truly
that he did not desire this infoimation On the
18th September he determined to remove the de-
posites The action upon this determination took
place on the 2Gth, and was there time to make the
necessary inquiry, which, in (ustice to the country,
the importance of the act rendered it recessary
should be made' But, pernaps, it may be sug-
gested that everythingnecssary to beknown was
known, because a negotiating agent had been ap-
pointed on 'his subject the August preceding But
his report could have been made only a few days
preceding the action of the Secretary, and by the
well known course of time and distance, it could
only have been known as to two or three banks
in the cities m this vicinity But|is to the banks
from Maine to Louisiana it could not have been
known It is true the Secretary assuies us that
the banks are of undoubted credit He (Mr S )
was not disposed to impeach the word of the Sec
retary, but when we were called on to act on this
important question, he could not take the dictum
of the Secretary He wished to know the fact,
and witnout obtaimrg it the Secretary has been
guilty of a most gross and palpable violation of
his duty He tells us he was obliged to draw
monev out of the Bank of the United S ates, and
give it to the State banks for the purpose of sus
taming them, and yet he says they are of un-
doubted solvency It may be so But when they
areg ven duties to perform not authonzed by their
charters, their very act becomes an act of nsolv
ency In regard to what the Secretary did in
making thecontiact he was not satisfied, but there
was anothei gieater and paramount cause of dis-
satisfaction it was the power to make these con-
tracts If the Secretary ii mve-ted with no powei
I to make the contract, the contracts are void But
this was a question which it was unnecessary to
aigue, because, unless authority can be shown for
it, it is void, except so faroniyas it depends upon
1 the honor of those with whom he has made the
contract He would like to know and be i nformed
i of the power and authority given to the Secretary
foi making these contracts which affect the whole
ti easure of the tlmted Stages He could find none,
and he had searched carefully But, on the con-
tiaiy, he had found something the very opposite
i of it—sometnmg direct'y against it He referred
1 to the act read by the gentleman from Kentucky,
passed in May, 1820 He would ask, does that
act mean what that gentleman contended for or
not' He had heaid the construction given to it
by that gentleman, and perfectly coincided with
him m it But there was another remark which
he had to make on the Secretary s argument on
this subject The Secretary says that the pow er
to remove necessarily draws after it the power to
fix the place of deposite    Sir, it is a non «equilur
It does not follow of course The Secretary is
 the agent of the law, and can act only by the
law The Secretary of the Treasury is to decide
as to the general management of the treasure of
the Union Bat the Treasurer himself is the offi-
cer designated by Congress to perform express
acts to be done in the disbursement of the public
moneys He hoped to be able to show that it
was the Treasurer, in the absence of all laws to
the contrary, who was to select the places for the
safe-keeping of the public moneys There waa
another thing to be considered—the influence
which this act was calculated to exert upon public
sentiment in relation to the extent of delegated
powers Looking into it as the act of the Secre-
tary, and he would ask if it was not a powei enor-
mous in itself, and dangerous to the institutions of
the country ' This agreement places the receiving
banks at the will and mercy of the Secretary He
can destroy them all at a single blow, he may re-
quire payments to be made agreeably to his own
direction, he may determine when, how, and m
what time, they shall transmit money from place
to place He may retain, dismiss, or discharge
them, whenever he sees fit, and this from other
motives than should govern a public officer m the
discharge of his duties He may show favor and
partiality to whom he pleases, for by this act he
has created an army of sycophants and support-
ers Sir, have we not seen the answer of one of
these banks to the notification of the selection'
The president says " I take the occasion to ex-
' press the high sense of honor conferred upon the
' bank by so distinguished a mark of your confi-
'dence," thus stooping and cringing to the dis-
penser of favors All this is not according to the
laws of the land, but the authority of the Secre-
tary, and he says, " I am under the President of
the Unued States " He has no official will of his
own, and all this power is to be in the hands of
the President If Senators are willing to have it
there, let them do so, but if no*, he hoped they
would say so Congress had regulated the inter-
course between the Government and the Bank of
tne United States, but as to the banks selected in
its stead as the public depository, at the whim of
the Secretary, they were taken out of those regu-
lations, and placed under his sole control, and
would Senators countenance such acts' But the
Secretary has done another act He has recom-
mended that the holders of public money, dis-
bursing officers, who are under bond for the safe-
keeping>of that money and its faithful disburse-
ment, to deposite those moneys in certain banks,
(and this act is approved by the President in page
41-'2 of the pamphlet ) Sir, by this act the Pres-
ident has violated his duty He has duected the
Secretary to do an act by which he has placed all
the disbursing officers of the Government at his
own will and discietion What, he would inquire,
would be the consequence of that act on every
such officer of the Government' Suppose three or
four large disbaising officers here had been in the
habit of placing ttieir money in the Patriotic Bank,
and the order of the Secretary should be received
to íemove them from the Patriotic Bank and place
them m the Bank of the Metropolis, and after-
wards supposing they should be lost what would
the consequences be' If the Bank of the Metrop
olía should not safely keep it, the officers would
be released from their bonds, or if not released,
they would be placed at the meicy and under the
power of one man, and an officer of the law not
empowered to interfere with tnem The Secre-
tary has ordered the deposities to be made to the
credit of the United States, but he has made no
contract that the money placed m the receiving
banks shall be secuied to the United States He
hrs drawn the pub lc money from the Bank of 'he
United States and the Treasuiy of the United
feta'es in direct violation of law He has given
diafts in favor of the Union Bank of Maryland,
the Guard Bank, the Mechanics' and Manhattan
Banks of Ne vYork for sums amounting to nearly
three millions of dollars How much more to
other banks we do not krow and these drafts are
not coun'c-signed by the Comptroller in the usual
way And as to the time wh n they were drawn,
that is not known, but after they had been issued
some time, it was di coveied that they had been
out and in the hands of the cashiers of these banks
a month before they were presented for payment,
