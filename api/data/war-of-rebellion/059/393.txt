MOUNT STERLING, KY., April 17, 1864.

J. S. BUTLER,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

Do not receive any news from Colonel True. All quiet at this place, Mount Sterling. I made preparation to receive any guerrilla force that might wish to encroach upon this place, stretching wires across the streets and making barricades on pavements for protection of men.

Captain, Commanding.
HDQRS. FIRST DIVISION, DISTRICT OF KENTUCKY,Lexington, April 17, 1864.

Colonel J. M. BROWN,

Commanding at Irvine, Ky.:

COLONEL: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your communication of 16th instant. I have been fully satisfied for several days that no formidable could be made through the eastern part of the State; a great deal of alarm on the part of citizens brought about by rumors of an invasion, put in circulation by the friends of the rebellion. I am confident that the plan proposed by Captain Seldon F. Bowman, if carried out, will effectually rid the eastern border counties of marauders and guerrilla bands. Let the captain make application to the Governor in proper form, with your indorsement, and forward to these headquarters, and I will give it full approval and urge its adoption. Colonel Gallup fought the enemy on the 14th instant; drove them to Salyersville; killed and wounded 24, among them Colonel E. F. Clay; captured 50, 100 horses, 200 stand of arms. Colonel True, with Fortieth Kentucky and Eleventh Michigan, should have been at Salyersville last night. True captured 6 rebels beyond Mount Steling. I have full confidence in your ability, and will leave to your own discretion and judgment the disposition of your regiment.

Very respectfully,

E. H. HOBSON,

Brigadier-General.
