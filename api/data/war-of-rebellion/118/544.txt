DEPOT PRISONERS OF WAR,

Near Sandusky, Ohio, May 1, 1863.

Colonel W. HOFFMAN, Commissary - General of Prisoners.

COLONEL: General Burnside has postponed the execution of Thomas M. Campbell, spy, till the 8th, one week. I received your dispatch in which you direct no visitors on the island the day of execution. The doctor desired Donahoe and perhaps another physician. The chaplain said he would like another clergyman, especially if the prisoners desired. I also consented that the sheriff of one county

(Sandusky) [be present] as I am under obligations to him for irons, &amp;c., besides being very accommodating in taking prisoners sometimes in the winter. I also design to give passes to reporters of the press to a limited number.
