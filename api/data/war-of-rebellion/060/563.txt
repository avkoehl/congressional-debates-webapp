TUESDAY NIGHT, February 15, 1864-9. 30 p. m. (Received 9. 56 p. m.)

Captain GEORGE S. SHAW,

Aide-de-Camp, Hdqrs. Dept. of Washington:

Mr. Childs, employed by Engineer Department, writes to Colonel Tannatt this evening:

Arrangements are now complete for barricading Aqueduct Bridge. Twenty-five or 30 men are required to do it. No orders have been received by guard at south end of bridge. I leave a foreman and 6 men at south end of bridge, and will be obliged if you will send an officer to direct when the bridge shall be closed. Everything is ready to close the bridge at five minutes' notice.

Tannatt has sent the men, and says:

It now remains for some one to name the hour when the passage should be closed. Will the general telegraph upon that point and inform me of the result, that I may be fully advised for any emergency.

I have been past the south end of the Aqueduct Bridge. Rifle-pits have been dug this afternoon this side the guard-house on both sides the bridge, and logs are ready near at hand to close the avenue entirely.

G. A. DE RUSSY,

Brigadier-General.
