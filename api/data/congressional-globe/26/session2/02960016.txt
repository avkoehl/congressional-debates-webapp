26th Cons-.-.2nd Sess.                                   Report of the Postmaster General                                                      Sen. & H. of Reps.
In examining the causes vshich have placed ihe
Department in iu pie<ent condition, we discover
its resource , and its ability not only to sustain
itself, bat probablj, with the aid of *ome remedial
legislation, to admit ot a P'osrective leductioi of
the ta'iff ofletter poitage, which public seaunitnt
seems to demand.
Thee causes are to be found in the unexampled
fluctuations since 1834 m the financ ai interest-  and
commercial bsuness of the country    The pei od
of unprecedented o\eracuor> in tr?de, from the fall
of 1834 to the spring of 1837, occas oned f n extra-
ordinary increase ef rev nue, which produced ihe
large surplu  that exited in 1836 and 1837    Th s
surplus formed (he basis of the graat  ex envión of
the mail serv ce since 1836, which so ¡ar ixieeded
the limits to which it could have been carried by
the   orimary   increase   of  revenue,   as   to   ab
sorb nearlv   ihe   whole   of   this   surplus   m two
year        When   the   ieaction   came   on,   which,
under any   wcums'ances,   would  have  depiess
ed   its   revenu «-,   the   Department  had   to   sus-
tain itse'f \vi h an ex ent of service be} ond its ra
tural limit , which had originated from theextr-or
dmary increas  of its revenues m 1P36 aid  ld37
But the unusia' h cr a>-e of revenue over ine   ex
penditures during th^se two yeirs, was not m'iri-
ly owing to the g-eat activity of trade     Toe c n
tracts for transportation, during that period, bad
mostly been made when pace* weie low, and th"
revenue accruing from ihe r performanee w?s re-
ceived when prices had advanced from fifty lo one
hundred per cent      Th  Depirtmea', therefore,
enjoyed the advantages of an txc ted '■¡ateo   bu

There are ofhor caas«  of a mere limited id fía
(fncs -which haw coctnbu ed to impair toe revenue
the past year The grta'iy enhanc-d expen«e of the
transportation of ihe mail upon rat roa s s not the
only way m which they affect the revenues of this
Department The great facih íes whiea they af-
ford for ihe transmt ¡> on of letters and newspapers
out of the mad, have eviden ly d in n shed <h* re
cetpts froTi postage This is proved by the Sbdden
falling oft of tne ¡e\em.e at points where these fa-
cilities hne recen'/ b^en provided Informal on
has also been received from the agea's of tfe De-
partment, showing that 'ette s, packets, aac> ne s
papers, were ex ensivt'y conv?yid out cf the mnl
on the railroad and steamboat lines, and on man}
of the s a^e and coach rou es Sj far a^ these
practices, so detrimental to the income o^ the De-
partment, were believed to be m vio anon of law,
I «ndeavored H ■««ppre « them  r^ga1- i m it as my
h gt est duty to enforce ihe 1 iw And in respeet to
letters carried by earners and driver-., these efforts,
it is believed, have been generally fíFec ual, but
thtre is no prohib tion against persons conveying
letters and packe's who may pass over mail routes
in the same vehic'e which transports ine mail, and
the radroads afed great facilities for send ng 'et-
ers in this nay.
F)r fifeen years preceding the introduction of
the new system in Englana, the pc stage tax had
rather declned, notwithstanding the increase of
populat on and business Tins was, by many,
ascribed to the high rate ol the tax, but the better
and rore ptevaihng opinion a tributes it to lh°
numerous railroads which have gone into opera-
tio)
Ihe practice of carrying newspapers out of the
mat', without haviig secured the p ívilege m the
contract, I fi und to be so general, that it could not
be suppressed without greaf inconvenience to the
pu lie, and, as the ambiguity of the hw admit ed
ot doubts in íegard to the restriction, I concluded
that I s lould best discharge my duty by permitting
the^e practic s to continue, and leave it for Con-
gress either to remove the prohibition or to make
tne Jaw more explicit foi its enforcement As it is
probable that tha enforcement of ihe probiottion
would have the efftct of stopping ihe earning of
newspapers on the mail routes, rather than causing
them to be conveyed in the mail, it would seem
both just and politic to abolish the restriction en-
tirely
Another source of detriment to th" revenue the
past year, has beea the ex<"rci c and abu^e of the
¡ranking nnvil^e t > an unpreccn id exten Dur-
ing the list three querier , the t ee matter consn-

And there are lacis that h°-"e come o the
knowle'g" of the Department, which "how
that great abu es have been practiced by those en-

he lowest -.tatior , in cvering the <-ot'espond-
ctice of (theis, to ihe great injury of its rc-
ieiup Thisgndoher abusesof ihe privilege ap
pear to be rapidiy increasing, and impei oiuly de
mand a remedy, either by its entire aoohtion, or
such restrictions upon it as c^uld be enforced by
th  Department
The provision in the f ct of 1825, allowing two
c nts to postmasters on free let'ers should be abo-
1 íbied, as it i* unrea onablc that those enjoying an
exc usive privilege shou'd derive a revenue from
the same privilege possessed by others Postmas-
t>rs mignt be propu ly res noted in tending and re-
eeiV ng fr e letteis, to their own offise It is m the
nature of all exclusive pnv legei to run into abuser
and hence we fin 1 that, of the twelve acts of Con-
gress relating to the franiing privilege of its mem-
bers and officers, all, with one exception, have
served to enlarge the right
The collection and disbursement of the revenues
have been conducted with success and convenience
by the agents o the Department, with little trouble
to them, ahi without charge upon its means. The
act of the 4th July last has occasioned no material
change in the financial system of this Department,
except substituting the receivers general for the
postjnasters, at some important points, as the depo-
sitaries of its fund . But the penal provision* of
the ac, which make Ihe using or loaning the pub-
lie moneys a convexión and embezzlement of
them, and punishable as a criminal offence, are ap-
plicable to pootma ten, and cannot fail of having
a salutary influence in promoting piompt payment
of the quarterly balances, of which there has been
great improvement the last fiw jears, and in pre-
venting defalcations
The revision of the tariff of postage, with the
vi"w to reduction and convenience, hac, for some
years past, attracted the public attention, and, on
seveial occas ons, been brought under the conside-
ra ion of Congress without any definite action.
At tie second session oí the twenty fifth Congress,
tae Hous1 of Representatives adopted resolutions
ia iins on the P stmaMer General to stale "what,
in his opinion, wuu d be the effect on the revenues
of the Department, of the establishment of the
following tariff of postages of letters On letters
comejed 80 mdes and under, five cents, over 80
milis and not exceedn? 200, ten cents, over 200
aril not exceeling 400, fifte n cents, over 400
mi es, twenty Gents, and to s ate what other tariff,
fixing the rates m federal money, and having in
view the greatest reduction consistent with the ne-
ce% ary means of the Department, if any, in his
judgment, woo1 J oe more just than the above And
t"a' he also s ate what alterations, if any, may be
m"di m tht, p-esent ia*"s of postage on newspa-
pirv, patr pde s, and periodical, so as to promote
the circulation ot in*brma ion without detriment to
tne ftivenu s of the Deprimen'."
I is oiipp^sed that this resolution, in connection
with the prevailing iai re«t then felt in ihe success
of th  experiment making in England by what is
cslled the penny sy tern, indaced the late Postmas
ter General to commission George Phtt, e<q one ot
thespedal agents of this Derartment, to visit Eu-
rope for il e p rpo«e o collecting such mforma-
* on concern rs? Me new sysiem m Eoglaad, and
the mail esUblt im*n s in oiher Su'opean coun-
tries, a^ might c i d >ce to >b' improvement oí our
own sjstem
Mr Phtt left the Un ted States on this special
service in Jun<% 1839, and re urned in August last
The results of ¡its mqaines are con a ned in the re-
port prepared by h m, wh'ch i hfrewith submitted
It contains extensive details tending to show the
condition and management of the mail establish-
ment in several oí the most important couatnes
in E irope, and many interesting tacts and valua-
ble suggestions for the improvement of the system
m hi United States Many of the reforms and
iuirrov< meatsrecommeded are deserving of conside-
ra leu It will be seen that he recommends an
ent re change in our tariff of postage, and to have
all mat1 mj-ttei taxed by weigh , letteis not weighing
over half an ounce ii be rated at five cents for any
distance less than 500 mdes and ten cents over
that di ancc and the same rates for every addition-
al half cjnee *hea prepaid, and double those rates
when not, prepaid As such a change would give
great relief, not only to the commercial interest, but
to the who'e community, it 's to be regretted that
neither the present condition nor future prospects of
the es'abhshment seem to justify so great a redac-
tion in the postage tsx.
It is apparent that ao ereential change m the
