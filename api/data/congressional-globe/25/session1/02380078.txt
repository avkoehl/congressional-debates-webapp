25th Cong....1st Sfss.                                 Making public officers depositories—Mr. Walker.                                                      Senate.
to keep and bring down the tariff and the price of
Ihe public ¡amis, and Junit the tales to actual set-
tlers, upon what pnncip'e can I refuse to sustain it?
Prom thp filit moment of entering this body, I have
invarnbly opposed the surplus distubution policy,
in all its forms and undei every aspi-ct, and as in-
variably advocated the reduction of the revenue to
the wants of the Gov err meat, by reducing the ta-
riff reducing the puce of the public lands, and con-
fining the. sales to actual settlers or cultivators, and
shall I now oppose a bill winch must prove so pow-
erful an auxiliary of these great measures1
Nor is it less obvious that the re establishment of
a great Bank of the Lmtcd States as the fiscal
agent of the Government would be  a  slill more
powerful ally oí  the tariff pohcj     It   vould be
equ i"y its interest to mciea«e  the tauff, and thus
augment it  deposites and dividends     And if, as
we are informed by its friends it could become the
regulator of the State institutions, existing, as Mr
Biddle has told us, by ¡Is forbearance, it could, at
'Us pleasuie, wheel  into Golumn this aimy of de-
endent corporations, as auxd aties of the gieat
ank powei in augmenting the tariff
But the Senator from Kentucky, among other
causes, which he enumerated as producing the pie-
sent disasters, was the veto of his land bill in 1833,
by ex-Piesident Jackson    Now, by the provisions
of that bill, the nett proceeds of the sales of the
public lands for the years 183% 1834, 183"3, 1836,
and 1837, were to be distributed among Ihe States
By a reference to the public documents, it appears
that these sales amounted to about sixty mill ons
of dollars    This sum was to be irrevocably dis-
tributed among the States, and was to be lost for
evet by the General Government    Now we have
aheady distubuted twenty-seven millions of dol-
lars among the Slates and are compelled to make
a temporary loan ot ten millions of dollars, as au-
thonzed by the bill which nas already passed this
body, rendered necessary by a deficit in the public
revenue     Now Ihis bill of the Senaloi fiom Ken-
tucky would have  increased this deficit to foity-
three millions of dollars, as proved mcontestibly
by   the   facts   and  documents    now before    us
This bill, then, would have reduced us to a most
disgraceful bankruptcy     It would have involved
us in a new national debt, and lendeied an in-
crease of the tariff inevitable    By this operation,
the State of Mississippi, where it íeceived one dol-
lar, would ha\c been compelled to pa} back thier
by the opeu tion oí Ihe tarifl  riducin,, ti e pi ice of
her    tapie, and depressing the gieat agricultural
interest of the whole couniiy    Such woull have
been the glorious effects of this measure—such the
relief it would have extended to the c immunity
Its relic1 would have been an immense national de'it
and   oppressive  taxes     In die session oí  1835—
183b, Ihe Senatoi  from   Kentucky  again adto-
< ited the   passage oí   this bill,  when I thought
it mv  duty   to   oppose the measuie, and  point
out the evil consequences which the lesult has
siown wouluh<>ve flowed from iU adoption    At
tie Liot session, the Senator fiom Kentucky again
introduced a similar measure gfvping for distn-
bttion mese sales of the pablic lands, lor the past
as well as for the futuie, and terminating only on
the last of December, 1841    This measure would
have reduced Ihe Government to still more irre-
trievable bankruptcy     But the worst of its effects
are jet to be told    Th'a bankruptcy, and its asso-
ciated national debt, would have occuired or accu-
mulated at the commencement of the year 1842—
the very year foi the final adjustment of the tariff
under what is ca'led the compromise act, when this
accumulaled debt would have rendered it impossi-
ble to prevent an augmentation of the tarifl
Such woald have been the effects of the various
land bi'ls of ihe Senator from Kentucky But, if
that Senator could hai e united with me in tne sup-
poit of the land bill introduced by me the session
before the 'ast, reducing the puce of the public
lands in favor of settlers and cultivators, con-
fining the sales to them, the present disasteis, in aU
probability, would not hax e ovcrwnelmed i s We
should have had little or no suiplus The enoi-
mous sales of public lands to speculators, amount-
ing, in two years, to about for'y millions of dollars,
produced this surplus    The^c saies would have
been prevented by the passage of that bill This
surplus, as I took occasion then to predict, has been
the potent cause of the present disasters , and the
deposite—the fatal deposite distubution bill, with
its no less fatal equalizing supplement, so strenu-
ously opposed by me, precipitated the great catas-
trophe This forty millions of surplus deposited
with the banks has b°en regarded by them as capi-
tal, and upon it they have extended their issues to
an extent unprecedented This inflation of the
currency caused overaction m all the departments
of trade and business The hanks not only swelled
their issues, but, as a nesessary consequence, paper
credit of every description increased to an alarming
extent Prices lose irciedibly, and every thing
found a purchaser, upon credit, at almost any
price Mercantile acceptances, founded not on
money or produce, but on credit only, were aug-
mented to an extent heretofore unknown New
York and New Orleans, being the greatest theatres
of these operations, were the fi rst to feel ihe shock—
the first link in the chain of paper credit breaking
at New Orleans, and the next m New York These
calamities, though no one could tell the precise
moment when the catasfriphe would come, were
clearlj designated in the report in favcr of the land
bill, presented by me two sessions ago The
means, also, of guarding against these calamities,
were fully pointed out m that report These
means weie, to pass the land bill at once, and pre-
vent the accumulation of that surplus which after-
wards rose t> fortv mi'lions, and swept before it
Ihe I anks, the Government, and the people I will
only trouble the Senate with one short extract irom
that report
" It is, then, the interest of the whole Union that
those monopolies of the public lands should be ar-
rested, and that capital should continually flow m
the various channels of productive industry, If,
among other causes, the existing embarrassments
are now greatly attubutable to the speculating in-
vestment of millions, during the past year, m wild
lands, what will be the result if the system is pei-
mitted to continue for a series of years unabated'
Is it easy to foresee that the necessary consequence
will be increasing disticss and embarrassment, or
a' least a diminution of the national prosperity "
At that session this land bill could scarcely ob-
tain a hearing, and the predictions of the report,
portraying the disasteis that would occur fiom the
refusal to prevent the accumul tion of the surplus,
were tieated as wild and visionarj We were ca-
leenng onward upon the tide of an unreal piospe-
rity and no one could be induced to look forw ard
to that shore where the mighty vessel of the Go-
vernment itself was destined so soon to be wreck-
ed and stranded But, at the next session, when,
as the report had predicted, whole States had been
covered by speculative entries of public lands,
with ba'es of bank piper obtained by loans of this
accumulated surplus then, at last, when perhaps
even then it was too late, tins land bill obtained a
hearing It passed the Senate, but vv as, met un-
foitunately, defeated m the House, as also was the
bill reducing the tariff, then, for the first time, we
set seriously to work to reduce the revenue to the
w ants of the Government, and the new deposre
distubution project of the last session was defeated,
on my motion, by the casting vote of VicePiesi-
dent Van Buren And shall we not all learn, from
the catastiophe which followed (he surplus, the fa-
tal tendency of that policy, and thai the only path
of safety for us is to reduce the revenue to the
wants of the Government
The next great question pr sent d in the address
of the Senatoi from Kentuckv, was ihe creation
by Congress of a n tional bank, as the only mea-
sure, in his opinion, calculated to relieve the dis-
tresses of the country Whv then has he not fav oi-
ed us with his project of a charter, that it might be
examined by Congress, and bv the nation'' This
the Senator had not done, and his failure to present
his plan, would be legarded in no othei light than
as an acknowledgment of the great and intrinsic dif-
ficulty mvclvedinsuch a question Suielj thatSena-
for could not ask the Senate to vote against the mea-
sures now under consideration, unless he proposed
some substitute None, he presumed, weieso entire-
ly confiding, as to take upon trust any and every
charter of a bank which that gentlem?n might
think proper for the present contingency Let us
sfe the bul with all its specifc provisions, that
Congress and the couniiy may compare it with the
measures now under consideration, and decide be-
tween them with full light and knov 'edge upon the
wholesubject Howevergreat he confidence «Inch
any portion of the American people mi^ht íepose m
Senators opposed to the administration, he hardlv
thought the nation would be carried aw ay bj anv
vague or indefinite proposition, anj c'amor, how-
ever loud, for a national bank—a national bank,
when the charter w as withheld from their conside-
ration I now call u¡ on the benators opposed to
the administration lor their specific plan of relief,
for a view of their proposed bank ch-uter, and if
thi^were refused, it must either be conceded that
they can present no practical pioject, or the charge
of non-committalism,whtch had been so industrious-
ly circulated, but without the shadow of founda-
tion, against the President of the United States,
must recoil on tho«e w ho made it
But although the Senator from Kentucky had not
favored the Senate or the country w ith the pro
visions of his proposed bank charter, vet hehasde
signated the means by which at least apoitionof
the specie necessary to constitute a part of the capi-
tal ot the bank, may, m his opinion, be obtained
He tells us that fifteen or twenty millions may le
obtained from abroad, and that if we object to the
supposed influence which the foieign stockholders
would have m the institution, lo p «ven tsuch stock
holders voting m the e'ection ot dnectors We
have fried this heretofore, and it ¡I lot prevent th s
influence The iact is, the ov nership of so vast a
portion of the stock ot the bank bv British 'cids
and bankers, would necessarily give them a pow-
erful influence over the mst t ition, and enab'e
them, by an alliance form0 ! belv een the Ameiicau
and British banks to conlrol the moiieved Hansac-
tionsofboth countries, and to elevate c df press
the price of property at their pleasuie 1 ne Sena-
tor from Ma sachusetts [Mr Webster] had a few
days since derived this power of creating a nation-
al bai k from the authority given to Congress to re-
gulate commerce, but w ere this position correct,
which was not conceded, are we piepared to sur-
render this pou ei of regulating commerce to ary
great irresponsible moneyed corporation—much less
to such a corporation, composed in part of any por-
tion of Ihe Butish aristociacv—the hostility of so
many of whom to ou republ can insfitut ons vas
so well known, and clearlv defined1 To trust in
whole or in part m their keeping the moneved and
commercial relations of this great repub' c never
would be permitted by the people of theUniled States
Besides, weie we willing ihus to pi-ocuie this
amount ot specie fiom England fui these pui-
poses—if the argument of the fnerds of a national
bank m this bod) be hue, that, what they have
been pleased to cdl the iciced importations ot
specie into this countrv, produced by the policy of
ihe late administration, Ins caused a comparative
scarcity in Europe of the prec ous metals, ard
partly occasioned their and our ei. sting embaír so-
men! , and the fall of colten and of pi res gene-
ral1)—what, vve may ask would, upon these prin-
ciples, be the effect of this sadden and imme hate
demand upon England, at this period, fa fifteen or
twenty millions of specie' It is m v am to sup-
pose that we could, at this period, put national
bank m operation, by borrowing m England fif-
teen or twenty millions in specie No, wc would
have to leok anion" ourselves for the st >cl holder ,
for the nation would permit no otheis, an 1 the
specie to put  uch a bank in operation mist also
be looked for among oiu selves
A national bank, capable, according to the
theoiy of its friends, of regulating fhe exis'ing Slate
banks, including the regulation of their late alleged
regulator the Bank of the United States, rechaitered
by Pennsylvania, must possess an actual capital,
as I shall piove hereafter, of at least seventy mil-
lions of dolíais, and, so far as paid m, consisti"g of
gold and silver ¡\o one would propose a bank,
whose capital was not paid up, for the bubble bu-
siness of creating banks on the stock notes or cre-
dit of the stockholders, could have no advocates in
this chamber   Such a bank must commence its ca-
