THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

The amendments reported from the Committee
of the Whole on the state of the Union were then
agreed to.
Mr. COX. I ask the gentleman from Pennsyl-
vania to call the previous question upon the pas-
sage of the bill, and then let it go over until to-mor-
row.
Mr. STEVENS. We might as well dispose
of the matter to-night.
The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a
third time; and beina; engrossed, it was accord-
ingly read the third time.
Mr. HOLMAN. I demand the yeas and nays
upon the passage of the bill; and upon that I call
for tellers.
Tellers were not ordered.
The yeas and nays were not ordered.
The bill was then passed.
Mr. STEVENS moved to reconsider the vote
by which the bill was passed; and also moved t<
lay the motion to reconsider on the table.
The latter motion was agreed to.
NAYY APPROPRIATION BILL.
Mr. STEVENS. I will state to the House, that
after ordering the main question upon the Navy
appropriation bill we will consent to adjourn.
Mr. MAYNARD. I ask the unanimous con-
sent of the House to take from the Speaker's
table the Senate bill in reference to the currency,
in order that it may be referred to the Committee
of Ways and Means.
Mr. PENDLETON objected.
Mr. STEVENS. I send to the Clerk's desk an
amendment to the Navy bill, to take the place of
the amendment agreed to by the Committee of the
Whole in reference to the same subject.
Mr. HOLMAN. Has the previous question
been called upon this bill?
Tile SPEAKER pro tempore. It has not.
Mr. MORRIS. I move that the House do
now adjourn.
Mr. STEVENS. I hope not.
The motion was not agreed to.
Mr. STEVENS. I now ask for the reading
of my amendment.
The amendment, which was read, was to strike
out the eleventh amendment adopted by the Com*
mittee of the Whole, and to insert in lieu thereof
the following:
Sec. 2. Andbeit further enacted, That hereafter, while
this rebellion lasts there shall be one additional midship-
man appointed for each congressional district in the loyal
States, to be nominated by the members and delegates of
the FJouse of Representatives as heretofore ; and the addi-
tional midshipmen lor the next cla-ss *hall be appointed on
the nomination of the members and delegates of this Con-
gress.
Mr. STEVENS. Upon that amendment I de-
mand the previous question.
Mr. F. A. CONKLING. I would suggest as
a vet bal amendment that the word 44 recommend-
ed" be substituted for the word "nominated."
Mr. STEVENS. I accept that modification.
Mr. MORRILL, of Vermont. I would ask the
gentleman from Pennsylvania whether he will
allow the House to have a vote which shall test
the question whether we intend to throw out the
boys who are now in that school?
Mr. STEVENS. Certainly.
Mr. SEDGWICK. I rise to a question of order.
It is that the amendment proposes a new mode of
appointing cadets to the Naval Academy, and
therefore it is not in order upon this appropria-
tion bill.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chan* is of
opinion that as the amendment is germane to the
amendment adopted by the Committee of the
"Whole it is m order.
Mr. SEDGWICK. My point is that it pro-
poses new legislation.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair is of
opinion that the point comes entirely too late, j
TH?! I-Iouae has received the report of the Com- j
mi dee of the Whole, and the amendment is ger- '
mane to the amendment of the committee. If the '
point had been taken in the committee when the
subject was introduced, it might have been a good
one.
The previous question was seconded, and the
main question oideied to be put.
And then, on motion nf Mr. STEVENS, (at
a quarter before six o'clock, p. m.,) the House !
adjourned. t

PAY OP TROOPS IN MISSOURI.
Mr. WILSON, of Missouri. I askthat the joint
resolution No. 118, from the House of Represent-
atives, which has been considered in this body
before, be now taken up and passed. There will
be no discussion. The resolution was before the
Senate three times reported upon by the Military
Committee, and it was only delayed by an amend-
ment offered by the Senator from Kentucky, [Mr.
Powell;] but I presume there will now be no dis-
cussion and no delay.
Mr. DAVIS. I hope the Senator from Missouri
will withdraw his motion until I can make a re-
port. It will take but a minute.
Mr. WILSON, of Missouri. I am exceedingly
anxious, I will state to the Senator from Kentucky,
to get this resolution passed. The soldiers in Mis-
souri have been kept out of their pay for some
eighteen months in consequence of the delay in
the passage of this resolution. I should be ex-
ceedingly glad to oblige the Senator under any
other circumstances.
Mr. DAVIS. That is exactly the condition of
my State. ^
The motion was agreed to; and the Senate, as
in Committee oftne Whole, resumed the consider-
ation of the joint resolution (II. R. No. 118) to
revive an act to secure to the officers and men
actually employed in the Western (h'pr.rtment, or
department of Missouri, their pay, bounty, and
pension, and for other purposes.
