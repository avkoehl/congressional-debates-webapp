Major-General FRANKLIN,

New Iberia:

GENERAL: I congratulate you heartily of the success of this morning's work. A gentleman from Rapides Parish informs me that the whole force of enemy in Western Louisiana does not exceed 7,000 men. He thinks the movement made by Green across the Atchafalaya was necessary to the rebels, in order to raise the secessionists from the state of despair into which they were falling, and to gather up a few mules and conscripts. I am re-enforcing Plaquemine, however, to prevent chance of trouble below. I have received intelligence that Corpus Christi is in the commanding general's possession. No particulars.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

CHAS. P. STONE,

Brigadier-General, and Chief of Staff.

Colonel FISKE,

Donaldsonville:

COLONEL: Two batteries have left this for Donaldsonville, one at 10 a. m., the other at noon. I have receive no report from you to-day. If the same state of affairs as last reported still exists above you, Colonel Sheldon will, on the arrival of the batteries, embark his infantry on the steamers conveying them, and proceed without delay to Plaquemine, where he will disembark his infantry and the two batteries, and take such measures for securing that section of country as may be deemed by him necessary. You will please acknowledge receipt of this dispatch, and report by telegraph once in three hours until further orders.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

CHAS. P. STONE,

Brigadier-General, and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS FIRST DIVISION, ARMY OF TEXAS,Corpus Christie, Tex., November 21, 1863.

Commanding Officer of the U. S. Land or Naval Forces, Aransas Pass:

SIR: In response to the appeals made to me by the families of the soldiers of this army stationed on Mustang Island, I have the honor to send Lieutenant Walter L. Mann, acting assistant adjutant-general of this division, under a flag of truce, with this communication.

In the name of humanity, I ask that you will inform me of the fate of those soldiers, that the families may be relieved from this state of suspense.

A flag-of-truce boat sent down by Colonel [A. M.] Hobby, of this command, before my arrival, has not returned; it was borne by Acting Sailing Master Neal; information as to its whereabouts is requested.

I have the honor to be, with great respect, your obedient servant,
