that all contracts for hogs or cattle made with the agents of the Confederate Government shall be complied with, and have dispatched several armed parties to see that it is properly executed.

There are 1,140 sacks of salt here. I have directed 400 sacks should be delivered to D. Morris &amp; Co. and 400 sacks to Wilson & Johnson. This is sufficient to meet their present wants, and the balance will be returned, to meet such other demands as may arise. I will report to you again soon.

With high respect, your obedient servant,

WM. H. CARROLL,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

COLUMBUS, November 26, 1861.

W. W. MACKALL:

In reply to telegram as to General Pillow's signature to his letters, I have to say that since the accident to the gun my head has been in such a state I could not attend to duty, and General Pillow was placed in command; that, too, has been reason for not sending report of the battle. My report goes forward to-morrow, and I hope to resume command in a day or two.

General A. SIDNEY JOHNSTON:

The President desires you to suspend your order to muster out of service the twelve months' unarmed Mississippi troops until Mr. E. L. Acee, of Mississippi, can have a little time to collect and arm a portion of them. Mr. Acee leaves here to-day for Mississippi for this purpose.
