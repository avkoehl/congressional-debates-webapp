As the resolution fixes definitely the dates within which the correspondence is desired, I have not deemed it proper to add anything which was prior or subsequent to those dates.

JEFFERSON DAVIS.

[Inclosures.]

RICHMOND, VA., May 6, 1863.

General JOSEPH E. Johnston,

Tullahoma, Tenn.:

How and why was Brigadier-General [W. T.] Martin withdrawn from Mississippi for service with the cavalry of which he was appointed?

JEFFERSON DAVIS.

TULLAHOMA, TENN., May 7, 1863.

His Excellency the PRESIDENT:

Brigadier-General Martin was assigned to Van Dorn's cavalry, which was ordered to this department in January. He is not now with Van Dorn, who is in front of Columbia. He commands the cavalry directly between this army and Murfreesborough.

J. E. Johnston.

RICHMOND, VA., May 18, 1863.

General JOSEPH E. Johnston,

Headquarters, via Jackson, MISS.:

Have seen your dispatch of this date. The cavalry mentioned cannot reach you before weeks. Other larger and more practiced cavalry I had hoped could be drawn to you from another part of your department, as suggested in telegram some time since. Several of the best infantry regiments, if wanted, might serve as substitute for the cavalry, so much and immediately required. I hope you will have larger accessions to your army, when advancing to attack, by the junction of militia and less organized bodies of citizens. Your presence will effect much to inspire confidence and activity.

The enemy will probably seek to join his fleet at Warrenton, draw the remaining forces from the camp above Young's Point, and prepare for land and water attack on the defenses of Vicksburg. If you could unite with Pemberton and attack the enemy in his retrograde movement toward the river, the chances would be much better. Every effort will be made to aid you, and I desire to know fully your wishes.

JEFFERSON DAVIS.

CANTON, MISS., May 21, 1863.

His Excellency the PRESIDENT:

There is a DIVISION without a major-general, the only officer competent to command it being General W. H. T. Walker; * he is the junior brigadier. Please appoint immediately. Another will be wanted for coming troops. I recommend Brigadier-General [C. M.] Wilcox. * These officers are indispensable.

J. E. Johnston.
