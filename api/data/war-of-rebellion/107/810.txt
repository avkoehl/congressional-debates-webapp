The wagons belonging to these divisions will precede or follow Ricketts' column, which will march by the same road to Cooksville. Owen's cavalry will precede the column which moves to Poplar Springs, and one troop of Harris Light Cavalry will follow each division as it marches to prevent straggling and depredations. The residue of this cavalry will follow up the rear of the corps. Major Houston will report to the headquarters of General Burnside for guides, and see that they are properly distributed; also to select and point out suitable encampments for the divisions of the corps.
