Major-General ORD,

Eighteenth Corps:

I have orders to send all the siege artillery and material at once to City Point. Have sent word, via General Butler's headquarters, to Colonel Abbot. Will you cause Colonel Piper to have the siege guns, mortars, and ammunition, &amp;c., got out and brought up to your headquarters as soon as possible and his means of transportation will permit? The teams of the field batteries could bring up the guns. No time to be lost. Please acknowledge receipt and let me know what you can do for me.
