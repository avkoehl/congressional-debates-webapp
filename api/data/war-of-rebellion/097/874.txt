HEADQUARTERS MIDDLE MILITARY DIVISION,April 20, 1865.

Brigadier-General WALLACE,

Baltimore:

GENERAL: Major-General Hancock directs me to say that Confederate officers and soldiers who surrendered to him before he received General Grant's instructions were not interfered with in their passage to their homes. General Hancock could not withdrawn the terms he had offered them. In house cases he will have to leave the matter to the authorities in the States to which they go.

Respectfully,

W. G. MITCHELL,

Brevet Colonel and Aide-de-Camp.

HARRISBURG, April 20, 1865.

(Received 1 p. m.)

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

I am as yet unadvised as to whether Mrs. Lincols will accompany the remains. In case she does, will you oblige men by presenting my condolences to her, and say that I will of course expect herself and family to make my house her home during her melancholy sojourn here. May I beg the favor of an answer?

A. G. CURTIN.

WAR DEPARTMENT,

Governor CURTIN,

Your kind and considerate message will be immediately communicated to Mrs. Lincoln. By present arrangements neither she nor her sons will accompany the funeral curettage, she being unable to travel at present.
