HEADQUARTERS DEFENSES OF WASHINGTON,Washington, D. C., January 30, 1863.

General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief, U. S. Army, Washington, D. C.:

GENERAL: In relation to the exchange of the Pennsylvania Reserves for new regiments of the same State, from in and around Washington, I have the honor to state-

Aggregate present.

Under General Hays' command, One hundred

and fifty-first Pennsylvania..................... 825

Under Colonel Gibson's command, One hundred

and forty-third Pennsylvania...................... 779

Under General Martindale's command, Company B,

Twenty-sixth Pennsylvania......................... 79

Under General Martindale's command, Company F,

Twenty-seventh Pennsylvania....................... 80

Under General Martindale's command, One hundred

and thirty-fifth Pennsylvania.................... 834

Under General Martindale's command, One hundred

and forty-ninth Pennsylvania...................... 913

Under General Martindale's command, One hundred

and fiftieth Pennsylvania......................... 684

-----

Total............................................. 4,194 Present sick...................................... 481

3,713

Two of the companies (B, Twenty-sixth, and F, Twenty-seventh Pennsylvania Volunteers) belong to regiments now with the Army of the Potomac, with an aggregate of 175 men.

To make this change, it will be necessary to break up the division of Pennsylvania Reserves, as one regiment is in the front on the south side of the river, another on this side, and the remainder, under General Martindale, in the city.

One great objection to this change is that some of the companies are commanded by sergeants and corporals. As most of the regiments are doing provost duty in the city, this is a most serous objection. Those are the only regiments I have from this State, and I fear that the exchange cannot be made with any benefit to the service in my command.

I have the honor to be, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. P. HEINTZELMAN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,Camp near Falmouth, Va., January 30, 1863.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Commander-in-Chief:

By General Orders, Numbers 61, War Department, 1862, leaves of absence cannot be granted in the field, except to prevent death or permanent disability. This rule never has been strictly regarded in this army. It is understood that the Adjutant-General gave a construction of this order to General Burnside that permitted leaves for a short period. The order organizing grand divisions gave to the grand division commanders the authority usually exercised by the general commanding the army. Grand division commanders had no uniformity of action in the premises, and I have thought proper to issue the inclosed order. I believe by it much desertion will be stopped, and a more contented
