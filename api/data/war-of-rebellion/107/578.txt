HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, Camp Winfield Scott, April 18, 1862-11.30 p. M.

His Excellency A. LINCOLN,President:

If compatible with your impressions as to the security of the capital, and not interfering with operations of which I am ignorant, I would be glat to have McCall's division so as to be enabled to make a strong attack upon West Point to turn position of the enemy. After all that I have heard of things which have occurred since I left Washington and before, I would prefer that General McDowell should not again be assigned to duty with me.

G. M. McCLELLAN,

Major-General, commanding.
