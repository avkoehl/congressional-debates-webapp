in the State of Indiana, and until the services re-
quired of said commissioners shall have been fully
performed. The Secretary of the Interior and
the Commissioner of the General Land Office have
both been consulted upon the subject, and they
recommend the passage of the bill. I hope that f
may have the unanimous consent of the House to
take the bill from the table, with a view to its
passage.
Mr. WALSH. Does the gentleman make the
motion for the purpose of referring merely, or
does he intend to put it upon its passage?
The SPEAKER. The gentleman desires to
put it upon its passage.
Mr. WALSH. 1 object.
Mr. MILLER,. 1 hope the objection will be
withdrawn. It is very important that this bill
should be passed now. The offices for adjusting
land titles will be kept open only for a short time
in Vintennes, and just as soon as the commission
shaii expire, the papers and records will be re-
turned to Indianapolis, the proper place.
Mr. WALSH. Well, by the general kindness
of my disposition I am induced to withdraw my
objection.
The bill was then ordered to be read a third
time; and having been read a third time, it was
BOOKS, ETC., OF MEMBERS.
Mr. STANTON, of Kentucky. I am instructed
by the Committee on Printing to submit the reso-
lution which I send to the Chair.
The resolution was read, as follows:
Resolvedy That the Superintendent of Public Printing be
directed to send to the members of the present House of
Representatives, at their homes, such of the books and
documents ordeied by the present Congress as ihey are
respectively entitled to, and wlnrh they may not receive
.before the adjournment, unless otherwise ordered by indi-
vidual members.
Mr. HAVEN. I have no objection in the
world to the House passing that resolution, but
it seems to me it is cutting rather shoit at both
ends; for this House, within thirty dsys after its
meeting, confiscated the documents belonging to
the last House, and now they are going to hold
on to their own. [Laughter.] Still, I do not ob-
ject to its being passed.
The resolution was then adopted.
Mr. STANTON, of Kentucky, moved to re-
consider the vote by which the resolution was
adopted, and to lay the motion to reconsider on
the table; which latter motion was agreed to.
BILL REPORTED.
Mr. READY, from the Committee of Claims,
by unanimous consent, reported the following
bill; which was read a first and second time by its
title, referred to a Committee of the Whole House,
made the order of the day for to-morrow, and or-
dered to be printed:
A bill for the relief of the heirs of Dr. Absalom
Baiid, late a surgeon in the army of the Revolu-
tion.
On motion by Mr. MACDONALD, the House
then, at three o'clock and forty-five minutes, ad-
journed until to-morrow at twelve o'clock, m.
IN SENATE.
Saturday, February 10, 1855.
Prayer by Rev. Henry Slicer.
The Journal of yesterday was read and approved.
CREDENTIALS.
Mr. SUMNER presented the credentials of
Hon. Henry Wilson, chosen by the Legislature
of Massachusetts, a Senator from that State for
the unexpired term of Hon. Edward Everett,
resigned.
The credentials were read, and the oath pre-
scribed by law having been administered to Mr.
Wilson, he took his seat in the Senate.
BOUNTY LAND FOR INDIANS.
Mr. BROWN. I ask the unanimous consent
of the Senate to take up, at this time, a joint reso-
lution from the House of Representatives which
42
was referred to the Committee on Indian Affairs,
and favorably reported on some time ago. The
committee reported a substitute for it which ought
to be passed now, or I fear it will inevitably be
lost. It is a proposition to which the Senate has
two or three times agreed, and it cannot take up
much time.
There being no objection, the Senate, as in Com-
mittee of the Whole, proceeded to consider the
joint resolution of the House of Representatives,
" declaring the Seneca Indians entitled to pension
and bounty lands in certain cases." As it was
passed by the House, it proposed that the pension
and bounty lands laws should not be so construed
as to exclude trom their benefits Seneca Indians
who served in the war of 1812, when, by the terms
of the laws, Indians were notexceptstl or excluded.
The Committee on Indian Affairs reported it
with an amendment to strike out all after the enact-
ing clause, and insert the following as a substitute:
Tluit Use nets licietoibie parted by Congress, granting
bouiitu's in lamlc! (o pet bond engaged m llie mil st a y service
at the United Â£5talcs 111 umy ot war, be so construed as to
include Choctaw and other Indians, in the same manner,
ami to tin; same extent, as il the said Indians had been
white men.
Mr. BROWN. I do not wish to debate this
question; but 1 desire to call the attention of the
Senate to the lact that the Committee on Indian
I AtiUirs propose to strike out all of the joint reso-
I lutton which 1 elates to pensions, and to confine it
i simply to bounty lands m the same manner as was
! piovided by the general bill which we have passed
uuring the present session. As there is no proba-
bility of that geneial bill being passed by the
House during this session, we propose to amend
this joint resolution, and to send it to the House
for their acuuu.
The amendment was agreed to, and the joint
resolution was reported to the Senate as amended .
The amendment was concurred in and ordered
to be engrossed, and the joint resolution to be read
' a third time. The joint resolution, as amended,
was read the third time and passed, and its title
wasamended so as to read: " A joint resolution to
extend the benefits of the bounty land laws of the
United States to Choctaw and other Indians who
have served m the Army ot the United States 111
time of war."

subject of our naturalization laws is one which is
attracting great attention at this time, I think there
can be no reasonable objection to printing that
number of copies of these joint resolutions. I
make that motion.
