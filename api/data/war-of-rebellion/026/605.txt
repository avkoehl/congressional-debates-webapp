NORFOLK, April 13, 1863.

Acting Rear-Admiral LEE:

Another request has come for a gunboat off Williamsburg. The tower of the asylum is visible from the river; over line 1 1\2 miles below that tower and the enemy's camp is above. I earnestly trust a gunboat may be sent up immediately if one has not gone.

E. D. KEYES,

Major-General.

UNITED STATES FLAG-SHIP MINNESOTA, April 13, 1863.

Major-General KEYES,

Commanding Department:

Your two dispatches are received. I have no gunboats suitable to send off Williamsburg, and it would not be fit to send only one gunboat there if I had it.

S. P. LEE,

Acting Rear-Admiral.

SUFFOLK, VA., April 13, 1863-3.30 p.m . (Received 4.20 p.m .)

Major-General HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

Reliable information from intelligent deserters is to effect that the enemy have 35,000 or 40,000 in our front, which have come from Fredericksburg, the condition of the roads rendering an attack there impossible. It is stated that D. H. Hill is advancing from North Carolina.

JOHN J. PECK,

Major-General.

FORT MONROE, VA., April 13, 1863-8.30 p .m. (Received 10 p. m._

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

Longstreet's advance division arrived in my front on Saturday and was followed by Pickett's, Hood's, and Anderson's yesterday. They advanced on my front and right flank about noon on the 12th, within extreme artillery range, and after much skirmishing fell back several miles. Early this morning they advanced on my front and rear with one division on the right flank. More or less artillery fire all day and much skirmishing. Colonel Foster's Light Troops handled the enemy's advance roughly, driving them back and retiring the picket line at dark. Anderson's division has been engaged on the water front with our gunboats and batteries. The firing has been brisk, and the enemy suffered. The command is in good spirits and will do its duty.

JOHN J. PECK,

Major-General.
