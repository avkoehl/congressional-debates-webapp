HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,June 26, 1863-&amp; p. m. (received 7. 30 p. m.)

Major-General HALLECK:

Is there any reason why Maryland Heights should not be abandoned after the public stores and property are removed? I propose to visit the place to-morrow, on my way to Frederick, to satisfy myself on that point. It must be borne in mind that I am here with a force inferior in numbers to that of the enemy, and must have every available man to use on the field.

JOSEPH HOOKER,

Major-General, Commanding.

June 26, 1863-8 p. m. (Received 9. 15 p. m.)

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

I would respectfully request that Major-General Stahel may be ordered by telegraph to report to General Couch, with a view to organizing and putting in an efficient condition any mounted troops that can be raised for service there. His presence here as senior major-general will much embarrass me and retard my movements.

JOSEPH HOOKER,

Major-General.

POOLESVILLE, June 26, 1863-6 p. m.

Major T. T. ECKERT:

Dispatch* received. My compliments to the President, and inform him that I had not that honor.

JOSEPH HOOKER,

Major-General.

June 26, 1863-8 p. m. (Received 9. 10 p. m.)

His Excellency President LINCOLN:

You need not believe any more than you choose of what is published in the Associated Press dispatches concerning this army tomorrow. Was it from the newspapers that you received a report, or an idea, that I was in Washington last night?

JOSEPH HOOKER,

Major-General.

WASHINGTON, June 27, 1863-8 a. m.

Major-General HOOKER:

It did not come from the newspapers, nor did I believe it, but I wished to be entirely sure it was a falsehood.

A. LINCOLN
