FRANK ENO,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

Colonel J. T. K. HAYWARD,

Hannibal, Mo.:

Can you name the best militia company in Ralls County to be called into service for the summer? I am going to send an officer to Hannibal who will wage a war of sure and swift destruction against the murdering, thieving gang of villains that are now at work in Pike and neighboring counties. Shooting on the spot will be the rule.

CLINTON B. FISK,

Brigadier-General.

(Received 3.15 a.m., June 1.)

Honorable E. M. STANTON:

Dispatch received. I have reason to thank you for usual very prompt and generous replies to my dispatches. I called attention to that of the 9th, which I supposed lost in the tumult of battle, then before you. Governor Carney's request would only well supply the 1,000 arms you authorize me to issue. I respectfully suggest and ask that I have power to approve his requisition to supply 40 rounds to militia enrolled, armed, and ready to turn out. Marmaduke is reported on this side of the Arkansas, and if he comes this way I must depend mainly on militia, as he has 5,000 or 6,000 men and six pieces of artillery. I will do all I can to save you trouble and avoid accidents in that quarter, while you have so much more important matter before you.

S. R. CURTIS.

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF KANSAS.

Fort Leavenworth, May 31, 1864

His Excellency Governor THOMAS CARNEY,

Leavenworth City:

Yours of yesterday, asking me to turn over 1,000 stand of arms with the necessary ammunition, was duly received, and in conformity
