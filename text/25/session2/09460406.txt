Mr Chairman, I have aK> charged thi&scheme,
of bumndering the revenues to the use and em- !
ploy men* of the banks, with contradicting the set-
tled doctrines of political economy, and grossly
mistaking the nature and effect oí taxation and
pdbhc expenditure On this branch of the subject

rences to authors of established reputation, and

On the subject oí public expenditure, of con-
sumption by Government, I will lake the liberty of
reading from Say's Political Economy the following

"There has long been a prevale it notion, that the values

in some shape or other, in the vulgar phiase, that what Govern

ture Thi-3 is a gross fallacy, but one that has been produc
uve of infinite mischief, inasmuch as it has been the pretext for a
cii.it deal of shameless wane and dilapidation The value
paid to Government by the tax payer, is given without equiva
lent or return, it i& expended by the Govern nen^p the purchase
of personal service of objtcts of consumption, 11 one word, of

' Dr Hamilton, in his valuable tract upon "The National

In relation to the character and effect of taxa-
tion, I ask indulgence whilst I read a few selected
sentences from the same author
' Taxation is the transfer of a poition of the national products
from the hands of individuals to those of the Government, for
the purpose of meeting the public consumption oi expenditure
Whate^ er be th° denomination it be in—whe*hei tax, contnbu
tion, uuty, excise, custom, aid, subsidy, erant, oi free gift -it is
virtually a buiden nnpubtd upon índiv iduals, eithei m a oepa
ratp or m a coiporate character, by the ruling powei for the
time being, for the purpose of supi.lv ig the consumption it
may think proper to make at their expense, m short, an impost,
in the literal sense
"It would he foieign to the plan of this woik to inquire m
whom the right of taxation is, or ousht to be vested    In the
science of political economy, taxation must bt, considered as
ma  ei of fia and not of right   and nothing 'níher it to be
regaided than its  nttuie, the source whe ic« it demes the
j   values it absorbs, an Í its eilects upon national and individual
!   interest*    The piovince of this, science extends no further

j   value of the cjmm >' ty given by the tax pajer to the tax
I   gatheier.   It being p ill in silvei   in goods mm per onal sei
vice, is a mere accit   ntal circumstance, which may De more
or less advantageous to the subject or to the soveiei^n    The
ts ential point is the valueof the silver the goods or the service
The moment that value is paited w ih by the tax payer it
HJpoaitively lest to him   the mom en it is consume 1 by the Go
vernment or its agents, it is lost to all the wond  and never re
verts to, or re exists in, society    T us, I anprehend, has been
already demonstrated when the  general  effect of public con
sumptioi was under consideiation    It was then shown that
however the money Tevied by taxation maj be refunded to the
nanon  its valí e never is refunded becauseit a never leturned
gtatuitously, or refunded hy the public funcionarles  without
receiving an equivalent in the way of barter or exchange
' The same causes we have found to make unproductive con
sumption nowise ftvorible to reproduction, prevent taxat on
from at all promoti ig it Taxation deprives the producer of a
p odua wmchhe would otherwise have the o} tion of deriving
a peisonalgiatifuationfum, il consumedunpi lacuvely, ot of
turning to profit if he pieferred to devota it to an useful cm
ployment Onepio' ict is a means of idioms? another and
therefoie, the subtraction of a pioduct mast needs dimmish, in
t ^ of augmenting, productive power

pi ice mere exertion cannot alone pioduce there must be capí
ta' forittowor,k upon, and capital is but an accumulation of
t íe very products that taxation takes fiom the subject, that in
thesecond place it is evident that the values which industiy
creates expressly to satisfy the demands of taxation, aie no in
cieaseof wealth, for they aie seized on, and devomedbv, tax
ation It is a glaring absurdity to pretend that taxation contri
butes to national wealth, by engrossing pirt of the national pro
duce, and enriches the nation hy consuming part of its wealth
Indeed, it wo dd be trifling with my readers' time to notice such
a fallacy, did not most Governments act upou this principle,
and had not well mtentioned and scientific writers endeavored to
support and establish it "
The opportunity afforded the banks, the permis-
sion and encouragement to them, to employ the re-
venue m trade and business, its conversion, in
fact, after collection, into banking capital, as the
basis not only of commercial, but of various other
operations, is a palpable violation of these plain
and simple truths.   The introduction of a system
and tel! him he did him no fnjuiy, for the money, or part of it,
would bt employed  n purchasing t <e commodities he^Jtaltin,
upon which he would receive a profi " The encouragement
afforded by the public expenditure is precisely analogous
founded upon the hypothesis that that value which
is consumed by Government is stilt id. existence,
and capable of profitable employment and repro-
duction,  is an absurdity and a delusion little less
extravagant than would be the idea, m a treatise on
population, that the extinguishment of life u  not a
destruction of human existence—a subtraction from
the numerical aggregate.    It may be urged that the
visible growth and prosperity  of the country, the
acknowledged augmentation of the grand total of
national vvealih, refutes the opinion that taxation
and expendituie are an absolute destruction of so
much value or wealth     Such reasoning is about
as convincing   such logic is as conclusive as to
maintain that the continued increase of population
the constant and invariable addition lo the aggre-
gate number m a country, by natural means, proves
that no  death has ever occurred.   It  is passing
strange that a fallacy so absurd, a delusion so im-
plausible, should be attempted upon the credulity
of a whole nation.    And what are the necessary
consequences,  the  unavoidable mischiefs,  of this
scheme of deception and folly'   The employment
of the revenue in business and  trade inevitably
tends continually to  the creation  of an unnatural
condition  of things,  tends incessantly to disturb
and derange the regular and ordinary course of
business transactions,  and  tends  to   produce an
artificial and deceitful relation between the trade
of the country, and the capital actually applicable
to that trade    In  the intervening t me, between
collection and consumption, the revenue is stimu-
lated into active employment, it becomes a moving
cause m business and speculation; it is regarded
and consideied as the basis upon which may safely
rest extended additional operations.    Whenever
the revenue, thus enticed or forced by the action
of Government into busy employment, is with-
drawn, as it must be necessarily at some time, the 
the public expenditure is a  destruction, to thai
extent, of so much capital.   The capital being
gradually withdrawn to supply the wants of the
Government, m the same ratio, and even m a
much greater, must business   be affected.   Not
only the amount of business resting on th*s capital,
artificially multiplied, must cease and perish, but the
tumbling of the superstructure, thus erected, must
shake and convulse all others in anyway connected
with it, and must produce panic and alarm through-
out the country.   But the accruing revenue, in order
to prevent these, otherwise certain and disastrous,
consequences, mu^t be made to supply the defi-
ciency created, must be made to fill up the chasm.
Thus we have disclosed and avowed the startling,
the odious doctrine, that besides the mere support
oí Government, the object and purpose of taxation
is to contribute to tne increase, or certainly to pre-
vent a diminution of that amount of capital em-
ployed by bank agencies    The pr .iciple of trans-
ferring wealth oi value, by  force of legislation,
from one ciass or portion of society to another,
under whatever pretaxt of public utility, is a prin-
ciple of plunder and robbery    It is taking the pro-
perty of A, depriving him of the use, increase, and
profit, and giving it 10 B, because he will, m the
estimation oí the Legislature, vest and employ it
more beneficially for the " general welfare."   It
is as clear as the ^un in the firmament on a cloud-
less  day, that this  un1nncipled and  unconstitu-
tional connection between the banks and the Go-
vernment operates as an unmitigated stimulant to
superfluous, excessive, tyrannical, and unconstitu-
tional taxation—to taxation greatly surpassing the
amount required for proper and economical expen-
diture.
But suppose, admit, that this licensed and ap-
proved conversion of revenue into bank capUal does
essentially assist m augmenting the aggregate
wealth ot the nation to an extent not otherwise at-
tained. The admission of such a fact would be
no refutation oj the charge of injustice, partiality,
and tyranny, urged against the system; and would,
by no means, prove that such a system operated
equally m improving the condition and multiplying
the general comforts of society—that its tendency
wat. the production of "the greater good for the
greater number "
Take, for example, a small community of one
hundred persons, whose total production of value,
©r increase of wealth, is ten ifeousand dollars.
