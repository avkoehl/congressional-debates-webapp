to credence. That also states that an infantry force has ordered Clinch. This also needs confirmation. I will this to General Willcox. General Cox has arrived, and takes command of the

Twenty-third Corps.

BLAIN'S CROSS-ROADS, December 22, 1863-8 p.m.

Nothing new has transpired to-day. The enemy's position remains about the [same.] The signal officer thinks the fires have somewhat increased in the direction of Buffalo Creek. The enemy picket Powder Spring Gap and other points on Clinch Mountain. Parties sent on the north side of the mountains to gain heights as lookout returned unsuccessful, the enemy seeming to watch the position closely. In reference to General Manson, General Cox informed me this morning that he had gone to Knoxville to arrange some papers appertaining to corps headquarters. I was told last night he was going, but presumed he would get permission before leaving. I find it difficult to get any information in reference to action or movements of enemy beyond line of Bean's Station and Morristown. It is very important to know how far this side of Bristol the railroad is in running order. Cannot this information be acquired by parties sent from Knoxville?

HEADQUARTERS, Blain's Cross-Roads, December 23, 1863-2 p.m.

(Received 25th.)

About midnight last night I was informed by a scout that the cavalry on Buffalo Creek were saddled up and moving either across the river or up the river road. I sent this at once to General Sturgis, who had informed me of his move, and suggested a demonstration up the Rutledge road. I ordered Colonel Capron to send this morning a scouting party up Flat Creek to Powder Spring Gap, General Potter to make a reconnaissance up the Rutledge road, and General Spears up the river road. I have not heard from Capron or Spears. General Potter's advance is about 6 or 7 miles up the valley, and report no enemy in sight, and that the cavalry has crossed the river. A negro has just come in; says he left Bean's Station last night; that the cavalry was all moving; also that the infantry had gone; but on this point he was not clear. I have just received the accompanying dispatches* from General Willcox.

Our cavalry movements have evidently produced a commotion in the enemy's camp. I except soon to hear from some of our own scouts in reference to the movements and position of the enemy's infantry.
