HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF SOUTHWEST MISSOURI,Springfield, Mo., January 26, 1864.

Captain CAMERON,

Commanding Cassville, Mo.:

Is there anything new since last evening from the field? Two hundred men and one section of artillery were started to Cassville during the night, some of which will arrive by 9 a. m. to-day. Captain Ritchey's company and one other were ordered from Newtonian to Keatsville two days ago. Detain these two companies at Cassville until further orders. If they have arrived at Keatsville or are on the way there, order them to Cassville. How many men has Captain Duff at Berryville? If he is not strong enough to hold his position, let him fall back slowly. How are the fords? If things continue to look the same, I think I will come to Cassville to-night. Answer. The forces arriving at Cassville should be sent forward to Berryville as soon as possible, or in that direction.

Captain CAMERON,

Commanding, Cassville, Mo.:

The troops arriving at Cassville need to feed and rest a little. General Holland will leave here at 1 o'clock and come directly through. Troops need not be moved unless there is an emergency till he arrives. Gather all the information you can for him. I send him instead of coming myself, because he is acquainted with all the roads and country. A sufficient force will be kept at Cassville to hold the place.
