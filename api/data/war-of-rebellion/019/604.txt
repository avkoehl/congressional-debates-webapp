I am informed that there are at Jefferson City about 1,000 stand of arms which can be made serviceable by slight repairs.

You will doubtless find it convenient to establish your headquarters at Jefferson City as the most suitable place, but this will of course be at your discretion.

I rely upon you, general, to carry out these general suggestions as far as may be in your power, leaving to your own judgment the choice of details.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Brigadier-General.

SPRINGFIELD, August 28, 1862.

Brigadier General JOHN M. SCHOFIELD, Commanding:

Colonel Wright writes from Mount Vernon, 8 this morning, that intelligence had reached him that 2,000 of Rains' forces had arrived at Sarcoxie. Reconnoitering party sent in that direction and scout toward Cassville. If only 2,000, Wright will strike them vigorously. Every hour and every report which reaches me satisfies me that the combined forces of the enemy are to return into Missouri and that quickly too.

The above report from Colonel Wright, just received, is but an additional proof of the intention of the rebels. They are already making their initiatory demonstrations. I shall order Wright to hit the column above reported if he feels strong enough, and to fall back if he does not feel secure in so doing. Hurry forward re-enforcements, I most respectfully urge. Clouds overhead now.

JAS. TOTTEN,

Brigadier-General.

SAINT LOUIS, MO., Augusta 28, 1862.

General TOTTEN:

I shall be able to send you large infantry re-enforcements soon, though we are much delayed for arms and quartermaster stores. The regiments will begin to go forward in a few days. I will also send you cavalry from the Central Division as fast as it can be spared, and will have it all in condition to move rapidly to Springfield should you be threatened. There are also some indications of an advance on Rolla, on which account I must keep troops within reach of that place. Get accurate information if possible, so that I may judge of the time when re-enforcements will actually be needed, as well as the amount.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Brigadier-General.

SAINT LOUIS, MO., August 28, 1862.

General MERRILL:

Colonel Krekel, at Hermann, reports Cobb, with 1,000 men, trying to cross the river at Portland. Krekel will rally his militia and prevent his crossing. Can you do anything to bag him?

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Brigadier-General.
