HEADQUARTERS TENTH ARMY CORPS,September 20, 1864

Brigadier-General WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

My line has been very quiet; nothing of interest, except the opening of the Brooke gun. I will withdraw to-night a portion of my center to the new line in rear, which is completed that far, still holding the advance line. The work on second line is progressing rapidly, and I think a week will complete the redoubts.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: I yesterday examined the position of the large gun, apparently a columbiad, recently placed in position by the enemy about 1,600 yards northwesterly from Fort Morton. It is west of the railroad cut, about opposite Fort Haskell, from which it is hidden by a wood. Fort Morton can bring four guns to bear upon it, and I have directed the two siege guns now there, and two others transferred from Battery 17, near the Avery house, with the 10-inch mortars, to be opened upon it whenever it fires. In the meantime measures are being taken to determine accurately the bearing and distance from the 8-inch mortars near Forts Haskell and Stedman that a heavy fire may be concentrated upon it.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

HENRY J. HUNT,

Brigadier-General and Chief of Artillery.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
