SIGNAL STATION, May 10, 1864-7.30 a.m.

General HANCOCK:

From a tree-top near the bridge I observed a short section of a line of breast-works, filled with enemy's infantry. The line is apparently perpendicular to the road on which your headquarters now are-the road leading to the bridge and to the right of it.

P. A. TAYLOR,

Captain and Signal Officer.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, May 10, 1864-10 a.m.

Major-General HANCOCK:

You will immediately transfer two divisions of your corps to General Warren's position, and make arrangements, in conjunction with the Fifth Corps, to make a vigorous attack on the enemy's line punctually at 5 p.m. General Warren's instructions are herewith sent to you.* The remaining divisions will be so disposed as to keep up your present threatening attitude on the enemy's left, but so that it can be withdrawn promptly to your support, if necessary.

GEO. G. MEADE,Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, May 10, 1864-3.30 p.m.

Major-General HANCOCK,

Commanding Second Corps:

The opportunity for attack immediately is reported to be so favorable by General Warren that he is ordered to attack at once, and Gibbon is directed to co-operate with him. Wright is ordered to be ready to attack at once, if necessary, or to send support to Warren in an emergency. As soon as Barlow is secure, let Birney return.

By command:

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, May 10, 1864-4 p.m.

[General HANCOCK:]

I have ordered Warren to attack at once, and use Gibbon. Send Birney back if you don't want him, or,if not too late, attack with Birney and Barlow. Let me know at once what you do, and hurry Birney back as soon as possible if not wanted.

GEO. G. MEADE,Major-General.
