GENERAL: Major-General Howard directs me to say that upon reflection he does not deem it advisable to destroy the rails upon the road a required in the other to-day, provided you can procure cars with which to take them down to Pocotaligo and there pile them up for future use. Should you be unable, however, to get the cars, you will please go on and destroy the road as indicated in the order.

I have the honor to be, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Captain S. L. TAGGART,

Asst. Adjt. General, Dept. and Army of the Tennessee:

CAPTAIN: I need my pioneers at this point very much for repairing roads, building works, &amp;c. They can be much better cared for and worked to better advantage than where they now are. Besides, I hear that recruiting agents from the States are tampering with them at every opportunity and persuading them to desert. I desire to have the organization near enough to me to be able to make an example of any of these gentlemen I might chance to catch enticing my men away.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

F. P. BLAIR, JR.,

Major-General.
