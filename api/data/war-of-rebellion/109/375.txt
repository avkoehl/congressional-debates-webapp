HEADQUARTERS TWENTY-FIRST ARMY CORPS,Hollow Springs, Tenn., June 26, 1863-8.10 a. m.

Brigadier-General WOOD,

Commanding First Division, Twenty-first Army Corps:

GENERAL: Use every effort to arrive here at 12 m. or sooner. Palmer's train [will arrive] before that hour, and the general, commanding purposes moving forward so soon as your troops arrive here, as he is ordered to occupy Manchester and the crossing of Duck River to-night. Your train probably will be left to come on, in which event you must leave a strong guard with both for protection, and to help it up the hill. Not one word of news. General Thomas is moving on Manchester by Beech Grove.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

P. P. OLDERSHAW,

Captain and Assistant Adjutant-General.

HEADQUARTERS TWENTY-FIRST ARMY CORPS,Hollow Springs, Twenty-first Army Corps:

GENERAL: Yours of 9 a. m. is received. The general is using every possible exertion to clear the road for your command. He has no disposition whatever to move without your entire command, but should it become necessary, to do so, he will give you timely notice, so that you may arrange for the security of your train, &amp;c., and move up, say two-thirds of your infantry to march with him. General Turchin left at 9 a. m. with his cavalry to reconnoiter all the roads beyond Lumley's Stand, and if possible to communicate with General Thomas, who is reported from department headquarters as marching to-day on Beech Grove road to Manchester. General Rosecrans' quarters to-night, as to day, at Bech Grove. Beyond this we have not one atom of news.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

P. P. OLDERSHAW,

Captain and Assistant Adjutant-General.

GARRISON FORK, TENN., June 27, 1863.

Brigadier-General GARFIELD:

General Sheridans' division will be ready to move on in a little while- say an hour. I heard General Rosecrans sent a dispatch to General Thomas asking him whether a brigade or a division should go to Fairfield. I will await your orders in regard to this matter, and Sheridan will not move until I receive them. The rest of my corps will be concentrated here, washed and fed, and will be ready for work. I send this letter to keep up the correspondence and for the better information of all concerned.*

A. McD. McCOOK,

Major-General, Commanding.
