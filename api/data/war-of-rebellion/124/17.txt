Major THOMAS W. WINCENT,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Washington:

SIR: I telegraphed yesterday to the Honorable Secretary of War, requesting a notice to be sent to the Associated Press. I have to-day received his disapproval of the same.

I have found that in the preliminary arrangements which I have been making to execute his orders it is very desirable that I should be accredited before the public. I wish to prepare the public mind for the final development. It was therefor I wished some such publication. I can only to-day report progress.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

DANIEL ULLMANN,

Brigadier-General.
