Major-General MEADE:

General Griffin has advanced down the railroad and engaged the enemy's skirmishers there. General Crawford has engaged them on the right of General Crittenden. General Cutler and General Griffin are now establishing a good connection. General Wright, I believe, is moving up troops to Griffin's right. I suppose the enemy's skirmishers are probably a half mile in advance of their main one. As soon as all is in order we will drive them in to their breast-works if they have any, and ascertain their position. It seems as if the enemy was here in force.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.

quite to the railroad. His line can reach only to the rail-and he has told Wright so. Skirmishing in front, but only a waste of ammunition. Warren has sent to say so. We now move to the right. Warren's line is pretty oblique. He will try to rectify.

Lieutenant-Colonel, Volunteer Aide-de-Camp.
