RAPPAHANNOCK, August 1, 1863.

I sent a brigade to cross this morning at Beverly Ford; the river is swimming, and I could not cross. The engineers give me no cooperation. I cant cross in boats and drive away the rebels, after which, in the engineers are instructed to lay a brigade, I can cross and hold the opposite bank. If I am cross and hold the opposite bank. If I am to advance, I would like to see some disposition shown to aid me. Everything seems to be awaiting orders.

EAR WARREN: I suppose the brigade at Rappahanock Station will be thrown over as soon as the enemy is cleared away.

RAPPAHANNOCK STATION, August 1, 1863.

Have been driving Jones' and Hampton's brigades of cavalry all day. Have arrived within 1. 1/2 miles of Culpeper. Have found A. P. Hill's corps, and have to come back. I can't fight so many. There is no one else at Culpeper.
