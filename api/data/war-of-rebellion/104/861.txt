Major General J. H. WILSON:

The Georgia Railroad advertises that they shall, after to-morrow, refuse free passage of paroled prisoners on their way home. General Schofield's order only authorized me to give passage on military roads.

Major E. B. BEAUMONT:

I will march from here as soon as General Vogdes sends an officer to receive the public property now in my charge. The amount is much greater than I had anticipated, and the task assigned me here by the general I am satisfied is of greater magnitude than he supposed. Over 3,000 men and officers have already, been paroled and from 5,000 to 6,000 stand of arms received; twenty or thirty pieces of artillery and immense quantities of ammunition, sugar, sirup, bacon, &amp;c. I will transport all the bacon possible to Alabany, in order to ship to the command at Macon. I have ordered the cattle driven up, but fear they will be of no use to you.
