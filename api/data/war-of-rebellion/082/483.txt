HDQRS. FIRST BRIGADE, THIRD DIV., CAVALRY CORPS, July 26, 1864.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,Chief of Staff:

I have the honor to report that in obedience to orders I relieved at 1 a.m. to-day the First Brigade, First Division, Cavalry Corps, picketing on the left of the army, and to make the following report: I have taken up the picket-line as formerly established. That on my right is not as it should be, but I am taking steps to correct it. All is perfectly quiet, not a shot being fired. Patrols are moving on the old Norfolk road, and well down the plank road in, obedience to orders from headquarters Army of the Potomac, July 21, 1864.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. B. McINTOSH,

Colonel, Commanding Brigade.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, July 26, 1864-4.30 p.m.

Commanding OFFICER Brigadier CAVALRY PICKETING ON THE LEFT:

A deserter from Mahone's division, of Hill's corps, occupying the right of the enemy's intrenchments, has just come i and given information indicating an intention to feel and attack our left. The commanding general directs that you enjoin special vigilance on the part of your command and if forced to retire that you come in on the Norfolk road. Our intrenchments extend back from the last redoubt on the plank road across the Norfolk road to the swamp in that vicinity. You will keep the commander of the corps on the left, Major-General Warren, informed of everything that occurs, as well as these headquarters.

Lieutenant General U. S. GRANT,

City Point:

General Foster lost that cross-road on the lower side of Four-Mile Creek last night. He ascribes the loss to the bad behavior of the troops of the Nineteenth Corps which were on duty there. I ordered him to retake it if possible. It has not yet been accomplished.

BENJ. F. BUTLER.

Lieutenant General U. S. GRANT,

City Point:

General Foster has made a good step toward regaining that point. He will try and finish the job this p.m. As it is he is within a hundred yards of it and commands it.

Respectfully,

G. WEITZEL,

Brigadier-General and Acting Chief of Staff.
