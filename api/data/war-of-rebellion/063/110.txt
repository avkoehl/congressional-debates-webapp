them when they come in reach, and keep me fully advised of their reported movements. From the scarcity of forage, they will hardly be able to come up into Missouri for the present. You could not well quit your posts to re-enforce those in Arkansas, but look out for an opportunity to strike effectively, and then do it, no matter if it be in that State. You have plenty of force.

HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF SOUTHWEST MISSOURI,Springfield, Mo., April 9, 1864.

Colonel W. R. JUDSON,

Commanding District of Frontier, Fort Smith:

I cannot spare any troops from this district at present. I am still holding the Yellville Rolling Prairie region in Arkansas, and I will move some troops along toward Huntsville in a few days, two or three days, and assist you all that I can. My command has killed and captured about 100 in Arkansas within the past twelve days.

GENERAL: Can't you send your scouts in direction of Fayetteville? Colonel Harrison is pressed. I cannot relieve him, but will be able to in a few days.

W. R. JUDSON,

Colonel, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF SOUTHWEST MISSOURI,Springfield, Mo., April 9, 1864.

Colonel JUDSON,

Commanding District of Frontier, Fort Smith:

It is utterly impossible for me to relieve Colonel Harrison before Friday or Saturday next. I have no mounted men here and must send troops from Rolling Prairie and in vicinity. Colonel Phelps, of the Second Arkansas, has been ordered to his regiment to-morrow, and to make a movement that will create a diversion in favor of Fayetteville at once upon reaching his command. This is the best and all that I can do. Would not the enemy fall back if Harrison should attack?
