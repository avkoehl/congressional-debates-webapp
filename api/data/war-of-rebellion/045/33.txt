Colonel Voss, Twelfth Illinois Cavalry, did not receive any other order than one from Colonel Kilpatrick to join his division as soon as practicable; no time mentioned. He reports that with every effort he will not be able to have more than 120 men in serviceable condition by to-night. Do you wish the regiment sent to Bealeton, or have you any other orders for it?
