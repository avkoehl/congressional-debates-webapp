Major General N. P. BANKS,

Commanding Department of the Gulf:

GENERAL: Your dispatch of the 4th instant, announcing the occupation of Brazos Island, Tex., is received. In regard to re-enforcing you, I can only repeat what I have previously written. All drafted men are assigned to regiments from their own States. Orders were issued some time ago to fill up your regiments, as far as possible, from the States to which they belong. Some progress has been made in this, but it is slow work.

We cannot send you other regiments at present without taking them from other generals in the field, who are as urgent as yourself for re-enforcements. Moreover, it is thought that you army is sufficiently strong for that against which you are operating. The enemy can defeat you only by concentrating all his forces against your separate and isolated columns.

The concentration of rebel forces in Northern Georgia has compelled us to send there everything available.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.
