Major General S. A. HURLBUT,

Memphis, Tennessee:

One of Seventh Illinois escaped from Forrest at Somerville last night and arrived at Moscow this morning. Reports the enemy left Somerville just before he escaped and moved west. I have sent for the man and will get further information and let you know more.

Captain COKER,

Comdg. Camp Sixth Illinois Cavalry, Germantown:

You will mount all your men on mules, &amp;c., and keep patrols along Wolf River constantly. Notify Captain Glass at White's Station to do the same. Forrest is reported to have left Somerville last night, moving west. Be very vigilant day and night.

B. H. GRIERSON,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

MEMPHIS, December 27, 1863.

General GRIERSON:

Your will keep the trains for Morgan's force ready all the time, and the men constantly with two days' cooked rations. If you are satisfied that Forrest is at Somerville, all Wolf River crossing in rear of Germantown and Collierville should be picketed and spies sent on the creek as far as Green Bottom or Morning Sun. I do not believe he will try to cross Wolf and Coldwater both; if he does, he must be caught from La Grange. See that the bridge south of La Grange can be quickly repaired for cavalry. If Forrest has only two pieces of artillery, he has not been joined by Richardson yet, and may be waiting for him from Brownsville.

S. A. HURLBUT,

Major-General.

The following dispatch is just received from General Stevenson:

Your dispatches were delivered to General Mower. His command is near here, coming in. His quartermaster has already arrived. The train has been waiting on the track all night, and is still ready.

J. M. TUTTLE,

Brigadier-General.
