Deep Bottom. I wish to ask whether the commanding general would desire me to furnish whatever pontoon material I may have that may be asked for by General Butler or his chief engineer on some one general order that you may give me, or whether he would desire that I should inform him and get a special authority in each case.

H. W. BENHAM,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, July 22, 1864.

(Sent 12 m.)

Brigadier General H. W. BENHAM:

In reference to your dispatch respecting pontoons and bridge material, upon the requisition of General Butler, the commanding general desires you to furnish whatever is asked for, notifying him what you furnish. Please procure forty sets of hinges and hasps and padlocks for magazine doors. Please also prepare six canvas pontoons, with trucks, &amp;c., complete like the others, for the train with this army. The Cavalry Corps, instead of being supplied with twelve pontoons, have received eighteen pontoons, leaving us eighteen pontoons instead of twenty-four with the general train.

In reply to yours of to-day I would state that soon after sending my first to you to-day I received General Grant's order to furnish 600 feet of bridge on General Butler's requisition, and I have it now, thirty boats, awaiting a steamer. The canvas boats, trucks, magazine hinges, and other material desired I will at once order from Washington.
