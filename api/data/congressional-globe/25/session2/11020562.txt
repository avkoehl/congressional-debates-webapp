dictatoj         di have level attributed to him pi hate motives or

i 'lose v\ uli whom I am in habits of intimate friendship to say
u     aei Í am in the habit of indulging, even in private conver
siuon, in personalmve uve against him
Now, sir, as to the charge that I have changed my punci
p & Titif? has been the standing theme of my opponents ever
fcHice I i\*ri ired against the candidate of the Baltimore Conven
tion, bu 1 defy my colleague, 01 any other member of this
fíouse, or any man in the whole countiy, to point to any act, 01

ti > rue jonnals of this House contain the íecoid of my
votes, and numerous punted speeches may be referred to tu
to it i adía or confirm whatla^scrt I can confidently point to
the íecoid, and defy the severest scrutiny of my enemies to pro
duee the eviden e of any chanse of those political pnnciples
which I avowed and acted upon from the first moment I had the
honoi of a seat in this Hous,e to this good day The subject we
aienow discussing isdnectly connected with one of the most
exciting, and, in a lolmcal point of view, most perilous mea
smesoi policy adopted in the early pait of Geneial Fackson s
adminibiidtion I mean the policy ol Indian removal I gave
my zealous and hearty support to it m its origin, and at a time
when theie wasabaie majority in this Hou°c in us favoi
When have I, m any instance, failed still to give it my zealous
and faithful suppoi tin the seven or eight years of it* operation"*
I am at this moment giving it my support <u> zealously as in

This question was not even thought of, or, if thought of, was
never mei tioncd,or heeded before General Jackson wis ac

Iwve and uiustcver, spinig liom the connection of uchasub
l?ct with the confite t, of paity that I have Jong su e made up
my miridnevertn agiee to ameasure of the kind m opposition
to a powerful minority However strange it may appear to
«ome gentlemen, I will state this fui ther tact, that kpii dming
the canvass of last summer, and after the sentiment had become
almost univeisal in a laise portion of my district, that nothing
(7) T voted against the bill to lechaiter the L ited States
Bank in 1802, for the íeasonsstated in the speech I made upon
it atthe time, and which did not deny oither the c\¡ ediencv

1 protested against the nmovil of the deposite lot when
they were removed, although I did not def n I that uea
sure, I refused, under the circumstances, to vote foi heir its, o
ration.
but a Bank of the United States could remedy the disorders of
the currency andexchaages, and restore the piospenty of the
countt y, I repeatedly and openly declared to my constituents
that I would not dining the piesentCongiese, oi at any future
time, give n> vote in favor of a Bank of the United feteues as
long as a chaiter could only be carried bya merfc majority m
Congress, imlCbS I should be impeiatively instructed by them,
and when I declared the ceitam ^eVils of such a course, and
pointed out the fatal consequences of the piotiacted paity war
fare which might be expected togiowoutot it, and the ui cer
tarn i«sue of it, they had confidence enough in my judgmpnt,
and in the honesty of my mtentiors, to acquiesce in my course
I have now enumerated all the gieat and leading questions
which marked the early part of Geneial Tackson's adnumstia
tion In which of them have I faltered? ttfheie is the pvi
ctence of the change of which my colleague speaks? But my
colleague is not the only organ of this cha ge against me I
obseive that in a late biographical sketch of a distinguished m
dividual, [Mr Polk,] published m one of the peuodicalsof
the dav, which aspires to íe&pectabilitv, (the Democratic Re
viewj) the same base calumny is propagated m the most oflen
sive connection (8)
But my colleague inquires how it happened that 1 continued
to give my support to GeneralJackson & adnmnt-tiation dunng
so many >eais when the same abuses existed of which 1 now
complain   the same violations of the Consti utton, thesam^
extiavagance  m  the national e-ipendituies     My colleague
spoke particularly of the mciease in the expenditure-^ and af
firmed that I was a party to it, and íesponsible for it, by my
v«efa    I can inform my colleague that he doe3 me groasinjus
tice in tint statement, and that he will find, by refenmg to the
journals of this. Hou&e   that I voted against a large poition oí
i   th" expenditures of each year of Geneial Jack-son's adminia
nation   which, m my opm on   were not sanctioned by any
j   sound  policy or  pnneip'p     I theiefoie deny the respondí
biluy attempted to be thiown upon me    ButupO" thisqnes
I   tion of expendituie, as well as, in regaid to  various othei
I   abu es of power duung the lite Admimstiation, I will infoim
¡   my colleague it was withm the Wtbiee years only that they
weie diaimingiy developed     The annual   expenditures m
1829,eK0lUbive of the pubhe debt, weie $12,659490, in 1830,
ftlá,¿29,533 in 1831 ©13 864,067, in 1832, $16 516 388    By the
l"nsion ait of 1832, and some other extiaordinary demand*
I   upon the Tieasuiy, the expenditures of 1833 lose to the slim of
$22 713 755, exclusive of the public debt but m 1834, they were
I   reducedtoS1849'5417)aridm IS36 to 817 573,141    ThereiS)na
j   my colleague will see, a vast disproportion between these sums
|   and the $30 (J00,000 and upwards to which the annual expendí
tures of the Government have lately risen, and which, Ifeai,
I   we are never to see íedueed    Ihe annual expenditures pnoi
!   to 1836 do not much exceed an ->vciage mereaseovei the expen
dituresof the foimei admmistrition   of which I woull com
plain    They comp withm the limit which i have often said in
this House 1 regarded as not going beyond a just propoition to
the increased population, resouices and necessary publicedla
bhshmems of the country    As to the other abuses of which I
complain, it is tr ie that some of them existed in eveiy period
of General  iackson's admmiotiation  but 1 deny that they evei
i   had my sanction foi one moment    Besides the gieat and lead
nig questions which aiose m tht early \ art ol GeneralJack
son's admimstiation   of which 1 have alieidy spoken, there
were ceitan otlni nnpoitant prmcq !ps and ir easuiet. of Go
vernment which he came ink power pledged to carry out  and
before he actually assumed the Government, they were ie
gaulel   is the jeeuhtr and distinguishing   principles of his
¡   part}     Among the«e may be enumerated the hmnation of Ex
ecutive pitionage, and a thorough leform of all the abuses
which li id biought the pationdgc of the Government mto con
|   fiict with the freedom of elections    Under this head   all mter
ference of public officers m elections  and ail lemovals fiom
office for opu ion b s ke were denounced as coiruptmg in then
tpndencv   and < nwt rous to the last degiee, to the purity a   i
stability of out fue institutions     feir, these important principies.
wt re disregarded in the early part of the 1 ite Admimstiation and
before the cia e of it they were openly violated, and m piaciice
utteily repudiated     -But   sir, I then opposed and piotpsud
asrauiat these abuses, andl defy mortal manto «how any case m
,   which they had my appioval     V\ on all these question*'  and
nidny  moie   it will be found   opona propei   sciuuny   that
j   Gci tral Jick*-on n^vei did have my suppoit    \et, sn, I am
i   denounced and calun Eiated for having changed my piinciples,
when I have stood fist by them dunng my whole j unite life by
'   the very men and then instruments who have themselves viola
,   tedand treated with indifference or contempt nearly every pi in
ciple to which they stood pledged when they fir&t came into

My celleagup =uppose that be finds m another passage of my
speec h at "Nasshville m the spring ofl^o conclusive evidence
of tht inconsistency and msmceiity of my public course and
prof °sions    In that speech 1 refened to the efioits which the
enemies of Judge White weie making to seduce the people in
to the belief mat I e and his friends m Tcnne«0ee were the op
ponnuts of Geneial Iickson and his administration   and I ex
pres e i the opinion that the ii lends of Judge "VS hue would "ad
heiet> the athnmistiation of General Jackson   from consist
|   ency ni d íesppct  for thoir own  chaiacter  and because they
I   won d be supporting their own principles        Well, sir  snch
i   wert   he views and intentions, of the leadmsr friends of Judsre
I   Win    m Tennessee at the penod of the  speech quoted by my
colle^ue    They had suppoittd ceitan leading principles of

had d Terel from theOppusitmi, ab wellasfiom a considerable
portio   of the   uppnr eis of ihesame Administration   Thev did

They nei   et intended to de=eit nor defeat then patty, but to re

could nottiB removed A om power, and two years would close
his political career It wasregarded as worse lhanidletoat
tempt to overthrow his power in the short term that remaiued
of his administration How well the friendá óf Jüdg'e Whjte
understood the power of General Jackson's hatte and mñu
ence was soon fully and fatally demonsftated When the name
of Jud^e White was first ¡We-sénfed as a candidate, nearly the
whole Southwest haitns the annunciation with joy and satis,
faction; but I wisn, for the sake oí our free institution*,, that
the serSúel had never been revealed to the woild The mo
ment Geneial Jackson was understand to disappiove, hun
dredrs nay, sir, thousands, instantly turned about and condemn
ed and opposed the movement in favor of Fudge White w ith ihe
same zeal with which they had so recenpy applauded and sup
ported it
But my colleague again ask& if the same abuseg4 which T ha\ e
denounced in such stiong terms, did not exist at that time, and
ivhy I did not then proclaim them to the country, arjd how Í
could continue the support of an Admmistrauoh wh eh prac
used them
It is true, sir, as 1 have already stated, that many of these
abuses did exiU—they "wore k own to roe ie- exist, as well as to
many others, leading Alenda of Judge White    1 allude pain
culaily to the gieat abuse of the appomtirg power— proscnp
tioíi for opinion's sake—the iriegulrinties and abusts which
weiesuffered in some branches of the public seivice    In 0 e
Land Office, in ihe Post Office Depaitment, in the Indian &ei
vice, thes.e were known to exist—they weie protested against—
and all the influences we could bring to bear weie emplojed
through eveiy channel which was believed to hold out any hope
of«uccess m order to correct them (9) These thmg^ the friends
of Judge White, m lennc see,sawand derlored    But still, all
the while, theie weie other questions, which were coi tmualiy
agitating and ¿bribing public attention, and upon tht«e other
questions the friends of JuJge White generally acted with the
Admimstiation    What weie they to do undei ¡=uch encurr
stances''   The course which wisdom and patriotism and sound
principle, m then opinion, dictated they endeavored to pursue
1o make ineñectual war upon Geneial Jackson's admu istra
tton, to denounce it foi eirors, and abuses while it had ti e sup
poit ofthe people upon other Gieat and absoibmg questions of
the day, would not only have been inconsistent with their own
course, so far as, those questions weie concet nee1, but every pros
pect offutineiel efand lefotm wouldnaVe been blasted    The
fnendbof Judge White &aw the full extent of the evijt, of th-1
Admmi<itiation thev saw that many of thecaidinal piinciples
upon which the late Administration came into  powei weie
ttainpled upon    They saw and knew the mteie&ts, and pas
sions thu were at woik to uphold all theabu^es and iirtcu'aii
ties which were known to exist    They knew the guiding «pi
ritsoflate and who were suie to control the enduing Adminis-
tration if then plan* should succeed    1 hey knew mata sue
cet-sor had aheadv been agieed upon by those who had exei
cised a fatal influence upon General Jackson's administration
fiom the commencement    And they resolved mthecnlyway
which was open to them by every constitm onal and honorable
means, to oppose and, if poss,ibli-, to btcak down a system and
oider of things which they beheicd ere krg, wouli afflict the
countrv with the greatest calamities     But, sir, theadbeicnU, of
powei and the suf porters of the candidate ol the party, as he
was called, weie not anient with the couise whidi Judge
White and his fi lends were disposed to pur ue  They ca^u ite 1

foes to Republican instittitions   and thus mo t of the leading

had ever rt.ppioved, and to sustain the Gieat and 1c ding pun
