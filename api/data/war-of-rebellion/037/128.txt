Back, major Webb informed me that this was mistake; that no troops of our were on this road. About this time an officers in command of six companies of the Twentieth Mississippi (mounted)reported to me that he had been sent to Edwards Depot to guard the wagon trains, which were at that time retreating across Big Black. I directed this officer to deploy his men as skirmishers, and keep the enemy in check as long as possible, I then rode to the intrenchments at Big Black, and informed you what I had done. This includes the verbal orders conveyed by me on the 16th, I carried none on the 17th.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant.
