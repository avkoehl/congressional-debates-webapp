brigade during the campaign Bvt. Brigadier General William B. Woods to the rank of full brigadier-general and I also recommend with pleasure the promotion of Colonel R. F. Catterson (Ninety-seventh Indiana Infantry), commanding Second Brigade, to the rank of brigadier-general. Colonel Catterson has long commanded the Second Brigade of this division, and he has shown himself ever to be a brave, gallant, and competent officer, and one well meriting promotion.

The officers and men throughout my division have all borne a noble, manly part in the campaign, enduring hardship and labor without murmuring, and bearing themselves well when before the enemy. I mention the names as conspicuous for gallantry amongst many: Captain Allen, of the Twenty-fifth Iowa, who lost a leg in the fighting of the 20th; Captain Teale, of the Fourth Iowa, who lost a leg in the fighting of his brigade commander, who was severely wounded on the 21st; Captain Burch, of the Consolidated Battalion Thirty-first and Thirty-second Missouri, badly hurt on the 21st, and Lieutenant and Adjutant Lermond, One hundred and third Illinois, also wounded on the 21st. Had I space I would gladly mention many more brave men that came under my notice.

To the various members of my staff - Doctor French, surgeon-in-chief; Major Perkins, chief of staff; Captain Alexander, assistant commissary of musters; Captain Smith, acting assistant inspector-general; Captain Henry, provost-marshal; Captain Wilson, acting assistant adjutant-general, and my two aides-de-camp, Lieutenants Critz and Marriott - I tender my thanks for the willing and able service they have rendered me, whether in camp, on the march, or on the field of battle.

I have the honor to be, major, with respect, your obedient servant,

CHAS. R. WOODS,

Brevet Major-General.
