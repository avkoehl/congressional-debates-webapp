HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, OFFICE OF PROVOST-MARSHALL-GENERAL,July 18, 1864.

Major-General HUMPHREYS, Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: Seven deserters from the Sixty-fourth Georgia Regiment, Wright's brigade, Mahone's division, Hill's corps, came into our lines this morning from 2 to 3 o'clock. They bring no additional information. From their statements we should judge that their regiment was considerably demoralized. Many of them would desert if they dared to . They are nearly all conscripts, and were forced into the army against their will. They know nothing about the attack ordered last night, except mere rumor that there was to be one. We learn from one of them that a deserter from our army went over yesterday afternoon and gave himself up to their regiment. We cannot learn what regiment he is from. One of informants thinks he communicated something of importance concerning the attack and our preparations for it.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEORGE H. SHARPE,

Colonel, &amp;c.
