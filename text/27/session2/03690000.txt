' Mr Hopkins of Virgiraa objected
"Mc Stanly appealed to Mr Hopkins to withdraw hisob*
J^tion, as the permission asked had never been refused
Mr Hofkins persisting m his objection, the Speaker de-
cided Mr Everett could not make the explanations asked 
Aftei some remaiks from Mess's B01TS and EVERETT,
Mr HOPKINS «aid that if it was the first timo a3 had bee 
asseited, fhat the privilege asked by the gentlen an f'-om.Ver-
m nt had ever been objected tu, he must be allowed to say, that
it was also the first time withm his recotlecuon that such a re-
quest had ever been made to the House Hie objection pro-
ceeded from no disinclination to oblige that gentleman, nor from
any desnt, or intention to withhold from him any right that the
ruies of courtesy, or of the House might entitle him to If any
a'tack had been made upon that gentleman, m the House or out
of it he should not have interposed any objection to his re-
maiks But he did not understand that the gentleman desired
to make any such e'iplanat on as that On the contrary, he un 
dei stood him as expressing a desire, ¡-imply to review and ex*
plain a speech, made by him some daysago in this House If
the gentleman be peimitted to do that, wny might not every
o her mem ier claim the right to review and explain the thou*
sands of speeches made upon this floor1? It was to avoid the in-
convenience which he thought he foresaw would íesult from
such precedents, that he had objected, and for no other reason
whatever
Mr MORGAN moved the previous question
Mr ARNOJD asked Mr M to withdraw the motion
Mr MORGAN íefused
And the question being taken on the demand for the prevtotw
que&tion, there was a second
And t he mam question (being on the amendment) was order-
ed, and, being taken, the amendment rejected

J mmal of the Houoe of Tuesday's proceedings, (and assuming
finally rather a personal character,) took place, m which Messrs

And heie the ma ter ended
The following statements were handedto the Reporterhy
Me^rs  GonDB Howard and Welleb
Mr GOODE said he wished merely to suggest that the fol-
lowing amendment to his motion of ye«terdaj to amend tha
journal, viz £ And the said Joshua R Giddmgs declined speak
mg, after all objections to his proceeding had been withdrawn,'*
as coming from Mr Wellsr, of Oh o, had erroneously
crept on ihe Tournal He (Mr Goode) had been informed
by the CI°rk that the above amendment of Mr Weller had
been reduced" to writing by Mr Weller himself i t his desk,
and had never been read to the Hou^e Consequently he (Mr.
Goode) had no knowledge of its existence till this morning,
when to his surprise he heard it read by the Clerk Ifhehaa
known i(, he should have onposed it, and *hown it (the above
anerdment of Mi \V ) to be incorrectas not containing a tru 
etatemerf of the rape
The SPEAKFR saio that this mat ercame legitimately upon
the j urnal, that Mi Hopkins rose and moved the amend nent,
whKh was taken down immediately by the Cleik at the table;
that Mr Weller then ro*e and moved his amendment verbally,
and that it was immediately acoept^d by Mr Hopkins; that
a ter the motion was made to lay the whole matter on the tab e,
he (t e Speaker") asked the Clerk if he had obtained Mr Wel
leu's amendment m writing for the journal, that the Clerk re
plied that he had not, and tha be (the Speaker) directed him to
apply to Mr Weller to reduce his amendment to wilting,
which he did and that it wis inserted on the journal m the
iorm m which Mr W furnished it
Mr WELLER havms risen for the purp se of responding to
h i colleagne [Mr Gonr>E 1 i*poi  rkel tint the statement of tha
Speaker was so full and satisfactory that he had nothing to add
thereto
