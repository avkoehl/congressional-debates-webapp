OFF MORRIS ISLAND, September 5, 1863-6.10 a.m.

General GILLMORE:

Please have your extreme advance marked by an American flag, and if the fire of the Ironsides injures the trenches have a white flag waved over the American flag.

DAHLGREN,

Admiral.

MORRIS ISLAND, September 5, 1863-10.10 a.m.

Lieutenant PRESTON,

Flag-Officer:

I propose another trial to-night. The failure last night* was owing to Mr. Higginson's acting without orders. My troops, when they passed down to the mouth of the creek, met him returning with a captured boat. Musketry had been resorted to in making the capture, and Cumming's Point was alarmed.

GILLMORE,

General.

MORRIS ISLAND, September 5, 1863-1.50 p.m.

Admiral DAHLGREN:

I shall try Cumming's Point to-night, and want the sailors again early. Will you please send in two or three monitors, just before dark, to open on Moultrie as a diversion? The last time they were in they stopped re-enforcements, and may do so to-night. I do not want any fire in the rear. Please answer immediately.

GILLMORE,

General.

OFF MORRIS ISLAND, September 5, 1863-2.30 p.m.

General GILLMORE:

As your request is at variance with the written programme, I have sent Lieutenant Preston ashore to see you on the subject.

DAHLGREN,

Admiral.

OFF MORRIS ISLAND, September 5, 1863-5.30 p.m.

General GILLMORE:

At what time this p.m. can you dispense with the Ironsides' fire?

DAHLGREN,

Admiral.

MORRIS ISLAND, September 5, 1863-5.45 p.m.

Admiral DAHLGREN:

Let her cease now. If we do not succeed to-night, I suppose she will open again at sunrise; if we do succeed, a red light will be shown
