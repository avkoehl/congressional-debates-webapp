Brigadier-General GREGG,

Commanding Cavalry, Army of the Potomac:

GENERAL: The major-general commanding directs that you concentrate your cavalry during the night (your own division and that of Kautz), leaving such pickets as may be necessary to watch the most important and most exposed points, and at daylight make a sudden and rapid dash upon the enemy's line of communication between Petersburg and Stony Creek Depot for the purpose of captures as you make to your present position before the enemy can collect a largely superior force against you. This line of communication is the Boydton plank road or the road west of it. You should leave our lines somewhere near the Perkins house. General Warren is directed to have Ayres' division of infantry ready to support you at daylight, the commander of which will be instructed to report to you during to-day, and to whom you will give such orders as may be necessary for the efficient execution of the operations you are charged with.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,
