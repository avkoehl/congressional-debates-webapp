Sir, at sucn a time as this, with such a flood tiie
of prospei lty rushing m upon us, are we to 1 e told
that the banks have got no moiify that they can-
not pay their deots' I'hi> will not do let them not
think any longer to fin 1 countenance and protection
under a fictiticras panic, or to escape from the op-
probrium justly due to a violation of law, and of
common honesty1
At such a time of unusual piospenly and rejo>e
ins, is it no* proper to require the banks to act like
honest men, and pay their debts' Is there anv
thing unreasonable in this' Will it be unjust, op-
piessive, or " miking war on the banks'!" Do nol
individuals have to pay their debts' and do not the
banks make tneir debtors pa) ih m, to the utterm st
farthing' What objection cin there be to this mea-
sure, eithei in this District or else here' Haye
mt the banks ability to piy ' Those which aie
sound no doubt hive , and those that are lot en, as
no doubt some art, \ull not be more able Shall
we wait their moti m, and see if they will not vo-
luntarily resume payment' That "experiment'
has been tr ed, and the result is known The pi b-
lic expec'alion has been disappointed by the ¡ate
Bank Convention, and their confidence m no small
degree shaken in those institutions But he hoped
it was the last Bank Convention that would be wit-
nessed jn this country Whatever considerations
may have led to tne decision, whether politics or
speculation on the part ot the large institutions, the
public will not approve of it Some sinister pur
pose must hive controlled the result, as the e are
no substintial leasms why the banks cannot re-
sume th°ir regular course of business immediately
It i, true that, at that time, money in 1 exenange
were not quite as favorable as they are in w , but
thev were rap div improving a id notmng rould be
clearer thin that a general return to spine pi -
menis ov the bwkswi all have b ought bnh don"
to par, and the) h ii iome u \ iiwiio.il mii h
resumption
There is no place that a return to specie piy-
ments can be more eas) than in this District, w heie
theie are three millions of dollars a year disbursed
by the Government, a considerable part oí which
is now paid in specie, and the residue in Treasury
notes, or oiher funds which are equivalent to spe-
cie, or nearl) so The condition of the country,
in regard to specie, is highly favorable We have
just heard a statement from the Senator from Mis-
souri, (Mr Bemon ) derived fiom oficial sources,
by which it appears that the importation of specie
since 1832 has been over sixty millions, ai d its
exportation only about tuenly millions, making
an increase, in five years, of more than forty mil
lions There is now more thin Pightv millions of
specie in the country, ol which fr >m ten to fifteen
,s in gold com If this money is not m circula-
tion, it is in the hanks It must besonenheie,
and ii the banks could sustain their circulation m
1832, when there was less thin twenty-five mil-
lions of specie in the conntiy, can they rot do it
now, with more thin eighty millions'
What has enabled the comlry to reroyei. so
rapidly from the laralizinu (.fleets of the general
suspension of pay nient by the whole banks o<" the
Union' What has occasioned tne great difle-
rences between <ho present conn tton of the cotm
try, and that when the banks suspended in 1811'
Then, it took )ears to recover ¡rom the shock
now, a iew u onths has pecompiishe I more than
as manv )ears did tnen with the aid of a Unte 1
States ban¿ Then, after the lapse of six yens,
m 1820, theSecretaiy of the Treasu ), Mi Craw-
lord, declared tne cuirency to be in a very u isou i 1
condition , that al hougn there hid bum a reduc
uon of th' paper issues of neat y titty per cent a
still further reduction w as necessi' y b ft- re the
currency could become sonn 1 Vlt'iough the banks
commenced ne redemption of the r notes m 1817,
mary of them hid to suspend agun in 1819 , and
the n~xt year, Mr Crawford declared tha the piy-
ment of specie by ..laige portion of the banks vías
only nominal The difierence in the two cases is
no doubt owing m p irt to the more ample re-
sources of the country now , but must be mainly
attributable to the bareness of the country as to
specie then, when the amount did not probably
exceed fifteen millions, and the great supply of the
precious metals with which it now abounds That
is the true icas ii why the country has been enabkd
to recover so rapid'y from the teinb e shock which
is alway s felt by an explosion of a credit currency
Whatever may be said m favor of a pap r medium,
the specie m the country is our only security , it is
the only true basis on which the whole ered t of
the country rests , both the credit of ihe banks oi
that credit which senes as a cuirency, and mei-
eantile a.id private ciedtt of eveiy description,
repose on the precious metals in the country This
is the only solid foundation of credit, and it tlu  is
taken away or weakened, credit will fall oi be
weakened, uhateveí may be the property or other
res urces o1 the nation
The large amount of com in the covntiy, where-
eyei i* may be, whethei locked up in the banks, or
hoaided by individuals, is our main leliiuee, it is
tin which hascainei us through the piesent crisis,
arid sustained the credit of the hanks and the conn
try, - id enabled us to recover so rapi Uy from the
shock of a pap-i explosion, which, on a foimer
occasion, bore down the energies of die nation for
eight or ten years
Thtic are no difficulties in the wa> of the banks
resuming immediately And it they will not
voluntarily do it, ought thev not to be corr>pe"ed
to redeem their notes' Wiien will they b better
piepared' they aie, no doubt, m a much sounder
condition no v than thev have b"en foi m iny years
He was disposed to do the banks justice an 1 they

ducted Iheu affairs piudently and cautiously since
the su pension Mlhongh there weie some exeep-
t ins, yet most of them had em tailed thui dis-

Heyed it wis the result of the times For the list
six oreisrht months, the business which gues em-
ployment to bank capit il his been suspended It
has been a long div of reckoning, and no country
ever wanted such a reclonmg day moie Mer-
chants, manufacturers, and all classes of business
men, have, since the suspension, refrained from
engaging m any new enterprise--, some have closid
their business entirely, and all hru hem cautnus

Parliament for six month , and undei that amhoitiy

irredeemable paper constituting almost the enure

of things so very convenient and profitable, ihat its
whole influence was exerted to res st eiery attempt
to compel ,t to resume, and such was the depen-
dence of tne government upon it, that the whole
influence of the mnistrv was exerted '  justify and
