courier to me, and I will telegraph in your name. If all are brought they will number 1,200. They are well armed and supplied with ammunition. Major Johnston and I have been trying to get them here for three days. In a dispatch to me Major Johnston says:

I cannot under Longhorne on my own responsibility. Orders direct from Richmond to keep open communication with General Breckinridge and hold troops at New River bridge for him to fall back upon if necessary.

Of course, the troops are subject to your order. Do you wish telegraph line extended to Mount Airy? If so, inform me at once, and I will send Mr. Bowyer forward.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. T. STANTON,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

WYTHEVILLE, December 19, 1864.

Major J. STODDARD JOHNSTON:

To avoid delay consequent upon sending couriers to General Breckinridge, do you not think it would be the better policy to telegraph full statement of affairs to General Lee, showing the utter impossibility of the enemy's cavalry coming to New River bridge after their almost unprecedented marches? If the troops can be pushed to Saltville they will save the works. Enemy will never undertake to come back this way. Numbers of their stragglers are being picked up through the country. They are nearly broken down, and with so much fighting their ammunition must be almost exhausted. I make free to suggest this, because my position here enables me to understand affairs better than you can at Dublin.

H. T. STANTON,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

WYTHEVILLE, December 19, 1864.

Major J. S. JOHNSTON:

Duke, Cosby, Giltner, and Witcher all with General Breckinridge, Waughn's brigade scattered to the four winds. If Langorne will not send troops, telegraph General Lee. Do anything to get them here. Trains can come three miles west of Max Meadows, but ammunition must be taken off at Max Meadows. Have sent General B[reckinridge] 6,000 rounds ammunition found at this place. Have had verbal dispatches from him. Thurmond arrived; came in office.

H. T. STANTON,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

WYTHEVILLE, December 19, 1864.

Major J. STODDARD JOHNSTON:

General Breckinridge fought enemy two miles east [of] Marion all day yesterday. Drove them at every charge. Loss small. Courier says enemy had column on each flank of our forces. General Breckinridge says he is out of ammunition and will come to Mount Airy to-night.
