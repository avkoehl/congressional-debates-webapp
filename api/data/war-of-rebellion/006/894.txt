The one building by Ollinger & Bruce had been in the water about ten days, and, with the exception of machinery, would have been ready for her guns in ten days; she would have carried one 10-inch and one rifled 32-pounder.

These gunboats [were] well, strongly, and thoroughly built, and for sails or steam, and would, in my opinion, have rendered important service in case of an attack by the enemy upon Pensacola. These vessels were being constructed about 35 miles from Fort Pickens, and in case of an attack upon Pensacola were in a condition to have been, and might have been, removed up the Escambia River, out of reach of the enemy's gunboats.

When I was at Pensacola I saw no unusual number of enemy's ships off the part, nor could I discover the necessity for the destruction of the gunboats.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

EBEN FARRAND,

Commanding, C. S. Navy.

MOBILE, February 18, 1862.*

Honorable J. P. BENJAMIN:

Yours of the 8th just received. Fifth Georgia, Ninth Mississippi, Twentieth and Twenty-third Alabama Regiments on way to Knoxville. Should we not give up the seaboard now and concentrate all our means on the vital point?
