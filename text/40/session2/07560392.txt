THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
January 8,
cooperation to prevent it. Of many " thou-
sands" of these, their excuse and their story
is so 'well related by one of their number as to
render it proper to read it, and to close thereby
the preliminary branch of the case with which
I have been intrusted.
At page 54 Anthony W. Palmer deposes
and swears as follows :
"I am a citizen of Clinton county, Missouri, and
have been for the last thirty years. I was educated
in the political theory that State intervention, by
State authority, would be permissible and justifiable
as against unconstitutional Federal aggression; and
that in case of ultimate collision or conflict the
State would be entitled to the primary allegiance of
its citizens.
" In the spring of the year of 1861 the General
Assembly of this State passed a law to provide for
organizing, arming, and calling out its militia in
anticipation of such a conflict; and as it was explicit
and peremptory in its provisions, I entered and con-
tinued in its service until the State convention of the
sameyear abrogated the said law, and proclaimed an
amnesty in favor of all who would renounce or aban-
don further survice under it.
"On the 8th of December, 1861, which was before
the expiration of the period to which the acceptance
of that amnesty was limited, I did so renounce and
abandon that service, not only by taking the oath
which was required of me, but by subsequently and
6roperly reporting myself in person to Colonel James
[. Birch, jr., who was the aid-de-camp of Provis-
ional Governor Gamble, for this military division of
the State."
"As the terms of the voters' oath which was sub-
sequently prescribed by the same convention were
not retrospective beyond the period to which the
acceptance of that amnesty was limited, (sixty days,
expiring on the 17th December, 1861,) I continued of
course to be entitled to vote, and voted accordingly,
until a subsequent convention, which assembled in
the year 1865, divested me of the right, by incorpo-
rating in the new constitution an oath which is not
only retrospective as to the whole period of the
rebellion, but which included also all who had ever
Sympathized with persons engaged in it.
"As I could not honorably or conscientiously take
such an oath as that, I have not asserted my right to
vote, even against the adoption of the new constitu-
tion, which I feel so unjustly disfranchises me; and
this, notwithstanding others, upon whoso concurrence
and advice I acted in obeying the call of the State
authorities in 1861, have been permitted to register
and to vote in opposition to my views and those of
the conservative Union party with whom I would
have but naturally acted. Of these, the supervisor of
registration in this county, and its former represent-
ative in the Legislature, may be mentioned as among
its most prominent examples, and as examples only.
The former is proven, upon his own admissions and
otherwise, to have similarly sympathized with the
southern people, and to hare advised others to go
into the State service (against the Federal author-
ities) just as I did; and the latter not only voted for
the military bill under which Price's army wasorgan-
ized, but also voted (unanimously with the house
of whichhewas a member) thatit was the duly of the
people of the State to do as so many of us did in de-
fense of what we were thus taught to believe were our
' constitutional rights.' Of course I complain of this
in no other sense than that the registry law has been
so unjustly administered as to permit those who thus
incited us to go forward in what they officially de-
clared to be our duty in 1861 to register and to vote
for our disfranchisement, for no other reason than
that we acted in concurrence with their advice and
their law, so long as it was a law."

" I have since that period been attending to my
ordinary pursuits as afarmer—not, of course, indiffer-
ent to the course of public affairs—and have no doubt
that what is thus written of myself is substantially
true of thousands who were with me in the ' State
guard,' under the State law of 1861, but who declined,
as I did, to go into the confederate service (although
strongly pressed to do so) after the abrogation of that
law and the proffer of the just and generous amnesty
already alluded to."
It may seem superfluous to add, Mr. Speaker,
that these and every additional deposition I
shall read were taken under the eye and the
ear of the counsel for the contestee; and that
it is intended in thus giving them to the ear of
the House, and afterward to its congressional
history, (or Globe,) to at least suggest and
establish for a class of citizens who were polit-
ically educated and officially incited to do just
as they did, a more charitable and statesman-
like appreciation of their motives and conduct
than may have been suggested by the interested
partisanry which is content to carry its point,
no matter how. To this, however, it is my
duty to add a repetition of the reliance, that
whatever may be thought of the motives or the
reasoning of the " thousands " thus alluded to,
and who the testimony will disclose did not
even attempt to register or to vote, their status
should be in no sense confounded, either in
the argument or decision I am respectfully j
■addressing myself to at this point and in this I
connection, with the ever loyal citizenry who
did vote,,^nd upon whose votes I solely relied
when claiming before your committee that it
was my right to come in, and sit, and act
amongst you here.
The case involves, however, another point
or purpose which may appropriately enough
be considered in the same connection, which
is, that citizens thus forgiven and amnestied
by the convention of 1861 were of course voters
upon the question of calling the subsequent
one in 1804; and as I expect to deduce from
the authorities, (including that of the committee
itself,) and to demonstrate by argument, that
a convention which derived its sole authority
from the vote of such a political "people,"
(namely, all who could and would take the
prospective oath of loyalty, as ordained by the
first convention,) could in no reSpect transcend
that authority, and least of all by disfranchis-
ing its own constituency, without at least a sub-
sequent ratification by that constituency, it is
respectfully trusted that this deposition and the
one I will next read may at least be regarded
as pertinent to the governing guide of registerial
construction, upon which it will be presently
insisted that the right to the seat in contest (or
at least its vacation) should be made to turn.
I will hence read another deposition, at
page 55, as demonstrating that it was not
merely such misguided and forgiven eitizens
as Palmer and other " thousands " were with
whom the political contrivers and authors of
this new oath repudiated the most solemn
faith of their State, but also such ever peace-
ful and loyal citizens as Joseph B. Biggerstaff,
who could and did take the oath, but who was
imperiously and successfully '' construed'' out
of his vote, as will appear from his deposition,
as follows :
"-I reside in Plattsburg, Clinton country, Missouri,
and have so resided, with the exception of a year or
so I resided on my farm, (in the same county,) for
the last twenty-four years. I was one of more than
a hundred and fifty citizens who desired and applied
to take the oath of loyalty, and to cast our votes in
opposition to the ratification of the new constitution
at the election which was held for that purpose at
Plattsburg and throughout the State on the tith day
of June, 1865.
"Being refused permission to do this by the elec-
tion judges, on the ground that our names appeared,
with others, upon a list or enrollment that had been
made by certain military officers during the latter
part of the year 1862, as ' southern sympathizers,'we
complained of it in a respectful written protest,
which was simultaneously prepared and forwarded
to the Governor, in consequence of which the mate-
rial facts of the case remain more distinctly im-
pressed upon my memory than they otherwise might
have done.
" I was personally acquainted with many of the
persons thus rejected as voters. They were orderly
and upright citizens, several of whom had been re-
jected as militiamen when the companies came to be
reorganized under ' Order No. 24,' but I had no rea-
son to believe that they had done anything which
disentitled them to take the prescribed oath and to
vote as they had always done, unless that oath was
to be construed (as it then was and has since been) to
mean that the decision of these military classifiers
was final, and that the sympathies which many of us
but naturally entertained for a kindred southern
people should disentitle us to a vote, under a Govern-
ment to the laws and requirements of which we had
always loyally conformed ourselves, and especially
(as was then the case) upon the question of our own
fermanent disfranchisement. Such an assumption
knew to be the reverse of either truth or justice in
respect to my own loyalty, and I had no reason to
believe it was less unjust and untrue with respect to
others who were similarly refused the right to vote
at that election, or since, in which it appears that
only about half the citizens of the county or the State
were permitted to participate."
While the manner in which the committee
have condensed and stated the propositions I
argued before them is sufficiently lawyer-like
and fair, it is nevertheless proper to be sug-
gested, that in deference to the judgment of
those who thought my object could be as well
or better attained by simply relying upon the
terms of the enabling act of the convention to
fix and limit the construction of their ambig-
uous and unratified " oath," it was dwelt upon
in my "brief," asitwill be in this connection,
mainly with that view. It matters not, of
course, that upon the general proposition of
the absolute nullity of the so-called new con-
stitution, as a constitution, the opinion that
is so common with the more eminent of my
professional contemporaries and friends con-
tinues to be my own opinion, and that in
another connection, and for a purpose more
all-embracing, I may at least condense the
reasons for that opinion. Until then it will
suffice to add that the argument of my "brief,"
upon which '' the committee did not deem itself
at liberty to enter," will be substantially my
argument in this connection.
in that " brief," Mr. Speaker, I quoted from
the law of my State entitled "An act to pro-
vide for calling a State convention"—the
organic or enabling act, as it will be called
through the course of this argument—its fifth
section, as follows:
"Sec. 5. The delegates elected under the provis-
ions of this act shall assemble in St. Louis on the
tith day of January, 1865, and organize themselves
into a convention by the election of a president and
other officers, as they may deem necessary, and shall
proceed to consider, first, such amendments to the
constitution of the State as may be by them deemed
necessary for the emancipation of slaves; second,
such amendments to the constitution of the State as
may be by them deemed necessary to preserve in
purity the elective franchise to loyal citizens, and
such other amendments as may be by them deemed
essential to the promotion of the public good."
At the date of this enactment the elective
franchise in that State was regulated by a con-
stitutional provision which granted the ballot
to all white males of the requisite age and
citizenship, and by the oath contained in an
ordinance of a previous STate convention,
adopted on the 10th day of June, 1802, in
these words :
"I, A B, do solemnly swear (or affirm, as the case
may be) that I will support, protect, and defend the
Constitution of the United States and the constitu-
tion of tho State of Missouri against all enemies and
opposers, whether domestic or foreign; that I will
bear true faith, loyalty, and allegiance to the United
States, and will not, directly or indirectly, give aid
and comfort or countenance to the enemies or op-
posers thereof, or of the provisional government of
the State of Missouri, any ordinance, law, or reso-
lution of any State convention or Legislature, or of
any order or organization, secret or otherwise, to
the contrary notwithstanding; and that I do this
with a full and honest determination, pledge, and
purpose faithfully to keep and perform the same
without any mental reservation or evasion what-
ever. And I do further solemnly swear (or affirm)
that I have not, since the 17th day of December,
A. D. 1861, willfully taken up arms or levied war
against the United States or against the provisional
government of the State of Missouri: so help me
God."
As rendering intelligible the reason for desig-
nating the prospective period and operation to
which this oath was restricted, it is deemed suffi-
cient to recur to the depositions of Riley and Pal-
mer, which were read at the opening of this
argument, and to add that by other provisions
of this law the calling and holding of said con-
vention were made to depend upon a vote of
the people of the State—the ninth and tenth
sections of the organic act, from which section
five has been already quoted, being in these
words :
" Sec. 9. All persons qualified to vote for members
of the General Assembly, under existing laws and
ordinances, shall be entitled to vote for delegates to
said convention.
" Seo. 10. At the times and places of voting afore-
said the qualified voters of said State shall be per-
mitted to vote 'for a State convention' or 'against a
State convention,' and the votes so cast shall be re-
turned to the secretary of State, with tho returns for
delegates to the convention; and if a majority so
voting shall have voted 'for a convention' the con-
vention shall assemble and proceed to the discharge
of the duties assigned to that body under this act," kc.
It is admitted that the majority of those "so
voting" was "for a convention;" that such a
convention assembled, as it was authorized to
do, in the city of St. Louis, on the 6th day of
January, 1865, and proceeded, as is shown by
its journal, to ordain an entire "new consti-
tution," which shows upon its face that it was
not to be submitted for ratification to the con-
stituency or "people" who had authorized its
election and assemblage for the purposes speci-
fied in the organic act, (and without whose rat-
ification it is respectfully submitted they could
not be divested of any right to which they had
not contingently assented by their vote, which
only authorized a convention to be elected for
the specific purposes enumerated in the' said
organic act,) but to a new constituency or
"people," as set forth in the new oath, (here
in contest,) which, by the terms of said new
