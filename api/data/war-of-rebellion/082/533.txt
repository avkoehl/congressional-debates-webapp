line running from Doctor Gurley's house toward Smith's, and running down the first road south from Smith's to the deserted farm, striking the plank road near the church. Captain Boice, of whom he speaks in his report, has pickets at the Gurley house and his reserve in the woods between Gurley's and Smith's house. A patrol I sen down the plank road early this morning reports that they came upon a small mounted force and about 500 infantry. In retiring they were not followed. This patrol started from the reserve near the church, and state that the force they came upon was not over half a mile from their outer post on the plank road and below the church. I send in three negroes, who have come into our lines from the rebels.

I am, general, very respectfully,

J. B. McINTOSH,

Colonel, Commanding Brigade.

P. S. - It seems now almost impossible to send scouting parties to the railroad toward Wyatt's and toward Reams' Station, as the enemy seem to be in our immediate front on that part of the line. I have a reserve at Temple's, which pickets down the Lee's Mill road to Brown's, and from there runs across and connects with pickets from the Second Division at Davenport Church.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: The report as given me by Lieutenant-Colonel Bacon that there were 500 infantry down the plank road (which were met by the patrol sent out this morning) I have since ascertained is not correct. Since sending that the force the patrol met was about twenty-four cavalry, who fired upon the patrol as they advanced. Our outpost on the plank road is just northwest of Tucker's house and beyond Alley's. Everything is perfectly quiet on my lines.

Respectfully,

J. B. McINTOSH,

Colonel, Commanding.

The picket-line as at present established seems to form a sharp angle at Doctor Gurley's house. Is it the wish of the major-general commanding to hold the angle at Doctor Gurley's house?

Respectfully,
