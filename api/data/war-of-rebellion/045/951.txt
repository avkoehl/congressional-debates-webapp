HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF HENRICO,Richmond, July 1, 1863.

Major T. O. CHESTNEY

Assistant Adjutant-General

MAJOR: I am directed by the general commanding the department to report the following forces, that can be used at the fortifications around this city: 1, 112 convalescents from hospitals; 600 exchanged prisoners; one company at Camp Lee, numbering about 60 men. There are also about 560 convalescents organized at Camp Winder, under Lieutenant-Colonel Cunningham, which have yet to be armed and equipped; this will be done as soon as practicable. I do not know whether Colonel Walker has yet fully armed and equipped all the convalescents under his command.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. W. PEGRAM,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

Honorable JAMES A. SEDDON,

Richmond:

General Martin reports Foster's arrival at New Berne with negro re-enforcements; my scouts in front confirm it. Martin learns 300 wagons were landing on Sunday to march on Wilmington. Attack by water to be made also. Enemy reported throwing forward scouts on the Neuse road. The advance on Weldon is doubtless to co-operate and cut off re-enforcements. You know my condition; let me hear from you immediately.

W. H. C. WHITING,

Major-General.
