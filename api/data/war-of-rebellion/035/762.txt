It is hardly necessary to remind you that it is not only proper, upon arriving at any military post or department or at the headquarters of an army in the field, to call upon the commanding officers, but that free conversations with such commanding officers afford the best means of obtaining the desired information.

You will communicate with this office by letter, from time to time, if you think it necessary, and, upon the completion of the duties herein assigned you, you will return to this city and report to me in person.

Very respectfully, yours,

JEFFERSON DAVIS.
