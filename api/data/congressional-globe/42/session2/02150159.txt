ports by advancing freights to and from our
ports, and reducing them from British ports,
thereby diverting the trade and commerce from
our ports And the remedy for these evils cannot
be found in unjust subsidies, but by establish-
ing free trade in ships, so that our merchants
can purchase ships where they can get them
cheapest, arid avail themselves of cheap Scotch
labor and put the profits of foreign commerce
in their own pockets, and add the vast amount
to the " national wealth" we have heard so
much talk about. And then remove all duties
on iron and other material used in ship-build-
ing, so far, at any rate, as the same articles
enter into the use of other industries, and
when this is done we will soon be in a position
to regain that large share of the world's com-
merce to which, by reason of our relative
vastness of population, commerce, and indus-
trial activity, extent of territory and sea-eoast,
we are justly entitled.
I have discussed a few of the curses that are
entailed on the country by this protective
doctrine. ''Theirname is legion," and I have
only attempted an examination of the most
injurious and ruinous. Under the Democratic
tariff' of 1867 we only laid a tax of fourteen
and four fifths per cent, on the amount of
imports. Now, as we have seen, the average
exceeds forty-eight per cent., over three times
as much. Other nations have tested the folly
and wickedness of high tariffs, and abandoned
and abolished them, while we alone persist in
imposing them upon the people. Compare the
amount of total taxation of the people of the
United States with that imposed by some other
Governments. Total taxation in the United
States, $852,000,000, about twenty-two dollars
per capita. Total taxation in England and
Wales, 384,000,000, $3 87 per capita. The
German zollverein or tariff is not over eight
per cent., and the taxation per capita does
not exceed that of Eugland. And we see that
our people are taxed per capita six times as
much as the people of other nations.
Sickened and disgusted with details of this
iniquitous system 1 leave it and turn to another
branch of this subject, and I come to an-invest-
igation of the amount of revenue necessary to
carry on the Government, and the manner of
raising it, and what relief we can afford the
people.
I have shown that the Government can
be supported, the interest on the public debt
paid, and a fund provided for the payment of
ouHndebtedness, on $152,000,000 less than we
expended last year. We can reduce the tariff
halt'and still raise over one hundred and three
million dollars, even if the imports do not in-
crease. That the amount will largely increase
is attested by all countries that have reduced
this mode of taxation. Imports and exports
have always increased under low tariffs ; and
when Great Britain abolished her tariff on
all articles except the few she now charges,
that country experienced very slight dimmit
tions of her revenue, because the imports in-
creased largely.

We can abolish taxation on these five arti-
cles of common use and necessity, and still
have a surplus of over seventy millions of the
estimate I have made: or wc can reduce all
the customs tax fifty per cent., and have a
surplus to allow the reduction of the internal
revenue. Fifty per cent, of the amount now-
paid on imports would bo over one hundred
and three million dollars; and internal rev-
enue paid last, year over one hundred and
forty-three million dollars; total, $246,000,-
000. The amount which ought to be expended
is $232,000,000; and then we have a surplus
of $14,000,000 left. So we can abolish ail tax-
ation on leaf tobacco, and dealers in leaf
tobacco, still have a large surplus for other
redactions—stamp tax, tax on spirits, &c.
Thousands of dollars can be saved by the
employment of different agencies in assessing
and collecting the internal revenue.
In my district the assessment costs about
one thousand dollars to the county, and the
collections about five hundred to the county.
It ought to he assessed and collected by the
States, and could be done for one third the
cost, and the people would be rid of the pimps
and spies now employed by the Government
to harass and bedevil them. And I shall advo-
cate the resolution offered by the gentleman
from Ohio [Mr. Campbell] at the beginning
of this session, when it comes up for consider-
ation.
Now, I have clearly demonstrated and estab-
lished, to the perfect satisfaction of every
member of this House, except the friends of
monopoly, that our customs tax amounts to
twice as much as is necessary to furnish the
revenue needed. Ought it, can it be consti-
tutionally imposed for any other purpose?
The Constitution answers emphatically, no.
Then, why impose or collect it? Writhing
under the heel of an enlightened and tax-
ruined people, protection assays one other
argument to justify its robberies, and insists
that there is a question of national wealth, of
national economy involved ; that the balance
of trade must be preserved; that we must be
careful not to import more than we export, or
we will pay away to foreigners all the national
wealth, and we ought by high duties to check
imports, and in this way prevent an excess
of imports (what we buy) over domestic ex-
ports (what we sell.) You say truly that our
imports exceed the exports. During last year
we imported :
Dutiable articles $518,759,518 12
Imports free of duty  59,161660 46
Total dutiable and free imports  577.922,173 53
Total domestic exports  534.05S.752 00
Excess of imports over domestic ex-
ports $43.S6«>.426 58
So we buy from foreign nations $43,863,-
426 58 more than we sell to them. And this
you say proves that our national labor is not
sufficiently protected, and we are supplied
by foreign labor, and that this rival competing
foreign labor oppresses our industry, and thus
you say it is evident that the excess of what
we bin' (import) over what we sell (export) is
not paid for with something actually produced
during the year—not with the results of actual
labor performed during the year, but with a
part of the capital savings, part of the national
wealth. And by this consumption of national
capital the nation is progressing to ruin. We
are giving every year in this way over forty-
three million dollars to foreign nations, and
this nation is thus losing over forty-three mil-
lions, and we must remedy this by reducing
imports.
This is sophistry. Let us test the theory by
a plain, common-sense illustration. My friend
from New York [Mr. Wood] is a merchant;
he dispatches from the city of New York a
vessel freighted with a cargo of American pro-
duce worth $200,000, and that amount was
entered at the custom-house as the value of
the exported produce. The vessel landed at
Liverpool, and the caigo sold for a net profit
of $-30,000. and Mr. Wood received for it
$250,000, a profit of twenty-five per cent.
With this he purchased a cargo of British
goods, the vessel returned to New Y'ork. and
the goods thus imported were entered_at the
custom-house at the invoice price of $250,000.
This cargo was sold for a profit of twenty-five
per cent., amounting to $62,500. Now, on
Mr. Wood's books he set down two snms as
gained -$50,000 profits on the cargo he sent
out, and another of $62,500 profits on the
cargo brought back—and we see in this trans-
action that the United States exported $200,000
of its produce, and imported $250,000 worth
of British products, and that the nation has
squandered on a foreign nation $50,000 of her
national wealth; but it is perfectly certain that
Mr. Wood, the citizen, has gained $112,500.
Some time after this Mr. Wood dispatched
another vessel with a cargo of American pro-
duce worth $200,000, which foundered in mid-
ocean, and the cargo was a total loss, and Mr.
Wood so entered on his books, and it was
verified by his depleted purse. But in the list
of expoitations at the custom-house in New
York, $200,000 is entered as the value of the
produce sent out,, and as Mr. Wood brought
back nothing, there is nothing in the list of
imports to balance this export entry; and
Mn Wood's wreck makes a clear profit to the
United States of $200,000; so that, according
to the balance-of trade theory, the United
States has a simple manner.of doubling her
capital; that is, after entering her products for
export at the custom house, throws them all
into the sea. By this means her exports will
soon be equal to her national capital; importa-
tions will be nothing, and the gam will be all
that the ocean has swallowed up. The idea
that there is any other "national wealth" than
the wealth of the people,.and that a nation can
be made rich by the losses of its citizens, is
supremely absurd and ridiculous.
If the theory of national wealth was correct
I can in few words prove that the remedy is
directly opposite to the doctrine you teach,
for I have already shown that your high tariff
has always tended to reduce exports, because
by it you prevent exchanges of products.
Under the tariff of 1857, averaging only four-
teen per cent., our exports for. the year 1861,
the last year under that rate, were $382,836,474;
the imports were $352,739,387 ; excess of ex-
ports, $30,095,097. Yrou may take any period
of high tariffs aud you will find that uuder
their operation exports diminish, and take
every period of low tariffs and exports in-
crease. Under the moderate protection from
1821 to 1824 the excess of imports over ex-
ports was $16,000,000. From 1825 to 1828
of higher duties it was over $17,000,000, and
from 1829 to 1832 under extreme protection
the balance against us was $35,000,000, and
from 1843 to 1846 of high protection the situ-
ation had changed from $20,000,000 in our
favor to $8,000,000 against us. And from 1862
to 1869, seven years of extreme duties, the
balance against us was $284,000,000, while
during the seven years immediately preced-
ing of low, non-protective tariff, the balance
ip our favor was $184,000,000. In the only
period of long continued low duties, our ex-
ports increased from $109,000,000 in 1846,
to $374,000,000 in 1861, a gam of more than
two hundred per cent., while exports under
protection always decreased.
I have compared the values of the products
of the several industries of the country, and
compared the numbers of the oppressed with
that of their oppressors. I now took around
this Hall for the friends of the great oppressed
majority, and I ask Kepresenlatives, what
pledges have we made to the pp>>ple ? Diu we
not promise to reduce their burdens? Have
we not the power to redeem these pledges aud
make good these promises? Fellow-Demo-
crats is there a protectionist in our ranks?
If there is he has departed from the faith.
Democracy despises extortions, monopolies,
and oppressions. It loves freedom and justice.
Will that grand, glorious old party that has
never failed when it has had power to relieve
the sufferings of the people falter now when
