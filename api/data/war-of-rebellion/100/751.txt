General J. E. JOHNSTON,

Smithfield, N. C.:

Have ordered General Wheeler to move to Danville via Hillsborough. Does this meet with your approval? If not, please countermand at Hillsborough and notify me.

G. T. BEAUREGARD,

General.

NEAR SMITHFIELD, N. C., April 4, 1865.

General BEAUREGARD,

Greensborough:

It is too late for Wheeler to attempt to reach Danville. You must depend on re-enforcing it with infantry by rail. To save time I telegraphed Wheeler to await further instructions at Raleigh. Any more news of Stoneman?*

J. E. JOHNSTON.

GREENSBOROUGH, N. C., April 4, 1865.

Brigadier General H. H. WALKER,

Commanding, Danville, Va.:

Stoneman's command is reported to have crossed Yadkin at Jonesville and Rockford on 2nd instant, p. m., and moved toward Dobson and Mount Airy; destination probably Taylorsville. From there he may continue to Lynchburg, if he is protecting flank of column reported to be moving along Virginia and Tennessee Railroad, or from Taylorsville he may march on Danville. Establish at once scouting parties at Taylorsville and a line of couriers to that point.

G. T. BEAUREGARD,

General.
