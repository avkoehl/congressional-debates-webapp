HEADQUARTERS LEFT WING, December 24, 1862-12.55 p.m.

General W. S. ROSECRANS:

I can move to La Vergne to-night, but cannot get there before night even with my front, and long after night with my rear, and, of course, cannot tell how strong a position I may fall upon.

Their object will be to stampede everybody by stories of the magnitude of their force. Be on your guard on that score. Where is Bruce, and where is the Tennessee cavalry? We will catch and kill those rascals yet.
