thit this suspension is not the result of any mis-

not, but a majority of the committee were
dispo,cd to renew these charters upon the teims

if this be proper, the hill contains many provisions

ALLEGHANY RIVER
The motion made some time since by Mr, MER-
CER, from the Committee on Roads and Canals,
to print 1500 extra copies of the report oi the sur-
vey of the Alleghany river, was taken up as the
first business m order, and, on the question of con-
curring therein, the vote was—ayes 46, noes 52
no quorum
Mr WHITTLESEY of Ohto hoped the busi-
ness of the House would not be arrested by this
matter, and he therefore moved to postpone it till
Monday
Mr MERCER had rathei it be not postponed,
as the object was one of a very impoi'ant oharae-
tet, and the expense involved was but Itiflmg
Mr TALIAFERRO would vo e for it il it wonkl
f,\( ill tale the work, but he was at a los* to perceive
how the printing ot 1500 extra copies of this work
con'd effect the removal of a single stone
Mr MERCER and Mr WHITTLESEY made
a buef statement of the importance of the work,
when the latter gentleman withdrew hi  motion
Mr POTTER said there has been no moie iwi-
pottant survey made for years under the orders of
the National Government, than that of the Alle-
ghany river, and the question now is, shall there be
1,500 copie« of the íeport, chart, &c published for
mfoimation The interests of various States are
deeply involved m the navigation of this stream
Its first point of navigation forrafls, is in the State of
New York, nay steambo its have occasionally gone
to Olean poin , and now weekly ascend from Pitts-
g to Wairen, in Pennsjlvania The head waters
of tins stream peneti ate into Western Pennsylvania
and New Yoik, and passthrotighaeountryabound-
iiis in the finest lnmbei m the vvorld At present,
with all the difficulties that environ this navigation,
the luraber ol the Alleghany supplies that portion
of the western prairie country, and the cities on the
Ohio, Mississippi and Missouri, with thi5 impor-
tant and indispensable article At St Louis and
Natchc?,} on will find the lumberyards supplied
from the section of country through which this
stream flows In this point of view, the improve-
ment is one of a national chancier it is nut con-
fined to one or two States, but to numerous States
At present, the internal improvements of Pennsyl-
vania connect this stieam by eauals and lailroads
with the Atlantic seaboaid, and h"ve commenced
a woik atFrmklm, in Venango county, to connect
it by a canal with Lake Erie Thus that vast re-
gion <f country bordering nprn the "real inland
ea , will, in fací,s e supplied with the merchandise
or the Atlantic seaboard through th s channel,
md the products of that rapidly improving coun-
Irj, convejed to a market View the v ast region
•m nnd the lakes the a-eum dating population,
the evtent of navigation and (oast, and the magni-
tude ?nd importance of this impiovement cannot
fnl to s'rike the mind ot every reflecting indivi-
dual Nay, it is but a continuance of the naviga-
tion of the Ohto (or some three or four hundred
miles further up a tr'butary stieam The officers
of the Government, under 'he authority of Con-
gress have made this snrve>,havepc'fectedachart
Why was this done1 To collect and embody cor-
rea information touching a gieat and leading
avenue of trade, 'o furn'sh aec ra'edal , icldttve
to one of the means ot transporting ,irms, ammuni-
tion, itc to be usel in defending our country, if
another «trugsde should arise with Great Britain
Nov-r v hen the sprvice has been performed, when
th< information has been collected, and the data
ascertained, arp -we to render the whole action nu
gatcrj, by closing the shell like the oystei, and
withholding the information from those interested
What is it the House is asked to do' To print fif 
teen hundred extra copies of the report, &c For
whom and for what? For the pitipié. Who- is
prepared to withhold it, and on "what principle?
The State which J have the honor in part to repre-
sent, ha\ with her own means, completed a maghi-
cient plan of improvements, which she is rapidly
extending to every portion of the State. She asks
no aid from this Government to her oWn works,
but correct and accurate information touching
any stream flowing through her territory is of im-
portance Her people are willing te acquire know-
ledge from any souice. As it has been attained,
why not furnish it?
Mr FILLMORE admitted the importance of
the -Work, but not to the extent stated by the gentle-
men who bad preceded him, especially as to the
difference ef time in the opening of spring naviga-
tion. He was in favor of punting the e-ttra num-
ber of copies.
Mr DROMGOOLE understood the usual num-
ber of copies had already been printed He inquired
if this was the fact.
Mr MERCER replied m the affirmative
Mr DROMGOOLE regarded the motion as
nothing more than a covert attempt to pledge the
House to a revival of the svstcm of internal im-
provements by the Federal Government, for when
the proposition should come up, they would be told
that Congress had pledged itself for the work, by
ordering the extra number of copies. He hoped,
therefore, that the motton to print would not prevail;
and believing thatsomethmg mpre than the printing
was hereafter designed by at, he moved to lay the
motion to print on the table.
Mr THOMAS called for the yeas and tiajs,
which were ordered.
Mr MERCER hoped his eolleague, after cast-
ing the reflections he had, would not persist in a
motion which cut off the opportunity to reply.
Mr DROMGOOLE had cast reflections upon no
one, but had reteired to what he conscientiously
believed would be the effect of the motion, and the
design to which it would be used He could not
consent to withdraw his own motion
Mr MERCER hoped th'n, under these circum-
stances, his colleague's motion would not prevail.
The House refused to lay it on the table—yeas
69, nays 81, and the question again recurring on
the motion to print—
Mr MERCER expressed his astonishment at
the remark of hi? coHeagpe, and disclaimed the
existence of any covert design m the motion. Mr
M then went into some details iirreferehee to the
importance of improving (he Alleghany river, and
adverted to the amount appropriated for works of
internal improvement last year, to show there was
no need of any secret design to revive that system.
Mr MARVIN confoverted the position that the
printing of an extra number of a document would
be equivalent to, or have the effect of, pledging the
faith of Congress to carry ?m the work As to any
covert design he denied it, for it was as open as it
could be, from the presentation of a large number
of petitions, and tins motion coming froni one of
the standing committees of the House As to "re-
viving' the styslem, he did not know that it h-d
been vet abandoned, and this work-was of as na-
tional a character as any the Government ever en-
gaged in The whole West Was interested in it,
(or it «asbut an extension of the Ohionvei itself,
and such was us importance that he would have
preferred a much larger number of conies.
Mr WHITTLESEY of Ohio admitted that he
was mistaken n the difference of time, thirty days,
between ihe opening of the canal and the river
Mr BIDDLE asked why it was that Ihe people
interested in «his work should be deprived of an op-
P rtumty oftxamitung this report as well as their
Repiesenlatives? Why should poor Pennsylvania
be depi ived of the benefit of such a work' In or-
dering the committee to take charge of it, the
House had iome object in view.
Mr BEATf Y said the subject had been so well
sustained by othei¡>, that he should have contented
him-elf with voting in favor of the printing of the
report, &.c if it had not hecn for the observation of
one of h,s colleagues, «hat those who represented
those districts m Pennsylvania most deeply inte^
