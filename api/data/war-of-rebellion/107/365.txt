YORK, April 23 - a. m.

General WYNKOOP:

The Government orders that this road be secured at all hazards. Can you, and will you, do it? Can you, and will, do it from that point or by advancing to Shrewsbury? Go to Shrewsbury if you can execute your orders.

PORTER.

Major PORTER:

If I take my command out here I cannot hold them without food. The men are in a very bad condition, and must have something to eat. Will come on to York and get their provisions and make any arrangements that will be acceptable to the Government.

[WYNKOOP.]

General W[YNKOOP]:

Where is Major Belger? Tell him to come here.

PORTER.

General W[YNKOOP]:

I will supply food immediately if you will say where you determine to locate.

PORTER.

[Major PORTER:]

Give my men their breakfast at York and I can then take them wherever you wish, and guard all the bridges on the road if sanctioned by Secretary of War or General Scott.

[WYNKOOP.]

General W[YNKOOP]:

The Secretary of War directs the road to be held at all risk, and if you bring all your men here you will lose your bridges.

PORTER.
