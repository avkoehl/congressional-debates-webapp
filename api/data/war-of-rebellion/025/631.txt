NOTE.-Differences in totals and aggregates are accounted for thus: Army of the Mississippi, arrival of new regiments; Army of the West, McCown's division leave for Chattanooga. This return shows force at Columbus, Miss. Returns from cavalry not handed in owing to the distance they picket from department headquarters.

Respectfully submitted.

BRAXTON BRAGG,

General, Commanding.
