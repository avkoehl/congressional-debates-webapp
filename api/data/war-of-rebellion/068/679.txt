Lieutenant-Colonel COMSTOCK,

Aide-de-Camp, General Burnside's Headquarters:

How are things progressing on the left? Tell Burnside to push hard with everything he can bring into the fight. If his Provisional Brigade is not in bring that up.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

MAY 12, 1864 - 10.20 a. m.

Major-General BURNSIDE:

Move one division of your troops to the right to the assistance of Hancock, and push the attack with the balance as vigorously as possible. Warren and Wright have been attacking vigorously all day. See that your orders are executed.

U. S. Grant,

Lieutenant-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMIES OF THE UNITED STATES,May 12, 1864 - 1.25 p. m.

Colonel BABCOCK,

Burnside's Headquarters:

Our whole force is now engaged. If General Burnside cannot hold his present line he must shorten it, strengthening his center and right toward General Hancock.

By command of Lieutenant-General Grant:

JNO. A. RAWLINS,

Brigadier-General and Chief of Staff.

MAY 12, 1864 - 1.45 p. m.

Major-General BURNSIDE:

Lieutenant-General Grant desires that such disposition of your colored troops and cavalry be made as best to cover the main supply train. He does not deem it necessary to hold the Spotsylvania and Fredericksburg road, if that would absorb any but an insignificant part of your present command, as the three white divisions and Provisional Brigade must be used where they are. You should to-night open a wagon road to connect with Hancock's left.

C. B. COMSTOCK,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Aide-de-Camp.

MAY 12, 1864 - 3.15 p. m.

Major-General BURNSIDE:

The Fifth Corps is now moving up to the Sixth and will together form a heavy column of assault. Keep your division commanders on the lookout to take advantage of any weakening on your front to meet it.

U. S. GARNT,

Lieutenant-General.
