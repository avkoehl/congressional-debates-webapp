a Deficient on December 31, 1864.

b In excess of all quotas.

It will be noticed that the Fifth District was deficient in furnishing her proportion of drafts previous to 19th of December, 1864, by 303 years of service, and that the Seventh District had furnished an excess of 2,274 years of service up to the same date. This latter excess has to be apportioned among and deducted from all the districts that the Sate may have credit therefor. In doing so it gives to the Eighth District eighty-six men, which is more than it is required to furnish under her enrollment and what it has already furnished. The following tabular statement will explain these irregularities:
