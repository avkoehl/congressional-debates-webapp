seen coming down this morning, and the Missouri Republican of the 28th June announces the flooding of the Missouri River and rise of the Upper Mississippi under the heading of "The June Rise." With the hard-working 1,200 negro force engaged and this prospect of a a rise we are in good heart. The project is a great one and worthy of success. In the next three days we expect to be ready for the water of the Mississippi. The fleets of Flag-Officers Farragut and Davis are awaiting the result with great interest. Seven of Flag-Officer Farragut's vessels, having passed Vicksburg at 4 in the morning of the 28th without silencing the batteries of the town, are anchored with Flag-Officer Davis' fleet of six mortar boats and four gunboats on the west side of Barney's Point. The mortar vessels of Commodore Porter and the remainder of Flag Officer Farragut's fleet remain below Vicksburg. Captain Davis arrived from Memphis the 1st of July.

To protect Commodore Porter's mortar fleet, lying close along the east bank of the river within range of the batteries of Vicksburg, but concealed from their view by a dense forest from the enemy's skirmishers, I have dispatched some 300 men, under Major Whittemore, Thirtieth Massachusetts, for picket and reconnoitering service on that side of the town.

In the next five or six days I hope to be in possession of much information regarding the batteries, their approaches, and the forces in support.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

T. WILLIAMS,

Brigadier-General Volunteers, Commanding.

Captain R. S. DAVIS,

P. S. - Lieutenant H. H. Elliott, brigade quartermaster, goes down for supplies and can furnish details not given here.
