General HANCOCK:

What is the result of your operations of this morning?

G. K. WARREN,Major-General.

SEPTEMBER 10, 1864.

General WARREN,

Fifth Corps:

We captured about 90 prisoners and secured the crest about the Chimneys. The enemy made one or two attacks to regain the position, and succeeded in capturing about 30 men from one flank of the new line, but they met with no great success. I am about going up to examine the line and will telegraph you again. The general is asleep.

C. H. MORGAN,

Lieutenant-Colonel.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND CORPS, September 10, 1864-9.45 p. m.

General O. B. WILLCOX,Commanding Ninth Corps:

GENERAL: In case of trouble on your extreme right (my extreme left) I request that you will direct one regiment to take the place between the new fort on your right and the old rifle-pit which your men built a few days since. I suppose that such are the orders. I think we will have a feverish, noisy night.

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General.
HDQRS. ARTILLERY BRIGADE, SECOND ARMY CORPS, September 10, 1864-8 a. m.

Captain JOHN N. CRAIG,Assistant Adjutant-General, Artillery, Army of the Potomac:

CAPTAIN: I have the honor to report the following operations of this command during the past twenty-four hours: About 3 p. m. yesterday the enemy opened fire upon a party of our troops on the plank road, and again still later upon our works, firing in all some twenty shots. This was promptly replied to by Ricketts' battery (F), First Pennsylvania Artillery, and Clark's (B), First New Jersey Artillery, and soon silenced.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Captain, Commanding.
