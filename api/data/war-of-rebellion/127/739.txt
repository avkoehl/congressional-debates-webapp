States. " In accordance with the instructions contained in those ordinance invitations were extended by me to the several classes of officers therein referred to, and many have presented themselves, have been accepted, and assigned to positions in the Virginia service. When the convention was agreed upon between the State and the Confederate Government no provision was made for these officers, and the consequence is that some officers of each of these classes hold no commissions in the Confederate service. They are, of course, receiving their pay regularly from the State treasury. As your ordinances have pledged the faith of Virginia to provide for these officers-a pledge given under the most solemn circumstances-I feel persuaded that it will be redeemed. I bring the matter to your attention for such action as in your wisdom may be deemed proper.

It is important that some action shall be taken at the earliest moment to put down the growing evil of extortion almost universally prevalent throughout the State. I desire that all branches of business shall be fairly and justly remunerative; that on whatever they may have to sell. The question is no longer one of fair profit, but it has become a question of how much can be extorted for a necessary article from the people. All things necessary for the comfort and support of the volunteers, who are exposing themselves in the public service and risking their lives and health in defense of our honor and independence, have been run up to an almost incredible price. All things necessary for the comfort and support of their families are run up in the same way. Unless something shall be done by you speedily to strangle this evil of extortion, a vast deal of suffering will be entailed upon the country. When the Legislature assembles much of the mischief will have been done, and hence my appeal to the convention to interfere. The volunteer who receives only $11 per month for his services cannot afford to supply his family with salt at from $20 to $25 per sack, and shoes, clothing, &amp;c., in like proportions. Men who are neither contributing physical nor pecuniary aid to the prosecution of the war should not be allowed to reap exorbitant profits. I suggest, therefore, with great respect, that this subject should claim early consideration.

* * * *

The terms of service of most of our volunteers will expire in the months of April, May, and June next, and I call your attention to the fact, that some action on your part may be taken to supply their places. The war must be fought out, and to do so successfully we must keep up our Army and provide for its continuance in the field until our independence is fully recld associates under the Federal Government. *

Respectfully,

JOHN LETCHER.
