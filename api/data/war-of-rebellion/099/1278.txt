approaches to the railroad as long as possible. One brigade was left on the south of Chester to guard that place and to communicate with General Cheatham. Butler is on the east of the enemy and I have told him to communicate with General Hardee.

I am, very respectfully, yours,

WADE HAMPTON,

Lieutenant-General.

CHARLOTTE, N. C., February 25, 1865-7 p. m.

NEWBERRY, S. C., February 25, 1865.

Lieutenant-General HAMPTON,

Commanding Cavalry:

SIR: I expect to move to-morrow with troops of mine and Cheatham's corps for Unionville, thence if practicable to Chester or Yorkville or Charlotte, according to information I may receive from you or others. You will do me the favor to forward accompanying letter to General Beauregard. *

Very respectfully, sir, your obedient servant,

ALEX. P. STEWART,

Lieutenant-General.

RALEIGH, N. C., February 25, 1865.

General BEAUREGARD, Charlotte:

Please advise me of Sherman's movements. If he comes by Charlotte I wish to move a large lot of quartermaster's stores.

Z. B. VANCE.

CHARLOTTE, N. C., February 25, 1865-1. 45 p. m.

Governor Z. B. VANCE,

Will keep you advised. Nothing important since you left.

ROCKFISH CREEK, February 25, 1865.

General R. E. LEE,

Petersburg:

Lieutenant-Colonel Anderson is the only officer of the department on duty with me, and the only one of any field experience now available. When his place can be supplied I will not object to his joining General Johnston. My staff is very deficient, my aides-de-camp having been legislated out of service.
