tion for the los&s sustained by him. I move

SAMUEL PIBBCE.
Mr. FERRY. I see that Senate bill No.
283, for the relief of Samuel Pierce, is entered
on the Calendar as being reported by me with-
out amendment. This is an error. The report
was adverse to the bill, and the report was
ordered to be printed. I should like to take
up the bill now and move its rejection, so as
to get it off the Calendar.
The VICE PRESIDENT. If there be no
objection, the bill will be regarded as rejected,
and taken off the Calendar.

upon. I hope that it will be taken up.

Mr. HARLAN. I desire to say that my
colleague yesterday morning submitted a reso-
lution, and gave notice that he would ask the
indulgence of the Senate for a few minutes to-
day to submit some remarks on the resolution.
My colleague does not wish to run over the
morning hour so as to interfere with the spe-
cial order for to-day; and I shall be glad if
the Senate will indulge him in that matter.
The VICE PRESIDENT. Reports of com-
mittees are now in order; but the Senator
from Iowa asks unanimous consent that the
resolution of his colleague may be called up.
