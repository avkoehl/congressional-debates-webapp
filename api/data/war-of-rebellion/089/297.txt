HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,October 21, 1864-9 a. m.

Major-General PARKE:

I propose to inspect your lines to-day with Lieutenant-General Grant. I desire General Crawford to be at the Fifth Corps headquarters, and General Parke at the Pegram house redoubt.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General, Commanding.

(Same to Brigadier-General Crawford.)
HDQRS. DEPT. OF VIRGINIA AND NORTH CAROLINA,In the Filed, Va., October 21, 1864.

Brigadier-General DYER, Chief of Ordnance, Washington, D. C.:

GENERAL: I learn through Colonel Serrell that you have examined the guns made by Mr. Ames, of Falls Village, Conn, which are represented as being able to stand a very heavy charge, and, of course, having long range and large penetrating power. We have, within 1,000 yards of us, the enemy's powerful iron-clads, which we desire to drive away. That being so, I would be glad for a couple of the guns with appropriate ammunition. What would you say to one rifled, to use the Sawyer shell or solid shot? The objection to the use of that shell having heretofore been the weakness of the gun. One of these guns bored to 5.82, and using the solid Sawyer shot with the rings, I think, would be able to penetrate the six and eight inches of iron with which the Virginia and Richmond are clad. How early would it be possible for me to have the guns? Allow me to congratulate you upon your promotion, which, from all I hear, has been well earned.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

BENJ. F. BUTLER,

Major-General, Commanding.

WASHINGTON, D. C., October 21, 1864.

(Received 10 p. m.)

General BUTLER:

Howitzers ordered form New York by express to Hampton Roads. I presume you wanted smooth-bores. At any rate I doubt whether we have six rifles to fill Graham's requisition. Anything we have in that line is at your service. Please declare those naval officers you sent up exchanges as soon as possible. they will fight better for their sojourn South.

Assistant Secretary of the Navy.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
