Have you any report from Lee?

S. A. HURLBUT,

Major-General, Commanding.

BATON ROUGE, November 17, 1864.

(Received 7.30 p. m.)

Major General S. A. HURLBUT:

The expedition was delayed at least twenty-four hours in starting by reason of the officer who was to capture Hodge backing down and coming back the next evening. We started nine privates on the same mission. Five of them returned to-day. They report that they got within two or three miles of Hodge's quarters, when, about 4 p. m Tuesday, they were attacked by twenty-five men, whom they fought and drove off, killing three. In crossing the river they had to pass a rebel guard, who became suspicious and chased them some distance. They killed the leader, a lieutenant-colonel. The other four men took the woods during the fight. No one was hurt. No news from any of the columns.

Brigadier-General.
