HEADQUARTERS THIRD DIVISION,July 24, 1864-8 p.m.

Colonel RICHMOND,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

COLONEL: I have the honor to report the usual state of things on my lines. Captain Roemer reports that the rebels are constructing a new work in front of Colonel Humphrey. He threw fire shells and drove off the working party temporarily. The working party of Fourth Division made excellent progress last night. Besides completing the covered ways and pits in progress, I shall start a new and I think better covered way from the second to front line. Permit me to suggest that guns might be put in position on General Warren's right, near his new mortar battery work, that would sweep nearly the whole ground in front of my division and part of General Potter's I have spent the most of the day on the lines and find my pits clean and clear for action.

Very respectfully,

O. B. WILLCOX,

Brigadier-General.
HDQRS. SECOND Brigadier, THIRD DIV., NINTH ARMY CORPS,July 24, 1864-7 a.m.

Captain R. A. HUTCHINS,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Third Division:

CAPTAIN: I have the honor to report the rifle-pits nearly finished. The covered ways are not so far advanced. Instead of 1,000 men, 730 reported and worked last night. About 600 men can finish the covered ways this afternoon, but they cannot work by day on the rifle-pit.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WM. HUMPHREY,

Colonel, Commanding Brigade.
