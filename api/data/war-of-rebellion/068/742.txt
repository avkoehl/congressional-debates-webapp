Major-General BUTLER:

After a severe conflict we have taken the enemy's works on his extreme right. Ammunition and provisions for this command should be sent here. I have not heard from General Ames since my last dispatch, or from any other portion of your command. I do not know where you are or where to communicate with you. I send this by way of the railroad over which one column of my command advanced. The troops have behaved splendidly.

Very respectfully,
