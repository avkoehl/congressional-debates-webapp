Naj. General R. E. LEE:

SIR: I had been misled by a letter of General Wise to you stating that he had a supply of twenty days' provisions on the mountain, and therefore had not anticipated the probability of any scarcity, and but for the storm of yesterday there could have been none. Two bridges between us need repair, which I hope will cause no particular delay. Provisions are going forward rapidly and considerable quantities are between here and Lewisburg. General Loring will reach here this evening with 2, 000 men, and will await our further orders; 400 of the riflemen and 100 of the cavalry of the Phillips Legion will also reach here this evening. I am ready at any moment to carry out any suggestion you have to make.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOHN B. FLOYD.

General R. T. BOWEN:

DEAR SIR: Your note of the 24th instant to General Floyd has just been received. I am istructed by him to reply that you will select 200 men from your command and send them to Boone County by way of Wyoming. If you can do so the general would prefer that these 200 men should be raised as volunteers from your command. If so many will not volunteer then you will select such as you think most fit. They will proceed to Boone and carefully watch and report the movements of the enemy in that quarter.

By order of Brigadier General John B. Floyd:
