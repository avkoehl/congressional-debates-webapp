Commodore H. H. BELL, U. S. Navy,

Commanding West gulf Squadron:

COMMODORE: A reconnaissance, made by order of Major-General Franklin toward the Mermenton River, develops the fact that there are four blockade-running schooners in that river, discharging freight from New Orleans. Two of these are British schooners - the Adelaide, which cleared for Matamoras August 16, 1863, and sailed September 2, and the Derby, and British schooner, which cleared August 29, and sailed September 2 for Balize, Honduras, via Matamoras. Cannot these vessels be caught?

Very respectfully, I am, commodore, your most obedient servant,

CHAS. P. STONE,

Brigadier-General, and Chief of Staff.

Honorable C. BULLITT,

Collector of Customs, New Orleans:

SIR: As it appears from undeniable testimony that several vessels, cleared from this port within the past three months, wearing foreign flags and bound to foreign ports, have violated the blockade, and been found supplying the enemy with goods directly from New Orleans, i deem it my duty to inform you that orders have been given from these headquarters that hereafter no vessel cleared for a foreign port south of New Orleans will be permitted to sail unless furnished with a sufficient military pass. Will you have the goodness to notify this fact to all applicants for such clearances?

Very respectfully, I am, sir, your most obedient servant,

CHAS. P. STONE,

Brigadier-General, and Chief of Staff.

Major General N. P. BANKS,

Commanding Department of the Gulf, in the Field:

GENERAL: The steamer Alabama goes to you with a full battery of artillery and some convalescent officers of the Thirteenth Army Corps.

Three schooners, which I have caused to be fitted up, will start to-morrow, to be towed to the Rio Grande. They will by loaded with extra artillery horses and forage.

I am expecting the arrival of coal from Pensacola hourly, and will cause it to forwarded as rapidly as possible.

The Saint Mary's sailed from Brashear this afternoon with General Washburn on board. She takes two regiments and 30,000 rations. She was not fitted up for horses, and could not, therefore, take the battery which I had intended to send by her without great delay. I have ordered the steamer Kate Dale to be taken here; she is of light draught, and will be loaded to-morrow with wagons and mules, and sent to Brazos Island. She will carry about 40 wagons and 80 mules, and will carry forward some of Dana's convalescents.
