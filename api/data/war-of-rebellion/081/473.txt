HEADQUARTERS U. S. CAVALRY EXPEDITION, June 27, 1864.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,Chief of Staff, Army of the Potomac:

My command struck South Side Railroad about fifteen miles from Petersburg, and at Ford's captured two trains with two good engines and sixteen cars. Tore up and burned the track at many places between that point and Blacks and Whites. At 4 p. m. 23rd Kautz reached Burkeville, burned depot and track, and pushed on toward Meherrin Station. The Third Division moved slowly, tearing up the track effectually. In the afternoon, near the Nottoway River, between Nottoway Station and Blacks and Whites, the Third Division met a division of rebel cavalry, W. H. F. Lee's, and after a sharp fight of several hours defeated them. The next day the whole command was reunited at Meherrin Station, from which place to Roanoke Station the railroad was completely destroyed. We could not get the Roanoke bridge, although a severe loss was experienced in the attempt. I think the road cannot be repaired in less than four weeks. The bearer will give you more details.
