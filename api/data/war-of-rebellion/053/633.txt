the command of the division commander, who, in the absence of other orders, shall employ it to support his own division.*
By command of Major-General Hindman:

J. P. WILSON,

Assistant Adjutant-General

ONE MILE EAST OF DR. ANDERSON'S,

September 10, 1863-11 a.m.

Major-General HINDMAN,

Commanding, &amp;c.,:

GENERAL: I send you all the cavalry I have. My corps will come very soon to support you. I will report in person at the head of my column. Please send back by courier or a staff officer any instructions you may desire to give me. My infantry are somewhat wearied, but I will move them forward as rapidly as I can.

Respectfully,

S. B. BUCKNER,

Major-General.

SEPTEMBER 10, 1863-11 a.m.

Major-General HINDMAN:

GENERAL: The enemy advanced with infantry and artillery to the creek, one-half mile from Davis' Cross-Roads, and drove back the cavalry. I saw Colonel Lowrey, who has an infantry force of about 500 men, at Dug Gap. I am falling back toward your position and watching the enemy; he has reached Davis' Cross-Roads with his skirmishers. I cannot get a [view] of his force, the woods are so dense.

Yours, very respectfully,

JNumbers T. MORGAN,

Colonel, Commanding Picket,

SEPTEMBER 10, 1863-12.45

Major-General HINDMAN:

GENERAL: A scout on the left of the road I am on (the main road on the eastern side of the valley on which I left you) reports the enemy advancing in force on Dug Gap, and says they are a mile east of Davis' Cross-Roads. They have not followed me any farther since my last dispatch.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JNumbers T. MORGAN,

Colonel, Commanding
