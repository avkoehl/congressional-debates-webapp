HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, near Chattahoochee, July 10, 1864.

General DODGE,

En route from Marietta:

The signal officer reports the railroad and other bridge burning. if this be so, the enemy will, of course, quit this sphere, and you should be duly vigilant at Roswell. Get there as quick as possible and fortify on the other side.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS LEFT WING, SIXTEENTH ARMY CORPS,Roswell, July 10, 1864-1.30 p. m.

Major-General SHERMAN:

My troops are arriving and crossing. I have been here three hours, and, in company with General Newton, have thoroughly examined the country. I will occupy and fortify to-night a tete-de-pont half a mile from the river, and extending up and down one mile, covering the entire ford, bridge, and roads leading to them. The ford is half a mile or more in extent, very rough, and impracticable except for troops. To bridge the stream I will have to build over 650 feet in length. I shall use the old piers, and trestle between. We have a strong picket out three miles covering the forks of road leading to McAfee's Bridge, eight miles up the river, and covering the forks of road that leads to Atlanta. It is too far out to take the command until the river is easily passed by artillery and trains.

G. M. DODGE,

Major-General.

ROSWELL, July 10, 1864-8 p. m.

Major-General SHERMAN:

Forces are all over river, hard at work fortifying. Have go batteries over also; have built a float bridge. The road bridge is a pretty big job, but will work hard on it. No force in my front that we can hear of.

G. M. DODGE,

Major-General.

General DODGE, Roswell:

I have been out all day; am just back. Have received General Garrard's and your dispatches. I design that General McPherson's whole army shall come to that flank, and you are to prepare the way. General newton will stay with you till you feel all sate, when he will rejoin his corps now in support of General Schofield, eight miles below you. General Garrard will picket the roads, and I want you to fortify a tete-de-pont and bridge. General McPherson will operate to the right and then when all is ready will come rapidly to your flank, therefore make all preparations to that end. General Schofield has a secure place opposite the mouth of Soap Creek. Keep me well advised by courier to Marietta, and telegraph.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
