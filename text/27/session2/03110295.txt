CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

to England, and the exultation of the Whig press at thatcir
cumstance Every shipment of specie to London was hailed
"With a shout of triumph and joy by those papers And now
Congress was to make this last effort to leceive such a state of
things—to drive the gold and sliver out of this country into the
hands of foreigners Let gentlemen go on and show their
hands more nakedly than they had yet done all he wished for
was a continuation of the issue between them and the people
The vote on this bill would be an additional record of that is
sue The people woull see by It who went foi the spurious
currency of broken banks, and who ¡or the hard money curren
cy that could not fail, who for the exportation ol gold and silver
that worthless paper might fill then place, and who for driving
out this haserag cuireucy and insuring an abu dance of the
precious metals Five years, he said, i he bank--—he spoke only
of thosesouth and west of 3Sew Yoik—had been in asíate of
non payment of their deb o Wnen they stopped, they all de
elated it was not for want of ability to pay, but because the
New Vork banks Stopped 1 hat excuse has long failed them,
but still they reluse to pay, an 1 this bill proposes one yeai Ion
ger to the banks in this District It was called suspension, but
itwas only a lefusnl to pay at their counters They paid in
New York, but shaved from five to ten pei cent upon their
notes in doing so Ml the banks south and west of New York
have been sending specie to that city foi five year", todiaw up
on at five or ten cent Theynadsent thutyfive millions there
which the cu&lo u house books showed had been shipped to
England
The banks of this Distuct, in common with all south and
west, have been shipping specie for five yeai s, and feeding the
people on trash—rotten uash—the offal of surrounding States —
and thH act was to authorize them to continue for a year, and
according to the argument used, to authorize them to continue
as long as Whigery was in power The argument for the sus
pension now is, that the Government has suspende J—that it
pays no more specie—that it only pays m depreciated paper—
and consequently that the banks must not pay specie till the
Government sets the example This is theargum'nt and ae
cording to that, there will be no resumption while Whigery is
in power, for paper money is all they have got, and all they
mean to have, and for the manufactureof which they now want
a central machine, w ith fifty two blanches
Mr BAYARD had but a word to say in lelation (o the ne
cessity—it was not that the community of the District wanted
coin, but banking capital He dwelt at some length in expla
nation of the dillerence -howuig how the dealers of the Distnrt
ate dependent on banks for capital, the banks themselves in
their own delence being undei compulsion to lend no more
than they have specie to íe leem
The question \ as tlu.n taken on the motion of M ALI EN to

Mr SEVIER said (hat if the banks in Miryllnd had con
menced specie pay ^eits, and the banks in Pennsylvania wtre
about to do so, the bill now befoie the Senate ought not to be
passed He thetefore moved topo tpone its further c msidera
tionforone week fn the puipo e of givmtr them an opportu
nitv to inquire into the lacts
Mr BAYARD again proposed his amendnent, which, mef
feet, is as follows That so much of the chattels o! the banks
as inhibí s tne ba ks in s ud act mentioned, from andafleithe
first day of March, 1842 fiom paying out, or lenhng out the
notes of any suspended bank oi any papei cu,iency whatever
whlJi is not equivalent to gold and silver, shall be, md Ihe
same is hereby, suspended in its opeiatiou until the ifst day
of March, 1843, un ess the banks o' Virginia and Maivland
shall before that time ie ume specie payments aftei which íe-
sumption the privilege gianted by this act shall cease and de
termine"                       ^                 ,  ,               ,
Mr BENTON moved to an end the amendment by mak
in  in read \ nginia or Maryland    He wished it  to be (lis
lunctive instead  of conjunctive      He   lead   from   (he   Bal
timorcSuna notice of the sudden increase of ihe quantity of
sneciem cuculation in that city, and at nbuted it to the par
tialresumpttinof the banks there, which was also noticed in
theouu    The people had i turned to the determinate i of
using specie and to carry out that object instead of passing oft
uncurrent paper such as fell into their hand-- had resorted to
the brokers, and sold it to get the    bar 1 stuff   to be used in
their daily purchases     He contended that Ihe taste f)r specie
would spread so iapidly,that this non S| ecle paying Disttict
would be inva led and captuiedm less time, and inoie effixtu
ally than the Capitol was captured by the Bntish if this lebate
wasnotstoppeimtime lo   pi event the example of Baltimore
from havm  its effect    He was in favor ol delaying the aciion
of Confess one week tosee what would be the effect of the
movements in Baltimore and I\ew Orleans where the people
were looking at the banks
Mr KERR said that he had just examined a newspaper from
Baltimore, and had seen nothing in it as to a movement on the
Dart of the banks to resume specie payments at this time That
subiect was now before the 1 egtslature of Marylan 1 and the
6r« day of May had been pioposed for that purpose   He would
tell the Senator from Missouri that if any attempt should he
made by a mob to disturb the public tranquillity in Baltimore,
the ui il authoi mes of the city would promptly interfere, and
he would feel the utmost moi tification, if information should
be brought to him that the "looks" of a mob had induced the
banks to resume
Mi BUCHANAN observed from his seat, that what the Se-
nator from Missouri had said was, that the people had looked at
the banks
Mr KERR made a few more comments on the subject to the
same effect as his preceding remarks
Mr BCNTON contended that, according to an old adage,
"A cat might look at a king,' and it would be a strange state
of thmsrs ifthe people might not look at the banks %
Mr WALKER remarked thet the people could not look into
them
Mr BENTON observed that if they could not ]ookmlo
them, they could look at them lie presumed it was at the
Whig papers of Baltimoie the Senator fiom Maiyland had
1 loked and that would account for his not having seen any thing
about the resumption of specie payments But it the Senator
would look at the Democratic papers, he would see all about it
He, Mr B held one in his hand, which the Senator might read
lfliep'ca«il He would find the fat t staled m It The Whig
papers weie ilways slow to find out the good news but here
was the Baltimore Sun, a Democratic papei,m which the fact
was stated
Mr KEUR admitted the Sun to be good anthonty Ifthe
Senator fiom Delaware would allow, he would suggest a modi
flcation to the amendment
Mr BAYARD inquired of the Senatoi from Missouri whether
he had not made a motion to amend
Mr BENTON said that he had, but he did not care any thing
about it
Mr KERR then suggested a verbai amendment, to which
Mr RAYARD had no obiection
Mr BUCHANAN moved to insert "Baltimore or Richmond,"
in the place of' Maiyland and Vnginia "
Mr LINN said that all the hanks in Baltimoie might not íe
Mr CLAY Let it then be the banks of Baltimore or Rich
mond generally
Mi BENTON said that he had just been informed by a gen
tleman from Maryland that the Mechanics' Bank of Baltimoie
had commenced redeeming l's issues He thought that they
hal better stop for twenty four hour , and wait until the cars
came m to morrow and theiefoie he moved that the Senate do
now ad]ouin
Mr B^ ARD de&ued that the bill might be engrossed to day
loi athird reading to monow
The question was taken on the motion to adjourn, md it was
decided in the negative—ayes 18 noes 22
The amendment of Mr Hazard as amended, so as to read
Baltimore or Richmond was then agreed to
The question now hems on Mi ^m ier s motion to pos pone
the bill for one we  it was ta^ci fj yeas and nays, and le
suited as follows—ayes 18, noes 2]
YEAS—Messrs Allen, Benton, Buchanan, c lhoun, Ful

Wooilbrulge—25
Tne bill was then repotted to the Senat", and ordeied to be
engrossed for a third reading
The Senate then went into an Executive session, and, af er
a short time spent therein, the dons weie opened, and it ad
jotimed.
