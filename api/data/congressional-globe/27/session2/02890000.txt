with then own sede of expenditures The senator charges
Mr. Van Burenes adminiatration widi an average expenditure of
thirty five millions annually, and estimate the expenditures of
this Administration attwenty four millions.
Mr CLA.Y interposed, 10 say that his estimate was not the
estimate of tins Administration He had only proposed a
scheme which appeared to him to be right, and made hía est!
mate ®n his own responsibility solely He begged of íheSená-
tor to separate his pl,m from the estimates oí the present Ad
mimstraiion, ano in bpeakmg of them to consider them as sen ,
rate and distinct                                                                       *
Mr WRIGHT explained, that it was not his purpose to mis-
represent the senator Hp had snowr that the expenditures
duung the last two years of Mr Van Buren's administration
had come down in 1839 to twenty five millions, and m 1840 td
twenty two millions Here was a rapidly decreasing expendí
ture.
Turn now to the new Administration, and see if the ratio of
decrease is pre erved Mr Í orward says, in page two oí his
ie[ ort, tnat the expendituies of the first three quarters of 1841
wei-e twenty <our and tWee quarter millions, and that the last
quar'et added, the whole expenduuie of ihe year would exceed
thirty two millions an increase of mo e than ten millions over
the expendituies ol the preceding year In this thirty two mil.
lions k may be said there are Tre jsury notes to be íedeemed in-
cluded, but leaving out theTieasury notee, the fact is at last ar-
rived at, that the expenditure of the year is twenty five and
thiee quaiter millions, without talking at all of Treasury
notes
He admitted that the expenses of the Government from '29 to
J39 had increased alarmingly This was owing to the surplus
ie venue, and it was only when the appropriations had to be cur-
tailed lor want of means-, that Congress began to see the folly of
the course it had been pursuing
He hadmeiely mentioned these thinsstoshowhowunfairand
unjust hrtd been the manner of presenting the expenditures o£
the la 1 Administra ion
Mi WriGiiT entered into many details which will be given,
m the loll leport of his speech hereaftei Ore point, however,
wecmnotoniit He showed that the present Secietary of the
Tiea&uiy, m his reply to the cal1 of the benate stated the pub-
lic debt, on the 4th oi Mulch last, to be eight millions—Ireasury
rote* ar 1 every other outstandu g demand included Now the fact
lb hat tneiewas at ¡east a million oí dolíais of these Treasury
r í es counted ml I e e ght million-, which wa*s tefpiethe4thof
iMaich,actually paid off, having been taken up'atthe land
oiTioes, at the time this amount was included in the eight mil-
lions, as apart ol ihe debt Trom the pecuhar circumstances
under which the last two administrations were placed—op-
pressed by asurp'us revenue—and driven by Congressional ap-
pi opriations lar beyond their estimafes—he showed that the large
e ^penditures for which they weresojunjustly reproached, were 
enurely beyond their control
He thpn contracted the relative positions of?the past and pre^
sent Administrations, and asked what had been the real condition
oí things? TheoneAdmimstrationexpandingfromasurplusre-
venue up to the la-^t two years of its, term, and then letrenching;
and the other commencing with an empty Treasury, and ex-
panding its expenditures 10 the ratio of its embarrasbments
^ otwithstanding the able argument of the Senator from Ken-
lucky m support of his íesolutionb it had not yet been made ap-
parent to him thataftei the restoration of the landfund, it would
be necessaiy to exceed a tanfl of 20 per cent The Senator
bates his calculation on expenditures amounting to twenty two-
millions, and then goes into calculations to show how that sum
is to be met In these calculations he assumes that the value
of duty paying importa will not exceed ninety one millions for
some yeais to come
Mr Wright here entered into an examination of the\imports
for a senes of years, coming down to 1840 when the table of
co nmcice states them at one hundred and seven millions He
desired to know what circumstances existed which might make
the imports of lSiO too high for an average of years past? It
certainly could not be sai 1 that the country was in a condition
to encourage excessive impoiisduimg thatyeai, and he thought
on the contraiy, there was much to induce the belief that one
hundí e 1 and seven wasundci an average But even taking the
Senator's (súmate ut duty paying imports at the annual
average of ninety one million*, foi sume years to come, it
h l'lUto^en prove t thai the twenty per cent of the compiu-
¡ eact wo dd te 11 aiequi eto the wants of an economical

111II10 , H the ucotne h n lAni'o at. three millions, and that
gives fio o twenty one and a half to twenty two millions Now,,
it from the iapid\ymcieat>ed expenditures when the Treasury
was oveifl ivu i  it  the exhaustion of the Treasury, expendí
tuies had come down to twenty two millions, what was to pre-
vent the Government horn being carried on successfully and
