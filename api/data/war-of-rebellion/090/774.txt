HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE SUSQUEHANNA,Harrisburg, Pa., August 11, 1864.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: The day I left this place for Pittsburg, August 1, I created the District of the Brandywine, which included from the Cumberland Valley to Philadelphia, and assigned General Cadwalader to the command. The emergency having passed, it seems proper, together with other reasons, to discontinue that district, but before doing so I would like to know if it is the intention of the War Department to continue General Cadwalader in command of defenses of Harrisburg. There does not seem to be any necessity for his being here now, although it is perfectly agreeable for me to have him. My opinion is that after the district is broken up the would prefer returning to Philadelphia, where, in my opinion, his presence is demanded.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

D. N. COUCH,

Major-General, Commanding Department.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE SUSQUEHANNA,Harrisburg, Pa., August 11, 1864.

Colonel E. D. TOWNSEND,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Washington, D. C.:

COLONEL: I respectfully state, in consequence of being absent at Chambersburg and McConnellsburg, I did not see the message* of His Excellency Governor A. G. Curtin, of the 9th instant, to the Legislature of Pennsylvania, until this evening. There in is a copy of a letter addressed by me to the honorable Secretary of War, dated Harrisburg, July 22, 1864, which came into the Governor's possession and was published in this manner: He applied for a copy of my communication to the Secretary on the subject of organizing the border militia. I telegraphed to Major John S. Schultze, assistant adjutant-general, the following:

PITTSBURG, August 4, 1864-9 a. m.

Major SCHULTZE,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Harrisburg:

Give the Governor a copy of my letter or plan to organize the militia of the border counties with his indorsement.

D. N. COUCH,

Major-General.

A copy of the letter as above was sent to him by mistake, as accompanying the plan with his indorsement, when only the plan was intended to have been furnished. This is matter of regret to me, as my official letters and reports to the War Department are never given to any parties.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

D. N. COUCH,

Major-General, Commanding Department.
