propriety, and value of thesubjectupon which an
expenditure is made, or whether it is to be determ-
ined by the mere amount of dollars and cents
expended. I contend, and I think no gentleman
wifi contradict it, that the true principle of econ-
omy must be determined by the necessity, pro-
iriety, and value of the subject of expenditure;
.or one thousand dollars may be lavishly and
prodigally thrown away, whale millions may be
usefully and economically expended upon sub-
jects of great importance and value to the nation.
If this be the true standard to test the economy
of the Administration, it will, all circumstances
considered, bear a safe comparison with any pre-
ceding Administration, It is true it exhibits more
in amount, except during the late war; yet, when
the subjects upon which the excess of expendi-
ture has been made, are taken into the account, its
reasonableness and propriety are made manifest,
and every suspicion of prodigality dissipated.
The following table presents a comparative view
of the expenditures of this Administration with
the two preceding. It exhibits the aggregate of
the ordinary ana usual expenditures, as also of
the extraordinary, and such as will not be per-
manently incorporated into the annual expendi-
tures of the Government:

The aggregate expenditure of Mr. Adams's
administration was$50,501,913 21. Thefirst four
years of this Administration is $57^70,480 62;
excess, $5,768,567 41. This excess of expend-
iture by this Administration for the first four
years_ over the preceding four years, is to be
principally found under two heads, miscellaneous
and military. In the miscellaneous, embracing
a large number of private claims to an amount
never before allowed, the excess of expend-
iture in this over Mr. Adams's administration is
#2,798,081 98; and in the appropriations for the
military department, embracing pensions, Indian
annuities, purchase of Indian lands, and various
Indianappropriations, the excess is $4,316,19092,
making in bath of those branches an excess of
$7,114,271 83; from which take the balance be-
fore stated, oí $5,768,567 41, leaves a balance of
ordinary expenditures of $1,344,704 42 in favor
of this Administration; but from this must be
deducted $1,000,000 paid by Mr. Adams's ad-
ministration towards the treaty of Ghent, leaving
the net balance of $344,704 42; and this, too,
under the circumstances of increased population,
largely increased commerce, and increased for-
eign relations. 1 challenge, under these two
heads of appropriation, to be shown a single im-
proper, injudicious, or prodigal item of appro-
priation. These calculations are made exclusive
of the public debt. . The annexed table presents
a comparative view of the expenditures of this
Administration, embracing the estimates for the
current year, in comparison with the eight pre-
ceding years, inclusive and exclusive of the public
debt, showing in what way the expenditures of
this Administration have been increased, either
in its ordinary expenditures or on extraordinary
objects. I invite particular scrutiny, and feel no
doubt that it will remove from the Administra-
tion the slightest imputation of prodigality. The
items of increase are such as have been sanc-
tioned by Congress, and such as the country,
with some few exceptions, will generally approve.
.Mr. BELL rose and said, he did not charge
that the general expenditures of this Administra-
tion exceeded those of the late Administration.
His charge was, that those branches of the public
expenditures which were most liable to suspicion
* Exclusive of extraordinary expenditures estimated for
1836.
and abuse, and which depended upon the discre-
tion of the officers, had increased under this Ad-
ministration.
Mr. GARLAND. I am gratified that the hon-
orable gentleman so explains, and it relieves me
from the necessity of saying much more upon
this subject.
But if, upon the most fastidious principles of
economy, the charge -of .extravagance can be sus-
tained, it is not chargeable upon the executive
administration, but upon Congress. As a proof,
I here exhibit a table showing the estimate made
and recommended by the Executive, and the ap-
propriations made, by Congress, embracing the
years 1831, 1832, 1838,1834, and 1835, in which
it will be seen that the appropriations made by
Congress exceed the estimates of the Executive
by $15,418,495 03:

Upon What principle, I would ask, can the
Administration be held responsible for the prod-
igal appropriation by Congress.' Upon none
that I can perceive. Congress is particularly
charged by the Constitution with appropriations
of the public money. The Administration does
not elect the Representatives, but the people do
it; and it is for the people sustaining the prin-
ciples of the Administration to elect such Rep-
resentatives as will sustain and carry out those
principles which they demand at the hands of the
Administration, <Jr it is impossible the Adminis-
tration carl effect its wishes. Some how or other,
upon some subjects, the friends of the Adminis-
tration have nevefr been united, and have thus
thwarted the efforts of the Executive to carry
out some of its valuable and important principles.
The President cannot, with reasonable propriety,
veto money bills within thejcoustitutional power
of the Government; hence the respoa&ibihty for
the faüure of the Administration to reduce the
expenditures of the Government to a great extent
rests with the people themselves. The cure of
the evil i  nlnne in their hands. In 1833, from
the increase of the pension list, the Indian war,
purchases of Indian lands, and various other
causes, theexnenditure of the Government, greatly
increased; butinl834 diminished about $4,000,000,
also in 1835 about $1,000,000, as will be seen from
the following table:   ,

The expenditures under this head were about
$500,000 greater in 1834 than in 1833.   The fol-
lowing items will show the sources of most of
their increase:
