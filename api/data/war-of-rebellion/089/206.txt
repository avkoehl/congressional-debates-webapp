HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,October 13, 1864-9.15 a.m.

Brigadier General S. WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

I have the honor to report that all was quiet in my front last night and through the day. A detail was at work yesterday making a heavy slashing in front of the picket-line on our right in General Bragg's front. This part of the line has been very much strengthened by being intrenched and by slashing the timber in front. The advancing of this portion of the line gives to us an excellent view of the enemy's works. Our signal officer on Squirrel Level road reports that the enemy seem to have increased their picket force on that portion of their line in his view. Two deserters from Sixty-fourth Georgia were received and sent up yesterday.

Respectfully,

S. W. CRAWFORD,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
