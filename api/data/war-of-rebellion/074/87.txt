HEADQUARTERS FIFTEENTH ARMY CORPS,Before Atlanta, Ga., August 4, 1864.

COLONEL: I have the honor to report that about 10 o'clock yesterday morning I caused my skirmish line to advance against that of the enemy, driving them from their pits, which we took possession of after a short but spirited skirmish. At about 1 o'clock the enemy reorganized in stronger force and advanced against the position taken, driving my troops from the pits and reoccupying them. At about 4.30 p. m. I caused my skirmishers to be re-enforced, and ordered them to retake the lost position, which they did quickly and in gallant style. The engagement was severe but of short duration. The position is an important one to us, and is now as securely held as a strong line of skirmishers can hold it and can be occupied by my troops at any time you may suggest. We captured about 140 prisoners. Our loss was 11 killed, 81 wounded, and 3 missing; total, 95. (See inclosed report.) The troops engaged were those of the Second and Fourth Divisions, Brigadier-Generals Lightburn and Harrow commanding, respectively.

HEADQUARTERS FIFTEENTH ARMY CORPS,In the Field, near Lovejoy's, Ga., September 3, 1864.

COLONEL: I have the honor to report the following summary of the part taken by my command since leaving the West Point railroad, at Sideling Station, on the morning of the 30th ultimo:

In obedience to orders, I moved from my position at Sideling at 7 a. m., on the Jonesborough road, with the division of Brigadier-General Hazen in front, through Renfroe Place, crossing Shoal Creek. A short distance east of Shoal Creek my advance skirmishers met those of the enemy posted behind rail piles, and sharp firing was commenced and continued every few hundred yards to Flint River, our skirmishers driving those of the enemy quite rapidly. The enemy opened artillery at one point, when I caused some guns to be placed in position, and their fire returned, and at the same time sent forward a body of flankers, which soon caused them to
