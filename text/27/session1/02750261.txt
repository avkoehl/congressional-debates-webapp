So he resolution was adop ed
The iu ei part of the resolution (that which allows brief ex

Mr MARSHALL asked the general consent oí tne House at
this timu to pre&euta petition prajmg tne passage of a uniform
bankrupt law, and wa^ understood to say that, is he suouldt
hi nseii votea^ains such a measure, he det>nect to say few words

M PICKENS remarking that the House had the other day
refused a sun lar favoi to -him, objected
Mt P however, withdrew his objection, which wasimme
diately lenewulby other gentlemen some oí them re narking
that tney had in the r possession petitions of a similar charac
ter, which tliey were desirous to present
Mi MARSHALL then moved that petitions generally in re
latmn to a hmkmpt law be received
The SPEVKER said this could only he done by general
coisent, as, under a new rule of the House, the order of
buoineaa could not othei wise besuspended during the morning
hour
Ojjection was made in several quarters So the motion could

REVENUE BILL
So the House resolved itself into Committee of the Whole,
on the S„ate of the Union, (Mr Lushing of Massachusetts m
the chair) on the bill in relation to duties and drawbacks
The puidmg question being on the motion of Mr Atherton,
to strike out the enacting clause of the bill-
Mr JAMES IRVIN, who was entitled to the floor, rose and
ad Iressed the committee during the hour He argued that the
present bill before the committee proposed taxing certain ne
cessaiy aitides, which was impolitic, unwise, ana against the
interesrsofthepQOrer classes of people He admitted the ne
cessity of raising íevenue to meet the current expenses of the
Government,.andaIso to piovide for the existing deficiencies,
but proposed levying a tax upon luxuries, such as silks, wines,
&c , and, as agieat measure oí lehef to the country and of
finance, proposed to stop the future acti  n of the compromise
act 30 fai as relate5* to turthei action on foreign articles coming
in competition with American industry In the course of his
rernaiks, Mr I referred to the remarks of Mr McKbon, made
some days ago on the subject ofdnect taxation
Mr McKEON asked leave to explain
S vera! gentlemen objected
Mr IRVIN courteously yielded the floor for explanation
Aír McKLON sai 1 that he was extremely jndebt d to the
gentleman fiom Pennsylvania lor the liberty given him, which
had been denied him by peveial othei * Briefly, then, the gen
tleman from Pennsylvamahad said that he Mr McK on sober
sec ind thoughts had come to the conclusion that he would not
pu dish what heeaidthe other day in re'ation to direct taxation
The gentleman was mistaken his íemaik* on that occasion
would be published, and that shoitly fie would repeat again,
what he thensiid JDuect taxation was the tiue Oemocranc
ground It was the fa rest and most economical mod of ob
taming i leverme fo the support of the Government, and would
Var lighter mtí e pioductive Hasse3 than the piesent mode
The gentleman will bear me wuneás, though, that I also taid
thatthet>e weie my o^n opinions only, that! di 1 not pretend
tospeak f)rotheis,and that Idi I not expect to live to see the
day when this punciple would be alopted
Mi   IRVIN said he did not hen that
Many gentlemen from several parts of the hall, said, "we
distinctly remember it"
Mr McKEON continued Well many gentlemen did hear
me I repeat again said he, whatl then «said With the gen
tleman fiom South Carolina [Mr RnsTrJIdid not pretend to
speak for any paity, or for any bo ly but myself, and what I
said wa1? without consultation with others
Mr IRVIN then continued his speech till his hour had
elapsed, when the chairman interposed, and Mr I took his
seat
Mr BARNARD addressed the committee on the general po-
licy and provisions of the bill
Mr BARNARD was followed bv Mr WINTHROP, who,
while he admitted that the sum proposed to be raided by this
bill wasnot greater,if so great, as would be needed, objected
to the mode of laying the duties, as not founded on a sufficient
knowledge of the deta Is of the subject He could not vote for
the bill in Us present form, but hoped it would be amended
bysubstnuting a dnect specific duty on particular articles,
such as silk*, stuff goods, fruits and spices, winch he contended
would he within the provisions of the compromise act
Mr W was followed by Wr RANDOLPH, who indicated
his purpose to piupose to amen 1 the bill by imposing a duty of
20 pel cent upon milroad iron and to exempt silk plu&h and
soda ash from duty altogether
Mr R then went into some general observations on the past
and present condition of the Tieasury, and argued to show the
necessity of Tugmenting the revenue as proposed in the bill,
which he hoped would undergo some amendments, but for
which he should vote even in its present form
Mr EVTRETT ne\t iddressel the committee in a speech
which was delivered in ^o low atone, that with difficulty some
porti )ns of non y eonld b° heard At the Reporter ' beats it

SENATE'S   BAMi   BILÍ
A message w?s leceived from ihe Senate, thiough Ashuiy
Dickms, £=q ¡Secretary stating that that body had passed a bill
to incorpórate the subsctibers to a Fiscal Bank of the United
States, and askms iheconrmrtnce oflhisHoui,e therein
On motmn of Mr SERGEANT, the bilí had its first and
second reading, was referred toa Committee of the Whole on
the slate of the Union, and ordered to be printed
Mr WI ?L expi e&sed his hope that it would be considered at
aseirlya daya5" possible
Mr  ^rRGL^NTconcunedin this desire
Mi PiCKENS inquired which bill would have the pre
cedence that from the Sena! , or the bill which had been
reported to the House from the Committee of Ways and
Means?
The CHAIR lephedthat would be for the Committee of the
Whole to determine
Mr PICKENS knew that but wished to understand whrh
of the two bills the gentleman from Pennsylvania meant
to press''
Mr &ERGEANT said, in reply, he should prefer the bill
from, the Senate thouah he would now oe understood to say
that it mismt not need some amendments
Mi PICKENS suggested the propriety of referring the
Senate bill in the fii3t place to the CommitU-o oí Ways and
Means
[Cries of ro ' no ']
Mr 1JNG8RSOIL wi lied to hare the rules suspended, that
p tuions on the bank: upt bill might not be presented but be
fore an v decision on this motion,
The House adjourned
IN SENATE,
Thursday, July 29,1841.
Mr. MANGUM said he was instructed by ihe
Comrai'tee on Naval Affairs to repon without
amendment the House bill for the eUabli hment of
a home squadron    He was also instructed to re-
port the House bill to provide for Navy pensions
wiih an amendment.
Both bills were banded to the Secretary of the
W
mi
Senate, and the presentation oí memorials and j -
Utions being m rrder,
Mr MOUTON presented the memorial of Wot*-
sieur Gonon, in relation to his system of telegraph-
ing. Mr. M. spoke of the vast advantages that
would be likely 10 result from the adoption of this
system in time of war, and moved its reference to
the Committee on Mih'ary Affairs.
Mr HUNTINGTON suggested that it had bet-
ter he on the table for the present sesuon, and be
ac ed on at tie first regular session.
The memorial, however, was referied to the
Ccranmi tee on Military Affairs.
The Hou«e bill,  No 6, was then taken up and
re d.    It was that reported from the Commute 
on Naval Affairs, by Mr. Mangdm, providing for   .
navy  pensions, with an amendment to strike oat
ihe second section.
The bill Demg under consideration, as in com-
miitee of the whole,
Mr MANGUM said the proposition of theCom-
mrtfe on Naval Affairs to strike out the second
SfCtion, a o«e out of the impossibility of under-
standing it It was a'togelher unintelligible to the
commntee, and appeared unnecessary a' presen'.
He would, therefore, move to strike it out.
Mr WOODBURY said there seemed to be no
necv.-sity at the present session for going beyond
the objects contemplated in the establishment of the
navy pension fund. He was willing to go as far
■es it was originally intended the pension system
ih/uld gc. The «econd section, if he understood
it, hid thi* object in view: according to the pre-
sent construction of the Mavy pension bill, officers
on retired pay or in «ervice wnh full pay, may re-
ceive full pensions al«o: but this section was to
present that, and make such regulations as tbatany
officer drawing pay from the Treasury, shall not
draw more from the pension fund, if entitled to
draw any, then, added to what he receives from
ihe Treasury, shall amount to the full pay he
would have according to his grade in the service.
He was opposed to snkingout this limitation and
thought the ambiguity oí the section could be
remedi-d by a «uitable modification.
Mr. ftlAlfCUM said he thought there was ao
nec^sity for ihe sreond section now; (he whole
system wanted revision and that could be accom-
plished at the next regular session of Congress.
The first section, being the mere appropriation,
wai all that was required to be passed at the present
session.
Mr. WILLIAMS was acquainted with this
whol" subjtct. They were now paying pensions
lo ofieers who are on full par; and not, nly that,
but had carried back the date to the time the disa-
hlity was received, wh ch, in some cases, was
forty ye^rs ago, in addi'i n to all which, they had
added the widows of all those officers who d*ed in
service He ihought it woul! be as well to pay
the pensn > s f the 1st of January next, and then
to p'ace ih" navy pension on the 'ame iy tem wuh
the land cervice There had been a continual
straggle of officers of the army to be placed on an
equality wnh thi^e of the navy. Such a request
was just—both ouiht to be placed on tbe same
t< oung, and he should go forplac ng the navy pen-
s on system where the military <tood. Mr W.
showed how, by the law of 1837, the #1,900,000
of the navy pension fund had been exhausted, and
still there wa* a call for 0139,000 more, lo be rrct
from ihe Trea uiy of the United Stales
Mr. HUNTINGTON said, with regard to Ihe
Kt section, there could be no douitof the proprie-
ty and necessity < f passing that. Every one in
the Senate was acquainted with the manner in
which this funl had been exhausted, and how it
ame to be diverted from its legitimate channel.
The simple question was, whelher they would pass
tie law, or virtually repeal it by withholding the
a ipiopnation. He agreed wrh the Senator from
New Hampshire that it would be we!l k take tip
the whole subjee1, and see ho v fir it m'git be mo-
dified or repealed. That, however, wou'd be for
after consider ition, but the fai h of tbe nation
stood pledged for the paym nt of these peisons
under the law, and it was no matter whether the
fund was exhausted or no', oi whatever d ffi- ^
cullies or  embarrassments   there might be, the
