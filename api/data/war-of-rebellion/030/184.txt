Five hundred rebel cavalry encamped last night at Mrs. Hamer's farm, 4 miles from Brentwood. To the left of Wilson's pike, 2 miles beyond Brentwood, on a lane leading east, two regiments of infantry, three pieces of artillery, and some cavalry were encamped. Saturday night a citizen named McNary, living 1 mile beyond Brentwood, is reported as aiding in the capture of Stokes' men yesterday. Your circular of to-day will have prompt attention.
