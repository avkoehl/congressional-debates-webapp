APRIL 18, 1861.

Major CLARK, Quartermaster, U. S. Army, Baltimore:

Two or three Massachusetts regiments may reach Baltimore in the next three days, and one New York regiment. Hasten the latter to this place. On of the Massachusetts regiments must be turned off to Harper's Ferry, unless it be known that the establishment has been captured. If a fourth Massachusetts regiment by mistake arrive at Baltimore by rail instead of Fort Monroe by sea, send it down the bay to that fort.

WINFIELD SCOTT.

COLUMBUS, OHIO, April 18, 1861.

Honorable SIMON CAMERON, Secretary of War:

We had made arrangements with the Baltimore and Ohio Road to transport troops, and Mr. Garrett was anxious to take them until late last night, when he declined, on the alleged ground that the Washington Branch will employ all his empty cars in transportation of troops.

This looks ominous. We hope Harper's Ferry is safe.

W. DENNISON,

Governor of Ohio.

PHILADELPHIA, April 19, 1861.

SIMON CAMERON, Secretary of War:

We are informed here that the troops sent last night have been stopped at Baltimore, and that it is impracticable to send more through that city. Shall we send them by steamer to Annapolis?

J. EDGAR THOMSON.

S. M. FELTON.

PHILADELPHIA, PA., April 19, 1861.

Honorable SIMON CAMERON, Secretary of War:

SIR: Having arrived at Philadelphia, we are informed by the Baltimore road that Governor Hicks states that no troops can pass through Baltimore City; in fact, the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad refuse to transfer. We will wait for instructions.

J. EDGAR THOMSON.

S. M. FELTON.

WASHINGTON, April 19, 1861.

To. S. M. FELTON:

Governor Hicks has neither right nor authority to stop troops coming to Washington.

Send them on prepared to fight their way through, if necessary.

By order of the Secretary of War:

L. THOMAS,

Adjutant-General.
