If these pontoons are to be used only on the line of the canal, these animals had best remain here, if the pontoons are wanted in the interior above. These animals and the trucks will require the effective force still here for their guard on the march, being about 400 men. Will the general please direct if the labor here of unloading boats and refitting pontoons shall be left to the small working force of 135 men, and, if so, whether the balance of the command shall move up with or without the animals and the trucks? I cannot but feel that he will approve my awaiting his decision while all in readiness for it.

It is reported that a force of 6, 000 infantry and cavalry moved from Snicker's Gap to Hamilton yesterday afternoon. They were in camp at that place last night. I think a still larger force moved out as far as Round Hill.
