noi i n hkely to otcui again For mstanSe, éu,&íl,000 was
expended m paying off the Treasury note= , which were issued

tbf expenses of Mr Voams's adminiístration were only
thirteen millions Now ne would say, that duung Mr. Adams's
adrnt^isf Trttion, the ordinary expenses might have been thirteen
millions only, but that taking the extiaordmary expenses with
(hem, they amounted to at least thnty millions. Again, there
was a tru^t fond belonging to the Indians, the disburyementsof
which were f«r their use, and therefore did not come withm the

Merac r °h and pemKns uer<" prfgenfed by
Me^r*. YOUNG, ALLEN, BUCHANAN, and
SOUTHARD
Mr YOUNG &aid that he had been requested to
p-esent lo the Senate, for •h'- c tnr'dcraton of Con-
gress, a memorial sigucd by seventy orie citizens of
the county of Peon , m the S'ate of Hlmoi^y on
the subiect of ihe abolition of slavery in the Slates
of ihe American Union, and its dependent Territo-
ries He bawl 'hat it had doub'1-ss been written,
an 1 with much ca*r, by a clergyman ofhisac-
qu-t'ntattle, the Rev. Jenet Rnof, and was
ivi U    nature of a remonstrance sgamst the
system -u pre-en pvow^d and acted upon
by ihe Abol iioni^tbof the North, for ih- purpose
oí cfT ctingthe objects contetnptat<-d by their nume-
mub petmoos to Congress. That be was alio ac-
quainted with the character of many of the sub-
scribers to tlie memorial, and knew them to be mea
of intelligence and respectability. Many of them
were profesar* of Christianity, and ail, he "wouid
add, opposed to the insti'Mion of slavery, both in,
theory and in practice. But they were neverthe-
lees the tuends of the Constitution, of good order,
and of peace—the friends of civil end religious li-
berty 'hrouehout the world; andas mschasthey
desired to see the abolition of slavery, noi onlym
the Territories, but in the Spates of the Union, and
the universal emancipation of mankind throughout
the globe, they were still unwilling that it should
be brotight about by foreign influence* the union of
Cbu'ch and Sia'e, or at the expense of the Consti-
t ilion and peace of the country. He said they pro-
tected, in the strongest lenguaje, against the pro-
posed connection of the Episcopacy with the politi-
cal power of thecmn'iy, for the purpose of accom-
plishing this, or any other ob]ect, and eschewed,
with becoming &p«nt «s American freemen, all
British and foreign mterfsrence m the civil institu-
