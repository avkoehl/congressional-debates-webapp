HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF GEORGIA,Augusta, January 30, 1865-1 p. m.

Brigadier-General IVERSON,

Commanding Cavalry:

GENERAL: Your falling back so far did seem to me most extraordinary. You may have been justified by the nature of the country, but I still think that, under your instructions, you committed an error. It certainly has caused me no little annoyance and embarrasssmennt. However, as I knew you personally, and did not know your command, I thought it must be due to the material with which you, were dealing. In this I may have done them, as well as you, injustice. If so, I am sorry for it. But my experience with the cavalry in this war has not been favorable, and I have made no secret of my opinion. I hope to be no Brier Creek this week and to have an interview with you.

Very respectfully,

D. H. HILL,

Major-General.
