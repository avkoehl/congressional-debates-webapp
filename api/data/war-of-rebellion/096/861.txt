Lieutenant-General GRANT:

Lieutenant Michie's nomination as brevet major is not confirmed. He is about accepting the appointment of assistant inspector-general Twenty-fifth Army Corps to support his family. His services to this army as chief engineer are not to be dispensed with. He is worth his weight in gold as an engineer. Cannot he be promoted to brevet major? He richly deserves it by untiring industry, exposing his life frequently, and the practice of skill in the most important and responsible positions. I would only part with him as chief engineer to give him a division as brigadier.
