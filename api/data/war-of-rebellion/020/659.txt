27th. The city must always be provided with at least fifteen days' provisions for 10,000 men, with the same quantity in a convenient depot, not nearer than 30 miles from the city, along the Central Railroad, so as to be beyond the reach of the enemy in every contingency.

28th. Ample supply of fuel should be made for the steamboats and for the troops forming the garrison of the city.

29th. The city authorities must see that the supply of water be ample for all emergencies in case of a bombardment.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. T. BEAUREGARD,

General, Commanding.

P. S.-It is ordered that all laborers employed on the interior of the city lines of defenses, except those employed on the magazines, should be at once concentrated; first on the salient faces of the advanced lunettes and cremailleres, except those from fort Mercer inclusive to Fort Brown, then on the salient faces of the retired lunettes or redans, then on the shoulder faces of the first class and afterward of the second. The banquettes of Fort Brown must be put forthwith in proper condition. No labor must be expended on the finish of the above works, which must be put, with their batteries, magazines, &amp;c., in a fighting condition as soon as possible, even if we should have to work day and night. Should you not have laborers enough for such a purpose you must call on the Governor of the State for additional ones. I earnestly request that the utmost activity should be shown in every department of the service, so as to be ready in time for any intended attack of the enemy. I have called for five 10-inch or 13-inch mortars and twenty heavy or long-range guns (five 10-inch and five 8-inch columbiads, five 42-pdrs. rifled, and five 32-pdrs. rifled), which will be distributed to the best advantage when received on river defenses and line of outworks.

Armament of interior line of works at Savannah, Ga., October 28, 1862.
