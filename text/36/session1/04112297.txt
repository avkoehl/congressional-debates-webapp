Mr. HARRIS, ofVirginia. I desire to say that
last week Mr. Leake was called home to attend
to the defense in an important criminal case, in
which he was employed before he took his seat
in Congress. I think, under the circumstances,
as he is performing a duty which was imposed on

left the House within the past half hour, and since
this call commenced, for the reason, as he in-
formed me, that he was too unwell to remain. I
know that he had complained of ill-health during

for him to remain longer. I move that he be ex-
cused. _

Mr. HARRIS, ofVirginia. I move that Mr.

Cadwalader C. Washburn.
Mr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois.,. The geotle-
man from Wisconsin, is, absent fronj the city, I
move that he be excused.
Mr. STEWART, of Maryland. I think all
members who are absent from the city ought to
be excused. If you do not do it, the Seigeaat-
at-Arms, under the order of the House, wij] have
to go after them; and it will be attended with con-
siderable expense, either to the Government or to
the unfortunate members sent after. '

fore he could get to Wisconsin. ' '

the motion.

Warren Winsloiv,.
Mr. CURRY. I noticed this morning, while
the Japanese embassy were upon the floor, that
the gentleman from North Carolina was devoted
in his attentions to them. I suppose he is extend-
ing proper notional courtesies now to the grea,i
Tycoon, and I move that he b§ excused. [Laugh-
ter.]
Mr. FLORENCE. Is that "the same old
coon?", [Laughter.]
Mr. VANCE. He has paired off with the gen-
tleman from Jeddo. [Renewed laughter.]
The motion was not agreed to. -
John Wood. No excuse offered.
Samuel H. Woodson. No excuse offered,
Mr. BRANCH. The roll has now been called
through for excuses; and I move that further pro*-
ceedings in the call be dispensed with.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Tiie Chair, re-
ports to the House that there is no quorum in the
Hall yet.
Mr. BRANCH. We may as. well have the
yeas and nays on my motion while the Sergeant-
at-Arms is going after the absentees.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Sergeant-
at-Arms has not yet been ordered to go after the
absentees.
Mr. SHERMAN. I move that the Sergeant-
at-Arms be directed to arrest and bring to the bar
of the House the members reported absent for
whom sufficient excuses have not been rendered.
Mr. STEWART, of Maryland. I move to
amend by confining the order to those who are in
the city.
Mr. BRANCH. Such an amendment is not
in order, unless they are excused from attend-
ance. We are bound to send for all alike.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The rule of the
House lays down the course of proceeding under
the call; and it requires all to be sent for,who are
not excused.
Mr. STEWART, of Maryland. I suppose the
passage of such an order would have the effect of
excusing them. If it is necessary, however, to
arrive at the result, I would move to reconsider
the vote by which these gentlemen were not ex-
cused.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The motion of
the gentleman from Ohio is a privileged motion,
and will take precedence of the one the gentleman
proposed to submit.
Mr. ELY. I desire to say to the House that
Mr. Vandever is stated to be sick, and in bed.
If it is in order, I would move that he be excused.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. It is in order, if
there be no objection.
There being no objection, Mr. Vandever was
accordingly excused.
Mr. SPINNER. I have been trying to get tho
floor to state that my colleague, Mr. Palmer,
has gone home on account of the serious indis-
position of his wife.
Mr. MILLSON sought the floor.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The motion of
the gentleman from Ohio is a privileged motion,
and is not debatable, and the Chair desires to put
it without further interruption.
Mr. MILLSON. It is to amend that motion
that I rise. I move to amend so as to provide
that the Scrgeant-at-Arms be directed to have the
absent members at the bar of the House at its
meeting to-morrow at eleven o'clock.
Mr. SHERMAN. The only difficulty in the
way of that course is, that an adjournment dis-
penses with all further proceedings under the
call.
Mr. MILLSON. I do not think that it does.
