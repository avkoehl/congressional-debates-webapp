The State Scouts at Glenville are penned up in the court-house defending themselves from twenty-five to fifty rebels. Send a force of not over one company to aid them at Glenville, or capture the rebels as they fall back from a force ordered from Weston.

WAR DEPARTMENT,

Washington City, March 11, 1865-1 p.m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

Special Orders, Numbers 48, in relation to trade permits, has just been received and is approved. But have you not limited it too much by the specification of "Treasury trade permits?" So as to meet the whole mischief should it not include all "trade permits," by whomsoever granted, so as to cover every species of trade license, including unauthorized licenses by military commanders as well as the Treasury permits, and also to prevent abuses under the President's permits? I am content, however, with the order in any form you choose.

E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.
