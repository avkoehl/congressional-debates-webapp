HEADQUARTERS SAINT LOUIS DISTRICT,April 29, 1865.

Lieutenant-Colonel MURPHY,

Washington, Mo.:

There is no foundation in truth for the rumor that Shelby is advancing on Richwoods or any other point in this State. The while thing is the fabrication of some poor deluded coward who, if he did not actually see three black crows, saw something as black as a crow, and that was his own shadow. Let the people be quiet.

H. HANNAHS,

Major, &amp;c.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF THE UPPER ARKANSAS,Fort Riley, Kans., April 29, 1865.

Major-General DODGE:

Arrived here yesterday. All quiet, except the Indians stole all of Colonel Leavenworth's mules; also some belonging to the stage company on Cow Creek and Little Arkansas. I have troops out after them. I have had to station one company at Cow Creek and one at Little Arkansas, on Santa Fe road. I shall go down to the southern part of my district to-morrow. Upon my return, if all is quiet, should like to visit Leavenworth City on important private business. Can I do so? Please answer by telegraph.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JAS. H. FORD,

Brevet Brigadier-General, Commanding District.
