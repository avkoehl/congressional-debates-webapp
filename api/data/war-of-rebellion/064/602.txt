quiet, but when they feed and harbor the men who turn away from their homes to rob and murder their neighbors, there will be trouble. The general is highly gratified that the committed are working so harmoniously and so well, and hopes for their ultimate success.

I have the honor to be, captain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. T. CLARKE,

First Lieutenant and Aide-de-Camp.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF NORTH MISSOURI,Saint Joseph, Mo., June 30, 1864.

JOHN H. HOLDSWORTH, Esq.,

Monroe County, Mo.:

DEAR SIR: The general commanding directs me to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 27th instant, and in reply to say that your suggestion relative to the placing of Captain Fowkes on duty will be acknowledged by the entry into service of Captain Fowkes with 100 men as soon as the necessary forms can be gone through with; say within three or four days. The general is fully aware of the extent of the danger that is threatening, and he will spare no effort that can result in crushing the designs of these rascals who make the guise of warfare a cloak for petty theft and robbery and murder of inoffensive men. The general desires me to express to you his kindest personal regards.

I have the honor to be, sir, very respectfully,

W. T. CLARKE,

First Lieutenant and Aide-de-Camp.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF NORTH MISSOURI,Saint Joseph, Mo., June 30, 1864.

Honorable A. G. BELLER,

Mayor of Weston, Mo.:

DEAR SIR: The general commanding directs me to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 28th instant, and to reply that in the Saint Louis Democrat of the 29th you will find General Rosecrans has issued a General Order, Numbers 107, which will for the present be the rule to be observed in every county in the State. The general desires me to assure you of his entire and perfect confidence in yourself, and to thank the Germans of Platte for their prompt response to his call upon the citizens to organize for their own defense. The general has not the power to compel the service as requested by you, and has not the troops regularly organized which he can furnish to defend Weston at the present time. The indication of trouble throughout the district are not as great as they have been, and the general hopes that the people in every section will learn to look upon bushwhackers as simply thieves and murderers, and treat them as such.

I have the honor to be, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. T. CLARKE,

First Lieutenant and Aide-de-Camp.
