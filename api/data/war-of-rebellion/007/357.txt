When we reached the entrenchments, Major Cosby gave me an order from General Buckner to march my regiment immediately back to the entrenchments we had left in the morning. At this moment we felt satisfied that the Wynn's Ferry road was clear and the way to Nashville open; that fortune had smiled upon us, and that we ought to prove to her were worthy of her favors. We marched rapidly back to our entrenchments and took position in them. In a few minutes the enemy appeared in large force in front of us and threatened to attack us, when night came on.

Early at night I received orders to have three days' cooked rations prepared, and, wing knapsacks packed, to be ready to march at 4 o'clock next morning. At the appointed hour we marched out for Dover, and before we reached Dover we were ordered to return to our entrenchments, and learned that capitulation for a surrender was going on.

It gives me pleasure to state that the officers and privates of the regiment, although jaded from labor and exposure, at all times exhibited great willingness to obey and anxiety to promptly execute all orders. In battle they behaved coolly and courageously, and not one of the regiment ever left the line or his post of duty. The morale of the regiment was not corrupted or destroyed, and even after it was known we were surrendered, we had not a single straggler from the regiment.

During the engagement on the 15th we lost in killed and had wounded in Company A, commanded by Captain Willis Worley, 1 killed and 3 wounded, whose names I cannot give, as I have no report from Company A. I hereto attach a list of the other companies of the regiment, giving the names, number engaged, and the killed, wounded, and missing.* At the earliest moment it can be obtained I will forward a list of Company A, to be made part of the exhibit hereto.

Our gallant Colonel Moore died from the wound he received. The regiment, as well as all who knew him, deeply mourn his death. The surgeon James F. Grant, Quartermaster John T. Shephard, Commissary E. Shields Wilson, Quartermaster-Sergt. James P. Campbell, were all at their post and did their fully duty. Captain John D. Clarke, a drill master, was on duty during the entire week, and in the engagement of the 15th. Captain D. C. Sims, a drill master, assigned to my regiment, was on duty a portion of the week, but not in the engagement of the 15, being reported sick.
