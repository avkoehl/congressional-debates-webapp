THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
February 27,
Mr. WARNER. What the gentleman from ij
South Carolina has stated is entirely true. I j.
could state other facts, if I deemed it necessary, u
to justify my conduct as a member of that com- j;
jnittee. I am willing that the record we have ,
made here should speak for me, so far as my ]
action is concerned. * I was as anxious to protect i
members of this House against improper immi-',!
tations as I was to inculpate when the evidence ,,
shows that they ought to be inculpated. I did ;
not go upon the committee to ficctwe anybody or ,j
to whiteivubh anybody. I desired to do my duty 'j
independently, and to know no man in the dis- ;;
charge of that duty. I had no personal enmity u
against any man, and tlio members implicated I !i
hardly knew. I had no acquaintance with them. !i
They never did me any harm, and wished me ,
none, so foras I know or believe. That they have ^
been implicated is not the fault of the committee; j
it is the result of their own conduct. If the evi- |
donee has placed them in an unenviable position
before the House and the countiy, it is the legit- j
imate fruit of the tree they planted. It has cer- |
tainly afforded me no pleasure, acting' as the in- I
stmment and under the order of the House, to ,
place any member 111 that attitude. Most gladly j
would I have avoided it, had it been consistent;
wifh my si use of duty to those who ordered the i
investigation, and to the country, but, m tiiojudg-- ,
meuf. of your committee, it was due to the charac-
ter of this body—it was due to our common con-
stituents, when the investigation was oideied, that !
it should be rnudu as thorough as timo and cir- •
omittances would permit, and with that viow wo
peii'oa mod thoiinpleaKantta&kassjgnod us without |
favor or affection towards anybody—not drsinn^ !
or intending to implicate any member unless the 1
evidence implicated In in; and if it did, to repoit
lum to ihe House, and recommended such actum |
?\r, in our judgment, wa.i necessary m regard to '
him, whoever he might be.
I can appieciate the frank end independent
disctiano' 01 nubhr doty, and ! ::uppoM- that the
intelligent nh'ioliet appreciate the
motives mid eondue; ef iJi. n' cdui'iiiUcc. I am ,
sure that if they could Iviv Ixeii there and wit-
nessed e\erythii!LC that v. as done, they would
have commended H. 00 far as the individuals ,
tire concerned, the action of this House is of ,
comparatively small moment. I myself do not
care a straw what disposition this blouse think ;
pioper to make of the matter, so far as the nidi- '
vidu.ils are concerned; but so far as (his question
ill volves c;reai public m f ei and so tar a a it in-
volves} ihe purity of legislation in tins Hail, end
so far as it regard; the making a propi r record
hero, I do consider if important; and no lecoul
shall be made of my sanctioning or sustaining
sueh conduct of any member of this House .is is
disclosed by*he testimony on your table. When
we pass from the sta;i,eoi'action—as we all must
soonpass—the lecord will remam there, and will
remain there as a precedent. If li-Teai'tei* the
people tdiould b( come mm e coinipt, and disposed
to coi nipt le^i-1 Uion at Us fountain head, and if
the h eord nlnmid show that the conduct of the
rnembeis implicated in this ease had received the
snneuon of the 1 inus", if wdl be pointed to r>;: n
precedent, jnvt as we [joint to precedents mode,
by men who have preceded us. Then fore, m a
public point of \u:\v, it. is important ami all-im-
portant. thtit we should meet this question prop-
erly, and check the evil at its fast exhibition, by
^tampm^ it wnh our unqualified disapprobation
und condemnation. li is mipoiiant ilial we
s-dioald i '.lidtmn and d-mounce the *.vij, and say
to tie1 v. .n id ! hat (his thing c,unnoc be tola utcd here.
j Jut 1' 1 li 1 ■> tliiieT can be passed ov-t by raising'
a quaml with the eommiUci . who have dis-
char^ul tin ir duty 111 reporting the facts—and
when. ( ver Was thoi" an accused that did not find
fault with his aeeu.M'i'sr— how will it be possible
over to pam. h corrupt .on r Ide&ire that the record
sha;l be piopeiiy made, and that the conduct dts-
olosjd by the 1. \ alence >hah n-ouve the disappro-
bation of House. The member, it is tiue,
robign ;d; *>nt ih;.t does not discharge the House
from porlor. I'nj itsduty,a>id expresjmg iu iuilg-
Jivuit Oil tin hois d? /eloped in regard 10 one of
its meidbcis. I aspectfully submft?to the House
that, in veferenc' especially to inciting parties to
brills love money or factory stoek, and in view
of the ih< t that the member himself charged that
there were twenty or thirty corrupt, damned
scoundrels hero, who would not vote for any law l
unless they were paid for it, this is a question of ;
privilege. If a member of Congress be not guilty ,
of corruption, it is a breach of privilege for an- |
other member to charge him with that crime; tor j
the charge has a tendency to prod uce violence and ]
disorder here, to distract his mind in the perform- j
ance of his duty. It is a breach of the privileges ;
of the House, and a gross slander, tor a member .
to make such a charge against his iellows. If :
i the charge were true, then it was his duty, as a
I correct and proper representative of the people,
to rise in his place and expose it. On that point :
I wish to see the vote of the House. I wish to
see whether a member can be denouncing mem-
bers of the House, soliciting men to bring money !
( here, and other valuable property, and represent- j
1 nig the necessity of using it to be, that there were j
twenty or thirty corrupt men in the House who
would notvoteforany measuie, granting land or
money, unless they were paid for it. That is ,
why I desire that these resolutions may be con- :
sidered at this time. 1 have said all that I desire 1
to say on this subject; and now ask that a vote j
may be taken on each resolution separately. j
Mr. BENNETT, of New York. I move that j
the whole subject be laid on the table. j
Mr. WALKER. On that 1 call for the yeas ■
and nays. ?
The yeas and nays were ordered. _ ^ :
The question was taken; and it was decided in
the negative—yeas 83, nays 108; a^ follows: j

So the House lcfused to lav the lesofutions on
the t.ibh"'.
l'< ndii'g the vote,
Mr. K\a\ts stated that he had paired off on this
cpu ;;tioo with Mr. Grosv.
Mr. SPl.XNER asked to be, and was, excused
from voting.
The question recurred on the first resolution,
i^s follows:
RwoL-eJ, That P . Maithson, a member of

Mr. ('LINGAIAN. I call for the yeas and
nuy^ coi agreeing 10 the resolution.
The veas pnd nays were ordered.
Mr. TODD. I ask the gentleman from Geor-
gia to modify the resolution so as to strike out
the words u a member," and to introduce the
words, " whilst a member."
The SPEAKER. It can only be done by unan-
. imous consent.
! Mr. A. K, MARSHALL. I ask that the rrs-
. olution be modified so as to make it read, "while
j he occu])ied a ^at in this House."
| The SPEAKE.R. ft is not competent for the
t gentleman to moddyit, unless by the unanimous
1 consent of the House.
I Mr. BENNETT, of New York. I object.
! Mr. WAXuBRlDGE, I rise to a question oft
order. The assertion contained in this resolu-
tion, that Mr. Matteson is a member of this
House, is not true in fact.
The SPEAKER. That is not a question of
order.
Mr. DUNN. I would inquire of the Chair
whether., alter voting 011 the first resolution, it
v/ill be in order to move to lay the second resolu-
tion on the table?
The SPEAKER. It will be in order.
?vlr. BENNETT, of New York. I rise to a
point of order. The niember having resigned,
this House has no jurisdiction to vote on any of
these resolutions.
The SPEAKER. It is not competent for the
Chair to rule the resolution out of order on the
ground stated; but it is a question for the House
to decide.
The question was taken; and it was decided in
the normative—yeas 145, nays 17; as follows:
