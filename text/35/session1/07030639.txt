If it
longs to the Committee on the Public Buildings
and" Grounds.
Mr. TAYLOR, of 3NTew York. I believe tlie
construction of the Capitol extensions is now in
charge of the War Department.
Mr CLINGMAN. I object to debate
give rise to debate, it will go over.
Mr. JONES, of Tennessee. The Co.nmittee
on the Public Buildings and Grounds have this
subject, as I understand, under consideration, and
are preparing: a report on the extension of the
grounds on different plans,covering different areas,
so that the House may bo able to select under
what plan and to what extent the grounds shail
be enlarged, and I think this subject should go to
them. It is a committee which is certainly or-
ganized to investigate and look into the condition
of the public buildings and grounds, and it is the
committee to which this subject, as it seems to
me, should properly be referred.
Mr. TAYLOR, of New York. I have no ob-
jection to that reference, except this: the chair-
man of that committee told me that I had better
not have the bill referred to that committee; that
he was opposed to the whole thing, and should
report againstit. I would like to have this bill
receive a fair consideration; and I want it referred
to a committee which will give itaf&irand proper
consideration. That is my only reason for pro-
posing that it shall be referred to the Committee
on Military Affairs.
Mr. MORGAN. If the Committee on the Pub-
lic Buildings and Grounds is not the proper com-
mittee to consider such a subject, we may as well
abolish the committee altogether.
Mr. TAYLOR, of New York. I will not ob-
ject to its being referred to that committee.
The bill was accordingly referred to the Com-
mittee on the Public Buddings and Grounds.
