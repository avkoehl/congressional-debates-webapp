Can you, consistently with present orders, go to Nashville? It is an absolute necessity, and, if necessary, I must get Department to modify orders to allow you to do so. Answer immediately.

KNOXVILLE, TENN., October 3, 1862.

Major General KIRBY SMITH:

I have just arrived here with 2,500 men, all that General Van Dorn would let me have. About 2,000 exchanged prisoners will arrive in a day or two.

I find here about 4,000 miscellaneous troops, under Brigadier-General Maxey. On hand here some 6,000 small-arms; have not had time to examine them. I will arm the exchanged prisoners, and take Maxey's command forward with the surplus arms as soon as possible, say two or three days, following as soon as possible with remainder of the force. The great difficulty is want of transportation, but we are making every effort to supply it. I will probably move via Cumberland Gap to London, thence through Richmond or Lancaster, as events may require. You shall hear from us before the command reaches London. General Bragg wrote me that the trains of Polk and Hardee would be here, but they have not arrived. Still, we will get through, and bring the surplus arms. I think the head of the column will reach London by the 17th of this month.

With great respect, your obedient servant,

JOHN C. BRECKINRIDGE,

Major-General.

KNOXVILLE, TENN,. October 6, 1862.

Major [GEORGE G.] GARNER:

Assistant Adjutant-General:

SIR: I arrived here a day or two ago with a little less than 2,500 men, including two batteries, being all that General Van Dorn would spare me. General Bragg's order of the 4th of September met me at Jackson,
