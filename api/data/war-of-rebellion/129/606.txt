Major C. BOYLE,

Chief Provost-Marshal, &amp;c., Gordonsville, Va.:

MAJOR: I inclose you herewith permit for Mr. Miller, the agent of Rappahannock County, for cottons for the people of that county furnished under the laws of Virginia. The Secretary of War will grant similar permits in all such cases, but requires the parties to obtain them. With all our care large quantities of cotton and tobacco are passed through the lines illegally.

I am glad to find you are rigidly enforcing the law and regulations.

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA, April 4, 1864.

Major C. BOYLE,
Provost-Marshal Army of Northern Virginia and Commandant Post, Gordonsville:

MAJOR: The general commanding directs me to call your attention to the inclosed general orders* and to explain to you that he desires the traffic referred to in it. To this end you will give general directions that any of the prohibited articles passing through your command en route or apparently so beyond our lines to any point be stopped and the fact reported to you. You will then see to the execution of the order without making its existence known generally. It is desirable that the enemy should not be informed that the Government authorizes such a trade, as it would no doubt prevent it. If the carriers appear only as persons engaged in private ventures, there will be less difficulty.

Yours, very respectfully,

CHARLES MARSHALL,

Aide-de-Camp.
