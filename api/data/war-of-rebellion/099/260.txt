Chief of Rail and River Transportation, Cincinnati, Ohio:

Cincinnati, January 24, 1865.

Colonel PARSONS:

DEAR SIR: The Central Ohio road is probably short of power. Had you not best telegraph to Lough, or quartermaster at Columbus, authority to take if necessary two engines of the Piqua railroad and two of the Cleveland, Columbus, and Cincinnati Railroad. Trains are going very slowly east for safety. We cleared out the yesterday's lot at 2 a. m. this morning. My impression is that we can take the troops to Columbus as fast as they can be taken away from there.

THOMAS LOUGH,

Superintendent, Columbus, Ohio:

Please advise me why it is trains are moving so slowly over the Central Ohio. Report from Wheeling shows the arrival of a much less number of troops than I had expected, and that the Baltimore and Ohio was waiting. Are you short of engines? If so, the quartermaster at Columbus will give you authority to make requisition or take possession of as many as are necessary. We send 4,000 more to-day, and the same to-morrow, making about 20,000 in all. Pray act promptly, and advise me fully. Cannot the Piqua furnish you engines if required?

Colonel and Chief of Rail and River Transportation.
