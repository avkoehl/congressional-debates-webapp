I do not consider a forge necessary now for Captain Carpenter, as he can use Captain Poague's. One is needed, however, by Captain Raine and one by Captain Cutshaw. I do not consider that Captain Caskie needs a forge, as he and Captain Cutshaw are attached to the same brigade. Captain Brockenbrough can work the three guns he asks for by turning in his howitzer, and I would be glad to see him get Napoleons. I do not request it, though, if you need them more elsewhere, especially if other batteries can furnish the teams. One of his guns, a 12-pounder Blakely, he reports disabled. The stock was broken in the battle of Sharpsburg, and it was sent to Winchester. If it can be repaired there, or the gun put on another carriage, I would be glad to get it back, and then, by giving Captain B[rockenbrough] two Napoleons and allowing him to turn in his howitzer, he would have a capital battery of four guns, two of them rifled. This is one of our best companies.

Captain Cutshaw has two 12-pounder howitzers, while his caissons are those of 6-pounder guns, and need alteration.

As to the reserve needed by this army corps, I would wish to consult General Jackson before reporting specifically, and as he is now at General Lee's headquarters and may be engaged there some time, I must beg your indulgence for a short time before reporting, which I will do so soon as I see him.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. CRUTCHFIELD,

Colonel and Chief of Artillery, Valley District.

Brigadier General WILLIAM N. PENDLETON,

Commanding Artillery.
