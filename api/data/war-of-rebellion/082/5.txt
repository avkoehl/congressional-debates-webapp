the Fifth and Ninth Corps has been ordered to ascertain the practicability of making an immediate attack, and for selecting the most suitable point in the event of regular approaches being decided upon.

CITY POINT, July 5, 1864

Major-General MEADE:

My engineer officers make the same report of the lack of practicability of assault anywhere along our present front that you do. At present we are doing very well. All the roads are cut and the enemy are living now on half rations. This I presume is certain as well as the further fact that discontent is beginning to prevail. I believe the enemy are preparing to make an effort to establish themselves on the north bank of the river below, with a view of blockading, or it may be only a force going to the north side of James River to cover foraging parties whilst they collect and get out all they can between the James and Chickahominy. It may be necessary to march Wright over there to prevent this, but I will do so until more is known about what the enemy are doing. The best we can do now is to strengthen our present line on Burnside's and Warren's front and advance by gradual approaches as you propose. As soon as the cavalry, is in working order we will make another raid, supporting the cavalry as far as the Weldon road with infantry. The troops in North Carolina started out to cut the Weldon road, but as near as I can learn turned back on the report that the enemy were re-enforcing.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

GENERAL: The following information obtained from two deserters who came in this morning, is sent to your for what it is worth. They stated it to be currently reported at Richmond and in Petersburg that Early, in command of two divisions of Ewell's corps, with Breckinridge's command and other forces, was making an invasion of Maryland, with a view of capturing Washington, supposed to be defenseless. It was understood Early would reach Winchester by the 3rd instant.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

Richmond papers of the 4th instant state:

It was believed to be satisfactorily ascertained that Warren's army corps had been thrown across to the north bank of the James River near Deep Bottom. The Yankees have removed the obstructions recently sunk by them in Trent's Reach.

The above may account for the sending troops from Petersburg toward Richmond. I will send the paper to-morrow.
