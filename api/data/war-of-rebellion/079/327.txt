HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,Ship's Gap, October 17, 1864.

Brigadier-General ELLIOTT,

Chief of Cavalry, &amp;c.:

GENERAL: General Sherman directs me to have your order General Garrard leave his wagons to join the train of the army of the Cumberland, and with his command to at once move down the Oostenaula from the east of Snake Creek Gap to about the Armuchee and turn toward Dirt Town, making a bold reconnaissance toward Summerville. Report to him, via the back track and Villanow, any movement of the enemy, and its direction and import, as far as possible. Also to strike the enemy, if possible, in flank.

I am, general, yours, &c.,

L. M. DAYTON,

Aide-de-Camp.

P. S. - Please send Captain Jacob's map to General Sheman.

L. M. D.

CAMP ON LA FAYETTE ROAD, October 17, 1864.

Captain DAYTON, Aide-de-Camp:

CAPTAIN: General Garrard reports 4. 30 p. m. 16th, two miles from Resaca, road "full of wagons. " Has sent regiment to mounth of gap (Snake Creek) to guard road from Lay's Ferry to Dalton. Says he will move early this morning and do best he can for "safety of the immense trains which follow our armies; " that "where there is only once road" he thinks "they extend over ten miles. " Reports nearly all the trains of two corps and cattle to move out of Resaca. Nothing from Watkins. Had he not better guard railroad from Oostenaula to Etowah (Cartersville)? Kilpatrick guarding road from Chattahoochee to Allatoona. If Croxton's brigade, of McCook's DIVISION, joins us, it would give McC[ook] a very respectable DIVISION of cavalry, i. e., Croxton's, Lamson's, and Watkins' brigades, the latter too small, however. I will be up after breakfast.

Respectfully, &c.,

W. L. ELLIOTT,

Brigadier-General, &c.
HDQRS, THIRD BRIGADE, FIRST CAVALRY DIVISION,DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,

La Fayette, Ga., October 17, 1864 - 8. 30 a. m.

General SHERMAN:

GENERAL: The near of Cheatham's corps left here at 6 o'clock this morning, moving in the direction of Summerville. A Union lady that I can depend upon says that they are going into Middle Tennessee by the way of Blue Mountain. A wagon train left here yesterday for Summerville, numbering 700 wagons. General Hood stopped eight miles from here Saturday night on the Summerville road, and had not left at 11 a. m. yesterday. Doctor Gordon says that Hood's whole army is on this side of Taylor's Ridge. The road to Chattanooga is clear of rebels. I will follow on until I come up with them.

Respectfully,

LOUIS D. WATKINS,

Colonel, Commanding Brigade.
