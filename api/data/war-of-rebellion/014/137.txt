General McCLELLAN:

The enemy is reported to be in strong force in front of me. I am going to engage him unless I get other orders.

I would suggest that the forces at Lee's Mill and on our right be ordered to advance to add support.

WM. F. SMITH,

Brigadier-General.

MAY 4, 1862.

General WILLIAM F. SMITH:

How far in front of you and about how strong is the enemy? Do not engage him until ordered by me, as I am making other arrangements to cut him off.

Major-General, Commanding.

MAY 4, 1862.

Com. SMITH, Commanding Fleet:

I learn that a large part of the rebel force marched to Bigler's Mill, on the York River, last night, to take sail from there to West Point. It is of the first important to my operations that some of your gunboats hurry up to West Point to destroy the transportation and report to me the state of affairs.

Franklin's division will be ready to go up under convoy of the other gunboats as soon as I can hear from the river.

GEO. B. McCLELLAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
