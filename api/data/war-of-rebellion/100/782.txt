batteries now here of their caissons, I can, I think, make up a train of reserve caissons, twenty in number, six mules to the caisson. I cannot speak positively until Johnston's battalion arrives and its wants are known. The mules are in very fair order. To furnish drivers, one of the smaller companies will have to be broken up. Shall this be done? This section of country is pretty well eaten out, and forage and grain are had with great difficulty, and only from a long distance. A change of location is desirable. Please forward to me the instructions of the general on the points above as early as possible, and oblige,

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JAS. CONNER,

Brigadier-General, Provisional Army, C. S.
