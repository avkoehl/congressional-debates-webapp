The enemy opened briskly with their mortars at dark, wounding 3 men (see list*), 1 severely, 2 very slight.

Teh engineer here has 100 men working to-night, and more will be given if asked for. Lieutenant Moses is mounting the Dahlgren gun at Gregg, and Stiles has 50 soldiers in addition to 100 negroes. I keep the lines manned during the night notwithstanding the shelling. Colonel Harris called this evening and took a memorandum of my wants. Under his recommendation, I will move up the remaining field piece from Cumming's Point to-morrow.

Captain Johnson, Palmetto Battalion Light Artillery, reports his company worn down by continuous service at Shell Point and Morris Island. Please send a strong and efficient company to relieve him. Two monitors (hulls pained red) lay off this battery to-day, about 1,500 yards off, watching our movements.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

LAWRENCE M. KEITT,

Colonel, Commanding.

Captain W. F. NANCE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
