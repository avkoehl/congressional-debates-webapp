Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND, August 21, 1864.

Major-General SHERMAN:

Did you receive Colonel Klein's report* forwarded this morning? He broke the road near Fayette and destroyed a train of cars with locomotive, but being attacked by cavalry, supported by infantry, and cut off, as he says, from Kilpatrick, returned to Sandtown with but very little loss. If he broke the road between Atlanta and Kilpatrick, and then succeeded in effecting his escape, there can be but little doubt of Kilpatrick's success, if he worked away from Atlanta, as there is but little probability of his meeting concentrating all cavalry coming to the front at Dalton have been given.

GEO. H. THOMAS,Major-General.
