The railroad bridge across the Cumberland River is obstructed by reason of repairs. I have an order from Brigadier-General Granger to put the bridge up immediately. Lieutenant Irvin will now return the barge he took. Can you not get an order from General Rosecrans for another barge, as the river is now too low to get the one from Carthage? There are barges now in port which could be used. I have the pontoon wagons ready. Lieutenant Webb sent saddle by express.
