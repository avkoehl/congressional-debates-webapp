HEADQUARTERS SECOND DIVISION, SECOND CORPS,April 29, 1863-2 p. m.

GENERAL: In front of Falmouth the only enemy to be seen is what appears to be parts of two small regiments, probably not over 300 or 400 men, in the intrenchments some distance back from the bank of the river. There are a few lounger on the other bank; no fishing, and the pickets are walking equipped and with their muskets. I have just received the inclosed; not of much importance, but I send it. The telegraph station here is broken up.

Respectfully,

JOHN GIBBON,

Brigadier-General, Commanding Division.
