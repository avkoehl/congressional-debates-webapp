long to your immediate command, viz, the District of Kentucky. Clear out the guerrillas, root, and branch, and banish the vagabonds that, under the pretense of being Confederates, commit murder and highway robbery, and don't bother too much with the fellows who make money, as they are not a dangerous set. Their self- interest an fear of danger will keep them quiet enough.
