CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
"'•IV-ti* ' M^~
It will be seen, by referring to the report of the
Commissioner of Indian Affairs, that the most san-
guine expectations of the friends and promoters, of
this system have been realized The Choctaws,
Cherokees, and other tubes, that first emigiated be-
,yond the Missisippt, have) for the most part, aban-
doned the hnnkr state, and become cultivators of
the soil. The improvement in their condition has
been japid, and it is believed that they ai enow-
fitted to enjoy the advantages of a simple form of
•government, which has been submitted to them and
reeeivad their sanction, and I cannot too stiongly
urge this subject upon the attention of Congress
Stipulations have been made with all the Indian
tribes to remove tl em beyond the Mississippi, ex-
cept -with the band of the Wyandotts, the Six Na-
tions in New York, the Menornonees, Mandans
and Stockbriilgcs m Wisconsin, and Miamies m
Indiana. With all but the Menomonees, it is ex-
pected that arrangements for their emigration will
be completed the ptesent year The resisianea
which has been opposed to their removal by some
of the tribes, even after treaties had been mide
with them to that efiect, has arisen from various
causes, operating differently cm each of them In
most instances they have been instigated to resist-
ance by peisons 10 «horn the trad? with them and
the acquisition oí then annuities were important,
and in «orne by the pus > tal influence of interested
Chiefs These obstie U s must be overcome, foi the
Government can not relinquish the execution nl tins
policy without sauificing important mteiests, and
abandoning the tubes i emaimng east of the Missis-
sippi to certain distinction

Zm    By the report of ihe Secretary of the Navy, here-
«m mt^ oo^wunteated, it appears that unremitted ex-
^erttons have best made at the different navy yards
to carry into eftect all authorized measures for the
extension and employment of our naval force The
launching and preparation of the ship of the line
Pennsylvania, and the complete repairs of the
ships of the line Ohio, Delaware, and Columbus,
may be noticed, as forming a respectable add tion
to this important arm of our national defence Our
commerce and navigation have received increased
aid and protection during the present year Our
squadions in the Pacific and on the Biafilian sta-
tion have been much increased, and that in the
Meditenancin, although small, i  odeemte to the
present wants of our commeicc m that sei Addi-
tions have been made to our squadron on the West
India station, where the large force undtr Com-
modore Dallas has been most actively and effi-
ciently employed m protecting our commerce, in
preventing the impoitation of sKves, and in co-
operating with officers of the Army in carrying on
the war m Florida
The satisfactory condition of our naval force
abroad leaves at our disposal the means of conve-
niently providing for a home squadron, for the pro-
tection of commerce upon our extensive coast
The amount of appropriations required for s'ich a
squadion will be found in ihe general estimates for
the naval service for th° ven 1818
Tlu naval odicers engaged upon our const sur-
vey have rendered important ceiviceto our naviga-
tion The discovery ol a new channel m o the
hatbor of New "ioik, tluough whuh oui Higcst
ships may pass without dangei, must nfKrl impor-
tant commercial advantages to that harboi, and
add gieatly to its value as a nival statu n The
atuiidtt siuvey of George -. shoals oil 'he coa i ol
Massachusetts, lately completed, will tender com-
paratively  afe a navigation hitherto considered
dangerous

For many interesting details I ref*r von to the
i po t of the Postmaster General, with the aceom-
p iv mg paper Your particular afention is in-
vited to the necessity of providing a more sale and
convenient building for the accommodation ofthat
Department
I lay before Congress copies of reports submit-
ted m pursuance of a call made by me upon the
heads of Departments, for such suggestions as
their experience might enable them to make as to
what further legislative provisions ma, be advan-
tageously adopted to secure the faithlul applica-
tion of public moneys, to the objects for which
they are appropriated, to prevent their misappli-
cation or embezzlement by those entrusted with the
expenditure of them, and generally to increase the
security of the Government against losses in their
disbursement It is needless to dilate on the im-
portance of piovidmg such new safeguards as are
within the power of legislation to promote these
ends, and I have little to add to the lecommenda-
tions submitted in the accompanying papers.
By law, the teims of service of our most im-
portant collecting and disbursing officers in the
civil departments are limited to four years, and
when reappointed, their bonds are required to be
renewed
The safely of the public is much increased by
this feature of the law, and there can be no doubt
that its application to all officers entrusted with the
collection or disbursement ol the public money,
whatever may be the tenure of their offices, would
be equally beneficial I therefore recommend, m
addition to such of the suggestions piesented bj 'he
heads of Departments, as jou may tnmle usefu', a
general ptovision, that <i'l ofTLtrs of ihe \rmy or
Navy, or m the Civil Depaitment, entrusted with
the re eipt or paymert of public money, and w hose
term ol service is either unlimited or for a longer
time th-m tour ye ir , be íequired to give bonds,
with good and sufficient sureties, at tue expiration
ofeveiy such period
A change in toe period of tcrir mating th" fiscal
year, from the first of October to the first of Apul,
has been frequently recommended, and appears to
be desirable
The distress.ng casualties ía steumboa s, which
h ive so frequently happened dutmg Ins year, seem
to evince the necessity of attempting to prevent
them, by means.of seyrrie piowsions connected
with their custom house papers This subject was
submitted to the attention of Congress by the Se-
eietary of the Treasury m his last annual rep¡rt,
and will be aga.n at the present session, with ad-
ditional details It will doubtU ss receive that eatly
and careful consideration which its pressing im-
portance appears to lcquire
Your attention has heietofore been frequently
palled to the affairs ol the District of Columbia,
and I should not again ask it, did not then entire
dependence ou Congress ¿no them a constant
claim upon its notice Sepaiated by the Consi
tutu n from the rest of the Um in, luiuLd m ex-
tent, and aided by no Legislatuie ol its own, it
would seem t > be a spot where a w s> aid u u'orm

ad >pied This Di tnct,however, uit >r unate'y, has
been left to linger b*hin 1 ihe rest of the Union ,
us codes,civilandciimnnl are not only very defec-
tive, but full of obsolete or inconvenient p ovisior ,
being formed of pottions of two Suies, discrepan
cues m the laws prevail in different paits of t e tei-
ntory, small as it i<; and al hough it was «-elected
as the seat ol the General Gov einmart, the ntc oi
lis public edifices, the depo uoi} ot i aie mes
and the residence of o'ticets entrusted witn 1 i0e
amounts of public property, and the m m_,ement
ol public busiues*, yet it ha ¡ever bcai sji j^cl el
