BALDWIN, March 3, 1864. (Received 9.40, 4th.)

All quiet here at present; enemy has retreated to Jacksonville under cover of his gun-boats, where he is fortifying. His force is estimated at 12,000. He is reported receiving re-enforcement form New Berne, N. C. Our and enemy's pickets are now 7 miles from Jacksonville. Our main body, about 7,000 strong, is in rear of McGirt's Creek side, 6 miles back. The victory at Ocean Pond was complete, but pursuit, especially by cavalry, was unsatisfactory.*

MARCH 4, 1864.

Your estimate of enemy's force is considered excessive. No re-enforcement can reach him from New Berne without the evacuation of that place. He should be expelled from Florida by prompt and decided measures.

CAMP MILTON, NEAR McGIRT'S CREEK, FLA., March 7, 1864.

All quiet here at present. General Gillmore is reported having left Jacksonville for Hilton Head on learning my arrival here, probably to make a demonstration against Charleston or Savannah. I have telegraphed Generals Jordan and Mercer to be prepared accordingly. Enemy's wounded taken at Ocean Pond represent twenty-eight regiments and battalions.

CHARLESTON, April 2, 1864-12 m.
