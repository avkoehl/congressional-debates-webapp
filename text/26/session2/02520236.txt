CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
doty to those from whom he holds, his appointment,
nor any confidence in advance from the people,
but that asked for by Mr Jefferson, "to give firm-
ness and effect to the legal administration of their
affairs "
I deem the present occasion sufficiently im-
portant and solemn to justify me in expressing to
my fellow-citizens a profound reverence for the
Christian religion, and a thorough conviction that
sound morals, religious liberty, and-a just sense of
religious responsibility, are essentially connected
with all true and lasting happmes , and to that
good Being who has blessed us by the gifts of
civil and religious freedom, who watched over and
prospered the labors of our fathers, and has hith-
erto presented to us institutions for exceeding in
excellence those of any other people, let us unite
in fervently commending every interest of our be-
loved country in all future time
The oath of office was then administered to the
President or the United States by Chief Jus-
tice Taney, and the Piesident concluded his inau-
gural address as follows
FelloiP-citizens Being fully invested with that high
office to which the partiality of my countrymen has
called me, I now take an affectionate leave of you
You will bear with you to your homes the remem-
brance of the pledge 1 have this day given to dis-
charge all the h gh duties of my exalted station,
according to the best of my ability, and I shall
enter upon their performance with enure confi-
dence in the support of a just generous people.
On the conclusion of ihe address, ihe members
of the Senate, preceded by the Vice President, Se-
cretary, and Sergeant at-arms, relamed to the Se-
nate chamber.
Mr. BAYARD submitted the following resolu
tío .
fiesolved, That the thanlrs of the Senate be pre-
sented to the Hon. William R King, for the abi-
lity and impartiality with which he has discharged

The resolution was considered and agreed to,
unanimously
Mr. MANGUM submitted the following resolu-
tion for the consideration of the Senate, which l<iys
over one day.
Resolved, That Blair and Rives be dismissud as
Printers of the Senate for the 27th Congress.
The Senate then adjourned until to-morrow at
12 o'clock.
IN SENATE,
Fi-irjAY, March 5, 1841
Mr. MANGUM moved that the following reso-
lution, which he offered yesierday, be now taken
up
Resolved, That Blair and Rives be dismiss d as
Printers of the Senate for the 27di Congress
Mr ALLEN said, betore that motion was put,
it appeared to him there was a preliminary ques-
tion, on which it became the duty of the Senate to
pass, that is, whether it was in order to entertain
that resolution at this time, the Seriate being m its
Executive and not m its legislative capacity here
That resolution had for its object the undoing of
that which the Senate did in its legislative charac-
ter, and he therefore desired that the preliminary
question should be first settled, whether it was com-
petent for the Senate, in its character of an Exe-
cutive Council to the President, (for that was then
its character, and that alone,) to undo an act which
it did in its legis ative ehaiacter, as part of the law-
making power He desired to take thcpleasure < f
the Senate on ihe question, whether it is m order
now to enteilam the mouon to call this resolution
«¡p.
The PRESIDENT said the point of order was
involved in the motion to take up, and would be de-
cided by the Sena e in the vote on that question
Mr ALLEN then called for the a>es and noes
on the motion to take up the resolution
Mr CLAY of Kentucky     Agreed
The ayes and noes were men ordered
Mr. CLAY of Kentucky wished to c¿y a single
word on this question of order The Senate was
there organized with its President at ns head, and
it might, therefore, do any thirg which a Sena'e
can do. The resolution proposed to be rescinded
related to an officer elected by the Senate, and it
could no mere be asserted that he was elected m
their legislative than in their Executive capacity.
He was elected as was their Dooi keeper, or their
Sergeant-at-Arm«, or any body else The Senate
was there, agreeably to the Constitution of the
country, and it might do any thing which it was
competent for a Senate to do, and it might appoint
those officers whose agency was necessary to the
discharge of the duties of the Senate
Mr ALLEN said, it was difficult to say whether
the election of an officer w as Executive or legisla-
tive in its character properly «peaking, it was
neither But here was an act done by the Senate
whilst acting in its character of a brarch of the le-
gislative body The proof of that fact was, that
this body was required, when sitting on Executive
business, to sit with closed doors, and the election
of this Printer took place with open doors. Tiie
election of this officer took place under circum-
stances, and under a joint rule of the two Houses
of Congress, which made it the duty of the Senate
of the United States to communicate the fact to
the House of Representative1:, then in session,
that it had elected A B, or C D, to be the Pub-
lic Punter for the body, and now when this body,
as a branch of the National Legislature, acting
under a joint rule of the two branches of the Go-
vernment, has elect'da public officer, whose du-
ties are connected with both Houses of Congress—
when they had don that with open doors, not in their
Executive but in thpir legislative character—and, fur-
thermore, when they had informed the House ol Re-
presentatives of th s, could they now, when the
House was disbanded, annul ihisact, and bring the
Hou«e here next year, totally ignorant «f ihe fact
who is the Printer to the Senate' If it were an
Executive election, why was it not done with closed
doors, when the rule, under wh ch this body acts,
requires that all Executive business shall be trans-
acted with closed doors,? He repeated* that, in it-
self, the act was neither Executive nor legislative,
and it deived its character of an Executive or le-
gislative act, from the position the Senate assumed
at the time the act was done, and that was either
as to the publicity or secrecy with which the Senate
sat This was d&ne as a legislative act, and, as
such, they informed the other branch of Congress
of the fact They had so acted, and it seemed to
him they might, with equal propriety, rescind
every íesoluiion which they had passed in their
character of a legislative body Andas to the as-
sertion that this was a new Senate, he denied
the fact The argument co much relied on in this
discussion, and on which so much logic and rea-
soning had been nasted in opposition to the elec-
tion of ihese Printers, was uniruc There was no
such thing as a new Senate known to the Consti-
tution of this Republic They might as well
speak of a new Supreme Court a  of a new Se-
nate There was a new House of Representatives,
because the entire House expired at the expiration
of the second year, anl because the 4th of March
terminated the life of that body But not to the
Senate The Constitution replenishes that body
every tw o years, by the election of a class of Sena-
tor, and "hereby gives eternity to the duration of
the body There was no new, nor was there any
old, Senate Th  same Senate, therefore, which
elected Blair and Rives, now, without charge or
allegation, propose  to rescind the ae, but he
would not go into that He again said the action
of the Senate, on this election, was not with closed
doors, their rules requnej. all Executive action
should be had with closed doors This was not so
had, and the circumstances of the act, which in
itself was nei her necessarily Executive nor legisla-
tive, compelled them to look to the character ihey
assumed at the time tr-ey did the act, in order to de-
cide en the character of the act ttsslf. He had now
done with this for the piessn*
Mr WRIGHT, befi re the que'tion was taken,
wished to know whether he had correctly under-
stood the Senator from Kentuck) to say that the
Senate, with i>  President at its head, was compe-
tent to do any act which a Senate of the United
Sta'es can do?
Mr. CL'AY.   Separate from the House.
Mr WRIGHT, That was a very important qua-
lification, and it remained then for the Senate to in-
quire whether the Senate legislatively can do any act
when there is no House of Representativ -s organized
and sitting, and when there is none in existence. It
seemed to him, then, they must come to the con-
clusion that the,r powers there, whatever they
might be, weie those which pertain to the Execu-
tive action of the Senate as a council of the Presi-
dent in matters of appointment Though he had
not had time to examine this question, he asked
Senatois on all sides what had been the uniform
practice of the Senate on questions of this sort, for
every fout years since the commencement of the
Government there had been a special session like
the present Had the Senate ever, at any session
of that character, a tempted to appoint even its
Sergeant-at-arms or its Doorkeeper? Since he had
been a member of the body he did not believe they
ever had, ard, wi'hin his experience,he knew that,
althi ugh the new Senate, if gentlemen were pleased
to call it so, bad had these special sessions, there
never had been a question that those offices were
vacant, and to be filled at the commencement of
a legislative session What were properly their
powers, acting as an Executive council, under the
Const tution' Could they originate any thing?
Could they do any thing but to advise and consent,
or dissent, on subjects laid before them by the Presi-
dent of the United States—to wit, nominations or
treaties' And had tneSenate ever attempted to do any
thmg else, whether with open or with closed doors?
for that, he apprehended, was a mere matter of rule
of the Senate Well, what were their rules, then?
He had never heard it pretended that the rules of
tneSenate are not peipetual from Congress to Con-
gress, unless. ih y were changed by the body. The
rules were not now changed, and what then were
they doing? Why, they were debating this matter
in violation of their rules, and by their action were
assuming to exercise legislative powers He had
expected, from the necessity of the case, that the
very first motion this morning, after the Senate
was constitutionally organized, would be to com-
municate to the President that a quorum was pre-
sent, and that they were ready to receive any com-
munication from him that he might have to make,
that they would then assume their Executive
form, and, if their doors were thrown open, that it
would be by order of the Senate, without assuming
any other than an Executive form. These were
the honest impressions of his mind,
Mr CLAYTON admitted, with the Senator from
New York, [Mr Weight ] that the S nale then as-
sembled there could do no legislative act, ihey were
not 'Ming as tre Congress of the United States, but
on ihe summons of the President of the United
States, but, having come there, they could perform
any act which was necessary to organize that body
—they could do any act which a Senate can do,
which did not require the action of the other House.
For instance, if then President should be taken ill,
nobody doubted that they could elect a President
pío ten , and if their Secretary should be sick, was
there, any doubt that they had the power to appoint
another Secretary at their pleasure' Tries* offices,
beyond all question, were held at the pleasure of
the Stnate, and the officers might beremovsd at the
pleasure of the Senate It did net require the
concurrence of the other House It was an act
s mply of the Senate for its organization Now
they found it necessary to go into the election of a
Printer, but they were told the office was filled
With that he did not agree He believed the act
performed was a nudit), and not consistent wnh
die powers given ihem bv the Constitution to ap-
point their own officer , and therefore they could
remo\e these Printers, and go into the election of
othei Printers.
He confessed, however, he did not like
the form in which jt was presented, and
he 'hould have liked it better, if it had
come in anoth-r shape, but he would not now
discuss that Theie they were, organized under
the summons of the President of the United States.
1 his was not a legislative act which required the
concurrence of the House of Representatives; it
was a mere act of this body, and to deny that they
