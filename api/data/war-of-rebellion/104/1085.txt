KNOXVILLE, July 19, 1865.

Brigadier General WILLIAM D. WHIPPLE,

Chief of Staff:

Do your telegraphic instructions of yesterday contemplate the muster out of the colored mounted regiments? I think two regiments in East, two in Middle, and one in West Tennessee, of mounted troops will be sufficient. Does this meet the wishes of the commanding general?

GEORGE STONEMAN,

Major-General.

AUGUSTA, July 19, 1865.

Your order directing the muster out of cavalry is received, and will be carried out at once. I go to Macon to-morrow to meet an engagement with Governor Johnson.

Brigadier General WILLIAM D. WHIPPLE,

Chief of Staff:

Under authority from General Stoneman, I have organized troops in Middle Tennessee into four brigades of infantry and one of cavalry. The commander of Fourth Brigade also commands Nashville. This brigade includes troops at Nashville and those in the old Fourth and Fifth Sub-District.

R. W. JOHNSON,

Brevet Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE TENNESSEE,Nashville, July 20, 1865.

His Excellency PRESIDENT JOHNSON,

Washington, D. C.:

Will your authorize the publication of your telegram of the 16th instant to Governor Brownlow, advising him to adopt strenuous measures to have the laws passed by the last Legislature enforced? Its publication will do much good in satisfying many obtuse minds in this State that Governor Brownlow's policy is approved by you. The rebel element in some portions of this State is very restive under the present state of affairs.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General, U. S. Army, Commanding.
