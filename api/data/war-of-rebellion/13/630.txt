My thanks are due to all of my staff for faithful and efficient service. Major Ratchford, adjutant-general, and Lieutenant Reid, aide-de-camp, were much exposed and were ever prompt and active; Major Pierson, chief of artillery, was always on horseback by the side of the battery engaged; Captain Tayloe, inspector-general,, rendered valuable and important service. The ordnance officers, Captain West and Lieutenant T. J. Moore, attended faithfully to their duties. Lieutenant Sydnor, of the Hanover Light Dragoons, volunteer aide, at Cold Harbor was conspicuous for his zeal and gallantry. Sergeant Harmeling, commanding the couriers, and Private Lewis Jones, courier, merit particular mention for the zealous and intelligent performance of duty.
