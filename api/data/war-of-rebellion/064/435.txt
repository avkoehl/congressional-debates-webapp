Colonel JOHN F. WILLIAMS,Commanding at Macon City, Mo.:

COLONEL: The general directs me to acknowledge the receipt of your favor of June 14, and to say in reply that the suggestions contained in it are for the most part approved. The troops of the Enrolled Missouri Militia will be ordered on duty as fast as required by you, and you only to designate the companies which you considered best, to have them ordered into duty. It is not considered best by the authorities at Saint Louis to order General Douglass and staff on duty at present. If it should be deemed advisable you will be informed. In the meanwhile choose only the best officers to place on duty. Choose men to command who have influence and position to back them, and place with them and place with them men of the most reliable character. As soon as you call in and consolidate the detachments of the Ninth, stationed at remote points.

I have the honor to be, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. T. CLARKE,

First Lieutenant and Aide-de-Camp.
