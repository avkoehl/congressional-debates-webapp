HEADQUARTERS EXPEDITION,North Bank River, June 21, 1864-8 a. m.

(Received 9.10 a. m.)

Colonel J. W. SHAFFER,

Chief of Staff:

COLONEL: I have to report that the working party of 1,800 men has not arrived. i would like to have the chief engineer or his assistant at this place to decide upon the propriety of fortifying a position about half a mile in advance of this. This place seems too near the river. What appears to be the working party is just coming in sight.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. S. FOSTER,

Brigadier-General.

Colonel J. W. SHAFFER,

Chief of Staff:

Since General Weitzel left my cavalry has driven in the enemy's cavalry pickets toward New Market and back toward the Kingsland road, developing a force of infantry, the strength of which I have not yet ascertained and who seem to be advancing in line of skirmishers on my front. Reports from Mrs. Grover, Kingsland road (a New Jersey woman), state that Wright's division 7,000 strong, was on our front yesterday near her house. She also reports strong works about two miles out toward Chaffin's Bluff. She says a General Lee commanded the force about Chaffin's Bluff. Major Robins' cavalry is on our front. I have no means of knowing whether this is correct or not, except that it coincides with the story of a negro who was taken aboard the gun-boat Hunchback, who states a large force is near Aiken's. At the request of Admiral Lee I have opened my pontoon bridge to allow a boat to pass through for ammunition. Shall I continue to open my bridge at the request of the navy?

R. S. FOSTER,

Brigadier-General.

Colonel J. W. SHAFFER,

Chief of Staff:

COLONEL: Captain Freeborn, of the First New York Mounted Rifles, is covering the Kingsland road from a point at or near Four Mile Creek to a point on Three-Mile Creek. Three-Mile Creek after it leaves Sharp's ceases to be anything but a rivulet. Captain Freeborn has been through to Aiken's with the cavalry, communicating with the gun-boast, and reports all clear through that route. The enemy are on the opposite side of the Kingsland road. Has Aiken a protection?

R. S. FOSTER,

Brigadier-General.
