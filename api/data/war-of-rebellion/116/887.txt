CHAPEL HILL, N. C., May 30, 1862.

General HUGER.

SIR: Some time since I reported myself in Norfolk to your son, Captain Huger, as ready to return to Fort Warren. My thirty days had expired. I left bound to comply with the terms of my parole. I was told by Captain Huger that none of us were to go back; that General Wool did not require it. I asked for a certificate of the fact and was told that it was not necessary. I now find myself in very embrassing circumstances, for the enemy are arresting all of the paroled prisoners that they can lay hands on and are even trying some of them for their lives. Major H. A. Gilliam has been arrested and carried North and I have been driven for safety from home. My escape from them so exasperaed them that they have offered a reward of $2,000 in gold. Please get the certificate for me from your son, for the Yankees have threatened to hand me. It is evident the Government does not intend to exchange me, and I am tired of running from a danger that I have had no hand in bringing about. It is due to me that I should either be exchanged or secured in some way from a danger that threatens me through the act of the Government.

I am, sir, very respectfully,

S. L. JOHNSTON.
