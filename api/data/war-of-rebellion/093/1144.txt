They have also gotten possession of the Peytonsville and Bethesda road, which makes it impossible for them to cross Harpeth Harther up than Henderson's Ford. Some of the officers of the command think that Forrest has divided his forces, sending some up on the Davis Ford road, but in the opinion of the general there is no doubt he has gone to Nashville with his whole force. The general will endeavor to cover Franklin as much as possible until you get there.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOHN N. ANDREWS,

Captain and Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.

Please let him know what time General Schofield will get through with the infantry.
