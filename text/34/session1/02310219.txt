APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

34th Cono....1st Sess.
Marine Hospitals—-Reform—Mr. Campbell, of Ohio.
Ho. of Reps.
turn the whole system, devised, through a long
succession of years by the wisdom of Congress,
to insure the bestowal of proper care and attention
on the sick and disabled seamen and watermen
upon our rivers, and substitute, in place of it, the
mere arbitrary discretion of the Secretary of the
Treasury. Ia there any reason for making such
a change with the haste, and under the pressure
to which we. are subjected by the advocates of the
provisoes? They say there is; and that it unfur-
nished by the fact that a few hundreds or a few
thousands of dollars may be saved by it, by putting
up the privilege of taking care of those sick ana
suffering men at auction.
I do not know what is the actual condition of
the hospital service at this time. There may be
abuses in it. There may be changes to be made
in it which would promote its efficiency and
diminish its expense. This I will not pretend to
deny, for I know nothing on the subject. But
this I will say: if changes are to be made, let
them be made deliberately, cautiously, and with a
full knowledge of what we do. I must confess that,
for one, I am not disposed to substitute the will,
or the discretion, if you please, of a Secretary of
the Treasury in place of the deliberative and well-
considered action of Congress on this subject,
-without more investigation. The cry of " econ-
omy," with reference to taking care of so deserv-
ing, and, at the same time, so exposed and im-
provident a class of men as those for whom the
hospitals already in existence were provided, and
those now ordered to be established are to be
built, has no weight with me, when raised in
support of a scheme to have them taken care of
by contracts entered into with those who make
the lowest bids. I prefer that speculations—if
they are to be made at all—should be made upon
the expenditures of the Government, rather than
upon the comforts and care to which these men
are entitled from the country, which is benefited
by their labor, and in the promotion of whose
great interests they seldom meet with even mod-
erate rewards, and often, often indeed, encounter
sufferings, sickness, and death.
Mr. CAMPBELL. It was not the purpose of
the committee to strike at any particular point,
certainly not at New Orleans, where there doubt-
less is necessity for extensive facilities of some
sort to provide for sick seamen, nor to propose
a reform which was to be local in its character.
Their object was, as the language of the bill ex-
presses, to give the Secretary a discretionary
power to change the system at such points only as
the public interestmay require, having in view, first,
the proper provision for seamen, out of whose
pockets a part of this fund is drawn; and, sec-
ondly, economy in the expenditure.
The gentleman from Illinois has made his tables,
and produced certain results on which he relies,
by taking out here and there particular hospitals,
and basing his calculations upon them. In order
to test the propriety of the proposed reform, the
true way is to place in one class the organized hos-
pitals built by Government, and ascertain what
has been the current cost to the seamen and to
the Government per week, or per day. Then
take the other points where provisions are made
without the construction of buildings, and ascer-
tain what is the result in respect to the comfort
of disabled seamen and the economy of the sys-
tem. It is in that way I propose to test the prop-
osition of the Committee of Ways and Means.
Unless I can show from the facts and figures, to
the satisfaction of the minds of all here, that the
system of making arrangements with the muni-
cipal authorities, or with private associations of
medical gentlemen, is far the most economical
and the best for the seamen, then I will be willing
that this proviso shall go by the board.
Mr. KENNETT. I should like to know what
sort of arrangement the Secretary of the Treasury
could make at Napoleon for the sick. It fre-
quently happens that a vessel leaving New Or-
leans with passengers and crew all well, may reach
Napoleon with all the passengers and a greater
part of the crew diseased. In that case it would
be utterly impossible to find accommodations for
them by any association of individuals. There
is no private hospital there.
Mr. CAMPBELL. I will again explain to the
gentleman. This provision is cot positive in its
character. It simpljr vests in the Secretary of
the Treasury a discretion, that he may make these
proposed arrangements at such points as he may
think best for the public interest, and the good of
the seamen. That is all. It may be that, upon
inquiry, he will not find it advisable to change the
system at every point. It merely vests him with
discretionary power to do so—nothing more.
Again: The gentleman says that no private
hospital at Napoleon could provide at all times
forthe necessities of sick seamen. ThereisaGov-
ernment hospital there which, cost $60,000, and
why cannot the Secretary of the Treasury, under
this bill, make an arrangement with an association
of medical gentlemen, or the city or State author-
ities, to take the building, allowing a compensa-
tion for the relief of sick and disabled seamen ?
There are built by Government sixteen marine
hospitals; some of them have cost $185,000 each.
There are in progress of construction thirteen,
and gentlemen will be demanding more. With a
view to inform the public, if not the House, I
have here a table carefully prepared from the
official documents which shows up the whole
matter:

Average cost per patient for 1854, $9 45 per day; with
interest on building added, $3 49.
Average cost per patient for 1855, #2 45 per day ; with
interest on building added, $3 36.
Counting the interest upon the cost of construc-
tion at each point, we find that in those organized
hospitals the expense is three dollars ana forty-
nine cents a day; or, in other words about twenty-
four dollars a week for each disabled seaman ! A
sum amply sufficient to keep a sailor at the most
magnificent hotel In the United States.
Mr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois. I would ask
the gentleman from Ohio, how much, upon the
same system of reckoning, it would cost to collect
the revenues of the Government; and how much,
by that kind of reckoning, it would cost to collect
the revenues by the job)
Mr. CAMPBELL. Allow me to say to the
gentleman that it is an exhibiton of weakness in
a legislator to attempt to palliate or justify one
wrong by pointing to another. If there is any-
thing wrong in your system of custom-houses,
and the collection of the revenues, I hope the
Committee on Commerce will ferret it out; and I
will stand by you in reforming that wrong, rather
than throw obstacles in your way. The gentle-
man cannot satisfy me that it is proper to build
a marine hospital at Galena which will cost
#50,000of the people's money, or at other points,
by telling that there is extravagance and necessity
for reform in some other, or in all other, branches
of the public service. I do not doubt but that the
custom-house business may be looked into. I point
him to this fact, that, after you have drawn this
$150,000 a year from the pockets of the seamen,
and expended millions in the construction of your
marine hospitals, you incur the expense of twenty-
four dollars a week for the support of each sick
and disabled seaman ! Yes, sir, that is the result
of these figures carefully prepared. And yet gen-
tleman want to continue that system; and, without
examination, charge the Committee of Ways and
Means with usurping power because they do not
unconditionally open the vaults of the Treasury
to a system thus proven to be a most flagrant
outrage upon the rights of the people, and upon
the weather-beaten sailors who are compelled to
contribute to it from their earnings.
The average cost of supporting a sick and dis-
abled seaman at forty-three of our ports, where
relief is furnished them by making arrangements
with hospitals of cities or other benevolent insti-
tutions, is $4 37 a week. This includes the ports
of New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Cincin-
nati, and the other great commercial points of the
country. The cost is twenty-four dollars a week
where you hate built hospitals, and only four dollars
and thirty-seven cents where you have not expended
the money for buildings ! Will any gentleman
undertake to assert on this floor that the sailor is
not as well provided for at either one of these
points as he is at the city of Natchez, where the
expense, including interest, is one hundred and
fifty dollars per week for each patient ?
Now, Mr. Chairman, let us look for one mo-
ment at the condition of things upon our western
waters. I refer first to Pittsburg, where you have
constructed a marine hospital, at the confluence
of the Alleghany and Monongahela rivers, at a
cost to the Government of £70,000. Whatis the
cost there, counting the interest upon the money
at six per cent., ana the current expenditure from
our appropriations ■and the seamen's food, of
keeping a sick and disabled seamen one day?
Three dollars and five cents a day, or twenty-one
dollars and thirty-Jive cents a week ! Pass down
the Ohio river to Cincinnati. There you have no
Government building. An arrangement is made
through the Treasury Department with Dr. Ba-
ker—a physician who keeps a hospital there—
for the care of the sick and disabled seaman.
The expense under that arrangement is only Jive
dollars a week. At Pittsburg the cost, with the
cost of j|70,000 for a building, is four times as
great as at Cincinnati, where you have not built.
Mr. KENNETT. Will the gentleman give
the cost exclusive of the interest upon the invest-
ment ?
Mr. CAMPBELL. The tables will show that.
I will give it in reply to my friend from Missouri
now, without the interest. At Pittsburg, the
cost, not including the interest upon the expend-
iture, is $1 53 per day; while at Cincinnati, where
we have no marine hospital, the cost is only
seventy-two cents a day. These are two cities
upon the same river; and at one of them, where
the Government has made no expenditure, our
