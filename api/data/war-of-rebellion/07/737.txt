and continue in efficient operation (these works being the only ones that can now supply the requisite material for the manufacture of small-arms and other munitions of war), it is absolutely indispensable that all the operatives (and wood-choppers), white and black, whose names will be furnished you by the proprietors, should be exempt from all military of militia duty. You will therefore issue such orders as will give effect to this requisite exemption.

As it is desirable that as large a force may be collected as is necessary for the rapid completion of the works now in progress and projected, it is suggested that you extend the limits of the district from which the laborers are be obtained, in order that the demand may not operate too severely upon the smaller number that will otherwise be required to furnish this working force.

I am, very respectfully,

L. POLK,

Major-General, Commanding.
