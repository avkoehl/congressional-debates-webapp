TWENTY-FOURTH ARMY CORPS,

March 31, 1865.

General WEITZEL:

Nothing. I do not expect them in till late at night. After reaching the Charles City road, where the enemy's vedettes are, they propose to pass on foot inside the vedette line. A lieutenant and six men make the party.

CHAS. DEVENS,

Brigadier-General.

March 31, 1865.

Major-General WEITZEL:

The scouting party under Lieutenant Robb, Twentieth New York Cavalry, has returned. He crossed to the Charles City road, striking it at White's Tavern. He found it was impossible to go through White Oak Swamp, as had been his intention, on account of the height of the water. He therefore proceeded up the road, and found the rebel picket about a mile above White's. Observed the camp, which was apparently as large as it had ever been, and saw soldiers moving about among the tents. Lieutenant Robb was about a mile from the camp, which was behind the enemy's breast-work, and, apparently, infantry. The picket was mounted and about half a mile in front of the breast-work. The picket has usually been found at White's Tavern. Mrs. White says it has been drawn in within the last ten days. There were no tracks on the Charles City road since the rain of this morning above White's. On Wednesday a scouting party of the enemy came down near our picket at Fussell's Mill, as reported to Lieutenant Robb.

CHAS. DEVENS,

Brigadier-General.

All quiet along the cavalry picket to-day. Heard a few shots fired at the colored troops when first posted.
