Morgan has certainly crossed the river with about 3,000 men and five or six pieces of artillery. He was in camp last night 4 miles from Corydon.

J. T. BOYLE,

Brigadier-General.

CINCINNATI, July 9, 1863.

General BOYLE, Louisville, Ky.:

Dispatch received. I have been trying to get a dispatch to you all the morning. You are, of course, authorized to move any troops you like, and to take arms by force if you need them. There is no danger of Louisville, so that you can move the troops to New Albany. I thought nearly 1,000 men were sent from Indianapolis. More can be ordered from Lebanon. Where are Hobson and Judah? Answer in cipher.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.

LOUISVILLE, July 9, 1863.

General BURNSIDE:

Judah is at Litchfield, on the left and south of where he ought to be. He refused to obey my orders because they did not come from General Hartsuff. I will send you the dispatches to and from him. Have ordered Manson, with three regiments, to report here at once; I can return him on short notice. Hobson is at Brandenburg, waiting for transportation to cross the river, which has been sent.

J. T. BOYLE,

Brigadier-General.

CINCINNATI, July 9, 1863.

General BOYLE, Louisville, Ky.:

You are authorized to move troops as you please. Our scouts are just in to Somerset from below Monticello. No rebels there. Tell Hobson he must catch Morgan. Have you armed the citizens of Louisville and New Albany? Don't hesitate to take the arms from the ordnance department.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.

LOUISVILLE, July 9, 1863.

General BURNSIDE:

The enemy are reported to have taken Corydon; killed 2 citizens. They are moving toward New Albany.
