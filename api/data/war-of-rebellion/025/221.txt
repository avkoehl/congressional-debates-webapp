General GRANT:

Do I understand you that I am to go up by rail to support Mower, or that you send up 1,400 men for that purpose? I will consult Du Bois about that move to-night. Hamilton's position is a good support to anything of that sort.

ROSECRANS', September 16, 1862.

General GRANT:

The orders are all out. Colonel Mizner will direct one regiment of cavalry to move this afternoon from Rienzi. Do you not think it would be best to leave one battalion of cavalry to cover that front and conceal movement? I will direct the infantry to begin to move this p. m.

ROSECRANS', September 16, 1862.

General GRANT:

You have the telegram from Du Bois. I have directed Colonel Gilbert to move up the Thirty-ninth Ohio from Johnson's, 4 miles north of Jacinto, to Harvey's Mill, about 2 miles south of Burnsville, where there send forward three companies to reconnoiter and cut off the cavalry that burned the train, and send up a company to Burnsville. Prime is to notify General Ross and Colonel Mower of what is coming. I think things will work out. I now find our stores were wagoner down toward Bay Springs; our cavalry heard the train moving down and saw those who had seen the packages with our marks on them. Only one regiment of infantry and one of cavalry has one from Du Bois. Shall more be moved to-night, or await further instructions?

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Brigadier-General.
