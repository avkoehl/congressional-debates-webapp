THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

cer. He is appointed by the President, and con-
firmed by the Senate, but he is an officer of the
United States, and do not we direct him? Here
is a subordinate officer, and the Senator says we
cannot direct him to report to us. This question,
as to the proper form of a resolution calling upon
any Department for information, has been dis-
cussed two or throe times since I have been in the
Senate, and the Senate has uniformly decided,
and decided upon the yeas and nays, that in com-
municating with the coordinate branches of the
Government, with the Executive, we should re-
quest information ; but when we communicate with
the subordinate officers, we direct them to make
a report, and I think, here in the District of Co-
lumbia, we have a right to direct a report from an
officer in this District. Here we have exclusive
control; there are no constitutional difficulties.
We have complete control, in every respect, over
the District of Columbia, to legislate font in every
form which a State Legislature could adopt withm
its own jurisdiction; and surely, if we can direct
anybody, we can direct the officers here in the
District of Columbia to make reports to the Sen-
ate. I hope that we shall adhere to the phrase-
ology of the resolution as first introduced by the
Senator from New Hampshire.
Mr. CLARK. I suggested the alteration merely
to satisfy my friend from Vermont; but I find 1
satisfy nobody, and, if the Senate will allow me,
as there has been no motion to amend, I will ad-
here to my own original impressions, and use the
word " directed.'*
The VICE PRESIDENT. Then the question
is on agreeing to the resolution.
The resolution was adopted.

THANKS TO CAPTAIN WILKES.
The joint resolution from the House of Repre-
sentatives (H. R. No. 10) tendering the thanks
of Congress to Captain Wilkes, of the United
States Navy, was read twice by its title.
Mr. SUMNER. I move its reference to the
Committee on Foreign Relations.
Mr. HALE. I object to that reference, and I
desire to state my reason. It is a resolution
touching a matter in relation to the naval affairs
of the country entirely, and appropriately belongs
to the Committee on Naval Affairs, and the at-
tempt now to take it out of its ordinary course
and refer it to the Committee on Foreign Relations
will be taken as an intimation that there is some
doubt in some minds as to the propriety of the
course that Captain Wilkes took. 1 do notwish
at the outset to put ourselves in that position.
My own opinion is that it should go in the reg-
ular channel.
Mr. SUMNER. I desire to have no question
with regard to the direction of thai resolution be-
tween myself and my friend from New Hamp-
shire, and I cheerfully consent that it shall go
according to his motion. I had thought that,
upon the whole, the more appropriate committee
for it was the Committee on Foreign Relations,
but if the Senator from New Hampshire thinks
differently, I most cheerfully yield.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator from
Massachusetts withdraws his motion, and the
joint resolution will be referred to the Committee
on Naval Affairs.

notice, asked and obtained leave to introduce a

the Militia.

their gallantry at Pensacola; which was read twice

pont, and the officers, seamen, and marinesunder
his command, for the victory at Port Royal, in-
troduced yesterday, be taken from the table, and
