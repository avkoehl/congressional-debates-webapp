SAINT LOUIS, MO., August 4, 1862.

Brigadier-General TOTTEN, Jefferson City, Mo.:

I do not expect you to send more men from Jefferson City, but you have several regiments in your division. My question had a much broader and more important meaning than you gave it.

Brigadier-General TOTTEN, Jefferson City:

Concentrate your forces at important points and in bodies sufficient to secure them against defeat and in condition to act wherever they may be required. I believe Porter and Poindexter will cross the river if they get a chance.

There is no danger from the southwest.

Brigadier-General.

QUINCY, ILL., August 4, 1862.

Mr. PRESIDENT: Northern Missouri is again in revolt. The condition of affairs there is quite as bad as at any former time. For some
