Cross-Lanes. Our pickets on the Fayette road were fired into by a party of mounted men early this morning; 1 killed, 2 wounded. No further news up New River. A party has gone in advance to see what can be learned. They generally keep their infantry out of reach, attacking out outposts and scouting parties with the cavalry. An order from Washington sends Captain Cotter's artillerymen back to Ohio to be organized for the three-years' service. This leaves my guns in the hands of such men as I can select from the infantry ranks, and puts that arm in bad condition to move, though they can do pretty well for defensive purposes.

GAULEY BRIDGE, August 28, 1861-9 p. m.

General W. S. ROSECRANS,

Clarksburg, Va.:

Major Casement has carried over 400 of the Seventh into Charleston handsomely. He went by Big Sandy and down Elk. There are so many practicable routes for cavalry and infantry without trains that his presence in Charleston may prove very fortunate. The enemy continues in principal force near Cross-Lanes. A scout informs me to-night that they had put two pieces of artillery on the mountain near Peters Creek, so as to command the road from here where it passes a gap. I do not feell quite sure of this. Their means of getting back across Gauley are at present small and insufficient. I hear nothing more of the force up New River to-day.
