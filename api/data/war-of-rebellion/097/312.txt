HEADQUARTERS SIXTH ARMY CORPS,March 30, 1865-7.45 p. m.

Major-General WEBB:

Can you send me instructions before 10 p. m. for to-morrow? I shall need all the time between that and daylight for getting into position, as part of the troops have quite a distance to march. The orders will be issued at that hour, if I do not hear from you before. Reports up to dark represent no change in my front.

H. G. WRIGHT,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,March 30, 1865-8.15 p. m.

Major-General WRIGHT,

Commanding Sixth Corps:

Every effort will be made to send you your orders as soon as practicable. It is now hoped that they will be out before 12 o'clock.

ALEX. S. WEBB,

Brevet Major-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,March 30, 1865-8.40 p. m.

Major-General PARKE:

The order to attack to-morrow is suspended. Keep a vigilant watch on the enemy and take advantage of any opportunity presenting itself. Be prepared also for orders to assume a threatening attitude, and also to attack; for this purpose have your reserves so massed and situated as to assist in either the defensive or offensive. Acknowledge receipt.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.

(Same to General Wright.)
HEADQUARTERS SIXTH ARMY CORPS,March 30, 1865-9.45 p. m.

General MEADE:

Your dispatch of 8.40 this p. m. and that of General Webb of 8.15 are received, and orders have been issued in accordance with the former. As I have a long line to hold it should be borne in mind that considerable time is necessary for assembling the troops, and I would therefore ask that as long notice as practicable of any intended movement be given me. I would also state that there is only one position on my long line where an attack can be made with a reasonable chance of success, and must have sufficient time to assemble my troops at that point before attacking. At that point I believe we can go through the enemy's line.

H. G. WRIGHT,

Major-General.
