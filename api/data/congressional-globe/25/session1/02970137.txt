Oct. 1837.____________APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE._________________137
35th Cong.....1st Sfss.________                  Making public officers depositories—Mr. Hunter.                                               H. of Reps,
more real -suffering than all the complicated horrois
of the war of the Revolution Did time permit,
I might well pause, for the purpose of tracing to
the inevitable tendencies of our banking as-
tern, the wide spread derangement of our cut-
rency and credit, from the suspension of spe-
cie payments during the war, until 1819,
when the bank of the United Slates itself
was perhaps only saved from a like catas-
trophe by the suspension of a Treasury draft Yes,
■sir, and for confirmation almost as strong as pioot
of holy writ itself, I might tarn 1 rom that pent, d
to this. In a Lme of prolound peace, when the
mighty energies oí the American people were task-
ing themselves to their utmost upon the finest
theatre for exertion which any people ever en-
joyed, we have seen their career suddenly stayed,
ana the arm of enterprise ikelf folded m the mourn-
ful contemplation of the íuins of the prostrate
system of ciedit, a fabric which fell, sn, as I bcfoie
observed, because it was founded, not on the sdid
rock of leponsibihty, but upon the fleeting sands of
amere conmteoce—a false confidence—engendeied,
sir, by those very institutions which were relied
upon as the pdlars of ihe edifice.
And here, Mr Chairm-n, let mc not be misun-
stood I do not v ar upon existing institutions,
but with the policy which gave them birth I would
be the last man m this community to encourage
a violation of these vested ngh s Neither do I
blame individuals, sir, ^ r entering into employ-
ments to which the policy of their State Govern-
ment invited them I hav e no desire either to re-
turn suddenly from one measure ot value to
another, so as to disturb the relations between debtoi
and creditor. I go for reiorm, sn, nor for revolu-
tion 1 wish to see a change of policy, it is fue,
I eiie not how gradual it be, so the prospecto!
reform be ceitam As one o[ the means of eff cl-
ing thisgradual reform, I propose a divorce between
this Government and all banks. E propose it, sir,
as a measure required by public interest, and ulti-
mately beneficial to the banks themselves. The
deposites of public money, upon which these insti-
tutions trade, and the credit given to their papei
by means of its receipt m public dues, only serves
to stimulate an action already false in its nature,
and tends but to hasten the round of expansion and
contraction which they are ever performing. In
that point of view the connection is injurious
alike to the Government, ihe people, and ihe
banks. Upon every occasion in win h thii con-
nection has existed with the State banks, we
have seen it result in a general explosion of
the «edit system. I believe no one doubts but
that this connection hastened the late catastro-
phe, which furnished the occasion for the late call
of Congress The receipt of bank paper in pay-
ment oí public dues increases its credit, and extends
its circulation The amount of paper currencv
necessary for making all the payments required in
collecting and disbursing the public revenue, is
ae ded to the natural circulation of the banks, and
has no other basis than the confidence that it will
be receiued m payment of Government dues As
this revenue expands and contracts, so this portion
of the currency increases ordiminisb.es Whilst the
surplus revenue was collecting, this circulation
mcieased upon that credit it incieased, too, from
the use of the deposites upon which they trade I,
and when the surplus and annual revenues of the
Governmentwere being distributed, and diminished,
a poition of this currency was drawn from the field
of cuculation, and being no longer useful, Us con-
version was sought m specie Here isjhe unhappy
and fruitful cause of fluctuation m credit and cur-
rency, which must always exist undei a connection
between Government and ba«k There were doubt-
less other causes growing out of that connection,
which tended to hasten the suspension of specie
payments. I throw them out ot consideration,
however, because they do not enter into the
general question, and take only those con-
sequences which necessarily flow from a con-
nection between bank and Government undei
any circumstances, and having shown the
injury which they work to the bank. I turn to
their opeiation upon the fiscal concerns of the
Government, when this violent rupture of the ties
which bind them togethei takes place, the Govern-
ment is fo*ced either to tale depreciated paper,
or to demand specie If they take the hrst alter-
native, they give a bounty to each State to depre-
ciate its piper, to lower' it' taxes, and dut'es be-
come no longei uniform If they choose the latter
alternative, they find that its operation is to raise
the taxes upon the people precisely at the t'me
when they are least able to encounter an in-
crease of expenditure. If, on the other hand, this
connection had never  e\isted, the banks would
have been better able to meet then engagements,
because their circulation would ha/e been m ire
limited and more justly proportioned to the wants
of trade The operation, too, would have kept
enough of specie m circulation to have met the de-
mands of Government, and to have afforded a
i allying poult to the banks when anv sudden
emeigency created an unexpected demand for
specie If I have shown, Mr Chairman, that this
connection injures both bank and State.# I need
not state the obvious consequence, that whatevei
injures either the banks or the Government, injures
the people a'so But my colleague seems to sup-
pose that this Government can find the means of
regulat na the operations of these banks, and of
producing, through them, a sounder ciurenoy His
projpf supposes a system of rewards and punish-
ments, through the fiscal action of this Govern-
ment, which is so to control the banks as to effect
this salutary end I will not revert to those views
which I have just given, to show that this expei ta-
tion is false in theory, nor will I pause, to cite to
him the opinion of Secretary Dallas, who, altet a
lon^ experience, in 1816, pronounced this hope to
be impracticable, much less would I cite to him as
authontv my own opinion upon this subject I
Will take his po ition as Hue, for argument'-, sake,
at d then I wru'd ask r>y horo'abk" colleagi e how
it is that, thinking with me that this Government
can not charter an institution for the purpose of con-
trolling currency, still he will maintain its right to
buy up the corporations of the States, and regulate
their chartered functions, so as to control the cur-
rency and the exchanges of this country1
But, Mr Chairman, mQch as I object to the
connect.on betvv een this Government and the banks,
on account of the disturbing causes which I ihink
it mtioduces into the action of the currency and
credit systems of the country, I have another ob-
jection till more povvefu1 I never wish to sec the
banks co.ner ed into political engines again Of
all the enormous additions which have been made
to Executive patronage, in late years, I regarded
its connection with the State banks as the most
fearful The army of office-holders, though you
should count them as 100,000 strong, would confer
not half the pow er upon the Executive which the
possess on of the State banks would give to him.
Convert them into political engine  to be woiked
by his hands give iim the control over the ex-
changes and cuirency of the countrv, give him the
dispensaHon of bank favors, and if he weie disposed
to use them for personal advancement, he would
scoin your title of king, f' d your gewgaw
of a crown, as if the offer intimated a doubt
of his absolute authontv without them It the
choice of means were given to a wise king, vvhe
wished to maintain his power, he would not choose
a nobility, said to be the natural suppoit of the
crown, but he would ask for some hundreds of cor-
porations, wielding the money power of the whole
country. He would psk for those whose delibeia-
tions might be secret, whose agents might be invisi-
ble, and whose maicn ujion thtir purpose could
only be diverted by that impulse of interest which
he alone could regulate. Give him these, sir, and
he would despise your standing armies and youi
orders of nobility as cumbrous devices, unwoithy
of the refinement of the spirit of modero despotism
Mr Chairman, I have always regarded the connec-
tion between bank and state in this country as a
conjuncture most ominous to our liberties Use
the public monev to buy up the State hanks foi
the use of this Government or of its Executive
branch, and you at once convert them into poln cal
engines, you deprive the States of the control of
their own institutions, and you place the people
under the dominion of a league of corpoiate influ-
ences Endow a moneyed corporation with the
functions of Government, and you behold at one 
thp most ruthle-s of all despotisms, and the history
of human suffering and of East Indian oppression
is not silent upon this subject. You may place
the worst of men in authority, and he will have
some touch of human feeling Not so with a mo-
neyed corporation it deliberates in secret, it moves
by the pow er of a majority, with no sense of per-
sonal and mdivid íal íesponsibihty at the bar of
public opinion and it is governed by the single im-
pulse of interest You can not move it to pity for
the present, or to remorse for the past, fonts action
is mechanical, and not under the influence of -eel-
mg or of soul I protest then, sir, agamst any at-
tempt to bind the moneyed colorations to one
government, and by one common political purpose
I have given my reasons for objecting to any con-
nection between Bank and Stat , and perhaps it
may be reasonably required of me to suggest some
belter plan for the cus'ody of the public treasure.
If the selection were left to nv, sir, I should adopt
the plan of special deposites. The General Govern-
ment should be independent of the banks as to the
medium m which its revenues aie collected, and
banks would be independent of the Government
when they weie no longer exposed to the power of
its rewards through the privilege of trading upon the
public deposites If such an arrangement could
be effected by giving the banks a fair compensation
for keeping the public money, at the same time
that they were effectually restrained from using it,
I should much prefer it to the scheme proposed by
the Committee of Ways and Means The pecu-
nnry responsibility would be greater than that of
individual collectois, and its custody of the public
levcmi" vvoul 1, peihaps, be safer But the chief
recommendation would be m ihe irems which this
plan vv o il' iffo d t h n pi^sentatives of ti c people
to aiceitain the state of the public money, if at any
time there was cause to suspect either the ability or
the honesty of the Secretary of the Treasury. Ishall
not fatigue the Committee, however, with the details-
of a scheme which I shall not propose by way of
amendment, as there would be no reasonable pros-
pect of Us adoption at present I should greatly
prefer a bill carefully named upon this basis to the
one now before us , bat I give to that the decided
preference over the ot'ier alternatives, of a United
States Rank, or the connection between the Govern-
ment and tec State banks Doubtless, theie will
be d'íhculüc1- attendant upon any scheme foi ícgu-
latmg the custody of the public revenue The
money power m all its combinations, presents the
most difficult problem to be solved m the science
of Goveinment But we must choose the best plan
within om reach, it is idle to expect peifectton in a
sv stem of finance I go, sir, for the great principle
of divoice, without committingmvself to the speci-
fic details of this bill further than by the expression
ot a preference for them ovei the connection be-
tween Bank ard State In that comparison, I have
satisfied my elf that it does not increase Executive
patronage, as its opponents naintain, nor do I be-
1 eve that its tendency w ill be to rttud the resump-
tion of specie pa) eent« It, in fact diminishes the
Exi cutive patrol age bv a laiger an ount than any
oll.ei íeform ever proposed under thisGo\eminent.
It subtiac s the entire amount of batik pationage
from the E iccutive, and in comparison with this,
the few additional oftceis to be created are as
nothing How is tms bi'i, sn, to retard the re-
sumotion of specie pay menu by the banks' They
will be afraid, it is said, of runs upon them for spe-
cie to Le paid for jrabhc dues This objection, sir,
is moie specious ihan v?hd The quarterly re-
ceipts of this Governmi nt will lange ftom six to
eight m llions The greatest possible amount
ot tne additun to be made to the legal cur-
rency, und r this bill, would be six or eight
mill ons, and m point of fact I am informe 1 that a
frr less sum wuuid suffice, as the public money is
p?id out neatly as fast as it comes m Is it to be
supposed, sir, that the eight hundred banks of this
countiy could not m et sucha requisition, if they
were ready m othei lespects 'or the resumption of
specie payments1 But, sir, m pent of fact, the
requisition for specie upon the banks, or upon the
country, under tms bill, can not amount to a dollar
