HEADQUARTERS FOURTH ARMY CORPS, Lick Creek, East Tenn., April 3, 1865.

Major General G. H. THOMAS,Nashville, Tenn.:

Dispatch from General Tillson says he will reach his destination in the mountain passes to day. Has information that Early commands instead of Echols. Early and Vaughn were at Bristol eight days ago. A part of Early's force has come down the road from Lynchburg. The rebels report a heavy force, but this is not believed. The rebels have left about 400 active cavalry in East Tennessee, with orders to interrupt the railroad as often and badly as they can. Could a few of the cavalry at Knoxville be mounted, they would be very useful to me. I leave no bridge without guard.

I started an expedition to-day for Asheville, N. C. The railroad will be pushed faster this week, as we have more force.

Major-General.
