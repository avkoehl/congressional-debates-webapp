I cannot close without expressing my obligations to the members of my staff-Captain H. J. Cheney, assistant adjutant-general; Captain Gid. H. Lowe, acting assistant inspector-general, and Lieutenant James T. Brown, aide-de-camp-for the services rendered by them during the entire engagement. More gallant men could not be found. They discharged their several duties with a degree of fidelity and intrepidity which mere language cannot reward.

Major B. P. Roy, assistant quartermaster-general; Major B. F. Carter, acting commissary of subsistence; Dr. James F. Grant, brigade surgeon, and Lieutenant Mark S. Cockrill, ordnance officer, performed their several duties with an efficiency and zeal deserving the highest praise.

I am also indebted to George B. McCallum and M. A. Carter, acting staff officers, for valuable and efficient assistance on the field throughout the battle.

I have the honor to be, major, most respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. C. BROWN,

Brigadier-General.

Major R. A. HATCHER,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Stewart's Division.
