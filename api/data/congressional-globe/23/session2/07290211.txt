DRAPTSMA\ OP THE   HOUSE
Mr SCHLEY, by consent, submitted the fol-
low ing lesolution
liesohed, Tl at the Committee on the Post Office
end Pt st Roads be instructed 'o inquire into the
expediency of abolishing the ofHi-eof diaftsman to
the House of Repiesentatives, ind discommon g
the annual expenditure of fifteen hundred dollars
now paid *o fhat officer
Mi McKEXNAN1 said he would like to know
the reasons which hid induced the gentleman
from Georgia to oñer this reso'ution Several
>eaia ago the offce of draftsman had been, a*ter
much discussion, abolished It had subsequen'ly,
however, b en *bund necessary to restore the
former older of thing's and to reinstate this officer
of the House
Mi SCULLY said it was true that this office,
uponconsideiation bad heretofore leen abolished,
and subsequen ly let tabhshed for what reason,
he knew not The individual who occupied this
offke was daily enga0ed 111 reporting the pioceed
mgs of this House for a morning paper of this city,
while a gentleman by the name of Burr was em-
p 05 ed -n preparing those maps for the Committee
on the Pjgt Office and Post Roads, which it was
the peculiar duty of the draftsman of the House to
perform What would be the extra expense thus
incurred, ¡1  knew not, but presumed it would
exceed fifteen hundred dollars He saw no ne-
cessity for continuing this office if it was neces-
sary to employ another individual to perform its
duties while the incumbent was emploved as a
reporter for a newspaper His attenuon had
been drawn to the subject by the fact that Mi
Burr had been employed to execute the necessary
maps required by the Committee on the Post Ot-
f ce and Post Roads He could not remain silent,
and see such a wasteful and prodigal expendi-
ture of the public money, without interposing
an objection Pie was aware of the facility with
which the hangers on of this House manage to
put their hands nto the public Treasury He
considered himself, and -every member of this
House n the capacity of a guardian of the public
treasure, and he felt the same obligation to take
care of it, that he womd to take care of the estate
of m nors for whom he had been legally ap
pointed the guardian The maps requned by the
committees of the House, he was satisfied, could
be procured at ¡ess expense than the sum now
paid In conclusion, he could see no good reason
why another pe-son should be employed to do
this work wh Ie the regular offi er of the House,
instead of at ending to his uuties, was engaged as
a íeporter of its proceedings
Mr McKENlNAV admired the spirit of econ-
omy which seemed to actuate the ge iilenan from
Georgia, [Mr Schley ] He was bound to sup
pose tnat the resolution was solely diciited by
con iderations of economy It was nrobable,
however, that the object was to procure these
mp,is to be made by some other person, that it
was intended ti make room for some favorite
Ble had understood that greater faculties had been
afforded at the Post Office Depaitment to another
individua' tnan weie extended to the draftsman of
this House The duties of this officer were not
confined to the Post Office Depart-nent He was
also assiduous!/ engaged in the performance of
duties required by the Committee on Roads arW
Canals, and other committees He was unwilling
that this office should be abolished, merely for
the purpose of transferring its duties to some
favorite
Mr PEARCE said, if the officer of the House
did not execute the dunes required of him, it
might be a proper subject of inquiry He could
not, howevei, see the propuety of transferring
the duties from the present officer to another—
nothing could be gained by it
The duties of the diaftsman were not confined
to the Com mi tee or the Post OfEce The Com-
mittees on Public ard Private Land Claims, and
on Roads and Canals, lequired the constant ser-
vices or this officer Several of the members of
his family were also engaged in aiding him in tne
performance of his duties If an inquiry was ne-
cessary , it was a ma ter of doubt to what commit-
tee it should go About once in two years, when
the Committee on the Post Office reported a bill
creating new post routes, the services of the drafts-
man weie necessary The other committees to
which he had íeferred, required his services almost
daily In conclusion, he could see 110 reason
for a change It was the duty of the Clerk of the
House to see that this officer did his duty, and if
Mi Burr had been employed by the Clerk, it was
his duty to explain why this had been done
Mi LOVE said, as a general rule, he was in
favor ot resolutions of inquiry He was satisfied
his fnend from Georgia [Mr Schley] had no
other motive in offering the resolution, than a high
regard to duty and the public interest—that he
was actuated by no sinister views He knew that
se'eialof the sons of the draftsman for the House,
who were every way competent, were engaged m
aiding him m the peiformance of his duties It
should, therefore, not be an objection to him that
he spent three hou'S each day in reporting the
speeches of members, (m a manner, too, better
than any other reporter ) It would be recollected
that after much debate at a former session, on the
subject Df reiorm, the only result was an abolí-
