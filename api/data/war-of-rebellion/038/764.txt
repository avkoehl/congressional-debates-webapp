point, except as above stated. The enemy were certainly making no attempt to enter the Hushpuckanaw or the Sunflower, between the points named. Nor were there any indications that they had made any such attempt. Captain [John G.] Kelly, acting engineer officer, examined the head branches of the Sunflower and the entrances to the Hushpuckanaw. His report in reference thereto, and a map of these streams, drawn by him, are herewith forwarded. * From his report and your instructions I did not deem it necessary to put additional obstructions into the Sunflower of Hushpuckanaw. For the particulars as to the accompanying map. The Mississippi River at Lewis' Swamp and the Sunflower at Bobo's had each fallen about 24 inches on the morning of the 16th instant, and were then falling rapidly. During the night before, the Mississippi River fell at that point about 4 inches. At the mouth of Hushpuckanaw the fall was not more than 1 foot altogether. The upper Sunflower, from Governor Mathew's place, is a rich and well cultivated country, much of the land above overflow. A large number of beef-cattle and a large amount of corn and bacon can be procured for the army from the planters on that river and the Hushpuckanaw. When the waters fall, all of that section will be much exposed to the depredations of marauding parties of the enemy. The planters are anxious to have troops stationed there for their protection. It is believed that a force sufficient to protect the property there from marauding parties would be well employed. It would save the provisions now there, and would enable the planters to raise another crop of breadstuffs and hogs. As soon as the waters fall so as to be within the banks, a boat without a guard will be in danger of being captured at any point un the upper Sunflower. Believing it to be my duty under your orders to return with by command, after making the examination above mentioned, I left Bobo's on the morning of the 16th instant, having taken on 2,500 bushels of corn. At McLeod's place we saw a large number of negroes cutting and floating, timber to construct a raft there. McLeond's is 12 miles above Garvin's Ferry; his farm is above the overflow. The river makes a horseshoe bend there, about 2 1/2 miles around and about a half mile across. The land is cleared across the heels, and at the upper heel is the highest ground, and the river there makes a sharp bend to the north; the land is overflowed on both sides above the clearing. This boat arrived at the fork of the Sunflower at 3 o'clock this evening when I received an order from General Lee directing me to proceed to Rolling Fork and await orders from Colonel Ferguson, if he was there; it not, to proceed to Snyder's Bluff. Colonel Ferguson is at Rolling Fork. I was also ordered to sent to Colonel Ferguson a synopsis of this report, which I have done.

I am, sir, most respectfully, your obedient servant,

EDMUND W. PETTUS,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding Sunflower Expedition.
