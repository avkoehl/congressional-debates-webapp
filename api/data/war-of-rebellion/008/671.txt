WATSON'S LANDING, TENN.,

April 7 (via Cairo, April 8, 1862).

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

The movement across the river has been a great success. The divisions of Generals Paine, Stanley, and Hamilton have advanced, and we believe will occupy Tiptonville before morning. About 100 prisoners, three pieces of light artillery, eleven large cannon in batteries, camp equipage, and other property have been captured here. Enemy left in great haste. Gunboats have been sent below Tiptonville to capture any transports that may appear and prevent the escape of the enemy. The large floating battery (fourteen guns), that the enemy towed from New Orleans to Island Numbers 10, came down the river adrift this evening and has been secured. We leave for Island Numbers 10 at daybreak.
