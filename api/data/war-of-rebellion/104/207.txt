31, that a naval force is said to be at Magnolia, Miss., with five launches, proposing to come down to Lake Maurepas, capture the gun boat, take the guns from Fort Stephens, and then attempt the release of the prisoners at Ship Island. An Irishman named Flynn, a short, thickset man of sandy complexion, who was been jayhawking on or near Blind River, is coming in, pretending to be a refugee, as spy for them. A deserter from Todd's battery, Mobile, states that they number fifty-five men, mostly old citizens. They occupied Redoubt No. 4, on the inner line of works, when he left, March 22. The redoubts of the inner line are all armed with four or five heavy guns, as far as they came under his observation. This line is not in the best repair, but the ditch is wide and deep, and the work quite formidable. He had no opportunity of gaining more information in regard to troops.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

A. M. JACKSON,

Major, Tenth U. S. Colored Heavy Artillery.

(In absence of Captain S. M. Eaton, chief signal officer, Military Division of West Mississippi.)
