APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
Treasury Note Bill—Mr. Lane.
Jan. 1841
H. of Reps
* of the measure, I should oppose it on the ground
that it is not the best means of supplying a defi-
ciency in the revenue  it is temporary in its dura-
tien, deceptive m its character, and can only result
m sinking us de«per and deeper in debt.    Mr
Chairman, it appear  to me that the remedy pro-
posed falls very far short of the evil intended to be
remedied.   We should not only provide for the de-
ficit in revenue for the present year, but we should,
as prudent and patriotic representatives, provide
for the deficit which must exist during the next, un
less speedily provided for.   The Secretary of the
Treasury tells us that, during the year 1842, under
the operations of the compromise act, tnere will be
a diminution of duties to the amount oí $5,000,000
Sir, we must provide for that deficiency also, and
we should now provide for a distribution  of the
proceeds of the sales of the public lands among
th* several States, to which it justly belongs, an 1
of which I shall presently take occasion to speak.
Let us now see bow the Secretary of the Treasury
proposes to remedy the deficiency in the Treasury
He proposes these different methods   First, he hm s
that a portion of the surplus revenue heretofore de-
posited with the States might be recalled, but he
seems to abandon that project himself    And, Mr,
who believes that any portion of that deposite nil
ever be recalled?   Who is bold enough to n*e here
in his place and propose it?   No one    Another
plan named by the Secretary is to íesort to direct
taxes.   Is this to be the end of that system of
financial quackery which has so long cursed the
country?   Let the party now in power propose it if
they dare, and they will find that, even though they
are labelled with the time honored  and glorious
word Democracy, they could not stand before their
constituents long enough to be knocked down
1 desire, Mr Chairman, to show how a direct
tax would operate upon the people of Indiana.
The dsficit for the year 1849, as I have shown
from the report of the Secretary of the Treasury,
will be from ten to twelve millions of dolíais add
to that the proceeds of the public lands, which will
be distributed among the States as soon a* public
opinion is properly reflected and truly represented
on this floor, the deficit will then be swelled to the
amount of perhaps fifteen millions of dollars, cer-
tainly as much as fourteen millions of dollars
But for the argument, put the deficiency at ten
millions of dollars, and then Indiana, according to
her population, will have to íaise four hundred
thousand dollars to meet this deficit by a direct tax,
and in order to sustain our State Government, and
to pay the accruing interest on our internal im-
provement debt, we shall have to raise at least six
hundred thousand dolíais by a tax Add this sum
lo the four hundred thousand dollars, and you see
tn« State oí Indiana would have lo collect annu-
ally, by a direct tax, one million of dollars' In-
diana, with all her vast and increasing resources,
could not collect this immense and startling amount
of revenue
The Secretary also proposes to meet this defi-
ciency by reducing the appropriations below the
estimates, with what candor, let the facts answer.
My colleague [Mr Pboffit] introduced, some time
(since, a resolution of inquiry, directed to the Se-
cretary of the Treasury, asking him lo inform Con-
gress in what particulars the appropriations might
be reduced below the estímales that resolutun
of inquiry was promptly voted down by a party
rote.
I now come, Mr. Chairman, to the only practica-
ble mode of meeting this deficiency in the revenue
which is suggested by the Secretary of the Tiea-
sury; and that is, an extensive modification of the
tariff laws. Public expediency and public justice
alike require that those laws should be modified
We should at once lay a sufficient tariff on foreign
luxuries to meet the deficiency in the Treasury now
existing; and to enable Congress to distribute
among the States the proceeds of the sales of the
public lands, the true course of policy to be pur-
sued is, I think, to lay a duty on French wines and
silks, and fine linens and spices, and upon all other
article  of luxury which are now admitted duty
ree What is now the operation of your tariff
aws? They operate mainly upon articles oí neces-
rty—arttclw .consumed alike by the rich and the
poor, and upon which all pay toe same duty on the
amount consumed, but the wealthy pay no duty on
their fine silks *nd costly wines The gentleman
from Mississippi TMr Thompson! and his political
associates have heretofore claimed lo be the exclu-
sive friends of the poor man, and we find them
ready to vote against raising revenue by a duty
upon the luxurious indulgencies of the rich, when
the only alternative is to raise the amount by a di-
rect tax upon the rich and the pool. Sir, this is,
to my mind, a very equivocal manifestation oí
friendship for the poor, and one for which the gen-
tleman and his friends w ill receive no thanks from
them, for I believe, as I believe in my own exist-
ence, that if this question weie now put to the Ame-
rican people, nmeiy-nme of ta«m oui of every hun-
dred would prefer to raise revenue by a duty on fo-
reign luxuries, instead of a direct tax. Let the ho
norable gentleman and his fuends go and tell the
people that they are their best friends, because they
refuse to lay a duty on foreign luxuries consumed
only by the rich, m order that the tax gatherer may
have an occasion to pay them a friendly visit, to
assess their lands, their houses, and all their per-
sonal property, to raise revenue to support the Ge-
neral Government think you that the hard-handed
and noble hearted pioneers of the West will be de-
ceived by a pretext so shallow? No, sir, no They
will treat this pretended friendship as they did the
doctrine recently promulgated, that the poor man
was to be íelieved by reducing the miserable pit-
tance which rewards his daily toil
But, Mr Chairman, theie are other and vastly
important reasons why this tarifl on French wines
and silks should be laid bv us <-nd now Sir, look
to the histoiy of our trade with France for the last
five years. During that time we h ive, upon an
average, imported from France goods to the
amount of twenty-eight millions and a half of dol-
lars per annum, and of that amount seventeen
millions have been admitted free of duty For the
same period, we have annually exponed to France,
of our productions, only to the amount of about
fifteen millions of dollars, and upon the articles of
our exportation we have paid a heavy, and «n
many articles, a most oppressive duty From this
trade between this country and France, there is an
annual balance against us of about fourteen mil-
lions of dollars This balance must be mainly
paid by an annual exportation of gold and silver
from this country to France
But the honorable gemleman tells us that this
scheme to tax French wines and silks is a shot
aimed at French interests And has it come to
this, that we cannot manage our own legislation as
we please, without being taunted vuth enmity to
France, or with British influence' This duty can
be laid without violating either the letter or spirit
of thi.(ompromisebilloi 1833 Sir I am, I trust,
the last man who would be willing lo violate tne
provisions of that bi'l I rt member too well the
circumstances undei which i  wa* passed A
sovereign State had assumed an attitude at war
alike with the laws and Constitution of the Repub-
lic Disunion and civil war was threatened The
gallant vessel of State, which had for half a cen-
tury withstood "the tempest's shock and battle's
rage," was about to be engulfed beneath the moun-
tain waves of political commotion Then it was
that the thrilling and commanding eloquence of
Henry Clay was hearl above the fury of the storm,
proclaiming peace to all, without compromitung
the honor of any ' I am not disposed to disturb
that noble peace offenrg upon the altar of my
country It was then, as now, regarded as the
bow ol peare and ot promise, overarching the
storms which threatened our beloved counirj, and
may God perpetuate that sentiment forever '
I have no doubt of the constitutional power of
Congress to pass a protective tariff law, but I think
that its exercise is not now called for, turther than
our present duties for revenue operate as a protec-
tion to American manufactures I have said that
the provisions of the compromise bill should no' be
disturbed, bm a state or things may arise when
some modification of that act may be proper and
necessary for instance, if we should be involved
m a war, or if the present rate of duties would i.ot
yield a revenue sufficient to meet the wants of the
Treasury, under an economical administration of
the Government
Mr. Chairman, the subject of  the public lands
has been referred to by tne honorable gentleman
from Mississippi, and, it seems to me,  wih great
propriety, inasmuch as the public land is one great
source of our national revenue    The honorable
gentleman seems to think that the measure of dis-
tribution ¡s unconstitutional, and complains that it
is now considered aimost out of order to quote
from that sacred instrument     I grant you, Mr.
Chan man, that, for the last few years, that sacred
chart of a nation's freedom does seem to have been
almost forgot en, but, sir, who should complain of
this?   The gentleman and his friends'—the party
now in power'   Sir, it but ill becomes that party,
whose triumphant march for the last twelve years
has been over the broken fragments of the Consti
tution, to talk of its infraction, that party whose
ruthless action mutilated the journals of the Se-
nate, and, at the mandate of one  man, prostrated
the proudest deliberative assembly  upon earth at
the footstool of Executive power, that party which
so recently disfranchised a sovereign State, for the
purpose of fixing  the odious and   anti-American
Sub Treasury system upon the country, they, for-
sooth, are now the friends of the country    I hope
that the late overwhelming and unprecedented de-
feat of the party in  power will bring about  a
wholesome change of measures and change of prac-
tice, and that hereafter the Constitution shall again
become the text-book of national legislation.    We
find that Congress, by the express terms of the
Constitution, has the unlimited power to dispose of
the public lands and other property of the United
States as they may deem fit,  being  governed only
by a sound discretion    This power to dispose of
the public lands does not depend upon construction
or  implication,   but is  most explicitly granted.
There is surely nothing m  the  deeds of cession
limiting the power of Congress over this subject
The public lands were ceded by  Virginia, New
York, Geoigia, and all the other States that made
cessions, for the mutual benefit of all the States
then composing the  United States, and all other
States which should afterwards be  admitted into
the Union    These grants of cession embrace all
the public lands within our territorial limits, as de-
fined by the treaty of peace of 1783, and over that
portion oí our public domain which we acquired by
the purchase from France of Louisiana, and from
Spain of Florida     No one, it seems  lo me, can
doubt our full and unlimited cons'itutional power.
The whole action of the  Government,  from  its
commencement, has proceeded on the ground'that
«he has the entire control of the  public lands.    If
Congress has not such power, what becomes of the
title to the immense grants of land which we have
to the States, to corporations,  and  to individuals
I take it for granted, then, from the Constitution?
from the deeds of cession, from the very nature of
the subject, that we have the right to dispose of the
public lands    The question  is,  then, ^presented,
What is the most just and equitable mode of dispo-
sition'   The cession of the lands to the States in
which they he has been propos d.    Are there any
constitutional objections against distribution which
do not hold with greater force against cession? The
argument is, that we cannot distribute the proceeds
of the lands equitably among all the States enti-
tled to them, but that we can give the land exclu-
sively to a part of the States.   This i  bad logic,
and worse morals
Sir, the noble old Commonwealth of Virginia, by
her munificent and patriotic grant of all that immense
tract of country northwest ot the Ohio river, for the
common benefit of all the States, Virginia inclu-
sive, evinced a liberal ty and patriousm having no
paralle1 m the history of nations. And shall we
defeat the object of tha  grant by diverting the reve-
nue derived from that source from its proper ob
jects, or oy giving the lands to a few of the States?
I trust not The other grants of cession were sub-
stantially the same as the grant from Virginia, and
on the same terms, and subject to the same condi-
tions I desire briefly to show the committee how
the State, a part of whose citizens I have the ho
nor to represent, would be affected by cession. If
the proposition made by a distinguished Senator
