Major General JOHN G. PARKE,

Army of the Potomac:

Following received by Major Hutchins:

The rebel gun-boats came down the river last night. Daylight showed four of them aground between Howlett's and the Crow's Nest Tower. We blew one up, and the other three are still aground. We are pegging away at them, and hope to annihilate them before night, but they shed our shot handsomely. Have been up all night. Had a rally on the right of our picket-line, but our men did not lose a foot. Wish you were over here to see the sight.

Yours, with much regard,

GEO. A. HICKS.
