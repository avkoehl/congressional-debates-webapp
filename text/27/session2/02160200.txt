But as the Senator from South Carolina [Mr Preston] had,
two or three times in the course of hisreniarka, releired toa
work of great interest, to the people of the State which he bad
the honor m part to represent, and m relation to which a b 11
introduced by himsell was now pending befoie a committee of
this body, he took the occasion to say that he hoped the bill
would not be prejudged before the proper time armed for a
decision, and that the work it proposed would not be confound
ed with otner objects When the proper time came he wouid
endeavor to show, with the indulgence of the teenate, that it
was not only the right, but the duty of this Government, to
reopen the old channel of communication from the ocean to
Albemarle sound He would say no more at present, as he
tonsidered this debate on the puntmgofa memorial altogethei
irregular
Mi WHITE said he was glad that he had brought this s ib
ject before the Senate, since it had provoked a debate between
two of the veterans ot the Senate He should say no moie,
but for the reference of the Senator to a tariff of protection
He had not alluded to the subject when up before, and shout t
say nothing upon the subject now hut for reference to the sub
jeclby the Senator from ssouth Carolina At the proper time
he would argue this question At present he would say, that
the West had its full propoition of the buidens of the Govern
ment, that the West consumed m full proportion to the ¡south
and East Th* argument he had before used had been called
hy the Senator flora South Carolina an ttigumenlum ad ab
surdum, for the reason that it would be liable to abuses He
thought not, and that the Senatoi's own opposition showed
more of the argumefitumadconienienti than sound reason
mg Difficulties, it was true, might attend the execution of his
plans m regard to commerce, and sj difficulties would attend
every plan that might b^submitted
Mr W was disposed to continue the discussion at length,
hut the hour being late and the --enatoi from Pennsylvania
JMr Buchanan] wishing for the orders of the day, he #ould

Mr WOODBRIDGE piesenteda memorial of 254 citizens

a proposition as one of the most danguoui chuactei, and, not
doubting the purity or patriotism ol the Seuilor [Mi Clay]
who had embodied that proposition into the resolution-, tindei
discussion, he was led to believe it had uaoiigm m ancironeouo
impression as to the nature of the veto powei exiting in the
jExecutiveof this Government rheSenator, utidet therms
conception, had identified the veto powei given by the Coiistitu
tion to the Prebident 01 the United States with that Jtiven bv iht-
Constitution of Gieat Butdin to the King of England Now ho
(Mr B ) contended that nothing could be mou nroneous than
this impression and the  uiatoi himself | Mr Ciat<] woulH

Government with the internal lmpiovements of the Statp^ and
the distribution of the public lands He enumerved thp=¡e n

<£Ufflaia§tion of Congress m regensideung tho*?e measures, the
majonties always decieasing with sober second thoughts, and
the approbation of tne people in every instance being signally
manifested Mi B next showed that the only Executive offi-
cer of this Go\ ernment coming directly from the whole body of
the people is the President, dud that he is necessarily more de
pendent on the whole of the people than on the representatives
in the National Legislatuie He denied that the re
piesentative bodies ttuly represented the majoiity of
the people, for one fouith of the people could send
a majauty of Senatois into this chamber, and
in the other branch, tne frequent instances m which the
voice of the peop'e had decided against the voice oí itsmajouty,
wer^ sufficient evidences of the fact that a majori y there could
lot be con«ideied as sneaking the sentiments of a majority of
the people A recent and remarkable proof of this had been
given in the late e ections, through which the country had pre
nounred judgment against the measures of the extra session,
camel by majorities m both Houses of Congress That public
j udgm^nt, besides condemning the course of the representative
majorities, had sustained the exercise of the veto power by
which the President had appealed to the decision oí the people
Mr B next diew a pat allel between the veto power of the Ro
man tribunes and that vested in the President of the United
States deducing that the indisputable intention was for the pro
tectionof the people from the encroachments of other govern
men'al powers m the hand-, of those prone to accumulate powei
for a siiong rule of the people

And the question being on its adoption—
The yeas and nays were asked and ordered
Some conversation occurred between Mr blLMER and the
SPEAKER touching an objection made by Mr. G  on a former
day to the introduction of the resolutions
When the SPEAKER said that this being nota resolution of
an ordinary character, but one connected with the question of
privilege, and which the gentleman from Massachusetts [Mr
Adams] had declared to be indispensable to his defence, it was     4
iiow properly belore the House for i'sconsideration
Mr. GILB1ER then (addressing Mr Adams) inquired wheth
pr, if the House adopted the 1 esolutions, that gentleman intended
to move a postponement of the questien)
Mr ADAMS I do not admit the right of the gentleman
from Viremia to demand of me—
[Mr GILMER    I do not claim it as a r ght ]
Mr Adams (continuing)—oí me, standing in the position
of a criminal before the House, what I shall do in consequence
of the House perfoiming an act of justice to me, by granting
me evidence which I may deem indispensable to my defence
I claim no privilege of him as prosecutor, and want him to ask
none of me as criminal
Mr GILMER said he did not piofess to be a porsecutoi in the
case, and it struck him as somewhat singular that the gentle-
man liom Mas-achusetts [Mr Addms] should insist on regard
ing himself as a criminal
The SPEAKER said he could not peimitthis discussion to
go i n, it would lead tu debate
And the SPEAKER repeated that, m the opinion of the
Chair, it was his duty to submit the resolutions to the
House
Mr GILMER «md, if, then, the resolution was in the
possession of the House, he would move that it be laid on the
table
i he SPEAKER said that motion would be inoidei
Mi \RNOID as-ked the >ea^ and nays, which weie or-
deied
Mr TONES of MaiyUnd moved that the whole suhjectbe
Idi 1 on the table
On which mot'on the \eas and nays were asked, and or-
deied
Mr HOPKINS moved a call of the House, whiüi was oi~
dercd
Mi AD VMS was undeistood to request the gentleman from
Maryland [Mi Jones] to withdraw his motion to lay the whola
subject on the table, and he (Mr A ) would say that no friend
to his rightt,as a member of this House—no friend to the rights
0! the people—noinenlto the right of habeas corpus, which
wassaciedto the people oí the United State* —nofnend to the
right of trial by imy—
The SPE4KLR, here interiuptedMr A and eaid that these
remaiks weie not m older, pending the motion to lay the whol 
subject on the ubi
Mi AD \M& c mtinued I simply request every such per-
son to abstain hcieaftei fiom any mo ion to pottponeor to lay
the subject on the table, or ftom any ether thirg by which a
direct vote, ay 01 no, on the proposition of the gentleman from
Kentucky, [Mr Maishaf l ] wdl be evaded.
Mr JONES, of Varjlond, briefly explained Ihegentie-
man from Mastdchu etts [ t 1 Adams] had many times, m the
coiuse of the pi >ceedinffs m this cvue, declared that he would
not be responsible for the time which mignt be consumed
thenn He (Mr T) lor his part, was not willing to be re-
sponsible for 1 aid tnerefore he had made the motion to lay
the who e subjec on the table, in order to test the sense of the
House
Mi ADAMS The gent'eman has done me the honor to re-
fer to a proposition which I have again and again made, to yield
to any motion by which this sulject should be dismissed If
the House think prorei lodoso, lam willing to submit But
I give rotice to tie House that I have done with all proposi-
ta lis of that kind on my pait, and that I now claim the time of
this nanon for that defence which these gentlemen have foiced
upon me Í claim a decision, ay or no, upon the proposition
of"the Gentleman fiom Kentucky
