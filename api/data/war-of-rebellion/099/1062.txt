AUGUSTA, GA., January 30, 1865-8 p. m.

General STEVENSON:

GENERAL: I think that there can be no doubt that Sheraman is advancing in earnest and that the affair will be decided this week. I hope that you will keep your in motion and not wait transportation by rail. The railroad is entirely in the hands of Yankees and they delay every movement. More than half of the two advanced brigades have deserted. Can nothing be done to prevent it? I send this by an offiscer with the hope that the troops may be hurried up.

Very respectflly,

D. H. HILL,

Major-General.
