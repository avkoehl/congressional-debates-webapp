Invention, of Steamboats—Mr. Rumsey.
Ho. op Reps.
tently devoted himself, and which, in some of the
modes which he contemplated, he must, had time
been allowed, have completed. He was not per-
mitted to live to witness the realization of the high
design which he had conceived,and the consum-
mation of which he never doubted, to use his own
bold language," the navigation of ourgreat rivers,
the lakes, the gulf stream, the ocean itself, by the
agency of steam "
Mr Speaker, ítis evident, from the inforrhation
before the committee who reportpd this resolu-
tion, that Rumsey, from the introductory letters
which he carried, fiom the high order of mechan-
ical gemus which he displayed, and the daring
and original project which he was attempting,
attracted some attention in fondón, and secured
to himself the acquaintance and friendship of
many respectable men It is fair to piesume that
other intelligent Americans, then resident in Lon-
don, would have formed some acquaintance both
with him and the novel design he was prosecut-
ing. It is known that Fulton was for many years,
dunn£ and after this period, living in Europe, and
spending much of his time in London, and, in the
absence of all other proof, it could scarcely be
believed that he, with a talent for these things,
with a mind directed to sucli objects, would have
failed m becoming acquainted with, and interest-
ing himself in the opeiationsof, his countryman,
who was occupying a position of painful promi-
nence, so much so that, as he states in a lettei to
his brother, his project was the frequent subject
of newspaper rcmaik, and even of " play-houst>
wit " But all doubt is removed by the letter of
Rumsey to his friend, Mr "West, in Amenca, in
which he speaks of Fulton as if they were on
terms of intimacy Does not the conclusion al-
most irresistibly follow that, from this association
■with Rumsey, and acquaintance with his plans,
Pulton was advanced in knowledge, was \cd to
reflect, and ultimately to act on this subject' And,
whether his application of steam power was iden-
tical or dissimilar, original or derived, wholly
new or modifications and improvements on some
of Rumsey's plans, still it appeals to me that it
would be cruel injustice to the memory of this
persevering, ardent, talented, but unfoitunate
man—unfoitunate in being cut off in the purneof
life, and in the midst of Tus career—to say that
tho woild was under no obligation to him for an
invention so incalculably, so supiomely impoit
ant ^.
If further evidence were wanting to prove that
this acquaintance with Rumsey was not inoper-
ative in turning Pulton's attention to the steam-
boat, it will be found m the fact that he was en
gaged m it in 1793, very shortly after the death
of Rumsey This is apparent from his coire
spondence with Loid Stanhope, who himself
made some expeuments in 1795 Fulton went
to Europe for tne purpose of introducing his tor-
pedo for the explosion of ships, but, after the
death of Rumsey, the steamboat seems to have
engaged his chief attention until his final success
in 1807 It is known, and so stated by hisbiogia-
pher, that, before his return to America, he was
for many years actively employed in studying
the subject, in constructing a vawety of models,
and making a series of experiments on a small
scale And when it is recollected that fifteen
years thus elapsed before he obtained a motion
much exceeding five miles an hour, it is matter
of admiration that Rumsey, without any reflect-
ed lights, should, in the short period allowed
him, have effected so much
Mr Speaker, I have understood—I know not
with what truth, but I believe the fact is em-
bodied in Colden's Life—that when Fulton made
his first essay before the city of New Yoik, a
vast multitude assembled—most of them doubt-
ers, disbelievers, sneerers After a few revolu-
tions of the engine, some accident occurred from
imperfect machinery, leading to a temporal y sus-
pension of the experiment A sybilant voice
arose from the crowd, " We said so We knew
it would not do " Scorn and derision were poured
forth upon the man who, improving upon the
labors of his predecessor, Rumsey, was doing
more for the benefit of his species than has evei
been effected by all the mighty armies and victo-
rious chiefs,
" from Macedonia's madman to the Swede "
Now, suppose thatFulton,before remedying the
defect, had suddenly died—in aland of strangers,
too—leaving no one with legal authority to act
for him; leaving no one interested in his design,
of skill and talent to consummate it, poor, em-
bairassed, in debt, with executions levied on his
very boat and engine, and merely suspended as
a matter of special grace, until this trial should
be made, suppose, from these or the like causes,
the completion of the steamboat had been post-
poned for another twenty years, at the end of
which time some other ingenious man who had
witnessed Fulton's efforts, who was intimate %vith
his plans, who had been deeply impressed by
his powerful and lucid arguments, and warmed
and excited to take an interest in the subject by
his bold and sanguine spirit, had, after long pri-
vate preparation, openly resumed the project, and,
under more favorable auspices, from a more ad-
vanced state of the mechanic arts, or the benign
influence of a more liberal patronage, had suc-
ceeded, triumphantly succeeded, in establishing
the utility of the steamboat, eithei on some of
Fulton's plans, or by modifications and ímpiove-
ments of his own now, I ask the friends of Ful-
ton whether, in this state of tho case—and more
especially if his had been the original effoit—his
memory should have gone down into oblivion
unknown and unhonoied by his countiy? As
success alone, naked success, is the cntenon by
which the world forms its estimate of meiit, I
know this other individual would, generally, have
monopolized the honoi, but the inquiiing, the
reflecting, and the just, would not have passed
unregarded the name of Fulton
Mr Speaker, I would not, if I could, take a
single ray from the just fame of Fulton It is ad
muted on all hands that he improved upon, and
fiist bioadly intioduecd the steamboat into gt n
eral use, and for this alone he is entitled to the
boundless and eternal giatitude of mankind The
world has been liberal in the conferí nee of honor
—something, too, his countiy has done foi his
desci ndants —something fuither this II hisl jho
posed doing at the hue session To that mi ab
ure, when it was fust up—the only oeuision win n

would have íaised my voice in its fivoi, Ind I
not been sensible that a cause sustain* d, as it w is,
by the feivid eloquence and poweiful aigumtnts
of the gentlemen fiom South Caiohni, Pennsyl-
vania, New Yoik, and Kentucky, [Messis Ll-
GARD,BiDDLC,HorrMAN,and Chambcbs,] needed
not my feeble advocacy But in denying him on
ginahty, I do him no injustice He nevei claimed
it himself His partial biographer cannot claim
it for him The very first act of the New York
Legislature in his favor, in 1798, recognizes him
not as the inventor, but the improver All men
who have looked into the subject know that it
did not begin with him Long before, the design
had been conceived, to a good extent accom-
plished, its practicability proved, and was per
sisted in and prosecuted under the most favor
able circumstances, with unwaveung confidence
and iriepressible resolution, until his dying hour,
by James Rumsey, but for his acquaintance with
whom, it is pi obable the powerful mind of Fulton
would nevei have been brought to act upon the
subject, and but foi whom it is probable the
world would yet have been without the benefits
of the steamboat
Mr Speakei, there was but one individual who
contested Rumsey's title to priority in the apph
cation of steam to navigation, and about his
claims I wish to make a remark or two, in a spmt
of candor and charity, for, as to the experiment
ascribed to the Spaniard Garay, three hundred
years ago, and mentioned by the gentleman from
Ohio, [Mr Duncan,] at the last session, when I
was not present, I can only say, that if any such
ever was made, all knowledge of it had sunk into
Utteroblivion Ages—centunes had rolled round,
and the most profound silence and ignorance pre
vailed m iegaid to it It was unknown to his-
tory—unknown to tradition—and could have had
no influence whatever in bringing forward the
steamboat in comparatively modern times I
acknowledge that this statement appears to me to
be an entire fiction, that, if there be such a rec-
ord, it was not based upon fact It can scarcely
be credited by any one who will look into the
history of the origin, progress and improvement
of the steam-engine, which, more than two hun-
dred years afterwards, was used for scarcely any
purpose except pumping water from mines, where
but little machinery, and nothing but a simple
rectilinear action, was required If Garay was
thus three centuries in advance of all the world,
while his genius challenges our highest admira-
tion, we are forced to acknowledge that he lived
in vain, for, if the ai chives of the Spam«h*mon-
archy do present any basis foi this statement,
there it would have mouldered into dust, if the
success of the steamboat in this new woild had
not given interest to everything connected with
the subject, and caused the eye of some antiqua-
rian to rest upon the passage, which would oth-
wise have been neglected as unintelligible or in-
credible
I said, Mr Speaker, there was but one person
contested Rumsey'stitle to precedence It isstated
in the American Supplement to Rees's Encyclo-
pedia, on the subject of steam, that Fitch made
an experiment on the Delaware in 1783 If this
were true, he preceded Rumsey, but I challenge
the world to pioduce the testimony of a respect-
able witness, living or dead, to corroborue this
statement None such cin be produced The as-
seition isutteilycrioneous, Fitch himself did not
claim to have thought of steam navigation untii
1785 In 1787 he built a boat and machine!y on
the Delawaie, and mode his fiist expeiimmts
in 1788 These facts are very cleaily proven by
various evidence beloie the committee I will
reeapituhte but a part The letter of Gen"ia!
Washington to Goveinoi Johnson, wntten in No-
vember, 1787, which I have befoie adverted to,
says that Rumsey communicated tohim ' issteam
boat invention in Novembei, 1784, and that some
j time aiterwards Fitch cillcd upon him, claiming
' fot hiivisf If a similar invention, and lequesung an
mtioduetoiy lettei, " which he (Washington) de
rlimd giving, and went so fu as to infoim Mr
Fitch that, th nigh lie Mas not at libi rty to dis-
| elosi iht jnineipli s of Mi Rumsi y's discoveiy,
' he could lentuie to nssuie linn that he (Fitch)
was not ondina!, but that the ldia had bi en com
mimical! d to him by Mi Rumsey " Now, as
, Rumsey mide no i immumcition on the subject
' to Washington until November, 1781, it is ¡nob-
able that tins niteiview on the part of I itch did
not take place until the year following, and, in
deed, as I will hi íeaftci show, not until the com
mencement of 1786, and, m either case, it was at
a time when Rumsey was exciting every nerve m
preparing for that experiment which he made on
the Potomac in 1786, and which I have befoie
mentioned At all events, it was long after the
private experiment which Rumsey made in 1784,
in order to test some of the principles of his in-
vention If the statement in the Encyclopedia,
that Fitch made experiments on the Delaware
near Philadelphia, in 1783, were tiue, can it be
believed that Washington, whose comprehensive
vision took in everything likely to be of any use to
his country, would, at so short a distance, have
never heard of it' And if he had never heard of
it, can it be credited that Fitch, whose originality
Was questioned and denied, would have failed in
certifying him of it' And if Washington had
either heard of it before, or been informad pf
it by Fitch at this meeting, could he, to whom
Rumsey had made no disclosure on the subject
until November, 1784, have said to Fitch, Sir,
you are not original, Rumsey is before you' No,
every one will see in that letter, not only a lefu-
tation of the statement in the Encyclopedia, but
a refutation of Fitch's claim to precedence. On
his own presentation of his case—on his own
statements, declarations, and admissions, Wash-
ington refuses to give him a letter, and assure 
him that he has been anticipated by Rumsey.
There is also a letter from Washington to Rum-
sey, written in March, 1786, beanng upon this
point It will be seen in the twelfth volume of
Spaike's Life In this letter Washington urges
Rumsey to bring forward his invention, warns
him that his secret is leaking out, and that other 
will take advantage of it, and goes on to state
that one individual had called on him, claiming
for himself a plan of steam navigation, and re-
questing a letter of introduction, which he de-
clined giving    Now, it can scarcely be doubted
