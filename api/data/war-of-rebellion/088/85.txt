only two divisions of A. P. Hill's corps (Heth's Mahone's) in our front, which, with Beauregard's two divisions, comprises all the force south of the Appomattox. He has no other important information. A deserter from Pegram's battalion of artillery came into the lines of General Crawford, Fifth Army Corps, yesterday morning. Heir information corroborates our latest regarding the position of the enemy, though he has heard of no troops were coming from Hood to Lee. He understands all of Ewell's old corps to be in the Valley with Early. The following is the latest information relative to the position of the different divisions of Lee's and Beauregard's commands: Longstreet-Pickett's division, in front of Major-General Butler; Kershaw's division, in rear of Pickett's in reserve; Field's division, at New market, near Deep Bottom. A. P. Hill-Mahone's division, right of (enemy's) line, south of the Appomattox River; Heth's division, joining the left of Mahone's Wilcox's division, at Chaffin's farm. Beauregard-Hoke's division, on left of Heth's; B. Johnson's, on left of Hoke's, and extending to the Appomattox, in front of the Eighteenth Corps. It is not thought that any force by division has been sent away from Lee's or Beauregard's commands, though accoutering brigades may have left, escaping our notice. The above information is corroborated from all quarters.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
