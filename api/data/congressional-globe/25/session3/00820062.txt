62                                        THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.                      December 27,
did not feel itself at liberty to hesitate in deciding
between an exposure of the publicservice to either
of those extremities, by insisting upon having the
whole of these large sums of money paid at one
time, and placed elsewhere in other suitable de
positones, if any could be found in the present
imperfect state of the law, or a consent to leave
them in the hands of the public debtor until they
were actually wanted, and then to diawfoi them,
in specie or its equivalent, when and wheie the
public service requjred Especially could the De
partment not hesitate when this course wis not
injurious to that service, and it was unable at the
time to withdtaw those funds, except by the debt-
or's voluntary consent
With regard to the othei inquiry undei this
head, as to " what undei stmdmg or airangement,
if any, has taken place respecting the bi nefit
which might accrue to the bank in ttie tiansiei of
money it would make to distant pi ices on account
of the Government," I would it mark that no such
undeistanding oragieementexisted on the fide of
this Depai tment, in i espect to the thn d bond, when
the sale was effected
But soon after this was done, being applied
that the bank entei taintd in impassion, do ivod

War Department, and peihips from the corn-

Deprived as the Department was of most of
its general depositories since the spring of 1837,
and without any specific, well guarded system in-
stead of them having been provided by law, the
drafts of the Treasuier, when any money was
collected, as it has been laigely since the moie
general resumption of specie payments m Au-
gust, were thtrefoiednected to be drawn fiiston
those collectors and lectivers who had no bank of
general deposit, and resided near the place of dis-
buisement
In this way most of the funds in the hands of
collectois and receiveis have been diawn foreai
lust, 01 the amount in then hands kept low by
deposits in appropriate banks, whilt, ill general,
little has been diawn from any banks, except
what was fiom time to time needed to supply
the deficiency
Consequently, their aggiegate balances  have

In conclusion, the resolution  asks fot   " the

tamed, that has been diawn from the Bank of
the United States, its bt anches, or agencies, oi
in notes of said bank, fot paying Indian annui-
ties, 01 other claims of the Indians on the Gov-

Phe  Department geneially has no means of

in this case having been that tht payments should
I bt in specie or its equivalent, and the public cied-
ltois and public officcts knowing that tilt y were
entitled to these, it is to be piesumed tnat they
have geneially, if not always, been made in this
manner
No auangtmenls have been  foimed  by this
Depiitmtnt, noi any mstiuctions givt n by it, as
