Mi Chairman, h has been asserte 1 by gentle-
men that some portion oí this money may become
available b) retrenchment—by w ithholdmg expen-
ditures under the appropriations of ihe last Con-
giesj S r, tl e Secretary of the Tieisury has told
u that "hen the revulsion m the mercantile
affairs of tne country commenced, oi became
seuously /elf, m Ma} last, a mi íute and cnti-
c d exotn nation was instituted of the various
items of api lomiation, to ascertain what could
be defened, in older to leheve the Treasury iiom
anticipaf demb-rrassnent, and ' theresalt was, that
-enough could and would be postponed till neU
year, to amount to aboH $15,000,000 " And upon
this basis, h s cs imate of the condition of the Tiea
smy for the last qaa^tei w a5 made This, it ap-
pears, in h s jadgment is all that could be post-
poned Those who pr pose to rehev e the Treas ny
in Ih s w ay, have not selected t le items which they
would postpone, and I apprehend it would be diffi-
cult for them to do so and should a proposition be
brought uiw ard ¡or this purpose, it w ould take three
months f j s° ect and agree upon the Hems, consi-

Government, but the Government of the people,
instituted by then choice, and for their own exclu-
sive benefit* Your army is the aimv of the peo-
ple, for their piotection, for the piotection of -your
coast and youi fiontieis, joui homes, youi fire-

la ions with foreign Governments, maintained at
con iderable expense, is for the presen ation of the
rights, the honoi, and the dignity of tnat Govern-
ment whim the people have established Talk
about separating the Government from the people,
as though they possessed separa'e and distinct m-
teiests' Wh3,su wnat did the people send us

Wc are but the seiv ants of the people, sent here to
in ike the necessary provision tor the expenses of
th°ir Government, and to adopt such measures as
shifl be^t piomotc the public welfare, within the
constitutional limits assigned u« And this they
expe-t us to do But they have not becone such
soidid woisiij ets of Mammon, as to sacrifice all
th°se high public considerations, and to expect or
wish ns to legislate lor tne relief of puvale embai-
rassment or to ociape out every dollar fiom the
public Ireasuiv, and distribute it among them
Wnen gen lemcnci mplam that no measuies ot re-
lief to tl e people aie proposed, I would like to
kn ivi «hat measures of relief thev have in view—
whit do they propose1 Vftei the President's Mes
sage had been lead in this House, it wis then
stated, that it coma ned no plan for the relief of the
people The Chairman of the Committee of Way s
and Means, in his place, s ud he hoped gentlemen
would be as bold ard frank a-the PiesuUnt had
been, in bringing forward tlfir measuies of
relief Tne replv was, "we shall offei no íe-
medv—we have no measures to propose " Sir,
I   had  heard   that   thi*.   was  to be  the   course
of policy of the opposition, before I started
foi this p'ace, I had seen it in the newspapers, it
has been announced here And, while it his been
said they would propose no measure of relief, it
has been believed they would oppose every pnpo-
sttun the ^dmimsti a ion oris friends should pre-
sent But this, I hope and trust, will not be so I
hope gentlemen will not be controlled by conside-
rations so narrow ,as to oppose eveiy thing and pro
pose nothing, thus keeping the countrv in continual
agitaron and suspense that they ma} u'timateiy
arnve at tint (bject which they have so much at
heart—a ctiartei foi a United States Bank This,
sir, is the onlv rerned},the mil} íelief measure,
which I have heard suggested by that partv, cither
here oi elsewhere It is, with them, the grand
panacea that is to remove all political and pecu-
niary embanassments. But, sir, I apprehend the
period is too fai distant for relief to come through
this channel The lesouices, the energy, and the
enterprise of the countr}, are too great for the
people to remain embana^sed and dittressel
long enough for this event to happen, the}
will not soon be induced, from panic and pres-
sure, real or lictitious, to throw themstlies,
foi íehef inti the an s ot an institution vh ch
so lecentli they have found i most formida-
b'e political enemy, boldly entering the political
arena, and doing battle with the powerful weapons
ofMcalth and influence against the administration
of the countr} And the sooner the friends of a
nation ! bank settle it in then minds that the peo-
ple of the^-e United States w ill not yield to their
wisnes in this lespect, and act accordingly, thev
will, in m} humble judgment ltmove one of th

The gieat agncultural interest of the countiyhas

ment of the gentleman fiom South Caiohna, (Mr
Pickens )
I suppose all tho'-e who wi'l vote for the amend-
ment, but are opposed to the bill without it aban-
don the "-round of a contiact binding the action of
this Gov ernment for if } ou can by enactment
postpone one veai, you can fi\e, ten, or indefi-
nitely It b cimes then, merely a question of
expediency as to tim  whether it shall be fixel
for some futme day certain that vou will deposite
w ith the States ov er nine millions of dollars, oi
whetAei, bv an indefinite postponement, )0n vviU
leive it foi Congitss hereafter to be totemed bv
the condition of the Tieasmy For the piesent
purposes of the Treasury, the amendment will
accomplish all that w ould be accomplished by the
oiigrmal bill It will afford the temporary relief
desired, but as to the future deposite with the States,
I prefer leaving that for digress to determine
heieaftei I am unwilling to hjld out to the States
the expectation that this deposne will be made
on the first of January, 1839, when, perhaps,
at that time, iou vull hive in the Treasury no
money to deposite and especial'y am I opposed
to pledging the f-ith of this Government that
it shall be made at that time, - whether we
hive the mems or ro% as proposeel by thehonoia-
ble gentleman fi m Massachusetts (Mr Adams )
I can not consent, by my v ote to pledge the faith ot
this Gov ernment to an} such measure Mv col-
league (Mi Fostei) mquned i it \as not the in-
tent on to cairy out the pioviMons of the law, m
making the last instalment, sooner or later1 So far
as my ote is concerned, I oo n t intend it --hall be
given to deposite money ith ihe Stages for safe-
keeping when \ ou have none in tne Tieasury to
deposite, and may have to le^ort to a loan oi other
me^ns, to rai^e it for that puipose I holJ the law
to be, what t was profess et to be a deposite law,
for the puipose of withdrawing fiom the banks a
large amou it of surplus monev, ihich had accu-
mulated m their hands, and depositing it with the
States, where it would.be more safe,as well as moie
advantageous to the pubhc interest, and I choose
not to regard it in any o he light, whatever others
may thoose to call it—either a gilt, distribution, oi
loan, bv which the States have a light fo claim it,
oi li be quoted hereafter as a precedent, which
wou'd be of dangeio is tendency I pieler, theie
fort th" bill in its crismal shape, leav ing the ques-
tion of time t > t e future action of Congiess when
tliPi" s'i ill be a snip!us on hand to deposite But
it the amendment pre/ai's, I shall vote for the bill as
Tinencl d, not rrgTdins it, howcici, is pledging
tic1 i n of tli G > mn it that th n ne si all,
uiidei all and any circumstances wlvch may exist,
be pa d to the States at that time Having
detained the committee longer than I intended, I
will only add my hope, that we may come to a
speedy action upon this subject, and that the bill
will recive the anprobation of a majority of this
commitfe

The bill to postpone Ihe fourth instalment of the

and Mr Bn l hav tng concluded his speech upon
it-
Mr PICKi^S of Smth. Caiohna, said he had
not ísen to n ?ke a speech, he was rot  prepared
foi tha', but that he meiely rose to touch upon the
geneial giounds that would gotein h m in  the
comse he would pursue m re'ation to the bill under
consideiatton     He would rere take the lmerty of
saying that we had a commentator upon the repoit
of the Secietaiy of the Tieisury m the chairman
from the Commit ce of  "Way^ and Mea s, and
now we had anotl ti   e\pl tmtion of it b> th" gen-
tleman  fiom Marylanl (Mr  McKim ) and, no-
withsla ding a11   this, it was still as bungling and
comuseil a documen1  as he had ever been called
upon to analyse   One of thes" gentlemen had made
he sum  that we uld  be in the Treasury on the 1st
October, something under $3,000,000, and the othei
