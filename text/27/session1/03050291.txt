had no expectation that any thing he could say would arrest
the non hand of tyranny which a majority of that Hou^e had
laid on them but his appeal was to the people, and the appeal
would not be m vain If the Itbci tie1' of this country were ever
to be piostrated, it would be by a majority mthat House stifling

stowed many euiogiums If the constitutional question was

He endorsed eveiy constitutional argument in the speech, and
fully concutred in them c.s hi^ own
He declined enteungon the question of the effect ofa bank
on curiency ard exchanges, and also on the political influence
of such an institution He opposed the bill chiefly because it
re established the connection of the Government with banks—
a connection which he considered fruitful in the most irij urioua
conseqjencea He denied the bill to be an Administration
measure—themea&uie truly so tailed was the project of a fis
