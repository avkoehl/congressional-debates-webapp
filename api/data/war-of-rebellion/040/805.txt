Major-General.

LEWISBURG,

May 15, 1863-6 p. m.

Major C. S. STRINGFELLOW:

MAJOR: Since writing to General Jones this afternoon, Captain [Edgar C.] Phelps, of Dunn's battalion, has come through direct from Summerville. He reports that the enemy evacuated Summerville before Generals Jones and Imboden reached there. The enemy, he reports, went down the Kanawha. The troops of Jones and Imboden are now on their march to this place. Captain Phelps says that they will be here on Sunday [17th]. They captured some four or five days' rations of bread. I will countermand the order as to movement of the Forty-fifth [Virginia] Regiment, and only let a portion of it come to Alderson's Ferry. I will write particulars to-morrow.

Brigadier General JOHN ECHOLS,

Commanding, Lewisburg:

GENERAL: Your letter of the 14th and telegram of the 15th instant have been received. As W. E. Jones and Imboden have passed Summerville, of course the movement I directed you to make in my letter of the 14th is unnecessary, and you will not make it; nor will Jones and Imboden make the move to the Kanawha that I directed, the Secretary
