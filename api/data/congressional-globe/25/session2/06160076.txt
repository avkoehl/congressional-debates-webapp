country, in relation to the c induct of the Govern-
ment towards the Indians, atid other loreign na-
tions.   Upon tnat subject, theie was a wide differ-
ence of opinion between himself and the honora-
ble members who had preceded him on that occa-
sion.    He hoped never to live to witness the dis-
grace of his country, and should always be found
contributing his humble mite to lescne it from so
foul a calamity, and if perchance such a thing
should ever happen, he should  be exceedingly íe-
luctant to publish it, and hold it up m all it's in-
famy to the gaze and sneers of the world      Much
more reluctant would he ever be to pronounce that
disgrace, until it had been most clearly and indubi-
tably established upon his country, and to be con-
stantly doing so on this floor, on every occasion,
he feared might subject him, but too justly, to the
suspicion of sensible men, that he desued to effect
the very object, if not bent upon it, that he proles-
sed to proclaim to the world with reprobation    A
thing  whicti   he   hoped  no  man on that floor
or off of it, was so debased and degraded as to
do,   that   had   one   drop  of American  blood
m his veins.     Nor  would  he   ever   by   party
spirit,    or   vindictive   recklessness.,    suffer    a
suspicion so  foul to rest upon his conduct and
motives there.    No, sir, (said Mr   B ) no party
malice, nor disappointment of political promotion,
shall ever make me so far forget w hat is due to my
country as an American and a citizen, ovei whom
she has extended  her broad banner of protection
He had said that he differed widely in relation to
the disgrace of the county     It had long been his
settled and deliberate opinion, that if the counlry
had been at all disgraced, it had been done there,
and by gentlemen who held seats on that flcoi
Did  not  the   very   course  that had been pur-
sued by honorable gentlemen on that ¡floor, lead
to the accomplishment of  the very   thing they
professed  to  deprecate'   Were not the   tirades
and bitter denunciations of the Government in
the most indecent and ruthless style, which were
daily witnessed there, calculated to bring about the
very disgrace which gentlemen seemed so much to
dread?   To him nothing appeared more apparent
But again, as to its effects    Could a more Miicuhl
course be pursued, oi one moie destructive to the
best interests of the country?    Was no such indis
criminate and  unqualified   censme  as   wis   wit
nessedupon almost every subject heie, particulitlv
calculated to affect our favorable negotntions with
foreign  puweis,   when  they  heaid and tw tint
every step that the Government «as about to tain,
and demand that it made, was denounced bj a
large party m its own country'   What had the
administration of the Government done in the hst
six or eight jears that had not been denounced by
that party in advance?   Is such a coime here not
well calculated to increase the demands of other
nations on our own, and make them moie reluctant
to yield to those that our peopte may have against
them1   The affirmation  of  these   interrogatories
were too palpable to require demonstration, and
none  would deny  them,  whose  eyes   were   not
seared by the vindimveness < f party influence
We were now engaged in a bloody war with a
tribe of savages Was not the course pursued heie
in relation to that-war well calculated toprotrut it'
Were not the eulogies pronounced on their war-
riors here, and sympathies expressed well calcu-
lated to exalt them in their own estimation, and
make them more repugnant to peace, while they
were winning such "golden opinions" even from
anenemj' Are they not daily justified here for
murdering our people, pillaging our towns and
laying waste the finest portions of the frontie-s of
Florida' Sir, when quelled and subdued, ot n an>
thing be better calculated to instigate them to a re-
commencement and renewal of these blood} scenes,
or more eminently calculated to render them dis-
contented' He would entreat gentlemen to piu^e
and reflect a little more upon the co isequences
of their mad, lnih^cieet, and de'tnic ive couise
here He hoped there were none so bise as to be
willing to inflict so deadly a wound on their country,
to affect a party that differed with tbem often
merely in opinion It was such a course, in Ins
humble judgment, that was well calculated to bring
down that disgrace on the country which gentlemen
seemed so solicitous m promulgating to the world,
had already been effected.
Much had been said about the failure of the
Florida campaigns, which no doubt had been
owing to a combination of causes, which had been
triumphantly replied to by the honorable delegate
from Florida in a most eloquent inannei He had
shown the few short months which it was ne-
cessary for our armies to operate in, and
that we, in that short time, had not only to
whip th« Indians, but that we had to run them
down, and hunt them up, amid the most impene-
trable forests, everglades, rnorasse , and savan-
nas, through which it was almost impossible for
any living animal to pass It was entirely unlike
meeting an enemv in an open field, and deciding
the contest by a single battle, and that such an
enemy could be overcome only bj our perseverance
and endunng much At the commencement of
that war, there was not a general or soldier that
knew any thing of the true geographyof that coun-
try, which had no doubt greatly retarded its pro-
giess, and presented oneof thcgiealestimpediments
to our arm), and amid all these embanassing cir-
cumstances, the gentleman from Pennsylvania
could see no excuse for the protraction of this wai,
nor would he \ ote a dollar to carry it on, until he
could see the e\ idence of its necessity That ho-
norable gentleman's seeing, had put him in mind
of the old adage of the horse's drinking "A boy
might lead a horse to water, but it would take a
hundred men to make him drink."
Now, both the Secretary of War and the chair-
man of the Committee of Ways and Means, had
presented the evidence to the honorable gentleman,
of the necessity of that appropriation, but he (Mr
B ) poubted exceedingly, whether the two hundred
and foity-two members of that House could make
htm see it Sir, he said, there is another adage
equally applicable to the honorable gentleman's case,
and which he knew the honorable gentleman anti-
cipated "None was so blind, as he that toouldnot
see." Here he would leave the gentleman to stand
alone, in the glory of his ow n vote, against the
appropriation to defend his country from the bar-
barity of a most fierce and savage foe
An allusion hid been made to (he mannei m
which this country hid treated the Indians as a
conquered lace The policy of this Admmistia-
tion had been identically that which had been pur-
sued by former Administrations, and whic h had
been wilh the appiobition of an overwhelming ma-
jority of the American people lie denied the
charge of this Government ever having acted with
cruelty or injustice towaids the Indians as a con-
quered people The earliest histones of the woild
furnish abundant instances of one nation conquer-
ing another It was the triumph oí civilization over
savage barbansin, and he would there challenge gen-
tlemen, yes even the honorable gentleman from
Vermont(Mi Eví,r¡EiT,)with all Ins characteristic
sj mpathies (or the lawny race, to point to a sin-
gle instance wheie a < onquered nmon had been
treated with moie justice and humanity, than the
Indians in IN irth America had been,and particular-
ly by this Government
He stood thrreevei icady to defend with his fee-
ble abilities, not only his country and its democratic
institutions, bul pirticularlv the hum me and
p ililic couise which it had pursued throughout with
the different Indian tribes oí this country
The patience and lenity u lth w hirh they had ever
beeB treated by this Government, stood without a
paiallel m the littery ol the conquest of nations, and
it was with sore regret that he witnessed there, so
often, his oountrt and his Government airaigncd
foi its cruelly, injustice, and perfidy, towards not
only the sai ages, but m relat on to its conduct wuh
almost every otner nation with which it had had
any kind oí transaction
Sir, Mud he, mis presents to mj mind an awful
and omm >us foreboding , one upon which the heait
of the patriot sickened to reflect He held in his
hand a paper which he would exhibit (or the infor-
mation of that House and the cruniiy at Urge, and
which contained m it a volume of comment It
went to show the proneness of a certain party who
called themselves Whigs—(true, there were some
honorable exceptions)—to be found always in op-
position to their country in times of war and peril,
and an instinctive.opposition to every Democratic
popular admmiátration of this Government.
1st He would begin with the second war in
1812, with Great Britain. Never was an adminis-
tration more violently denounced than was the
truly Democratic administration of Mr. Madison.
Every measure, nearly, then, as now, that had any
relation to the prosecmion of that war, was de-
nounce d in most unmeasured terms, and every offi-
cer, from the President down, was denounced,
either for his ignorance or corruption. These ene-
mies of the Democracy then, as now, failed to
convince the people that their Government was
either so ignorant or corrupt.
2d When, but a fow years since, our foreign
relations were interrupted with France, and a war
was threatened us with that powerful nation, where
did you, sir, find the energies of that same party,
who had just assumed the name of Whig, directed'
Who that were here then, that are here now, have
forgotten the bitter denunciations thundered forth
m this hall against our then President and his De-
mocratic Administration, which they placed in the
wrong in every particular' Sir, the*? bitter sounds
of condemnation have scarcely yet ceased to re-echo
in the crevices of your Capitol, and, sir, from what
party came they? Not from that old Democratic
Republican party, that has stood by and sustained
this country m every emergency. At that very
time, when an honorable Senator of that party was
on his feet, pouring his vials of wrath on the head
of General Jackson for his weak and insulting con-
duct to Louis Philippe, and laboring to place every
act of that illustrious man in the wrong, a messen-
ger arrived in the Senate chamber to announce the
news that Louis Philippe was satisfied with the
conduct of the American President, and that the
claims of our people on that Government would be
promptly met and paid
3d The next war which threatened this nation,
has been with Mexico Where, again, have you
found the energies of that party directed? tn favor
of their country? No, sir no Already has our
Government been denounced in advance, both on
this flooi and in another part of this capítol, for its
conduct towards Mexico, and in the presence of
their Ministers and people here. And from what
party does this denunciation come? Not, thank
God, fiom the Democratic party; but it is levelled
against ¡hem by the same party that has ever op-
posed and taken sides with every country to abuse
them, and to depreciate our free, popular institu-
tions in the eyes of the woild
4th Our wars with the Indians. What party
(from what motive he would not say) had espoused
the cause of the savage against civilized man?
Who had ever heard more bitter denunciations,
and unmeasured censure, let loose upon any party,
or 3 ny Administration, than had been for nearly
two entire days reverberating in that hall against
the Democratic party and its Republican Adminis-
tration? Who had ever witnessed greater efforts
there to degrade, by comparison, the prowess of
our own arms with that of a babe, perfidious, ba-
vage foe' Yes, sir, and in the presence of the
chiefs of their kindred tribes, peems of applause
had been sung to the valiant Seminóles, while the
deeds of our brave soldiers had been passed un-
heeded and forgotten
5th But a few days since, we received the
most unwelcome news from our northwestern
frontieis, and a prospect of war had theie been en-
kindled with om o'd veteran and renowned enemy,
Great Britain, and how had that news been ie-
teived in that House' Had any man prtsent for-
gotten' Was not ( ur own Government immedi-
ately denounced' Was not an attempt immediately
made on that flooi to ph>ce her m the wron ?
The sounds of the condemnation of this Govein-
merit had hardly ceased to thrill through his ears.
The most powerful eloquence was exhibited on the
occasion, to which hejiad listened with the liveliest
lnteitst, and he regretted, painfully regretted, that
it was not m defence of his Government, m which
it was sometimes represented as endeavoring,
through weakness and folly, to plunge this country
into an unnecessary war with Great Britain, and
