There are four forts or earth-works, mounting ten 24-pounder guns, around this post, and I have no artillerists to man the guns or who understand the care of them and the works; and I have the honor

to represent that at least one company of heavy artillery are necessary at this post for that duty, while two would be few enough to man them in case of an attack. This post is so situated that it is the most important point on the river, north of Helena and south of Saint Louis, it being the only point from which either troops or supplies can be sent into Southeastern Missouri or Northern and Central Arkansas, on account of impassable swamps and rivers, which lie between the river and the region mentioned, extending all along down to the mouth of White River.

I am, general, very respectfully,

J. B. ROGERS,

Colonel, Commanding.

Brigadier General THOMAS EWING, JR.,Commanding Saint Louis District, Saint Louis, Mo.:

GENERAL: Since writing you a letter of this date, concerning repairing the forts at this post, Colonel Cole, chief of artillery, Department of the Missouri, has visited the posts and outworks with me, and I explained to him what I thought was necessary to place them in a condition for defense. We made a minute examination; he has my views, and expressed himself as concurring in them. I would suggest that by conferring with him you may more fully understand the case than from my letter.

I am, general, very respectfully,

J. B. ROGERS,

Colonel, Commanding.

CAPE GIRARDEAU, May 30, 1864

Brigadier-General EWING,

Commanding:

The following just received:

Colonel ROGERS;

I have gotten good information that there are 600 men under McRae, moving to attack Patterson or Bloomfield. They are now north of Pitman's Ferry.

J. F. TYLER,

Colonel.

They shall be welcome at Bloomfield if they come. We have sufficient force there to whip any 600, although I don't credit the report, for they will not attempt, either place with so small a force. This will delay my survey of the railroad from Bird's Point to Sikeston until it is over. I have sent out scouts and will keep you advised.

J. B. ROGERS,

Colonel.
