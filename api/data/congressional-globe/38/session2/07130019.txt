Report of the Postmaster General.
Senate & Ho. of Reps.
between the Atlantic and Pacific coasts, will fur-
nish such facilities as will make their adoption a
practical necessity for the commercial intercourse
between Europe and the populous countries of
eastern Asia. These considerations, and others
which will readily suggest themselves, render it
importantthat thePacific routes properly belong-
ing to us should be occupied by American mail
steamers, the profits of which, with the addition
of a small subsidy for the mail service, would
justify the establishment of one or more steam-
ship lines, which would be remunerative to the
proprietors.
Experience has demonstrated the impolicy of
appropriating large sums of money out of the
public Treasury to gratify a spirit of national
emulation in the support of expensive mail ser-
vice upon routes the profits of which are shared
by the steamships of other nations, and without
regard to the compensatory benefits to be derived
fiom the development of our national resources;
instead of granting incidental aid to such pro-
jected steamship lines to neighboring countries
as promise to be self-supporting after their estab-
lishment, and open up to our citizens new ave-
nues of profitable trade and commerce.
The principle adopted in the law authorizing
mail steamship service to Brazil, of inviting com-
petition for the service, is in such harmony with
the spirit of our commercial policy, and promises
so beneficent, results as to commend itself to my
approval as one that should be invariably ad-
hered to. But if there be a departure from this
policy it may be well to consider the expediency
of adopting the plan of using a portion of the
large number of Government vessels that will be
unemployed upon the restoration of peace, in the
forming of mail lines with the principal commer-
cial marls of the world in such manner as will
promote the interests of commerce in the trans-
portation of persons and property.
APPOINTMENTS.
Including (he suspended post offices, the whole
number on the 30th June, 1864, was 28,878; of
which 19,976 are m the loyal, and 8,909 in the
disloyal States. The number of presidential of-
fices is 705, and 28,173 are under the appointment
of the Postmaster General. The number of of-
fices in each State and Territory at the close of
the fiscal year is shown m the appendix, (table
No. 11.)
During the year, 619 post offices have been
established, 788 discontinued, and 211 changes
made of names and sites. The number of cases
acted upon was 5,579. Four thousand seven hun-
dred and thirteen postmasters have been appoint-
ed, of whom 3,028 were to fill vacancies occa-
sioned by resignations; 674 by removals; 259 by
deaths; J33 by change of names and sites, and
619 on establishment of new offices. The details
appear in the appendix, (table No. 12.)
Under the provisions of the act approved July
1, 1864, " to establish salaries for postmasters,
and for other purposes," the salary of the post-
master of New York, and of the postmasters at
offices of the first, second, and third classes, have
been fixed as provided by law. (See appendix,
table No. 13.)
The fifth section of the act above referred to
authorizes the Postmaster General to allow at the
office of New York, and at the offices of the first
and second classes, a reasonable sum for the ne-
cessary cost of rent, fuel, lights, and clerks. No
authority is given to allow for other necessary
items, such as repairs of furniture, cleaning, sta-
tionery, printing, and other incidentals, required
ill large offices, and 1 beg leave to suggest that
the necessary authority be given to appropriate a
reasonable amount out of the revenues of the re-
spective offices to meet such contingencies.
At the close of ihe fiscal year there were 20 spe-
cial agents, whose salaries amounted to $34,1U0;
414 route agents, receiving §313,912; 53 local
agents, $32,009; and 105 baggage masters in charge
of through and express mails, $6,780.
The free delivery of mail matter by carriers has
been introduced at 66 offices, employing, at pre-
sent, 685 carriers, at an aggregate annual compen-
sation of $317,061 22.
Tables are herewith annexed, showing the op-
erations of the system. (See appendix, Nos. 14
and 15.)
DEAD LETTERS.
The m^jnber of dead letters of every descrip-
tion received and examined during the year was
3,508,825, being an increase of 958,409 over the
preceding year, attributable mainly to the return
of large numbers of Army and Navy letters which
it was found impracticable to deliver.
During the year there were registered and re-
mailed to the respective owners, as containing
money, 25,752 letters, containing an aggregate of
$131,611 24, of which number 20,059, containing
§104,665 84, were delivered; 4,412 letters, con-
taining $20,485 49, were returned to the Depart-
ment, being addressed chiefly to soldiers and sail-
ors, and persons transiently at places of mailing
or address.
The number of dead letters containing papers
of value, other than money, as deeds, bills of ex-
change, drafts, checks, &c., received, registered,
and returned for delivery to the owners, was
12,436, and the nominal value of the inclosures
therein was $1,615,694 75, being an increase over
the previous year of 4,104, or about fifty percent.,
while the increase in the value of the inclosures
was but §71,416 94. The number of these letters
delivered was 11,378, or ninety per cent.
During the year 45,380 letters and packages
were received containing photographs, daguerre-
otypes, and articles of jewelry. Of this num-
ber, 29,999 were sent out for delivery, 26,607 of
which contained photographs and daguerreo-
types, 1,410 articles of jewelry, and 1,982 other
miscellaneous articles. Of the whole number
sent out, 18,213 were delivered to either the send-
ers or parties addressed, the postage on which
amounted to §1,944 24.
In May last a large number of packages con-
taining miscellaneous articles which had been
accumulating for several years, were classified
and sold at public auction, the proceeds amount-
ing to $1,175 27.
The number of valuable dead letters registered
and sentout for delivery was 68,187, being 23,574
more than the preceding year, and there were re-
turned to the Adjutant General's, duartermaster
General's, and other public offices, 11,116 letters
and packages containing muster rolls, descriptive
lists,and soldiers'discharge papers; 66,691 letters
containg postage stamps and money m less sums
than one dollar, or articles of less than one dollar
in value, were returned to the seudeis.
The number of letters which it was found im-
possible to forward from the offices where depos-
ited, or to deliver to the parties addressed,because
of the postage being unpaid, or on account of being
illegibly directed,and which were in consequence
sent to the dead letter office, was 115,812. Of this
number, 72,074 were " held for postage," being
addressed to foreign countries, to which the pre-
payment of postage is compulsory, or to those
countries with which the United States have no
postal arrangement; 38,068 of the number were
" misdirected," or so imperfectly or illegibly ad-
dressed that their destination could not be ascer-
tained. A large number of this last class were
without any address whatever, and in many in-
stances contained inclosures of value.
During the year there were received at tile De-
partment 5,112 applications for missing letters,
for all of which examinations were made and the
applicants notified of the result.
A large number of letters addressed to rebel
localities have been returned from various sources
to the dead letter office, amounting in the aggre-
gate to 31,423, of which number 28,421 were of do-
mestic, and 3,002 of foreign origin. They were
all indorsed "mails suspended," and returned, ;
the domestic to the writers,and the foreign to the
countries in which they originated.
Within the past year, 4,256 letters addressed
to fictitious persons or firms were sent by post-
masters to the dead letter office, and thence re-
turned to writers or senders. The addresses were
assumed, evidently, for the purpose of conducting
some fraudulent business, and ill many instances
these lelters were found to contain remittances.
Under the provisions of the act approved Jan-
uary 21, 1862, 1,068,499 ordinary dead letters, or
those not evidently worthless, were returned to the
writers, after havingbeen placed in new en velopes.
Out of this number, 4,044 were returned to i
banks and insurance companies, 90,856 to busi-
ness firms, and 917,599 to individuals. Included
in tlie above aggregate are 9,761 letters returned
free of postage; these consisted of official letters
from the various Departments, and letters sent to
the various hospitals for sick and wounded; sol-
diers. Forty-one thousand and sixteen dead
letters written in foreign languages were also
returned during the year.
About 24| per cent, of the whole number sent
out for delivery to the writers failed to be de-
livered, and were again returned to the Depart-
ment.
The gross revenue derived from the dead letter
postage collected on the letters sent out and de-
livered amounted to §23,558 28, out of which were
paid the clerks employed in directing them. The
collection of postage on such returned letters com-
plicates the accounts under the law fixing salaries
for postmasters. These letters must be entered
at the mailing, and then at the receiving office, and
postage collected; and such as cannot be delivered
must be credited to the postmaster when sent to
the dead letter office. The aim of the Department
is to have no unpaid letters in the mails, and to
collect all revenues by means of postage stamps,
avoiding the necessity of keeping accounts. In
future postmasters are to enter in their accounts
only unpaid letters, which are mostly from or to
foreign countries, and it seems inconsistent to
send thousands daily from this Department with
instructions to enter them und collect postage.
The amount is comparatively small, and yet the
attendant labor very considerable. I therefore
suggest, as a matterfor the consideration of Con-
gress, the propriety of restoring prepaid letters to
the owners free of postage, especially in view of
the fact that a very large proportion go to persons
of modei ate means.
The number of domestic letters of all descrip-
tions sent out from the dead letter office during
the year was 1,403,998. In addition to these, Ia«ge
numbers of letters, bearing requests for their re-
turn to the writers if unclaimed a specified time,
are returned by postmasters without passing
through the dead letteroffice,andconstanteiforts
are made to promote this mode of return.
The number of letters returned unopened to
foreign countries during the year was 162,591,
the amount of unpaid postage on which was
$9,161 53. The number received from foreign
countries in the same condition during the same
period was 62,427, and the amount of unpaid
postage thereon $2,088 57. (For particulars see
table No. 16 of appendix.)
During the fiist year of the rebellion the num-
ber of letters which passed between the United
States and European countries decreased, while
at the same time the ratio of letters returned in-
creased. Each subsequent year the correspond-
ence has been increasing, while the ratio of dead
letters returned to Europe has decreased. (See
table No. 17 of appendix.)
By authority of an act of Congress, the un-
claimed money from dead letters is used to pro-
mote the efficiency of the dead letter office, by
providing temporary clerks to assist in the ex-
amination and return of letters. The fund thus
realized was $5,083 47, to which was added the
proceeds of the sale hereinbefore referred to—
$1,175 27—making a total of $6,258 74. Deduct-
ing the amount expended for clerks, $2,966 82,
and incidental expenses, $32 80, a balance re-
mained June 30, 1864, of $3,259 12.
POSTAL MONEY-ORDER SYSTEM.
The act approved May 17,1864, authorized the
Postmaster General to establish, "under such
rules and regulations as he may find expedient
arid necessary, a uniform money-order system at
all post offices which he may deem suitable there-
for;" and it fuitlier provided that tins system
should be put into operation during the fiacal year
ending June 30, 18l>5.
A superintendent and assistant have been ap-
pointed, one hundred and forty-one post offices
have been designated as money-order offices, and
the operation of the system commenced oil the
1st instant.
