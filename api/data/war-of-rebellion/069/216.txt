direction of the corps officer of the day, to whom division officers of the day will report, those of the First and Second Divisions crossing the foot bridge below the railroad, and those of the other divisions by the bridge over the Telegraph road.

General Barlow will cover the withdrawal of the lower pontoon bridge and General Birney that of the upper one. As soon as these bridges are withdrawn, they will join the train on the Chesterfield road, which will proceed to Chesterfield under the direction of Lieutenant-Colonel Batchelder and follow in rear of the Sixth Corps from that point. General Barlow will take effective measures for the destruction of the lower foot bridge when the pickets have crossed, and General Birney the same for the bridge on the Telegraph road. Each division commander will be responsible for the preservation of his own bridge until his command has passed the river. General Birney will relieve General Potter's line as General Potter vacates it, in order to cover the Telegraph road until his own division is withdrawn, and General Potter will report to General Burnside. His pickets will remain until relieved by order of the corps officer of the day.

CIRCULAR.] HEADQUARTERS SECOND CORPS,

The following change in the order for recrossing the river is rendered necessary by the rise in the river: Two brigades of the First Division are to follow the Second across the lower pontoon bridge, two brigades of the First Division to precede the Third Division across the upper bridge, these brigades to join and mass with those crossing the lower bridge. The pickets of the First and Second Divisions will cross on the lower pontoon bridge. Only the upper pontoon bridge will be taken up before the picket are withdrawn.

By order of Major-General Hancock:

C. H. MORGAN,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Chief of Staff.

CIRCULAR.] HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,

May 26, 1864-8.30 p.m.

Division commanders will notify these headquarters frequently and with great dispatch of their progress in crossing their divisions, and will report when the last of their commands have crossed. The first point is to cross the river and get the troops on the high ground, massed, and to be particular to protect the bridges until they are taken up. The artillery of divisions might proceed at once to certain points designated by division commanders, and if there is any difficulty in crossing, had better mass at points behind the left of their old positions, as it is not probable that we shall move away from these positions before daylight. Fires should be lighted and kept up on both ends, and at the approaches of all the bridges.

By command of Major-General Hancock:

WM. R. DRIVER,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
