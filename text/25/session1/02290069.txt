administration is m no way, direcdy 01 indirectly,
censurable for the suspension of specie paympiits
They have had no agency m it whatever Their
money was left m the banks on deposite, just as
individuals deposite theirs, and in the same banks
where opposition men were making deposites daily
throughout the yeai The money was believed to
be safe, and will be ultimately paid, every dollar of
it. Fifteen millions have already been paid since
the suspension The Government will lose nothing,
but if it should, what right has any one in the op-
position to comp'ain of the imprudence of the Se-
cretary, w hen the opposition banker? and merchants
kept then money iri the same institutions'' All that
has been done ji removing these deposites from
place 10 place, has been done, as I before said, m
obedience to a law which was voted (oi bv the op-
position almost to a man The admunstiation has,
therefore, no connection with the surpension, and
those who would throw this responsibility upon it
are doing it a gross and manifest injustice
The distress, of which we hear so much, is greatly
exaggerated It exists, only among pirticular
clashes of the community It has not reached the
great mass of the people at all. Among all the
strange things published duung the summer, I was
amused with some of the accounts of distiess God
forbid that I should ever smile at the actual distress
of any human being. I remember, among other
evidences of pressure, it was staled m an eastern
paper that two hundred immigrantb, vv ho came to
this countiy from England, were obliged to return,
because they could not find employment in the
United States' Now, at that very moment, in the
district which I have the honor to represent, as
well as in other parts of the western country, we
were paying laborers a dollar and a dollai and a
quarter a day in cash, to aid ns in la king care of
our gram and hay, a nd the a ops tuei e suffering for
want of hands to secure them1 If any sach persons
did return to Europe, they must have done so m
consequence of the information they received from
some panic-maker whom they met upon the wharf
where they landed Why did they not go into the
interior, and they would have found a welcome
reception from the laborious and thriving population,
who live, by the proceeds of their own honest ffidu -
try, without relying upon either banks or specula-
tions for assistance.
Who buffers bv the failure of the banks to pay
specie1 Not the b-mks The) are co'leclmg tneir
debts,gettingm then paper, andstienjripenmg them-
selves without paying out any money They would
be very willing to mike the suspension perpetual,
it the people wou'd circulate their promises, and
recognise them as money Eankirg would then
be a profitable business, it could be carried on
without any "apital at all'
The merchants are not injured by it, at least not
seriously. As a body, they owe the banks laige
sums, and in selling goods and collecting their
debts, the paper answers their puiposes as vv ell as
specie, because it pays their debts to the binks, oi
to each other and then to the bank Besides, the
merchants and the bankers are the same peisons, to
a very grea* extent Almost all the banks are in
the hands of meichants, -who are officers, directors,
and stockholder
The manufacturer-- are embatrassed in some
places, it is true They have been forced to dis-
charge a poition of then ' operatives " But these
people, who aienow out of employment, are but
suffering a cilaimtj which is incident to the busi-
ness in "which thej have been engaged It must
always be so in mamifaciunng disliicts How of-
ten do these things occur m Fngiand* They aie
still more liable to happen where vv e attempt to
to give manufactories an artificial impulse by law,
and push them m advance of the vants oí the
country, and the mteiests oi th* agricultural and
commeicial clashes Let these people come to tne
West, and, in the feitile valle} of tne Mississippi,
■we will furnish them all with emp'ovment, and
pay them higher vvage^ thu th y lectived under
their late engagements
Yet, although a lar, .nij u'v <l the ^qilc
have not suffered any greit losses fi om the si ¡  n-
sioa of specie p^v nun s, it i¿ "iy cen^n tint tne
Genei?1 Government  has been   impeled 111   its
operations by this event It is without money to
defiay itscuircnt expenditure  and to discharge its
debts One can not but admire the liberality
■w hich has been shown by the opposition towards
the administration in this critical postule of its
affairs Tne Government is daily abused for not
pa}ing its deb's m specie, and is denounced as a
bankrupt'
What are the fact>? There are some twelve
millions of public money in the State banks, depo-
sited for safe keeping, which those banks are bound
by contract to pay over to the Government on de-
mand In addition to this, iheie are due from the
importing merchants about four oi five millions for
dulies on imported poods, which ought to havs been
paid into the T easur} by the 1st day of Octobei
The banks, m the fir<t place, shut their doo^s, and
refused to pay a dollar in specie when demanded for
the use of the Government, and to enable it to pay
its debts In the second place, the merchants peti-
tion foi a longer time to pay what they owe, al-
leging that they cannot procure money ev en to pay
their postage, much less the debis they owe Gov-
ernment, though it seems they, some how or o'her,
pick up agood deal for exportation' In this state of
things, the resources of the Government thus cm
off, the professed friends of the banks and the mer-
chants turn round and abuse the same Government
because it does not pay its debts, and pay them m
specie ' What would be thought of such a transac-
tion between two individuals1 One deposites ten
thousand dollars with another for safe keeping In
a short time, he calls for a thousand dolíais, to pay
off the hst and only debt he owes in ihe world
The deposdoiy lock  his drawer, and refuses to let
him have a cent, and, to add insult to injur}, he
snecrmgly calls him a bankrupt, and insists upon
his paying up his debts' A scoundrel who would
conduct himself in this manner would be driven
from society by the common sentiment of all ho-
nest men.
These arc the cucumstances undei which we
have been called together, and the question is, what
ate we lo do'1 Have we the constitutional power to
do any thing for the country' If so, what is it'
and shall we do ii?
Here I can not but advert to the extraordinary
course pursued by the lead ng opposition newspa-
pers of th  countrv After " making the welkin
ring" with then cries of public distiess for some
months past, "fter demanding, in the most peremp-
tory manner, that the Executive should convene
Congress, to give relief to a suffering country, now,
when we are convened, they advise their political
ft lends in the two Houses to propose nothing,
to offer nothing, to suggest no plan for re-
lief, but to leave the matter entirely with the
adm nistration and its friends' Their language is,
" let the fourlh-rate men, who have involved us in
these fioubles devise the mode of extricating us"'
The country, ¡recording to them, is in deep and un-
paral'elled distiess, it is gioanmg under affl'ction,
and upon the veige of despiir, yet in this condi
non, they refuse to lift a fingei lo save it' This
comes too from the "Simon Pures " the "nn pii V
men' This proposition is made by loose, who
are always for then countiy, and never for party
These aie the men viho aie constantly whining
about corrupt presses, and corrupt politicians They
not only refuse to offer any plan for relief, but
have, so far, shown a dispos tion to oppose every
thing offered by the administration and its friends
This, sir, I suppose is modern pilrioüsm'
The «ame sentiments, in part, have been re-
peated m this House We have been distinctly
told that the opposit on had no plan to offei Gen-
'lemen seem to hay e taken then cue from íIt> oi-
gans of their party Thus fir, the principle has
been acted upon All ou1- measmes aie opposed
wi h violence, and nothing is pionospd as a sub-
stitute We sha' s e whether th s girne will be
played out to Ike end Tf so, it makes but h.tle
ditfeience what a!" rnei'sproie- ms The peo-
ple vvih lüdge then by tHir acts It ibey i m >-
iup lo >ct upo t is pri icin'e l! 10 i£,ln * wh t
they iViuni iw the pus m giei ra^ p<uil üs
crisis of tne country, they \ ill fi r iisb \pi
most in iub table evidence that 1heu g cat <b
ject is political  pover, legardlcs  of the means
by which it is to bs attained. They wilf piotfe to
all impartial observers that, with loud professions,
of disinterestedness upon their lips, ttrey are m
reality fighting for the "spods," and that all their
measures are so shaped and'directed as to ¡urn the
dominant party out of power, and elevate them-
selves to the vacancies thus created Sir, sucK a
party as this desertes no support from the honest
and intelligent people of the United States Men
who, when their country calls for relief, turn a
deaf ear to her complaints, and practically "moiA
at her c?lamity," are destitute of that patriotism
which should distinguish every true-hearted Amen-
can And if I were disposed to recrinvnale, to
indulge in the use of such epithets as are rjatly
thiown out against the democratic party, I would
pronounce such a party to be a mere corps of
political mercenaues and miserable demagogues,
seeking their own advancement, without reference
to the public vv ¿Hare, in a word, to be the most
unprincipled, corrupt, and rotten-hearted faction
that has ever appeared in this country But I
will not indulge m such language. It belongs to
the opposition vocabulaiy, and I leave it with
them
What do we propose as measures suited to the
present crisis' To understand the policy of the
friends of the administration, we must view the in-
dividual measures as composing a whole, as se-
parate parts of one scheme.
Fr«t We have a bill on our table, proposing
to allow time lo the deposite banks to pay up the
balance they owe the Government by instalments;
so as to relieve them frsnn the necessity of distres-
sing then debtors by rapid collections, involving
the sacrifice of individual property
Secondly We have a bill to allow longer time
to the importing merchants to pay the duties they
owe the Government, upon theirgivuignew bondsj
with satisfactory security, and paying mlHrest on
the amount they owe. This saves them from a
heavy pressure, enables them to give lime to the
merchants of ihe interior, who owe themg and al-
low the merchants of the interior to indulge the
people who have purchased their goods on credit
Thudly A bill to authorize the Secretary of the
Treasury to issue Treasury notes, to an amount
not exceeding ten millions, to aid the Government
in carrying on its operations until those who owe
us are able to pay These notes will be receivable
m pay ment f >r lands and all public dues, will cir-
culat" through the community as a substitute for
money, and will relieve the necessities of the coun-
try, by adding that much to the description of cir-
culating medium which is needed by the mer-
chants and banks to pav the Government what they
owe They complain that specie is not to be had,
these notes will answer the same purpose in their
dealings with the Government
Fourthly- As thp banks have cut loose from the
Government by their own act, we propose to leave
them in that condition, and hereafter to take care
of om money ourselves without their assistance:
and w e have a bill for that purpose, familiarly
called the Sub-Treasury bill
These are our prominent, leading measures.
We say they will afford relief ¡to both Government
and people, and that they afford all the relief which
our constitutional authority,or the exigencies of th¡e
crisis, requues at our hands We relieve thebfelflfs
and merchants directly, immediately, and iiukfaetty
we relieve other classes of the community. The
influence of this scheme will reach nearly every
man in the country, in one way or another. It
will espec ally beieut the plantéis and farmers, by
enabl ng the banks to furnish facilities to aid m
taking the fall ciops to market By aiding the
traders, we keep up the puces of the great staples,
where thev are aiscd and by giving time to the
bank', vie enib'n tutm to tuinish purchasersm the
i larutt v .'h me^ns to buy the production* of our
soil
S> fai as íegards the banks and die merchants,
T hrvo no'hing lo sav li their justificifion They
hive not done u ell, but at ihe same time it is to
!   i . p-nnneied thit their misfortunes have be"n
n * ne degiee brought upon them bv circumstan-
ce ove' which they had no contiol We must
deal gently with them, especially  when their mte-
