HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF WEST MISSISSIPPI,New Orleans, La., August 18, 1864.

Major General N. P. BANKS,

Commanding Department of the Gulf, New Orleans, La.:

GENERAL: I am instructed by the major-general commanding to inquire where the Sixth Michigan Heavy Artillery is stationed at present (it was ordered by Special Orders, Numbers 93, section 4, August 10, 1864, headquarters Military Division of West Mississippi, to embark at Morganza for this city, reporting on arrival to General Arnold), and to request that orders be at once given for it to be held in readiness to embark to-morrow morning for Mobile Bay. More detailed information about where the transforation will be in readiness will be given during the night, but it is desirable that the above notice be given to the commanding officer as early as possible, and that the station be reported to these headquarters. My impression is that the regiment is stationed at Carrollton.
