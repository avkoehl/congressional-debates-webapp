abstract showing the number, by companies, of the Virginia Volunteers who entered the service prior to 1st of July, 1861. The returns to this office only comprise such companies as entered service prior to July 1, 1861, up to which period they were paid by the State. I am therefore unable to say what number are now in the field. The reports subsequent to 1st of July were made, I presume, to the Adjutant-General of the Confederate States. He would therefore be able to give this information, as well as the points at which the troops are stationed. In some instances I found a difficulty in fixing the exact date of entry into service, owing to the neglect of the officers making the rolls not stating in the caption of such rolls when and for how long the company was mustered in. In such cases I took the commencement of pay as the date of entry, and twelve months thereafter as the termination of service. I have understood that some few of the companies embraced in my abstract have been discharged, but never having received official notice of the fact, I cannot, of course, report them so. Many of the companies were largely increased by recruiting after the 1st of July, and a good many men have been discharged-to what extend in either case I am unable to state.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

HENRY HILL,

Paymaster-General Virginia Forces.
