JNO. A. RAWLINS,

Brigadier-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,January 19, 1865 - 11 a. m.

Brigadier-General RAWLINS,

Chief of Staff:

General Seymour's order was delivered to him last night and all publicity given to the fact of its issue. I cannot but feel gratified at its proposed revocation at my request. If I had not been convinced there was no intention on General Seymour's part to do wrong, I would never have interposed. His letter was wrong, and will be misconstrued. He admits this, but disclaims any design to give such construction. he has already been severely punished, and the publicity given to his order will have a salutary effect on the army.

GEO. G. MEADE.
