Mr CIAY addresssd the toenatelm support of these resolu
tionsfoiabou two hours and a halif The following sketch wilt
give a general idea of the grounds taken bv Mr (lay lie
commenced by stating that the resolutions jus'read he const
dered of gieat importance, involving interests of the highest
charactei at d tbe system of policy proposed in them, lay at
the bottom of all elTortsto lestorethe ptospeuty of the coun
try He had not co ne to the teena'e to da, to cull the flowers
of oratory, for the purpose of regaling the eyed of fair ladies
Neither was it his wishto-revive animosities heretofore exist
ing between political parties His object was to speak on the
sad condition of the country, and to suggest some íemedies
If any persons had come under the expectation of hearing
from him, on this occasion, an ambitious display of oratory or
expecting him todeal many other tropesand figures than those
of arithmetic, they would be sadly disappointed
These resolutions were the stakes to which he, as a plough
man, aiming to make a straight fuirow, would direct his at
tention
It had been urged against them that t ey were general not
practical and that llmearnest tnemeasuieapropo edougbtto
have been biought at or ce under discussion in separate bi Is
But he aigued that the practice of the B iti^h Paihe nenl, Irom
which this country b ri owed its parhameniary linage was to
mark out thegeneiai punciples first or great leading measures
ofpuhcy, and then to eairythem out by special enactments
Another objection wa that no measute of leverue, t ef
fectmg pirposes ofrcvenue, can origínale any wheie but in the
Hou=e of Reptesentatwes He howevc-, maintains 1 that the
-Senatehad aright toco itiol, notorly the am .nut of expenul
tures an -1 appiopnai oils suggestel by theothir Tí use but 10
cany out such alter i ions ol existirg measuics and suci re
trenchments as the public set vice m s'tt ju tily
lie coiisiuerej that no moue was so i t fot dtscu ing thpsere
sol jtiona as that of tak pg them m detail,and in the oiuei in
winch they have been submitted
The first resolution is based upon the pnnciple that it is
the duty of Congress to provi le adpqnate revenue to mee its
expenditures It has been said this is not nng new, it is a mere
truism Certainly it is, but has it been carred out! During
Mr Van Burén s Administration, instead of reselling to re
venue, what was the expediei t to meet expenditures11 reasui y
notes, the eff ct of winch has been to cast upon a succeeding
Admimstravion, a debt incurred by his administration There
■was an excess of expenditures over income of between seven
and eight millions of dollars an mally, and it was the duty of
that administration, as soon as th a ext e s u c me apparent, to
supply a sufficiency of revenue to meet it 1 y in increase of tariff
1 he next three resolutions re ate to one subject, and he would
theiefore consider them together
The first, (the seco/td in the series,) assumes that an adequate
revenue cannot be obtained by duties on foieign imports, with
outaloptinga higher rate than twenty per cent as piovided m
thecompromiseact,anl ihen supposed suflicent foiaiecono
mical admmistiation of the Qo\ eminent
The second (third in the s nes) issunie  th it the late ought
to be augmented beyond twenty per cent so as to produce a nett
levenue of tvveu y six millions
The thir 1 (/ok  th in the «enes ) assumes that the pii iciples
of the Compromise act s onld be adheted to and a maximum
rateof pit valorem dutiesshou d be established
The first question suggested by these resolutions was what
ought tobe the exact expenditureoftheGovernmenii Hedid
not pretend to eive a piecise answer It depends on r ícum
Manees All tha can be done, is to mace an appioximation
to what ought to be the expenditure
It had been stated paitirularly b/ the Senator fiom Missoul i,
who sat ncal him, plr Ll\M ] and t le teenatoi from South
Carolina, who sat opposite, (.Mr Calhocis ] that the Wh g
party, when out of powei, asse-tcd they would when
they came into powei reduce the expendituies to tbir
teen millions He denied that any «uch ass  tion had
eier been made, and he chai enged the pioif that ouch
a plelge had been given by the Wh g partv Whit
they did «ay, was th t dun g Mi Adam 'a ?dmimstia
tionthe expendlttne o! Ilia government was tonteen mil ions,
and that the parly suci ee hn" him pledged themselves to lessen
the expenditure lis pad of wb c i they cained them up to an
unprecelented amount ! e admitted Mr McLean ha 1 s 13
Bested fifteen millions as a íeaaonaWe expenditure of the & i
? rnm nt but the Wh g paity never did pledge themselves to
come down to eithet thirteen or fifteen mulliría,but they did
-pledge themselves to economize anl letrench, and that pro
ee "was m  going onus wou b  l loved by the labois ol h"
committees now sitting in Congiess on the subject

for the extraordinaiy expeii h ires of Mr Van B ne n admi
mstration But he ma ntamed Ait eveiy Admmis ntioncould
make such pretexb-all A hni ns i attons ha 1 their extraon i
narv occurences'— and be denied that such coi i be any ex
cuse But he insisted that, making all leasonable allowance 
jt would be found Mr Van Eui en's administration expended an
annual sum far beyond that proposed by the present resolu
tions
Thirteen millions was the average expenditure of Mr Ad
aula's administration Adding half histeim to the time since
it expired—making fifteen years—or supposing at the end of
thirteen years—it has been found necessar> to ir crease it to
twenty two mil'ions, was there any thing exttaordinary in that?
The army has been doubled, eiCTht or ten ships of the line have
been added to tbe navy, new Slates have been added to the
Union—when these things, and the necessary progress of the
nation were taken mo> account, was it to be wondered at that
the expei duures should be raised to twenty two millions'! It
is notan increase in proportion to the annual increase of popu
latiou Th  increase of the population is four per cent tlat
of expenditure would not exceed that ratio
1 he addition is about S'OO 000 pel year No jojrg Govern
ment liko this cm be charged with rash and extravagant ex
pcnduuresif ita ratio of lneiease in expenditures dt es not ex
ceed this Posteiitv, in another centurv, when our population
will be a hui drcd mi lions, will have no íeason to com
plain
These resolutions were not to preclude further and future re
ductions when inves igations shall point out fresh _ourc s ol
reform
In allusion to the statement made by the Fe fttot fiom
South Carolina [Mr Cat hoi -j ] with regard to the difficulties
which he encountered when at the head of the War Depart
ment, in bringing about asystem of regularity, in w! ich it took
him foul years to reduce the expenses of fthe army per man to
what he did, he would ask, was it kind of the Sena oi to taunt
the Whig party with not having accempli-hed, in one year,
whatit  took him four veáis lo accompli hi
Mr Calhouk corrected theSenatoi He hadalwavs said it
was a work of time All he asked of the present Aeuiinis'ra
tion was to begin—to show an earnestnestneas in commencing
the work of reform
Mr Clat continued The gentleman will be gratifi d The
reform had already commenced and he • misrht deper 1
upon it woull be cained out He m untamed 11 detail
that the Whigs had more than fulfilled then pledge ,
an 1 that amidst dl couragn z circumstances of the most unex

ject only to tl e operations in fotm, tbe foreigner fixes ths

value at home It has been estimated at bom fifteen to twenty
pes cent butbeibojglititougbtto be from twenty to twenty-
five peí cei t which wo dd amount toan addition of five per

per cent on all ameles would be requsne to raise
