Colonel W. S. GRISHAM,

Walhalla, S. C.:

DEAR UNCLE: I send Johnny Holcourt up to ascertain something of the whereabouts of the Yankees and the necessity of moving to meet them. I received orders from Colonel Ashmore to enroll volunteers for the occasion, send out scouts, couriers, &amp;c. Please give Johnny any reliable information you can gather. I will send again after while and it may be to go farther.

I am, yours, affectionately,

JAS. J. NORTON.

General SAMUEL COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General:

As I may be required in Georgia or Florida at any moment, a competent officer of sufficient rank should be sent to command in South Carolina. Lieutenant General D. H. Hill would be acceptable. One officer should command in Florida. Cannot Major-General Cobb be ordered there? Please answer soon as practicable.

Major-General Gilmer is the next ranking officer, and should succeed to the command.
