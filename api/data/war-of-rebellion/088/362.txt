Colonel BRENT,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

Since fog cleared, as far as I can see to left of Cobb's and crossing pontoon and Broadway road, I notice a large number of stragglers passing, going toward Petersburg, which leads me to think that a division or corps must have passed during the night. Two companies of cavalry passed along the Broadway road toward Petersburg. The sharpshooters report the same.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
