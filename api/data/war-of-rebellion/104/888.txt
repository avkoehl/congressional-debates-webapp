HDQRS. SECOND BRIGADE, SECOND DIVISION CAVALRY,MILITARY DIVISION OF WEST MISSISSIPPI,

Baton Rouge, La., May 23, 1865.

Major General P. J. OSTERHAUS,

Chief of Staff:

(Through Brigadier-General West.)

I report the arrival of my command in Baton Rouge on the 22nd instant. The cavalry horses are in good condition as when I started. The wagon train and its animals are unfit for a campaign, as they were when they were turned over to my quartermaster. A few days will be needed to fit the pontoon train and bridge for the field. Some of the boats need caulking and pitching badly. They will of course be attended to. A more complete report will be forwarded as early as practicable.

I remain, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. BAILEY,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
