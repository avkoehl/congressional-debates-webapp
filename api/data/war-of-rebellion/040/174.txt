Captain E. P. FITCH, Gallipolis:

Your last just received. You are doing the best possible. Keep the little force watchful, and report. Warn boats along the river to leave the Virginia side. This should be done both by telegraph and messenger. I have informed General Burnside, &amp;c.

J. D. COX,

Brigadier-General.

(Received March 30-3 p. m.)

Major-General BURNSIDE:

The number of the enemy at Point Pleasant first sent you is best corroborated by late reports, but even that number is larger than all you troops between here and Portsmouth. I am trying to get volunteers at Gallipolis to go up and relieve Point Pleasant, where, at latest accounts, the company still held the court-house. Is there anything at Portsmouth which can be ordered up?

J. D. COX,

Brigadier-General.

MARIETTA, OHIO, March 30, 1863-2 p. m.

General E. P. SCAMMON, Charleston, via Clarksburg:

The best information puts the rebel force below you less than 500. I have ordered a boat down for Zeigler's regiment, and am trying to raise citizens enough, with the company at Gallipolis, to relieve Point Pleasant. Am also urging General Burnside for aid from the Department of the Ohio. You had better push as large a force as you can mount rapidly down the river, and sustain them by what can be spared without abandoning posts above. I am practically without command, but assume this much as a necessity. Be assured everything possible well be done below, and I am confident all will come right shorlty.

J. D. COX,

Brigadier-General.

MARIETTA, [OHIO,] March 30, 1863-2 p. m.

Lieutenant-Colonel CHESEBROUGH,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Baltimore:

Latest and most reliable reports are confirmatory of the first sent you as to enemy's numbers. The company at Point Pleasant was this morning, as 11, still in the court-house, and hoped to hold it till night. I have directed the company at Gallipolis to raise volunteers of the citizens there, and endeavor to relieve the garrison. Have also ordered a boat to ho down from Gallipolis for a regiment (Fifth Virginia), lately at Ceredo, and bring it unless it has its hands full there. Have also telegraphed General Burnside to send some aid from below, if possible, and have warned Kelley and all in Northwestern Virginia. Am still confident Scammon will be able to hold his position in the upper valley, and detach force enough to reopen his communications.

J. D. COX,

Brigadier-General.
