large-hearted, lie was a truthful man, an hon-
orable man, a thoroughly manly man. His
charity was as extensive as his knowledge of
suffering, and was princely in its liberality.
He was in his personal relations kindly, affec-
tionate. tender, and winning. No man excelled
him in the brilliancy of his conversation, none
left his presence unimpressed by his ever-active
sympathies. The devotion to his mother of
this lion-hearted man was at once a proof and
an illustration of his capacity for the deepest
and tenderest feeling. Absorbed most of his
life in the keen pursuits of politics, some har-
dening of the nature might naturally have been
expected, for none but those who knew him in
closest intimacy knew how his weary heart
yearned for loving objects to rest upon.
But he has gone. Whatever we may have
felt, in life we all now realize how large a space
he tilled, how sagacious and true he was, how
nobly and unselfishly devoted to his country,
how sedulously careful he was to guard it from
prospective dangers, and how comprehensively
he realized what measures were necessary to
give the country security for the future. Let
us go forward in the policy he traced, fortify
the buttresses of the nation, and let the Re-
public, thoroughly reconstructed upon the prin-
ciples of the Declaration of Independence, and
thereby dedicated to immortal life, be worthily
his ever enduring monument.
The resolutions were unanimously adopted ;
and thereupon (atfour o'clock p. m.) theHouse
adjourned.

of Charles Weile, setting forth certain outrages
committed upon him by the citizens of Tum-

hard ease. The people of that city treated
him very roughly. I do not know what action
can be taken on the subject, but I will ask the
Committee on Foreign Relations to examine
the question, and if need be refer it to the j
State*Department. There ought, to be some- j
thing done about it. We have a large number j
of our whalers that go there. This gentleman
is from my State, lie is a very worthy man,
a man who was trying to do his duty as consul
at this place. There is a state of anarchy
there, and they mobbed him, and treated him
verv roughly. It ought to be regulated in some
way. There ought to be some redress. I
move that the memorial be referred to the
Committee on Foreign Relations.
