(Received 12.50 p. m.)

Brigadier General R. INGALLS,

Chief Quartermaster:

Nothing of importance has transpired. Latest reports show only nine days' grain and two and one-fourth days' hay on hand. Captain James' report of 30th of December shows little more than one day's supply there, and about four days' grain to arrive, per bills lading received. In case the supply keeps falling off, do you wish the daily allowance for the animals reduced?

Captain and Assistant Quartermaster.

The troops being now well protected against the inclemency of the season, the commanding general enjoins upon division commanders the use of every hour of favorable weather for drills and evolutions. Regular recitations in tactics and regulations should now be had, and the Articles of War should be frequently read. A systematic effort should be made by division, brigade, and regimental commanders to bring their troops to the highest practicable state of discipline.

By order of Major-General Humphreys:
