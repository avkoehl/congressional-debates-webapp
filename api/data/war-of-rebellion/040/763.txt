RICHMOND, May 1, 1863.

General R. E. LEE,

Fredericksburg, Va.:

Orders were sent to Wednesday to General Longstreet to move forward his command to re-enforce you. He replied he would do so immediately, but expected to be a little delayed in gathering up his transportation train, to prevent its falling into the hands of the enemy, then in sight. General D. H. Hill, at Kingston, was also directed to send forward a brigade (Ransom's), and from his reply it may be expected here to-night, when it will be immediately pushed forward. You have already been informed by the President of the 1,400 troops sent from here to Gordonsville. I do not look for the arrival of Longstreet's command here before to-morrow evening, on account of difficulty in collecting his train, which may be employed in collecting subsistence in the counties in North Carolina (east).

S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General.
