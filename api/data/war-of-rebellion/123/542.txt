COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS, EXECUTIVE DEPT., Boston, September 13, 1862.

The PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:

SIR: I beg leave to call your attention to a communication sent to you recently by the Governors of the sea-board States (a copy of which is herewith inclosed) in regard to the inequality of the militia draft among the States, caused by withholding any allowance for men sent into the naval service.

The Honorable T. D. Eliot, member of Congress, and the Non. Isaac C. Taber, mayor of New Bedford, are authorized to confer with you upon this subject.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOHN A. ANDREW,

Governor of Massachusetts.

[Inclosure.]

BOSTON, August 29, 1862.

The PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES,

Washington, D. C.:

SIR: We unite in respectfully but most urgently presenting to your attention the inequality of the distribution of the militia draft among the States, caused by withholding any allowance for men sent into the naval service. The New England States have many thousand of volunteers in the National Navy, belonging chiefly to their sea-coast counties, which are nevertheless to be subject ot the same draft as the counties of the inland States. So great is this inequality that if the draft is to be vigorously imposed on some of our sea-ports without making this allowance it will absorb the whole population of those towns within the limits of military age.

ISRAEL WASHBURN, JR.,

Governor of Maine.

NATHANIEL S. BERRY,

Governor of New Hampshire.

JOHN A. ANDREW,

Governor of Massachusetts.

WILLIAM SPRAGUE,

Governor of Rhode Island.

BOSTON, August 29, 1862.

Governor Buckingham, of Connecticut, adds his name to the telegram addressed to you to-day.

JOHN A. ANDREW,

Governor of Massachusetts.
