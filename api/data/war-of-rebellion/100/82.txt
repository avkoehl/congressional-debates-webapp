Lieutenant-General GRANT:

A letter of date 31st, from General Sherman, is just received. He says the enemy is inactive in his front. He will move at the time stated to you. Thinks Lee will unite hs and Johnston's armies, and will not coop himself up in Richmond. Would like to be informed if Sheridan swings off, that he may go out and meet him. Does not believe Sheridan can cross the Roanoke for a month. Will send letter by mail.
