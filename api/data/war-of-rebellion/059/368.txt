They must travel by land, I may be forced to seize even breeding cattle in Tennessee to supply meat, for we can't wait our movement for such matters of economy.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.

BULL'S GAP, April 15, 1864.

Major-General SCHOFIELD:

I have information, which seems reliable, that most of the rebel cavalry remaining above crossed the Holston last night at ferries near Kingsport. They are reported from 1,000 to 1,500 strong. I send a party to warn our men in front, and will take all proper precautions against surprise.

Reports brought back from the rebel lines show they are all informed as to our numbers and the kind, &amp;c., of our force, but the best evidence still is that the bulk of Longstreet's command has continued its eastward movement.

J. D. COX,

Brigadier-General, Commanding Third Division.

KNOXVILLE, April 15, 1864.

Brigadier-General COX,

Bull's Gap:

There is a possibility of the rebels attempting to get in your rear by way of Rogersville. If Longstreet still remains at Bristol he will most likely attempt something of the kind; watch him closely.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.

BULL'S GAP, April 15, 1864.

Major-General SCHOFIELD,

Knoxville:

I am watching our left closely. The Holston is not fordable at present. I have a part of cavalry reconnoitering to-day beyond Greenville.

J. D. COX,

Brigadier-General, Commanding Third Division.

BULL'S GAP, April 15, 1864.

Lieutenant-Colonel BOYD,

Chief Quartermaster, Knoxville:

To complete the wagon bridge at Lick we shall need plank for flooring, which it seems impossible to get here. Can it be furnished from the mill at Knoxville, and, if, so, how soon? It will take about 3,500 feet of 2-inch stuff. I would like to have part of it by to-morrow's train.

J. D. COX,

Brigadier-General, Commanding Third Division.
