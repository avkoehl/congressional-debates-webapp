THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
March 7,
sible, the legislation of Congress should be by
bill and not by joint resolution, as bills and
joint resolutions have to pass through the
same procedure by the rules, aud confusion is
caused by having joint resolutions and bills of
the same number.
tMr. POMEROY. I think the committees,
when they report back a legislative proposi-
tion, no matter whether it be presented as a
bill or a joint resolution, should report it in
the shape of a bill.
The VICE PRESIDENT. If there be no
objection, the joint resolutions presented by
various Senators to-day will be changed into
bills before they are journalized. The Chair
hears 110 objection to that course, and it is so
ordered.

poses; which was read twice by its title.
Mr. FENTON. I give notice that when the
committees are organized I shall ask to have
that bill referred to the Committee on Finance,
and that before its reference, sometime daring
the next week, if the Senate will consent to it,
I shall call up the bill for the purpose of sub-
