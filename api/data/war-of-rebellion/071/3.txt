(Received 9 a. m. 2nd.)

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Chief of Staff:

You need not send any artillery beyond the three batteries already started. Ewell's corps has returned here, but I have no evidence of Breckinridge having returned. Hunter ought to get back on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad as soon as possible. Operating from there, he will have the enemy in front of him.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

JULY 1, 1864.

General AUGUR:

In addition to the three batteries already mounted under General Grant's requisition, you will apply to General Rucker for horses for five others, eight in all, and send them forward as soon as remounted and supplied.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.

WASHINGTON, July 1, 1864-12.30 p. m.

Major-General HUNTER,

Near Gauley, W. Va.:

Lieutenant-General Grant wishes a personal interview.+ You will, therefore, as soon as you can safely leave your command, repair to his headquarters on James River. In the mean time your troops should be so stationed as to prevent any serious raid by the enemy now in the Valley.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
