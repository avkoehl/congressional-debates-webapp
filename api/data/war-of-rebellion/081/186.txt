[General WARREN:]

GENERAL: My skirmishers have advanced until the enemy's works are plainly visible. I am pushing my lines as close as possible to the enemy's works. The sharpshooters that fired into these woods have been driven off. My line is still moving on.

Very respectfully,S. W. CRAWFORD,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS THIRD DIVISION, June 18, 1864.

[General WARREN:]

GENERAL: I am now in the cut of the railroad. Beyond this is a deep ravine, and beyond a slope, on the crest of which is the line of works of the enemy. A creek runs along the ravine, and this, with the railroad and ravine,will break the lines as they move. Shall I go on alone?

Very respectfullY,

S. W. CRAWFORD,

Brigadier-General.

Your right will not extend beyond its present position to the right, and making your connection with General Burnside. Your left will connect with General Griffin's right. You will consult with him about where the point of junction shall be. Bring off all you dead and wounded, and all the arms that can be found.

GENERAL: I have received the dispatch. Under the circumstances the attack can be postponed, and as there will be no support on my right it is probably better that it should be more carefully considered.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,S. W. CRAWFORD,

Brigadier-General.
