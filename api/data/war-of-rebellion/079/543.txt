Major-General THOMAS:

The following dispatch has just been received from Brown's Ferry, dated October 31, 9 a. m.:

The enemy has made his appearance opposite this place and is firing on my pickets. I heard beating of a drum a few minutes ago, but do not know exactly where it was; believe is was across the river.

W. JONES, JR.,

Captain Tenth Indiana Cavalry.

R. S. GRANGER,

Brigadier-General.

(Same to General Rouseau.)
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,Nashville, Tenn., October 31, 1864-12. 30 p. m.

Brigadier-General GRANGER,

Decatur, Ala.:

I do not think you need have any fear of Wheeler; therefore you can hold part of your force in readiness to re-enforce any point that may need re-enforcement. The crossing of Elk River between Athens and Florence should be obstructed and held as soon as our troops are safely across, and if Croxton has not done so I wish you to obstruct it. I have ordered General Stanley to move his whole corps to Pulaski to defend that place.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding.

NASHVILLE, TENN., October 31, 1864.

Brigadier General R. S. GRANGER,

Huntsville and Decatur:

If General Croxton has not already obstructed the enemy's passage across the Elk River I wish you to send a sufficient force there at once to do so and to guard the fords. Hold your troops in Decatur in readiness to re-enforce any points that may need re-enforcement. Acknowledge receipt.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding.

DECATUR, ALA., October 31, 1864-2 p. m.

Major-General THOMAS:

The new regiments or ready to march and join General Stanley. If they are taken away, and the enemy turns upon this place, what shall I do? Shall I send him the regiments?

R. S. GRANGER,

Brigadier-General.
