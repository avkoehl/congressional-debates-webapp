I sent out two companies about dark this evening to scour the woods on Albion Heights, back of the town, where it was reported the enemy had a body of cavalry. After proceeding about 2 miles they were fired upon; 1 of our men killed and 1 wounded.

WASHINGTON, May 28, 1862.- 12.45.

Brigadier-General SAXTON:

Direction has been given General Banks to get his force in order to establish a communication with you for the purpose of reoccupying his former lines. He has also been directed to supply you with transportation. Shields is moving toward Front Royal and Strasburg. It is designed to leave at Harper's Ferry a sufficient force to make that place secure.

I sent out a strong party toward Martinsburg, this morning. General Banks sent me a telegram this morning, informing me that two regiments of cavalry and some infantry were there; also that a prisoner says that Ashby was ordered to Winchester yesterday morning, and withdrew with a portion of his cavalry and some artillery. General Banks says he shall occupy Falling Waters to-day. He believes that the enemy is still strong at Winchester. Lieutenants Daniels and Dahlgren have their battery in position on the heights, commanding all the points in this vicinity, and had some splendid practice with the larger Dahlgren, shelling the woods and heights across the Shenandoah, where our scouting party was killed.
