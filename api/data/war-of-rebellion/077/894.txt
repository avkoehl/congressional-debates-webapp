Enemy have advanced to Greeneville in force. I shall be forced to fall back.

J. C. VAUGHN,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

Major JohnSTON,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

CARTER'S STATION, November 3, 1864.

The enemy are at Jonesborough in force. What re-enforcements need I expect from you, and when? Answer at once.

J. C. VAUGHN,

Brigadier-General.

Major JohnSTON,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

CARTER'S STATION, November 4, 1864.

Colonel Palmer moved toward Asheville to protect his line as soon as it was exposed. Your re-enforcements should come immediately, or I may not be able to check the enemy before they reach Bristol.

J. C. VAUGHN,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

Major-General BRECKINRIDGE.

WARRENSBURG, November 11, 1864-1 p. m.

GENERAL: I am at this place with my command. I find Lick Creek on the road direct to the gap so deep that I cannot ford it. I may be able to ford it on the road down the river near the mouth, six miles from here. Therefore I shall be delayed in getting in the rear of the gap until late to-night or to-morrow morning. I have not heard yet whether they have left the gap or not. I have not heard from my scouts who left my camp last evening. Will report to you as soon as I get any information from them. Shall be glad to receive any further instructions from you.

Yours, very respectfully,

J. C. VAUGHN,

Brigadier-General.

I find the roads almost impassable.

2. 30 P. M.

Firing has been heard in the direction of Blue Springs, and the creek being up, I hear, will swim some more scouting parties across the creek to go to the railroad and learn whether there is any movement from the gap.

[Major-General BRECKINRIDGE.]
