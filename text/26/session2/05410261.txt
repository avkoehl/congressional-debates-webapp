wanis of (he Government, it is my conviction that
resort must be hid to an increase of duties upon
luxuries, which, by the compromise act, are free,
or bear a les« rate of duty than 20 per cent. Such
an increase will not be in, violation of that act, but
in compliance with one of its express stipulations.
I do not make void, but establish the compromise.
And the great reason why I would thus early com-
mence the imposition of duties is, that the act of
1833, not merely until its own limitations shall re-
peal it, but tbrougn generations to come, m all its
conservative stipulations, may become the perma-
nent policy of the country.
Before proceeding to show that an increase of
duties is provided for in the act of 1833, I beg
leave to say that I Gonsider that act in the light oí
a compact, and that Southern mteres's, more if
possible than Northern, require it to be so held,
and as such religiously maintained It is an
agreement founded m concession It provides
guaranties in behalf of the free trade principles of
the South It originated in an imperious political
nscesnty, it was devised in wise and patriotic coun-
sels, and its result was the arrest of civil strife in.
l's mcipiency. I need not recite its history, de-
pict the evils it prevented, or aggravate the dangers
to our Union which it avoided The passions of
that day have cooled down, and we may look
back upon it with reason's unclouded eye The
then dense cloud of war; and the fogs and winds
and lightnings which it engendered, have pas<ed
away, and we now see, not darkly, but truly, the
political heavens and earth That was in fact a
crisis All men felt it to be so And in its mo-
ment of utmost and most fearful interest the mas-
ter spirit of that day came to us, the bird of recon-
ciliation, with the olive bough in his beak The
fiery and proud spirits of the South accepted 'he
overture ot harmony, and thi= act was the result
It is an agreement, sir, not to subsist for its term
of legislative being only, but settling principles oí
perpetual obligation The gentleman who has
]U3t taken his seat [Mr Rhett] denies mat it is
obligatory upon us He says, and says truly, that
the Congress ot 1833 could not bind that of 1841,
and that the act is now subject to repeal Sir, I
know one Congrí s , by amere act of leg slation,
cannot bind aeolher The gentleman io r ght
technically, but, sir, the act ot '33 is binding in a
higher view of the subject It is obhpatoiy ac
cording to all the requirements of g od faith, honor,
and honesty In what light did the men of tnat day
view li? Did not Ihe Nuilifiers of South Carolina
accept it as satisfactory? Did they not haui down
their palmetto banner, rescind their or ¡manees,
and disband their forces? Yes, sir, they did And
it was upon sufficient consideration, or otherwise
they are open to the imputation of abandoning re-
creantly the lofty gtound they had taken
[Mr. Rhett here remaiked that Mr Calhoun
avowed, at the time of its passage, that he did not
hold the act of '33 so far obliga ory as not to be
subject to repeal or modification ]
It ma'ters not, sir, he accepted it, and so did
his friends, and they h^ve acquiesced in its fro vi-
sions from that day to this—all, sir, except my
friend, [¡Mr Rhstt] He, Í know, never did ac-
cept it He, (to u>e a phrase peculiai to a man at
the other endoi this Capitol,) ' solitary and alone,"
resisted, in toe midst of hi« friends, the rescinding
the celebrated Carolina ordinances. He is, there-
fore, now consistent
Viewing it, then, as a compact, one ol its stipu-
lations is in the following words, to wit
"Provided That nothing herein contained shall be so con
struedas to pieventthe passage of any act prior to the 30ih
day of lune 1842, m t« contingency either o! exce  or defi
ciency of íevenue, atteiins; the rates of dunes on articles which
by the aforesaid act of I4ih fitly 1032 are subject to a less rate
of dutv than 2Ú per cent ad valorem, in such manner as n t to
exceed that late and so as to adj ust the revenue to either of said
contingencies ' —See sec 6 act 1833
The 30th June, 1842, is the time at which the
compromise act expires Before that time, you
perceive, sir, that provision is made for altering
the rate of duties, m the contingency ot excess oi
deficiency of revenue, that is, if before the 30 h of
June, 1842 the wants of the Government should re-
quire more money than would be raised under the act,
provision is made for supplying that want by the
imposition of additional duties.    Not only so, but
the act itself prescribes the artic'es upon which the
duties shall be imposed, and limi s the height of
them Such is the contract. The coittnf ency an-
ticipated has, in fact, occurred, there is a deficiency
of revenue, the debts of the Government cannot
be paid Indeed, independent of any debt, the or-
dinary wants of an economical Administration can-
not be supplied by the revenue which is forthcom-
ing undei the act The income of the Govern-
ment is still to be reduced by the necessary opera-
tion of that act, because it cuts down all duties, by
30th June, 1842, to 20 per cent. Each following
year, the deficiency will increase, necessarily, until
1842 And, making all al'owance tor increased
importations, I have no idea but that the deficiency
in both 1841 and 1842 will be very great Now, sir,
it is to supply this deficiency, and pay the national
debt, that I would lay new duties. Are «e not per-
mitted, nay, sir, is it not one of the imperative ob-
ligations of the compact, to do so? What becomes,
then, of the idea of gentlemen, that we interfere
with the compromise The~e demonstrations, 1 ap-
prehend, are designed only to excite a uniform op-
position to what, 1 trust, will be the policy of the
Harrison party ¡n relation to revenue That poli-
cy, I believe, ought and v. ill be to raise the money
necessary, by impo is upon luxuries that are un
pro ected, m addition to the amount that may come
in, according to the mm mum rate , under the act
of 1833 It v ould 'eem, sir, that the marmfac
turers themselves, if an/ body, ought to coruplam
of a drregard of the compromise, jet they com-
plain not. The complaint comes from the alarm-
ists of the South, that South which, I am prepared
to show, hold a deeper stake in the sulemn gua-
ranties of the compromise han ?ny < ih i sect on
of the Union
By the section of the act of 1833 which I have
read, you v 1 perceive that tie articles made du-
tiable by new legislatu n are such as by the act of
1832, bear a less rate of duty than 20 per cent ad
valorem Upon no othei articles can you lay du-
ties, and t is only upon them, or rather principally
upon such articles as bear no duty, that a duty is
proposed to be laid Oí course, no free amele is
proiected, nor are such as bear a duly cf ¡e s than
twenty p8r cent , fcr it is admitted that even twen-
ty per cent afiords to protection if, thereroie,
you this day readjust ti e dunes on to s < a s < f <u-
ticl"s, you pais no tariff act for p election, and
such rate oí duty as I am wi ling to lay, such as
would raise ample revenue, would not at all effect
even the importation
Those articles upon wtueb. it is, pioposed to lay
dut e aie suks at d w ncs, and some others being
luxune The importation oí silks frem Prance is
very great The avtra|,e impoits from France and
her West India depent encies annually ami tint to
about $11 000 000. Tms enormous trade pays no
tax It would seem but reastrab'e trom this
source io realue restnue But it ¡s said by the
gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Rhett) tha
a duty upon silks would injure thj Soutn His ar-
gument is briliy his A duty upon ¡;oods imp i'ed
¡from a foreign Staie afftcts our own t xp rts to that
State, by r> ducm° ihem France i amaiketior
the cotton ol the South, wh ch she pays for by
sending us her silks and wines, it we tax her silks
and wines it will operpte as a tax upon ihe export
of cotton, and thereby reduce the amount of it
Let us look ¡mo this argument, and see how tar
the principle assumed be true, and h ■.i far it is ap-
plicable to the trade between the United Stales and
France The position, I cmceue, sir, is j ist m
two contmgenc c« If the duties upon the imports
are so large as to «-mount u. a proh bition, it may
be conceded at once that it will in ordinary case ,
prevent expor ation, or, if the exports and imports
a'e cq tal to the extent that the duty dimini nes ihe
importation by lessening the consumption, will
usually, though by no mtans neeessauly, reduce
the export Now, the argument of the gentleman
seeme i to assume that ue piopose to lay sue1! a
duty on silks as would amount to a prohibition,
?nd upon that a^umption there nignt be force n
it But not «o, "o on his dreamed ol ueh a du
ty The highest ¡ate of duty<:uggest d by any one
is t venty per cent, and I believe half that amount
would be sufficient.   The gentleman has wholly
failed to show that such duties would affect at all
theconsump ion of silks m the United States No,
sit, a moderate duty would not at ail affect the im-
port, because the consumption would be undimi-
nished Our belles and beauties, our dames and
their daughters, will still flourish m flounces, fur
belows and silks The wealthy, who are the con-
suméis mainly of silk goods, would not regard a
small increase of price Pride, fashion, and vani-
ty, would still ask their supplies, and take no de-
nial
If the gentleman will lay duty on no article that
is paid for in whol  or m part by American cot-
tons, why then he will never lay on?, his position
will drive him necessarily from imposts to direct
taxation, for he knows well that cotton, m our
commerce with the world, pays, m some degree,
and indeed in great part, lor all our imports
When asked by his colleague [Mr Thompson] to
name an articie that was not so paid for, my friend
was wisely silent.
Nor, sir, are the imports from and exports to
France so nearly equal as to endanger our cotton
trade On ths contrary, the balance of trade is
largely agamst us And this fact must demolish
wholly the argument of the gen eman. Tne en-
tiro axport from the United States to France, com-
posed fnncipally of cotton, ¡ice, and tobacco,
amounts to about $t9,000,000, and ths ímporta-
t ons from France and her West India dependen-
cies to ab ut $33,000,000—leaving a balance
ajairast us of j,14 000,000, which balance is $>atd
by an export ot specie Now, sir, before it is pos
sible lo affect our cotton tr?ie win France, the
consumption, and, consequently, th importation,
of rer silks and wine , &c must be reduced more
han $14 000,000 No rate ot duty that I shall
ever consent to impos-e, and none tha* an economi
cal Admin siration may demand, can ever thus les
sen the importation of French goods
Again, sir, the cotton which we send to France
is consumed by her own people principally, and
that demand must continue irrespective of at y fo-
reign demand for her silks and wines And con-
ceding, only foi the sake of the argument, that a
duty as proposed wou'd lessen the consumption of
silk , I believe in the «ame ¡atio would it increase
the consumption ot cotton fabrics If si'ks are ex-
cluded, cotton will become the apparel of the ncn
as «ell as ihe pooc We are ur>der no obligation,
eiihei, sir, of comn.eic &\ courtesy tj F ?nce, for
sh^ lev e a duty at her o«n pel s up n American
co tons—and that a di cria nating dut , it being
mo e than she lev eo upon Egyptian cotton
