(Sent by orderly.)
HEADQUARTERS SECOND CORPS, March 29,1 865-2 p. m.

Major-General WEBB,Chief of Staff:

I have opened the road, which was blocked, and taken the entrenched picket-line which was scarcely more than watched. I believe that it runs to Dabney's Mill on our right. Have sent to see, and expect every moment to hear form General Hays that his reconnaissance of 300 men is there. This entrenched line, however, does not cross the Quaker road a mile north of Quaker Meeting-house, but turns toward Gravelly run, passing by Miles' left. I sent out the escort to follow out the road which intersects the Quaker road about one mile north of Quaker Meeting-house.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General.
