captured and that the enemy was repulsed from Collierville; they will therefore doubtless be in this vicinity during the day, and by frequent communication with you we shall be able, I think, to drive them to an engagement,which, if we succeed in doing, will try to capture their artillery and teach them a lesson they will not forget. Keep me well informed of all movements, &amp;c. Keep a sharp lookout to the front and rear, as they may get infantry below.

Colonel HATCH and Lieutenant-Colonel PHILLIPS:

The bearer of this dispatch was sent from here about noon to-day, and has returned, reporting that he was fire upon about 10 miles from here on the road to Quinn's Mill; states that he saw two squadrons of the enemy and there was the appearance of more in the rear of those. Inform me if the enemy is coming up on that road.

[General SWEENY:]

I am holding the fords of the Coldwater to the east of Lockhart's Mill with both brigades of cavalry. The enemy has left a small force in front of La Grange to mislead, and in my judgment has moved with two large bodies east and west. Ferguson is reported to be at Albany with 4,000 men. Another force has probably attacked the railroad somewhere toward Collierville. Phillips and myself each have that opinion.

Respectfully,

EDWARD HATCH,

Colonel, Commanding Cavalry.
HEADQUARTERS CAVALRY DIVISION,On Road to Salem, October 12, 1863-7 a.m.

General HURLBUT:

The enemy are retreating toward Holly Springs and the Tallahatchie River. I will push them home and see whether they have infantry on the Tallahatchie.

ED. HATCH,

Colonel, Commanding Cavalry.
