Mr TALLMADGE presented a petition from
Silas M Stilwell, a citizen of New York, m rela-
tion to the abolishment of imprisonment for debt
m the United States    Mr T said th« petitioner m
this case was a gentleman of s'anding, and had
been for many years a member oí the Legislature
of that State, m fact, he be'ieved, at the very time
the odious sys'em o imprisonment for debt had
been abandoned Notwithstanding this, the ano-
maly has existed of persons being imprisoned for
debt under the Jaws of the United States, which
lavts infringed on the personal liberty of the citi-
zens of New Yoik, in -violation of the express will
of the State The just and humane enactment of
the Legislature had been rcmleied a mere nullity,
because persons from other States had the privi-
lege of bulging their suits in the United States
courts, indeed, there had been instances of persons
lemovmg from tne State of New York m order to
acquire a residence in another Slate, for the very
puipcse of availing themselves, of the United
¡antes courts Mi P aid wh it the petitioner de-
sned, was <iii entne abdishment of the odious
prac ice, but if so en! «htened a b dv as Congress
should not agree w ih I is v lews, he (die petitioner)
praved that it would at lease so far acquiesce, as
to make the United Sia es lavs conform with the
laws of those States wherein impr sonment fur
debt wis abolished This petition was refeired to
ihe Comm ttee on the Judiciary, and ordered to he

tice, he believed, at the close of the last session,
that he w ould, at an early period of the present
