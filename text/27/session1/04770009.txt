APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
27th Con®.... 1st Skss.
Report of the Postmaster General.
Senate and H. of Reps.
would our trade have beets liable to great in erwp-
tion, and oar merchants to great losses abroad, but
a naval force, comparatively «mall, might, on our
very shores, have seized our merchant ships and in-
sulted our flag, without suitable means ot resistance
01 immediate retal ation beag at the command of
'he Government. To guard against such a result—
to oe ever ready to repel or promptly to chastise ag-
gressions upon our own shores, it is necessary that
a powerful squadron should be kept afloat at home.
This measure is recommended by other consi-
derations There is no situaron in which gre iter
skill or seamanship can be exercised and acquired
than on the coast of the United States, and in no
service would our office s and seamen become more
thoroughly initiated m all that is necessary for the
national defence and glory In that service, aid d
by the coast survey now in progress, a tht rough
acquaintance wou'd be gained with, our own sea-
coast, extensive and huh>rto but irnperf°ctly known
—the vanou  ports would be visited—the bays, in-
lets, and harbors carefully examined—the u^e to
which each could be made available during war,
either ior escape, defence, or annojance, be ascer-
tained, and the confidence resul mg from perfect
knowledge would give to us, what we ought surely
to possess, a decided advantage over an enemy on
our own shores Should it be thought desirable
that such a squadron be put in commission imme-
diately and kept constantly on duty, an additional
appropriation may be necessary, for the amount ot
which, as well as the force deemed picper to be em-
ployed, I beg to refer to the accompanying report
on the subject, prepared under my directions by
the Board of Navy Commissioners.
The attention ef Congress has been heretofore
earnestly invited to the state of our ordnance and
ordnance stores, and I de m it worthy of ímmed'-
ate consideration. A sufficient supply of suitable
aims and munitions of wans indispensable to tne
successful operation of the brave t officers and men,
and it cannot, from the nature of the ca«e, be pro-
vided upon a sudden emergency Sailors may be
hastily collected from our commercial marine, ships
may be purchased, but oidnance cannot ba sup-
plied on such an emergency, nor can some of the
materials for the preparation of ammunition be
procured eithei by puichase or manufacture.
Hence the ordnance should, by a timely foresight,
be provided in advance, and the mater ais be e
cured, from which a supply of ammum ion can be
speedily prepared. The accompanying report
from the Board of Navy Commissions shows the
amount of expenditure which will be required un-
der th s head. Should the object be deemed of
such importance and urgency as to require the im-
mediate attention of Congress, I re<pectfully re
commend that an appropriation of one-third of the
estimated amount be now made.
The opinion «ems to have become general, a?
well in the service as in the nation at hrge, that a
thorough reorganization of the navy is demanded
by considerations connected with the defence and
honor of the ciuntry, and in this opinion I heartily
concur Yet I am fully aware that any plan for
this purpose should be the result of the most care-
ful deliberaiion, and that it would be at oí ce un-
wise and injurious to submit to C >f Tess and the
country any proposed arrangements which should
be liable to the charge of haste and íncons'deration
Deeply sensible, therefore, at once of the impor-
tance and difficulty of the measure, I have taken
proper steps to collect and avail myself ot all the
results of experience and observation from those
whose opportunities have afforded the means of
knowledge, and their intelligence the ability to use
them profitably, and Í entertain ihe hope of being
able, before the next regular meeting of Congress,
to submit for your consideration a comprehensive
and well digested system of reform m the branch ef
the puolic service committed to my charge.
I have the honor to be, with the highest respect,
your most obedient servant,
GEORGE E   BADGER.
To the President of the United S ates
REPORT OF THE POSTMASTER GENERAL.
Post Office Department, May 23, 1841.
Sir: The arrangement of business at, and the
manner cf returns to, ibe General Post Office, for-
bid a detailed report of its operations at the ap-
proaching session of Congress I have, howevei,
felt i' my duty at this time to call public attention
to the present state of its finances, so far as I have
yet been ¿ble to learn their condition.
When first entermg upon my offical duties, my
attention was forced to the con«tant demands for
payment bejond ihe ability of the Depaitment io
discharge, and with a view to ascertain, as nearly
as might be, its undisputed liabilities and probable
means on 'he 2 lot day of Mi"-ch last, a letter was
addressed to the Auditor of the Treasury for ¡he
PiSt Office Department, ■equestmgf'om him infor-
mation on those ski ji_i is A copy of which letter,
.marked A, is hure« th submitted. Such state-
ments have not been furnished, for reasons clearly
set for h m a letter from the Auditor, dated the
25 h day of May instant, of which copy ¡s hereto
appended, marked B
It was also important to karn, witkout delay,
whaf were the pressing liabilities and what the ac-
tive funds of ihe Department For this purpose,
directions were given to the ehipf clerk to state the
amount due to contractors anterior to and for the
quarter ending 31st Decembpr, 1840, so far as they
had been reported by the Auditor, and also the
amount m deposite, subject to draft, for the dis-
charge of such arrearages His repon is herewith
submitted, marled C
By an examination of that statement, it will
be seen th?t there was due and unpaid to contrac
tors, of ascertained balances, on the first day of
January last, four hundred andfmty-seven thousand
and twenty nine dollars, ($447 029,) a considerable
portion ot which has been paid Irom the revenues
of the quarter ending on the 31st March. A re-
port from the Auditor upon the outstanding con-
tracts will undoubtedly, increase this amount of
indeotedn s toa t< tal exceeding half a mill on of
dollars In addition to v,h eti, heavy demards art-
frequently made on the Department upon un! qui-
dated claimb Of such d< mands no notice can be
taken at this time, nor is it proper that an opinion
as to then justice should be now expressed.
Under these circumstances, two questions natu-
rally present themselves How is the Department
to be sustained under its present embarrassments?
and, What are its financial hopes for the future1
As no estimates, upon which can be based an
answer to tt-e first inquiry, can be presented until
a full s aiemeni of ihe balances due from postmas-
ters shall have been reported by the Auditor, it is
passed, with the single remark that, although it can
hardly be doubted that a larj,e aggregate sum will
be found due, it is to be leared that, from the small
amount of most of such separa'e balantes, «catter
ed throughout this wide-spread nation, the want of
responsibility in many of these officers and many
of their securities, and the lap^e of time since these
balances accrued, but an inconsiderable part of the
amount due will ever be recived It therefore
remains for Congress to determine v hether the
amount now due to contractors shall be paid from
ihe National Treasury, or whether this Depart-
ment shall sttugsle on with Us present embarrass-
ments, consuming Us daily pccrmng revenues in
the par íal payment of o d debts, and still leaving
large balances which A has sot 'ha ability to dis-
charge
Notwithstanding the heavy increased expet di-
ture consequent upon the act of 7th July, 1838, and
although instead of the supposed giadual increase
of revenue, the receipts for the quarter ending 3Kt
March last, present, as compared with the corre-
sponding quarter of the year before, a diminution
of more than six per cent still the Department
would prooably find sufficient relief in its future
operations from the decrease of prices n h ch, it
may be calculated, wi 1 be hereafter demanded up-
on most of the rou es, were it not for tne continu-
ally increasing exaetions in other branches of the
service.
To present this subject in ju, most intelligible
fori", the First Assist?nt Postmaster General has
prepared a tabular view of recent proposa's, that
comparison may be made between the amount of
present bids ai'd the sums now paid for mail ser-
viee upon the same routes. This table is hereto
annexed, marked D.
On an examination of this statement, it will be
seen that, m some cases, the amount demanded by
railroad companies for transportation of the mails
is more than two hundred per cent, higher than is
paid for coach serviee, upon roads forming connect,
mg links between different railroad companies,
upon the same mam route, and that too where the
night service upon the railroads is less than that
performed in coaches. Such demands deserve
more consideration from the fact that, whilst at the
recent lettings in New York and m the six Eastern
States the accepied service by coaches and other
modes of conveyance has been secured at an average
saving of twenty two per cent upon the contractsof
1837, there are but few instances where the de-
mands of incorporated companies have not been
increased in iuch manner as imposed upon me the
necessity of suspending the contracts Nor is the
extravagant price demanded for mail transporta-
tion upon railroadb the only manner in which these
incorporations affect the revenue of this Depart-
ment. The facilities secured by this mode of con-
veyance for sending letters by private hands very
seriously dimmish the receipts of the offices upon
these routes A single illustration will establish
this assertion.
Boston is one of the most important points of
railroad concentration in the Union Its business
prosperity is proverbial; and yet in that city the
quaiter ending 3Kt March last shows, as com-
pared with the corresponding quarter of the year
before, a decrease in postage receipts of three thou-
sand one hundred and ninety five dollars—being dou-
ble the amount of diminution to be found, within
th  «ame time, in any other post office in the na-
tion, wilh the single exception of Philadelphia,
«h ch is another great terminus of railroad com-
munication
Tce«e facts are presented in no spirit of unkind-
ness towards those to whose management these in-
corporations are intrusted, but that I have consi-
dered it due to our whole people to refer to this
subject, as one which will ere long call for national
and State legislation, unless a corrective be sooner
applied by public opinion.
A considerable saving will be found in the cur-
tailment of service generally, directed up my im-
mediate predecesor, in limiting the transportation
of the mai's to six trips a week upon most of the
routes throughout the nation. The embarrassed
condition of the Department, if it wds to remain
unaided by Government, clearly indicated the pro-
priety of some reduction of service, and the reli-
gious sense of tne community will certainly ap-
prove the feeling that selects the Sabbath as the ore
on which that serv ce should not be performed.
Yet it cannot be denied that this ordsr has borne
heavily on contractor*, and in many instances
causes great derangement in the transportation of
tne mails.
Whilst in some sections of our country this alte-
ration has noi only received a cheerful acquies-
cence, but is warmly approved, there has been
great gener?l complaint of its operation, and daily
appeals for the old facilities are pressed upon the
Depaitment Without entering upon this subject
at large, it is sufficient for my present purpose to
s-tate that, as this order purports to have been given
to reduce the expense* of the Department, and to
aid in bringing tl em within its receipts, a return to
the former servic , at thrstime, might well be con-
sidered as a declaration of my confidence in its
ability to sustain the expenditure necesiary for
such restoration I have, therefore, felt it impera-
tive upon me to adhere to this order of curtailment.
The building now being erected for the General
Post Office is so far advanced as to give assurance
that it can be completed before the session of Con-
gress jn December. Tbis w much to be desired,
not only for the convenience of the transaction of
business, but that the public property may be
kept in security Sacli mean*, as are kept
ii my power are continually employed to protect
the present building from fire, but in its exposed
condition the danger of destruction to the boobs
