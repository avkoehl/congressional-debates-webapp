Colonel Rowett will doubtless encamp at Lexington to-morrow night, December 11, 1863, at which place your force will join him, and he will then proceed to scour the country in every direction, obtaining all information possible, picking up what prisoners he can from the enemy who may be scattered throughout the country, and aiding Union families to make their escape to our lines.

Colonel M. M. BANE,

Fiftieth Illinois Infantry,comdg. Third Brigade:

You will move out Colonel Miller's regiment, or the Fiftieth Illinois, or a force of mounted infantry equal to either, as early in the morning as possible, to proceed to Florence, Ala., via Lawrenceburg, Tennessee, to co-operate with a force sent from this place under Colonel Rowett, who proceeds slowly toward Lexington, where he will probably encamp to-morrow night, December 11, 1863, and also a force sent out from Waynesborough. Colonel Rowett will move out from this place on the road pursued by this command when it came to Pulaski. The object of this movement is to drive out a considerable force of the enemy reported to be between Lawrenceburg and Florence. The regiment will be supplied with four days' rations of salt, sugar, bread, and coffee, and 40 rounds of ammunition per man, and will, if possible, join Colonel Rowett at Lexington to-morrow night.
