TIIE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
July 10,
Mr. MAYNARD. I desire to say in this
case that in the opposition I have made to the
resolution I have not been moved by any
doubt that the present clerk has rendered ser-
vice commensurate with what it is proposed to
pay him. It is not because I do not think he
is worthy of all the resolution would give him;
but I can see in this resolution that it fastens
upon us another salaried officer in the shape
of a committee clerk. Reference has been
made to the clerk of the Committee of Claims.
Before the establishment of the Court of Claims
that committee had all the business before it
that now devolves upon the Court of Claims.
Jtwas really a judicial body. It kept a record,
and it was necessary to have a clerk of consid-
erable acquirements. He was, in fact, a man
of very high character. But since the Court
of Claims has been established the business
of the committee has dwindled and become
inconsiderable, and the clerk of that commit-
tee ought not to be salaried any more than ten
other clerks of committees in the House. We
know that the Committee on Invalid Pensions
has a great amount of business to do at this
time, but after one or two Congresses the busi-
ness will fall off unless we have another war.
We know the claims of pensioners under the
revolutionary war and the war of 1812 are
referied to a single committee, and that it has
very little work at all. If I am incorrect my
colleague will correct me. I should be un-
willing, therefore, to see the clerk of this com-
mittee made a salaried officer. The House has
never been niggardly toward its officers. It has
always been liberal, and I am quite sure it will
be so in this case. I trust, therefore, that the
gentleman will not feel bound to pass his reso-
lution.
Mr. MILLER. A word in reply to the gen-
tleman from Tennessee. I hope he will not
insist, upon his objection. This laborer is cer-
tainly worthy of his hire. We have had dur-
ing this session seven hundred and eighty-five
cases before the committee. This gentleman
has received for his compensation during the
last Congress for one year only $792. He has
had to commence early in the morning and
work till late in the day. The lowest salary
of Department clerks is $1,200, and they work
from nine till three or four o'clock. Now, I
am perfectly willing to limit the compensation
to the present Congress. We ought to include
the entire Fortieth Congress, but as the Clerk
of the House has settled the account till the
1st of .July we cannot go back. This gives
the young man a meager compensation for the
labor he lias before him. The constituents of
the gentleman from Tennessee bring before
our committee their full share of the labor
which this clerk has to perform. I hope,
therefore, the resolution will pass. I demand
the previous question.
The SPEAKER. The Chair understands
the gentleman to amend the resolution limit-
ing the compensation to the 4th of March,
18l>9. If there is no objection the amendment
will be considered as agreed to. The question
is on the resolution as amended.
Mr. MAYNARD. 1 understood the gentle-
man to demand the previous question.
The SPEAKER. Does the gentleman insist
on the previous question?
Mr. MAYNARD. Suppose the previous
question is sustained, and the House then
adjourns, when will the resolution come up
before the House again?
The SPEAKER. The Chair thinks it will
come up as unfinished business as soon as the
business pending at the recess to-day is com-
pleted in reference to the Palls of St. Anthony.
Mr. MAYNARD. I suggest that it take
that course.
Accordingly, by unanimous consent, the pre-
vious question was seconded and the main
question ordered.
Mr. MAYNARD. I move that the House
adjourn.
â€¢The motion was agreed to ; and thereupon
(at nine o'clock and forty minutes p. m.) the
House adjourned.
