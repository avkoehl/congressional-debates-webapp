culating spirit of speculation. But other causes
have accelerated speculation, and a sudden ex-
pansion of credit within the last two years. The
severe lessons we received between 1818 and 1820, '
from overbanking and overtrading, arrested for a
time, the increase of banking capital; and in the
ten years from 1820 to 1830, the increase was
only about fifteen millions, while from 1830 to
the present time it has been suddenly augmented
more than one hundred millions. Owing to this
cause, and the solid prosperity of the country,
there was a strong tendency to overtrading, when
the bank of the United States commenced curtail-
ing in 1333, and in nineteen months reduced its
loans and exchange nearly nineteen millions in
November, 1834. This reduction had its effect
upon the banks and trade of the country. But
the moment the bank changed its policy, and
united with other banks, and with trade, in ex-
panding business and credit, the spirit of specu-
lation suddenly spread throughout the Union.
Between November, 1834, and July, 1835, the
bank increased its issues between nine and ten
millions, and its loans and exchanges about nine-
teen millions and a half. This affords some idea
of the vast and sudden expansion of the business
of all the banks in the Union, and of the increase
of that immense mass of private credit which it
is impossible to measure. One other cause—and
a powerful one it is—has added to this spirit of
speculation, and is sufficient to explain the mys-
tery about exchange. Our act altering the rela-
tive value of gold and silver made the formen,
the chief currency of Europe, more valuable here
than it ¡3 there: we suddenly became purchasers,
after being for so many years venders of gold;
and the effect of that act was to substitute gold,
in place of silver, as our currency.                          i
But whatever may have been the causes of the |
present condition of the country, it is an unnat- '
ural one. Prices cannot continue to rise; the tide
of trade and revenue cannot roll on forever.   The
moment it reaches its utmost point of elevation, '
the returning ebb will be felt in every quarter of
this Union; and we shall feel it—sensibly feel it,
in every branch of our revenue.    We have been
for eighteen months past as we were from 1816
to 1818.    We had a revenue from customs in
1816 of #36,000,000, which fell to #13,000,000 in
1821. Our imports were, according to the Treas-
ury statements, #133,000,000 in 1816, and but
$41,000,000 in 1821.    Our sales of public lands
were, in 1815, #2,300,000.    They rose to about
$7,200,000 in 1818; then rose suddenly to about
§17,700,000 in 1819; and as suddenly fell in 1820
to #1,900,000.    Such, sir, has been our experi-
ence; and yet we are told we are to have no dim-
inution!    Your importations may go on at the
rate of #150,000,000 to #200,000,000 annually,
but the higher they reach the more terrible will
be the revulsion.    If between 1816 and 1821 they
fell from #133,000,000 to #41,000,000, where is
the reduction to stop when the ebb follows our
present flood? Will it stop at #100,000,000, more
than double the amount in 1830, or will it stop at
#75,000,000, far beyond the usual amount im-
ported for consumption in former years?  Before
gentlemen tamper with our revenue and empty
our Treasury, I hope they will devise the ways
and means to fill it again.   Before they squander
or distribute our existing surplus, let them reflect
that we have relinquished the duty on nearly half
of all our importations; let them inquire what
revenue one half of even #100,000,000 would give
at the twenty per cent, proposed in the compro-
mise act.
If our tariff, as it now is, had existed in 1821,
your revenue from customs would have been less
than seven millions. In our prospective calcula-
tions on our revenue from customs, we have but
two years, and those of heavy importations, to
guide us—1834 and 1835. In the former year the
whole importation of merchandise for consump-
tion was «87,000,000, of which #47,200,000 were
hable to duty, and $39,800,000 were free of
duty. In 1835 the aggregate was #122,000,000,
$64,000,000 dutiable, and $58,000,000 free. As-
suming the same ratio for past years, and the
«mount heretofore imported, which are now
chargeable with duty, will be found to be for the
ten years ending with 1829, at an average of
v26,700,000; that for 1830 but $27,000,000; and
the average of the last six years, when the
imports have been rapidly increasing, is only
$45,000,000. Should the importations for con-
sumption only decline to #75,000,000, which
would be equivalent to a gross importation of
$95,000,000, you would have but $40,000,000 on
which your revenue, under the existing tariff,
would be collected. Your revenue last year,
when this class of articles amounted to $64,000,000,
was $19,300,000. A consumption of $40,000,000
of dutiable articles would gire you a revenue of
little more than $12,500,000. What shall we
have under the compromise act when that takes
effect; when other articles are to be added to the
free list, besides those reductions that are pro-
posed at the present session? What will your
twenty per cent, duty then yield you? Sir,
before gentlemen talk of distributing our surplus,
they had better inquire how we are to defray the
expenses of our Government hereafter. Our
ordinary expenses are already estimated at
$17,500,000, and even these will continue to
advance as long as we have a surplus, without
taking into view the claims amounting to mil-
lions, not even to be estimated, for extraordinary
purposes, which are accumulating upon us; and
most of which are for indispensable purposes.
Where is the revenue hereafter to come from to
pay some twenty or twenty-five millions for all
our expenditures, *vifh all the economy ve can
exercise, ¡ruin public lanuc.
Sir, while I do not concur with the gentleman
from Tennessee, that the revenue from this source
will be reduced to a million in three years, yet
we all know that these speculations cannot be
carried on to any great extent under a heavy
pressure upon the money market. When the
supply of capital fails, and fail it will, your rev-
enue from public lands must suddenly decline,
but not quite so low as in former periods of pres-
sure and distress, owing to the internal improve-
ments of the West. One thing, however, is
certain, that whenever the spirit of speculation
is checked, your revenue from customs and pub-
lic lands will not both pay the annual ordinary
and extraordinary charges upon jour Treasury.
The same opinions were entertained in 1816 as
we now hear. They had $36,000,000 from cus-
toms in one year, and had a balance in the Treas-
ury of $22,000,000. In 1820 and 1821 we cur-
tailed our expenditures, and authorized loans to
the amount of $8,000,000. No wise financier will
tamper with a revenue depending, as ours does,
on the vicissitudes ef the natural, commercial,
and political world.
Without, Mr. Chairman, lp--:"g into view the
deficiency in our revenue which may exist here-
after, what is the present condition of our fu.^.'.^o
which authorizes us to distribute some twenty or
thirty millions of surplus revenue? I shall not,
sir, include in the estimate of our available means
the stock in the Bank of the United States. Of
that stock #619,000 belongs not to the Govern-
ment, but to the Navy pension fund. It is not
drawn from your Treasury, but from the pay of
your officers, seamen, and marines, to provide
pensions for invalids and for the widows and
orphans of those who may die in the service.
We can expect little justice from an institution
which would divide the premium on the stock
belonging to such a fund among the capitalists
of this and other countries. If the widows' and
orphans'fund is excluded from all partition in
the benefits of the new partnership, Government
has no reason to expect justice, unless through
the avenues of chancery. We shall want that
fund long before it will be received into the
Treasury. We had in the Treasury on the 1st

In speaking of the balance in the Treasury, I
concur with gentlemen that it is not necessary to
refer to unexpended appropriations; but we must
recollect that the money in the Treasury cannot
be twice appropriated, and that in alluding to a
surplus applicable to be distributed or applied to
other objects, we had in the Treasury on the 1st
of January last, but about seventeen million dol-
lars; the above statement being made from the

In the foregoing statement of extraordinary
appropriations and claims on the Treasury, noth-
ing is included for new fortifications, or for the
prospective increase of the Navy; for miscella-
neous claims and appropriations authorized by
Congress; for any addition to the Army, or to-
pographical corps; for the regiment of dragoons,
and the volunteer corps of ten thousand men;
nor is any sum estimated for the expense which
may soon become necessary on the frontier of
Texas. What all these may amount to it is not
possible now to estimate. It is not intended to
be understood that all these will be required for
the service of 1836. The statement is made to
show what are the probable charges against the
surplus on the 1st of January last, and the
amount which may be received into the Treasury
during the present year. It is impossible to
anticipate what may be the revenue for 1836.
Should the spirit of speculation continue unabated
till 18S7, the revenue of the present may exceed
that of the past year; but there are already symp-
toms of extreme pressure in various quarters of
the Union, and we hear of transfers of specie.
The existing expansion of commercial specula-
tion and credit is too great to authorize any ex-
pectation that the pressure for money will cease.
The trade and banks of the country have not
been kept in check for a year and a half as in
1834 Neither the Bank of the United States,
nor all the banks in the Union, can now afford
relief by extending their business as they did in
1834. There is, indeed, but one remedy for
an overtrading nation, and when that arrive ,
