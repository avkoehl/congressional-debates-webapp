Colonel DUNCAN:

If you are attacked, inform me as to the force and the direction from which the attack is made.

HINKS,

General.

CITY POINT, May 17, 1864-6 p.m.

Major-General BUTLER,

Commanding:

I have just arrived here with my command, men and horses much jaded. I destroyed Coalfield, Powhatan, and Chula Stations, on the Danville road, and tore up more or less of the track at those points. I burned Wilsons' Wellville, and Blacks and Whites Stations, on the South Side road, and tore up the track at the various points. The bridges were all strongly guarded, and the condition of the command did not justify an attack. Captain Shaffer is with me.

A. V. KAUTZ,

Brigadier-General.

NORFOLK, VA., May 17, 1864.

Captain EDSON,

Chief of Ordnance, Dept. of Virginia and North Carolina:

Our lines are threatened with an attack to-night. Please send immediately to-night by tug a supply of ammunition for the Henry repeating rifle for the First District of Columbia Cavalry. I will give all necessary receipts.

GEORGE F. SHEPLEY,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

PORTSMOUTH, May 17, 1864.

Captain JOHNSTON:

Will you have the North Carolina regiment in readiness to move over at any time? The outpost is in danger of attack. Also have a boat dispatched to Fort Monroe for the ammunition for the First District of Columbia Cavalry.

I. VOGDES,

Brigadier-General.

BOWERS' HILL, May 17, 1864.

Brigadier-General VOGDES:

I have just received information from the outpost at Bernard's Mill that there is a large force of Wren's rebel cavalry on the South Quay road. It is thought they will attack they post to-night or to-morrow; probably, to-night. Four rebel scouts came into Suffolk to-day, from whom this information was obtained by a man upon whom I think I can rely.

J. S. GATES,

Major, Commanding Outpost.
