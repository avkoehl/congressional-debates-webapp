SAINT LOUIS, September 2, 1864.

General FISK:

I do not like mounted men to hunt bushwhackers; they make too much noise, are too conspicuous, commit too many depredations, and are too helpless. With the mounted force you now have and infantry to move secretly, still-hunt, and surprise them you can drive the guerrillas from the State in three weeks. Without that all the infantry you have mounted would merely overrun the country and leave the guerrillas hidden to laugh as they passed by.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.

SAINT LOUIS, September 2, 1864.

General FISK:

A man named Gilstrap is reported to be in Howard and Randolph under the pretense of being a recruiting officer, committing depredations and abusing the people. Let Colonel Forbes investigate the case and put a stop to it.

By order of General Rosecrans:

EDW. McK. HUDSON,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.

SAINT JOSEPH, September 2, 1864.

Major-General ROSECRANS:

Will it be practicable for you to send 500 mounted and well-armed men to Jefferson City to cross this district for ten days' campaign against the guerrillas in Boone and Howard? If so, what time can they come to this side? I will make dispositions to concentrate all the force I can spare to co-operate with them. The bushwhackers are increasing daily in General Douglass' district. We must make an early and vigorous campaign against them if we can get the force.

CLINTON B. FISK,

Brigadier-General.

SAINT LOUIS, September 2, 1864.

Brigadier-General FISK,

Saint Joseph:

The general commanding asks why do you not let Catherwood take command of his regiment and send him down there to clear all that region of country? Something should be done down there.

FRANK S. BOND,

Major and Aide-de-Camp.

SAINT JOSEPH, September 2, 1864.

Major BOND,

Aide-de-Camp:

Catherwood is not in my district. He is now in Saint Louis recruiting. I have only a portion of his regiment, under Major King, in Clay
