GENERAL: I am directed by Major-General Holmes to say that the instructions given you in my letter of the 20th instant to report to the Adjutant and Inspector-General at Richmond are countermanded, and you will remain at Marshall until further orders. The charges preferred against you and sent to Brigadier-General Hebert on the 6th instant were sent to General Holmes from Richmond, with instructions from the President that he would cause them to be investigated. At the time these charges were forwarded to General Hebert General Holmes was not aware that you were his senior; he had therefore directed Major G. M. Bryan, assistant adjutant-general of this department, to put himself in possession of those charges, investigate them and report the result of such investigation direct to these headquarters.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
