officer to be prepared and to obstruct it as soon he learns of the enemy's approach. If it were down now it might impede the route of General Croxton, if forced to come that way, and endanger his command if pressed by the enemy.

I arrived here this morning with 200 men, whom I have distributed along the road. Shall send some more troops up road as guard as soon as I can get transportation. Will return to Decatur as soon as I can get a train.

DECATUR, ALA., November 2, 1864-12 m.

Major-General THOMAS:

My courier, just this moment in from Brown' Ferry, reports will quiet at that place. No sign of the enemy at Elk River Ford last night at dark. At that time the advance of the enemy had not reached Rogersville. I have received reports from up the river, where all is extremely vigilant. Enemy in small squads continually showing himself on south side, but returns often a few shots. I feel more anxiety at present for the railroad, and shall re-enforce the posts along the line. Our guides, scouts, and patrols are extremely vigilant, and I will give you early information of the approach of the enemy.
