CUMBERLAND, August 5, 1864-7.30 p. m.

Major-General HUNTER,

Monocacy:

I have just returned from New Creek. The enemy were severely punished and are retreating as rapidly as possible toward Moorefield. I think they will go up the South Fork and through Brock's Gap into the Shenandoah Valley at Harrisonburg. It was the intention, however, undoubtedly of McCausland and Johnson to have gone into West Virginia if they had not been repulsed here and at New Creek. No damage done to the railroad west of this, and very little east this side of Back Creek. Trains from the west will come in to-night, and in a day or two will run east to Hancock. No account of General Averell yet. I fear the enemy will get away before he reaches the South Branch Valley.

B. F. KELLEY,

Brigadier-General.

PITTSBURG, August 5, 1864-12.10 p. m.

(Received Cumberland 10.25 a. m. 6th.)

General KELLEY:

The success of your forces at Cumberland and New Creek is exceedingly gratifying to the people of this city. Three regiments of infantry and two of cavalry entered Hagerstown from Shepherdstown at 9.30 this morning. I have sent artillery and infantry to Uniontown.

D. N. COUCH,

Major-General.
