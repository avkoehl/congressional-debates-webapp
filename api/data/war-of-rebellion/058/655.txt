General FORREST, Como:

I am in want of mules. You will give orders to have as large a number as possible pressed out of the swamp and sent back into the interior so as not to oppress the people. If the enemy should press you back, take all the horses before you that would fall into his hands.

L. POLK,

Lieutenant-General.

MERIDIAN, February 2, 1864.

General LORING, Canton:

The rifles from General Lee will not go to you. The ordnance officer ships to you to-day the 300 guns and ammunition for them; also the 34,000 rounds of extra ammunition. How many horses do you require for your batteries?

L. POLK,

Lieutenant-General.

MERIDIAN, February 2, 1864.

Major-General MAURY, Mobile:

I find a force of the enemy threatening me from Vicksburg. Is the state of things in front of Mobile such as to authorize my drawing from there two brigades, the Missouri and another, to meet the impending pressure in front of Jackson, so as to return in time before an attack on Mobilee would be made? Answer.

L. POLK,

Lieutenant-General.

MERIDIAN, February 2, 1864.

General MAURY, Mobile:

Send up the Missouri and another brigade with their batteries and transportation immediately. I will be in Mobile by the Wednesday morning train.

L. POLK,

Lieutenant-General.

Honorable JAMES A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War, Richmond, Va.:

MY DEAR SIR: I cannot procure evidence of an intention on the part of the enemy to attack Mobile. It may be that his fleets will run past the outer forts and occupy the waters of the bay, but I cannot learn of adequate preparation for a land expedition. I think 40,000 troops and three months' time should be devoted by the enemy to the enterprise if he expects success. My latest information from New Orleans is dated January 19, and contradicts the reports
