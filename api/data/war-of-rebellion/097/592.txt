Honorable E. M. STANTON,

The New York East Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church now in session in this city, have adopted resolutions of congratulation to the Government on the recent victories won under the blessing of God by our noble army. This conference was the first ecclesiastical body in the United States, after the fall of Sumter, to declare its loyalty to the flag, and its purpose to aid the Government in its effort to subdue the rebellion and maintain the national life. The conference also appointed if consistent with the arrangements of the Government, Rev. Daniel Curry, D. D., Rev. G. R. Crooks, D. D., and Honorable M. F. Odell, a delegation to represent it at Charleston and Sumter, on the 14th instant, and to take such part in the services of the occasion as the authorities may appoint.

E. R. AMES,

President.

G. W. WOODRUFF,

Secretary.
