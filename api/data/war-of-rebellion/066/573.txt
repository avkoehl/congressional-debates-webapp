Brigadier General WILLIAM B. TALIAFERRO,

Royall's House:

What is result of fire so far this morning? Robertson attacked at daylight, and when last heard from was driving him at all points. From your position can you discover anything going on on John's Island?

Major-General.

CHARLESTON, S. C., July 9, 1864.

Colonel ALFRED RHETT,

Commanding West Lines, via Royall's House:

Can the officer commanding at Fort Pringle discover anything by the firing on John's Island as to the position of the enemy there? They are behind intrenchments, judging from the direction of the sound. Do they seem to be southeast or south west from Pringle? Be careful not be expend your ammunition, especially for heavy guns, to no effect by firing at such long range that little effect can be done.

SAM. JONES,

Major-General.

CHARLESTON, S. C., July 9, `864.

Brigadier General WILLIAM B. TALIAFERRO,

Royall's House, James Island:

Brigadier-General Robertson's command is on the other side of the Stono, a little north of west from Pringle. he is in front of Gervais', near Burden's Causeway, the enemy close in his front their first line this morning, losing about 120 men killed and wounded. I send to you 30 men of engineer company from Savannah, under a lieutenant; the captain will be on with remainder of company to-morrow. Keep sharp lookout for enemy to-night; they may cross over against you from John's Island. I telegraphed Colonel Rhett instead of you because you told me you had gone to take some rest, which I knew you very much needed, and did not want to disturb you unnecessarily.

SAM. JONES,

Major-General.
