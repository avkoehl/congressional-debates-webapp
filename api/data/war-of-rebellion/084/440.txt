Major-General ROSECRANS:

I have moved my headquarters to this place by order of General Fisk. But twenty soldiers here and the town threatened with guerrillas constantly. I would like to have at least one company of soldiers. Can I have them?

Brigadier-General.

SAINT LOUIS, MO., July 28, 1864.

General DOUGLASS,

Mexico, Mo.:

The general commanding is in receipt of reliable information that Perkins' band of guerrillas is in the vicinity of Glasgow, also Holtzclaw's band. The First Iowa Cavalry is en route to you, if not already arrived. There are now at Glasgow seventy-five dismounted men of the Seventeenth Illinois Cavalry. The general commanding is of the opinion that with the First Iowa and battalion of the Third Missouri State Militia in your section you can spare a force sufficient to drive off these bands from vicinity of Glasgow.

Brigadier-General.

P. S.-Since the general wrote this he has got track of Anderson.
