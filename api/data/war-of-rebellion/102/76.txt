commanders have also been instructed to bring along horses, arms, and equipments for the men now at work on the fortifications here, as they will be relieved to go along. The colonel desires that you report here to go along also, and be sure and bring Rebstein along, as the colonel wants him to act as adjutant. The colonel will take command of the whole command, and proceed out west to intercept Stand Watie's command, which is reported as moving toward Kansas.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WM. H. HEWETT,

First Lieutenant and Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE MISSOURI,April 11, 1865 - 11 a. m.

Brigadier General P. E. CONNOR, Denver:

One more Regiment of infantry, and perhaps two, will be sent you.

G. M. DODGE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSOURI,Saint Louis, April 11, 1865 - 3. 10 p. m.

Governor LEWIS,

Madison, Wis.:

Please send the field and company officers of the regiments you have sent and are sending here. There are no field officers, and not enough company officers even to take care of the men. All the officers are greatly needed here.

JOHN POPE,

Major-General.

WASHINGTON, D. C., April 12, 1865 - 11 a. m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT,

Via City Point:

The new regiments sent to General Hancock since March 9 number 17,500 men. This is in addition to the First Veteran Corps, which has about five full regiments. Shall I continue to send him other new regiments nearly ready at the North? Considering General Pope's apprehensions of an advance of Kirby Smith, would it not be well to send to Arkansas all new regiments raised in the West? Over 6,000 cavalry horses have been sent to General Canby between October 20 and March 31. As General Reynolds is very destitute of horses would it not now be well to supply him?

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.

CITY POINT, VA., April 12, 1865 - 1 p. m.

(Received 3 p. m.)

Major-General HALLECK, Chief of Staff:

I thought of sending General Pope a full corps of Ord's troops. You may send him all the cavalry horses from the West until he is supplied. I shall be in Washington to-morrow.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
