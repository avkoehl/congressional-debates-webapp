forward to Stevenson. You will take charge of the whole line of roads as soon as you get a train through. Every soldier must be relieved by hired hands. Put your whole force to repairing the McMinnville road at once. A regiment from Tullahoma will protect them. How long will it take?

D. C. BUELL.
HEADQUARTERS, Huntsville, July 12, 1862.

Colonel SWORDS, Louisville:

Forward as much forage as you can get boats for by the way of Green River and the Cumberland. You can ship to Clarksville, thence by rail to Nashville for some time after the river fails above Clarksville. Hire hands to load and unload at Clarksville and Bowling Green. Increase your wagon transportation by 300 wagons at least for service in the interior.

D. C. BUELL.

Mr. J. B. ANDERSON, Nashville:

It is reported that the road to Stevenson will be finished to-day. Send a train through to-morrow with rations and forage and push supplies through to Stevenson with all the rapidity possible. Nothing more will be required on Decatur road until it is furnished, unless it be forage for the animals now on that road, and that will be called for by Colonel McCook or his quartermaster.
