Public Lands—Mr. Harrison.
Ho. of Reps.
tion shall be construedto affect ike claim of the United States
to vacant lands ceded to them by the late treaty of peace "
This was withdrawn,and thefollowmg offered-
" Nothing m thtb fon«titution shall be construed to alter
the claim  of the United States or of the individu il Sutes to
the western terntoiy, but all such claims may be examined
into and decided upon by the Supreme Courtof the United
btates "
This, on motion, was postponed, and the fol-
lowing presented and adopted, and which now
constitutes the third section of the fourth atticie
of the Constitution:
"The Legi--latiiie shall have power to eh«posc of and
make all needttil rute  and regulation  respecting the tern
toiy or other piopeitv belonging to the United state  and
nothing in tins Con utution contained Mnll be soconstrueel
us to piejiiciice any clum-, eitlieroi the United sutes orof
any particular State "
Now, sir, I would ask why all these various
E repositions, commencing with one that wis
road enough to include beyond any doubt the
power now contended for, H it had been the in-
tention and object of the convention to give such
a power to the General Government? Can any
othei meaning be given to the third section as it
now stands, by any i ule or principle of fair con-
struction, than what has been given it by the
supieme couit of the State of New Yoik, that it
meant only such vacant terntoiy of the United
States as was " beyond the limits oi boundai íes of
theteveial States'1" None, none, sn, can be given
The constiuction of that com tc in not be success-
fully met, and the whole piocecdings of the con-
vention which I have ¡ustlead lead mesistibiy
to the conclusion that the powei claimed was not
given, and nevei wag intended to be given, to the
Geneial Government 1 he proceedings in the
ronvt ntion that formed the Constitution beat a
stnking lescmblance to the proceedings of Con-
giess on the objections of Rhode Island and New
Jeisey to the ninth aiticle of the Confedei ttion
Both cleaily show that the inter tion of giving
such a powei to the Geneial Government is the
one now set up nevei was enteitamed, nay,
more, so fai fiom entertaining it, tluit they ac-
tually rejteted, in both instances, the vciy pi op
ositions which were brought forwaid to confei
the power
But toshow.fuithei, thatthe Constitution paid
no legaid to the oidinance, it is only necessaiy
to show that the oidinance is in ducct opposition
to the Constitution \ ou will íecollect, Mi
Speaker, that I lefencd, in the coutse of my lc-
mailcs, to the fourth aiticle of tin oidinince,
with the view ut showing the paiticulai mode by
which taxes, going into the e ommon Vic isuiy,
were to be collected fiom the new States th i'
might bo founed out of this new t nitoiy Tl is
mode is ident cal with that ment om d in the
Confederation The new States, by tho fouith
article of this " unalleiable" compact, wiie to
pay (axes accoidingto the propoitio ) mentioned
in the Coniedeiation Now, if the Constitution
did not altei this compact, which was " dnaltei-
able," this is still the mode, and the only mode,
by which you can collect taxes fiom the new
States There is none othei, because the Oon
stitution not affecting this compact, which was
oidamed to be " unalterable," thi5 compact is
still binding upon the countiy, in all its parts
and piovisions, as the paramount law of the
land If this view of the subject be coirect,
then, even supposing the compact, otherwise
consideied, to be binding upon us,I contend that
it is void, because the Government has fnled to
comply with the solemn engagements which de-
volved upon it by the provisions of this fourth
article But, sir, can we really suppose that the
framers of the Constitution would have peimit-
ted such a discrepany to exist on the subject of
collecting its taxes as that found in this aiticle,
and that which now exis's under the Constitu
tion We ha^e still fui the i evidence in that
clause of the Constitution which gives to the
Government the powei of holding land within
the limits of a btate, with its consent, for certain
pui poses, such as aisenals, dcck-yaids,etc , that
). was not the intention of the fiameis of the
Constitution that fuithei powei than is thcie
expiessed and confened should bo exercised by
the Oovnnmeiii o u the tenitoiy of i Stile
I oi can it be supposed, w 11 any one allege, th„t
they were so neglectful of then duties, so forget-
ful of the interests of their country, and so un-
mindful of the powers necessary to be granted,
if they intended to claim and exercise the right
to the soil lying within the limits of a State, as
to omit to give, in express terms, the specific
power which is now set up by implication?
Upon the supposition that the lands within the
new States belong to the General Government, I
desne to know whether, being the property of the
Government, the Government has "exclusive
]misdiction"over them or not' And if not, why'
The land, according to the doctnne of the day,
is as much the piopeity of the Government as
though the Government had acquired it under tho
paiticuKi section in the Constitution which gives
to the Government the powei of holding lands
within the limits of a State, with the consent of
said State, foi some one or other of the specific
pui poses enumeialed in the particular section to
which I allude And why not, theiefore, exei-
cise "exclusive juusdiction?" If tlie power is
not given to exercise "exclusive juusdiction,"
why not exeicise "jurisdiction" under the third
section of the fourth article' If you have a right
to the lands according to the Constitution—and
I deny that you can get it any other way—why
not exercise " jurisdiction '" As a test upon this
point, I would pa> ticularly call the attention of
State lights men to the views which I am now sub-
mitting The Geneial Government lias the right—■
which, so far as I know, has nevet been doubted
—of constiuctmg woiks of internal nnpiovement
within the Distnct of Columbia Why' Because
the rovvet to do so is expiesshi given So, also,
h is the Government the powc i tc constmct anel
cuiy on such vvoiks in the T< intones Why'
Beciuse the luid within the Teintones is the
absolute and undoubted piopeity of the Unite d
Stuts, and, by the thud section of the fouith
amele, the Congiess of the United States has
powei to dispose of, and make all needful rules
ind legulations losptcting, the tenitoiy oi othei
piopeity of the United States
Now, as the Genet il Government can exeicise
the powei of consti acting works of internal nn
piovemf nt within the Distnct of Colombia, Í
wish to know of those gentl men who believe that
the Geneial Government ha< no powe i to con
stiuct such woiks uithin the limite ot a State,
win tlu i the Government, being theounei of the
Ian Is, his oi cm cv icise such a powei within
those nt w Si u< s v\ In te the lauds belong to ti e
Govi i timent' If it c \n, then the Constitution is
one thing with tlu old Si ites, which cvnnot be
extoi ded oi (iilaig d, md inothei thing with the
lien St U( s, th it in íy h sti tt lied like a piei e ot
gum el tstu B it, ii no such powei can be c\< i
cised within thos States vvlicic tin lands bchng
to theGt in i il Government, I e ill upon those ge n
tlemen to mfnm me why it cannot be done
Within the I e intones of the United States,
wlieie tne lands aie the piopeity of the Genoril
Gov uimi nt, such i powei e in be exi lei eel But
the Sends lv. mg within the limits of the new Sttile3
belong, aloO, to the Government, and I ask why
is. it that this same power cmnot be equally ev
eici ed m eilhei ca , since in both the Govein
ment has the exclusive propeity to the soil' The
nght to the soil is no moie limited in the one ease
than in the othei But the right of the Govern-
ment to exercise juusdiction and its legislative
poweis is not equally great in both instances
Why? Where is the prohibitoiy clause in the
Constitution that foi bids if Do not gentlemen
see the force of the position, and the application
of the aigument? I leave the point foi them to
settle
Before leaving this branch of the subject, I
must call your attention to another striking cn-
cumstance in the history of these compacts It
is a lemaikable fact, thdt Virginia herself has
given, in practice, ai interpretation to the com-
pact, which sustains tne position I have assumed
By the teims ot the compact, a certain triet of
country lying within the limits of the present
State of Kentucky, between Giecn uvci and the
Tennessee uvcr, v/cie specifically set apait foi
the Vnginia Hoops unon the Continental estab
hshment, and in case the quantity should piove
insufficient, the deficiency was to be mide un
'• in good lands, to be laid off between the livers
Sciota and Little Miami "   The lands lying be-
tween Green river and the Tennessee river were
not applied agieeably to the terms of the com-
pact. Virginia, in giving her assent to Kentucky
becoming a State of the Union, permitted Ken-
tucky to use and appropriate these lands as her
own. Kentucky has sold these lands, and ap-
plied the proceeds to her own benefit What
right had Virginia, directly or indirectly, to per-
mit the State of Kentucky to claim and sell these
lands for her own benefit, if it be tiue that the
compact is binding, and the lands ceded under
the compact are the common property of the Uni-
ted States, and aie to be disposed of foi their
benefit alone ? It may be replied that these lands
were not ceded. Giantit Butif the lands ceded
were ceded for the common benefit of all the
States, Kentucky having claimed as her own the
lands lying between the Gieen river and the Ten-
nessee river, how could " the deficiency "be made
up without mtienchmg upon those that were
ceded for the common benefit of all ? The lands
which lay between the Sciota and the Little
Adiami were not to be touched until those m Ken-
tucky had been exhausted. And as those in
Kentucky were not applied in the way contem-
plated by the compact, it is impossible that the
lands lying between the Sciota and the Little
Miami could be sufficient to make up the defici-
ency, without taking moie than was originally
expected under the compact, and the common-fund
had, of course, to be taken to supply the defi-
ciency Why did Vnginia permit this5 For
what icason did she peimit Kentucky to claim
and dispose of, for hei own benefit, those lands)
that wiie specifically set apart to pay her own
soldicis on the Continental establ shment? She
could have done it upon no othei giound than
th it the 1 mds, upon the admission of a State, in-
cluded within the limits of that State, became
absolutely the piopcrty of the State, oi that the
compact did not beai,and was nevei meant to
beai,the eoustiuetion which more recent times
have given it
But, sn , it may be said that my arguments and
leasoning apply only to the States made in the
Northwestern IViiitoiy, and not to those em-
biaced within the limits of the teintoiy acquired
fiom Fiance I pioceed to give a passing notice
to this point
By the thud article of the treaty between Fiance
and the United States it is provided that
" 1 tie inhabitants of the ceded territory shall be ineor-
poi ned in the  Union of The I mtcd State*  anei admirte d as
) >n   i'.pKMble  aece rding to the principle  ot the Federal
( onstitiition to the enjoy inentof ill the rutins, advantages,
ami immunities, ot citi/e ns ol the United btates "
Ilcie, sn, you find an expiess provision forthe
inhabitants of the ceded terntoiy to be mcoipo-
íated in the Union, according to the principles of
the 1 edcial Constitution,and nowheie any power
given to impose conditions oí íestnctions The
ch irtei of the ir rights was as bioad as the pun-
eiplcs of the Bedeii 1 Constitution, and theie were
no compacts or ordinances to cramp their energies
and entangle them in the mazes of political ab-
suidity
But, sir, let me as! ,and I ask the question em-
phat cdlly, why impose conditions and restric-
tions upon the new States ? Where is the neces-
sity ? Foi what íeason aie they to come into the
Union fettered and handcuffed ' The very act of
imposing these conditions and restuctions is an
aeknovvledBtnent of their soveieignty, and that,
by virtue of their sovereign rights, they would
othcrv lse be entitled, indisputably, to the light to
the soil without them If, then, without these
restnctions, they would be free and soveieign, the
question natuially occuis, to what txtentfree and
sovereign? Beyond that of the old States' Im-
possible It is forbidden by the Constitution
Less so than the old States ' Neithei can this be
The Constitution is the equal guarantee in both
cases What, then, would be the real extent of
then fiecdom and sovereignty'    Why, sir, that
