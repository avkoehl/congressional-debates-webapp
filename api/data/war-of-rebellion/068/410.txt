General HUMPHREYS,

Your dispatch of 2.15 p.m. has just been received. General Getty, in conjunction with two of my divisions, will make an attack soon as troops can get in position. I shall keep one division on their left and keep one division in reserve in rear of advancing divisions. The objective point is Parker's Store.

The commanding general directs that Getty attack at once, and that you support him with your whole corps, one division on his right and one division on his left, the others in reserve; or such other disposition as you may think proper, but the attack up the plank road must be made at once.
