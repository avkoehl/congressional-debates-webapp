much opposition, and is pushing on to the ridge beyond. I propose to get a strong point on the ridge and hold it to-night, so as to control the Sandtown road if practicable.

Major-General.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,Near Kenesaw Mountain, June 26, 1864.

Major-General SCHOFIELD:

All right. Be careful of a brigade so exposed, but I am willing to risk a good deal.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE OHIO,June 26, 1864.

Major-General SHERMAN:

I will be careful. The move is dangerous, but think the result will be well worth the risk. I will put the brigade in a good position by dark, and intrench it well, then re-enforce it by another brigade after dark, so that if the enemy come for it he will find more than he expected.

Major-General SHERMAN:

Cox has just returned; Colonel Byrd's brigade is across Olley's Creek on a ridge about 600 yards this side of the main ridge, in a good position, with open ground in his front. He is from half a mile to a mile this side of the Sandtown road. His skirmishers went on to the wooded slope of the main ridge and me pretty strong resistance, but he thinks from dismounted cavalry only. The creek is quite deep, and in many places swampy and impassable, especially below the Sandtown road.

Major-General SCHOFIELD:

Good bridge should be made to-night across Olley's Creek where the brigade is across, and operations resumed there in the morning early.

Major-General, Commanding.

Major-General SHERMAN:

I have ordered the bridges to be built and will be all ready to begin again in the morning. At what hour shall Hascall begin?

Major-General.
