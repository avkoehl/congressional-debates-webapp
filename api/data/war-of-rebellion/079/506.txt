DECATUR, ALA., October 29, 1864.

Major-General THOMAS:

I have made every exertion to find cavalry, but can find none to send out on a reconnaissance. My cavalry has all been patrolling the river for forty-eight hours. I am, however, pushing out the flanks. I can discover from the roof of my headquarters a thin line of rebels about three miles long.

R. S. GRANGER,

Brigadier-General.

DECATUR, ALA., October 29, 1864-9. 45 p. m.

Major-General THOMAS:

Your telegram* of 7. 40 this p. m. is just received. I do not think that it is Hood's force is attempting to cross at Florence; it must be Forrest or Taylor, or both. We made 2 prisoners about dusk from Eighth Arkansas Infantry. There is still some force of the infantry and cavalry in our front. Their train and artillery certainly left here between 1 and 4 o'clock this morning, passing around to my right, I suppose to take the Courtland road. I am confirmed in this by my pickets four miles down the river, who report they could hear the passing of the trains just before day on the Courtland road. I have 1,000 men, outside of my pickets, on the Courtland road, sent there at 8 o'clock this evening, who will give me more positive information in the morning, and I hope will make some prisoners. Hood's advance could scarcely have gotten so far down as below Florence, FIFTY miles below here, at the time the enemy was reported there. I would like to know when General Stanley will be at Athens, and how he is to arrive there. There are no rations at Athens to supply him, as I did not expect him there. If he depends upon me for supplies I hope the general commanding will let me know, that I may have them sent forward at the earliest moment. I have no idea what his force is, but have scarcely provided for his force and my own for ten days; think I can get it up from Huntsville, except salt meat.

R. S. GRANGER,

Brigadier-General.

HUNTSVILLE, October 29, 1864.

Major General GEORGE H. THOMAS:

Your dispatch of last evening directing me to express to Captain Morton your thanks for ability displayed and for correct information furnished you is received and executed. It is but just, however, to state that the captain gets the most of his information from a corps of citizen scouts organized by me under orders from General Granger, and who report to me, some of whom I keep constantly south of the river. Of course their reports reach the naval officer before reaching here, and are very properly forwarded by him. I am waiting the arrival of the One hundred and eighty- first Ohio Volunteer Infantry to take a part of it, with a section of artillery from Larkinsville, to Gunter's Landing and Fort Deposit.

W. P. LYON,

Colonel 13th Wisconsin, Commanding Memphis and Charleston R. R. Defenses.
