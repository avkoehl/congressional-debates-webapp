SIR: The Department has received your letter of the 24th instant, calling attention to the rebel ram building in Roanoke River, and suggesting measures to provide against disaster from it, and has transmitted a copy of it to Rear-Admiral Porter.

Very respectfully, &amp;c.,

Lieutenant-General GRANT,

City Point:

The order placing Pope in general command in the West, and putting Kansas under General Dodge, has just been issued and telegraphed to General Pope. The Legislature of Kansas has passed resolutions asking that more troops be sent to that State. They will be sent to you by mail. Troops from the West arrive slowly. General Meagher's division is ordered to embark at Annapolis. It will be slow works, as the transports must be coaled and provisioned by lighters. The weather is rapidly moderating, and an effort will be made to-morrow to make a channel for the transports at Alexandria.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.

CITY POINT, VA., January 31, 1865.
