General J. E. JOHNSTON:

Provisions cannot be spared by the commissary. The president of Demopolis railroad can buy reasonable supplies for those in employ as laborers and otherwise, and they will be under the law exempt from impressment.

See General Orders, Numbers 31.

Colonel B. S. EWELL,

Meridian:

Have you acted on proposition to blockade Yazoo River? I can raise steamer Arcadia and obtain forage, which is getting very scarce here, if protected by blockade.

Brigadier-General.

OFFICE CHIEF COMMISSARY OF FIRST DISTRICT, Grenada, Miss., November 6, 1863.

Major W. H. DAMERON,

Chief Commissary of Mississippi, Meridian:

MAJOR: My agents from the border counties bordering on the Tennessee line and Mississippi River make complaint that they find it very difficult to purchase stores with Confederate money, and those who would take our funds fear being informed upon by their neighbors and negroes. They represent large amount of stores in said counties which they could get out with the assistance of a few troops. Could it be so arranged that some 10 or 12 of our cavalry could be ordered to each of the agents in each of the border counties to assist in impressing the stores? I think it very important that all the stores that can possibly be moved from that section of the State should be moved before the rainy season sets in, which will be shortly.

Respectfully, yours,

JOHN S. MELLON,

Chief Commissary of First District.
