have been his opinion of open and honorable war, brigandage and assassination here meet only with feelings of abhorrence and universal execration, and their authors and actors with sentiments of utter and unrelenting hostility. While the efforts of the troops shall be directed to the protection of the people, and every possible means tending to this end be adopted, yet in a case of this kind it behooves every man to rise and become an open, active, uncompromising enemy to all who would continue to foment discords and dissensions, either by imprecations on our country, our laws, our magistrates, and our flag, but more especially upon those who, by dastardly and devilish deeds of violence, disgrace the age in which we live, render opprobrious the name American, of which we have been so proud, and make us the byword and reproach of the whole civilized world.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JAMES H. CARLETON,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSOURI,May 10, 1865.

Major-General CURTIS,

Milwaukee, Wis.:

General Sibley had best send communication to the Sioux Indians at Devil's Lake, informing them that they can have peace by stopping hostilities against the whites. That while they keep peace the U. S. forces will not molest them, but that unless they immediately signify their purpose to keep peace hereafter, the Government will send a large force to Devil's Lake this summer and establish a large military post there, and will continue to establish military posts all over this country and destroy or drive off all their game. By keeping the peace they will avoid that. No other treaty is needed or will be made.

JOHN POPE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSOURI,May 10, 1865.

Major-General CURTIS,

Milwaukee, Wis.:

The line of posts along the frontier settlements of Dakota and Iowa were located by my order, and I do not wish their location changed. If another or two is needed to connect them with the Minnesota line of posts please have them established, but without changing those already ordered to be established by General Sully. Sully ought not to be detained a moment longer than is necessary.

JOHN POPE,

Major-General.

SAINT PAUL, MINN., May 10, 1865.

Captain JOS. McC. BELL,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

Order for muster out of patients being carried out. Band of Indians trying to escape after skirmish near Mankato; several sutlers and one soldier killed. Our troops hope to overtake Indians again.

S. R. CURTIS,

Major-General.
