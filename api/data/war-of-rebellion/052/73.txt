JNumbers G. PARKE,

Major-General.

NEWPORT, R. I., August 19, 1863.

Major General U. S. GRANT,

Commanding Department of the Tennessee:

GENERAL: The President extended my leave of absence to the 1st day of October next, on the condition that I would inform you of the fact, and if you desired me to report for duty sooner than that date I should do so immediately. I am, therefore, waiting orders. If any movement is to be made by the corps to which I belong before that time, I shall be very glad to be informed of it, as I do not desire to be absent under such circumstances. My understanding, however, from General Sherman, was that no movement would probably be made prior to that time. I feel, therefore, like availing myself of the President's kindness, if it meets with yours and General Sherman's approbation.

General, allow me to observe to you that the entire people of the loyal States are filled with admiration and gratitude to you and your army for the glorious achievements of your arms. Among the best and most intelligent people especially does this feeling predominate. This recognition by our loyal countrymen of the great services you have rendered is especially gratifying to your friends and to no one more than to your friend and servant,

Respectfully,

FRANK P. BLAIR, JR.

P. S.-Any communication addressed to me will reach me at St. Louis, Mo.
