
are now well advanced toward completion. In two days more, if the troops do their duty, they will be finished.

Late in the evening of the 7th, just as I had finished laying out the last line, to which I thought it necessary to give my special attention, the withdrawing of General Kearny's right, so as to form a proper connection with General Franklin, the general-in-chief sent for me to meet him on the steamer Metamora. He wished me to make a more minute examination of the opposite shore with a view of occupying it. This I did on Tuesday, the 8th, and reported to him that I considered the most dangerous point for our flotilla to be the wooded shore on the opposite bank, just above Mr. Cole's house, nearly opposite the mouth of Herring Creek.

Wednesday and Thursday, the 9th and 10th, overcome by the great heat and my previous exertions and anxiety about our situation, I was warned to seek rest.

Friday, the 11th, I rode over the whole line, but as it was raining, the troops were doing but little.

All of which is respectfully submitted.
