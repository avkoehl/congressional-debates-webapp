ATLEE'S STATION, May 20, 1864.

General BRAGG,

Richmond, Va.:

A portion of the enemy's cavalry after reaching Old Church yesterday turned back in the direction of Tunstall's Station. They appear to be examining the ferries on the Pamunkey. Unless Colonel Bradley Johnson has information which will want the attention of the infantry at Hanover Junction, they will be ordered to go on the General Lee. I have the roads picketed between Old Church and Hanover Court-House now. I will ascertain soon where the main force of the enemy are. There is no grazing here. Can't corn be sent up to me for 400 or 500 animals? I have pickets still at Cold Harbor.

FITZ. LEE,

Major-General.

ATLEE'S, May 20, 1864--6 p. m.

General BRAGG:

The enemy's cavalry are approaching Mechanicsville in force from the direction of Cold Harbor. I am sending a force to meet them at Ellerson's Mill. The defenses near Mechanicsville had better be strengthened.

FITZ. LEE,

Major-General.

RICHMOND, VA., May 21, 1864.

General R. E. LEE,

Spotsylvania Court-House:

Your telegram of yesterday received. My letter should reach you to-day, in which you will find my views on question presented. I wish your judgment to be freely exercised.

HANCOCK'S HOUSE, May 21, 1864.

(Via Chester.)

General B. BRAGG,

Richmond, Va.:

One or two major-generals are indispensable to this army. General Hill will be relieved to-day, when I shall remain with one only. Generals Johnson and Colquitt would suit well. May I request prompt action.

G. T. BEAUREGARD.

PEAKE'S, CENTRAL RAILROAD, May 21, 1864--5 a. m.

General BRAGG,

Richmond, Va.:

Enemy's advance up the Pamunkey proved not to be their main column, but a raiding party, about a brigade; probably an offshoot. After burning a tank and the trestle bridge over creek near Hanover Court-House they returned down the Pamunkey. Please send party
