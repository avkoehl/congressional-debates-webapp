Communicate freely with Prentiss. If he does not need Wyman, you can take him. Telegraph to General Pope, at Alton, to give you a regiment; and to Hurlbut, at Quincy, to give you another.

Do not lose sight of importance of Cairo, and of its operations in Southeastern Missouri. Write to me fully.

SAINT LOUIS ARSENAL, July 5, 1861.

General THOMAS,

Adjutant-General, Washington:

General Lyon is moving down from Booneville toward Springfield, Greene County, Missouri, with 2,400 troops. Major Sturgis is on the way from Fort Leavenworth with 2,200. There are 3,500 on the Southwest Branch of Pacific Railroad and the line thence to Mount Vernon, beyond Springfield. In a day or two another regiment will be moved down. There is a depot for supplies at Rolla, the terminus of the Southwest Branch; another must be established at Springfield. All the supplies for, say, 10,000 troops must take that direction. From Rolla on for 60 miles the country is mountainous and barren. Teams have to take their own forage. It is absolutely necessary that a large amount of wagon transportation should be immediately provided. Will you see that the necessary orders are given by the Quartermaster-General, by telegraph, to Major McKinstry, early in the morning?

General Lyon urges that regular quartermasters and commissaries be sent him at once.
