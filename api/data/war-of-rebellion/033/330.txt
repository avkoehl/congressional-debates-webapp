Colonel, Commanding Post.

SAINT LOUIS, MO., June 19, 1863.

Colonel EDWARDS, Springfield:

Where is Colonel Cloud? When did you get the information contained in your dispatch, and from what source? Is it perfectly reliable?

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.

SPRINGFIELD, MO., June 20, 1863.

Major-General SCHOFIELD:

Colonel Cloud, I presume, is on his way here from Saint Louis. Mr. C. C. Jones, of this county, left Jacksonport on the 9th instant, who is vouched for by General Holland and Colonel Shepard as entirely reliable. He also fell in company with six prominent rebels of this place, who are, doubtless, in this vicinity, who left General Price about the same time. The news in relation to Stand Watie and Coffee I have derived from Colonel Allen, stationed at Mount Vernon, and Lieutenant Kelso, just in from Newtonia.

Very respectfully, yours,

JNO. EDWARDS,

Colonel, Commanding Post.

SAINT LOUIS, MO., June 20, 1863.

The PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:

The action of the Missouri State Convention upon the question of emancipation will depend very much upon whether they can be assured that their action will be sustained by the General Government, and the people protected in their slave property during the short time that slavery is permitted to exist. Am I authorized in any manner, directly or indirectly, to pledge such support and protection? This question is of such vital importance to the peace of Missouri that I deem it my duty to lay it before Your Excellency.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.

SAINT LOUIS, MO., June 20, 1863.

Brigadier-General DAVIDSON, Arcadia:

Can you send a company of cavalry into Washington County, to assist the provost-marshal at Potosi? It is much needed. The county is full of robbers, and is a thoroughfare for rebel recruits from Illinois.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.
