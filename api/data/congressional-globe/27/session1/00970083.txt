derate as it possibly can be He says this as the
Secretary of the Treasury in office Did he tell it

people heard of nothing but \t aste, extravagance,
deficits and debt
Here Mr Calhoun entered into a minute mves
tigation cf the appropriations and disbursement? of
1838 and 1839, and referred to the misstatements
which had been spread before the people on the
Presidential election ] After pledging themselves
to the people m promises of reform, the gentlemen
now turn round aDd say there is no room
for retrenchment —that it was all delusion
What is this but another evidence of the truth
of the saying of the old Roman Consul of the dit
ference in the conduct of candidates before and
after obtaining office'
Is not this not only an evidence of corrup
lion of Hiouve, bat an evidence of corruption in
•he measure^ based upon it? He (Mr. Calhoun)
held that promises made before elections ought to
be regarded as sacred after tt.ey have earned their
object, as they were believed to be oy tho e who
repo«ed confidence in them Because, if this con-
fidence be abused, there can be no faith in tbe
measures of such public menas disregard their pro-
mises
The Senator from Maine, if rightly understood,
said there was no room for economy He said he
was for acUon, not ío> di cus n—he was op-
posed to abstractions No doubt he and his friends
were opposed to abst action tit) s ood between
them and in°u object Tbe aostractions of the
Constiution interposed a earner to the measures
ol enormity which they propo ed Bonaparte de-
tested ab&tractions when he gra-ped the supreme
power, as did Cromv ell Every public plunderer
cries out again t abstractions, and ihe highvay

had abandoned the whole proposition The com-

commendation to distribute rune millions among
the States when we aie called here with the pro-
fessed object of relieving our own necessities
The 'hirtv one millions of national deist wh.ch the
Secretary had conjured up, is admitted on all hands
to be a mere -hantom. He thought there had

six questions to propound to him, arising from the
