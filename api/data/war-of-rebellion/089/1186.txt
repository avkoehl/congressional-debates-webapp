degree of certainty any advance of the enemy against Richmond. With my present force and long line, the safety of my position must, in a great measure, depend upon chance.

J. LONGSTREET,

Lieutenant-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIRST ARMY CORPS,October 31, 1864.

Brigadier General E. P. ALEXANDER, Commanding Artillery:

The lieutenant-general commanding is extremely desirous of covering with the fire of artillery the crossing of White oak Swamp, where the enemy will most likely attempt another passage. He crossed in the last effort he made at Mrs. Hobson's, and if that point could be brought under the fire of some of your long range guns, it would greatly add to the security of the position. General Longstreet desires, therefore, that you will put in the works, at the nearest or most favorable point, all the long-range guns you can bring to bear on the crossing referred to. Please let me know what you will be able to do in the matter.
