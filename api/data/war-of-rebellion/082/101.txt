HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,July 9, 1864.

General S. WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

I have 1,600 privates, with a proportionate number of non-commissioned and commissioned officers, on fatigue at the redoubts under Captain Mendell. The details are made from my reserve brigades, which extended my line previously. To make the same extension will require the details to be relieved. If General Wright's picket-line is to be relieved to-night it will be a difficult operation. If it is to be done I would like to know how many men he has on.

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,July 9, 1864.

Major-General HANCOCK:

The Sixth Corps is ordered to move at once, and their pickets must therefore be relieved with as little delay as practicable. The commanding general directs that you confer with Major-General Wright by telegraph as to the strength and location of his picket-line. General Ferrero's division is ordered to the vicinity of the Williams house, and will to-morrow partially relieve your fatigue details.
