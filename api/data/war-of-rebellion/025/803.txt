GENERAL: Forty-five of the enemy's transports, with troops, and ten gunboats passed Friar's Point on the 22nd instant. Of this number twenty-four transports and two gunboats had passed Melrose Landing, 5 miles below Prentiss, at 12m. yesterday, 23rd instant. They have not yet reached Greenville, but may be expected early this morning.

I have sent this information to Major-General Smith, at Vicksburg, and he should be in possession of it to-day.

In obedience to your order I have stationed a picket guard at Skipwith's Landing, with orders to report to you promptly any landing of the enemy at that point.

Under the orders of General Smith, of 20th November, I shell march my command in the direction of Vicksburg without delay. Should the enemy attempt to pass across from Skipwith's Landing to the Yazoo I will harass him as much as I can.

Your order of 22nd in reference to conscripts in this district was received last evening.

I remain, general, most respectfully, your obedient servant,

WIRT ADAMS,

Colonel, Commanding Cavalry.
