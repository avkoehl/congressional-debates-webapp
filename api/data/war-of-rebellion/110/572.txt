RICHMOND, VA., December 3, 1863.

General J. E. JOHNSTON,

Meridian, Miss.:

Your letter of the 25th ultimo received. General Hampton cannot now be spared. Brigadier-General Forrest is promoted to the rank of major-general, and will, I hope, supply your wants in North Mississippi and West Tennessee, so as to enable you to draw Major-General Lee to the southern portion of your department.

JEFFERSON DAVIS.

MONTGOMERY, ALA., December 3, 1863.

Colonel B. S. EWELL,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

COLONEL: Several months since I received orders from General Bragg, acting under instructions from the Secretary of War, to proceed to this place and take command of the troops called for by the President for State defense. I had no instructions to report to any one, and only learned the fact of my being under command of General Johnston during the late visit of the President. It was my purpose soon thereafter to have proceeded to Meridian and to have reported in person, but have been prevented by indisposition. The quota of troops called for will not be ready until after the 1st of January, although the new Governor promises to be energetic in his measures to bring them into the field. Should it meet the approbation of the general, I will report at headquarters to receive instructions in reference to the duties expected of me.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, &amp;c.,

J. M. WITHERS,

Major-General.

Longstreet was shelling Knoxville Sunday. Ransom at Bean's Station at last accounts. On my way there. Can get no intelligence otherwise.

MERIDIAN, December 4, 1863.

His Excellency the PRESIDENT,

General Forrest's promotion and the arrangement you indicate will be very valuable.

J. E. JOHNSTON.
