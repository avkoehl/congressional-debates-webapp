CITY POINT, September 25, 1864.

Lieutenant DAVENPORT,

General Butler's Staff:

Agent left Richmond yesterday at 3 p. m. Early's second fight was known in Richmond about noon, and was spoken of at the Spotswood House as a defeat. Two regiments of infantry from Petersburg and one of the city battalions were sent yesterday to Lynchburg. Eight more guns were also sent down to be put in position at Chaffin's farm, and when the heavy firing of the salute here yesterday morning was heard in Richmond, another of the city battalions was formed and sent down to Chaffin's farm. Hampton's cavalry still reported on New Market Hill. Please telegraph me if you hear of any changes on your front, and whether you have anything confirming the reports received by me about Hampton's cavalry with the last two or three days.

SHARPE,

Colonel.
