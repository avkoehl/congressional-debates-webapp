RICHMOND, November 18, 1864.

TO THE PEOPLE OF Georgia:

You have now the best opportunity ever yet presented to destroy the enemy. Put everything at the disposal of our generals; remove all provisions from the path of the invader, and put all obstructions in his path. Every citizen with his gun, and every negro with his spade and axe, can do the work of a soldier. You can destroy the enemy by retarding his march. Georgians, be firm? Act promptly, and fear not!

B. H. HILL,

Senator.

I most cordially approved the above.

JAMES A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War.

CORINTH, November 18, 1864.

TO THE PEOPLE OR Georgia:

Arise for the defense of your native soil! Rally round your patriotic Governor and gallant soldiers! Obstruct and destroy all roads in Sherman's front, flank, and rear, and his army will soon starve in your midst! Be confident and resolute! Trust in an overruling Providence, and success will crown your efforts. I hasten to join you in defense of your homes and firesides.

G. T. BEAUREGARD.

CORINTH, November 18, 1864.

General J. B. HOOD,

Florence:

Batteries ordered from Macon cannot now be expected here. Send two soon as possible until others can be had.

G. T. BEAUREGARD.

CORINTH, November 18, 1864 - 3 p. m.

General J. B. HOOD,

Commanding, &amp;c.:

General Wheeler reports from Griffin yesterday that scouts from enemy's rear report Fourteenth Corps crossed Chattahoochee on 15th to join Sherman, giving him four corps. Should that be true, could you not spare then, at once, some troops for Georgia, or take the offensive immediately? General Cobb is urgent in his calls for assistance.

G. T. BEAUREGARD,

General.

CORINTH, MISS., November 18, 1864.

Major - General WHEELER:

Employ your cavalry to best advantage, retarding advance of Sherman's army and destroying supplies in his front.

G. T. BEAUREGARD.
