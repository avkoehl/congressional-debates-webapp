On the 22d, a party of Wheeler's cavalry, numbering about 75 men, attacked a small party of the Fourth Michigan Cavalry, stationed at Cleveland. Our loss was 1 or 2 captured, some property lost, consisting of overcoats, saddles, &amp;c., but the enemy were finally driven off.

On the 23d, Geary's division, of the Twelfth Corps, left their camp at Lookout Valley to take up a position along the Nashville and Chattanooga Railroad, one brigade to be stationed at Bridgeport and the other at Stevenson.

On the 28th, Colonel Bernard Laiboldt, Second Missouri Infantry, in charge of a train and escort, principally of convalescents belonging to the Fourth Corps, proceeding from Chattanooga to Knoxville, was attacked by a force of Wheeler's cavalry, numbering between 1,200 and 1,500, as he was crossing the Hiwassee River at Charleston. He immediately formed his guard in line of battle on the south side of the river, succeeded in crossing all his train in safety, and then charged the astonished rebels and drove them in confusion. He then called upon Colonel Eli Long for cavalry co-operation, he sent all the force he then had in camp, numbering 150 men. With this small force Colonel Long charged the enemy with sabers and drove him 5 miles, capturing 130 prisoners, including 5 commissioned officers. Our loss was 2 killed and 15 wounded. The enemy left his dead and wounded, as well as quite a number of small-arms, &c., upon the field. Both Colonels Laiboldt and Long are entitled to great credit for the manner in which they repelled this attack. I earnestly recommend them to favorable consideration for promotion; Colonel Laiboldt, for his executive ability and efficiency as a brigade commander of the Second Division, Twentieth Army Corps; Colonel Eli Long, for the valuable service he rendered during the recent battles in front of Chattanooga and for many instances of previous good conduct.

Provost-Marshal-General Wiles reports that 1,080 deserters from the enemy have come into the lines of this army between the 19th of October and December 31.
