Major-General BURNSIDE,

Commanding Ninth Corps:

The major-general commanding directs me to inform you that he has gone to City Point to be absent a few hours, and to request that if any thing occurs during his absence requiring his action that you will take command. I will at once notify you of any such occurrence.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS,June 20, 1864-7.20 p. m.

General MEADE,

Commanding Army of the Potomac:

The two divisions are now ready to move for the purpose of relieving the two divisions of Birney. We will not be able to put anything like the men on the line that they now have on it if enough are retained to make our present line strong, which I consider to be very important. How soon after dark shall the movement be commenced?

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,June 20, 1864-8 p. m.

Major-General BURNSIDE:

Relieve General Birney at once. If necessary put your whole corps in position. How many guns have you, including Ferrero's batteries, and how many had Birney in position?

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General
HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS,June 20, 1864.

Brigadier-General WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

In answer to your dispatch I have the honor to state that the following regiments compose the old Third Division of this corps: Tenth New Hampshire, Eleventh Connecticut, Thirteenth New Hampshire Fifteenth Connecticut, Fourth Rhode island, Sixteenth Connecticut, Fourth Rhode Island, Sixteenth Connecticut, Eighth Connecticut, Twenty-first Connecticut, Third New York, Eighty-ninth New York, One hundred and third New York, One hundred and seventeenth New York. As some of my old North Carolina regiments are now here, such as the Twenty-third, Twenty-fourth, Twenty-fifth, and Twenty-seventh Massachusetts, Tenth Connecticut, and Ninth New Jersey, it may be deemed proper to give me some of those instead of some of the above regiments now absent in North and South Carolina. I make no application for this unless the interests of the public service permit it.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.
