NEAR MARIETTA, June 26, 1864.

General BRAXTON BRAGG,

Richmond:

General Hood reports that the enemy in line of battle attacked Stevenson's skirmishers yesterday, but were quickly repulsed. There was heavy artillery firing during the day on Loring's front. We are losing from the ranks by sickness some 300 men a day since the heavy rains. The enemy is gradually pressing us back. To defeat his design it is necessary to break the railroad this side of Dalton. We have not cavalry enough. Can you not send such an expedition from East Tennessee or Mississippi?

J. E. JOHNSTON.

JUNE 26, 1864-4.15 p.m.

General WHEELER:

GENERAL: I have very good news from General Jackson's detachment operating against railroad. It is commanded by a man of courage and perseverance. Have you a party out on that service? If not, it is necessary to send one without delay, and under a commander capable of appreciating the importance of the service.

Respectfully,

J. E. JOHNSTON.
