Brigadier General W. T. WARD,

Commanding Third Division:

GENERAL: The general commanding directs that you detach one of your brigades, to follow the road that branches from the one in which you are marching, at the place where the house of Mrs. Jones was burned this morning (near the stockade), to destroy the railroad. They will work from where they strike the road this way till they meet the working party sent from here. They ca, after their work is completed, follow along the railroad and join their division at this point.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

HDQRS. DEPARTMENT AND ARMY OF THE TENNESSEE,Wiley's Farm, GA., December 4, 1864.

Major General W. T. SHERMAN,

Commanding Military Division of the Mississippi:

GENERAL: The right column reaches Statesborough, or near it, to-day. General Woods is going into camp near Wilson's Creek (the one next to Nevil's, and not named on the map). The two columns will come together opposite Guyton (or Numbers 3) to-morrow. I don't suppose General Blair can quite make that point, but he can come within five miles of it. The bridges across the Ogeechee at 6 and 5 are burned. What was the firing to-day? Are you meeting with resistance on the left?

Respectfully,

O. O. HOWARD,

Major-General.
