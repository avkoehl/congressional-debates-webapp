LEXINGTON, KY., June 14, 1864.

Brigadier General H. B. CARRINGTON, Louisville, Ky.:

Adjutant-General Boyle, Frankfort, reports rebels at Pleasureville this morning; probably the force raised by Captain Jessee. I know nothing of the force mentioned crossing at Paintsville. Please remain at Louisville until to-morrow. Where is the cavalry sent to Frankfort yesterday?

J. BATES DICKSON,

Captain and Assistant Adjutant-General.

MEMPHIS, TENN., June 14, 1864.

(Received 12. 12 p. m. 16th.)

Hon. E. M. STANTON, Secretary of War:

The affair of Sturgis's not as bad as he first represented. Loss will probably be reduced to 1,500 or 2,000. The force of the enemy consisted of the commands of S. D. Lee, Forrest, and Roddey, with infantry from Mobile, estimated at 15,000. Of 1,300 colored troops sent out, about 800 escaped. They fought desperately, and I hear were well treated by their captors.

C. C. WASHBURN,

Major-General.

MEMPHIS, June 14, 1864.

Major-General SHERMAN:

The affair of Sturgis' not bad as first reported by him. Loss will probably be reduced to 1,500 or 2,000 men and 14 pieces of artillery and 130 wagons destroyed; but few animals lost. The rebel force consisted of S. D. Lee's, Forrest's, and Roddey's cavalry, and infantry from Mobile; the whole estimated from 15,000 to 20,000. This same force can be moved in twenty-four hours by cars to Mobile if a demonstration is made there. With General A. J. Smith's force and other troops I can make a demonstration thirty or forty miles out, which will tend to keep the force that whipped Sturgis away from you. That our troops were badly handled from the moment they left here I have no doubt. They were nine days in going out and thirty-six hours in returning.

C. C. WASHBURN,

Major-General.
