You will please advise, when proper to do so, whether we can depend upon obtaining the materials from Harper's Ferry. You are doubtless aware that in case of necessity we can send trains from Washington to the Monocacy River in five hours, and from Baltimore in four hours. The structures between Monocacy and Harper's Ferry are small, so that if the latter point is held, and the enemy driven from the intermediate line, the road through can be used with but little delay.
