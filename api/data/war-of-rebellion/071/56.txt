BALTIMORE, MD., July 4, 1864.

Brigadier-General KENLY,

Commanding Third Separate Brigade:

GENERAL: I am directed by the general commanding to request that you will direct the officer in command of the guard at havre de Grace to transfer his command to the boat plying between that city and the opposite shore of the Susquehanna, used by the railroad company for the ferrying over of their trains. He will use every endeavor to protect the boat from capture either by an attack from the rebels or an attempt in their behalf by disloyal residents of that neighborhood. He will further carry out all orders heretofore issued, unless in violation of the spirit of these instructions.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
