General McCOOK, Murfreesborough:

March to La Vergne to-morrow and halt there until some corn is collected and loaded on the cars next day. Wagons will go out to-morrow to haul it in. the cars will take up the bridge guards beyond La Vergne. Stop them at that point until the train goes out next day for corn. Let a couple of regiments of cavalry cross over from La Vergne to Lebanon and Nashville roads and sweep the country of guerrillas in that direction. Keep cavalry well off to your rear.

SEPTEMBER 6, 1862.

Colonel BRUCE, Bowling Green:

Put your command in the strongest possible condition to resist attack and protect sullies. Keep out scouts and spies constantly in the direction of Scottsville and the Cumberland River, so as to be sure that you have timely warning of the approach of an enemy, especially in large force. Everything depends on this. You must establish some sure means of communicating with me in the shortest possible time, in cipher always.

D. C. BUELL.

Colonel STAGER:

A special agent of Adams Express Company, who left Nashville on the 4th with the valuable of the company, arrived safely at Louisville yesterday, and reports that the authorities there were discussing the question of evacuating the city, and the impression was that the forces would soon be withdrawn. Governor Johnson insisted on destroying the city, while General Buell claimed to be in command, and declared that it should be left as he found it. The railroad bridge had been planked over for the purpose of crossing teams and troops.
