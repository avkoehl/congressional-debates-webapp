HEADQUARTERS CAVALRY DIVISION,January 25, 1865-1 p. m.

General J. W. TURNER,

Chief of Staff:

I have sent you all the information I have. Colonel Spear has made no report as yet, but I am satisfied there is no movement this side of the Williamsburg road. I sent down two prisoners, captured beyond Whites Tavern this morning, belonging to Hampton's Legion. They give no information and know of no movement. Gary's brigade, from their account, has not left, but moved out on the Williamsburg road yesterday, but went back again.

They were turned out yesterday about noon, and moved along the lines a short distance and then went back. The party sent out by Colonel Spear, four officers and eighty men, have not been heard from yet. Colonel Spear has gone out with another party to see what has become of the first party.

January 25, 1865.

Brigadier-General TURNER,

Chief of Staff:

Colonel Spear has returned from his search after Captain Nimmon. He went to White's Tavern, and learned that Captain Nimmon had been there, and returned on the Charles City road, the way he came, having heard of some small partners of the enemy. Captain Nimmon returned about sundown, having gone out to Riddell's Shop, up the Charles City road to White's Tavern, and back again, besides searching the side roads. No intelligence was gained, except the fact that there is no enemy moving in force in that neighborhood.

Colonel EVANS:

The general commanding directs me to say that you will send out a scouting party as soon as they can see to move this morning. You will, if you deem it necessary, take your brigade and proceed to White's Tavern. You will be cautious and reconnoiter in front of your line only, as other parties are to be out in front of other parts of the line.
