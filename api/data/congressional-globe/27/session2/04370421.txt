in Com mi teeof the Wh >le on he state or tí eU utn was taken
up al! of which time (wi h tneescppnop of about two week )
had been voted to its d'scu sion It seemed to be ntcessaiy in
view ot the presamg pfccs^ity of action on other appropriation
bills, that i time should be designated within winch lebite on
the bill 6hoidd cease He had hoped that tin  subject could
have been accompl shed with Ue ad )p!ion of a resolution tak
ing the bill outof coinmi tee, but fiom the course the debate
had uken,he now ri^paued of it He, theiefore,iot>e to sub
mu a íesolution for the purpose of terminating the debate on
Saturday at 12 o'clock, m the hope that the mil might be pa s
ed to a third leading on that dav
And he moved the previous<|estion
The resolution was rea 1 as follows
Resolved, That all debate upon the bill of thii IIoui", No

Mr ANDREWS, oi Kentucky appealed to Mr I illmofe
to withdiaw the motion for the pievious question, to enable
him (Mr   A ) to ptopo-*  an am ndn ent
Mr FILLMOR" w^s undeistood to expieos his willing-
ness to do so, profiled the gentleman wou d íenea the mo
Mr ANDREWS then moved to amei d the íesolution by
striking out the woiks'aatuulav, at 12 o'clock," and inserting
"this day at 4 o'clock "
Mr ADAMS hoped, he was under* oodtosiy,that noearliei
time thin that named m'he resolution would be fixed unon
Topics had been introduced on the paiticulai amendment now
under discussion, and an exposition had been made ;e<-terday
•which he thought rendered if indispensable that the subject
¡should be fully and thoioughly diicu^ed, and he did not think
it possible that it could be ditcu  *d before the time specified
by the chairman of the Committee of Ways and Means The
matter was nottobepassed over m the form m which it now
stood, and, aftei what had been said in this House yesterday,
the power of reply was not to be denied
Mr ANDREWS of Kentucky was understood to refer to the
fact that to morrow and Saturday were the days devoted by the
rules to the consideration of private bills, and to say, that as
Friday and Saturday of the last week had unfortunately been
lostto that interest, he (Mr A ) was unwilling again to spe it
set aside As ¡o the debate which was pending in committee on
the ptopomionrostrike out the mission to Mexico,he thought
it unprofitable and useless, and he regretted that it hadbeen in
trod oced
He renewed the motion for the previous question.
And iheie was a second
And th" mam question was ordered to be taken
And the question wis taken, fiiston the amendment of Mr
Andrews and was decided in the negative
So the amendmen wat. rejecjed
And the question recumng on the adoption of the resolu
tion—
Mr GWIN asked the yeas and nays which were ordered
Mr WLLLLR suggested to Mr Fillmore to change the
phriseologv of lusresolution
The resolution as it now stood, would produce the impres
sion that the bill had been under consideration since the 8th of
Feb* nary, when, m fact, it had been laid aside for tluee weeks
in order to make way for the loan bi'l
Mi  STANI Y called to older

Mr. WELLDR hoped the gentleman from New York [Mr
FillmorcI would accede to the suggestion
Mr riLLMOREdesned the Speaker to infoim him what
the gentleman from Ohio (.Mr WellerJ had said
The SPEAKER The gentleman suggests a change in the
phiaseology of the resolution
Mr HLLMOKB 1 cannot hear a word lhatis said, and I

THE LOAN BTI L    t
Mi FILLMORE asked the genera) consent of the House to
take up the loan bi!1 whuh (as stated) liad been returned fiom
the Sena e with an amendment                    \
Objections wen, made, and thec wcreseveial cries of "No,
no "                                                                  i
Mi FILLMORE siid, that so great was the importance of
the passage <-( the bill, that he felt bound to ntovt a suspension
of the rules for the purposa of taking it up t The airendment
ol the Stnate was rathei  verbal than involving any principle
Mr ARNOLDsaid hehadheaid no objections to taking up
the bdt
The SPEAKER Objections have been made jn seveial
paitsof the Hall
Ai ei a brief conversation between Mr CA"VE JOHNSON
and the SPEAKER—
The quea'ton oi the motion to suspend the rules was taken,
and decided m the affirmative   Yeas 111, nays 33
So th   i ules were suspended
The bi 1 Was then taken up, and the amendment of theSe
nate to thebili as it pas-ed the Hou^e, was read
The tmen Iment pioposes to strike out fiom the fi «t line of
the ihir1 section ol the bill all after the woid "enac ed ' and to
in^ei   the following
'That lieSecrttary oftht Tieasii,y be, and he is hereby,

the same Pi ox ided> That no stork «hail be di->po ed oí at a
lower rateti in the hishest price offered m said proposals "
Mr CI1FFORD moved the follow ng amendment to the
amendment
Itf-sohetl That the ^ale of 'lie «aid stock, or any poition
theieof, undei tins act, imny mode therein specified «Vab not
b^ ata rate of discount whieh Rill cause a lo s to the United
States irom the pai \alue of the stock to exceed the sum of
S300000, or at that rate of lossupon thewhoie amount ofetock
hereinafter aathorjzed to be iBsueo, to be calculated upon any
portion at the time of sale "
Mr Ciifford said that he was not disposed to detain th«
House longer than, was necessary simply to explain the object
of the amendment.
He desired to make one more effort to save at least a poition
efthe disgrace which would fall upon the country by tbis bill,
and to save the country Aom the danger of combinations
among the banker  and brokersfor the purpose of depreciating
the value of this stoek.
The amendment which had been offered gave sufficient lati-
tude to ensure the loan being taken, and he believed that no
possible injmy could result from us adoption, but, on the con-
trary, very great good And he wanted to see how many
members were willing to place their names on the record, aa
authorizing the sacrifice of the treasure of the country to a
greater amount than three handled thousand dollars at a single
vote.                                                                                    r        _
Mr FILLMORE replied briefly to Mr. Clifford Jíesaid
he could well conceive that there was some principle, or s^P
posed principle of honor involved in fixing a limit m the first! (
instance to the sale of this stock in market under par, but
when that point had been passed, he could not conceive the
motive, when the credit of the country was involved, for fix-
ing that limit at a certain per centum—which was, he believed,
about five pei cent in the whole amount to be sold If we
weie to ¡sell the stock at all under par, it was in consequence
of the necessity of raising money to meet the demands of credi-
tors upon the Government, and whether the sacrifice to be
made for the purpose of meeting our obligations should be
five, ten fifteen, or twen y per cent he would never stop to
calculate He was willing to make whatevei sacrifice was
necessary to that end, and he trusted that, befoie this session
of Congress should terminate, a revenue adtquate to the just
wants and purposes of the Government would be provided, so
that we should never again be called upon to submit to such a
state of things.
One word in explanation of the amendment to the teenate
It seemed to have been supposed that there was some ambi-
guity in the third section of the billas it passed this House.
Some gentlemen supposed that the bill required the stock *0 be
advertised, even although it could be sold at par Such waa
not the intention of the Committee of Waysard Means, n°r
was such the explanation given to the section in this Houe¿
But, for the purpose of removing a bupposed ambiguity, the
words of the section had been changed so as to declare that the
stock  may be sold at par, without being advenibed
Tt Shad also been supposed that, as the bill went from this
House, when the block was advertised and a proposition was
made to purchase it, the ¡secretary of the Treasury was bound
to accept the proposition, whatever it might be This was
clearly not the intention of the committee nor oithe House But
to remove the supposed ambiguity, an express provision was
introduced that the Secretary was not bound to accpt the pro
posi ion, that he might sell the stock at pi ivate eale, but not
below ihatpioposuion He (Mr F) could not contei?e that
<-ny object ion could exist t > the amendment If ¡hese ambK  -
ties did exist, it was proper they should be remedied and the
sole object of the amendment was to apply the remedy He
could notcon«ent that (he time ot the House should be (uither
consumed, cspeeially as aieso ulion hail been adopted limnm.*
the dibdission on the general appiopnation bill lie would
therefoie move the previous question on the bill
And (here was asecend
