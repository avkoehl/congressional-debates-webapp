Numbers 16. Report of Lieutenant Colonel John A. McLaughlin, forty-seventh Indiana Infantry. HDQRS . FORTY-SEVENTH Regiment Indiana VOLUNTEERS, Edwards Depot MISS., May 18, 1863.

SIR: I respectfully submit the following report of the part borne by the Forty-seventh in the engagement of the 16th instant on Midway Hill:

About 9 o'clock on the morning of the 16th, I was ordered to form in line of battle on the left of the road leading from Clinton to Edwards Depot. After forming, it being on Campion's plantation and in rear about 100 yards, where the regiment was halted, and Companies G and B were thrown forward as skirmishers, covering the entire front of the line occupied by the regiment, when the whole moved forward slowly and cautiously for a distance of about 200 yards, when a brisk fire was opened on the left of our skirmishers. The enemy fell back, when the two companies as skirmishers were relieved by Company A, soon after which word was received that the enemy were attempting to flank us on the left. I immediately changed the line of battle, and threw the three left companies forward, but failing to meet the enemy after advancing a short distance, I was ordered to move to the support of the Eleventh and Forty-sixth Indiana Regiments, which were engaged upon our right on the road. I ordered in the companies that were out at the time, and immediately moved by the right flank in double-quick time, crossing the road under a galling fire from the enemy, and formed on the crest of the hill, within 50 yards of the enemy, who were sheltered behind a dwelling-house and out-buildings and heave timber, which gave them decided advantage, and enabled them to pour a heavy fire upon us. Yet our position was maintained and the fire returned, lasting
