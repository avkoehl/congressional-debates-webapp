Have reached this place with head of column in good order. I sent to General Grant on the 11th for three batteries, for the defense of Baltimore. On the 13th I reported by telegraph they would not be wanted. Four from Sixth Corps were sent, and are in Baltimore, under Major Tompkins, Sixth Corps, who reports by telegraph for orders. Will you send them to him? Would like my orders now, so that I can send them for information of General Wright.

E. O. C. ORD,
