FORT MONROE, VA., May 5, 1862.

Hon. E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

My infantry are ready to march at any moment, with provisions, ammunition,&amp;c. I have one field battery ready for the field. If I had horses, I could fit out three fine batteries. I have also several squadrons of dragoons ready to move. If I knew whether it was for land or sea service I could answer more definitely. If for sea service, there would be no delay. If for land service, in consequence of having given to General McClellan much of our transportation, we are deficient in that particular, and it might delay me a day or two.

JOHN E. WOOL,

Major-General.
