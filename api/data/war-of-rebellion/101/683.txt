January 30, 1865.

Captain J. L. PRICE,

Commanding Detachment of Ninth Kansas Cavalry:

It was the intention and perfectly practicable to picket along the bayou running between the upper and lower surrounding hill from White River to Cache River. The brigadier-general commanding desires you to establish the line as directed, the left resting on or near the White River and the right on or near the Cache River. The neighborhood is easily approached by land from this place, but it was thought best to land you a short distance up the River and save a march. Perhaps you have landed too far up. If so, you should try and work your way down so as to get into the district desired to guard. Try again to-morrow morning and report in the afternoon what success.

Respectfully, yours,

CHAS. E. HOWE,

Captain, Twelfth Michigan Infantry, and Actg. Asst. Adjt. General
