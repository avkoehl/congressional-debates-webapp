CAVALRY HEADQUARTERS,

Dinwiddie Court-House, March 30, 1865.

Lieutenant-General GRANT,

Commanding Armies of the United States:

GENERAL: The enemy has moved out infantry on the White Oak road. Pickett's division drove back a small cavalry force which was at the Five Forks cross-roads. A prisoner from Pickett's division reports a concentration of the enemy's cavalry there. We have captured forty of fifty prisoners. I will be able to give you more detailed accounts this evening. Pickett's division came up from Burkeville.

Very respectfully,

P. H. SHERIDAN,

Major-General, Commanding.

Forward to the President, at City Point, and General Meade.

U. S. G.

CAVALRY HEADQUARTERS,

Dinwiddie Court-House, March 30, 1865-7 p. m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT,

Commanding Armies of the United States:

GENERAL: Pickett's division is deployed along the White Oak road, its right at Five Forks, and extending toward Petersburg. After the small force at Five Forks was driven back no attempt was made to follow up, and the enemy did not appear to be in strong force. There is no doubt but that Pickett's division is on the White Oak road, his right extending as far as Five Forks. Prisoners report the enemy's cavalry concentrated at Five Forks. I have, however, no positive information of this. General Merritt's pickets nearly up to the White Oak, and is encamped at J. Boisseau's house.

Very respectfully,

P. H. SHERIDAN,

Major-General, Commanding.

General MEADE:

The above dispatch just received. Warren will not, from this dispatch, have the cavalry support on his left flank that I expected. This information had better be sent to him, with instructions to watch closely on his left flank.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

GRAVELLY RUN, March 30, 1865.

Major-General SHERIDAN:

Your positions on the White Oak road are so important that they should be held even if it prevents sending back any of your cavalry to Humphreys' Station to be fed. The fifty wagon-loads of forage ordered will be increased if you think it necessary. Let the officer who goes back to conduct it to your cavalry call on General Ingalls at my headquarters.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

P. S.- Can you not push up toward Burgess' Mills on the White Oak road?
