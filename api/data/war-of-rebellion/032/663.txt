GENERAL: I overtook enemy's rear guard in timber here at sundown, and had some skirmishing, killing 1 and capturing several. I am compelled to halt half the night for food and rest. Hope to have fresh troops from Clinton, Fort Scott, and border stations by to-morrow night. Enemy turned from Clinton road, a nd now moves toward Papinsville. Weer can't catch, up, I fear.

CARTHAGE, MO., October 18, 1863-8 a. m.

GENERAL: After a march of 76 miles in twenty-four hours, I reached here at daylight, expecting to encounter Shelby's whole command. He passed through here, however, last night for Neosho, leaving a small command of about 30 to run the mill and collect stragglers, These I captured, with their horses, arms, and equipments. Among the prisoners are Major J. F. Pickler and other officers and men belonging to seven different Missouri regiments. Throughout the pursuit, and especially for the last 50 miles, the trail has been lined with Shelby's horses, broken down in the chase. His men have been leading large numbers of horses, stolen in La Fayette County, to supply the place of those abandoned. He has no transportation nor artillery, keeps nor roads, and is hard to follow rapidly be night. I think, if not re-enforced from below, he will push on to the Arkansas, without necessary halt, though his command is suffering intensely for want of rest.

GENERAL: Having heard that General McNeil will be in Sarcoxie to-night, I write him, offering co-operation. I had intended a march to-morrow night on Newtonia, where I expect Shelby to concentrate and remain a day or two to get flour, unless pursued at once. I hear reports from scouts and otherwise that Marmaduke is advancing from Fayetteville to re-enforce Shelby, and will not withdraw any considerable number of troops until I ascertain what foundation there is for the report.
