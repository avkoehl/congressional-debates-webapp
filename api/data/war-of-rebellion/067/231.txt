large, as will be seen by the following statement of the numbers received into the field hospitals, and the labor of collecting and bringing them in went on until midnight:

Number of wounded received:

Second Corps............................................. 1,820

Fifth Corps.............................................. 900

Sixth Corps.............................................. 840

Total.................................................... 3,560

The proportion of severe wounds was unusually large, not over one-fourth of the number being able to walk back to the hospitals; 240 ambulances collected the remainder. The amount of shock and depression of vital power was noticed to be comparatively much greater in the wounded of this battle than in any preceding one of the campaign, and more especially so in those of the Second Corps, who went into action without having had the usual morning cup of coffee. All of the wounded were fed and sheltered, and the majority dressed and operated upon during the day. Supplies of every kind were abundant, with the exception of dry clothing and blankets, for which the demand was very great. Fortunately the night was not cold, and as stimulants and hot soup and coffee were abundant and freely administered, the suffering from this cause was not severe. The hospitals of the Sixth Corps had to be pitched upon wet and muddy ground, but by the use of boards, obtained from and adjacent saw-mill, India-rubber blankets, and evergreen boughs, the condition of the wounded in them was rendered very tolerable. On the 13th, another train of ambulances and army wagons, obtained from the supply trains, was organized to convey wounded to Fredericksburg, Surgeon Martin, U. S. Volunteers, being in charge. The number sent was as follows:

Corps.	 Wounded.	 Ambulances.	 Army wagons.

Second	 1,843	 47	 175

Fifth	 550	 35	 20

Sixth	 800	 40	 50

Total	 3,193	 122	 245

One day's rations, and the usual proportion of medical officers and attendants, were sent with the train, which was collected at Silver's, leaving that place at 9 p. m., and reaching Fredericksburg early the following morning. The sufferings of these wounded were great. It rained all night, the men were wet and chilled, nor was it possible to supply them with hot food on the road. Fourteen men died during the trip. The necessity for sending off as many as possible, however, was imperative, as the army moved during the night of the 13th, and the ground occupied by the hospitals was abandoned to the enemy. No more ambulances could be spared, as there were still some wounded lying on the field to be brought in, and a general engagement was expected on the following day, while a large portion of the ambulances were already absent; every wagon was obtained from the quartermaster's department which could possibly be emptied. But 420 of the Fifth and 200 of the Second Corps had to be left on account of lack of transportation. Tents, medical officers, and attendants, dressings, and medical supplies, and three days'
