C. A. DANA,

Assistant Secretary of War, Washington, D. C.:

We have had great detentions and a hard time on the Ohio Central arising from broken rails, cars off the track, and the cold weather, but as yet to injurey to a single person, so far as I can learn. There are still over 200 cars between here and Columbus, but the track is now reported all clear, and I hope all will be in very speedily. I am putting stoves and large quantities of straw or hay in every car and furnishing an abundance of hot coffee. We have had a very severe time for three days, and if we get through all safe I shall be most thankful. I can't get away from here before Monday.

LEWIS B. PARSONS,

Colonel and Chief of Rail and River Transportation.
