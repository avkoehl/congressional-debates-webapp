Brigadier-General TURNER,

Chief of Staff:

General Wild reports five boats went up this morning at 5 o'clock or so. They went up separately, each by its own power, apparently. The third in order was seen to be struck three times from Fort Brady, the balls striking fire from their iron sides. They traveled slowly up and made no return fire. The only sign of life aboard was the setting of a lantern n the bows of the third boat after she was struck the third time. This lantern was soon extinguished by the rifle-balls of the pickets.

C. A. HECKMAN,

Brigadier-General.
