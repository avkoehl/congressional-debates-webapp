They are only detailed from their companies for special service, entirely in accordance with what is and must always be done in any army, but in this instance effecting very important and useful ends. I have asked General Halleck to please examine this matter. I take the liberty of making this request to yourself also, as I think you will see in it only benefit, and no contravention of law. We all think it pregnant with good.
