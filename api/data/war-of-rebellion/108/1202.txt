Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,February 25, 1865.

To CORPS COMMANDERS:

Everything tends to satisfy the major-general commanding that the rebels contemplate evacuating Petesburg. Anticipating orders from the lieutenant-general he desires to call your attention to the necessity of treating this matter with great earnestness. Whenever your lines are not sufficiently near to watch the enemy, it will be necessary for you either to advance your lines or to organize scouting parties of trust-worthy and enterprising men who will keep you advised of all that may occur corroborating of this view of the intentions of the enemy. Without striking tents it will be necessary to keep your command ready to follow up closely any movement, even with small parties, through any follow up closely any movement, even with small parties, through any gap that may be discovered. Deserters are to be examined at once and the result telepgraphed.
