By order of the Governor:

O. C. BAILEY,

Major and Aide-de-Camp.

OFFICE MAYOR OF THE CITY OF PHILADELPHIA,

September 27, 1864.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

SIR: Reverend Doctor Saunders, of this city, personally known to me as one of the most active and efficient supporters of Government, desires to confer with you relative to the filling of the quota of Philadelphia. No one is better able than he to speak from personal inquiry and observation. While the city as a community has, I fully believe, contributed the whole number of volunteers required from it, there or four of its wards yet wanting in their due proportion, all of which are earnestly striving to make up the demand.

Under these circumstances a plea for the postponement of the draft ought not to be rejected. To requirements of the Government, by voluntary action, will be complied with quite as promptly as through the process of a draft. In urging such postponement Reverend Doctor Saunders will truly represent that wishes of the citizens of Philadelphia.

I am, very respectfully,

ALEXANDER HENRY,

Mayor of Philadelphia.
