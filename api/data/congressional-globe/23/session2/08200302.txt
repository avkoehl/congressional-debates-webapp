THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
February 17,
his resolutions But before doing so he desired to
know whether the paper presented by his honor
able collea'ne cone tided with any lesolutions?
Mr E °EVJiRETT replied, that it did not
He merely wished, as he stated before, to give it
the same disposition that the House intended to
give to the reptrt of the majority.
Mi. J Q, ADAMS said, as the report of the
minority did not conclude with any resolution or
resolutions, he moved that the resolutions which
he had presented yesterday should be received as
an amendment, or a substitute, to those of the
gentleman from New York
[The lesoluuons were then read, as they ap
peared in tne proceedings oí yesterday ]
Mr A íeq jested that the word " measures" as
printed in the Nati mal Intelligencer should be
a tered to " measuie " He also wished to ac
count to the House and to the nation for theveibal
variations that existed between the copies punted
in the Intelli¿encerand the Globe of that morning
The Mason was this- His resolutions, in his own
manuscript, were taken by the editors of the Na-
tional Intelligencer to be punted in that paper
Shortly afterwards an application was made to
Mr A on the pait of the Globe for a copy of
them-, he staled the fact, that they were m the
possession of the editois of the Intelligence , but
the geinleman wh > anplied to him Irom the Globe,
having ex^iessed a strong desire to have a copy
of them to publish in that morning's paper, Mr
A v/ro'c a tnnscnpt fiom memory, intending it,
if he could, to be vtibatim U lilcialim, but he
fo ind on reading it over that theie weie verbal
alteration**,though making no alreiati>n wholesei
in the sense He thought it ptoper to give this
I r ef exj lanation, because peisnna at a distance
might be unable to corjec uie why such variation"5
should have occurred
Mr A  conclu le I by moving that the íesolii
turns be idopted as an amendment, or substitute,
for those of Mr  Caubrlllng
fhe SPEAKER, lemaiked, hat the question
would be on the amendment ollereil by the other
gentleman fiom Massachusetts, [Mr  E\irltt ]
Mi ARCHCR lose (he said) to move that the
report and re oluuons ot the mctjonty of the com
mittee, logethei with the report of tl e n inonty,
be commuted to a Committee of the Whole on
the state of the Union, and be made the oider of
the day for that thy
Mr CAM BRELENG requested the gentleman
t> amend his motion so as io include the punting
of the report and resolutions
Mr ARC ICR assented, and fuithei amended
the motion so as to make it the order of the day
lor to-morrow
The CHAIR letnarked, that if the subject was
committed to a Committee of the Whole on the
state of theUnion, it must take the mditmiy place
on theCalendai, and could not be brought up but
by a vote of two thirds of the House for a sus-
pension of the i ules
Mr. ARCHER then said he would confine his
motion to make it the order of the day for " to-
day "
Mr POLK begged to inquire of the Chair if it
wns  made  the order of the day fn "today,"
whether it would then hive the piecedence?
The CHAIR replied in the negative.
Mr  POLK h&ped then it would not be com
mitted
Mr WILDE asked what would belts situation
if the motion to commit to a Committee of the
Whole on the state of the Union pi evaded >
The CHAIR leplied, they would be plsced
on the Cilendar, and could be taken up by post
poning all the orders of the da3 ,or by hying each
subject on the table as it came up, till the House
reached this
This   point was   further  discussed   briefly by
Mr    SPEIGHT,   Mr    MERCER,   and    Mi
ARCHER
Mr SUTHERLAND rose (he said) to put a
question to the Chan, the reply to which would
govern his vote "He defined to know if the Chair
consideied this the last day on which bills emana-
ting in that House could be sent to the other
branch, and he would request the Clerk to exam-
ine the Journals to see if Sunday was a dies non,
or was considered one of the parliamentary days.
The CHAIR replied that he had been informed
that a decision of a former Congress had been
made on this subject, and that that would be the
last day, according to that decision, on which the
House could «end bills to the other branch.
Mr. MILLER said he expected that answer,
and he would suggest whether it would not be
better to act on such bills as were indispensable
to day, and to allow the subject then before the
House to he over till to morrow.
Mr. CAMBRELENG suggested to the gentle-
man from Viiginia [Mi Archer] to witlidiaw
his motion to commit to a Committee of the
Whole on the state of the Union, because if the
motion prevailed, it would defeat all action upon
the resolutions during the present sessidn. There
was a bill connee'ed with the subject, which, if
not taken up to day, could not be acted upon
without a vote of two thuds of both Houses, he
therefore hoped the gentleman would not press
his motion.
Mr ARCHER said he was as anxious as the
gentleman from New York to avoid a lengthy dis-
cussion on this subject, but it seemed to him that
it would be both inegular and derogatory to the
subject to discuss it anywhere else than in Com-
mittee of the Whole on the state of the Union
The House might, if it pleased, resolve itself
mslanter into a Committee of the Whole generally,
and take up any business before it
Mi BURGE8 thought evei y gentleman would
at once perceive the importance of the question,
and recollect that it was one of as deep an intei est
t  the Union and to the nation as had ever been
discussed in a Committee on the state of the Union
Look back to the whole history of the country,
and the same couise had always been taken, and
a deviation fiom that long established course had
nevei taken place on far less important subjects
than this.                                                                       i
With regard to the objections of the gentleman I
from New York, they had been answered by the ,
gentleman fiom Vnginia     When in Committee i
of the Whole on thestate of the Union, they could j
take up whatevei bills might be referred to it, and '
these resolu ions likewise.    Really, he must say I
that it seemed to him altogether out of the ordinal y
course not to refer this matter.    It was in order
every day, and at any time, for the House to go
mío that committee    He hoped the bills before I
(he House would be taken up and gone through |
to da), and they might fully discuss the matter
undei consideiation to-morrow, and he hoped the
motion would be so modified.
Mr POLK lose (he said) to correct an error
into which many had fallen, in regaid to the pai-
ticular position m which the bill to regulate the
deposite of the public money then was That
bill was not in Committee of the Whole on the
sute of the Union It had been made the special
ordei f >r a certain day, and by a vote of the House
some fortnight ago, all the orders of the day had
been postponed for the puipose of taking up the
several bills relating to the Bank of the United
States                                                   ^
[Mi   P  here enumerated the several bills ]
Since then, by various votes of the [louse, other
measures have obtained precedence by postponing
these bills     Now, he understood the state of the
business to be this   If the recommendation of the
Committee on Foreign Affairs should receive the '
sanction of the House, the bill involved in it must '
also be acted upon at the same time, or, if not, it j
would require a majority of two thuds of both 
Houses
He would suggest to the gentleman from Vir-
ginia [Mr Archer] what would perhaps econo- j
mise their time, viz that they should proceed
forthwith to decide upon these resolutions, for to
commit them to the Committee of the Whole on
the state of the Union would be to bury them It
was very certain that the House would never hear
of them again. If decision was requned theonly
way to get at it would be to consider the subject
at once
Mr J d ADAMS said itappeared to him that
the course íecommended by the gentleman from
Vnginia was the only constitutional course, and
as the object of the last resolution of the chair
man of the Committee on Foreign Relations was i
to effect an appropriation for the defence of the
country—at least the recommendation-contained
in it involved an appropriation of money—the res-
olution itself must, pursuant to the rules of the
House, be considered in Committee of the Whole
House. It was a proposition to employ money;
to expend money; the money of the nation, and
a large sum of it, too; and was, therefore, an
appropriation. He would remark that it was
introduced by an indirect resolution, although it
could not be carried into effect but by a bill The
House could not bind itself to pass it, unless it
went through committee. By the rules of the
House, no motion or proposition for a tax or
charge upon the people can be discussed on the
same day it is introduced, and, moreover, it was
provided that every such proposition should re-
ceive its first discussion in a Committee of the
Whole House Was this not a proposition for
a tax, or a chaige upon the people? It was, for
it would take the people's money and appropriate
it for purposes which it was not yet certain that
the consent of Congress could be obtained. The
object was apparent enough. It was done for the
purpose of forcing down in the Committee of the
Whole on the state of the Union, a bill which
ought to be specially discussed in that committee.
It was an ingenious device, now for the first time
disclosed, to connect the war with the Bank 01
the United States We were to have two wars
together. He thought one would be as much as
we could wage for the good of the country.
Another rule of the House provided that no
tax or duty should be increased, without being also
discussed in the Committee of the Whole on the
state of the Union. And the next was, that all
proceedings touching appropriations of money
should be fiist discussed in the Committee of the
Whole House Was this nota proceeding touch-
irg the appropriation of money' We were told
that it was a proceeding to deliver the United
States from the burden of $7,000,000, but Mr. A
thanked God there had as yet been no expression
of opinion on the part of the House on the sub-
ject.
There were two things which in the course of
the deep anxiety he had felt on this subject since
the commencement of the session, he had obseived
with deep concern. The first was that the prin-
ciple had been assumed—and it was with unfeigned
grief he said it—by the majority of that House,
that this dispute with Fiance was to be managed
upon party grounds, that the supporters of the
Administration were the only persons to be heard
upon this subject, that what they proposed must
be cairied in spite of all objections, and that the
minority were to have no puvileges whatever left
to them, but to say aye or no, to any proposition
presented by the friends of the Administration.
That was the principle assumed, and one which
he deeply deplored
The second thing was that now for the first
time disclosed, and that was that the two wars
weietobe blended together. That there was to
be a war with France and a war with the Bank of
the United States, carried on at the same time,
in such a manner as that one of them would break
down the other He repeated that this principle
had been assumed, a principle the teverse of that
assumed by the Senate—he hoped he was not out
of order in alluding to the other body—but it was
the reverse of the punciple there assumed, and of
the only principle upon which, in his opinion, the
country could ever go through a war against a
foreign nation, with honoi or with advantage to
the country I say (said Mr A ) it was assumed
by an act of the minority of the Committee ot)
Foieign Relations, which act that House did not
reprobate as 1 thought it should have done, by
displacing, contrary to long established usage, the
chairman of that committee, and placing in his
stead anothei chairman, chosen, to say the least of
it, by his own vote.
The SPEAKER intimated that the gentleman
must percive that these remarks were not in
order They were irrelevant to the subject under
consideration
Mr J a ADAMSsaid he had referred to that
appointment only by way of illustration of the
principles assumed in the'management of those
allans, and wfesch he thought extremely perm-
