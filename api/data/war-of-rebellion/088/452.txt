HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,August 24, 1864-5 p. m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

I have sent out Major Roebling to lay off the redoubt, but upon investigation I find that it will be difficult for me to work on it to-night.

Major-General.

Commanding Fifth Corps:

HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,August 24, 1864-9.20 p. m.

General HUMPHREYS:

My signal officer has a good station to see about the lead-works, but, unfortunately, he left there about 5 p. m. Up to that time he had
