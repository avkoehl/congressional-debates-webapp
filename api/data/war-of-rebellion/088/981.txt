General MEADE:

I forward a copy of Richmond paper of the 22nd, by orderly. It contains a dispatch from Lee to Secretary of War, announcing the defeat of Early, with death of Rodes and General A. A. Godwin, and wounding of Fitz Lee. Says Early has fallen back to Fisher's Hill; also, contains a rather doleful editorial on the subject, and another admitting a scarcity of supplies in the Army of Northern Virginia.
