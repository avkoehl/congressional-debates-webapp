rifle-pits and epaulements in Lookout Valley. Precise number of casualties in last night's battle not yet reported, but as nearly as I can ascertain the killed are about 70; the wounded, 200. The new steam-boat Chattanooga, just finished at Bridgeport, landed her first cargo to-day at Rankin's Ferry, and will land another at Kelley's Ferry to-morrow. The distance from the last-named place to Chattanooga is 10 miles; road excellent. As soon as her powers are well ascertained she will try to come up through the Suck and other dangers of the river to Brown's Ferry, at the mouth of Lookout Valley.

CHATTANOOGA, October 30, 1863-7 a.m.

The steamboat Paint Rock passed down from the landing here to Brown's Ferry shortly after midnight last night. In passing Lookout Mountain she was fired at by musketry, and the cannon on the summit gave her a few shots, but neither boat nor crew suffered injury. This boat can bring 200 tons of freight to Brown's Ferry landing daily. Rain this morning, but we have the river. As soon as the gaps in Raccoon Mountain are fortified, Chattanooga will be absolutely safe.
