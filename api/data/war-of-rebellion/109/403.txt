INDIANAPOLIS, July 12, 1863-9.15 p. m.

General WALLACE:

All accounts agree that Morgan is moving east or northeast from Versailles. It is not necessary for you to come up in this direction. Had you not better march over to Madison with your command, leaving General Hughes at Vernon? If you find boats at Madison, send spare troops and artillery to points between Madison and Lawrenceburg.

O. B. WILLCOX,

Brigadier-General.

INDIANAPOLIS, July 12, 1863-10.15 p. m.

General WALLACE,

North Vernon:

A rebel detachment was skirmishing this evening with some of our troops, trying to push through to Lawrenceburg. The rebels may at least succeed in cutting their main forces. Was at Hillsborough this afternoon, marching on Aurora. Rush through to Madison and get troops and artillery on board of steamers to oppose the rebels at Aurora or Lawrenceburg. This is a great chance for you.

O. B. WILLCOX,

Brigadier-General.
