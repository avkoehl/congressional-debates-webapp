HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,October 26, 1864-6.15 p.m. (Sent 6.45 p.m.)

Major-General WARREN,

Commanding Fifth Corps:

General Parke has opened a route for you on the left of the fort at the Clements house from the open field, beyond which you take a road through the woods which leads out to the Duncan road, or at least to a house on that road (Westmoreland house, marked Miss Pegram's originally). There will be nothing to prevent your moving simultaneously with Parke as far as the Duncan road, and from that you will probably be able to find a route to Hatcher's Run.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
