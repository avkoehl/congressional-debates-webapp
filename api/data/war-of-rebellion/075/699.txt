HEADQUARTERS HINDMAN'S DIVISION,At Long's Tan-yard, May 12, 1864-9.35 a. m.

Major General JOSEPH WHEELER,

Commanding Cavalry, &amp;c.:

GENERAL: Since my dispatch of 7.30, sent by courier, informing you of my arrival here, I have examined the route along the railroad to Davis' house, and ascertained that the march of my column there would be visible to the enemy on Rocky Face, but believe I conceal the infantry to the right and deceive the enemy by moving my wagons straight to Davis', preceded by a small detachment of your cavalry. The other route suggested by General Johnston, turning off this side of Potato Hill, will expose my column as soon as it emerges from the gap. You can tell how far concealment is advisable for your purposes, and I am ready to act upon any suggestion you may make.

I am, general, your obedient, servant,

T. C. HINDMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
