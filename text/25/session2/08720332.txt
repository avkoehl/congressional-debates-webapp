APPENDTX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
May, 1838.
25th Cong—2nd Si s«s.
Treasury Note Bill—Mr. Rhett.
H. of Reps.
even upon the authority of this case, every State
jn the Union, despite the express prohibition to
"emit bills of credit," would be authorized to issue
these notes Oui minds are sometimes like our
eyesight, capable of seamg thing  only at very re-
mote distances Gentlemen who deny the con-
stitutionality of these Treasury notes, yet maintain
that Congress may establish a United States Bank,
and either a  part or the entire proprietor of the
stock, through its instrumentality, issue such notes,
to any amount, expressly designed to be currency
We have no right to issue these notes say these
gentlemen, because they may enter into the cur-
rency, yet, under the power "to regulate com-
merce," they maintain that we have the power to
supply a currency for the whole Union—and con-
trol and crush, if we please, all the banking insti-
tutions of the States Thus it is, that things which
are most obvious, are undiscerned, and the re-
motest inferences, and most metaphysical deduc-
tions, are apprehended with the cleaiest distinct-
ness and convietion During the whole period of
the last war, Treasury notes weie freeJy issued, in
all respects, similar to those authorized by the bill
Mr Dallas recommended them—Mr Madison ap-
proved of them, and Cheres, Randolph, C)a>,
Lowndes, and Webster filled some of the seats we
now occupy To thtsemen, ihe constitutional ob-
jection did not even occur
The following table show  the issues
1812—June  30     In Treasury notes
bearing interest of 5 and 2-5th per
cent redeemable m one year       -     §5,000,000
1833—Feb 25     Same interest, re-
deemable in one year      -           -     10,000,000
3814—March, 4    Same interest, re-
deemable in one year      -           -     10,000,000
1814—Dec 26   To be issued in In a
of that amount of loans heretofore
authorized            ...       7,500,000

1815—reb 24       Do        do          -     25,000,000
$60,500,0000
The next objection urged against the bill by my
honorable colleague is, that by the issue of the
Treasury notes it authorizes, a Govei lment bank
■will be established I cannot but suppose, Mr
Chairman, that mi colleague, in making this objec-
tion must have misapprehended the pre visions of
the bill lie must have supposed, to justify anj
thing hi e an argument in support of such a posi
tion, that, both as to time and the amount of the
issue the bill is entirely unlimited He cannot
be aware that no notes can be issued by its au-
thority, ifter the first day of December next, when
all are redeemable and thit the amount can at no
time exceed ten millions oí dollars A bank with-
out any capital, with a chaiterfor six months'
Surely the argument is answered by the statement
of the facts
It is «aid, however, that another form of borrow-
ing is better Go in at once lor a regulai loan on
time, by issuing stock for some % 10 000,000 That
will be prope1- and constitutional, and will be doing
the thingu a dignified manner Wow, Mr Chaii-
man, in the first place, no l"an such as gentlemen
propose for the time needed by the Government,
can be negotiated m this country, m the present
situation of the banks and the currency, unless the
Government will receive the irrtdeemable papel
of non soecie paying bank? If the object of gen-
tlemen is lo drive the Governmert into the arms of
these banks, and to implicate it with the irredeem
able currency of the country, foi the support of the
banks, certainly a loan in thei - paper will be a very
good way to accomplish the ouject, and place the
Government in their powei But if the loan is to be
negotiate d 11 specie, or the notes of specie paying
banks it cannot be done Would any such bank
or banks in the doubtful position in which they are
now placed, \ entire to take a loan of ten, or even
five millions of dollars, at the rate of five per cent
and pay for it in specie or by an issue oí their
notes'' Would individual capitalists do it? They
could scarcely obta.n the notes of specie paying
banks, or specie, with which to carry the loan into
effect There are now, I am told, not more than
nine millions of specie in New York, and but little
more than half of that amount of the notes of their
banks m circulation But could the capitalists or
the banks easily obtain the means, what inducement
would there be to take a loan for six months, which
the wants of the Treasury only require'2 What
compensation would there be in an investment for
so short a time, to induce the capitalist to call in
his bonds and mortgages, and sell his stock or real
estate? The same obstacle exists to the sale in this
country of the bonds of the United States, due to
the Government These bonds are of $2,000,000
each, one payable within six months, and the other
the year after Suppose, however, that the loan
could be effected in New York, how do gentlemen
reconcile this operation with their tender professions
of an exclusive regard for the welfare of the banks?
Theie would be created an immediate demand
upon the banks of New York for #10,000,000 in
specie, or their notes, convertible into specie Do
gentlemen want another crash—another stoppage
oí specie payments, upon which new changes may
be rung of the hostility of the Government, and
their own entire devotion to the banking institutions
of the country? A loan ought not to be effected in
the present situation of the banks It cannot be ef-
fected, unless made upon time, redeemable in some
five or ten years Gentlemen from the North may
go for such a measure They desire a debt upon
the country, and the greater, and the longer con-
tinued, the better for them But how will gentle
men from the South reconcile this policy with their
views of duty? To place a permanent debt upon
the country of $10,000,000, to meet an emergency
of but six months' necessity My colleague pro-
poses, however, that the loan should be negotiated
in Europe, and the amount brought back m specie
But this, sir, would be postponing Ihe cure until the
patient is dead The wants of the Treasury are
now, at the present time, chiefly within the next
two or three months Long before the loan could
be negotiated in Europe, and the avails be return-
ed, the Government will be bankrupt and disgraced
—its faith and its engagements dishonored If the
relief could be postponed for six months, why Hot
authorize the Secretary of the Treasury lo recall
back a portion of the amount deposited with the
Slates? That wou d be a far more Southein mea-
suic for then ihe amount contributed would be, as
it was deposited, upon the principle of direct taxa-
ti< n, and the South would not be compelled, through
indirect taxation by duties on importations, to pay
a disproportionate share of the contribution But
the most remarkable part of my colleague's propo-
sition is that the loan, when negotiated in Europe,
should be brought back to this country m specie He
has just made a mo,t elaborate argument to show
that every importation of specie fiom Europe must
necessarily depress the price ol our cotton To
him the importation oi the existence of specie
m the country brings no satisfaction, because it
is at the expense of our great staple, and conse-
quently injurious to the South Well, su, under
the increased abstraction of specie from Euiope,
which his operation will occasion, what will be-
come of oui cotton, declined and now declining in
Liverpool? If his argument is good, his whole
plan of relief will operate as a double injury to the
South, it will establish a debt, and depiess the price
of oui cotton The veins and aricnes will be
opened at the same time Sir my fricrd's project
l<r reuef will notdo The otl ei projects for aloan
will not do We must pass this bill, or disgrace
and dishonor the countrj If this measure stood
alone on its own m< fits, gentlemen know that it
would pass this House with sca~cely a difsentmg
voce Although the necessities of the Treasury
are far grpater and more immediate than at the ex
tra session, many gentlemen who tnen suppoited
the Trcasuiy bill to which this is an amendment,
opposf now most bitterly this measure Wny this
change? Why the combination so obvious to the
]pa 'observant, to defeat the bill? It is, sir because
gertlemen connect this measure with the Govern-
ment and the Government with the great financial
and political contest now waging in the country
In ordinary times, with $28 000,000 on deposite
wi h the Slates, and §15,000,000 due the Govern-
ment by the banks and individuals, one-half of which
will come into the Treasury within the next six
months, no man would think of denying to the Gr>«
vernment the use of its own credit for a few
months, in a form sanctioned by unbroken usage, at
the on ly period the necessities of the country required
its use No one, for such an emergency, would
think of proposing impracticable methods of relief
to the Government, and useless, if practicable
The idea would be spurned, that any triumph of
party, or measure of policy, could compensate the
country for the degiadation and dishonor which
would attend a violation of its faith and engage-
ments But unfortunately, sir, the country is divi-
ded—this House is divided, upon the great issue
which the president of the Pennsylvania Bank of the
United States, on the part of the banks, has present-
ed to the country The Government and the banks,
he says, are m the field face lo face, and one or the
other must be driven from it My colleague utters
the same opinion, and says that "a mortal conflict
is now waging between the Government and the
banks " I do not admit that any such contest ex-
ists m the Southern States, and especially on the
part of the banks of that State which I, in part, re-
present In that quarter of the Union, the banks
have the good sense to perceive that, if united to
the Government, the banks will soon become the
Government, or the Government the banks Pa-
tnotism and interest, therefore, in their estimation,
alike dictate an entire sepaiation of the Govern-
ment from the banking institutions of the country
But, sir, I agree with my friend that such a conflict
does exist m another part of the country I deny,
however, that this Government has made or seeks
the contest, or has placed itself in the field against
the banks On the contrary, if facts can show any
thing, they all show, if fairly viewed, that so far as
the present Government is concerned, it has neither
sought any contest, nor evinced any hostility, to the
banks of the country Suppose, sir, that the Specie
Circular was a catase of embarrassment ta the
bank0—did the Government do more than it had a
right to do with respect to its own property? Had
it not a right to sell or not to sell its own lands, and
to dictate the terms on which it would sell them?
Admit that the deposite of the surplus revenue with
the States was clumsily executed—were the banks,
in that operation, required to do more than they had
engaged to perform? Did they not, for compensa-
tion received, of their own accord, agree to do what
was required of them? and will any man seriously
assert, or expect others to believe, that these mea-
sures originated in hosh''ty to the banks? and that
implicated, as the Government was, with millions
on deposite with the banks—committed, as it was,
against the re establishment of an United States
Bank, contrary to every principle of duty or com
mon sense, it would seek a contest in which it had
nothing to gam, and every thing to fear, from the
combination of the banks and capitalists against its
measures and power? Even the corporation bank-
rupt law, so much declaimed against, suggested by
the President of the United Slates, but which receiv-
ed no support in this House, meditated no hostility
to banks, but was only intended to apply to those
banks which should cease to be banks, by becoming
insolvent Sir, it is a truth unquestionable, that if
the banks had fulfilled their own promises and en-
gagements, the idea that this Government had war
red upon them never would have been raised, and
if they have not been able to meet their engage-
ments, m their too eager pursuit of gam, who is lo
blame but themselves? The Government did not
control their issues, nor has it taken away [any of
'hen means to meet them On the contrary, since
their suspension of specie payments, what indul-
gence has been refused on the part of the Govern-
ment, that their warmest frieuds have required,
- consistent with the laws and the safety of the reve-
nue? What functionary of the Government—what
member on this floor, or m the other wing of the
Capitol, has expressed any hostility to these institu-
tions? The real ground for offence—the whole war—
exists in the proposition to separate the Govern-
ment from all connection with the banks The
banks do not like the separation, and, because it is
pioposed by the Government, they declare that it is
war To have nothing to do with them, and to
leave them unmolested in the full enjoyment of all
their chartered privileges, i¡> atrocious hostility,
