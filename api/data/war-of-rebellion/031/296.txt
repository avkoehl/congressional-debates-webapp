fell whilst rallying his men, and also the severely wounding of Capts. Aaron Ward, Company D, and William C. Shinn, Company I. Captain Samuel Harris, Company F, Second Lieutenant William B. Pepper, Company F, First Lieutenant James J. Reeves, Company H, and Second Lieutenant James P. Butler, Company K, were also wounded. It is also with great regret that I report that First Lieutenant Alexander L. Robeson, commanding Company H, is still missing, and it is presumed that he fell whilst gallantly leading his men.

A large number of the men of the regiment have been injured (a report of which you have already received). Many of them are sick from exposure, having lost their blankets and shelter-tents in the field.

Respectfully submitted.
