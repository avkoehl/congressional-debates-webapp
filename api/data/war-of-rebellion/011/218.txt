FARMINGTON, May 27, 1862.

Major-General BUELL:

I have just sent an officer to General Halleck to explain my views. I don't quite like the orders.

JNumbers POPE,

Major-General, Commanding.

CAMP ON CORINTH ROAD, May 27, 1862.

Major-General BUELL:

You will make a forced reconnaissance on your front to-morrow morning to ascertain the position and strength of the enemy's works. There will be a general advance on the right and left. Keep me fully advised of your movements.

H. W. HALLECK.

Major-General D. C. BUELL:

All right. Feel the enemy on the other side; and, if possible, ascertain the position of his batteries. This may involve some risk, but we must ascertain in this way his strength and position.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General.

WASHINGTON, May 27, 1862.

All right. Feel the enemy on the other side; and, if possible, ascertain the position of his batteries. This may involve some risk, but we must ascertain in this way his strength and position.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General.

WASHINGTON, May 27, 1862.

General J. T. BOYLE, Louisville, Ky.:

You are relieved from the command of your brigade before Corinth, and are directed to report to the Military Board of Kentucky, to take command of the forces in Kentucky. You will please acknowledge the receipt of this order. The Department, in making this order, believes that your presence in Kentucky for the specified purposes will be of more advantage to the service than if you were to return to your command before Corinth, on account of your intimate knowledge of the requirements of the service in your State and your experiences and discretion.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

BUELL'S HEADQUARTERS, May 27, 1862.

General HALLECK:

After some sharp skirmishing my troops have driven the enemy beyond Bridge Creek, opposite my right and Sherman's left. The enemy appear to be in some force on the high ground on the opposite side of Bridge Creek.

D. C. BUELL,

Major-General.
