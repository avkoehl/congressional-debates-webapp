LEXINGTON, December 4, 1864.

Brigadier General HUGH EWING,

Louisville, Ky.:

Keep your command well in hand ready for any emergency; there seems to be good reason for anticipating an invasion of Eastern Kentucky. Should it occur you must spare every available man and send here, if needed, any troops en route through Louisville. Be vigilant, and if called on for troops have them in such shape they can move at once.

By order of Brevet Major-General Burbridge:

J. BATES DICKSON,

Captain and Assistant Adjutant-General.

SMITHLAND, December 4, 1864.

Brigadier-General MEREDITH:

SIR: Steamers Mars reports being fired into both artillery and musketry eighteen miles this side of Nashville, Tenn.

HENRY P. REED,

Captain, Commanding Post.

WAR DEPARTMENT,

December 5, 1864 -11.55 a. m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

It appears from an order of Schofield's that he had assigned Stoneman to duty as second in command of the Department of the Ohio. Generals Thomas and Schofield both wish him to hold that position. If you approve of his so doing I am content, although I think him one of the most worthless in the service and who has failed in everything instructed to him. Please say whether he had better be restored to the command given by Schofield, or whether Ammen should not be the chief in command in Schofield's absence. If so, send the order to Adjutant-General Townsend.

EDWIN M. STANTON.

CITY POINT, VA., December 5, 1864 - 1 p. m.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Washington:

I am not in favor of using officers who have signally failed when instructed with commands in important places. Again, as a general rule, when an officer is instructed with the command of a department, he ought to be allowed to use the material given him in his oven way. I would simply suggest the transmission of this to General Schefield, and leave it discretionary then with him to employ General Stoneman, or relieve him from duty, as he deems best.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
