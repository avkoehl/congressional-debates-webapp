Brigadier General JAMES E. SLAUGHTER,

Chief of Staf, Hdqrs. Dist. of Texas, &amp;c., Houston:

GENERAL: I have the honor to report my arrival at this place. From the report of the officer in charge of my pickets I find that the enemy on the 25th instant were on Saluria Island, in force of at least 5,000 men. General Warren's command on the evacuation of Indianola consisted of fourteen regiments, of an average strength of about 350 each. He had eight rifled 6-pounders, four 12-pounders, and two 12-pounder rifled guns. The town of Powder Horn was well fortified against an attack by land both above and below. The place is a perfect wreck, and at least one-third of the houses destroyed or removed. All the money, jewels, plate, &c.,that could be obtained were carried off. The impression left on the minds of the citizens from conversations overheard was that the main part of the command was destined for Louisiana, and that the invasion of Texas would be made from that direction.
