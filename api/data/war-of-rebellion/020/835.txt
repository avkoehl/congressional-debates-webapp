that upon further reflection he desires the torpedoes intended for the Cooper River to be placed in the Ashley river, in the best positions to protect the bridge over that stream, and also to give due notice to all vessels, boats, crafts, &amp;c., that may have to pass in that locality.

Brigadier General R. S. RIPLEY,

Commanding First Military District, Charleston, S. C.:

GENERAL: In view of the possible contingency of a night reconnaissance by the enemy on Morris or even Sullivan's Island it is the wish of the general commanding that you should so dispose your cavalry, for a time at least, that you may be able to place more cavalry to watch the beach at night, especially of the former island.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

THOMAS JORDAN,

Chief of Staff.
HDQRS. DEPT. SOUTH CAROLINA, GEORGIA, AND FLORIDA,Charleston, S. C., March 18, 1863.

Brigadier General R. S. RIPLEY,

Commanding First Military District, Charleston, S. C.:

GENERAL: The Citadel Cadets, under Major White, having been ordered to report to me in case of an attack on this city, can they not be used to guard and defended the battery at the new bridge? They might go there to practice every day, although living at the Citadel, for it is not desirable to put them in camp at present.

Captain Thomas, of Columbia, has offered me a company, raised by himself, for the defense of the city, which might be employed in guarding the works on the other side of the new bridge, or with other detached companies, also promised, to guard the lines on the Neck. All these companies will be ordered to report to you; hence it would be well to determine first where they are to be sent. Can be guns on Castle Pickney be made to bear on Cooper River where torpedoes are to be placed hereafter; if not, what guns can? I have ordered these torpedoes to b put in the Ashley River first, to guard the railroad bridge. Could not an arrangement be made for communicating on foot at low tide from Cummings Point to Fort Johnson? I am going to order some works on Hatch Island (not the one we looked at), to take Morris Island in flank and reverse with siege rifled guns.

Cannot graduated sights be fixed to nearly all our heavy guns? They would add greatly to their usefulness.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. T. BEAUREGARD,

General, Commanding.
