regiment in this department. If an order to this effect can be obtained, it is confidently believed that nearly every man of that regiment in this department will re-enlist. Their term of service has nearly expired. The regiment is one of the best in the service. Respectfully, your obedient servant,

RICHARD ARNOLD,

Brigadier-General, Chief of cavalry.

[Second indorsement.]
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF WEST MISSISSIPPI,New Orleans, La., June 28, 1864.

Respectfully referred to Major-General Rosecrans, commanding Department of the Missouri, who will direct the battalion to be reported to the chief of cavalry, department of the Gulf, if there should be no pressing necessity for its retention in Missouri, If necessary it will be replaced by an equal number.

By order of Major-General Canby:

B. F. MOREY,

Captain and Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.

[Third indorsement.]
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE MISSOURI,Saint Louis, July 9, 1864.

Respectfully returned to the major-general commanding Military Division of West Mississippi, with the information that my department has already been stripped of troops to a very alarming extent. I think that ordering the battalion out of the department without replacing in by other troops (which I cannot get) would be very detrimental to the interests of the service.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General, Commanding.

[Fourth indorsement.]
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF WEST MISSISSIPPI,New Orleans, La., July 21, 1864.

Respectfully returned.

The battalion will be ordered to report as directed in indorsement of June 28, 1864. It will be replaced by an equal number.

By order of Major General E. R. S. Canby:

B. F. MOREY,

Captain and Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
