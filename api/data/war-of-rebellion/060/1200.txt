Brigadier-General RANSOM,

A. R. LAWTON,

Quartermaster-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF CAPE FEAR,Wilmington, February 28, 1864.

General BRAXTON BRAGG,

Richmond:

GENERAL: I beg leave to call your attention to the necessity of providing for this post a sufficient garrison to insure it against surprise. This necessity always exists, and that it may be fully considered permit me to lay before you two or three letters* on the subject addressed to the Adjutant and Inspector General of the Army. Memoirs, maps, and correspondence with the War Department will serve for a full understanding of this position, its importance, the means of defense and their application.

Upon these letters Kemper's brigade was assigned to me, but the New Berne expedition was ordered, of which that formed part. Since then I am not aware that it is at my disposal. My great need is to have such an addition to the permanent garrison as to enable me to prevent the works at the mouth of the river from being turned or surprised. I cannot do this as things now are.

Very respectfully,

W. H. C. WHITING,

Major-General.

He also reported that Kilpatrick has gone through Spotsylvania. Please notify Colonel Johnson, at Hanover Junction.

W. H. TAYLOR,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
