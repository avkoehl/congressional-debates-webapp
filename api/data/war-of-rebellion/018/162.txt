is now guarding 30 miles of this road, performing duties so arduous that the health of them men is threatened. I would ask that, in consideration of the Twenty-eight Regiment Pennsylvania Volunteers having guarded 26 miles of The Potomac for seven months under trying circumstances and borne in confidence of more active duties in the field upon the company assuming its present form, we may be permitted to throw ourselves upon your kindness and be relived from this class of duty, of which we have had a goodly share. The command is excellently drilled and tried and are well caparisoned to do active service in the field, to which they look forward with all confidence that a consideration of their performance of arduous duties have been taken cognizance of. Any order or effort on your part, general, to relieve the present position of the command will be greatly prized by all my officers and men as well as myself.

Very respectfully, &amp;c.,

JNO. W. GEARY,

Colonel Twenty-eighth Pennsylvania Volunteers.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

General Shields defers his march to Monday, and desires me to remain. Unless otherwise directed, I will delay the march of my command until Sunday (to-morrow) evening. I have been ready to march at an hour's notice since my orders were received. General Shields desired that we should move together if possible. I will reach Strasburg Tuesday morning, or immediately if required.

N. P. BANKS,

Major-General, Commanding.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

No important change in affairs. Ewell is still this side of the Blue Ridge, apparently tending southward. One brigade is reported by deserters who left his camp yesterday to have fallen back to the Rapidan near Gordonsville. Jackson is believed to be near Stauton by our scouts and the country people. A reconnaissance in force was made to-day to the town (Harrisonburg), of which no report is yet received.

N. P. BANKS,

Major-General, Commanding.

Am here where the wire was broken, determining who of the neighborhood shall be held responsible. Arrived this morning, and am in camp with both brigades 2 miles south of Franklin, leaving our former ground at the village for Blenker's division as it shall arrive.
