Honorable E. M. STANTON:

Special order received requiring the sending of 200 unassigned men of the Sixteenth New York Artillery to the Sixth New York Heavy Artillery, Army of the Potomac. Colonel Morrison, commanding, reports that when those ordered to be discharged become unfit for service and transferred to the Veteran Reserve Corps, and those who have voluntarily enlisted to fill up other New York regiments in this department are taken from his regiment, there will be none left. I can send 443, not a man of whom is fit for duty, and never was since they were enlisted in the regiment. I await instructions, but we have no unassigned recruits of that regiment.
