Mr. HILLIARD offered the following resolu-
tion:
Resolved, That a committee be appointed, on the part of
the House, to join such committee as may he appointed on
the part of the Senate, to wait on the President of the
United States, and to inform him that a quorum of the two
Houses is now in session, and that Congress is ready to
receive any communication he may he pleased to make. ;
A message was here received from the Senate
by the hands of Asbury Dickins, Esq., Secre-
tary, informing the House that a quorum of the
Senate had assembled, and that that body was
ready, to proceed to business.
Mr. JONES said he wished to precede the mo-
tion of the gentleman from Alabama [Mr. Hil-
liard] with a motion that the Clerk of the House i
acquaint the Senate that a quorum of the House
, had assembled, and was ready to proceed to busi-
The question being put, the motion was agreed
to, and the Clerk directed accordingly.
Mr. PEASLEE stated that Mr. George W.
Morrison, the member elect from the 3d Con-
gressional District of the State of New Hamp-
shire, to fill the vacancy occasioned by the resig-
nation of Mr. James Wilson, was present with
his credentials and ready to qualify.
Mr. DIMMICK also introduced Mr. Joel B.
Danner, member elect from the 15th Congres-
sional District of Pennsylvania, to fill the vacancy
occasioned by the death of the Hon. Henry Nes,
and asked that he be qualified.
These gentlemen presented themselves at the
bar, and were qualified by the Speaker adminis-
tering to them the usual oath to support the Con-
stitution of the United States
Mr. TUCK presented the memorial of Jared
Perkins, contesting the seat claimed by George
' W. Morrison, a Representative from the 3d Con-
gressional District of New Hampshire; which
was referred to the Committee of Elections,
i The question was then taken on the resolution
■ of Mr. Hilliard, and it was adopted; and the
Speaker appointed Messrs. Hilliard, MeDow.
; ell, and Duer, the committee on the part of the
House.
Mr. JOHNSON, of Arkansas, submitted the
following resolution:
Resolved, That the Clerk of the House, immediately after
the passage of this resolution, place In a box the name of
each member and delegate of the House of Representatives
j upon a separate piece of paper; that he then proceed, in the
presence of the House, to draw from said box, one at a time,
said pieces of paper, and as such is drawn he shall announce
• the name of the member upon it, who shall then choose his
seat for the present session: Provided, That before said
drawing shall commenoe, the Speaker shall cause every
seat to be vacated, and shall see that each seat continues
I vacant until it is selected under this order.
i Mr, EVANS, of Maryland, inquired of the
! Speaker whether the Delegates from the Territories'
J were included within the resolution.
j The SPEAKER replied in the negative.
I Mr. STEPHENS, of Georgia, I will move to
amend that resolution so as to provide that any
member may select a seat for a friend who may
be in the city, but sick and unable to be present.
(Loud cries of no! no!) I will merely state that
my colleague [Mr. Owen] came on with me and
is now sick in this city. There may probably be
other gentlemen who have friends in the same
condition. I only wish my amendment to include
gentlemen who are sick in the city. I do not
mean to embrace those who are not here. I am
clearly of opinion that the best way to secure a
good attendance at the commencement of the ses-
sion is to draw for seats upon the first day; but
when gentlemen are here in the city, but sick and
unable to attend, I think some friend ought to have
the privilege of selecting seats for them.
Mr. JOHNSON. I will state to the gentleman
that I will not accept his amendment, because I
Frefer that a vote of the House be taken upon it.
think it, however, just and right, and I shall vote
for it.
Mr. EVANS. There are some members sick
who are not in the city, and I do not see why the
same privilege should not be extended to them. I
cannot see the propriety of making any distinction
between those sick in the city, and those sick
elsewhere. I will, therefore, move to amend the
amendment so as to include all members who are
sick.
Mr. JOHNSON. I shall certainly object to
that amendment. It is their misfortune if they are
not here, and we who are here, and whom this
rule has brought here, are entitled to the first
choice of seats. If they are unable to get here,
it is their misfortune. I call for the previous
question.
The call for the previous question was, how-
ever, waived at the request of
Mr. SCHENCK, who suggested that the
amendment should be modified so as to specify the
member from Georgia, to whose case it was in-
tended to apply.
Mr. STEPHENS accepted the modification,
and the resolution was modified by adding the
following, viz:
" And that one of the colleagues of Mr. Owen^DfGeorgia,
be allowed to select a seat for him, he being sick in this
city."
The call for the previous question was then sec-
onded, and the mam question ordered.
The amendment to the amendment offered by
Mr. Evans, of Maryland, was rejected.
The question recurring on the amendment offered
by Mr. Stephens, of Georgia, it was put and
carried in the affirmative.
The resolution as amended was then adopted.
A message was here received from the Senate,
by the hands of A. Dickins, Esq., their Secretary,
informing the House that the Senate had appointed
a committee, to act wi£h such committee as may be
appointed by the House, to wait on the President
of the United States, and inform him that a quo-
rum of the two Houses had assembled, and were
ready to receive any communication which he
might be pleased to make.
The SPEAKER. Under the rule just adopted,
the House will proceed at once to draw for seats.
The gentlemen will, however, retain their seats
for a moment.
The Chair will state to the House before the
drawing commences, that under the usual practice
of the House, the names of all the members are
placed in a box and drawn. There are, however,
two newly-elected members, who have not been
sworn in. The Chair supposes that they are not
yet members of the House, and has directed that
their names be not placed in the box. He desires
to place that fact before the House, in order that
he may be corrected if he is in error.
Mr. STEPHENS, of Georgia. I hope their
names will be put in if they are present.
The SPEAKER. But they are not present,
and could not select their seats even if their names
were drawn.
The members all vacated their seats and re-
paired to the area in front of the Speaker's chai^r.
The SPEAKER. I have to request that
