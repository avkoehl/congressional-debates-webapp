I have been asked by a colleague who sits behind me [Mr

originated in a supposed inconsistency on my pait, masking

These, sir, in mye*umauon, are fit parallels to exhibit the
conduct of Congress in relation to mterrsal improvements^ as
conducts 1 during the fasf nine years
My colleague [Mi Popíe] seems to he as much surprised at
my coiue as my colleague, [Mr SouthgatsJ Neither of
those g ntlemen was here duung the last Congress, and neither
could l"ve examined the journal to ascertain how I then
voted fiad that been done, they would at least have found me
consist nt wpth myself My colleague [Mr Pope) adverts eo
the app opnations to send out an Exploring Expedition to the
South -as, and the $100,000 voted to the heirs of Fulton, as if
they ar rded countenance to the grant of é359 000 to the Cum-
bertan oadm the pre ent exhausted condition of the Treasury.
These ireceden's have not been set by my consent J oppose
both 11 setting on loot the imploring Expedition, the conaüct
of Con ess resembled mat of a young spendthrift, who wastes
his est e rambling abioad m pursuit of"pleasures and fancied
good, t > the neglect of his mote important and more profitable
busme at home, and a-* to the Fulton appropriation, it was
in my j ulsrmenta donation, which Congress refused to call by
its pioj ti name, and pas&ed it through under the delusive idea
of settl   g a debt
There is yet, Mr Speaker, an important argument against
my pro osition to be considered It has been gravely urged
heie that Congress was bound by compact to finish the Cum-
berland toadlo the Mississippi river, that the faith of the nation
was plei ged to do it Gentlemen have asserted this with as
much se ousness as if it was founded in truth, and were it not
that the «ravi-ly of then cojntenances rather forbids it, one
might bf Imposed to smite at their errois and credulity on this
point Lat us examine if If my proposition violates any
compact r pledged laith, as soon as I am convinced I will
in tantly withdraw it Tne act of 30th April, I&02, tendering
terms to t ie people of Ohio for their assent previous to their
entering t e Umon, a"d to wheh they did assent, offers them
one tweuti th part, or five per cent on the nett piocecds of the
sales of pu die land  tyirg ip then State, to be expended under
the authoi ty of Congress m 'laying out and making pubhc
loalsleadi g from the navigable wafers emptying into the
Atlantic to the Ohio to the said State, and through the same ""
The act « f 19th April, 1816, tendering terms to the people of
Indiana ofUrs them fve percent on the nett pi oceeds of sales

and can tis three fifth> *o be applied by (he i own Legislature,
and "two fiiths to tlic makirg of a load or roads leading- to th©
said State, undei the direction of Congiess. '

fllirois oflus them five percent on the nett proceeds of the

The ine^omg acts of Congress constitute the basis upon
which tl e ^¿^¿ra/fcmufconunning -he Cu aiberland road to the
Mississip, 11 mstr st, if'h^re be any, and I invite the special
attention ot n y colleague [Mr fcouTHGATE] to their provisions.
Ialao beg him to notice othei tcts to which I shall refer, and
then ask himself whethei ' the ra iral and legal obligation to
extend this road to the Mis&issippi" is any thing more than a
created phai torn of his own vivid imagination^
It is perie ity clear, bom the foregoing acts that there was
not the sha i w of an obligation imposed Upon Congress to
make a road in eithei of the thiee States 1 admit, however,
there was an obligation imposed to make a road, or roads, Uad
mg to each of said States, so iar as the tv, o per cent fund would
accomplish r In (h£ cas° ol Ohio, the stipulation is to con-
nect the Alia i tie and Western wnt l*, but no such provision is
made inrela i m to Indiana and Illinois It weuld be acompli-
anee with tht ontract to construct roads leading io their bor-
deib irom Ah ugan and Misaomi, oi any other quarter Con-
gie & has however undertaken to fulfil its obligation by mak
msrtheCum' rlandroad, and thus not only to fulfil it to the
letter, by ma mg roads leading /othe&e S ates, but to give each
agieateiadv tage by likewise making the road in their re
spettiveterr ilea Of this I will not complain, although
three percent has been allowed two of these States to male
roads withm11 r limits whenever theypltased OntheSSth
of March, 180 Oongress passed an act for l-iyingoutand mak
ing the road horn Cumb'nland, uptn the Potomac, to the Ohio
rivei This w as the commencement of satiaf) mg the obliga
tion to Ohio and, m this act of 1*306 the sum of thirty thousand
dollars was ap¡ ropna'td Kut in oider to show that it was not
bound to exptt 1 m making the road more than the two per
cent whieh h-u been set apart loi be object, Cungrtss careful-
ly inserted m íl o act of 180b a provision, making the sum ap.
piopuated "chi geabl^ uj on and reimbursable at, theTreasu
ry hy said font ot two per cent as the same shall accrue "
On the l^th oí S ay 1820 Corgrees commenced the discharge
of its obligation^ to Indiana and Illinois, by pas&mg an act pro-
v dmg fot layin out and continuing t\& Cumberland road frem

that might be se up, of a "moral and legal obligation" to com-
