BROWNSVILLE STATION, June 11, 1864.

Brigadier General E. A. CARR, Devall's Bluff:

I have just arrived here with my command. The country if flooded with water and the bayous almost impassable. From all the information I can gather here it will be almost impossible to cross the swamps on the road leading to Pine Bluff at present. My mules are all new and hard to manage. What time will pass this station on your return to Little Rock?

Colonel Thirteenth Illinois Cavalry, Commanding

PINE BLUFF, June 11, 1864.

Captain C. H. DYER, Assistant Adjutant-General:

I arrived here late last evening. Have been all through the Clear Lake, Plum Bayou, and Flat Bayou districts. There are no rebel forces in them except guerrillas. The water is so high that I do not believe I can get over on the Watesca and Rattlesnake Bayous. Shall leave here in two hours.

O. WOOD,

Colonel.
