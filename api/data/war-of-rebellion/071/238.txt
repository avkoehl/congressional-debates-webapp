General HARDIN,

Commanding at Fort Reno:

Send Lowell is as soon as he arrives in from scouting. Are there any indications of the enemy having broken ground in your front?

There are no indications of enemy breaking ground, &amp;c.

M. D. HARDIN.
HEADQUARTERS TWENTY-SECOND ARMY CORPS,July 12, 1864. (Received 11. 30 a. m.)

General AUGUR:

General Hardin applied yesterday for ammunition for carbine and pistol. No return has been received. It should be attended to at once. There is no indication of infantry in Hardin's front. The enemy is operating exclusively here. I think with cavalry at least a regiment of heavy artillery, if it can be spared from the Sixth Corps, should be in these works. The defense needs at least strength enough to resist until re-enforced from Stevens. Hardin's headquarters are being moved to Tennallytown.

J. H. TAYLOR,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

FORT RENO, July 12, 1864.

(Received 12 m.)

Major-General AUGUR:

I think the citizens living within range of the guns of the forts should be notified to go into town with such articles as they can take.

M. D. HARDIN,

Brigadier-General.

TENNALLYTOWN, July 12, 1864.

(Received 3 p. m.)

General AUGUR:

I have ordered all the cavalry back on the infantry picket-line. I do not think the enemy have any infantry in front of Reno, left of Rockville road, except a small force supporting the guns we have seen.

M. D. HARDIN,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
