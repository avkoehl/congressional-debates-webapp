equal to nearly twenty-three million dollars iu
currency, which in fifteen years makes an
aggregate of $345,000,000.
If the debt is payable in gold it must run to
maturity at six per cent, interest in gold, for it
is impossible now to procure the means of pay-
ing this great debt; but if it may lawfully be
redeemed in "greenbacks" it can soon be paid
or funded at a less rate of interest. But shall
'"greenbacks" be issued to pay at once the
whole debt ? I answer no. The whole debt is
not yet redeemable. Of the $1,615,185,350 of
bonds $514,780,500 are now redeemable, and
the residue at different periods. The amount
of currency should be measured by the busi-
ness wants of the country, and beyond this
there should be no inflation, because this would
disturb all values, change the relation of debtor
and creditor, depreciate our currency, and pro-
duce bankruptcy and ruin far beyond any sav-
ing of interest effected on the public debt. It
should be remembered, too, that such an issue
of greenbacks would not pay the debt. They
would constitute a liability to be paid sooner
or later by taxes collected from the people, for
no one anticipates an endless debt in any form.
Our policy is not to inflate and depreciate the
currency, but to consult the substantial inter-
ests of the productive industry of the country.
But the Government has the right to oiler
to the holders of the bonds now redeemable,
and those hereafter to become so, the option
to receive payment in "greenbacks" or in
Government bonds running on long time and
at a less rate of interest than is now payable.
If the Treasury, from taxes or otherwise, can-
not supply thegreenbacks they can be borrowed,
as they were during the rebellion, either on new
bonds payable in greenbacks or gold, as may
be most advantageous to the public.
This will work no injustice to bondholders.
It is a faithful performance of the national ob-
ligation. The right of redemption was reserved
to be exercised l'or the public benefit. It leaves
the investment iu bonds, at least, fairly remu-
nerative. They were paid for, not in gold, but
in greenbacks. The average price of gold and
greenbacks has been thus stated for four years
preceding I860:

The average price of gold in greenbacks for
the four years was $1 48 9-10, and the average
value in gold of greenbacks was $0 08 5-10.
(Hays' Heport to Secretary of the Treasury,
January, lyGO ; New York Social Science lie-
view, April, 1800, vol. 2, Nos. 1 and 2.)
Public creditors who paid for bonds with
greenbacks at sixty-eight m gold have no right
to complain if they are paid iu greenbacks
worth, as now, seventy-one cents in gold. The
interest they liave received at six per cent, in
gold has been worth eight per cent, in green-
backs, and has been free from all State tax.
With greenbacks at sixty-eight in gold when
loaned to the Government the gold value in-
vested has produced a rate of interest equal to
nearly nine per cent, in coin.
The public debt, so far as it cannot be paid,
should be put on a less expensive rate of in-
terest as rapidly as it is or may become redeem-
able or may be practicable. This can be done
and the bonds left at par in currency. The
bonds are now at a premium. The quotations
at the stock-board in Hew York for a given
day in February, 1867 and 1868, were :

Prior to the war our national six per cent,
bonds commanded a premium of sixteen per
cent.
Gold is now worth a premium of over forty
per cent, on greenbacks.
THE KATE 01? INTEREST.
If new bonds, bearing four per cent, inter-
est in coin, or five per cent, in currency, at
the option of the Government, should now be
issued in exchange for greenbacks, the holders
would have a profitable investment. If green-
backs should be estimated at eighty cents and
gold at 125 the annual interest would be five
per cent, gold interest on gold value invested ;
five per cent, currency interest on currency
value invested; six and one fourth per cent,
currency interest on gold value invested; and
if the principal of the bonds be made payable
in gold there would be the additional profit
between the currency investment and the gold
payment.
The legal rate of interest in most of the
States does not exceed six per cent, in cur-
rency, and in some cases subject to tax. It is
true sometimes the limitation and the tax are
alike evaded; but nations should always borrow
moncy.at lower rates than individuals, because
they pay without the risks and expenses attend-
ing individual loans.
On the 6th January, 1860, British three per
cent, consols were worth in London eighty-
seven and one eighth per cent, in gold, equiva-
lent to a rate of interest of throe and four
sevenths per cent. A British consol bearing-
three and four sevenths per cent, interest, was
therefore worth par. On November 1, 1807,
consols sold at ninety-four and a half cents.
If it be conceded that the greater abundance
of capital there will secure money at a less rate
of interest, our national credit should at least
command equal confidence.
It is true, also, that in this country the annual
increase of wealth is greater than in England,
and henee we can afford to pay a larger interest,
fn 1801 the real and personal property in Eng-
land was estimated at $31,512,000,000, with an
annual increase of three per cent. The value
of real and personal estate in the United States
by the census of 18G0, was $10,159,010,068.
The gross earnings of the entire people
during the fiscal year 1800, were estimated at
50,704,024,000; the consumption at $0,085,-
403,259; net earnings, $709,100,781; being
five per cent, on the capital value of all the
property. (Social Science Review, vol. 2, Nos.
1 and 2, page 2'j, for I860.)
The actual increase in wealth is thus shown

But this includes additions by new farms,
immigration, &c., so that the net earnings of
the people do not exceed five per cent, on the
total capital, and the nation, therefore, cannot
afford to pay exorbitant rates of interest.
WHY ENGLAND WAS OUK ENEMY—CAUSE OF HIGH BATE
OF INTEREST.
During the rebellion various causes com-
bined to require a high rate of interest. _ Eng-
land sent out from her ports pirate ships to
prey upon our commerce, while the great
Democratic party of the North, scarcely les3
piratical, attacked the national credit, de-
stroyed all foreign market for our bonds, and
induced our European rivals to aid the rebel
cause. The capitalists of Europe, save only in
Germany, to a limited extent, refused to buy
our bonds and the loyal people of the Republic,
almost alone and unaided, supplied^ the sinews
of war. The life of the nation was in peril and
doubt. But now, with the Republic saved,
new loans should be effected on better terms.
The first loans made on the national credit,
soon after the Government was organized, were
mainly at an annual interest of six per cent.,
and now in the maturer years of the Republic
better terms should be secured.
KEEP THE BONDS IN TIIIK COUNTRY.
"When the national bonds are renewed our
policy should be to discourage their sale abroad
by providing that if so sold the rate of interest
should not thereafter exceed three per cent, in
currency.
It is estimated that §000,000,000 of our
bonds are now in Europe sold at seventy cent?
on the dollar for brandies, wines, silks, and
other fabrics. (See Finance Rep. 1856, p. 12.)
On this we are to pay $36,000,000 annual
interest in coin, equal to $45,000,000 in cur-
rency, and if we adopt the theory of Mr. Mc-
Culloch, ultimately pay the principal in gold.
A nation whose bonds are sold at seventy, to
be paid in par after receiving that seventy in
commodities which destroy its own productive
industry is on the high road to bankruptcy.
Europe holds $200,000,000 of our State,
city, and railroad bonds, requiring annually
$12,000,000 for interest.
During the past year we imported ninety mil-
lion pounds of wool, worth $25,000,000 in gold.
For the three years ending June 30, 1867, our
imports were $1,038,009,207 gold value, equal
to nearly fifteen hundred million dollars in
currency, and in four years coin has been
carried out of the country to pay for foreign
goods amounting to $302,099,2-53. (House
Ex. Doe. 2, 2d Sess. 40th Cong., Deltnar
Rep., 390.
For the year ending June 30, 1807, the bal-
ance of foreign trade was $51,000,000 in gold
against us, besides $48,000,000 for interest on
bonds. On the 30th November, 1867, our five-
twenty six per cent, bonds sold in London at
seventy and five-eighth cents, while New Bruns-
wick and Cape of Good Hope six per cents,
sold at 105, Russian five per cents, at eighty-
five, and Brazilian five per cents, at seventy-
five. (House Ex. Doc. 81, 2d Sess. 40th
Cong., 24.)
Our policy should be to reduce our imports,
put an end to the exports of gold, discourage
the ruinous traffic in our bonds abroad, and
supply more extensively the wants of our peo-
ple with the products of our own industry.
If the capitalists of Emope refused onr
bonds in war thev should not reap golden
harvests from them now iu tune of peace. I
agree with the Secretary ot the Treasury, who,
in his annual report, sa\ s :
Lvery tax-payer is per.-maily interested in hav-
ing tut, public debt placed lit iionie, and at a io wrate
ot intercut.
Within the hour allotted to me I cannot dis-
cuss the subject of taxation, and I leave it,
therefore, for another occasion.
Great as is our debt, the American people
ill maintain iuviulate faith, preserve the
national honor untarnished, and pay it to the
uttermost larthing. If we now adopt a wise
