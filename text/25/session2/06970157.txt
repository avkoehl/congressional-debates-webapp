25th Covg-"'2nd Sess.                           Making public officen depositane—Mr. Smith.                                                         Senate.
tion law, in thf- recommendation of President Van
Buren to the people, of a simple and safe method to
keep and take care of their own money, instead of
confiding it to the care of faithless corporations,
•who, when they had got into their possession
nearly thirty millions of dollars of the public mo-
ney, shut their doors against them, and laughed to
scorn every attempt of the people to withdraw it
from their clutches, and, moreover, boasted of
their power and disposition to block the wheels of
Government, and bring to their feet the Govern-
ment of the people, an humble suppliant.
Mr S said the general principles of the bill be-
fore the Senate, he was satisfied with, and, if adopt-
ed, would accomplish all he desired, and that was,
to separate the public treasure and business from
the money and business of the banks, and of all
individuals, and would gradually bring the curren-
cj to be received for the dues of the Government
to the constitutional provision, and standard, and
thi;>, he had good reason to believe, would be en-
tirely satisfactory to the people, and he was satis-
fied it was demanded by them The Government
then would have no cause of complaint from the
conflicts arising from the intermingling of private
business with the public, against the banks, or in-
dividuals connected with them, and as it has no
power or control over them, they would have no
light orjust claims upon the Government to inspire
them w,th the vital spark, which they, by theirown
constitutional infirmities, weakness, or folly in their
management, had extinguished Until he could
hear some argument irom the opponents of the
bill, which would weaken his convictions of the
soundness, and, as he deemed them, unanswerable
reasons and arguments of the Senitor fiom New
York, [Mr Wright,] in support of the bill, he had
no wish to go into the details ot it, to substantiate
what, m Im opinion, had been clearly proved, and
no attempt by argument had been made to refute
it And all the remarks he felt disposed to make
upon this part-of the subject, would be designed to
show the impropriety of depositing for safe-keep-
ing the public money m banks, and with individu-
als, who were not constitutional or legal officers of
the Government, and amenable to the people as
such, and the unfitness of the circulating medium
furnished by the banks, as a general currency That
banks, established upon sound and correct princi-
ples, may furnish a commercial credit, or circulat-
ing papor, which mightbe useful, and highly bene-
ficial, not only to the mercantile, but to other
classes of men whose business occasionally re-
quires additional and tempoiary capital, he was
not disposed to deny
Mr S said that before he proceeded to sugeest
some of the reasons which operated on his mind
to influence his vote against the substitute proposed
by the Senator from Virginia, [Mr Rives,] he
would briefly notice some of we prominent objec-
tions to the bill made by the Senator from Massa-
chusetts, [Mr Webster ] The Senator asks if a
hostile army should invest the Capitol, and Go-
vernment were to withdraw from the same, and
leave the enemy without opposition, would not the
Government shrink from its duty'' Would not the
public functionaries separate themselves from their
duty? I answer, jes And I ask the honorable
Senator if a hostile army should not only invest
the Capitol, but should set fire to it and burn it
down, ana the agents of the people—members of
Congress—weie to reluse the r aid in furnishing
the necessary means to rebui d it, would not the
public functionaries separate themselves from their
duty? And he would ask again if a hostile aimy
was upon our coast, watching an opportunity to
m\ ade our countrj, and while the faithful and pa-
triotic people had ltlt their homes, and gone to
fight the enemy, Amencar-3 could be found among
us base enough to give signal to the enemy, ad-
vising them of the most vulnerable and defenceless
points for assault, that if Government were called
upon for supplies to sustain our soldiers, while
thus in the field defending our country, and Go-
vernment should withdraw, and the public func-
tionaries should refuse the aid required, would it
not be separating themselves from their duty1*
The Senatoi [Mr. Webster] asks why is the
Government discharged front taking care of the
currency—the paper currency as well as the me-
tallic currency? I answer because the Govern-
ment has no control over it Can the Government
punish, any man for dpbasmg or counterfeiting it?
or can the Government control or mterfeie with the
expansion, contraction, or emission of tt, any more
than it can with the interests or business of any
individual1 No one will pretend to this And
though it wou'd seem as if the proposition was too
self-evident to need supporting by authority, never-
theless he would read an extract from the opinion
of Judge Marshall, m delivering the opinion of the
court in i he casp of McCulloch t  State of Mary-
land, 4 Wharton 424
"After this declaration it can scarcely be neces-
sary to say. that the existence of Slate banks can
have no possible influence on the question No
trace is to be found in the Constitution of an inten-
tion to create a dependance of the Government of
the Union on those of the States for the execution
of the great poweis assigned to it The means are
adequate to its ends, and on these means alone was it
expected to rely for the accomplishment oí its ends "
"To impose on it the necessity of resorting to
means which it cannot control, which another Go-
vernment may furnish or withhold, would render
its course precarious, the result of its measures un-
certain, and create a dipendence on other Go/ern-
ments, which might disappo nt its mo>t important
designs, and is incompatible with the language of
the Constitution "
The Senator [Mr Weester] savs the bill before
us is evidence of such degeneracy in the Govern-
ment as to canv us back to the days of baroansm,
when barbarous and p ratical poweis kept their
money in cells, vaults, and safes It may seem
barbarous to those who are in the habit of receiving
their money b/ t ns ol thousands, ins ead of their
fifty cents a dav for hard labor but thos  who earn
theirmonev by the sweat ot thrir brow, I presume, |
do not consider it much evidence of barbinscn or I
piracy to keep safe their money when ea-ned
The same may be said of everj man who keeps
his money safe, and especially of him who keeps it
from the grasp of the banker and speculator, that
he is barbarous, and degenerating into a pirate
What will the Senator say of those merchants,
many of \vhom are his paiticular friends, who
keep their money in vaults and vafes? An-1 what
will the Senatoi say of his friends, the banks, which
ilways keep their monev in cells, vaults, and safes?
4re they baibarous? It o'hers are disposed to cill
them so, he presumed he is not The Senator [Mr
Webster] agvm manilests great sjmpalhy for the ,
people This bill is going to separate the pe >p e
from the Government, h" sav s If ti e Sena'or
be1 eves, as his propagandist, Mr Hamilton tad
that the But! h Govenment was the most perfect
Government on eaith, Mr S «id he should sup-
pose he wou'd consider it his dutv to sepaiate the
Government from the people, as the British Go-
vernment is wholli spoai ileil from the people
The political power n Lngland is lodged wholly in
the Government, and not in the people, as it is
here The people there are denied the right or
power to leftum the Govern nent, however il'v it
may be adapted to Jieir wants, and wmch is never
done bv them, bitbi P-irliament, and by that only
when the peoile become so clamorous that the}
cannot be resisted But when the Senator is
so apprehensive that the bill will separate t1 e
Government from the people, he onlv mil es
the small mistake [Mr S said lit apprehended]
of calling the banks the people Tne banks are
not jet the people, he believed Th t 'he i
banks and the people are opposed tu e^ch
ether in regaid to the mearme is t( o eviutnt
to require cc nfirmation The banks ate ip, i-.el
to the bill because, sav the gen lem n it vv ü be
their rum, thev tin never icun specie pat me it
if the bill passes 1h< n, it the b il p^s e-, it u i 1
separate the Governmt it 'rom the binks, but not
from the people Mr S ■•aid he des led to know
how this bill could separate the Government fiom
the people The Government is the Government
of the people, formed and constituted bj them, and
is wholly under their control, and may be alter-
ed, changed, or annihilated at their pleasure, and
if any improper act—one which does not meet then
approbation—is done by their servants, the public
officers, contrary to their will, they will displace
them, and substitute others in their places, as they
did when the Senate undertook to impeach the
President Mr S said, if the bill is of such a
character as to dissatisfy the people, and induce
them to recall their agents, and supply their places
with others of different principles, he should think
it would suit the Opposition the better, as it might
be the means of carrying them into power, and pat-
ting the Democrats out, who are abasing their
trust so much, as to separate the people from their
Government
The Senator [Mr. Webster] asks, witho it the
aid of Government, how can the banks resume spe-
cie payments? If they cannot, or will not, what
better evidence is wanted of their unworthiness and
unfitness to be the depositories of the public mo-
nev? Thev clutched all the public money, shut
their doors, and now tell the Government, unless it
will still have confidence m them, and trust them
again with the money of the Government, they
cannot pay the Go' ernment what they now owe it,
nor even in Uvidnal creditors either If an indivi-
dual was to borrow money from his neighbor, shut
himself up, and tell his friend he could not, nor
never would, pay him what he nheady owed him,
unless 1 e would irust him more, w.iat would be the
course of h's friend? He would probably say, he
would rather lose what he had already lei him
have, than more wi'h it, and if his disposition was
such as to cheat him out of what he had already
borrowed of him, it probably would not be changed
tor the better bv a future loan
Mr S said he w ould now proceed to assign
such reasons as suggested themselves to his mind,
why the banks should not be made the depositories
of the pubLc monev. The people of the United
Sutes formed for themsel.es a Government, with
sucn po vers as to them seemed most Ukelv to se-
c i e to then their social ngnt , and one important
prowsnn ,n the Ctnsiitution of their Government
was, that all their officers who participated in the
administration of the Government, should act under
the solemnities of an oat1), and this, in addition to
their immediate accountability to the people for the
faithful performance of their duty, was considered
important, especially in taking care of the public
revenue Tne people, then, have aright ta have
their money in the band  of those who are not only-
officers of the Government, but to have superadded
an official oath, for their faithful performance of
the duties assigned them Have the people this
constitutional security from the depositories of their
monev? Certainly no* So far from it, that any
men, however profligate and base, may constitute
the corporate bodv, whethei citizens of the United
Stat s or of fireign Governments, and whose hos-
tili j to our fiee institutions may be dead Iv, or ho w-
et er cúTUpt and ki-s they miy be, and we are not
without recent examples in bank officers of corrup-
tion and baseness of the most flagitnus chaiacter
Have the peop'e ever authorized their agents to
place their money m the hands of others than offi-
cers oí the Government? Certainly not By what
authon v , then, is it that their money is placed m
the nan^s, and bevond the control of the Govern-
ment, A i sate keeping, it it is not with their con-
sul t' Mr S salt1 tr-is be was vet to learn To
