Orleans. I at once proceeded to Johnsonville to superintend the embarkation of the troops.

The corps took up its line of march for Johnsonville, by railroad, on the 15th of June. The means of transportation was limited to eight wagons and teams to every 1,000 men; altogether, the number of animals was 1,300 belonging to the command. Its brigade of artillery and wagon trains marched to the point of embarkation by land. The embarkation of the troops having been completed by the evening of the 18th, on the following day I returned to my station.

The organization of the Army of the Cumberland ceasing to exist, I was relieved of my duties with it by Special Orders, No. 2, headquarters Military Division of the Tennessee, June 25, 1865, and directed to report to Bvt. Major General J. L. Donaldson, chief quartermaster of the division, for further orders. This officer then directed me to report for duty to Major General George Stoneman, commanding Department of Tennessee. I immediately assumed charge as chief quartermaster of that department.

Not being accountable for public property, with the exception of, at one time, some few articles of office furniture and clothing, camp and garrison equipage, I have none to report as lost, destroyed, or captured by the enemy while under my direction. For the same reason no property captured by our army has fallen into my hands. I may except some cotton, altogether about 585 bales, which, being taken possession of from time to time by Major- General Wilson's forces on their march to Macon, Ga., &amp;c., and shipped to me at Nashville, Tenn., was immediately (as each lot arrived) turned over to the proper officer of the U. S. Treasury Department. I set down $95,000 as its estimated value. The cotton in question has been duly accounted for on my property returns.
