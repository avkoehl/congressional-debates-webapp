The following is from General Griffin. Its contents were told Colonel Chamberlain, who, General Griffin says, is a clear-headed and reliable officer:

General SYKES:

At a house near Beverly Ford, just to my right, the occupants say that the enemy's cavalry this morning said that their infantry was at Manassas Gap; that they had no infantry here. The occupants report that the cavalrymen made the subject common talk, stating that their infantry was certainly at Manassas Gap.

CHARLES GRIFFIN.

Further reports confirm this. Citizens say Stuart left with his cavalry this morning in the direction of our right.

JOHN SEDGWICK,

Major-General, Commanding.
