In the Field, December 27, 1864.

Commanders of divisions and detached brigades will immediately send a sufficient detail back to the supply train to bring forward five days' rations for their respective commands. If possible, a portion of these rations should be brought forward in wagons, after they have been lightened by the detail. Arrangements should be made to bring bread in sacks, and boxes should not be carried on horses, except in extreme cases. This will be promptly attended to, and these headquarters will be notified when the rations are issued to the men.

By order of Brevet Major-General Wilson:
