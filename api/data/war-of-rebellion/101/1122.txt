as the authority for assessment originated in Washington, and the order was made before I came here. There are strong reasons given for making it given me by General Dodge, which are communicated in my letter to Secretary of War. That letter must be in War Department, and I respectfully invite your attention to it.

Major-General.

(Received 12. 10 p. m.)

Honorable a. LINCOLN,

President of the United States, Washington, D. C.:

I have sent you to-day, through the Secretary of War, a full general statement of the condition of affairs in Missouri, and my views of the best course to be pursued. I ask your consideration and approval.

JOHN POPE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSOURI,Saint Louis, Mo., March 8, 1865.

Honorable e. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

SIR: I have the honor to transmit inclosed a letter to the President of the United States with accompanying printed matter in answer to his several dispatches. I have the honor to request that they may be laid before him.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOHN POPE,

Major-General, Commanding.

HEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSOURI,Saint Louis, Mo., March 8, 1865.

Honorable a. LINCOLN,

President of the United States:

SIR: I have the honor to transmit inclosed a printed copy of a letter addressed by me to the governor of Missouri,* in answer to a communication from him. I send this printed copy as being more legible than manuscript. In addition to what is set forth in the letter in question, I desire to submit for your consideration a few remarks and suggestions which it was perhaps wise not to make public in my letter to Governor Fletcher. I ask your consideration of these suggestions, and of those contained in the printed letter, and if they meet your approval, I have the honor to request that I may be so notified, in order that I may put in operation the necessary measures too carry out the policy therein sketched. It is of course desirable that, as there are now no organized forces of the enemy in Missouri, the General Government be relieved from all concern in the civil affairs of the State, and be required only to defend it against armed invasion. So long as U. S. troops remain in Missouri and interfere in any manner in the affairs of the State, they will be a constant source of embarrassment and a difficult obstacle to the renewal of civil administration;
