found the enemy in strong force. A general engagement was by this time evident, and from indications the enemy would probably make the attack. The troops of the Twentieth Corps, intended to occupy the left of our line, were only now beginning to arrive, and some time was needed for them to get into the position desired. To defer if possible such an attack I sent an order to Brigadier-General Carlin to direct Buell to make strong demonstrations against the enemy's lines; but before this order could be executed the enemy took the initiative and moved out from his works in columns of attack. Buell's brigade and three regiments of Hobart's brigade were forced, after considerable fighting, to retire precipitately, closely followed by the enemy. A part of Robinson's brigade, of the Twentieth Corps-the first troops of this corps to arrive upon the ground-was placed in position immediately on the left of the road in support of the Nineteenth Indiana Battery, which had been operating in considerable haste, and captured three guns from this battery (subsequently one of these guns was retaken, leaving but tow in the hands of the enemy), and pushed exultingly up the main road in pursuit for several hundred yards. In order to check this sudden movement of the enemy I ordered Morgan to send his reserve brigade, commanded by Brevet Brigadier-General Fearing, immediately to the point, with instructions to make and attack. The order was promptly and gallantly executed and had the desired result. The major-general commanding the wing at the same time directed the lines of the troops of the Twentieth Corps now arriving upon the ground to be formed in the open field a few hundred yards to the rear, running perpendicular to the road. Batteries were placed in position, supported by these troops, and opened a well directed fire down the rad, thus enfilading Fearing's front. The enemy at this time, about 2. 30 p.m., attacked at all points and the engagement may be said to have become general along my entire line. A part of Hobart's, the whole of Miles' brigade, of Carlin's division, and Mitchell's brigade, of Morgan's division, were, during the movements above described, thrown back so as to conform to the direction of the enemy's attack and the new line established by Fearing's movements.

The lines as now formed, and represented by the accompanying map,* drawn by Captain McDowell, topographical engineer of the Twentieth Corps, received and repulsed the repeated attacks of the enemy, with but little variation, until near night, when, by order of the major-general commanding the wing, Cogswell's brigade, of the Twentieth Corps, arrived and reported to me for duty. This brigade was at once ordered to move into position on the right of Fearing's brigade, and fill a gap which, for want of troops, had existed in this part of the line since the commencement of the action. This brigade moved promptly into position, and subsequently, when ordered to advance, gallantly drove back the enemy's lines in its front after some severe fighting.

The engagement closed as night set in, the enemy having been repulsed at every point. The enemy pushed his attacks, late in the afternoon with great vigor, particularly against Morgan's front, and at onetime gained his rear; but was promptly repulsed and driven back by the steady veterans of this distinguished division.

No definite idea can be formed of the enemy's loss, but it must have been very heavy, judging from the numbers engaged, the severity of his assaults, and the decisive repulses he received, as also the number of hid wounded and dead left within our lines.
