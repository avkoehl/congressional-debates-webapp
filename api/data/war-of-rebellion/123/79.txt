COLUMBUS, OHIO, May 26, 1862.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

I have a temporary force raised for guard duty at Camp Chase, which relieves the Sixty-first Regiment. It will be ready for the field to-morrow. Shall I send it to protect the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad? The people of Ohio are responding handsomely to your call for additional troops. You have at Camp Thomas 400 or 500 regular troops; why not order them to Cumberland?

DAVID TOD,

Governor.

WAR DEPARTMENT, Washington City, D. C., May 26, 1862.

Governor TOD,

Columbus, Ohio:

In the absence of any information by this Department respecting the present position of General Fremont, you will please forward the Sixty-first Regiment toward Cumberland and direct it to report to General Kelley, who has charge of the Railroad Division in Fremont's command.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

COLUMBUS, OHIO, May 26, 1862.

Honorable EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

Telegram to Governor about arms and clothing received. It is believed 10,000 men will promptly respond to the call. About 7,000 arms needed. Should be sent here. Dickerson has clothing, but no camp equipage. Will dispatch General Ripley and Meigs.

GEO. B. WRIGHT,

Quartermaster-General of Ohio.

WAR DEPARTMENT, Washington City, D. C., May 26, 1862.

Governor CURTIN,

Harrisburg, Pa.:

Mr. Puleston has shown me your dispatch to him. I would be glad to have you specify what "want of support from Washington has retarded your efforts" in order that it may be corrected. It has been the desire of the Department to act harmoniously with the State Executives, and I have not been aware of any complaint heretofore. The Adjutant-General will make all necessary and lawful arrangements that may be required for expenses and officers upon your application to him or the Department specifying what you do want. If Captain Dodge can be detailed on the service you desire it will be done.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.
