minutes after, when last seen, firing of arms was heard. I have got all the forces I could start after them. I would have gone myself, but there was a large wagon train of wagons here, and the paymaster was here, and I sent Captain Kelly in command of scut. They had on C. S. clothing.

Captain JOHN R. FOSTER,

Lebanon, Mo.:

Do you hear anything of the band of rebels?

JOHN B. SANBORN,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

LEBANON, May 18, 1865.

Brigadier-General SANBORN:

I hear of a rebel band of about forty-five passing about seven miles east of this last night, taking Lieutenant Johnson, Company L, Sixteenth [Missouri Cavalry]; the sheriff, Harris; S. E. Stroup, late lieutenant Twenty-fourth Missouri, and a young Breakfield. This morning the bodies of Harris, Stroup, and Breakfield were found. Harris hung, and the throats of the other two cut. Their bodies will be brought here this evening. The rebels, taking breakfast some ten miles north of here this morning, did not have Lieutenant Johnson with them, though one was wearing this lieutenant's uniform. His body has not been found yet. It is supposed he shared, if possible, a more horrible death than those found. There are two scuts gone from here, one of sixty men, the other not so many with orders to follow the rebels until they caught them, if it takes ten or fifteen days. Major Small informed the troops at Linn Creek by dispatch last evening of the rebels' approach, and that they would cross the Osage near Linn Creek either above or below.
