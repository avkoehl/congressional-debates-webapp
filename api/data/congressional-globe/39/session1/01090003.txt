McLean, of Montana.
During the call of the roll, when the Clerk had
reached the name of Hon. William E. Niblauk,
of Indiana,
Mr. MAYNARD rose and said: Mr. Clerk,
I beg to say that in calling the roll of mem-
bers 
The CLERK. The Clerk will be compelled
to object to any interruption of the call of the
roll.
Mr. MAYNARD. Does the Clerk decline
to hear me?
The CLERK. I decline to hares any inter1
ruption of the call of the roll.
The call of the roll was then concluded.
The CLERK stated that, one hundred and
seventy-six members having answered to their
names, a quorum was present.
Mr. MORRILL. •. I move that the House do
now proceed to the election of a Speaker of.
the Thirty-Ninth Congressi
Mr. MAYNARD. Before that motion is
put 
Mr. STEVENS. I call the gentleman to
order.
The CLERK. The Clerk rules, as a matter
of order, that he cannot recognize any gentle-
man whose name is not upon his roll.
Mr. BROOKS. Mr. Clerk, I hope that mo-
tion will not prevail until it be settled who are
members of this House—whether the honorable,
gentleman from Tennessee, [Mr. Mayxard,]-
holding in his hand, 1 presume, the certificate
of the Governor of that State, is entitled to be
heard on his credentials or not. I trust that
we shall not proceed to any revolutionary step
like that without at least hearing from the hon-
orable gentleman from Tennessee. For, if Ten-
nessee is not in the Union, and has not been
in the Union, and is not a loyal State, and the
people of Tennessee are aliens and foreigners
to this Union, by what right does the President
of the United States usurp his place in the
White House and in the capital of the country
when an alien, as he must be, a foreigner, and
not from a State in the Union?
I trust there will not be such rapidity of mo-
tion as that proposed. I trust that'the honora-
ble gentleman from Tennessee will be permitted
to be heard. For, if a precedent can be estab-
lished by the Clerk, and he can make a rule to
exclude members from the lloor of this House
by his mere arbitrary will, this then ceases to be
a Congress, and the Clerk of the House, but a
servant of the House, is omnipotent over its
organization. Is not the State of Tennessee in
the Union?
Mr. WENTWORTH. I call the gentleman
to order. I ask, what is the question before the
House ?
The CLERK. The question before the House
is, Shall the House proceed to the election, viva
voce, of a Speaker? on which the gentleman from
New York is entitled to the floor.
Mr. BROOKS. The honorable gentleman
from Illinois, when he is better acquainted with
me in this House, will soon learn that I always
proceed in order, and never deviate from the
rules. [Laughter.]
Mr. Clerk, in the organization of the House
it becomes necessary first to know who has a
right to vote as to that organization. If the dele-
gation from Tennessee—especially if the hon-'
oi able gentleman from Tennessee, who would
address the House if permitted by the Clerk, is
not a loyal man and is not from a State in the
Union, what man then is loyal? In the dark-
est and most doubtful period of the war, when
an exile from his own State, i heard his elo-
quent voice on the banks of the St. Lawrence
arousing the people of my own State to dis-
charge their duties to the country. Yet there
are honorable gentlemen who will not allow nim.
i to be heard upon this tloor, although holding in
\ his hand a eertilicate from the Governor of the
- State of Tennessee.
j And then there is a State of Virginia which
i the Clerk has not read; I mean the old State of
: Virginia, and not Western Virginia—the State
! over winch Governor Peirpoml. presides, over
\ which he has presided, and to which position he
I was elected during the war, whose loyalty no
| man doubts, and who is as much the Governor
S of that State as the Governor of Pennsylvania-
j is Governor of the State of Pennsylvania. By
what right has the Virginia delegation been ex-
cluded by the Clerk of the House? I wish the
Clerk would tell me. lie has given no reason
for such exclusion, and I should be happy to
