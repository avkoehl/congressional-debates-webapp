he has never been out of grain, and but for a few days at a time of hay. With plenty of grain, animals cannot suffer much if not supplied with hay.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

CHS. THOMAS,

Acting Quartermaster-General and Bvt. Brigadier General U. S. Army.

P. S.-See Colonel Brown's letter and statement herewith, showing that he has furnished General Sherman's army with 36,944 bushels of corn, 418,268 bushels of oats, and 8,508,939 pound of hay (4,209 tons), and that he is still supplying it with grain for 35,000 animals.

[Inclosure No. 1.] QUARTERMASTER-GENERAL'S OFFICE, Washington City, January 12, 1865.

Bvt. Brigadier General CHARLES THOMAS,

Acting Quartermaster-General U. S. Army, Washington, D. C.:

GENERAL: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of a telegram from Lieutenant-General Grant in relation to the scarcity of forage with armies operating against Richmond, which was referred to me for report. I would respectfully call your attention to a statement submitted to you on the 11th instant, which shows that the following amounts of forage were afloat for City Point on the 9th instant, viz: 10,308 bushels of corn, 310,027 bushels of oats, and 3,289 tons of hay; and that there was loading at New York City on that day for City Point the following amounts, viz: 204,040 bushels of oats and 1,195 tons of hay. No pains have been spared by me to forward for the supply of the armies a sufficient supply of grain and hay, and sufficient grain has at all times been afloat for a full supply; but the late storms and ice have delayed the arrival of vessels. Hay has been exceedingly late in moving during the present season, and I have sent agents into all the hay-producing sections of the country to purchase supplies. There is ample grain now on the way for a full supply, and arrangements have been made to prevent any interruption in the supply in future. I am sorry that General Grant believes that there has been any remissness on my part, but I beg leave to assure you that nothing that could be done has remained undone in order to secure a constant and uninterrupted supply for the entire armies. The dispatch from General Grant is herewith respectfully returned.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. L. BROWN,

Colonel, in Charge of Division of Requisitions and Supplies.
