HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,March 25, 1865-9.20 a. m.

General HUMPHREYS:

Griffin is ordered to remail near Wyatt house to support the Second or Sixth Corps, as he may be called upon. Two divisions of the Fifth Corps are still moving toward Parke, and will be directed to move toward left in case he reports that he will not attack.

ALEX. S. WEBB,

Brevet Major-General and Chief of Staff.

MARCH 25, 1865-10 a. m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

General Willcox reports that some of the prisoners state that Lee has been massing troops on his right, and that he will attack there. This I send for what it is worth. Other prisoners say that they will attack up gain. We have a colonel of the Seventeenth South Carolina, a prisoner, of Johnson's division. General Gordon was on the field in person.

JNO. G. PARKE,

Major-General.

(Same to Generals Warren and Wright.)

MARCH 25, 1865-10.15 a. m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Commanding Second Corps:

We have evidence that two brigades of Johnson's division are here. We have prisoners form two brigades, and they say that the whole division came over last night.

JNO. G. PARKE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,March 25, 1865-10.15 a. m. (Received 10.50 a. m.)

Major-General MEADE,

Commanding Army of the Potomac:

A deserter from Cooke states that Cooke's brigade left last night about 10 o;clock. Some other troops came into Cooke's place; don't know which way Cooke went. If I make an attempt on the enemy's works probably it would be better to try on each division front. I telegraphed General Parke and not you, became the telegraph line to City Point was broken. I am attacking the enemy's picket-line strongly at other points. They have opened artillery on the forces near the Armstrong house and Watchin's house. I have driven in their pickets from the Watkins-house field. No report from those two parties yet.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General, Commanding.
