HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE SOUTH,Hilton Head, S. C., February 17, 1865.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Chief of Staff, U. S. Armies, Washington, D. C.:

GENERAL: I have received a special order from the War Department relieving Brevet Brigadier-General Littlefield ffrom duty in this department, and directing him to report to Major-General Canby for duty. General Littlefield being mustering and disbursing officer of this department, and in charge of the funds pertaining to that office, will not be able to complete his preparations for leaving in time to take the steamer Fulton, which sails to-morrow, but will be in readiness probably to go in the Arago on her next trip. I desire to make an earnest appeal for the suspension, temporarily at least, of the order relieving General Littlefield, for the reason that he understands and can conduct the business of recruiting and organizing colored troops better than any officer in this command, and better, indeed, than any one I could expect to have sent here to take his place. If Brigadier-General Birney is ordered here in compliance with General Foster's application, I request that he may not be assigned to any special duties in the order. I may desire to put him in command of the District of Florida, as General Scammon is quite ill.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Q. A. GILLMORE,

Major-General, Commanding.
