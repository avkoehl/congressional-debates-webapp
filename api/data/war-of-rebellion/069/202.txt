FORT MONROE, VA., May 25, 1864-2.30 p.m.

(Received 4.50 p.m.)

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Chief of Staff:

There is confusion in the command here. No officer of sufficient rank appears to have command at Fort Monroe, and the quartermaster, Lieutenant-Colonel Biggs, seems to be practicably exercising the command. If General Gillmore is withdrawn from Bermuda Hundred this fort, Norfolk, Portsmouth, Yorktown, Williamsburg, Gloucester Point, and their dependencies, would constitute a district, the immediate command of which, subordinate to General Butler's general command of the department, would fully occupy him.

M. C. MEIGS,

Quartermaster-General.

J. G. BARNARD,

Chief Engineer.

GENERAL BUTLER'S HEADQUARTERS,

Major-General GILLMORE:

The general commanding wishes you to send a staff officer to these headquarters to get the time here, so that the time throughout the department may agree.

Major and Assistant Adjutant-General.

Major General Q. A. GILLMORE,

Commanding Tenth Corps:

GENERAL: The general commanding directs that, in addition to the daily detail for the new redoubt in front of Battery Numbers 3, you furnish a detail for work there, this night only, of the same strength as the daily detail. This has become necessary on account of the damage inflicted by the enemy's sharpshooters.

Very respectfully,

G. WEITZEL,

Brigadier-General and Chief of Engineers.

[Indorsement.]

Direct Colonel Serrell to detail 5 engineers, and Turner and Ames 200 men, to report at 7 p.m. to Lieutenant Parsons. Detail 100 men from Ames and 100 men from Turner.
