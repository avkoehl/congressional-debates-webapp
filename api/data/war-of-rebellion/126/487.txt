The suspension of active military operations occurred while the business of the draft under this call was in progress, and orders were issued on the 13th of April, 1865, to discontinue the business of recruiting and drafting, and on the next day all drafted men who had not been forwarded to general rendezvous were ordered to be discharged, and soon after all who had not been forwarded to the field were discharged by order from the Adjutant-General.

The aggregate quotas charged against the several States under all calls made by the President of the United States from the 15th day of April, 1861, up to the 14th day of April, 1865, at which time drafting and recruiting ceased by order of the Secretary of War, was 2,759,049, the terms of service varying from three months to three years, as shown in detail by the books of the Provost-Marshal-General's Office.* The aggregate number of men credited on the several calls and put into service of the United States in the Army, Navy, and Marine Corps during the above period was 2,656,553, leaving a deficiency on all calls when the war closed of 102,496, which would have been obtained in full, in fact in excess, if recruiting and drafting had not been discontinued.* This number does not embrace the "emergency men" put into service during the summer of 1863 by the States of New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, nor those furnished by the States of Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois during the Morgan raid, amounting in all to over 120,000 men, who served periods of about two or three weeks.

In estimating the number of troops called into service, it has been the rule of the department to take into account the whole number of men mustered, without regard to the fact that the same persons may have been previously discharged after having been accepted and credited on previous calls.

Under the different calls volunteers have been accepted for various terms of service, viz, three, six, and nine months, and one, two, and three years, respectively; and a large number of persons who had served under one call have subsequently enlisted under another. Thus, a portion of those who enlisted under the call in April, 1861, for 75,000 three-months" men, again enlisted under succeeding calls in July following for three years; others re-entered the service for nine months, or for one or two years, and at the expiration of these periods again re-enlisted for three years, and the entire veteran volunteer force consisted of those who, having served two years, re-enlisted for three years.
