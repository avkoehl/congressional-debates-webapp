Mr WRIGHT, irom the Cfiimn tfe on Ti
nance, called up the repoit m relation to the peti-
tion for a national bank, wh ch was
" Resslved, That the prayer of the respective pe-
titions ought not to be granted "
Mr CLAY did not see the utility of bunging
forward the resolution of the Committee on Fi-
nance, it was a simple negatn e proposition, ar d
therefore should not be cal'pd up unless there was
a disposition on the part of the Senate to pass an
affn mative one The course pmsjed by the gen-
tleman fiom New York (Mi Wright) reminded
him of a rirci instance which took place a little
before the deel'' ation of the late wai w ith Great
Entain A very extraordinary man belongirg to
the other House, now no more, fh" alluded to Mr
Rand lph ] leai it that message w ould ee sent by
Mr Madison, then Piesjent cf the United Shte ,
re"omm"nlmg d"elar>ticn of war That genl'e
mm arose m his p'a"", and offe ed a re ilution
sim lar to th  o e cal'cd up by the gentleman—
"Vesohed Tit it is inexpedient to dec'art war
against Gieat Bin un " Foi his part, he enter-
tained a very diffei nt opm on fnm the gentleman
relame to the expediency of "ranting the pi ay ei of
the petitioners and he thuight unless the " was i
disposition evinced to pass an affiimatrve pioposi-
tion, the true course \w uld be to let the resolution
lie on the t'b'e Li^e the Irish ambarado he.
migat say, 'situated as the Senate then uv- '
th"ie was not much likelihood of such a step b-mg
taken If however, tne gentleman «houkl peisist
in immetnte action, he should moie O add the
following amendment, which wis to stril e out all
aftei ' Resolved," and insert, "that ¡t wi'l be expe-
dient  to establish a Bank of tne United Stales

Mr WEBSTEF deemed the qnes' on one of too
