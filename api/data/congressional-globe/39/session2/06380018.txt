_ The pay department remains without mate-
rial change. In consequence of additionaf
labors imposed upon this branch of the War
Department by recent congressional enactment,
and in order to promptly pay the large issue
of Treasury certificates, it was necessary to
retain temporarily a number of additional pay-
masters. The financial summary exhibits—■

year 4120,106,999 32

sources during the year  163,426,228 97

The corps of engineers at the close of the
fiscal year consisted of ninety-five officers, the
battalion of engineer troops, and the Military
Academy. Thirteen officers were on detached
duty, serving-in command of military depart-
ments, on special service connected with the
levees of the Mississippi river, on the Light-
House Board, with the Department of the
Interior upon duties relating to the Pacific
railroad, on military surveys and staffs of the
General-in-Chief and commanding general of
the military division of the Gulf; the remain-
der were diligently engaged in the duties of
their profession, officers of desirable experi-
ence and practice having direct supervision of
the more important works. The engineer
troops were distributed between the Military
Academy and the two depots of engineer sup-
plies located at Willett's Point, New York,
and at Jefferson Barracks, Missouri. The
condition of the battalion with regard to dis-
cipline and instruction is reported as satisfac-
tory. At the two engineer depots much
valuable war material has been collected from
points where it had remained after the close
of active operations in the field, and it is pro-
posed to keep on hand a complete outfit, on a
moderate scale, of such engineer, bridge, and
siege equipage as would be most likely to come
into requisition to supply unforeseen demands
in the field. The chief of Engineers suggests
a modification of the act of June 23, 1866, in
respect to the manner of procuring labor and
material for improvements of harbors and
rivers. The estimated appropriation required
by the Engineer Bureau for the next fiscal year
is £5,140,000.
The ordnance department now limits the
operations at arsenals to the construction of
wrought-iron sea-coast carriages and such
ordnance supplies as are needed for immediate
use; preservation of the ordnance stores left
on hand at the close of the war; breaking up
unserviceable ammunition; and completing
unfinished buildings. Fire-proof workshops
have been completed at Watervliet, Frankford,
and Alleghany arsenals; three magazines, with
a capacity for storing 15,000 barrels of gun-
powder, have been built at St. Louis arsenal,
and one of the same capacity at each of the
arsenals at Washington city and Benicia. A
board of officers is engaged in examining suit-
able sites for depositories of gunpowder, pro-
vided for by an appropriation of the last ses-
sion of Congress; and the erection of such
magazines as will furnish secure and suitable-
storage for all our powder, ammunition, and
niter will be commenced early next spring.
The arsenals at the South which were seized
by the rebels, having been retaken, are reoc-
cupied, excepting the North Carolina arsenal,
which was destroyed; the Harper's Ferry ar-
mory , the workshops of which were burned, and
which has been used as an ordnance depot; the
arsenal in Florida, which has been transferred
temporarily to the Freedmen's Bureau; and
the arsenal in Arkansas, which is occupied by
troops of the line. The chief of Ordnance is
of opinion that it is not advisable to rebuild
the Xorth Carolina arsenal or to reestablish
the armory at Harper's Ferry, and tho sale of
both is recommended. All the small-arms
and some of the other supplies which were col-
lected at Baton Rouge, San Antonio, Augusta,
Charleston, and Mount Vernon arsenals have
been removed, and the only supplies which
have been sent to them were such as were
required for immediate issue to troops.
The commission appointed under the act of
April 10, 1804, to examine and report the value
of property on Rock Island taken by the Uni-
ted States by authority of that act, has entered
upon its duties. As soon as good titles to the
property shall have been acquired, the con-
struction of the armory and arsenal, as required
by law, will be hastened as fast as the appro-
priations will admit. It is important that this
establishment should be built up as rapidly as
possible, and a considerable sum has been esti-
mated for that purpose during the next fiscal
year. It is'believed that all of it is necessary
and can be judiciously and advantageously
expended. The operations at the national
armory at Springfield, Massachusetts, during
the past year have been confined to cleaning
and repairing arms used during the war, and to
making the requisite preparations for convert-
ingthe Springfield muskets into breech-loaders.
The power and endurance of the 8-inch and
12-inch cast-iron rifle cannon have been sub-
jected to practical tests, and the experiments
will be continued. The ordnance returns for
three consecutive years, including a period of
active service and ordinary repairs, show an
average duration of five years for cavalry car-
bines, of four years for cavalry pistols, sabers,
and accouterments, of seven years for infantry
muskets, and of six years for infantry accou-
terments. From January 1, 1801, to JuneJft),
1866, the ordnance department provided 7,802
cannon; 11,787 artillery carriages; 4,022,ISO
small-arms; 2,362,540 complete sets of aceou-
terments for infantry and cavalry; 530,544 com-
plete sets of cavalry horse equipments; 28,164
sets of horse artillery harness; 1,022,176,474
cartridges for small-arms; 1,220,555,435 per-
cussion caps; 2,862,177 rounds of fixed artil-
lery ammunition; 14,507,682 cannon primers
and fuses; 12,875.294 pounds of artillery pro-
jectiles ; 26,440,054 pounds of. gunpowder;
6,395,152 pounds of niter, and 90,410,295
pounds of lead. In addition to those, there
were immense quantities of parts provided for
repairing and making good articles damaged,
lost, or destroyed in the service. The fiscal
resources of the Ordnance Bureau for the year
amounted to $35,301,062 56, and the expend-
itures to $16,551,677 58, leaving a balance
of $18,749,385 18, of which $18,043,804 28
were undrawn balances in the Treasury, and
$705,580 90 were to the credit of disbursing
officers in the-Government depositories on June
30,1866. The estimated appropriation required
by the Ordnance office, including only such
objectsas require early attention, is £1,593,242.
In the office of the Commissary General of
Prisoners a reduced force has been engaged in
receiving and completing the records relating
to prisoners of war, in furnishing information
required by the various bureaus, and in tho
investigation of claims for commutation of
rations to United States soldiers while held as
prisoners of war.
The clerical force at the office of the Signal
corps is employed in arranging and putting in
durable form messages and reports which passed
through or emanated from the corps (luring the
war. The expenditures for the signal service
during the year ending September 30, 1860,
were £3,900 15; the total amount appropri-
ated and still available for signal service Sep-
tember 30,1866, was £252.565 97. No appro-
priation was requested of last Congress, and
none will be required for the next fiscal year.
At the last examination the corps of Cadets
at the Military Academy numbered two hun-
dred and twenty-eight members, and forty
cadets of the graduating class completed the
course of studies and were commissioned lieu-
tenants in the Army. Under the provisions
of the acts of Congress approved, respectively,
July 13 and28, 18 j0. the Military Academy was
separated from the corps of F.nmincers, which,
together with certain professors and cadets,
had heretofore constituted the institution, and
the officers of which had exercised exclusive
supervision and control over it. Brevet Major
General Edmund Sehrivcr, Inspector General,
has been assigned as inspector, and Colonel
T. G. Pitcher, of the forty-fourth infantry,
appointed Superintendent. The report of the
Board of Visitors for 1867 bears ample testi-
mony to the usefulness and excellent condition
of the Academy, and recommends the increase
of the number of cadets to four hundred.
With the present number of cadets but one
graduate can be supplied to each regiment
every second year, after the ordinary demands
of the staff corps are met. During the past
session of Congress important measures were
