SAVANNAH, November 29, 1864.

Honorable j. A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War:

As railroad and telegraphic communications may soon be cut with Charleston I desire you to know that I have, including the local troops, less than 1,000 men of all arms. General Smith is expected with 3,200 men, but has not yet arrived. If railroad communication is cut with Charleston, which is threatened by ten gun-boats and barges, of course no re-enforcements can be sent from Augusta.

W. J. HARDEE,

Lieutenant-General.
