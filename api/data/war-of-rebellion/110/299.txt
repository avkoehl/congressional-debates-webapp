safely be asserted that our loss in irreparable, adn that among the shining hosts of the great and the good who now cluster around the banner of our country there exits no purer spirit, no more heroic soul, than that of the illustrious man whose death I join you in lamenting. In his death he shas illustrated the character for which through life he was conspicuous-that of singleness of purpose and devolution to duty. With his whole energies bent on attaining the victiory with he deemed essential to his country's cause, he rode on to the accomplishment of his object, forgetful of self, while his very life-blood was fast ebbing away. His last breath cheered his comrades to victory; the last sound he heard was their shout of triumph ; his last thought was his country's; and long and deeply will his country mourn his loss.

JEFFERSON DAVIS.

[10.]

ADJUTANT AND INSPECTOR GENERAL'S OFFICE, Montgomery, Ala., April 9, 1862.

Colonel R. JEFFERSON, Jr.,

Special Aide-de-Camp:

COLONEL: By the direction of the Governor I herewith inclose you original letter* from Captain H. A. M. Henderson. He directs me also to state that he has received evidence from other sources sufficient to satisfy his mind that the facts as detailed by Captain Henderson are substantially correct. He feels that his duty to the State, as well as to the loyal citizens of the particular section referred to, demands early and energetic action. Every one who patricipated in the conention referred to in the letter by supporting its resolutions is a traitor to the State and to the South and should, if possible, be arrested. Lenity and forgearance, hesitation or faltering would have no other effect than to give confidence to those engaged in the treason. The infection will spread and increase unless it is promptly eradicated. The Governor feels that this respensible duty can be confided to no one so properly as yourself, and to this end you are invested with authority to order out and call into the service of the State such poriton of the military force of the State as you may think necessary; to issue orders in the name of the Governor, as his aide-de camp, to any major or brigadier general, colonel, or any other officer for the whole or any part of their command; to take the necessary steps by purchase or otherwise to provide ammunition, subsistence, and transportation, all of which will be paid for by the State; if need be to impress arms, and generally to take such measures as in the exercise of your discretion you may deem necessary to effect the arrest of the disloyal leaders and their misguided followers, unless you are fully satisfied that the last can be brought back to a true sense of their duty to the State and the South by a more lenient course. It may be, however, that the arrest, of the leaders alone will only tend to exasperate and inflame, and in that case the loyal citizens and their families would be exposed to dangers which it would be necessary to guard against camps at the proper points, either of cavalry or infantry, or both, as you may deem expedient. The cavalry company of Captain Pegues, at Tuscaloosa, is subject to your orders, and it is supposed you can also obtain mounted men from the militia. The regiment of Colonel Frazer, at Shelby Springs, or such part of it as you may require, could doubtless be had on application to the officer in command.
