The recent military bills increasing the range of conscription have engaged the constant attention and energetic efforts of the able head of the Conscript Bureau in their enforcement. His accompanying report, to which attention is invited, will exhibit results so far attained in recruiting the armies and at the same time explain the embats which have hindered more rapid execution. * These have resulted very much from the necessity of examining the numerous claims presented for exemptions or details under the exceptions and avowed policy of the law, and from the difficulty of commanding the class and number of assistants and officers for the multifarious duties cast on the Bureau. Owing to the decadence of the volunteering spirit, a large proportion of those liable to enrollment prefer claims of exemption or detail which justice and a regard for the aims avowed in the law require to be investigated and decided. At the same time the omission of Congress to authorize the appointment of officers for enrolling service and the expectation that officers to be retired under the invalid bill would suffice by assignment for such duties have placed the conscription service under something like a temporary privation. The period of such transition from old to new agencies under the most favorable circumstances would have been embarrassing and retarding, but the delays have been increased by the necessity of awaiting the process of retiring officers under a contemporaneous law, which must inevitably be of slow and gradual execution. Even when such officers have been retired and can be commanded, they are new to their duties, and the retention of their full rank often makes it difficult to adjust them in appropriate relations with the few more experienced officers whom the laws had authorized to be appointed for the duties of conscription. This will readily be appreciated when it is recollected that the highest rank authorized for such service is that of major of a camp of instruction. It is earnestly recommended that power of appointing with rank varying from a lieutenant to a colonel, for enrolling and for supervising conscription in each State, a limited number of competent officers, whether from the retired list or those having special training or qualifications for the duties, be conferred. The duties cast on the Conscript Bureau arnd arduous, as well as of prime moment, and it surely is not unreasonable to ask the privilege of selecting and employing fitting instrumentalities for their accomplishment.

Another cause of some retardation in the execution of the laws of conscription results, necessarily, from the persistent policy of the Department to rely for its regular administration on the prestige of law and the support of intelligent public opinion to established authority, rather than on military coercion by sustaining forces. Thus, instead of the forced gathering up, as with a drag net, of all that come within prescribed ages, there is the accorded privilege of volunteering; thereafter enrollment, with due respect to the limitations of the law and the claims for exemption and details, and their appropriate assignment. As the regular administration of law is more tedious than the summary judgments of arbitrary authority, so this system sacrifices something of expedition to justice. But much greater advantages are,
