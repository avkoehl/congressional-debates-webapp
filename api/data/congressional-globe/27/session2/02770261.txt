he felt bound to vindicate that opinion, in leply te the gentle-
man from South Carolina
Mr EVERETT asked if the discussion of such a subject was
in order
The SPEAKER replied tha' such a latitude of debate having
been allowed to others, he could not with propriety wholly pre
vent the gentleman from Pennsylvania from entering upon the
same ground
Mr. CHARLES BROWN said (hey were about to increase
or diminish the number of clerks, and he thought the pay re
ceived by the members of that House created the necessity lor
the clerks If they had no pa> at all, should they remain there
ten months m the year debating quesvions «ming up on pen
tions signed by nobody, and for which nobody would take the
responsibility? It was the pay of members which kept them
there with irritating debate, procrastinating the public business,
for there was no reason why they should continue there eightor
ten months every session, to pass all necessary laws, and nega
Uve all measures which ought not to become laws
Mr. SOLLERs again rose to a point of order The gentle
man from rennsylvama was not discu&sing the question befoie
the House
Mr CHARLES BROWN said he believed h 3 constituents
held theopimonswhich he had been expressing Hehadheard
them expressed by the people, and those opinions which the
people had expressed through the press and othoiwise, he was
not ashamed to express there He had said that then pay
ought to be cuitailed, there ought to be a beginning at home,
they ought to curtail their own lemuneration, but if he under
stood the gentleman from South Carolina aright, it was a gro
veiling, and degrading, and sen lie immsteiing to the depraved
appetite&f the day, to utter opinions and give expression to the
feelings of the people It was demagoguism to bring into that
hall the opinions ol the people, who were their masters and
sovereigns, and to whom they were answerable for the govern
ment of the country If that was demagoguisth, he (Mr
Brown) was a demagogue He feltit to be the flist principle
of the Democratic school in which he had been taught, to bi mg
the feelings of the people into tne representative hall, and to
carry them out, and he mu«tbe permitted to tell the gentleman
from South Carohn i that when he s°t himsell up to dictate to
the people what was right and what was wiong, if such was
the Democracy of that gentleman's district, there was a differ
eiice between the Democracy of South Carolina and Pennsy,
vania But the gentleman said the members of that House,
with reduced pay, would not be independent Let the gentle
man appeal to histoiy When Congress first assembled heie,
did its members get these higi salines* Let the gentleman
look to the lecord, and ho would find but three dol
lars a day, and in some cases two dolíais and some
five dollars were paid 1 he sum paid by tne States were
all small, and wot Id the gentleman from South Carolina
tell him that those members were not independent! They were
the men who set the British Government at defiance They
bearded the lion in his den, and pledged their lives, their ior
tunes, and their sacred honor for the good of the country
Here there was much mterruntion Aomeveiy part of the hall,

on the state of the Union (Mr Briggs of Massachusetts in the

Aftei someienraks fro n Mt Tillmorf, this amendment

Mr FII LMORE moved to amend the 15th c'au e, iiakng
an appiopnation of Si) 000 foi incidental and coi tmeeitex
penses of the Def artment of State, including the pub ldtion
of the laws by providing that 1 ereafter all the iob prmtirg,
binding and stationerv of the Departments, shall be supplied
undei contract, after tine n itKeb> public advertisement
Mr P DAVIS offered an amendment to this amendment
•dtfüaMMMMMfiál
which theChair ruled to be out of order, and o„ an appeal, the
House sustained the decision of the Chair
Mr FILLMORE'S amendment was agreed to
Mr VAN BUREN offered an amendment to make the ap-
propriation for the publication of the laws specific, and also to
make a specific appropriation for other contingencies.
Mr VAN BUREN observed that by referring to the report of
the Secretary of State it would be found that this expenditure
,0i the publication and distribution of the laws was uniform,
while there were a great many other expenditures that were
temporary and would not probably occur again He was
therefore of opinion that the subject of publishing and dis
tnbutingthe laws should be separated from the others, and pro-
vided for by aspee fie appropriation This could be done, as
it could he readily ascertained what the expense would amount
to He was very willing to vote a sufficient sum for this Ob
jec t, but he saw no reason why the appropriation should not be
a specific one As to the other expenditures he was for hav-
ing them piovided for separately
After some remarks from Mr FILLMORE, the question was
taken on the amendment, and it was lost
Mr McKEON moved to amend the same clause by reducing
the appropriation to $6 000    He saw no reason for giving to
the State Department 825,000 in addition to the unexpended
balance already on hand    II the chairman of the commute?
[Mr Fillmore] would refer to the tJocumenls, he would find
that the Department had now on band an unexpended balance
of $19,000    If this appropropnation were made, there would
besometlnnglike850 000for the Department to spend in con
t'ngencies, and if this example of extravagance was to be set
he would like to knoffcwhen and where the business of retrench
ment and reform wal to begm    In referring to the contingent
expenditures of that Department for the past year, he found
charges that he was jure the House never would consent to
For instance, he would calf the attention of the House to the
charges for extra cle£k hi(e    While there was a specific ap
propnation for as many clerks as the House though sufficient
for t hat Department, Jour or five thousand dollars extra was
charged as  if   for   additional   temporary   clerks  but the
House could see from the report that some of them had been
kept in employment<irom one end of the year to the other
Mr McK then handed up to the Clerk a list of the contingent
expenses of the Department to which he took exception, which
was lead for thenformation of the House
Mi McK said he must not now be met by the objection that
some of these expenditures Wei e sanctioned hy the last Admini
stration All parties now professed to be for economy, retrench
ment and reform, and stood jiledged to retrench useless and ex
travagant expenditures no matter whether they were sanction
ed by this Administration or the last Now, he would refer to
some of the*? expenditures, such as "hack hire and chaiterof
a steamboat, $150  
Mr GRANGER here explained that the steamboat was char
icred to send an express to President Tyler, on the death of
General Harnson
Mr McK continued commenting on sevcal of the items of
expenditure, until he came to the charge foi "an extra train of
cais$100," and asked what that wis fori
This was explained to be for the íunoval the body of Ge
neial Hamson fiom this place to Baltimore, on i s way to Cm
ennati
Mi McK continued with the list, and inquired what was the
meaning of the chame, "I B Morgan, for a toilet set " Gen
tlen en would find, he said, in going tluough this long list, a
nu mber of items that ought not to be charged thel e He wished
he had the means of lestnctmg this De¡ ailment m ícgard to
these contingencies, and he thought he should offei an amend
ment to make them specific, something like the appiopnations
for the Navy Department Many of these expenditures ought
to be put a stop to He had no idea that the Government should
pay for the pictures of the Secretaries and leading men to hang
up in the public Departments He was veiy willing to pay
them for carrying on the ¿flairs of the Government, but he did
not think ihe public service would be promoted by hanging their
pictuies up in the public buildings He was foi putting a slop
to the expense for extra clerk hire If thesecleiks wereneces
sary and he presumed that the Secretary thought so, by em
ploying them throughout the year, who did he not ask Con
gress to auihonze their employment by law? He had the
s longest objections to cleiks being smuggled into the public of
tices i-i this way I et us, said he, be open and candid to the
people, and tell them what we are expending Let us tell them
that some five thousand dollar  in this Depai tmenl is expended
for extra clerk hire in addition to the legular force let us
tell them tha' $200 goes for portraits of the President,
and 5200 for portraiis of the Secretaries It was huh time to
make ¿ reduction of all u eless an 1 unnecessarv expenditures,
the a tuation of the c luntiv demanded it, and the people ex
pected it If gentlemen would turn to the letter he had real
some days ago, they would find that under the head of No 15,
so much was d^kedfol ' labor " while under the head of No
17 theie was anothei appropriation for "labor" He would
askif it was necessary to give this ¡523 000 to the Stae Depart
ment, when thev asl ed t60 000 moi e under another headi They
had n  SW000 unexoended and this with the $6 000 his
amendment proposed to give them, would, in his opinion, be
amnlysufficiei t
Mi PROFMT asked if it would be in order at thw -stage of
the p oceeding* to lnqm e into other e\pei ditures If so, he
would like to lrqnue n to the expei dliuiesof this House, and
Ihe fact of a membei s being absent for a month at a time and
diewm, his pay Hew uld also liku to inquire lmo the e\
(enditmesof the N„ í \orkcu torn hou«e aid, lfhewaspei
mitcd he would piomi«e to give some fact  on this subiect
that the countiy would be surprised at, Such as charges for pa

The CHAIR here called Mi Pboffit to older and he took

to bung out some things that the country would be astonished
at

Mr GARRETT DWB off-red an amendment providing
