The resources of this country for the production of arms and munitions of war have only commenced their developments, yet their extent may be inferred from the enormous quantities of supplies shown by the foregoing tabular abstract to have been furnished furing the last two years. At the beginning of the war we were compelled to rely upon foreign countries for the supply of nearly all our arms and munitions. Now all these things are manufacture at home, and we are independent of foreign countries not only for the manufactures, but also for the materials of which they are composed.

The excellence of arms and munitions of American manufacture which have been supplied by the Ordnance Department to the Army has been so obvious that our soldiers are no longer willing to use those which have been imported from other countries.

The efforts made during the war to extend and improve the manufacture of arms and munitions have resulted in discoveries of great importance to the country in peace as well as in war. Among the arts thus improved is the manufacture of wrought-iron, now rivaling the finest qualities of the iron of Sweden, Norway, and England, so highly in the arts.

This country until the present year has relied upon those countries for material to make gun-barrels, bridle bits, car- wheel tires, and other articles requiring iron of fines quality. The iron of our own production is now superior to that obtained abroad for all these purposes.
