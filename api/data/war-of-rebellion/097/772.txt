Lieutenant Colonel J. H. TAYLOR:

COLONEL: Reports from the several posts on the line state all quiet. I sent out a scout of 100 men under Captain Corbit, Eighth Illinois Cavalry, last night to Warrenton, which has just returned all safe, capturing General Payne, Lieutenant Digges, aide-de-camp, and three rebel cavalrymen. These prisoners will be forwarded under guard to your headquarters by railway to-morrow. I have to report that General Slough has stopped all trains to Fairfax Station to-day, consequently no mail matter or dispatches have been received since yesterday. If this is continued it will be necessary for me to communicate with you headquarters daily by a cavalry escort. please inform me. Eight hundred cavalrymen started early this morning, under Colonels Sweitzer and Clendenin, to execute the last order received by telegram at 3.30 a. m., to arrest suspicious persons.

W. GAMBLE,

Colonel, Commanding Brigade.
