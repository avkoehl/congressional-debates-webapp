I have to correct an error into which I was by the report of an officer detailed to take the measurement of the rifled projectiles fired from the monitors. Their correct diameter is 8 inches and not 6 1\2, as was reported; length 20 inches. Five negroes were wounded yesterday by the explosion of a mortar shell, and by bricks, thrown by a riffled shell at night; 1 dangerously, 1 severely, and 3 slightly. I add condensed statement of work done, submitted by Captain J. Johnson, engineer in charge:

No frames yet arrived for iron fence. They shall be made here, is not sent to-night.
