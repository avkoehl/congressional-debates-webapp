el so as to admit of safely curtailing the appopn-
ations at once, to such an extent that the expendi-
tures need net exceed, m the aggregate, seventeen
or e ghteen millions yearly. After more of tne
pensions termina e, and the removal of the Icdians
is completed, ihsy could be ben ficiilly contracted
to even less than that amount. Such a reduc'ion
as is first adverted to seems, therefore, proper to be
adopted now, since i> cculd be effect d without the
probability of injury to any useful national esta-
blishment, would promote publ c fragah'y, and su-
persede the necessi'y either of higner tariffs, direct
taxes, or permanent debts
If that tee i.ot done, the secondly measures be-
fore suggested, such as a declaratory act to enf >ree
t>e present tariff, a suitable modification of the
drawbacks and bounties; and the passage of bi L
graduating the price of public land-, as well as
creating s me new districts f"r the <ae of thera,
wou'd be likely, if taking effect eariy, to yield a
suitable supply in the course of th* year
It will be observed, however, that though, under
either of these arrangem-nts-, enough migtt b- ob-
tained wiihm the whole of 1841 tor the objects
contemplated, vet not a due or suffinent proportion
in the first quan:r; because by that time all ihe
measures are not likely to go uto full operation,
nor much of tse anticipated increase to haprea 10
the actual receipts of du íes utider exis'mg laJ'S
Unusually heavy expenses wi 1 siso fall on that
quarter in the n xt year In addition to a full por-
tion of most of the current expenses, and the whole
pension payments for the first half of the ye r, and
one-tnird of a million, or more, for all the annual
fishing bounties the e will be imposed on it most
of the charges for the whole year connected with
the session of Congress and private- bi.'s, a well as
large payments fcr tak ns; the census, and for the
firs instalment cf the debt of this District, several
of them as eariy even as the first day cf January
From these circumstances, and the considerations
that all which is due from the banks may net
be then paid, and that the balance in the Trea-
sury, under the policy adopted by Congress of late
years, will of necessity bs Email, while tie fluc-
tuations and inequalities are very gieat between
the receipts and expendí ures m different por iciis
cf the year, to which we are constantly exposed
from causes that have on forme1- occasions besn
explained at length, it mt'ot be < bviouti h°t entire
safety requires a conditional power to be s asona-
bty conferred on the Executive to ob am at arij
time wnh 18-11 such s tbsidirry meaes as muy be
needed lor a few r"o'b>!, andas maybe sulicent
toenaole the T eisury punctual'/ to di<-cra"ge,
during that year, all the liabilities mposed by Con-
gress.
There is another coBtwgen"y under the exist ng
laws, as to duue-% whit h requires attention, wi'i a
view to be preper'y prepared for ii, fhoigh legts-
' lation concerning the subject is not n°ces~ary so
early as in the other case, because ihe ev ent on
whieh it depends cannot actually happen till the
year 1842
Thus Ihe progressive reduction of the prevent ta-
riff, which has been going m s nee 1833, wil', after
December, 1841 t ke effect to a maca larger ex
tent than heretofore. Nearly Uto rn'hons and a
half of dollars w 1    then be deducted a! orce.
Oa the 1st of Jj'j rf ervat 's, at least Uo mil-
lions an 1 a half iicie of dut es wilbe removed,
raak 113 an aggregate, in mx mon'n-, of qui'e fi e
millions If th  imr-or > th n sh uld not differ

be necessary to make cenesp^ndini re ¡uc nns it>
the expenditures ot 1843 or «e sjnably provee
0 herwise, m som- permanent ma n°i, to supply
any wants likely to happen from this cans
Should Congre' i cone'u le that s tch reluction m
the expendí u^c  cannot p opetlv ba mj'e, und th->t
the impo-ts for 1812 will mt i"ue?5- bevond tho e

millions, S ich a dthetency would, un er thc-e
ctrcumstancs b,. hlrely to become permanent, and
may be c nsiderea the ihst cf that charaetu which
will occur under ihe lanff ac* oí 1833.
The idea that such a deficiency m time of peace
ought to be supplied by issues of Treasury notes,
or by a loan, has never been eatertamed by the
undersigned Nor can it be countenanced by any
sound principles either of finance cr political ece
nomy. The inquiry then recurs, what other mode
would be more clioib'e' When we possessed an
extra^rd nary surplu?, it was considered prudent by
Congre s to make deposites with the States, with a
view to be returned in an exigency, rather than to
invest a per ion of it safely and productively, so as
to be reabz d in such an event. It would t-ierefore
be coisis'ent with that arrangement to recall, m
1 1842, such part of the surplus as may be then
!    needed
I        Tnat cojrse, however, appea s no< very likely to
be adopted, *ince the former power given to this
j   Department 'o reca'l these depoates hash en taken
away by C pgress
Another pr-cLcab'e mode would be to resort to
direct taxes But th s is sj unsui ed to the r^n^ral
