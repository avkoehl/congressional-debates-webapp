HEADQUARTERS FIRST CORPS,May 1, 1863.

Major-General SEDGWICK,

Commanding Left Wing:

The enemy appear to remain in their position, and, as far as we can learn, have not changed. I sent a deserter to General Butterfield direct last night, or rather this morning, who can give very valuable information in relation to the forces opposite here and above Fredericksburg.

The fog is so thick that we can do little but be ready to meet an attack, which are the orders I have given.

Respectfully,

JOHN F. REYNOLDS,

Major-General.

[P. S.]-Our scouts sent out toward the enemy's picket line reported a movement to me left, but it was not very reliable; thought to be their picket relief moving.
HEADQUARTERS LEFT WING,May 1, 1863-8.35 a. m.

Major-General BUTTERFIELD,

Chief of Staff:

General Reynolds reports enemy in same position in his front, as far as he can learn. Fog so thick nothing can be done except to be ready to meet an attack. Scouts report a movement to our left, but this is not very reliable; supposed to be picket relief merely.

General Brooks reports nothing new in his front. No diminution nor change in the enemy's picket line. The balloon has not gone up on account of the fog.

JOHN SEDGWICK,

Major-Genera, Commanding Left Wing.

MAY 1, 1863-9 a. m.

Commanding Officer, Sixth Corps:

There are no pontoons at engineer camp. Have sent Colonel Platt to look after the matter. When he gets to you, tell him twenty are reported by telegraph at Aquia.

DANL. BUTTERFIELD,

Major-General, Chief of Staff.

BALLOON IN THE AIR,

May 1, 1863-9.15 a. m.

Major-General SEDGWICK:

GENERAL: Heavy columns of the enemy's infantry and artillery are now moving up the river, accompanied by many army wagons, the foremost column being about opposite Falmouth and 3 miles from the river. Thee is also a heavy reserve on the heights opposite the upper crossing, and all the rifle-pits are well filled.

Very respectfully, &amp;c.,

T. S. C. LOWE,

Chief of Aeronauts, Army of the Potomac.
