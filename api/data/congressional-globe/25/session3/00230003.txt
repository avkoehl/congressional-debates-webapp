THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

Mr. HUBBARD was in favor of the motion,
but did not wish it acted on for the present, inas-
much as several Senators weie absent who might
be excluded. No inconvenience, he obseived,
would icsult fiom the delay of a day or two, and
he 1 o¡ ed the gentleman would consent to suspend
Í is motion for that time
Mr BAYARDsaid that if the motion prevailed,
the Chair would necessaniy take two or thiee
days time to appoint the committees in, and thus
the objection of the Senator, with respect to the
. bsonce of membeis, would be obviated. He
iound by the Journal that at the last session the
appointment of the standing committees was
vested in the Chair, on the motion of Mi. GiujM-
dx, andas the complexion of the body was nearly
the same at this session, he thought the same
convenience would result from pursuing a similar
couise now.
Mr HUBBARD observed that, if the order was
now passed vesting the appointment of the stand-
ing committees in the Chair, the gentleman would
find them announced when the Journal was read
to-morrow. He did not know whethei the ab-
sent Senatois would be excluded or not, but undei
the impiession that they would be, he would
move, if the gentleman pressed his motion, to lay
it on the table He hoped, howevei, the gentle
man would not press it.
Mr. BAYA P^Dsaid,cei tamly not The motion,
if adopted, must be adopted unanimously, and
the intimation of the gentleman that he wished it
delayed for the present, was sufficient to induce
him to withdiawit.
The motion was accordingly withdiawn.
MESSAGE PROM THE PRESIDENT.
Mr. WRIGHT, from the joint committee ap-
pointed to wait on the President of the United
States and inform him that quoiums of the two
Houses of Congress had assembled, and weie
ieadv to receive any communication he might
make, reported that they had pei formed the duty
assigned them, and had received foi answer that
the President would immediately make a com-
munication to Congress sn wiumg
A message was then leceived from the Presi
dent of the United States, by Mr. Martin Va*
BuRENjjr., his Pnvate Secretary, as follows
Fettow-ctlizens of the Senate
and House of Repi escntalives
I congratulate you on the favorable circum-
stances in the condition of our country, under
which you reassemble for the perfoimanee of
ynui official duties. Though the anticipations of
an abundant harvest have not everywheie been
icalized, yet, on the whole, the labors of the hus-
bandman aie rewarded with a bountiful return,
industry piospers in Us various channels of bus-
iness and enterprise, general health again pievtuls
through oui vast diveisity of climate, nothing
thieatens, fiom abroad, the continuance of ex
teinal peace, noi has anything at home impaired
the strength of those fraternal and domestic tics
which constitute the only guarantee to the success
and permanency of our happy Union, and which,
formed in the hour of peril, have hitheito been
honorably sustained through every vicissitude in
our national^ affairs. These blessings, which
evince thecaieand beneficenceofPiovidence, call
for oui devout and feivent gratitude
We have not less reason to be grateful for other
bounties bestowed by the same munificent hand,
and moie exclusively oui own.
The present year closes the first half centuiy
of oui Federal institutions, and oui system—dif-
fering fiom all otheis in the acknowledged, prac-
tical, and unlimited operation v. Inch it has for so
long a period given to the sovereignty of the peo-
ple—has now been fully tested by experience.
The Constitution devised by our forefatheis as
the framewoik and bond of that system, then
untried,has become a settled formof Government;
not only pieservmg and protecting the great pnn-
ciples upon which it was founded, but wonder-
fully promoting individual happiness and private
interests. Though subject to change and entire
levocation, whenever deemed inadequate to all
these purposes, yet such is the wisdom of its con-
struction, and so stable has been the public senti-
ment, that it lemams unalteied, except m matters
of detail, comparatively unimportant It has
proved amply sufficient for the various emergencies
incident to oui condition as a nation    A foimi-
dable foreign war, agitating collisions between
domestic, and, in some respects, rival sovereign-
ties, temptations to intei fere m the intestine com-
motions of neighboring countries; the dangerous
influences that arise in peuods of excessive pros-
perity and the antt-republican tendencies of as-
sociated wealth—these, with other trials not less
formidable, have all been encountered, and thus
far successfully resisted.
It was reserved for the Amei lean Union to test
the advantages of a government entirely depend-
ent on the continual exercise of the popular will;
and our experience has shown that it is as benef-
icent in piactice as it is just in theory Each
successive change made in our local institutions
has contributed to extend the right of suffrage,
has increased the direct influence of the mass of
the community, given greater freedom to indi-
vidual exeition, and restricted, moie and more,
the powers of Government, yet the intelligence,
prudence, and patriotism of the people have kept
pace with this augmented responsibility. In no
countiy has education been so widely diffused.
Domestic peace has nowheie so largely reigned.
The close bonds of social intercourse have m no
instance prevailed with such harmony over a
space so vast Allfoims or leligion haveumted,
for the fust time, to diffuse charity and piety, be-
cause, foi the fiist time in the history of nations,
all have been totally untiammcled and absolute-
ly free The deepest recesses of the wilderness
have been penetrated; yet, instead of the rudeness
m the social condition consequent upon such ad-
ventures elsewhere, numerous communities have
spiung up, aheady unrivaled in prosperity, gen-
eial intelligence, internal tianquilhty, and the
\v isdom of their pohticxi institutions Internal
improvement, the fimt of individu il enttrpusc,
foUeiedby the protection of the States, has added
new links to tne Confedeiation, and fiesh re-
wards to provident industiy Doubtful questions
of domestic policy have been quietly settled by
mutual foibearanee, and agncultme, commeice,
and manufactuies, mimstei to eacli other. Tax-
ation and public debt, the burdens which bear
so heavily upon all othei countnes, havepiessed
with compaiative lightness upon us. Without
one entangling alliance, oui friendship is prized
by every nation,and the nghts of our citizens are I
everywheip íespected, because they are known
to be guaided by a united, sensitive, and watch-
ful people
To this piactical operation of our institutions,
so evident and successful, we owe that mcieased
attachment to them which is among the most
cheering exhibitions of popular sentiment, and
will pi ove their best security, in time to come,
against foreign oi domestic assault
This, review of the íesults of our institutions,
for half a century, without exciting a spirit of vain '!
exultation, should seive to impress upon us the  i
great principles fiom which thoy have spiung; l'
constantandduect supenision by the people over ,
every public measuie, stnct forbeaiance on the
part of the Government fiomexercismgany doubt- ¡
ful or disputed poweis, and a cautious abstinence '
fiom all Hiteifeience with concerns which pron-
etly belong, and aie best left, to State regulations
and individual enterpnse                                           ¡
Full information of the state of our foreign
affairs having been recently, on diffeiont occa-
sions, submitted to Congi ess, I deem it necessaiy
now to bung to youi notice only such events as
have subsequently occuried, oi are of such im-
poitance as to lequne paiticular attention              j
The most amicable dispositions continue to be  [
exhibited by all the nations with whom the Gov-
ernment and citizens of the United States have
an habitual intercouise    At the date of my last ,'
annual  message, Mexico was the only nation j
which could not be included m so gratifying a
rtfcience to oui foieign lelations                             ii
I am happy to be now able to inform you that
an advance has been made towards the adjustment
of our difficulties with that Republic, and the res- ¡I
toration of the customai y good feeling between ,
the two nations. This nnpoitant change has been i|
effected by conciliatoiy negotiations, that have
resulted m the conclusion of a tieaty between the
two Governments, which, when íatified, will icfer
to the arbitrament of a friendly Power, all the
subjects of controversy between us growing out
of injuries to individuals     There is, at piesent,
also, i eason to believe that an equitable settlement
of all disputed points will be obtained without
fuither difficulty or unnecessary delay, and thus
authorize the free resumption of diplomatic inter-
course with our sister Republic.
With respect to the northeastern boundary of
the United States, no official conespondence be-
tween this Government and that of Great Biitam
has passed since that communicated to Congress
towards the close of their last session. The offer
to negotiate a convention for the appointment of
a joint commission of survey and exploration, I
am, however,assuredwillbe metby her Majesty's
Government in a conciliatoiy and fuendly spirit,
and mstiuctions to enable the British Minister
here to conclude such an arrangement will be
transmitted to liini without needless delay. It is
hoped and expected that these instructions will
be of a liberal character, and that this negotia-
tion, if successful, will prove to be an important
step towards the satisfactory and final adjustment
of the controversy.
I had hoped that the lespect for the laws and
regard for the peace and honor of then own coun-
try, which has ever characterized the citizens of
the United States, would have prevented any por-
tion of them from using any means to promote
insurrection in the terntoryofaPowei with which
we are at peace, and with which the United States
aie desnous of maintaining the most friendly ie!a-
tions. I íegret deeply, however, to be obliged to
inform you that this has not been the case. In-
foimation has been given to me, derived from
official and other sources, that many citizens of
the United States have associated together to
make hostile incursions from our territory into
Canada, and to aid and abet msuirection there,
in violation of the obligations and laws of the
United States, and in open disregard of their own
duties as citizens This information has been m
part confirmed, by a hostile invasion actually
made by citizens ot the United States, in conjunc-
tion with Canadians and otheis, and accompanied
by a foicible seizure of the pioperty of our citi-
zens, and an application thcteof to the prosecu-
tion of mihtaiy operations against the authorities
and people of Canada
The results of these cnminal assaults upon the
peace and order of a neighboring country have
been, as was to be expected, fatally destructive to
the misguided or deluded persons engaged in them,
and highly mjunous to those m whose behalf they
are piofessed to have beenundeitaken. The au-
thorities m Canada, fiom intelligence received of
such intended movements among our citizens,
have felt themselves obliged to take precautionary
mtasuies against them, have actually embodied
the militia, and assumed an attitude to repel the
invasion to which they believed the colonies were
exposed fiom the United States. A state of feel-
ing on both sides of the fiontierhas thus been
pioduced, which called for prompt and vigorous
mteifeience. If an msuirection existed in Can-
ada , the amicable dispositions of the United States
tovvaids Great Britain, as well as their duty to
themselves, would lead them to maintain a strict
neutiality, and to restrain their citizens from all
violations of the laws which have been passed for
its enfoicement But this Government lecogmzes
a still higher obligation to repiess all attempts on
the part of its citizens to disturb the peace of a
country wheie older prevails, oi has been rees-
tablished Dipredations by our citizens^ipon
nations at peace with the United States, or com-
binations for committing them, have at all times
been regaided by the American Government and
people with the greatest abhorrence. Military
incuisions by oui citizens into countries so sit-
uated, and the commission of acts of violence on
the members thereof, in oidei to effect a change
m its government,virundprany pi etext whatever,
have, from the commencement of our Govern-
ment, been held equally caminal on the part of
those engaged in them, and as much deserving
of punishment as would be the disturbance of the
public peace by the perpetration of similar acts
within our own terntory.
By no country or persons have these invaluable
principles of international law—principles, the
strict obsei vanee of which is so indispensable to
the piesenation of social order in the world—
been moie earnestly cherished or sacredly re-
spected than by those great and good menwho
fiist declaied, and finally established, the inde-
pendence of oui own country   They promulgated
