CAMDEN STATION, February 1, 1864.

(Received 8. 40 a. m.)

Major-General HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

The enemy is reported in heavy force, infantry and cavalry, threatening the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad from Martinsburg to Piedmont. General Kelley regards this as a formidable movement of Early's, undertaken for the purpose of driving our troops out of the valley of the Potomac, and destroying the extensive and important railroad property at Piedmont, Cumberland, &amp;c. As Early take his movement so soon after his late failure, it appears probable that he has obtained such heavy re-enforcements as he has deemed requisite to accomplish his object. The weather also has been much in his favor. We suspended all trains between Martinsburg and Cumberland last evening. Immediate re-enforcements appear to be required. I have ordered vigorous preparations to be made for transportation of troops from Washington and Baltimore, in case you decide to forward them. If you so decide, please advise the extent, so that we may arrange accordingly.

J. W. GARRETT,

President Baltimore and Ohio Railroad.

WASHINGTON, February 1, 1864-1. 30 p. m.

J. W. GARRETT,

President Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, Baltimore, Md.:

General Lockwood is ordered to send troop to General Kelley. Two regiments and a battery are ordered from here.

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.
