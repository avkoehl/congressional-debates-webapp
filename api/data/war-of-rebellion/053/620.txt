General BRAGG,

Chattanooga:

I have put the brigades in motion, but they are also necessary in Mississippi; so let me know why they are wanted that I may judge between Atlanta and Mississippi.

Colonel B. S. EWELL,

Morton, Miss.:

Major Barbour has shown me your dispatch of to-day. He is acting under my orders. I have turned over to Lieutenant-General Hardee the command in Mississippi, and will inform him when I relinquish the whole command, but fear that I did not explain to him that I should exercise the joint command until I left Alabama. I will inform when I leave the department.

J. E. JOHNSTON,
