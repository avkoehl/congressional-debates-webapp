Lieutenant Colonel S. F. Johnson telegraphs as follows:

Forty-eight [Kentucky Infantry] moved as directed. Colonel Sypert and Major Cheneworth [Colonel Chenoweht] passed Princeton in direction of Canton with 160 men, supposed to be to cover the movements of the enemy beyond Cumberland. Forrest, I think, will strike the river above Canton and thus cut off Forty-eighth from railroad.
