continent*! money, thatbarber'sshops were papered, and sailora
clothed with it, in derision of its worthlessness Returned from
their perilous voyages, these careless men appeared m the streets
dressed m all their hard earnings, the ragged remnants of a bank
tupt country's departed wealth and broken faith If 1 could buy
any thing with it, said Morris, I would not until thelast necessity,
but it will buy nothing, so it must be burnt as soon as it honestly
can. In Rhode Island, it was burnt at a mock funeral It is
common egregious misapprehension that the United States
have paid all their national debts Nothing can be a greater
mistake. Not a dollar of the sacred debt of the Revolution has
ever been paid
From the beginning of the year 1780 till the close of the war,
hard money was plenty, occasioned by the pay of the English
army and navy, and of the Trench army and navy m Ameiica,
importation of it from Havana, and loans efiected in Europe
The whole amount of American Government expenditures m
the year 1782, it is said, was but three millions six hundred
thousand dollars, and m the year 1783, three millions two hun
dted thousand dollars    In addition  to the   money acquired
through the English and French forces, and otherwise, as before
mentioned, some of the States, in 1782, at last began to tax both
property and persons    Partly owing to the difference between
war and peace, butstillmore to that between payments m haid
money and paper, the Government expenditures of the United
States, which, in 1779, were, in continental bills, nearly a hun
died and fifty millions of dollars, and, m 1780, nearly eighty
three millions of dolíais, decreased hi 1781, to less than eleven
millions and a hall in that money.  The precious metals attend
national prosperity, their influence on currency and prices is
quick and highly beneficial  paper money is the sign of national
distress    If the United States   had been well governed at
the acknowledgment of independence, to develope their re
sources and prosperity, com would have appeared at once
It will not do to estimate the intelligence or opinions of a conn
try by those of any conspicuous individual of it    Franklin
went on his French mission before continental money had
reached the lowest depteciation    He was instrumental before
he went in its emissions     The mottos and pictures on the
notes, Whose clumsy execution indicates the rude arts of that
time, are supposed to have been of his suggestion    After his
return he sent a letter, nowm the Bank of North Ameiica
proffering a quiri of paper as fit to make penny notes, and
some of these uttermost inflictions of debased currency are y et
extant    It was, however, convertible paper monev    The idea
of irredeemable bank paper had not then occurre 1 to the wild
est anti bullionist, nor broached till long afterwards as a tempo
rary expedient of war distress, to save Govern mem from bank
ruptcy, andallpiopertyfioma ruinous shock    The Bank of
North America, tlu fust institution of the kind established by
the United Stales, was not only founded on hard money but, as
its early records show did not issue paper much more thin
dollar for dollar guarantiid by the com in its vault"     Morns,
as the principal financier of the  American Revolution, ap-
pointed supon itendent of finances when Congress cieated that
office in 1781, a man, at one time, of immense wealth, and ata 1
times or acknowledged sagacity and financial talents, deserves
to be vindicated from the common imputation of having ever
been misled by the mnage of paper as a substitute foi metal
money    No such infiimity can be justly imputed to Ilobeit
Morris    English by buth, though I e came a boy to America,
and associated with that respectable mijonty of Americans,
who approved of Hamilton's adoption of much ofihe bankm ,
funding, taxing, protecting, and exclusive system of English
public economy, it is a common error to impute to Robert Mor
ris the origin of tho e pecuniary extiavagancies into which the
English system tinally sunk overwhelmed with irredeemable
debt    About the time when the British Government, 1 y a stu-
pendous imposture, well nigh banished coin from circulation for
nearaquarterof a century in that kingdom, thereby irres sti
uly templing the still more egretrious libertinism or Amencan
currency, offensive to the established and immutable laws of
money, Morns was involved in one of those lottei ieo of bound
less speculation, which mostly rum their connives and occa
sionally dlstempei Ihetiansactionsofcommnnities The notes he
dealt m were not bank bills, but his own individual piomi-.es (con
ueoted with one or tivo associates in his schemes )and it is proof
of either the credulity or the confidence of the public m him, that,
passing into many hands, they became a sort of ciieulatnn
Owing to the fulureof his plans, or the impatienc   of his ere
ditore, he did not íealize the great fortune he anticipated   but
wis degraded from the highest private and public respecta
bihty to indigence, insolvency,  and imprisonment     Foi a
long time he was actually besieged in his house, as a sane
tuary   from   sheriff's  officers,   with  processes   from  mdlff
nant credi ois,   nor   was it   without   much  difficulty that
he was enlarged ¿I length upon the sunendei of all his pro
perty, coeicively uken from him by insolvent anl bankrupt
acts    Yet so well founded were his much abused sr eculuions,

ha\e increased in value more than enough to pay all his ere

Nearly all dealings must beon trust  The loan of confidence is
indispensable to business But when paper promises aie sub
stituted for money, instead ofthe personal responsibility which
begets, while it affords, economy and i unctuality, and looks up
to supremacy of law, the mistaken credit thus substituted mostly
proves il'usory
Robert Morris's decline of life was clouded by penury and
discredit LlkeLaw, and other inordinate speculators, he be
came odious to socie y But private misfortune, without per
sonal dishonor, should not tarnish public character His name
is identified with the finances of the United States A Livy
like Italian historian has not improperly remarked that Mor
ris's services in the treasury weieas important as Franklin's
in negotiation, and Washington's in arms His financial ope
rations and correspondence fully exonerate him from any
attachment to paper money Opposed to tender laws, price
laws, and even continental money, his economy preferred solid
revenue in com raised by taxation During the three years of
Ins superintendence of the finances ofthe United States, from
1781  to 1784, he uniformly evinced a settled aversion to the un-
substantial currency of paper, and spared no pains to substi
tute com Through his personal exertions the first American
victory after the Declaration of Independence was gained at
Trenton, as is believed, by means of ten thousand dollars placed
at Washington s disposal The last victory of the war at York-
town was achieved by similar agency
It is to Morris the United States owe the establishment ofthe
first American bank, which he had conceived before the Revo
lution, and organized towards its close, as part of the Govern
ment machinery, to bear the stress of hostilities, a coin bank,
founded on gold and silver, with a note circulation, at first, lit
tie exceeding the coin in its chest The Bank of North Ame
rica, thus originated, was a Bank ofthe United States, incorpo
rated oy ordinance of Congress, the 31st December. 1781, pur
suant to a plan submitted by Robert Morris, the 26th May of
that year, for the support ofthe finances ofthe United States,
the exigencies of the United State, says the ordinance, render
ing its immediate passage indispensably necessary—confirmed
by act of Assembly of the State of Pennsylvania, the 1st April,
1782     Economists and statesmen disagree as to the utility of
banks empowered to issue notes, whatever their benefits maybe
as places of deposite As ibankmg has shot its rank roots and
branches around and upward since its first plantation m this
country, the cotton plant, which clothes Europe and America,
has not peen a more maivellous and influential giowth It la
said by some authorities to be the common law of England and
of the American States that banking is a franchise open io all
not asovereign pieiogative, exclus ve to G ivernment but the
banks of England, ofthe Unitt d Slates of Fiance, and of other
countnes, have all been Government machines and monopo
lies Legal lestiaints on bank issue  ol papei have proved
lutile Nothingbut an absolute metal curb can check excessive
issues and their ruinous decline, like falling bodies, increasing
as it goes Se luctive as strong drink, and explosive as high
steam, the sublimation of avarice by irresponsible paper money
always ha, had, and always must have, incalculable effects on
the currency the Goveinment, the morals and the men
ofthe United S ates So vast a power devolved by law on se
lect bodies of puvileged individuals, could not fail to revolu
tiomze liberal institutions Navigation d d not expatiate more
from its established anchorages when venturing acioss un
known seas from the Old, to find a New World Huloso
phors, poets even clergy, have celebrated the delightful fat ilities
of paper finance lo the ironical verses of Pope, and praises
of Voltaue, may be superadded the aravei encomium of
Bishop Beikely, who pronounced a Bank the philosophers
stone Yet Pope, Voltano and Beikely ha 1 no conception of
American banking To the meicantile mmd of Morris a Bank
was a natural, and, as he undeistoodit, not a bad ie=ource
Cien law's bmk contrived f>i a Regent—profligate and
cleai mmded-as i plank by which lo save the sinking finances
ol France, wiecked by the puerile piodigahties of Louis
XIV, n the national destitution which premised the levolu
Hon try chaos of that kingdom, was a well oiganized institution
not for borrowing or bickering, but keeping and lending goo i
money National banks, as Govei nment machines, have often
been found lelieTs in distress But for adjacent States of the
American Union to incoipoiate innumerable clandestine three
tones as sovereign entines with uncontrolled powers lo make pa-
per money and fix puces at pleasuie seems to be the legitimate
ofNpnng ofthe act of Congiess m time of revolution re
quuingsuch States bylaw to spoil people of their property at
prices hxed by law It is not easy to find in the Articles of
( mfeeleration the least particle of power to incorporate the
Bank, pursuintto the plan submitted by Robert Morris for the
suppoit ofthe finances, the immediate c eation of which sais
theoidinanco of Congress was rendeicd indispensably neces
sarybythee-tig ticies ofthe United States The ¡Vational Bank
thus oidarned, with a capitilof ien milliors of dollars, was
adopted by the Stale of Pennsylvania by law dated the 1st
April, 1782 bin soon after repealed by anothoi law of that State,
dated the 13th --eptember 1785 To reinstate the ' anl Moins
amnngothei experience I men, was then elected to the Legisla'
ture, which finally, on the 17th March 1787, íestored the Bank
of North Ameiica, with, howevei reduced capital and limited
privileges Synopsis of the discussion on ihat occasion, re

speakers in favor ofthe Bank principally by Mr Moms and
he power ofthe legislature to revoke a Bank charter which it
hadgianted was denied On the other hand, the opponents of
the Bank referí ed to the minutes of the House granting the char
ter, for a vote against the clause which was proposed to em
power a future Assembly to alter oi amend the charter, which
clause was rejected, for the express reason that the charter
must necessarily be always m the power of the House They
asserted that charters, as originally granted m the twelfth and
thirteenth centuries to towns and cities, exempting them from
the general vassalage then prevalent, were sacied instruments,
because they secured to the persons on whom they were bestowed
their natural rights and immunities, that charters are sacred
or otherwise, not because they are granted by legislative or
sovereign power, but according to the objects for which they
are granted, that if a charier is given for a monopoly, whereby
the natuiai and legal rights of mankind are invaded, it would be
dangerous tn hold that it cannot be annulled, that all charters
granting exclusive privileges, infringe on the gieat charter of
mankind, whose happiness is the supreme law, that the Legis
lature did not repeal the charter'of the bank foi misbehavior
of the "bank, or proceed on any allegation ol forfeiture^ but tak
ing the matter up on much higher ground, inquired whether
the bank was compatible with the safety and welfare ofthe
State, of whose mteiests they were the guardians letussup
pose, said Mr Srmlie, a Legislature so lost to all sense of then
duty, and so corrupt, as to give a charter of monopoly to five
men, for all our East India trade, and that the next Legislature,
beholding this monster m face ofthe Constitution, has not the
power to give redress—of what use would be annual elections'
If the House cannot afford a remedy ni such a case, the people
must have recourse to the means God and nature have given
them for redress The right of the House to repeal charters
was debated in the Council of Censors, and a member of that
body, nowm this House, and m favor of the Bank, conceded
the right of the Legislature to revoke th m The charter ol the
Bank was not taken away for what the president and directors
had done, but from a conviction of its dangerous tendency
The former House considering that the Bank was a bar to the
improvement ofthe country, and to agriculture, thought them
selves fully justified in taking away the charter The Bank
has not suffered the stockholders have gained enough Why
should we injure our country in favor of an institution mcom
patible with the public welfaie? Mr Whitehall said the ques
tion, at then present, was, whether the State should give way
to the Bank, or the Bank to the State, for the Bank was set up
asa paity in the State it had created great disturbance The
House did not take away any of their property Thecharter
was not their property It was a piece of sealed writing,
which the House might burn when it pleased Their property
was as safe as it had been The late Assembly did not take
away the charter ofthe Bank for any crime, nor charge the di
rectors wnh having forfeited the charter They took up the
consideration ofthe matter on general principles If charters
cannot be repealed because they are contracts, it affords a great
invitation to fraud Chartersof public corporations, when not
found agreeable to the we'fare of the people, may be taken
away by the Legislature Two instances of this sort have oc
curred m this State one was the chaiter of the college of
Pennsylvania, andtheother the charter of the Piopnetaries
All Governments, said Mr Fmdley, being instituted for the
good of the society to which they belong, the supreme legisla
tive power, of every community, ne essanly possesses a powei
of repealing every law mimical to the public safely But the
Government of Pennsylvania being a Democracy, the Bank is
mcensistent with the bill of rights theieof, which says that Go
vernment is not instituted for the emolument of any man,
family, or set of men Therefore this institution, being a mo
not oly, and having a natural tendency, by affording themeans,
to promote the spirit of monopolisms;, is mcorsistent with not
only the frame, but the spirit of our Goveinment If the Le
gislaturemay moitgage, or m other words, chai ter away, poi
tions of either the power or privileges of the State, if they may
incorporate bodies for the sole purpose of gain with the
power of making by laws and of enjoying an emolu
ment of privileges, profit, influence, or power, and can
not disannul their own deed, and íestoreto the citizens their
right of equal protection, powei, privilege, and influence, the
consequence is that some foolish and wanton Assembly may
parcel out the Commonwealth into little aristocracies, and so
overtuin the nature of our Government without remedy This
institution is inconsistent with our laws, our habits, oui
manners What secutity can we pioposeto oui selves against
the eventual influence of such wealth,conducted under direc
tion of such a boundless charter1
The last House did no injustice to the bank by repealing its
charter, they took away none of its property, the holders haye
their money,therefore it isnotlike an agrarian law, as the gentle
man alleged They may still keep a pnvate bank, and as a
pnvate bank is all the Constitution admits of, so it would have
the same advantages in trade and more security to the people
than a chartered bank
Mr Morris having said that the Assemby has the sole right
of granting charteis, but no right to take them away, that m
Great Britain, the sovereign giants charters, but he cannot take
(hem away—the laws of the land have pointed out another
mode of annulling them and that it might as well be said ofthe
Assembly of this State having exercised their sovereign autho
rity for the es ablishment of a land office fiom whence grants of
lands are made to individuals, that It has the right to exeicise
the same sovereign authority by destroying that i ffice, and re
stimmgthe lands agun, which wou,d be exercising the power
to aire and the powers to take away, but that the Assembly has
no light to such power
Mr iirdley answered that against the right of the legisla
ture to dissolve such charters, it has been often said that body
m °ht as well disannul the patentsof our lands and for the
same purpose agrarian laws have been impropeily mentioned
—but what do these arguments meani iü dissolving the charter
of the bank, the same thing as entering into it to t tkc away the
<*oId an 1 silver from the owners'* The dissolution of thecharter
is m°rely for the publicóse The right of the legislature is
so cleaily confessed by gentlemen of legal knowledge, it is so
essential to the safety of goveinment, that it would be an in
suit to the good serse of the House to say anything moie
about it
And Mr femihe added that the question of the right of the
Flou^e to takeaway achaitcr had been pi etty well discussed,
and seemed io be well understood, that two ofthe members on
the other side had coDce led the point, and that though the
olhers had not, yet the  aigun ents amount to that when our
situation is considered As charters are granted by the Assem
bly, they can be revoked in no other way than by the Assem
My They cannot be taken away by the courts of justice, as
they are given by the Legislature
