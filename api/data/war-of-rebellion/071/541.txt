The Honorable SECRETARY OF WAR:

SIR: The undersigned, appointed a Committee of Safety by the citizens of Harrisburg, state that they beleive it necessary for the successful defense of this city and vicinity from the threatened advance of the enemy of have a more efficient military organization than can be made under the present commander of this department. General Couch arrived here yesterday morning from Chambersburg. Soon after he left that place it was entered by a comparatively small force of cavalry, and the town plundered and a large portion of it burned, without any defense being made. General Cadwalader reached here this morning, but without authority to command. We unanimously consider that the interests of the service and safety of this place and of the Cumberland Valley require that General Cadwalader or some other efficient officer be placed in command of this department immediately. The people will organize for defense under the command of an officer in whom they have confidence.
