HEADQUARTERS BRIGADE HEAVY ARTILLERY, Madison's, May 21, 1864-9 p. m.

[General WARREN:]

GENERAL: I have the honor to report that I have reached this place with my command, and have taken up my position as below. My force is quite insufficient to hold the position against a determined attack, as this country is entirely open. I am throwing up a rail barricade (having no tools), and will hold on as long as possible. I would ask, general, that when it can be done with propriety, my command be allowed some time to rest, as we have been doing picket duty so constantly that officers and men are completely exhausted. If I can find any cattle here I will appropriate them as you suggest.

Respectfully,J. HOWARD KITCHING.

the right, and then appeared to be toward their rear. They were chopping during the night in front of our extreme left. This is the report of the officer in charge of the Third Division pickets. He says he would have reported earlier, but that he did not ascertain the facts definitely for some time, as the sounds were a good deal

confused.
