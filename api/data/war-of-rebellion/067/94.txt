HEADQUARTERS ARMIES OF THE UNITED STATES,Cold Harbor, June 9, 1864-4 p.m. (Received 2.05 p.m., 10th.)

Everything quiet except picket-firing, which cannot be prevented when lines are so close together. Not more than half dozen cannon-shots to-day. Our engineers, under General Barnard, are now at work on an inner line of entrenchments, to cover the withdrawal of the army from this position. Very probably this movement will begin to-morrow night. During truce of Tuesday evening our men brought from between lines 2 wounded men and 432 dead. They had lain there since Friday previous. General Meade is very much troubled at the report that after the battle of the Wilderness he counseled retreat. This is entirely untrue. He has not shown any weakness of the sort since moving from Culpeper, nor once intimated a doubt as to the successful issue of the campaign.

All quiet here since my last dispatch. A deserter who came into our lines this afternoon reports that Hunter's victory at Staunton was much more complete than the Richmond papers reported. Hunter took twenty cannon, many prisoners, and great quantities of stores. The force he defeated was recently a part of the command of Breckinridge.

Cold Harbor, Va., June 10, 1864-9 a.m. (Received 1.30 a.m., 11th.)

All quiet; even picket-firing has stopped. General Grant is waiting for report of Lieutenant-Colonel Comstock and Lieutenant-Colonel Porter, the officers sent Tuesday to General Butler, before to send an army corps to General Butler in order to make his position perfectly safe, while this army is moving to James River, and Lee is temporarily released from danger of being attacked. Should this be necessary, the mass of our force may remain here for several
