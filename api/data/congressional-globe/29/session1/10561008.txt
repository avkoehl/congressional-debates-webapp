THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
June 19.
It is strange, sir, that it should ever have been
claimed that an increase of duties did not increase
the price of goods to the consumer. To question it
ispreposterous, and the subject is one that needs not
be left to abstract reasoning, but is susceptible of
actual demonstration. Those who contend that the
price is not increased to the consumer, say that the
foreigner pays the duty. Now, in order to have
the foreigner pay the duty, the price of imported
goods must fall in the foreign market to the amount
of the increase of duty. By comparing the prices
of those foreign imports, upon which the duties
were increased by the act of 1842, in our com-
mercial rccords, in seven cases out of eight it will
be found that the foreign valuation on those im-
ports was higher in 1845 than it was in 1841. In
most of the cases where there has not been an ac-
tual increase, the price has remained stationary.
This, sir, proves beyond cavil, that the foreigner
pays no part of those increased duties. By an ex-
amination of that same commercial record, it will
be seen that upon those products upon which the
duties have been increased, in nine cases out of ten
there has been a corresponding increase m the
price in our commercial cities; showing conclusive-
ly that the increase of duties not only taxed the
consumer on the imports, but on the whole of such
production?, whether of foreign or of home manu-
facture. But, sir, this increase of duties produces
to the people of this country a greater injury than
the increased price of goods to the consumer.
That injury, sir, is the reduction in price upon
all the fruits of agricultural labor. 1 have made an
estimate from our records of the difference in price
upon almost all the productions of agriculture be-
tween the years 1841 and 1845, and I will have
published, for the information of the people of this
country, the result. I have made an estimate of
the amount exported, the loss on the whole amount
of each article, and the loss per cent, on each. The
gross amountofexports (estimated) is $75,954,528.
The gross loss to the farmers is"$32,839,939, or an
annual loss of forty-three per cent. As the price
in our commercial cities is the criterion of price to
the home consumer, when the puce in our com-
mercial cities is forty-three per cent, less, how
much do the farmers lose on their $1,000,000,000
worth of productions? I leave to gentlemen to esti-
mate and answer. The advocates of high duties
say the country is prosperous. I say that agricul-
tuie was never more oppressed than it has been
under the operation of the tariff act of 1842, and I
leave to the record to decide between us.
In the year 1841, agriculture was suffering a
most unparalleled depression. One of the a\o\ved
objects of the tariff act was to raise agriculture
from this depression. How far that object has
been obtained by the proposed remedy let the fol-
lowing table demonstrate. In the one column is
placed the amount of the different products ex-
ported in 1845, and in the other the deficiency for
which such product sold less than it would have
done at the prices of 1841.

This, sir, is the evidence of that prosperity so
much vaunted on this floor. This, sir, is the fruit
of that tariff so loudly lauded here. Let gentle-
men examine their rccords, one of which is on
their table, and the other in their library, and tliey
will convince themselves that though manufdctui ei s
arc heaping up their millions, the countiy is suffer-
ing; that the law giving bounties to manufac-
turers is sapping the very foundation of the pros-
perity of the country.
Let us suppose the goods produced by the dif-
ferent protected interests to be annually $280,000,-
000 worth. The protective duties average from
forty to onehundred and twenty-five per cent., and,
it is claimed, must not be reduced to twenty or thirty
per cent., or the manufacturers will be ruined. Is
not this an admission that they not only receive
the thirty per cent, above what they would receive
were it not for the duties, but at least a portion to-
wards the whole amountof the duties imposed?
Let us, then, suppose that those protected interests
receive only the benefit of the minimum protective
duty, which is forty per cent. This, then, would
give to them, and would be a tax upon the consu-
mer, annually, of $80,000,000. Through the effect
of the increased discriminating duties $32,800,000
is lost upon our exports, and at least $125,000,000
is lost on the home consumption. Through that
discrimination $5,000,000 is lost on wool; and,
in all probability, between two and three millions
of dollars will be reduced on the value of the wool
of this season below the reduced value of the wool
of the last. In 1840 it was estimated that the num-
ber of men engaged in the industrial pursuits was
4,629.307. This system of protective duties taxes
annually $250,000,000 upon 4,600,000 men for the
benefit of the residue. Now, these estimates look
large, and, wereitnotfor the record-proof, would be
incredible. But our records show them to be true,
and I think gentlemen will not attempt to controvert
them. Why, sir, should we have seen such alarm
here lest these protective duties should have been
exchanged for Oregon ? What could have induced
gentlemen to prefer war with England rather than
have these duties reduced? War with England
would not only cost us much blood, much injury
to our commerce and our commercial cities, but
cost us millions annually of treasure. And yet the
friends of this protective policy—these representa-
tives of the favored few—prefer this war with Eng-
land rather than the reduction of duties. In charity
to these gentlemen we will not suppose that a small
consideration would have influenced this choice.
Jt would be an imputation upon them to suppose
that a consideiation less than $250,000,000 annu-
ally would induce them to prefer such calamities
upon their country.
But, sir, perhaps the most important considera-
tion upon" this subject of discrimination in duties
is, the corruptions that it is infusing among the
people, and the wild extravagance that it produces
in the whole operations of our Government. When
by legislation we bestow annually hundreds of mil-
lions upon a particular class of our citizens, can we
be surprised that the highest corruptions should be
witnessed at our polls? Ought we not to fear that
ere long it will visit even our halls of legislation?
When a powerful class of our citizens, backed by
a great political party, find it to their interests that
the pecuniary wants of the Government should be-
large; that every possible call should be created
upon the national treasury to increase the necessity
for high duties—can it be expected that the opera-
tions of the Governmentshould be other than waste-
ful and extravagant* Let men talk of economy;
every effort that can be made by the friends of
economy can only palliate, but never be effective,
till the foundation of the disease be lemoved. The
history of one single session of Congress under the
present system of duties, would he a volume of im-
mense instruction upon this subject. Ha\e we not
heard it made the boast, that the calls upon the treas-
ury would not allow of a modification of the tariff?
Have we not seen every effort made to cause this
prediction to be true, by causing these calls to be
large What appropriations, of whatever charac-
ter, have been asked for, that, when voting so that
their names do not go upon the record, these friends
of a protective tariff have not been found noting
for''—what calls upon the treasury proposed, that
these gentlemen have not favored? After having
endeavored to infused moral courage into the
hearts of our enemies, by telling them, from our
halls of legislation, that their cause was just, and
that they deserved honor for promoting it!—after
having attempted to damp the moral courage of our
soldiery, by telling them that our cause was unjust
and infamous, and picturing: to them m glowing
colors the visitations of Providence, by pestilencc
and the s woi d !—after having; attempted in this way
to chill their hearts and paralyze their arms, they
arc very willing to put something into their pock-
ets, by imposing new burdens upon the treasury.
With these men moral courage is nothing, money
everything. With them, patriotism should not be
in the heart, but in the pocket. With them? though
they encourage our enemies and dampen the cour-
age of the champions of our country, it-is deemed
an act of patriotism in those who can devise new
calls upon the treasury, and impose new burdens
jupon the people. Sir, in advocating unrestricted
commerce, I have been charged with advocating'
British interests. In justice to myself arid the
cause I am advocating, I will call the attention of
the House to our commercial intercourse with
Great Britain and her colonies for the past few
years; and upon this examination I will submit
the matter to the consideration of the people and
their Representatives here. In 1841, Englandand
her colonies bought of our productions to the amount
of $62,366,402, for a part of which we took their
goods; but a balance was left in our favor of $12,-
600,000. In. 1842 they bought of us $61,720,876,'
with a balance in our favor of $17,400,000. In
1843 they bought of us $46,901,830, with a balance
in our favor of $17,700,000. In 1844 they bought
of us $60,064,545, with a balance in our favor of
$11,000,000. Now, in these estimates the imports
arc valued in the foreign market, and the exports
in our home market. The advance prices between
the home valuation on our exports and the prices
for which they sold in the foreign market, consti-
tute the commissions which sustain our commerce.
In our sales to Great Britain and her colonies, these
commissions probably amount to between fifteen
and twenty millions annually.
Now, sir, it will be seen by this record, that we
sell to England and her colonies annually $60,000,-
000 worth of our prodnctions,and have annually a
balance of trade of about $15,000,000 in our favor.
In the doing this business employment is found for
60,000 of our citizens, who are paid by'English-
mcn out of the commissions estimated. It pro-
vides us a market for the supplies consumed by
this 60,000 men, for which Englishmen pay out of
those commissions. Our citizens get a good inter-
est on $60,000,000 of capital invested in this busi-
ness, which Englishmen pay out of their commis-
sions. This, sir, is called British interests by the
advocates of protection. To tax the people $250-
000,000 annually for the benefit of manufacturers;
to give to manufacturers the power to bu;y-all our
agricultural productions at- their own price; to com-
pel the people to buy all their goods of the manu-
facturers at the manufacturer's price, is what they
call American interests. Upon these definitions of
the terms, I am willing to submit the question to
the consideration of my countrymen. It is ob-
jected to the revenue bill now under consideration,
that it will not produce revenue enough to meet
the large appropriations made. In answer to this
objection, I say, first, that the opponents of this bill
have striven in favor of calls upon the treasury,
very much as though they wished to increase the
strength of this argument. To prevent recurrences
of this kind is one important reason why this act
should be substituted for the act of 1842. In the
second place, I say that the bill under considera-
tion will produce as much revenue as would accrue
under the act of 1842. By the existing act, high
duties are imposed upon a part of our imports, and
low duties or no duties are imposed upon the resi-
: due. Now, to render these more equal, and sub-
• ject only to a more moderate discrimination, would
; not, as a matter of course, materially alter the rev-
; enue accruing. If it made any alteration, it would
, be to increase rather than diminish the revenue.
■ Without an^increase of imports, the revenue would
not diminish sensibly; and, as England is about to
J take the duties off from our agricultural produc-
[ tions, if we reduce the duties on such imports as
•arc taken in exchange for our exports, have we
; not reason to anticipate that both exports and im-
, ports will be greatly iuereased ? Tf so, have we
j not reason to anticipate a greatly increased rev-
:enue ?
| When the duties are not protective to manufac-
j turers, they raise a clamor that the consumer is
1 taxed by the duty. Does it make any difference
' to the consumer whether he is taxed for his hat
, rather than his coat, for his food rather than his
'clothing? No, sir. When the tax must be paid
it makes no difference. If, however, when he is
I taxed for his hat and food, he only has to pay the
, tax, but when taxed upon his coat or clothes, he
j is not only required to pay the tax, but has the
| whole value of his labor reduced, then he will sec
' the propriety of having the duty levied upon his
