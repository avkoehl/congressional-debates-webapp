shall be pnvileged from arrest'etc, 'and for any speech or
debate m eithei House, they sHail not be questioned m any

clear it intended to provide, simply, that for 'any speech or
debate in eithei House,' the member shall not be held to an
awex in any other place That he shall not, foi example be
subject to be prosecuted in the courts for libellous icords
spoken in debate, or be held to answer in an action qfslan

You have passed no law declaung them They are unknown

period, however remote, be piosecuted foi a libel, or sued lor
slander And should it be attempted, he may plead Ins con
stitutional exemption in bai But, because this is the case
it cannot, surely be contended that he is protected, more than
any other citizens, from peisonat violence * * * If the

"The question submitted to the decision oí the constituents

' I undertake to show, en, that the powei wmch Una House
now assumes to exeicise without law is the idem ca pow r
wheh Congress attempted to assum* in the enactment of the
'alien and sedition liws,' and thai the arguments ailuced
to sustain it aie the same argumenta adduced lfl ]798 to sj&tiin
the constitutionally of the 'alien law' and the 'f¡e huon law    >
"The power is despo'ic depending upon your whim ca i ce
f1* arbitrary will, and is theieloie it py^bl a create n a*
sion of the rights of 'he citizen ond mote despotic and win

"But if it b cone ded tr*at, inh gh paity times m p riot a
of high political excitement, or m cases where the j jmdi~non
and power of the House were not drawn in question, the House
may nave exercised the powei, die answer to any aigument
drawn from such premise-, is an easy one It is, that one usur
pation can never eitherjiibtify or sanctify anothei   '   *    *
'To show the absurdity ol the exercise oi such a power by
rhis House, if it possessed it without law, 1 ask the If >use
xoha* punishment it will inflict if the accused be ftundguiltv

"The evidence before us hhows that when the membei from
Ohio first thought himseh in dangei of an attack from the ac-
cused, hedidnot then bring hii> complaint to this House, hut
prepared fu msel i wthdead'y wea¡ on-s foi mot tul combat and
nut himself on his pergonal defence Bysodoipg, hf waned
thepricilege, if he had any, which it is now insisted has bet n
violated He was, in fact armed at the meeting, and his ad
versary was unaimed He happened tu gel the worst of the
rencontre, and then the complaint is made to this House, and
we are called on to avenge the wrongs which he has suffered
f f the member from Ohio had been the neto? in the comba ,
if his pistol had not missed fire ami had he disabltd or slain
the act used, this House would never have been tiouMed with
the ease But as he happened to be un/oí túnate m the fight,
we are told that our dignity has be^n insulted, and out hi°"h
privileges invaded"   *    *    *
'Sir, I know that it is, at ail times stñun07acious argument
to address to any body of men like this, when you te'l them t hut
thev possess no power to do that which they aie strongly do-n
rous of doing All history instiucts us that whenevei tin

Still, the deed is done* . There stands the record
Who could h^ve support. I, sir, thai altera 1 this, i e -> pi
arpies would, Within so short % period, have been ua* «
ajid those who maintained them be found, as they now aie
ostensibly urging- the exercise of a power then denounced as
tUegttl, unconstitutional, usurped, despotic, od ou>'   Can it
Jbjs possible—can each shameless repudiation oí ot i nons and
principles be ereditedas that th  exercise of that same power
by that same party is really meditated in frasease? I do not
bebeve, sir, that it is meditated, or at any time has been I
am on the contrary, fully justified, by the facts which I have
just eta ed as connected with the recent history of that paity,
in rna ntaming that the Administration party m this House
kavf1 been perfectly sensible, from the commencement of this
investigation that, no matter how deep the criminality of those
implicated, they, as a party would be forced to deny to the
House any right or power whatever to punish it To take
any o her ground would m them, be so flagrantly and scan
da'ous'y repugnant to their former doctrines and action, as tu
expose them to imputations which the most abandoned pro<ui
tution might desne to avoid I icpeat, therefore, that the direct
assertion or exei cise of such a power, by that party, was at
no time intended
This view, sir, of the position of that party, in regatd to the
power in question, will at once explain the otherwise incom
prehensible foim of these resolutions, why they aie mdefini e
and general, and m that íespect contrary to the established
u^age and express law of the House For, sir, if they had been
direct and specitic meditating, in term1* an exeici^e of the
power which I have «rated, they must hate been instantly
i ejected by the Ilouae, certainly rejected, if the sentiments oí
that paity could h-ve prevailed Many of the paity whose
names are recorded in support of the doctrines which I have
imputed to them are now member*, of the House—gentlemen
high m station and influence all favoring these ptoceedmgs'
Th ^general and indirect form of pioceedmg wa^ accordingly

necuosanlj have presupposed the right and power to inflict it
Anda!! fhjsfni what?
With tht indention, sir, of seizing the occasion which it was
supposed the death of one gentleman ma duel with ancther
who happened to be a political opponent afforded, of diverting
pub'ic attention for a season from the wretched cordition of
public affiirs an 1 of effecting this undercolor of devotion to

How far the country will be disposed to countenance this de
hbeiate promtiuion of the ac ion. and ume of the House fci
such p irp ise^ c inot, I think be difficult to anticipate
Ari$ op r nn, sn, whichl may entertain with íespect to the
extent of the privileges of the House or its power to punish
violations of them need not be now expreqied as u is nor de
man ded by the immediate question That those in opposifon
should holdj as a pai fy, that the power of the House v. ¿t* fu1 y
adequate to anj measuie of punishment domandert by the ev n
in whith the>e proceedings oris naTed would be" altogelhei
nauiiral and consistent Ihey had so held on former occasions
when political adversaries were implicated, th^ir opinion is
unalteied, their conduct is unaltered, though f oíitical/heñcfo
may be it ¡plica'ed I honor a constancy which contiasis so
sink ngly
If an> doubts sir, could have lemamed respecting the ¡rregj
lauty ofthisieport and the necessity of its recommitment, they
mufat have been wholly removed by the extraoidmary disclo
sme made, after a week's discussion, by the chairman of the
committee In answei to a question propounded by a gentle
man from Virginia, [Mr Wise ] the chairman confessed to the
inwement, douotle^s, of all who heard him, that the Report
had undcrgon? alterations after it had been last seen by those
who^e act it purports to be* He states, however that the alte
iations he thought, did not materially i ary the sense tint
they weie foi the mo&t part, but critical alteration*'
Su with respect o that report, l hono? was the subjectofis
simy" It impugns deeply, the honor of gentlemen, an honor
befoio spotles  Its texture is too delicate for sveh a touch
ftome\en the chairman of this committee The utter impío
pnety of altering a report, to any «stent or for any purpose, in
o icha case as tin  must be manifest to all who duly estimate
the va'ue of honoi or the delicacy of si tins, as thu committee
ha-s e a^u ned to do, in judgment upon lis laws This the chan
man shou'd have known
' Wno ¡rovems freemen should himself be fiee
The principie applies with even more truth to him who
would pa^f> ud0ment on honoiable men
I i* siloes ed, sir titat the repoit teas softened by the alte
latuuib That does not at all palliate theoutiage * If the meufo
of this leport sh ill ever become (which they will not) the sub
]e"tof revie v here it will be demostrable that an alteration b>
which is\ lolence was mitigated is more prejudicial to the ac
cuse 1 than one aggravating it Trom audacious morstion--
mj istiet, mnoce ice has nothing to fear, it defeats by i's enjr
muy, i 3 own purpose It i« dangerous only when it becomes
p'ausib'e ftuen, though no' the t"nth, it is made to resemb'e it
So with tiiisrepoit
But, sir, if the House were amazed by the annunciation that
¿n al eration of the report had been perpetrated, it must havt-
bean abounded by the declaration which accompanlet, it The
chan man p oceeuel, on the occasion referred to, with the
u'most complaff ncy, to di^clobc that the repoit, had not been
agreed 'y oi emis^enby a majority in actual committee but

Jai couise was, a*, a matter of order, at once to reject it Why
was this not doue"*
Will the applicability of this law, too, be controverted 1 Or
will an exposition of the principles on which it rests be required?
Sn, it seems as if law, standing by itself, and upon its own au
thoriiy, is of no consideration, merely as law, with ceitam phi
losophic jurists of this House 1 he principles, however, oí the
law m question are neither obscure nor difficult of exposition
The rule results necessarily from the nature of legislaiive com
mittees, which are organized official bodies, with their peculiar
privileges, powers, and duties, as such To the extent of their
functions they are as essentially organized and official as the
House of Representatives l'self In every parliamentary view
if would be as indispensable to obtain the consent of members
of this House, separately and privately, without entering this
Hall, to the highest and most responsible acts of legislation,
and ascribe to them the validity and effect of acts of the House,
& to obtain 'he consent of a member of a committee, in the pri
vate and irresponsible manner stated by the chau man, and in
si&t on it as the act of the committee The amplest illustrations
might be readily diawn from the judicial and other tribunals,
1 ut I will not suppose them to be required in a matter so pal
pable
Yet, sir, this interposition of the laws of the House oetween
the rommittpe and their purpose is sagely ptonounced excep
tion to form, technical, ecasive of substantial justice1 ¡sir,
when you heat those whose province it is to ..^cei *am and ad
minister thelaw as it is, pronounce its piovi^ions to be for-
ma! or technical or eva^ne, and on that account to be disre
gaided, especially m a criminal procedire, you have the
authority of history for Pionouncing them eithei unlearned m
the doctrines or filthier to the principles of iieedons This
expression, I admit, is strong, but sir, it is pM
What is a free Constitution, what are law«, but ihe forms,
the technicality, the et asion mterposed betweci ths weak and
the poweiful, be ween the tyiant and his purpose? Sir, in the
vocabulary of fieedom, there is no justice no right, no
wiong, except as know?i to the Constitution a?id laics just as
