No. 1. Report of Colonel Harvey Brown, Fifth U. S. Artillery.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF FLORIDA, Fort Pickens, September 14, 1861.

COLONEL: A naval boat expedition, under command of Lieutenant [John H.] Russell, of the flag-ship Colorado, this morning, at 2 o'clock, burned the piratical schooner Judah and spiked the gun of the only battery in the navy-yard. The schooner was armed with five guns, and was lying in the slip in front of the battery, evidently awaiting an opportunity to go to sea. We lost three killed [one of them instantly, by one of our own party], four badly and three or four slightly wounded, among the latter Lieutenants Russell and [F. B.] Blake, [Captain E. McD.] Reynolds, of the Marines, and a midshipman. The whole affair was well conceived, well managed, and entirely successful.

I took it for granted it would cause the opening of the rebel fire on this fort, but until the present time no demonstration has been made.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,HARVEY BROWN,

Colonel, Commanding.

Lieutenant Colonel E. D. TOWNSEND,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
