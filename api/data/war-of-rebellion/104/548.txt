WAR DEPARTMENT,

Washington City, May 1, 1865.

Major General GEORGE H. THOMAS,

Nashville:

On inquiry I find that your recommendation in respect to Lieutenant Porter was laid over in the Adjutant-General's Office on account of the pressure occasioned by the recent calamity, and not brought to my notice. I have ordered his appointment as requested. In regard to your request for General Steedman to come here to present your views, I would rather hear them from yourself, because I want to see and know personally so good and great soldier that has served his country so well. I hope that before long the condition of affairs may permit your absence. If this should not happen soon, leave will be given to General Steedman.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.
