1864.
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
2679;
cent, ad valorem, payable in gold. In ft (able
which I will hereafter insert, the House will see
that all raw materials, dye stuffs, &c., used in
manufacturing, are. taxed with very low duties,and
eomeareadmitted duty free, rags, for instance,and
some 71,000,000 pounds of wool nearly free. This
is justified by the speech just made by the gentle-
man from Vermont, [Mr. Morrill.] Thus the
tariff of 1862 discriminates in almost every par-
ticular in favor of the manufacturer and against
the farmer.
How long will the class which I represent—
the agricultural portion of the community, the class
which possesses in the aggregate three fourths of
the capital of the country, who produce the great-
est share of its annual income, and who pay the
greatest portion of its taxes—submit to be de-
spoiled for the benefit of the manufacturing classes
under the specious pretext that it is done to stim-
ulate the industry of others, is necessary for rev-
enue to put down the rebellion and save the Union ?
RECAPITULATION.
I no w propose to show the results of the preced-
ing calculations in the condensed form of tables.
Table I,
Showing the cost of sundry articles imported
from abroad at the place of importation; the cost
in our market at the point of competition with the
home manufacture, including original cost; differ-
ence of exchange; freight, on iron only; duties,
and importer's profits, and bounties on the same
amount of goods to the home manufacturer in
dollars and rates per cent., reckoned upon the
basis of the standard gold currency of the United
States:

These articles are selected because they come
in competition with the largest classes of Ameri-
can manufactures. This and the following tables
are constructed upon the basis of the importations
of 1861, the census returns of 1860, and the rates
of duty imposed by the tariff of 1862, reduced as
nearly as they may be to the ad valorem standard.
I have not included the fifty per cent, additional
upon previous rates imposed by the recent joint
resolution; nor the additional tariff of the present
bill.

Estimated according to the standard gold cur-
rency of the United States on an aggregate value
of $497,729,900 of manufactured goodsof thede-
scription stated in the foregoing table?, the home
manufacturers, by reason of the difference in ex-
change, duties, and other expenses of importation
of foreign articles of the same kind, together
with the importer's profits, derive, through the
agency of the system of protection established
by the tariff of 1862, an aggregate bounty of
#302,753,342.
The tariff arid the other expenses of importation
enable the home manufacturers to charge and levy
upon the people of the United States that enor-
mous sumeveryyear ingold; supposing the man-
ufactures of the country to be the samem amount
as in 1860, and the tariff the same us that of 1862.
if the rates are more, as this bill proposes to
make them more, the sum would be greater; if
less, it would he less accordingly.
The population of the United States in 1860
was31,445,080souls. Consequently the propor-
tion per head of this enormous bounty exacted
by the manufacturers in gold is $9 62.
Estimated upon the basis of the irredeemable
paper currency of the United States, depreciated
only in the ratio of $160 m paper to ^100 in gold,
the aggregate bounty levied by the home manu-
facturers on the people of the United States on the
same amount of domestic manufactures, namely,
§497,729,900, is $750,250,252, or $23 88 per head.
When, therefore, I propose to amend this bill
so as to have these duties payable in the paper
currency like other public dues, 1 intend, with
full knowledge of its effect, to strike off at least
§14 26 per head from the burdens whieh labor
pays fiom its hard earnings to protectand pamper
the " splendid paupers" who are thus living upon
the bounty of others. I intend to save from the
grasp of the millionaire and nianufactuirr and for
the benefit of the poor man and consumer, the
sum of $447,496,910 on the rates of the tariff of
1862. If the pi ople must pay bounty to the cap-
italist, is it not enough to pay it in the ordinary
paper currency by which we are measuring other
values ? Is it not enough to pay a bounty in paper
equal to the sum of $302,753,342 wow levied in
gold upon the articles enumerated? Think of it!
For the iron which we use in all its varieties of
adaptation; for the cotton we wear, whether printed
or plain, in the calico dress or the shirting; for
the wool in blanket, carpet, or clothing; for the
newspaper, book, and pamphlet; for the leather
we use when tamie'd or manufactured into boots
and shoes; for the clothing we buy already made
up; for the soap and candies and fndia-rubber
goods; for these only, under our tariff of 1862, and
not counting our recent increase or the proposed
