At this time it is believed that the Twelfth and Thirteenth Regiments of Cavalry (on the plains) and the Fifteenth Regiment of Infantry (in Texas) cannot be relieved.

The attention of Major-General Thomas, commanding Military Division of the Tennessee, has been invited to your request relative to the Eleventh, Twenty-first, and Forty-ninth Regiments of Infantry, now serving in the Department of Alabama.

On the 11th instant General Thomas was ordered to reduce the aggregate force of white troops in the Departments of Alabama, Mississippi, and Georgia to 7,000 men, and it is very likely that the musters out of the Eleventh, Twenty-first, and Forty-ninth Regiments will fall under that order.

I have the honor to remain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

THOMAS M. VINCENT,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
