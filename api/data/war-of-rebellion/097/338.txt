DABNEY'S MILL, March 31, 1865.

Major-General MEADE:

The operators at my headquarters have gone to the wrong place, or are still back. If at your headquarters will you please have them sent here to-night. I think Warren should be instructed to send well down the White Oak road, and also southwest from his left, to watch and see if there is an enemy in either direction. I would much rather have Warren back on the plank road than to be attacked front and rear where he is. He should intrench front and rear of his left at least, and by ready to make a good fight of it if he is attacked in the morning. We will make no offensive more ourselves to-morrow. If rations were not got up to-day they should be in the morning.

Lieutenant-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,March 31, 1865-5.30 p. m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

Sheridan's firing was heard soon after you left. I have sent word to Warren to push a force down the White Oak road to co-operate with Sheridan. I will send you a list of casualties as soon as possible. At present Second Corps hospitals report 200 wounded; Fifth Corps, 600. I think the casualties for this day of killed and wounded in both corps will be under 1,000. Some 60 prisoners have been reported by the Second Corps and 70 by the Fifth Corps. this will doubtless be increased, as all have not yet come in. Second Corps reports 2 battle-flags and Fifth Corps 1.

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,March 31, 1865-6.36 p. m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

A staff officer from General Merritt was cut off by what is reported two brigades of Pickett's division. These are the brigades reported to be on our left, but not in our fight to-day. The firing has receded toward Dinwiddie Court-House. If General Sheridan reports that he cannot overcome the force now opposed to him I will be obliged to contract my lines, and I must do it to-night. I have directed Warren to send a force down Boydton plank road to try and open communication with Sheridan. Under the present state of affairs it was impossible to send down the White Oak road, as first ordered. Please let me know in regard to Sheridan's report as soon as convenient; my disposition against these brigades should be made shortly. I leave for my headquarters at old camp.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.

DABNEY'S MILL, March 31, 1865.

Major-General MEADE:

I send you copy of a report just sent by Sheridan.* You will see that he reports Hoke's division, which we know was in North Carolina.
