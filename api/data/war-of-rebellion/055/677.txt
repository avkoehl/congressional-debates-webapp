MISSION RIDGE, November 24, 1863.

General S. COOPER:

We have had a prolonged struggle for Lookout Mountain to-day and sustained considerable loss in one division. Elsewhere the enemy has only maneuvered for position. Nothing from the northeast. Telegraph not working. Jones should press on.

GENERAL: Lieutenant-General Hardee directs that you relieve Garrity's battery on Lookout Point, and direct it to report to Brigadier-General Anderson on the right of the line. Place two Napoleon guns at this point. Lieutenant-General Hardee desires me to say that this order was sent last night at 8.45 p. m.; no acknowledgment of its receipt has yet arrived here.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

HEADQUARTERS MOORE'S BRIGADE, November 24, 1863.

[Major J. J. REEVE,Assistant Adjutant-General:]

MAJOR: The enemy have formed line and commenced skirmishing with our pickets near the railroad-bridge crossing of Lookout Creek. Cannot yet tell their object. When shall I place my brigade in line? Walthall is now on the left with his brigade.

Respectfully,

JNumbers C. MOORE,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

[Indorsement.]

The above is a copy of dispatch received from General Moore at 10.05 a. m.

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS CHEATHAM'S DIVISION, November 24, 1863-11.30 a. m.

Major J. J. REEVE,Assistant Adjutant-General:

MAJOR: General Moore, whose brigade is one of the two now at the Craven house, informs me that he has only 30 rounds of ammunition, and that his arms are very inferior. In case the attack should be made on that point, I respectfully suggest that a brigade be sent to re-enforce.

I should think that any movements of the enemy could be discovered from Lookout Point very easily.

I am, major, &c.,

JOHN K. JACKSON,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
