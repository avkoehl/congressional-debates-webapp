The principle of exchanging rebel officers captured by us and who had resiged from our Army has been recognized by the exchange of several officers-among others De Langel and Pegram-though in no instance done by me.

The exception made in yous of the 18th instant through General McClellan I have not yet broached to Generals Huger or Cobb lest it should embarrass negotiation and prevent the prisoners including hostages now in transmit for the North coming forward to these headquarters.

Am I to adhere in any event to the exceptions made in yours of the 18th instant? Repoy immediately by telegram and mail.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOHN E. WOOL,
