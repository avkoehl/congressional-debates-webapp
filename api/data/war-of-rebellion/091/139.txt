I send forward this evening the horse battery, Sixth Independent New York; also Captain Livingston's train of artillery ammunition, 20,000 rations for Winchester, thirty-five wagons of medical stores received from Washington. I shall send forward to-morrow all cattle required for front, and additional medical supplies for wounded. I am now without troops for escorts of any kind, having sent forward everything. Shall send to-morrow's trains with remounted cavalry from Remount Camp. Allow me to congratulate you upon brilliant victory, and wish more success and additional honors. The country can but be most grateful to you and your noble army.

Respectfully,
