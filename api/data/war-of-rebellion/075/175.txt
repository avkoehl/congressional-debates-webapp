left, and I am in hopes we will be enabled to take the enemy in flank. General Cox has carried one line of rifle-pits in his front and two redoubts. We have taken but few prisoners. They all report, however that Johnston's entire army is here in the intrenchments, having sent back all their baggage and wagons, and have nothing with them but ambulances.

Major General GEORGE H. THOMAS,

Commanding Department of the Cumberland:

General Sweeny has got a brigade across the river at Calhoun Ferry, and General McPherson, by advancing, has gained a very important series of hills in front of Camp Creek, within easy range of the bridge and town of Resaca, by which he has weakened his relative position. He will his Fourth Division (Harrow's), which is on right of Butterfield. Please let Butterfield relieve Harrow, and General McPherson will use Harrow's division in support of his present front line. The general presumes you will withdraw from the left some of Hooker's troops, which were sent to re-enforce that wing, inasmuch as Schofield has been re-enforced by Hovey's division. Please answer immediately, as General McPherson is here now.

I am, &c., yours, truly,

L. M. DAYTON,
