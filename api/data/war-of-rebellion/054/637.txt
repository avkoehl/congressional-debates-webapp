Captain Lilly's (Eighteenth Indiana) battery of four guns,in command of Lieutenant Scott,was immediately placed in position, and the Second Michigan Cavalry ordered to its support. The Ninth Pennsylvania Cavalry was ordered forward on the trot to support the First Tennessee Cavalry. A part of First Tennessee Cavalry charged the enemy's dismounted skirmishers, killed 3 and capturing 15 prisoners, whereupon the enemy opened an artillery fire with three guns,which were fired with great precision, but fortunately very few of our men were injured.

Two guns of the battery were immediately ordered forward and placed on the hill near Hays' Ferry, 4 miles from Dandridge, skirmishers were thrown out to the front,and the two guns opened upon the enemy

half a mile distant, scattering their line and starting them back.

At this time an order came from Colonel Garrard, on my left,to move forward on the same road, and saying that his brigade "would move on a side road to my left, and be not more than 2 miles distant at any time."

I immediately advanced the Ninth Pennsylvania Cavalry in column along the road, and the First Tennessee Cavalry in line on the right of the road and resting on French Broad River. The Second Michigan Cavalry was placed in line dismounted, to support the battery. After the Ninth Pennsylvania and First Tennessee Cavalry had advanced half a mile, I received an order from General Elliott* to return to New Market immediately, which order I forwarded to Colonel Garrard, recalling my regiments in front. The enemy soon commenced firing in my rear, charged with three regiments, and captured two pieces of my artillery not in position. I at once ordered Second Michigan and Ninth Pennsylvania Cavalry to charge and recapture the guns, which was executed with great promptness and gallantry,the guns recaptured and the enemy driven nearly 1 mile,with heavy loss in killed and wounded on the field and 14 prisoners in our hands. Being now surrounded by the enemy, one brigade in front and one in my rear, I sent to Colonel Garrard for support,which he did not send. I then ordered my artillery, ambulances, and led horses into the woods to the left of the original front,and marched them by a path as rapidly as possible toward the New Market road. Also the Ninth Pennsylvania and First Tennessee Cavalry to follow, keeping the Second Michigan Regiments discounted and fighting the enemy as they fell back, covering the rear of my column.

After marching 1 mile through a country, the enemy pressing hard my read and left flank, I formed the Ninth Pennsylvania Cavalry on that flank and fought them until checked, and at the same time placed the battery in position 1 mile beyond, with the First Tennessee Cavalry in line for a support. The enemy still pressed my rear,the Ninth Pennsylvania Cavalry falling back to the artillery,the Second Michigan Cavalry falling back slowly, keeping up a vigorous fire. I then opened a withering fire with my artillery, four guns firing rapidly, which checked the enemy for a few minutes,but soon they pressed on. I then ordered the First Tennessee Cavalry to charge with sabers, which they executed most nobly, driving the enemy's line over a fence, with severe loss to their ranks; the loss of the regiment in this charge was 3 killed, 2 officers and 7 men wounded,
