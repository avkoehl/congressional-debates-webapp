Pre-emption to settlers—Mr, Ranpolplu
II. of Reps.
National i i asury to exchango for wild lands far away, and
which genially lie many years before a return of profit is
t lüad In my opinion, air, it would be much better that our
juj i oí wealth should employ then capital m business, and
that Government should keep ite lands until wanted for actual
us*1 and then sell them to the settler, and let him take the use
on them Sir, I should be glad to see our whole policy in this
re. pect ch tnged We have too much land thrown into general
market  «ice, it is the inevitable íeault of our pie&ent sys
tem, if fcd't,s were limited to actual settlers, it would not be so
But, sir, I da not eren hope to change the system at present,
time will do it
I have, Mr Chairman, before me, a letter wiitten by agen
tlern^n who has resided for several years m the noithem part
of 1! mois, whwli describee the actual state ol things as I be
litve them to be, so well, and which is so full of good sense and
sound views that, with tho leave oí the committee, I will read a
part of it
Mr Loovns hoie lead the following extracta from a letter
Julie r, (Illinois,) January 20,1838
My1)earSib, Having noticed a hill to  giant  preemptions
to settlers on puche lands, I take occasion to do what I hold it
to be the unbounden duty o! every man in the West, who has
an acquaintance at Washington, either m Congre^orout  via
to urge upon you what kind of a preemption justice, stnet
justice, demanda
It is impossible for an Eastern man to undeistand oui e\a< t
situation without visiting us, but you may have some í unt idea
when I inform you that more than one-half of theemigiaats to
this country, irom ¡New \orkaid ¡New England, come here foi
the first time, with then families and then all, m the fall and
winter, undei the full expectation of puichasing Government
lands at$l 25 per acie The idea of seising upon public lands,
and appropriating without compensation, is as abhorrent heie
as it is abpurd But the emigrant arrives, stops at a convenient
testing place for his family, and reconnoitre* the country foi
his desired future residence Judge of luí eurpn^e when he
learns thattheie is no landm market on winch he could eubsitt.
without a fortune to commence with, thaf all the lands m mai
ket have long ago bee  entered by greedy speculators, except
the extensive piainet. too (¿r from timbtn to allow of settle
merits Thw is the case ae íegarct  Illinois, Wisconsin mil a

What, then, can the emigiant do1 Up ha«i sold h & hoire at
tne East, (pei haps the sheriff sold it for him,) and by self denial
and sacriticcs has saved money enough to put chase 80, IbO, or
240 acred, at Government price He cannot i etuin, i! he does,
he has no home Speculators hold then lands altogethai beyond
his means They are non residents, too, andunknown,andtheie
is no Oihei rtbouice thin to do as otheis have done—as Go
vernmenthas peimitted and, by repeated pie emptions for ten
years past, tac tíy invited them to do, to wit, to go oa toGovern
ment lands not yet m market, in many instances not yet sur
veyed These are the facts, njt sufhcieutly understood abroad
The President himself has not seemed to understand them, but
his tesultsare the same, give us his recommendation, and we
are satisfied Aftei selecting a location, then, I say, from necea
sity, on Gavernment lands the emigrant commences substantial
imptovements,and moves on as soon ashis family can be made
comfortable lie has come a thousand miles to purchase a
home—he is íeady to purchase, and anxiously waiting Govern
ment to give him an opportunity
" There are m tins village nftoen families, the heads of whom
are on what is here called then 'claims' on Government land,
where they aie preparing log cabins íai's, dei wheie thev in
lend to move to, so soon as they can be made comfortable
Others have junt movtd on, and the numbei that d«nly settle
are dtogothei bpyond the behpf ol my man who has not been
here
"Now whit does yom law piopo &i Wny, to revivp the old
pre emption law, and cut off from its benefit all who were not
here in 1837, or, in other wordb, all who did not cultivate m
1837 To those who come aftei, it is well enough that they
come, but tht y aie not fit subjects foi Government protection
This looks to me too absuid, it reminds me of the proposition
once made m New York, to tax all lands within ten miles of the
Erie canal to t ay fot the ¡same, when those eleven miles oifweie
justas much benefi ed as tho ewithm the ten miles Strict jus
ticeimpeiatively demands that if vou «vill not makeyoui pre
emption law prospective, upon a íesidence and ceitain
amount ofculti ation, you should extend th- pre emptio t u
all who hue the necesaary improvement at the passage of the
act Any thing less must be aibiti uily exclusive I will '-ay
nothing of the amount of land, leav ing that to the libei ality of
Congress It is, however worthy of observation, that a m^jo
nty of the settles occn p., lbü acres prairie, and ñon 40 to80
ol timber ad mi t g, oi as neat to it as possible, 200 to 240acres
is almost indispensable, and limited to IbOpranie, with 10 to 80
timber, to include only such land as was previously m posses
<uon of the settler
"The misrepresentation constantly made of settler0 m Con
greso, and the preposteious claims of some of them to i ¡ore land
than is reasonable, I greatly fear will work injustice to nemass
of them, but theie nevtr was a subject of internal I gislation
where justice more earnestly demanded that all tltcircuni
stances should be understood, than m the case of pre *mptions
lI have taken this liberty with you, from our foi rm r acquaint
ante, and I have no doubt yuu will pardon any ttnn_ erroneous
Ifanv facts or views hete stated can be of the lei-*' advantage
t«the pre emption law, I shall be satisfied 1 have no claims
for pre emption, I know of no benefit I shall derive irom such a
law, but there are others, many of them your former conslitu
cn£ who, jgfrhe law be limited to the 1st January, will be no
better off than they now are, and yet who are bona fide settler",
some with their families on the lands, and others bt< pping in ti e
neighborhood, tvhile the men are pieparing their 1 uses A.c '
I said I should so for this bill I hope the chp i man oí the
rommittee who reported the bill will move to amci 1 it, bung
in* its provisions up to this time, oi to the 1st of Juno
Mr Chairman, I have prepared some furthei provisions
which are probably imperfect and defective in detail, but
which piopoaf to legalize madvante pie empti n settlers, to
obviate the objection ajrairm them as violators < the law bv

lands, not merely an e p.i i table ruju's secure ihej ettlement ,
their homes, and the earnings oí th^ir labor, but a itutciiffhf,
definite, and plain to be understood 1 hard'v0 ucipafe that
they will be adopted, for the reason that they ai r i npiecedente 1
here, to faraal know, and embrace an imp ut^ntpimciplc
whjcji ought to come in She mote íwposÍHg and dc'.beraie fotm
ol a bill from a committee, still I believe them just, and I can
at least place them on the íecord Itappears to rae that they
embrace a principle, that of a pre emption law for the future,
requiring an occupation for a given time, which should, and at
some time ft ill, be adopted
SPEECH OF MR RANDOLPH,
Oj? New Jlrsky,
In the House of Repi et>entaU ie$, Tuesday, June 12, 1833—
)                      On the biil granting Pre emption Rights
¡Mr Chairman When I moved that the committee rise, a
few (.veiungs since, it was not for the purpose of discussing the
meabuie now under consideration but meiely to have the
amendments punted, *o that thc>, together with the bill itself,
might be the moie delioerately examined Having, however,
been urged to vote for this bill, I will emb act- the pieseut, op
portumty to olfei some leasons why I utnuot suppoit the inea-

Notwithstanding the pleasant alteication between the hono
íahlechairmtnoí the CommittLe on Public Lands [Mi lioohj
and the honoi able membei fiom Illinois, [Mi Mai,] Ido not

thosb matteib, su,m which the whole countiy is mteiested, and
which, m die bosom of eveiy statesman, miould be paramount
to mete p"ity considei tlions The controversy, Mi Chan
man, as 1 undtrstand it, is rather Detween the old and the new
States, though in fact it should bo btiween all the & atPs, and
the land specula oa and those who ate dit-pi^ed to acqun«the
public lands insome illegal mannei, for 1 will attempt to show,
su, that the new as well as the old States aie mteiested to de

apology of the hbnoiable rhanman foi the Piesident—that,

noiable men bei fiom New \oik, [Mi Loomis ] comine as 1 e
doea Irom one of the "oldthnteen' lie told us, sn, that the
Nona ih m fa\or of the actua1 spttler "What, sn, the North m
favor oí those wno? m violati 11 of law, have taken possession
of the pubho domain' This, bir, is both new and strange, and
if it be so, I am at a loss to coniectuie by what alchemy so
stiancea tiansmutation of public opmi n has been effected
But not only is the North m favoi of these people, but the ho
norable gentleman sajs they date not insult the right ol the
posi.eet.oi The right of the possessoi, sn' Dare not' Why,
what tight has the possessor, socailed, more than any other
trespasser! h it intended to be intimated that these possessois,
having placed themselves bejond the law, and banded togethei,
have become so stiong that even the Government dare not
inteifere with them? Sir, whenevei a pact oi combination of
our citizens becomes stionger than the law, and may violate its
precepts with impunity, oui Government and free institutions
will become of little value
Mi Chairman, m examining the subject of the public landt,
I find that piioi to the act of the 24th o! A pul, 1320, they were
sold upon a credit of two, thiec, and foui yt irs, ar the mini
mum price of two dolíais The oiedit s)«tem, however, was
lound to opera c injuriously, ^o that on the 30 h of June, 1620,

system < uie emption laws which is sought to be revived and
extendef iv the present bill and which the honorable gentle
man fiom Illinois (Mr Ma\) says it is the mteiest of all to
encouiage, whethei he V coireet or not, let us examine
In the fu t place, Mr Chan man, thib system lebsen- the ave
íage amo i at of the sales of the public land&  as -> nidtter of
course, tht settler locates himself on the most valuable tiacts,
the richest o 1 th  best woodvdor watered, or possessing some
other peeu   tr benefit    This ciact he gets, without competí
tiun foi a <   Hat and a quarter per acre; the minimum puce of
land sales  and when the land m the vicinity ••ornes to besiti
veyfd,  \w     fered at public sale, the best Uact  being aheady
«old u\ l"i       pri emption law at the n 'iiiraum puce, u is not
to be ex pet     ' that the pooiei tracts wtilbimg moie than the
uchei  a^cir ¡ igly, all that is bold is disposed of for about a
dollar and a q iaitt,r pei acie by Uie tíovernm^nt, although the
set tier sel Is ha  choice uacts foi four or nvc, and sometime^
twenty or thirty, dollars per acre, and is then ready to locate
another pre emption right If, on the contrary, the pre emption
claims were disallowed, and the land surveyed ai d brought
fairly into market, and exposed to public sale. Government
would get the foul and five dollars per acie lor the choice
lands, which now die pie emptioner gets, dnU oí course the
average puce of public lands at crumg to the Government
would be much increased, and yet the permanent settler
would in fact pay no moie than he does now. Prior to the
parage of the pie emption Uw of 1830, the average tales of
public land amounted to fiom a dollai and thirty five cents to
a dollai and fifty cents per acre, whereas, since the passage of
that law, it has nerei exceeded a dollar and thirty one cents pel
acre Tn 1827, the average wis a dollai and forty two cents
per acre, the next > ear a new oi del of things commenced, set-
tleis begin to locate the public lands, in anticipation of the
passage of a pre emption law, and for that and the two sue
ceeding years the average ft a  only one dollai and twenty stv
cents per acie Fiom 1829 to 1828, being the time between
the commencement oi the present system of cash salea md the
anticipation of a general pre emption law, the land sales ave
raged one dollai and thuty five cents per acre, hut from 1828 to
lb3b, being; the preemption penod, the sales onlyaveiaged
one dollar and tw enty seven cents per acre, bung a difference
of eight cents per acre, or a loss of about tour millions and a
half of dollars on the aggregate sale-> during that peiiod Bye
wlier it is considered how much tht- desne of acquiring the
public domain has incieased since 1828\ and how inanj moie
competitois there have been since that period, and that the pre
emption laws have almost destroyed eompetiuóii at the public
^ales, it mu^t be obvious to eveiy one that themeiecompan&oii
of the average price of land sold pnox and subsequent to 1828
affords but a very faint idea of the actual amount pi I@as to
the Government, ausing from the pie emption laWb In 1636
the House of Repiesentatives published a document (Nn 211)
on this subject, fiom the General Land Oflice in a-letter,
dated Jauuaiy 28,1836, Mi Ethan A Brown, the Commissioner
of the Land Office, says, pages 6 and 7
"The preemption laws onginated and bestowed i ig'its, Int
lecognised none in the settleis as previously existing Icon
ceive they have no othei rights, in this íeapect, than what the
law confers, and that the preemption privilege may be con
sideied little else than a mere benevolence, enabling the ad
venturei to appropriate to himself the c loieest lands, most va
luablemill seats, and localities foi towns, at a vast coa to the
public, or, in other woids, pievcntmg the íeceipts of va&t
sums into the Tieasiiry It is confidently oelieved that these
privileges, coveiingatleastfsur millions of aeres of land, joined
with outrageous combinations to intimidate raurchaseis, and
other unjustifiable confederacies) have diminished Hie receipt
foi public lands, m t/ip yeai of 1835, full three millions ofdol
tors, at a moderate estimate, below what they would havr
brought in fair competition If frauds in pre émptions wpi.p
unknown, if no one obt lined a pre emption but upon a faithful
compliance with the conditions pi C3ciibcd, still the ¿election 
of the most valuable lands, and most de&uable situation*., at the
minimum price, would produce an effect upm the leveuue
too considerable to be overlooked by the fiiidnrru '
\nd in a lettai of Api il 11, 153b, the same officer lemarks
The estimate of three millions of dollars, which I had the
honor to submit to vou on the 2Sth of January last, appears vo
me now to u xdei ? ale, m uch ratnei than to magnify, the diflo
t nee between the íeceipts for pre emption concessions and the
sum the same lands would have brought into the Tiea^uiy,
had no impediment laid m the wayof full and free co upetitiou
fjr the purchase "
But, Mr Chairman, this system not only lessens the pues
of the public laud, but it leads to endless frauds and perjuries,
and in proof of this., I will astam refcr to the document Ño
211 *   The commissioner says, (p 7 )
' It seems to iñaahopelet,i, task to pi oject any Modification
of existing enactments that shall silence pa ja? y and defeat
the dev icea of sagacious speculator, so long as then mgf nui'y
shall be shaipened and stimulated by the piospect ol immense
gam attending their success '
Again (p 3 ) ' The public sale* are attended by combina
tions of two kinds interested in keeping bias down to the mi
npnum, the one composed of tho^e who have and tho e who
pretend toari-htot pieference, and to re&o¡¿ to intimida
tion, by tht eats and actual violence, «* exemplified mo^tpar
ticularly at the public salcb at Chicago in June, 1835, when
and wh-sre the controlling party is represented to have effect 
ally prevented those from bidding who .vert, lot acceptable to

"Itis said, on cudible autlnuty, thatpieparations appear
