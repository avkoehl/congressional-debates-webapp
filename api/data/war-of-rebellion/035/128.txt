HEADQUARTERS TWENTIETH ARMY CORPS,March 10, 1863.

Brigadier-General GARFIELD,

Chief of Staff:

I have just received a letter from General Davis, dated at 10 a. m. General Davis has started for Triune. General [R. S.] Granger had arrived at Versailles. General Davis says he will camp at Triune tonight, unless he finds out, after he gets to Eagleville, that there is no force between him and Triune, in which case he will go to Unionville.

Brigadier-General GARFIELD,

Chief of Staff:

Have just received the following dispatch from General Granger:

General McCOOK:

Received your order this morning, and published orders immediately to start at 7 a. m. Your messenger with dispatches for General Davis, has just returned, reporting that he was turned back by the enemy at the forks of the Versailles and Eagleville pike. They were, no doubt, General Davis' pickets, who is encamped but a mile from there. I shall return him at once, with an additional escort. My command amounts to only 2,500 men and two batteries.

R. S. GRANGER,

I have hear nothing this morning from General Davis.
