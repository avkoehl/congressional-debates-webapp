KNOXVILLE, TENN., November 16, 1864.

Lieutenant-Colonel TROWBRIDGE,

Commanding, Strawberry Plains:

I will send you re-enforcements. You are all right, if the enemy does not come on this side of the river. Keep a good lookout well up the river; send reliable men; and if you find a force coming on this side of the river large enough to overcome you, be all ready to fall back on this place. Have the bridge ready to take up, and if you find you must fall back before a force large enough to threaten the safety of this place, destroy the bridge.

J. AMMEN,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers.

KNOXVILLE, TENN., November 16, 1864.

Lieutenant-Colonel TWOWBRIDGE,

Commanding at Strawberry Plains:

I will send you Major Smith with strong re-enforcements on train. I will telegraph you when he starts. If before he gets to the Plains there should be an appearance of danger on this side, send ten or fifteen Tenth Michigan to meet Smith and give him waring and information; also aid him in reaching you. I have sent word to General Gillem and asked him to assist us. I think he will do it.

J. AMMEN,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers.

KNOXVILLE, TENN., November 16, 1864.

Lieutenant-Colonel TROWBRIDGE,

Commanding at Strawberry Plains:

Major Smith has started with train, men, and ammunition. Be sure to get information in time to fall back in case a very heavy force threatens you from this side of the river.
