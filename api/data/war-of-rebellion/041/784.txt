Major G. NORMAN LIEBER,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General:

SIR: With deep regret I have to inform you that a serious accident occurred this morning upon this railroad at a point known as "company canal," 8 miles distant from this station. A train, which left Brashear at 8.30 p. m., was obliged to stop at that point, owing to a defect in the engine, and send to this place for another engine.

As near as can be ascertained, the conductor of the train failed to take the usual precautions, as per rules and regulations, and just at daybreak another train, which was nearly or quite four hours behind the first, was thrown upon the rear of the train, crushing the cars in and upon each other.

The casualties among the troops which were being transported were 10 men killed, and between 60 and 70 wounded, many of the latter seriously.

These were principally men belonging to the Ninety-seventh Illinois Regiment, and were upon the second train.

I very respectfully request that a board of inquiry may be appointed as soon as practicable to investigate the causes which led to this accident, and to fix the responsibility upon the proper parties.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

E. A. MOORE,

Captain, and Assistant Quartermaster.
