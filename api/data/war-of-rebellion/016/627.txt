(Captain [J. C. H.] Bryant) and aide-de-camp (Captain [H. C.] Beckham) to you for aid, which was promptly furnished.

Samuel Coleman, private Company E, Seventeenth Virginia, in the hottest of the fight wrested from the hands of the color-sergeant of the Eleventh Pennsylvania Regiment his regimental colors and handed them to me. These colors I have already had the honor to forward to you.

At this juncture, having received a wound in the thigh, and finding that my horse was tottering under me from a wound through his body, I turned over the command to Colonel Terry, reported to you, and with your permission retired from the field.

Never was a brigade commander more gallantly and efficiently supported by field and company officers and brave men. To the gentlemen of my staff, Captains Bryant and Beckham, I return my thanks for gallant and efficient aid in the hour of need. To enumerate the acts of individual courage would too greatly lengthen out my report, and lest I might omit to mention many who were meritorious I now bring it to a close. Suffice it to say, that officers and men discharged their respective duties well and faithfully; and while we owe thanks to Almighty god for the success to our arms on this occasion, we have to lament the loss of many good men.

Herewith I hand the reports of the regimental commanders, from which I condense the list of casualties given below.

I remain, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

M. D. CORSE,

Colonel, Commanding Brigade.

Brigadier General J. L. KEMPTER, Commanding Division.
