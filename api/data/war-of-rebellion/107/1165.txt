Tenth Army Corps upon the turnpike and cover General Smith, and said it was to be done as quickly as possible. This was after you had given General Terry orders to advance and very soon after Colonel Shaffer had given your orders from General Butler to move the whole corps to the right to fill the gaps in General Smith's line and get in between General Smith and the enemy, which movement was in progress. You immediately, and in presence of Captain Kensel, asked me respecting the roads by which this movement could be made, and it was the first that I heard of any intention of any one to retire any part of the Tenth Corps. We were then pressing the enemy vigorously, and had no occasion to retire except to comply with the order.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

EDWARD W. SPRRELL,

Colonel of Engineers, New York Volunteers.
