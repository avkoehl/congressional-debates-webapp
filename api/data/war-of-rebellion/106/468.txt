His Excellency ADDISON C. GIBBS,

Governor of Oregon, Salem:

SIR: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of Your Excellency's communication of the 26th of May. For some time past I have been making arrangements for the establishment of a post at the Klamath Lakes. Everything is in readiness, and Lieutenant-Colonel Drew will move as soon as he can return to Jacksonville. It is indispensably necessary that we have two companies for the new post and the detachment to be left at Jacksonville. Under these circumstances I have directed that the recruits enlisted at Jacksonville be retained there to form a part of the new company. I regret that I did not before inform Your Excellency of my design to station another company in Southern Oregon. I believe the balance of the company can be raised in that section of the State if Your Excellency will be pleased to appoint the officers.

With great respect, I have the honor to be, Your Excellency's obedient servant,

G. WRIGHT,

Brigadier-General, U. S. Army, Commanding.
