If the guerrillas are overtaken no terms are to be made, as they have guilty of unheard of cruelties. Captain Eads has been directed to order all the available mounted men of the First and Seventh Cavalry to report to you at 4. 30 o'clock to-morrow morning for orders.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

C. G. LAURANT,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

JEFFERSON CITY, MO., May 22, 1865.

Captain C. G. LAURANT:

SIR: Five men, reporting themselves as rebel soldiers from Texas, surrendered, and are now under guard at this post. They report that their company numbered 139 when it reached the State about ten days since. Would it not be better to postpone the discharge until after the whole company shall have surrendered? I do not find here any records or papers appertaining to this class of business, and have no blank oaths. Can they be sent to me?

JOHN G. CLARK,

Colonel, &amp;c.

Colonel J. G. CLARK,

A band of from twenty-five to forty guerrillas is to-day south of Knobnoster. They will probably cross the road between Knobnoster and Sedalia to-night. Captain Hamilton has been directed to send a scout to-night in that direction if possible. Troops from this post are in pursuit.
