that it was a charter of incorporated tnd1%1dua.lt> to whom the

his op r ions briefly on the is^ue of paper m^nev In Lht (ieneial
Guveiiiment mu by die States He repudiated Ub is^u^ by the
former enmely, and -tateil ihat lfwe mo-t have p, ppr money,
he preferred that it should be issued by the ¡nates—by their
own banks—owned by them, gov rned by them, and all their
piofit-s divi led a.mongst the people of the States, individuals
having nothing to do with it
Mr B next proceeded to his third objection to the bill, that
the creation of this coiporation was the introduction of a new
power into our foim of government, gi eater than any known to
the Constitution—gteatpr than that of the Executive, Judicial,
01 LegiMdii? 1 power—the twofoimei never directly and per
sonally intei iered with one in ten thousand of our population—
that whilst the Legislature could only coin the gold and silver,
which individuals dug out of the earth, or acquired in the
course of lawful commerce, here was to be a power authorized
to create and then to cnculate a currency many time^gitatei
than all the gold and sliver on this continent This gave them
the powei to contiol and icgulate every thing, proper y, Irbor,
and covnmeice N'ne men weie to assemble m this Dis
trie once in everv week to send out their ordeis to the
blanches, East, West, North, and South These orders
could make m ney plenty or scarce, propeity high or lov>, and
labor cheap or high, juntas it pleased Thi& power, be «aid,
was too gi tat to be<ji%en to any nine men that ever lived
Especially when it was tobe exercised by men appointed by
gretcapitalists, Jiving eithei heie or elsewhere, who re*!'ed
fai from the peop'e, who weie n tto he responsible to them,
and who cou'd freí no sympathies for them in their tills ard
labors and dilticulues m getumr thmugh life Mi B Oemed
that Conere shad he pow^r tn iegi lite the rurtency, but wild
il they weiedeteimined to oxeicise it, he imp'oied them to
íegulate ir thams ives, bv their own ofhter-, it/-pon<*ible to
them as they were ie«poi sible t« the peopit Bal is tins
wool the, hr hadiather «.ee it, than for Congress to make an
assignment of its alleged duty to a mercería y and soulless ecu
poration which would have its bteh interest and laree divi
denda, although the peop e generally were starving foi the bread
Mi B became \ery animated on this and other kindred
topics, when his horn expired, and undei the rule he was com
pelled to desisL [We shall be able, m a few days, to give his
arguments at length ]
At'heclo eof Mi Brown's  argument, Mr Botts desned to
say that the gentleman had gto««!y misrepiesented his aigu
metit, he would not say he had dont so intentionally
Mr Brow^ leplied that he had not misrepresented an>

Mr WFTL^R rext took the fit or, and commenced by ex-
pressing ihe&uuigest indignation at the tyrannical conduct of
the majority in adopting rules to hurry 'hrough with hot and
indecent htste a measure of such vast importance, stifling de*
butt, and by a system of seciet voting enabling Representa-
tives to avoid responsibility to tne r constituents He lemem*
hered weir tnat the Whig parry complained bitteily when the
Independent Tieasury bill was passed, thatsuffkient time was
not a'lowed mr discussion, though the debate on that measure
occupied six week-, yet now this same party allowed but five
day** for the discussion of a measuie which isnotonlyto sup«
rilant the Independent Tieasury, but to control, to a considera-
ble txttn', the destinies of the country for the next twenty
yeaib Mi W then lebvered a power ul argument against
the constitutionality of the|measure aa well as its expediency.
He refuted the assumption that a decision was made in favor of
it by the last elections—and -howed that so far from its consti-
tutionality beirg a settled que&tionas claimed by its friend*, the
decision was the «ther way Though President Madfaon, un-
der extiaordmary circumstances recommended and signed a
Bank bill, yet his powerful speech m 1791 against the consti-
tutionality of a Bank remained unmswered to this day.
Though Geneial Washington signed a Bank charter, yet, as had
been well said by the gentleman from Alabama [Mr. Paths,}
he did it under a CunstTtution difieient fiom that now existing*
Mi Jefferson, GeneialJackson, and Mr Van Buren had mam-
Jested, it was well known, the strongest hostility to a National
Bank, and the present President had, duiing the whole course
of his life, shown, on every occasion, that he was equally op-
posed to it So th it by the record it would be seen that a ma-
jonty of the Presidents, as well as of decisions of Congress,
were against tht constitutionality of a Bank of the United
S ates

qui ted paitsof aiepott made by Mr Clay in 1811, as chair-
nun of the Committee of Ways nd Means of that House m

th it part of the speech of Pn ardent Tyler, made in 1819, againut
the late Bank m which he said that believing thi& institution
to be unconstitutional, heftltit to be his, imperative duty to -e

of the whi'e count ythatlchal tkclaied hia belief of the un
constuutionabty of a Bank, and yet he was elected This was
conclusive evidence that the people did not decide in favor cf a
Bink at the late elections Notwithstanding all this it was now
expected that fhe President would violate his oath to sup-
port the Constitution, merely to save the Whig parly—
for tign such a bill as this he could not, without a vio-
lation of this oath, or a change of his opinions. Indeed the
gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mr Sergeant] made anela-
boiate argument moie fu the Executive than for thi*
House or tht countiy, to convince bun that he ought to yield his
