Agreed to
Mr  PEARCE moved to insert an additional
item of $3,000 for the purchase of a site, and the
Í erection thereon of a marine hospital, at White
I river, in the Territory of Ar'c°i"sas
J     Mr   SEVIER advocated the amendment     It
I was (he said) at the mouth of the Arkansas river
where the hospital was pioposed to be built, the
I best site that could be selected     Last yeai, when
I the cholera raged at New Oilears, hundreds weie
landed on that terntoiy,iwd would have perished
in utter des itution, but for the  benevolence of
the citizens of Arkansas     It was one of the most
impoi tan t channels of tiade in the country, and foi
six hurdred miles each way there was no place of
I accommodation foi persons attacked with disease
1 on any part of the line     The pioposition would
' in no way benefit the citizens of the Territory he
| i presented, but the boatmen, sailors, and other
persons engaged in navigating the waters in that
sect on of country
Mi POPE would not der-v that marine hos-
I pitáis weie peihaps required at Pittsburg, New
| Orleans, and at the mouth of the White river But
he did deny that one was needed in the State of
Illinois, at or near the mouth of the Ohio river
There is now a hospital at Southland, sixty miles
above the mouth of the Ohio, and he could not see
the necessity of establishing another only fifty or
sixty miles off There lb also a mai me hospital at
Louisville, Kentucky, which, as well as the one at
Smithland, was built at the expense of Kentucky
He was as willing as any man to piovide for the
comfort of sick sailors, but he would try to do so
ma mode different from that suggested by the bill
It would be better to provide for the support of
those aheady established than to erect new ones
that are not required When the proper time
arrived, he intended to submit a motion to strike
out the appropriation for the erection of a hos-
1 pital at the mouth of the Ohio, and to insert, in
lieu thereof a clause appropriating $5,000 to aid
in the suppoitof theone at Louisville, and $2,500
to aid in support of that at Smithland
A long discussion ensued upon the general
merits of the bill, and the piopnety of electing
marine hospitals, in which Messrs MERCER,
HARDIN, POPE, DENNY, MASOxM of Vn-
gima, D J PEARCE, BURGES, LYTLE,
REYNOLDS, JOHNSON of Louisiana, FÍLL-
, MORE, REED, WISE, HAWES, SUTHER-
LAND, ard VINTON, took part
Mr BURGES moved to strike out the enacting
clause of the bnl, but subsequently withdrew it
i     Before the question was taken on the amend-
ment,
1 Mr VINTON said it was evident that the whole
day would be consumed on the oill undei discus-
sion, and he therefore, fri ti e purpose of expe-
diting other business, moved that the committee
me and repot the other bills to the House—
ayes 75, hoes 40
The committee thereunon  lose, and reported
the bills acted on to ti e House
|     The bill to cairy into  effect the convention
with Spam, and the bil1 to authorize the construc-
tion of a diy dock for the use cf the navy, re-
ported without amendment, were both ordeied to
be engrossed foi a third i admg
I     The amendments to the bill °rral ipg appropri-
ation  foi ceitam loads, to the liU ma'   ng appro-
pnatiom for bui u ng light houses, beacon-lights,
I and making survojs f>i the yei   1835, were then
concuned m by the House, nrd the bills oideied
, to be engrossed for n third leiding
The bill making additional appropriations for
the Delaware brea'nvatei, for certain harbors,and
removing obstructions in and at the mouths of cer-
tain rivers, for the year 1835, leported from the
Committee of the Whole, with sundry amend-
ments, was then taken up
On the question to concur with the Committee
of the Wholeon the amendment appropriating the
sum of $50 000 for.the improvement of the Ohio
nvei, letween Pittsbuig and Louisville, at the
Falls of the Ohio—
Mi HAWES asked for the yeas and nays,
which were oideied
Mi POLK objected to so large an additional
appropriation as $50,000 for the Ohio alone, which
wa3 already piovided foi under the bill to an
amount of $50,000
Mi LANE waimly advocated the appropria-
tion, and said it was tufling compared with the
immense extent of trade, and the great interest
m\olved
Mr VINTON remarked that the sum of $50,000,
appropiiated urdei the bill, was to be divided be-
tween the rivers Ohio, Missouri, and Mississippi,
and it was doubtful whether a cent of it would be
expended on the Ohio One agent could easily
disburse the whole of it When $50,000 was
appropriated foi the Red river, $40,000 for the
Arkansas, $20,000 for the Cape Fear, he deemed
it barely just to resist the proposed amendment
for the Ohio
Mr HUBBARD explained, that the other items
were recommended upon lepoits made by en-
gineers, and upon positive estimates, whereas,
such was not the case with the amendment. He
expressed a hope that the House would act upon
the question at once, without further discussion
Mi MERGER was in favor of the amendment
Mr DENNY ¡emarked that it should be borne
in mind that the amendment was íecommended by
one of the standing committees of the House, after
matuie deliberation, and it was entitled to full as
much consideiation as if it had come sanctioned
by the Committee of Ways and Means
Mi VANDERPOEL inquired if the Committee
on In erral Improvement had reported a bill em-
bracing th's appropriation
Mr VÍNTON explained The subject had been
refened to that committee under a resolution of
the House In consequence of the difficulty of
getting a special bill through, Mr V was instructed
by the committee to move this amendment to one
of the appropriation bills
Mr POLK said he understood that the whole
amount íecommended by the War Department,
was $i0 000, under a report by Captain Shrieve,
and the Committee on Roads and Canals, not
deeming the estimate large enough, asked for this
additional item
Mr VINTON explained The report of Cap-
tain Shueve was predicated on the river below the
Falls, and never contemplated any improvement
at all above that point
Mr POLK was still correct, that all the infor-
mation upon which any estimates could be made,
was before the Committee of Ways and Means
If the engineer had not reported, nor any docu-
