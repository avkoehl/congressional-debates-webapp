Another fallacy The Message argues n favor of the safety
of S io Treasuries, from the assumed smnllwess of sums on
hand In the same bieath, it continually aiguesa-mnst bapk
depositories from tht absumed largeness c f tne unit, on hand
rms is not pist leasonms- In compiling the two trethod ,
the same premises of fact should be assumed for each if sn all,
equally "aie and harmless m banks, if large, equally dangert us
and un afe in Sub Treasuries
the post orprcp
1 is assumed in the Message, and such is the repor of tht
Postmaster General that the new system harmonize fully with
t ic existing organization of the Ptnt Office, wmch pioreasesto
have conducted its business dining the summei wholly in
1 the 'ecral umency of the United States, ' as it is calle 1 If
the Prt-bldent affixes to the expression ie-a! cunei cy the
m anng I d ,so as to embrace m it papr-i r?fdnv— r_aper of
banks private individuals and public tgents—as well as gold
and silver, which aie the constitutional standard of %o,lue
but m ro sense the exclusive ' legal curi ncy of tho United
Stages"—then doubtless he is correctlv informed as to the sue
ce sftil conduct of 'he affairs of the Post Office Depaimeut
But if, by a "legal currency," he means g >ld and sdver, then I
take leave to question the fast It does not pod expand with
my own observation And the committee is awaie how di
tmctly and circiunstantially the fact Ins been denied by one of
the principal admmisti itirm journals r f the fe ate of Vngmia
A Id to which the consideration, that the pa} ments made to the
Post Office consist of small sums in each individual cise, which
fact distinguishes its dealings from those of any other branch
oi the Government
PATRONAGE
In considering whetlur the Execitive is to pain oi tolo e
patronage by the new ev^em the President di eucseñ the quet>
tiou mainly on the piemises furnished him by the late vicious
deposite b ink system He unfolds the political favor tism the
undorhan 1 influences the dee  and wide ramifications of cecret
power wmch characterized that alliance between th° I rea^my
and the selectel ¡state banks I accept his tebtimonvoii thii
point It is just what the opposition have always alleged ¡nd
which vtfd tohp asronsfantly denied by (he admini=;tiation and
its friends Doubtle s the President undeistands the true Acts
of the case I concede his premises, but I deny his conclusion
The late deposite ban\ s)<¡tem is not the alterna tie U it
were, the question might not be so easy to solve when were
the best course to pursue I wish as I hive s<u 1 before to
divotcb the Government from the State banks Tha muriage
w is pei nieions fo bo! h But I do not wish them to be enemies,
each of the other Grve to them proper business íeJa'ions
I ttit not be a connection  f power and pationi°e on one sid1
an! of wretched de endencc on the other Co yipaie such i
« ate of thi i°-s with the Sub Treismy scheme anljouhavc, i
icjdy answet to the   igumei ts of the Mes i"e
líuill i) this «!ut Pieat-jiy systf m, m 1 von ra s< over the
he id of all tho money alfuisnfthp count y a mighty mom v
monster banking—not ¡ike the united Ría es Bark on a era i
fat of thirty five millions only equal to about two millions
pei annum—but on the sum oftknft/ millions prr annum,
that is on the while levenue, and ill the pecuniaiy dealings of
the United P it«s ind on a car ¡tal incalculable tl at i all the
te^ourcesM the United ffta es Would not such a ma«" of
vnontv so held hy the agents of the Tiosurv be a srieateren
gine of indirect power? It would be the last mfama ion, either
of blind seivitity topauy or of self st<ilti*ymg one sd^dressoi
view, not to discern the vast accumu'ation of power which
this plan would throw into the hands of the Federal Govern
ment        M
The President does not advert to the ficihties of pecu uion
which this plan involves s.nd the utiactions it will off r to the
ni'aty of the thous n Is of adventurers and pretenders to
1 i cutivf favor v uh«hich all commnm íes abound
\oi d>es Iip do jo's ice to the abi ity o' the agents of the
litasnty to exert (heir influence ml to applv the public
funds to purposes of political corruption Tlie adn ir istiati n

m nded simplicity of heart m regard to the evil dmngs nt tre
woild wh ch is paiticnlaiiy lemarkable, cons dermg all it has
gone thiouch
Nor does he disclose the multitude of new agents of deposite,
transfer, and supervision which the scheme will requne His
aigument supposed that the requisite agents will be few ind
the cost of them small To siynohme of the cos liness of
pecuatitns I think I can see in the documents tmanalirg
fiom tha Tieasttry Department, the geims of not a few, and
those not uncostly new offices Such is tí e papei which so
carefully collates the old English statutes about rcceioers
general Mich also is the sly allusion in therepoit of the
Secretary of the Tiea^uiy, to anoldpipei ofMr Hamilton in
which- prior to the establishment of the United States Bank
and asa means f aiding the Ireasmv under the imperfect and
experimental state oí nnngs which existed in 1790—suchre
ce vei general or supervi«oiy igtnts of the lieasiuy aie
spoken of It is curi us to see this alministratt n which af
fects *.uth holy horror of the principles of Mr Hamilton, recur
to him on occisión, as amhoii'y for the in* ltuion of new
offii es
Something has been «aid as to fhe mode m which the affa ra
of the Ireasun are conducted ia Fiance    It isceitamly true
that the I\ench Government employs a greater number of
indiviiual agents in toe collection and custody of its revenue
thin we do    Such is  and long has been, the fixed policy of
the Fienrh &ov( innient—lo associate aiound i self a vast com
bmation ofpeison , dependent upon it as employes mitsrmh

ma gIv thev may be of large amount They not only cot sti-
tute in themselves the basis of a Iieasury bank, but a yon of
introduction to the u^e of Government paper as the paper me
dmm of the country Advot ates of the new scheme admit that
Government paper is to be the alteinativ e and the substitute
for bank paper The Sub Treasuries themselves, when they
are put in lull operation—dialing back and forth on each
other, ifruing and receivirg lai^esums olmonty andstillmore
ficquenilj issuing and receiving one kind or anothei of paper
cied!', ba ed on the Government depositee— will be a genuine
bank in every thing ^ui ihe name
"^                  THE ADMINISTRATION CONFUTES ITSELF
Befoie dismissirg this part of the Message, I can rot fothear
to contrast the views, row expíes cd by the administration and
its supporters, and those which the same pet of persons avowed
heretoí  e It wili be found thffy have absolutely changed
fiont, chopped shortabout as the wind, on all the questions m
voived in the general subject under discussion Indirect íefer-
ences to it occur in the officii! papéis ef General Jackson
which are also, very express and very lull on the points favor
able tobanl s as 1ieasu<-y agents When the repudiation of
banks as fiscal agents be_,an to be talked of m some parts of tho
country under i &ense ofalaim created by the deposite bank
system tlie objections to ihe scheme were most pointedly and
most ably sta e 1 in the \ nitcipal or^an of the administration
Tt us i' w is (inilv)sai'
It is as | \ pable as the sun, that ihe effect of the scheme
wr uid be to bung the public tieasure much nearer to the actual
'cu tody and comiol of the President,' than It is now, and ex
pose n tobe plunc eieá by a hundred hards where one can not
i ow reach it
Again
1 Had si h a suggestion conu fiom General Jackson, it would
have been rung through the Old Dominion with the leiteiated
falsehoods about the proclamation and the piotest, as conclu
sive pioof of all the aspirations which have been charged to
the Heio of Orleans' 'See (they wouidsay ) heie he wishes
to put the public money due  tly ¡nto the palms of his ii lends
and partisan*, instead oi keeping it on deposite m banks,
whence it can n< t be drawn, for other than public purposes,
without certain detection In sucha case, fte should feel that
the people had ju&t cause for alarm and ought to give then
most watchful attei tun to such an effort to enlarge Lxccuuve
power and put in it*- hands the means of corruption "
I have spoken already of the action of the House upon this
vei y question, when brought intu discussion by Mi Goidon,
as aK ) of the report oi th Secret iry oi the Treasury Hut
repoi i, I repeat demonstrates the superior fi(i!ecs ^f h°nk cor
porauons as the fiscal agents of Government to individuals,
saving, as the result of the whole matter, that the latter ' will
piobabiy b found less responsible, &afe, convenient, and ecuno
mtcal ' One or two senbmes only, asa further specraen
of the spurt of that document
These circumstances with the p eference m case of rulnre,
lelonsrmg to depositors and In Ideis oi thui hi is over he °tock
bolle s unielwith the set m ity, ifn t pruruv, given to the
Government render them m point of safety, generally much
sri| eiior to individual agents of the United States *
:tIt is gratifying toreflec, that the ci edit given by the Go
verninent, whether to bank pappr or bank agent'- has been nc
compamedby smaller losses, in the experience undei the sy>
teni of state banks in this country at their worst period, and
under then severest calamities, than any other kind of credit
tie Government has ever given m relation to its pecuniary
transactions "
Indcel uV wh de of that paper deserves to be carefully
reíd and compared with the conclusions, eo singularly dale
rent, of the Treasury repoit laid on our tables the present
session
And I refer to it as I do to other official acts and to the de
bites and paragraphs oí the time, not so much to show the
inconsistency oí the admmistiation—althou,h tins le e'ainir
en ugh—but lathertt f itify my own posi ion, by Culling m
ud (f it aiguuerfs co elaborately deduced, and so forcibly
expressed, as those which I have cited
FINDS RtXErVARLE  BY   COVEiTN'MENT
I can not think th it as ippeirs to be implied by the argu
men's and language nf the Message, the framers of the Consti
tution, m íefusmg to insert m it express power to create
coiporations had any parucular eye to bank paper It was
not bank paper which made up the depreciated currency of
the time, but Government paper Theie were but three or
four banks in all the United States ard their paper was not, in
quality or mount an evil But the Government paper was
an evil The people well knew by bitter c xperience, what to
think of Continental moriej bills of ciedit, Treasury notes, or
whatever else you please to call it—for the substance is one,
under ah these names Bank paper was rapidly grown g mm
ere 'it but of its convertibility into specie, and its nmsf qnent
supei lority to the paper of Govei nment
Now I lo not contend for the receivabihty of hank paper
hy the Government unless it be convertible into specie on de
mand If so convertible, it is equally for 'he convenience of
the Government and the ceuntiy that it should be thus recen a
ble at the Treasury I deny (he wisdom of attempting, or tr e
powei of maintaining one currency for the eountiy, and another
for the Government, in thu country Go'd for the offipe ho d
ers, and lank lag*, as they are cal'ed, for every body else
"io i can not doit
The President says that such a d srnmination is a measure
of íes ricti m not of favor, that is; of restriction to ihe public
age it, as he further explains This argument, certainly, is a
very singular one Restriction, and no favor to ihe pi b ic
agent th it he shall receive no hing but gold1 Tiy it now, and
see wietber it is a restrict on or a favor to be compelled to
recen e gold in payment of a debt It is a very unwelcome
favor to the debtor to be compelled to pay it But here is the
same fallacy, which runs through the Message and wl ich
auses from lool mg at all the circumstances of the times only
m the relations m which they affect the interests of the
Government
P GOVEÍTSMEIv-  PAPFR
