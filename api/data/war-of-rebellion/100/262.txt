I. N. PALMER,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS CITY OF CHARLESTON,Charleston, S. C., April 20, 1865.

Messrs. WILLIAM AIKEN and JAMES S. GIBBES:

GENTLEMEN: I have received your letter requesting the use of Hibernian Hall in behalf of the citizens of Charleston, to express their sentiments upon the awful event that has deprived the American people of their Chief Magistrate. I need not tell you how welcome such citizens are at such a time to that or any other spot within my command, where we can pour forth our common sorrow for a loss that leaves us all so stunned and helpless. The calumnies of a past antaginism have identified the citizen of Charleston with undying hatred of the Union of our fathers. When such a community ask for a place to mourn the loss of Abraham Lincoln, does deprived us of a warm heart and the wise brain that was so rapidly molding us back to unity and fellowship?

I have the honor to be, gentlemen, very respectfully, yours,

WM. GURNEY,

Colonel 127th New York Volunteers, Commanding Post.
