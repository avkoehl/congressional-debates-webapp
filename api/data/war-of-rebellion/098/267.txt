The whole division now crossed and formed a line of battle on a plateau about a mile from the creek. I again went into position on the left. Some rebel cavalry skirmishers threatening my front, I moved on them with four companies of the Twenty-fifth Iowa, and we soon drove them back to their main line. The list of casualties has been already furnished you. My next engagement with the enemy was at the city of Columbia, captured by my command on the 17th day of February, an official account of which, with the casualties and the number of prisoners, was made to you under date of the 19th day of February. *

I did not meet the enemy again in any force till the 20th instant on our march that day from our camp near Cox's Bridge on the Neuse River toward Bentonville. The Second Brigade, Colonel Catterson, had the advance that day and skirmished freely with the enemy, driving him easily until we had arrived within three miles of Bentonville. The enemy here became stubborn, and, threatening an attack on the Second Brigade, I was ordered up and went into position on Colonel Catterson's left. We now advanced our line of battle of two brigades about half a mile and put up works. About 3 p.m. I was directed by Brevet Major-General Woods, commanding division, and also by Major-General Logan, commanding the corps, to take three regiments, and if possible clear the road in our front and open communication with the Fourteenth Corps, now fighting apparently about a mile from us on our left front. I place the Twenty-fifth Iowa, Lieutenant-Colonel Palmer commanding (which regiment I had ordered out about an hour before a skirmishers), to take the advance, and directed the Thirtieth Iowa, Lieutenant-Colonel Roberts commanding, and the Thirty-first Iowa, Lieutenant-Colonel Jenkins commanding, to follow as a reserve. The Twenty-fifth Iowa was deployed as skirmishers with their colors in the road I was going to clear, and my first movement with their colors in the road I was going to clear, and my first movement with the regiment was to change direction toe the right. This movement was made steadily until three-fourths of the regiment had crossed the road, when our proximity to the rebels on my left and in the road caused very severe skirmishing. Two regiments of the Second Division now came up my left rear (I think the Sixth Missouri and the Thirtieth Ohio), one of them, the Sixth Missouri, deployed as skirmishers. I made arrangements with the officer commanding the last-mentioned regiments to join the two regiments with mine, and at a given signal the Twenty-fifth Iowa and the Sixth Missouri should make a charge. The charge proved entirely successful, enemy's skirmishers, composed of Hoke's division, clearing the road and thus opened communication with the Fourteenth Corps. The officers and men of the Twenty-fifth Iowa behaved handsomely and fought desperately. Lieutenant-Colonel Palmer, commanding the regiment, and Captain Allen, acting major, who lost his right leg in the engagement, deserve notice for exposing themselves freely and for the gallant manner in which they cheered their men forward.

At night I retired to a new line and my placed was occupied by other troops. I have already sent you a list of the casualties and the number of prisoners captured.

On the 21st instant I had orders to erect a line of works on the skirmish line, and at 1 p.m. I moved three regiments to the front line, the Fourth Iowa on the right, connecting with the left of the First Brigade, Brevet Brigadier-General Woods commanding, the Thirtieth Iowa in
