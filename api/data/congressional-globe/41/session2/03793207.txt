Ferry. !
The VICE PRESIDENT., The motion to ;
reconsider will be entered. j
department of justice. j
Mr. WILSON. Let ns go on with the Cal-
endar. I
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senate re-
sumes the consideration of the Calendar. The
Secretary will report the first bill on the Cal-
endar at the point where it stopped yesterday, i
The first bill on the Calendar was the bill
(H. R. No. 1328) to establish the department
of justice. i
Mr. HAMILTON, of Maryland. I think j
that bill ought to go over.
Mr. PATTERSON. I would ask the gen- '
tleman why? i
Mr. HAMILTON, of Maryland. The name \
strikes me very sensitively. , j
Mr. PATTERSON. The gentleman ought
not to object on that ground. I will say that i
the bill has been considered very thoroughly,
and during two 0on$rpsse.s. Let it be read, i
Mr. TRUMBULL. I wish to gay in regard
to this measure thatT think it a very important,
bill and a very proper bill to be acted upon.
In regard to the particular details of this bill I
am not prepared to express an opinion; but
this is a subject that certainly deserves atten-
tion. The bill came from the Committee on
Retrenchment. It has not been examined by
the Committee on the Judiciary; but I have
looked over it somewhat, and I trust the Sen-
ate will take action upon it.
Mr. PATTERSON. I will say to the Sen-
ator from Illinois that this subject was first
referred to the Committee on Retrenchment in
the Thirty-Ninth Congress, immediately after
the Committee on Retrenchment was organ-
ized. The committee secured information lrora
various Departments of the Government touch-
ing the subject. In the Fortieth Congress a
bill was introduced by Mr. Jenckes in the
House and referred to the Committee on Re-
trenchment. A similar bill was introduced by
Judge Lawrence in the House, and referred to
the Judiciary Committee of the House. The
two committees met and framed a bill which
was in substance the bill now before the Sen-
ate. It was reported from the Committee
on Retrenchment in the House at this session
and passed the House without amendment. It
was reported from the Committee on Retrench-
ment here, and is now upon the Calendar, and
I hopeweshall proceed with its consideration.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator
from Maryland has withdrawn his objection
to allow the bill to bo reported, as the Chair
understands.
Mr. HAMILTON, of Maryland. Yes, sir;
let it be Tead.
The Secretary proceeded to read the bill.
Mr. DRAKE. I consider this bill of too
great importance to be passed under the pres-
ent order of business, and I object to its fur-
ther consideration.
Mr. SUMNER. I submit to my friend that
he had better allow it to be read through.
Mr. DRAKE. Why?
Mr. SUMNER. So that it willbe in a con-
dition to be acted on.
Mr. CONKLING. I think that is the very
reason why it should not be read. If it is not
to be acted on now, the reading ought to be
dispensed with.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill will
be passed over, objection being made.
RECONSTRUCTION EXPENSES.
Mr. MORRILL, of Maine, I ask consent
to make a report. Thd Committee on Appro-
priations, to whom was referred the joint reso-
lution (H, R. No. 2G9) to amend the act of
April 20, 1870, have instructed me to report
it back without amendment, and I ask unani-
mous consent to have it considered now.. " .
There being no objection, the Senate, as in
Committee of the Whole, proceeded to con-
sider the joint resolution. It declares that the
first proviso in the act approved .April 20,
1870, (which prescribes the conditions under
which the disbursement of the appropriations
therein contained, for defraying expenses in-
curred in carrying into effect the- act to .pro-
vide for the more efficient government of the
rebel States, shall be made,) shall not be held
to apply to accounts for services rendered or
for supplies furnished under regulations Â®r
orders issued by the respective- comiaandeirs
of the several military districts under the au-
thority of the seventh section of the act of
March 23,1867, and which accounts shall have
been duly certified and audited, and have beeu
approved and the payment ordered by those
commanders.
Mr. MORRILL, of Maine. I will state for
the judgment of the Senate the point of this
resolution from the Honse. In the recent
deficiency bill there is this provision :
"To defray expenses incurred in carrying into
effect the act to provide for the more efficient gov-
ernment Qf the rebel States, forvarions supplies and
service, namely, in the first military district, #7o,000:
