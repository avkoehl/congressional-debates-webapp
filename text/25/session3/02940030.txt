APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

Graduation Bill—Mr. Benton.
Ses
deposit banks could not stand 'a distribution of
$36,000,000, commencing six months later than
the proposed land bill distribution, and made in
quarterly installments of only $,9,000,000 at a time
How then could they have stood a distribution of
§55,000,000, commencing six months earlier, and
the first installment amounting to $17,250,000'
The thmg was impossible, it could not be done,
and that was so evident to me that I pioclaimed
it, and reiterated my opinion on this floor in Ian
guagetoo strong, in the judgment of some of my
friends, to be allowed to go to the country, and
what was that opinion bottomed upon ' Upon
the fact known to us all, and by me repeated a
thousand times, that what was called a surplus of
$40,000,000 in the Treasury was a mere delusion,
that the money, in point of fact, was not in the
deposit banks, that it had been lent out, that Con
grees had sanctioned and instigated the lending,
by requiring interest from the banks for its use,
that, instead of being in the banks, it was in the
hands of merchants, tradeis, dealers, manufactur
era, mechanics, speculators, and others, that the
banks had «sed it with the knowledge of Congress,
and with theimphed contract and fairundeisland
ing of having the «se of it till gradually called for
on account of the public service and that, to call
for all this money in masses, and almost without
notice (foi the fiist payment would have begun
as soon as the bill could have been passed) was to
COMPEL THE 1ARGE PE.P0SIT BANKS rO CHOOSE BE- j

strotiwg their DEBTuRs All this was so plain
to me that it was amazing, incomprehensible, and
almost incredible that any perbon could avoid
seeing the same Yet this is the measure, the loss
of which we are called upon to deplore This is
the measure, the patriotic resistance of which,
by General Jackson, is denounced as an act of
tyranny This is the measure, then believed to
be irresistibly popular, now known to be heartily
condemned by every considerate man I his is
the measure before which General Jackson, and
all its opponents, were expected to be prostrated,
and before which they were willing to have been
prostrated if such had been the penalty of ad
herenee to their principles, this is the measuie
which, like the consulai distubutions of grain ard
money, and public lands, among tne votus m the
degeneiate days of the Roman Republic, was ex
pectfd to purchase the sulTinges ot all the peop'e
General Jackson and his fnends, myself one of
them, did what they believed was light, in resist
ing this measuie, without legaid to consequence 
personal to themselves They resisted the co'os
sal distribution of ^55,000,000 of money "Ihey
threw themselves upon the i itelligence, ti e pa
tnotism, and the candor of their fellow country
men, and the event has proved that they were not
mistaken in their estimate of that candor, that in
telhgence, and that patriotism It has pioved
that the American people ore not yet ready to be
seduced and debauched with the spoils and pil
lageofthen own country
Su, (said Mr B ,) I pursue this bill of May,
1836, one step furthei, I pursue it into the fourth
section, and see that nothing but a war with &foi-
eign Powei could have arrested the distiibution of
the {,55,000,000, and given the Ireasury a right
to retain the $24,877,179 leceived from the public
lands in 1836, and the $6,776,236 received from
them m 1837 By the terms of the act, the dis-
tribution was to go on without legald to anything
but a foreign war, and the j-31 000 000 received
from the lands in 1836 and 1837 were to belong
to the States, and to be pjid to them without the
least regard to the condition of the public Treas-
ury It was a specific appropriation of the pro
eeeds of the lands, and as such would has e been
aid over to the States on the days named in the
act Tne "shutting up" of the Treasury would
have made no difference, the stoppage of the
banks would have made no difference there was
no foreign war—the appropnat on was specific
and absolute—and the dehveiy of the morey to
'he States would have oeen compulsoiy and in
evitable What then' Why, that notwithstand-
ing the retroaUne disbursements from the Tieas
uiy of the beiure received revenues from the lands
of 1833, Ivll, and 183o—notwitnstandmg the at
tempt to disbuise these old expended  revenues
might have bankrupted the deposit banks—yet
the current receipts from the lands for 1836 and
1837 would have been turned over to the States
as they came m The $25,000,000 (nearly) of
1836 would havegone to the States, the #7,000,000
(neatly) of 1837 would have gone to them also,
and thus, with the banks all stopped—with the
Treasury shut up—with Congress called together
to provide the ways and means of keeping the
Government in motion—with the duties from cus-
toms sinking down to nothing—merchants' duty-
bonds postponed—balances from banks delayed
for many months, with all these we should have
been paying out to the States the $7,000 000 of
hard money received from the lands in 1837, and
which $7,000,000 in specie was the sheet-anchor
of the Government in that disastrous year, and
the only thing which saved it from the degrada-
tion and rum of using depreciated paper money
and shmplasteis
Mr President, we hear much of the incapacity,
the ignorance, the incompetency, and the reck-
lessness of the Jackson administration, we hear
much of all this from the Opposition, without their
being able to specify a measure to which these
epithets will apply, but here is an act of the Op
position itself, which places the leaders in a posi-
tion to choose between a confession of absolute
incapacity to manage the public affairs, or of a
deliberate design to bankrupt the Treasury and
the banks
No, Mr Piesident, the Jackson administration
was not ignorant, was not reckless , was not in
competent, and to hurl suc-h epithets at that Admin-
istration is to hurl them at the people, by whom
that Administration wag created and has been
sustained To attack that Administration, ap
proved as it was in the triumphant second election
of General Jackson,and in the tnumphant election
of bis successor, is to attack the capacity of the
people for self government' It is to attack the
elective principle of our Constitution, and to say
that that principle ought to be abolished, and a
hereditary ruler given as a guardian to those who
' were so incompetent to choose their own Chief
Magistrate
|      ISo, sir1    Great aie the services which General
Jackson has rendeied to his country—great in the
field—still greater  in  the Cabinet     His civil ad
i ministration was a continued  senes of pa notic
| exertions, the emanation no less ot a neroic soul
I than of a sagacious head and a patriot heart
None but a heio could have acted the part, in I
civil affairs, which he did     Above all men who
have lived moui eventful tnnes)a single individual,
perhaps, alone accepted, he will  be stamped the
heio statesman  of the  age     I  have  heretofore
endeavored  to  do  some justice   to   his  various, I
transcendent, and victorious policy     1 have en
deavored to present some views of his numerous,
brilliant, and successful ameliorations at  home,
and negotiat ons abiond      I   hive endeavored to
present him as posteuty will view him, coveied, j
illustrated, i radiated with eve-j species of glorv,
and aoove all, with the gloiy ot usefulness—with
theglory of ha\m imnroved tliecondi'ion, bettered
the   circumstances,  advanced   the  for une,  and
peisonally benefited eveiy ii dustuous inhabi uit j
which the country contains    I have endeavored to I
do this, and Í appeal to the pie*ent unparalleled,
unrivaled, unprecedented, unexampled, universal, I
pervading, and exulting prospeuty of the country
ior the truth and fideli y of the p ctures which I
have endeavored to draw
It is not my intention to repeat, on the present
occisión, what I have here ofoie delivered on this |
subjec', but there is one point which, though
heretotore mentioned, has never been piesentelj
with the ful'ness, individuality, and development
which its imoorunce and magnitude deserves 1
ailude to oui cotton pioduction, and its influence
upon the wealth and industry of eveiy portion of I
this extended Union, and the part which General
Jackson has acted ¡n bringing that pioduction to
what it now is, aid to what it must be Whit
was the extert of our cotton growing territory
before the victorious a>ms of Geneial Jackson
aosjuned fo' us the vast region of the South and
Southwest? It was a part of South Carolina, a
part of Georgia, some slips in JSorth Caiolma,
Tennessee, Mississippi, and Louisiana     What
is it now' It is all Florida, all Georgia, all Ala-
bama, all Mississippi, all Louisiana, all Arkansas,
South Carolina, a part of North Carolina, a third
of Tennessee, and a slip in Missouri In terri-
torial extent our cotton growing region has been
increased more than ten fold by the victorious
arms of General Jackson over the southern In-
dians, and by his still more victorious policy over
the political allies of those Indians—their Federal
allies—who«e struggle it was to retain them in the
southern States to diminish their political írroort-
ance,ard to cripple their advance What was
the value of our cotton export before these great
operations of General Jackson began > It was
$14,000 000 What is it now > It is $80,000,000
And what is its capacity of augmentation' Al-
most limitless and boundless, or only limited by
the wants of Europe, Asia, Africa, and the two
Americas, for to all these countries, even to the
Ganges and the Black Sea, to the Cape of Good
j Hope, and to Teira del Fuego do our American
' cottons now go And what is the influence of
I this vast pioduction, so umazingly augmented
under the victorious arms, and still more victo-
rious policy, of oke MiN, what is its influence
, upon the indust y, the pursuits, and the wealth
of every part of this evtended Confederacy ? To
answer this que&tioi, let the mind's eye figure to
itself a map of this Un on, and then contempla'e
every species of mdustiy which is carried on upon
the vast diversified domain which it represents
Let him look at our shipping interest fiom the
Chesapeake to Passamaquoddy bay, all finding
its greatest and nenes' employment in carrying
our cotton abroad, and bringing back the produc-
tions of so many nations received in exchange for
it Let him see our most opulent merchants
throughout the whole extent of our coast, from
New Orleans to NewYoik, all bottoming their
largest operations upon the cotton of the South
Look to the manufacturing industry of the whole
. northeast, of which Massachusetts may be taken
I as an example, and as the highest pattern, man-
ufactures of lea'her, cotton, wool, iron, brass, tin,
wood, glass, s one, &c , the grand aggregate of
whicn,m ail the northeast, may be judged of from
the annual pioduct of neai ninety million dollars
for Massachusetts alone, and a goodly proportion
of the whole of which finds itsmaiket in the same
cotton giowmg region Crossing the Alieghany
moun ams, and descending upon the western
witers, see twelve millions of manufactured arti-
cles, the product of the industry of three or four
miles square at the confluence of the Alleghany
and Monongahela, see these twelve millions an-
nually going off from Pittsburg, and the largest part
going to the cotton planters of the South, while
many other tow ns and villages of the West, on a
smaller scale, emulate the meritorious example of
" the Bumingham of the West " Then, see the
<igii"ultuial States of the great valley See Ken-
tucky, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Missouri, with
then vast productions of gram, and their mnu-
meiable herus and flocks, all finding their richest
market in the same region Turning to the middle
S ates, where the value of tabor, for a long time,
has been so much reduced, we see thai, value m
Virginia, Maryland, North Carolina, and Tennes-
see has found a vast augmentation from the culti-
vation of cotton So that, in every part of this
extended Confederacy, and ovei every species of
creative ii dustry, the augmented cult vation of cot-
ton, the fruit of General Jackson's military achieve-
ments and civil policy, has extended its benefits,
and shed its benign influences The North, the
List, the West, and the Middle States, the cities
and the country agnculture, manufac'mes, and
commerce, all, all find employment for their mdus-
tiy, and rich rewards for their skill and labor m
that perennial fountain of national wealth—the
cotton growing region of the South—which, while
it showers gold t,pon all others, is itself largely
deprived of its own advantages by illusive systems
of political economy, a system which leads it to
purchase everything by the paper money itandard
of the United St ites, while it sells the only article
it produces by the hard money standard of Eu
rope ' Every part of this Union feels the benefi-
cent effects of tne cotton crops and no part feels
it more than the agricultural region of Kentucky,
and the marmfaetuiing districts of Massachusetts
