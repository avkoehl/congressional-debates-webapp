The enemy has advanced to within 150 yards of Battery 4, and his heavy batteries enfilade that portion of our lines, some of the shot passing through the traverses. He has 10 and 13 inch mortars also playing on my left and left center. His heavy Parrott guns are on his right flank within range of gun-boats.
