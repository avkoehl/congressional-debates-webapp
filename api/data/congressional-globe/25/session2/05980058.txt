I could not oflei you, sir, any aigumnt so good
as thai which is -,0 feeling!} and eloquently enibic-
ed in the extract which I hive just reíd It is well
known to the Senate that I hue constantly ente-
tañed the opinio 1 th t the he.st way to check the
spmt ol .ibohtion was to reeuve lespectfally and
re'er these petition-, to tjie proper committee That
would be the Committee for the District of Colum-
bia, one now, and which probablj b?s been, ever
since the commencement of the Government, so
constituted as to compuse a major tj. ol membeis
fiom the sla\eholdmg Stales If they weie thus
rcfeired, s lentlv leferred, as has bttn th- pian <
during a gieat pait of the period ol the e\istenci ol
the Government, then would be no "gitit,on io-
mented here, no giound for asserting that the sacred
light of petition had betn v íolated
The People may attempt to exeicise that light m
three diffeient descnptions ot case^ 1st In instan-
ces where Congress manifestly does not possess (he
constitutional prwer to graat the relief pr 13 td foi
In these, the petition ma\ be rejected instantly,
without rcieience and without debate, and no just
cause of complaint would exist 21 In cises
wheie the constitutional power, the exercise of
which is invoked is controvcited, doubtful or un-
ceitain In thpse, a leference of the puition miy
be necessary to examine into the existence of the
power, as well as into the expediency of o\eic <nn *
it Ol this controveited natuie is the legislative
power of Congiess m this District No c ne would

by Congiess to grant the redn ss prav ed for In the
two last descnpt ions ol cases, I think th it (. 0tigress
is bound attentively to receive the petitions, and
respectfully to dispose of them. A Government
which, like ours, is ti e Government of the people,
should be parcntallj administered, so as not only to
do light, but, as far as possib'e, to give general sa-
tisfaction
It has been argued that, when a petihon is once
pot in the possess on of tnc ^rnate, the n„ht of pe-
titioning has b^en prnctit alive 11 it' ej and th it the
Senate may tejed i nist ui'l), 1 fei it It it up
on the table, or ehsp is  of it is miy be thought
proper Undoubtedly this is hue, but ,n 'he gre a
business of human lift,, pubic and miva'e, the
manner in which it is transacted is often as impor-
tant, sometimes more important, than what is done
or refused And a wise Government should be
particularly careful no1 to wound or inflame popu-
lar sensibi'ity on subjects respecting which laige
niasses choose to exercise the constitutional right
of petition The course wl ico the Senate has pur-
sued, in regard to these abolition petuions, foi about
two years past, is this a Senator states from ¡ns
place that he is charged with the presentation of
of one of them, and moves tnat it be leceucd
Another Senator thereupon uses, and motes that
the motion to receive the petition be laid upon the
table, and the Senate accordingly'order tne motion
to leceive the petition to be laid upon the table,
and thus the petition is not received in apaiha-
mentary sense The Senate 'does not decide the
question of its reception
This conse I have  alwavs thought unfortunate
It is unsat «factory      The petit.oners feel that they
have been neglected, and they allege that th  right
of petition has been denied      But it has been con-
tended that these petitioners are mad and reckless
fanatics, and it hasbeen indignantly asked whether
they merit respectful treatment Mr President, my
observ at on and experience in life have taught me,
tint when we are addiessed or assailed, our con-
duct should not be icgulated by the harsh, vitu-
peiative, or fanatical language, or the condition,
« hatevei it ma> be, of those w ho approach us, but
by the standard of our own respedabihtj', standing,
and character m life And in regard to these pe-
titions, the question «hould not be so much what
do the petitionee dcsei vc, as what is due from the
cslin, elevated, dignified, august character of the
Senate of the United Sines' Th se petitioners,
misguided as they are, and highly mischievous as I
believe the tendency of their proceedings to be,aie
a part of the people of the Unittd States and our
con tituents Shall w t allow ourselves to be lash,
to be moved by angei, or transported by rage, be-
cause fanatics, as they aic called, 01 thoughtless
men and women, piesent petitions to accomplish
an object vi hich, if seriously entertained, would
justly excite profound alarm1!
The mode of disposing of ihese petitions which
the Senate has lately puisuid has certainly not pro-
duce,! the tianquili/ing eflect so anxiously desirad
It has, on 1! <• conti ny, agffi u alcd, and I fear will
(ontinue to aggiavaie, the disuse The Aboli-
tionists have not diminishel, but incieased, and w-
cicasel, as the most sitisfactoiy infoimation as-
sures us, because they have been able to persuade
many that the right of petition is invaded and has
been denied And many who are not Abolition-
ists now unite with them to assert and maintain
the right of petition It is to be seriously appie-
hended that co-operation for one purpose may ulti-
mately lead to co-operation for other purposes, not
w ithm the 01 igmal contemplation of the parties If
the Senate, by persisting in its recent course, en-
able the Abohtiomsis to derive succor from new
alius, and if we should also unhappily place m
thei hands an additional instrument, by unneces-
smlv c uiphng the annexation of Texas with the
subject of abolition in the same series of resolu-
tion , then indeed there will be too much reason to
apprehend that the "North, at no distant day, will
be united as one man
It "ppnrs to me, sir, lint what becomes us is to
kei p the A! ohtionists separate and distinct from
all other classes, standing out in bold and promt-
nen< ichei, and the subject of Abolition separate
and distinct fiom the light of petition, from Texas,
and irom all other subjects, let them stand alone,
unmixed with the lest of the community, without
the general sympathy, and exposed to the over-
whelming force of the united opinion of all who
desire the peace, the harmony, and the union of
this Confeduac) I woukl leceive, respectfully
íeceive, their petitions, rcfci than, and occasional-
ly present calm, dispassionate, and argumentative
reports against them This is the manner in which
petitions for abolition were n reived in the first
Coiiiit^, upon the re<< mm<mdation of Mr Madi-
son a  I th t 1 v which inn weie ever atternards
rtceivr d, until the practice w?s changed about two
jears ago What is theie m tht mere fact of the
reception el a petition to create alarm' Or in its
subsequent teleience, especially to a committee
known lobe hostile to its object''
But it is --aid that these fanatics are beyond the
ie->ch of any argument, and it is triumphantly
asked, Will you condescend to aigue with such de-
luded persons'5 Yes' I sxv, ves To preserve
these admirable institutions of ours and this glo-
rious Union, from the possibility of all danger, I
would argue with any one, with lunatics them-
selves, in, their lucid intervals, and argue again and
fain It is not, however, to lecall alone the Abo-
litionists to a seise of peace and duty, that these
appea's to the reason, the judgment, and the patri-
otism of the country, should be sent forth from
these halls They would address themselves, with
powerfjl effect, to all that, vastly the largest, por-
tion of the Northern community who are unin-
fected I y Abolitionism. When has Congress un-
successfully appealed to the intelligence, the pa-
triotism, and the valor of the American people?
In such a cause we «hould nevei tire nor despair
Mr President, I have no apprehension, not the
smallest, for the safety oC the Union, from any
state of things which now exists I will not a*-,
swer for consequences which may ensue from harsh.
and opprobrious language, and from indiscretion
and rashness on the part of individuals or of Ckav
gress, here or elsewhere. We allow ourselves, te
speak too frequently, and with too much levity, of
a separation of this Union. It is a terrible word,
to which our ears should not he familiarized I
desire to see in continued safety and prosperity this
Union, and no other Union. I go for this Union
as it is, one and indivisible, withoutdimmiition. I
will neither voluntarily leave U, nor be driven out
of it by force. Here, in my place, I shall contend
for all the ngh's of the State which has sent me
here. I shall contend for them with undoubting
confidence, and m all the security which the Union,
confers, under all the high sanctions which the
guaranties of the Constitution afford, and with the
perfect conviction that they are safer m the Union
than they would be out of the Union. I am op-
posed to all separate confederacies and to all sec-
tional conventions. No state of actual danger
exists to lender them expedient, or to justify deli-
beration about them This Union, this Govern-
ment, has done nothing, nothing whatever, to ex-
cite the smallest alarm. It will do nothing, but if
it should, if, contrary to all human probability, the
rights and the security of the slaveholding States
shall be assailed by any authoritative act emanating
from this Capitol, a state of things for resistance,
forcible resistance, will then occur. It will he
time enough then to act. No man in full health
will take medicine because he may be S'ck, ampur
tate a perfectly sound limb bscause it may be frac-
tured or seized with gangrene, or perpetrate suicide
because death is his ultimate and inevitable doom.
And, sir, when that fatal day shall come, if it ever
do come, when the slaveholding States have to de-
fend, by fores, then rights, the State whose servant
I am will rush to battle, as she always has doae,
with her accustomed ardor, and wuh gallantry un-
surpassed by that of any other State. And those
States and their citizens will be found to sustain
these rights with most vigor and success, who, un-
moved by false alarms or ímaginaiy or aggravated
dangers, with a firm and fixed purporse of soul,
stand prepared, in every real exigency, to vindi-
cate them at every extremity.
Having, Mr. President, said so much on the ge-
neral subject, with the permission of the Senate, I
will read certain resolutions which I have prepared,
embracing the whole ground occupied by any of
the petitions in respect to domestic slavery in the
United States    They are the following
Resolved, That the institution of domestic slave-
ry, as now existing in many of the States of this
Confederacy, is subject to the exclusive power and
control of those States respectively, and that no
other State, nor the people of any other State, nor
Congress, possess, or can rightfully exercise, any
power or authority whatevei to interfere m any
manner therewith
Resolved, That if any citi7ens of the United
States, regardless of the «pint of peace, harmony,
and union, which should ever animate the various
members of the Confederacy, and their respective
citizens, shall present to the Senate any petitions
touching the abol tion of slavery in any of the
States 111 which it exists, all such petitions shall be
instantly rejected, without debate, and without
further or other pioceedmgs thereon, as relating to
an object palpably beyond the scope of the consti-
tutional power cf Congress
Resolved, That when the District of Columbia
was ced°d by the States of Virginia and Maryland
to the United States, domestic slavery existed m
bo'h of those States, including the ceded territory;
and that, as it still continues in both of them, it
could not be abolished, within the District, without
a violation of that good faith which was implied itt
the cession, and m the acceptance of the territory,
nor, unless compensation were made to the pro-
prietors of slaves, without a manifest infringement
of an amendment to the Constitution of the United
States, nor without exciting a degree of just atarca,
and apprehension m the States recognising slavery,
far transcending, in. mischievous tenctettey,,aHy
