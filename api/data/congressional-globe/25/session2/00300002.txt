CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
the private claims, growing out of our land system
alone, there were numerous, cases reported favora-
bly two )ears ago, but unacted on for the simple
reason tnat there was not time. Now it seemed to
him that they had been making this  e\cuse to the
people oí the country long enough, and they ought
to come theie with a fixed determination to dispose
of -whatever public and pnvate business came be-
foie them without kiss of time, and at least not
dissipate one whole w eek of the session For the
purpose of determining whether they wreie to dis-
pose of the business of the country or not, he
hoped the House would indulge him with th" yeas
and na> s on tin question of postponement
Tlv veas and ai)« having been ordered,
Mi Cl'SHMAN varied his motion to postpone
till "We Inesday instead of Thursdav
Jlr C   said he joined   in  the wish expiessed
by tie gentleman iiom Ohio, that they would com-
mence this session with  a determination of going
on with the public business as speedily as possible,
but his motion did not contemplate delay     He had
made it merely  foi the purpose of giving  the
Speakei an opportunity to appoint the committees
in a judicious manner, by revising, wlnrc necessa-
íy, the appointments made last session     Hereto-
fore it had ne\er, he believed, been the practice to
appoint the committees, or ordei their appointment,
on the first day, but to postpone it till Thursday
Mr C howevei.was willing to make it a day earlier
Tt>e duty was a iery important one, requinng
great judgment and knowledge of the members    It
is w ell known that the business of the House de-
pended yery  much  upon the organization oí the
< ommittecs, and it was theicfore all-important that
they should be well oiganired for the who'e busi-
ness     As, then, it was so huhlj expedient that the
Speaker should be acquainted  with  the members,
1 e hoped the House would concur w ith lum in the
recessity of granting sufficient time foi that oficer
to perform the duty
Agun they were all pietty well satisfied of the
fact that they should not receive the President's
Message till to-morrow, and the requirement of the
gentleman's order on tint day would assuredly
interfere with the reception of that document
Mr WHITTLESEY interposed He said the
g ntleman appeared to be labeling undti an eiro-
neous impression as to the object ofhis (Mr WN)
motion He had mentioned, at the time h" submitted
the ordei, that he should not move its consultation

forded wi e an 1 timely aid to private enterprise,
and the achv lty alwajs characteristic of our people
has air ad), in a great degree, rcsumtd its umal
aud profitable channels.
The condition of our foieign relations has not
materially changed since the last annual message
of my piedecessor We remain at peace with all
nations, and no efforts on my part, consistent with
the prtscryafion of our ngl ts and the honor of the
country, shall be spired to maintain a position so
consonant to oui institutions We have faithfully
sustained Ihe foreign policy wilh which the United
States under tKe guidance of then first Piesident,
took their si md in the Innily of nations—that tn
regul iting their intercourse with other powers bj
the app oted principles ot private life, asking and
accoidmg equal righ" < nd equal pin lieges, render-
ing and domandu g justice in all cases, advancing
then own, and di cu«smg the prclen ions ol others,
w ith candor, directness, and sincerity , appealing at
all times to íeason, but never vielding to force, noi
seeking to acquire pnj, thing for the nselveo by its
exercise
A ngi 1 adherence to this policy has left this Go-
y ernment with scarcely a claim upon its justice, foi
injuries arising fioji acts committed by its authority
The most imposing and perplexing of those of the
United States upon foreign Governments, for ag-
giessions upon our citizens, were disposed of by
my predecessor Independently of the benefits
conferred upon oar citizens by restoring to the mer-
cantile community so many mil1 tons of which
they had been wrongfully da ested, a great service
t as also rendered to his country by the satisfactory
adjustment of to many ancient and irritating sub-
jects of contention, and it íeflects no ordinary
cieelit on his successful administration of public
affairs, that this great object was accomplished,
y-itnout compromising, on any occasion, either the
honor, oi the peace of the nation.                    0

Of pending ques ions, the most important is that
which c\ish with the   Government  of  Great Bri-
tain, in respect to oui   noitneas'trn  boundary.    It
is with unfeicncd regiet, that the people, of the Uni-
ted States must look back upon the abortive efforts
made by the Executive, ior a period of mote than
half a centuiv,  to   d'cimui", what   no   nation
should suffer  lo lg to  ícm1 n   in dispute, the true
line which d vides its   pcssessions from   those of
other po\vers    The nature or the settlements on
the boiders of the United States, and of the neigh-
boring temtoiy, wis lor a season such, that this
