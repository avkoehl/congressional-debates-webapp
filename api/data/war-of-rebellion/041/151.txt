yards of the works, when Captain Lindsey, of the Twelfth Arkansas, threw brands of fire on him, and destroyed his cotton. Early in the night last night, the enemy approached, and attempted a sort of feeble charge, throwing a few hand-grenades into my trenches, but did no harm. I repulsed him and drove him off, killing a considerable number of his men. I am sure he was quite demoralized-so much so that his sharpshooters fell entirely back out of range. Later in the night his sharpshooters returned, and killed and wounded several of my men (new men of my regiment, Twenty-third Arkansas, who were not acquainted with the place). He is now rolling before him a hogshead filled with sticks. I must arrest his progress before 3 p. m., or he will throw his band-grenades into my trenches again. Ii am certain I can stop him. I now have Major [E. L.] Black, with 125 men of Twenty-third Arkansas, on the extreme right. Colonel [W. N.] Paris, with the Eighteenth Arkansas, came just before daylight this morning. I think I could have held the place even without this re-enforcement, and feel sanguine that I can with it. I will hold it.

I am, major, very respectfully, &amp;c.,

O. P. LYLES,

Colonel, Commanding Right Wing.

MAJOR: It is the Twenty-third Arkansas that I want. The Eighteenth Arkansas has gone to General Beall. The little fight, think, has pretty well blown over, though he is still making demonstrations. He got in my trenches and got 1 officers. I whipped him (the enemy) out again, killing some. Watch on General Beall's line; I think they intend something there.

PORT HUDSON,

June 30, 1863.

MAJOR: I said to you that the enemy charged me on the extreme right. So he did, and a few of his men got into my trenches. I killed 6 in my trenches, and as to the number outside killed and wounded, I do not know, but his loss must be considerable. It was rather a small business, as usual (I mean his charge). He took 1 captain and 3 of my men out of my trenches, and killed 1, making my loss 5 in the aggregate. I repulsed him very handsomely, and all is now quiet. I can repulse him every time, and will do it. During the skirmish, I discovered he was marching large force toward General Beall's line, and hence the suggestion to watch in that direction. The Twenty-third Arkansas has not got here yet, but it will, no doubt, soon be here. I sent the Eighteenth Arkansas off long before night.

I am, major, very respectfully, &c.,
