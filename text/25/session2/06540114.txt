merged, and Spain discharged  from them by the
treaty.
Is, then, the claim to be rested upon the fact that
the commissioners under the treaty did not admit
the awaid of the Spanish commission m favor of
Mr Meade as competent proof of his claims
That could not be assumed by the friends of this
bill, becinse it was conteded that the bill did not,
in its original form, require the commissioneis ap
pointed under it, to take that award as evidence of
the claims, and because it had been amended, upon
its passage, by the consent of its friends, with the
avowed purpose of avoiding the possibility of such
a construction This was a suíücient answer to
this ground of claim, though it had been well said,
m a report, a most pnngent report, against the
claim, drawn by a member of the Senate, when it
first made its appearance here, and who is now a
member of the body, that the United States ar« not
íesponsible for an erroneous decision of those
commissioner: , even if it were determined that the
decision was erroneous, which does not seem to
be contended
This ground of claim being yielded, he would
again ask, where is the claim to rest? If its friends
were unwilling to place it upon any one of the
grounds staled, and he believed they covered the
v hole ca<e, would they attempt to sustain it upon
all, without location' He thought not He could
not believe that such a defence of a bad claim
would be attempted
Th°re was another position, however, which had
been assumed by a commitlep of the other branch
of Congress, and wh ch was independent of all the
points he had made It vías that, by the treaty,
Spam was bound to furnish the proofs, so far as
they were m its power, to sustain the claims under
it, when those proofs should be demanded m the
form and manner prescribed, that tins demand in
the case of Mr Meads, was made, but the proofs
were not furnished, that, hence, has arisen a liabi-
lity against Spain, which can only be enforced by
our Government, and that, theiefote, we should
pay to our citizens their claims, and look to Spam
for our indemnity He referred to the first repert
upon this claim, made to the House of Represen-
tatives by the Committee on Foreign Relations of
that body
Without canvassing the reasoning of that report,
he would «¡imply remark, (hat he had examined the
conespondenee of our minister in Spain, at the
time, to determine how far the conclusion wis sup-
ported by ihe important fact upon which it reste I,
the neglect of the Spanish Government to furnish
the proofs, and most unfortunately for this ground
of claim, it turned out, from the declarations of
our own minister, made to our own Government,
that the Spanish authorities, from the moment the
proofs were demanded, used all diligence, and
manifested every disposition, to comply with the
demands, but that, from the unsettled state of that
coun'ry, the consequent confused and dispersed
state of the public archives, and the late day at
which the demand was made, it was impossible to
furm h them within the time limited in the treaty
Heie, then, would seem to be an end of all pre-
tence of claim against Spain upon this ground
He would spend a moment in examining the
extent of the bill, as he viewed it, and would close
his remarks, already too much protracted He
was aware tint it purported merely to provide for
the claim of Mr Meade, but was that its just and
fair limit1 What said the committee of the House
of Representative, winch reported the first bill in
favor of this claim, and to whose report he hid
just referred for another purpose He would read
from the report itself
' A-5 it is nown to the committee that there tie severa] other
cliimanl" m the same situation as the petitioner thpy pr rstnt
a I II e nbi uctng all cases of a similar kind I ¡ley deem It,
r-owever proper (o state to the House that -is the five million
fund provided by the treaty, ha* been distributed amonL the
c nants w jfct claims were allowed by the Gommissio eis,
ti o a no nt now pinposed to be paid will be m addition to that
sum
Here is the important fact All the money which
our Government was to pay under the treaty has
been paid, and distributed among those who proved
their claims before the commission, and m con-
formity with the treaty, and still there are "several
other claimants in the isame situation as this peti-
tioner," men who did not pi ve their claims, and,
theiefore, did not share in the distribution of the
"fiv e million fund " How many of those claim
ants are there, and what ,s the amount of ihur
claims' He knew of but one mode of answering
this inquiry He found, from an examination of
the papers, that something more than foity millions
of dollars of claims were presented to the Commis-
sioners, tint but about five and a half millions of
tlu  whole amount were proved, and that, therefore,
a balance of about thuty five millions remained to
be proved, in case the subject was again opened,
and a new opportunity given to substantiate these
claims
This consideiation it was which had induced him
to take this labor in opposition to the bill The
claim of the petitioner was, m itself, large, varying
but a little from halt a million, but when even that
amount w as compaied with the importance of the
bill as a piecedent for all these other claims, this
individual case sunk to a trifle
He knew he should be told lhat the bill merely
proposed to institute a commission to examine the
claim ot Mr Meade, and did not assume to decide
that it had merit, but gentlemen would lemember
that it appiopnated the mone} fiom the Tieasuiy
of the people to pay the claim, in case the commis-
sioneis nimed should decide in lis favor He knew
and esteemed the men named as commissioners
Theie wire not thiee othei individuals within his
know ledge he would «¡oner select tor any trust,
and had Ihe proposition been me ely to refer flit
matter to them to report the Í tcts and their opi-
nions to Congress, his voice would not have been
heaid against the bill, but when it was proposed to
delegate to any Ihree men legislative power to he
extent to which he thought the example of this bill
might go, he must scrutinise closely the merits of
the claims, and oppose so dangerous a delegation ot
power
If it should be sought to distinguish this pirticu-
lar claim, in this mode of treatment, he must then
go a step farther, and ask what it was, as disclose I
by the papers? Mr Meade had stated that the
amount embractd in the award of the Spanish
commission, as due to lumsell, was something more
than §373,01)0 I or what was this due to him'!
This was a question mo^t natural to ask, bat wine i
it w as m his powei very imperlectly to answi r
He had waded through the pipers with an earnest
desire to determine this point, but he could find but
two items of this large chim any where specified
The first ws, the sum of #75,000 for his two
years' imprisonment, at the suit of McDermot, and
how was it that an imprisonment, at the suit of a
private individual, for a private claim, and upon
process issued by a judicial tribunal of the country
within which the cause oí litigation arose, and within
which it was confined, was mide a national matter1
If the imprisonment was wrongful, an action for
false imprisonment might have been sustained
against the plaintiff in the private action, but not
against the Spanish Government, which was not a
ptrty to the suit If the courts of Spam made an
erroneous deci icn, who evu hc?rd that the Go-
vernment was íesponsible in damages ior the con-
sequent es? He could not, howe vci, omit here to
remark, tint s,7> 000 for two years'imprisonment
in a civil suit, there the prison was only locked at
night, and th it for a (cm months, was rather ample
damiges for the peisoinl injury, upon whomsoever
the duiess might h «e been exercised, and whoever
might be íesponsible foi the el images occasioned
Here, then, re ted so much of Uns claim, and
what were the other items' lie had found one
other, specified in the statement of the claims,
prepared by Mr Meade himself, and transmitted
by him to his wife, to be laid before the Secretary
of Slate of the United States, in immediate con-
templation of the treaty That item was $100,000,
as his damages upon a bill of $300,000, drawn m
his favor by the Government of Spam, to be paid
n one of the Spanish West India Islanels He
does not state that the bill was refused and pro-
tested, but that it was not paid ¡n specie as he ex-
pected , that $50,000 of the amount only was paid
at all, and that the payment to that amount, was
made in the article of tobacco He says he sent a
vessel to the island lor the purpose of receiving the
avails of the draft, and that the disappointment
to him, fiom not receiviag its full payment, was
moie than $ 100,000, although me whole draft
was $ {Q0,000 onlv, and of that sum he did receive
§50 000 in the pioducts which, it is to be presumed,
w ere intended to load his vessel
Beyond these tvvo items, his examinations did
not enable him to answer what were the claims
He would not pietend that he had read all the pa-
pers m relation to the subject, but his own action
must be governed by the views he had thus formed,
until other facts, and other views, should change
the strong impressions thus created
INDEPENDENT TREASURY BILL
SPEECH OF MR. NILES,
Of Conni cticut,
In Senate, February 13,1838—Upon the bill to "ím-
posfi additional duties, as depositaries, upon cer-
tain public officers, to appoint Receivers General
of public money, and to regulate the safe-keep-
ing, transfer, and  disbur^em nt, of the public
moneys of the United States "
Mr NILES aiose, a .J a Idressed the Senate as
f> lion -
Mr I'resiotm Bung entitled to the floor, and
presuming tha' no other Senator is prepared to
occupy it to day, I will commence my lemarfcs,
although considerably indisposed, and proceed as
long as my strength will admit The subject
bi ought under consideiation by the bill and amend-
ment, i> not only one of deep in erest to Ihe whole
country, but of a very comprehensive nature, so
Inat to discuss at length its several branches, would
gieatly exceed any reasonable limits that can
bi'oii^ lo i speech I shall, iherefore, confine my
ohsenations principally to such parts of the gene
i il sulij tt ts s em t i have received least attertion
fio n othpis, "ii 1 hall ci deavor not to occupy an
unieasoi alie poilion of the time of the Senate, vet,
oonsKtcrin" the comprehensiveness of the subjects
drawn into the debate and the time occupied by
otnero, I am admonished to be cautious m giving
any assi íance oí bievity, foi fear I may be found
in the pudicamcnt of a certain lawjer, who was
m the habit of making long speeches, and, on a
ceitam occasion, was requested by the couit to
condense his remarks He replied lhat he would
be as short as a subject so redundant in abuse
would admit of, and then commenced his argument
by saj ing that "before the foundation of the world
there wa> a chaos," and proceeded to trace events
down to his case I will at ledAl promise not to
w ander beyond chaos, but, a  our currency is m
somewhat of a chaotic state, I may have to go
ncr "where the coast of darkness lies bordering
on light "
Sir, I regaid this bill as a financial measure, and
a 'inancial measure only, although it may have
some incidental bearing on the currency and mone-
tae interests of the country, much less, however, I
believe, than is expected by its friends or feared by
its opponents I am a vare, however, that there is
a de^p i itertsl felt m it bj the country, from its sup-
posed beiung on the banking institutions and com-
mercial interests, and am a'so sensible lhat efforts are
being made to u^e it for getting up another panic, to
which purpose, I fear, we must attribute the deter-
mination of some of the banks to delay the resump-
tion of sp-cie pay menu I am sensible that there
is a settled and violent hostility to this measure on
toe pau of a poition of oui citizens How exten-
sive that portion may be, I have no means of
tonnin0 an opinion I shall not go into an exami-
n aion o the elections which have occurred during
toe el >se < f il e last vear, as s me geitl=men have
lore l will only «a> that, fiom the time at which
tho^e elections took place, there i  no one of them,
except it be tnat m the State of New York, that
could have been influenced by this question, and of
that I have no wish to speak, lest I should be
deemed to poach upon the manor of the honorable
Senator from New York, (Mr Tallmadge ) I
will only say that gentlemen of that State, equally
well informed, differ very much as to the cause of
the result of that electron, and that there is no sub
