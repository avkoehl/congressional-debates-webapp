without attracting the attention of the enemy. The pickets will be left as long as practicable consistently with their being withdrawn to this side, the pontoon bridges taken up, and other bridges destroyed by daylight.

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,May 26, 1864.

Major-General HANCOCK:

The major-general commanding directs that corps commanders report from time to time their progress in the operations and movements ordered for to-night and following. They will report when their corps have recrossed the river and when they are well on the routes of march. The commander of the Sixth Corps will report when the rear of his corps passed Chesterfield Station, and the commander of the Fifth Corps when his rear passed Old Chesterfield.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS BURNSIDE:

HEADQUARTERS SECOND CORPS,

May 26, 1864-10 p.m.

General HUMPHREYS:

GENERAL: Our movement has been somewhat delayed by issuing rations, and by a little fight that Gibbon had this evening in driving away the enemy's skirmishers, and by delay in constructing a foot bridge, which it was at last found impossible to effect on account of the rapidity of the stream, reducing our number of bridges from four to three. But everything is going on well at this moment. General Potter's division will be relieved before the orders and sent home.

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General, Commanding.
