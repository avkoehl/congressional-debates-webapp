[Inclosure Numbers 10.] BEEVES.

The sources from which beeves in large numbers were to be gotten were Texas and Florida, and complete arrangements were made for securing a supply from both States, and large numbers have been obtained from both, together with a large quantity of pickled beef from Texas. Arrangements were made in 1862-'63 to bring castle from those States and put them on the grass lands of Virginia and Tennessee, but the long drive, want of good grass on the way, caused the attempt that was made wsith a few droves to fail. Some thousands of beeves have been obtained with the past few months by swimming the Mississippi, and when the river is again in a suitable state and the season admits of it the proceeding should be continued. From Florida many have been obtained, and the plans and means to continue the supply are complete; 20,000 more are expected. The marvelous accounts of the undress of thousands of beeves in Florida are believed to be idle, as this bureau has received accurate information of the number. The operations of the enemy may, however, defeat our expectations, but it is proper that the War Department should have this source in view.

Respectfully,

L. B. NORTHROP,
