27th Cong.......1st Sess.                              Public Lands—Mr. Meriwether.                              ___________H. of Repa
and say he was not doing his duty or that he neglected some of
the moat important partslof his doty, as a puhlic minister But
this is aomewhat of a digression, and yet intimately connected
with this McLeod question of peace and war, ior what must
the Privy Council a id her Majesty ftueen Victoi la herself, who,
I dare *av, all worn in as she is, has more fiie in her heart than
ever to b tve bitten down and written a letter 1 ke that—what
must tint Privy Council have thought when they first heard of
it? 1 hey would say, God giant that this man may remain heie
as Jonathan's minister till the end of time, we may be sure he
never will know any thing of our real intentions, and will al
ways have a becoming reverence for the terrors of the beak and
lightning of the eye of the British eagle and blundering rash
nessenough to put out theeyesof his own
To return to the subject oí this resolution, and as to whether
the Brm&h Government have been given to unders and that
■Mel °od will be released or surrendered What, I ask again, is
the pm pose of this luquny? For this question, too, has been
answeied betoie it was a&ked Undoubtedly the British Go
vernment have been given to understand that he will be releas
ed or Hmended Whether this shall be done by the authority
of the United States or by that of the State of New Yoik may
be a question of constitutional power among ourselves, but it is
no question between us and Great Britain In negotiation, the
Goveinme t of the United States is that which the t ritish na
«on have (he right to hold and will hold responsible for his per
sonal sife'y Undoubtedly the British minister has been told
that "the Government of the United Statesemertamsnodoubt
tint, ifier this avowal of the transaction, aR a public tiansac
tion, auth >nzed and undertaken by the British authorities, in
dividual concerned in it ought not, by the principles of public
law and the general usage of civilized States, to be holden per
sonally responsible in the ordinary tribunals of law for their
participation m it '
Undoubtedly the inductions, givpn to the Attorney General,
when sent to New York, and a copy o*" which wis commumcat
ed to Mi Fox, di 1 aver that, "whether the process be criminal
or civil, the fact ol having acted undei public authority, and in
obedience to the order  oí lawful superiois, must be regarded as
a valid defenct, otherwise, individu lis would be holden respon
Bible (or injuries lesulnng from the acts of Government, and
even horn the operations oí public war "
Yes, bii, the British Government have been given to under
ft and that since their avowal that McLeod acted under then
anthouty, he mutt be ultimately íeleased or smiendered
And what hthí Is it not bo1* Whv, su, Indian savages—can

of a man was lostin a nocturnal foray, authorized by the pub

lenee it was undtutaken and achieved? Sn, ihere is not a
civi i?e 1 countiy up n eaith but woul 1 ct y shame upon us for
carry rig such baiuarian principles into piactico Awarpio
yoked by such an act would be a war of extermination—a wu
of m^reiles^butcheiy, and the scone ol its fiistenumteiabie suf
iermgs would oe the veiy bolder of our own country, upon
which, we should bringdown tine judgment of Heaven.
I ask eveiy member of this House to put himself in the posi-
tion of bi mg a prisoner m a foreign land foi an act do ic by the
orders of his Government—for the burning ofa boat, ot the
killing of men—I ask every man heie to put himself m the situ
auon itt McLeod, eithei in G eat Buiam or any part of the British
dominions, and suppose it a matter of negotiau m between the
two Govei nments—what would they say if the British Seciet uy
0 1 State fiomtreprcs ntation that this w ia done by the orders
of tho Government of the Unite I States, and that the nation held
itself resporsibl" lor the act—the Butish Secretaiy ofStiie
would aay, ' of course ultimately we shall lelease ¡urn "   ]Sow
1  would ask if this would be disgraceful to the British nation?
It would have been duecüy the conn *ry—ihaf there i* no de
ecending from the dignity, and rights, an i indct endence of a
nation, m admitting the principle ft it the authonty of a nation
coversas with a mantle the dee b of individuals perfoimelun
dci if, and that, ifairestel upon civil or rnmiuil procesa font,
thete must be some mode oí obta mng their release I say that
the mimstei of no nation upon earth would be ashamed of niak
mgsueh a declaration as that And now orrythig coneapond
ence to the utinostextent What is it more? How does it com
prumittluscounttyi Itdoes not take McLeod out of the htate
of New Y or* It never pretended to arieat the opera  n of the
liw The British Minister has been given to understand that it
lb aq lestion be ween the two nations, and that the General Go
venimeuc,is vou and I, hive a deep interest in the stake as
well a« New Yoik, and that ii it should c<iine to h istihties, it is
n it foi the Lmpite State of New York to carry on the wai
withGiear Britain ho, it is a question for which the honor
oí trie w ¡ole nttnr is pledged and therefore the Government
of ino United States had a light to speak upon it Now, I
ask, why is this quest on riised, as it ii> msed in this re«olu
tion, between the Government of the United States and iheGu
vernment t f the ^ta e of hew York? It is the easiest thing in
the wor d to do what tho Constitution of the United States an 1
the Constuu ions of the several States intended to do above all
other things that is that each of them shall discharge its own
duties, passing along m pa^adel lines, without crossing each
othei's put And the course taken by the Uniteu fetdt s is
cilcut fed for that After commenting, as Í have done upon
the efl ffa proluced in foteign Ian is by a repoit of this House
si famous an 1 notorious as if wa  last winter, I ask you what
his been the counteracting eiXcl of this very coirespondence {
The effect his b en 11 calm the irritation of tbf British Govern
m** of, tou&e 1 a^ it ha 1 been to indignation and re entment by that
inflammatory repoit Ihiseif ct is apparent m the tone of Mr
Pot-l'a speech to his const! uentsat Tarrwoith I have no doubt
that Mr fox repte^en'ed the thing in that light and fiom the
comp'exion ofthe&e communications le repies^nted that there
was no si nit of hostihtj to Great Britain on thepait of this
Govt,! ¡ment I say it is one of the best pipéis that ever wad

SPEECH OF MR, MERIWETHER,
OP  GEORGIA.
In the House of Representan cest June 30, 3841—On the bill
appropriating the pioceeds of the public lands, and providing
for pre empuons
The bill appropriating the proceeds of the public lands and
providing ior pre-emption rights being under consideration—
Mr MEIUWkTHER, having obtained ihe floor, addtessed
the committee, in substance, as iollows Mi Chairman, it cer
tamly was no part of my t urpose ougi rally to have trespassed
on the attention or patients uf the committee upon this oi any
other question, during the present session of Congress And I
have been induced atone to change that pulpóse by íeason of
¡"any of the remarks which have lallen fiom the gentleman
fiom Maine [Mr Clifford] who has just taken his seat Cn
cumstances, in all probability, will induce me to vote with that
gentleman m the ultimate disposition of this question, and I am
not willing that his principles should go foith to the wuild as
any par ot those which I entertain, and which have induced me
to coincide with him m my vote I wish to exclude any such
conclusion in the public mind, and which might be arrived at
were I to rpmam silent attti what he has said
I cannot endorse that gentleman's opinion , on the contiary,
so fai as he has given expiession to them, as immediately con
nected wuh the subject undei discusión, I lepudiate them en
tirely I therefoieask of the committee a brn (indulgence that
I may ptace m\ sell properly before thecoun'ry in lefeien e to
the met its of the question bei >re us feo i u men, as relates to
the ( nnciplfo on which the measmc beioie us reets, I assume
as tiu" that thf* United ^'ates Government docs not now pos
sess, nor did it ever po^es^, any title to the public lai us othei
than tint deuved by audtluough the deeds of eetbion, made ty
the several ¡states, of their unappropnated teintoiy that in
each cesaion the United ¡states has acquired no fee siun/e estate
whatever in itself, but, by the tcims of the deed, holds as trustee
ftrihe seveiul ¡states, that th" lands cie-ate a common fund,
lnuutg to the bench oi all the States, to be apprormitd to
then u e and benefit, <tnd to no other use or pmpose whatevet,
according to a propoition which the bill assumes, that the Go
vernment has no light to ippiopriateto any purpnscsconnccted
with, oi giowing out of its operations, any poition ol that fund,
that thatpoition of the pubhc lands purchased irom France and
tepain is an estate, the puichase money oí which was dem ed
fiom the sale of the liust estate and that inequity it becomes
subject to ail the uses and benefit*- of the o«igindl trust and that
the whole constitutes a fund to be dmtiibutci equally among
the -states Ihese die the | nnci/des which =eeni to me to oe
involved m the measuie beioie us lliey are the pruciplefa
whieh have ilwav been íegaided as tiue by all parties, at
leist in my own ¡state, and ue now denied, peihaps, m view
oily of th  ttufi ot the proposition that, to cieatedifieientes
is to men, thett mu t lirst be ditteiences oí opinion as to mea
sures
1 have thus given you succinctly the pnnciplesl enfeitam
upon this question lhis much was due to myself, leelmg
constiained to vote d^ unsi the passage of the bill, because us
details inflict grost, injustice upon the oil isiates of this Union,
who have bou eall the burdens and encounteied all the dangeis
of achieving oui independence and in the election of out Go
vernment, and who have cec ed to the Stat s the very temtoiy
you are now pioposingto divide to their prejudice
The gentleman fiom Mame announced to us, m advance,
that his purpose was not iu mike a '¡stump speech,' that his
so e object in addressing the eommittee was to present a fan
view of this measuie to his constituents So often have the
privileges of this House been pervetted to the dehveiy of such
haranguts, that I felt giaiified at hearing this one disclaimer,
and, Mr Chairman, while I will not he s > unparliamentary
as to charge the gentleman with doing what he so earnestly
disclaimed witiiout charge, yet I will s<\y that, if disngenu
ousne«b m aigument falsp piemises and erroneous conclti
sion^ mterspei&ed with ad coptartdum phrases calculated to
play upon the pas-ior* rather than enliffhten the judgments of
the iudiury, constitute any portion of the elements of this hy
bn 1 species of oratory had the genileman's speech i pen ad
dre&sp 1 to an mdisuiminate audience upon a muster ground, m
a political canvdbs, and iiom a ^lumpa&the uirum, hi-- marncr
an I his, mattet would haveemmen ly entitled h* remarks to the
Classification he seems *o much to repudia e
There was much which fell from the gentleman that Iugret
ted to hear, bo h is to tl e sentimentseonveyed a^ well as to the
place in which they weie uttered He burdened his remarks
with much of the invidious distinctions which he drew between
thediffeient classes in society, of taxmsthe pioi for the benefit
ofthencn m pointing to the oppie^sions which ietl upon the
earnings of the laboiei, an 1 the exemptions wnirh blessed the
oveiflowingtieasutiesofthench And he didnot forget to re
mind usthat he ind hi3 political a^srciatcs were th* fnends of
these dearoppres ed pool while, by consequence those who did
not belong to his political clique weie the enemies of the poor
and the friend  o the    weali ij monopo^st "                             '
Mr Chairman I ha\e no taste oi ambition for that sort of
popularuv which bi^es i self up>n the array oí one class in
s ciety against aiothei I aspire to no elory which derives us
e\ tenceftomthe mined hopes and bastel prospects which
ei \j and i^ilousy may claim as the fruits of their woik, Í wish
not a fame which cm c aim no higher birthright than the off
spung of the 1 iwestand wc r^t passions ( f the heart nor sn do
1 sep] to win Imrels tomybrowby theprofesMf n of f elmcs I
do not indulge I am not the exclusive friend of the pooroi the
rich    I desire not to exempt either from the burdens, nor to
confer exclusively upon eitherthe immunities of Government—.
theie is no necessary warfare between them in society, nor is
thete anyeffbit making to render one sul servient to the other,
and the jealousy which is attempted to be aroused between
them owes its ongm to any cause othei than a just apprehen
sion of the existence of such an effbit Both classes are mu
tually dependent upon each other both must necessarily exist
in all societies and each should share the toils, and participate
in the exemptions, of the political community with which they
are associated
Sir, this arraying of one class m society against the other,
this kindling of rancorous passions among men, becau&e birth,
or fortune, or industry, may have thrown either competency or
wealth m the lap of one and not in the other, strikes at the very
existence of society, its well being, and its morals It serves but
to spread the agiaiian notion that no man holds his r/ropeity by
any other title than the Will of the majority, and (hat they have
a right to assume its possesion, and to distribute it ltincul
cates the reckless idea that there should be no protection to the
earnings of industry—no security against the plundenngs ol the
common mass
The mischiefs which s jch sentiments are calculated to pro
duce are without estimate Their influence is secret and un
known, and can nevei be appreciated, until it bursts forth up
on society like a mighty avalanche, overwhelming indiscri-
minately all that fall within the reach ol its wi e spread
íuin Itlodges upen the mind, unrestricted as to class orcondi
tion in society, and there remains to irritate through years, as
reverses or advances in fortune may succeed, developing its
dangers only when despeiation shall have fitted us victim
for thed^ed And such invidious distinctior s, and the prin-
ciples which they inculcate, coming fiom the American Con-
gress, carry with them an influence as to truth, ard anendur-
dnceasto time, which find no limits but those whichbound
life itself
:Sii, the spn it of mobocracy is now sufficiently n fe through
the land, w uhout seeking an mipetus here Brute force has al ¡
ready too frequently been made the aibiter of right and wrong,
rather than the legally constituted tribunal  ol the Govern-
ment Povetty looks already with an eye sufficiently jaundiced
upon the luxuries of wealth, or the comfoita of cimpetency,
and the continued admonition, that it is but subsei vient to both
in bearing then buidens and adding to then immurmieb, serves
but to irritate in desperation, to alienate its patriotism, and, m
tho j hrenzy of that desperation, to drag down the bulwarks
which consti'utional law may have elected to avenge a wrong,
ei her real oi imaginary
As to the effect of such sentiments uron political numbers,
it ib bulas ' dust inthebalai ce" when compared wuathede
tenoiatmg moral prejudices which they cieate 1 hat they
aieap tent eBgme in iornung the cast oi political pames, can
not be denied Ihe histoiy of the country foi the lpst twelve
years, tells most fatally what effects can be produced in political
organization, by persuading one class in society that another is
its enemy But the delusion weais away as expeuenrede
picts its fallacy Facts can contradict false professions and the
mind yielding to their influence, looks calmly fn the prcba-
bihties of such self devotion to the ciu^e of those for whom it
is professed But the motal efflct of such pieju hces leaves its
footprint incapable of change oi obliterarte n They break the
confidence of thee who feel a mutual dependence on each
other, paralyze the strongest aflections which rive tleligaments
of society toatthei, enei vate the eneigies of socwi action, and,
appealing to the woist pn«=ions of (he heart, engendei maligni
ty, and jea'ouey, and discontent there, to rankle and irritate, and
fin all j to c nsume the highei and nobler principles of O'ii
natuie then, liki. a slumbering volcano meipible of control
hnglongei the uolencc which agitates it, when least suspened
dirgoige their fata) lava, consuming and destnying the whole
s tucture ofa virtuousandwell organized society And these,
sir, are the effects socie'y nustbedi, that a present stimn us
may be given to tbeardoi of p lmcalemhu«M*m
The gentleman from Mai ie was not pat fled to indulge in
buth a biram of invidious remai *., but, in the fulhetboi that
df ep partisan feeling which chai acterize  too much the discus
sions heie and elsewhere, thought pioper to turn fiom the
subject befoie him, to ihnw; at the piesent Administration ior
its management of the finances of die Government lie tells
us that last year he heard nothing hut the ciy oí' retrenchment
andrefoim"—now nothing salutes his eai but the 'mggaidly
stinginess ' of the past Administration' I fear, ]\Xi Chairman,
that the gen Jeman's associations aie ur favoiable to his hearing
any other cry than that of which he compi ms Last year I
heaid the same cry winch no\ salutes the gentlen ai 's ear,
and I apprenend mat it came irom the same sotnee his poli
cal associates When we pointed to the exttava ant expendí
tuie of S37000000 n one yeai by his political fuend  the
country was told that such an amountwas m isf ensdbly neces
sary foi an ee momical ddminittntion of the Government, and
that nethingshoit of'mggaidiy btmgines:,'3 wot. uiefuse any
amountless To deny still ie xtravagince ofthepastAdmi
uistration is but a part of the tactics of the gentleman's roht cal
associates They dare not admit it, for such an admission
would but seal guilt upon their past conduct And it js not to
he wondered at thit that gentleman, in view of par y manage
ment, should, from thn elevated position, piociaim that no
other sound greets nib eai but the charge ( f "niggardly stirgi
negaJ against the past Administra ion—that like ra>s of light
diverging from a common centre his bold avowal may go forth
to the whole American people men mendation of his ¡ ohtical
friends, and in condemnation of his political i pponems
It is true that twel\ e millions of dollars have been asked for
but I should thmk that ¿heger Hernán would advert to the ob'
ject« of thp appr ipua ion as to painful i emimscences It is true
the money is asked for, and its appropriation pressed with ear
nestnessupon Congies*, and as the gentleman made his speech
only as a fair exposition oí matteis for hi1- constituents as he
avowed, I supposed he would have mctrporated m it the rca
sons why thi  laigeapproprntion was n ked for I did sup
pose he would have told his cons ituentb that Idree as it was yet
neaily every dollar was required to pay the debts which hie
politi al friends contráete I while m power, ind which they left
m paid when thev !eit the maragement of the G tvernment
Vv> had a ncht to e\pect this fu m one who boa ted that his
on y purpose it addressing the eommittee was to give the truth
to his constituents and had he done so I should then have had
reason to believe that, &o far as the gentleman was personally
concerred, these dehts had not bepn thrown upon the present
Administration for payment with a view of swelling us expert
dnures, and rendering U obnoxious to that charge of extravty
