river; likewise to give you such intelligence respecting the line of operations as will serve you, in reply to your inquiries. Send officer who complains of action of Colonel Powers to these headquarters, as his evidence will be needed in the investigation which Colonel Powers will immediately have to commence.

By order of Lieutenant-General Taylor:

W. F. BULLOCK, JR.,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

POST OF DEMOPOLIS, ALA., May 2, 1865.

Captain W. F. BULLOCK, Jr.,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Meridian, Miss.:

CAPTAIN: Herewith I respectfully hand you a copy of my letter* to General Steele which I sent him this morning by my adjutant, Lieutenant Roberston; also a copy of a letter from Colonel Royston, the material part only of which did I forward to General Steele. I also instructed Lieutenant Robertson to obtain, if possible, a statement from General Steele saying that the trains on the railroad may be run to Valley Bridge, near Selma, without being interfered with. I have taken every means in my power to make known the terms of the armistice by sending couriers out in various directions. So soon as Lieutenant Robertson returns you shall have the result of his visit to Selma.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. JONES,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding Post.

DEMOPOLIS, May 2, 1865.

Lieutenant Colonel E. SURGET,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Meridian, Miss.:

Lieutenant Ward is here with authority to raise and organize negro troops given by General Morgan, and he wishes to know if he can do so pending the armistice. Answer immediately.

S. JONES,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding Post.

DEMOPOLIS, May 2, 1865.

Captain C. F. JONES,

Commanding Souts, Uniontown, Ala.:

CAPTAIN: Your dispatch of yesterday was received at 4.30 p. m.; also one from the railroad agent. I immediately telegraphed the information to General Taylor. The firing at Cahawba I think was only a pretense or excuse for the depredation committed. I send you an official copy of a dispatch received last night from General Taylor respecting the armistice, and to-day he directs that no cotton or other property be destroyed without orders from himself or General Forrest. Yates and Brown left here after you did, and should be with you. Keep me fully and quickly advised of everything.

Very respectfully,

S. JONES,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding Post.
