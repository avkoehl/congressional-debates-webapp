They hold Hopping's Gap, a strong pass about four miles beyond Hawk's Nest, and all the news our men can get is from the country people, who report the force very large-10,000, with twenty pieces of artillery-all of which is of course as good as no report, except that there is a large force there, in a strong position against an approach from this side. I will try hard to get some spies among them.
