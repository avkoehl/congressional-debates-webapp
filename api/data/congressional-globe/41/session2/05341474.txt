ing to assent to that course. If Mr. Whit-
texore has any witnesses whom he wishes to
have examined let them be summoned before
the committee; but I am willing that the vote
on the question be postponed till Wednesday,
that the gentleman may have every reasonable
opportunity of defending himself, and then let
the House decide. If the committee have
charged Mr. Whittemore falsely or unfairly,
in God's name let the House say so and let
the country know it. If we have preferred
against him a false indictment let the House
decide upon it and let the country know it, or
if we have given him no fair opportunity of
vindicating himself let the country know it.
As far as I am concerned, I stand ready to be
condemned by the House and by my country-
men if it shall be found that I have not dis-
charged my duty as a member of the commit-
tee and of the House in dealing with this case.
I hope the question will now be put on the
resolution of the gentleman from Massachu-
setts, [Mr. Butler.]
The previous question was seconded and the
main question ordered; and under the Opera-
tion thereof the resolution of Mr. Bctler, of
Massachusetts, was agreed to.
Mr. LOGAN. I move that the report and
the accompanying evidence be printed.
The motion was agreed to.
Mr. KELSEY. I move that the House do
now adjourn.
Mr. McNEELY. I move that when the
House adjourns to-day it be to meet on
Wednesday next.
Mr. DAWES. I hope that motion will not
be adopted.
The question being put on Mr. McNeely's
motion, the House divided; and there wereâ€”
ayes 50, noes 65.
So the House refused to adjourn over till
Wednesday.
Mr. MYERS. I desire to make a privileged
