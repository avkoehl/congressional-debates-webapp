Treatment of Prisoners of War—Mr. Shanks.

pel a choice. Proof is ample that the rebel
authorities withheld food and fuel from the
prisoners for days prior to making proposi:
tionf to recruit from their ranks, and then
would offer them plenty of food, fuel, pay,
and clothing to join thetn.
A t Florence they only sought to recruit Union
prisoners of foreign birth, seeking for that very
indifference to nationality they hoped to find
in them, and of which I have spoken. But
let us remember that the question of politics
was carried into the management of all matters
in the North; that criminations and recrim-
inations were dangerously common, and preju-
dices arising fro (a this state of things may
have induced some who were not well-informed
or stable in their views to more readily yield.
It is in proof that many joined the enemy as a
means of escape from prison and captivity,
believing in their adversity that the end desired
would justify the meaps to obtain it, so great
were their sufferings, as is fully shown by the
sworn au-d documentary testimony in my pos-
session. There is f. reason that in connection
with either of these named would strengthen
them into cause, ana standing alone mast,
when understood, palliate, if not excuse this
offense. It is the story of their hardships.
If 1 could but paint it to you as hundreds of
prisoners have testified to it before me, I would
raise you from these seats to curse the damned
deeds. I would, if I eouid, call before your
imaginations the gaunt spectral forms of those
thousands of robbed, frozen, starved, beaten,
wounded, manacled, dogged, emaciated, neg-
lected, crazed, and murdered men, to speak
for themselves in the eloquent evidences of
their cruel treatment, to palliatg their com-
rades' treason, though they more manfully and
heroically died, refusing the offers. In the
hour of their prepared calamities, kindness
and plenty were offered the prisoners on con-
dition of their treachery. These few accepted,
while their comrades d«nouiK5ed the cowardly
proposals, and chose to die at the hands of
their persecutors rather than abandon their
cause and country. This was the better cause;
and yet who of us may stand here to-night, in
this pleasant noom, well clothed and fed, fully
protected by law, and coolly tell what was
best for those who suffered as these men
did? May God, in His infinite mercy, look
down with compassion on those prisoners who
in their afflictions and weakness did this thing.
Union prisoners of war are buried, as shown
by the rebel records and other testimony, in
sixty-eight places, the principal ones being 4s

The rebel prison records were badly kept,
and it was only when Union soldiers were de-
tailed, to keep the.roortality records of prisons,
camps, and stockades that attention was paid
to this important duty. The large number of
names preserved at Andersonville was the
work of Darance Atwater and Mr. Walch,
both detailed Union soldiers, prisoners of war
at the time ; so that out of 13,705 graves, all
save 618 were designated. By the records of
the prison at Salisbury, of 12,112 deaths only
78 names were preserved so their graves could
be designated. At Florence, of 2,795, only
one grave can be designated, and that one the
only eitizen prisoner who died there. Of the
total 36,401 graves of Federal prisoners of war
that have been dieeovered and the bodies
properly buried, 15,816, or near one half of
them, are necessarily marked " unknown,"
there being no record or distinctive marks by
which the bodies may be identified. The
number of graves found at these sixty-eight
places of burial, and known to be those
of Union prisoners of war, aggregate the num-
ber of 3ti,401, or 10,073 above the Secretary
of War's statement of March, 1, 1869, and is
equal to thirty-eight per cent, added to that
number. This most be the true estimate, since
it is made from the graves and corpses actually
discovered by the burial parties sent for the
purpose of making these interments, and gen-
erally accompanied by persons who had wit-
nessed the burial, very often by those who had
been prisoners at the particular places. Tins
record of burials, however, is a part of the
report above referred to, and entitled to equal
credit, and does not conflict with the Secre-
tary's views that his first estimate is below the
proper number, but fully sustains it. The
prejudice against Union soldiers has kept a
lively distinction between their graves and
rebel interments-, «o that the discovery is not
difficult,.though the name of the particular
person may not be known. That the graves
contain Uaion soldiers is kept in hateful re-
membrance. but further than this the records
are silent, aitid ihe southern people do not care.
This addition of 10,073 does not interfere
wiilt the stated numbers legally paroled and
exchanged,, illegally paroled, escaped, recap-
tured, or that joined the enemy, but only in-
creases the whole number captured by that
a^iouqt. From all the facts in my possession
gathered from the report of the Secretary of
War; the witnesses examined before the Com-
mittee on the Treatment of Prisoners of War;
the vast numbers of letters received by the
committee from all parts of the country, touch-
ing the treatment of prisoners ; from the many
narrativ^ written on the same; from the known
character of their captors; the extent of coun-
try traveled over; their treatment while on the
way to prison ; and the concurrent history of
the times—I firmly believe that the number
of deaths of Union prisoners exceeds the
graves discovered to this time.
The number of deaths and other casualties
of Union officers and enlisted men during the
war bears the following proportion to the whole
number of the grades in service or in cap-
tivity :
Killed in action: officers, one in twenty-one In
service; enlisted, one in iifty-five.
Killed and died of wounds : officeis, one in thir-
teen in service; enlisted, one in twenty eight.
Captured: officers, one in twelve in service:
enlisted, one in thirteen.
Died while prisoners: officers, one in sixty-ftur;
enlisted, one in five; citizens, one in ten.
Escaped from captivity: officers, one in eighteen ;
enlisted, one m seventy-six.
Recaptured by our forees : officers, none; enlisted,
one in tour hundred and ninety-four.
Prisoners who joined the enemy: officers, one in
seven hundred and eighty-eight; enlisted, one in
fifty-nine.
Total per cent, of deaths in the Army: officers,
onem nine; enlisted, one m eight.
Graves designated: one in two and one
third, being three in every seven, marked
;lunknown soldier." What a cold and deso-
late record of human suffering! It must strike
every one with astonishment that such diabol-
ism with the dead bodies of brave men could
in this age be practiced even by their enemies.
The grave should be a barrier to hatred, and
only bad men pass its portals with malice.

tory of the number of confederates captured
