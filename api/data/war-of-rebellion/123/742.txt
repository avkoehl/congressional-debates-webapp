original 10,000, so that they may join you as soon as possible. Come on immediately and join this part. It will wait at Fort Monroe for you.

NEW YORK, November 7, 1862.

Major-General HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

There appears to be some mistake in transmitting or translating your message. I don"t understand whether there are 10,000 troops or transports at Fort Monroe, or the troops only, or merely the transports for 10,000. The message says the latter. Do you wish me to come to Washington or to go direct from here to Fort Monroe?
