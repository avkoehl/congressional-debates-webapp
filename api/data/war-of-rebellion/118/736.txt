Major General W. S. ROSECRANS,

Commanding, Murfreesborough, Tenn.

GENERAL: Your letter of the 26th ultimo addressed to the Adjutant-General in relation to the release of deserters from the rebel army has been referred to this office and in reply I have the honor to say that the order of the Secretary of War directing that prisoners of war shall not be released on taking the oath of allegiance does not apply to deserters.

OFFICE COMMISSARY-GENERAL OF PRISONERS, Washington, D. C., June 3, 1863.

Colonel WILLIAM H. LUDLOW, Agent for Exchange.

COLONEL: Please find inclosed a copy+ of the declaration of exchange as I have corrected it in the fifth and seventh sections. I inclose also a list of captures+ at a number of places and at various times amounting in all to 1,181 men who are now at Benton Barracks. Can't you declare them exchanged en masse? And I will announce it in a special order, giving the names of the men exchanged.

I return herewith three papers received from you making inquiries in relation to prisoners. In two of the cases replies are given. You probably did not notice the offensive indorsement in pencil on the third one. I respectfully request that you return the papers that the indorsement may be removed and the matter will be properly attended to. Other similar papers referred to this office will be acted on as soon as possible.

Many inquiries are made for missing wounded soldiers captured at the battle of Chancellorsville. Some are possibly in hospital at Richmond and many probably have died. I will be greatly obliged to you
