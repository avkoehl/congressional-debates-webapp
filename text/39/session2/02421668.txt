In respect to these several bills which I have
reported back to the Senate, asking to be dis-
charged from their further consideration, the
committee also instruct me to say that owing
to the pressure of other business at the pres-
ent session of Congress they have deemed this
the most expedient course; but they do not
make these reports with a view to prejudice
the merits of any of these bills.
The reports were agreed to.
Mr. HOWARD, from the Committee on the
Pacific Railroad, to whom were referred the
memorials of the Chamber of Commerce of
Memphis, Tennessee, praying that the Union
Pacific railroad, southern branch, may be as
liberally endowed as the Union Pacific railroad
and its northern branches, and the memorial
of the president of the St. Paul and Pacific
Railroad Company of Minnesota, praying for
a grant of land and money equal to that made
to the Northern Pacific ltailroad Company and
the Union Pacific Railroad Company, asked to
be discharged from their further consideration ;
which was agreed to.
Mr. CHANDLER, from the Committee on
Commerce, to whom was referred the bill (II.
R. No. 937) to authorize changes in location
of lights and other aids to navigation on the
southern coasts of the United States, reported
it without amendment.

mittee on the Judiciary, to whom was referred
the bill (He R. No. 805) to restore the posses-
sion of lands confiscated by the authorities of
the States lately in rebellion, reported it with
an amendment.
Mr. ANTHONY, from the Committee on
Post Offices and Post Roads, to whom was
referred the memorial of the State Historical
Society "of Iowa, praying for a modifiation of
the postal laws, so as to permit postage on
pamphlets, paper, books, &c., forwarded to
historical societies to be paid on delivery, re-
ported a bill (S. No. 618) to amend the laws
relating to the Post Office Department; which
was read and passed to a second reading.
Mr. MORRILL, from the Committee on
Commerce, to whom was referred the joint
resolution (H. R. No. 283) authorizing the Sec-
retary of State to present to Captain James
G. Smith, of the British brig Victoria, a gold
chronometer, in token of appreciation of his
services in rescuing from death the master,
officers, crew, and passengers on board of the
American brig E. H. Fitler, reported it with-
out amendment.
He also, from the same committee, to whom
was referred the bill (H. R. No. 1167) to au-
thorize entry and clearance of vessels at the
ports of Boothbay and Saint George, Maine,
reported it without amendment.
He also, from the Committee on the District
of Columbia, to whom was referred the bill
(S. No. 616J to reduce the number of members
of the levy court of the county of Washington,
District of Columbia, reported it without
amendment.
Mr. CONNESS, from the Committee on
Post Offices and Post Roads, to whom was
referred the bill (S. No. 603) to authorize the
establishment of ocean mail steamship service
between the United States and the Hawaiian
Islands, reported it with an amendment.
Mr. SHERMAN. I am directed by the
Committee on Finance, to whom was referred
the bill (H. R. No. 1039) making appropria-
tions for the current and contingent expenses
of the Indian department and for fulfilling
treaty stipulations with various Indian tribes
for the year ending 30th June, 1868, to report

fort gratiot military reserve.
Mr. HOWARD. I am directed by the ftim-
mittee on Military Affairs and the Militia, to
whom was referred the bill (H. R. No. 607) to
amend an act granting the right of way over
the military reserve at Fort Gratiot, Michigan,
to report it without amendment and recom-
mend its passage ; and I hope, if there be no
objection, that the bill may be put upon its
passage at once. I do not think it will occasion
any debate at all. The committee have looked
into it. I think its passage is quite necessary
for the benefit of the public as connected with
a railroad that has possession of a portion of
the military reserve.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. It requires
the unanimous consent of the Senate to con-
sider the bill on the day it is reported. Is
there any objection?
Mr. DOOLITTLE. I shall not raise any
objection on the statement of the honorable
