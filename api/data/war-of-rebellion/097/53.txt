HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS, March 20, 1865.

Brevet Major-General WEBB,Chief of Staff:

Two deserters from Sixteenth North Carolina Cavalry came in this morning. They report all quiet in the rebel lines, but are expecting an attack from us. They think their men will not stand a hard fight, as they are tired out. Their cavalry is posted from South Side Railroad to Stony Creek. They have thrown up earth-woks at Cat Tail Run, and in the event of our advancing their pickets have orders to fall back to this line of works and make a stand until they can be re-enforced. These works and not very formidable. The main body of their cavalry is between Dinwiddie Court-House and Stony Creek. Their pickets come up about half way between Rowanty Creek and Gravelly Run. Every morning they send out from two to eight scouts in front of their picket-line. These men were sent out this morning on this duty and took advantage of it to come over. Their rations are now reduced to one ounce of meat and two handfuls of meal per day. The men brought in their carbines and equipments, but could not bring their horses.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General, Commanding.
