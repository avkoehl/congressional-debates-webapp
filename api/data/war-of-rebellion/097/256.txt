connection with the Second Corps. I shall attack anyhow about 6 p. m., of not attacked sooner myself. The enemy was marching down and not in breast-works.

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,March 29, 1865 - 5.40 p. m.

General WARREN,

Commanding Fifth Corps:

I am directed by Major Meade to acknowledge the receipt of your dispatch announcing General Griffin's success and you intention to attack. He is gratified to learn that your attention is to push the enemy, and wishes you every success. General Humphreys has been ordered to support you with Miles' division and to push forward with his line.

ALEX. S. WEBB,

Brevet Major-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,March 1865 - p. m.

General WEBB:

General Griffin's skirmish line advanced as soon as the enemy gave way and found that they had retired, probably to their entrenchments. General Crawford's skirmishers on the left, as soon as they could be posted, advanced to beyond the Boydton pike. My line are now following up the skirmish line. The fight occurred just north of an old saw-mill, about mile from Gravelly Run. General Ayres sends me word that our picket-line sees the enemy's cavalry flying north from Dinwiddie, and think Sheridan is after them. The fighting was very severe for a while. I cannot yet estimate the killed and wounded of either side. General Sickel is wounded; Major Maceuen is killed; General Chamberlain was slightly wounded.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,March 29, 1865 - 7 p. m.

Major-General WARREN,

Commanding Fifth Corps:

The major-general commanding directs me to congratulate you and Major-General Griffin upon your success to-day. The telegraph will soon be at your headquarters, and you will then be in communication with these headquarters.

ALEX. S. WEBB,

Brevet Major-General and Chief of Staff.
