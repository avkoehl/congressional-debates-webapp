INDEPENDENCE, October 6, 1864.

Major-General CURTIS:

I have arrived here and leave in the morning to join Colonel Ford's command at Pleasant Hill, thirty- four miles southeast of Kansas City. I learn form reliable source that General Price has detached a portion of his army (5,000) under Marmaduke to make a raid in this neighborhood and Southern Kansas, where he will be joined by Price, after the capture of General Brown's forces, which he seems confident of taking. Yesterday there was a band of guerrillas on Fire Prairie, seven miles east of this place, on a reconnaissance, and returned going east. No news of them to-day. I will learn more in the morning about Price's movements.
