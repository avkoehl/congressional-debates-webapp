THE LATE HON. FELIX G. McCONNELL. !
A message was received from the House of Rep- j
resematives, conveying the proceedings of that j
body up >n the announcement of the death of the !
Hon. Felix Grundy McCoxnell, late a Repre-
sentative from the State of Alabama.
The message having been read,
Mr. LEWIS rose, and addressed the Senate as
follows:
Mr. President: The melancholy event which
has been announced to us by the resolutions of the
House makes it incumbent on one of the Senators
from Alabama to ask-of this body the passage of
the usual lesolutions, as a tribute of respect to the
memory of the deceased. In performing this last
sad service, with me, one prompted as much by
private friendship as by public duty, I shall be ex-
cused for not going into those details as to the man-
ner of his death, which have already been made
most painfully public. The Hon. Felix Grundy !
McConnell died in this city on the 10ih of Sep- j
tember last, in the 36th year of his age, and during
the lecess of the present Congress, to which he '
had been elected by the people of the seventh Con- [
gressional district of Alabama. He had also served 1
as a member during both sessions of the 28th Con-1
gress. Before his election to Congress he had
served one year as a representative of the Alabama
Legislature, and for three years immediatelv be-
fore coming to Congress he had served as a mem-
ber of the State Senate. He also enjoyed other
honors, military and civil, at the hands of the people.
He was a native of Nashville, Tennessee, and re-
moved from Fayetteville, in that State, to Alabama,
about the 26th year of his age. He was raised a me-
chanic, afterwards studied law, and was admitted
to the bar." From the time he became a citizen of
Alabama few men enjoyed as much of the esteem
and confidence of the community to which he was
known, and no man, perhaps, exercised a greater
influence and control over the political opinions
i and sentiments of the masses of men with whom
he associated. Without the advantages of educa-
tion or family influence, and in spite of irregu-
larities of habit and deportment, which would
have consigned a man of less decided cast of char-
acter to utter failure and obscurity, it was his rare
fortune never to have suffered a political defeat.
His invariable political success was maintained for
years in the face of any and every opposition, be-
fore a constituency possessing an aggregate of in-
telligence not surpassed by perhaps any constitu-
1 ency in the Union. A constituency, too, as re-
markable for its industry, its quiet submission to
the restraints of law, and its perpetual observance
of all the proprieties of deportment, in public or
private, as it is for its unquestioned aggregate in-
telligence. This success can only be attributed to
high qualities of head and heart, which his faults,
undisguised as they were, and worn even conspicu-
ously upon the outer surface of his character, could
never conceal from the popular view. With him
a generous nature sought its indulgence in an en-
larged and intimate acquaintance with the great
body of his fellow-citizens. JNo man stood nearer
to the people, or knew them better; and therefore
no one ever did, or could, enter more fully into all
their sympathies and feelings. He was, in the
fullest sense of the term, what lie professed to beâ€”â– 
a Democrat, not merely in abstract opinion, but in
instinct, feeling, and association. A regard for
exact justice and equality of rights and privileges
among his fellow-citizens was "not a mere senti-
ment, but one of-the strongest passions of his very
nature. To an organization of political sentiment
and feeling so essentially popular, he united a re-
I markable sagacity and almost intuitive knowledge
of men, a distinct and well-defined system of poli-
tical opinion and action, and uncommon tact, and
an unconquerable perseverance in carrying his
' political principles into effect. Such were the ele-
, mcnts of his success, and Mich the qualities upon
, which was based a popularity in his district which
I to many but slightly acquainted with him was so
I much a matter of surprise. In the relations of
! private life he was amiable. In his family circle
: he was fond and affectionate To his friends
he was kind, constant, and often generous to a
j fault. To suffering humanity, in any and every
i situation, he had a melting heart and an open hand.
â–  Just and kind to others, his faults were all against
himself.
Mr. L., ir> conclusion, submitted the following
resolutions:
Resolved, That this body has heard with deep
sensibility the message from the House announ-
cing the decease of the Hon. Felix G. McCoxnell,
a Representative in Congress from the State of
Alabama.
Resolved, That as a testimony of respect for the
memory of the deceased, the members of the Sen-
ate will wear crape upon the left arm for thirty
days.
Resolved, That as a further mark of respect for
the memory of the deceased, the Senate do now
adjourn.
The resolutions having been adopted,
The Senate adjourned.
