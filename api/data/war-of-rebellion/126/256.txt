There are no records on file in this office by which the number of animals purchased by the Cavalry Bureau prior to January 1, 1864, can be determined.

Reports to this office of purchases of artillery horses and mules date from September 1, 1864.

During the fiscal year ending June 30, 1865, the prices paid for cavalry horses ranged from $144 per head (the lowest contract price) to $185 per head (the highest market price.) From September 1, 1864, to June 30, 1865, the prices paid for artillery horses ranged from $161 to $185 per head, and during the latter period the prices paid for mules ranged from $170 to $195 per head.
