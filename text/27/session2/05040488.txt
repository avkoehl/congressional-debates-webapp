Koacts be instructed to nyfmre m what manner the Madisoman
newspaper obtains! a k*wledge of certam papers supposed to
tie filed in the G-eiietel B st Office Depaltment, in relation to the
appointment of Mr-Wpson as postmaster at St Louis, to wit—
a letter from Mr Beftpn to Mr Van Buren, and another from
Mr. Benton to tie Postmaster General, and also in what man
ner theeefitorof that paper became possessed of the informa
tion that there was na other recommendation for Mr Watson,
and thaf his appointment was made on the sole recommenna
«ton oiMr. Benton Also, that the said committee inquire into
the manner in which the sard editor obtained a copy of the
Postmaster General's letter to the Senate's Committee on the
PostOfffce and Poit Roads, in relation to the nomination of
Samuel B Churchill and recommending him for confirmation
' And that they have power to send ¡or persons and papers, and
to take testimony on oath, and report the same to the Senate
Mr. MERRICK said, m the first place, he desired to offer an
ameiidtnent to the resolution he then moved to strike out all af
tei the word "Resolved," and to mfaert the following, viz
*'AH letters of recommendation, and other papers touching
and concernió? any nomination for office, which may be sent or
communicated by the President of the United ¡states, or any
Chief executive officer, to the Senate, or any one of its commit
tees, shall be held to be confidential under the thirtieth rule, but
alt such papers, afterthe decision of the question on any noim
nation, shall be returned to the proper department of the Gov
ernmeut whence they emanated, and not placed on the files of
the Senate, unless so ordered
Mr. MERRICK entered at considerable length into the sub
ject, With a view of showing the expediency of establishing
some such rule of action as he suggested, for the Senate and
committees, leaving each member individually to assert and ex-
ercise his right of investigating documents on file m the depau
ments    He insisted that such a rule had always been ai ted
upon by the Senate heretofore, and he quoted Mr Barry's refti
sal to furnish the Committee on the Post Office and Post Roads
with papers in a case in point   Mr Barry's letter to the chair
-man of the committee was dated 1st October, 1834, and contain
ed such sound aigument, that he should read it as applicable to
tins occasion   He then read the letter, which was of consider
ajile length    He deduced from this, that the Senate had no
right to demand such papers, and contended that if they were
communicated they were subject to the implied injunction of
being confidentially submitted for the purpose of facilitating
the action of the Senate m executive session; and therefoie
should not be made public, without express authority    It wis
evidently in thepowei of the departments to withhold such pa
pers, and if his amendment was not adopted, there would cer
tamly be great reserve in communications of the kind hete
after.   Eor these leasons, It was expedient that .some rule such
as his amendment contemplated should be adopted    In con
elusion, Mr M passed a high and much lengthened eulogy on
the official ability, couuesy, integrity, petseverance, industiy,
deportment m office, and fidelity of the Postmastei Geneial,
which had entitled him to his fullest confidence, admiration
and approbation    His intercourse, as chairman of the Co nmit
tee on tha Post Office and Post Roads, had been almost daily
during this session, and in this intercourse he found the litad
of the department at his desk, and attending to the public mtei
este, which engrossed his whole attention, at all hours and in
all seasons.
Mr. MANGUM, observed that he felt very little mteiest in
this matter, one way oi the other, but if the honorable Senatoi
from Missouri desired this investigation to go forwatd, he coul 1
not say that he would have much objection as to the ge r ei d
principle, but with regdrcl to the immediate m itter in hand, In
would submit it to the honorable senator whether it was not
rather small game for the occupation of a standing committee
of the Senate to make inquiry how all the filth and calumny
dribbled into the common sewer of this Administraron Tin
honorable Senator, he was sine, would find it moie congenial
to his taste to aim at highei game
He was glad, however, to find (hat theie was it l«ast one
memberoftlnabodylMi MerrickI who had audi uncommon
powers of discrimination, as to be able to discover, in the head
of the Post Office Depaltment, talents, (ftinal ability, ,-nd
HHehty sotianwendent, as to rendei the possessor entu<)> de
solving oflus fullest confidence and approbation Whit he
remarkedas an evidence of this discrimination was (he Sen i
tor'seulogy on that functionary's ./«Mi/y Pi iplity to whom i
fidelity to the Whig pany 7 He nought the hnnoiab'o ten
tor from Missouri was placing Inrasof in a false position by
Ms hostility to the Postmasier General, who was promotuv to
office and retaining more of his party than of the Whig part}
He confessed it had struck him with sm pi lse to hear a Whi"
Senator eulogize such a public officer loi "fidelity ' II?
would be glad to know whether the eulogy was merited foi
"fidelity" to the Senatoi's party
Mr MERRICK said he would nevn hesitate to bestow pvaise
when he wassatisfied that the object was worthy lie had be
stowed it in this instance whete he thought, m his solemn belief, it
was duo Ho again reiterated, that lie hail found the Postmas
ter General, late an 1 early, toiling ai his desk , and he believed
that he had sucre-sfully endeavored to curt ill the expenses of
the department, wifhthe view to bung about the retrenchment
so much desired He would not, howevei, consult the -enator
from North C irolina as to where ho shoiuti mete out pi u=e
Mr BLNTOIN ea.d the houi of one was come and the
special order of the day was entuled to pi eference lie did not
mean to interfere with that order ind therefore sh mid only
say that the Senator from North Carolina [Mr Mangiw] was
a little mistaken in supposing thatthe object of the lesolulion
was to reach the pioceedings of a printing office , on the ron
trary, the object was to reach the proceedings of ti e Post Oflire
Department Certain rules of secrecy were assumed fir that
department, which excluded membeisfiom seeing papers on
its files wi ich concerned themselves an 1 their constituent*
andj at the sane time, pub'ications appear in a newspaoei
here, which contravene these rule , and which publication
beais lofeinal evidence of having emanated fiom the depart
nient The object of the resolution was to asrei'nn th it ftct
or, at least, to give an oppoi(unity of «howin^, fiom the pubh
cation itself-from ¡ts internal evidence—tint K had so emu n
" ed, and this, he believed was fully shown on ypsteulay Tlic
publication itself was relied upon to shuw its onem, to wit
in the Post Office Department, and certain it is thatnoSeia
tor has expressed a different opinion The publication fathers
stself, and shows that the author had access to the files of the
Post Office Department, made statements of what was, and
iWhatwag not, in the department, assumed to give quotations
from letters on file, which copies of the letters actually on file
show to be false, and that all this was in violation of the rule
of secrecy claimed for the department, and enforced against
members of Congress and their constituents Mr B, for him
self, was ready to leave the mattet where his expositions of
yesterday had left it, and should continue to stand upon the
¿round that the public offices were public—that the papers on
hie in those offices were open to the inspection of those whom
they concerned, and to members of Congress, on the part ot
their constituents                                                                          ,
Mr MANGUM movod to lay the matter on the table, and if
it should be thought necessary hereafter, it could be called up.
Mr MERRICK said his amendment was only intended to, as
it would, facilitate the intercourse of the senate and com
mittees with the Executive Difficulties would arise m ob
taming information from the depaitments, unless this explana
tory resolution was adopted                 .
Mr MANGUM had no objection toadoptmg the principle
of the resolution if, indeed, it was not already so acted upon
Mr LINN The Senator from Mary land said it would facih
tate the intercourse with the Executive That was very ques
tionable It was a very questionable mattei, worthy ol consic'-
eiation, whether the Senate should resoitto the Executive for
information Whether it would not be better to take the stand
independent of the Executive, and leave him to send such m
foimationas he thinks proper to carry out his own nomma
tions If he did not think proper to send any, the Senate could
rest on its own responsibility fox its action, asking information
where it could be had
Mr MERRICK Mid if the Senator fiom Missouri [Mr Ben
ton] did not persist in his resolution he would withdiaw the
amendment fot (he present, and intioduce it as an independent
pioposition
Mr MANGUM renewed his motion to lay the whole subject
on the table
Mr MDRRICK then withdrew his amendment
Thequestion was then taken on laying the original resolution
on the table, and carried in the affirmative
ORDERS Or THE DAY.
On motion of Mr BERRIEN, chairman of the Jjdiciary Com
mittee, the Senate, as in committee of the whole, resumed from
yesterday the consideration of the bill to provide further re
medial justice m the district courts of the United Slates
Mr HUNTINGTON observed that this bill asserted two dus
tmct propositions—one, the constitutionality of Congress to pass
such a law, and the other, the expediency of doing it Before
discussing these points, he would take a cursory view o the
provisions of the bill itself, whiGh he bad examined with great
attention, and he was glad to have an opportunity of doing jus
tice to the honorable chairman of the Judiciaiy Commi tee,
[Mr Berrien,] by saying that H was a bill drawn up with con
summate ability, evincing gieat care, reseaich, legal acumen,
lemarkable perspicacity, and translm ent clearness
Mr II then recapitulated indue order the several provisions
of the bill, commenting on each, and showing the effect lo be
produced
H was admitted by the Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr
Buchanan] thit the 25th section of the judiciary act was con-
stitutional, and he had even gone furthei, and admitted that it
wis constitutional for the Supreme Court to take out of the
S ito tribunals the íevision of criminal cases as well as civil, in
its capacity of an appellate court
But that Senator had doubted the constitutional powerorap
p ymg he writ ol habeas corpus in the manner proposed an 1,
much as he (**i H ) approved ot the vuy ableatguo entu ade
by the Senator from Massachusetts yesterday, on this p >in ,
he wou d without anymtention of discussing the subjec fully
at present, merely say that lie would no' himself rest 'or such
authonty on the second clause ot the thi daiticle m the Con
sti ution alone, foi he would only consider it subsithaty to the
powtr given m the first ai tide of the Constuu ion Before he
stated lus own views, he would examine the arguments of the
Senaloi from Pennsylvai ia on both questions—that of constl
luiionaiKy and that of expediency
Fust, as to theimpoitance of the measure. He concuned
wilh ih" Senatoi that this was a very imronantblll but he did
nut sa\ so for the same reasons assigned by the "Señalo! fl >m
Pennsylvania, becau e he denied that theie was any new pirn
ci, le pioposed, the luipoilance consis ed in the necessity foi,
anil asseinnn oí an essential power, ccutioveilul by 'he e\tia
oniitnry docti ne no,vbiought foirvaid ihat it is loteois-nu
ti< nil for this Government to peifniir us du íes m i elation to
f reign nations—duti sessential to u e mal, enance of its own
national lnilependtncean 1 na íonalcharactei
Second with regard to the Sen Hoi's anticipation that the
vote on this bill would, be a strict party vote between Federal
ism andanti Federalism He did not believe such would he the
vote, for he was wellsa isfied it would be «tricily m conformity
with the individual opinions of Senators as to its merits, its
constitutionality, and he expediency
Third m reference lo its connexion with other measures of
this Administration, all of which had been chaiactenzed by the
Senatoi as part and paicel uf one concentrating system, shad
owing torth a rapid s'rlde towards consolidation This lie (Mr
II) denied for if ihe system was an evidence of a íapid stnde
tower s consolidation, it wasalso an evidence that the first s'ep
had not been taken by this Admimstiatioo, as natiorat bulk
bills bankruit bills, dis'ubtl'ion acts an 1 othei measuies of
supposed cemializa'ion tendency—alluded to by the Senatoi—
hadbeenjas ed and sanc'iomd overand overagain, within the
past i.ity year , and, therefore, the present Administiatum
ronld not justly be chaiged wt'h any veiy new or rap d strides
towaidi a consolidation that has receded, if appioached at all
He asked, wha> evidence was there in the distribution act or
in the pioposed exchequer scheme, of a disposition to consol!
dtiioii And as to ihe I ankrupt law, he would venture tos-iy
that theie was no question as- to the power of Congress to pass
a i nifnim bankrupt law, and he could not see why such a law
lould l)< corsideied as a stride towards con ohdation meieiy
I ecause there maybe some i'iffuence of opinion as to therro
pr ety of its provisions in detail
He next alluded te the Rho'e Island affair, and depiecated
the ¡nemature discussion ol th[1 subject He di 1 not me n to
deny to the people of that State the right to change their Gov
eminent in any lawful mannei, buthp hoped the power vtsted
by the Constitution in theExeculive would be successfully ex
ercised should it become necessary, to protect the people of
that gallant Statefrom any unlawful usurpation              '
J     With regard to auothei tendency towards consolidation, al
luded to by the Senator fiom Peiinsylvania-the disposition
evinced in a bill which had lomt from another branch,of Con-
gress (the appoitionmentbi'l)toal<rogate a sovereign nghtof
the States as to sending their Representatives to Congress in
whatever way they pleased, he would simply ask, what had
that to do with the subject before the Senate now 1 When that
bill came up, it would be time enough to discuse the subject.
It was enough now to sjy it had nothing to do with the bill
under discussion                                                         „              ,
He would now proceed to his mam arguments, first, on the
constitutionality of this meas art, and next, on its expediency
He would take it for granted thatthe constitutionality of the
judiciary act was undoubted And he thought the Senator
from Pennsylvania had committed a groat error in supposing
that, because the framersof the judiciary act did not give more
than an appellate juusdiction to the feupreme Court, it was
fair to infer they had exhausted the power authorized by the
Constitution
Mr BUCHANAN interposed to say that he did not pronounce
any opinion that they had exhausted the poner of the Consti-
tution                                                                         , , . , .
Mr HUNTINGTON, in continuation, observed that he did
not so understand «he Senatoi What he had slated was, that
the Senatoi had said it was fair tomfei that theframere of the
Constitution tonceived they had not constitutional authority to
to go further than to give apnel'ate j unsdiction to the Supreme
Couitm the cases eniureia ed lie nextadvened to the objec-
tion Ulged, that the wilt o! habrás corpus would, in the cases
prop sed n the bill, have the effect of deii>ing to one of the
pames concerned the right oi trialby jury, secured by the Con-
stitution.
Mr BUCHANAN interposed again to «ay that his statement
was that the «tate would be denied the right of trial by jury
Mr II^TINGTOIN sjid he understood it so—the word
''party " of course, meaning the State, as well as the accused.
Mr II here entered into a lesa) aisument with regard to the
constitutional limitation of the appellate jurisdiction of the Su-
preme Court, ami then wi h i^gar I to the limitation of its origi-
ral jurisdiction In the pirgrtss of his arguments, he reverted
to the cases quoted by thee who had preceded him in the dis-
cussion—namely, the cases of Martin and of Coen against the
Mate of Virginia, and Worcester against the State of Georgia,
and was examining some views taken by the Senator from
Pennsylvania, when
Mi BUCHANAN in erpostd, to say that his argument had
beenstrange'> misrorcened bv the S nator from Connecticut,
as well as by the Senatoi from Massachusetts lie found it ne-
ces&aiy to state his uam oi argument m his own words [Here
Mr B recapitulated his legal argument m refeience to this
brtnch of the <uibjec' 1
Mr HUí^TI^&iO^ d i not mean to m «reptesent anythm
the Sena or hal sail He hi lets ood him (o assert that the
origina! íurisdirtion m crin mal case« cannot be taken away
from the States by the sjpiene Couit What is the proposi.
non in this bill'!—that if if e pov\ er exists in ihe Supreme Court,
under its appellati autn tuy, to take Cases from the State tribu-
nals after judgment, whe rersuch cases are civil or criminal,
it has the «ame power bcfoi e judgment, if Congress thinks fit to
authorize its exeicise JNovv lilis v as the proposition which
I e (llr H 1 asserted to be co~s i otional
Mr BUCHANAN a«keil, did the Senator mean to say that
ti e Su¡ reme Court could [rorouice judgment, m such cases,
under its appellate inrHt'ictioni
Mr IIUNTINGTOA said H did not nece«anly foilow that
such should be the consequence He then went at large into
thesobj ct of the law of ii it t , in relation to which, he con-
tendei there was n i d ff cu y "5 be United States courts take

he contended tnatit wot da noun to notl mg but an admis-
sion that the United Statt  lours have ro jurisdiction at all
ovei cases m which foreigner and then interests aie concerned.
Such, also, was the argumen that foieign nations had no right
to complain, having admit e 1 the United States into the family
of nations with a written Constitution m doing so, they had
acted with then eyes open, and they weit ti ereby deprived of
all nDht to comp tin Taese a gumenis he combated at con-
í-iderab e length, and contended, "not only that they were un-

monstra nig to foieign powers tbat this Govtrnment had not

upon this an'icipatcd jealosy B3 a mere bugbear—no such

me ts deduced from the Mcleod dificulty
He maintained that if ihe principies advanced by the State
court of New York on that «se had been carried out, the
coui try would Inve h en inv Ived m war. for he considered
th  pune pies la" i ajwn by Mt Justice Cowen were contrary
