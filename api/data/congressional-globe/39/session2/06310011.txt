in London or Frankfort, could be substituted
for our six per cents without any other expense
to the United States than the trifling commis-
sion* to the agents through whom the ex-
changes might he made. The saving of inter-

erate item ; and the advantages of having our

investors is too important to be disregarded.
firth. The fifth and last remedy suggested
is, the rehabilitation of the Statesreceutlv in
insurrection.
In alluding to this subject, the Secretary
feels that he steps upon dangerous ground, and
that he may be charged with introducing a
politiral topic in & financial report; but, in his
opinion, there is no question now before the
country more important in its bearings upon
our finances than the political and consequently
industrial status of the southern States. Em-
bracing. as they do, one third part of the rich-
est lands of the country, and producing arti-
cles of great value for home use and for ex-
portation to other countries, their position with
regard to the General Government cannot re-
main unsettled, and their industrial pursuits
cannot continue to be seriously disturbed,
without causing such a diminution of the pro-
duction of their great staples as must neces-
sarily affect our revenues, and render still
more unsatisfactory than they now are, our
trade relations with Europe. As long as the
present anomalous condition of these States
continues—as long as they have no participa-
tion in the Government, to the support of
*hich they are compelled to contribute—it is
idle to expect that their industry will be re-
stored or their productions increased. On
the contrary, there is reason to apprehend that
until harmonious relations again exist between
the Federal Government and these Stetes, the
condition of their industrial interests will be-
come day by day more uncertain and unsatis-
factory. There will be no real prosperity in !
tnese States, and consequently no real pros- '
perity in one third part of the United States, :
until ail possess again equal privileges under j
the Constitution. Can the nation be regarded
as in a healthy condition when the industry of ;
so large a portion of it is deranged ? And can
the labor question at the South be settled as
long as the political status of the South is un-
settled? Can the national credit be elevated
and the public debt be rapidly reduced unless
the southern States shall largely contribute to
the public revenues; and can such contribu-
tions be relied upon as long as they remain in
their present disfranchised condition? Will the
tax payers of the North continue to be patient
unless their burdens of taxation can be lessened
hjr being equally shared by the people of the
South? Regarded thus as a purely financial
Question, the relation of these States to the
Federal Union is an exceedingly interesting
4nd important one, and as such it demands the
calm and careful consideration of Congress.
The Secretary has thus presented, in such
manner as his pressing official duties would
permit, his views of the financial condition o f
the country, the causes of trouble, present and
prospective, and the remedies for the same.
If these remedial measures shall bo approved
by Congress, and enforced by appropriate le-
gislation, he is confident that specie payments
be resumed by the time our interest-bear-
ing notes are retired, which must be done in
less than two years, and probably will be in a
much shorter period.
These measures look to an increase of labor,
and consequently of production; to a fulfill-
ment of obligations by the Government and
; to a reduction of the public debt
Mtjw same time that taxes are being equalized
Md lessened ; to lower prices, and apparently
'ler, Imt really more prosperous times ; to
* rfJiteration of specie payments without the
financial troubles which usually precede a re-
sumption after a long period of suspension and
'Dilation. The Secretary does not mean to
assert that the adoption of all these measures
(although he regards each as important) is
absolutely necessary to a return to specie pay-
ments, nor that other remedies may not be
adopted by Congress to rescue the country
from impending financial troubles. He pre-
sents, as he considers it to be his duty to do,
his own views, and asks that they may receivc
careful consideration, and be adopted if they
commend themselves to the wisdom of Con-
gress, and rejected if measures better calcu-
! lated to secure the desired end can be devised.
1 he most sanguine and hopeful must perceive
that the business of the country cannot for a
much longer time be mn upon the present high
level with safety. The speculative interest,
large and powerful in itself, is receiving daily
new accessions of strength bv the increase
of individual credits; and when speculators
and debtors control the financial policy of
the country a financial collapse is inevitable.
These untoward and dangerous influences can
now be resisted, and the true interests of the
people require that they should be resisted
promptly and decisively.
Unsatisfactory as is, in many respects, our
condition, there is cause for congratulation
that we have thus far escaped those severe
financial troubles which usually befall nations
at the close of expensive and protracted wars.
With our vast resources and the buoyant and
persistent energy of a free people, it will be our
own fault if we do not escape them altogether.
The Secretary has pointed out the financial
dangers around and before us, in order that
they may be considered and avoided before
they culminate in general disaster. Strong as
is his conviction that we have been for some
time, and still are, moving in the wrong direc-
tion, and that much of our prosperity is •
unreal and unreliable, his confidence in the
ability of the country to right itself speedily
is unshaken. We have but touched the sur- ,
face of our resources—the great mines of our
national wealth are yet to be developed. The !!
experiences of the past four years have only |
assured us of our strength. It is only neces- j
sary that our true situation be understood in
order that the proper remedies may be applied.
There is no insurmountable obstacle in the way
of restoration to perfect financial health, with-
out the painful trials to which it has been appre-
hended we must first be subjected. To be a co-
worker with Congress and the people in effect-
ing this most desirable result has been, and will
continue to be, the highest aim of the Secretary.
After a careful survey of the whole field, the
Secretary is of the opinion that specie pay-
ments may be resumed, and ought to be re-
sumed, as early as the 1st day of July, 1868,
while he indulges the hope that such will be
the character of future legislation, and such !
the condition of our productive industry, that
this most desirable event may be brought about
at a still earlier day.
