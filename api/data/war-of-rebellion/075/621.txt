battery a few hundred yards in front of his main line, where it will sweep some distance up the valley, and I think will command the diagonal road from Marietta, which comes into the Sandtown road a mile or two in advance of our present position. The movements of the enemy's cavalry in retreating satisfy me of the importance of the connecting there. The possession of the end of the ridge, if we can hold it, I am now sure will prevent the enemy from extending his line along it, since it would be necessarily flanked and enfilade by our positions. The only objection is the extension relatively to the strength of my command and the distance from supports. Upon carefully re- examining the ground my conviction is strengthened that it is exceedingly desirable to hold all we have gained, and if Hascall's place could possibly be filled by troops drawn rom other parts of the line it would give all the force needed to make a point- d'appui which would be safe and exceedingly available for future movements in this direction if they become necessary. I only suggest this by way of indicating the impression made on my own mind by the position.

Brigadier General J. D. COX,

Commanding Third Division, Twenty- third Army Corps:

GENERAL: General Sherman directs that we make what we have gained as secure as possible and remain on the defensive. No material advantage has been gained anywhere except that gained by you. Thomas' losses are very heavy. I have sent to ascertain whether Barter's brigade can be spared from its present position or whether that position can be changed to advantage. I think it will be necessary to retain him here; if so I will cause him to relieve the entire picket- line around to the right of Burd's old position and send the regiment Byrd left there to its brigade. Make your position very strong. I regard it as the key to the next movement.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major- General, Commanding.

P. S.- I have your dispatch of 4.30 p. m. I do not think the importance of the position you have gained can be overestimated, especially in view of the failure elsewhere and probable future movements. I will explain the matter to General Sherman and see what can be done.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. M. SCHOFIELD,
