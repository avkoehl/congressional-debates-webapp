Lieutenant-General GRANT:

Your dispatch of yesterday in relation to Coehorns just received. General Hunt has six mortars at City Point, which he designed for the Eighteenth Corps, when it was a part of this army. I have directed him to turn them over to Major-General Smith. My engineer troops are actively employed, and cannot well be spared; besides, I understand the mortars are furnished with beds, and there is nothing whatever to be done but to smooth a level place to set them in.

Colonel T. S. BOWERS,Asst. Adjt. General, Hdqrs. Lieutenant-General Grant, City Point:

Did you receive my dispatch of the 22nd asking for General Meade whether he could delay relieving the garrison at City Point until the arrival of the troops expected there from the White House,and which should reach that place by to-morrow? General Meade directs me to add that it will embarrass him to detach at this time a garrison for City Point from the troops here. If it is thought advisable the engineer troops under General Benham can be assigned temporarily to garrison duty at City Point.

S. WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

CITY POINT, June 24, 1864.

General WILLIAMS:

I presume there is no objection to the present garrison remaining at City Point until the troops from White House arrive. General Grant is now on his way to your headquarters and can give you definite information.
