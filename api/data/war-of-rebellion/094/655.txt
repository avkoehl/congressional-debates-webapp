MOBILLE, ALA., December 6, 1864.

Colonel GEORGE WILLIAM BRENT,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Montgomery, Ala.:

COLONEL: The following is respectfully submitted for the information of General Beauregard, and gives an account of engineering operations bearing upon the safety of the communications of the Army of Tennessee:

At Corinth, Fort Williams, the stronghold of the place, is repaired, made self-sustaining, and needs but its garrison (200 men) and its armament (six field pieces, viz, two Parrotts, two Napoleon, and two howitzers) to make it hold out against a large force until starved into surrender. By the present date it is expected that the remaining points around the town are finished and also ready to be manned; wells and bombproof will then be prepared in all. A good position for batteries to defend the passage of the river against gunboats is reported four miles below Savannah, the western being the concave side and its banks being sufficiently elevated to command the ground opposite; good roads lead to and from this crossing. The battery at Chickasaw Creek is being rapidly completed. Buoys for torpedoes, constructed in accordance with General Beauregard's plan, are commenced, and the torpedoes first sent have arrived. The reserve pontoon boats to be collected at Corinth will reach about as follows:

At Corinth or en route: Pontoon-boats.
