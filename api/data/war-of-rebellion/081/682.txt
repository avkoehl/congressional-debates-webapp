Colonel JACKSON,

Magnolia:

Be ready if the enemy leave your front and attack Baker to co-operate with him.

W. H. C. WHITING,

Major-General.

CHULA, June 22, 1864.

Honorable JAMES A. SEDDON:

Unless troops are sent to the protection of the railroad I consider it as completely at the mercy of the enemy. there will be some show of fight at ----, but with 300 men and such guns as are there it could only last a short time. At Flat Creek nothing of any moment has been done for its protection. At Staunton a few days since there were only 250 men, and they reserves, and six guns only carrying shot 1,000 yards, and the earth-works in a very incomplete state. Without aid from headquarters the probability is that transportation will cease over the road within twenty-four hours. it is for the authorities in Richmond to protect it; we cannot. I shall be in town to-night.

President Richmond and Danville Railroad.

Respectfully returned to honorable Secretary of War.

There are no troops except the army under General Lee and the reserves. The latter are all ordered out and General Lee is fully advised of the state of affairs as far as they are known here. I have having been made Generals Beauregard or Lee on the subject.

I regret to say that our last line has been cut so that we now have no communication whatever south of Petersburg.
