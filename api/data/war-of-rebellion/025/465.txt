Colonel Ingersoll has just come in. He thinks the rebels have gone to Columbus and then to cross over and destroy Rosecrans' line of railroad. They number at least 7,500 men. their intention was to destroy stores at Jackson, having been informed of our exact force by a Tennessee officer in United States forces. I am ordering my available force north and will try and have the road repaired in a week.
