duty to impress this upon you. General Williams is an intelligent and energetic officer, but he needs an immediate command.

Major-General.

RICHMOND, VA., September 22, 1863.

General SAM. JONES, Zollicoffer, Tenn.:

Your dispatch of yesterday received. I congratulate you on the success which has attended your efforts, and rely fully on your discretion to effect all which may be practicable. To meet your present want, General Ransom will be ordered to join you without delay. I have not seen him, b ut do not doubt his willingness to serve under you or any one else where he can promote our cause. can you not strengthen your cavalry force by drawing from Jenkins? Will send with this a copy of dispatch received this morning from General Bragg.*

JEFFERSON DAVIS.

RICHMOND, VA., September 23, 1863.

General SAM. JONES, Zollicoffer, Tenn.:

Your dispatch of yesterday received. Had previously answered, giving you the desired information, and notifying you of compliance with your request. General Bragg's success renders it improbable that a large force will be detached to operate against you at this time. Activity by your scouts can alone reliably assure you of any attempt by the enemy to get into your rear, as reported.

JEFFERSON DAVIS.

ABINGDON, September 24, 1863.

Colonel WILLIAM PRESTON JOHNSTON,

Aide-de-Camp to the President:

I have received intelligence, that I consider reliable, that three brigades of the Ninth U. S. Army Corps were moving in the direction of Cumberland Gap, and were at Cumberland Ford on the 18th instant. General De Courcy is at the gap with three regiments--two infantry and one cavalry. You are advised of the force in Major General Jones' front. No news from him to-day. I send this dispatch owing to the delay of sending through Major-General Jones. No telegraph below this point.

J. G. MARTIN,

Assistant Adjutant-General and Captain, Commanding Post.

RICHMOND, September 24, 1863.

General JAMES LONGSTREET,

Headquarters Army of Tennessee:

Saw the President. He is still opposed to Alexander's horses going. Thinks they will be of no service when they reach you. Says, if possible, horses must be obtained there. Finally, if absolutely necesary, he will order them sent by rail.

Awaiting your orders to join you,

J. B. WALTON,

Colonel and Chief of Artillery, Commanding.
