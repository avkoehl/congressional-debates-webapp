Brigadier-General MACKENZIE,

U. S. Volunteers:

GENERAL: In reply to your communication I have the honor to state, by direction of the major-general commanding, that as Brevet Brigadier-General Penrose has been assigned to duty by the President according to his brevet rank, and as he ranks both yourself and Brevet Brigadier-General Hamblin as colonel of volunteers and captain in the Regular Army, he is the ranking officer in the division at the present time, and as such will assume command of it during the temporary absence of Brevet Major-General Wheaton. The general is strongly of opinion that you rank Brevet Brigadier-General Penrose to the command of the First Brigade. He has never been relieved from its command, and consequently retains it, although with increased rank.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

C. H. WHITTELSEY,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
