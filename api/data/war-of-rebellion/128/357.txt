features of somewhat doubtful propriety, yet, having only recently been enacted and therefore but imperfectly tested, I do not feel altogether authorized to dispute its efficiency.

No effort of this office, in its operations heretofore, has been spared to guard the interests of the Confederate States, as well as those of the Indians, and it is sufficient to state in conclusion that for the future the same ends shall be had constantly in view.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. S. SCOTT,

Commissioned, &amp;c.

RESOLUTIONS.

Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the State of Georgia in General Assembly met, First. That the officers and soldiers from this State, upon whatsoever fields they have met out enemies, have, by their distinguished bravery and unflinching valor, conferred immortal honor upon themselves and enduring renown upon their State, and have truly illustrated the character of Georgia.

Second. That the thanks of the people of this State and the General Assembly are due, and are hereby tendered, to them for the promptitude with which they repaired to the defense of our Confederacy, for the unyielding fortitude with which they have borne the privations, toils, and fatigues incident to their service, and for the unsurpassed gallantry and courage displayed by them on every battle-field.

Third. That we deeply and sincerely lament the death of so many of our brave officers and men who yielded their lives in defense of their country on the field of battle, and this General Assembly does not hesitate to declare that when the proper time shall arrive the State should spare no expense to erect a suitable monument to perpetuate their names and gallant deeds.
