Aftei a lew remark  from Ml M A. COOPER,
Mr S MASON desired, he said to call the attention of the
House to the iact that abi 1 had been reported to abolish the
branch mints The salaries provi led for m the fpneralapp'i
pnation hill were alieatydur1 and the service had aheady
been tendered in part Lven supposing that the com mttee
weie di posed to abolish the minis, he thought they wou A al 0
De disposed iO make ippropnations lor salaries already due
and for set vices already rendered I was, imposible, there
fore, foi the fuendsoi ihe proposition to have, a test vole on this
motion Policy th«iefore, would dictate the piopnety eithei
of wtthdiawmg the motion or procf-e ling at once to vote undei
a belief and perfect assuiance (n hs mind) that this would
nst and could not be a test vote A bit!, he n peaied, had been
reponed to abolish these branch muns That bill would come
■up foraction This discussion theit- ote, was a rreie loss of
public time Tne debate would hivt- to be g ne over again, and
gentlemen would restate all that thev ha I said and a good deal
more
After a few remarks from Mr G DAViS, in vindication of hi=>
motion, and by Mr ¡sPRIGG  in oppo*i ion theie o

What furthet did Uotj do when die suits w^re brought against
hmYi He appointed his fi en 1 md 'ool, Mr Morrison, treasurer,
™ removed Mi Reed, he rt moved the gheuff of the county in
which the suit was biought, and api om ed the former partner
of his iniquity, Mr Bird, in his place These suits were stjU
pendí g, and should the Ten uory get judgment against him,
who was to execute it and collect the money? Why, the very
sheriff who was hepauner of his íniqniy and his subservient
tool But suppose, contrary to all prol>abihtyt he was to do his ^
duty, and collect the money win was he to deposit  it
with? Why, this vpty Mr Moruson Again, Doty em-
ployed ajawyei to defend him, and then the next thing he<did
was to remove the prosecuting attorne; and appoint this very

Treasurer, and his own lawyer Attorney General If such bold
