done was necessary now. In fact, some portion
of employment was greatly increased Ihe ab
Btruse mode of calculating uuues requited by the
compromise law was calculated sometimes, topuz-
zie even an expert accoun apt The genleman
from Ohio [Mr Vwu] Hid alluded to Insmnark
that the high tariíl of 1828 had incieased the pro
p nsity for smuggling i bia was notoriously the
fact,and r-ndered more offi->rs essential to the pi o-
tection of the revenue, and one of the most urfor
túnate consequences o( the system ot hi h duties
is, that when men uudei the temptation ot fifty per
cent nave been induced to smuggle, tne/ wnl not
leave it off when duties are reJuced to twenty-fiie
per cent It must also be remembered that the
trade of New Yoili na^ nearly doub'ed siiicl 1838
It had swal'owed up that ot maii/othei placs,
and it might be t,aid of almost oil other places ot
the United States 1 hat a laigemcieaseof officeis,
ut der these circumstances was necessary, was not
a matter of surpn e
Mi   BROWN said, the amendment offered by
the gentleman from 0 no [Mr  V\<ce] proposes
to stiKe fiom exi tence one uandied and twenty-
one of the office s employed in ti e collection of
the revenue ¡n the city of 1\ ew Yoi k    As one of I
the delegation ftom that S ate, he could not feel
indifferent to the fate of this extraordinaiy propo
sition, anu  unwil ing as lie was to occupy the
attention ot the House, he must be permitted to
make a few obsetvauotis upon the subject     Gen-
tlemen seem to aigae this, qaes ion as if the rev-
enue officers and the Government alone were in-
terested in its decision    He begged to correct this
impiession, if he was right in supposing such
existed in the minds of hororableuembeis  There
was another class whose interest;, might be preju-
diced by the event, that class was the merchant ,
those concerned in the vast cotinie'ce of the city,
which led them to tiansact business with the cus   |
torn house     What  inforn ution  is  th re  before ,
Congress that the officers employed in that brand  I
of the public service weie too rumeiojs?    Were
theie moie than tne public interest and convent
ence requned*    None whatevpi.sn      The fa<Us
communicated  by the  gentleman  from Geoigia
[Mi   Clayton] do not touch the question     He
would, at a pioper time, and upon a proper occa-
sion, go with gentlemen in any reasonable effoit
to reduce the number of revenue officers, or the
salaries of revenue officers, whenever such leduc-
tion can be made without mjui y to the public ser-
vice, or diminishing the lacihties for the tiansaction
of commercial business     What particular leason
exists for the application of this proposition to the
city of New Yoik alone, the House 1 ad not been
informed, noi could he conjecture      Gentlemen
weie sometimes mcl ned to find fault with itfew
York politics, and New Yoik influence, but he
hardly expected, wmle the genetpl pppropnatioi
bill was under consideiation, thet the namuer of
hei citizens engaged in the cc'lection of the rev-
enue should be made the special subject of ani-
madversion    New York has much to be p oud of
besides her wel1 spread commerce, which it mignt
not become hei Repfsentativesto enumerate here
And she had as little to fear from the most seaieh-
mg sciunny into hei poli ical affairs on any other
branch of her public concerns, as any other por-
tion of the Union      He hoped gent'emen might
have an opportunity to see hei as she really was,
and when they feU inclined to speak of the num-
ber of ofiiveis employed within her limits m tne
preservation  and  collection   of the  íevenue, ne
begged they would not foiget her commeice, and
the vast amount of revenue she brougru yearly
into the puolio Treasury
The gentleman ficm Connecticut [Mi Hunt-
inotom] seemed to think that tie extent of sei-
vict. íende ed in ciirying into effect the revenue
hws and the collection of the impost dutie , de-
pended upon the amount realised by the Govern-
ment, and that the operation of the last tariff law
has taken away the neces >ty fot the same num-
ber of custom house officers This opinion, he
apprehended, was not tiue, to tie extent which
the gentleman seemed to suppose, and the obser-
vations of his colleague [Mr Cwbueleso] weie
so full at d -atisfacloiy, that he wou'd not trouble
the House further with that bianch of th° subject
Al 1 o Hi, is i gent ml ink, he v. is opposed to lcgis
la mg upo i offices or salan s in an appropi ation
bill, further than to provide means for the pay-
ment of those already cieated, still, rather than
leave collectors, surveyors, and naval officers with-
out an adequate compensation, he would so far
depart from this ru'e as to \ote for the amendment
making provision for that purpose
Mr PEARCE, of Rnode Island, spoke in oppo
sition to the motion, and in reply to Messrs
Vance ard Clayton
Mt VANCE said, as the House was impatient
for the question, and as the gentleman fiom New
York [Mr Ca iiiRELEMjJdidnot wish his amend
mem to be eneumbeied, he would withuiaw his
motion
Mr FILLMORE being solicitous, as he said,
that this amendment should not be consideied as
inconsistent with the clause adopted on motion of
the membei from Ohio, [Mr  Vance,] moved to
amend the amendment by adding to it the pro-
vision's, that in no ct se shoulJ the co npensation of j
a colleaoi exceed tl ree thousand dollars, nor that I
of the surveyor and naval officers twenty-five hun-
dred dolíais each
1     Mr. SUTHERLAND accepted the amendment
I as a modification, in ordei to prevent fuithei delay,
declaung, at the same time, that he was opposed
to thei eduction of the emoluments of those officeis
Af-er some lemaiks from Mr  CLAYTON, in
which he opposed the amendment on the ground
j that the whole subject of satanes was before the |
I Committee on Retrenchment,
|     Mr HUNTiNuION called for the yeas and
nays on the-question, and they were ordered
|     The question b mg taken, it was decided in the
