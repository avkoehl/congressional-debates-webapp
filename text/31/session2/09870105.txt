APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

31st Cong 2d Sess.
Cession of the Public Lands—Mr. Felch.
Senate.
Minnesota, now just opening for settlement, and |
where scarcely an acre has been sold, 53,120,000
acres, $11,636,400.
These are sufficient as examples, merely to pre-
sent an exhibition of the effect of the principle.
It is true the bill proposes to require each grantee j
to pay for title deeds, &e., a sum not exceeding
live dollars; but this sum, disproportionate as it is
to the cost of the land, is paid to the State, and not
to the United States. The former is to pay to the
latter only the cost of transcribing the records,
with no compensation for previous costs and ex-
penditures.
I have thus, Mr. President, endeavored to show,
so far as official data would enable me, both the
cost of the public domain in the aggregate to the
Government, and the expense of the disposal of
that domain in the manner under consideration.
Whatever our own views may be in regard to
the propriety or impropriety of the measure, I
hold we all are bound to examine the question in
detail and with figures. Let us know how far we
are to go. I am disposed to be as liberal as any
man can consistently be in regard to this great
subject: but I desire to know the truth and ex-
amine the facts, for the purpose of ascertaining
the result to which our action must lead.
There is another consideration connected with
the financial part of this subject to which 1 must
not omit to refer. I allude to the relation which
the public domain bears at the present time to the
debt of the United States. The proceeds of the
sales of the public lands are all specifically pledged
for the redemption and payment of the United
States stock, issued by virtue of an act approved
January 28, 1847. According to official state-
ments, the amount still outstanding and unpaid,
and for which the proceeds of the public domain j
are thus pledged, was on the 6th of June last
$27,935,350. The annual interest on this sum is
$1,736,121. This is just about equal to the amount
of cash receipts from the annual sales of public
lands for the last two or three years.
During these years the receipts have been less
than usual; but under the present system the an-
nual sales can safely be relied upon for sufficient,
at least, to cancel the interest on this debt.
It is for gentlemen to consider how far it is con-
sistent with the obligations of this pledge thus to
•disoose by a single act of the public domain.
The ordinary mannerof sale, and the well-settled
custom of liberal grants for objects heretofore
recognized in the practice of the Government,
are not at variance with the spirit of the pledge;
but action which proposes to abandon the right of
the other party, and to transfer the property to
another, needs to be scrutinized. It may be «itd
probably is true that the pledging party being the
Government itself, no legal remedy exists to enforce
such a pledge; it may be and certainly is true that
the prompt payment of all the obligations of the
Government is beyond a contingency: still, the
public faiih once plighted can never be withdrawn
without the consent of all interested in the matter.
If the legal remedies afforded in transactions of the
same character between individuals are wanting,
so much the more should the most scrupulous
good faith be kept—so much the more carefully
should we abstain from every act which can suffer
a suspicion of disregard to the rights and interests
of the creditor. Wfhout his consent to depart
from the ordinary manner of administering the
property thus pledged, we are bound to make no
important change, and least of all, disregarding his
rights and our own honor, to transfer it to another.
Mr. President, I have referred as far as I desired
to the financial part of this subject. But perhaps
I shall be told that, under the present aspect of
things,all this is an idle and a profitless speculation.
It has become customary, here and elsewhere,
to assert that the public domain is already dissipa-
ted, and that we can in future hope for nothing
from this as a source of revenue; that by our own
acts the fountain is dried up, and will never again
yield its accustomed supply. These assertions
have been so often and so confidently made, that
their influence begins to be felt on our action here.
In the report of the Secretary of the Treasury,
presented a few days since, it is asserted that
"over sixteen years will be required to absorb and
satisfy the warrants yet to be issued, as estimated
under the several bounty land acts now in force,"
and that the sales of land "should not hereafter be
relied upon with any certainty, or to any consid-
erable extent, in estimating tne receipts into the
Treasury." The honorable Senator from Mis-
souri [Mr. Benton] stated a few days since, in
his place here, not only that we could not rely
upon this as a source of income for the future, but
that the cost of administering the land system
would not be remunerated by the sales. This
cost, in his opinion, to the amount of some $700,000
annually, would be a burden unremunerated by
any corresponding income upon the Treasury.
Now, I have looked carefully over the state-
ments presented by the Secretary of the Treas-
ury, from which he is led to the conclusion I have
stated. _
Annexed to his report is a table exhibiting the
estimated number of acres granted by acts of Con-
gress, yet to be located on the public domain, and
which, in his opinion, will take the place of sales
for cash for the next sixteen years.
The exhibit is as follows:
■Acres.
I Act of September 4, 1841  977,724
Mexican war bonnties  6,036,960
Internal improvements  66,486
War of 1812  30,086
Bounties, nctof September 28, 1850.. 48,000,000
Swamplands  20,785,327
Railroad from Chicago to Mobile.... 3,025,920
j 78,932,513
, It will be seen at a glance that the two principal
I items in this table, which peculiarly distinguish it,
and which swell the amount of outstanding and
unlocated grants beyond those of former periods,
I are the bounties under the act of September last,
' and the grant of swamplands to the States. These
! amount to a fraction less than sixty-nine millions
' of acres, while the aggregate of all the other items
is only a fraction over ten millions.
| The swamp lands ceded to the States comprise
only such as are officially reported to beoverflowed
■ and unfit for cultivation. They were ceded for
j the reason that from their quality and location
i they could not command a sale. Gradual settle-
! ments around them, ditching and embankments,
and other means of reclamation, will gradually
! bring many of them into market at reduced prices;
but it seems to me absurd to suppose they are to
be taken instead of Government lands for new
farms, and compete at once with tlie Government
sales. On the contrary, a large portion of them
will never be fit for that purpose, and the gradual
absorption of those which will eventually find
purchasers will scarcely have an appreciable in-
fluence. The same remark will apply, to a con-
siderable extent, to the 3,025,920 acres granted for
the Chicago and Mobile railroad.
The bounties for soldiers under the act of 28th
September last, estimated at 48,000,000 acres, de-
serves a more extended consideration.
From examination of documents, and informa-
tion obtained at the Adjutant General's Office prin-
cipally, and from the Pension Office, I have pre-
pared a table, which I will read for the purpose
of showing the probable quantity of land which
will be required to fulfill the terms of the law, and
how greatly, in my opinion, that quantity has
been over-estimated:
Military and volunteers in the
last war with Great Britain,
(1812) 
Seminole war, (1817 & 1818).
Black Hawk war, (1832) —

turbances, (1836)

This statement is believed to embrace all who
can by possibility come within the law.
In order to ascertain the quantity of land re-
quired tinder the law, we must determine, first, the
number of beneficiaries who may be entitled to the
benefit of the provisions; and, secondly, the num-
ber in the several classes entitled, respectively, to
one hundred and sixty, eighty, and forty acres, or
the average quantity of all.
The militia and volunteers in the war of 1812
constitute by far the largest class in the above
table, amounting to more than five sixths of the
whole number.
Fortunately we are not without authentic
sources of information in regard to the services of
this large class. An official and detailed report
on this subject wiH be found in House document
No. 20, 2a session 24th Congress. This docu-
ment I have examined with care, and have caused
the several classes to be ascertained therefrom, and
the quantity of land to which they would be en-
titled under the law, according to the length of
sen-ice. I find that the whole number mustered
into service in that war was 471,622. Of these,
I 145,447 served less than one month, and arethere-
j fore not entitled by the law to bounty. Of the
| remainder, only 9,431 served nine months and
; over. That number, then, only would be entitled
i to one hundred and sixty acres of land each, giving
1 1,508,960 acres to all. Of those who served four
months, and less than nine, there were 97,278,
and who, being entitled to eighty acres each, would
I receive, in all, 7,782,240 acres. The number who
j served one month, and less than four months, was
219,466, and were entitled to forty acres each, and
an aggregate of 8,778,640 acres. The whole num-
ber of acres thus required for all would be
j 18,069,840. This is an average to each man en-
titled to land of fifty-five acres.
Thus far, and in relation to five sixths of the
whole number of beneficiaries, we have accurate
: data. The same ratio applied to those on the list
I engaged in other service would not vary far from
| a true result. In regard to most of the others also,
\ we have official information, not so definite as the
! above, but sufficiently accurate for practical pur-
' poses. Thus, of the soldiers in the Seminole war
: of 1817 and 1818, it appears by a report in the
American State Papers, (Military Affairs, vol. 2,p.
' 104,) that part were Indians, part would be eati-
tied to no bounty land, and that most of them
; served less than four months. In House docu-
ment No. 271, Twenty-fifth Congress, second ses-
sion, returns are made of service in the Black
; Hawk and Florida wars, and the disturbances
! among the Creeks in 1836, on the southwestern
i frontier in 1836, and in the Cherokee country in
1836 and 1837. These returns show the service
to have been from three to six months.
( We cunnot, I apprehend, be far from the truth
if we suppose the ratio of fifty-five acres on an
( average to each man, found to be correct in the
volunteer and militia service of 1812, to apply to
the service in all the wars embraced by the terms
| of the act.
I Applying this average to the whole list in the
| table, we find that the whole number of men en-
gaged in all the wars enumerated was, as I have
stated, 559,203; from which number we are to
| deduct 145,447, who are not entitled to bounty
. land; and the remainder, or 413,756 men, being
entitled to fifty-five acres each, would require 22,-
756,580 acres of land.
But this calculation is based on the supposition
that all whose services might entitle them to the
land are yet alive to receive it at the hands of the
1 Government. We must remember that -some
' thirty-five years have elapsed since the close of the
I last war with Great Britain, and some fifty-five years
1 since Wayne's expedition. The soldiers of the
former could not now be less than sixty, nor of the
latter less than about eighty years of age. The cas-
■ ualities of the service, and the great length of time
since elapsed, have left but a small remnant alive
to enjoy the bounty, and their widows and minor
' heirs entitled to it are few. The proportion of all
mustered into service, who will claim and receive
; their land, has been variously estimated from one
fourth to one half of the original number. If one
' half of these men apply for their land, they would
receive 11,378,290 acres; but if only one fourth
, are living to receive it, then only 5,689,145 acres
