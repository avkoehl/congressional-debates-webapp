HEADQUARTERS LEFT WING,Savannah, Ga., January 25, 1865.

Major-General SHERMAN,

Commanding Military Division of the Mississippi:

DEAR GENERAL: Your letter of yesterday has just come to hand. I ordered Davis yesterday to resume his march this morning at daylight, and directed Williams to push a division, if possible, from Purysburg toward the ferry. These orders are now being executed. Davis had gone with Morgan's division. I shall order Geary forward to-morrow, and shall advise Corse to move at the same time on one of the other roads. I shall send my headquarters teams with Geary division and go up the river on one of the transports. This will give me an opportunity to stop at Purysburg and give whatever new orders may be necessary; also to see the gun-boat and send it above the ferry. I shall probably arrive as Sister's ferry as soon as the head of Davis' column can reach there. I shall hear from Davis this evening as to the progress made to-day, and will write you again before leaving here.

Very respectfully, &amp;c.,

H. W. SLOCUM,

Major-General.
