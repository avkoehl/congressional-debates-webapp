HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND, McDonald's, September 20, 1863-6.35 a.m.

Major-General McCOOK,Commanding Twentieth Army Corps;

General Negley's division has been ordered to General Thomas' left. The general commanding directs you to fill the space left vacant by his removal, if practicable. The enemy appears to be moving toward our left.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. A. GARFIELD,

Brigadier-General, Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND, In the Field, September 20, 1863-10.10 a.m.

Major-General McCOOK,Commanding Twentieth Army Corps:

General Thomas is being heavily pressed on the left. The general commanding directs you to make immediate dispositions to withdraw the right, so as to spare as much force as possible to re-enforce Thomas. The left must be held at all hazards, even if the right is drawn wholly back to the present left. Select a good position back this way, and be ready to start re-enforcements to Thomas at a moment's warning.

J. A. GARFIELD,

Brigadier-General, Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND, In the Field, September 20, 1863-10.30 a.m.

Major-General McCOOK,Commanding Twentieth Army Corps:

The general commanding directs you to send two brigades [of] General Sheridan's division at once, and with all dispatch, to support General Thomas, and send the third brigade as soon as the lines can be drawn in sufficiently. March them as rapidly as you can without exhausting the men. Report in person to these headquarters as soon as your orders are given in regard to Sheridan's movement. Have you any news from Colonel Post?

J. A. GARFIELD,

Brigadier-General, Chief of Staff.

LOUISVILLE, KY., February 18, 1864.

On the 28th of September last, an order was issued consolidating with another the Twentieth Army Corps, which it had been my highest honor to command. The order was announced to the army on the 8th of October. I was relieved from command, and have been ever since awaiting the pleasure of the President for the investigation which has just closed.
