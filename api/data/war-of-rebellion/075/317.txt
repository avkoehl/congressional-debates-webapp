Williams moved over yesterday across the upper bridge. General Palmer will send Johnson's division to the field hospital at the forks of the road that Butterfield marched in by.

GEO. H. THOMAS.

If Davis succeeds in getting into Dallas, headquarters train had better move up by that road.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, May 26, 1864.

General HOOKER:

I find a perfect string of men going back for rations. If you are out of rations, which should not be, as the orders are that men shall keep at all times three days' rations in their haversacks, I will order up wagons. I don't wan any more men to the rear. I will turn everybody back. This is an order and is peremptory. Officers can send servants, but if you want wagons let each regiment bring up a wagon. Schofield is now advancing by the left, and McPherson by the right. Be ready for battle.

Yours,

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS THIRD DIVISION, TWENTIETH CORPS,May 26, 1864.

Major-General HOOKER:

GENERAL: Movements of the enemy to his left (our right) are reported to me. General Ward thinks his skirmishers have killed the horses attached to two guns in his front so that the enemy cannot move them. The forces of the enemy are not stated moving, as they are only seen through a small opening. Wood's rations just arrived; as soon as he gets breakfast I am all ready to move. I should like to move by myself, not mixed up with Second Division.

Very respectfully,

DANL. BUTTERFIELD,

Major-General.
HDQRS. THIRD DIVISION, TWENTIETH ARMY CORPS,May 26, 1864.

Lieutenant-Colonel PERKINS,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Twentieth Corps:

COLONEL: From all indications on the enemy's line last night, which have been reported to me, I am led to believe that there was a very considerable movement of the enemy to his left (our right). Movements of trains, or artillery, yelling to animals were plainly heard, and the sounds moving to our right. Orders to advance, pistol-shots, as if to drive up or stop deserters, are reported. The enemy are constructing an earth-work, and strengthening their line in front of Coburn's. A good position for a battery is reported near the right of our line.

Very respectfully,

DANL. BUTTERFIELD,

Major-General.
