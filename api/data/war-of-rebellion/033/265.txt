HDQRS. FIFTH CAVALRY, MISSOURI STATE MILITIA,Independence, Mo., May 1, 1863

Major General JAMES G. BLUNT,

Leavenworth, Kans.:

GENERAL: Quantrill, Parker, and company are undoubtedly here or in Cass County with a force of from 150 to 300 men, and contemplate attacking one of our posts. Kansas City, Independence, and Blue Springs can take care of themselves, but I will be very uneasy about Harrisville. As soon as the first cavalry leaves, you can send me four companies of infantry to hold the posts. I will see that my [men] hunt them up immediately. One hundred of my cavalry have hunted for them three days this week, but without success. We are busy to-day destroying the skiffs, &amp;c., on the river, to keep those on the north side where they are. Telegraph if you can furnish the men desired. If you cannot, Colonel Chester Harding will probably do so. He kindly offered me two companies of cavalry not long since. I would suggest that you make a station at Pink Hill and one at Pleasant Hill as soon as convenient.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. R. PENICK,

Colonel Fifth Missouri State Militia Cavalry.
