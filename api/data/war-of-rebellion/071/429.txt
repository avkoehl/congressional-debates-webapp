(Received 8. 45 p. m.)

Honorable EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

The operator at Martinsburg says it is reported by the officers and men from the front that Crook has met with a disaster. Rumor says one of his brigades captured. Officers also report General Grant in Richmond, and whole rebel army moving down the Shenandoah Valley. I will telegraph again when I get more reliable information.

D. HUNTER,

Major-General.

Major-General HUNTER,

Harper's Ferry:

We have dispatches from General Grant's headquarters this afternoon. He is not in Richmond, and he gives no intimation that the rebel army is moving down the Valley of the Shenandoah. Where was General Crook when you last heard from him, and in what direction was he operating?

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

Following just received from one of my aides at Martinsburg:

The Second Brigade of cavalry has stampeded. I shall do all I can to check it. I have no official information from the front. All agree in saying that the rebel cavalry flanked our position. Will send you all the news I get.

Honorable EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

General Crook was at Winchester and operating south of that place. Have just received the following from my aide at Martinsburg:

The stampede occurred by the rebel cavalry flanking our position by way of Operquaon. Things are much stiller. I shall do my best to collect and arrange the force. The Second Brigade of cavalry is all that is in yet. I am awaiting official news from General Crook.

D. HUNTER,

Major-General.
