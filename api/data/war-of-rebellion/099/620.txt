road here is not ready for me I will push though and unite with Cox, unless I learn that Sherman is coming this way to get supplies here. His instructions to Colonel Wright were to have the road to Goldsborough ready for him by the 15th of March. That I think we can make, and will do more if possible. I hope when General Sherman hears I have Wilmington he will come in as far as Fayetteville. Then we will be all right, and can unite whenever we please. The cavalry has begun to arrive. A regiment will do very well for the present.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.

GENERAL: I am sorry for our detention in getting started, but it was unavoidable. McQuiston's brigade did not get off united to-day, but do not wait for it. Time is very important. General Grant is very much disappointed at Palmer's tardiness. He was expected to have Kinston by the time we got Wilmington. I rely upon you to regain what has been lost. Let nothing detain you.

Yours, truly,

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.
