Major-General HANCOCK:

Major-General Burnside's corps is at this place-New Bethel Chruch. He is directed to send out his cavalry and open communication with you, and should you require support you may call upon him. General Warren will be at Harris' Store with similar orders; is probably there by this time. Headquarters are near New Bethel Church. The order to General Torbert to move to this place, leaving 500 men with you, is rescinded. He is directed to remain where he is. Wright is 4 miles in rear of Warren at Madison's Ordinary and Nancy Wright's.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.

HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS, May 22, 1864-5.30 p. m.

Major-General HANCOCK:

I send my escort through to communicate with you. Lieutenant Wheeler will tell you everything. I believe the enemy is all gone to Hanover Junction. We picked up about 50 stragglers from Ewell and Longstreet, and had to brush away a small flank force of cavalry.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General, Commanding Fifth Army Corps.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND DIVISION, May 22, 1864-12.30 p. m.

Major-General HANCOCK:

GENERAL: I strongly suspect that the line of battle, reported by Captain Butterfield, was General Birney's reconnoitering party. Colonel Smyth is pushing his skirmishers out on the Junction road, and I will hear shortly.

Respectfully,JOHN GIBBON,

Brigadier-General.

Colonel Smyth has just sent me word there is no enemy in that position but a few cavalry. His skirmishers are about 2 miles from the tavern. Do you wish him to advance any farther, remain where he is, or return?

J. G.
