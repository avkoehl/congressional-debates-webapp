THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
April 1,
ever became fit for beef; so from analogy wc may
infer that Pollock, though he directs and controls
a factory which he regards* as embodying all the
am ibutesof national sovereignty, will haidiy ever
attain a condition qualifying him for the proper
exercise of those high functions.
When my colleagues and myself went before
the Committee on Finance to urge upon them the
propriety of this measure, we found ourselves
laboring under some embarrassment in the pro-
duction of conclusive evidence in relation to the
quantity of gold being produced and likely to be
pioduced in the region of country to be accom-
modated by the proposed branch mint.
Owing to the gieat distant;*' that we are sepa-
rated from our constituents, the delays, difficul-
ties, and uncertainties of communication with
them, and in part to their own carelessness and
neglect to forward the necessary data upon which
to predicate our statements, wc were only able to
furnish an approximate estimate of the results of
their industr y in mining pmsuits during the last
year. With a consciousness that we were withtn
hounds we stated that our exportation^ of gold
for the last yeai amounted to more than an avei-
age of one million dollars per month. When
called upon by the honorable chairman of the
commit lee to an bnti f on r view in w i it ing, we of-
feied the following communication:

Oms k-- a prownig State. Capital is finding many new
avonnes of employment and investment, and even as far
back as 18t50, wben our mmmginterest was in us infancy,
the city of Portland wa«, in proportion to tbe number of its
inhabitants, the wealtluestcity m the Union. So the cen-
sus of that \ear will verify. We might give many items
showing th.it tbe mines tiibutary to tiie proposed branch
mint are very pioduotive, but we refer to only one,and that
only becau-e it came dneetly to the knowledge of one of
the undersigned. That was an instance where three men
m si x week*5 time, with their own hands, dugout >'180,000.
Thet-c instances are not common, we admit, but they serve
to show tbe exeoodmg riches ot some pottions of this north-
ern legion, and indicate the wealth which iuiu>t soon tlioie
bo developed. For the pnrpo-o of stimulating this devel-
opment by providing the miner with a place lor the a--say
of hi* gold without the loss ot time, the iu>k ot transmis-
sion by isoa to San Franci-eo, and the payment of cxpiet-s-
age and in-tnaneo fee*, and to prevent the swindling dealer
in coin from lobbing the mirier of Ins tail" earnings by his
unpa-l discount, which many prefer to submit to lather
than tho in< onvonx nco ju-t alluded to, we ask you to
favoubi) eon&idei the proposition.

Fargo & Co. All of these fifteen persons our informant,
who came down m the Chief, fravvandconversed with. lie
also learned that nearly all the passengers hud plenty of

came down on the Chief last evening.—Dalles Journal.
From our own personal -knowledge of that
country, and our acquaintance with gentlemen
making these and similar statements, we are sat-
isfied of their reliability.
The region of country which will be accommo-
datedby theestablishmentofthe proposed branch
mint extends from the forty-second to the forty-
ninth parallels of latitude, and from the Pacific
ocean to the Itocky mountains, embracing an area
about eight times the size of the great State ofNew
York, or about six times as large as the New Eng-
land States. Throughout the^ength and breadth
of this vast region, with the exception of but a
few localities, both gold and silver abound in in-
exhaustible quantities. But a few short years
since I saw it an uninhabited wilderness, except
that poition occupied by the Indians, much of it
apparently sterile and unproductive, and, as was
then thought by many, perfectly valueless. To-
day it contains two hundred thousand busy, en-
terprising, industrious, and intelligent people,
forming a nucleus around which millions will
be found within a few brief years. During the
last year its scattered and meager population,
with but few conveniences or facilities, and with
rude appliances, produced $15,000,000 in gold.
This year that product will be more than trebled,
and that ratio of production will continue in the
proportion that an industrious and cneigetic pop-
ulation is supplied from the older Stal< s and from
foreign countries, until the production of the pre-
cious metals of that aunferous region will amount
to $1,000,000,0U0 per annum. Who, sir, would
have had the temerity a few short years since to
have predicted the vast revolution to be wiought
in commerce, industry, national prosperity, and
general cntei prise by the discovery of gold upon
the Pacific slope ?
One morning in the year 1848, Bennett and Mar-
shall, two individuals unknown to fame, picked
up .some pieces of yellow substance in Captain
Sutler's mill-race, on the American river, near
Coloma, California. Those men, quite as uncon-
scious of the magnificent results to How from their
discovery as was Columbus when he first beheld
the glowing light upon the shore of America, held
in their hands the germ that was to give a new
impetus to the progress of the world. What has
resulted from the discovery made by those two
almost unknown men, though it has astonished
and filled mankind with amazement, is but the
precursor of what is to follow when the vast min-
ing regions of Oregon, Washington, and Idaho
have their mining resouicesmore fully developed.
As vet nothing has been accomplished upon the
Pacific coast but a mere scratching of the surface.
With machinery, capital,systematized laboi ,and
good roads affording facilities for mgr* ss and
egress, and the cheaper transportation'of neces-
sary supplies, the production of gold and silver
will he increased a thousand-fold, and the nation
will have in its own public domain, so ueh in
precious motels, resources ample for the liquida-
tion of our public debt, even if we should be com-
pelled to battle with treason and secession for
another generation to come.
It docs seem to me, Mr. President, that the
Government, instead of pursuing a niggardly
policy toward the hardy pioneers engaged in de-
veloping the region to which 1 have referred,
should extend toward them all reasonable facili-
ties for the successful promotion of an enterprise
so fiaught with the present and prospectse inter-
ests of the nation.
The woild chang< s, and he who attempts to
oppose its mutations in place of accommodating
himself to them can lay no claims to statesman-
ship. When the Alleghanies were the western
limit of the Union, and our annual go 1(1 production
and coinage were about two hundied and thirty-
thtee thousand dollars, a^ they w<ue on an aver-
age for the twenty-four yi*Mj> from 1793 to 1S17,
theii, when Pi'i'sub nts, C.'biucts, n.nci members of
Congress, together with the more r< spectable por-
tions of mankind, iefused to send messages by
