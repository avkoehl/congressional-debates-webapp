as suggested in my former communication on that subject. A large cavalry force cannot subsist in the Kanawha, and I cannot believe anything more than a raid would be attempted, during the winter, at least. To be exceedingly watchful, keeping scouts everywhere in front and flanks, and prepared to concentrate at Gauley, seems to me the true course. For this reason, industry should be used in making that position defensible, as before suggested.

I fear we cannot calculate upon much aid, for there is nothing within reach, and the removal of Crook in the face of reports heretofore made by me shows that the necessity elsewhere must be great. To do the very best thing possible with the means we have is not our duty.

Let me know your views as to the use of your force, if left for a time without help.

Your dispatch will be forwarded to General Wright.
