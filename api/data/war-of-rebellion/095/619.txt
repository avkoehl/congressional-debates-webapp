The division hospital was located near the division in a central and convenient position. It was formed of hospital tents, had beds for 120 patients, with a surgeon in charge, three assistant medical officers, two hospital stewards, and twenty seven attendants. The total number of medical officers present for duty on January 1 was twenty-six. Absent with leave, two; absent sick, three. The ambulance corps was in charge of Lieutenant John R. West, Sixteenth Pennsylvania Cavalry, division ambulance officer, There were two brigade officers only, a vacancy existing in the Second Brigade. There was a full complement of men, wagons, and ambulances. The ambulances were not very good ones, being mostly old, but in good repair and serviceable. On January 24, by permission of the acting medical director of the army, I issued a circular directing the surgeons-in-chief to turn over the medical property in the ambulances to the surgeon in charge of hospital and placing upon him the responsibility of keeping the boxes filled. I did this because the ambulance property is used exclusively in the field hospitals over which the surgeons-in-chief of brigades have no control, and confusion of accounts often arises from the fact of several officers being responsible for property in the same hospital. The division was camped on the Jerusalem plank road beyond the rear line of earth-works and near the crossing of the Blackwater. The situation of all the camps was good. They were well laid out, with excellent huts for the troops, and all proper sanitary regulations generally observed. During the month the division remained in camp, having merely the ordinary picket duty to perform, and there was no general movement of any kind. The condition of the camps continued good, weekly inspections being made by a medical officer in each brigade. The issue of fresh vegetables during the month was very scant, but still no signs of a scorbutic condition were observed. The health of the command was remarkably good, as the troops were well sheltered, had abundant food, and were well clothed. There were some obstinate and serious cases of chronic diarrhea, a few severe cases of fever, but not as many cases of diseases of the respiratory organs as might have been anticipated from the frequent rain-storms and the extreme and rapid variations of the temperature.
