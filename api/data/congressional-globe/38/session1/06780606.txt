THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
February 12,
. Mr. Chairman, I wish to call the attention of
gentlemen on the other side of the House to this
fact, that the amendment which is now proposed
is unlike any that has been offered to it. It is
proposed to persist in the draft, and yet offers to
us on this side of the House a chance for larger
experiment by means of bounty to reach the ob-
ject of filling our armies.
Mr. Chairman, I am opposed to the system
.of draft so long as we can resort to volunteers,
upon this ground, that the Government for all
other purposes, when it employs men in the navy-
yards, when it provides for laborelsewhere, goes
into the market and competes with others by
paying a higher price. There is no reason why
the Government, when it needs the service of
soldiers, should force that service more than there
is when it needs the service of men to work in its
ship-yards, that it should draft them and compel
them to work at such prices as the Government
chooses to offer.
We all know that the circumstances of the coun-
try have changed materially within the last two
years, that labor which a few years ago could be
had for from fifteen to thirty dollars a month has
gone up to $100. 1 insist, when the Government
desires the labor of any man worth now $100 a
month, that it should pay that man accordingly.
You allow the additional value of labor to enter
when you make iron-Clad ships. If the Gov-
ernment says that it cannot compete with these
prices, why not do then as in the case of the sol-
dier? Why not draft the laborers? Why not,
when you want clothing for the Army or Navy,
seize upon it and say that wc will give so much
and so much only? Why, when the Government
wants anything else, should it not seize upon
it and condemn it at the price it can afford to
give ?
â€¢ I insist that the soldier is as much entitled to
fair compensation under the piesenl circumstan-
ces, under the changes caused by depreciation uf
our currency, as any other individual. 1 ask
any gentleman whether tin4 Government can go
into the market, take whatever it wants, and fix
a price upon it? The whole principle is wrong.
We should pay the soldier enough to go into the
service, enough to induce him to enlist. If you
want to carry*but the old feudal system, that the
Government has the right to call upon the service
of those under it, then you leverse our system.
[Ilere the hammer foil.]
Mr. GARFIELD. I am opposed to the amend-
ment.
Mr. HARRINGTON. I move to amend the
amendment by inserting the woid " white" be-
fore the word "volunteers," I do not wish to
consume the time of the House in discussing this
question, but I will say that I understand the con-
script act has already provided both for colored
conscripts and other acts foi negio volunteers.
Under the former act there are some Statca that
must furnish' to the Aimy white .soldiers whose
blood is to be put into the balance as nguinst Afri-
cans, or negroes furnished by other Slates. It
seems to me that when you take a white man who
can readily become an efficient soldier injhe Army
of theUnited States*.and place bun in those {States
that prohibit by legislative enactment or organic
law the immigration of negroes into their borders
upon an equality with a negiowho may be found
in other States not only as n (itizen ftee to em-
igrate there, but as an elector in such States, you
do an act of injustice.
It seems to me further, that when you take a
slave, unacquainted with those impulses of free-
dom, and those asphations which induce one to
take up arms in defense of liberty and free insti-
tutions, and place him in a scale against a white
man of the Anglo-Saxon or any other race you
commit an unjust and humiliating net. I insist,
therefore, that so far as this pro"v ision in reference
to bounty is concerned, it should be limited to
white men who have enjoyed and who know the
benefits of freedom, and that such men shall not
be weighed in the scale against those who have
not known and who cannot appreciate the benefits
of free institutions. I know that gentlemen on
the other side say that the African race have
proved themselves chivalrous and gallant, but I
say that those who say this intend to deceive the
people.
[Here the hammer fell.]
Mr. DA VIS, of Maryland. Iam opposed to
the amendment, and I will say I am sorry he
should cxcludc the Celtic race.
Theamendment to the amendment was rejected.
The amendment was not agreed to.
Mr. SCHENCK. I move that the committee
rise and report the bill to the House with the
amendments.
The motion was agreed to.
So the committee rose; and the Speaker having
resumed the chair, Mr. Fenton reported that the

had, according to order, had the Union generally
under consideration, and particularly the bill of
the Senate (No. 36) to amend an act entitled "An
actforewrollingand calling outthe national forces,
and for other purposes," approved March 3,1863,
and had directed him to report the same to the
House with sundry amendments.
Mr. SCHENClt. 1 now propose to modify
the substitute offered by the Committee on Mil-
itaiy Affairs of the House, and offer it as a sub-
stitute for the bill and amendments just reported
from the Committee of the Whole on the state
of the Union. I propose to keep the floor upon
that motion, but will ask the House to agree that
all the amendments which have been made by the
Committee of the Whole on the state of the Union
shall be printed, and also the substitute offered
by the Committee on Military Affairs.
Mr. COX. We have no objection to that.
