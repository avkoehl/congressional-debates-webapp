over parties in a few days to collect supplies and bring them on this side the river.

I have received all the general's notes up to the 4th, and have replied to all interrogations addressed to me.

HEADQUARTERS TRANS-MISSISSIPPI DEPARTMENT,Shreveport, La., June 6, 1863.

Lieutenant General J. C. PEMBERTON,

Commanding, & c., Jackson, Miss.:

GENERAL: I have ordered Captain [F.] Ducayet, inspector of field transportation, and Lieutenant Edward Cunningham, one of my aides, to proceed to the east of the Mississippi, for the purpose of collecting and forwarding to this point all stores of every description that may be en route for this department. As these stores are much needed, may I request that you will give such orders as may be deemed necessary to further these officers in the fulfillment of the duties with which they are charged?

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

E. KIRBY SMITH,

Lieutenant-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS TRANS-MISSISSIPPI DEPARTMENT,Shreveport, La., June 6, 1863.

Lieutenant General J. C. PEMBERTON,

Commanding Vicksburg, Miss.:

GENERAL: The vital importance of obtaining the ordnance and ordnance stores sent for this department makes it imperative on me to use every effort in having them forwarded across the river. Believing that they may now be crossed at Vicksburg, I have directed Colonel Brown, chief of artillery and ordnance of this department, to send an officer to that point, to use every means to place them over the river. The isolated position of this department, with its communication liable to be interrupted or entirely suspended at any moment, causes me to feel very anxious about the reception of these much-needed stores. A portion of my command is unarmed, including some old regiments, and the ten thousand stand of small-arms and accouterments are especially needed, whilst the rest of the stores are scarcely less so. Therefore, general, if any portion of them have been used or lost during your operations, I must request that you will supply the deficiency either from your own magazines or captured property. I ask this with less hesitation, as you can always be supplied, whilst my communications are so liable to interruption as to allow me no certainty of receiving supplies regularly. I must take advantage of this the only opportunity that has presented itself, and I trust you will effectually aid me in crossing the supplies. The officer sent will have a list of all ordnance and ordnance stores.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

E. KIRBY SMITH,

Lieutenant-General, Commanding.
