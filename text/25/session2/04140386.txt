cannot no«r command a cent in specie? And is it
not now compelled to dishonor its credit, and vio-
late its taiih, because it collected its dues m bank
notes, andxonfided the safe keeping of its funds to
the bank*? And yet while the Senator denounces
this want of ability on the part of the Government,
he is the strenuous adv ocate to renew its connec-
tion with ihe banks, under the fallacious idea that
bank notes and bank credit are equivalent to spe-
cie, dqmg, in a word, the very thin? again wh eh
has subjected the Government to the necessity
which he so strongly condemns' Worse than th>
he proposes to repeat the process, when it is ad-
mitted, by his colleague, [Mr. Davis,] and his dis-
tinguished friend behind him, [Mr Clay,] that the
renew al of the connection must again, be followed
in a short time by anoiher explosion, when again
the Governm-nt would be compelled to do what
the Senator so justly and strongly condemns1 He
wa> at a loss to understand how the Senator could
reconcile the co diet between his «enliments and
the course he advocated It seemed lo him, that
as the ¿ealous supporter of the good faith of (he
Government, he ought to be the warmest advocate
of ihe only mode of collecting and keeping the
public money by which it could be presei red
Tne Senator, in his 7eal to preserve the pub'ic
faith, recommended tint the Treasury notes autho-
rized to be issued by this bill, should be made lo
bear an interest of 6 percent and be sold for money
instead ot being paid to the pubhe creditors He did
not explain what he meant by money If he means
gold and silver, does he not see hoiv greatly it
would impede and embarrass the resumption of
specie payments, for the Government to go into (he
market, and draw out at once eight or ten millions
of specie? Would he recommend that at this criti-
cal moment, when the banks were about to resume'
If he means bank notes, then it was neither more
noi lesi than to adv ise the Government to exchange
its credit for the credit of the banks of New York
and Boston, (the only specie payments at this mo-
ment,) and give them 6 per cent to boot, when it
was notorious that Treasury notes were at par in
both those piaees, and would be better over the
whole South and West than the very notes for
which he proposes to exchange them1 This would
certainly be a very good operation for those bank ,
but would be i veiy bad one ¡or the Government
and peop'e The Senator has spoken of Trea-
sury notes a« being depreciated Such was
not the fact The\ had been above par ever) where,
habitually compared with the local bank notes,
except during shcrt intervals at New York, but
that did not show that they were auually depre-
ciated We ah know that the currency of New York
has been in a highly artificial state, from the neces-
sity its banks were under to resume specie pay-
ments by a certain day, or forfeit their charters
The rate of her exchanges with London clearly
proves Ihe unnatural condition of her currency
The difference in her favor was far greatet than
could be explained by any operation of commerce,
and if he did not mistake, was greater than the de-
preciation of the Treasury no es, compared with
her local currency, which demonstrates that they
have not been depreciated it any time, compared
with London, which may fairly be considered the
standard of the currency of the commercial world
Though he regretted, with the Senator, tint the
Government had not at all times been in the condi-
tion to meet its engagements m gold and silver, it
was some consolation to reflect that substantial jus-
tice had been, done to its creditois, as far as it hid
used its own credit throughout this embarrassing
and painful crisis
The question before ÜVm was very simple Tha
Government was out of money, and there were
but two ways of supplying the deficiency—to bor-
row it, or to Uae its own credit, and the question
wis which «hould be done? Tne Senator objected
strongly to the latter, but he could not po sib'y be
more opposed lo it thin he [Mr C ] was to the
former It is useless to attempt disguise Those
who advocate a loan, mean to force the Govern
ment to exchange its credit for that of the banks
There is no one so crazy as to believe that a loan
■ought to be made in gold and silver Now what
have wc daily heard for the lasj six months, from

those who are now so ^strenuous for a loan, but
that the credit of the Government was so essential
to the banks, that, if, \t was withdrawn, the whole
system would fall prostrate, and jet they bow ask
the Government to exchange its better credit for the
very credit that it_sustains, and give six per cent to
boot1 What would be thought of an individual in
private life who would commit the folly of exchang-
ing his own promissory note for that of a neighbor,
which was so inferior to his as to depend upon his
endorsement for its credit, and give similar dif-
ference'' He would be regarded a fit candidate for
Bedlam, and yet this is exactly whit those in favor
oí a loan w ish Government to do To give a clear
conception how the blending of the credit ol ihe
Government with the banks operated, both in rela-
tion to individuals and the Government, be would
illustrate his conception by a statement oí a case
Take three individuals, near neighbors, and of
equal wealth and credit say three planters, each
worth a hundied thousand dollars, free oí debí,
and of equal character for fidelity in meeting their
engagements, and call them A, B, and C. It is
manifest that, each being of equal credit, neither
would think of exchanging his credit for either of
the others, much less oi piying a difference in the
exchange But let Government mteifere and take
up C, and confer banking privileges upon
him—that is, authorize his promissory notes to be
received m its dues and th- purchase of its domain,
and give him the use of its funds between the pe-
riod* of collection and disbursements, and this
equality will be destroyed A and B would now
call it an accommodation to obtain C's notes in ex-
change for theirs, nay, C would disdain to ex-
change, unless the one should endoise for the
other, and pay him six per cent difference, and to
ihisetacli m llicy would be compelled to submit
A, foi instance, wishes to settle a son in the Wesi,
and for the purpose of purchasing land from the
Government, desues to raise ten thousand dollars.
Neither his note nor B's can buy land, and to ob-
tain the means, he is obliged lo go to B, get his en-
dorsement, which, from his perfect confidence in Ins
neighbor, he gives foi nothing, and gives his note,
with the joint credit of both, in exchange tor C's
note, deducting nearly seven dollars in the hundred,
or nearly seven hundred on the whole His s n
puts the note in his pocket book, and goes off to the
West, «here, through the magic of banking privi-
leges, it is converted into solid and fertile acres
Presently the Government gets out of money, and
all the fu nds of C (a numerous host) /ealousl) in-
sist that, instead of unrig Us o-vn notes, it should
sell them to C in exchange for his, and pay ihe
same differenc , and this they call a loan—bor
rowing money1   The thing is monstrous
Thus regarding it, he has long considered public
loans among the greatest impositions, and he was
accordingly mortally opposed to a public debt
When there was a deficit, it was better by far for
the Government to use its own credit directly, nor
did he believe it to be impossible, if the laws which
govern credit and circulation were fully under-
stood, to supersede a resort to any other resource,
without burlhening the public with the heavy and
pernicious load of debt, contracted for the most
pirt by the exchange of lis own credit for that of
the banks, in the form of bank notes He, for one,
was not vulhrg that his constituents should be
tixed for a loan, when it could possibly be avoid-
ed, and such was his repugnance to a debt, that he
could scarcely imagine the ca?e in peace or war,
that would induce him to vote lor one with his pre-
sent impressions
But if Treasury notes were really below par, as
asserted by the Senator, it would not be at «11 sur-
prising, and might be easily explained Their va-
lue mainly depends oa their receivabihty m the
publ c dues, and it rm<;it be anticipated that the
liberal indulgei oe gncn lo the public debtors a'
the extra session woulu tend to depress them in the
market, and it is a proof ot the high estimate placed
on them bv the public, that tl ty have been so 1 t-
tle pffected by the course to which he has referred
Their depression during the late vv ar, when ihey
sunk below the value of bank notes even during
the period of the suspension of specie paymen's,
has often been urged against their use    Nothing
_,  !^ -   r/ e_ -4 „ v^jj;
was more easj of explanation The Government
had the weaknes* and tolly to permit it, by its own
voluntary acts, by putting bank notes ot every de-
scription on a level with Tieasury notes in all its
transactions, while the banks on their part refused to
put them on a level with theirs in their transac-
tions The result wa«¡, that bank notes could per-
form all the functions df circulation, public and
private, while Treasury notes coukl perform only
a part There depreciation followed as a matter of
course, under the known laws that regulate circu-
lation If the Go.ern nent had leversed its course,
and refused to receive the notes of any bank that
disciedited vi notes, or rather had refused to touch
bank notes it all, its notes would have been uni-
versal!} and greu'y preferred tothoseof the banks,
and the war might have beea carried on with vastly
less embarrassment, and the saving of millions
The use of bank ere lit b\, Government had been,
m his opinion, the source o! great mischief, both in
this country and England It was the parent of
the enormous debt that has pressed so heavily on
the energies of the latter, as great as they are He
had barely touched on a range of questions little
exploied as yet, but intimately connected with the
piogress and prosperity of the country Whenever
the elerae its of a true and stable currency were as-
certained, he felt assured that it « ould be found to
connst put!) of gold and silver, aid of paper,
resting not on the credit and authonty of banks, but
of the Government itself.
He said, in conclusion, that he would vote for
the bill with pleasure, as he believed it was neces-
sary, but his pleasure would "have been increased
if the notes were to be issued without interest
Mr WEBSTER said I am not at all surprised
to hoar the Senator from South Carolina say that
he has found i íy argument against Treasury notes
a very good one m favor of separating bank and
Slate, for the present stite of the gentleman's mind
is such that he v ould find such  n argument any
where, on any subject, and on am occasion So
deeply is he immersed in this, his favorite subject,
that I verilv believe, if he should hear a discourse
on theology, or a ph losophi"al disseitauon, he
would start up and say it contained fine doctnnes
for div orce But what did I say touching the doc-
trine of divorce' I insisted that the Government
should fulfil its contracts, but what has that to do
with divorce' Did I contend that the Government
should pay any thing not equivalent to specie? I
have never done it It is as'omshmg that the gen-
tleman si ould so laboriously confound things so
different, and before he attempts it again, let U3
understand the use of tet ms I contend that Trea-
sury notes can nevei be at par, and by that I
mean at the established rates according to law
The gentleman say-, they are, and have been, at
par, because they aie equal to par in New York
But he might as well say that broadcloth, or molas-
ses, oi any other merchandise, is at par His pro-
pasitiou is that they are equal to par in New York
for the London market But what of that? I mean
that thev are not equivalent to gold and silver, m
the cm rem y, and according to law His par and
my par, therefoie, are not the same thing If he
means to meet the question whether Treasuiy
notes ait equivalent to gold and silver as the legal
standard, that is the question, but if he will not
meet that question, 1 offer no other
He ask«, how can Government pay in what is
equivalent to specie, if it pay m specie paying
bank note*? It has done so for many years, and
never fo md any difficult} m doing it, and it nevi r
will lie speaks also of our exchanging credit
with the banks, and pivngthe difference But
this a confusion of ideas, or, at lea«t, of terms
Wnat does h  mi an by credit' If he means that
the Gourimmt en con net loans in as good
turns as the b- ks, 'nUis not deni d But what
wmil" }(lie 11 i check which is given on a bank?
's ihat citdii? It is not ciedit, it is a thing entirely
dilleient To make the tv o cases at all alike, the
Government paper must be redeemable m specie,
on demand, at the Treasury, and then, I dare say,
its paper would be very good He asks if Mr.
• Astor would pav a bank for its ciedit Ml Astor,
and every man, however large their capital and
credit, borrow money of the banks when they wish,
