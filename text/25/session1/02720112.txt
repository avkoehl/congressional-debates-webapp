could speak for himself only He hid bestowed
upon that measure a good deal of reflecti n, and
had examined and listened to piany of the arguments
urged against it, and yA had not heard nor found any
thing to bring to his mind the unwelcome convic-
tion that there if. no pow er in any of oar Go v ernments
State or Federal, to check and control effectually
the corporations of the country He was reluc-
tant to believe that a State can by a grant of a
chartei, secure to a portion of its citizens an ex-
emption from the obi gations intended to be im-
posed on all the people of the United States, by
one of the most important articles m the Federal
Constitution That instrument denies to ihe States
the power to impair the obligations of a contract
There is no distinction to be found there between
the contracts of corporations and those of mdiv idual
citizens The obligations of all are to be held
hacred, untouched by Staie legislation Nearly
all, if not all, the corporal ons that ha\e se-
en «1 banking privileges fiom the States, are
required to pay specie on demand for their
notes and othei hah lities In fact, nothing; but spe-
cie can be made a le^al lender by a Sla*e m pay-
ment of any contract into wh ch they may enter
The not s con'auiing such a promise are leceived
by the community, and without that promise they
wwldnot be accepted \nd he was unwillm<* to
believe hat Congress can not inteipose when these
contracts are violated, and deny to anv Stale the
right to impair their obligations, bv a tempting to
legalise a ¡suspension of specie payments The
position of the banking msti unon1- of the countrj
at this moment can not but induce a strict search
into all the powers oí the Gcneial Government for
a remedy co-extensne w th the evil now afflicting
the country
For inviting attention to this subject, thePiesident
is entitled to the thinks of c eiv p trie t and phi-
lanthrop st The banl s 01 i) e ati es 01 ght to b(

and then, with ímpimity, depreciate theeurieniv
thus put afloat, and subject the people at large to
the evil consequences of this mismanagement
while their stockholders are not only exempt from
the lo«ses incurred, but have an oppoitunity in
common with the whole community to speculate
in, and pr*fit by the fluctuating value of their ow n

The gentleman Irom Pennsylvania has read to
the House a portion oí a sp ech made by Mr. Van
Buren, in the Senate, in 1837, to show that ihe sen-
timents then entertained by that d stinguishcd min
differ widely from those contained m his late Mes-
sage to Corgress Suppi smg that he had csti-
lablished th s inconsistency, the "en leman tc'ls us
hat he tul1 n t indulge m haish epithets. Beit

irale did not tnmk proper to delend him^el'',
some one of his fnends ciuld without diffcult ,
satisfy the countiv that l< hid b°in unjustlj
assailed, but he fiatteied him eit that this would
not beet me necessary When the g nt|pman has
delibcrateh reviewed the speech and the Message,
and has til 'ii into calm con ideration the circum
stances un 'er wheh the ha\e been ee\eriily
utteied, he thought 11" goi 'ema i would find that

parts of the Union, and fully au'hon^ed by the
Constitution "
This language ihe gentleman from Pennsylvania
supposes conflicts with the declarations made by
Mr Van Buren, in a speech delivered m the
Senate, in 1827, against an amendment offered by
Mr Praneh to the general bankrupt bill then and
there under consideration If this supposition w as
well founded, Ihere would be no just cause to apply
"haish language" to the President He could
have avoided, without censure, making the sugges-
tions m the Message, which have exposed him to
the charge of inconsistency This wnl not be de-
nied If, then, he was not compelled to speak, if
Mi Van Bmen could Tilth propriety hacheen
silent, let us mouire with whatpioprie y any un-
worthy motive could be imputed to him'2 INo one
will maintain, Mr T imagined, that the Chief
Magistrate has not a large share of sagacity and
io'esight His enemies impute to him powers of
mind a'most magical He must have known, then,
that he ha--, bj suggesting a bankiupt law asa
remedy against depreciated cunenc), put in peril
his popularity at home, where he must be most
anxious to siand firm m ui" affections of the peo-
ple He has, too by tht same step risked an ad-
dition to the numbei of the enemies of his admini-
stration throughout the country
Whatevei might be, therefore, thought of the
wisdom of his opinions, surely no one ought to
impute to him selfish or unmanly inducement*, it
in fact, he had m the Message contradicted the
doctnnes of the speech But is fhistiue'i To test
the co-redness of the charge, it will be necessaiy
to examine whit would have been the effect ard
look to the object, of the mono  which Mr Van
Buren resisted
The bill before the Senate in 1827 was f( unded
on the assumption, that all who were to be sub-
jected to its pi oí isions wer  natnro'peisins Foi
the enf rcement of its requ íements hra\ y per onal
penalties, including irrpnsonment, were to be re-
sol ted to Mr Branch proposed to amend this bill
by inserting, in the first section, the wonts "or
other banking co poiations " This amendment
was oppr sed by Mi Van Buren in the speech
from whica extracts have been lead to the House
If the mo'ion had been assented to, without other
material alfeiations m the bill, ¡t would have been
an anomaly m legislation
Banking corporations are intangible, ideal bemgs,
and could, of eomse do nothing which, accordirg
ii thebi t i on11 ha^e "mountedto an act of bank-
ruptcy Seeing thus Mr Van Pure i suiposel, if
Ihe amendment pre\ ailtd, th^t it w ould 1 ecome ne-
cessary to n w model the whole bill He therefore
proceeded to inquire, if the clause weie to be in-
serted, upon whom the pains and penalties ol the
law could, tvith propriety, be made to rest He
insisted that the officers of the banks ought not to
suffer in their persons or private property, on
account of the failures of the banks Th y are but
the employed agents of the stookhcldeis, and must
act in obedience to the directors of the institution,
and it woi Id be the grossest injustice to make them
individually responsible, not only for their own
aits, but fir the misfoi tunes and losses of coipora-
tions w hich they had no power to eortiol He
man aincd, aKo, that the private pioperty of
s'ocl hp'ders in banks then c&tstmg ought not to be
subject to tu"í b) commi sioners s>t bankruptcy,
to satisfy the debts of the corporation
By the charters of these institutions, the strck-
holders wer  expressly exempted from all liability
for the disasters of the corpoiat on and Mr Van
Pnren contended that Congress could not by an
ex post fac'o law inn" ct upon ind idua's senous
pei«onal penalties andsei/f their pmate propeity
to erforc5 contricts entere 1 into by the ir agents
imder ai aiithontv which exemp ed tiran 1-om
all lnhili y whatever
Th^se opinions aie n< t antagon stical to the sug-
gest ons con aine 1 m the Presiden1 s Message
ihe Constiti tion of the Un ied Stales without
attempting to define the provis ons or objects of a
bankrupt lait, cl >fhes Congress with power loesta-
llish a uniform sys em of bankrupts The Pre
sident has not pointed out any specific modem
which this power shall  be exercised    But says,

that, through the instrumentality of that pnvei,
such legulations may be established as win impose
a "-alutary cheek on the issues oí paper money, and,
give to the c tuen an effectual remedy, equal m * ^
parts of the Union, against some of the e^s 0f a
depreciated currency If this cannot be done with-
out controlling the laws of the States, as proposed
in 1827, then the suggestions of the M es age are
inconsistent with the views of Mr Van Buren, as
expressed m the debate in the Senate, but not othei-
wise
This is not a proper occasion to mqurc whethei
it is competent tor Congress to bung the general
authority conferred upon it by the Constitution o\er
ihe mdeotedness of bankers, whether ir dividual o'
corporate, in aid of the Stale laws "¿JBi t it w ill not
be difficult, when that effort sh ill i e i iadt, to snow
that it can be done conveniently, anc n stuct ac-
coidance with hie con litutional doctnnes contend-
ed for in the speech of Mr Van Bu en
If the bankiupt question should come, while he
w a  a member, fairly up for di cassion m Con-
giess, Mr T would undirtakr to examine how
far the several States can imt and res ma the
GoTeinmeit in the exercise fan undoubted 10  -

of privileges and immunii es to then citizens u -
compatible t\ith tint whicf may be male th" su-
pierne law of the land But, a' present, it yvas not
necessai3 to enter upon what is well km v n to be
debatable ground The suggestions of the Mes-
sage can be readily rarned out, yyi'nout tiem-htng
upon the piivileges secured to mcorpoia ed ban-
kers, by the laws Oi the seveial States The con-
dition of Ibx country, at th s moment, furni'-hes
an opportunity for an apt illustration of this opi-
nion The chatters of nearly all ihe banl s of me
country have beer forfeited, by a suspens i n ol
specie payments Unlil this occuried, the euU of
our bank ¡g system although Known one great,
were not ^eneraHy esteemed to bemtolerable Since
that event speculators and shaieis are out li^e-
hawks upon the wing, preying without restiam' up-
on the community, by buying and selling a depre-
ciated and fluctuating paper currency In many
ca es, those who are interested in fallen b?nks,
may, and piobably will, amass fortunes at the ex-
pense of the producing classes, by purchas ng at a
discount, the liabilities of the msi tutiuns with
which they are identiiied I- will be confessed
