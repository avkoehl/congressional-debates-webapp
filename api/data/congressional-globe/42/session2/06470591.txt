Expenditures of the Government—Mr. Morgan.
Ho. of Beps.
decide as to their truth or falsity. He says
first, and I quote literally from the Globe:
•' We have during the last two years reduced the
revenue $85,000,000."
What are the facts? President Grant was
inaugurated March 4, 1869. The tax- bills
which supplied the revenue for the fiscal year
1869 were passed during the administration
of Mr. Johnson, and the present Administra-
tion can be neither blamed nor praised in re-
gard to them.
I call attention to the finance report for
1869, and it shows that the revenues collected
during the year ending June 30,1869, amounted
to $370,043,747. The year ending June 30,
1870, was the first full fiscal year under Presi-
dent Grant. What was the amount of the reve-
nue for that ygar? Was it less than the amount
raised during the year preceding President
Grant's inauguration? Let us see. I quote
from the finance report for 1870, sent to
Congress by Secretary Boutwell. This report
gives the amount of revenue collected during
the year ending June 30, 1870, at $411,255,-
477, being an increase, instead of a decrease,
as pretended by Mr. Dawes, over the previous
year amounting to $40,311,730. So much for
that statement of the member from Massa-
chusetts.
A moment ago I showed that according to
the finance report for 1869 the amount of
revenue collected for the last fiscal -year for
which Mr. Johnson was responsible amounted
to $370,943,747. Let us compare that sum
with the amount of taxes collected during the
second fiscal year of President Grant, ending
June 30, 1871. I quote from the finance re-
port, which gives the amount of revenue col-
lected during that year at $383,323,944, being
$12,380,197 more than raised during the fiscal
year ending June 30, 1869, so that during the
first two fiscal years of President Grant's ad-
ministration the amount of taxes were in-
creased $52,691,927, instead of being reduced
$85,000,000, so strangely asserted by Mr.
Dawes.
Let us now compare the revenues collected
during the present, being the third lull fiscal
year of President Grant, with the revenue of
the year preceding his inauguration. The
following letter speaks for itself:
Treasury Department,
■Washington, D. C., June G, 1872.
Sir : In compliance with the request contained in
your communication of to-day, I have the honor to
inform you that the revenues of the Government for
tlio current fiscal year up to June 1 are as follows :
Customs $204,071,233 76
Internal revenue  136,968,043 42
Lands  1,911,128 11
Miscellaneous  23,115,822 35
$346,066,232 64
I am, very respectfully,
GEO. S. BOUTWELL,
Secretary.
Hon. G. W.Morgan, M. C.t House of Eeprenentatives.
The amount collected up to the 1st day of
June, 1872, was $346,000,232, but the fiscal
year does not end until the 30th day of June,
and at a corresponding rate the revenues col-
lected during this month will amount to
$28,823,852, making for the whole fiscal year
$374,889,084, or about four million dollars
more than the revenue collected during the
fiscal year 1869, making the total increase of
revenue collected during Grant's administra-
tion $56,689,504 over the amount raised dur-
ing the fiscal year 18G9.
Were my object to show the complete un-
reliability of the statements of Mr. Dawes, I
might stop here, but there are other facts to
be considered.
expenditures.
Mr. Dawes says:
" The figures I propose to publish show the exact
expenditures of the Government for the year 1871 us
compared with those of 1860. I aia surprised to be
able to show bythese figures that upon a peace basis
the actual expenditures of 1871 exceed those of 1860
by only ?6,448,000."
This statement is not true. Says Mr.
Dawes :
"Upon a peace basis the actual expenditures of
1871 exoeed those of 1860 by only $6,448,000."
The years 1860 and 1871 were alike years
of peace, but in both of those years among
the expenditures of the Government there
were payments of pensions, and on the prin-
cipal and interest of the public debt. In
order, then, to make the comparison between
the expenditures during those years fair and
honest, payments of pensions and money paid
on the public debt must be excluded. Every
one will understand that this method of esti-
mating peace expenditures is in favor of 1871,
as the pensions and debt are now large.
1. In 1871 the civil list cost $12,500,000
more than in 1860.
2. In 1871 our foreign intercourse cost
$458,000 more than in 1860.
3. In 1871 the miscellaneous expenditures
w.ere $20,500,000 greater than in 1860.
4. In 1871 the military service cost $19,333,-
333 33J more than in 1860.
5. In 1871 the Indians cost $4,500,000 more
than in 1860, although the decrease of the
Indians has been rapid.
6. In 1871 the naval service cost $8,000,-
000 more than iti 1860.
And the net total ordinary expenditures in
1871 were $65,000,000 greater than in 1860.
That there may be no mistake or doubt, I
will here give in detail the net ordinary ex-
penditures of the Federal Government for the
fiscal year ending June 30, 1871, exclusive of
pensions and payments on the public debt,
compared with the same expenditures for the
fiscal year ending June 30, 1800, as shown in
the last report of the Secretary of the Treas-
ury, pages 306 and 367 :
The civil list for fiscal year 1871 cost $18,760,779

In 1S60 the naval service cost 11,514,649
The cost in 1S71 greater than in 1860 $7,916,378
Total net expenditure on a_peace basis in 1871
greater than in 1860 by $65,210,573.
That the expenditures of the Government
in 1871 should be greater than in 1860 is nat-
ural. The development of the country and
the consequent creation of new offices all tend
to that result. The misstatements of Mr.
Dawes are therefore as unwise as they are
■untrue, for no sane man would believe that
the Government could be administered in
1871 for as low amount as in 1860. It shows,
therefore, how unreliable are the statements
of Mr. Dawes, and while he committed an
act of bad faith to the House, he at the same
time underestimated the intelligence of the
people.
Mr. Dawes asserts that the revenue has
been reduced during the last two years $85,-
000,000. I have not only proved that state-
ment to be untrue, but have shown by the figures
given in Secretary Boutwell's finance reports
that the revenue, instead of being decreased
$85,000,000 during the last two years,"was in
fact increased during that time over fifty-two
million dollars, and that within three years it
has been increased over fifty-six million dollars.
It is true that certain taxes have been abol-
ished ; but it is equally true that certain other
revenues have been increased. For instance,
according to the last finance report, while
$158,000,000 of in ternal revAi ue were collected
in the fiscal year 1869, only $143,000,000 were
collected in 1871. On the other hand the tariff
tax in 1869 only amounted to $180,000,000, but
was increased to $206,000,000 in 1871 ; and
so with other revenues.
If one were to believe the statement of Mr.
Dawes, the expenditures of the Government
for 1871, exclusive of the money paid as pen-
sions, amounted to about $68,000,000. What
then became of the $333,333,333 33J of taxes
collected during that same year? Mr. Dawes,
with his usual felicity, would doubtless reply,
" Oh, it was applied on the reduction of the
public debt."
the public debt.
And how much was the public debt reduced
during the year 1871 ? According to the state-
ment of the Register of the Treasury, finance
report for 1870, page 276, the public debt in
1870amounted to $2,386,358,599. According
to the last finance report, page 369, in 1871
the debt amounted to $2,853,211,332, mak-
ing a reduction in 1871 of only $33,167,267.
Yes, the .finance reports prove that although
more than three hundred and eighty-three
millions of taxes were paid by the people dur-
ing 1871, the debt was only reduced about
thirty-three millions. These facts are within
the reach of any one who will take the trouble
to examine the finance reports made out at
the Treasury, and no subject so vitally affects
the material interests of the country.
president grant and the debt.
Persons like Mr. Dawes have sought to
create the impression that great credit was
due to the President on the score of the re-
duction of the public debt. If it were true that
the debt had been rapidly reduced, the credit
would belong to the tax-payers, and not to
the mere agents who handed to bondholder
the money paid by the people. But it is not
true that the money paid by the people has
been wisely or honestly expended. It is true
that millions have been stolen, and that the
Treasury itself is in a State of hopeless con-
fusion.
On the 1st day of July, 1869, (see page 317,
finance report for 1869,) the public debt
amounted to $2,489,002,480, and according to
the monthly statemeut of Secretary Boutwell,
onthelst dayof June,1872,the debt amounted
to $2,295,833,523, showing a reduction of
$193,168,957, and not one dollar more. Now,
during that same period, the people paid into
the Treasury more than $1,168,000,000; so
that after subtracting the amount of the debt
reduced, there still remains to be accounted
for nearly nine hundred aud seventy-iivf mil-
lions.
