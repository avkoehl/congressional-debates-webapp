ENGINEER BUREAU:

Have you taken any steps to have the timbers removed or the bridges destroyed across the Appomattox other than the one known, I believe, as Goode's Bridge? There is one near the terminus of Clover Hill Mountains, which would only cause, I am informed, a detour of from 3 to 5 miles. That, and indeed any others which might enable the raiding parties or the enemy's forces from above to cross, should be effectually crippled or destroyed at once.

J. A. SEDDON.
