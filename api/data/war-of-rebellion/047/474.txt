the principal men in various sections of the State, and invoke their aid and co-operation with the purchasing commissaries and Government agents in their districts in inaugurating and putting into operation some system by which our armies can be more promptly supplied, and all of our resources which are necessary, secured to the Government.

The appeals to me are and more urgent every day; the pressure upon our State is very great. Should she now respond to the call make upon her resources as she has upon the bloodiest battle-fields of the war, the measure of her glory will be full. But if we withhold our supplies, we cripple our army, and render it impossible for them to advance after achieving most signal victories. The people at home must put themselves upon a war footing. This they have never yet done. They must sow, and plant, and gather for the Government. Then, and not till then, will be bright rays of peace break through the clouds of war which overhang us.
