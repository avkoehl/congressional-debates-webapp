appears further to have furnished the War Department with pounds 52,820 4s. 1d., and to have received from it in the shape of warrants and bonds pounds 52,476 15s. [see statement covered by his letter of 19th of February], so that he is at present under actual advance to it of pounds 108,629 3s. 5d.

Major Ferguson still has a claim of pounds 35,000 on Mr. McRae, as pounds 50,000 only have yet been paid him on his warrant for pounds 85,000.

Mr. W. G. Crenshaw holds the Commissary warrant for pounds 40,000, which Mr. McRae cannot honor.

If the Engineer Bureau has drawn for its pounds 12,000 the warrant had not appeared at date of Mr. McRae's letter and statement.

Major Waller, of Quartermaster's Department, has drawn for pounds 20,000, and the drafts have been accepted by Mr. McRae.

Major Huse informs Mr. McRae that he owes pounds 129,593 12s. 4d.

The sum total of all this is that Mr. McRae is under advance to the War Department pounds 128,629 3s. 5d., including the accepted drafts, and that the agents of the various bureaus hold warrants on him for pounds 89,000, including the pounds 12,000 of Engineer Bureau, which I presume has been drawn for.

These are the facts of the account between the War Department and Mr. McRae. The accounts cannot be thoroughly adjusted until it is definitely ascertained how much the War Department is to get out of the Erlanger loan. A second question will then arise, the apportionment of this amount between the various bureaus and the settlement of accounts between them. The funds of the one have, it would seem, been used to meet the liabilities of the other.

Assuming that the share of the War Department out of the Erlanger loan is pounds 807,476 5d., the accounts between the various bureaus may be adjusted as follows:

pounds s. d.

The Ordnance Department to draw for 187,623 8 5

The Medical Department to draw fo

Commissary Department [now Ordnance

Department] 22,500 0 0

Total 233,785 14 4

This will exactly cover the deficit [see eighth line, second PAGE] uncovered by warrants out of original advance of pounds 544,976 5d. and leave the pounds 262,500 additional to be used by the various bureaus according to apportionment.

As Major Waller, of Quartermaster's Department, has drawn for pounds 20,000 more than justified by the apportionment made here, it becomes a question whether this amount should not be credited Mr. McRae on the pounds 80,000 warrant held by Major Ferguson, and on which pounds 50,000 have already been credited.

Your obedient servant, very respectfully,

THOS. L. BAYNE,

Lieutenant-Colonel, &amp;c.

The above sum of pounds 22,500 has been reimbursed to the Ordnance Department here, and therefore should be covered by the draft of that Bureau. The above arrangement charges the Ordnance Department with the whole $120,578 10s. 10d. for transportation.
