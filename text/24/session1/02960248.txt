THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
March 11,
now proposes 10 withdraw from his seat when
the \oie ia taktn up in the question now before
the & inti,because he bill, ves, tint by it cuvina;
the petition, the Senate h-s taken juiisdiction of
the question oi slaun ,-niid milictid a vit il stab
upon the interests of the ¡south Did I concur
with tlu lnnoiabk ¡senator fiom South Carolina
in this, opinion, I would ptu&ue a \eiy ditFcicnt
couist Should the Amencan Senate succeed in
assumni-rjurisdietion overthe questionofsl uirj ,
I wouid 11 main no longei in my seat upon this
floor, amid the biokeii columns of the Constitu-
tion, but letuin to my constituents to act with
them, and foi them, as the emcigencv might de-
mand Uut the Sen Ue has taken no juiisdiction
over the question ot slavery The question upon
«vhich alone the beinte has decided is the ques-
tion of the right ot petition When the Senator
from ¡aoutn Caiohna. i ilnily dcl.bciates upon the
vote by which this petition was leceived, can he
for a moment believe that it was a vote upon the
question of slavciy Lipon the only question de-
cided by the Smite, (in opposition to my vote,)
the South was equillv, divided veiy many Sen
atots voting toi the reeiptionot tin petition who
had avowed then conviction that Congiess had
no constitution il ¡wur o\ci this subject, tnd
who were as much opposed to tut assumption of
any juiisdiction bv t .e ¡5 inte o 1 r tins qui stion,
as tht Scnatoi fiom Sou'h <_ 11 jlina himself The
South w as not only equally divided in the voti
given upon the íeception of tin petition, but the
vote wa  neithei a section il 1101 a party vote
The Senate ha* decided only tht constitution il
question of the right of pttition, md now we an,
foi the yirsi time,culLd'upon to ^ivc the first vote
upon the mam question of the abolition of slavciy
in this Distuct Upon this question the Senate
have given no vote, the) have mide no decision,
for as well might it be contended, th it the Senatt ,
by receiving, unanimously, a petition to incor-
porate a bank ot the United Statt s, had asserted
their constitutional povv ei to establish such an in-
stitution The question now pie suited for our
determination is, shall we giant tin piayer of
these petitioners for the al ohtion of slavciy in
this District' And shall I join the Senator fiom
South Carolina in leaving my si at, and refusing
to vote upon this vital question' Sh ill I if mam
a silent spectatoi 111 tne lobby, when thismomuit
ous question is decided,and leturn hen afu r tlu
vote is taken, when the battle foi the South 1  lost
or won > Should I retreat tiom that conflict, my
constituents might charge me with ltcnancy to
their interests, and, what is woise, my eonscn nee
would accuse meofagioss dereliction of duty
Wt aie now about to vote upon tlu question of
the abolition of slav ei y in this Di&tuct None
but Omniscience can throw its foiccasting vision
into futurity and predict, with absolute certainty,
how this question will be decided here Suppose
it is decided against us, and that this decision is
obtained by the w ant of my opposing vote > What
answer could I giv e to my constituents for desi rt-
ing my post at such a period, and thus yielding
to our ad vei sanes this victory over the Constitu-
tion and the Union? Sn, I could give no answer
to such a question I shall th leleue remain 111
my seat, and lecord my vote foi the ¡ejection of
the prayer of these pctitioneis
The  final  question was  tht n  taken  on  Mr

Mr WEBSTER said, he had several petitions
on the subject of abolishing slavery in the Dis-
trict of Columbia, which he had drliyed present-
ing until the decision of this question He said,
he should take an early opportunity of laying
them bcfoic the Senate, and he would, probably,
at the same time, express the view s he entertained
in relation to the subject
After the considciation of executive business,
The Senate adjourned.

which the Indian title had been extinguished
The locations had been mule in the Ti rntory of
Florida The time allowed bv the act for making
sale of the lands thus granted and located, was
about expiring, but fiom causes not necessary to
be then mentioned, (but which, lie doubted not,
when known would be entirely satisfactory,)
more than one fourth of the giant remained un-
sold It was the desire of the trustees of that in-
stitution that further time be allowed for the sale
of the remainder of the giant.                                   1

NORTH CAROLINA CONTESTED ELECTION.
The House then resumed the consideration of
the motion made by Mi Spangler, to reconsider
the vote rejecting the pioposition to allow Mr
New land leave to appear by counsel in the pios-
ecution of his claim to tlu si at 111 the House at
present occupied by Mr Giaham
Mr BOULDIN said it had not been, nor was
it then, his design to detain tht House more than
a very few minutes, and he would not have
spoken at all had it not been to reply to some re-
mark  which fell from the gentleman fi 0111 Pennsyl
vaniti [Air Anthony] y < sterdav, which wt re that
every gentleman who had voted foi counsel on that
occasion gave a vote to disparage the rw titioner.
Mr B had before votpd for counsel, and would
again voti foi it, buthc piotested against the idea
that that vote was a dispaiagcment of the peti-
tioner Pie did not consider it a disparagement
of any gentleman to want counstl He might
need counsel himsc ¡f in some cases—he might
need it in íelation to the laws of Noith Carolina,
because he had never been under the necessity of
examining those laws, and was unprepared to
make a d< eision in relation to them. They had
a vast deal of business on hand, besides the con-
tested election, which called for their investiga-
tion That being the case, he thought nogentle-
man should be unwilling to hear the arguments
of any counsel that might be introduced A gen-
tle man might not be aide toarguealegal question,
and still lu misdit do ample justice to his constit-
uents He did not understand that Mr Jefferson
was a great debater, yet he did not think any gen-
tleman would say that he was not able to repre-
sent his constituents Again, Loid Coke says,
that a man is not so wise in his own matters as
in those of other persons It had been said that
they were the counsel for the petitioner, as well
as the judges. He would ask gentlemen if they
would go into a court of justice and trust to the
judges to be their counsel altogethei > Did judges
prepare themselves for every case which came
befoie them > He thought not; he thought there
was no better way of proceeding in such cases,
than by hearing the arguments on both sides,
they would then be able to decide between them,
and decide correctly He thought that much the
best and safest plan, because when gentlemen
became entangled in an argument, they seldom
ever gave it up, whether it was right or wrong
They weie then better capable, in his opinion, to
judge of the case after hearing each of the parties
setting forth their own pretensions in the best
possible light. He did not consider it a dispar-
agement to say that they had not time to make
an inquiry into the matter It was, to be sure,
then duty to examine every question which came
before them, but there were other questions
which claimed their attention of more importance
to the people generally, than the one pending
