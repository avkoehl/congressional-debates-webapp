Mr. PEYTON resumed, and was addressing
the House on the appeal from the decision of the
Chair on the questiou of order, raised by himself,
when
Mr. THOMAS rose and called him to order,
on the ground " that there is no question before
'the House which is debatable: the previous
' question having been called for, which is not
' debatable; that it is not in order for any member
' to enter into debate on a question of fact, about
' which the Speaker and a member may disagree.''
The SPEAKER decided that, as the previous
question had been moved, and as, by the rules of
the House, pending the demand for the previous
question, " further debate of the main question"
is preclnded; and " on a previous question there
shall be no debate;" that debate on the p>int of
order, if objected to, could not be entertained; as,
if permitted, the operation of the rules of the
House, which precluded debate on the previous
question, would be defeated; and that conse-
quently, no member could enter into debate on a
question of fact as set forth in the point raised by
Mr. Thomas.
The question was then put, " Shall the decision
of the Chair on the question of order first raised
by Mr. Peyton, stand as the judgment of the
House?" and passed in the affirmative—yeas 136,
nays 46; as follows:

¡     A motion was made by Mr. Rencher, that the
| rules of the House be suspended, to enable him
to submit a resolution touching the subject-matter
' of the said contested election.
Í     The SPEAKER decided that pending the mo-
tion for the previous question, it was not in order.
From this decision of the Speaker, Mr. Rew-
cher took an appeal to the House, and* stated his
1 point of order in writing, as follows:
!     That pending a call for the previous question, it is in ot-
I der to move to suspend the rules of the House, for the pur-
1 pose of offering such a resolution as the following, to wit:
'     Resolved, That by general agreement, there shall be no
', further debate upon the resolutions of tliocommittce. or the
resolutions proposed thereto, in the form of an amendment.
Resolved, therefore, That the call for the previous ques-
tion ought to be Withdrawn ; and that toe Housc,proceed to
vote on each resolution contained in the amendment; and
! that it be done without debate.
The SPEAKER stated that if, by " general
; agreement," the motion was entertained, rio ques-
tion of order could arise; but objection being made,
it was not in order to entertain the motion at this
! state of the proceeding, and whilst the motion for ¡
| the previous question was pending.
|     Mr. PATTON rose to debate this appeal.
|     The SPEAKER decided that it was not in or-
¡i der to debate the said appeal, the previous ques-
1 tion having been moved.
, From this decision Mr. Patton took an appeal
to the House—and the question was put on this
appeal, " Shall the decision of the Chair stand as
the judgment of the House?" and passed in the
affirmative -r yeas 108, nays 58.
