ready for transportation by rail. All their camp and garrison equipage will be taken. You will send a staff officer to expedite the movement. As soon as they are ready, you will telegraph to Captain Holden, acting chief quartermaster, who has been directed to send you transportation. If the regiment can get off to-nigh so much the better. Let them be moved as promptly as possible. You will inform the commanding officer that he is to go to Morehead with his command and report to Colonel Jourdan. The commanding general wishes me to say in addition, that you and Colonel Savage must take care of the front for the present; other troops will be sent you to replace the One hundred and fifty-eighth New York as soon as possible. You will communicate this to Colonel Savage.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. A. JUDSON,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

BETHEL CHURCH, VA., May 21, 1864-8 p. m. (Received 8 a.m. 23d.)

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Chief of Staff:

The enemy have evidently fallen behind North Anna. Prisoners have been captured to-day from Pickett's division, and there is evidence of other troops having been sent from Richmond also. Besides these, Breckinridge is said to have arrived. The force under General Butler is not detaining 10,000 men in Richmond, nad is not even keeping the roads south of the city cut. Under these circumstances I think it advisable to have all of it here except enough to keep a foothold at City Point. If they could all be brought at once to Tappahannock or West Point by water, that would be the best way to bring them. They might march across, but if the enemy should fall back of the South Anna this might become hazardous. Send Smith in command, and send neither artillery nor cavalry, unless it is deemed expedient to marched over to West Point, thence up north side to join this command. I shall be on the Anna to-morrow or meet the enemy this side. Notify me which way they will be sent.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
