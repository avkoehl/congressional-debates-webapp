Mi   IBOVIA'-j, ot Mai yland, said he was un
expertedly called on to consider this bill, but he
esteemed the piuniple involved m it too important
to avo d its dib ussion, solely because of want of
| pre >aration
1 lie i ill  proposed to grant an appeal to an in
j dividual who felt aggrieved by the decisi n of one
of the circuit courts on a contested natent right
If it was passed,  his  House would   have  disie-
gtided the pi   visionsof the judicia y law of 17b9,
' without good cause in the liw of 1789 an at
tempt had been made to fix a uoundaiy between
ihe jurisdiction ot the seveial courts establtshel
by the United States In some cases ihe decision
oí ihe circuit cruris was final, m others, an inpet I
i was grauteu to the Supieme Court      lu all cuses,
' when theconstitu lonuhtv ofalaw was questioned,
the feupreme ( ourt I id  pri ilicum  oy appeal,
I because he supposed the (tamers of oui ¡ idiciaiy
synem thoti'ht q lesuons ot that chnrac er were
ofsulli lent dignity to nee I all ihe knowledge anil
wisdom of the seven Judg s in the Supreme Court
bench to ievis« in1 deude them finally When
the two bianches of the National Legislature, with
the «notion of tne Cxecu'ive Department, had
passed a law, theie appealed to be no ] íopnety
in peimitting any c >urt, inferioi euhei in numbers
or att iniment to those w 10 presided in the Su
preme Court to adj idge it to be null and void In
other cases, by tie sum m cmtroversy, suitors
weie empowered to abcertiin when and where the
right of appeal was withheld or ginnted If the
amount in controveisy in any case pending upon
the citcuit court, exceeded two thousand dollars,
then either of tne pames had a light to appeal to
the hignest judicial tribunal This bill tatempted
to suspend tne law of Ii89, by which the bound
aries of the juiisdiction of these seveial cour s
were thus es abhshed The constitutionality of
the patent 1 iw, in this case, has not been contl-o
verted, neither is It pietended that the amount in
contiovetsy exceeds two thousand doihrs Why
tnen <honld Congress mteifeie? The House can
not fail to see that this bill must he a pie"ins ir of
i umerous bills of the same character If we le
fuse to peimit the dtcision of oui citcuit court to
be final in the construction of the patent law, then
we must relieve against the decision of the «me
tubunals, where the true constiuctton of ihe tai IF
laws was the natter in issue In fact the Com-
mittee on the Judicial y had before them a petition
from Mr Saichet, of Philadelphia—a peiton well
known for his efficient, persevering opposition to
the tariff of Jts^S, asking from Congress a special
law to enable bun to appeal to the Supreme Court
against the decision of ti e circuit court of Penn
j sylvanis, by which he was compelled to pay duties
to the United States on aiticles which he thought
I weie not liable to pay duties to the Government
Ho\i could the committee, or the House, with pro-
I pnety gran,t an appeal in 'his case and withhold it
irom Saichet5 hi bis case the amount m contro
vers) di 1 not exceed ten t'lousard dolíais, yet t le
decision there m was a rule of conduct foi all
other pe-sons ltriforting artic'ea of a chaiaeter
such as 1 e had unreduced into tne country, and
theieby thousands of persons and tens of thou
' sands of propety mignt and p ssibiy would be
aifected He had been opposed to a special law
f_>r the old patriotic blacksmith, and he was, for
thebe reasons, opposed to inteifering in those
. cases where the numbeis of parties alone gave
consequence to th s petition The member from
Mas achusetts [Mr Briggs] might be foiced fiom
the straight line by the clamois of unreasonable
constituents, but he would not, and he hoped the
House would not be driven fiom safe mooiings
by any su^h impulses He was for a general rule
I apphcal le to all, and if the House thought proper
to revise tl e judiciaiy 'aw of '89, he was willing
to ii quire mt> the expediency of providing that
appeJs should be granted from the decisions ot
the circuit com t in cases where the amount in con-
| tioveisy was less than two thousand dolíais But,
until thegei eral law was changed, he was disposed
to enfoice it against all parties, unless some very
gnevous inconvenience had been bl own to exist
In this case he saw no gieat hardship The
party petitioning had enjoyed the benefit of a trial
. by a jury of his own neighbors, and the piivilege
ot a hearing before two tilented and enlightened
judges of his vicinage, in a contest with a stranger
to both tubunals, and he d d not think there was
much cause to con. pi un
Mr VV1SC moved to lay the bill on the table,
which was decided in the affirmative—yeas G3,
nays 61

portance demanded, moved to lay the whole sub
jec on the table, and, on tnis question, he asked
the yeas ard nays, which were ordered
M PAT LO^J moved a call of the House, 1 u1
before the question was taken,
Mi LEWIS moved that the House adjourn,
and asked foi the yeas and nays, which were

Mr  PAT [ON then withdiew the motion for a

tained by the House

olutions on the table, oy yeas and nays, and de-
I  ctded in the negative—veas 40, nays 137
'      Mr  MANN, of New "iork, remarked that, as
I  it was underbtood the Senate had adjourned, but
j   little good  oi Id  be attained   by continuing  tne
I   Hiu&e in session at tin  late hour, it being now
I   se\en o'clock     He moved the House adjourn
The question was then taken" by tellers, and de-

I   maik8, moved the previous question

Mr PLUMMER said, upon a proposition of
so much magnitude as that of changing theoiganic
law of the lahd, he considered tne origin, progress,
and history of governments a legitimate subject of
inquiry, and in order toa correct undeistanding
of the foundation upon which our complex system
of government was predicated, he consideied it
