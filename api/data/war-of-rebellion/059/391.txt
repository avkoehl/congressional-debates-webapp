Brigadier General G. M. DODGE,

Decatur:

The scouting party sent to Brown's Ferry last night has returned. Reports no boats found between ferry and Elk, nor on Elk below Florence road; also reports that no news of enemy on opposite side of river could be obtained. I do not think the officer in charge of the scout is a very sharp or thoroughgoing man.

Assistant Adjutant-General.

Brigadier General G. M. DODGE,

Decatur:

Colonel Rowett reports that all is quiet on the Tennessee River from Lamb's Ferry to Eastport; that the enemy has no pickets between Rogersville and Bainbridge at present. He has sent a scouting party along the river as far as Clifton to destroy all boats.

Colonel R. ROWETT,

Bailey's Springs:

I desire you to send in no more negro women and children than is absolutely necessary. They are only a burden upon us. We need all able-bodied men you can get. The women and children should stay on the plantations and laid in working them. It is better for them and us both.

The enemy are increasing their force in front of Decatur and moving heavy bodies of cavalry to the south of us. I am disposed to think the movement has some connection with Forrest and Polk. You should make every endeavor to gain all information of the enemy possible. Question closely every citizen who crosses, send spies over, &amp;c.

Reports show that Forrest was in the neighborhood of Columbus and Fort Pillow three days ago.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. M. DODGE,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

Colonel GEORGE E. SPENCER,

First Alabama Cavalry, Mooresville:

Send six companies of your command here immediately.

Brigadier-General.
