say to the justice of the peace of that town that we came here prepared instantly to rid the country of the rebels, and to afford Union citizens protection against them, but not quite so readily prepared to suppress the outrages of the Apaches. The latter will, however, be undertaken in due time, and it is my hope to be enabled to inflict summary chastisement upon them. In the meantime I do not think it advisable to send cavalry in pursuit of the particular party of Indians refered to, nor have I the ability to furnish the inhabitants the arms and ammunition asked for. I shall write at once to the general commanding the department to have both arms and ammunition sent to me especially for the protection of the people against the Indians. I do not believe in the efficiency of these predatory expeditions of citizens against the Indians after the latter have committed their depredations. They swoop down upon localities where they well know that due caution is not observed, and before the citizens can be rallied to pursue them they are beyound threir reach. The people must be more cautious, and in a short time troops will be sent to their relief.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. R. WEST,

Colonel First Infantry California Volunteers, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE PACIFIC,San Francisco, Cal., September 10, 1862.

Lieutenant Colonel GEORGE S. EVANS,

Second Cav. California Vols., New Post, near Owen's Lake, Cal.:

SIR: In reply to Major O'Neill's letter* reporting the number and kind of arms surrendered by the Indians agreeably to the terms of the treaty, the general commanding the department directs that firearms of every description received from the Indians shall be turned in to the new San Pedro depot, the quartermaster thereof giving the usual storage receipts.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. C. DRUM,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE PACIFIC,San Francisco, Cal., September 10, 1862.

Colonel FRANNCIS J. LIPPITT,

Second Infantry California Volunteers,

Commanding District of Humboldt, Fort Humboldt, Cal.:

SIR: From representations made by respectable parties it is feared that evil-disposed whites, sympathizers with secession, are stirring up the several Indian tribes in your district to make hostile incursions on the settlements. You will, the general commanding directs, endeavor to discover the parties who thus attempt to disturb the peace of the State and arrest and hold them in confinement until the receipt of further orders.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. C. DRUM,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
