Major-General BURNSIDE,

Commanding Ninth Corps:

GENERAL: I am ordered to move at dark, and I wish to know what time you can spare General Birney from your right, and whether you can send a guide with him down to Anderson's Mill on the other side of the Ny or not, or whether he had better march on this side of the Ny. If on this side, Captain Miller, my aide, will want to conduct him. General Birney's pickets remain on until they are relieved by your orders, in conjunction with your own. General Gibbon's pickets on General Birney's right will be withdrawn at dark nd will move this way.

I am, sire, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
