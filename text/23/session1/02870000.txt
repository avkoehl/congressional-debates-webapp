ions held as to the mode in w! ich the operations
of banks s. ould be conducted, as affording some
evidence to snow that they we e not justified in
attributing that conduce o a sp'nt of evil, which

nity The conduct (fit banns, he contended,
should be left to themselves Li iler all the en
cumstances, 1 e came to the concius on, that if he
weie a political adherer t of the President, (which
he was not,) tnat although it was evident he d 
sired to take all the responsibility of these meas
tires, yet, as he could i ot have foreseen thei con-
sequerees he should advise him no* to keep on,
inflexibly, toacouisewhich was bringing oes'ruc-
tion on the community, and by inea is which were
inroads on the Constitution He considered the
removal of one officer, for not complying with his
wishes, the act of removal, and the placing of the
public money, as it had been, in State 1 anks, as of
thischaractei The public money had beentrea'ed
as if it wis private, and he referred to tl e altei-
ation made n the resolutions by Mr Mardis, as
confirming these views He did.not go so far as
to say this was the union of the purse and the
sword in the hands of the Executive, in the sense
it was first used, but he v/ould soy, that it was a
vast transfei ot power to the Execu'ive, and as
Eiich, it was in opposition to the spiiit of the Con
Etitution The whole plan of State banks to trans-
act their fiscal affairs, or legi latirg to place the
deposites m them, mu t have the mos1 pernicious
effect, by increasing, man unduedegree, the r iwer
end preroga ive of one branch, and which en ¡tied
him to say Congiess would have rruch boldness
for conniving at In thelong run, much disposed
as the people were to honor the public magistracy,
they would rally under the flag ra sed here in con
flict to assumptions of power Ihey inherited
tins spirit from then ancestors It was this that
they practiced at the Revolution Everywhere 'he
people weie disposed to take from, not add to, the ¡
powei of Government The people would not be '
contented with the lestora'ion of the deposites,
tney would call for the supremacy of their branch ,
in the Govemmert Efe would then entreat all i
the friends of liberty, of law, to lend their aid in
supporting the íestoration, ard put mg an end to

Mr DICKERSOV rose and said                         I
Mr  Sieakfr   I have listened with much pleas
uie to the lemarks of the gentleman fiom Mas
sachuse is [Vi   Chovtl] who last addressed die
House      His views were new and inteiesting, and
delivered in a tone and spirit becoming the lepre-
s'entetive of a fiee people
But, sir, ! was not prepared to hea' the posi
t ons taken by the honorable gentleman, ror can
I yield to the correctness of his views, altrough so
e'oquenily expressed I had thought that the idea
or íestormg tr-e deposites as a means of lelief from
piesentdisuess had notbeensenoi sly entertained,
exceitwith a view to the rechartei of the bank
1 appear  to me that it s the worst of all expe
d ents, ird i s necessary consequence nust be to
prolot g the distress which now prevails, motead
c f re leving it IN or can I percen° of w! <it pos-
s ble benefit the poshes ion of the public deposites
could be *o the bank if it is to cease its opeiations
ii ISoG With that view, it is certainly now time
tnat tliev should in good faith commence curtaihng
their business They now have on hand—and in
the piocess of drawing in their capital they must
nece s,auly have on hand at all times—surplus
funds lying; us°'e & in their vailts, and of conse
quence the possession of the pubhc deposites, wit i
tl eir attende it du íes and liabilities, would be
wor^-e than useless to them
I do not propose sir, to attempt to answer the
arguments of the g ntleman in detail upon this
point    Bu  i would remark, that the foundation

of his whole argument rests upon the idea, that if
' the deposi es aie les'ored, the bank at the te'i ii
I nation of Vs p esent cnaiter will calm'y ceas  to
exist, and (as he lemarked) " die something like
j a Chris ian "   If I be íeved this, an, I should, in
I deed, think it wor h whne to inquire seriously into
the expediei cy of restoung the ueposites     Butm
I this respect the gem eman be„s the question      He
| asks more than wi'l be conceJed      I believe with
hm,thatt  e bank will cea e to exist a'too   ermi
nation of l s present chattel   I ut it will die haid
It will struggle as long cfa it can 1 ope to perpetuate
its existence, and I an   not dispone! to add to i 
any fuither power to piotiact its dying struggles
I intended, sir, to give a sdent vi  e upon the
i   question i ow under discuss o i     Di_t I consider
I it the prui ege of tl e neo( le to kn<" w the sen i
, ments of their tepre^eiititives unon all suljects
I involving tneir mteiests   andas J have b°en in
st ucted by my constituents upon this subject, a
silent vote might not be considered as expressive
of my own sentiments, but only as a response to
theirs     Undei  these circumstances, 1 must ask
the indulgence of the House whilst Í briefly state
my views of the matter now under discussion
Bv the repoit of the Committee of Ways and
Means the following propositiors are submitted
for the consideration of Congress
1st That the Bank of theUrited States should
not be lechar ered
2J   That the deposites should not be lestored
3J   That the State banks si ould b* coi  inued
as the placee of public deposite, and  that they
should be regulated by law   and
4 h That a committee shoul 1 be appo nted to
investigate 'he concerns of the bank  &c
In phce of these íeso'u'ions the gentleman from
Georgia [Mr Wildd] ¡as propos ' an amend
ment, declating that the reaso is assigned by the
Secretary of the Treasuiy are insufficient, and
the piesent discussion tuins upon that proposed
amendment
I do not intend to trespass u non the time of the
House by recapitulating the many arguments and
reasons which have been uiged upo" the different
topics involved in this discussion, and whicn must
be familiar to this House, but p opose to state
briefly my conclusions drawn from those argu
ments, and to show that the proposed amendment
should not i e adopted
I understand thatveiy life differerce of opinion
exists as to the propriety of adopting the proposi
tion contained in the last resolution of tl e Com
mittee of Ways and Means
The second and third of those resolutions appear
I to me to deperd very much upon the decision of
j the fiist   and the  qjestion  involved in the first
lesolution, whethei the Bank of the Unitpd S ate^
shall be rechaiteied, I consider as the real ana
impor ant question now under discussion before
Congiess and ti e pe p'e     No mattei  how this
question may be connected with other consideia
tions—no matterhow ingenuity may stnve to con
ceal it from pabhc view—no mattei how political
aspirants may use the occasion for men ambitious
purposes—it must result in the nnj-Oi ant inquiry
whether it be cons stent wim  the great interest
of this Republic that the United S ate~ Bank si all
I be oontmued      Before I   proceed to explain my
i views upon this point, permit ire, sn , to dispose
| of some snl ¡ects which ha e been pressed in o
, this discussion, as I consider, impiopeily, and for
j pol tical effect
The question of the powei and au hori v of the
I Piesment of the Uni'ed States to remove his Sec
retary, .n the mainel he has done, I coisid rhas
| no necessary connexion with, and ought to have
no beaung uoon, the decision of tl e question of
the renewal of the cnaitei of the Bank of the Ur i
ted States, nor of the present disposition of the
puolie deposites     And as I am unwilling that the
!   real point in issue phould be involved   n any ex
I traneous matter, or obs-ured from view by any
other subjects not necessanly connected with it, I
1| shall not at present remark upon that point, except
to observe, that if the Piesident had been guilty
of a corrupt, or arbitraiyror unconstitutional ex-
ercise of power, in removing his Secretary, or in
appointitg another, or in i ecorrmendmg the re
moval of the public deposites, m the manner he
has done, he is responsible to his country for his
conduct ]>t him be called to account, and put
upo i his defence And peimit me to say, that if
he does not answer piompily, and defend himself
triumphant y, it will be a ne v era in h s history
But it has been said that he shields himself be-
1 md a majority in this House, and, tnerefore, that
such an etiort would be useless. The allegation
proves too much for those who use it, unless they
can show, as they sometimes appear to believe,
that the minority should govern the majority It
is true, I have no doubt, that this House would
shield him fiom oppression, but never from a fair
and i npartial investigation
4s to the cUiro of the bank to retain the public
deposites un il the teimwation of the eharter, it
appears to me to be without foundation The
i ght of the Secretary of the Treasury to with-
hold tiose deposites from th  bank, is íeserved m
the char'er by exnress ard unequivocal words
iiieassignn entof his reasorsisan act necessanly
subsequent to the net of removal, and conse-
quently pie upcoses the existence of the right to
lemove
The object of the provision contained in the 16th
section of their chai ter, requiring the Secretary to
asMgnh s reasons, was to enable Congress to judge
whether the Secretary had consulted the puohc
mteiest in mak ig the removal,and not to inquire
how fai ti e mteiests of the bank had been con-
sulted And if it had been the intention of Con-
gress to limit the disci etion of tne Secretary in this
íespec' to the single question of the safely of the
deposites in the United States Bank, 1 cannot
urderstand wry they should require him to a*ssign
his teasons, when but one reason could exist, and
tnat reason ascertained by law For these, and
many other reasons, which have been urged before
this House, and which I do not intend to repeat, I
conclude that the claim of the bank, by then chai
te", to retain the public deposites, is not well
foundel, and that it was the right and duty of the
Secietsiv of tie Treasury to íemove those de-
posites, whenever the exigencies of the country
requned their removal
But, Sir, it has been seriously uiged that the
deposites should beiestored to the United States
Bank, foi the rmpose of rebuking the President
of the United States for h s arbitiary and corrupt
exercise of power, in the removal of his Secretary
I a~i well aware, s>r, that there may be many
gertiemen, Vvhose chitf ar d favori'e object it is to
rebuke the Pies dent, ratner than relieve the peo-
nle But I was not picpared to hear this reason
fot the resto"a'ion of the deposites pubhcly urged,
and I cannot consider that its tendency has been
well Considered
In this counti y, no man can be tried for the most
trifling cl aige, without having an opportunity of
being heard in bis own defence It is the great
sccumy of the people against oppression And
shall u e, here, now undertake to try the Chief
Magistrate of om country, upon a change, v hich,
if true, should hurl him ficm the high place which
he now fil's with so much honor to himself and his
country, without giving h m the privilege common
to every Amencan cit zen—the privilege of being
heard in his own defence' Sir, the veiy act would
render us g t Ity in the highest degree, of the of
fence cnarged against him If gentlemen wish to
rebuke the President, let them meet him, as he
has always met his opponents, in fair, open, and.
manly corflict, and nou strive to rebuke him by
indirect means, by the union of the influence of
nul ifieis, bank men, md aspiring politicians Let
them resoit to impeachment, or to ihe ballot boxes,
and i ot to a method heretofore unknown to our
laws and Constitution
It is true, sir, that the several questions growing
out of this subject—which, for the reasons stated.,
