protective. With ordinary care the men defending them are protected from the fire of the enemy. the health of the men serving along and near the line of railroad require that a strong pioneer force be ordered to draw off the stagnant and putrid water by filling the ditch on the west side, which will force the water out, at the same time cover all sources of disease so abundant in that locality. Considerable policing was done yesterday, and the camps of the First and Second Brigades much improved, but two or three points along the sap by which the outer lines are approached need raising. With these trifling exceptions, the approaches are good and safe. I observe to the right of the fort of the enemy blown up on the 30th ultimo, and farther back in a thick woods, quite a large earth-work has been thrown up, the only recent change noticed in the enemy's works in front of this division.

I am, general, respectfully, your obedient servant,

Colonel SHARPE,

Deputy Provost-Marshal-General, City Point:

Everything in our front here remains as heretofore. On the north side of James deserters report no changes. Nothing, I am confident, has left our entire front. I telegraphed you yesterday, but received no answer.

Colonel SHARPE,

Deputy Provost-Marshal-General, City Point:

I have just received a deserter from Terry's brigade. He reports that a rumor exists in their camp that all of Longstreet's corps, save Pickett, have gone to Richmond, and thence north. A gentleman from Richmond, who was seen by a comrade of his last night, informed them that he had seen them in Richmond. The man knows nothing of any one in his rear, and says that he knows the cavalry all left. Kershaw's division was in their rear. I imagine, and indeed believe, that very likely they have gone as he says. No deserters from Field's to-day. He may have gone with them. It is believed in Pickett's division that they are about to march and to be relieved by Heth's division. There is strong circumstantial evidence to confirm this.

JOHN I. DAVENPORT,

Lieutenant, Acting Aide-de-Camp, and Assistant Provost-Marshal.
