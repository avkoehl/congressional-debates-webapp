from the south to a point this side of Corinth, back down, and depart on the Memphis road. They were plainly heard all night, and although I listened for hours, I confess I cannot give a reasonable guess at their movements. I am sure their pickets to the west of the Purdy road are there to defend the Memphis road.

General Smith's cavalry reconnaissance, now out, must develop something more accurate on this point.

I have sent you a Mobile paper of the 22nd by the hands of General Thomas, out of which you may get some intelligence. The gunboat fleet is at Vicksburg.

My picket officers report hearing the march of troops, the sound of drums, &amp;c., but very unreliable. We can only guess at what they were about last night.

CAMP ON CORINTH ROAD, May 27, 1862.

Major-General WILLIAM T. SHERMAN:

You will send a force to-morrow morning to drive the rebels from the house in your front on the Corinth road. Drive in the enemy's pickets as far as you can and make a strong demonstration of attacking Corinth. You are authorized to call upon any adjacent division to assist you. There will be an advance on the left, and maybe some hard fighting.

FARMINGTON, May 27, 1862.

Major-General HALLECK:

You no doubt heard last night the signal guns and rockets of the enemy. From midnight to daylight they were running trains rapidly, I think south, on the Mobile road. I think there were not more than six regiments and a battery on our left yesterday, and their only support to their pickets. I send to-day two regiments of cavalry to pass through Iuka in the night and destroy a heavy covered bridge on the Mobile Railroad 45 miles south of Corinth. One of my cavalry regiments returned from Iuka last night. I think this expedition will be a surprise, and will meet with little opposition so far from Corinth. They will be at the place by daylight to-morrow morning. As they will be ordered to return by a different road, they will run no risk of ambush.

JNumbers POPE,

Major-General.

CAMP ON CORINTH ROAD, May 27, 1862.

Major-General POPE:

Have you established batteries in front of Farmington? If so, give me their position with reference to Boxe's house. I propose to move forward the left wing to-morrow morning. Are you ready? How about Rosecrans' division? Will it be up and ready?

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General.
