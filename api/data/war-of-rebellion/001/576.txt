there it is hoped that you will be strong enough to make prisoners of war, or at least to defeat and drive off, all the United States troops you may find in the vicinity of Forts Cobb or Arbuckle. You are ordered there for that purpose. It is desirable, of course, to make them prisoners of war without bloodshed, if possible; but it is not essential, if to do so would cause too much delay. If you should be so fortunate as to take them prisoners of war, you will put them on parole, ration them, and give them the necessary transportation to Fort Smith, Ark., sending an escort of one company with them through the Indian Territory to Fort Smith, with letters to the commanding officer of the troops there, requesting him to see them on their way out of the country.

After accomplishing these instructions please dismiss Colonel Young's command, return to your line of defense, and make the dispositions of your command ordered in General Orders, No. 8, from these headquarters, except that, in case of your success, you will remove all the public property in the three forts-Washita, Arbuckle, and Cobb-to the most convenient and defensible one, and establish there the command intended for the camp on Red River, to guard and defend it until further ordered. Please take occasion whilst in the vicinity of Fort Cobb to hold communication, if practicable, with the leading men of the friendly tribes of Indians, and give them every assurance of our friendship and good-will.

Having the highest opinion of your ability and energy, I do not deem it at all necessary to enter further into detail in this letter of instructions. The greatest latitude is given you, and if you find it advisable in your judgment to depart in any way from those already given, do so. You know the object for which you are sent.

Very respectfully, colonel, I am, your obedient servant,

EARL VAN DORN,

Colonel, Commanding.

Commanding First Regiment of Texas Mounted Riflemen,

[Inclosure No. 3.]
HEADQUARTERS TROOPS IN TEXAS,San Antonio, Tex., May 28, 1861.

COLONEL: Having received reliable information (report of Colonel Young to the governor of the State) that the United States troops in the vicinity of our northern had fallen back towards Fort Leavenworth, the movement of your command in that direction is no longer necessary. Your letter of instructions in regard to the capture of those troops is recalled and countermanded. Please, therefore, proceed to make the dispositions of your troops directed in General Orders, No. 8, from these headquarters.

Very respectfully, colonel, I am, your obedient servant,

EARL VAN DORN,

Colonel, Commanding.

Colonel H. E. McCULLOCH,

Commanding First Regiment Texas Mounted Riflemen,

San Antonio, Tex.
