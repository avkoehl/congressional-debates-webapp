SAINT LOUIS, June 9, 1864.

(Received 6.10 p. m.)

Honorable E. M. STANTON:

Continual reports of rebels and guerrillas drifting in from the south come from all districts of the department. They move in small bands, and spread terror, robbery, and murder wherever they go. Our few troops, scattered all over this vast State, are powerless to give protection or punish these villains. We must prevent loyal people from being robbed, murdered, or run off, by providing short-time volunteers or enrolled militia to prevent it, whichever the Government prefers. It should be done quickly.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.

Major-General HALLECK, Washington, D. C.:

Your last dispatch says 100-days' men have been ordered here. None have come. From whence, how many and when ordered?

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.
