cross-roads near Kincannon's farm. I did not like to take them away and leave the road open. I think a regiment of infantry ought to be there also.

Major-General SCHOFIELD:

I occupied Tunnel Hill at 11 a. m. My left rests near Rocky Face, about three miles south of yourself, and my right on the road leading over Tunnel Hill to Buzzard Roost. General Palmer's corps is here. We skirmished with cavalry all of the way from Lee's house to this point. The rebels had some little artillery. We have some four or five wounded.

The head of my column reached here about 9 o'clock. General Newton is starting down the Tunnel Hill road to join General Howard. My cavalry has occupied Varnell's Station with very slight opposition.

HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI, Tunnel Hill, May 7, 1864-11.15 a. m.

General SCHOFIELD,Near Catoosa Springs:

We are in possession of Tunnel Hill, with little or no resistance. I do not propose any move to-day, as we must give time for McPherson. Hooker should be at Trickum. Let your men bathe and rest. If your cavalry can hold Varnell's it is well, but don't risk much on that flank.
