prisoners and small-arms. In this charge the loss in my regiment was quite severe, as we were exposed to an enfilading fire of musketry and artillery on our right flank, as well as the direct fire in front. First Lieutenant Henry G. Bailly, commanding Company K, was severely and probably mortally wounded, and several non-commissioned officers and privates were killed and wounded. We pursued the enemy nearly or quite a mile, when our line was again halted, and, in obedience to orders, I bivouacked my regiment in rear of the Second Iowa Battery, it being then quite dark. During the night I constructed rifle-pits in front of my regiment and the battery, all being quiet in our front except occasional firing by the pickets.

At 8 o'clock on the morning of the 16th I was directed to form my regiment on the left of the Ninth Minnesota, outside the works constructed the night previous, and to deploy a line of skirmishers in my front. As soon as the line was formed the order to move forward was given, and our line was advanced, under a heavy fire, nearly a mile, and to within about 100 rods of a strong line of entrenchments, occupied by the enemy in large force. Here the line was halted and the brigade was formed in two lines, the Fifth Minnesota on the left and in the front line, the Third Brigade being on my left. Entrenching tools were sent to the regiment, and I caused temporary breast-works to be constructed to protect the men from the enemy's sharpshooters. About 3 o'clock in the afternoon I received orders from the colonel commanding to be in readiness to charge the enemy's works in our front at a moment's notice; and at 4.15 p.m. the order to forward was given, which being repeated along the line, the Fifth Minnesota, with bayonets fixed, moved over the breast-works in their front into the open field which lay between them and the enemy's works, and at a double-quick rushed forward under the most terrific and withering fire of musketry and artillery it has ever been my fortune to behold or encounter. Yet, forward our line pressed, and soon the colors of the Fifth Minnesota were planted, the first in the brigade, upon the rebel entrenchments, and the enemy were driven from their fortified position. The regiment pursued, capturing hundreds of prisoners, among whom was Brigadier-General Jackson and many other officers. I think I can safely say that the Fifth Minnesota captured more prisoners in this charge than the regiment numbered. The pursuit was continued about one mile, to the foot of the Granny White Hills, where the regiment bivouacked for the night.

The glorious victory we had won had not, however, been a bloodless one. The loss in my regiment in this charge had been nearly 100 killed and wounded, which was about one-fourth my entire command. Captain Henry Stasson, commanding Company E, a brave and faithful officer, was killed while leading his company in the charge. Captain A. P. French, commanding Company I, was severely wounded at the head of his company. A list of the killed and wounded in the two days' engagements is herewith respectfully transmitted.*

The officers, without exception, behaved with conspicuous gallantry and performed their duty with coolness and good judgment; and the soldiers fought with that bravery and determination which knows not defeat, and are entitled to the warmest gratitude of their country. Captains Morehouse and French, and Lieutenants Bishop and Hatch, while in command of the skirmish lines in front of the regiment at intervals during the two days' engagement, performed their duty most
