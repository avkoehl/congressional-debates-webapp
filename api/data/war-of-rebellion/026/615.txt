General VIELE,

Commanding, Norfolk:

If the enemy have crossed the Nansemond they may make a rapid movement on Norfolk for supplies. You must make the best disposition of your small force you can to oppose their entrance into the city. You will have re-enforcements to-night if the storm does not prevent.

JOHN A. DIX,

Major-General.

SUFFOLK, VA., April 15, 1863.

General DIX:

If the report be true the troops had better be massed at some point like that one mentioned by you. Will give you the very earliest intelligence. Sleepy Hole is the place named, half way down to the James, in the broad water, where the heavy boats go safely. As it is some miles from the track some trains will get through, especially on the Petersburg.

JOHN J. PECK,

Major-General.

SUFFOLK, VA., April 15, 1863.

Major-General DIX:

Only one regiment from Norfolk; another should be sent. We hold the Nansemond, although 11,000 were there yesterday and drove out the boats; much encouraged. Urge on supplies of forage and some heavy guns. One of my send a few?

JOHN J. PECK,

Major-General.

FORT MONROE, April 15, 1863.

Major-General PECK:

General Viele has one regiment at Deep Creek, which is more important to you than to him. He has only two other regiments, with an aggregate of 1,300 men, of whom a part are at Bower's Hill, 8 miles from Corinth, on the Seaboard road, with a section of artillery. The two other sections of his only battery are scattered. I will send you an old Vermont regiment from here, of 400 men, immediately. Telegraphed Halleck last night. Will send heavy guns.
