I understated General Meade has just left your headquarters. Will you send him the substance of the dispatch I sent you? Say Warren was notified by Hancock, and that I have notified Mott to get all his command under arms and be ready with it or the large part of it to move in any direction. Have informed him of Hancock's dispatch. I have notified Kautz and have ordered all the cavalry here under arms to send to the plank road.
