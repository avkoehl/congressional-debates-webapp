General GRANT:

At this moment not more than half of the troops have landed from the steamers. We have been working all night. It will be 9 o'clock before all of the corps are disembarked. The cavalry are across. I ordered General Birney to attack at daylight, but I have since ordered him to defer it until we are ready here unless he has commenced it. I have not heard his firing yet.

I am, sir, very respectfully,

GENERAL: I telegraphed you at 5 a. m., but I am informed that one mile and a half of the telegraph line was knocked down last night. My telegram was to the effect that not more than one-half of my troops were disembarked at that hour (5 a. m.) and that I had directed General Birney to suspend his attack until I sent him further orders. At this hour two divisions are disembarked and about one-half of the third.
