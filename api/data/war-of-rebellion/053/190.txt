WARTRACE, October 8, 1863.

COMMANDING OFFICER,

U. S. Forces at Murfreesborough:

Please inform me what forces and what officers of the Twelfth Corps are in Murfreesborough.

DANL. BUTTERFIELD,

Major-General.

MURFREESBOROUGH, October 8, 1863.

Major-General BUTTERFIELD:

Geary has eight regiments here and one at bridge below here. I have about 300 men of First Division. The road is all clear between this and Wartrace. The rebels are all below you. The railroad will be opened to-morrow morning, when everything will go forward. This town, with large public stores, has too small a command after we leave. I have been to the bridge, and urged all possible dispatch; all is done possible to rebuild the bridge 3 miles below.

A. S. WILLIAMS,

Brigadier-General.

WARTRACE, October 8, 1863.

(Received 3.30 p.m.)

General A. S. WILLIAMS,

Murfreesborough:

General Ruger's brigade is moving to-day between Fosterville and Murfreesborough, to push with all vigor in restoring communications. General Knipe's brigade is between Bell Buckle and Fosterville. Assume command of your division as soon as possible.

The Seventh and Sixty-sixth Ohio, of Geary's, are with Ruger.

The two regiments under Lieutenant-Colonel Pardee are at Duck River bridge.

DANL. BUTTERFIELD,

Major-General.

MURFREESBOROUGH, October 8, 1863.

Major-General SLOCUM,

Nashville:

Did you authorize General Granger to say that I must leave a part of Twelfth Corps here? If so, what force shall be left?

A. S. WILLIAMS,

Brigadier-General.

WARTRACE, October 8, 1863.

Major-General BUTTERFIELD:

Nothing from Colonel Galbraith; have sent telegraphic dispatches from Stevenson to General Crook, and Colonel Galbraith's messenger has not yet returned.

JOS. F. KNIPE,

Brigadier-General.
