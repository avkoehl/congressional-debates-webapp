NEAR SMITHFIELD, N. C., March 30, 1865.

General R. E. LEE:

Following just received:

My preference is to remain with you as at present, for I could scarcely expect at this juncture to be furnished with a force at all commensurate with the exigency or able to make head against the enemy reported advancing from East Tennessee toward Southwestern Virginia. A mere territorial command substantially bereft of troops, and in which I could render no positive service, would not be agreeable, for I could not hope to be effective, whereas here I may be useful.

Lieutenant General R. TAYLOR,

Are any of the arms of the Tennessee army at your disposal? They are reported to have brought 11,000 across the Tennessee River. Less than half that number has come here.

General S. D. LEE,

Chester, S. C.:

General Bradley Johnson reports from Salisbury enemy's raiders (about 4,000 strong) at Lenoir. General Johnson will keep you advised of enemy's movements and if necessary you will stop a part of your forces at or about Salisbury to meet and defeat him.
