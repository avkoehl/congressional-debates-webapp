Captain HENRY A. FORD,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General:

Please direct the steam-boat to take my regiment on at Kelley's Ferry, three miles from here. It will save half a day's river transportation rounding the Suck from Chattanooga. Can any wagons be taken along? I have twelve days' forage and rations here. Can it be taken along and loaded at Kelley's Ferry? It will take five boats to carry my effective force. Please telegraph when they will be at Kelley's Ferry.
