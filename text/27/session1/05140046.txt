APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
June, 1841.
27th Cong......1st Sess.
Abolition ^Petitions—Mr. Rayner.
H. of Reps.
Tb/1 faultsof the letter are fundamental and radical—such as
no beauty of composition, no tropes and figuies, no flowers of
rhetoric, can oalance oi glo&s ove 'IK objections go to us
spirit arid suhstaice—to eirors of fact and law—to its tatrcness
and-umidi 5— and to its total omissim to demand iedress ft om
the Bnti h Gavornnaent 'or t<a.e outrage on the Caroline, which,
that Government has now assumed She has now assumed
that onuage for the first time—assumed it aftet three years of
silence, an J, in the assumption, offers not one word ef apology
or of consolation to our wounded feelings She claps her aims
akimbo, and avows the offence, and our Secretaiy, in h s long
and beautiful letter, finds no place to ir eit a demand for this
assumed outrage He give  up the subject, and demands no
thing of the sovereign lieletsgotheseivant, and does not lay
hold of the master fnis is a grievous omission It is tanta
mount to a suuender of all claim ioi any redress of any land
McLeod, the perpetrator is given up he is guen up without
conditions The Lnilish Government assume his offence-de
mand his release— oíítr us no satisfaction,and we give him up,
ana as"k no satisfaction ' The lettci demands nothing—literally
nothing and 11 that lespect degrades us as much as the sum-n
der upon a thieat had^de^iaded u«¡
This 13 a mjat uiateml point, and I mean to make it clear I
mean toeihow that the SBcretary m giving up the alleged in
strument, ha-> demanded notlnrg Irom the assuming superior,
and this I will do him the justice to show, by reading from his
own letter I have examined it carefully, and can find bat two
places wheie the slightest approach is made, not even to a de
mandfor redies3, but to the suggestion of an intimation of a
wish on our side ever to hear the name of the Caroline men
tioned again These two places aie on the two concluding
pages oí the lettei If theie ate others, let gentletntn point
them out and they shall be lead Ihe two paiagiaphs I difa
covet are these
"The undeisigned trust  that when her Britannic Majesty's
Government shall piesentthe giound , at length, on winch
theyjustify the local du ¡mints of Cmada, in attacking and
destroying the 'Caioline* they will consider that the iiWbof
the Unted States aie such as the undersigned has. now ie(ic
eented them, and that the Government ofthe United States b is

There may be some scenic contrivance—some stage uickm
this, but it Joaccoiding to the new t?cues—the tactics which
put the car* befoie the horse—and repeals one financial system
■before another is established
Sir, the ca^eof McLeod is not isolated n is not asohtaiy
atwiij standing by itself, but it is a feature in a large picture—a
link in a long chain it connect itself with all the aegt issue
conductof England towaids this countiy hei encroac íments
on the State of Mame—hei* occupation of our temtorywn the
Oregon—her ipso encem searching our vesseh on the coi'-t of
Ainca—the confiscation of our s'ave^ wrecked on hei islands,
m then traiibit from one pon of our cm ty to anoti ?r—her
hatching in London foi oui Sou hen States wha ^ a^ hatched
the e above foi ty yeais ago foi San Domingo the insuiiection
of our slaves and the debt ruction of then owneis—an 1 thp
ominous unofficial intimations that the Union is bound Joi the
debts of the States The Mrl eo 1 ca^e mixes itself with the
Wi ole of thes , and the success which has attended British
thie ts 111 tns case may bung us threats m all cases, and blows
to back them—such blows as the towns of Syria lately ic
ceived from the wai steamers of Stopfoidand ísapier
i he Brit'sh are a great people—a wonderful pe ipie—and can
perform as well as thieaten Oceupymg an island no largei
than oneof our piincipal States, they have taken possession of
the commanding points m the four quarter  of the globe, and
predominate ovei t n extent of land and water compared to
which the greatest of empiies— that of Alexander that of the
Romans—that of the Caliphs—was no'hing bin a d git Wai
is to them a dictan* occupation Something like pnacy on a
va^t •«cale, m whieh then ííjetsgo forth to ea"it ue and destroy,
and to leturn 'oaded with the spoils of plundfiednat ons Since
the time of Willi im the Gorqueior, no hostile foot has trod
their soil, and,saif thus fai liom the iav<ages ot wai at home,
they ate the mote ready to engage in lavages abioad lo
strike—to ciush—to plunder—to terrify—and to ma'te peace—
is the 1 policy and their piactice, and they look upon us, with
o n iich towns and defei celebs eoas s, as a fit sul ject for these
compendious tactics We all depiecate a wai wi h that | eo
pie—none depieca e it more than I do, but we shall never
prevent it by truckling to their threats and ^quandeiing the
money in douceurs to the States which ought to go to the com
mon delence ihe result of our first war with this people
shows what we could do when only the fifth of oiu pie&ent
numbeis, in a seven years' contest The insult of the second
one shows that, at the end of two years we can learn to fight-
can g^t oui hands in, and begin to conquer- and, in the event
of a third war, wo to the statesman who^e timid tongue shall
cry foi peace at the end of two 5 eats ' We shall then jubt be
getting ready to conquer and two or three yeais more may
give us the victories which will eecuie to us peace in all time to

ihút the tlou e would let is  business go on as it
halieen cor ducted heretofore, on rules adopted
two jears a^o     But no, the gentleman from Mas-
sachusetts and the band of Abolitionists a sociated
with him, must fir t have a triumph over the suf-
fering South, before  Ihey  would enter on the first
step of public oasine s.    Mr. R  and his friends
were anxious to go to work, and not to fan the fire
between the N >nh and the South.   They knew
thaj the people demanded something very different
at their bands. It was their duty to forget all sec-
tit nal feelings, and make a sacrifice of ihem upon
the holy aliar of their country's good But no, no;
the Abolitionists had attempted to wield the rod of
terror o\er the South; the feelings of every South-
ern man must be outr ged; till this was done, not
one str<ke must be struck at the greal task which
hai brought Congress together. Whit had he
asked' Only that the old rules be buffered to re-
main in force for a few days, till ihey could be re.
vi«ed. Bat no; it could not be allowed; ihe South
must be insulted fi'st, and then they might get to
business. But this was a q'ies ion on which the
South could yield nothing. They demanded only
their ngbl"! They claimed the great mcivl power
derived ftom being in the right, and of forcing their
opponents to be the aggres:o s, if aggression there
must be.
Mr. R. said he sever would vote for any propo-
sition which íeco^ni-es the reception, for a mo-
ment, of Abolition petitions by the House of Re-
pre'entatives. He never would, by his vote, suf-
fer them to be in the possession of the House at
all He believed their reception was a viola'ion of
the Constitution of the United States. He saw
daily that it was an obs'ruction to the business of
Congress and he belifved that its tendency was to
sow the seeds of dwoid and mutual hatred, not
only in this Hall, but throughout every portion of
this once happy Union
As the ConMitu ion gave to Congress no power
to take private property but for public use, and
then not without just compensation, he held that,
under lhat Con«tilution, he had co right to lake the
private property of the citizens of the District cf
Columb.a, unless gentlemen call it a "public use"
to tramp'e on the people of one portion of the
Union to gratify the fanaticism, of the people of
another po tion Legi lition of sueh a character
could tend orly to gratify ptivaie rpalice or sec-
tional prejudice. The South believed that, if the
rght th'ib to take private f ropcriy for the mere
purpose of ret ding the Union "¡sin der snou'd once
be established, the Union would become valueless
to them. Such lesislation went to open the door
still widci to the usurpations of men who make
breaches in the wall  of the Constitution, ihrough
which the citadel of our liberties might afterwards
be assailed.
[Mr R. now said that, when he had endeavored
to get the floor last evening, it has been his mten-
tit n to speak but aboat twrn'y minute-, and the ob-
stinacy (if genilemen cho¡ e to call ¡t co) which ha
now displayed w¿s only because he considered h m-
s lf as not h?ving been fa rly or courteously treat-
ed He now held Ihe floor, and ne would give no
pledges whatever as to how ¡Oiig he should occupy
«J
But even admitting that the ingenuity and «-o-
plustry in wl. ch Abolitionists abouuded could dis-
toit the abol non of slavery in me Disinc of Co-
lumb a into a great ard valuable "publ c use" oí
"prnae property," hoic were ihey to get the
means of "v,onr>pensatioii'2" Would gentlemen
tax Ihe cu zei s oí this D Mncc to pay for property
which already belonged to them' Cou'd there bt
a greater mockery of justice? Would they tax tne
people of the Stales to pay for properly laksn
from the people of ihe Disinct of Columbia^ That
would be (o do ihat without consent which they
CT-li not do even with corsent; it would be a le-
gislative iram', it would be doing that mdirec ly
vhith the  bad ro right lo do dirfctly It wou'd
not oily b" injuiious to the Southern St les, but a1*
insulting as it v as injurious It was like raakirg
a man buy the la'h to scourge himself, or pay fcr
the poison by which he was to be desl.o^ed
1 But if there were no other objection to such a
mearure, Mr. R. look the ground thai a difficulty
perfectly insurmountable  presented   itself in the
, terms of the compact with Maryland and Virgi
ma, when the Unued Slates  Government received
the cession fiom thtse States of the ten mihes
square. Tne deeds of Cfssion exp>essly provided
against such an emergency; and a gentleman who
had preceded him had proved that the danger in-
volved in ihe attempt to viola'e the terms of tho-e
instruments was more monstrous than even Mr. R.
had supposed it to be.    The honorable gentleman
