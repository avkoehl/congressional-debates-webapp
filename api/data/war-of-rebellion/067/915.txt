hold the line passing over the hill, near Tucker's house, by skirmishers only. General Willcox, who was on the left of General Potter, connected with the Eighteenth Corps. Near the junction a strong fort was built, called Battery Fletcher. The First Division took up a line nearly at right angles with the mainline, extending from near the Woody house int he direction of Allen's Mill. The enemy drove in the skirmishers in front of the Second Division on the afternoon o the 6th, which gave them possession of the high ground near Tucker's and Bosher's houses, at which points they planted artillery and opened a very heavy fire upon open our lines without any serious damage to us. that night he withdrew from these positions, our skirmish line was re-established, and a working party placed on the hill near Tucker's to fortify it, which party was driven off with our skirmishers on the 7th, when a furious artillery fire was again opened upon our line, with but little damage. That night orders were given to General Potter to retake the hill. Dispositions were made, and as our troops advanced the enemy fell back, after which the position was strongly fortified.

On the 8th Major-General Crittenden, commanding First Division, was relieved at his own request, and the command devolved on Brigadier-General Ledlie. During the four succeeding days the ordinary artillery firing and sharpshooting was kept up, and preparations were made for the movement to the left, which commenced on the 12th.

During this epoch our losses were as follows: First Division, 67 killed, 341 wounded, 209 missing; Second Division, 109 killed, 573

wounded, 64 missing; Third Division, 262 killed and wounded, 1 missing.*

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.
