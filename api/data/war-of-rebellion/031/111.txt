Brigadier General CHARLES GRIFFIN,

Commanding Division:

GENERAL: The commanding general directs that you do not move to cross the river without further orders.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. KIRKLAND,

Major and Aide-de-Camp.

TYLER'S BATTERY,

December 13, 1862-1.30 p.m.

General BURNSIDE:

One of our brigades has just fallen back to the outside edge of the town. One body of our troops did not budge. I think a battery has just gone to the front. It has just opened. Willcox's corps is in motion.

G. R. FEARING,

Captain and Aide-de-Camp.

DECEMBER 13, 1862-2.50 p.m.

General BURNSIDE:

The dispatch just sent from General Hardie tells much that I know. I am returning, by request of General Franklin, to give intelligence from him. He thinks it impossible to advance on his right and front at this time.

J. M. CUTTS,

Aide-de-Camp.

DECEMBER 13, 1862-7.15 p.m.

General BURNSIDE:

GENERAL: There is nothing new here. Doubleday anticipates an attack on our left to-night, but I do not. The guns you hear from this direction are his. My left is very weak, on account of batteries of the enemy which enfilade us badly. Hardie can tell you all about us.

Respectfully,

W. B. FRANKLIN,

Major-General.

TYLER'S BATTERY,

[December 13], 1862-4 o'clock.

Major-General BURNSIDE:

G. R. FEARING,

Captain and Aide-de-Camp.

DECEMBER 13, 1862-4.50 p.m.

General BURNSIDE:

General Franklin is again hotly engaged along his whole front, or rather his left and center. On the right our troops do not seem to get
