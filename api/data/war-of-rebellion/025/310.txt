HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE TENNESSEE,Jackson, Tenn., October 30, 1862.

General DAVIES, Columbus, Ky.:

I doubt much finding Morgan at Hopkinsville, or any other force in or near the number represented. Your forces should move cautiously, however, as if the whole number represented were there, and ascertain from the people as much as they can of the enemy. If Morgan is there he will likely run; it is not his policy to fight, but to plunder and interrupt our lines of communication as much as possible.

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General.

CORINTH, October 30, 1862.

Major-General GRANT:

Enemy had strong cavalry pickets yesterday 5 miles east of Ripley, on the Rienzi road; too strong to be driven in by our scouts. Thirty-eighth Alabama Regiment was sent to Mobile by Pemberton on the 21st. Another train has been put on the road between Mobile and Tupelo; it looks as though the force at Ripley was covering a movement over to the Mobile and Ohio road.
