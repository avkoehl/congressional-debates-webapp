Report of the Secrelary of the Treasury—Mr. Wri^h*.
Senate.
a fractionies  than one million of dollars, and not !!
oae-sevenih of the amount outs anditig undei ihe
"military" head And yet, when it is remember-
ed thai in this mode of comparison the entire ap
propnaiions. for the curren' year are deducted and
supposed to be wholly unexpended, although the
expenses of one-sixth part of the year have bee 
actually paid, this balance mast apt-ear amply suf-
ficient to meet any probable contingency tor the
remaining portion of the 5 ear, and much more
likely, m the absence of aay unanticipated call for
enlarged expenditure, to remain in the Treasu/y
than to be taken from it. Indeed he was happy to
hare it in his power to refer to the autnonty of the
present Secretary of the Navy upon this point
That officer says, m his report 10 the Presi lent, ac-
companying the menage to the present Congress
'The appopuationsmade at the iast session ofTonfiie^will
be found amply sufficient to cover the e\penditutes fn the

extraordinary con vocation of Congres , 1- not 10 be
found in connection with he raval service, so far
as appropriations aie CuiivtrneJ, do he Secretary
confines himself in express language to ' th>- ap-
propriations made at tne last session of CongrcsV'
and pronounces them " amply sufficient" tor ihe
present aniieipated w<tnts, thus excluding, as nit
wanted exiept in case of «ome unanticipated con-
tingency,  the above balance o  old appr( pnauons
There was a small outstanding aDpropna'irn f
former yeats under another head, which he «ould
mention m 'his co.mecaon, becau e he should be
caPed upon hereafter to make a smg'e "em rk m
relation to what seemed tjhitnto be a - inguUi u*e
made of ¡hi* unexpended ba'ance by the Honcrable
Secretary He ¡eterrrd to the head of "Public
Debt'' The tftcretary sets down, in his account
ot appropriations outstanding «nd un xp-n led on
the 4th of March, $6,387,50, under this heed No
new app'opnation was p'ade for the year 1841,
applicable to this object, and the small amount of
the old, would at once show to Senators that it
was not an appropriation intended for th  redemp-
tion of Treasury notes issued under the late laws.
Mr W understood it to be applicable to tne small
remain-, ot the old national debt, sach as the final
settlement certificates and indents of int. .est oí
the Revolution, and perhaps the outstandrbg Trea-
sury notes ef the last war
He would now examine, buefly as he might,
the items and objects of the ne* appropriations
recommended by the Secretary for the service o'
this year, and the aspect given to 'ome of the pro
posed expenditures by that officer Tne first ■ tern
was one of $1,435 500, to be expended upon forti-
fications and works of defence Tm  object of ex-
penditure hal not been oveilooked by Congress at

atriouit necessary to discharge them, as well as to pay the
e-i penses of the agents employed as above stated, appears from
thereportoftheChiefof the Corps of .topographical Engl
neers to be $3'J,W 12"
Tne letter from the head of the Topographical Bu-
reau confirms this statement of the Secre ary, and
shows that $27,993 28 of the sum asked are for "ar-
rearages" up to 31st of May, 1841,andthe balance of
$12,003 84 is for current expenses after that day,
being tne day of the commencement of this pre-
sent session of Congress    This estimate for the
seven months to follow the 31st of May, will show
an  aveiage current   expenditure  per   month   of
£1,714 83, and, by consequence, that of the por-
tion of the appropriation proposed $5 144 49, have
been the current expenses ot the three months of
the new Adroims ration, thus leaving $22,848 97
as   "ar>earagcs" against the la i Administration.
Mi    «V   saui he was led to  this minuteness, bt-
em e we had heard much of a '-rest" to be made
mih' accoun s of tneTieasury,between the late and
pre ent Admimstratio>qs,and he had been one of those
who joined with that suggestion, and was only now
anxious that the line of "rest" and the   line  of
tihih might cor-espond, and both be equally clear.
In furtherance of thi* disposition, and to make hi 
own fiaures intelligible, he must also notice a dis-
crep uicy of sums between that assumed by the
head ot the Topographical Bureau and the Secre-
tary ol War, and that presented by the Secretary
oí th- Treasuty in his report    The two former
stae   the appiopromiation n quired for "arrear-
ages" and lor cutrent service at $39,997 12, and
the latter, in his estimate of ntw appropriations,
in me report under consideration, gives it at $40,-
199 12     Tne diffeience is simply $202 00, but it
is a difference wlucnhe was unable to explain, and
thereiore u became him to say that he had taken
the sum ?sHtu.ed by the Topograpl ical Engineer
má i he Secretary ot War, and mae'e his division
and "rest"fiom their data.
A single item oí the new appropriations recom-
mended remained That, however, was a material
item in its amount, in it, objects, and in the desig-
nauen given to it by the Secretary ot the Treasu-
ry, fne amount of the item is $825,637 86, the
objeas such a, a e to be explained, and the desig-
naiu n ot the Secretary "for arrearages for prevent-
ing , nd suppressing Indian hostilities "
fht obpes of the expenditure firt demand al
termor, and the amoun s and prorer designation
wnl be fully developed in this examination. He
would refer, ¡hen, first, to the estimates of the Pay-
master General, attached to the report of the Se-
cretary of War, and constituting one of the docu-
menis'appended to the President's message. The
fi-st item ot the estimate is in the following words:
