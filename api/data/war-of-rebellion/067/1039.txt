Early on the morning of May 5 this command was put in motion, attending Heth's and Wilcox' division, of the Third Corps, down the plank road toward the Wilderness, Poague's battalion in front. Heth's division, in the advance, having encountered a portion of the enemy's cavalry. Richards' battery was pushed forward and assisted in driving it back upon the main body. The head of column on the plank road, having about midday reached an opening to the left about 2 miles from the crossing of the Brook road, was halted, and observation from that opening, which was an elevated ridge, having exhibited the enemy in force near the intersection of the Germanna road and old turnpike, dispositions were made for an front where the artillery could be used the general chief of artillery, with approval of the commanding general, directed Poague's guns, as a precautionary measure, to be place in position. One gun of this battalion was also advanced down the plank road a few hundred yards to Heth's line of battle, and was effectively used in the bloody repulse given by Heth and Wilcox that afternoon to a very heavy assault of the enemy.

aThese battalions, which had wintered near Cobham's and Lindsay's Depots, Virginia Central Railroad, Aldermarle County, received orders to march on May 4, and bivouacked that night Verdierville, on the plank road between Orange Court-House and Fredericksburg, except Cutt's battalion, which had wintered near Rapidan Station, on the Orange and Alexandria Railroad, on picket duty, and was directed to remain with Anderson's division, of the Third Corps, serving as a rear guard to the army.
