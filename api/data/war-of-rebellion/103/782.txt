GENERAL ORDERS, HDQRS. DEPARTMENT OF KENTUCKY, No. 5. Louisville, Ky., February 27, 1865.

Officers charged with recruiting colored troops are informed that the use of force or menaces to compel the enlistment of colored men is both unlawful and disgraceful. Several cases of this kind have been reported to these headquarters and are under investigation. The able-bodied men of the State are enrolled, and have the right to volunteer for the service of the country. In this respect there is no difference on account of color. No man can be forced into the service unless in pursuance of law. Any violence or threats toward white or black men to compel them to enlist will be severely punished. No bounty broker will be allowed to accompany any recruiting party or in any other way intermeddle with their operations.

By command of Major-General Palmer:

G. M. BASCOM,

Major and Assistant Adjutant-General.
