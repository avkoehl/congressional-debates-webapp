Major General JOHN A. DIX, Fort McHenry, Baltimore.

Honorable WILLIAM H. SEWARD, Secretary of State.

SIR: I was glad to get the intercepted letters just received, one of which us signed Isaac G. Mask. I have had this man's letters for a month but they were all signed I. G. M., and with all our efforts we have been unable to identify him. I have ordered his arrest and will send him to Fort Lafayette to-morrow. He ought to be hanged. His is a clear case of treason as defined by the Constitution.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOHN A. DIX,
