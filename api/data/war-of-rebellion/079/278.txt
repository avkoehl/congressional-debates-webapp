NASHVILLE, October 14, 1864.

Brigadier General R. S. GRANGER,

Decatur, Ala.:

Please report whether your scouts have been able to learn anything of the movements of the enemy on the south side of the river. I wish the country well scouted, and every movement discovered and reported at once.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding.

DECATUR, October 14, 1864.

Major-General THOMAS:

Nothing definite from Gadsden or Blountsville. Scouts from Gadsden and Blountsville not yet returned. Additional scouts sent to Blountsville yesterday from up the river. Can learn nothing of movements of Forrest except the supposition of officers returned from Florence that he had gone to Memphis. Gun-boats arrive daily and report the usual force along the river above, some 500 or 600. Received a communication from Roddey yesterday, dated 11th, from Tuscumbia. Cavalry force at the post too small to venture beyond seven or eight miles WEST and Summerville to the east. Scouts out daily, but learn nothing.

R. S. GRANGER,

Brigadier-General.

NASHVILLE, October 14, 1864-10. 15 p. m.

(Sent 9 a. m. 15th.)

Brigadier General R. S. GRANGER,

Decatur, Ala.:

If the FIFTY-second Kentucky Regiment Mounted Infantry is at Athens or at Huntsville, or in that vicinity, let them turn over their horses to Colonel Johnson's regiment Indiana cavalry. The FIFTY- second and Forty-ninth Regiments Kentucky, which I understand are mounted, can both turn over their horses to the Eleventh and Thirteenth Regiments Indiana Cavalry, as far as they will supply them, and you can then send the remaining portion of the Indiana regiments to General Johnson to be remounted. Acknowledge receipt, reporting what you can do toward mounting above-named regiments.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding.

DECATUR, October 14, 1864.

Major-General THOMAS:

The following dispatch has just been received from Colonel Thornburgh, who went up to Bridgeport day before yesterday on gun- boat:

BRIDGEPORT, October 14, 1864.

General GRANGER:

The Fourth Alabama Cavalry are picketing the river between Fort Deposit and Guntersville. They came recently. Rebel home guards and scouting parties are moving from Lebanon toward Guntersville. I sent a scout from Larkin's Landing, who will report to you.

R. S. GRANGER,

Brigadier-General.
