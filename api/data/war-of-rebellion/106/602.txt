Captain, Third Artillery, Commanding Post.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF OREGON, Fort Vancouver, Wash. Ter., September 2, 1863.

Colonel R. F. MAURY,1st Oreg. Cav., Commanding Expedition against Snake Indians, Fort Boise, Idaho Ter.:

COLONEL: I approve of your proposition (in your very interesting and satisfactory letter of the 8th ultimo) to go the headwaters of the Owyhee and Malheur Rivers. * So far as your time and means will permit, I am satisfied that any operations in that quarter will be well directed. Complaints of the hostile acts of the Snake Indians south of Auburn have reached me and a memorial for troops sent, through the Governor of Oregon. If on your way back you find yourself able to take a turn in that direction, it will no doubt be important for the peace of the frontiers.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

BENJ. ALVORD,

Brigadier-General, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding District.
