My re-enforcements have all arrived. I am now ready for Lee and Rosser. Thoburn is yet safe at Petersburg. The enemy have kept beyond the reach of his guns. As soon as the men get rested we will relieve Thoburn. The railroad, telegraph line, and public property are yet all safe-9 a. m.

They report their failure to take Petersburg, New Creek, and Cumberland to be because they could not get their artillery forward, in consequence of the roads. They had no train; were compelled to subsist on the country. They have suffered terribly. The raid thus far to them has been severe, while they have not been able to inflict any injury on us.
