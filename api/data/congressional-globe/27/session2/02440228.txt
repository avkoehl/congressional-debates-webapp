Mr GENRTY asked the common consentoi the Hoiue to

Mr SALTONSTALL addressed a remark to the Chair,
(again inaudible to the Reporter)—
When Mt GENTRY wi'hdrew his motion to suspend the
rules, with the intention, he said, of renewing it on koine other
occasion
So the motion was withdrawn                          /
Air MEDiLL (hen moved that the rules of the House he
suspended, for the purpose of enabling his resolutions tobe
considered.
Some conversation followed—
When Mr FILLMORE suggested to Mr Medill that he
should include m the wquuy any reports that might have been
made He (Mr F ) did not wish to suppress any part of the
information, hut he wanted to see whether, by reason of these
investigations, any thins had been discovered
Mi LEWIS WILLIAMS called for the reading of the leso
lutions, which having been read-
Mr STANTY said he should object He wished the teso
lutions to he over until to moirow, that he might offer an
amendment He wanted a little more infoimation about the
same thing
Mr BRIGGS hoped that the resolutions would be suffered to
he ovei,and that they would be printed
And, after a brief conversation, the íesolutions were ordered
to lie over and be orinted
Thefirst business m order during the morning hour-was
the resolution heretofoieieported by Mr Satomstaix, fiom
the Committee on Blanufacuies, authorizing that committee to
employ a cierk
Mi SALTONSTALL said that, in the opinion of the com-
mittee, the services of a cleik were not meiely important,
but essential to the convenient and proper discharge of the
business before them The House had, after a long debate,
refeirud so much of the President's Message and the dccom
panning documents as related to discriminating duties to the
Committee on Manufactures The committee weie, theieiore,
tomvp>,tigate the subjects connected with discnminatien m the
adjustment of the tanff They had,several weeks ago, a^ked
foi leave to summon witnesses and take tes'imony inspecting
the greatinteiestsmvolved in the subject That resolution was,
to his great surprise and regret, rejected yesterday As it was
uncertain when it would be disposed of by the House, the com
mittee had decided to collect information on the subjects undei
their consideiation fiom such intelligent practical men as might
comebefore them, and from a conespondence with others ¡3e
veral persons have been examined, and much valuable infor
mauon has been obtained 1 here is (said Mr S > a lai ge fife of
letters and statements fiom merchants and manufictureis m
relation to a home valuation, a warehousing system mconnec
turn with cash paympota, and íespecting diffeient manufactur
mg inteiests &c Many petitions and memorials have also
been refeired to them, some o! which are long, and containing
valuable statistical information All the<*emust be carefully
examined and digested, and the labois of the committee, which
moot, at any rate b" arduous will be gieatly lessened by the
employment of a faithful, intelligent clerk. Immensely impor
tantquestions have been reipned to the committee What do
the House expect of thenV* Information is wanted Great in

The H >use ought to giant the committee all lea^onable (acdi
ties m the peifoi manee of their dutie=>, and he cou'd not believe
t lat their request for authon v to um^loy a c'eik cou]d be re-
fused He repeated that, in his opinion, and that of a large ma-
jority of the committee ltisessentni They have alieady ma
tpri ds on han i foi tht diligent employment of a Ueik ior many
days
Mi A V BROWN said he wasamembei of the committee,
and desired to make a few observations on the adoptio t ol this
reso'ution He was not surprised at the introduction of 'u.
pioposition for a cleik to that committee At the time of its
introduction, theie was a pr >pnsinon be ore the House to dii
thon/e the committee to send for and take the examination of
witnesses To áo this, theie might be some propuety in ask
mg for the assistance of a clerk But on yesterday the Hou«e
refused to authorize the committee to send tor witnesses and to
take testimony What occasion could there be now foi the
emp oyment ofacleik'í The honorable chairman now speaks
of going on m taking testimony in the face of this decision of
the Hou&e Tins seems to be astiangean lunauthotized course
by the committee 1 he House says 'you shall not send lor
witnesses in ths case " the committee replies "true but if
they come of their own accor I we will examine them " The
House detei mines that the committee shall not administer ihe
necessary oatt s, to give valid ty to the testimony—the mm
mittee defermmp that they will take the testimony infkout
oath ot affidavit Sir what i  t ns but a contempt ofieied to
the aMho lty of this House? What but the rankest usurpa
tionofpowei by one of the committees of this House1
Nothwithstanding the intimation of the chairman, he (Mr
B ) i ould not think it probable that the eomn lttee would per
si^t in«n unwiu mtable a cour^ of piocedure If, luwe^er,
he should be mistaken in this, «nil there could be no^ortüf ne
ceteuy foi this appointment No one could doubt on this sub
jt-ct wlio would icfiect d moment on the mole ofpioceedingb,
nor only m this but all the othei c mmutees ol th a House At
the appointe \ hour all ihe membci s a^emb'e in thp ioom take

ioToUf h lac sas he 1 el eves tj be true or nnp'i tant to b con
«ldered Isow sir in all this process, what use en theie 1 p to
the committee to ha\e a cl^ik 7 Is it too much Ubot foi each
member to perfoi in to ake down sm h notes of the testimony?
It is precisely sjch laoor a*, all oui padtrps and lawyersreiforin
in evety importa it trial in our cmts Why should not we per
foi m equal labor m the peilormance of our dunes here? "-ir,
the price to be paid to this cle k is not too mcon'-iderab e a sum
to b© mentioned here Four dollars a day for some ninety or
one bundled days may well be saved m these times of economy
and reform especially wnen the same s>ei vices can b as well
nay, better peifoirned by the committee themselves He would
not charge lhat this appointment was intended foi some needy
favorite, hanging about the capítol for employment, but he
would say there was no sort of necessity for creating a mero
sinecure like this.
t He could not imagmt but one leading obiect for pressing thisr
appointment so earnestly on the Hou^-p Look to the structure
of that committee only two fiomtheSouth and ©ne (himself)
from all the mighty State? of the West; the other six from the
North, including Pennsylvania Could any one doubt what
sort of a bill would be finally reported by such a committteel
Now, sir, it may be desired to collect a vast volume of testimo-
ny to lay before the public to sustain such a bill If so, a clerk
might well be thought neceesaiy, to imkp out the compiJaiiori.
But, sir, could such ex pane statements be worth the printing?
Statements made by interested persons, whose whole fortunes
may depend on the testimony which they volunteer before the
committee He would never vote a dollai in the publication of
such a budget, nor would he pay four dollars a day to a cleric
to make Hout He therefoie hoped the resolution would not be
adopted
Mr RANDOTPHsaid it was stranee that the subject of the
tariff could not be alluded to in this House even incidentally
without exciting opposition Yesterday the Hou*e had re.
fu ed to give the Committee on Manufactures powei to send
for witnesses and take testimony even, and now the power to
appoint a cierk wasasf*u!ed This course of proceeding waa
certainly stranse, after the Hou*e had commuted to the Com-
mittee on Manufactures that portion of the President's Message
relating to discriminating duties Why, whatweiethecom-
mittee to do' The American unfT was uní ke that of Great
Britain, m that ten ameles produced nine ter the of the revenue
arising fiom custom^ but our tariffembraced over thirty seven
hundred varieties of articles, on which the committee was re-
quned by the House to repoit a bill for disciinunat ng duties.
How were they to do this without piacutal lrformation'* The
refusal yesteid iy to giant the power to take evidence, bo lar from
bemgan aignment ag uiM-thia íesoh tion, as was supprsed by
ihe gentleman from Tennes-,ee, [Mr Brown,] is anargument
in its favor The mfoimauon must be ob uncd by correspon-
dence and by voluntaiy examinations,am ior 'his ¡heservices
of a clerk were essential But the gentleman would have the
committee net without information—like the taskmas era of
Egypt, he would require the brick without the material to make
them He should, m his liberality, Mr K said, go one step
further, and, like a jury enrpannelled to try a cause, he should
have an officer sworn to attend the committeee, and keep them
in some private place, without meat or drink, water only ex-
cepted, and not to speak to them himself or suffer any
other peo son to speak to them, until they had agited upon
their report But the committee were not all like the gentle-
man The needed light But he when it ispioposed to autho-
nse the committee to take evidence, objects—the expense is too
gieat. The expense'yes, the expense of hundreds, when mil-
lions, nay, the inteiests of the while country, are at stake1 He
objects to the powei to send f>r and examine witnesses under
oath, because the infoimation can he obtained otherwise, and
when a cleik isa^ked for to obtain that information, i hen he
object* to that also because tht House refused to authorize the
committee to send foi witi e -pi Tbi  was certainly strange,
but pero dps not more ^oihan the objection of tbe gentleman
to the composition of the Lommittee—that a majority of them
were in favor of protection Why, how should they be'* A
maioiity against piotection'i Were not all ihe committees or-
ganized u¡ on t e same principle1 Look at those on the pub
lie lands and on comroeice If any persons were dissatisfied
with the committee, the manufacturers ihemselves might be;
oi h^ believed there was not a single rnanuf-ictuier, or person
engi^ed m manufactures on the committee, dud not above one
member who represented a deci leed y manufacturing constitu-
ency The chairman came fioma commercial district, and six
oi =even members lepresented apicultura! districts
Mi R said th committee not only waned in ormation on the
subject of dibcnmiodin g dwip'-, but on that of home valuation
also, foi noon Iv beemtd to u deisund what that meant, or
how it Viae to he ctrned out Scarcely any tw o persons agreed
on that matter, and how were the c< ro mittee to agree or act
without some ii/oimation^ The Senate, Mr II said, had
granted their Committee on Manufactures a clei k, almost with-
out a division and yet that committee had compaiatively noth-
ing to do, for the bill being'or revenue, must come from the
committee of this House. Will the House then refuse what the
Sena e have grantedl Mr R said that the power m itself to
appoint a clerk wa« one of small importance, and he should
have remained sifcnnt but foi the ground taken in opposition
He trusted however thattheiesolutum would pas  the House.
