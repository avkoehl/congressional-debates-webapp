DANA.

HOOKER'S HEADQUARTERS, November 24, [1863]-1.25 p.m.

Major-General REYNOLDS:

In announcing the fact of our great success this morning I had no time to state its results. The conduct of all the troops has been brilliant, and the success has far exceeded my expectations. Our loss has not been severe, and of prisoners I should judge that we had not less than 2,000. The bulk of my infantry is now assembling on the east side of Lookout Mountain. Of course the routes do not admit of the passage of artillery.

HOOKER,

Major-General.
