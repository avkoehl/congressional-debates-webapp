CHARLOTTE, N. C., February 23, 1865-7 p. m.

Brigadier General A. C. GARLINGTON,

On Way to Camden, S. C.:

(Care of General Hampton.)

Enemy's movement being reported eastward toward Catawba River, it is advisable you should report fortwith to General Hampton at or about Chesterville with the forces under your command, for the defense of that potion of the State of South Carolina now threatened.

G. T. BEAUREGARD.

General R. E. LEE,

Petersburg, Va.:

General beauregard telegraphs from Charlotte, the 23rd instant, as follows:

Enemy's movement from Winnsborough toward Catawba River seems to be more positive. He has withdrawn from vicinity of Chesterville, which will enable Cheatham and Stewart to reach here via Newberry and Unionville. Enemy may now probably move on Chewar and Fayetteville. I have given orders accordingly to General Hardee. Could not all our forces be united at once against Grant?

This indicates that Sherman's main column is directed to the east. It may be that he has not advanced beyond Columbia and will move for supplies to Wilmington.

General J. E. JOHNSTON:

Enemy may be making for the Pedee Valley in search of subsistencfe. Hardee, in Cheraw, would be in position and could destroy all which cannot be removed. Horses, mules, and cattle should be driven out of reach.
