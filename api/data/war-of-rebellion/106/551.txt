COLONEL: I have the honor to acknowledge receipt of your favor of 23rd ultimo, and to inform you that the following detachment from Camp Drum is encamped upon the outskirts of Los Angeles, under the command of Captain E. W. Hillyer, namely: Company E (Hillyer's), Fourth California Volunteer Infanrry, 3 officers, 67 men; Company C (West's), Fourth California Volunteer Infantry, detachment, 1 officer, 25 men. Total, 4 officers, 92 men.

The site suggested by general commanding for a camp was unfitted for the following reason: The orcahrd and vineyard close adjoining are fileld with ripe fruit, unportected, and offering great temptation to the men; the running water is distrubed and unfit for drinking. A site was selected on the river at the crossing of the Mone road a mile from center of town. Captain Johnson being the only officer remaining at Camp Morris after the departure of Major Bennett, I have assigned Second Lieutenant Arnold from Captain Whannell's company to that for duty temporarily.

Veryr esepctfully, your obedient servant,
