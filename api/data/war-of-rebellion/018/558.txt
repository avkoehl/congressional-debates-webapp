HDQRS. THIRD ARMY CORPS, ARMY OF VIRGINIA,In advance of Culpeper, August 10, 1862.

Brigadier General RUFUS KING,

Commanding Division:

You will march forward as rapidly as possible toward Culpeper Court-House as far as Stevensburg; then take the road from that place to Windsor [?] Court-House, and send forward word to me on your arrival at Stevensburg.

The enemy is in great force in front of us and we are now engaged.

Leave your wagons with sufficient guard to follow up and push forward day and night until you join us. It is all-important that you should be here as soon as possible.

By command of Major-General McDowell:

ED. SCHRIVER,

Colonel and Chief of Staff.

NEAR CEDAR RUN,

August 10, 1862-1.15 p. m.

Major-General MCDOWELL:

GENERAL: General Pope directs me to say that he thinks it best you should make the cavalry reconnaissance toward Crooked River and, if possible, Somerville Ford, mentioned in his conversation with you this morning. Major Meysenberg, assistant adjutant-general of General Sigel, will explain to you why this is rendered desirable.

GEO. D. RUGGLES,

Colonel and Chief of Staff.

CAMP NEAR PONY MOUNTAIN,

August 10, 1862-3 p. m.

Major-General MCDOWELL, Headquarters:

GENERAL: I am, in pursuance of your orders, on the road to Raccoon Ford; have made two reconnaissances, and find a body of cavalry with a battery, 2,000 strong, on the railroad about 2 miles north of Mitchell's Station. They have been up the railroad this morning toward Culpeper Court-House, but have returned, and are camped within 2 miles of me. They came to Raccoon Ford, but did not cross, and retired.

I am entirely unprotected if they attack, and some infantry is necessary for the safety of my command.

DUFFIE,

Colonel.
