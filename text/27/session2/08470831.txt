Mr. HOPKINS objected to the immediate con-
sideration of the bill, on ihe ground that he wished
te have time to examine it
Mr C J INGERSOLL begged leave to Mate,
in addition to what had been said by the gentleman
from New York, that it was a bill of great urgency,
and it was important that it should be passed at
once.
Messrs GWIN, SHIELDS, and CROSS, asked
the gentleman from Virginia to withdraw his ob-
jections, and urged the necessity of the speedy
passage of the bill.
The SPEAKER observed that the bill would be
taken up in its order to-morrow, and,
On motion by Mr BARNARD, it was ordered to

The SPEAKER said that the regular order was
the report of the select committee in relation to the
letter of the Secretary of War, in answt r to the
resolution ot tne House calling for the evidence
furnished the department in tbe report of Lieut
Col Hitchcock.
Mr GWIN did not rise to en er into the menta
of the difference between the Secretary of War and
the Committee on Indian Affairs. He believed
the Secretary wa-= right in refusing to send ex parte
statements to this House, implicating toe charac er
of individuals, who had no chance of defending
themselves against the chaiges made agamM them
He knew none of the parties, and knew nothing of
the charges Tbay were ex parle—made upon
statements unaccompanied with the solemnity of
an oath, to which the parties criminated had had
no opportunity to leply, which, when they came
here, would be pub ished to the world, ard ihou
sands who would r ad them, would np-ver se« lb 
defence of the parties, if they had been nnjustly
charged He would «ant-lion no such action on
the part of tne House, and would defend any offi-
cer of the Government for resitting it If the Sec
retary intended to suppress information, the case
would be different, but such was not charged Ht
believed the Secretary was prosecuting th° in-
quiry, and would hold the culpaole to a rigid
accountability, and would be prepa ed to report
to the House when the record was complete
It was now imperfect, and would not present the
facts, and might inflict great injustice upon indi-
viduals He instanced reports emanating from
¿his Honse and the Senate, that bad done great in
justice to hic constituents—having been founded on
ex parle evidence One bad emanated from a com-
mutee of the House this session Tne members
had been led astray by the testimony of a clerk in
one of the departments The committee had, very
properly and ptomp ly, corrected ihe s^ror when
po nted out to ihem, but ihe first report had gone
out to the country, and the counter-report had only
been published within a few day*, although made
months ago, and then at the instance of a relative
of one of the parties accused. He further alluded
to reports made by commibsions established m
his Sta*e many years ago, by the Senate of the
United S ales—reports made upon ex parte state-
ments, that proved to be false in almost every in-
stance, implicating the character ot individual-.
Yet these commissioners (who, no doubt, believed
that their statements were made upan proper
¡oundation, because they had evidence only
on one side) brought down upon themselves the
vengeance ot those who considered themselves un-
justly assailed, and many lives were lost by Ihe
personal encounter? that ensued The feuds thus
created still ex sted, and would, during the live* of
the parties A uisanguished ctizen of the State
(now a member of the Senate of the United States)
was one of tbe individuals assailed in those re
ports, and such was the indignation of the people
of the State at the Mtempt to destroy bis character
that he was brought íorwaid ¿s a candidate lor the
station to which nenas elevated, and now fill",
al h< ugh he had n >t ihe moM remote idea of being
a candidate before he was ihus impioperly brought
bete re the public He had rracic.il experience of
the fatal eff^c s of tx parte accu-aüoi s, and wonl 1
never courtenauce ihem, come from what quarter
they may The Secretary had only done his duty
in withholding papers that might, if published,
ha\e done an mjuiy to citiz ns of the United States,
and published ibey wo'tid en tain ly hive been, if
sent here When he gets all tbe informa'ion in
the cases under investigation, and then refuses to
communicate it to th * House, he would join with
the cha rman ot the Committee on Ind an Affairs
in censuring the Secretary He had no doubt but
that no such contirgency would happen Th  Sec-
retpry had no motive to seek a collision with the
House, or suppress investigation
Mr CUSHING vent into a long and elaborate
explanatory statement, and argued the propriety of
this House discussing the Executive, as had be-
come so commoi There was a rule of tne House
which prohibited this House discussing the Senate
or its individual memb rs, and there would be as
much propnetv m tbe Executive discussing the
conduct ot members of this House, as there was in
this House diicussin?, as was often done, the Ex-
ecutive The passage of declaratory resolutions
formed n > part of their legislative duties, but occa-
sioned their obstruction He di«cuss"d the charac-
ter of die proeeeding of the House in wh cb they
were engaged, and contended that, if Ite House
could demand pape s ¡rorn the Ex"cutiv, the Ex
ecutive could demand papers in the possession of
the House Th Judiciary, a'so, would b* subj et
to t> e e demand But it was a nugatory light i
vhere theie ft as no mode of en!o cement He I

Mtc idenee of in- arm i es at SpriL^fielc and Har
per'  Ferry, and establishing a military superintend-
ence, and spok  at much l°ngth, and wi a great
earnestness, m opposition to that section
Mr SPRIGG, aíícr some preliminary observa
lions oa tbe difficulty oí making reductions in the
army and navy, went into an examination of the
complaints of the armorers at Harper'  Ferry, and
staled that, since the armory had been placed under
military superintendence, the arms had cost (he
Government several dollars apiece moie than
when thev uere under civil superintendence
Mr GOGGSN replied, and showed that, by acts
of Congress of some years past, these armories
were placed under the superintendence and control
of die Ordnance Department, and he said it was
a perfect ano-naly that a military establishment
should ever hate been under the control e,f a mere
civilian It had been the custom, under ihe civil
superintendence, for the men to work when they
pleased, and cease from work when they pleased,
and not unfrequently the machinery was kept go-
ing for the accommodation of one single man It
was to put an end to such a state of things, and to
save the Governmtnt from loss, and to establish a
system of uniformity, that tbe legalized system was
enforced He went into a minute statement and
examination of ihe matters in difference, with
which he occupied his hour
Mr CALHO0N addressed the committee in op-
position to tbe second section of the bill, and com-
mented  on  the irjustice done to the armorers by
changing the superintendence of the armorie      He
<i nsidered thi  a question of personal rights, and a
question whether the military should be placed over
the civil departments of the Government,—whether
free i en should be subjected to the despotic rule of
military tyrants    The origin of all the difficulties
in relation to  these armories, (Mr C   said,) was
the introduction ol a ne v musket from France, in
place of the. c'd one, whirh, in every respect, was
just ps good, if not better, but was not so mghly or-
n vaunted and so highly polished    A committee of
officers (of whom this Lieutenant Tyler was one)
had been sent to Europe, at an expense of some
$15,000, without any autnority of law whatever,
and they, on their retuin, introduced the model of
a new musket which they found in the French ser-
vice    Now, the standard mu'ket, which had bees
in use for so d any  5 ears, was conceded, on all
handr, to be as good and as serviceable a musket
as any in the world, and cost not more than ten or
eleven dollar , but yet it was made to give place to
the new one, which, requiring a higher polish, and
more orrament, could  not be made for less than
sixteen or seventeen  dollar     Now, in  order to
make up for the additional expenses ireurred in
this way, the ordnance corps fell  upon the un-
offending armorers,  and determ ned  to  make it
up from their hard earnings    This (Mr C said)
was the origin of the vihole  difficulty     He took
the occasion to s¿y lhat he dil  not speak as the
representative of these men, but as a citizen—as a
man professing to have   ome ot the feelings of
humanity, for he acdared befoie God  and the
country, that if ever there was oppression prac-
ticed on  human beings, it was practised on these
unoffending- arrr-orers by ihe officers of the army.
He would give one  gross and flagrant instance of
oppression  and injustice, out of many others, to
show  the  Hou'e   lhat  these  men did not com-
|  plain   without  some reason      Upon   the  lntro-
duciion of thi  military rule at the armenes,  it
I   0 ame me p easure of the military chief at Spring-
field to introduce a vanef  of order-, whic 1 were
found by the workmen   to be so oppressive that
