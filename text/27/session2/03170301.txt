man desired to speak, to postpone the resolutions until to mor
row, with the understanding that they would then take them
up, and proceed with their consideration, fi om day to day, until

The gentleman from Virginia [Mr Wise] had been understood
by him (Mr McK ) to inquire why was this re enacted, if it was
a permanent lawl It w is not a permanent law, it wat, so set
tied by those who construe our laws, and those who will have
the execution of our laws He hoped tin  would be sufficient
answer to ihetnqulry
The expediency of this proviso had been already settled by
votes of gentlemen on this floor By referring to the Journal of
1839 we would discover by whose votes were inserted on the ap
propnation bill of that year, the proviso that this print ng should
be done by contract, and given to the lowest bidder A moiion
was made to strike the restriction out The motion was to
s like out the proviso, which he believed was m the veiy words
of the provision under debate The motion was rejected by
votes of the gentlemen, whose names he would lead if in order
so to do Some of them were members of this House

Mr STANLY wished to know what the gentleman was read

ceiving a petition to dissolve the Union, or m favor of receiving
a petition from r egroesl
Mr McKEON said he was reading the votes of gentlemen
on the motion to strike ouf with a view to show that tnose who
had now the power would have an opportunity of íeasoertirig
the principle of the prov so
Mr McK said he had examined the history of this amend
menu, and found that it was adopted after a veiy severec ntest,
no only m this House, but between this House and the Senat
