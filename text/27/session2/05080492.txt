made by General Jackson, or by any person appearing to be

be itself an unwise one

on which they can undeitake to decide whetherthis mone> ought
or ought not, to be repaid They have no information on the
subject, exceptfrom oommon report, which iscontradictoiy in
some important particulars and they h ive not beaeved that it
constitutes a species of evidence on which Congress would be

Mr LIN V, m continuation, observed, that (he first objection
started aga net the bill was that ex PresiJent Jackson did not
hirgself ask to have the money refunded, an 1 that was very tm
usual here lie would reply to that, by asking the committee
who had a* plied fon the grant to Geneia! Harrison's family-
the first civil pension gi anted by th «3 Government to any indi
vidual for civil services,! He had presumed that the fact of the
infliction of thisfine on Geneial Jackson was a matter of gen-
eiai notoriety, and that the circumstances were all ¡so fully
known, that no individual preti tiding to*have the least acquaint
anee with the histoiy of the country could he unacq minted
with them, or rtrnam m the least doubt as to the manner m
which the fine Was ti flicted The only reason which could m
duce any doubt of thepiopnety of this bill wou'd have been,
whether G neral Jarkson would take the money if gianted by
Congress-, but that was now íemoved And as to what kind of
testimony would be ri qmsite to prove that he had paid the mo
ney he would ask any one in the United fc ates whethei he
would desne better testimony than th.it of Geneidl Jjekson
himsein All know the fine was paid by someone gentlerren
had, however, imag ned it was not paid by General Jaculo" U
any pi oof were wanted of that, he had the testimony which any
gentle-nan who denned might see—uvsas the word of Get eral
Jackbon himself nidepen lent of ahí ndance ^oihei evidence
As there could no longei b( any doubt on i hat point he sup
posed tne only question woul 1 be a& to piccedent Ol his, too,
1 e could adduce abundance of testimony, if «entlemen war'ed
it He could íefer to pitntv of evidence of that kind lie did
not believe gentjemen knew how mucn of Mich evidence he
could furnish
It would he useless for him to go into a his ory oi the pubic
life of General Jackson in support of thi« claim It wa- known
to eveiy one—none doubted tie piopnety oí íeíuudmg this
fine
Mr BCRUIEN said he was dcbiroii", as a member of the
Judiciary Committee to whom this bill had been referred tobe
put in possesion of nuthcr evidence He believed there was
every disposition on the pan of all the memhprs, of that com
mittee to acknowledge the distinguished services ren lered by
General Jack&on, but when a c aim came to be presented to
the Amencan Spnafe io" the {.ayimntof a sum of money fiom
the pubii Tieasury J was nece^saiv that that claim should he
decided upon by c^ram lules, w1 icn wereoi universal appli

to tha* committee I was a committee mstitu ed foi the purpose
of inquiring- into the priiicip'eeof law applicable to the beveral
suí fects retened to them Upon an examination of this claim,
they found in the f rst place that there had been, in fact, no
claim pieb nt-^d on the pan of General Jjekson He, himself,
had not astted that the money should be íefunded He would
ask, then, wa  it consistent with r ropuetv oi within the
spirit oí any míe by which Congress was governed in mat-
ters of (his, mature, that they should grant an application of
this s rt, not made on behalf of the md vidual to he benefited1*
ihe allowance made to the family of General Harrison
had been stated as a precedent, but that was entirely a different
ca&e General Harrison was an officer of the General Govern
merit, dying at the seat nf Government, while in the discbarge
ofhisoffical duüet. This necessarily forced itself upon the
consideration of he American Congress md resulted in a giant

oerof acommittee He was aware th*t thu fine had been im-
posed tor an alleged con empt on the part of General Tackaon
in the imprisonment of fudge Hdl, who had issued a writ of
ñateas corpus in behalf of a person who was in custody of the
military authorities    But, m order to authonze the finding of a f
leport by the Judiciary Committee in favor of paying this sum !
of money out of the nationalTreasury.it was necessary to in* \
quite into the legality of the whole proceedings relating to the  
case    And he would ask, if the statements in the public news-
papers were suífieie it evi 'ence^   lie apprehended that if the
committee in the ca=e of any p«iva e individual, had come be-
fóte the Senate Wi h arepoitiesting merely upon contempora-
neous periodical publications, or general rumui, or alleged no-
toriety, such lepmt would have been at once rejected by the
henate    The committee abstained, therefore, fiom expressing
any opinion as to the meats of the claim, and as it hadnotoeen
sustained bj ptoper evidence, they found themselves uiwbld to
recommend the passage of the bill
Mr WALKER said that he, as a member of the Judiciary
Com mil tee, did not eoncui iu the report of that committee It
would be recollected that when the Senator from Ohio intro-
duced this mM, he (Mr Walker) had united with him, both
by the remaiks which he had made in the Senate, and by hia
vote, m the proposition for instructing the committee to report
immediately upon the subject He was anxious that the mat-
ter should be acted upon by the committee at as eaily a period" .
as possible The subject, however, had unfortunately bepn
taken up by the committee, and a report agreed upon at a tune
whenhe(Mi W ) was confined by l'Iness not only to his house,
but to his bed, nor was he aware that a repoi t had been agreed
upon, uot! he saw it up>n the table If he had known that the
subject was to he taken up at that time, he would have asked the
n-avtlege of making a m noiity repoit, setting forth the facts of
theci&e He did not r oncur in any pait of the report which
had been made Tne objections against granting the money :
wer , it seemDd, m the fust place, rhat General Jackson had not
himself asked for it Iif (Mr W ) couM not but express hia
astonishment that tne Senator fiom Geoigia could have the
heart to make such an ohjection As that fine had been un
justly im rosed, and the money extrac'el from the pocket of
General Jaikson fir doing an act which deserved not punish-
ment, but the tharkt. of the whole country, was it not a matter
of undeniable jus cethat the money should be refunded7 But
the Senator was not wtf'mg ihat it should begianted until that
venerable hero himself ^huuld come forward, in the attitude of
«up} iKat on, an 1 humbly leqnest nf each individual member
of thitobody that he might be permitted to receivethat to which
he wa  bo pis ly e ¡ut ^d If this was the way in which an act
of justice was to be done, only on condition that Gen Jackson
would submit to the degradation of approaching the Senate
like isippliant with hat in Sand, he coul i assure honora«
bie S"! ators that it w iu d nevei take place Was this required
in'became of the allowance gi anted to the family of General
Ilamson'i Was theie any petiuon fromliis ht irsor represent-
atives^ He believed that, ii buch a thngbad been even sug-
ges'ed as the requ lementof such petition, it would not have
been senou-ly entertained foi a moment He, (Mr Walker,)
on that occasion had no he i ation m giving his vote fearlessly
and honestlj in favor of the giant But he appealed tothe&en
ator from Georgia to say what he would have thought if those
on the othsr side had uiged it as an objec ion, upon that occa-
sion that theie was no petition from ai y individual for the pay-
ment of the money
Well, what was the other objection'? That the committee
were isnoiant of the facts of the case Why, Mr President,
you niuhta-5V eM tell me that you are ignorant of the fact of
the battle of New Orl^ na having been fought and won It is
mattti of b st rv, and no committee of this or any other house
would think of takn g tes imony upon sjch a subject as this,
when itia a=> clearly established as any historical fact that Gen.
Jackson paid this fine I ha4 been so a^eited not by one his
tonana one, hut by at least five, who^e distinct accounts had
been published m books and sprepd before the Amencan people
The comroi'tee, if *hey deeircd to ascertain the facts, had
only to go to the Iilnary of Congie => and there they would
hdvefuuo.1 he whole record ceuified by tl ecleikof the court;
acomple e and cneumstir tial account, extracted from the judi-
cial record of all the proceedings in the case, including the writ
of habeas corpus, the charges piefeired, the mode and manner
of mat, the defence preferí ed by Geneial Jackson, the amount
of the fine, and the payment of the money It is all matter of
history as well as matter of ludicial record and I will venture
to say that no man wi 1 n&e and assert that he believes the
records have been un ruly published We cannot vote down
this bill, then on the aiound that all do not know *he facts No
mm can place his hand on his heart, and say conscientiously
that he doe  not know them Now, Mr President, I have
not gone into the merits of the caoe, nor &hall I do so, be
cause they are not questioned by the committee, but if
they were, I will still venture to assert that if there is any
one point en which tne opinions of the whole American people
will approach unanimity, it will be upon the injustice of the
imposition of this fine And there is another point upon which
there will be a still nearer approach to unanimity And it is
Thi«¡ th it if the technical puncipl^s of law required the fine to
ht imposed, nothing would be more ¡ust than, inasmuch as
General Jack&on incurred the fine in defending the country, and
