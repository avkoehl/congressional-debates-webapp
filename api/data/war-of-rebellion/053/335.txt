send cars to the rear. Can't the Louisville road do this kind of freighting without calling upon us for cars? It is hard to keep up both ends of this thing. Please see General Meigs, and decide upon what action you desire me to take. I will, of course, cheerfully obey any instructions I may receive, but I should like them to come from department headquarters. Hodges says I must not do anything t interfere with movements of forage.

Respectfully,

WM. P. INNES,

Colonel and Military Superintendent.

STEVENSON, October 13, 1863.

Lieutenant-Colonel HODGES,

Chief Quartermaster, Nashville:

General Hooker desires the transportation, artillery, and articles belonging to the Eleventh and Twelfth Corps, sent forward to the exclusion of everything else not ordered by the general commanding this department. This is necessary that these troops may be ready to take the field.

Chattanooga, October 13, 1863.

Major-General REYNOLDS,

Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: I have the honor to state that owing to General W. F. Smith's absence he wished me to report that the mountain road to the top of the mountain is now completed.

Very respectfully,

CAMPBELL TUCKER,

First Lieutenant and Aide-de-Camp.

FORT WOOD, October 13, 1863.

Captain W. LEONARD:

CAPTAIN: On account of the fog and rain it has been impossible for me to note the changes of appearance of the enemy. On the right of the Bald Knob east of southeast corner of open field adjoining railroad in front of Fort Wood, and nearer our lines than it has yet been, is the smoke of a camp.

Several shots resembling artillery have been heard during the day. They sounded as if fired on east side of Mission Ridge. Considerable cheering in the camps on our left this evening.

Respectfully,

L. M. DE MOTTE,

Lieutenant and Acting Signal Officer.
