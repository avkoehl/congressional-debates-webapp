The statement that I misconceived any orders is false. I received orders from Major-General Wright, to whom I was ordered to report, to move in rear of his wagons. I requested that my infantry and artillery might follow his troops, but it was not deemed necessary by him. I would not trouble you with the report of any ordinary newspaper correspondent, but this dispatch is dated headquarters Middle Military Division, and is recognized generally as a semi-official report, and justice to my brave command, who lost so heavily on the 19th instant, demands that I respectfully request that this face statement may be officially denied at once.

I am, general, respectfully, your most obedient servant,

W. H. EMORY,

Brevet Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS CAVALRY, MIDDLE MILITARY DIVISION,September 22, 1864.

General MERRITT,

First Division:

GENERAL: General Torbert desires you to let him know as soon as the officer returns from Fort Valley.

Very respectfully, &amp;c.,

WM. RUSSELL, JR.,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS CAVALRY, MIDDLE MILITARY DIVISION,September 22, 1864.

General MERRITT:

GENERAL: The chief of cavalry directs that the command will move to-morrow a. m. at 5 o'clock, in the following order: first, First Division; second, wagon and ambulance train; third, Third Division.

The column and trains must be kept well closed up, and, under no circumstances, will any stragglers be left after the rear of the column. The route of march will be given you in the morning.

Very respectfully, &c.,

WM. RUSSELL, JR.,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS THIRD CAVALRY DIVISION,Buck's, September 22, 1864-10.45 a. m.

Major RUSSELL,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Front Royal:

MAJOR: We are here; find no pickets, and, as yet, hear no news from Strasburg. There are no rebels in this or Fort Valley, and have been none since Kershaw left. About two miles this side of McCoy's a road turns off toward Brushy Botton, and crosses the river three or four miles this side of Luray; not practicable for wagons, but can be used for cavalry. Have sent to Strasburg and will communicate with you as soon as I hear.

Very respectfully, you obedient servant,

J. H. WILSON,

Brigadier-General.
