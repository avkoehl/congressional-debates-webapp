their services may be required, and where they certainly can be more useful to Government than to remain in garrison here. I am sure that under existing circumstances our presence in this Territory is a source of annoyance to the people, of constant complaint and alarm, of jealousy, and apprehension, which are liable at any moment to break out in open hostility and unfortunate collision, beyond the control of human power. Unable as we are effectually to overawe or suppress continued exhibitions of enmity and hatred, and violation of law, our feebleness to cope successfully with the Mormons being as well known to them as to ourselves the presence of our small force here but tends to irritate and provoke those difficulties which it is certainly desirable to avoid until the Government shall be prepared to assume other relations toward the people of this Territory and the autocrat of the Church. I have already had the honor to inform the commanding general of the fact that there are now crossing the plains an immense emigration, four-fifths of whom are loudly and notoriously disloyal to the Government and bent on the destruction of the Union, if their voices or deeds can accomplish it. I am convinced that not less than 15,000 or 20,000 traitors will this year cross the continent and become incorporated in the population of California and Oregon. The measures taken by me to meet the exigencies have also been reported, but it is apparent that administering the oath of allegiance has but little restraining effect, being but lightly regarded by men who have so fallen from their high estate as American citizens as to lose all respect for the Government of their fathers and regard for the institutions of their country.

In the language of your favor of the 11th instant, this day received, I am satisfied that the condition of affairs on this (Pacific) coast and the immense effort now being made by the enemies of our Government to detach us therefrom, requires the greatest watchfulness on the part of officers, and when I see each day so many disloyal men seeking the West to add their strength to the already emboldened body of traitors in California, I not only appreciate the impolicy of sending re-enforcements hither but rather the propriety of recalling the California quota in this district, where now they are not needed. It is unnecessary for me to refer to what is manifestly each day transpiring in California- the increasing boldness and defiant attitude of disloyal men assembled under cover of party names, or the manifold evidences of treasonable sentiments all around you, for the commanding general must be better possessed of such knowledge than I possibly can be; but in the present state of affairs there and here I have esteemed it my duty to set forth the facts of the case in this district and tender the suggestion herein contained. Should it meet the approval of the general I would also suggest that the four companies of Nevada cavalry now being raised would be ample to guard the stage and telegraph lines in this district and protect public property within the Territory, while at the same time they would not be a source of alarm and irritation to the strange people of Utah. In connection with the foregoing I may say that the California column in this Territory can safely take up its line of march as late as the 15th of September and reach California in fifty days. Their experience, soldierly bearing, and excellent quality, eminently fit them for service either in California or wherever the country needs patriotic hearts, and willing stalwart arms. While writing this letter another message from Pocatello has reached me suing for peace, offering to treat on my own terms, and proposing to meet me at Brigham City, sixty-eight miles north of here, on the 30th instant. He also says that the Bannocks, with whom he and his band have lately been
