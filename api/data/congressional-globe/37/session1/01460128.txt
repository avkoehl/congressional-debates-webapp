THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
July 15.
Mr. FESSENDEN. There are several little
amendments which I wish to make. I send them
to the Chair to be read.
The amendments were read. The first was, in
section one, lines seventeen, eighteen, and nine-
teen, to strike out the words " annually on the
notes of fifty dollars and," before u semi-annu-
ally-;" and to strike out " on the notes of a larger
denomination," after " semi-annually;" so as to
make the clause read:
With interest at the rate of seven and three tenths per
cent, per annum, payable semi-annually.
The amendment was agreed to.
The next amendment was, in section four, line
two, to strike out " stock," and insert " bonds."
The amendment was agreed to.
The next amendment was, in section five, line
sixteen, before the word "interest," to insert
" principal and."
The amendment was agreed to.
The next amendment was, in section six, line
seven, befure the word " provisions," to insert
<Â£ foregoing."
The amendment was agreed to.
Mr. FESSENDEN. I propose an amendment
now, to be inserted at the end of section one:
Jlnd provided further, That no Treasurvnote shall bo. is-
sued 01 a les-< denomln.uion than ten dollar-;; and that the
whole amount of Treasury noir^ not bearing intei est issued
undei the luuhonfy of tins act khall not exceed $50,000,000.
Mr. KING. I will, simply as an expression
of opinion, move to strike out " ten" and insert
*4 twenty." It is unnecessary to argue the question.
Mr. t'RSSKNDEN. I hope that will not be
done. The matter has boon very thoroughly con-
sidered in committee, and the necessities of the
country are thought to require the provision as it
is proposed.
The amendment to the amendment was rejected.
The amendment of Mr. Fessenden was agreed
to.
Mr. FESSENDEN. I have one more amend-
ment, to be inserted as section seven:
Jlnd 6c it further caacfctl, That the Secretary ofthe Treas-
ury is heiehy nuthouzed, whenever ho shall deem it expe-
dient, to issue, in exchange (or com, or in payment lor
public dues, TieaMiry notes ol any of the denominations
iteiembelore i-peeiiied, bearing interest not exceeding *ix
percent, per annum, and payable nt. any time not exceeding
twelve inonth-i fiom dale* i'roiidcd, That the amount ol
notes .so issued or paid shall at no turns exceed ,^2(',U0U,000.
The amendment was agreed to.
Mr. E ESSENDEN. I suppose there is no need
of making a motion that the numbers of the suc-
ceeding section1*, he chunked
The VICE PRESIDENT. That will be done
as a mutter of course.
The amendments were ord'ued to he engrossed,
and the lull to be read a third time. The bill was
