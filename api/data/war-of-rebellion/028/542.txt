General MEIGS,

Quartermaster-General:

I have received and forwarded to Hagerstown, Md., since September 7,4,500,000 pounds of corn, 390 tons hay, 97 kegs and 24 bags horse and mule shoes, 4 traveling forges, &amp;c. I have myself also furnished 100 tons hay, in addition to the above. One thousand horses shave been sent from here during October to the army, which were purchased by officers of cavalry sent by General McClellan for that purpose. Many other stores were sent through here, both from Philadelphia and Baltimore, for the army, of which I have no account, as no bills of lading or invoices were sent to this office.
