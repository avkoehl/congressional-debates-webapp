FORTRESS MONROE, VA., April 13, 1864.

(Received 11 p. m.)

Lieutenant General U. S. GRANT,

Commanding Armies of the United States:

I have no objections to General Rucker; believe him to be a good officer, but for our expedition would prefer General Wilson, a younger man. I have no cavalry officer. It is of the last importance that I have one at once.

B. F. BUTLER,

Major-General.

WASHINGTON CITY, April 13, 1864-10. 30 p. m.

Major-General BUTLER,

Fort Monroe, Va.:

I can send you Colonel Kautz to command your cavalry division. He is a good cavalry officer. Do you want him sent?

HEADQUARTERS CAVALRY CORPS,April 14, 1864.

Brigadier-General RAWLINS,

Chief of Staff, Culpeper:

General Wilson having been directed to report to me, I am very much embarrassed in his assignment to the Third Cavalry Division of the Cavalry Corps, as General Kilpatrick, commanding that division, ranks him. General Kilpatrick is anxious to be transferred to the West; is it possible to do so?

P. H. SHERIDAN,

Major-General, Commanding.

STATE OF WEST VIRGINIA, EXECUTIVE DEPT.,

Whelling, April 14, 1864.

Major General F. SIGEL,

Commanding Dept. of West Virginia, Cumberland, Md.:

SIR: When I met you on the cars a few days since, I said to you that I thought I could be prepared in a week to guard the railroad from the Maryland line in the mountains west to Parkersburg for the time you desired, viz, not exceeding a month. It was my intention to send out my adjutant-general to organize the companies for the purposes mentioned, but on my return here I found that his business was such as imperatively demands his attention here for the present, so that I will not be able to organize the railroad guard as soon as contemplated. I will make an effort as soon as possible, and inform you.

Very respectfully,

A. I. BOREMAN.
