HEADQUARTERS EIGHTEENTH ARMY CORPS, June 26, 1864.

General RAWLINS:

WM. F. SMITH,Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS, June 26, 1864-4.20 p. m.

Major-General SMITH,

Commanding Eighteenth Army Corps:

I have information from Mr. Mills, of Mount Airy, just this side of Arlington, that he hears cutting on the island between Fort Clifton and the mainland. That cutting of timber is, of course, for one of two purposes-either to get a range on some battery, or for the purpose of getting a road through for a pontoon bridge for a movement upon your flank and rear. In either case it needs watching and investigating.

BENJ. F. BUTLER,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS EIGHTEENTH ARMY CORPS, June 26, 1864.

General BUTLER:

My pickets are watching the point indicated in your dispatch of 4.20 p. m. I have not one man to spare to send there. I have heard nothing of it from my pickets.

WM. F. SMITH,Major-General.

JUNE 26, 1864-11 p. m.

Major-General SMITH:

I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your telegram (a copy of which you have forwarded directly to the lieutenant-general, as I am informed) in regard to colored troops. From several of its propositions I dissent. Your field return of the 23rd instant gives 7,852 colored troops for duty. In this dispatch you say you have now nearly 5,000.
