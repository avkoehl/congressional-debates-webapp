correction oit A report.
Mr. COLE. Mr. President, T rise to a priv-
ileged question. I observe in the report in
the Chronicle this morning:
" Mr. Colb spoke in favor of the amendment of
tho Finance Committee, expressing the opinion,
however, that the third section, authorizing the in-
terchange of bonds and lawful money, would lead to
great confusion in the money market."
Though in favor of the report of-the Finance
Committee, I expressed no such sentiment as

paragraph. It is seldom that I take notice of
what is said concerning me, or reported as
from me, in the papers, and I would not now
except that this entirely misrepresents my
views.
