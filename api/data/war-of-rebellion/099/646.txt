Longan is about four miles from New Market. The Fourth Division is at the crossing, eight miles above Rocky Ford.

I think Woods' division will be here before you can possibly get over.

Respectfully,

WM. E. STRONG,

Lieutenant-Colonel.
HDQRS. DEPARTMENT AND ARMY OF THE TENNESSEE,Big Black Creek, March 2, 1865.

Major General JOHN A. LOGAN,

Commanding Fifteenth Army Corps:

GENERAL: The major-general commanding directs that, in accordance with instructions contained in General Sherman's letter, you move Generals Woods' and Corse's divisions as rapidly as possible toward Cheraw, attaining that point to-morrow if possible. The other two divisions will follow rapidly as soon as they are closed up.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

A.m. VAN DYKE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

BIG BLACK, S. C., March 2, 1865.

Major General JOHN A. LOGAN,

Commanding Fifteenth Army Corps:

GENERAL: On crossing here I found the train stopped and Corse at work bridging. The most of the train, however, is across, and the balance, I think, will get over before dark, though the bridge is not yet done. I concluded to stay here to-night. Corse leaves me a guard but pushes everything on to the point indicated. I wish as soon as possible to combine the Ninth Illinois with all the mounted men we have besides, and send them down the Chesterfield and Society Hill road with instructions to break the railroad.

Yours, truly,

O. O. HOWARD,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTEENTH ARMY CORPS,New Market, March 2, 1865.

Major-General HOWARD, U. S. Army,

Commanding, &amp;c.:

GENERAL: The general request me to acknowledge the receipt of your note. He has ordered the Ninth Illinois Mounted Infantry to report to Corse to-night; the Twenty-ninth Missouri is already with him. He has not given them other instructons than to report to General Corse, and request that you will give them orders.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

MAX. WOODHULL,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
