Postponement ofjourth instalment—Mr. Underwood.
H. of Reps.
and you leave the charge against
the Treasury for the remaining
part of the present ysar only            $9,075,339 37
The true question is, can we meet and pay this
balance without depriving thp States ol the fourth
instalment of the surplus revende, w vvhieh they
are entitled under the deposite act of June, 1836*
The lourth instalment, required
to be paid on the 1st of Otober,
amounts, to                                       s.9,367,214 98
If to ibis be added the above
balance for the remaining part of
the year,.....9,075,339 37
the aggregate will be   -       -   §18,442,554 35
Now, íi it can be sho^n that oar resources will
enable us lo meet the demand thus ^tafed m the
aggregate, without contracting a naft mal debt¿ or
bonowmg monej', surely not a member on this
ííoor 11*11 raise his yoicc to deprive the Slates of the
money, which, in Í838, we solemnly set apart for
their u*e Í will prove, sir, that otf' means are
ample, and that it only requires an hone«t and
faithful application of them, under suitable acts of
legislation, to relieve the Treasury from all embar-
rassment, and lo preserve inviolate our engagements
iviih the States
The Secretary says, that " by a report of the
Tieasurerof the 30th ultimo, it appears that thp
balance m the Treasury, including whai was in the
custody of banks, the Mint, and collecting officers,
was then $14,596,311 " He moreover states, that
cf this sum "only $8,928,072 was subject to im-
mediate draft," thus leaving $5,668,239 not subject
to "i2r«/i," or not applicable lo the immediate de-
mands upon the Treasury Why it is ihat so large
a sum could no* then be used is not explained, nor
are we told ichei, if ever, it «>H be subject to
" draft " We are m'ormed by the Secrelaty s re-
poit, dated the 14th mst, that the payments, np to
the 11th of the month, amounted to $24,075,339 37,
but we are not informed how much, if any, the
money in the Treasury, on the 30fh of August, -was
diminished to make the payments up to the 11th oí
September. If the receipts during these eleven days
equalled the expenditure, the amount in the
Treasury remained the same at the latter date. Eut
eoncede that (he receipts fell short half a million,
there would sfll remain m the Treasury, including
money in banks, in the Mint, and in the hands of
collecting officei -, on the 11th of September, the
sum of.....^14,096,311 00
Add to this the Secretar) 's low-
est estimate of icceipls tor the
balance of the year, -       -       -       4,500,000 00
And tve have a total of -       -   $18,596,311 00
But to this must be ac'ded the
first instalment duefiom the Bank
of the trmted Stats', amounting,
with interest, lo         -                        2,175,314 00
Constituting an aggregate of
means amounung to - - - $20/71,625 00
Thus, sir, we heve and will have, betoie fie end
of they eai,' more thin twenty millions ot dollar-,
w ith which to pay eighteen Ir the foregoing % lew
of the subject, after satisijmg all the demands of
the vear, we "hall have a balanc to facilitate the
operations of the Mint, and to me-t contingencies,
amounting to §2,329,0/1, a sum amplj sufficient foi
these purpo es, alihough it Ins been usual to pro
vide a ln^er If fitm 'his we deduct ¿741,561,
the report"d amount oi tne navy pension fund, it
will leave a surplus of ^1,587,510, after discharg
in  all oUims upon the Treasury during the yeai
It mav be contended that I have cired in cuwd
enn- the f 5 668 239, "not subject to diaft,> ?s a
narfof the av ailable mean ot the Treasury during
the -vear It it be an error, it ha sprung 1 rom tne
indefinite chai after of the Secretary's report Had
he °iven the reasons w hv it was not now available,
ancTshown uhen it would be, my calculation might
have been diffeient But, m the absence ot all
such reasons, and knoving as I do the settled hos-
tility of the late and existing Administrations to the
act of 1836, requiting the deposite with the States
and their manifest purpose to ¡ender it odious
among the people, 1 lake the want of a full explan-
a'ton orr the part of the Secretary a  a tacit acknowl-
edgement5 iha' be can draw upon all the money in
the Treasury m the coarse of the year Bat, sir,
let us suppose that he canndf, and that this sum
ought to be provided bj Congress Shaft! it come
out of the fourth instalment going to the States i
Shall we take the whole of that instilment to make
gotfd this unavailable sum cf <?5,668,239' No,
sir. ¡HW thai shall U te supplied ? Must v. e
borrow the money or issue Treasury notes for it i
No, sir I will tell you how id get it We hold
$7,000,000 of stock m the ¡ate Bank of the United
States The institution of ¡hat name chartered by
Pennsylvania agieed to pay u  WÍ5 48 for each
share of that slock, in four equal anfiufíí instal-
ments, wifh uteiest, miking the principal amílínt
to $7,946,350 IGcen's upon a nnal aeltlement, fur
which we hold toui bonds Arter deducting the
list instalment, of bold, there vu'l remain §5 959,
767 1É cents Put this stock in marke' Youi
Secretary has manifested great anxJety in his re-
port to became a buyer and sé'íer of s ocks In-
deed, he ^lves it as h s opinion that St is imnossj-
ble, With Sounes ef revenue so fluctuating as ours,
and so dependent on commeicial prospe'ity, that
any fiscal operations should be long continued with
ease, vigor and uniformity, vv uhout son>e such reg-
ulatoi as a power to issue and reieem Treasuiv
notes, or to invest and sell the investment of sur-
pluses" Now, although I do not concur m one
word of a'l this, 1 am willing to see the Secretan
hy his skill in selling our claims upon the bank,
guarding against sacrifices, by fixing a minimum
Mow which hr shon'd not sell. In this way Ihe
money can be laised a-- easily as by issuing Tiea-
surj notes aid without creating a dollar of debt
upon the country You can s ípply the defciencv
of 85 063,239 (it m truth there be such dehc encv)
by selling this stoc' , and, by so domg, vou may
provide two or three hundied thousand dollars
more, in aid of the Mint, or to meet contingencies
It must be clear to every mind unprejudiced by
the influences of party, tha't nothing more is requit-
ed to meet the demands on the Treasury for the
residue Of the year, than the passage of a law auth >r-
l/ing the Secretary to sell our claim upon the Penn-
sylvania Bank ot the United Slates It has been
objected that the money standing to the credit of
the Treasurer m the deposite bank  will be unavail-
ing m making the tiansfer to the States, so long as
these binks refuse to p"} specie The objection is
futile Kentucky vrnl receive a diafton her banks
in discharge ot her poition of the fourth ms alment
All the States will do the like with their banks r -
spectiv el} Those States in whose banks there is
no money, or not sufficient to par them, may make
arrangements wnh the banks out of their limits, to
receive interest until they can obtain payment If
the monev was paid them, they -would invest it so
as to get l gal mteiest, -md be content By allow-
ing the banks to íetam it, and pa\ by instalments,
with interest, the banks and 'he i debtors vvou'd be
lebeved, and the States receive all thev coukl n
ieason lequne, regarding the general embarrass-
ments of the bines
Instead of adopting a course so obv ious, what is
the Administration atenptnig' Only look at the
proceedings of the Committee of Ways an I Means,
the thermometer which indicates the piecise state
of Evecutne temperature, and vou have the an-
swer. That committee 1 as lcpJrtcd a bill author-
izing the issue of Trea uiv  not s to  the amount
of......
The bill now before us takes
ftom the States a foartn pait of
the monev actuillytn han I on
the fust div of tVs vear, and
\ men, in June, 1836, was it
apart for the use ot the States
amounting to

We are this ser ously asked to incuie Hie

hois, and for wl it purpjsei It -vou refuse to pay
the State-,, theeniut chaige on the Trei=mv forthe
balance of me vear i $,9,07 5,339 37 only and
to meet it \on have all the money nou oi hand,
and all that will be collected before the end of the
year, amounung, as has been already shown, to-
more 'han t« enty millions of dollars.
I may be told that the object of the Administra-
tion is to piov ide m season for the $15,000 ODD of
anpiopnations which the Secretiry ha'i p stpoieci
until anothei yen If that ground is aponed, J
shoal t like to know whether these ¡J15,CEW,'"!0

afterl We have 10 tepcrt from he Depar >r>°nts
on the subject, a id my friend from Tennessee (Mr
Bell) ha^ satisfactory shown 'hat there can be a
great reduction in our expenditures—that we can
siva the In It or die third of the $15,000,000, if no
m rs But suppose the whole must be met in the
eouse of the ensuing year, it can be done by a
rigid tfcoi omv, aided by the collections of revenue
bonds, «pot  winch ire are about to grant indul-
gence, and the acerjmg revenues of the ensuing
yeai Yet if it couf 1 not be, I would prefer meet-
ing the deficiency by issuing Treasury notes, to
withholdmc the fourth instalment from the States
You hav e no right lo withhold it You have con-
tracted that they should have it, and you will ■no-
late faith if you do not let them have it.
Mi Cha rman, when the States acceded to the
terms pi escribid m the deposite act ot 1836, a clear
contract was formed between them and the General
Government—just such a conlract as would entitle
an indittdml to damages in similar circumstances, if
the contract xf % not perfoimed.   Suppose you had
a surplus mnnfityof tt ork-hones, and you were
to propose to me to kief thtm foi you, that I might
have the u e of them as ll>r>9¡ as I retained them—
that I shonkl insJie their lives, and return them m
good order when cilled for—and that you would
dtlner tone a certain number at   four several
times, a week oi a month apart, provided, how ever,
that voa should ml reclaim more ihpn one- noise
in any one month without thirty days' previous
notice.    Suppose 1 assent lo all this, and go on ana
erect stables, purchase   provender,  and   employ
hands to take care of the horses, and to work them
so as to remunerate me for all my trouble and ex-
pense      Suppose you  deliver me the three first
portions at ihe times stipulated < but a few days
befo-e the last are to be delivered, you say to me
that I shall not have them—that you find you have
use for them yours«dl    May I not ansvper, " I want
them likew ise, I have made my arrangement, look-
ing to the iulii'ment of yourpiomises   Ihave agreed
that my neighbors'children shall go to school ove'
