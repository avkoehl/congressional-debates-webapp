elusive reason why it cannot rationally be accorded
to them. Every humbug is dependant on confi-
dence, and few things but humbugs bebpeak a con-
fidence which they cannot command. The juggler,
who intend*, to deceive you with tricks of legerde-
main, bespeaks your confidence or credulity as es-
sential to the success of his deception. The ven-
triloquist deceives your senses by first bespeaking
vour confidence that he will perform a certain
thing, and leaves to imagination to assure you of
its fulfilment. If the banks were really able to
fulfil their engagements with the public, would they
care a fig whether it had confidence in them or
notf It is only because they are not able to fulfil
ihose engagements that they desire to have the con-
fidence oí the ability substituted for the iact. The
man who pays cash as he goes, cares not whether
people have confidence in his ability or not, but the
man who wishes credit requires confidence. This,
in the case of the individual, is all fair, because he
fianklj acknowledges, " I am not able to p<iy you
now, bul I expect to be able to pay you at ouch a
time," and jour belief that he will mtiusiuously
exeit himself to fulfil his engagement, that he is
honest, and that Providence will smile upon his
exertions, are the grounds upon which your conti
dence is avvaided But the unreasonable demand
ol the banks is, that you should have confidente,
not onl> without any thin? whereon to rest it, but
in the face of your experience that it is misplaced
Let them show then ability, and they «ill com-
mand confidence, but «lieu their hollowness and
liatmal incapacity is visible in their whole texture,
they sue (ui it m vain When I ask confidence
that 1 can lift the feather which 1 hold in my hand,
I command it also, (or 1 show at the moment that I
am able to pettoim, but weie I to assert an ability
to «pinot a mountain, my dearest Iriend would
sneer at my oflon to piaetiee on his cieduluy Con-
fidtuce, like love, and hope, and joy, must be the
spontaneous growth of the bosom it inhabits, it
cannot be enforced But I would ask ihe Senator
from Virginia whether his Whig friends, who yield

tract,  to  wit   iliil  'Ithougb ihe revenue would be
moreretlilv commanded  by the Government in

tion   oí  it  would be salt r in the banks     My re-
traxit ib founded not only upon a consideration of
the subject,  but upon  the light which experience
has ahead/ lurntshed in favor of individual agenc)
A  tabular stitemo it,  loi which I am indebted to

Thus it appears that not less than about fifteen
millions of dollars have been lost by the banks,
while the whole amount leported, fiom the founda-
tion of the Government, to hav e been lost by indi-
vidual agents is about Ihiee millions of dolíais
And it seems that this account is subject to a de-
duction ot about fifii pel cent leaving An actual
balance of about one million ol dolíais. Tte-
centl) banks have ¡ailed in (he Eastern Slates
hy which gentlemen on the othei <ul( intimate that
heavy losses have been sustained by ihe creditois,
and will be sustained by the Gov eminent
Wliethei this is so oi not, tluuitis aie teilunly

ment loses nothing hy them, it will be because it
will have hule oí nothing m then custody

other mode of incieaung the public income, that
the banks may hav e tht kei png and use of it An
effort has been made to liken the Independent
Treasury to Ihe revenue system of Fiance, and to
show that system to have been exceedingly expen-
sive The number of revenue officers, it is said,
amount to one hundred thousand This I suppose
is but conjecture, and I should be inclined to think
an erroneous, one.   Mr. Goldsmith, a late writer
on French slatistics, presents the nation as divided
into 86departments, 362airondisements,and 39,381
communes. In each department there is a receiver
general, to each arrondisement a r ceiver, and
each commune, a collector These officers added
together, make a total of 39,821; and I admit
that to this, there is probably a considerable addi-
tion, how much I am unable to say, but certainly
I  should conceive not such as to make the whole
equal to 100,000 The number at best is large,
but it carries with it this high recommendation,
that upon this simple plan it renders these officers
very safe checks upon each other. It has been
also stated, that the revenue expenses of France
amount to twenty-fout cent upon the whole income.
Now, sir, it has never been my fortune to bask
under the sunny sky of France, and at the same
tune in the smiles of this wicked Administration,
but thank Piovtdence I have access to books, and
lrom them I learn that the revenue of France in
1814, was about 450,000,000 fiancs, the ex-
pense attending it to about 15,000,000, or less than
foui pei cent. That in 1S15, the revenue amount-
ed to 743,830,200 francs, the expense to 16,334,346,
II  «.omeihing over two per cent. This is the more
lemarkahle, as this vear comprehended the hun-
ilied days, when the war expenses alone amounted
lo ¡S>b,9'U,l3i fiams It is true, that in 1829,
timing that peaod of misrule, immediately pie-
eedmg the list revolution m that land of i evolu-
tions, the levenue amounted to 986,156,821 francs,
and the expense to 138,058,685, or between twelve
and thirteen per cent , and taking the average of
lhe-,e thiee yeais, it brings the expense to
about six oi seven pei cent very little va-
lient liom our our present expense, for it has
bet n seen, that with a revenue of about thirty
or ihnty-five millions of dollars, eur expenses
ue about two millions, oi bttween six anil seven

I o oi three i npoitaiit tonsidei mon Most of
dies otineis ol Hie 1'u nth ie\enue are collectors,
and nit kit pi i, ol tht u venue, moie than 39,000
of those enuinflated bung of the former class-
Thi is a el.i whit'i, unlrr no revenue system,
t in ever be dispensed with, and it i* not proposed
h\ Ihe bill to ineiease their number. Another ob-
stfi t ation is, that a large pomon of the levenue of
Fr mee is laised by direct taxation—confessedly
the most expensive mode ¿Viid this brings to my
recollection an appeal made by the Senator from
Kentucky |Mr Crittenden] to the friends of the
Ailminisiiaiton, how ihey supposed the people
would beai, in the event ol resoitto direct taxation,
a demand of its payment in specie1* In reply to
that appei), I have only to say that direct taxation
■tlu i)s has been, and I presume always will be, an
0 Itous modt of collecting revenue, whelhei in spe-
cie or p.ipet That any thing may be rendered
odious; by coupling it «uh something odious in it-
self 1 hat unless it be necessary no people bear
taxation vvoist than the Anglo-Saxon lace, and
whtn ntitssiry no puople pay it more cheeifully.
That neithci in pipci tioi specie would the Ameri-
can ptoph yield quietly to hav, money demanded
01   tht in in pei on by a tax-gaiheier, in behalf of
din Govi inment, mile's the nteesiities of the Go-
vt mint tit eompelltd a rtstut u> that couise, but
whenever they do, the people will pay with readi-
ness, anil that in vvh itsoever the wisdom of the
National Legislatme shall pronounce expedient
A thndob ervation which I make i«, that, surround-
ed as France is, or neaily so, by other nations,
villi whom theic is direct land communication, it
is oi couise necessary tor her to keep up a strong
ami expulsive bod) of men engaged m what is
called the preventive service The wonder then
is tha' the i ev en ue expenses of Fiance should beso
inconsútil "ible, ard it furnishes ano'her proof of
the genius of lhat vvonde-ful man to whom is ac-
corded, by common consent, the supenotity in
genius of the present, it not of every age, who
perfected a system which works so admirably even
in the hands of a far less talented controller In
addition to all this, I am informed, from high au-
thority, that the Frenfch Government deputed
a commissioner to England to investigate the
subject, and the result of his examination was a
decided opinion that economy would not be pro *?
