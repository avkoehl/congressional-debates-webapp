HEADQUARTERS SEVENTEENTH ARMY CORPS,OFFICE OF CHIEF COMMISSARY,

Pocotaligo, January 28, 1865.

Major-General HAZEN,

Commanding Second Division, Fifteenth Army Corps:

DEAR GENERAL: Captain Galvin was to know how many stores, &amp;c., you can get from this landing. I intend to have enough here of all. I have now 150,000 rations for the Fifteenth Army Corps, and will probably have more this afternoon, but at the same time if I were in your place I would load up my train to its full capacity at Beaufort, as follows: Thirty days' sugar and coffee, twelve to twenty days' hard bread, two to four days' salt meat, thirty to forty days' salt, and all beef-cattle that can be obtained at Beaufort, and then if you have empty wagons (made so by issue) when you get up here I will load them here for you. A large lot of stores went to Beaufort yesterday with orders to furnish your troops all they wanted.

I have the honor to be, yours, truly, &c.,

D. REMICK,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Chief Commissary of Subsistence.

Please say to Colonel Carpenter to do the same with all the trains of the Fifteenth Army Corps at or near Beaufort, as this letter advises you to do, and oblige,

D. R.

Copy sent to Colonel Carpenter.

W. B. H[AZEN].
