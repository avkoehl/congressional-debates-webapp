Foster, from whom I have heard nothing. Have sent a small force to Strawberry Plains bridge, and picketed the roads to right and rear.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JNO. G. PARKE,

Major-General BURNSIDE.

RUTLEDGE, December 10, 1863-11.45 a.m.

GENERAL: Your dispatch of 3 p.m. yesterday only just received. I forwarded one to you at daylight this morning; since then have heard from Shackelford that Colonel Ward had a severe skirmish with enemy yesterday p.m. on Morristown road, and drove him across river. This morning he (Shackelford) has sent a brigade on each of the roads in his front to Morristown and Rogersville. I have directed him to hold Bean's Station in force, and make no advance unless further orders or developments require it. Small parties of the enemy are hovering on other side of river, even to Strawberry Plains. Very glad to hear that you are better, and out. Major Cutting has pressed on to communicate with General Shackelford.

Very respectfully,

JNO. G. PARKE,

Major-General, Commanding.

Major-General BURNSIDE.

RUTLEDGE, December 10, 1863-4.30 p.m.

GENERAL: Major Cutting reports from Bean's Station at 2 p.m. that a portion of the brigade sent toward Morristown took the Russellville branch, and met the enemy at the river; found them in too great force to dislodge, and remains facing the enemy at Moore's Ferry, about 10 miles from Bean's Station, guarding wagon trains. Two strong divisions of their infantry had left there the morning previous. One hundred of the enemy's cavalry have attacked a company of ours on river 6 miles from here. A number of small parties are reported on other side river. General Shackelford is in communication with Willcox, at Tazewell; the road had not been obstructed by the enemy. Willcox is about forwarding supplies and repairing the telegraph.

Respectfully,

JNO. G. PARKE,

Major-General.

Major-General BURNSIDE.

RUTLEDGE, Tennessee December 14 [or 15], 1863.

GENERAL: I send report from General Shackelford. The roads are in bad condition, and moving now in any considerable distance will be out of the question. Scouts have been sent out by General Willcox and General Shackelford. As soon as these report I will forward
