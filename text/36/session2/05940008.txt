The expenditure of the first quarter of
the current fiscal year—that ending
September 30,1860—was as follows:
For civil, foreign intercourse, and miscel-
laneous services*   $6,440,003 77

The estimated expenditure
from appropriations here-
tofore made bylaw, during
the three remaining quar-
ters of the current fiscal
year, 1861, according to the
report of the Register, is.. 46,935,232 58
The loan of June 22, 1860,
tho amount of which is
stated among the means of
the fiscal year 1861. is ex-
pre&s-ly required to be ap-
plied to the redemption of
Treasury notes, the amount
of those notes and interest
thereon, deducting $375,400
redeemed during the first
quarter, as stated in the
expenditure of that quarter,
is  20,624,600 00
Making the aggregate expenditure, ascer-
tained and estimated, for the cunent fiscal
year, 1861    84,103 105 17
Which amount, deducted from the total of
ascertained and estimated means for the
service of the current fiscal year, 1861, as
before stated, leaves a balance in the ^
Treasury on July 1,1861, being the com-
mencement of the fiscal year 1862, of.... $245,891 58
The foregoing statement assumes that the whole
sum embraced in the estimated expenditure for
the remaining three quarters of the current fiscal
year will be actually called for within the year.
The amount stated—$46,935,232 58—does not
include the entire balancc of the appropriations
heretofore made by law, but such sums as the
respective Departments have indicated may prob-
ably be required. But in practice, for many years
past, the sums drawn from the Treasury during
any year have been much less than the amounts
estimated as required with u* such year, accord-
ing to the character of the appropriations and the
exigencies of the public service. * It may be,
therefore, fairly anticipated that, should the op-
erations of the Government proceed in their ordi-
nary course, at least $4,000,000 more may be
deducted from the estimated expenditure of the
current fiscal year, ineieasing the balance in the
Treasury on July 1, 1861, to that extent.
Estimates for the fiscal year from July 1,1861, to June 30,
1862.
Estimated receipts from customs  $60,000,000 00
Estimated receipts tiom public lands  3,000,000 00
Estimated receipts from miscellaneous
suuiccs    1,250,000 00
Estimated balance itt the Treasury, July 1,
1861  245,891 58
Aggregate estimated means for the fiscal year
18G3  64,495",891 58
Estimated cxpendituie from pennanent ap-
propi lations $9,626,386 20
Estimated expenditure from
balance of former appropiia-
tions not before requued.... 12,198,112 62
Estimates now submitted by
tho Executive Departments
for appropriation by Con-
gi ess  46,539,227 29
Aggregate estimated expenditure for the
iiscal year 1862  68,363,726 11
Showing a deficit of estimated means for the
service of the fiscal vear ending June 30,
1862, of   $3,867,834 53
The suggestions above made, as to not draw-
ing from the Treasury during the year the whole
amount of the appropriations authorized bylaw,
will apply to these estimates; so that, instead of
the above deficiency of $3,867,834 53, there will
probably remain in the Treasury on the 1st July,
1862, a balance of about $8,000,000.
The correctness of this estimate of expenditure
for the present and next fiscaf years may be illus-
trated in another and simpler form. The entire
expenditure of the Government for the fiscal year
ending June 30, 1860, exclusive of the redemp-
tion of Treasury notes, which are otherwise pro-
vided for, and the interest on the public debt,
was $59,848,474 72; and in that sum was included
$4,446,009 26, to meet a deficiency in the Post
Office Department, produced by the failure of the
Post Office appropriation bill at the second ses-
sion of the Thirty-Fifth Congress—thereby caus-
ing this amount to be paid and charged in the
expenditure of the fiscal year ending June 30,
1860, though, in point of fact, the service was
rendered and the liability incurred in,the preced-
ing year. It should be borne in mind that this
sum of $59,848,474 72 included not only pay-
ments growing out of such appropriations as had
been estimated for by the Department, but all
other sums appropriated by Congress. There is
no reason why the expenditure for the present or
nextfiscalyearshouldexceed thatof the last year.
Allowing, however, a margin for an increase, it
may be safely stated that the expenses for the two
years will not exceed $60,000,000 each—making
the amount to be provided for $120,000,000. The
"Stimated means of the Treasury for the same pe-
riod arc: for the present fiscal year, $63,348,996 75,
and for the year ending June 30,1862, $64,250,000;
which would leave an excess of estimated means
over estimated expenditure of §7,598,996 75.
The estimate of receipts into the Treasury lias
been made without reference to the financial and
commercial panic, which has assumed so threat-
ening an aspect within the last few days, and of
which I shall speak more fully hereafter. The
country was never in a more prosperous condi-
tion. Our planters and farmers have been blest,
as a general rule, with abundant crops, and were
realizing remunerativeprices for all kinds of prod-
ucts. The exports of the last fiscal year had
reached the enormous sum of $400,122,296, and
the imports for the same period were $362,163,941,
yielding a revenue from customs of $53,187,511 87.
The exports of domestic produce for the present
fiscal year, as far as they have been received, in-
dicate an increase fully equal to, if not greater
than thatof preceding years, thus authorizing the
estimate of increased revenue from that source.
Apart, therefore,from the tlneatened embarrass-
ments in the trade and business of the country,
these estimates, both of expenditure and receipts,
would be submitted to Congress with great con-
fidence that they would not vary very far from
the actual results.
It is impossible to anticipate the effects which
this threatened revulsion will produce upon the-
business of the country. The absence of all the
ordinary causes for such a state of things leaves
no data upon which to make calculations. All the
elements of prosperity are in existence—abund-
ant crops with remunerative prices, money seek-
ing safe investments, and indeed everything to
indicate more than the usual increase in trade and
business. The causes which have so suddenly
arrested this tide of prosperity must be looked
for outside of the financial and commercial oper-
ations of the country; they are of a politicalehar-
acter,and therefore so dependent for their ultimate
effect upon future developments that it is impos-
sible at present to say what will be the extent of
their influence. If, as some suppose, they are
merely temporary, and will soon pass away, then
there will bo no necessity for any action of Con-
gress, except to provide for the embarrassments
already existing in consequence of them. If, on
the other hand, the effect should prove more per-
manent, the fact will be made manifest during the
present session of Congress, and in time for such
action as will provide the necessary means to carry
on the operations of the Government, and pre-
serve the public credit.
Already has the Treasury been seriously af-
fected by these causes. The receipts from cus-
toms for the last few days have greatly fallen oil*,
and the limited amount received is composed each
day of an increased proportion of Ti easury notes,
not yet due. The indications are that such will,
at least for the present, continue to be the case;
not only so, but in consequence of the failure of
bidders for the late loan to comply with the tci ms
of their bid, a portion of the ordinary revenues
