Lieutenant-General GRANT,

City Point:

A civilian is just in from General Smith's line and reports that the Twenty-second U. S. Colored Troops carried the rifle-pits near Beasley's house at about 12 m. and that the troops were advancing. He left at 3.30 o'clock, but brought no dispatch from General Smith. From my signal tower on the left fighting is seen going on in the direction of due south, which would bring it at the point where General Kautz should be making his demonstration on the Norfolk road; both artillery and infantry firing. The rebel is also reported as opening upon our troops in the interior of the town. From the right signal station a six-horse team is seen taking a siege gun across Chaffin's Bluff.

City Point:

The lookout at the signal station on the right just reports that clouds of dust are seen on the north side of the James, seeming to be caused by two brigades of infantry and about 200 wagons and ambulances crossing Chaffin's farm.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

Lieutenant Davenport, acting as my secretary, has just returned from General Smith's front. He holds a line of from two miles to the left of the Jordan Point road to the Appomattox, five miles in all. I have sent him back word to again push on to the Appomattox. General Hancock's corps has probably joined him ere this. They were about five miles from him at 9.30 and were advancing. General Smith has captured 13 guns and 260 prisoners. We have reason to believe that the enemy in this front has been re-enforced, and we have made every disposition to hold our own here.

BENJ. F. BUTLER,

Major-General, Commanding.
