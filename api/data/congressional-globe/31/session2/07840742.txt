THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
Feb. 27.
once transferred to the States, and they could
operate it with increased efficiency, and with
economy which is unknown to us. No one could
defend for a moment the principle that the Federal
Government ought to retain the domain, with all
its expenses of administration, for the mere pur-
pose of conferring titles in it upon the citizens of
the States.
The possession of the domain, moreover, cre-
ates relations of landlord and tenant, of patronage
and dependency between the Government and the
States, injurious to both. This has been an in-
convenience hitherto unavoidable, and it ought to
be continued no longer than shall be required by a
paramount national interest.
I shall consider, Mr. President, very briefly the
power of Congress in the premises. So far as
the Constitution is concerned, I shall pass by all
commentaries and all glosses, and take my stand
upon the simple text—"The Congress shall have
' power to dispose of, and make all needful rules
« and regulations respecting, the territory or other
' property belonging to the United States." The
power of disposition thus conferred is general, un-
limited, absolute. It is the same power that Con-
gress has to dispose of forts, magazines, arsenals,
edificcs, or ships. They have power to sell; they
have power to give. Of course the power should
be exercised in this as in all other cases for the
best interests of the nation; but the discretion of
Congress is not abridged.
Let us now examine the supposed limitations in
the deeds of cession; for the rights of the States
are secured by the Constitution. There are sev-
eral grants, which, it has been seen, are expressed
in different forms. It is not the forms employed
in any one of the grants, but the general spirit
and effect of them all, that explain and define the
power conveyed. New York, Massachusetts,
and Connecticut released by language broad and
comprehensive. They conveyed " for the benefit
of the United States.
Virginia and other States amplified, but mani-
festly for the purpose of expressing the same
meaning more fully. They granted " for the" use
and benefit of the United States," and declared
pthat the estate and jurisdiction conferred should
" be considered as a common fund of all the
• States, according to their usual respective propor-
' tions in the general charge and expenditure, and
' should be faithfully and bona fide disposed of for
• that purpose, and for no other purpose whatso-
• ever."
This language was adopted with reference to the
then existing Articles of Confederation, under
which the States were charged with contributions
for the support of the Federal Government, which
system was afterward modified by the Constitution
of the United States so as to dispense with contri-
butions from the States, and invest Confess with
power of taxation upon impost i, and of direct
taxation according to representative population.
Certainly the terms of these grants were not in-
tended to confine Congress to a disposition of the
lands by sale only—because, first, they express
no such thing; and because, secondly, tne politi-
cal jurisdiction, as well as the right of soil, was
included in the designation of " a common fund."
Again: it would be practically impossible, under
any system whatever, to secure equal benefits
from the domain to all the States. If you sell the
lands in Ohio, you may divide the avails be-
tween that State and all her sister States, but the
land will still remain, yielding power and wealth
directly to the State forever, while the other
States can be only indirectly recipients of such
benefits.
What was intended, then, was simply this:
that whatever disposition Congress should make
of the domain should be one purely national and
impartial. It seems to me to mean nothing more;
and the Constitution expresses that meaning fully.
If, then, the adoption of such principles as I have
discussed has become necessary already, or shall
hereafter become necessary, the policy would then
be a proper exercise of the constitutional power,
And would fall within its trust, as defined by the
deeds of cession.
This is a subject of vast importance. It reaches
across the whole basis of the great empire which
V>rg on this continent, and forward through
all the stages of its elevation, and even of its de-
cline and fall, if it shall not be perpetual. Pos-
terity , and perhaps the civilized world, will review
our decisions in the light reflected on them by |
their broad and lasting consequences. May they :
be such as will safely abide so severe and so im- .
partial a scrutiny! :
Mr.- MILLER. This is not the time nor the
occasion to go into a discussion in regard to the I
.appropriation or the partition of the public lands.
I merely rise for the purpose of asking the at- !
tention of the Senate again to this bill, if it is in >
order to speak upon the subject before the Senate.
It is evident that we are not prepared at this late
hour of the session, and with tne little informa-
tion that we have upon this subject, to vote upon
this bill. If I understand it aright, it proposes to i
frant to Louisiana all the public lands lying within
er borders, amounting in the aggregate to some
twenty-two millions of acres. Now, we have al-
ready granted to Louisiana her share of the public
lands, with the other new States, in a general bill
of appropriation. We have also granted to her
all the swamp lands, and I believe we have made
several grants to her with regard to railroads.
Mr. DOWNS. Only one.
Mr. MILLER. And now comes this general
grant of the remainder of the land. It reminds
me very much of the various codicils of a will,
in which this property is bequeathed to this one,
another branch of property is bequeathed to an-
other one, and then comes in a general one, devis-
ing the residue to some one else. In this case we
are applying the codicils to the same one, having
devised some land for a railroad, all the swamp
lands to the State, and bow, by a general provis-
ion, we are asked to devise die remainder to Loui-
I siana.
I But I will not detain the Senate by going into
j the merits of this question. I am in favor of im-
i proving the navigation of the Mississippi river
\ and other western waters. I am in favor of inter-
[ nal improvements; and I would be willing to de-
: vote the public lands by any general system which
, might be devised, and in which all the States of
the Union could have an interest. But I am ut-
j terly opposed to this partial and particular distri-
bution of the public lands for the benefit of the
States in which they happen to lie. Without de-
taining the Senate further, I propose to lay this
bill upon the table, for the purpose of testing the
s^nse of the Senate upon the subject.
iMr. CLARKE. I hope my friend from New
Jersey will withdraw that motion.
Mr. MILLER. I will if the Senator from
Rhode Island will renew it.
Mr. CLARKE. I am decidedly in favor of
this bill if the Senate shall find an appropriate time
to take it up for just and proper consideration.
; My object now is to offer an amendment to the
j bill, which I wish to have printed. A word with
: regard to the amendment. I have before me a
statement which I have made out from public doc-
' laments, showing the amount of public lands
< granted to the various States of the Union. With
| great labor I have ascertained that over nineteen
millions of acres have been granted to the States
| for various purposes, withoutincluding the grants,
! which have been large and numerous, within the
last two years. And I find that, to the first of
January, 1848, for the construction and improve-
ment of roads, and for river and harbor improve-
ments, these appropriations have been made:
Maine (of which $137,388 was for a military road) $276,574
New Hampshire, for river  10,000
Vermont, for harbors  101,000
Massachusetts, for harbors, rivers, &e  526,148

From this statement it will be seen that of the
amount thus appropriated, but $lr106,129 was
expended in New England, and but $7,642,651 in
the old States, in which there were no expend-
itures for roads except f 1,901,227 for the Cumber-
land road in Maryland,. Virginia, and Pennsylva-
i ma; and $15,000 for a road in Georgia, to which
I will add $137,388 for a military road in Maine..
I have also prepared a detailed statement of the
j grants of public lands for various purposes up to-
j the 1st of January, 1848. It is as follows:

The whole amount of these grants is 16,153,878
acres, of which 7,858,997 are for common schools;
365,736 for universities, colleges, and seminaries;
4,244,008forrailroads, canals, and rivers; 3,666,918
for internal improvements; 2,560 for the seat of
government of Missouri; and for the deaf and
dumb 4,859.
Thatstatement,itwill be observed,is onlymade
up to the 1st of January, 1848; but by another
document from Mr. R. M. Young, Corrtmiasioner
of Public Lands, dated in January, 1849,1 learn
that the whole amount then granted to the States
for those purposes was 19,988,825 acres. As I
have before said, I have not seen any subsequent
statement.
Such have been the grants and appropriations
that have been made, and yet I shall not be un-
willing to make the additional grant to Louisiana
which is proposed to be made by this bill, if 1 can
succeed in attaching to it an amendment which I
now submit that it may be printed. It is as fol-
i lows:
" Jlnihe it further enacted. That there shall be granted
to the several States of this Union an amount of the public
land equal to one hundred thousand acres to every Repre-
sentative and Senator of each State in the present Congress
of the United States, to be selected from the lands subject to
sale at private entry, and set apart for the use of said States
respectively, under the direction of the Secretory of the
Treasury. The lands thus to be selected shall be located
in parcels, conformable to sectional divisions and subdivis-
ion of not less than a quarter section in any one location.
" Be it further enacted, That the lands herein granted to
the States, as aforesaid, shall not be disposed of at a pries
less than one dollar and twenty-five cents per acre, until
otherwise authorized by a law of the United States, and
the proceeds of the sales of such lands shall be faithfully
applied by each State respectively—one half thereof as ■
