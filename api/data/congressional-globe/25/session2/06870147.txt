An' \el n the iace of all this, it wasasseited
upon the flojr of Uie Senite, at the last session,
thtt there v as no undue expansion of the
papei s\^orri ii England, and no general com-
mercial distress The truth is, the same spirit
of specula ion, rage for banks, railroads and
joint stock companies, and land monopoly,
sprar>2 up in this country and England about
the same time, and one encouraged the other
in its excesses Those m this country who
did not cast their eyes beyond the Atlantic
to see what w as going on there, attributed the in-
ri eas= ot banks to the withdrawal of the
thee in; infl icrce of the United States Bank,
■>  l a 'opt ng the quae ^ - maxim, post hoc propter
hoc coiic'u led that because this s ate of things
■«asieij nearly simultaneous with the refusal to
rechartei tne bank, and the removal of the depo-
sits the one was cause, and the other effect The
lotal meficiency of the Bank of England to restrain
this evil there, ought to convince one, it -would
seem, how po« er'ess a United States Bank would
ha\ e been for the same purpose, had one been re-
chaite ed here The cause of the revulsion is
plain enough Our gold bill, Bntish investments
in American stocks and American loan--, caused
the golden ti le to set rapidly towards this country,
and the sp>cir> in the Bank of England «as n a
very short time íeduced from between ten and
eleven millions to about three and a half This
sudden collapse of the money bags on which she
had fixed her imperial t'-uone, jostled the Juno
Mone'a, called by the modems confidence, and
threw hei from her seat The Bank of England be-
came alarmed, and m her haste to regain her ne-
cessary suppiy of gold, spread dismay in every di-
lection Hei efforts naturally tnrew exchanges
great} ng-unst this country, and produced ail that
sud n pro" intion about which wise men affect to
rrnK amv-ttiy She has succeeded in legainmg

deep cd i Ti-sarv to her safety and comfort, and

servation n id ii-en to bef\ een eleven and twelve
millions We aiready feel its effects Exchanges
are againm our fd\or, the commercial tide is be-
ginning to moi e, and, in spite of panic makers,
trade is beginning to flourish , and it will continue
to flourish, wiihout any adventitious stimulants, as
long as our soil lemams fertile, is tilled by our m-
duíüious iellow-eitizens, and the blessing of Hea-
ven descends upon their labor
Again v e are represented as acting in direct op-
position to the  known will  of the people, and
are charged with want of fealty to our constituents
We profess the utmost respect for the voice of the
people, and if we understand it aright, are, notwith
standing the delusion under which we fear a large
portion are acting, but obeying the will of a decided
majority The Opposition have their feasts, raise
a noise and clamor, make bold and swagger ng
speeches, and put forth splendid newspaper puffs
and descriptions, and as the "rabble rout," as one
of their orators has termed it, passes by them, min-
gle their shouts with theirs, and pronounce it the
united voice of the people "Therox knoweth his
owner," and as yet the people are in the ascendant,
and no public servarft dares to question their supre-
macy, but if no check is put to the present progres. 
of events, the other part of the text will become
true, and "the ass will know his master's crib," for
no one will attain to wealth o- honor, who does not
receive them at the hands of the bank aristocracy
The Senator from Virginia [Mr Rives] has been
pleased to allude to the popular voice in North
CaroLna, and I must say I am not a little surprised
at such an allusion from such a quarter My \ er,
kind feefmgs and personal respect for that Senator,
prevent me from addressing to him the harsh
language of reproof, in the words of St Paul—
"Evil communications corrupt good manners ' but
I will say, that a man soon learns to speak the
language of those with whom he associates I will
undertake to assure that gentleman that there are
but few Conservatives m North Carolina, and it
there is one, I have never known or do no i now
remember him When msn there leave the Ad-
ministration, they go over at once into the ranks of
Whiggery They call not at that half-way house
so much commended bj the Senator from Ken-
tucky, [Mr Clai ] thej make but onedaj's jour-
ney from Democrac} to Federalism they do no 
even stop on the way to bau If, men there has
been any change m publ c «enhrnent in North Ca
rohna, unfavorable to the Administration, it has
not been to Consenatism, but to absolute '"r'h'g-
geiy or Federalism, and if such changes are pleas-
ing to the Senator from Virginia, I can onlv *a\,
he also must have greatly changed since he was a
noble competitor wtth the usual occupant of that
seat for that distinguished honor
But, sir, I believe and trust there has been no
change m North Carolina, unfavorable to the ad-
ministration An opinion lounded upon there
being a majority of Opposition members from
that State in the House of Representatives,
would be exceedingly fallacious We seldom
place our elections in North Carolina exclu-
sive!} upon political grounds, and ourfieemen
Kill consult their heaits as -well as tneir heads m the
exercise of their elective franchise I is long
«mee the Administration had a majon v n the
House of Represpnlatives item our State When
m} honorable colleague who fills his 'aticn \ i h so
much honor to himself, and credit to his State
was last elected, there was a majoi } cf oti-
posit on members from that State in the other
House, and \et, upon joint legislative ba'lot, he ob-
tained a majontj of thim 'Vnd when the humble
individual who now addie'ses you was elected,
there was a like majontv in the other House If
is true he received but a bare majony of the \ otes
of the Legislature upon joint ballot, but more than
one Administration countj jn the State had sent an
Opposition member, and if there was a « ngle Op
position county represented bv an 4dm mstiation
man, it has escaped my memory But, Mr Pie-
sident, if the people ot North Taiolma are d - a-
tisfied w ith the couise of their representa i\ es upon
this floor, they know well h >w to s gmf\ that di -
approbation, and they know too, tnat the\ haie
in my colleague and m} seit two obe hem servants
who, when the will of thei- constituent- is commu-
nicated to them in a proper and intelligible man-
ner, Mill eithei conform theieto, 01 b d at'iei to
these halls, "nor cast one longing lingering look
behind "
I ha\e thus endeavored to put aside some of the
prejudices which stand in the way of a fair consid-
eration of this subject, although perhaps v. ith little
success Indeed I hav e never flattered m} self with
the hope of doing moie than the maker oí a chart,
who indicates to the unwary passenger some oí those
rocks and shoals apon which there is danger of his
being wrecked, but has no power to remove them
from their deep foundations.   Having done what I
may, however, m the effort, I proceed to consider
thu, question, in the first place, in its financial bear-
ings that is to say, as a mere method of keeping
and disbursing the public revenue. It Was observed
by Mr   Madison, m the debate in the Virginia
Convention upon the adoption of the Federal Con-
stitution, that "money was the soul of a Govern-
ment."   To this it was replied by the distinguished
Patrick Henry, (one of the most ultra Democrats
of any age or country, and who was altogether op-
posed to entrusting to the Federal Government the
power of levying a revenue,) "shall I take my soul
and give it to a government?"   It was my fortune
the  other day to dme m company with a Revo-
lutionary patriarch, one of those staunch and stur-
dy Democrats who has become a septuagenarian m
the preservation and maintenance of those  very
principles which gave  rise to that great struggle,
"all which he saw and part of which he was "    I
learnt from h'm, wi'htheh ehest satisfaction, that,
in his judgment, this was but a crisis in that great
strife, which had been going on in this nation ever
since it had an existence, and that we were now en-
gaged m  the advoeacs cf those pr neiples upon
which he had  kept his   eye steadily fixed through
bis   whole   life,   and from which he had never
swerved, and, referring to the incident just men-
tioned   between   Mr    Madison and Mr  Henry,
"sha'l the Government," said he, "take its sonl and
deposite it with a soulless corporatirn?" Yes, sir, mo-
ney is the soul of a government its msmofoJe— its
animating principle     Without it government can
ne\ er execute those ends whereto it was constituted,
and, however willing its agents, they can never per
form the behests of their constituents    It is of the
e-sen"e of  the utiht" o? money  that it should
o" commanded at the moment of the exigency, and
1 oul i lot fall matTiaily short in amount of the
regular computat on Inoth°r words that it should
b° readily commanded, and u timately «afe In
both these particular- I insist that the Independent
Treasury has deeidedl} the alvantage over the
proposed substitute And first, as to readiness of
command Of what readiness of command the
deposite with local banks fain'shes, we have before
us a large volume of experience Strongly as we
nerapinvinced by the sudden and general failure
of thTlocal banks, and the vast amount of public
treasure which was thereby locked up and ren-
dered useless to the Government, embracing nearly
the w hole amount of the revente oa hand, that
conviction has gathered strength incalculable by
►he expei íence ot the last lew months A saspen-
s on, wh ch was at fiW declared to be 'emporary, and
deperdent upon mere accidental causes, still con-
tinue-, pithough n¡K>nths have rolled over our heads
since it commenced and no human sagacity can
even now foresee, w th an% cer aiaty, when it will
cease Indeed, I ha^e been credibly informed that
a politician oí much distinction, and not of the
party to which I be'ong, has uttered the opinion
tha' the banks wdl never resume specie payments
But grant that they will resume, we have now
seen enough of the r nature to satisfy us that thc\
will always be liable to a repetition of casualties
similar to the present T-deed that it is acasnalfi

peculiarly propitious and that mst m proportion as
the necessities of the Goierrment become urgent,
-o will the abihtj of the bank- to ft u«h the funds
deposited with them dimmi-h That no stream of
revenue supply can be relie1 upon as long as the
banks are the fountain iron which it must flow
Unlike the Indepeident T>easury receptacles,
which, if anv d a-'er happen- to one, ¡eaves the
r*st entirelv uiaffected the bank-, by a sympathy as
cei!am and pervading as that of the Siamese twins,
feel through the whole svstem any injury to one, of
v hich sj stem that one is but a part Like the elec-
tric spark, such a disaster affects the whole of that
atmosphere, confidence, m which only hanks can
exist for a smgle moment, renders it unfit for their
mysterious respiration, a d they become paralyzed,
and their \ ital lunctions suspended or destroyed
The necessity of banks foi this magic atmosphere
of confidence furnishes, to my mmd, a most con-
