HEADQUARTERS FOURTEENTH ARMY CORPS,Nashville, December 9, 1862-5.50 p.m.

Major-General THOMAS:

Hold Fry's division ready to march down here, if ordered, at 2 or 3 o'clock to-night, and one brigade ready to come sooner, if ordered, by rail. Let Pioneers come first. The enemy is feinting at our front. We think he meas to attack Donelson. What news from your scouts?

By order of Major-General Rosecrans:

J. P. GARESCHE,

Assistant Adjutant-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS FOURTEENTH ARMY CORPS,DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,

Nashville, December 9, 1862

Major-General THOMAS, U. S. Volunteers,

Commanding Center, Gallatin:

What you report shows the necessity of concentrating and of your remaining in command. Fry's division, therefore, must remain. Close Hall in to Hartsville, and, if necessary, to Castalian Springs. The general thinks a brigade hardly necessary at the tunnel. Any way, have it ready to move whenever ordered. Stanley will send you a cavalry regiment forthwith. What truth do you think there is in report of Kirby Smith's being at Lebanon? General wishes you to select good position for fight in case of an attack. If you can hold and whip him, we will try the others.

J. P. GARESCHE,

Assistant Adjutant-General and Chief of Staff.

NASHVILLE, December 9, 1862

Major General GEORGE H. THOMAS:

General desires you to cover you front with a constant cloud of scouts,so as to enable you to concentrate your forces and escape surprise.

J. P. GARESCHE,

Chief of Staff.

GALLATIN, December 9, 1862

Colonel J. P. GARESCHE, Chief of Staff:

I think we can handle Smith here. I will make all dispositions at once. The report of Smith's force and position was brought me by a very reliable scout, whose information I have always found to be correct. I have two or three men out now, and expect more news to-morrow morning. Have not yet heard of Hall. Please have the guns for this fort and ammunition sent here as soon as possible.

GEO. H. THOMAS.

Major-General.
