General DANIEL RUGGLES,

Commanding District No. 1:

GENERAL: Keep the gun, but 1 would not put it put until I had men to guard it. I cannot possibly send men to you now. I should expose Vicksburg to assault by overwhelming numbers from Memphis. If Bragg moves I can then send you a force to take Baton Rouge. I have order transportation to you; keep it always ready. Raise men in mean time. I will have some arms for them.

Yours, &amp;c.,

EARL VAN DORN,
