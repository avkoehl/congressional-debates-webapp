and fitting up of two extensions to tho buildings, to
provide enlarged accommodations for the male and
female pupils and the resident officers of the institu-
tion, §32,240; for th e erection of a brick barn, carriagc-
house, cow-house, shop, gas-house, and ice-house,
$14,500; for the improvement and inclosure of the
gro unds of the institution, including under-drainago
and sewerage, $4,500."
We now come to 1867, and we find by reference to
the act making appropriations for sundry civil ex-
penses, approved March 2, 1867, (14 Laws, p. 464,)
thftt instead of the last appropriation of $12,500 for
salaries and incidental expenses, there was an ap-
propriation of $25,000 for the support of thp institu-
tion, including $1,000 for books and illustfative ap-
paratus, And it was provided "that deaf mutes, not
exceeding ten in number, residing in the several
States and Territories of the United States, ap-
plying for admission to the collegiate department
of the institution, shall be received on the same
terms and conditions as those prescribed by lawfor
residents of the District of Columbia, at the discre-
tion of the president of the institution that is to
say, that the Government, by this proviso, assumes
to maintain and instruct not exceeding ten deaf
mutes residing in the several States and Territories,
who are in indigent circumstances and cannot com-
mand the means to secure an education, and to pay
therefor at the rate of $150 per annum for each deaf
mute; and here is to be observed the constant, ex-
traordinary, and progressive demands of this institu-
tion upon the Government, for this same act appro-
pi iates &51.675 for the erection, furnishing, and fit-
ting up of additions to the buildings of the institu-
tion, to provide and enlarge the accommodations for
the male and female pupils and the resident officers
of tho institution. There is a farther appropriation
in this at t of $7,500 for theimprovement and enlarge-
ment of the grounds of the institution, and $5,000
for an increased supply of Potomac water.
To sum up in regard to the amounts appropriated
by Congress for the Columbia Institution for the
Deaf and Dumb and the Blind, and the Columbia
Institution for the Deaf and Dumb, tho following
official statement from the Secretary of the Interior
is herewith submitted:
Columbia Institution for the Deaf and Dumb, Wash-
ington, D. C.—Private institution not owned by tho
Government, nor the title to the property vested in
the United States. Nor has the United States any
control or supervision whatever over this institution.
Expended in carrying out the purpose? for xohich appro-
priated under supervision of the board of directors.
For the erection, furnishing, and fitting up of addi-
tions to the Columbia Institution for the Deaf and
Dumb §168,280 87
For supplying the building with gas-mak-
ij'g apparatus and fixtures  1,470 00
Tor the erection of a brick barn, carriage
houso, cow house, &c..  14,500 00
For furnishing an increased supply of Po-
tomac water, &*c  5,000 00
For supplying tho institution with steam
heating apparatus, &c  2,250 00
For the enlargement of the grounds  7,280 00
For inclosure, grading, and improvement
of grounds  8,000 00
For salaries and incidental expenses for
instruction of deal and dumb  89,500 00
For maintenance and tuition of pupils  29,359 51
$325,560 38
After the appropriation of so large asum of money
as $325,560 38 for the institution, and in view of the
fact that we are now asked to appropriate a further
sum of £-51,000 for the same purpose, which, if appro-
priated, would make a total of' $376,560 38, it would
seem t"> be the duty of Congress to inquire into the
obligations and the rights of the Government in the
premises. The original obligation on the partof tho
Government, which was a very just and proper one
to be assumed, was to pay a certain sum per annum
to the institution it had incorporated for the main-
tenance and tuition of such deaf and dumb and
blind persons, propeily belonging to the District,
who were in indigent circumstanccs and could not
command the means to secure an education. This
was al 1 thatseomed to bo expected of the Government;
and if Congress were to undertake to maintain and
educate the deaf and dumb and blind of theDistrict,
who were in indigent circumstances.it would seem
to have been proper to maintain and educate them at
an institution in the District, if the same could bo
done on the same terms as at an equally good insti-
tution outside of the District. The provision of law
by which the institution was authorized to receive
and instruct deaf and dumb and<blind persons from
any of the States and Territories on terms to be
agreed upon, implied that it was to be an institution
that should be self-supporting—an institution which,
with the contributions made by benevolent persons,
would support itself, In compliance with the law,
annual icports have been made by the institution to
the Secretary of the Interior. The first report was
made for the fiscal year ending 30th of June, 185S, by
•which it appears that the institution received from
the United States, for the maintenance and tuition
of beneficiaries, by the act of February 16, 18o7,
£2,125 25; and salaries and incidental expenses by
the act of May 29,1S58, $8,000; and other amounts by
subscription and otherwise, making a total, up to
that time, of 66,513 25; and the expenditures that
are given are a little less than that amount. The
number of deaf and dumb pupils was twelve, and
the number of blind pupils six, and all from the
District of Columbia with one exception; but it is
not stated in this report how many of these were
beneficiaries of the Government, and how many wore
pay pupils. According to the regulations of the
institution affixed to the report, pay pupils were to
pay 0150 per annum.
The second report of the institution, for the year
ending June 30, 1859, shows that $5,451 96 were re-
ceived from the Government and $1,158 91 from other
sources, and the expenditures were very nearly the
same sum. There were this year fourteen deaf and
dumb pupils and seven blind pupils, all but three
being from the District of Columbia; and it is not
shown by this report how many were Government
beneficiaries and how many were paypupils.
The report for the year ending June 30, I860, shows
receipts$6,509 26: the amount received from Govern-
ment being $5,759 26, and $750 from other sources, and
the expenses were about the same. The number of
deaf and dumb pupils was twenty-four, the number
of blind pupils was six.
Thf report for tho year ending Juno 30,1861, shows
the receipts from the Government $0,425 94. and
$1,700 25 from other sources, making in all $8-126 19,
and the expenditures very near tho same amouat.
Number of deaf and dumb pupils, twenty-four; and
number of blind pupils, six.
The report for the year ending June 30,1862, shows
the same number of deaf and dumb and the same
number of blind pupils, and that the institution re-
ceived that year from the Government and other
sources the sum,of $8,863 49, and the expenditures
varying a very little from this amount.
The report for the year ending June 30.1S63, shows
there were forty-nine deaf and dumb pupils and five
blind pupils, but only nineteen of these were from
tho Districtof Columbia. The amountreceivcd from
Government and other sources was $1,050 49, the ex-
penditures tho same.
The report for the year ending June 30,1864, shows
there were fifty-six deaf and dumb and six blind
pupils, but twenty-four of whom were from the Dis-
trictof Columbia. The receiptsof the institution this
yearwere $13,085 16, and expenditures, $13,475 67.
The report for the year ending June 30,1865, shows
eighty-five deaf and dumb pupils and nine blind
pupils, thirty-five of whom were from theDi&trictof
Columbia and belonging to the Army. The receipts
were $21,782 24, of which sum $11,775 was received
from tho Treasury of theUnited States; the expend-
itures, $22,602 30.
'The report for the year ending June 30,1866, shows
one hundred and seven deaf and dumb pupils and
no blind pupils, thoinstitution having procured them
to be detached from it. Only twenty-two of this
number of one hundred and seven belonged to the
Districtof Columbia and to the Army. Tho receipts
were. $26,838 41—^15,937 50 being from the Treasury
of the United States. It will bo perceived that, for
the year ending June 30,1865, with thirty-five pupils
from tho District of Columbia, there was received
from the Government $11,775. In the year ending
June SO, 1866, with twenty-two pupils from the Dis-
trict of Columbia and the Army, there was received
from the Treasury $15,937 50. It will thus be seen, in
ttie year ending June 30, 1865, that, instead of the
$150 per annum, which the Government obligated
itself to pay for each pupil, it actually paid £336 43
for that year; and for the year ending Juno 30,1866,
instead of the $150 per annum, it actually paid
$724 43 per annum for each pupil.
From the last report, which is the tenth annual
report, for tho year ending J une 30,1867, there were
one hundred and seventeen deaf and dumb pupils,
and twenty-five from the District of Columbia and
from the Army. The receipts of the institution were
$33,661 07; the expenses were the same amount.
It appears from an examination of tho reports th at
there were at this institution deaf, dumb, and bli nd
pupils fiom the Districtof Columbia and from the
Army, as follows:
1558  17
185 9  18
186 0  20
186 1  25
186 2  24
186 3  16
186 4  24
186 5  35
186 6  22
1867   25
Total 226
Equal to aboutfifty-sixpupilsinall, as it is estimated
each pupil is at the institution for four years.
It has been shown herein from official sources that
the sums appropriated by Congress fortius institu-
tion up to the present time, for salaries and inci-
dental expenses, buildings and grounds, for supply of
Potomac water, forearriage-house, barn, cow-house,
shop, ice-house, gas-house, and for inclosing, grading,
and improving the grounds, amount to §32o,860 38;
this is the sum which it has cost the Government to
maintain and educatc two hundred and twenty-six
pupils; or, in other words, each pupil has cost the
Government the sum of $7,20210. The statement is
put in this way for the reason that the Government
has no interest whatever in the property of this insti-
tution, and hasnocontrolordirection inits manage-
ment. The institution is under no obligation to tho
Government whatever after all of these appropria-
tions, except to maintain and cducatc the indigent
deaf and dumb of the District and of the Army who
cannot command means to secure an education for
the sum of$150 per annum. It seems extraordinary
that Congress should have gone on from year to
year making these large appropriations for this insti-
tution without reserving to itself any right or control
whatever. The Government has had no voice what-
ever in tbe expenditure of tho money appropriated.
It appears that the only bond ever given by any one
for tho faithful disbursement of the money appropri-
ated by the Government to this institution was a bond
for 43,000, given by the superintendent in March, 1802,
and theaceounts o£the disbursement in tbe various
reports are not satisfactory. A statement of the ex-
penditures in detail is hereto annexed. Although the
Government appropriates fors&laries and incidental
expenses, and for the,support of tho institution, it
has no voice in fixing the number of teachers and
the rate of salary; and the report ending Juno 30,
1867, shows that the large sum of $14,732 56 was
expended for salaries and wages.
The following statement from the Register'* office
of the Treasury Department, dated March 31,1868, is
interesting as showing tho increase of the expenses
of the institution from year to year for salaries and
incidental expenses:

As will be observed, Governmenthas had but little
to do with the institution except to appropriate *ts
money and to require reports to be made to the Inte-
rior Department. The Interior Department has, in
its annual reports to the President, made reference
to this institution for the information of Congress,
and it has sometimes attempted to cheek the as-
sumptions of the institution. Hon. O. II. Browning,
Secretary of the Interior, in his annual report of
November 19,1866, speaking of this institution, says:
" This is not a Government institution. The Uni-
ted States have no control over it, nor are they vested
with the title to the property purchased with their
munificent benefactions. It had its origin in the
generous purpose of public spirited individuals to
secure a home and tho means of intellectual and
moral training for the indigent children of this Dis-
trict who were blind or deaf and dumb."
The Secretary further says:
"The directors submit the following estimate for
the next year: §25,000 for thesupport of the institu-
tion, and $62,175 for buildings and improvements,
making an aggregate of $87,175, being $15,235 in
excess of the last appropriations for the same objects.
" The expediency of granting so large a sum is sub-
mitted for consideration. If it is the intention of
Congress to pay thesalaries of the officers and teach-
ers, and to provide merely for those who are entitled
under existing laws to tho privileges of the institu-
tion at the charge of the Government the sum of
$25,000 is fully adequate to the purpose. But it has
been suggested that the advanced department should
be maintained on such a footing that the deaf mutes
of tho several States on eompletingtheirpreliminary
studies may enjoy, free of charge, the privileges
of a course of instruction equal to that pursued in
the best American colleges. Such persons, if in indi-
gent circumstances, have been heretofore maintained
and educated at the State establishments at the ex-
pense of the State, to which they belong. The direct-
ors conceive that an institution which offers advan-
tages * which cannot be afforded in thelacal institu-
tions should be as free to the citizens of the States as
to those of the Federal District and to children of
the Army and Navy.' There is in my judgment an
obvious distinction between the exercise by Congress
of its conceded power to legislate for the local wants
of this District and for the.Army and Navy, and its
assumption of a power which has wisely and to the
fullest extent been conferred upon the States. No
neecssity whatever exists for the erection of addi-
tional buildings to meetpresentwants."
"The whole subject is respectfully presented for
consideration, in connection with the estimates fur-
nished by the board. In my opinion no further sums
should be advanced until the charter of the institu-
tion be so modified as to secure to the Government
an efficient control in its management, and a proper
accountability in the application and disbursements
of the funds appropriated.1'
The Secretary of the Interior, in his last report of
November 18,1867, refers still further to this " Colum-
bia Institution for the Deaf and Dumb." Alter speak-
ing of the character of the institution, he says;
*' I am,nevertheless, of the opinion that when Con-
gress shall have liberally provided for the indigent
deuf mutes who reside in this District, or are the chil-
dren of persons actually in the military or naval
service, it will have fully discharged its duty, if not
exhausted its constitutional power over the subject.
The present buildings arc more than sufficient for the
ample accommodation of tho Government pupils.
The board of directors, in addition to the school for
the primary brandies, desires to maintain a prepara-
tory department, where the deaf mutesof the several
States mav be prepared for admission into thocollego
proper. The studies in the latter will embrace as
thorough and comprehensive a course of instruction
in ancient and modern languages, and intholiterary
and scientific branches, as is furnished in the best
American colleges. The indigent deaf mutes of the
several States who are competent to profit by these
advantages are to be maintained and instructed at
the expenseof the General Government. It certainly
was not the original intention ©f Congress to provide
for the gratuitous instruction of these afflicted per-
sons. If unable to incur the expenses of an educa-
tion they should appeal to individual munificence,
or to that of the States in which they reside. The
support of paupers is an appropriate subject of State
legislation, and has never been regarded i<s failing
within the piovince or constituting a duty of tho
