CITY POINT, VA., September 14, 1864.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Washington:

I will leave here to-morrow morning for the Shenandoah Valley to see Sheridan. Will not pass through Washington either going or coming unless it is the wish of the President or Secretary of War I should do so. Everything is very quiet here, and all indications are that it will remain so until I take the offensive.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

WASHINGTON, September 14, 1864-10 p.m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

If anything should require your presence here notice will be given. At present there is no reason to change your plans.

E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, September 14, 1864-10.30 a.m. (Received 10.45 a.m.)

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

Reports from corps commanders indicate nothing extraordinary to report this morning. Major-General Birney states that the recent advance of Hancock's picket-line has drawn on his line incessant picket-firing, increasing his casualties, and that he has taken measures to stop it. There is at present sharp cannonading going on in Birney's front, which I presume to be the measure he indicated he would take. A special report of the cause has been called for.

GEO. G. MEADE,Major-General.

CITY POINT, September 14, 1864.

Major-General MEADE:

What is the heavy firing now heard about?

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, September 14, 1864-11.10 a.m. (Received 11.15 a.m.)

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

In reply to your telegram, just received, I send you a dispatch* from Birney, received simultaneously, which confirms the view I took in my last dispatch. Major-General Birney has been directed to make a special report so soon as his present experiment is over as tot he result, and hereafter not to open his batteries under similar circumstances without first referring to these headquarters, as I am somewhat doubtful of the efficacy of his plan of stopping picket-firing, and the expenditure of ammunition is becoming a question of some importance.

GEO. G. MEADE,Major-General.
