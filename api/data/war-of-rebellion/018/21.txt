General W. S. ROSECRANS, Wheeling:

General McClellan requests to be informed as to what is the disposition of and strength of your forces, having relation to Romney and Moorefield.

General Banks has pursued the enemy as far as Woodstock. He thinks Jackson's forces and those of Longstreet are being united for operations on either side of the mountains at Luray and Washington. Shields' division is about Strasburg. Please communicate with General Banks and Shields and co-operate with them, if necessary, and you can properly do so under your instructions.
