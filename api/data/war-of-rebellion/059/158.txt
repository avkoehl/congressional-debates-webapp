HEADQUARTERS SIXTEENTH ARMY CORPS,Memphis, Tenn., March 26, 1864.

Major General W. T. SHERMAN,

Nashville, Tenn.:

Dispatches of 24th are received. Veatch is ordered up the Tennessee to act as circumstances may require. I believe Forrest proposes to cross the river. I have not asked for any more troops, nor have I proposed to resign. Veatch is delayed at Cairo for want of transportation. The naval officers are informed of Forrest's movement.

S. A. HURLBUT,

Major-General.

CAIRO, March 26, 1864.

Major General W. T. SHERMAN,

Commanding:

My troops are now embarking, and I shall leave at 12 m. to-day. Sent one regiment to Paducah last night to re-enforce that post. Town has been burnt. Hicks still holds the fort. Rebels said to be in possession of the town. The Tennessee is probably obstructed above Paducah. I shall push forward. Dispatch may reach me at Metropolis.

JAMES C. VEATCH,

Brigadier-General.

CHATTANOOGA, March 26, 1864.

Major General G. H. THOMAS,

Commanding:

GENERAL: My operator at Smithland, Ky., informs me that the enemy, 2,500 strong, under Forrest, attacked Paducah yesterday at 1 p. m. and were repulsed, losing 400 killed. Our loss only 2 wounded. He says the city was in flames last night all night. The garrison defended the fort only, and the rebel loss was incurred in several attempts to carry the fort by assault. His information was by boat from Paducah, and up to 10 this a. m. Reports at Smithland say rebels are crossing Tennessee River at or near Chandits [?]; 1,500 are said to be on east side Tennessee River to-day. Line is working to Smithland still, and I have instructed the man to send any and all information he may receive.

Very respectfully,

JOHN C. VAN DUZER,

Captain and Asst. Supt. U. S. Military Telegraph.
