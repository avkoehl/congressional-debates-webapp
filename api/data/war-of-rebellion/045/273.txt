LEESBURG,, VA., June 23, 1863-midnight.

General D. BUTTERFIELD, Chief of Staff:

Chick's Ford is 1 mile below Noland's. It is practicable for cavalry and infantry, but not for artillery or trains. White's Ford is about the same; the bottom is rough. Seneca Ford, 2 miles below Goose Creek, is said to be good. I will send an officer to it early to-morrow. The approaches to all these fords are good. My wagon train is parked near the bridge at Edwards Ferry, and can be run across without delay.

H. W. SLOCUM,

Major-General.
