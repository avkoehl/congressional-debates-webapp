General Schofield, with two divisions (one under General Blunt, of the Kansas, and the other under General Totten, of the Missouri troops), entered Newtonia on the 4th, driving the enemy out under the fire of cannon. Casualties trifling. Glad to see my forces are uniting.

Numbers 2. Report of Brigadier General John M. Schofield, U. S. Army.*

NEWTONIA, MO., October 4, 1862.

I entered this place this morning with General Blunt's and General Totten's division, each about 6,000 strong. The enemy's force was not concentrated and he offered but feeble resistance. A running artillery fight of about two hours' duration was the only engagement that could be brought on. Only trifling loss on either side. Intercepted dispatches indicate that the enemy will concentrate for a stand at a point about 6 miles south of this place. If so, I shall attack him to-morrow.
