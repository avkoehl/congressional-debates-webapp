General R. TAYLOR,

Tupelo:

Your two dispatches of yesterday received. General Brandon informs me that he has called on General Gardner to order Colonel Denis, with First Brigade of Reserves, to report to him, to enable him to execute orders of War Department. As it received orders from General [Brandon], he had the right to recall them now, unless you object, when the law requires the matter be referred to War Department. Have informed him that the brigade can possibly be spared to report to him in a few days.

E. SURGET,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
