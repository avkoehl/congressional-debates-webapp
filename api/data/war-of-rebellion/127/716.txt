The report of the same is transmitted to you herewith. * An effort to have these regiments received into the Confederate service succeeded and they are now employed in that capacity. The expenses, however, in consequence of their organization and the time they were retained in the field previous to their reception in the Confederate Army, devolve upon the State, and it will remain with your honorable body to adopt measures to meet them. It was thought prudent to secure to the State all the ammunition which could be obtained from merchants at this and other points. Therefore it was purchased, a small amount it is true, but it is well that it should be in the possession of the State, by which it may be used as emergencies may require. Some flint-lock muskets, which had for a long time been the property of the State, were caused to be altered by contract into percussion muskets and otherwise improved. hey are limited in number but are now equal in efficiency to the most improved arms of like character. An order has been issued to have manufactured several pieces of ordnance at Glaveston foundry and also a number at Lavaca. These minute transactions have been mentioned because they were performed without authority from the Legislature. Of their propriety it requires neither explanation nor argument to convince you, and it is only necessary to bring the action respectfully to your attention in order that you may approve and sustain it. In the deficiency of an adequate supply of State arms, and in view of the fact that if it became necessary to repel an invasion we should be forced to depend upon the private arms in the hands of individuals, it was determined to ascertain as far as practicable the number of these upon which we might rely. A request was issued to the chief justice of each county to institute an inquiry for this purpose, and the result, as far as it is known, is highly gratifying. Forming and estimate from the returns which have already been received, the number of these arms will not fall short of 40,000. With this fact as a basis, your honorable body may, perhaps, think it judicious to provide the means for having these arms put in a condition for service and so situated that thy can be made available.

Upon the 17th of April a requisition was mad upon the Executive of Texas by the Honorable Secretary of War for 3,000 men, and upon the 24th of the same month an additional requisition for 5,000 was received. These troops were to be infantry. They were to be organized and drilled and held in a state of perfect readiness, but were not to be mustered into service unless it was under a subsequent call. Proclamations were accordingly issued calling upon the people to organized themselves into companies. This was done with great pidering the scattered condition of our population and the natural aversion to infantry service. The first demand, however, for their active services was a requisition from the War Department for twenty companies to go to Virginia. These companies, which had been organized in obedience to an order from the Secretary of War for twelve months, were now required to be mustered in for the war. This change was productive of some dissatisfaction and occasioned a trivial delay. Not much time had elapsed, however, before the required number of companies were ready, and the Confederate officer to whom the Executive had been authorized to report them was notified of the fact that he could take them under his control.
