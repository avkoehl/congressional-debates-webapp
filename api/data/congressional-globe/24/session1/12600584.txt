Confess to that aiticle,rii>es not remote theevil
rorw ould it restoie to it the republican chatacter.
It would «¡till bo a Government which tolerated
the crossed tyranny I believe, therefore, such
admisión to be contrary to the spirit, if not the
letttr, of the Constitution.
The instrument does not secure to the people
n republican form ot gov eminent. It pei mits the
existence of the most degrading and absolute
species of domestic slavery, and actually prohibits
the legislative branch of the Government from
passing taws to remove it It places the slave
further bev ond the reach of human laws or any
of its íemedies than it does the property the citi-
zen may hold in inanimate matter. While the
Legisla'ure may pass a law taking from you your
personal property without your consent, on re-
turning a fan equivalent, it is forbidden to liber-
ate your slave, without consent, for any com-
pensation I am aware that an opinion prevails
throughout a large portion of the Union, and is
honestly entertained by a large, honorable, and
intelligent class of citizens, that a Government
may be republican in its form, and still permit
domestic slavery, and they gravely refer us to
the laws and usages of ancient republics to sustain
them The truth of this proposition depends
upon the fact whether the Constitution recognizes
slavery, or whether it be a usage which has grown
up into a custom by common consent, aside fiom
any constitutional provision or sanction In the
first instance, it becomes a fundamental ord inance,
which rises above all law: in the second, it is a
custom merely, or a law springing from legisla-
tive enactments, in which case it is under the
control and regulation of the law-making power.
In the first instance the Government is in fault:
in the other, the moral condition of the municipal
regulations The one is, or ought to be, under
the supervision of the General Government the
other under that of the State authorities In the
first instance, the Government cannot be called
republican: in the other, it may. But, sir, aside
from these distinctions, it may be safely affirmed
that a republican government that recognizes sla-
very in its fundamental code, is a gross political
solecism, and it can obtain no sanction from the
laws and usages of the ancient States. Politicians
of the present age should be aware that a polit-
ical argument, in íelation to our national policy,
founded upon a supposed resemblance between
the tenor and spirit of our Government and those
of ancient republics, affords but a feeble authority
in defense of the errors of the latter. The term
republican, as applied to the science of govern-
ment with us, does not borrow its import from the
schools of antiquity. Its legitimate application
■was ascertained and established by the political
philologists of the Revolution The doctors of
those days knew best how to apply terms of gov-
ernment to their appropriate ideas. They affixed
names to a set of principles that laid the founda-
tion of our happy and much admired foim of
Government By a practical experience in the
school of adversity, they became familiarly ac-
quainted with the use of those principles, and
were enabled to assign them their appropriate
objects in the various depaitments of human soci-
ety. They tell us "they hold these truths to be
self-evident, that all men are created equal; that
they arc endowed by their Creator with certain
inalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty,
and the pursuit of happiness, that, to secure these
rights, Governments aie instituted among men,
deriving their just powers from the consent of the
governed " These are the political axioms upon
which our beautiful and noble Constitution was
founded They compose theelements from which
it denved its existence, its spirit, and by which
it is sustained, and when it speaks of a republican
form of government, it contemplates one that
embodies and supports these axioms—one that
combines all, and is repugnant to none of them.
How does the constitution of Arkansas com-
port with this description' Does it teach that all
men are created equal' That they are endowed
with the inalienable right of liberty and the pursuit
of happiness?   Or does tt hold m substance that
one part of mankind are boin the slaves of the
other' That they are esteemed in the lij;ht of
natuie as pioperty, and the unwilling victims of
avarice and speculation' Lot the ninth aiticle of
the constitution of Arkansas answer the question
By that article the slaves of Aikansas are sunk
a grade below the brute beasts that herd in your
plains, or the flocks that feed upon the hill
While it treats the slaves as the personal prop-
erty of the master, it holds them less protected
by the laws of God and man than your beasts of
buidcn. Yes, sir, while the common law of the
land so far regards the lights and comforts of the
domestic animal, that its cruel tioatment will
subject him who inflicts it to an indictment and
punishment at law, this ordinance loaves the pio-
tection of the slave a contingent right, depending
upon the unceitainty of human legislation It
imposes upon the slave the most rigid exactions
to obedience of the laws of the S ate, while it
denies him the right to paiticipate in their enact-
ment In short, sir, to give a synopsis of the
whole parallel which may be fairly di awn between
the Constitutions of the United States and of
Arkansas, the former assumes, upon the pnn-
ciples of our Declaration of Rights, that all men
aie born equal, and have an equal voice in the
formation of that Government by which they are
protected and governed, while the latter denies
such natural equality, and holds that some men are
born slaves, and have no natural right to partici-
pate in the formation of that Governmentto which
they are responsible These form antagonist
theses, and assert principles so ample in their
influence upon the science of politics, and yet so
opposite in their natuies and discordant in their
tendency, that they cannot but give rise to re-
spective forms of government, which in their
character, result, and moral action, will be the
antipodes of each othei If this bo so, is there
not danger that by the admission of a State with
such a form given to its original and fundamental
ordinance, we give to the Confederacy such con-
flicting interests and principles of action as to
endanger the peace, the harmony and the safety
of the Union'
The important and impending question then
properly recurs, whether the letter or the spirit
of the Fedeial Constitution will authorize Con-
gress to admit to the bosom of ournatioml Union
the State of Arkansas, while Us constitution or
fundamental ordinance embodies political ele-
ments hostile to personal liberty and the inalien-
able rights of its citizens
I am aware that it will be, as it already has
been, contended that, by the Missoun compromise,
as it has been pieposterously termed, Congiess
has parted with its right to prohibit the mtioduc-
tion of slavery within any part of the territory of
the Louisiana purchase south of 36° 30' noith lati-
tude There are, to my mind, two substantial
and unansweiable objections to the soundness of
that proposition. In the first place, theie was no
compromise or compact whereby Congiess siu-
rendered any power or yielded any jurisdiction,
and in the second place, if it had done so, it was
a meie legislative act, that could not bind their
successors; it would be subject to repeal at the
will of any succeeding Congiess There wa„ no
compromise or surrender on the pait of the Gen-
eral Government In the senos of acts and íes-
olutions passed on that occasion, there were a
number of reservations of power and n°-ht, and
some restuctions imposed upon the constitution
of Missouri, but in no part of the history of that
case can you find a solitary act of relinquishment.
By the act of Congiess of the 6th March, 1820,
authorizing the people of the Territory of Mis-
souri to form a constitution and State government,
theie were two very important restrictions im-
posed upon the convention in relation to this very
subject By the proviso to the fourth section,
they were requned to form a constitution repub-
lican in its form, and not íepugnant to that of the
United States, and by the eighth section, slavery
and involuntary servitude were forever prohibited
in " all that pai t of the territory ceded by France
to the United States lying noith of 36° 30' of north
latitude, and not included within the limits of that
State " Under this act the people of Missouri,
on the 12th of June of the same year, called a
convention, and agicod upon a constitution em-
bracing an aiticle in pn lnplc picci^elj like that
in the ninth article of the constitution of Ailnn-
sas, piohibitin^ its Geroial Assembly ft oin pass-
ing any law emancipating ¡>1 ivoi, vv lthout the con-
sent of the ownei Thoie was anotlui clan-e in
their constitution equally upugnint to civil lib-
erty, which piohibitt d fiec ik gioes an J mulattoes

whatever This constitution was submit'cd to
Congress at its next session, and give use to a
discussion which, whetln r we consider its pio-
tiaoted length, or the thrilling inteirst it excited
throughout the country,has never been suipasscd
on any other occasion in thn annals of oui legis-
lation. This fearful war of words,, which put in
jeopardy the Union itself, resulted in the adop-
tion of a resolution by Congress admitting that
State into the Union, upon the fundamental con-
dition that the convention should repeal the foui th
clause of the twenty-sixth section of the third ar-
ticle in her constitution, which authorizes her
Legislature to pass laws prohibiting "fiee negroes
and mulattoes from settling in that State, under
any pretext whatever," and pledge the faith of
the State that no such law ever should be passed.
The convention of Missouri assented to the re-
striction imposed by the resolution,and complied
with the condition, and, by a subsequent provis-
ion of the Geneial Government, she was admit-
ted into the Union without the addition of one
word or one syllable in relation to the subject of
slavery.
Where, sir, permit me to ask, can you find, in
all these the terms of a compromise, in law or in
fact' Surely there is nono expressed, and it
would be dangerous to admit one by implication.
The first act expiessly requires her to establish
a republican form of government, and positively
forbids the introduction of slavery into any part
of the Territory out of which that State was
carved, north of a certain line of latitude And
the subsequent resolution of Congress of 1821 re-
quncs of the convention to expunge fiom the
constitution another exceptionable aiticle in re-
lation to fiee negioes and mulattoes, to which
requisition it implicitly complied. But,sn, wheie
will you find an act of concession or sunendery'
The clear inference to be drawn from a careful
examination of the whole case is, that Congress
never did relinquish her prerogative of power or
jurisdiction ovei any pait of this subject or Ter-
ritory The most that can be said of the subse-
quent act of admission of that new State, with
that exceptionable clause in her constitution, will,
I apprehend, amount to this, that the General
Government slept upon its rights, and suffeied the
Constitution, by its culpable negligence, (winch,
be it known, received the merited rebuke of the
people,) to be violated in one of its most solemn
and sacred provisions.
But, sir, lftheie weie a compact or compromise,
who were the parties' Now, I suppose, in legis-
lation and diplomacy, as in law, to evei y compact
theie must be at least two parties. The Fedeial
Government and the soveieignty of Missoun
were the parties litigant, or contiacting parties.
Concede, for the aigumcnt, that this tiansactior 
should be dignified with the solemnity of a com-
promise , what weio its teims ' Why, that Mis-
souri should come into the Union, bringing with
her a fundamental law perpetuating slavery, and
that she should relinquish her right to prohibit
free negroes and mulattoes from settling in that
State. Admit this to be a compact, and the terms
just recited the articles of stipulation, what con-
nection oi relation docs it bear to the constitu-
tion of Arkansas' What right or power had
Missouri to makeacompactorcompromisewhich
should act,pi ospectively, over a new, uninhabited,
and then unsurveyed wilderness, wholly without
its boundaues' What right had Missouri to
dictate terms of admission to a State not then
in existence ' Surely, if such compromise had
been formed, the people of Arkansas would have
been at full liberty to disavow it It could not
bind them, neithei could it the General Govern-
ment This is not a compromise, not even as
it regards Missoun, much less in its opeiation
upon the rights and immunities of the people of
Arkansas
