THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
December 12.
to argue that therefore it should be suspended in
Ohio. What imaginable reason was there for de-
claring it suspended in Ohio when it was done ? I
have been able to assign but one. There may have
been men going about the State arguing before
thepeoplethattheyoughttoelect men to office who
would oppose the abolition policy of the Presi-
dent. It was thought that such men might be in-
timidated, or punished if not intimidated. It would
be best not to discuss the policy of the Adminis-
tration, for fear the people might talse sides against
it. There may have been, and may be, other rea-
sons for setting aside the great writ. But they
have not occurred to me. As long as the people
will retain the power to employ the writ of habeas
corpus, public liberty will stand.
The brave northern Democracy agree with Mr.
Sumner in one thing. I hope they will take no
offense. I mean that they think the rebels cannot
be overcome as long as the southern people are
united against us. They propose to divide the
people of the South, but not in the way of Mr.
Scmxer. They propose to convince the %vorld
that the United States Government will be th_c
same after the rebel armies are whipped that it
was before the rebellion. They propose to show
mankind that our side must go according to the
rules of civilized warfare. They propose to di-
vide the white people of the South, by showing
that our side is humane and just, and vigorous anil
determined. From the bottom of my heart I
thank the Democrats of the North for the noble
stand they have taken against the Administration.
And I think I can safely say that the Union men
of the border States will cooperate with them.
Mr. COX obtained the floor, but yielded to
Mr. HOLMAN, who moved that the commit-
tee rise.
The motion was agreed to.
So the committee rose; and Mr. Bcftin-ton

EXECUTIVE COMMUNICATION.
' The PRESIDENT pro tempore laid before the
Senate a communication from the Secretary of the
Navy, transmitting, in answer to a resolution of
the Senate of the 8th instant, information in rela-
tion to what congressional district has more than
two midshipmen at the Naval Academy, under
what law appointed, and by whom recommended;
which, on motion of Mr. Hale, was referred to
the Committee on Naval Affairs, and ordered to
be printed.
INTERNAL REVENUE.
Mr. WRIGHT. Mr. President, I rise to call
the attention of the honorable Senator from Maine,
the chairman of the Committee on Finance, to a
bill that lias passed the House of Representatives
proposing an amendment to the internal revenue
law. It involves the question of stamps, &c. A
bill has passed the House of Representatives
unanimously, extending the time, during which
stamps may be dispensed with, to the 1st of
March, and making one or two other amendments.
1 desire to know whether that bill will be reported
at an early day , and whether there is a probability
that it will receive the favorable action of the Com-
mittee on Finance. It is a matter of great interest
to the people of distant portions of the country;
affecting, as it docs, the whole subject of convey-
ances. I know that it isa subjcct on which Sena-
tors are callcd every day to give information to
their constituents; and I desire in this public man-
ner to know of the chairman of the Committee on
Finance, the honorable Senator from Maine,
whether the measure will leceive the assent of his
committee.
Mr. FESSENDEN. I presume there can be
no sort of objection to stating that that proposed
change in the law, deferring its operation so far
as it relates to rendering invalid instruments with-
out stamps until the 1st of March next, was unan-
imously concurred in by the Committee on Fi-
nance, and I presume there will be 110 objection
to it. It does not change the law in any particular
with regard to the imposition of stamps after the
date fixed; but it postpones until the 1st of March
the operation of so much of the law as provided
that instruments not stamped according to law
should be invalid. That is the bill of the House
of Representatives, to which I presume there will
be no objection.
Mr. POWELL. I hope that the bill to which
the Senator refers will be speedily passed. The
portion of the country from which I come is deeply
interested m it. Deeds are made there, and we
cannot put them on record because wo cannot get
a stamp in any direction in any part of that coun-
try.
Mr. FESSENDEN. The operation of the act,
so far as it affects the validity of instruments not
stamped, is already postponed to the 1st of Jan-
uary, so that they are perfectly good and can be
recorded without any trouble. This bill postpones
it still longer. There was an amendmentmade to
the taiiff bill by which that was effected.
Mr. POWELL. 1 was not aware of that. I
looked through the revenue lav/ and I had great
doubts about it.
Mr. FESSENDEN. We put several amend-
ments on the tariff bill with reference to the in-
terns! revenue bill; and that was one of them.
KSIITIONS AND MEMORIALS.
Mr. HARLAN presented the petition of George
T. Wiggins, for damages on account of the seiz-

tion. I move to reconsider the vote by which the
bill (S. No. 403) relating to appointments in the
naval service was indefinitely postponed yester-
day.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. That motion
will be entered.

Mr. ANTHONY. Iam instructed by the Com
mittee on Printing, to whom was referred a reso
lution for printing five thousand copies of the Pres-
ident's message, with the reports of the Secretaries,
to report it back without amendment, and recom-
mend its passage. I ask for its present consider-
ation.
The resolution was considered by unanimous

Mr. ANTHONY. I am instructed, by the same
committee, to repoi t back a resolution for printing
extracopiesof the President's message; and 1 ask
for its present consideration.
There being no objection, the Senate proceeded
to consider the resolution. It is as follows:
Resolved, That ten thousand extra copies of the Presi-
dent's message and accompanying documents be printed,
omitting the statistical matter, and one thousand copies
with the statistical matter for tho use o( the Senate.

In oider that the views of tho Secretaiy of the Inteiior
upon the vaiiou* subject-! treated of in these repoits may
bo the moie fully understood,
Be it farther resolved, That &o much of his report be
priit^d therewith uÂ«" relate to the same subject.
Mr. ANTHONY. I move to amend the res-
olution, by adding " iivo hundicd copies of tho
report of the Metropolitan Police Board, for the
use of that board."
The amendment was agreed to.
Mr. ANTHONY. This is the same number
of copies as were printed last year. Some Sen-
atorf* have suggested that there eight to be a larger
number of the full message with the documents;
and some have suggested that thci-e ought not to
be so many of the message without the accom-
panying documents. The commit tee have re-
ported the usual resolution, the same that was
repot râ€”d Inst year; and I doWre to call the atten-
Inn Â«>f lhe Semite to if, so ih'U if any Senator
desires any modiiiucuion, he may have ;m oppor-

Mr. II ALE. As the Senate is not full, perhaps
