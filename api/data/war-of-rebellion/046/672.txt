I think in less than ten minutes the fog again obscured them from view, when the firing ceased, excepting an occasional shell from Fort Moultrie, which was thrown near the obstructions to annoy and drive away the enemy's launches, if in the vicinity.

About 6.30 a. m. the fog again drifted way, and the fleet, including six monitors and the Ironsides, was seen drifting in the direction of their present position, about 2,000 yards distant from Fort Moultrie; the batteries mentioned before again opened fire upon it and continued until it was beyond effective range, when firing ceased, the fleet moving rapidly off.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

SIR: I have the honor to report that on yesterday, about 12 m., a monitor moved up to within or about 1,700 or 1,800 yards of Fort Moultrie, and opened fire upon that fort; the fire was returned, and the monitor, after firing 2 or 3 shells, which burst short, returned.

Between 2 and 3 p. m. four monitors approached, perhaps 200 yards nearer, and opened fire upon Fort Moultrie with rifled and 15-inch guns. The fort mentioned, with Battery Beauregard and the batteries adjoining Fort Moultrie, engaged them for some two hours, when they withdrew. The enemy fired, I think, 40 or 50 shots without doing damage to the batteries or inflicting injury upon officers or men.

I will forward a report of the amount of ammunition expended.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WM. BUTLER,

Colonel, Commanding.

Captain EDWARD WHITE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARTILLERY,Sullivan's Island, September 2, 1863.

SIR: I have the honor to report that on last night, a short time before 11 o'clock, six monitors came within range of the guns of Fort Moultrie and the batteries to the right and left, manned by Companies D and K, First South Carolina [Regular] Infantry, and opened fore at close range upon Fort Sumter. Fire was opened upon them from the batteries mentioned and Fort Moultrie, and as it was distinctly seen that many shot struck them, the fire was continued until they withdrew, just before daylight this morning, being under fire about five hours.

I think they were struck at least one hundred times, fire being generally concentrated on the nearest vessel, and in every instance when the fire was at all rapid causing it to withdraw.
