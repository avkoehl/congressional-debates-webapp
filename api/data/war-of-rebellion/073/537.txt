state of perfection by the intelligence of Asst. Surg. W. W. Wythes, U. S. Volunteers. Asst. Surg. S. H. Hornor, U. S. Army, has performed the duties of purveyor of the department faithfully and correctly. Surg. H. L. W. Burritt, U. S. Volunteers, performed valuable and arduous services as special purveyor in the field during a portion of the campaign, and as acting medical inspector of the Twenty-third Army Corps. I am particularly indebted to Surg. A. M. Wilder, U. S. Volunteers, acting medical inspector of the department, for his industry, intelligence, zeal, and conscientious performance of duty. The successful conduct of the medical department during the campaign is due more to his labor than any other officer, and the reports and the results of cases are gathered by his industry and devotion to duty. He has also proved himself to be an able operator and a surgeon of excellent judgment, which is constantly improving with experience. I recommend him to the favorable notice of the Surgeon-General and Assistant Surgeon-General.

I beg leave to make honorable mention of Hospital Steward M. C. Wilcox and Private A. J. Goodhue, chief clerk in the office of the medical director, for faithful and intelligent discharge of duty and deep personal interest in the good of the service, and the correct transaction of the business of the office. The hospitals of the District of Kentucky have not been under my personal supervision, and it would not, therefore, be proper to make any mention of them in this report. The character of the principal one, Jefferson and Joe Holt, are fully established, and reflect honor, especially the former, upon the medical department of the West.

In conclusion, I beg leave to submit the following resume of the various reports and returns. It cannot be offered as absolutely correct, but it approaches so nearly the exact truth as to furnish a legitimate basis for conclusions and generalizations:
