Mr U said he well knew the influence which the opinions
of the peop'e had upon their Representatives Although it
had beenoncesaui that a "Ileptesentative should not bepaia
lyzed by the wfl f bis- constituents," stiit he thought they
should bp,and h„ himself was paralyzed by the will of his con
stituents He was willing to advócale measi res which wou d
benefit their m eresis—the improvement ol tne rivers and the
construction of the national road He was not surf used that
gentlemen from the seacoast, who came from the vortex of
the operation of these appropriations m behalf of the navy,
should be in their favor The Navy Committee, too, was com
posed of members from the seaboard altogether Was it, then,
surprising that these gentlemen advocated la ge appropiutions,
when the money wag showered aiountl then houses then plan
tatijons, and their navyyirdb, near their homes? Ho did not
know much about Gespoit Tie gentleman from Virginia,
however, came fiom that neighboihood He was net sur
prised to see him go for an increase of the appropriation 1 be
course of the gentleman fiom InJiana [Sir Pnorrrr] was
somewhat astonishing
Mr R reiterated his willingness to vote for the usual appio
priaüona toward the naval service, but denied that ny reason
existed for their increase He dd not even see a speck of
war, and as for England, he believed she woullyield the
risdH ot search The American people would nor suffer an
officer with British epaulettes to hoard their vessels They
would nevereubmittothe right of searci, and m this opinion
theyweie ummmous fiom one end of the co tment to the
other The English were aware of the unanimity of sentiment
among them, and would not resort to war lie (Mr R ) be
lieved that the rights for which the Amencars contended would
beestablishe 1 without-b'ood Fiom what quartet, then, was
war to eomi/í He saw none, but írt m the pirates , and ona or
two vessels would protect the cotmtiy m that partitulai It
was said the other day—and he thought with very aieat reason
and justice—that we should see row theievenue was to be raised
to meet these appropriations before we made them Thafaim
ers of the count-y he took to be men of great good sense , and
when one of them proposed to build a huuse, his fiist inquiry
was, Where were the means to pay for ifí Was not this com
mon sense with the farmers 1
And he thought that what was common sense in a farrier of
Indiana ought to be common sen*e m Congress It seemed to
him that the Northern members voted for all «ous of <*poro
priations, and he supposed it must be because thty thought
largo expemtuur s would create a necessity for a tai iff, toafiord
protection to manufacturer He could notsee why tie ippin

Nevertheless, Mr R 3aidhe\\as astonished that those wl o hel I

documents to show that &29o 000 a year was expended upen
men who were "waiting orders" Was it right to expend so
much money upon men who were ren lering no sei vice to then
country? The Navy Board too he thought should be abolish

man had the hardihood to oppose it opeoly Indeed, it was en-

The Star* of Virginia (continued Mr ¡VÍ ) had figured largely
m this debate It seemed, fioir the remarks of some gentle
men, that all the officers of the navy had been taken rom the
State of Vngujia He was aware that his good old mother atthid
time was not m veiyaood odor with some gentlemen upon that
floor But he would inquire how uhappened thatsomany
officers appeared to be from Virginia It was a fact that near
ly one thu d of the popul Uion oí many of i he Western ¡states had
some from Vngmia, and many of the officers th6ugh charged
to Virginia, resi led m other States Many of the midshipmen,
too, who had been appoir-'edat large, were chirged to hei If

he a^ked had contiolled the Navy Depaitment 'rom 1822 to

He would not however, dwell on thispaitof the subject In
relation to the schooners Active and Pioneer he would say tfnt
they were not built under the dnection of (he Navy Board, but
that Geneial Jackson appointed officers himself to superintend
then consti uction The Seer tarv was charged vuih hostibty to
the expedition for which they were fated out, and it was two or

I was no because the naval service dit not then require mote,
but because the estimates of th  ^eeietarj of the Navy weie
cut down by a cabinet council held for ti e purpose of making
all the appropriations so small that the charge of extravagance
would be avoided
He was informed that in 1841 the head of the Navy Depart
menrwis ord red by ti e Executive to mike out the "¡mallei

leglecfm^ Rhole Island He (Mr M ) a-k d the ¡^ecre'ary
abojt the few midshipmen who weie taken from the West
and that officer answered him that there hid always been but
few applicants from that section, and when there were any
they weie seldom recommended by persons known to the de-
partment, and therefore could not be <*pp infed
The gentteman from Pennsylvania fVfr C Brown] had ob-
i^Cted to the naval apprentice sys'em He wouldiemind that
gentleman that apprentices wue put there to make«eamen,
and not officers 'ihe education acquired for officers and that for
pearaen were e&sentially different, and the Secretary, in answer to
applications to promote apprentices to the post of midshipmen,
had declined positively, on the gi -mm. that it would break down
Ueseivice He (Mr M ) was inc'medto think the whole sys-
tem ahumbug Instead of employing the apprenuces, as they
should be onboard of their ships they were nequently carried
off 40 rnirch in procession, and make a show He believed mer
chant ships to be the proper places to tiain up apprentices for
our navy, and if Congress had adopted the bill pioposedby Mr
McKim of Baltfinoie, some years tmce, the seivice would now
be on a bettei footing
Some gentlemen (continued Mr M )seemed to think that the
officers of the navy should be always in service Was it right,
he asked, when an officer had íeturncd from a three years'
cruise, to send him off to =ea again immedjately'i Who would
ente - the seivice on such terms? Tha true policy was to have
several complement*, to lake the rUce of each other, by keep-
ing ofhi ers on shore on reduced pa>
Mr M said he believed that as great a humbug was prac-
tised m Pennsy'vania as in any othei place The people there
undertook to build a magnificent navdi asylum for seamen In
ste-id of putting itatNeft lork,or some other pkee upon th«
seaboard, where, the sick sai! i might have his desponding
spin cheered up by the sight of vessels constantly passing hy,
tl ey put their magnificent pal ice at PhiladeJr hia upon a mud-
ijv stream wheie the whtl" atmjtphere was sickly Tie build-
mg too, cost two oi three bundled thousand dollars, and still
would not keep wamen fiom deserting (he service This was
a humbug with a vengeance, and more so, because it was built
v nh ¡he money of the seamen— the money which he had won, or
which had been t^keri f om hiohard eainirg
All C BROWN said that mora tor nage passed the naval
asylum at Philadelphia in a da\, than we t into Norfolk in a

beautiful gieen fields, ai d no fevei and ague
Mi MaLLORY remarked tha the gentlemanhimselflooked

Mr BROWN said he had one on Saturday night,but not
now
Kr MaLLORY continued The town from which he came
did not boast of its shipping The policy of the FedeialCJov-
err ment, the operation oí a National Bank, and the tariff, had
b asted its prospects ar d uken from it th* rank to which it was
entitled He would, hov ever, bay to the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania, that moie vessels congregated undet bouthwst point,
laden with watermek ns, swcci. potatoes, and naval stores, than
f«ay=ed up the Delaware in ayear Ihe gentleman was jealous
of theThila^eiphianav) ;aid It was true that ships were built
thee of a superior cast, and at cheap rates, yet they had to be
sent around to Norfolk to b  equipped fot sea The channel of
theüe Lware wasnotueep enough The ship North Carolina,
of wl ose construction the Philai tiphians boasted so much, baa
to be f,ent tu Norfo k befoie <-he could be got ready for sea.

and (he South, made it the fi le^t 1 «trboi in the country Had
Noifo been snua'ed uoon tne muddy Schuylkill, it would not
have had a naval asylum
Mr M did not complain of the expenditures made m Phila-
delphia, and be shou d advocate an appropriation to the dry-
doc^ at New Yoi k If iheie was any pla^e in the South where
a dry dock could be nade he would cheerfully advecate it*
construction, but he doubted the practicability of such a thing.
Hedil not eonsidei it economy to increase our navy yards.
They would be attended with additional expense for superin-
tendents master mechanics, workmen, and repairs He beg-
ge 1 gentlemen to examine the report of the Secretary of th 
Naw, and was convinced that they would find every item ia
this bill to be called for even by stricteconomv, by which thous-
ands would be saved hereafter In behalf of the present Navy
Board, he would say they were recently appointed and were not
responsible for past abuses They were high minded, honor
able men, and would endeavor todo their duty, and he would
have gentlemen to recollect that they were not all Virginians,
though the president was one He hoped the amiable, mild,
and honest genMeman from Pennsylvania would be cooler in
his next remarks on this subject
Mr CUSHING remembered tint, at the last session of Con-
