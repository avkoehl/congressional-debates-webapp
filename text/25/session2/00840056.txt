CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
remarked on the floor of the Senate, that the time
had gone by when legislations, by means of resolu-
tion1!, would be sufficient to meet the wishes of the
country on a subject so vitally important He
was still of the same opinion The settlement of
mere abstractions of principles will never answer
the desired end Thes>e remarks he had made sim-
ply to remind the Senate that it had been his inten-
tion, and was so still, to bring the matter forward
in some more forcible and efleetiv format a fu-
ture day
Mr CALHOUN remarked that this was a brief
and duect mode of reaching the subject He did
not feel disposed to await any action on the Ver-
mont resolutions He was prepared to act now,
and as the resolutions just offered contained the
whole gist of the matter at issue, he saw no neces-
sity for further delay He hoped there would be
no opposition to the motion to print, as then each
member would be enabled the more readily to de-
termine in his mind what course was proper to
pursue, let the subject come in whatever shape it
might
The motion to print was then agreed to
And the Senate then adjourned

Washington, Dec 26, 1837
[The resolution referred to was m relation to
any settlements on the Columbia river ]
The Message having been read, was, on motion
of Mr. CRAIG, laid on the table
The SPEAKER also laid before the House a
communication from the Secretary of War, trans-
mitting the examinations made by the Department
of War on the claims of the State of Massachu-
setts, for military services and expenditures dunng
the late war with Great Britain, which, on motion
of Mr. GRENNELL, was laid on the table
MISSISSIPPI ELECTION
The SPEAKER said he had had placed m his
hands a communication from Messrs S fe Prentiss
and T J Wood, claiming seats as Representatives
from the State of Mississippi on the floor of the
House
Mr. WILLIAMS of North Carolina called <br
the reading of the papers
They consisted of a letter from the two gentle-
men, and the ceitificate of Governor Lvnch of their
return, etc , and having been read,
Mr CAMBRELENG moved their refere- ce to
the Committee of Elections, and that they be
printed.
Mr BELL understood the application of the two
gentlemen was, to be admitted to their qu hfication
and sworn, and he supposed the Chur, or ratiei
the House, would have to decide upon th s applica-
tion The gentleman ficm New York nad snted
no grounds upon which he moved the íeference
and Mr B. had considerable difficulties about what
eourse shou'd be adopted In the case of Arkan-
sas, he believed the gentleman from that State had
been admitted and was sworn by the Speal ei, on
motion of a gentleman He besrged lene o in-
quire of that honorable member whether he had
resigned his seat¡
Mr. YELL replied tbat he had not
Mr BFLL resumed, that if he had not been
misinformed, in relation to the questions contested
at the last session uV ease of the gentleman from
Arkansas was pr ciselt the simp is that of th->
gentieman from Mississippi Upon whit principle
the gentleman from Aikmsaswas qualified i se-
cond time, he could not sa\ If he were a)r<ndj
a member, the < tin couid rot he admiristered to
him a second tnr-  Ue ma'e lhe=  leroirks, in
ordei that the House th ht i>ctoc->s tenti , thouch
he admitted the case was one of some difficult},
It would, perhaps, be better to refer it to the House,
who might take an cder on it, for it was without
precedent If the gentleman from New York had
made his motion to refer the subject to the Commit-
tee of Elections, on the ground that there were other
gentlemen claiming the same ieats, that would
offer a reason, but ready the case of Arkansas
seemed to have been regaided by the Chair, and by
the House, too, in making no objection, as if there
had been a vacaocy The journals would show,
m the abs nce, certainly, of a word to the contrary,
that it w as taken for granted by the House that
there was a vacancj m that case, and the gentle-
man fiom Arkansas had presented the evidence of
his new election, had qualified, and had been ad-
mitted by the Chair to qualify as a member elect
Mr B had stated these circumstances that the
House might come to some decision that might
maintain their conformity and consistency
Mr C 4.MBRELENG had not thought it neees
sary to state his reasons for the motion of refer-
ence, because he felt satisfied the members on all
sides would see the necessity of adopting the usual
cou se It was a question always heretofore re-
fen ed to the Committee of Elections
Mr YELL said it was perhaps due to all the
gentlemen that he should say something in reply
to the gentleman from Tennessee, in drawing a
parallel between the case of Arkansis and Mis-
sissippi It was true that Mr Y was sworn in
at the present session, hut he nevertheless con-
sideied his case different from that of Mississippi
although he had been elected by the people at the
called session, it was on the distinct understanding,
in Arkansas, that it was for the called session
onh His ftiends, it was hue, thought otherwise,
and that lie was entitled to his seat for the
whole Congress, but that no excuse should be made,
that no censure should be cast upon him, no ques-
tion should be rai«ed in reference to his election,
he determined to waive all the right, and told the
people if be should not be elected again hewould
resign tus seat ]No.v, hiung submitted his claim
to the people a second time, he should have been
derelict in his duty and professions to them if he
had c'aimed his seat under the first election,
and not have qualified over ag ir He
hid therefore, thought it due to th<" people
of Aricarse and to himself, even if he had be n
legally and coi stituticnally elecred the first time, to
claim h seat under ine ensuing election More-
over, h tliougnt t no Innn to be sworn over again,
rí i he beli \ cd if the Hint w as sw orn once a

ha\e c n'f-nded tl ii he was not elected for two

Mr ILLf had not risen to amie the ques ion,

himself had no ob ectiou to thei having places on
the floor, but he should object to their being sw"rn
until a co nmi "e ol th" House had reported or
some action had been had on the question His

Mr GRAVES had refererce only to what bad

Mr BAl?<Fs si d,reithu did he Inmseif, nor,
he supposed, did anv other member oí the House,
object to giv ng these gentlemen seats on the floor,
for the purpose of hearing what waS said, and of
participating in the debates that might grow out of
the question which their alleged return as mem-
bers of that House might bring up It had always
been usual to extend that courtesy to persons claim-
ing seats there. But, he believed, that if the jour-
nals of the House, touching any and every con-
tested election, from the establishment of the present
Government down to the present time, should be
examined, it would be found that m no instance
had such courtesy been extended to cla'mints for
seats until after the reference to, and a report from,
the Committee on Elections He therefore consi-
dered the gentleman's (Mr Giaves) resolution as
entirely premature It would be reversing what
Mr H believed to have been the uniform practice
of the House m all similar cises Surely, they
must all recoiled the cours  pursued by the House,
two years ago, on the contested election from
North Carolina. The claimant, m that instance,
did not come withm the hal', or participate in the
discussions of the House, until after the report of
the Committee of Elections was brought in. Why,
what an interminable discussion might grow outot
the adoption of the gentleman's motion They
woaldhave nothing to act upon, nor could have,
until the subject had been first referred to the
proper organized committee of the House, and
that committee had brought in its report upon it
4 single word or two to the gentleman from
Tennessee, (Mr Bell ) Mr H could not, for the
life of him, help being struck with the analogy the
gentleman maintained to exist between the present
case and that of the member fiom Arkansas. It
forcibly reminded Mr H of the analogy between
the course proposed by the gentleman, and that of
the case of individuals, who had been already tried
and acqaitted, being called up again to receive
judgment, because others had suffered judgment to
go by default
Mr POPE was in favor of the proposition of
the gentleman from New York, as a geneia! prin-
ciple, but not in the present instance, on the con-
trary, he was utterly opposed to the commitment
of this subj"ct to th  Committee of Elections, be-
cause they bad, at the late session, g ver, at bast
a majority of the members compo-- no. tie com-
mittee, a decision m favor of the s itmg members
They had already prejudged the case Moreover,
this was not an ordinary case of a contested elec-
t on, for there was no contest at all It was a case
sin genens, pel haps, without precedent, and couid
be decided without commitment He wou'd fheie-
fore make a proposition which should at once bring
the whole question before House It \\ as in sub-
stance as follow s
Resolved, That Mi Prentiss and Mi Word be
qualified to take their seals as members of this
House for the present Congress, and that tl e reso-
lution of the last session, m fa\ or of Mr Clai-
borne and Mr Gholson, be rescinded
He asked, why commit this subject to a standing
committee 1 Surely the constitutional and legal
question could ve met t once, and the H"U e wis
fully competent to decide it Ii, however, it was
considered necessary to lefer it ' > a comiquee at
