man whose name I am not sure I hane correctly but who goes around Brooklyn with a copy of the paper in his hand extolling the articles in it and confidentially informing those he supposes sympathize with him that such and such an article in it is from his pen. He is a physician in Brooklyn. The arrest of three such men would satisfy to some extent the wishes of the loyal German population and may lead to an immediate suspension of publication.

Very truly, yours,

OFFICE OF THE SUPT. OF THE METROPOLITAN POLICE,

New York, October 6, 1861.

F. W. SEWARD, Esq.,

DEAR SIR: I send by mail to-day the eleventh numbeer of the National Zeitung. It does nott flag in its course. I also sen you an old number (July 20) of the London Standdard* containing a letter of Manhattan dated July 6, and which has a dialogue in it that may amuse you if you have any time just now for a quiet smile. Independent of the converse between you and dthe captain the article is not calculated to do harm. On the contrary, in reference to the slavery question it is veery well calculated to inform the world in advance what this war is coming to. His reference to Fremont is prophetic, especially so when you look at the date of his letter. I don't think Fremont had then arrived from Europe. I know he did not go West auntil after the Bull Run affair for I saw him in Philadelphia on July 22, and there is no personal acquaintanceship between him and Manhattan.

Want of health has kept me from my office for a dya or two, so that I could not until to-day send for Mr. Scoville to let him have the benefit of the explanation in the letter of your father relative to his letter. He tells me he sent the letter on Spanish affairs to you While conversing with him to-day he showed me a letter from the committee of publication of the Herald and Standard which I regard of some imortance. It announced to him that the committee had determined to allow him pounds 2 for each of the letters they had received, and would allow him pounds 3 each for all in future. It also requests him to furnish them with leaders on Amirican affairs, for which they are ready to pay leberally. Is it not worth while for him to have help in preparing leaders? At any rate would it not be well to take some trouble and assume some expense in order to have control of such articles in two London papers? Mr. Weed is not in town to-day or I would lay the subject before him. Therefore I write you that something may be done early.

In case the National Zeitung contains anything wirthy of making it an object worthy of being struck at the two principal parties are O. Bengue and William Arming. The letter is the Brooklyn man alluded to in my last to your father relative to this paper.

Very truly, yours,

JOHN A. KENNEDY,

Superintendent.
