act efficiently. His regiment was raised in four counties-Saint Clair, Clinton, Benton, and Hickory- and in the present condition of the country I fear that prompt communication will be impracticable. The Seventy-first Regiment, from his county and Saline, may be regarded as almost extinct, there not remaining probably in the regiment subject to duty 100 men in all. There are two small companies of citizen guards here and one in Saline. In conclusion, I may state that this post is in an exposed condition. The guerrillas were in town to-day, having taken three horses, with which they made their escape.

I am, general, most respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. C. VAUGHAN,

Captain J. H. STEGER,

I will send part of Company C out toward Osceola as a line of communication. I have seventy men here without rations. Will you send them up? Order was left here by Lieutenant Holloway for me to come to Sedalia on court-martial. Shall I do so? I must have a change of clothing; trunk is at Sedalia.

Nine guerrillas came within four miles of town an hour ago. Took Hickman and Paitner McCullough, two negroes, and two mules and two horses. Lieutenant Houts is in pursuit. I learned this evening that 100 passed two miles west of Holden going south yesterday evening.
