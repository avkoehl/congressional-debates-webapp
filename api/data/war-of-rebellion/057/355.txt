bravery he had no superior of his age. Lieutenant-Colonel Barksdale was also a brave and gallant man, and his loss fell heavily on the regiment he commanded, as it was left now without a field officer.

I desire to testify my appreciation of the skill and ability of Colonels McCulloch, Russell, and Duckworth, commanding brigades. Colonel McCulloch, although wounded on the evening of the 22nd, continued in command. Colonel Russell assumed command of Bell's brigade after the injury to Colonel Barteau, and Colonel Duckworth took command of Forrest's brigade after Colonel Forrest fell on the morning of the 22nd ultimo.

I have formally congratulated and returned my thanks to the officers and troops of my command for their gallant and meritorious conduct; for their energy, endurance, and courage, and it would afford me pleasure to mention individual instances of daring and dash which came under my own observation but for fear of doing apparent injustice to others who in other parts of the field perhaps did as well.

My escort deserves especial mention; Commanded by Lieutenant Thomas S. Tate on the 21st, and by its commander, Captain Jackson, on the 22nd, its battle-flag was foremost in the fray, sustaining its reputation as one of the best fighting cavalry companies in the service. I also desire to acknowledge, as I have often done before, my indebtedness to Major J. P. Strange, my assistant adjutant-general; Captain Charles W. Anderson, my aide-de-camp, and Lieutenant Tate, assistant inspector-general, for prompt and faithful services rendered in the delivery and execution of all my orders on the field.

All of which is respectfully submitted.

N. B. FORREST,

Major-General.
