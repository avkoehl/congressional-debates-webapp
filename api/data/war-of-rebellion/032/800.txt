Colonel ADAMS:

SIR: Your note is received. The demand relative to the negroes must be complied with. The matter of disagreement relating to your orders from General Blunt and General Curtis is a matter which can be more readily settled elsewhere than here.

I am, sir, your obedient servant,

RICH'D C. VAUGHAN,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

P. S.- As it is already late, I must require that you permit no portion of the property and negroes above alluded to to leave your lines.

HDQRS. TWELFTH REGIMENT KANSAS VOLUNTEERS,November 27, 1862.

Brigadier-General VAUGHAN:

SIR: My guards are out, and I shall follow your orders relative to keeping whatever is within my lines here. I am subject to arrest from you, and choose a trial by court-martial rather than turn the negroes out of my camp. I do not do this, believe me, General Vaughan, out of disrespect to you, but because I believe it to be contrary to a general order from the War Department to do so.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

CHAS. W. ADAMS,

Commanding Twelfth Regiment Kansas Volunteers.

DEAR GENERAL: If you will receive an informal visit from me, I will be glad to see you.

Yours, truly,

CHAS. W. ADAMS,

Twelfth Regiment Kansas Volunteers.
