from Massachusetts may be able, and, if so, I beg aim to correct
me    But 1 do not peiceive him in his seat
I stand not here to eulogize Maryland The oratory of the
revolution sufficiently tells her praise, the tribute of dpproba
tion has been amply accorded to her, by poet, by orator, and by
historian, but by none has her conduct been more eloquently
spoken of than by the distinguished member from Massachu
setts, (Mr \dams,) when, m his splendid eulogy upon the life
and character oí Lafayette, he thrillmgly alluded to the zeal
and patriotism of the ladies and merchants of Baltimore, in this
the darkest hours of the struggle for independence What I
have said has been merely to show that, whilst the enemy over-
ran and deso ated other btates, Maryland not only defended her
own teiritory, but liberally gave her treasure and sent her troops
to protect the remotest portions of hersister States
She refused to "ign the artiUes of confederation, unless they
should contain «some provision for settling the question as to the
Western domain She resisted the claims of particular States,
asan extravagant pretence of right, inconsistent with reason
and repugnant to j istice , ^he contended that what was rescued
from the common enemy, by the common efiort, ought, of i lght,
to be a common property, to enure forever for the common
benefit of all the States The position which Maiyland thus
took was approv ed by several of the Stares, and most of them
contended, ou similar grounds, for a participation in the public
lands
On the 1st of February, 1779, ^Delaware signed the articles
but her act of accession was accompanied with the following
resolutions
M Resolved, That this State think it necessary, for the peace
and safety of the State, to be in eluded in the Union , that a mo
derate extent of limits should be assigned for such of those ¡states
as claim to the Mississippi or South sea, and that the United
Sutes ¡n Congress assembled should and ought to have power
of filing their western limits
*' Rp>ofved, ateo, Fhat this State consider themselves justly
entitled te a right, in common with the members of the Union,
to that extensive tract of country which lies to the westward of
the frontier of the United States, the property of which was not
vested m, or granted to, individuals at the commencement of
the piesent war, that the same hath been or may be gamed
from the King of Great Britain, or the native Indians, by the
blood and treasure of ail, and ought, therefor?, to be a com
mon estate, to be granted out on terms beneficial to the United
States "
New York led the way to effect the compromise In February,
J 780, the Legislature of that State passed an act " to facilitate
the completion of the articles of confederation and peipetual
union among the United States ot America ' This act declared
that the territory which she ceded ' should be and enure for the
use and benefit of such of the I mted States as should become
members of the F deral al liance oí the said States, and for no
othtr uve or purpose whatsoeiei
Maryland, having succeeded so far as to arou e other States
to a sense ol the importance of the question m relation to the
Western domain, to prevent the injurious imp ess'on that irre
concilable dissension existed among the States,signed the articles
of confederation on the 1st of March, 1781, protesting, however,
at the same time, against any n ference being drawn that she had,
by so doing, relinquished her claim to a participation in the
Western lands, but assigned, as her reasons, that
" "Whereas it lias been said that the common enemy is encour
aged, by this State not acceding to the confederation, to hope
that the Union of the stater States may be dissolved and there
fore prosecute the war in expectation of an event so disgraceful
to America, and our friends and illustrious ally are impressed
w.th an idea that the common cause would be promoted by our
formally acceding to the confcdeiation, this General assembly,
conscious that this folate hath from the commencement of the
war strenuously exerted herself m the common cause, and fully
satisfied that, if no formal confederation was to take place, it is
the fixed determination of thia State to continue her exeuions
lo the uttermost agreeably to the faith pledged m the Union
from an earnest desire to conciliate the affection of the sister
States, to convince the woild of our unalterable resolution to
support the independence of the United States, and the alliance
wit'i his Motot Christian Majesty, and to destroy forevei any ap
prehension*, of our Inends, or hopes of our enemies, of the ¡state
being asrain joined to Great Britain '
Great Britain, by the treaty of peace m 1783, i elmquished u to
tie United States alt claim to the Government, property, and
te ritorial rights of the &ame, and e\ ery patt thereof"
To the relinquishment of what property and temtorial
12ghttf" did this tieaty alinde, if it was not to the Crown lands
(for all the vacant unsol 1 land was claimed as such) that were
known to be situated within ihe Urn u> of the chattels of Mas
sachueetts, Connecticut, New York, Virginia, North Carolina,
South Oaiolma, and Georgia, the charters of all of which
ex ended westwaidly to the South sea or Pacific ocean"* New
i ork had an indefinite claim to a part oi the Northwestern
Territory
Then, under the treaty of peace with Great Britain, which
met the entire concurrence of the thirteen States, Virginia in
eluded, the United States, became entitled to the Western
domain
This right m some degree became qualified by the acquies
mice of the General Government in the subsequent acts of ccs
<non of those States within whose limits tho unappropriated lands
were situated
Georgia, in lc02, lehnquished to the United States hei West
ern lauds, comprising now he entire States of Mississippi and
Alabama excepting the southern portions of the same, which,
with East t lorula, were purchased of Spam by the United ¡states
in 1319, lor five millions of dollars The articles of agreement
anl cession between the United State-, and Georgia explicitly
declare " that all the lands ceded by this agreement to the Unit
ed States shaU, after atisfymg the above mentioned payment of
one million two hundied and fifty thousand ootlars to the State
of Georgia, ind the grants recognised by the preceding condi
tions, be considered as a comrronfmd for the use and benefit
oftke United States, Georgia included and shall befaithfully
disposed of for thai pwpose, and for no other use or purpose
whatever "
The cesión on the part of Virginia, which may be consideied
aa the most important, from the magnitude of the territory com
prehended within the grant, after specifying certain conditions,
requiring, among other things, the United States to reimburse
tkf expenses which Virginia had incurred m defending the ter
ritory, explicitly states that the lands ceded " shall be considei
ed as a common fund, for the use and benefit of such of the
Uftí^d, States as have become, or shall become, members of the
confederation or Federal alliance of the said States, Viigima in
elusive, according to thou usual rebpecuve pioportumsw the
genet al charge and expenditure, and shall be faithfully and
bona Jide disposed of for that pui pose, and foi no other use or
purpose whatsoever '
By the treaty of 1803 Franco ceded Louisiana to the United
States, for which the United States agreed to pay that nation
fifteen millions of dollars Then, viewing the public lands as
having been acquired by conquest, by pui chase, or by cession,
theie is no avoiding tht, conclusion that they are the common
property of the United States, zn which each Sta e has an in
tei est in proportion to its significance int/ie Union
The cleat, and specific language of the acts of cession dissi
pates every vapoi and shadow ol doubt on the subject, could
aay have existed, and (learly shows that tongres  has no other
powei, if it is true to its irus', as an agent created by the Sta'es,
with aspetiiied and restricted powei, than to disposeof those
lands to create w a common fund," foi the benefit of each of the
States of the Union, " according to their usual respective pro
portions li the geneial charge a7id expenditure " and that
the public lands can only "be faithfully and bona fide disposed
of for that purpose, and for no other use or purpose wha'so
ever '
It must be apparent to all, that as a common property, de
signed m the articles of cession to be granted lor the benefit of
all of the States, and not for tne partial benefit of a part o f the
States, any mode of distribution or appropriation which is par
tial in its tendency o Derates an injustice to the lest, in dutct
violation both of the language and intention of the acts ot
cession So far as they have been or may be appropriated foi
objects of national defence, so far as they have been sold, and
the proceeds paid into the Treasury, the Government has acted
faithfully, but so far as they have been applied to State and
not national purposes so far as they have been granted to par
ticular States for specific purpo-es, when they misht have been
granted for the like purposes to a 1 the State- , the Gov ernment
has acted m direct violation of the ver> language and spirit of
the compacts
The Government ha  acted, m it- unmeasured liberality to
wards the Western folates, with great injustice to the old states
—an injustice which is doubly severe upon those old States
whose limits are comparatively small, and whose means of
revenue are not \ny great, m giving immense bounties of the
public domain for -specific, and local, and State purposes
The Government has given to the Western States one thirty
sixth part of the public lands, for the purposes of education in
those States and 1 emtones in which the lands are situated   And
thus has been caiveJ out of the general pioperty of the whole
nation, which Congress solemnly pledged itself to appropriate
only for the benefit of all, this vast amount f r the local and ex
elusive benefit of a pt.il    Have not the old States an equal—I
might say, truly a superior—claim to a iikp pioportionatp ap
propnation of the public pioperty for ti e same purpo-e"*   Is
not educa ion equallv as impoitatit in one region ot the nation
as it is m anothei'    And i*> it not as expen*iv> m the old as it
is in the new States 1 Can this Government I will ask, consider
lt&elfas acting m honest and mst faith as long as it omi s to make   ,
similai appiopiiations of the puolic lands to the old States fai
purposes of education1   The appropriations have been made
lor State, not national purposes, they were of a character that  '
might have been made to all the Spates    Is it m good faith to
restrict them to a part only f
The number of acres which the Government has gn en to the
new States east of the Mississippi amounts to 7,909,903 If the
same policy be pursued with the territory west of the Missis
sippi, (as it oii=ht to be, piowded it bf extended to the old
States also,) the number ol acies which will be appropriated in
that region wilt be 6 666 6t>6, m king an aggregate of 14,576,
569 acres, which at wo doláis per acre will make the enoi
mows amount oí $29 15% 3SX given exclusively to a particular
section of the counti), from trie common property of the nation
This calculatonis placing the land at the low puce of two
dollars per acre, ("much of it has sold for ten dollars, and, in
trinsicaly, on an average, it is worth, I believe, more than five,)
and Seybert ha¡> shown that before ihe reduction of the Gov
ernment puce, it aveiaged more than tuvo dollars per acie
which will make when the Western country shall have been
settled, land worth, perhaps, seventy or eighty millions oi dol
larsofthe general property of the nation, which Congress will
have given for local State beneffs
In addition to this vast amount of land which has been given
to the Wes ern States for puryoses ol education, they hive
received two and a half p*i cent on the sale of thepuhlic lands.,
and large grants for purposes of internal improvements The
amount of money w hich the General Government has expended
in the purchase and mansement of the public lands including
interest iheicon, h= upw uds of $49000000 In 1831 it was
$48 077,551, including interest Ihib amount has been chiefly
paid Dy the oU ¡state , and much of their wealth ha* been diawn
from them, while the amount of money which had been piid
into the Tiea-my from the sales oi the public lands, up to 1831,
is but $37,272,71"* > theteioie the INational Treasury had not, at
that time, been reimbursed, by including interest by $10,8i l,t>33
Anl yet this Congies la giavelv asked-oy whom1 not tie
People, but by a tew honorable members—to reduce the price
of the Westei n lands'
Ñor «hpuld Congie s refuse to giant to the old States their
fair distributive share of the public lands for the purpose of
education   and, if they aie tiue'o themselves, they will insist
upon the giant    Mai y land contains 8,%0,00Ü acres   at tne ratio

allude to this subjttt mm, partirn aih m another p   tofrty
remarks  In 1831 the Legi lam re u( M   yland , i^u1 toe follow
mg resolutions
1 Resolved bxj ih  íxeneial Assemb y of Maryland, Th«
each of ihe United fcf-rt s haq an equal right to participate m
the benefit of the public lands, the common property of the
Union
* This Is predicated upon the calculation that I omsana con
tains, according to Mr Scybert's estimate, 200,000000 acres
but it contains 7o0.000,000 bvSenmr Ceju s estimate, which
would more than doub'e the amount
" Resolved, That the States id whose favor. Congress feave
not made appropriations of land for the purposes ol education,
are entitled to such appropriations as wilt eorreepondj in a just
proportion, with those heretofore made in favor of the otfaer
States "
Another leeolution was passed, rawtirjg the attention of the
Legislatures pf the several States to the subject, and also their
Representatives m Congress
These resolutions were accompanied by a leport from Mr
Maxcy to vhe Senate of Mars land* wi 'ch* for clear, irresistible
reasoning, and enlightened policy, is second to do report tftat
has ever been made on the subject If the ieportof Mr. Clay
( I mean the American statesman) on the subject of the Western
lands should be decided more able, it would be for the reason
that Plato gave-why one of Demosthenes's oiatiens -was better
than the rest, " because it waa the longest ' Most of the Stats*
gave favorable responses to the resolutions of Maryland, and
the subject was brought before Congress Congress delayed
action, upon the eiound thattu gra it lands to the old States
might, for the time, xe'ard the payment of the national debt,
and derange, in some degree, the sinking fund system , but I
will, before 1 conclude, allude more particularly to the proposi
lions aid reporte made m relation to the public lands as a jund
for education That debt has been paid off, the nation is free
from debt, so that aigumerit cannot now be used And Con-
gress should now pay a debt of gratitude—no, sir, not a debt of
gratitude, but a debt of justice—to the old States lüstice is all
that they ask, and it is what they have a right to require
I have dwelt much longer upon this branch oi the subject
than I had intended , and, before I proceed to that part ol the
report of the committee wmch re'atestothe i eduction of the
price of the public lands, I will make a remark or two upon a
portion of the leport which alludes to the relative power of the
Covernment and the new States, m he exeruse of the right of
eminent domain
The report states " that the committee do not propose a dis
cussion oi the question whether, m the iansjrage of some of ihe
acts of cession tefened to, the n^w fetateu have beenadrmtted
into the Umoi with the ¡same rights of soiereignty, freedom,
and independence, as the other States nor whether there is
strict propriety in the declaration, to be found in all the acts
and resolutions of Congiess for the admission of new States, that
they are ' admitted into the Union on an equal footing with the
original States, in allrespects tchatevc/ } lus not now, (the
committee state ) and we hope it never may be, necessary to
inquire how far ihe want of eminent domain, the power to
dispose of or tax soil within her limits, is compatible with the
^sooereigntifofaStatc nor to show that the original States,
from the time of their independence, ai d at the date of the
oeveral compacts, had that right '
Thf n, to come back to the immeuiate consideration of the
repoit The committee hold that the light of eminent domain,
the right to dispose of and to tax soil, aie essential attributes of
Sta p sozereignty Tneae attnbu et, miy externa sovereign
btate biuta make these powers attach to and be possessed by,
the new state , presupposes the fact, that, when a State is admit
ted into theUmon with equal political and municipal powers,
it becomes bv tl at admission, a so\c cign State It nucht be
sayins: too much, Mr Speaker, though Í think not, to assert
that there is njt absolute sovereignty in either the General Go\
ernment or m a State Goverrmeat
This fea ure and To-ument oi the report is peculiar It half
asseits, half yields the right of a State to tax. and dispose of
the national property within is limit-*, and dwells upon the
word "sovet eignty" with much-sfesa, The ground is not
boldly taken m the report, that the powei ot the western
States over the unappropriated lands i^ paramount to the
authority of the Goner tl Government, butan hi ference is clear
in everj mind that an attempt is made to inculcate auch a AoC'
trine I know that the bo'd position was asserted, a few years
aso, by the Cn.ef Magistrate of Illinois,, (Governor Edwards >
The same views are ai o urged m one or two oiher reports
which have been mad to this Hou&c , ard Í have before me
resolutions and an address from a public meeting held in Indiana,
unequivocally asserung it
Before distinguished members on this floor commit themselves
in favor of such doctimes, I would warn them* to look at tie
pa&t Before tl ey use their powerful names m urging their
States to takesj"h rash ground*, I would admonish tnem to
reflect upon the rebutís of all the controversies which ha\e ex*
lsted uetw een Sta e decisions, both legislative and judicial, and

tempt to explain the philosophy of the error (if the terms are
Rdmishible) wmch controls the course of so many gentlemen,
n both State and national councils, m their interpretation of the
Constitution, the powers of the General Government and the
States, I would trace it to ib ir &upemc ai examination of ihe
subject to then acbptmg tht opinions of prominent men as
then guides, without examining the date of their opinions, and
the attendant circumstances which may have elicited ihcm
^uch opinions aie often found to be contradictory m themselres,
yet easily reconaleable with the 'imesand inudents which may
