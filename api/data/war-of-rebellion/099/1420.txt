HEADQUARTERS ALLEN'S CAVALRY DIVISION,In the Field, March 17, 1865 - 6 p. m.

Lieutenant Colonel T. B. ROY, Assistant Adjutant-General:

COLONEL: I have the honor to inform you that until about 4 p. m. I occupied the line which I took up this morning about five miles from the bridge near which I crossed last night. The enemy has skirmished with my pickets pretty constantly since 11 a. m. This afternoon a dismounted force charged, but failed to drive the reserve picket from its position. Having hear that the infantry has probably crossed Mingo Creek, I shall go into camp on the east side of it. I shall have a sufficiency of forage for the night.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WM. W. ALLEN,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

Lieutenant HUDSON,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General, Wheeler's Corps:

LIEUTENANT: I have the honor to inform you that your communicaiton dated 7. 10 a. m., stating that General Wheeler would move back toward Elevation, and directing me to communicate with you, was not received until about two hours ago. Until that time I had occupied a line about five miles from the bridge on which Colonel Ashby crossed Black River last evening. The enemy ahs skirmished with the regiment I had on picket, since about 11 a. m., but has failed to drive it from its position. About an hour since they charged it with a dismounted line. I am disposed to think it was nothing but cavalry. I have crossed Mingo Creek and shall encamp to-night on the eastern side of it. The position is a very strong one against small-arms. Crossing it, however, leaves open a road running on the west side of it to the road you are pn, and intersecting it, I imagine, in your rear. At present my regiment on picket is more than two miles in advance of this road; and should you inform me to-night that you position is in advance of the point at which it intersects the road you are on, I will direct the officer commanding the picket to notify you, should he have to uncover it. I am informed that General Hardee has reached the point at which this road intersects the Wilmington and Raleigh road, about five miles in rear of this position. My headquarters for the night will be in the woods near my camp.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WM. W. ALLEN,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
