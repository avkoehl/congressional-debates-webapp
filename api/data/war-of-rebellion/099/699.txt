The general desires me to say the order is satisfactory to him, and, in modification, has only instructed General Logan to remain in his present camp until such time as the Twentieth Corps, now passing, can get by him onto the left-hand road via Mark's Creek.

I am, general, yours, with respect,

Major-General HOWARD,

Commanding Army of the Tennessee:

GENERAL: Captain Duncan, commanding a small party of scouts dressed in rebel uniform, has just returned, having proceeded this morning to Laurel Hill, where he found a small squad of militia on picket. He left them undisturbed, returning by Springfield. The road he went out on (known as the Telegraph road) connects with the Easterling's Mill and Fayetteville road at Laurel Hill. At Springfield Captain Duncan saw a Doctor McCrea, with the rank of major in the rebel army, who, taking his party for rebels, inquired where Sherman's army was, and if there was any probability of its coming that way. On being told that it might possibly come there, he replied, "IF it does we will be badly fooled, as our are all going to Charlotte, expecting Sherman to go up there. " The Easterling's Mill road is generally called the old Stage road.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JAMES WILSON,

Colonel, Provost-Marshal-General, Army of the Tennessee.
