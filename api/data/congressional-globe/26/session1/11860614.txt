AMPENDÍJC TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
June, 1840.
26th Cono..—..1st Sets.
Independent Treasury—Mr. Cooper.
H. of Reps.
Sir, I beg pardon for the question; it is for the
people of Georgia to answer, not for you. Tha i
peop'e will furnish the answer when they reflect
and know that the issue is now what it then was,
what it has continued to be, Bank or no Bank.
That then the party, without controversy, was anti-
Bank; hat that cow, in action, a bold, talented
and intolerant influence for the Bank shows its
ftuai, which then was forced to lie behind a screen.
That is the eolation. And no ■**> of common
candor and ordinary perception, who has spent one
season ia New York, Philadelphia, and Boston,
with privilege of a seat here, and an insight into
th  principles and action of the State Rights party
ia Oeoigia, can for one moment deny the assertion
tba> the great issue now is, what Governor Troup
declares it to be, "Bank ot no Bank."
Mr. Chairman, having, as I think, demonstrated
the tenth of my nr t proposition, in regard to prac-
tical banking in ihis country, pointing at some of
itaaoiaaland comparative evils when contrasted
with the measure on your table, I now proceed to
a teeund.   h is this:
When the money deposites are abstracted, there-
by removiLg the basis of issue, resort is had to pub-
lie «<>c s, or corporation stock!:, or produce going
to market, to furnish a basis.
Thi«t too, may be proved by the Bank reports
or statements already referred to, and that of the
TJm:ed States Bank ol Pennsylvania, which I now
exhibir. I consider it as little more than the se-
quel of the late united States Bank. It is found
in Senate document No. 128, second session Twen-
ty-fifth Congress, page 214.                         g

la the estimates I make, I use, in some instances,
round numbers, as the object is merely to arrive at
a principie of action.
I said sir, that, after the deposites were removed,
the Bank resorted to stocks or produce, as a basis.
Ton will observe by the column of "loans and
discounts" in the tabular statement first referred to,
that, in 1831, the sum was $44,000,000, and by
July, 1832, rose to #67,000,000. The expansion
was $23,000,000. Mark this sum. On what kind
of securities was it—personal securities or on
stock ? We shall see presently. From this time
till 1836, (the expiration of the charter,) this item
fluctuated from #45,000,000 to #60,000,000.
} bow call your attention to the table just before
u?—that of the Pennsylvania Bank of the United
States. 1st. Observe that it starts off with a cir-
culation at once nearly equal to that of the United
States Bank, #18,000,000 Deposites nearly cor-
responding to those of the United Stages Bank.
The specie, if any, divided I presume. But as the
deposites and specie together could not support a
circulation of 18,000,000, it had to look out for the
ways and means. Hence, first, it makes the United
States Bank owe it #39,000,000, and, in turn, ad-
mits itself debtor to the United States Bank
#29000,000.
Now, sir, ate you not ready to ask how it
could so suddenly put #18,000,000 in circulation?
I understand both these concerns «ere kept in one
building. How else could it be done except by
paying that amount of its notes to the Unite 1
States Bank for such an amount of its notes? How
else could the United States Bank bee,me io sud-
denly indebted to this new concern just going into
operation?
What was this for? It was done, sir, to put the
notes in circulation, instead of the United Slates
Bauk, whose charter had expired.
And why this large mutual indebtedness of
29,000,000? Merely that each might have the
notes of- the other to pay with. Accotdingly, we
saw the new bank selling the notes of the old in
Georgia at 5 and 6 per cent, premium. This, sir,
was bat an egg shell concern.
Now notice the column of "discounts on stocks
and other securities," for that peculiar item does not
figure in the previous statements of the United States
Bank, whilst the deposites flourished. In July,
1837, it is first set down, and at the outset it is
26,000,000; in November, 1838, it is 24,000;
February 1st, 1840, it is 21,000,000. This is for
three years. What is the average? 23,000,000.
Now, what did I show the expansion in 1831 and
'32, by the United States, in loans and discounts?
It was 23,000,000. Here isa coincidence, at least,
from which I draw the just inference, that, stocks
were resorted to as a basis of issue.
How was it done? Why, just as our Southern
banks issue on cotton, which my colleague from
Glynn says is the proper basis. The stocks are
shipped to Europe, put in market, for sale or an
advance, and the proceeds become the basis of ex-
change, which the bank sells for a profit. With
the proceeds of its exchange, the bank redeems its
notes, or more frequently makes a second issue.
The result of this operation tempted corporations
and States to go in debt more than they could pay
—their stocks have consequently sunk be'ow the
advance price, and the bank not only suspends,
having no redeeming funds, but fails to pay, both
here and in Europe, as Mr. Biddle's bank did.
After "stocks" failed, the next, and really a
more reliable pretext fer a basis of circulation, was
that which my colleague thinks the true one, "pro-
dace." If this were of uniform value, as gold and
silver, it might, in a degree, answer; but it is not.
Hence the result was the same as that on the ope-
ration on stocks. The bank, like all speculators,
was liable to break.
As regards the produce and the owner of it, they
are, by the operation, placed in the predicament of
the people and the pablic deposites. The banks
use it and them to make interest and discount ac-
count rise, and to realize exchange on. But the
planter and merchant dare not withdraw it, or con-
trol it, lest be should bring about a suspension
and a pressure. In the South, the planter begins
to understand this, and I doubt not the Western
wheat grower or stock drover has bad a taste of it
The United States Bank fairly tried cotton as
a basis. The fate of that experiment was no doubt
an addition to the "other liabilities" of the Bank,
and a loss to the planter.
Either of these expedients to support bank issues,
results in this: That these corporations issue notes
not on their money or capital, but on the public
money, that of others, or the products of labor,
and on these issues make profit out of the very
men who furnish the capital—and what do these
men receive for it? Paper, sir, at 20 cents in the
dollar—exchange at 10 per cent, premium, after a
suspension and pressure. They entail on posterity
the inheritance, not of freemen, bat of slaves.
Mr. Biddle, toe, tried this basis of produce, and
went into the cotton region, and that and his stock
opertionsj burst the bubble; not, however, without
a third attempt at a blow, which is always the last,
to wit: His drafts on the future unknown—1 mean
post no'es.
In 1837, '38, '39, and '40, they are enumerated
by proper names—"post notes."
In 1840, also, you find another item, called "other
liabilities," after naming every sort you could con-
ceive. The sum of these is that unfortunate
amount of #26,000,000, put forth originally in
1832, no doubt for the twofold object of sopplying
ihp Vpowtes, and stimulating the people ti oppose
Jackson, who removed them, and Mr. Gilmer,
who would not restore them.
Now, Mr. Chairman, you talk about "experi-
ments upon the currency." This Bank has ex-
i' peiimented in all ways. The last is the worst, but
11 the first led to it. The banks have the currency in
i' their own hands. Jackson, with all his strength,
was powerless in any attempt to injure the cur-
rency. The only necessary effect of all he
did, was to prove its unsoundness, develope the
causes, and suggest a remedy, so far as the affairs
of the people were concerned. That remedy is on
your table. That, too, is powerless, except to pre-
vent mischief that might result from an improper
use of the public money by those who habitually
control the currency, and, through the power of it,
are striving now, as in 1834, to control the people.
The gentleman from New York [Mr. Barnard]
has told us emphatically that this power over the
currency is "that of a despot."
Thus much for the circulation of the country,
and the true causes of its derangements.
I now proceed to establish a third proposition by
the testimony of these Bank tables.   It is this:
The average annual loan by the banks, the
United States Bank or the local banks, does not
exceed, in any very considerable degree, the sum of
the capital of the banks, the deposites, and the spe-
cie basis; and yet at times it rises above, and again
sinks below.
Take the United States Bank first. The total
average during its existence of loans and discounts,
was #41,000,000. The average from 1817 to 1833,
the period of the removal of the deposites, was
$38,000,000; and the average from 1833 to 1836,
the last three years, was #56,000,000. 1 he average
of the last three years of its life, raised the average
of its first seventeen years #3,000,000 annually,
and exceeded the average of the seventeen by
#18,000,000.
The average of specie was #6,000,000. That of
deposites.public and private, was about #12,000,000;
the capital, #35,000,000. All together, the capi-
tal, specie, and deposites, made #53,000,000. Up
to 1833, then, the average fell short; and the total
average of its whole existence, #41,000,000, fell
short by over #10,000,000.
It is, therefore, not true that the country has re-
ceived an accession to its active capital by this
Bank, unless you admit that what purports to be
capital in it, is not so in fact. If you do that, yon
convict it of a fraud upon the people. Away, then,
with (Am argument against this bill, and for the
Bank.
What good, then, did you derive by this power
to loan? None; but much evil. For the loans and
discounts vibrated continually, from 30,000,000 to
65,000,000, producing distressing effects wherever
they occurred.
The fourth proposition I shall attempt to illus-
trate is this: Th; abstraction of the deposites, by
use or otherwise, is marked by a revulsion, because
they were permitted to govern the circulation; and
when stocks or produce are used as a basis, the fall
in the price of either works the same effect, ac-
cording to the extent of the redaction.
Ho* was it in 1818, '19, and '20? Many will
no doubt remember. Look at the tables. Depo-
sites fell from 24,000,000 to 2,000,000. They were
uted np.
How was it in 1824, '25, and  '26?   The cotton
planters will remember.   Look at the state of the
deposites.   They fell from 10,000,000 to 5,000,000.
How was it in  1833, when the grand removal
took place?   The loans were running np to sixty-
