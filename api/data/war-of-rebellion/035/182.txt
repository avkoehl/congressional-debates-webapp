Mount Sterling. Cluke is aiming to cross the Kentucky River. I can arrest the united force if he does, but may not each him, as they are all mounted. Dispatch just received from Carter estimates the enemy at 5,000. I still think there is not over 3,500.

Yours,

GILLMORE.

General BOYLE, Louisville, Ky.:

General Gillmore will cross the river at Hickman Bridge to-morrow morning and attack the enemy. Please use your forces to co-operate with him to the best of your ability, especially those at Lebanon. There is no reason why we should not capture or disperse the enemy's force. [O. M.] Poe's brigade can be sent to Bardstown by railroad at once, and cars retained there to move back to Lebanon if you wish.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.
