Major General HOWELL COBB,

Macon, Ga.:

Can you re-enforce General hardee; if so, to what extent? Cavalry to operate on the enemy's trains would be specially advantageous. Every man who can fight, whether he be enrolled or not, should now be put in requisition. Promptitude, energy, and determination may now give complete success.
