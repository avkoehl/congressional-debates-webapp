The fdvotite measme of his party was a sepaiation pf the Go-
vernment irom all ban! s, and that had been pursued openly and
a\owedly While said Mi S wo would give some power to tho
Executive, we do not seek to give him all power We desire to
legulatethe Tieasuiy by law, and not by the banks, Let the
gentlemen fiom the other side propose any measure, so that
they did not seek to place the Government at the beck of the
banks, State or X rated States, and it would meet his heaity con
cunen e, if he believed it to militate m favor of the public good.
Mr S defended with much yeal the late and present President?,
from the aspersions thrown out The late President, he said,
though one of the greatest men living m the woilr], was never-
theless liable to eiroi and expeuence had convinced him that
neither State hanks or United States Bank were tobe ti usted as
public depositen íes for the «rcasui y of the nation, The presen*

people he sought toihiow himself on no ote and certainly
would not thiow himself upon Fanny Wright Thatgentleman
soughtonl> to place the Government abote the contiol of cor

happy That was the chaimand only magic which he had used
to luie the confidence of his countrymen Mr S professed
himself as ready as the Senator, 01 any other man, to legulate
the mattei by law, hut by wholesome law, and where rhscre
tion was necessary, he gi cat ly preferred Executive disci etion to
that of the banks
