quence of appropriations made by law," but mo-
ney deposited in the banks is not in possession of
the Government, but is a debt due the Government
by the banks, and it cannot be drawn as the Go-
vernment may want it, and as "appropriations
made by law" may authorize its application, of
which we have hail sad experience in the high
handed transactions of the banks in May, 1837.
But the act an horizmg the deposite of the public
moneys in the local banks contained anothar viola-
tion of the Constitution. By one of the provisions
of the Constitution, (artic'e 1, section 8,) Congiess
shall have power to borrow money on the credit of
the United States, but Congress, has no constitu
tional authority to lend money. In that deposite
transaction, the Government money was lent to the
banks for a per centum—a consideration But
another evidence of the unconstitutionality of the
act authorizing the deposite of the public money m
the local banks, will be found in the fact that Con-
gresscannot interfere with the local banks to make
deposites m them, without the consent of the banks,
or, in some instances, the State , and in some in-
stances both the banks and States. When the
Government wishes to use the banks for such or
any other purposes, she must, with humility, ask
their consent or the consent of the States, or both,
as the case may be This kind of humility is un-
worthy of, and degrading to, the character of the
Federal Government Whatever is proper and
right for the Government to do, she can issue her
mandate to have done, and the very fact that she
cannot mterfpre with State institutions without the
consent of such institutions, or the States that create
them, is the strongest evidence that she not only
wants the constitutional authority, but that it is
unconstitutional to do so Hfnce I infer that it is
a violation of the Constitution to deposite the Fede-
ral revenue in the State and local banks. But I
have another constitutional objection to that act
It is, that it authorizes and requires the Secretary oí
the Treasury to take the notes of specie-paying
banks, under certain restrictions, m the payment of
the Government revenue.
The Constitution (article 1, section 10) provides
that nothing shall be made a lawful tender in the
payment of debts, but gold and silver That act
makes bank paper a lawful tender m debts due the
Government, a violation of that provision so ex-
press and so unequivocal. Tb< receiver  of public
money, when they know that bank paper can be
disbursed without loss to the Government and sa-
crifice to Gevernment creditors, wilt collect bank
paper to the amount of the immediate disburse-
ments; (they may and will frequently do it ) I
have no objections that they should, when it can
be done safely, they being held responsible, but
to make paper a lawiul tender by law, which i¡>
made unlawful by the Constitution, is a violation
Of that Constitution. These are my constitutional
objections to the financial connection of the Go-
vernment with the local bank=, but I believe such
a connection is inexpedient, impolitic, and danger-
ous. Permit me, before I undertake to show the
reasons that bring me to these conclusions, te deny
a charge made against the Administration and the
Democratic party The charge to which I allude
is, that this Administration and its supporters have
declared war against the banks, and upon com-
merce. Sir, I can only oppose this with a direct
denial, so far as I am concerned, and I am one of
the warmest (in feeling) supporters of the Admi-
nistration, and I believe I may venture to pro-
nounce the charge, on behalf of those who act with
me on this measure, one of the foul, false, Federal
slanders of the day, conceived in a benighted brain,
cultivated by a malignant heart, and given birth to
by the pen of poison, and the tongue of pollution,
to do its part to the destruction of the confidence
of the people in this Administration. Sir, let us
refer tosome facts, and see whether I havegrounds
and evidence to sustain this indictment for slander
which I have presented to the jury, (country)
When the American people (Democratic part) had
determined to put down the Bank of the United
States, or rather to let it expire on the limitation of
its charter, it became necessary for the public de-
posites to be removed, and in ordei that the public
might sustain no sudden shock from the loss of the
use of them, (for they had been discounted upon
while in the United States Bank,) they were placed
in the local banks, where they were also discounted
upon Here, then, is a manifestation of friendship
towards the local banks in giving them this great
and valuable boon But that was not all. By an
act of Congress (to which I have before referred)
their notes were made payable in the Government
revenue, which gave them a credit far and wide,
which they could not otherwise have had, which
credit, as I shall show, or rather the impropet use
of it, has been the cause of all the pecuniary em-
barrassments and commercial rum about which we
have heard so much piteous whining and howhngs
Those advantages were extended to the bank
by the last Administration, and was sustained by
the almost entire Democratic party, while the
Federalists were unmeasured in their abuse, as
we'l of the measure as of the banks themselves
The measure was denounced as ruinous to the
country—and a criminal violation of the "chai Urei
rights '" of the Bank of the United States, and the
local banks were sneermgly denounced as pet in-
stitutions, unworthy of the Government's confi-
dence, and incapable of performing the trust and
the duties imposed upon them In these predic-
tions there seems to have been some truth; but
they have performed the trust and duty to the Go-
vernment and the people about as well as the Bank
of the United States-—both bad enough—too bad
to be again trusted. So much for the last Adminis-
tration and its course towards the banks. How
has it been with the present Administration and
its supporters'* Why, sir, the present Chief Ma-
gistrate had hardly been fairly seated in his chair,
when he and every body else was shocked and
astounded with one of the most-violent pecuniary
tornadoes that ev er rolled its destructive torrents
over a land, crushing and prostrating every insti-
tution in the country m us desolating sweep
(I give the Whig account) A Government that
had funds on hand to the amount of more than
70,000,000 of dollars was made bankrupt in one
night, and to save the character, reputation, and
honor of the nation, the Executive was obliged to
call Congress together, at an expense of more than
f 200,000 dollars to the people But what was the
course of the Administration and the Democratic
party towards the banks'? War, do you think'
No The course of the Executive was indulgence
to the banks and indulgence to the people Sus-
pend the debts of the binks, said the Chief Magis-
trate, and use as a substitute for Government
money m their vaults, the Government credit
This was done, and the banks were saved, and the
people, who veré their debtor , indulged But
war is waged upon commerce Ah' how so'
During the last Admin stration, a system of credit
was es'abl shed toward the importing merchants!,
the same policy was pmsued by the present, and
when the banks suspended payment, the custom-
house bonds due the Government amounted to
upwards of $14,000 000 What was the course
of the Administration, think jou? Was ¡t to pro-
secute on the bonds, obtain judgment, issue execu-
tion, expose to sale all the property the merchants
had, sell them out, bed and bedding, cow and calf,
dog, broom, and tea kettle, for a part of the debt,
and send them to jail for the balance, as would be
the course of a soul'ess corporation with the Shy-
lock principles of a bank No, sir No, sir No
such course was pursued. What was done' Why,
a bill was introduced by the Democratic party, on
the recommendation of the President, to give the
banks indulgence, and a like bill to give indulgence
on the merchants' bonds, extending the time of
payment, I think, in the first instance, four, eight,
and twelve months, and, I think, in the latter, six,
twelve, and eighteen months, and this, sir, is the
kind of warfare that this Administration has
declared against the banks and against com-
merce Twice, sir, has the Government been
compelled to use her credit m the issuing
of Treasury notes to the amount of ten millions of
dollars each time to favor the banks and the im-
porting merchants Who, sir, in this measure,
was found wanting m kindness and good feeling to
the banks and merchants' Look at your journals,
sir.   You will find the entire Federal vote against
the measure to a man, I think; and the last bill
that passed this House, (owing to the absence of
some of the Democratic members,) passed by the
casting vote of the Speaker. But forhis voie> tho
bill which saved the country from rum and banfc-
ruptcy would have failed Yes, sir, the woepfso^
Government would have stopped from want ot
Treasury oil, and this great Federal fabric would
now be moulderiBg with the fallen and almost for-
gotten Republics of Greece and Rome; and ther 
were more gentlemen than one [Mr. Menefee]
who said on this floor, m discharge of official func-
tions, that they would rejoice to see this Govern-
ment prostrated, if it would secure the downfall
of this worthless and corrupt Administration.
But to return to the subject. I am m favor of esta-
blishing the Independent Treasury I believe there
is no ether method by which the public money will
hi safe, and the Government secure at all times in
its possession and use.
It must be manifest to every impartial man that
there is no safety m depositing the public revenue
m corporations over which the Government has
no control. Give me your attention while I pre-
sent you some of the difficulties and dangers that
must alwa}s attend such a connection with the
banks, and such an abandonment on the part of
the Government over the control of her revenue,
the only means by which she has to carry on her
operations. I say that the Federal Government
can exercise no control over State institutions con-
trary to then corporate privileges, or contrary to
what may be the wish or desire of the several
States from which they receive their charters.
Hence it was, no sooner did banks «uspena Specie
payments, than some of the States, by their Legis-
latures, justified them in it, though they were m
possession of millions of the publ.c money, and Ibe-
he\ e not one State attempted peremptorily to coerce
pavment Sir, what would have been the situation
of the country and he Government had we been.
at war with a foreign nauon duriHg the suspension?
The question is easily answered Universal rum
and national degradat on would have been the re-
sult Some of the difEcu'ties under which the Go-
vernment labored during the last war must be too
fresh ¡n the tmnd of every true friend to his coun-
try, to desire to see the national means put from
under the control of the Government, and into the
hands of capitalists, who generally carry what lit-
le patriotism they have m their pockets, and have
much more attachment to the mtans by which
their wealth is augmented than to our free institu-
tions, our national cha'acter ?nd honor, and the
equal rights of individual-- Out of the vast num-
ber of íntemptioiíl difficu'ües which give rise to
just causes of vvai, there is none, nor indeed are
all put together, half so likely to produce war as
violations of national comrrercal rights, (which
intoUe the preservation of the rights of sailors )
It was violations of this character on the part of
Great Britain that superinduced the last war, com-
monly called the second war for independence.
Who was most interested in the defence of Ameri-
can commerce' We would suppose the Nonhern
capitalists But, sir, who was found on the side of
the w ar' Not thev No indeed, they (with some
honorable exceptions,) were found assisting the
enemy, like the tores of the Revolution, aiding
and abetting and performing the part of spies for
the enemy, carryirg on daily intercourse with
them, and furnishing them with provisions and
munitions of war Ever} thing that could prattle,
from the corrupt tory of the gow n, down to the teie
a íííe of the cap and ribbon, was e na plo} ed m denounc-
ing the w ar as unjust and unholv It was considered
a crime to rejoice at the victories gained over the
enemy, and ths man was denounced and execrated
with religious anathemas, as bringing b'ood upon
his head, and divine judgment an! wrath upon his
soul, who would gwe aid, comfort, or support to
so unjust and so unholy a cause as the American
war So odious \v as the war in northern estima-
tion, lhat all efforts to obtain loans had to be made
in secret. It vv as dangerous for the man who had
mone}, and felt disponed to befriend and assist the
Government, for bim to do so Hence, it was not
uncommon for advertisements for loans to contain
a promise that the purpose for which the loan was
