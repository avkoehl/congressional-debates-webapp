General D. H. HILL, Commanding, &amp;c.:

GENERAL: The resignation of General Martin has not been accepted, and he has been directed by the Department to report to me for duty. I have instructed him to report to you for further orders, and desire you to assign him to the command of the troops in the State of North Carolina. I wish him to render all the assistance in his power toward collecting and enrolling the men in the State liable to military duty, so that the ranks of the North Carolina regiments may be speedily recruited. After this the surplus should be collected at camps of instruction and organized and prepared for active service in the field.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,R. E. LEE.

General.
HEADQUARTERS, August 12, 1862

General FITZ. LEE,Commanding Cavalry Brigade:

GENERAL: It is so difficult to procure forage at Hanover Court-House I would suggest you change your position to where it can be more conveniently obtained. In the event of your seeing an opportunity to strike a favorable blow at the enemy, provided he comes within your reach, you are authorized to do so. It is desirable that your horses should not be exhausted, and that you should not leave uncovered the approach to the railroad or Richmond.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. E. LEE.

General.

P. S.- Applications will be made to the superintendent of the telegraph line for an operator.

Major General D. H. HILL.

Commanding Department of North Carolina:

GENERAL: Major Lewis' battery of 32-pounder is, I fear, too much exposed on the other side of the Appomattox being difficult to remove. I desire them to be returned again this side of the James, and Major Lewis ordered to report to General Pendleton.

I thought the 32-pounders alluded to in your telegram were those sent by Colonel Rhett for the defenses on the Appomattox.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,R. E. LEE.
