He had examined very superflciallv tne legislation
of othei countries upoi this po lit, anu he found
that many of the nations of Eu ope, f om winch we
had copied most of our publ c laws, mide this act

is here proposed He had heard n> objec-
tion against this feature oí the bill from any
quarter of the House, and he hoped thete would be
none
The twenty first section might not be considered
by «orne as peculiarly appropriate to tin  bi l, but
he trusted to be able to sanely the Senate that it
cennected itself with t s provisions in a very nn-
poitant manner, and ought to form a pait oí it
The section made it the dutj of the Secretary ot
the Treasury, when there should be an amount
upon deposite to the uedil of the Trcasuierbevond

surplus in stocks of the United Stales, or ol some

vestments It also directed him, whenever the

There was another aspect in v\ hich he vv ished to
present these provisions The con tant expenen~e
of the Treasury Department, since the final extin-
guishment of the national debt, had shown the ne-
cessity of some elastic provision in our legislation
upon the subject of the public revenue and expendi-
tures, which would accommodate l'self to the va-
ried conditions of the Treasury, or, rather, -«Inch
would enable the head of the Treasury Department
0  to manage the national finances, as that the
Treasury may be at all times prepared to meet the
oils upon it, and that an amount of money should
it no time be hoardetl therein, to the injury of the
business of the countiy or its citizens Dunng the
existence of the public debt, the provisions of law,
and appropnations of money connected with it,
furnished this regulator for the slate of the Trea-
sury The applications of money up in the debt
were at all times governed by the surplus of leie
nue over theexpendituies, while all the unexpendel
1  al nces of appropriations, after a limited period,
passtd to the sinking fund, and were absorbed in
the d=bt A troublesome surplus ot revenue, ther"-
foie, could n°ver exist while that application re-
mained open On the other hind, as the appropri-
ations for the ) ear were carefully provided for be-
fors any application upon thedebt, it was scarcely
possible that any contingency, not foreseen during
the if n'ular annual sessions of Congi ess could occur,
lo disenable the Treasury to meet the demands
upon it arising undei the current appropria'ion
bills The amount of revenue intended for appli-
cation upon the debt would always be sufficient to
meet inv disippomtment in the acciuing íeceipts
into the Treasuiy That time, hoe ever, had now
p s The debt was paid, and li m the neeessit)
ol the cast, and the stale i f the le°islalio i < i Con-
gress, i xpermien's had been made to measure the
actual approptialions by the estimated revenue, and
to make them come out even Tor (he first few
j ears of this trial, from a state of circumstances
not at the time sufficiently consideied, but now
c t lj and properly estimated, the revenue got
laigel) the bettet of the appropnatuns Thsgave
rise to the bill directing a deposite of the surplus
«ith the Stites, and again the pctuil appiopnattons
and i he climated revenue were attempted to be
ii,uuli measured. A revn'sion in the trade, and
bus ness, and banking, ol the count) y i ame the an-
tic i '•a t 1 ¡evenue wis cut short, md that pottion of
it which rested upe n ciedits, could not be realized
In leed, the v rv money on depexne ¡n tne banks,

maiieled, and, cotnp entiveh, the v hule anticipated
me ins ol the Treasuiy were either not realized, or

Whit followed was liesh in the recollection of the
*■ en li and the counlr), and he would not consume
ihe tine, hy an petit.on of the measures of relief to
ihe ce untr) and the Tieasury, adopted at that ses-
sion
He hid mentioned these facts to show the neces-
sity of some provision to guard against these disap-
pointments in the acciumg revenue, as well as to
pi event the evil of a hoarding of money, when the
levenue should overreach the appropriations    In
i her sense he. eci i leredth  piovisiensof the sec-
tie ii of Ihe fir t miptrlnice, and he entieated Sena-
te rs not to suilei past recollections to prejudice their
muds but to evimine these facts, to peimit our
lite ex| enence to have its due weight, to reflect
how frequently similar disappointments, as lo the
levenue, might be evpenenced—how often suipius
line wits of levenue might alarm the public mmd,
is to the safety of Ihe public treasure, and then to
decide upon the adoption or re-jee lion ol the sec-
tion
Ti e only remiinm  section which he would no
ti e is oe nneeic 1 with the first great objee t ot the
bid, was the twenty seventh Thi, ectiem autho
n 'es the Treasurer of Ihe United States to receive,
at  t ie Treasury, and at such o her places as he
Senate.
si all designate, payments of money, in advance,
f( r the purchase ot public lands, and to give a re-
c rpt for each payment, w hich shall be curruit at
any of the land offices, at any pubheor private sale
of lands Since the bill had been reported, he had
become convinced that this section was too loosely
drawn, ind required to be amended. These re-
ceipts might be taken and treated as negotiable pa-
per, and might, as the section now stood, be given
11 a form which would make them so upon their
f ice This would subject the bill to the imputation
(f authorizing the emission of a paper currency,
I ased upon the public lands, a thing by no means
intended by himself, and he was sure not by any
member of the committee who assented to the re-
j ort of the bill He had, therefote, prepared an
amendment, declaring that the receipts tobe given by
tlie Treasuiei, pursuant to the pio/isioiis of the
ectio i, should not be negotiable oi transferable,
I y assignment, or dehv ery, or in any othei manner
whatsoever, but that every such receipt should be
presented at the land office by, or for, the person
o whom it was given, as shown upon its face In
ihis shape he hoped the section would not t ob-
jectton^ole upon the ground auove stated while he
ehought et would be apparent that us general provi-
sion would be of great convenience to fhjse pur-
chasers of the public lands who were to emigiate
from the old Slates, and to carry with them ih<*
means to make their purchases It would save
them from the trouble and risk of transporting mo-
ney of any description, and also fiom the danger of
taking, to so distant a portion of the'eountry, a
currency which would not answei their purpose
when there It veas not apprehended that the
Treasurer would be called upon to select many
points as places where these payments might he
made Perhaps the pom s at which it was proposed
to keep ofhc s for the deposite ot 'he public money
would be i-ufficietit, and peihaps a few other prin-
cipal places might be selected vv th increased con-
venience to the public A certificate of the depo-
site of the money at any designated point, trans-
mitted to the Treasurer, would command the re-
quired receipt from him, as well as the actual pay-
ment of the money at the Treasur) iiself, and as
this could be done through the mail, the party making
the payment would be saved 'he expense of a jour-
ney to the Treasurer's office in this city
A further and material advantage to the bant-
ing institutions, he was assured, vvould be derived
from the adoption of this section The noies of
specie pa)ing banks aie now authorized to be re-
ceived iot all pay rnentt , except foi lands, and if this
bill passed, would be receivable, as well for lands
ai othei public dues, to a greater or less extent,
for six oi seven years yet to come Sull a citizen
of the edd States, about to emigrate to the jictf, and
having Ihe mon-y far th¿ purchase of his lands in
the notes of specie paying banks of the old States,
vvould not venture to take tho e notes as the means
of payment, because there would be a danger that
the land officer, to whom he might wish to make
payment, would not receive the notes of even specie
pa)ing banksso remote from the place where alone
they could be convened into specie The eau-
giant would be compelled, therefore, to present
the note>, convert them himself', and take the
specie as his means of payment, unless the pro-
vision now proposed, or some one of a similar cha-
racter, should enable him to make the payment
before bis journey is commenced Theexpenence
of the past had proved that this was the course pur-
sued by the emigrants, towards the banks m the
vncinty of their former residences, and pursued,
from compulsion, but he had been in ormed that
during the shoit period, in the summer of 1836,
when pa) ments for lands were actually received
at the office of the Treasurer in this city, large
amounts were paid and received, and that the
banks here, and in the adjoining States of Virginia
anil Mil) land, experienced sensible and material
lehef from the practice
He would heie close his examination of the first
class ot the piovisnns ol the bill, and give a very
brief attenmn of the second those lelaung to the
proposed change m the currency to be received in
payment of the public dues
