Colonel R. V. RICHARDSON, Brookhaven:

With the cavalry you have and Steede's, and any other you can collect, move from Brookhaven in direction of Port Gibson, and press the enemy's rear as much as possible, cutting their supply trains. Other cavalry is operating from Edwards Depot with same purpose. Report to me when you leave, and your strength, and the road you take. Keep me constantly informed of your operations. Is there any news of Wirt Adams?

SIR: By order of General Ruggles, I send you above copy of telegram just received from Lieutenant-General Pemberton, in reply to dispatch forwarded to him this morning, communicating the intelligence that the enemy were moving down from Baldwin's to Camargo, and will reach that point in a few hours. I must urge you to move by this point, to unite with me near Camargo, or by a more direct route to co-operate. The enemy is represented in force. Please move with promptitude. Forrest is not to be heard of.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOHN M. SANDIDGE,
