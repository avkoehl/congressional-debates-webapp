I am much obliged to you for directing Colonel Jackson to communicate with me. It may become highly important for Colonel Jackson and myself to unite at or about Millborough, if the enemy seeks to penetrate the valley about Lexington. I am therefore taking a position on the Warm Springs and Harrisonburg turnpike, from whence I may move in either direction. I will promptly advise you of any important movement of the enemy as soon as discovered.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. D. IMBODEN,

Brigadier-General.

MOUNT CRAWFORD, April 30, 1864.

General S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General:

I have organized into companies, and have commenced arming over 1,000 reserves in Augusta, Rockingham, and Shenandoah, under paragraph 22, Special Orders, No. 87. A raid upon us is imminent. I ask immediate authority to call out temporarily these forces if the enemy advances.

Respectfully,

J. D. IMBODEN,

Brigadier-General.

WAR DEPARTMENT, C. S. A.,

Richmond, Va., April 30, 1864.

General J. D. IMBODEN,

Mount Crawford:

You are authorized to call out the reserves as far as organized, according to your judgment.

J. A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War.

ABINGDON, April 30, 1864.

General S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector-General:

General Johnson has just informed me that he has received instructions from General Bragg to throw his cavalry forward. This cannot be done at present, because the cavalry destined for that part of my line has not yet returned from North Carolina, and all the rest of my cavalry is concentrating at different points for a necessary purpose. I will explain more fully by mail. Please inform General Bragg that his orders, if given direct to me instead of to my subordinate, will be executed with the utmost promptness whenever practicable.

S. B. BUCKNER,

Major-General.
