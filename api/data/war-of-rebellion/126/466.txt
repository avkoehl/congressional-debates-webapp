Numbers 113. OFFICE ASSISTANT QUARTERMASTER, Winchester, Va., August 15, 1865.

Ma. General M. C. MEIGS,

Quartermaster-General U. S. Army, Washington, D. C.:

GENERAL: In compliance with General Orders, Numbers 39, Quartermaster-General's Office, dated July 1, 1865, I have the honor to submit the following personal narrative of my services since July 1, 1864 accompanied by statements required therein:

On the 1st of July, 1864, I was on duty at City Point, Va., assisting Captain P. P. Pitkin, assistant quartermaster and depot quartermaster at that point. On the 11th day of July I was assigned to duty as chief quartermaster Cavalry Corps, Army of the Potomac, by command of Lieutenant-General Grant; entered immediately on duty as ordered; shipped the First and Third Divisions, Cavalry Corps, on board transports for Washington, D.

No transportation or other public property of importance fell into the hands of the enemy. During my service as chief quartermaster of the Middle Military Division my attention was particularly attracted to the Army of the Shenandoah, numbering from 50,000 to 60,000 men. In consequence of the Winchester and Potomac River Railroad having been entirely destroyed previously, this large number of men, with some 26,000 animals, had to be supplied by teams from Martinsburg, W. Va.

It will be seen that it was no small task to properly arrange the running of these large trains so that the army might not at any time be in need of subsistence, forage, or clothing. The large number of cavalry rendered the supply of forage a difficult task, when it is taken
