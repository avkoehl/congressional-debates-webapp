as much, for any given time, as was the use of the
single boat Vesuvius for the «ame time on the Mis-
sissippi rivet? I think this will not be disputed.
The menopoly was worth as much for one day, or
any given tune, as was the Vesuvius for one dav,
or the «ame time. I present the subject m tins
view, to ascertain, as near as possible, (and that,
too, by the rule of justice the committee and friends
of the bill have given us,) what compensation Mr
Pulton has received for his- improvements in steam
engine machmeiy, so far as the value of the mono-
poly can be known. The monopoly was enjovcd !
for near twenty-four years, or about 8,760 davs,
which, at $600 per day, will be upwards of
$5,000,OOU, which Mr Fulton has received from
his invention by the exclusive puvilege alone ot
navigating the waters of New York. I have no
idea that he received this sum, but the estimate is
made by the same rule that his friends rely upon
to claim from the Government $50,000 for the use
of the Vesuvius, and if it is a just rule in the one
case, it must be just in the other. Taking this i ule
for our guide, pecuniary matters between the estate
of Robert Fulton and ire Government of the United
States and the Government of New York, or the
people of both, stand as follows-
Robert Fulton in account for monopoly «I the
navigation of the «tins within the jmisdiction
of New York twenty-four yean. - $5,000,000
Cish advanced by Government to put
four steamboats on the Mississippi
and Ohio rivers ... 40,000
Cash advanced to make experiments in
torpedoes, which failed       -           -         r>,000
$r),04r),000
I have not taken the usual bonus into the calcu-
lation that other patentees receive, which is all (lie
framers of (he Constitution, it seems, contémplala!
the patentee should have by Iw    I mean the ex-
clusive use and benefit of his discoveries, and pa-
tent for fourteen years    The account, by thi* esti-
mate, will exhibit Robeit Fulton to have received
five millions and forty-five thousand dolíais to oflsct
this account.   Tbe est-lc of Mr   Fulton has no
claims that can be recognised as legitimate bt tin-.  I
Congress or any couit of j wice in  thxs< Unit d  l'
States, to offset this aeeouii      Tine,   Ins  memory    I
has a claim of gratitude upon   the  /Vindican pi >     I
pie that peihaps in ur cm   be canci llul, but the
claim of "latitude to the memory of Fulton gi>  s   i
no claim to his hriis foi an apprrprialionoí muni y
by this Congress
Congress might (as is said m the case of Laf.u-  I
ette Ihey did) have appiopnated monev for the  I
benefits the American people derived from Mi    i
Fulton's diseoveues, and gratilude might h uc m- I
duced them, with constitutional propriety, to have  '
enlaiged the sum    But no such appropriation can   ¡
be made to his  heirs for their ancestor's virtu* s,  ¡
and not theirs     If any appropriation  is made to   |
them, it must be made bv a claim founded in 1 iw
and the Constitution, jn the form of i tonlrut,   |
either expressed or implied,  and no si'ch c!ai n
exists, nor can any such claim be supposed, H  is
an insult to the understanding of any man to nisi t   |
"seriously upon   such a thing, and so conscious   re    I
the friends of this bill of this fact, that ihey scan i -    i
Iv attempt to msi,t, in argument, upon such claim
Their efforts to support it consist m eloquent "n,
peals to our syni"nhie , our patriotism  is  cil   d
upon, and our hum-mity is invoked, ai d Ion l clh
arp made upon our liber ititv
Sir, I hope thefi lends of this bill do notarrc-'e    '
to themselves all the humi i ly, symp-Mby, and pi-    I
triotism     When I hear pentLmen tilkso imn     '
so loud, and JO   long > out patriotism,  sympathy,   'I
chanty, and h iron-  tj, I ..«e to sec some ot   it
I like to see gent1" nen "dou n 'villi the dust," per-
hips, vvheii it comes Xopersonal liberality, that is,
measuring oi r o« n chanty and  liberality by  oui
own parses, these opposed to this billmiy be found
quite as liberal and quite as humane and quite as
patriotic as those who talk so much about it    Let  ¡
no man tell me, su, that he can outcio me m hbe-  i
rality on other people's means    It is easy foi gen- I
tlemen to  talk loud, long, and eloquently about
liberality, and carry into effect  thsir good feehng,
when they have nothing to do to carry out their
jioiiie natures but open the National Treasury, and
appropriate the contents thereof, foi which, in all
probability, many of them never toiled or sweat.
Here let me ask the fuends ot this bill, le t I
should forget it, while they are singing hosannas to
Mr Fulton's patnottsm lor nobly aacnficmg his
time in the experiments of the torpedoes' whether
he had not been to Europe manifesting his patriot-
ism by trying to cor>v mce some of the Kings of the
utility and importance of his plan, to the end that
he^ might receive a pecuniaty lewaid for his disco-
very? and whether it was not when thm display-
ing hispatuodsjii for the benefit of the national de-
fence of France, that his plans were pionounced by
Bonaparte "asystem of quackeiy, and he an im-
postor?" As a lurthei evidence of his patnohsm,
1 will ask the friends of this bill to deny that he af-
tenvards otiered to England, or any other Eu-
ropean power, lor then national defence, the bene-
fits of his discovery and patent foi turpi does and
mil man.ru cn/rmes of destruction
I hope, for the honor of the menioiy of the man
n hose seivices I esteem, that the friends of this bill
who arrogate to theiisehas the right to eulogise
him and sustain this claim, will be able toansvvei
this question m the negative
Sir, I hope to be indulged while I attempt to re-
spond to souk oi the aigummts of gentlemen
And first, that most lehed upon, it it i an be called
an irsrument, is, tint we aie bound to pass this
appropriation, in consequence of the gieat advan-
tages the country has derived liom the inventions
of Robeit Fulton, that it is due to his memory and
his services, and consequently his heirs have a
claim upon < ur gratitude. Sir, open the dooi once
foi claims of this charactei, and wheie will you
slop? And I make the inquny m relation to ap
pioprtations for other discoveries than that of the
power and utility of steam and steamboats Will
the inventors of v .limbic impiovements evei cease
to Knock at the dooi of voui legislative halls, and
will you discriminate betwun those lhat aie men-
tonous m an eminent degicc, and those that may
be i little less so'
To judge of the. mipoil, nee and me i its of dis-
coveries by the cost an 1 complication of machine) y
involved, like that of the steam engine, is not i
conect criterion, fi r some of the dncoyuies we
iiijoy, involving die least comphe ition and greatest
simpl.city of machinery, aie of the srreatest
public and pr vate utility For instance, whit
comparison is there be'ween the ical uti Uy of the
plough ind the steim cngii  ' Small, and hum-
ble, f nd simp'e as is the mechanism of the forme r,
it has dono moie to amelioiate the condition ol
mankind, and add t > the wi alth ol our countrv, in
one century, than will the steam < ngme foi a
millennium
We have now no le s than thiee patentees ap-
plicants lor Government patronage, lor what they
think great and valuable improvements in the
application of steam, vi/ to prevent the explosion
oi stt am boilers, (a veiy humant ob|ect ) How
liiiny other npplic itions there ¿re for Gov eminent

dmarr that thcie is in apphcalums that have tor

'Ihere are many valu- ble disc vei <_s, ail iinnj
hignly important imp - i< emoN upon th i e disco-
veries, vvhose\ast and immeasjrable public utility
furnish them with as strong argument, m favor of
Gjv eminent patronage as the steam engine im-
provement of Mr Fulton But, if you had the
financial ability to patronize all of them, there is
one grand objection to doing it, which has its foun-
dation in the nature of our free institutions; I mean
that principle that secures equal rights and ecraality
of propel ty to all.
One individual may have a geniu3 for painting,
another for music; one for invention, another for
carrying it into practical effect and public utility,
one for general literary and scientific acquirements,
and anothei for plain, common labor, and industry
All these may be physically and mentally construct-
ed for the various pursuits that their inclinations
lead them to follow, and for which their talents fit
them, and yet all be equally useful to society. I
ask, where is the justice of taxing all the lest for
the benefit of any one of these, or one of these for
the benefit of all the rest? I ask, what feature of
our Constitution warrants the act that appropriates
to a favored individual a princely fortune out of
the honest proceeds ol the working and industrious
many, to gratify what gentlemen please to call
honuiabU kmnanUy, sympathy, and jialuottsm?
Establish and puisue a policy of this kind, and
how long will it be before we will behold the/pec-
tacle of a population made u'p of a few enjoying
puncely fortunes obtained by your legislative
bounty, the result of your humanity' and of the
many in squalid wretchedness and degraded de-
pendence, and hourly made so by you and your
humanity and your legislative bounty'
But to lespond to some of the arguments m favor
of this bill. The gentleman from Kentucky [Mr
Chambees] tells us, in substance, that Congress
made an appropriation to an individual «f $20 000
for a new, and, as it was supposed, an improved
method of pointing cannon for the destruction of
an enemy therefore, this bill ought to pass. He
also said there had been a bill introduced, and was
now on our tables, asking for an appropriation of
$10,000 for the perpetual use of an improved steam
vapoi bath in the navy and army ol the United
St ites therefore, this bill ought to pass, oi such
was his inference.
Thi appropnation heie reierred to, of f20,000,
may or may not have been right. Trie appropna-
tion of s, 10,000, as referred to, and asked lor m the
bill on y our table, may be right, or it may be
\uong, that is a matter yet to be decided. Cut,
right or wrong, they cm have no beaimg upon th s
bill. If they are wrong, that does not make the
appropriation here asked for right, and, if light,
they afford no reason why this should be wrong
They stand upon their own merits 1 hope tins
bill will be compelled to stand on tts own merits
The g< ntleman informs us that it was by the in-
fluence ol the steamboat Vesuvius that the glorious
battle of New Orleans was gamed, that saved and
secure I to that beautiful and rich city its beauty
and booty 1 flunk the gentleman does great in-
justice, il not to Old Hickory, at least to the brave
riflemen of his own State. The Hero of New Oi-
leans is a name as well known throughout the
woild as that of General Andrew Jackson, indeed,
they are sy nonymous But as I am inclined to
think it unpleasant to the gentleman to associate
any thing good and brave with the name of that
distinguished individual, I will leave it out of the
question, so far as he was connected with that glo-
r ous and impenshab'e victory, which claims cne-
third ol the bright page of history that records the
ev er memorable battles of Marathon and Thermo-
p\lp But I cannot consent to tear thus rudely
irom the brow of the brave and gallant Kentucky,
Mississippi, and Tennessee riflemen, fhe never-
lading laurels that they so justly and meritoriously
gained upon the plains of New Orleans, on the glo-
rious eighth of January, and bestow them, either on
the steamboat Vesuvius, or merge them in an appro-
priation of $100,000 to the relief of the owners of
theVesuviu. So veiy inconsiderable was tins
steamboat in that vast and splendid transac'ion, that
l ht Commanding General was not aware that she
v as known m th-3 tiansaclion, not is there a posi-
tive statement, accompanied with the solemnity of
an oath, that any other person knew her to be.
Sir, the glonous events of that battle, and the
brave riflemen who gained it, have been the theme
of song in the Mississippi Valley Irom that day to
this. Some have represented the brave Kentucky
reilemen as "possessing the powers of the horse,
with the ability, on the appioach of the enemy* to
kick them out of the country"—others have com-
