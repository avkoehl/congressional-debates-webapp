Mr. SHERMAN. I am directed by the Com-
mittee on Finance to report certain tabular
statements from the Treasury Department,
showing the rates of increase and decrease of
duty on articles mentioned in the bill (H. li.
No. 2045) now before the Senate, entitled "An

mitted to that committee.
The motion was agreed to.

Mr. SHERMAN. At this period of the ses-
sion I deem it proper to move that the Com-
mittee on Finance have leave to sit during the'
sessions of the Senate.
The motion was agreed to.
dull'tii i1akb0h.
Mr. RA MSEY. The morning business seems
to have been gone through with. It will be
recollected that yesterday morning I called up
a little bill, and after being taken up it was
passed over by the expiration of the morning
hour. I should like now to proceed to the
consideration of that bill if die Senate will
indulge me in doing so. It, is Senate bill
No. 703.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator from
Minnesota asks unanimous consent to call up
the bill in regard to the harbor of Dulnth, which
was taken up yesterday and cur, off by the
expiration of the morning hour. Is there objec-
tion ?
Mr. DAVIS. 1 object.
The VJCE PRESIDENT. The Senatorfrom
Kentucky objects.
Mr. RAMSEY. Can I not move to lay aside
all other business with a view to taking up this
bill?
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator can
move to pass over or to postpone. It is not
for the Chair to intimate the motion that should
be made ; but, if n, motion to pass over is made,
the question must be taken separately on each
measure passed over, if it is insisted upon.
Mr. RAMSEY. I move to postpone all
other orders with a view of taking up this bill.
Mr. MORRILL, of Maine. What is the
proposition ?
The VICE PRESIDENT. It is the bill in
regard to the improvement of the harbor of
Duluth, which was taken up yesterday. The
Senator from Minnesota moves to postpone all
other orders, the morning business being con-
cluded, for the purpose of proceeding to the
consideration of that bill.
Mr. MORRILL, of Maine. What is the
present order V
The VICE PRESIDENT. It is the Calendar
of resolutions laid over.
Mr. RAMSEY. It affects the morning hour
only, I presume.
Mr. MORRILL, of Maine. I am very anx-
ious to take up the joint resolution which I
reported from the Committee on Appropria-
tions yesterday in relation to the expenses of
the Indian delegations. There is a necessity
for passing it. The Indians are expected to
leave town on Monday, and the resolution
ought to be sent to the House to-day.
Mr. SUMNER. We cannot hear the Sen-
ator on this side of the Chamber.
Mr. MORRILL, of Maine. I was remark- â€¢
ing that I think it is quite important to take
up the resolution which I reported yesterday
from the Committee on Appropriations to pay
the expenses of delegations of Indians visiting
this eity. They are expected to leave on Mon-
day, and of course it is desirable that the res-
olution should go to the House at otiee. I do
not suppose that it will occupy any time.
Mr. SUMNER. Why not take it up now?
Mr. MORRILL, of Maine. That is exactly
what I was arguing that the Senate ought to do.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator from
Minnesota obtained the floor at the conclusion
of the morning business and moved to take up
Senate bill No. 763.
Mr. MORRILL, of Maine, I have no objec-
tion to his proposition coming up, if he will
allow me to dispose of this resolution first.
Sir. RAMSEY. I will allow the Senator to
call up his bill immediately after mine is dis-
posed of. [Laughter.]
Mr. WILLIAMS. I suggest to the Senator
from Minnesota to take up his bill, and thirti
allow it to be laid aside informally for the pur-
pose of considering the appropriation bill.
Mr. RAMSEY. If the Senator from Maine
will agree to that 1 ana willing to agree to it.
Mr. DAVIS. The bill of the honorable
Senator from Minnesota cannot be called up
without resistance.
Mr. MORRILL, of Maine. Then I hope
the Senator from Minnesota will allow me to
take up this resolution.
Mr. DAVIS. That bill is simply a project
for a land subsidy to make an artificial harbor
within a stonq's throw of a very fine natural
harbor. The first subsidy that it asks is five
hundred thousand acres of land.
Mr. WILLIAMS. I rise to a question of
order.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator
from Kentucky will suspend. The Senator
from Oregon rises to a question of order. He
will state the question oforder.
Mr. WILLIAMS. 'The motion to pass over
is not debatable. The Senator is making some
statements about the bill which ought to be
replied to, if they are allowed to be made.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator
from Minnesota has moved to postpone all
other business, not to pass over.
Mr. DAVIS. I want to defeat the motion
to take up that measure.
Mr. MORRILL, of Maine. ' Under the cir-
cumstances I trust the Senator from Minnesota
will allow me to call up this joint resolution.
Mr. liAMSEY. Will not the Senator allow
me, having been successful yesterday in call-
ing up this bill and then being cut off by the
expiration of the morning hour, to take it up
now, and then I will consent to its being
informally passed over?
Mr. TRUMBULL. We have gota rule here,
I believe, that allows a person to rise to a ques-
tion of order and set everybody else down,
and I want to avail myself of it for once, and
move to pass over the subject, whatever it is,
before the Senate.
land office bepoet.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The first reso-
lution on the Calendar is the resolution offered
by the Senatorfrom Oregon, [Mr. Williams,]
on the 20th of May, to print extra copies of
the report of the Commissioner of the General
Land Office for 1809, with the report of the
Committee on Printing thereon.
Mr. TRUMBULL. I moge that that be
passed over.
The \ ICE PRESIDENT. That motion has
priority.
Mr. MORRILL, of Maine. I do not see any
occasion for any such motion as that.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The motion is
uli^ debatable under the rule.
The motion was agreed to.
expenses of indian delegations,
_ Mr. RAMSEY. Now, I presume my mo-
tion comes up, to pass over all other morning
business to proceed to the consideration of
Senate bill No. 703.
