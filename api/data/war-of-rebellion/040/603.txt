DUBLIN DEPOT, February 1, 1863.

Major General J. B. FLOYD,

Commanding Virginia State Line, near Saltville, Va.:

GENERAL: I have just now received your letter of yesterday. I am sorry that I cannot at present concentrate a large force at the salt-works. If you will give me early notice of the advance of the enemy, I can send 1,200 or 1,500 men to the salt-works as soon as railroad transportation can be provided. In less than twenty-four hours from the time I receive the information, I think the men ought to be at the works.

The artillery battalion now at Jeffersonville is so near you that it ought certainly to be able to reach the works in time to take part in their defense, if your scouts give notice promptly of the approach of the enemy. I will direct the officer commanding the battalion, on receiving information from you of the advance of the enemy, to proceed promptly with his battalion to any point you may indicate.

Could a sufficient force of negroes be obtained at reasonable hire, in the counties adjacent to the salt-works, to construct the desired defensive works? The manufacture of salt is so essential, and the works near you are engaged on so many contracts for the Confederate and State Governments, that I should not like to impress their hands except on the most pressing emergency. I fully concur with you as to the inconvenience of the boundary line recently established for my department. I addressed a letter to the Adjutant-General, pointing out the inconvenience, and asked him at least to give the commander of the Department of East Tennessee orders for the defense of the approaches to the salt-works, through his department (chiefly by Louisa Fork and Pound Gap), and communicate his instructions on that point to me, but have received no answer.

What is the date of your information from the Kanawha? I have information from the same quarter that there are only three regiments of infantry, three companies of cavalry, and two batteries at Fayette Court-House.

This information was given to me on the 23rd ultimo.

Very respectfully, &amp;c.,

SAM. JONES,

Major-General.
