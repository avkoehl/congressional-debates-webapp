which is less lhan ths outstanding appropriations
has been for (be last forty years.
The honorable member from Maine [Mr. Fas-
senden] is wholly at a loss to account how it is
that the revenue from customs should have been
esiimated at $ 19,000,000 by Secretary Woodbury.
I will furnish him the data on which that estimate
was founded. It was on information furnished by
the collectors of potts throughout the Union, by
the most intelligent merchants in our commercial
cities, and ihe most experienced officer-! in the
Treasury Department. Cm lhat honorable mem-
ber furnish me the rUta on wh>ch that estimate has
been reduced about $5 000,000? Into that branch
of the inquiry he appears not io have extended l-us
examination; possibly for the reason aligned by
himself—that the subject of the nuances was dif-
ficult and complex, and hence be preferred to take
the statements of tht, Sccteiary as he found them;
and, as was very naturally to have been ex-
pected, has an i ved with the Secretary at precisely
the same conclusions. We are told, however,
that these estimates have not been realized. Tiue,
they have not been; but to the extent of the means
furnished by Codgress at its last session, and which
shall be realized, all will agree, this outstand-
ing balance should be reduced; then lake the Se-
cretary's own reduced estímale of means for the
year, and whit is the amount wh-ch he admits lo
have been provided for the v ear's operations?
But bel'oie I present this statement, it wid be
, necessary to coirect some errors in the repot t,
which can scarce hive escaped the notice of mem-
bers. The Secretary, in a communication to ihe
Senate on ihe 30th ot June, says that "certain pay-
ments made by the Bank of the United States on
account of the War Department in the West, in
1840, nol having been entere-1 in the books of this
department nn'il March, 1811, should have been
included in ihe receipts for that month. This was
inadvertenily omitted to he done, although the
amount was included in the cxpmidiiures for ih-it
month. With this correction, the amount rtcp'.ved
in March, 1841, will be $1,709 047, instead of
$1,090,000, as s-aied in the communication Above
referred to." Tais error corrected, and the avail?,-'
ble balance in the Treasury on the 1st of Ju>ie
should be increased §619,136. It should a;so he
increased by the sum of §500,000, an account of
Treasury noies stated to have been redeemed in
the first two months of the year, and charged as
an expenditure prior to ihe 4th of March; wh eh
were not in point of (act redeemed, and enb-red on
the books ot the Treasury Department, until alter
the 4'h of March, (see Secietary's report, pasees 3
and 12;) and by ihe further sum of $215,000
in the mints, and which does not appear to have
been included m the balance reported to have
been in the Tieasury either on the' 4in of Match
or on the 1st of June. The Secretary also esti-
mates that §1,110,611 will be necessary to redeem
the Treasury note.? which were issued between the
1st of January and the 4:h of March. I confess I
am wholly at a loss to discover the reason which
induced the belief that this amount of Treasury
notes was to become a charge upon the resources
of the Government in the year 1841. As these
notes bear-an interest of six per cent, and are at a
premium of from one-half to threa-fourths of one
per cent, if paid into the Treasury Io-- lands or for
customs, they must be received at par, and cannot,
therefore, be fairly expected to come back, when
only one-half ihe revenue is required to be pi id in
gold and silver, and the other half may be paid in
the noles of specie paying banks. They will be
taken by capitalists, and held as a safe and profita-
ble investment of money, and will be relumed to
the Treasury only when they cease to bear inte-
rest; which will not be until after the c'ose of the
present year. These Treasury rotes, therefore,
will not in all probability find their way hack into
the Treasury until 1842. Tnis last amount, added
to the sum of $9,219,666, which the Secreiaiy pro-
poses to carry over to the next year as an unex-
pended balance, will increase that balance to
$10,330,227. Deduct, then, from the whole amount
of outstanding balances of former appropriations,
amounting, on the 4th of March, to $33,429,616
This sum of            -           -           -     10,330,227
And the whole charge upon the Tn a-
sury, (rom the 4th of March, 1811,
(if not burdened with additional
new approprhtions,) will te
Take ihe Secretary's own reduced

rors to which I have alluded,) and

215,000
$■22,064,531
Deficit at the end of this year - $1,034 858
instead of $6 000 941, as stated by the Secretary.
And it is to supply this deficit thai Congress has
been convened, at an expense to the people of
nearly one-half the amount to be supplied—a de-
lict which can only be created by the most extra-
vagant and wasteful expenditure of the public mo-
ney, as I shall hereafter attempt to demonstrate.
Now, sir, whaUvas the plain and obvious reme-
dy? ]>t it be borne in mind, that Congress had
not adjourned a fortnisht before a proclamation
was issued by the President, which probab!y met
members on their way home, summoning them to
attend this extraordinary session—and tor what?
To make provision, as was alleged, for what had
not been deemed necessary for the public service
by th : representatives of the people; that remedy,
;o fore-bly urged by tbeSeciettuy himself, "io ic-
dii'e the expenditures within the ¡imi.s of -met
economy;" in other wn-Js, to carry into p¡,-ctice
hito/,'11 pneepb. This w, s his duty; tins has
bier, the uniform practice of the Gjvenim.cn:; a
practice «hich prudence dictates, and is sancnon-
i d by the soundest principles of economy. Sir, it
.m a good rule, whether applied to individuáis or t->
Government , to limit ¡heir expenditures by their
income; and the individual or the Government
thathabiiuilly departs from it, will in the end b3
involved in p.-cumary embarras ment, if not in
ruin.
But it tnay possibly be said that the §10,339,277
of unexpended balance at the end of the year is a
charge upon the Tieasury, to be paid by ihis Ad-
i-iimstration, -which it is necessary to provide for.
Nominally, it is so; but practically, we know it is
nol; for no administration ever did, or ever can,
(xpend in a single year all the appropriations,
Loth old and new.    And the law, which provides
lhat all appropriations which shall not be 'expend-
ed at th>? end of two years after they shall have
been made shall go to the surplus fund, shows,
beyond all doubt, that they were never expected
to be applied within a single year. But upon
this branch of the subject J am content that his-
tory shall speak. As long ago as the year 1799 the
unexpended balance of appropriations was $10 -
727,146; in 1814, $17,357.923; in 1823, $14 923,-
132; iu 1826, #19,503 019; m 1837, $21,681,273;
and at no time within the last e'ght years has the
unexpended balance of appropriations been less
than $11,000,000. These unexpended balances
have hitherto passed over from one year to an-
other, uniil tie close of the respective administra-
tions; when they have, in like manner, been passed
to that which succeeded. And so it must be at
the close of this, unless the who e practice of the
Government in this particular shall be chang d.
A like balance, Inen, will at the close of this Ad-
ministration go over tó that which shall succeed:
and therefore it is I express the opinion, that while
nominally it may be regarded as a charge upon
this Administration, practically it is not so.
I desire, Mr. Chairman, to present one o'her
vie>y ot  this subject before I proceed to  the ex-
amination of the other statements of the Secretary,
which are submitted in this report.    After correct-
ing the errois to which I have had occasion to al-
lude, it had been shown thai the means for the last
fen mi nth of the year 1841 amount to $22,064,531
Rece.pfs fiom the 1st of January  to
the 4th of March, 1841,  after de-
ducting $500,000 oí Treasury notes
not   redeemed   unlil  after 4th of
March      ....     3,712 540
Making  the whole available means
for 1841    .... $25,777,071
Was this enough f r an economical administra-
tion of ths Government for the >ear 1841? The
late Sscreiary of the Treasury, [Mr. Woodbury,]
in bis last annual report, esiimated the expenditures
for 1841 at $20,000 000. The expéndanles of
18*0, which our opp. nests <-harge to hive benn a
lear of greet extravagance, wee bul $22,389,-
356 With !h"s- facts before us, was it not fair
to i Her Hat $35,777,071 was) enough for the eco-
nomical pui poses oí th-, se who so loudly con-
detnnc"1 whattb"-/ represented to be the extravagant
expem'i'ures of 1840? But upon ihis branch of the
subject we are nor lett either to conjetural estimates,
or to ihe expenditure-sot ihe last year, for data from
which lo draw our conclusions The unbroken
usage of ihe Government for the last quarter of a
century has ¡urnnhed a sare rule for our guidance.
During that period the amount of new and per-
manent appropriations has been regarded as
furnishing the rule for expenditures; and in
no one year during that period have ex-
penditures for ordinary purposes exceeded the
amount of new asd p.-rmsnent appropria-
tions more lhan one million and a half of dol-
lars. They have much more frequently fallen
under than exceeded tnem. What, then, allow me
to inquire, was the amount of new and permanent
appropriations at ihe ¡sst session of Congress, ex-
cluding the Prst Office Department? It was
§17,719,095-, and, rented by this rule, the expendi-
tures snould no nave exceeded $21 500,000 But
wha' does tne Secretary propose 10 expend? Should
Congress autmnize at is present se-sun the new
'appiopnaiiona asised by the War Department, he
proposes in ten months, ot -rom ihe 4th o* March,
1841, io the 1st of January, 1812, to expend for ail
objects $26,731 326; which, atier deducting the
proposed new appropriations, exceeds the estirua'e
of expenditures made by the !a-e Secretary of the
Treasury $4,210,000; exceeds ihe amount of new
and permanent app-opnations for la41, $4,490,-
905; and exceeds the expenditures for 1840, $1,820,-
644 Sir, can a parallel be found for this iu the
history of the Government? Such a parallel will
be sought for in vain.
But that there may be bo escape for the late ad-
ministration from the charge of extravagance, ihe
Secretary has gone imo an examination of the re-
ceipts and expenditures from 1816 toT837—ape-
