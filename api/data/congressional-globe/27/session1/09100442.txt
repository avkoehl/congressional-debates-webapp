APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
July,, 1841:
27th Cong**.-1st Sess.
Public Lands—Mr. Marshall
H. of Reps.
$27,176,000 A4er deducting one fifth for reminded duties
drawbacks, «fee we have s lit left near $22,000 000 nett income
fiom foreign importations A'ter making still further allow
anee for those cases of exception above alluded to, where
I would be willing to depart from the strict rule of unifor
mityof duty, we have left more than twenty millions of dol-
lars annually, enough for an economical administration of
this Government in time of peace To time of war, when
the public safety supersedes- every other consideration,
there is not a State in this Union that would not willingly
surrender all claims to the , proceeds of these land*, for
the purpose of defraying us expense At all events, they
would have to contribute to the support of such war, and is
it not reasonable to suppose they would prefer the lands
should be so applied, rathei than submit to a heavy direct
taxation!
By no means will í agree that the luxuries of life shall be im-
ported free of duty, whilst the necessaries are taxed 20 per
Cent—aswJli be the case under the opeiatienof the present
tariff From a report made to the Senate by the late Secretary
of the Treasury, [Mi Woodbury ] dated January 18, 1841, it
appears that thei e were consumed during the year 1838 ^l'ks,
worsted stuffs,, and linens to the amount of ©14,000 000, which
were imported du y free These, ata duty of 20 percent
would yield a íevenue of 02 8(0,000 ]t furtler appeals, irom
a statement prepared at the Treasuiy Department, quoted by
the gentleman from Maine, that, during the year 1810, there
were imported wmes to the amount oí $2,209 17G— paying, ac
cording to the present rate of duties but $196 073 79—wl ereas
ata duty of 20 per cent they wouldhave yielded $441 835 20
The revenue that would thus arise on silks, worsteds, and linens
now imported free, and wines now paying le-s than 20 per cent
would amount to more than three millions annually enough
to compensate for the income abstracted from the sales of the
public lands
From the report of the Secretary of the Treasury of 10th
July, 1841, Jt appears that, since the piesent cash system went
into operation m 1320, the average income* arising from the
sale of the public lands has amounted to moro than $4 000 000
annually After deducting the ten per cent allowed to the
new States and the expenses of survey and sa'e. there will
remain at least $3,C00 000 annually to be divided ¡among the
States t
Letthissumbe annually distributed among the State", and
what immense means are put at then command towards im>
piovjng their internal condition, strengthening themselves,
the better to repel foreign invasion, increasing their wealth
and domestic comfort, developing their moral social, and in
tellectual condition, re^lun g their s lat ered and decaying
credit in the markets of Europe Ihey will lie enab ed to open
all their avenues of trade and commeice, by which th°ir phv^i
cal resources will he developed, and the labor of their industry
rewarded You will enable each one of them to forsealmk
in the great chain of commercial interest which will iorever
bind this Union together You will cnab e them to scatter
the blessings of education throughout their border, to send
1 the schoolmaster ahtoad" to die door of every cottage, and
to bring to the service of hi* country many an indigent youth
that might otherwise have pas-ed through life unknowing and
unknown You will enable them to lay open o the 1 git of
('ay many a nch mine of know eJge that might othrrwise
remain forever concealed beneath the depths of ignoiarce and
vice You will enab'e each c?tate to establish a rñoiaí garden
within its limits for the cultivation of many a mental flower
that might otherwise "wa«te its sweetness on the desert air '
Those fe> ates that arein debt will bo enabled to relieve tneir
citizens from the burdens of taxa ion, and to consummate
those splendid efforts of domestic improvement tha have beei
impeded by the pressure of the times Tney will be enabled
to regainthtir pirtially jost ciedit abroad, to restore i he cied t

Can the mind dwell upon a more sublime spectacle than that of

great principles of Anglo American oiviluation are not tobe

this resistless current will continue to roll on till it shall sweep
over this Western World, from Greenland to Cape Horn And
it will not stop even here It will still go Westward—it will sub

vast Pacific, it wnl ul imately reach the shores of Japan and
China, it wiil ascend the steppes of the Himmaleh aid Cauca

whence it sprang, to reueem Us parent soil from the gra^p of

SPEECH OF MR. MARSHALL,
OF KENTUCKY
In ike Housfi of Repi esrntaUves, July 6,1841 —On the bill to
appropriate the proceeds of the sa'es of the public 'and1* and
tograny-pre emi tionrights bemgunderconsidprationin Com
i    mitteepüf the Whole upon the ¡state of the Union, after Mr
*   Rayjter of North Caí olma had closed
MryMAR&H ALL of Kentucky obtained the floor at half past

*-itr Chan nan, I would apologize for entering upon the dis
cussion of this question at this hour, and would, muteover,
pledge mj self to brevity, but that, m examining the speeches
ma le upon this floor, I have uniformly ooser ¿ed ¡hat the longest
of them have been preceded by such apologies and promises I
shall therefore proceed, without preface or exordium, to state
the answer to the more important objections mged so eloquently
against the bill ye& eriay by the distmguishel gentleman horn
Vit^itiia [Mr Wisb ] diidin a very gereral mannei the lea hrg
principles; upon whit nt iepo=e=: for support m the ju hjrnert
of is friends I gave ar attentive eai to (he gentleman fiom
Virg ma thtough the entile space of ihiee hours and a ha'f I
1 atened to him (I had a'mos^ said with pleasuie) at ¡eas w th
an interest albeit a painful one so absorbing as to de^'roy all
consciousness of the 'ength of time consumed by his speech
The gen leman piemised that he had, on a former occasion,
fully d acussed the pr qci >le of the bill and that, lor the present
he would confine himself to the objections which exis ed in his
min 1 to the detail, ytr, when once tmbarked on thisgreat mta
suie, he found u impoosible to confine himself withm the hints
prescribed Borne away by theimpetuoeity of his own genius
he direUed hs fiie at the who e measure, principle and detail
origin, piogtess, and ultimate ePec he struck at it, root and
biaich, he iakea it from s em to stem—hull, ma¡.ts, and rig
gin* Sucn was the power of the gentleman's declamation ai d
suco is the influence of genius, even in ¡ts errors that I found
my pieconcened, and, as Í thought, well &eukd ideas not only
m relation to this bill, but as to the nature of this Government
and the rHati *ns of the several parta of our r^pjhhcan em ire

enveloped in the pno'ie from h sartillery, that it wis not til! I

These are the chief p-ovi ions whioh encountered the ser 'e
man's denunciator and mvecti /e To the right of pre emp ion
granted to ¡sellers under certain conditions, he yvas understood
to make no particular ejection
The een^eman from Virs ma !ees consolidation m every
thing The sovereignty of trie Sta es is threatened by thi-j Go
vernlnentn every mode of its ac ion 1 here is consolidation
m debí, theie is conool dation in surplus, there is consolidation
in disu-ibu ion Tinder this bill he detects the assumption of
State debts, internal impiovement, anda protect've tariff, he
treats it as in facta distribution of the custom , and adeckra
tion of war upon the part of free labor against slave labor Sir,
m what sense can the a stnbution of the proceeds of the public
Und«> be considered as an assumption of the State debts by this
Go7ernment'1 I understand by the assumption of the State
dehts their consolidation into one, to be discharged out of the
national funds raised by equal taxation The S ates which
like North Carolina, owe nothms, or whose 'ebts like tbo^e of
Kentucky, are comparatively small, wouid be taxed, not in
proportion to their debts, but in proporuor to their population
to pay off a debt contracted without tnetr authon y, ana
bearing no proportion, m the several element of which it is
composed to the amounts to be paid by the several Sta es for
its extinction That a community shall be taxed to pay a
aebt contracted without us authorry, is, m fact, taxation with
out representation Practically, i were better, safer, more
free, that the Legislature of Pennsylvania should have the
power of laying an equal tax upon the whole I monto pay
a debt contracted by the general authority, then that she
ahould have the separate power to contract the debt, leaving
Congress to impose the geneial tax Thewardebtof the
States at the close of the Revolution is very clearly and easily
distinguish ble from the present internal improvement debt
The war debt was really the debt of the Union, and although
contracted by the States separately, it was for the Ubei ty and
independence of the whole It was for the common goed, and
should have been diftChatged from the common funds     Inge
nuity itself cannot liken the distnbuuon of national property
among the sevei 1 States, upon a nrtnciple strictly of Federal
equality, the basis both of representauon and taxation, to the
cí n^uhdatinn and assumption of unequal debts contracted by
3ta*c authority alone, to be paid out oi national funds raised by
equal taxation
It is further con en ed, stienuously an 1 with an air of most
triumphant confidence, that this is in fact, a distnhu nnofthe
customs, that the Gererai Government piopu esto jevy taxes
merely for the purpose of distribution Th^, genuerran from
Virginia, treating the Government as trustee of two separate
funds, files his hill inequity for an account between the eustoms
and the public lands He sits as master coriroir-sim^r, ard
finds that the whole expense of the admimsuation of the public
domain exceeds the whole ieceipt<? into the Treasury from ihe
sales, and decrees that the lands must be charged with this
difference, and that it must be reimbursed before there is any
thing to distribute I object to this mode of settlement lhat
the expen&es of the sale3 ¡ nd admmis ration have exceeded the
receipts from the pubhclands may well be contested Waiving,
however, any dispute as to the fact, and admitting n to b* as
-tated, nay, charging them with every thing, the purchase mo
ney paid for part, the Indian wais—every thing I say—and
credit them with nothing by receipts fiom the sales, suppose
them given awayto those who have settled them, ami political
arithmetic still discloses a balance ^careelysusreptib'e of nu
mencal statement in favor of the lands against the customs
When the General Government grants its lands, although it is
in fee, she reserves the right to tax, throush her custom house ,
the consumption by the grantee of all articles of foreign growth
or ma^ufaciuie
Suppose the vast domain comprehending the new States
unsettled and unsold Strike out both receipt and expenditure,
huil back, if imagination be capable of such an achievement—
huil back Ohio,Indiana, Illinois, into their primeval yet recent
wilderness, and what bt-comes of all the revenue through the
custom houses drawn from the enormous consumption of these
States'* I speak of revenue already received and expended,
saying nothing of what is to arise through all coming time
In estimating^the receipts of the General Government from
the public lands it is a most narrow mor'e of calculation to
limit the revenue drawn fiom this source to the one dollar
and one quarter per acr  paid by the grantee It is after the
sale and settlement that revenue begins The Government
might indeed, ha\e se tied the land by donee«, and still have
eMdohshed heieby a fund of ciedit upon which the customs
might have diawn without limit ai d for ever
This is a question of imperial policy and imperial ¿quitv,
and must be settled upon other and more enlarged principles
rhan govern such a suit m chanceiy a-^ the gentle nan from
Virginia has i stituted Ciedit the pub ic land-  by all then
coun less tenantry ha\ e paid into the coffeis of the State, and
the balance vsould be feaiful agam&t the custom* But we
not only do not cía m this fiom the lands already soM, but we
have «urreuiered it, thiough the Constitution, to the United
States, overall the eight hundred million  of acres >et remain
ing to be sold Distubute the pr t,e paid for the land among
the states heiearter, and still as they se tie and new members
of the C mfederacy spring into existence the Geneiai Govern
ment leserves to itself the exc u«ive pos-e=cio i (f the most
fruí ful souice of revenue throush the dut es, a source widen
ing deepening Decerning more copious and exuberant with the
piogie^ of settlement and d s ribmion
Mi Cham ¿n the fund proposed tobe distributed is no more
iai«ed by taxation than it is indebted to the customs The re
venue raided from the sale of the public land  is not a tax, it is
distinct, eternally disiit ct, in its nature and its origin, from the
revenue raided by duties or m any othei way
The money which the Government r-'ceivea from il e grantee
of a section of land h for a con UTation of man v time3 the value
paid Iht, r<in vvho gives ore doUai iiiid one quartei foran
acrp of land wh ch, by the app ication of amodeiate oegrec of
hsowniaber and the íapidgtowth of socie y around, must
soon be \ orth .wentv, thirty, in many instances one hunched
times that sum can scarcely be persuade i that i e is paying a
tax The proceeds of the sale of *he pnb'ic lands then, com
pared wi h ' e a tual %aiue of d esrant made the thng trans
feired, more nearly iecem! le adoration than a tax It differs
from the cu^tom^ a  much in its onsr n a« m it*  n iture The
gentleman frcm Mary and ¡"Mr Johnson] ha= eaved a 1 who
come after him m this debate any tiouble m ihe investiga
tion of this bianch of the subject lie has naced the title to
the public domain back to the several depd^of cesión from the
S-ates—deeds executed beiore the adoption of the Federal Con
stitu ion, and has snown that the rights both gi anted and re«erv
ed in the n reman unaffecicd by that instrument The war of
the Revolution was a common cause Itvvasheli at its close
that the vast umettieu territory wnhm the chartered limite of
the s verAi States, havn g been rent from the Ciown ofEng
land hy the joint exertion , b'ood, and tiea^ure of all heColo
nie^, did m equity become thereby the com men property of
the whole 'io avoid all terntona disputes an^l theintermma
ble difficulty of a division of the lands themselves among
States situated so widely apart, and many of them so remote
from the territory to be divided, it was determined m the mag
nammous spirit of that immortal age to cede he unsettled and
almost boundless wiidernes* to the common Government, for
the * use and benefit of such of the United States as shall be
come members of the Federal alliance of the said States and
for no other use or ] urpose whatsoever," Such is the uniform
lan"uage ol the dgpds of cessi >n In the preamble to the statute
of New York authimmg the cesión it is said ' That the
waste and uncultivated territory within the limits or claims of
certa n Ma tes ou^ht to be appropriated as a common fund for
the expenses of the war "
Thus was the Government of the United States inves ed, le
gaily, formally, and by deed, with the title, as trustee for the ee
veral States comrosing or who should ihereafter compose, the
Confederacy, and charged with the expenses of the war The
deeds are etrictlv and technically deedsof tiust They are not
grants of political power, but conveyances of landed property
charged with specific dehts, and for the use and benefit of spe
cified communities, clear, precise, technical A trust estate,
in land, differs as much irom the sovereign pswer to lay ana
collect taxes, duties, imposts, <fer astherevenue reeeiveafrom
the sale of land does from that collected by a duty upon the im
portación of a cask of wine But I will press this view no fur
ther I will pass by the legal and strict right of the States to
this fund, incontestable as the gentleman from Maryland has
shown Uto be, and consider it as a great practical question
beaungupon the present condition of the people of the United
