Excess of expcndituies over means 1st July,
1846 f $18,560,826 52
This excess is based on the assumption that the
whole amount of five millions is outstanding of
treasury notes authorized by the act of 22d July,
1S46, under a renewed authority now requested to
be conferred by Congress to issue the same; but
as the whole amount cannot be outstanding at the
same time, on account of the number of notes can-
celled befoie a new note is issued, the excess of
expenditures over means, on the 1st of July, 1848,
should be estimated at nineteen millions of dollars,
which will cover all expenditures, including that of
the war, if continued up to that date.
It is important at all times, as shown by uni-
form experience, but especially in a period of war,
to keep a balance of at least four millions of dollars
in the treasury, in order to supply the mint and
branch mints with bullion for coinage, and foreign
coin for recoinage, as also to be enabled at all
times to pay the public creditors at every point,
buth in and out of the country, with punctuality
and despatch. Although, then, th  actual deficit
on the 30th of June, 1848, might not exceed nine-
teen millions of dollars, the necessity of having a
surplus of four millions in the treasury at all times
requires that a loan of twenty-three millions should
be authorized, unless additional revenue is raised
by some new provision of law. As one of the
means of augmenting the revenue, it is proposed
that Congress shall authorize a duty of twenty-five
per cent, on tea and codec, which it is estimated
would reduce the loan required to nineteen millions
of dollars.
Annexed (marked C) is a table of the imports
of tea consumed in the United Slates, and also of
coffee, from 1821 to 1846. It will be perceived
that the imports of tea, being 16,891,020 pounds,
consumed in the United States for the last fiscal
year, amounted to the value of 03,983,337; and of
coffee, being 124,336,054 pounds, being of the
value of §7,802,894, making an aggregate of $11,-
786,23J,—a duty of twenty-five per cent, on which
would yield an annual revenue of $2,946,557 75.
After making a full allowance for decreased con-
sumption on account of the duties, the additional
annual revenue from this source might be safely
estimated at $2,500,000.
This duty, however, would be rendered nuga-
tory, in part, for several years, unless it were
imposed during a very early period of the session,
and to go into effect at a time not later, if possible,
than the 1st of January next. Between that date
and some time early in the spring, large importa-
tions of tea, and to some extent of coffee, are
-'The sum of $">54,000 for supplying deficiency in revenue
from postages, &275,d00 for postages of Congress and Exec-
. utive officers, and $117,750 ol" the debt assumed by the
United States for the cities of the District of Columbia, are
in the above sum,
brought into the country, and ought to be subject-
ed to the duty, in order that the revenue should be
raised from such imports. If this is nofdone, and
the duty is to go into operation at a much later
period, the tax will operate as an enhanced price
to the consumer, without producing a correspond-
ent revenue. The stock now on hand, and that
would be imported forthwith—namely, of coffee
from Cuba and St. Domingo, and some other ports,
and of tea in part from the bonded warehouses of
Europe—coming in free of duty in anticipation of
the law, would contribute nothing to the revenue
of the country, whilst the price of the stock on
hand here, as well as that thus brought in free of
duty, would be augmented nearly in the same pro-
portion as if the duty had actually gone at once
into effect. A delay, then, in imposing this duty
on tea and coffee, whilst it would tax the consumer
for several years nearly as much as if the duty
were imposed at once, would, during that whole
period, bring very little revenue into the treasury.
Such a delay, then, would only enable a few indi-
viduals to amass large fortunes at the expense of
the people. Such has been the almost uniform
effect of the postponement of the operation of laws
imposing new or additional duties, of which the
examples are numerous under the tariff of 1842,
as also preceding laws. The reduction of the loan
from twenty-three to nineteen millions, together
with the imposition of this duty on tea and coffee
towards meeting the payment, will, it is conceived,
make a difference in the terms on which the loan
can be effected, which, in the period _of twenty
years, would save a large amount of the tax to the
people of the United States; whereas, if no such
duty is imposed, and, as a consequence, a loan for
a sum so large as twenty-three millions, without
this additional revenue, must be made during a
period of war, uncertain in its duration, and at-
tended with heavy expenditures, judging of the
future by the past, the Government may be sub-
jected to a serious loss in negotiating the loan, or
involved in embarrassments alike injurious to the
credit and honor of the country.
In negotiating for so large a sum as nineteen or
twenty-three millions in time of war, with heavy
expenditures, unacrtain m their duiation, all ex-
perience, at home and abroad, proves that a loan
for a long term will save a large amount to the
treasury, compared with one of shorter date; and
it is believed that in this case the loan should be
for a period of twenty years, reserving the power,
conferred by existing laws, to purchase the stock
at the market price at any prior date, when our
means may permit, so that the debt may be extin-
guished as soon as possible, and long before its
maturity, if practicable. In this way, under ordi-
nary circumstances, the advantages of a long and
short loan are, to some extent, combined. The
first half of the loan should, it is thought, be nego-
tiated early in the spring, payments being required
only as the money may be needed; and the re-
mainder, if wanted, should be negotiated some
time during the succeeding summer or fall, pay-
ments only to be made also in this case as the
money may be required, so that no larger sum
may be borrowed, m any event, than may be de-
manded by the wants of the Government.
In compliance with the proviso of the first sec-
tion of the act of the tenth of August last, a full
statement is herewith communicated (marked D)
of all treasury notes paid under the provisions of
that act, amounting on the first of this month, to
|17,446 31.
Table E, hereto annexed, shows the payments
made since the 4th of March, 1845, of the princi-
pal and interest of the public debt up to the first of
the present month. The amount of principal thus
paid was §1,680,605 02, and of interest $1,528,-
042 62; making an aggregate of public debt paid
since the 4th of March, 1845, of §3,208,647 64, of
which (except the sum of $513,600) the whole
amount consisted of debt, or interest^upon debt,
incurred before the 4th of March, 1845.
Statement P, hereto annexed, shows the amount
of treasury notes issued under the provisions of the
act of the twenty-sccond of July last, being a total
of $3,853,100; of which the amount of $1,766,450
bore an interest of one mill per cent, on every hun-
dred dollars, and $2,086,650 an interest of five and
two-fifths per cent, per annum.
In the same statement will be found the amount
paid into the treasury on account of the live mil-
lion loan, which, in pursuance of the public notice
hereto annexed, (marked FF,) was negotiated at
six per cent, interest, under tire act of the twenty-
second July last, either at par, or, as was- the case
for a small portion, above par. The sum paid and
entered on the books of the Register of the Treasu-
ry was, on the first of December last, $3,461,600.
The payments are still progressing, the stock bear-
ing interest only from the date of the actual deposite
of the money in the treasury.
In the same table will be found a statement of
the public debt of every description, principal and
interest, due by the United States, including loans,
treasury notes, &c., amounting, on the first of De-
cember last, to $24,256,494 60; of which $17,788,-
799 62 was contracted before the fourth of March,
1845; leaving the whole debt incurred since that
date $6,467,694 98, embracing §320,000 of the
Mexican treaty indemnity debt assumed by Con-
gress at its last session.
At the date of the repeal of the tariff of 1842 the
revenue was declining. The receipts under it into
the treasury were less by the sum of §815,444 83
during the last fiscal year, terminating on the 30th
June, 1846, than the receipts during the fiscal year
ending on the 30th June, 1845. That this decline
was progressive, and arose from the prohibitory
character of the specific duties, is proved by the
table hereto annexed, (marked G,) from which it
appears that, for the'fiscal year ending 30th June,
1844, the excess of revenue produced by specific
over ad valorem duties was $81,860 74; whereas,
during the fiscal year Ending 30th June, 1845, the
ad valorem exceeded the specific daties $1,737,-
379 57, and during the last fiscal year the ad va
lorem exceeded the specific duties $2,663,534 94
As the specific duties, in their practical operation,
were becoming every day more prohibitory, the
revenue under the tnuff of 1842 must have con-
tinued to sink so rapidly as soon to have caused a
great deficit, even in time of peace, and thus have
required ultimately a resort to direct taxes or ex-
cises to support the Government.
The duties collected at the ports of Baltimore,
Philadelphia, and New York, during the fiist five
days of December, 1846, under the new tariff,
amount to §416,802"97; and, during the first five
days of December, 1845, under the old taiilf, to
$208,374 50. This rate of augmentation it is not
supposed will continue; but that the revenue from
duties this year will reach the amount' estimated
now, and in my report to the Senate of the 16th of
July last, at $27,835,731, is, for the reasons there-
in stated, fully believed.
Herewith are transmitted the regulations (mark-
ed H) adopted by this department in obedience to
the provisions of the law of the 6th of August last,
establishing the constitutional treasury. It will be
perceived, by reference to these instructions, that
this department has proceeded to carry into full
effect the intentions of Congress in the enactment
of this law, and the rules established in relation to
treasuiy drafts have rendered it impossible that
they can ever be converted into a circulating me-
dium. The bill, however, is defective in some of
its details. No appropriation is made by the law
for the payment of the salaries of the assistant
treasurers, or the additional salaries of the treas-
urers of the mint, nor for the compensation of the
examining agents authorized by the law, and
whose services are so necessary under its provis-
ions for the security of the public money. The
provision for incidental expenses is wholly inade-
quate. The number of clerks, also, is insufficient
to transact the public business under the provisions
of this law, and, it is thought, ought to be aug-
mented from ten to twenty—more than five times
the latter number having been required to transact
the same business when these moneys were kept,
transferred, and disbursed by the banks. No ade-
quate security is provided by law for the safety
of the public money in the hands of disbursing
agents; and whilst transfers are required to be
made from.place to place of specie, no appropria-
tion is made by this law to oay the expenses of
these transfers, or to enable disbursing agents to
pay the public creditors at all times and places
with punctuality and despatch. The powers of
this department in relation to that portion of the
public moneys which must be paid on the other
side of the Atlantic, or in any foreign country,
