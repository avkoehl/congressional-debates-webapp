Captain WARWICK,

Aide-de-Camp:

Your telegram received. My portion of the Sumter garrison consists entirely of Georgians, who I hear wish of remain. I can, however, send part of the Twelfth Georgia to take their places, and bring the men now in Sumter to Haskell in place of Twelfth. I have no men to spare except in this way. Will this be satisfactory?

Brigadier-General.
