Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS MILITARY DISTRICT OF FLORIDA,Camp Milton, April 13, 1864.

Colonel R. H. ANDERSON,

Commanding Cavalry:

COLONEL: From certain facts that have been reported to the major-general commanding he is inclined to think that the scout at the mouth of the Saint John's River has been captured by the enemy.

He deems it particularly important to ascertain whether the troops reported by the Saddler's Point scout as going down the river have gone out or not, and desires that you will take immediate measures to learn the condition of things near the mouth of the river, what has become of the scout, and whether the troops referred to have left the river or landed at some point below.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WM. G. BARTH,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WM. G. BARTH,
