posted on the left of his present line. All the reserve regiments of the Third Division, under command of the senior officer, will be posted in the entrenchments near the Williams house, connecting with General Gibbon's division. The reserve brigade of the First Division will be placed on the left of the brigade of the Third Division, extending the line toward the plank road. The working party on the redoubts, it is understood, will be relieved to-morrow morning.

By order of Major-General Hancock:

FRANCIS A. WALKER,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIRST DIVISION, SECOND CORPS,July 9, 1864-11.40 p.m. (Received 11.50.)

Lieutenant-Colonel WALKER,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

COLONEL: General Miles has 1,643 muskets; 500 of this number are on the working party, and some 150 on our picket, making 650, and leaving only, say 1,000 here for duty. We cannot, therefore, wholly relieve the Sixth Corps picket of 1,400 men. We will relieve as much of the Sixth Corps line as possible, but shall have nothing left for the rifle-pits.

Respectfully,

FRANCIS C. BARLOW,

Brigadier-general, Commanding Division.

P. S.-General Miles is the only reserve on second line of this division.

FRANCIS C. BARLOW,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIRST DIVISION, SECOND ARMY CORPS,July 9, 1864.

Brigadier General N. A. MILES,

Commanding First Brigade:

GENERAL: I am directed by the brigadier-general commanding the division to say that it is probable that you brigade will be ordered to-night to take the position occupied a few days since when the Sixth Corps moved to Reams' Station. It is not known whether or not the details now on fatigue duty will be relieved.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WM. R. DRIVER,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND DIVISION, SECOND ARMY CORPS,July 9, 1864-11.30 p.m.

Lieutenant-Colonel WALKER,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Second Corps:

COLONEL: I take it for granted that the Sixth Corps pickets remain on the line to the left of my picket-line. If this is not so and I am expected to relieve any of them, please let me know.

Respectfully,

JOHN GIBBON,

Major-General of Volunteers, Commanding Division.
