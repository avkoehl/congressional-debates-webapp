Brigadier-General TOWNSEND,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

A report of the operation you refer to in your telegram of yesterday will be forwarded by mail to-day. Most of the men captured have come in. This party was stampeded, and the whole affair badly managed. Numerous combats have taken place between the guerrillas and scouting parties from this command during the last two months, and usually with success. About 150 guerrillas have been captured or killed. I have not reported these affair. They are generally conducted after dark, and this was the order in the present case.
