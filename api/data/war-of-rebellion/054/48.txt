BRIDGEPORT, October 26, 1863.

Major-General REYNOLDS:

Two citizens from Lookout Mountain report that there is no enemy except near the foot of it, near Chattanooga. Some prisoners were repairing roads leading toward Nickjack Gap, about 3 miles south of Summertown. Stevens', and Cooper's Gaps held by small parties, not exceeding 200 in all, and a small force of cavalry. At Trenton, they say that 8,000 cavalry, under S. D. Lee, joined Wheeler at Muscle Shoals, with a view to strike our communications. If successful, Bragg intends to turn our right by roads below this point. If that expedition failed he should fall back nearer supplies. Bragg said to Jeff. Davis that it would take 10,000 lives to carry Chattanooga by storm. Davis objected to the sacrifice. There are rumors that a part of Longstreet's force have been withdrawn to La Fayette.
