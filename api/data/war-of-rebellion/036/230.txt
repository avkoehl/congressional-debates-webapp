Bay, capturing over 1,000 prisoners, ten heavy guns, and a large amount of stores of al descriptions. The position of Thibodeaux was also carried. This gives him the command of the Mississippi River above New Orleans, and will enable him in a great measure to cut off Banks' supplies.

Vicksburg capitulated on the 4th instant; the garrison was paroled and are to be returned to our lines, the officers retaining their side-arms and personal baggage. This intelligence was brought by an officer who left the place on Sunday, the 5th instant. In consequence, I am falling back from the Big Black to Jackson.

Colonel [L. M.] Montgomery has just arrived from Vicksburg. He was directed by General Pemberton to have supplies prepared at this place for 22,000 men, the paroled garrison of Vicksburg.

General S. COOPER:

The paroled garrison of Vicksburg will be here in a few days. What shall be done with the men? They cannot remain in this department without great injury to us from deficiency of supplying them. Shall they go to their homes until exchanged, or be distributed in regiments in their respective States? Can they be exchanged immediately for prisoners taken in the recent great Confederate victory?

Inform fully as you know of the terms of capitulation of Vicksburg, especially the position of officers and men in relation to parole and power of exchange.
