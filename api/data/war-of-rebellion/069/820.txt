HANCOCK'S HOUSE, May 21, 1864-7.30 [a. m.]

(Via Chester.)

General S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General:

All quiet last night. We remain in possession of enemy's rifle-pits and ground gained by yesterday's fight, which was quite severe during part of the day, especially near Ware Bottom Church. I regret to say General W. S. Walker is missing. It is feared he fell into the hands of the enemy whilst gallantly leading his troops into action. Will ascertain his fate immediately.

G. T. BEAUREGARD.

RICHMOND, VA., May 21, 1864.

General BEAUREGARD,

Chester, Va.:

Special orders to you of April 22 and May 19 directed Baker's regiment of cavalry to move north of James River by this city. The President desires to know why the regiment has not been sent as directed. Great embarrassment has resulted for want of it.

S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General.

General S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General:

By telegram of the 25th April from General Bragg, I was authorized to detain Baker's cavalry until expedition against New Berne was completed. His whole regiment has not yet arrived here. So soon as the remainder arrives from Petersburg, and it can be relieved by one of Dearing's regiments, it will be ordered forward. Orders for the ramainder of it to be sent forward from Petersburg have already been issued. Special orders of the 19th May not yet received.

G. T. BEAUREGARD,

General.

Excepting severe artillery fire from enemy on our new lines, all remains quiet. Order relative to Gracie's brigade is being carried out. General B. R. Johnson already commands a division. He highly distinguished himself at the battle of Drewry's Bluff.
