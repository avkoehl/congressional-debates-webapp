COMMANDING OFFICER IN CHARGE OF STEAM-BOAT DOVE, Jacksonport, Ark.:

SIR: The colonel commanding directs me to inform you that our train, consisting of thirty-five wagons, was captured by the enemy two days ago, and that owing to lack of transportation and long distance we have to travel to obtain forage for the command it is not possible for him to send teams to transport the goods now on the boat. It requires all our limited transportation to supply forage for the command, and nearly all the troops to guard the transportation.

I remain, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,H. C. FILLEBROWN,
