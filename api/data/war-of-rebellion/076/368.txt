WASHINGTON, August 5, 1864--10.15 a. m.

Major-General SHERMAN,

Near Atlanta, Ga.:

Your request about horses from Saint Louis has been anticipated. Instead of 2,000 on hand, they will not be able to send you 1,000 in less than a week. The country is nearly exhausted of cavalry horses, and unless there is a greater economy in their use the men must very soon go afoot.

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, near Atlanta, Ga., August 5, 1864.

Governor ANDREW JOHNSON,

Nashville, Tenn.:

We will now need the exclusive use of the railroad from the Tennessee to Nashville, to be operated by the same parties who now operate the Chattanooga. Cars will load at Reynoldsburg and come to our camp. I will instruct General Webster to make all the orders necessary to make the transfer. If the road and fixtures are incomplete, we will take it as it is and make the best use we can of it.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, near Atlanta, Ga., August 5, 1864.

General WEBSTER,

Nashville:

See Governor Johnson and arrange for transferring the railroad to the Tennessee, from Reynoldsburg to Nashville, to Mr. Anderson, superintendent of road, that he may use his trains from Reynoldsburg to our camp at Atlanta. Notify Colonel Donaldson to use that road hereafter, and to make temporary sheds at the river. Telegraph to Admiral Porter as to patrolling the river up as far as Reynoldsburg, and see General Rousseau as to guarding it to Nashville. Make all arrangements that the route may be entire and complete under one single management. When the Cumberland River rises so as to be available it may again, so far as I am concerned, go back to the management of Governor Johnson. I will telegraph the Secretary of War as to the necessity of this change.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
