Captain EDWARDS,

New Madrid:

It is rumored that a force is moving up from Jacksonport. Keep out all the available cavalry you have and patrol all the main approaches from Arkansas, and suffer no force to approach east of Little River without your knowledge. If you find there is no force on the east side of Little River send your force toward Clarkton. Be cautious and vigilant.
