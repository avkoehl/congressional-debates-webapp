"The Senate adjourned sine die "
The Senat*  had no right to sit and appropriate money, or
take any other action tn a legislative capacity, but they never
thefess did so, and it was an act which he (Mr A llsn) should
ever consider to be a violation of their constitutional poweie
—a violation of the Constitution itself He tememheted ta
king the ground that a joint committee of both Houses was re
quiaiteto report a resolution ol that descnption, and that there
was then no joint committee in existence Betides, the rule
requiredthat the repoit of the joint committee shou d be en
tered upon the journals, but who was there to writer any such
report at that tim*? The Government, bo far as legislation was
concerned, was suspended Congress had been teirmnated by
the adjournment of the House of Representatives szne die, four
Hours previously At 4 o'clock in the morning the resolution
was taken to the President for hj<? signature, and, owing to (he
haste with which it was despatched for the President's signa
ture, the Secretary ef the Senate had forgotten to ceitiiy its
passage upon the back of the rcso'uiion Th& President
found that it was not certified, and took no further notice of
it, but very mildly rebuked the delegation who had brought
the document at ao unseasonable an ho ui bysayine, \ou havt,
done your duty, gentlemen and I will do mine to murruw," and
turned over m his bed
He CMr Allen) d d not mean, by any thing he now said, to
impute blame to any person wnatever, but to show the in
Justice of ibe proceeding which had been adopted on that oua
sion And he mu^t be peimitted to say, as a membei of this
representative body, that it was* mamiestfy improper and un
becoming for them to contaminate their hands with any little
petty larceny tiansactionJike that Let them stand upon their
salaries like men, oi else resign If they were unwilling to
serve their constituents for the salary which the law provides,
they should retire Itdid not become men who were sent there
not only to represent (he intere  s, but to manual i the giory
and honor of the nation, to contaminate their hands with little
pilferwgs He (Mi Allen) would far rather serve for nothing,
than be even supposed to be capable ofputicipating in a pro
ceedmgso utterly unbecoming liut this was an abuse, winch,
like mostockeis, had^rown up tnrongh inattention, and m con

There wasaveiyjust difference between acting in anindmd
ual capacity and asa membei of a body in the lattei case,
the individual is íelieved from all that responsibility which, as
an individual, he would be subject to Lach individual mem-
ber quiets his conscience by saying "it is the will of the Sen
ate," although hit, own individual will helped to make up that
will of the Senate, and he thus holds up thedecismr oí the Sen
ate as his protection from the impending indigna ion of his
constituency
The very fact that gentlemen are acting in a representative
capacity, enabled them olten to do that which they would not
otherwise feel at 1 berty to do    He did hope, however tuat the
Senator who had the special care of this bill would recon ider
this mattei, and lemove the objectionable clause, and not insist
upon running through an appropriation bill m this ba^ty man
ner, granting S10,00ÍJ,000oí the peoples money, and thereby
creating a necessity ior taxation    He muat i<-membei thdtap

the peoples money, without eves thiee days' consideration?
Matters of taxation weie sti ctly guarded by the Constitution,
and appropriation was strictly euaided by t\*> rules of this
body    Eveiy one who had an idea at all, must know that
all the othet powers of Gov inment were utteily banen, save
as they grew out of, and were nurtuied and continued in

money drawn fiom the people which enabled them to usurp

the money with vigilant o ire, for that one power is the
anchorage of the nlioe system     While the money power
is wielded with firmness and n odeiation, th*1 Government

a thousand purposes, and the rule declares that eveiy item
of appioprration shall be considered and discussed m Com
mitteeof the Whole on the state of the Union,- and we are
told that the bill must be adopted at once, and without per-
mitting the smallest examination Month a/ter month had
been spent in discussions of the bankrupt law, an.d other
subjects of an unimportant nature, and they were now called
upon to pass a bill voting away $10 000,000 without examina-
tion, because the clerks m the various departments were m
want of their salaries And they were about to pass important
items without any examination on the part of the departments,
orof a committee of this House, or the Houseitself, but resting
entirely upon the estimates of subordinate officers There
shouM, in his (Mr A Js) opinion, be a radical change in the
mode of passing these appropriations, and he believed that
one halftheexpent.es of Government might besaved Instead
ef taking the estimate of an interested individual, a cumpe
tent person should be assigned for that duty, who could have
no personal interest one way or the other This body being
the faithest removed fiom the starting point wheie the esu
mates were made, were more in the dark than the departments;
and the departments themselves were kept involved in darkness
so impenetrable, that whether their recommendations were right
or wrong could be known only to themst Ives—if, indeed, they
were known even to themselves It was a curiosity to look
through the history of these matters, as conducted by the an
cient republics while they weie pure It would be found that
nine tenths of the impeachments of public oflieeie which took
place were instituted in consequent of the improper expendi-
ture of public money The Greeks, who cained the cultiva*
tion of the human mind toa higher pitch than it ever attained
before, or peihaps would again—the Greeks well undeistood
where the principal nerve of the Government lay, and there
foie ltwwe find, in perusing their history, that, until they fell
under the Macedonian power, minister alter minister was im
peached on account oí the pei version of the public funds

out each nidividudl item of expéndame and explain Us neces
sny In the i ature of this Government, howevti, tins could
not be practised, nor was it necessary, but it was essentially
necessary that they should be stuctly examined
He had been induced to depart from the consideration of the
particular  item under discu=sion, to admonish the Senator    '
who hadthechaieeof this measure, nnt to pte=?s the appropn
anon bill with such hot haste upon the consideration of the Sen
ate    Money bills, of all others, should leceive a careful consid-
eration, because upon them all tht functions of Government   '
turn     I hey should be discussed with the utmost caution, and
the members of both Houses should divest themselves of all
contamination, and notstibject themselves to the charge of be-
ing actuated by unworthy motives    TiVre was something so
utterly unworthy in the idea of legislators, claiming to be wor     I
thy the confidence of afree people, passing measures calculated   '
to enuie to their own benefit, that he was perfectly astonished   I
that a proposition of the kind could fora momentbeentertamed.
He (Mr A ) could never be brought to consent to give his vote
in favor of it, but he wished to be clearly undeistood as not de-
signing, by any thing which he had said, to cast a censure upon
any one    He censured the practice as a crime—impalpable, m
tangible but at the same time formidable, and he  hoped that
the ma]outy would not, by then votes, sanction a practice so
reprehensible
Mr HUN TINGTON hoped to bring the Senate back to what   I
he consideied the real question at issue     He stated several
things that he would not do to ainve at that point,   but he    I
wouidsay at the same time thathewas sorry the Senator from   i
Ohioshouldimptrte to the Senator from Maine, and those who   I
act with him, adibposmon to pass this bill ma burned and im     .
mature man ner     No such disDOSltion existed    But, tocóme   I
to the point to which he wi&hed to bung the attention of the
Senate, he would say, that the real question at issue was whether   I
the word l books ' should be striekpn out or not     ft ow, he only
asked the Senate to look at the facts    First, that the House   |
passed the resolution to distribute the books, and they were dis    t
mbutej,  and, next, that the House thought propel  to exer
cise it* undoubted i isht of ordering the books to he paid for out
of the contingent fund, and to make an appropriation for that
purple    He would a^k, why should not the House Vio %o if it
saw fifí—and why should not the books be paid fori   Did the
House ever refuse to sanction the appiopmtions of the Sen
ate for the additional compensation to i -¡ officers r utof the con
tiriLtnt fundi    No   the H mse never did any «moh thins     But,
having pas-ed then icsolutionto distnbute the books, the Clerk
makes the purchase and distribution, and is the Senate to say
now it will not pry the honest and meritorious men who hHvt
entered into pecuniary engagements under the order of the
Hmsei   That is the whole question    He approved of the view
taken by the Senator fiom ÍSew Hampshire, which admits nf
tie obiigatijii to pay t>r these nooks a=i appears b> the modi

word "hereafter " so as not to affect the rights of Uioae who had

of the Senate wi uld sav they ought not to be paid for, and he
di lnot ^ee how anv could d( ny the propriety of appropriating

wasnotanapp opnauon for iVp Hou«e( or the members of the
House, but tor part of the membeis in their individual capaci

in need.
Mr YOUNG wished to do justice to the members of the
House on a point not >et biought to the attention of the .Senate.
i&u appropriation is a proposition to pay $&45fJ apiece for
books furnished to 117 members of that body, the whofeamoimt
being fifty tfiree thousand dollars But he was informed by seve*
ral members of the House, that when the resolution was proposed
on the last day of the session, they were not aware that the
books were to be purchased for their individual use,or. indeed 
that they did not belong to the Government} the understanding
of many who voted for it being that these books were already
provided It appears now that the publishers had large num-
bers of these books on hand, and could not sell them, and th«
distribution to members of Congress was only a contrivance to
get them off their hands Many members now declare, that if
the resolution had been so worded as to provide for the pur-
chase of the books for 117 members, to the amount of &45Q each
member, such a resolution nevei could have been entertained:
and, therelore, when they voted for it, they did so in perfect
ignorance, supposing the books were ahead) on hand, and no
furthei cost would be incurred.
Mr ¡bVANS said, if any members were ignorant of the fact 
it must have been because they were inattentive to the subject,
for it was notorious that the books had to he puichased
Mi WOODBURY said that no one was more anxious than
he to pass the general appropriation bills quickly But the
obstacle in the way was the inseition of clauses like this now
proposed te be stnckeu out—clauses admitted tobe sanctioned
by no previous act of Congress, and hence improper for a
mere geneial appropriation bill It had wisely been held m tha
other House foi several) ears, and had been confirmed here, that
a general appropriation bill should be limited to matters the
legality and propriety of which had been previously settled
under express acts of Congress
In such a case, no delay would be necessary, except to ascer-
tain the amount now proper, and an appiopnation bill could
bt, gone through with often in half an horn But, of late, the
introduction of new matters—the legality as well as amount of
which was, like this, very questionable—created much discus-
sion and inevitable delay He wished the chairman would
therefoieat once consent to strike out this disputed item, and.
then pass in five minutes, as he might, all which was not in
controversy This was i'echned On him, then, [Mi Evans,]
rested the responsibility for delay Such a course would not
injure the claimants m this case, asinasepaiate bill they could
obtain all for the books to which they were entitled, and they
knew, when the books were purchased, that no appropriation
existed to pay for them, and that they must take the n k and
postponement of getting the measure through a new Congress
in a suitable way
He, for one, was willing to pay them what was right, as
avowed on a former day The books had been bought and
used, and a fair remuneration was just But it was not e^.
pedient to make it in the present loose form, mixed up with
other matters of a contingent character Nor wasitso propel
to make it at all in a general appropriation bill, as in a specific
law or section, applicable to these books alone For, then,
eveiy thing pertinent could be distinctly and fully can-
vassed on us own merits, and our constituents, as well as
the public at large, see for what their money was voted away,—
in this case, not a small sum neither, sn, but an amount
nearly equal to double the per diem of the whole Senate at a
session of oidmary length That is about 830,000, and this
single book appropriation, mixed up With other matters in a
contingent account, is over $52,000 Nor is it, at, some suppose,
a contingent and incidental matter m substance, whatever may
be the form assumed Books or documents printed by Congress
for then own use may usually be regarded as incidental, ljut
these books ar*1 not of that character On the contrary, they
are book^ purchased of others, and printed by others—and
punted by others (or the community or themselves, and not for
Congress This changes the whole aspect oí the matter Ha
would not dwell on the apparent indelicacy of considering ¡such
puicbases as an incident to legislation, and the impropriety of
putting in this way about $450 into the pockets of every new
member beyond his travel and^e? diem He would only say,
that Congie^s itself, ever since 1837, had in both Houses de
nounced these pitr^ha^es as not apioper contingent oi aproper
zncideyita! to legislation, and had, m every geneial appiopna-
tion bill since, and m the very bill now balore us expressly pro
vided as to their coi tingait appropriation, that it should be ap
plied only to the 6~ dinar y expenditures of the Senate and
I'ou e, and to no othei purpose whatevei Here Mi W read
the clauses fiom caen act of Congiet and added that if s'nea
this limitation eiuVi House ha 1 hou-ht books and distributed
them, and pail for them out of their contingent fund, the tran^
action wa-> illegal They had usually made a specific and
¡separate appropriation in such ca&es, which was the proper
foi m But if, as is said, either House, by its own order, had
since taken and applied a part of its contingent to this objecf,
it had conducted contrary to both the manifest letter and spn it
of the legal and usual ristnction in the general appropriation
for contingencies, and which restnotion bad been introduced to
prevent a course like this Hence, h id the contmeent on tile
3d of March 1841 been ninety thousand dollars laiger than it
was, the $53,000 for these books could not have been paid out
of it, witnoutan open bieacb ot the restriction
The mover of the resolution therefore, look spet raleare not to
require m it that the bookb should be so paid foi, but he left
the payment to be adjusted by some new subsequent and epe
Cifio appropriation Had the general contingent, also, m the
very bul beioie u* been ninety thousand dollars lareer, these
books couldnothave been paid for out ofit, because theie is a
general expiesslimitation even m this—that it shall not be ap
plied to «other than the ordmarv expenditures of (he Senate
and IIou*e of Representatives " 1 he Senate may ask, then
how is itffotat—this, miscalled «•onimgentor incidental expense?
Whv sir by separatum it from the general contingent, atpa
rating it from any limitation oi rtMtictton, and calling it a ,«m
to suonly a deficiency m the contingent iund of a former > ear
This is done. too. when, ifthw-apprrtumH"  had been an actufl i
dart of the contingent fund of the former yeai, it could not ho
used at ail to pay for these books, which art now ip^ened, tn
terpolated, and pionounced a part, and are allowed to be patd
as apart, of the contingent and ncidentii expenses of that for*
meryear,   Most assuredly this money c^4Jd uj* be°o a °ae
