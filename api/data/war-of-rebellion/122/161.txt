Governor O. P. MORTON,

Indianapolis, Ind.:

Major Symington at Pittsburg has been advised to forward you the accouterments which he was ordered to furnish as soon as ready.

SIMON CAMERON,

Secretary of War.

WASHINGTON, D. C., May 6, 1861.

Hon. H. HAMLIN, New York:

MY DEAR SIR: Please advise me at the close of each day what troops left during the day, where going, and by what route; what remaining at New York, and what expected in the next day. Give the numbers, as near as convenient, and what corps they are. This information, reaching us daily, will be very useful as well as satisfactory.

Yours, very truly,

A. LINCOLN.

WAR DEPARTMENT, Washington, May 6, 1861.

Major General JOHN E. WOOL, Troy, N. Y.:

MY DEAR SIR: Appreciating as I do your long, able, and faithful services to the Government, and knowing your zeal in and loyalty to the cause of the country, I write merely to request that no requisition for troops or orders for their removal be hereafter issued without first communicating with this Department.

You will, my dear sir, not consider this as any reflection on anything you may have heretofore done, but merely to avoid any conflict of orders or confusion of arrangements, and that the Department may at all times know the number of troops called out, and how they may be made available at the shortest notice, without interfering with any previous order.

With sentiments of the highest personal regard and the strongest appreciation of your valor and patriotism, I have the honor to be, very truly, yours,

SIMON CAMERON,

Secretary of War.

WAR DEPARTMENT, Washington, May 6, 1861.

It is desired preferably that all the regiments mustered into the service of the Government from your State not already actually sent forward should be mustered into service for three years or during the war. If any person belonging to the regiments already mustered for three months, but not yet actually sent forward, should be unwilling to serve for three years or during the war, could not their places be filled by others who are willing so to serve?

SIMON CAMERON,

Secretary of War.

[Sent to the Governors of Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Yorvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Wisconsin.]
