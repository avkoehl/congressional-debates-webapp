Now it will be seen that twenty-tliree articles of
prime necessity, pay, on sixteen millions of im-
ports, more than nine millions of duties. If the
whole imports into this country had paid the same
proportion of revenue, we should have realized up-
wards of forty-six millions of duties, instead of
twenty-nine millions. Can any man doubt the truth
of the statement, that our system of high duties is
gradually throwing the burden of taxation upon the
labor of the country, when we have collected on the
present tariff more than five and a half millions of
dollars on such articles as sugar and molasses? Just
think of it: near one-fifth of your revenue is collect-
ed on sugar! While your articles of prime necessi-
ty are paying about 70 per cent, duty, articles of
luxury are paying less than 95 per cent. A farmer
in the West, who consumes a barrel of sugar per
year, pays more for the support of government than
John Jacob Astor, of New York, on the celebrated
Astor-house, worth three hundrei thousand dollars.
What will be tne result of this system? The
consequence will be, that the whole amount of our
revenue will be collected from the labor of the coun-
try, and capital will comparatively be exempt.
If this does not follow, you may push your sys-
tem of high duties so far, that you increase the
price on the community for its consumption, and
the moment you force the thing to that point that
you must find an outlet for the same in a foreign
country, growing out of the fact that your stimu-
lus has produced beyond the home supply, (which
it will do, for you give a premium to particular
classes,) from that moment there must be a reac-
tion, and consequently distress—a thing that 1 look
for in less than two years under the present system.
Manufactures and other classes will be found to be
sound and healthy when they grow out of natural
circumstances, and the natural tendencies of labor
and capital, and have not been interfered with by
the legislation of the country.
Lastly, the laborers of the country engaged in agri-
culture, and otherwise, are the last people on the
face of the earth to be helped by high duties; for
one thing is always true—if we have sudden rises
of prosperity, and sudden depressions, the labor of
the country always suffers the most, being the last
thing to go up in a sudden rise of prosperity, and
the first thing to fall when the hour of calamity and
distress comes.
SPEECH OF ME. C. J. INGEKSOLL,
OP PENNSYLVANIA.
In the House of Representatives, February, 1845—■
On the civil and diplomatic appropriation bill.
Mr. INGERSOLL moved an amendment to add
for a commercial agent abroad, to be appointed by
the President, §5,000.
He said that the members of the last Congress
might, some of them, recollect, that some time then
he had moved a similar amendment, which was
stifled, together with what he wished to say on that
subject, by the inexorable force of the previous
question. He seized this occasion, therefore, for
calling attention to a neglected subject of primary
importance. What he had to say, was intended for
the country, rather than for Congress; through the
medium of the press, to elicit public notice of a
great, the greatest, national pursuit, the principal
object of this federal Union, which object had
lost much of its consideration. I appeal, said he,
to no party feelings on this occasion, to no sectional
or limited support, there is no constitutional or
doubtful question involved, but the vital subject of
the foreign commerce of the whole United States.
For the last sixteen years, during all the admin-
istrations of General Jackson, Mr. Van Buren, and
Mr. Tyler, the country has been so absorbed in
controversies respecting currency and industry,
banks and tariffs, that foreign commerce has been
lost sight of by government. Now the United
States came together for commercial partnership
and pursuits; and while the firm has accomplished
much, yet much more remains to be done. The
following is a comparison of British and American
tonnage:
British. American.
1803 1,986,070 949,147
1811  2,247,323 1,232,502
1820 2,439,329 1,280,166
1830  2,201,592 1,191,776
1837   2,333,521 1,896,685
1843  2,989,757 2,158,602
Thus, while British tonnage has increased about
a million in the last forty years—one hundred per
cent.—American tonnage has increased in the same
time rather more than a million—over one hundred
per cent.; but what is very remarkable is that, within
the seven years from 1837 to 1843, their increase
was six hundred and fifty-six thousand tons, while
ours was but two hundred and fifty-one thousand:
that is, their increase was four hundred thousand
more than ours.
Those better versed in the subject than I pretend
to be, must explain this comparative disadvantage
or stagnation of American tonnage. I call public
attention to it, without attempting to explain. Steam
navigation by sea, which is exclusively theirs, our
extremely detrimental reciprocity-treaties with ma-
ny small navigating States, and with England, de-
priving us of her colonial trade, dearer ship-build-
ing in this country than some others, amounting, it
is said, to from five to eight dollars a ton, the false
measurement of our vessels, in order to evade du-
ties, and a false currency, which substitutes nominal
values for the coin standard, may be mentioned as
probably among the reasons why, latterly, British
tonnage has inceased faster than American.
At this stage, the outset of Mr. Ingersoll's argu-
ment, he was interrupted by Mr. J. P. Kennedy,
Mr. Holmes, and Mr. Schenck, all near him, in-
sisting that Mr. I. was entirely wrong in his account
of the tonnage; and even disconcerting him by jocu-
lar contradictions; asking, among other things, they
said, for authority for his assertions. Mr. I. per-
sisted in being correct, and said that his data were
taken from unquestionable sources of information,
and having reconsidered them for the publication of
his speech, he now thinks proper to add, that Mr.
Kennedy's report of May, 1842, on commerce and
navigation, is extremely, in fact throughout, errone-
ous. Yet even that gives the tonnage of the United
States for 1837, at 1,896,685; and the Register's re.
port from 1843, makes it but 2,158,602; so that the
increase is but 261,917, by Mr. Kennedy's own
statement. Mr. I.'s authories are Bayley's tables,
showing the progress of the shipping interest of
the British empire, United States, and France,
[London, 1844,] and the Companion to the British
Almanac for 1845; the former showing the increase
of British tonnage from 1837 to 1843, as 656,000,
and the latter as 674,000—with fractions each.
Thus Mr. I.'s comparative view of British Ameri-
can tonnage, is sustained by these authorities and
by Mr. Kennedy's report.
Redress of these disadvantages is within our pow-
er; and most of it to be effected at home. To purify
our currency and correct our measurement are ex-
clusively our own affairs. To annul disadvantageous
treaties and increase our steam navigation by sea,
are also within our own means.
As it is, such has been the growth of American
as compared with British tonnage, that, estimating
the population of Great Britain at twenty-seven mil-
lions, and that of the United States at twenty mil-
lions, we have one ton of shipping for every ten per-
sons; while they have but one ton and one-tenth.
This is without comprehending the British colonies.
The increase of American tonnage has been such
that two-thirds of what is engaged in transporting
the foreign commerce of the United States, and
three-fourths of the value of our exports and im-
ports, are done by our own shipping, without count-
ing a vast coasting and internal trade, river and
lakes, more valuable than all our foreign commerce.
The marine and navigation of this country must
surpass all others. Our vessels sail faster; remain
shorter periods in port, and therefore perform voy-
ages in less time. They suffer less from shipwreck
and other sea perils. The American seaman is
more active, intelligent, and sober. American sea
captains are much superior generally to others in
intelligence, morals, and deportment. Our vessels
are navigated by fewer men. For instance: a Spanish
vessel takes one man to fifteen tons; ours, one man
to twenty-three tons, on an average. Our merchant
are more enterprising than others. They would so
to hell, a black chieftain said, for gain—that is,
wherever regulated liberty is least fettered, the spirit
of enterprise dares and achieves most. Our imports
in the twenty years from 1821 to 1842 increased
from forty-one millions to eighty-eight millions, and
our exports from sixty-five millions to one hundred
and five millions. Our exports of domestic produce
in that time increased from forty-four millions to
ninety-three millions; and during the same period
the foreign exports of American commodities de-
creased from twenty-one millions to eleven millions.
While our own doubled, foreign interference dimin-
ished one-half. The clearances of American vessels
in our ports from 1821 to 1842 increased from
804,947 to 1,536,451; and their entries from 765,098
to 1,510,111. During that period foreign vessels in-
creased their American clearances from 83,073 to
740,497; and their entries from 81,526 to 732,775.
Thus, while our commerce largely increases, our
tonnage does not seem to keep pace with it.
While the increase of strictly American commerce
has exceeded one hundred per cent, in those twenty
years, at the same time the increase of foreign navi-
gation in the transportation of American products,
has been much greater than the American increase.
This fact, together with the greater increase before-
mentioned of British than American tonnage, are
circumstances to arrest the attention of all; and I
submit them to public consideration accordingly.
During the same twenty years American imports
of cottons, woollens, silks, linens, iron, china-ware,
tea, coffee, sugar, salt, and lead, have increased—
many of them largely,—while our imports have de-
