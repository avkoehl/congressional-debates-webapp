their arms and surrender and obey the laws that the military laws will not take any further action against them, but that we cannot protect them against the civil law should it deem best to take cognizance of their cases. It is useless for them to continue the contest, and sooner or latter they will be caught, and no terms will be granted them.

I have the honor to be, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. M. DODGE,

Major-General, Commanding.

WARRENSBURG, May 7, 1865.

General DODGE:

The bushwhackers are in pretty strong force, 110 men, at Kingston this morning. I think we will exterminate them, but it will be necessary to put militia in the field. The railroad line is not injured. The telegraph line between here and Holden is cut.

CHESTER HARDING, JR.,

Colonel, &amp;c.

WARRENSBURG, May 7, 1865.

Major-General DODGE:

A party of about forty bushwhackers is in this county; passed seven miles north of here an hour ago. Robbed Holden at 2 o'clock this morning. My men are in hot pursuit; have killed three and will probably get the whole gang.

CHESTER HARDING, JR.,

Colonel, &c.

WARRENSBURG, May 7, 1865.

General DODGE:

I believe it will be necessary to put troops on the line of the railroad between here and Pleasant Hill. The hands are very much alarmed. Four railroad teamsters were killed at Kingsville this morning. The guerrillas are going northeast, and will encounter our forces from Marshall, Sedalia, and Waverly. To guard the road I shall need still more forces.

CHESTER HARDING, JR.,

Colonel, &c.

CHALK BLUFF, SAINT FRANCIS RIVER, ARK.,

May 7, 1865-10 p. m.

Major-General DODGE:

I feel quite sure that Thompson has gone south. He has no command that will obey him. Bennett started this morning with a party to move rapidly to Jonesborough. Expect he will bring back information that will decide me to return.

C. W. DAVIS,

Lieutenant-Colonel.
