Numbers 8. Report of Captain Edward S. Rowland, Battery K, Second Missouri Light Artillery, of skirmish September 1. HDQRS. BATTERY K, SECOND MISSOURI LIGHT ARTY., In the Field, Mont. Ter., September 2, 1865.

SIR: I have the honor to report that on the 1st day of September, 1865, my camp was attacked by Indians, and in compliance with orders from headquarters Eastern Division, Indian Expedition, I at once proceeded to repel the attack with all of the mounted men then in my camp, seven in number. On arriving at the point of attack found that the Indians had succeeded in driving off a number of horses. I immediately pushed on after them, and on arriving at a point seven miles from camp discovered a strong party of Indians, about fifty in number, in a ravine. I at once attacked them. In the skirmish I lost 3 men killed and 2 wounded. A much larger number of the Indians were killed and wounded. Lieutenant Ferran of my command followed with a small number of men and by a different route; came upon the Indians that were driving the horses and killed two and wounded several others.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

E. S. ROWLAND,

Captain, 2nd Mo. Light Arty., Commanding Batty. K, Mounted as Cav.
