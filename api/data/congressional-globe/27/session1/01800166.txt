former part of hisobseivatnus but he had heard him say that
the aigument ofhifeeolleague [Mi Pickens] was an argument
againbttne Constitution, because his colleague hdd said that
it was an evil when taxes were collected in one pait of the
Union to be spent in another, this was an argument against the
Con&titution and against representative govemment Now Mr
R did not suppose it required any reasoning to prove that if
taxes were ever collected m one region and immediately dtó
bursed in the same region, it would be an evil, because such an
opeiation would be attended with expenses to which the peo-
ple ought not to be subjected, if it could be avoded
But the evil must be still worse if the tases were disbursed
m a region where they were not collected Would any one
&ay that such an operation was not an miury to one part of
the country, and a bounty to another 1 Could any man deny
this'? And did it not present a good practical illustration of
the working of the Constitution of the United States 1 Would
any gentleman deny this * Did not the reports flora the De-
partments show where the taxes, collected under this Go
ve nment, were disbursed"1 Would any man say that they were
disbursed equally^ No man could maintain it And if the
taxes were collected equally, and weie di&buised unequally,
could any man say that the Constitution of the United States
did not work unequally'?- It was the naked truth nay, he was
about to say it was a palpable truism And because he said
this, was he to be told that he was arguing against the Consti
tution, and against tepiesentative government? He was not
It was the most difficult thing m theworld, even when the inte-
tests of the people weie dbsulutely identical, to frame an equal
law Even in the erml'esr State, almost every law that could
be enacted vvould opeiate unequafiy
Nor v,as tins tiue ol repiesentative governments only, it
was tiue of eveiy nation under thesnn In Great Britain it
sell, nai tow and circumscribed as were the hmits of the British
isles, no tax could operate with entne equality Inequality was
the neee&sary result of taxation undei all Governments Taxa-
tion was itself an evil, in any shape, and to «ay that it was an
eviiwasnot to aigue against the Constitution of the United
States The same thing might be said of almost every law by
which pi operty was either taken 01 disbursed And because
his colleague had brought this as an aigument why taxes
should be kept as low as possible, a gentleman from the North
rose m his place and pronounced that argument to be an argu
ment against the Constitution and against the Union. The
gentleman was mistaken When the American people adopted
the Constitution, no man had been fool enough to think that it
would or could opeiate equally It was not adopted undei any
such expectation It was adopted as the price of liberty
and independence They knew that something musthesacn
heed, but they relied on the Constitution to reimburse them for
any and all sacrifices it might requite Its benefits they knew
wouid outweigh the price it cost a million fold provided only
thu the restrictions m that instrument were saciedly ad
heied to
Mi K believed that, next 0 the sacred book oí God, the Con
stitution of the United Estates was the most peifect paper ever
seen in theumveise, and he should consider it as one ol the
heaviest calamities, not to the people of this country alone, but
to all nations, should it ever go down Mi It was content
with the Constitution He wanted to see no innovation upon
¡t It Congress loiboie to tread upon doubtfid or equivocal
giound, the effect of the Constitution would be nothing but
peace and ha mony, and ali the wild speculations of libellous
muigumg foreigners, whether utter* d behind our backs or m
oui presence, would prove as lake 111 their ie«ults as they were
br-e and calumnious in the assumptions on which they were
founded All our difficulties—all that marred our harmony
01 d-huidted oui feelings fiom each other, aiose from theexer-
eiseoi doubtful powers, and, uuU-ss that exeicise should be re
framed 110m, dice alienations would increase tn] this mighty
labile of nee lorn, the piecious laboi of our fathers' hands,
must go down and tumble mtoiums But Mi R was not one
ol those who believed that this extended Union of ours was des
lined to be dissolved 'lhe histoiy ol Lhe past exhibited no m
biaiKem which a confederacy of States had been dissolved
No the tentlency oiconfedeiacieslay m the opposite direction
i hey had always become more and more consolidated, till
some military tyrant ai o&e and set his foot upon the neck ol the
whole
Mi R did not now feat, and never had feared, a dissolution of
the Union It w as deeply founded in the interest and affections of
the people, it wa-- consecrated by remembrances of the past, and
by tne most elevating hopes for the futuie till Americans should
ioigetboth, they never would consent to break their bond of
union And he believed that the chief reason why other nation 
had ever doubted the continuance of this Confederacy was to
be found in the contentions ot Representatives on that floor
lie knew nothing in the present state of things which breathed
any thing like antipathy agains' the North nor was he appre-
hensive that the anticipations of evil which our enemies might
indulge ever would be realized by the legislation in that Hall
lhe good sense and patnotism oí the people would coirect ex*
cessive and unco istitutional legislation heie But when stian-
sers heard on this flooi that ' free labor was to be arrayed
against blare laboi" in oui legislation—when they saw affiliated
societies of the North banded against the institutions oi" the
somh, and witnessed the eontinual strife to enlarge the Consti
tution by the usurpations of a majority on this floor, was it not
to be expected that, if thev wished our rum, their eyes would
beam with eagei hope to see it accomplished'? Doubtless they
would But they were doomed to disappointment, the day had
not arrived that was to witness the dissolution of the Union of
these States Mr R had set n a very learned pamphlet the
aim of which was to demonstrate from geographical convídela
tions, and the differences in climate and production, that the
Union could not be dissolved Mi R was no behevei m this
sort of geographical logic How often weie those whose geo-
graphical relations were piecisely the same found at daggers'
p unta with each other, and vice versal No, his hope was in the
deep sympathy which bound tugether the Anglo Saxon race—iq
the associations ol the past and the common mteiest and antici
paüonsof the futuie 1 hese would hold our people firmly to-
gether, and it wouid be long eie the malice 01 the wit of man
could separatb them from each other Notwithstanding all
this, howevei, he did believe that the Constitution opeiated
unequally even in its most just and constitutional action, but
ii it woiked still more unequally, he was not going to give it
up The Constitution was precious to him in its permanent
principles though it might be unequal in its temporary ope-
iation Make it but what u was intended to be, keep it above
ill suspicion by the puntyoi legislative action, let the Ge-
neral Government be what it was intended to be, our shield
against foreign nations, and leave local interests to the States
Do this, and union and hbeity would long be preserved for our
posterity
