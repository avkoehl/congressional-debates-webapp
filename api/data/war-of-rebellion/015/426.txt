MOUNT JACKSON, April 17, 1862.

Our troops occupied Mount Jackson at 7 o'clock this morning, and are now in front of Rude's Hill, where the enemy appears to be in force. The people report that they intend battle there. They resisted our advance in order to gain time for the burning of bridges and railways, cars, engines, &amp; c., that had accumulated at the terminus of the road; but our movement was so sudden, and the retreat of the rebels so precipitate, that we were enabled to save the bridges, two locomotives, and some cars. All these had been prepared with combustible material for instant conflagration. Many prisoners have been taken, and several fine horses captured from the enemy. The troops have acted admirably. They were in motion at 1 o'clock a. m. colonel Carroll's brigade, of Shields' division, led the advance on the Back road to the rear of Mount Jackson, and General Kimball on the turnpike; General Williams, with his fine division, bringing up the reserve column. We shall occupy New Market to-night. General Shields has so far recovered as to command his division in person.
