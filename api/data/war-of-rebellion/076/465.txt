HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, near Atlanta, August 11, 1864.

General SCHOFIELD:

I will not be able to come down to-day. I want to watch the effect of the heavy bombardment. I would like to have the division of General Hascall feel out this morning or early to-morrow for that railroad, and be prepared to support him or cut in between East Point and any infantry sent to molest him.

Major-General, Commanding.

General SCHOFIELD:

The hill that General Corse has taken will in nowise help us to break the enemy's line. On the contrary, it is opposite the big fort at White Hall that seems the strongest of the whole defenses of Atlanta, and from which they fire the heaviest guns. It is merely a means to contract his line and give him a reserve. I am hard at work writing. Don't wait for me. I will overtake you wherever you may be.

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE OHIO,August 11, 1864-8.30 p.m.

Major-General SHERMAN:

Colonel Garrard has returned from his scout. He crossed the Utoy Creek at the bridge, and went as far as Sandtown; thence toward Atlanta two miles and a half, and to the Owl Rock Church and across the right of General Hascall's position. He found only cavalry pickets on any of the roads. The large cavalry camps appeared to be a day or two old. Citizens informed him that Armstrong's division-three brigade-had camped near the church night before last and started for Campbellton yesterday morning, saying they were going on a raid. General Kilpatrick had shelled Sandtown day before yesterday, but none of his troops were in sight to-day.

General SCHOFIELD:

Dispatch received. Am glad to hear that Colonel Garrard has connected Sandtown with General Hascall's position. Armstrong will not make a raid on us from the direction of Campbellton. General Kilpatrick can whip his division if he crosses the Chattahoochee.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
