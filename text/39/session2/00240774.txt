To give an idea of what the present fiscal
year will likely produce, I append a table show-
ing the receipts for the fiscal quarter of the
present year:
Customs $50,843,744 24
Lands   228,399 72
Direct tax  340,454 39
Internal revenue  99,166,993 98
Miscellaneous  7,981,764 24
Total.
..ยง158,561,386 57
For the first five months of the present fiscal
year ending December 1, 1866, the receipts
were as follows:
Customs    $78,843,774 26
Internal revenue  146,355,7i5 73
If this ratio of receipts be maintained dur-
ing the year these two items alone will yield to
the Government over $540,000,000.
The special commissioner estimates the re-
ceipts for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1868,
as follows:
Customs $150,000,000
Internal revenue  275,000,000
Other sources  30,000,000
Total..
. 8455,000,000
This is the lowest estimate made, and the
supposed reduction from present receipts is
scarcely justified by any facts before us. The
commissioner simply means that the receipts
cannot fall below this sum.
Now, with these facts before us, I again ask
what the necessity of this continued taxation ?
Our public securities are now at a premium on
this side of the ocean, and our people have
confidence, and will continue to have confi-
dence, in their ultimate payment. Last year
we reduced the principal of our public debt at
least $200,000,000, which may have advanced
confidence in foreign markets; but our own
people are no more certain of their ultimate
redemption than they were before. The Sec-
retary of the Treasury complains that so many
of our bonds are now owned abroad. This
policy of collecting large balances by taxation,
to be applied to the payment of the public debt,
can have no other effect than to render our
own people unable to hold them and force them
upon the foreign market. When once sold
abroad they constitute the basis of a cheap
exchange,_ and tempt the importer to flood the
country with foreign fabrics.
I therefore insist that instead of collecting
$300,000,000 from excise taxes we collect
about half that amount or enough simply to
meet the current expenditures of the Govern-
ment. There is now a large balance of coin
in the Treasury, say $80,000,000, exclusive of
deposits, and also a large balance of currency,
all of which is dead capital not needed for
pressing demands upon the Treasury, and yet
we proposed to increase instead of diminishing
the burdens of taxation. For the reasons
which X have stated I appeal to the chairman
of the Finance Committee and his distinguished
associates" to let this measure be postponed
until the House shall have perfected the inter-
nal revenue bill and sent it to us. Let us
reduce internal taxes, a thing which will re-
lieve every industrial interest sKd none so surely
as the manufacturer himself, and we can then
adjust tariff rates so as to wrong no interest,
and best subserve the purposes of the Govern-
ment. If we pass this law and then reduce
the excise tax, prices will still be advanced,
and that advance will not benefit the Govern-
ment, but for some time at least will be a mere
bonus to the manufacturer.
_ I did not intend to offer amendments to this
bill, but I have indulged the hope at all times
that its present consideration would be post-
poned. If, however, its consideration is to be
pressed upon us, there are many inequalities
which I conceive to be prejudicial to the inter-
ests of my own State, if not to the entire West,
which I shall endeavor to remove. This very
article of hemp presents one of them. The
proposed tax on the article is not exceeding
fifteen per cent., while the ruling rates on the
majority of articles, and especially those in the
older States, are from fifty to one hundred per
cent. I discovered that the article of raw
hides, produced in the West and consumed in
thegEast, are put at ten per cent. This will
not pay transportation over the railroads and
is no protection against the European article.
The goat, calf, and deer skins of the West
are put at five per cent.; the sole leather of
Spain is placed at thirty-five per cent., and the
French and German calf-skins at only thirty
per cent. Flaxseed is kept at sixteen cents
per bushel. Linseed cake at twenty per cent.,
and flaxseed oil at twenty-three cents per gal-
lon. The manufactures of lead are put at
three cents per pound, and butter is reduced
from four cents j>er pound to three. Litho-
graphic stones which abound in my State are
placed at twenty per cent., while the Senator
from Vermont [Mr. Edmunds] is dissatisfied
with twenty-five per cent., and one dollar per
cubic foot in addition upon the marble in his
State. I discover also a duty, of two dollars
per thousand on fencing lumber needed to open
up the farms of the West, while the ship-tim-
ber, spars, oakum, and adhesive felt, and other
articles entering into the construction of ships
are entered on the free list; and that is not all.
The Senator from Maine discovers that this
vicious system of legislation is rapidly destroy-
ing the ship-building and commercial interest^
of his own State. To check this tendency to
decay he has provided in the twenty-second
section of this bill for a drawback equal in
amount to the import duty paid on all iron,
lumber, hemp, manila, copper, and cordage
used in the construction, rigging, or equipment
of sailing or steam vessels of the United States.
This is a bounty of not less thaft twenty per
cent; upon the cost of a vessel, but in my judg-
ment the Senator will accomplish nothing by
this motion. If this measure passes commerce
will languish still. There is now no line of
oceSn steamers owned by an American com-
pany. The Senator from Connecticut says
that ship-building has ceased in his own State.
The special commissioner tells us that vessels
can be built in Canada and New Brunswick for
fifty per cent, less than they can be built in the
State of Maine.
Mr. FESSENDEN. Nearer one" hundred
per cent.
Mr. HENDERSON. Why is this? Ships
conld be built in Maine in 1860; they could be
built in Connecticut. If it takes twice the
amount to construct a ship in Maine that it
does to construct a ship in New Brunswick it
must proceed from the high prices of labor.
The high prices of labor result from the high
prices of commodities which the laborer must
have. Does the Senator expect to build ships
cheaper when the price of labor has been ad-
vanced ? I have shown that this bill will ad-
vance prices, while the Senator then attempts
by drawback to resuscitate a drooping industry
he gives his support to a measure which will
certainly neutralize the advantage he seeks.
Even if this were not so twenty per cent, in
the cast of a vessel will not be sufficient. If
the Canadians can now build one hundred per
cent, cheaper can they not build eighty per cent,
cheaper even after this bounty in the name of
drawback shall be paid ?
Mr. President, as a western man, I would
rather to-day that the Government of the Uni-
ted States would take in hand the tobacco and
whisky interests of this country and deal it out
as they do in France and England, and raise
the entire revenue for ordinary expenses from
those two articles of western growth and man-
ufacture than to continue this evil system in
which we are now engaged. I would positively
rather that those two interests should be taken
and subjected to the same operation to which
they are subjected in England and France. I
would rather that the Government would take
in hand the whisky distilleries of the West and
let the article be manufactured by the Govern-
ment and sold by none except Government
agents; I would rather adopt that system a
great deal than to pursue this policy. It would
be infinitely better; 'and I believe the people
of the western States, at least my-section of
the country, would rather see it done.
I see by the report of the Commissioner of
Internal Revenue that the revenue collected on
whisky in 1863-64, when the excise tax for a
large portion of the time was "twenty cents
per gallon, was $28,000,000, and in the year
1865-66, with a tax of two dollars per gallon,
the revenue collected was $29,000,000. I be-
lieve as much whisky was manufactured in the
latter as in the former; surely the consumption
of the article has not in the least diminished.
I am satisfied that a revenue of one hundred
and fifty to two hundred million dollars conld
be collected from this source alone without
materially increasing the price to the consumer.
Much of what has been said in regard to whisky
is equally applicable to the article of tobacco.
Frauds must be prevented or the honest man-
ufacturer-will be driven from business. The
espionage necessary to prevent frauds requires
Government, control tantamount to ownership
itself, and it is exceedingly questionable in
my mind whether a radical change is not de-
manded in reference to these two articles.
Then what is the remedy? Let us wait on
the House of Representatives, get their bill,
reduce the internal revenueand when we
shall have reduced it I undertake to say it
will give an impetus to trade and business in
this country that we cannot realize by passing
this measure. This is not going to help the
manufacturers, and my friend from Rhode
Island [Mr. Sprague] had better vote with me
to postpone this measure, because I am inclined
to think that cotton manufactures will languish
and die under its operation, especially if they
have to pay three cents per pound on the raw
material. Whether the woolen manufactures
will faro any better or not 1 cannot say. But
that is a significant fact stated by the Com-
missioner in his report that they were far more
prosperous under low but stable and fixed
duties. It seems that not only is. our com-
merce dying, not only are our vessels driven
out, not only is our registered tonnage dimin-
ishing. but our woolen manufactures are droop-
ing, and it may be soon that the cotton manu-
factures will feel the blighting influences of this
legislation.
Mr. WILLIAMS. Why?
Mr. HENDERSON. I have attempted al-
ready to explain that a mere increase of duty
is quite illusory. The law that gives nominal
protection, but at the same time advances
prices of the raw material, enhances wages,
unsettles business, produces a feeling of inse-
curity, and teaches the people to pray to the
Government for help instead of relying on โข
hard work and economy, is an injury to all
pursuits and a benefit to none.
Then, Mr. President, without proceeding
any further on this subject, I hope that the
Finance Committee themselves will adopt a
course of policy that will look to the decrease
of prices. If we take off these duplicated
taxes that fall so heavily upon the manufac-
turer that $1 50 of duty only furnishes seven
cents protection, as demonstrated by the Sen-
ator from Connecticut, [Mr. Foster,] and let
the tariff alone, or adjust it as it may be
needed after the adoption of the internal rev-
enue law, it is my opinion that business will
prosper ; I think that we will give new life to
manufactures, to agriculture, and to every
other interest.
_ Why, sir, the utter fallacy of increased du-
ties may be seen from one single article of
manufacture. I allude to railroad iron. We
have not protected it by increased rates for
