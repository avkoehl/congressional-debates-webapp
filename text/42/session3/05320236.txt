can slave trade, have directed me to return it

cation read.
The Chief Clerk read as follows:
To the Senate of the United States :
In answer to the resolution of the Senate of the

U. S. GRANT.

To the President:
The Secretary of State, to whom has been referred
the resolution of the Senate of the 5th instant, re-
questing the President to communicate to that body,
if in his opinion not inconsistent with the public
interest, any information he may have in regard to
the existence of the slave trade upon the coast of

ernment of Great Britain or other countries, if any,
for its suppression," has the honor to inform the

HAMILTON FISH.
Department of State,
Washington, December 9,1872,
The VICE PRESIDENT. What action
does the Senator desire ?
Mr. CAMERON. Let it lie on the table.
The VICE PRESIDENT. That order will
be made.
Mr. WINDOM. I am directed by the Com-
mittee on Appropriations, to whom was referred
the bill (H. R. No. 2989) making appropria-
tions for the current and contingent expenses
of the Indian department, and for fulfilling
treaty stipulations with various Indian tribes
for the year ending June 30, 1874, and for
other puiyoses, to report it back with amend-
ments. 1 move that the bill be made the
special order for Thursday next at one
o'clock.
Mr. SHERMAN. I do not think we ought
to make special orders at this period of the
session. The Senator can accomplish his
object by giving notice that he will call up the
bill at a certain time.
Mr. WINDOM. Then I withdraw the mo-
tion, and give notice that I will call up this bill
at one o'clock on the day after to morrow,
and if the Seriate will give it their uttentiou I
have no doubt we can pass it before the holi-
day recess.
.TAMES C COOKE'S PATENT.
Mr. FERRY, of Connecticut. The Com-
mittee on Patents liave instructed me to report
back two House bills, which are almost iden-
tical in their details, and to ask the present con-
sideration of the bills. They propose to give
authority to the Commissioner of Patents to
hear an application for an extension where in
both instances the patentee is near the expira-
tion of his first term of fourteen years and the
petitioners by inevitable accident failed to
make their application so as to leave time
enough to give the ninety days' noticeâ€”a mere
technical defect.
Mr. EDMUNDS. What was the inevitable
accident ?
Mr. FERRY, of Connecticut. In one of
the cases there were two patents, and by mis-
take the wrong patent was examined for the
purpose of getting at the date upon which to
make the application for an extension and the
wrong date was given, a few days difference
being between them, so that there is not time
enough to give the ninety days' notice which
the law requires.
In the other case the applications and fees
were sent to a solicitor in Washington, the
inventor doing everything incumbent, upon him,
and the solicitor, by mere oversight, also failed
to give the notice within a few days of the
time required by law.
Mr. EDMUNDS. What are the patents in
each case?
Mr. FERRY, of Connecticut. One is a
machine for making crackers and the other
for manufacturing webbing.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator from
Connecticut reports back two House bills
authorizing an application for an extension of
patents, and asks for their present, considera-
tion. They will be reported, after which they
: will be subject to objection.
I The Chief Clerk read the bill (H. R. No.
2997) for the relief of James C. Cooke. It
authorizes the Commissioner of Patents to hear
the application of James C. Cooke for an
extension of the patent heretofore granted
him on the 4th of January, 1859, for an im-
Erovement in manufacturing webbing, num-
ered 22528, and to grant the extension of
the patent for seven years from and after the
, 4th of January, 1873, in the same manner and
' to the same effect as if Cooke bad applied for
the extension ninety days before the expira-
tion of the patent.
By unanimous consent, the Senate, as in
Committee of the Whole, proceeded to con-
sider the bill.
The bill was reported to the Senate without
amendment, ordered to a third reading, read
the third time, and passed.
JOSEPH FOX'S PATENT.
Mr. FERRY, of Connecticut. The other
bill is a bill for the relief of Joseph Fox.
j By unanimous consent, the Senate, as in
! Committee of the Whole, proceeded to con-
sider the bill (H. R. No. 3133) to enable
Joseph Fox to make application to the Cotn-
' missioner of Patents for the extension of let-
ters-patent for machine for making crackers.
It proposes to grant leave to Joseph Fox, of
Lansingburg, in the county of Rensselaer,
New York, to make application to the Com-
missioner of Patents for an extension of the
letters-patent granted to him for a machine
for making crackers under date of February
1, 1859, for the term of seven years from and
after the expiration of the original term of
fourteen years for which the letters-patent are
granted; such application to be made in
the same manner and to have the same effect
as if it had been filed not less than ninety
days before the expiration of the original term
of the patent. And upon such application so
filed the Commissioner of Patents is to con-
sider and determine it in tile same manner and
