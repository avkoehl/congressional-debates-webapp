Since the raid I have established a provost guard of convalescents from Texas hospital, but they are entirely without arms. To make this guard at all efficient-and one is greatly needed here to arrest deserters and stragglers, conscripts and suspicious characters, and in case of another raid to defend the town from the enemy-they must be provided with serviceable muskets, and I respectfully ask that you send me thirty muskets for the purpose above mentioned.

The following-named officers have their offices at this post: Surg. L. A. Bryan, Texas hospital; Captain A. G. Durkee, post and hospital quartermaster; Major W. H. C. Price, superintendent Niter and Mining District Numbers 10; and Major J. Shelby Williams, conscription officer for Congressional District Numbers 7. The first two mentioned report to me at this office; the last two report to their immediate superior officers. There is also a board of surgeons for examining conscripts, but they form part of the Conscript Bureau and do not report here. The Texas hospital, in charge of Surg. L. A. Bryan, makes a daily morning report to this office.

Below I give an average of reports received since the commencement of this system on the 1st of the month:

LOUIS A. BRYAN,

Surgeon in Charge.

Captain Durkee, assistant quartermaster, having been but recently assigned has not yet made his report.

In conclusion, I would urge upon you the necessity of having thirty muskets to render efficient the provost guard at this post, and in case of a raid to defend the town.

I have the honor to be, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

T. H. FRANCIS,

Captain, Commanding Post.

Brigadier General F. A. SHOUP,
