if there wast any Upon constitutional grounds, he repeated, he
never had had any difficulty on the subject of i&,mng Treasury
notes
But the mere issuing of Treasury notes in behalf of tnose
who had claims against the Government, and the issuing of pa
er to circulate as money—a Continental papei, irredeema
le—might be very widely diffeient things If Government
issued a treasury note m behalf of amanto whom it owed a
debt, and allowed it to be transferable by assignment, the Go
vernment was not responsible for the use the individual might
make of it If he chose, od.1i so vn account, to pass it to ano
ther, Government was not responsible But if Government
issued irredeemable paper, to circulate as money, then currency
was its object, and then there was a distinction in the two
cases which, it seemed to him, must be clear to every mind
He, iherefore, had no difficulty issuing Treasury notes in
behalf of the creditors of the Government, andin the manner
stated
If, then, thei e was no constitutional objection to the issuing of
Treasury notes, the only rea airrmg -question "was whether the

Mr WARREN (addressing his remarks to Mr Underwood)
was understood to inquire in what respect the Treasuiy notes
and notes of private individuals differed1
Mi UNDERWOOD By the issue of Treasury notes, the
debt wag liquidated, and the amount of claims upon the Go-
vernment fixed, and the Government has acknowledged its ha
bility But he was going on toanswei what he conceived to be
an erroneous position on the part of his colleague, [Mr Mar
SHAX.L 1 who spoke yesterday The advantage to the individual
holder of Treasury notes consisted in the negotiability of those
notes and in the further fact, that by making them receivable
for all public dues, you give an immediate value to them, which
you cannot give to the mere holder of scrip, because you cannot
take this in immediate payment at the custom hnuse or in pay
men for lands Treasury notes also enter into the circulation
of the country and to that extent may operate m lehevmg the
country from the present pressure, extending from one end of
it to the other It seemed to him, then, that there was no ob-
jection to issuing Treasury notes on consti utional grounds—
that they were preferable to merely funding a debt, and that
they operated as a currency Whethei the practice of decosit
mg hundreds of ihousands of dollars of these notes with the
banks, and raising funds on the deposites ought to be prohibited
oi not, would he decided by the rejection 01 adoption of his
amendment, which would limit the issuing of these #otes to the
ci editors of Government alone, and do away with this, as he con
s dered, objectionable practice He then offered the following
amendment, which was read by the Clerk
Be it farther enacted, That the notes issued under the autho
nty of tbis act «hall not be sold 01 pledged by the Tieasurv, or
any otnei Department, for the puipose of laisnig specie, or
other funds but bhall be issued alone in favor of the creditor of
the Government
Mr GAMBLE said he had only a few remarks to make on
thisquebtion    If fhev could visitthe sinner with the inconve
menees in producing which he had been the instrument, and
which the creditor was now subject to, he might oppose the
passage of this bill    But, inasmuch as the innocent has to suf
fer Or the gmlty, he could not give hr* consent to oppose the
bill     lie had lookei i little  into the history of the Treasury
note operation and he had found that it was a miserable expe
dient to supply a paper currency, that it had never been ic

now asked to relieve the immediate wants of the creditor-, of
Government—the issue of Treasury notes—which, as the ^n
demon from Kentucky [Mr UndebwoodI hadremarked,\ie
used for the double purpose of a loan and a currency, and
would "upply the need of those in want until this Congress could
pass a law by the operation of which this bill should be sus
pended? He would not vote foi the bill if it were not limited as
it is by the proviso   He should bt unwilling to raise the rate of
interest higher than six per cent Upwards of $2U0,üüü OOO
had been borrowed hy the States ot a rate not nigher than
six per cent —most of it at five per cent Should it be said:
that the credit of the Government was at a lower standard than
that of the States? By giving a little time, if the money
could not be obtained in the United States, it conli be pro
cured abroad, and at a rate of interest not higher, perhaps, than
five per cent
In looking back at the operation of the Treasury note sys
tern he found that six pel cent had been the highest rate of
interest ever allowed either intime of war orpeace He would
be unwilling to give a higher late than that There could be
no danger ofsustammgany loss, more especially when the ere
ditor of the Government could take these Treasury notes, which
are receivable for public dues For these reasons he should
vote for the parage of the bill, the operation of which would
be terminated as soon as the loan bill went into effect, by
means of which those at the head oí the Administration might
get maney abroad, and stop the miserable system of Treasury
notes
Mr FESSCNDENnextobtamed the floor, but gave way for
a moment to
Mr SMITH of Virginia, who inquired if the amendment of
the gentleman from Kentucky were not now before the commit
tee, and suggested that they had better dispose of the amend
ment before the bill was further debated
Mi rfJSSENDCN said he supposed the mente oi the bill
were now open foi consideiation, although the amendment
was p^ndmsr Many gentlemen, he continued, who had ad-
diesbed the committee on thissubject, seemed to go on the sup-
position that eveiy Whig m the House by previous action,
had pledged himself against this bill He intended to vote
for the bill, he did not considei -fchat, either as an individual
or as a member of the Whig party, he was pledged in any
way to vote agai «t the bill All Would judge for them
selves but with regard to himself, he would say, that never
since the Treasury note system had been presented to the
country had he placed himself in such a position before his
constituents, or any rndividual, that he could not consistently
vote foi a bill of this description, when he believed it necessary
and expedient Had lie been a member of Congress at the
extra session of 1«37, he should have voted for the issuing of
Treasuiy notes at that time, but should not have supported
other subsequent laws on this subject As a Whig, he did
not conceive that he or any Whig was necessarily compelled
to vote against a bill of his description If any had voted
against the lsue ol Tieasury notes on constitutional grounds, or
if any were opposed to ufiom principle in all cases, they, of
course, could not ad pt the course which he intended to pursue
But, with regard to this, mueh the largest part who o i posed
Tieacury note  had done it on the ground that they were ím*
f íopeí urdri the circumstances, ard were not bound by their
foi mor coui&e any fin ther than surh circumstances now ex
lbted He bad insisted stenuously against Treasuiy notes, as
thev had been issued, and held that they were wrong ano un
neces*tiiy and nad been carne I too far A nd havit g thus con
tended he wished to give some reasons why he should now
support this bill
lie would have voted for the bill of 1837 We were then in
averypecuiai position We had not money enough that we
could use, but we had funds enough that we believed would
soon be available This Government was thenxomparatively
nch There was every piobabihty that m ashort period this
Government would have funds Would it have been wise,
then, he asked, to have saddled upon this country a loan which
would have to run for a considerable tune? He apprehended
not, but that, in such circumstances, and as a mere
temporary measure, the is&ue of Treasury notes might
be proper He believed it was proper at that time What he
objected to was, that it had been followed up as a system, after
it was di&covered that there was and would be a permanent de
ficiency in the revenue, and that the party then m power should
have geme on, sthey did go, increasing the Tieasury notes,
and exposing the countiy to all the hazards of such a system,
which was a deceptive plan, calculated to cheat the people of
this country, and to keep them in ignoranceof the true state of
then affans.
It was not the power but the continuation of the power, that
he had opposed Could they be chargeable, then, under the
I re«ent suate of things, wuh mconbistency in supporting trie
bill under consideration9 He had no constitutional difficulties
oi the subject He was what the gentleman from Virginia
would calla latin diñarían in constitutional matters He held
that the power o ¡ suing Treasury notes existed because it was
not piohioited in the Constitution, and because it was " neces
«ary and proper, 'or might be, under «orne circumstances, to
carry on the Government But more than this By the Con
stttu'ion, Gt ngrcss has the power to pay the debts of the Go
vernment I he time might exist, it did now when wf had
none of the «r er«al medium, a  thesentlenunfrom Kentucky
calle lit, and should wenot, then, pay our debt  as we could?
Supnoce we wereat war with Great Biitam, and that we had
no money a iu could borrow none would gentlemen say it wa«
untonstuutio i?l to issue Treasury note* to procuie the means
of earning oí thn w u because the Constitution had not given
the power m totideimerlisof i sumj? Tieasuiy notes? He
appiehpnled theie wmld be no difficulty abou. it In thit

Government lildconl re the suffering to itself, a  an mdividu
a! he (Mi P) dioweitha it might be proper, but weie they
not htapm r moresuffeimg on the people—not only the mdivi
dual cieditor, but on the people generally—by continuing this
state of thirds? The consequence of it would be, that oui mill
tary and naval operations must cease and that the Governmei t
contracts must be put an end to, and additional suflenng be
heaped upon the people If the Government resorted to the
mode of rainng the interest and obtaining loans m our own
market, it would take so much money out of circulation,
! whereas if they put Treasury notes into the maiket, they be
come, m fact, a cuculatmg medium, and go thus far to re
¡eive the people from their burdens He would not resort to
Treasury notes asa a circulating medium, but nevertheless,
when fhey had been issued for proper purposes, could there
be the slightest objection to their being put into ciiculation to
