25th Cong....3d Sess.
Public Defaulters—Mr. Duncan.
Ho. or Reps.
They grew out of the wholesale gambling system
estab'iohed, maintained, and managed by the
banks T ns system the Democracy of this coun-
try h"ve always set their face against Who are
responsible for the losses thus sustained but those
who, tor party and pecuniary motives, sustain
and keep up the fraudulent system that gives birth
and supoort to them '
Collecting officers Report of January 17,1833,
House of Representatives, document No 111,
shows names of defaulting collecting officers
Reports of First and Second Comptrollers of the
Treasury, documents Nos. 2, 6, 48, and 186, of
the House of Representatives, show defaults of
disbursing officers
In looking through these documents, among
many hundred of Whig names I find that of James
Monroe, formerly a captain in the Army, and is m
default $4,115 44 I have understood that this is
one of the Whig members of Congress elect, and
1 think I have seen him charg'd with having given
$5,000 towards carrying the New York Whig
elections If so, would it not have been more
honoiable for him to have paid the debt which he
owed the nation'
Robert Brent     The name of this individual
stands on record with a defalcation annexed of
078 541     He was a paymaster general, (Whig )
■Samuel   Chaplin,  late paymaster, defalcation
$109 000, (Whig )
Amos Bmney, late Navy agent, defalcation
$70 562, (Whig)
Joseph Kuhn    Defaulter for $92,621 55, (Whig )
Miles King, Navy agent, (Whig,) defalcation
not known
But here comes William McMurtry, purser,
defalcation $ 17,991, (Whg )
Who next' Robeit Randolph Defalcation
$25,097
lhese are  subjects worthy of investigation
Why not inquire after them'    They are Whigs
Their exposition would not assist to elect a Fed
eral President, and such an investigation would
expose the banking system     But why not investi-
gate Thomas  McKenney's connection   with the
old Bank of Columbia' how much he owed it, and
what did the Government lose'    What are his
politics'    Is he not the editor of a violent, raving,
rantmg,and bitter Federal bank newspaper' Who
noto cries corruption ' corruption ' as loud as any
man in all Judea'
Bank defalcations Look, sir, at the millions
that have been lost to tne Government by the
fiauds of the banks, since 1817 up to 1838, inclu-
sive—all during the bank reign
Bank defaults in 1837 Yes, sir, sixty or seventy
in number, all defaulters at onetime Yes, sir, in
defalcation at one time to more than $20,000 000
This was all right in the binks, though the Gov-
ernment was made bankrupt thereby, the nation's
character blighted athomeand dishonored abioad
Indulgence was given to them by the President
and Secretary, and that indulgence confirmed and
continued by Congress This indulgence was
right because given to the banks Yes, sir, the
banks can defraud and bankrupt the Government,
Whig collectors, Whtg receivers, and Whig dis-
burses, can rob the Government of any amount,
and Whig muteness and silence reigns, more es-
pecially if that robbery be perpetrated under a
Federal Administration Beside the indulgence
and time given before to the banks, as deposit
agents, from May to October, 1837, for $20 000,000
at first, and then for five or six millions of dollars,
the Treasury Department gave time and indulgence
to numerous merchants, on duty bonds, during the same
period, for near Jive millions more, though all were m
default tó the Government This was in the ex-
ercise of a sound and legal discretion, and proved
m the end beneficial to the United States I say
Congress sanctioned this in September, 1837, and
extended the indulgence still longer Both of these
happened after real, ascertained defaults, and were
not previously, like the short time taken by the
Department and the President, exercising the same
legal and sound discretion in the case of some re-
ceivers, to inquire if a real default had occurred,
and if the money would not, without suit, be de
posited as ordered Yet the hue and cry is, that
the last is impeachable but the first is right'
And because Mr Woodbury, Draco or Nero
like, will not take a Democrat by the throat and
stiangle him the moment he is under the least sus-
picion of official defalcation, let his means to sat-
isfy the Government be what they may, the cry
of conuption must be rung upon* every change,
and the whole Administration denounced as basely
fraudulent, and as conniving at public pecu'ation
All indulgences that have been given to default-
ers has been with a view to put it in the power
of the defaulter to liquidate tne amount for which
he may have been in default, and so far as the
present Administration, and that which preceded
it, is concerned, the result of such a course of pol-
icy (where the particular case would admitof such
indulgence) has been of advantage to the Go\ern-
ment, and in all cases of default, so soon as it was
discovered that delay or indulgence were either
dangerous, or did not promise an advantage, the
individual has been removed, so has the de-
faulter, under all circumstances, been eventually
removed 1 believe I am warranted in saying that
the Government has sustained no loss by either
neglect or indulgence to defaulters by the Treas
ury Department, or any officer thereof, but, on the
contrary, has been benefited by indulgence Sir,
it is a curious fact, that out of one hundred and
fourteen collectors in nominal defalcation—(nom-
inal, 1 say, for many of the defalcations that ap-
pear are not so, the settlement being subsequent
to the publication of the defalcations)—near one '
hundred of them were before General Jackson's I
administration So out of the whole number of '
disbursing officers, more than two thousand were
under foimer Administrations The losses alone,
by two merchants, Smith and Thompson, were
moie than by all the collectors and receiveis, ex-
cept what may be lost by Swartwout
Swartwout had his appointment as collector of
the port of New York in 1829, by General Jack-
son This was one of the political errors of his
life, and perhaps it has rarely fallen to the lot of
man to commit fewer It is due to Mi Van Bu-
rén, and proper to say in this place, that 1 e was
oppo&ed to the appointment of Swartwout, but
more of this hereafter During this discussion,
hozannas have been sung as usual to the Bank
of the United States It collected the public reve-
nue It kept safe the public revenue And it
disbursed the public revenue, said one gentleman,
(I believe Mr Wise, of Virginia,) and not one
dollar was lost while it had the management of
affairs There are some mistakes in this eulogy
upon the bank The bank never collected one
dollar of the public revenue The bank never dis-
bursed one dollar of the public revenue, nor did
the bank keep safe all of that that was depos'ted
with it Swartwout received his appointment
during the existence of the United States Bank,
and it may be safely said, that it was through and
by the bank policy and the ciedit system, that the
Government has been defrauded out of the amount
of Swartwout's defalcation
My colleague [Mr Bond] deliberately accuses
the President and the Secretary of the Treasury,
together with the Solicitor, Comptroller, and First
Auditor, of a combined and studied effort to de-
ceive the people relative to theexibting provisions
that authorize ordirect the periodical inspection of
the books and accounts of public officers, and he
winds up by a deliberate assertion that the docu
mentssentto theHouseare, on this point,untrue
Not content with thus making use of a palpable
perversion of the reports of the Solicitor and
Comptroller, to found this charge of falsehood
against the President and the officers of theTreas-
ury Department, he takes occasion, by the same
means, to magnify his own sagacity and industry,
parades before this House, as something wonder-
fully novel, one of the best known sections of the
general collection act of 1799 Perhaps the very
law which is more frequently referred to, and is
more familiar than any other in the statute-book,
and quotes, as a discovery due to his own remark-
able acuteness, the very portion of that law under
which the public officers, whom he accuses of
being ignorant of its provisions were, at the time,
notoriously acting
The Secretary of the Treasury had directed the
Solicitor and Comptroller, after ascertaining the
facts of Swartwout's defalcation, to suggest such
changes m the existing laws as they might deem
advisable It is their report from which my col-
league makes his selections.   Those officers are
not inspectors of the custom-house proceedings
and books, as directed by law, and that an expresa
provision, requiring this to be done, from time to
time, by a competent officer from the Treasury
Department, is an obvious and important meas-
ure of precaution and safety,
This suggestion my colleague construes into a
" combined and studied effort " to create a false im-
pression as to the existing laws, and says that
these documents are so far from truth, that he is
able to read an express clause from the statute-
book, which has for more than forty years pro-
vided for the very inspection " that is now recom-
mended as a grave and salutary remedy " And
how does he do this' How does he fulfill his
boasted promise' How are the President and the
officers of the Treasury convicted of falsehood, or
gross ignorance' How is the searching sagacity
of the member himself established' Why, for-
sooth, all this promised prostration of the Pieo-
ident, Secretary, Solicitor, Comptrollei, Auditor,
and the whole Government, which thunders so
'oudly in the index, all this self glorification of
my colleague, and the astounding proof of his
ability to perform these " searching operations,"
(to use his favorite phrase,) turns out to be noth-
ing more than reading to this House a well-known
section of the old collection law, which provides
that collector  and other officers shall keep true
aceourts, submit them to inspection when re-
quired , and forfeit $1 000 in every case where they
refuse so to do Does this prove what my col-
league wishes us to believe it does' Does it prove
that regulai inspections of the books and proceed-
ings of the custom house, by a competent officer
of the Treasury Department, are now directed by
law' As well might you say that the penalty im-
posed upon a smuggler made it unnecessary to
direct by law the appointment of a single inspector
or tide waiter, that there was no need of a marshal
or officer of police, because the statute declares
that a counterfeiter ora thief shall be put in the
penitentiary The provision in question was well
known, but it is an inadequate provision Did
any one doubt or deny that the Secretary of the
Treasury might send a person to any custom-
house especially to examine its proceedings? Is
there a word m the report of the Secretary, or in
any of those documents, that expresses such a
doubt' Were not the Solicitor and Comptrollerso
sent under this very provision, in this very in-
stance' Yet my colleague tries to create this im-
pression—an impression the very reverse of what is
justly and fairly to bededucea fromthedoeuments
themselves. The provision in the old collection
law is inadequate, totally inadequate It is per-
missive, not directory It was meant to provide
for special cases, not to form part of a general
system " The new and salutary remedy " which
my colleague ridicules, is not found in it, either
directly or by inference That remedy is to direct,
by positive law, periodical inspections, by compe-
tent officers If that is already done, let th<" plac*
in the statute-book be pointed out If it is no*,
let us have no assertion to the contrary, and no
gross accusations, the support of which is at-
tempted by stringing together disjointed sentences,
and patting false constructions upon the official
statements of honorable, high-minded, and com-
petent men.
Sir, I ask your attention while I give a brief
expose, of the policy, and the result of that pobcy,
by which Swartwout was enabled to commit the
frauds which he did, and the embarrassments
under which the Secretary of the Treasury labored
in detecting him.
1 I believethemerchants' bonds were deposited
in the deposit banks in New York, so was the
amount of those bonds, when collected, to the
creditof the Treasurer of the United States. Swart-
wout made up hisaceount weekly with the banks,
on Saturday, at ten o'clock No account was ever
exhibited of moneys received by him for duties
between Saturday ten o'clock, and Monday morn-
ing. All moneys received after ten o'clock on
Saturday morning, and before ten o'clock Monday
morning, were not deposited; or, if they were,
they were deposited in his name, and to his in 
dividual credit, and drawn upon his individual
check This was the means by which a portion
of the defalcation was effected, and unquestion-
ably gtew oat of the couneeuon of the Treasury
