APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL
995
34th Cong.... 1st Sess.
Slavery Question—Mr. Sapp.
Ho. of Reps.
two hundred to two bund red and twenty-five legal votes
were polled, out of eight hundred and eighty-eight, the
total number given in the precincts or the ttftli district.
Ot' tbe legal votes oast, tlio free-Suite candidates received
one hundred and fifty-one." * * *   *
•• Sirtk District—Fort Scott—A company of citizens from
Ifissunn, mostly from Bates county, came into this district
tbe day oeibru the election, some camping, and others put-
ling up at tile public house, (147.) They numbered from
one hundred to two hundred, (148,> and came in wagons
*iul on horseback, carrying their provisions and tents with
them, and were (generally anned with pistols. They de-
clared their purpose to vote, and claimed the right to do so."
« •   «• So one Wiis challenged or swoni, and all voted
who desired to. Out uf three hundred and fifty votes east,
out over one hundred were legal, and but sixty-four of those
lamed in the census taken one month before by Mr. Barber,
the candidate for the Council, voted." «   *
•• SeceitiM District.—From two to three hundred men from
the State of Missouri came in wagons or on horseback to
tbe election ground at Switzer's Creek, in the seventh dis-
trict, and encamped near the polls on the day preceding
the election. They were armed with pistols and other
weapons, and declared their purpose to vote, in order to
secure the election of pro-slavery members." * *
'•The census list shows fifty-three legal voters in the district.
Two hundred and fifty-three votes were cast; of these,
twenty-five were residents; seventeen of whom were in the
district when tbe census was taken, (150.) Some of the
residents present at the polls did not vote, declaring it use-
less. Candidates declined to run on the Inee-State ticket,
because they were unwilling to run the risk of so unequal
a contest, it being known that a great many were coming
ftom Missouri to vote, (151.) Nearly all the settlers were
free-State men; and twenty-three out of the twenty-five
legal votes given were cast for tbe only free-State candidate
running. Mobiller McGee, who was declared elected repre-
sentative, bad a claim—a saw-mill and a house in the Ter-
ritory—and be was there part of the time. But his legal
residence is now, and was then, near Westport, in Missouri,
where he owns and conducts a valuable farm, and where
his family resides.
" Ei;ktk District This was attached to the seventh dis-
fciet for a member of tbe council and a representative, and
its vote was controlled by the illegal vote cast then. The
census shows thirty-nine votes in it—thirty-seven votes
were cast, of whom a majority voted tbe free-State ticket.'"
* * * * ******
" Tenth District.—This and the eighth election district
formed one representative district, and was the only one to
which the invasion from Missouri did notextend." * *
" Eleventh District.—Yourcommittee were unable to pro-
cure witnesses from this district. Persons who were
present at the election were duly summoned by an officer,
and among them was F. J. Marshall, tlie member of the
House from that district. On his return, the officer was
arrested and detained, and persons bearing the names of
so Die of the witnesses summoned were stopped near Le-
compton.and did not appear before the committee. The ]
returns show that, in defiance of the Governor's proclama- I
troll. the voting was viva voce, instead of by ballot. Three '
hundred and twenty-eight names appear" upon the poll- !
books, as voting; and by comparing these names with those
oa the census rolls, we find *hat but seven of the latter
voted. The person voted for as representative, F. J. Mar-
shall, was chief owner of the store at Marysville, and was
there sometimes, il56,) but his family lived in Weston. !
John Donaldson, the candidate voted fur for the Council, '
then lived iu Jackson-county, Missouri, (157.) j
" On the day afterthe election, Mr. Marshall, with twenty
Ave or thirty men from Weston, Missouri, was on the way
from Harvsville to tbe State. Some of the party told a
witness who hatt formerly resided at Weston, that they
were up at Marysville, and carried the day for Missouri, 1
and that thev had voted about one hundred and fifty votes.
Mr. Marshall paid the bill at that point for the party.
" There does not appear to have been any emigration into
that district in March, 1355, after the census was taken;
and judging from the best test in the power of your commit-
tee, there were but seven legal votes cast in the district, and
three hundred and twenty-one illegal." *   *
" Thirteenth District.—Previous to the day Of election,
several hundreds of Missourians from Platte, Clay, Boone,
Clinton, and Howard counties came into the district ill
wagons and on horseback, and camped there, (158.) They
were armed with guns, revolvers, and bowie-knives, and
had badges of hemp in their button-holes and elsewhere
about their persons, (159.) They claimed to have a right to
vote,from the fact that they were there on the ground, and
had, or intended to make, claims in the Territory, although
their families were in Missouri, (1H0.)
" The judges appointed by the Governor opened tbe polls,
and some persons offered to vote; and when their votes
were rejected on the ground that they were not residents of
the district, the crowd threatened to tear the house down
iftbejudgesdidnotleave, (161. The judges then withdrew, ,
taking the poll-books with them, (162.) The crowd then,
proceeded to select other persons to act as judjes, and the j
election went on, (163.)" * *«**
" But few of the residents were present and voted, (165,)
and the free-State men as a general thing did not vote
(163.)" * * * . * 11 The number of i
legal voters in this district was ninety-six, of whom a
majority were free-State men. Of these — voted. The ,
total number of votes cast waa two hundred and sixty- :
nine." !
" Fourteenth district—Burr Oak\jrrecincl—Several hun-
dred Missourians from Buchanan, Platte, and Andrew.
counties, Missouri, including a great many of the promi-
nent citizens of St. Joseph, came into this precinct the
day before^ and on the day of election, in wagons, and on
horse, and encamped there, (171.) Arrangements were .
made for them to cross the ferry at St. Joseph free of ex- j
pense to themselves, (172.) They were armed with bowie-
kmves and pistols, guns and rifles, (173.) On the morning
of the election, the free-State candidates resigned in a
body, on account of the presence of the large number of
armed Missourians, at which the crowd cheered and hur-
rahed, (174.) General B. F. Stringlellow was present, and
was prominent in promoting the election of the pro-slavery
ticket, as was also tbe Hon. Willard P. Hall, and others of
the most prominent citizens of St. Joseph, Missouri, (175.)
But one of the judges of election, appointed by the Govern-
or, served on that day, and the crowd chose two others
to supply the vacancies, (176.)" * * *   The free-
State men generally did not vote, (1SJ.)" * * *
" Doniphan precinct.—The evening before the election,
some two hundred or more Missourians from Platte, Buch-
anan, Saline, and Clay counties, Missouri, came into this
precinct, with tents, music, wagons, and provisions, and
armed with guns, rifles, pistols, and bowie-knives, and en-
camped about two miles from tlie place of voting, (188.)
They said they came to vote to make Kansas a slave
State, and intended to return to Missouri after they had
voted, (189.)
" On the morning of the election the judges appointed by
the Governor would not serve, and others were appointed
by the crowd, (190.) The Missourians were allowed to vote
without being sworn(191)—some of them voting as many
as eight or nine times; changing their hats and coats and
giving, in different names each time, (193.) After they
had voted they returned to Missouri, (193.) The free- State
men generally did not vote, (194.) though constituting a ma-
jority in the precinct, (195.) Upon counting the ballots in
the box and the names on the poll list, it was found that
there were too many ballots, (196,) and one of the judges
of election took out ballots enough to make the two num-
bers correspond, (197.)" ***«*«.
" Wolf River Precinct—But few Missourians were pres-
ent in this precinct, though some of them threatened one
of the judges, because he refused to receive their votes; and
when he resigned, another was chosen in his place who
consented to receive their votes, (198.)
" Protests were drawn up against the elections in the
various precincts in the fourteenth district, but on account
of threats that greater numbers of Missourians would be at
a new election should it be called, and of persohal violence
to those who should take part in the protest, it was not
presented to the Governor, (199.) Major Richardson, the
pro-slavery candidate for council, threatened Dr. Cutler,
the* free-State candidate, that if he contested the election
be and his office should be put in die Missouri river, (900.)
" The number of votes in the district by the census was
334; of these, 134 voted. The testimony shows that quite
a number of persons whose legal residence was in the pop-
ulous county of Buchanan, Missouri, on the opposite side
of the river, bad claims in the Territory. Some ranged
cattle, and others marked out their claim and built a cabin,
and sold this incipient title where they could. They were
not residents of the Territory in any just or legal sense. A
number of settlers moved into the district in Sie month o f
March. Vour committee are satisfied, after a careful anal-
ysis of the records and testimony, that the number of legal
votes cast did not exceed two hundred—out of seven hun-
dred and twenty seven. *** * 
"Fifteenth District—The election in this district was held
in tlie house of a Mr. Hayes. On the day of election a
crowd of from four hundred and eighty to five hundred men
(201) collected around the polls, of which the great body
were citizens of Missouri." * * * " The free-State
men did not vote, although they Jtelieved their numbers to
be equal to the pro-slavery settlers, and some claimed that.
they had the majority. They were deterred by threats
throughout by the Missourians, before and on tbe day of
election, from putting up candidates, and no candidates
were nin, for this reason: that there was a credited rumor,
previously, that the Missourians would control the election.
The free-State judge was threatened with expulsion from
the polls, and a young man thrust a pistol into the window
through which the votes were received. The whole num-
ber of votes cast was four hundred and seventeen. Of the
names on the poll-book but sixty-two are in the census
rolls; and tlie testimony shows that a small portion, esti-
mated by one witness at one quarter of the legal voters,
voted. Your committee estimate the number of legal
voters at eighty. One of the judges referred to certified to
the Governor that the election was fairly conducted. It
was not contestwl, because no one would take the respons-
ibility of doing it, as it was not considered safe; and that
if another election was had, the residents would fare no
better.
" Sixteenth District.—For some time previous to the elec-
tion, meetings were held, and arrangements made, in Mis-
souri, to get up companies to couie over to the Territory,
and vote (205;) and the day before, and on the day of elec-
tion, large bodies of Missourians from Platte, Clay, Ray,
Chariton, Carrol, Clinton, and Saline counties, Missouri,
came into this district, and camped there, (206.) They
were anned with pistols and bowie-knives,, and some with
guns and rifles, (907;) and had badges of liemp in their
button-holes, and elsewhere about their persons, (208.)
" On the morning of the election there were from one
thousand to one thousand four hundred persons present on
the ground, (209.) Previous to the election, Missourians
endeavored to persuade the two free-State judges to resign
by making threats of personal violence to them, (210,) one
of whom resigned on the morning of election; and tic
crowd chose another to fill his place, (211.) But one of
the judges—the free-State judge—would takethe oath pre-
scribed by the Governor; the other two deciding that they
had no right to swear any one who offered to vote,but that
all on the ground were entitled to vote, (212.) The only
votes refused were some Delaware Indians, some thirty
Wyandot Indians being allowed to vote, (213.) The free-
State men generally did not vote at that election, (219.) and
no newly-arrived eastern emigrants were there, (220.)" *
* * * * « The whole number of voters in tbe
district, according to the census returns, was three hundred
and eighty-five; and, according to a very carefully-pre-
pared list of voters—prepared for th« pro-slavery candi-
dates, and other pro-slavery men, a few days previous to
the election—there were three hundred and five voters in
the district,.including those who had claims, but did not
live on them, (222.) The whole number of votes cast was
nine hundred and sixty-four; ofthose named in the census,
one hundred and six voted. Your committee, upon careful
examination, are satisfied that there were not over one
hundred and fifty legal votes cast, leaving eight hundred
and fourteen illegal votes." * *   *  
"Eighteenth District Previous to the election, General
David R. Atchison, of Platte City, Missouri, got up a com-
pany of Missourians, and passing through Weston, Mis-
souri, (223^) went over to the Territory. Ife remained all
night at the house of , and then exhibited his arms, of
which he had an abundance. He proceeded to the Nemo-
haer (eighteenth) district; (224.) On his way, he and his
party attended a nominating convention in the fourteenth
district, and proposed and caused to be nominated a set of
candidates in opposition to the wishes of the pro-slavery
residents of the district, (225.) At that convention he said
that there were eleven hundred men coming over from
Platte county, and if that wasn't enough they could send
five thousand more; that they came to vote, and would
vote or kill every G—d d—d Abolitionist in the Terri-
tory, (236.)
" On the day of election, the Missourians under Atchi-
son, who wt rc encamped there, came up to the polls in the
eighteenth district, taking the oath that they were residents
of the district. The Missourians were all armed with
pistols or bowie-knives, and said there were sixty in their
company, (227.) But seventeen votes given on that day,,
were given by residents of the district, (228.) The whole
number of votes was sixty-two." *, * - * *
