HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,In the Field, June 22, 1864-4.30 p. m.

Major General J. HOOKER,

Commanding Twentieth Army Corps:

GENERAL: The major-general commanding says that General Howard cannot relieve any portion of your corps without moving the whole of his, and you will necessary have to held on with your breast-works, as he thinks you will be able to do, without danger, Schofield being on your right. You now have as strong lines as General Howard. To-morrow morning, if necessary, General Howard will move to the right and General Palmer will close upon him, though it seems as though every step of your advance would contract the lines.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WM. D. WHIPPLE,

Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,In the Field, June 22, 1864. (Received 7.20 p. m.)

Major General J. HOOKER,

Commanding Twentieth Army Corps:

GENERAL: General Palmer cannot at present relieve a division, because he is close under the guns of the enemy, and his movement would be perceived. As soon as darkness comes King's division will be sent to relieve a division of the Fourth Corps.

After riding the entire line and returning to a height on the Dallas and Marietta road, the major-general commanding can see that with every rod your right marched upon the Powder Springs and Marietta road the more will our lines be contracted. It is the turning off of your line to the southwest that makes is so weak at the present time. Moreover, your line is no weaker than General Howard's, and he has maintained himself against all attacks up to the present time. The division of the Fourth Corps will be sent to relieve one of yours as soon as it is relieved by the one from the Fourteenth Corps.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WM. D. WHIPPLE,

Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS TWENTIETH CORPS,Near Kolb's House, Ga., June 22, 1864-12 p. m.

Brigadier-General WHIPPLE, Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: I have the honor to report that the operations of the Twentieth Corps commenced with throwing forward Geary's division and driving away the rebels from some commanding heights about a mile in advance of my center. When this was accomplished batteries were posted to sweep the ground to the left to enable Butterfield to advance about the same distance and take possession of some wooded heights, which were held by the enemy, as it was believed that the possession of them would give us command of the Dallas and Marietta road, and that in rear of the enemy in front of the fourth Corps. Meanwhile Williams threw forward his right flank, driving the enemy before him, step by step, between two and three miles to the Kolb house, on the Powder Springs and Marietta road, his left connecting with Geary. This was the position of the corps at 2 o'clock. Soon after Hascall's division, of the Twenty-third Corps, came up on the Powder Springs road,
