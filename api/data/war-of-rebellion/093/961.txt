Lieutenant HENRY E. NOYES,

Aide-de-Camp, Second U. S. Cavalry:

SIR: In executing the order intrusted to you by Major-General Thomas you will proceed direct to Major-General Rosecrans' headquarters, at Saint Louis, where you will learn what has become of General Grierson's division. If it had gone to Memphis you will proceed without delay to that place and make the most speedy arrangements to have it forwarded here, and the detachments and trains belonging to it, as well as those of Hatch's division; this regardless of any orders, except such as may be issued by authority higher than that of General Thomas.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. H. WILSON,

Bvt. Major General, Commanding Cav. Corps, Mil. Div. of the Mississippi.

Captain JAMES A. STRONG,

Eighth Michigan Cavalry, Lawrenceburg:

I have just received your dispatch of this morning. Look out sharply for Forrest, and inform me and Colonel Capron of any movement you may discover. General Hatch reports that Forrest was advancing to Colonel Capron at once by the shortest and safest route. For greater security it will be well to send a party of men with it. Colonel Capron is ordered to move back toward Mount Pleasant as far as the intersection of the Lawrenceburg road.

Respectfully,

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.

PULASKI, November 20, 1864.

Move your command back toward Mount Pleasant, to the intersection of the Lawrenceburg [road]. Look out for Forrest on your left.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.

Major-General THOMAS,

Nashville:

The enemy's infantry was advanced this morning on the Butler Creek road, fourteen miles from Florence, moving by the right flank toward the military road, which will oblige me to concentrate at Lexington. I shall camp to-night on Bluewater Creek, on account of forage,
