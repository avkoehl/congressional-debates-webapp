PROTECTION OF THE ABORIGINES
SPEECH OF MR. TIPTON,
Of ÍNDIANA,
In Senate, April 18, 1838—On the bill to provide for
the security and protection of the emigrant and
other Indians west of the States of Missouri and
Arkansas.
Mr TIPTON addressed the Senate as follows
I am happy to find that we have reached this bill
in the regular order of our business. I consider it
the most important measme, with, perhaps, one ex-
ception, ef any that has, or is likely to come before
us at the present session of Congress. I feel much
diffidence in attempting to speak on any question in
this Senate, composed of members so much better
qualified to throw light on every subject they dis-
cuss than I can pretendió be, but the position I oc-
cupy here seems to make it my duty to submit a
few remarks explaining the views of the Commit-
tee of Indian Affairs, and my own opinion, on this
important measure.
On the success of this measure materially depends
the character of our Government, in regard to its
ireatment of the aborigines of our country, and
upon it also depends the existence of the Indians as
a separate and distinct race ®f people. The re-
moval of the Indians from the east to the west side
of the Mississippi, and of giving them a Govern-
ment and laws, has been the settled policy of this
Government for many years, it has been ably dis-
cussed both in this and the other branch of Con-
gress, and is, so far as, my information extends,
unanimously approved by the people The subject
has been favorablv reported on by the Committee
on Indian Affairs of the Senate at three successive
sessions of Congress, but the postuie of our Indian
relations for three years past, has prevented us
from urging it to a final decision I am happy to
be able to say that, in the opinion of the friends of
the measure, the time has arrived when Congress
should act definitely on the subject. "We think it
very desirable that this bill should become a law
before the present session closes
In the remarks which I am about to submit to
the Senate, I propose to say something concerning
the condition of the aborigines of North America
when our forefathers took possession of their coun-
try, of the effects of our laws regulating trade and
intercourse with these people, and to contrast the
cost of administering the intercourse laws among
our Indians with what will be the expenses of ad-
ministering the government under which it is pro-
posed to place them by the bill befoie us I hope
to be able to show to the satisfaction of the Senate
and the country, that a better form of Government
can be established and administered for them at a
saving to the United States of sixty per cent, on
the sums annually expended, as our law now stands,
for the Indians of the proposed Territory
I cannot doubt that, if we pass the bill, ancTif
the superintendence of the Territory, and the execu-
tion of the plan proposed by the Committee of In-
dian Affairs, be placed in the hands of experienced,
talented and honest men, the next generation of In-
dians in the territory may dispense with the agents
of the United Sutes, and become their own agents,
their own merchants, their own mechanics, manu-
facturers, legislators and lawyer —become a civil
community, depending on their oton exertions for exis-
tence, and independent of all others
It appears to me that in our system of govern-
ment no part is so imperfectly understood as that
which relates to Indian affairs, and none more ur-
gently calls for reform My residence for the last
sixteen years has been near the Indians, during
which time I have had the honor of serving the
Government m various capacities in ihe transact-
ing of business with them The relations which I
have sustained to the subject when in and near the
Indian country, and when acting with you m this
place, have afforded opportunities of becoming ac-
quainted with it, which few have enjoyed I should
have been dull, indeed, had I not by this time learn-
ed something in relation to this matter, and, with
what I have learned, I must now declare that I
should be an unfaithful Senator, and an unfeeling
neighbor to the Indians, were I to remain silent up-
on this occasion
Under the healthful influence of oar institutions,
there has, for a few years past, been a rapid in
crease of kind feeling for the suffering Indian*., and
almost every act of the Government, in relation to
them, is marked with increased liberality But, I
am sorry to say, that I know, from personal obser-
vation, that the benevolent designs of Government
towards this unfortunate race of men are seldom
accomplished We are conscious of our superior-
ity over them, we are not dependent upon them,
we do not fear them Still, we are not ihe less
kind towards them on account of our superiority
Were the United States Government capable of
acting towards the Indians from selfish motives,
destitute of kindness, and regardless of the princi-
ples of humanity, it could at once coerce them be-
yond the sphere of vexation, and beyond the ne-
cessity of legislating for them, But, in the pleni-
tude of our power, we are not regardless of their
interests, We legislate for their relief every year,
we are spending millions of monev, and are send-
ing numerous agents to relieve and pro'ect them
We discard the hateful principle of exclusive sel-
fishness. We are actuated by kind feelings to-
wards them, by a desire to do them good
Now, I know, sir, by personal acquaintance with
the subject, that, it ith slight exceptions, our well-
meant efforts have injured rather than benefitted
them. They who have had an opportunity of see-
ing the Indians at their homes—no, I recall the ex-
pression, for they have no home , but they who
have enjoyed the opportunity of witnessing the
effects of our intercourse laws and reguhtions on
them in the p'aces vihere they have existed—must,
I think, attest ihe trath of mv remark, while they
who have been at a greatei distance fiom them,
may infer its truth from the fact that, with all that
has been done for ihem, thej , as a people, hav e i ot
prospered It is tiue, a lew thousands oí them
may be classed with civilized men \et, taken as a
whole, a general decline, w Inch has been in pro-
gress ever since the white man first set his foot on
the American continent, has not been ane^ted—as
a people they are still perishing
U this position be true, what follows*   Why
sir, that we should change our policy towards them
This necessary change is intended to be provided
for by the bill now on your table
If there were not someihmg wrong in principle
m our former policy, and injudicious in its applica-
tion, ij^y has it resulted m d sappomtment* Why
have not the Indians prospered under it* Like
causes will produce like effects There are causes
which result m the improv ement of other people,
these causes hav e not been brought to operate upon
the Indian tubes, or the}, too, wou'd have been
improved, unless we believe, as some of the early
superstitious Spaniards believed, that the Indians
are unsusceptible of improv ement
With regard to mental abilitv we hav e no reason
to believe that they would suffer bv a comparison
with any other people Some minds are more oo-
tuse than others, and rece 'e instruction in the arts
of living, and in sablimei science, more slowly, but
it would be preposteious to suppose that a whole
nation of people were desatine of capacity to im-
prove their condition, and that generation after
geneiation snoukl pass away under these treniM
inabilities No such thing has happened in reg=ud
lo other people, and no such thing ev er snould have
Deen attributed to the aborigines of America
Are they not human beings, possessing all the
passions of rational man, and all the powers of
thought which belong to the human mind* If tney
are not of our stock—if they are nit tinman, why
legislate foi them m the manner lint v e do* Bin
we know that they aie hum-in hems: , posspssini
the faculties of human understanding, and it is no
less certain that they aie capaole of be ng im-
proved in thcr condition Tiit-ie miv exist cía i-s
to retard improvement, but not to render it m -
practicable II we ha\e sought their impiovement
unsuccessfully, it is because we have not sought
it by suitable means The failure is in conse-
quence of an error on oui part, and not because
the Indians are incapable of improv ement
The circumstances of men may be changed ,
Governments maybe destrojed, and others may
succeed them    Convulsions may remove moun-
tains, and fill their places with seas, still the laws
of nature remain unchangeable. If we were told
that fish had left the sea for want of capacity to
enjoy the element of water, and were breathing
upon land, or that fowls, which had been formed
to fly in the heavens, had become averse to air,
and were winging their way through the briny
deep, the boldest assertions would not be believed,
because they would be at variance with the known
laws oí nature. No le«s absurdity >s attached to
the conclusion, that though the Indians are rational
beings, they are unlike all other ratioi al beings
Hi regard to some mental or constitutional defect,
or, if they possess the  faculties and passions of
0 her people, they will nevertheless render them-
selves different from all, by chtosing a course
which others would not—a courss of wretchedness
during a brief existence, and ending in utter rum
Such things would be contrary to the laws of na-
ture as the}' operate upon rational beings, and
such absurdities ought never to have obtained
credence among eiviLzed men
Other nations, it is true, have disappeared, but
not from the causes to which Indian decline has
b> en attributed, to wit an inveterate aversion to
improvement, entailed upon geneiat on after gene-
ration, and which is to cont nu> until thev dis-
appear from the face of the'ar h nations mav
be conquered by others more powerful, and the
vanquished may disappear by amalgamation With
their conquerors, or may sink m*o oblivion under
then oppressions, but n ither of these causes
operates upon the Ind'ans They are not, at this
time, sinking under positive oppression, because,
on the comrarv, we are kind>y *eekmg their pre-
servation Neither are they disappearing bv amal-
gamation with their conquerors The) remain a

There is something painful m the reflection that
