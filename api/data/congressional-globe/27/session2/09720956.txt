CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
tbem against foreign rival products Beside distance
and expenses, which operate to protect oar own )a
bor and industry againn foreigs labor ard ln-
du try, every datv of even 5, 10, or §0 per cent,
furnishes, in its consequences, so much additional
protection    And if that duty be imposed in nearly
f horizontal form—as the Senator from Rhode
sland admits is fairest—and if ins. imposed equally
on foreign gram, wool,hides, cotton, &c , aswell as
on foreign cotton and wooll«n clo'hs, on iron, and
sugar, and salt—then the opportunity for favoritism
1$ excluded—jealousies are hushed-"-the revenue
increased—and aliare protected equally and inci-
dentally against rival products from abroad. This
n one great argument for raising revenue by a
tariff, instead of direct taxes, or other levies on
property; because thus only are you enabled to
yield incidental protection.
This bill, however, ins'ead of assuming that
equal character, pushes the duties in many cases to
100 and 120 per cent; while, in others, it keeps
them down to twenty, or under. It assesses
the very highest duties to aid manufacture ; and
the lowest, or none, when agriculture is in question.
Instead of curing what the Senator from Pennsyl-
vania objet-'ed to m my «cheme—that "French,
brandy and coffee might be taxed nearly alike"—it
taxes the sugar of the poor higher than tt e wines
of the rich, it burders the rolled iron, the coarse
cottons, the woollens; the salt used in eveiy ship
yard, and on every tarm, and in every log cabin,
more than the jewels and si'ks worn in the saloons
of wealth and fashion.
And am I to be invoked to give a preference to
so invidious a measure as this?
That Senator complains, also, of the ad valorem
rates of duty I advocate as being worse than spe-
cific ones, because the income from ttaeta would
fall off in embarrassed times under lower price .
But does he not see that expenses ought also to
fall off in such times, and lew. revenue be col-
lected? And does he not see, further, that the
owner of the goods, when they are worth less, is
less able to pay as high an aggregate duty on them,
as when they are wonh more? In that way of an
ad valorem rate, and m that alone, can taxation
approach equality on the importers of different
kinds of merchandise, and all be made to pay,
even m distressed times, no more than a propor-
tionate rate on ihe reduced amount of capital in-
vested in that kind of business. These statempms
are ample enough to vmdtca'e this mode, ralher
than a specific rate of duty, which makes the coar e
and cheap yard of flannel and cl< lb, as uell as the
coarse pair of shoes consumid b> the middling
classes, pay as ¡ugh an smoant of duty as the fine
and expensive articles of that kind worn only by
the wealthy.
Again, sir, on this side of the House we are re-
quired not only to vote for an unequal and direct
system of protection, (which we believe to be on- '
constitutional as well as inexpedient,) but to vote
for it in a bill purporting to be des gned for rais-
ing revenue, when the protection has so deranged
the duties imposed, by forcing tbem into gross ard
high inequalities, as, in many ea^es, to lessen the
revenue, and defeat that great and (with u ) para-
mount object of the whole bill. Are we, then,
compelled, by any pnrciple of coai'ty, o" patriot-
ism, or liberal ccucc-sum, v hen s^ kir>g to r<-i e
revenue a'one—whion i so much i <■ d d for meet-
ing current engagements ant1 re (eeming tie prts-
trate credit of lb.  Giverrment—a e v to be re-
quired to vote for a biP ivnich sacrifices that very
object, and sacrifice'- u also to -sid pno her, and an |
illegitimate one—of high protectio-i to manufac- '
tures?
Let it not be repeated ->s an apoligv, that the  l|

tlemen on this side of the question.
Stripped ot lhat excuse, the bill as a revenue
measure is much worse than the present laws
would be without it. It includes scarcely any new
article, and in many old ones it is so high as to
lessen their use, and thus cut off most of the income
from them It is thus a measure to dimmish rather
than increase revenue—one to lower, not raise
means to carry on the Government. Some have
calculated that not over twelve or thirteen millions
of dollars net, in the aggregate, are likely to be col-
lected under it I feel confident that the net ag-
gregate, for some time, will not exceed fifteen or
sixteen millions; while under the pre'ent laws
and low duties, the imports are likely to be so much
larger, and especially of those articles which are
highly taxed by this bill, ltwt the revenue would
probably reach eighteen millions yeatly You will
then, in all human probability, lose, in point of
revenue, by this bill, from two to three millions.
Do not let it be said that this is improbable, be-
cause the duties in the present bill are not so pro-
hibitory as we imagine' If not so, whv did you
refuse to adop1 the amendment which I offered
}esterday, to reduce all above fifty per cent next
year to that standard? If many are not above fifty
per cent, you would hate accepted that proposal,
even if you had not gone farther, and accepted the
rext one, to reduce them in two years afier to
twenty-five per cent.
Let none impute to us, also, an unwillingness to
vote supplies, or pass any suitable laws to carry
on the fiscal operations of the treasury We have
again and again offered to vote for laws to remove
all doubts about ihe right to collect revenue now,
we have offered bills for lhat purpose, and it is
you, and you alone, who have obstinately refused
to pass •hem in seastn, and thus remove those
doubts. We have been willing to amend this bill,
so as to collect more revenue than it now will, by
tax ng moit imports at a revenue standard of 25
per cent, and it is you, and you alone, who have
refused that large supply, and that aid, more ample
than this to restore public credit. It is you, and
>ou a'or.e, who have neglected, till so late, imper-
ative duties, devolved on you peculiarly, as hold-
ing tnumphant majorities in both Housfs, and
hence bound to present and pass, seasonably, all
necessary supplies
Mr WRIGHT further explained the condition
of his State, which had induced him to consider it
deeply connected with the ced't of the General
Government
Mr WOODBURY said that 1 e ro<e again, not
to comment on anything which had just faHen fiom
the Senator irom New York, but to add a few
words concerning the future, which he m'ended to
hat a submitted before.
I ft me warn gentlemen that, if they pass this bill,
the fiscal condi ion of the country will still con-
tinue witiiout adequate relief Not claiming any
'pint of prophecy, he was sull forced, from bitter
experience, to believe that the seeds of disease still
remained in your extravagant scale of expenses.
Taking back the lands, if they were properly ad-
vendee, would help -ome to meet the emergency,
but many of the duties in this bill are so prohioito-
ry, and the free list is s0 large in amount, that it
was idle lo expect a tevenue frcm b rth, sufficient
to defray twentj-"cven millions o£ ordinary ex-
penditure—oi even t«ent>-fi>e, twcnty-lhree or

w,th ir ¿ ian s, have furnished all diat ugat ,o be
expended, and, at the same tima, would yield am-
ple incidental, s eady, and uniform protection to
every great branch of industry at home, endangered
by foreign competition
The first act must be to lessen the expenses to
eighteen or nineteen millions, for ordinary pur-
poses. The next, to reduce some duties—now so
high as to yield little revenue ; and raise others—.
now too low to yield the revenue they might—as
well as to impose moderate duties, if more revenue is
needed, on some of the articles now free. Then,
and then only, can the ends of the year meet, wiih 
out ruinous loans in peace, or a miserable resort to
direct taxes, excise, stamp acts, and all their odious
tram of burdens
Mr CRITTENDEN: would not have risen to say one word,
had it not been for the observations of the Senatoi from New
Hampshne He was disposed to go as far as any one reason,
ably could be expected to go, for incidental protection in laying
on duties for revenue He had no iauft to find with this bill on
that score He believed the protection it would afford would
be no moie than that which might justly be considered inci-
dental to revenue He believed it was the policy and the in
terest of every country to shift the burdens of taxation from ita
own shoulders, and place them upon the foreign commerce of
other countries
He alwa>s listened to the Senator from New Hampshire
with that attention which was due to his politieal knowledge-
and experience He had heard the Senator say that, if this was
a bill exclusively for protection he would vote for it Didhs
understand the Senator correctly!
Mr WOODBURY said he must have stated the reverse, for
the reverse was his meaning
Mr CRITTENDEN took it for granted that the Senator's
meaning was as he now says, but his words were as he at first
stated them But was he to understand that the Senator wag
opposed to protection?
Mr WOODBURY explained that, if he had said what the
Senator fiom Kentucky at first stated, it was a mistake, his
meaning being the reverse But m answer to the Senator as to
his sentiments t,lth regard to protection, he would esplain that
he was friendly to incidental protection—not to that of one
class at the expcn3e of another, but equal protection to one in-
terest of the country as to another, and not exclusive protection
to favored interests
Mr CRITTENDEN Then this thing of equal protection to
ail, can amount to nothing but protection to none There could
he no such thing as that sort of protection* and so far, it was all
a delusion to talk of fostering the industry of the country All
protecting all, in a matter of this nature, seemed to he a strange
anomaly Who was to be the protector, and who the protected?
He could not, with all the ingenuity he was master of, distin-
guish between the practicability of the equal piotection to all
of the Senator from New Hampshire, and the free trade doc
trine of the Senator from South Carolina There was just as
much sense in the one as the other
In reference to the assertion of the Senator from New Hamp-
shire— thatj nothing, after all, would relieve the tieasury but
rigid economy ana retrenchment—Mr C reviewed the ex-
penditures of Mr Woodbury's admmistiation, and contrasted
these expenditures with tiiobe of the present Administration.
He also refei red to the vote given by the Senator frem New
Hampshne on the revenue bill of 1832, and to the sentiments
of the Senator from South Carolina, as expressed in 1816
He stated that he haa with reluctance been driven to the con
rhision of voting for this bill He could not be accused of
courting the favor of the Executive, by conforming to his will
but he had deeply weighed the condition of the Government,
and he could not oimg himself to wound his country with a blow
aimed at Mi   Tyler
The considerations which had influenced him were—first, a
deference to the decision of the House of Representatives, next,
the condition of the countiy He saw the v hole country in a
state of humiliation and distress—the manufactures ruined, the
revenue suspended, the laboring industry ot the country reduced
to m sery and destitution, and he asked himself, Can anything
be done to relieve this distress? Although we have a had Presi-
dent—a mischievous President—yet we have a glorious coun-
tiy and a glonous people, and the question is, What can we
do to ralbe this country and this people, from this dark mist of
distress? It is not Mr Tyler's country, oi Mr Tyler's Govern,
mem, it is our country, and our Government and, for its sake,
we should come up proudly, and give oui votes for its relief
He denounced the President here and would denounce him
everywhere, in language as strong as respect for public deco-
rum would warrant He voted for this bill with the intention of
also voting foi the bill on the fable—foi the repeal of the sixth,
clause of the distribution act Both bills should go to the Presi
dent Let his veto No 5 and his veto No 6 come ¡Who cared
for his vetoes? He (Mr C ) cai ed nothme for them His taste
had become so reconciled to vetoes that they did not now seem
half so I itter to him as he once thought them Let both bills
so to the President that he may have his wish gratified—of
having the two mpa^ures separated And let him give either,
or both his veto He could tell the Senatoi from New York
that tt e Pii'sident s acceptance of the one an J rejection of the
other, would not uproot the tree of distribution Itsgerme was
alive and could not be tolled by suspended animation
Who could look at this Senate and know these men, and
then look at him who is sup] o¡,ed capable of awing them, and
sa> there was among them one that could be intimidated by
John Tyler? He did not believe there was an office holder many
poat office of the Union that would be so intimidated Did he but
Lnow the sentiments of the people of the United States, he
would nevei have driven his party to such extremities as to
haveti appeal to his and their opponents, till they, in very
shan e were obliged [oturn away from his endearments

It was not a little painful to hear gentlemen opposite glory-
ing over the destruction < f the great measure of distribution
Hewastoldit was^but a trifle to each State Well, he knew
that the share which would fall to his own State would be Buffi
