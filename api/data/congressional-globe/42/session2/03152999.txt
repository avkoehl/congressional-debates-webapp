[ Mr. FARNSWORTH. But cannot the
r Speaker be authorized to do so by the unan-
l jrnous consent of the House?
i The SPEAKER. The Chair apprehends
i that it might be done by unanimous consent.
I- Mr. FARNSWORTH. I make the motion,

? sent to appoint a Speaker pro tempore for two
: days, to-morrow and the next day.
The SPEAKER. Is there unanimous con
sent given that the Chair may name a Speaker
pro tempore for Friday and Saturday? Of
course it leaves the question of a session on
Saturday to be determined by the House. If
the Chair hears no objection, he will, before
the close of to-day's session, name a Speaker
pro tempore for both sessions.
There was no objection.
Mr. D 1WES. Then the last order might
be rescinded.
The SPEAKER. The last order will be
rescinded. The Chair will name a Speaker
pro tempore for to-morrow's session and Sat-
urday's session, if one shall be held on that
day.

The motion of Mr. Dawes was agreed to ;
and the House accordingly resolved itself into
Committee of the Whole on the state of the
Union. (Mr. Scofield in the chair,) and re-
sumed the consideration of the bill (H Ii.
'No. 2322) to reduce duties on imports, and to
reduce internal taxes, and for other purposes.
The CHAIRMAN. The gentleman from
Tennessee [Mr. Maynaed] is entitled to the
floor.
Mr. MAYNARD. The gentleman from
New York [Mr. Wood] desires a moment to
make a personal explanation. 1 hope he will
he allowed to do so by general consent.
Mr. WOOD. I had the honor to address
the committee some days since on the bill
under consideration. In the course of my
remarks I animadverted on some of the offi-
cers of the War Department, who were selling
. the public property and accounting for the pro-
ceeds by becoming the purchasers themselves,
and unking such returns as in their judgment
was proper. I quoted from the letter of the Sec-
retary of War, Kxecutive Document No. "200,
page 23, to prove this allegation, showing that
General Albert J. Myer, the chief of the Sig
nal Bureau, had sold signaleqnipments belong-
ing to the Government, and that in the table
which he furnishes himself ii, is set down that
lie himself became the purchaser of those
equipments. I have this morning received a
letter from that gentleman, which I desire to
have read.
Mr. MAYNARD. If it would answer the
same purpose, it would save time to let, the,
letter be printed in the Globe merely.
Mr. WOOD. It is very short. I should like
to have it read.
The Clerk read as follows :
War Department,
Office of the Chief Signal Officer,
■Washington, D. 0., April 30, 1872.
, Dear Sir; Referring to statements quoted in the
utobe as made by you in debate on the 27th instant
in reference to sales of property belonging to the
signal service of the United States, it is proper to
Bay that you have been apparently misled by the
statement of Executive Document .No. 200. page 23,
'pl 18 incorrectly printed.
ibe sales made by this office in 1870 and 1871 were
ffi 10l^0re Almy, acting as chief signal
officer of the .Xavy, and wore transfers to the Navy
department (at cost price to the War Department,)
ot pioperty needed fur immediate use in the naval
service.
..There were no sales to the ehiet' signal officer of
tne Army.
I am, sir, very respectfully, yourobedient servant,
_ . . ALBERT J. MYER,
-ortgadier General and Chief Signal Officer Army.
Hon. Febnando Wood,
House of Representatives, Washington, D. C*
Mr. WOOD. I deyire to give General Myer
the full benefit of his explanation, stating at
the same time that I quoted from the official
document as printed for the use of the House ;
and that while it acquits him of being the pur-
chaser of these articles, it confers that honor
upon the signal officer of the Navy instead
of the signal officer of the Army.
Mr. DAWES. In connection with the same
matter, when it was before the committee the
gentleman from Kentucky [Mr. Beck] was
under the impression, and so charged, that the
Secretary of War had increased his expend-
itures by the amount of $8,000,000, which he
had received from the sale of arms, and had
covered bis deficiency by the appropriation of
thatsuin. The gentleman used this language:
"During tb© la&t fiscal year, iu defiance of that
law, the War Department, as is shown by the report
of the Secretary of the Treasury, expended $8,000,-
000 in excess of the appropriation, and sold arms to
the Ficnch to make good the deficiency, and the
proceeds of these arms are now deposited in the
Treasury to the credit of the Department, subject
to be drawn out by it."
I have here, sir, a letter from the Secretary
of War giving a statement of every expendi-
ture of the War Department during the last
year, and the act making the appropriation.
1 also have a% copy of the warrant on the
Treasury, which covers each of those expendi-
tures, and a copy of the warrant by which
$8,000,000 was covered into the general
account of the Treasury last November. These
papers I desire to have printed in the Globe.
There was no objection; and it was so
ordered. The documents are ns follows :
WAR DH-PAKT.Mfc.vr,
Washington City, April 29, 1872,
Dear Sir: I send herewith, in accordance with
your verbal request of to-day, a statement in regard
to the amounts received and disbursed by this
Department on account of the appropriation for
ordnance, ordnance stores, &c.. for the fiscal year
ending J une 30,1871.
Hon. Mr. Beck, in his speech in theHouse of B ep-
resentatives on Saturday last, remarks:
"During the last fiscal year, in defiance of that
law, (act of July 12,1870,) the War Department, as is
shown by the report ot the Secretary of the Treas-
ury, expended $8,000,000 m excocs of the appropria-
tions and sold arms to the French to make good the
deficiency; and the proceeds of those arras are now
deposited in tbe Treasury to the creditof that
Department, subject to bo drawn out by it.'"
Mr. Beck is in error at all points.
In the first place, the War Department did not
expend any sum in excess of appropriations made
by law, and therefore it had no deficiency to make
good.
In the second place, it did not sell arms to make
good the deficiency.
In the third place, when ordnance and ordnance
stores, are sold, the proceeds must be paid into
the Treasury to the credit of the appropriation made
specifically for ordnance, ordnance stores, <fcc., and
could not be drawn upon exeept for expenses lor
ordnance, ordnance stores, «fec., alone. Therefore,
even if there were a deficiency or overexpenditure
on other accounts, the money to the credit of ord-
nance stores, &c., could not, by any possibility, under
existing laws, he used to make it good. And this
rule applies to all appropriations. All money must
be usod for the specific purpose for which it is appro-
priated and no other.
In the fourth place, the proceeds of the sales
referred to aro not now deposited in the Treasury
to the credit of the War Department, subject to be
drawn out by it. as stated bv Mr. Beck, but, on the
contrary, they were on the 24th of October, 18/1.
carried to the surplus fund, by warrant No. 119,
(copy herewith,) and can no more be drawn upon by
the War Department than if the money were not in
existence. It stands no longer to the credit ot the
War Department, but has gone into thegeneral lund
of the Treasury, subject to the action of Congress
alone. . ,
Lastly, if any one supposes that either previous
to the fiscal year 1870-71, or thereafter, any money
has been improperly expended by the War Depart-
ment in excess of appropriations, let the matter be
investigated.
