expcnmcnts, until the morning sun of Monday ehall find me yet |
«rugghng against youi traned party pht'a <x ind vuiir rea ty i
doers of Execu ive bidding Sir, the k s orv oflree legisla ion
furnishe* no parallel f «• thisir-dtcent haste But'wodayssince,
the President seat us a special message demanding moie mo
ney, not submitting to us, the immediate representatives of tiie
people, who, under the Constitution, are authorized to íaise mo-
ney fur the support ot the Government in uur own way and man
ner, but m a special and particular mide, imu9ualaudextiaor
dinary; the reissuing often millions more of Ti easury notes
And, sir, what is doaei forthwith your favorite investigating
duelling report is, by the very men who got it up for party pur
po<«es, laid on the table, and now you find gentlemen here ready
to vote, who have not been seen heie for a week The shibbo-
leth of the party has gone forth The faithful troops are m the
field, and before midnight the battle is to be fought and won
But, sir, before the deed is done, I am resolved that my consti-
tuents and this nation shall know something of the actings and
demgs of the men in power, who are now abusing the confi
dencerep'sed mthem by a confiding people
But, before I proceed io the consideration of the meuts of
th s bill, (if aay merits it have,) I feel it my duty to pay my re
spectsto the gentleman from South Cai .dma, [Mr Rhett,]
who has just poured out his whole stock of vulcanic lava upon
monopolies, aiistocrats, banks, Whtgs, Federalists, with all the
cant of an unfledged and newborn modern Loco Foco I)<mo-
crat Mr Chairman, have you nevu observed that, as in the
Chtistian so in the poftucal world, H is the latest convert who
makes the most iioib**, and that he is all the while laboring to
show by his works that he is entitled to promotion and the
confidence of his associates? The gentleman from South
Carolina, without any auihori'y other than what he draws from
hi* own imagination, has attempted to prove that we who aie
opposed to this bill are desirous to emhanass the Government,
to withhold the supplies, and impan the public credit and the
national honor And, sn, in the full measure of his denuncia
non, he boldly charges upon us that, like the Federalists dunng
the late war, we have combined with the banks and the an to
crats to war upon the Executive and his Administration
What act, sir, done 01 omitted to be cbnc, has authorized tfe
honorable gentleman to attnbute to the opposers of thin bill
any such motive or pui poseí Is it because we will not silently
suomit, with our arms fulded, to pass this bill in the fuim pic
scribed by thp Executive, without stopping to lnquit whether
for good or for evil, that we are thus unceiemoniously de
nounced by one who has just' entered theseivicel"
It does seem to me, Mi Chairman, not a little strange that the
honorable gentleman, who, wnhiu the recollection of us all,
was among the foremost in the ft on t rani with his unfurled
nullifying banner, ready to legist even at the point of the
bayonet, certain supposed encroathmeRLs of Fedeial power,
unauthorized, as he believed, under the Constitution, should
now indulge in such haish sentiments with reference to thotc
who are found in their proper p aces, opposing wnh all their
constitutional and moral power the passage of a law which
they believe so full of mischief, and of such doubtful constitu-
tional authonty' Yes, sir, the honorable gentleman is not con
tent, m the fulness of his new boi n zeal, with his thundering
philippic against the opposers of this bill, but he threatens the
bantes with mobs, and we aie told by him that the "mighty
contest for power and mastery is between the banks and the
people," and that, unless the 'banks coat,'1 their hos ihty to
w irds the Government, the people, m the majesty of then pow-
er, bur-nng with patriotic indignation, may raze their marble
columns te the ground, and scattei the contents to the winds '
Sir, has it come to this, that here, in the American Congress, doc-
trines soievoiutionaiy, so full of mobociacy, bo well calcu'ated
to encourage Uwles-- lapinc apd plot der, shall be uttered by
arepitentative in his place, as the only aignment why we
should at once, and without de ay, grant the President more
money' I trust m God he speaks his own, and not the sentí
meats of his new allien I hope, for the honor of my country,
that he stands "solitary and alone" mhi«gloiy Bu-, sir, the
honorable gantlereian has wholly mistaken the pa Wits in this
great contest of which he has apo¿en It is not a war of the
banks against the Government, but a wai between the office
holdeis on the one side, and the people on the othet, a struggle
on the partof an insulted people a^amot those in power, whe
have abused the confidence of the people,and who aie endea
vonng to separate themselves in their monetary loncuus horn
all thaf belongs to their future pro*penty rnd destiny Mr
Chairman, these banks are n > handings of mine I have had
no agency m creating them. The people have found out who
has You induced them to aid yon in destroying the United
Siates Bank by promising them a better currency You told
t>e"n theS ate b«iMks would furnish , they listened to your ad
vice, and confided in youi opinions and promises You deceived
them, and wile spieodrum is the consequence 1 lien, sn,you
prom sed them gol 1 and Silvei Where is ft? And now, when
by yourown fotly you have ruined the people, and bankrupted
youi own Government, you are demaifdmg irredeemable i rea
surv iwtes, to enable you to live a few shor' days, before the
tornado of public opinion comes to sweep you fiom your poli i
cal existence

known wishes of your constituents, dare accept of the piopo i

loiw as there is a do'lar left in the Treasury And, sir, if 1 might

eantleraan from South Cuohna, if he should be so fortunate as
to get ba khere in December next, that instead of commai uW,

at the hand  of m> cotí a^.ie, rjli  MjBMErsiS,] it ife cruel te add
to the sum of i is nfihctinns    And now, sn, for th  honorable
gentleman, the   cbaumau of the  Committee of Ways and
Means, [Mr  Camiuíeleng,] and before I  proceed to examine
hie. budget of biandet , I beg l.ave to refei  tne committee to
the message of the President at the opening of this session
Th« President informed us, m almost the very first sentence of
his message, that liw& are blessed with domestic tranquillity,
andall the dements ef national prosperity," and, Mr Chan
man, I am curious to   kmw of what these elementa are com
posed    Do you find "all ihe elemen'sof national prosperity"
m that commerce which but yesterday covered every sea, and
wafted the rich productions of our soil to every clime and coun
try?   Do you find these "cleme its" m the now deserted but
once pros terous manufactunng establishments of the North
and the East and the West1   Di you find them, sir* with (hat
meritorious but persecuted cla-s whom you have denominated
the "aristocracy of wealth, ' the merchants/    Do you find
them, sir, m the depressed value of ihe produc.s of the South
and th* West?   Or are tVey fountl abiding with the mdustirous
mechann and laboring man, who have mtuisted all their politt
cal power in >our hands, undei promis.es made to his ' ear,
but broken to Ins heai ,' and who are now burning with mdig
nation, demanding of j ou, in the name ol their suffering wives, ,
and children, to cei^e your experiments and return to the sound
principles of our father?   Sn, your experimenta mdv be sport
to you, but they aie death to my constituent     The President,
who íeposcs upon hi-  oTtom in, or lounges upon his sofa, m the
UU enjoyment of twemy five thousand dollars of the people'-,
gold, knows nothing, feels nothing, in common with hissuffei
mg constituents     They pe'ition him for  relief, and he tells
them  that " all communities are apt to Iwk to Government
for too much "   What, «ir, insult the people by telling them
that they are not to look to their own Government—institutions
of theiroifftcieation—to the men who hold office by the tcmne
of then will— that they hi. e nothing to hope fiom that Go
vernment m tunes of sutfenng an 1 distress '   And above all,
sir, not content in adding msutt to injury, that he will separate
hims If and hie Government fiom  the people, and take for
himself and his (a thful oftue holders all the gold and siíver,
loa/ing foi  iht. jieople, his maeteis, nothing but depreciated
rags'
Mr Chairman, u is no wonder the people are sweeping all
before them, wi henng you likeaSynan sirocco, for cursed,
tin kg cursed Fay I, be that Administration whose policy tends
the poor man s wile and children eupperless to bed, and, sir,
all the peopl* will eiy amen '!
Now, ''ir, for the chancedor of the exchequer [Mr Cambhe

our poor constituents leao wita joy ->tand aside anl listen to
this syien song of better times and bttter days, for a second
Daniel has Lome tojudgment' Yes, sir, we are solemnly m
formed by tne financial organ of this House, that we have pass
ed the Rubicon, that another shower of BntishgoJd is connmr
Prepare your silken purses, ye credulous people, and let the
"interstices' be large, that you may cettamly see it But let us
see whatare these lutheitu unknown "elements " The chair-
man of the Committee at Ways and Means says they are com
mg, because the Bank of England has, for th* purposes ofspe
culation, scntovei a lew millions ol her gold on loan to our
me i chants, (which she will reca'i whenever it is her interest to
do so,) and because the little Queen Victoiia has established a
Mceioyalty in Canada and sent over a few men and some mo
ney to subdue and keep m subjection the revolutionary f-piutof
the people oi tañada, and because the hta'es, or some ofthem,
hive sent to Europe the  bonds, and have got tbe money, be
cause the Legislature of isew York have authonzed pnvate
free bankiriK, and last, though not least, this Administration has
remained fnm to us purpose therefore, all will be well, and
the country ie¿tored to its former prosperity ' These, Mr
Chairman, these, s.r, are statesmanlike, elevated, dignified,
comprehessive views of piospenty, to come from the financial
premiei of this Administration IIuw ulmirahly willthohono

Mean  that tht bill now under consideration is designed foi tern
poiaiy pur wws onh, he told us the sarte story et the extia ses
sum He tiun informed us and ao did the Seeietary of the
Treasury, that if we would grant the power to issue ten mil
lions of Irtai-ury uwteb, he would not call upun us igan , anil,
sir, U would gne m>i no surprise if, befoie the end of (hie sí s
«Jion, we aie called upon for ten millions more The Secrttary
of ttie Tiessuiy gave Ub directly to undeistand, at the exti i
sesfeion, that the ieeources and revenues of the Government
would be ample to meet all the claims of the public créditon
It turns out not to be t>o, nor i& it the rust time that the fcecii/ary
has himself been deueived, and deceived tte, as I wih bho*v \va
hereafter A.nd o iw sir, what is the fact? The President
sends us a «peLi ti messaao state* thatheniu'-t have money
forthwith some of his lanhful officeholders are m need no

that has brought on ihjs serious embay¡assmevt ' orisps

of the Treasury, that he designed to issue lrca?iu> notes, wi i
out mteiest, to mattf them a currency, and because I then be
lie ved, an I am now confirmed m opinion, thatit was the del ¡be

to be managed and cantrolled by the President and his fríenos

again and again. Indefinitely, at the will and pleasure of the
Secre ary, ud, sir, with a landing capital of ten millions, and
ample powor to kite from one sub treasurer to another, who
could tell when the day of reckoning would come, tiie extent of
the d-bt created, *md the amount of money wasted and
exoended'i
t he bill, as reported at the extrasession^ was designed to be
connected with anouier favorite measuK of this Administration,
the Su,b Treasury, to be dovetailed upon it, as is evident from
the fact that these notes were proposed to be issued by the
Secretary without interest, and mi sums as small as twenty dol-
lars T is bill, sn, contains no express prohibition against the
reissue of these notes, all the power you desire is embodied m
this small bill, and if you can hasten it through to night, and dare
vote down alt amenthnems, or gag us with the previwus ques-
tion in the House, (as I have no doubt you will ) or force ua to
leave this hall by your continuous night sessiofi, then, sn,
you will have accomplished all you want But, as I told you
before, by the blessing of God, I will watch every footstep, and
be with you at the life oi death of this measuie, come when
it may.
The Secretary of the Treatury informed us, in hia report of
Decembei last,
' That it now appears piebab'e that, during the next yeai,
means will be pov>essed, without any permanent loans recall of
former deposites, or increase of taxes, sufficient to redeem sea-
sonably the Treasury notes that become payable, as well as to
meet all ordinary appropriations "
How admirably haa this Secaetary piedicted' In less (han
Bix short months theieafter it not only "appears probable," but
is absolutely certain, that this Government, wnh her ten mil
lions of Treasury noies, is not only out of money, but actually
out of notes ant) wc aie informed by the President that some
means "must Ik selected that can be made efficient in its ope-
rations at a very cai ly day, or it xcill bt impracticable topi e-
se/ve the ?iaii&natfaith unbro! en "
Mr Chairman, there i« a strange discrrfancy in the state
ments of the Secietaiy of the Treasury and the chai man of the
Committee of Ways and Means, that, to my mind, is wholly un-
intelligible The chairman of the committee states that the sum
expected to be realized from banks, merchants' bonds, and the
bonds executed by the Bank of the united States, on account o(
tl e Government stock in that institution, falling due in Octobei,
i  ten millions of dolíais Now sir, what says the Secretary m
his report, made m obedience to the order of this House on the
2Gih March last1  He states the actual amount in the deposite
hanks to be ($4,609,000) four million si ? hundred and nine thou
sand dollars Here are the naim s of the banks, a nd the amount
in each, but I will not tumble the committee with reading them
off He "tateo, m his repo-t of December last, that the bond
payable by the United Sta'e¡s Bank in September, 1838, is
($¿293,121) two million two hundred and ninety three thousand
one hu uhed and twenty one dollars, and that the amount of
postponed merchants' bonds is four millions of dollars But,
under the provisions of the law of the extia sersion, only one
thud of the amount in the deposite banks can be collected, oris
expected to be paid and that si m will be (1 536,000) one million
five hundtftd and thirty six thousand dollars Tie en iro
amo jnt, therefore, which the ^ecietary can expect to comma d
from these sources is (S7,8^9,121) seven million eight hundred
and twenty nine thousand one hundied and twenty one dollars
and not ten millions, as the honorab'e chairman has so bold'y
stated Noi is this the only blunder, m the long catalogue,
which can be detected m the reports of the Secretary and the
statements of the chairman of the Committee of Ways and
Means
The President, not Ltowing much about the finances, (fcr    1
suppose he has had other things of fate todh?turbhim,)but, re-
lying on the Seeietary for correct information, says, i, his com
mumcation of the 10th instant, that he
'Submus a statement, prepared by the Secretaiy, by which
it appears that the United States, with over twenty eight mil-
lions m deposite with the States, and over fifteen millions due.
from individuals and banks, are, from the situation m which
those funds are placid, in immediate danger of being renf'creii
unasleto discharge with good faith and promptitude the van*
ouspecuniaiy obligation^of the Government "
\es Mi Chairman, tt-e airount of the "ifatementf prepai
ed by the Secretary is nothing more nor less thin a genera 1
sweeping ' statement)' without data for a auide, or fact for its
foundation We are not advised how much of this fifteen mil
lion? is in the banks, nor are we informed how much is in the
h mds of "tntbiiduals 'aril whe those individuals are Wo
kn >w, from the SeeiUary's foimer report, that the entire
amount in the deposite banks in March was (4 609 000) four
million six hundied and nine thousand dollars, and, from Ins
report m Decembet last, that the amount of pi^tpnned r>.ci
chants' bonds was four millions of dolíais, makirg, m the
whole, eight million six hundred and nine thousand dollars,
(8609,000) And jet, Mr, wi h 'he^e repoits beiore «* , the
chairman of the Committee of Ways and Yeans declare   m his
plate that we had 'stt millions due us from merchants"
and m" October last eight mzlltoni> fiom the drponte banks "
Who shall we U heve ihe Secretary or the chairman ot the
commiuee? But, Mr Chairman, if according to the.reportof
the Secretaiy, as furnished by the President we had "uj wards
of fifteen mtlhvns of dollars in ihe han dé of barks end in

in my place, before the assembled Represen ativesof th« peo
