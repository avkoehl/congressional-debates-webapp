ADDENDA.

GENERAL ORDERS, HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS, Numbers 3. February 12, 1865.

The major-general commanding desires to express to the officers and men engaged in the recent operation the satisfaction he has felt at the prompt, skillful, and spirited manner in which every duty imposed upon them was performed. While all did their duty, some were favored by fortune in being placed at the points against which the enemy's efforts were concentrated, and were thus afforced the opportunity of displaying conspicuously their soldierly qualities.
