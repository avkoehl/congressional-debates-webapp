Mr. Ould which you left with me, with duplicates of them prepared in my office showing what has become of the prisoners named in the lists so far as our records give the information. You will notice that a large majority of the persons named have been released or exchanged. A number cannot be found on our rolls. As I stated in my letter of yesterday all officers and men in our possession already exchanged will be delivered in a few days either in the West or at City Point. Among the prisoners of war there are several, Colonel Morehead and Doctor Dixon among them, who are charged with being spies and they will not be released till their cases are investigated. Colonel Morehead was arrested in Kentucky within our lines dressed in citizen's clothes. Doctor Dixon after having been released, being a medical officer, obtained passes for two different routes by misrepresentations. I cannot recall the other cases. governor Peirpoint is anxious that J. H. Trout, a member of the loyal Legislature of Virginia now in confinement at Richmond, should be exchanged, as he hoped Doctor Hughes would be reserved for this purpose. Select some suitable person to make an equivalent for him and effect the exchange if possible. I hope you will be able to induce Mr. Ould to release any surplus he may have over the number I send down to be fully covered by those who will be on the way from Sandusky. I inclose three lists* of Federal and rebel troops paroled in Arkansas though I have doubts whether you can make any use of them. Though there is no evidence of the fact the rebels were doubtless sent beyond our lines. General Wright, commanding Department of the Ohio, strongly urges the exchange of Private H. C. Lilly, Fourteenth Kentucky Cavalry, that he may accept the place of colonel of the regiment. The agent of Adams Express Company has been called upon for information relating to the box of jewelry forwarded by Colonel Dent for Captain R. R. Ross. His report has not yet been received. I will make inquiries in John H. Boyle, held as a spy, and will inform you of the facts when they are ascertained. I am not certain whether it was intended I would retain the three papers marked "Copy" and one marked "Memoranda" or not. I send them to you. If you do not require them please return them for future reference. I repeat my request to be furnished with the list of the sick and wounded of our officers and soldiers still confined in prisons and hospitals in Richmond and elsewhere.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. HOFFMAN,

Colonel Third Infantry, Commissary-General of Prisoners.

OFFICE COMMISSARY-GENERAL OF PRISONERS,

Washington, D. C., March 14, 1863.

Captain H. B. TODD, Provost-Marshal, Washington.

CAPTAIN: I have not yet been furnished by Mr. Wood, superintendent of the Old Capitol Prison, with a list of the prisoners under his charge who may be exchanged and I have therefore [been] unable to say at what time they will be ready to leave. I would like to have all things prepared for their departure as far as is practicable so that there may be no delay after I hear from Mr. Wood.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. HOFFMAN,

Colonel Third Infantry, Commissary-General of Prisoners.
