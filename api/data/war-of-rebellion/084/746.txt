LITTLE ROCK, ARK., August 17, 1864.

Brigadier General C. C. ANDREWS,

Commanding, Devall's Bluff:

You will order in the Fifty-fourth Illinois, and directed Colonel Geiger to send out one or more regiments of cavalry to guard the haymaking parties on the railroad. The First Nebraska Cavalry should have remained at the railroad. It is my intention to send out the cavalry again as soon as it is rested and prepared. The regiments on the railroad should get all shod up and ready to move on notice, the same as though they were in camp at the Bluff.

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

DEVALL'S BLUFF, August 17, 1864-4.30 p. m.

Captain C. H. DYER,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Little Rock:

It was my purpose to send the Eleventh Missouri Cavalry to relieve the Fifty-fourth Illinois as soon as it arrived here. Unless I have the Fifty-fourth or some other infantry regiment here, work on the defenses must stop, the veterans of the Sixty-first Illinois having gone on furlough. Major Brown, Eleventh Missouri Cavalry, has just come in with the detachments left on the railroad. Where his authority to move originated I have not yet been able to learn.

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

LITTLE ROCK, ARK., August 17, 1864.

Colonel RYAN,

Commanding, Lewisburg, Ark.:

Send the Twenty-ninth Iowa and Marr's battery to this place, and also all the horses and supplies you have, except enough for thirty days for the troops you will have left. Keep the rest of your command in condition to move, in case of approach of superior force. Provide means for crossing the Arkansas in case you should have to retreat that way. I do not think that you had better send down the sick of your remaining command, unless they would be better cared for here. In case of evacuation they could be left at Lewisburg, but only few medical supplies should be left with them. We have no particular news of the enemy's movements. It is intended to make Lewisburg only an outpost for the present. Do not let any one but commanders know of the proposed movement till it commences.

E. A. CARR,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF LITTLE ROCK, Little Rock, Ark., August 17, 1864.

Colonel POWELL CLAYTON,Commanding, Pine Bluff, Ark.:

A reconnaissance of 300 or 400 going toward Princeton to-morrow. Co-operate, if you can, by sending toward Mount Elba or Jenkins' Ferry. We intend to try to get out the corn below here on the north side. It would be well for you to operate freely to the north and east, going as far as possible down the river on the north side.

E. A. CARR,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
