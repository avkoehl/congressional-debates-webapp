The Secretary having read a portion of the
report,
Mr. CONKLING. I wish to suggest to the
Senator from California if the bill remains
mainly unchanged, as the report of this com-
mittee lias been read twice before, it is un-
necessary to read it over, but let him state
any change that has been made since the last
report.
Mr. COLE. There is a new portion of it in
writing which can be read.
The Chief Clerk read that portion of the
report which relates to the thirty-fourth amend-
ment of the Senate.
The report was concurred in.

R. No. 2617) to lemove the legal and political
disabilities of Sion H. Rogers. 1 will state
that Mr. Rogers has been elected a member
ot the other House, but he cannot, be sworn
until his disabilities are removed. I ask
unanimous consent to put the bill on its pas-
sage. It has passed the other House.

that never ought io pass. I shall have some-
thing to say on that, subject.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The bill will be
placed oti the Calendar.
JUDICIAL DISTRICTS IX NORTH CAROLINA.
Mr. POOL. I ask that I be allowed to call
up a bill for present action in regard to the
western judicial district of North Carolina.
It is a local matter, and it is important thai
it should be acted on promptly.
The VICE PRE31DEN T._ Pending the
Post Office appropriation bill, the Senator
from North Carolina asks leave to call up a
bill reported by him yesterday from the
Judiciary Committee to establish a new judi-
cial district in North Carolina.
Mr. WINDOM. I willyield to this one bill
if it gives rise to no debate. If it does I shall
insist on the regular order.
Mr. POOL. I think there will be no debate
on it. It is House bill No. 2192 to establish
a western judicial district of North Carolina,
reported by the Committee on the Judiciary.
Mr. DAVIS, of West Virginia. The Sen-
ator from Illinois who objected yesterday is
not present.
Mr. BAYARD. I object.
The VICE PRESIDENT. Objection being
made the bill cannot be considered at this
time.
PETITIONS AND MEMORIALS.
Mr. JOHNSTON. I ask unanimous con-
sent to take up House bill No. 2048, It will
only take three minutes.
Mr. WINDOM. There is so much confusion
in the Hall that I cannot hear.
The^ VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator

lar order.

REPORTS OF COMMITTEES.
Mr. PRATT. The Committee on Pensions,
to whom was referred a petition of soldiers of
the late war, praying an increase of pension
to those who are permanently disabled by loss
of limbs, or of both eyes, have had the same
under consideration, and have directed me to
report a bill in conformity with the prayer of
the petition.
I will state for the information of the Sen-
ate that this bill amends the first section of the
pension law of the 6th of June, 1866, which
fixes the different rates of pensions for persons
disabled in the military and naval service of
the United States. To tho first class, embrac-
ing those who have lost the sight of both eyes,
or who have lost both hands, the old law gave
a pension, of twenty-five dollars a month. This
bill increases that pension to thirty dollars a
month, or twenty per cent. The law of 1866
gave to those persons in the military or naval
service who had lost both feet, or who had lost
one hand and one foot, twenty dollars a month.
The present bill increases that pension to
twenty-four dollars a month. The law of 1866
gave to those persons who had lost one hand
or one foot a pension of fifteen dollars a month.
This bill increases the rate of pension to eight-
een dollars a month. As this bill is one of
general importance to thi3 unfortunate class
of our fellow-citizens, I ask that it may be
printed.
The bill (S. No. 1073) increasing the rates
of pension to certain persons therein described
was read, and passed to the second reading.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The bill will be
printed, of course, under the rule.
ROBERT A. MAYO.
Mr. JOHNSTON. I renew the request to
take up and consider House bill No. 2048.
The VICE PRESIDENT. Does the Sen-
ator from Minnesota object?
Mr. WINDOM. I agreed with the Senator
from Virginia that I would not object if it did
not give rise to debate.
The Chief Clerk read the bill (H. R. No.
2048) for the relief of Robert A. Mayo, of
Richmond. Virginia.
Mr. EDMUNDS. I do not think when we
are on the Post Office bill we ought to take
up claims bills unless there be something
peculiar.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator
from Vermont objects, and the bill cannot be
considered.
BILL INTRODUCED.
Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN asked, and by
unanimous consent obtained, leave to intro-
duce a bill (S. No. 1072) for the better pres-
ervation of harbors, havens, roads, channels,
navigable rivers, lakes, and other navigable
waters within the United States; which was
read twice by its title, referred to the Com-
mittee on Commerce, and ordered to be
printed.
POST OFFICE APPROPRIATION BILL.
The Senate, as in Committee of the Whole,
resumed the consideration of the bill (H.
R. No. 1070) making appropriations for the
service of the Post, Office Department for
the year ending June 30, 1873, the pending
question being on the amendment of the Com-
mittee on Appropriations, in line eight of
section four to strike out "$500,000" and
insert 'â€¢ SI,000,000 " as the appropriation
for "steamship service between San Fran-
cisco, Japan, and China."
The VICE PRESIDENT. On amendments
to this bill debate is limited under the new
rule to five minutes by each Senator.
Mr. POMEROY. I have some reports to
make, but I will delay them until to-morrow,
the morning hour to-day having been other-
wise occupied.
Mr. STOCKTON-. I do not rise to address
the Senate; but I think before the vote is
taken on this amendment it is proper I should
let the Senate know that I intend, when the
opportunity occurs, to offer the following
amendment. After the word "construction,"
on the seventh page, in the sentence, "that all
steamships hereafter accepted for said service
shall be of not less than four thousand tons
register each, and wholly of American con-
struction," I propose to add:
And shall be so constructed as to be readily adapted
to the armed naval service of the United States in
time of war; and before being accepted, the officers
by whom they are inspected shall report to the
Secretary of the Navy and the Postmaster general
whether this condition has been complied with.
I do not think that it is possible, without
making it very onerous to the steamship com-
pany, to build such vessels as we would build
for our Navy if we were building them for
that purpose; and this amendment, therefore.
