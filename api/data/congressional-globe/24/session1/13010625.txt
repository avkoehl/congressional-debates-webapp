Oo nsjn «¡n niteifeie upon this subject' It was
i,-iv evidtnt th\t tin re was not a State in tin
Union that had a redundant population, the great
complaint * ,s 'he want ot a more dense popula-
tion,  o as to enable every bianeh of industry
and of science to develop their full resource" 
By a referente to the last census, it would bo
seen that under the present system the emigra-
tion to the new Siatts was unpaialleled in the
annals ot history, fiom the foundation of the fit st
E?vpti n colony to the present day. He said
that every community was capable to bear and
sustain a certain weight of population and no
more, and that too r ipid an inciease of popula-
tion was as bad, or worse, than one too slow,
that to reduce the price of the public land in the
new States was to reduce the puce of land in the
old Stntes, and to render the rents and piofits
lefts valuable to their owners, which would be a
crvins injustice, not to be submitted to on the
part of the old Statts
Mr MiC was in fat or of distributing the sales
of the pu')hc lands to the several States, agreea-
bly to tedu.il population, because the President
his declared that internal improvement by this
Government shall cease, and said, whatever may
be thought of many of the measures of his Ad-
ministration, he thought that Andrew Jackson
would deserve a nation's gratitude for arresting
that system. It was not his purpose to revive
the discussion upon the constitutional power of
Congress to make internal improvements. He
would place the question upon very different
ground, that of the practicability and expediency
of the system It was known to the House that
a large portion of the people in the United States
believed that Congress has no constitutional power
to make internal improvements in the States. It
is also known tp this House that upon this ques-
tion the country is geographically divided; that
north of a certain line the people think that Con-
gress has the right to make internal improvements,
that south of the same line the people think that
it is unconstitutional to make internal improve-
ments Now, sir, what is the effect of this belief
on the system itself It is simply this: the sec-
tion of country that thinks Congress can exercise
the power gets all the money, and that section
that believes Congress cannot exercise that power
gets none. Under this system, the South was
made tributary to the North; the operation was
to enrich the North, and impoverish the South.
He said that, independent of any constitutional
scruples upon this subject, this would be a suffi-
cient reason to abandon the measure by this Gov-
ernment, as it was evident that no system that
would accommodate the agricultural and com-
mercial interests of all these United States can be
adopted.    But he would take a  more enlarged
view of the subject     He asked the chairman,
[Mr Maw, of New York,] whom he knew to
be expert in figures, if he had ever made a calcu-
lation of the sum that it would take to make a
proper system of internal improvement for the ,
accommodation of the variegated interests of the
United States'    He  had  turned   his  attention
lately to the subject, and from the most reason-
able estimate he could make, assuming the sum
made necessary by the State of Indiana as the
basis of his calculation, (and he was certain that
his calculation would come far too short of the
amount necessary,) it would take $300,000,OUU.
He would now put the question to honorable
members on that floor, who thought with him
that the executive patronage of the Government
was too great, whether they intended to  make
the executive officers of this Government, the
disbursing agenta of this vast sum of money'
Did theylntend to add this additional patronage
to the army of sixty thousand officeholders al-
ready quartered on their Treasury'    He stood
there in his^place, and gave it as his deliberate
opinion that to add that additional patronage to
the Federal Government, it would be too strong
for the liberties of the people. The State govern-
ments would be shorn of their independence; they
would be found prostrate and powerless at the
No. 40
fiet of this great cential power He had said '
that much money in the hands of designing poli-
ticians would be like a can<-tr upon the body-
politic, it would extend its roots into every con-
dition of society It would corrupt the people
themselves, the source and fountain of all polit-
ical power
Mr  MeC   said he would go for this mode of
distubution, because, in his pidgment, it would
strengthen the action of the State governments,
already, in his opinion, too weak for the action
of this     It would confine the action of this Go\ -
eminent to our foreign relations, the legitimate
object of its creation     It would have out State
governments to manage the  local and  internal
eoniems of the country     Our Federal Govern-
ment might then be regarded as the sht et anchoi
of American liberty, as an ample shield, behind
which we might stand  secure in the enjoyment
of our civil and religious lights     This Govern-
ment would then be like a kind mother, confei-
ring blessings on all, and oppressing none     He
had heard a singular objection made to this mode
of distribution by gentlemen professing to be State-
rights men, that to distribute the surplus revenue
among the States would destroy the independence
of the States     He thought tins a most extraor-
dinary argument to come fiom State lights men
Gentlemen might as well attempt to prove to him
that, if he were to gne all Ins propeity to his
neighbor, it would impoverish his neighbor and
enuch him, as to make him believe that, to strip
the Federal Government of twenty million dol-
lars annually of its patronage, and give it to the
States, would weaken the State governments and
strengthen this Government.   The argument was
too absurd to merit further notice.    He said he
would turn these gentlemen over to the arguments
of General Jackson on that subject, and he thought
they would find it much easier to make objections
to his arguments than to answer them.    These
arguments could be found in his annual message
of 1830    The danger of this distributing system
did not consist in weakening the State govern-
ments     If the system was continued for any
length of time, it would make the State govern-
ments too strong for the Fcdeial Government
He would never agree to make this Government
the agent to collect money from the people to dis-
tribute among the States, he would not be willing
at this time to distubute any moneys among the
States that had been collected under the revenue
laws, but the funds arising from the public lands,
not strictly a revenue fund, could be safely dis-
tributed among the States, and would be all that
Congress could prudently do at this time.    That
the excess of revenue, under the compromise bill,
might be properly expended in putting the coun-
try in a state of defense, and at the end of the
compromise bill bring the duties down to a rev-
enue standard, is the true policy of the country.
There was another advantage to be derived from
this mode of distribution, that it would increase
representative responsibility   What was the fact'
Gentlemen on that floor might vote away millions
of the people's money, and they never would in-
quire, why have you done so' owing to the fact,
he presumed, that the money had been taken from
their pockets by indirect taxation     But let this
I  money once assume a tangible shape, and be
placed in the State treasury to lessen their taxes,
and his word for it, the people's representatives
will be held to strict accountability for every dol-
lar they vote away; and this, in his humble judg-
ment, was the only mode to arrest this extrava-
gant waste of the public money
Mr McC had already said to graduate the
price of our public domain would be in fact a law
to place the public domain under the control of
the rich speculator, instead of our own Govern-
ment, which would exclude the poor people from
the country But he would ask the poor people
in and out of the new States to examine their
most favorite view of the subject, that is, to give
to the new States Would that operate to their
interest' Could they expect to gel the lands
from the State governments upon cheaper terms
than they could from this Government' His life
on it that the Sate governments would raise the
price of the public lands, were they ceded to
them The difference in the two Governments
is tins: that the State governments are generally
poor and needy, and would be under a continual
temptation to raise the puce of these lands to
enlarge then levenue íesources It is not so with
the Federal Gov unment, herTreasury is already,
like the mer Nile, overflowing its banks This
Government had, in íelation to the public lands,
been literally the guaidian of the poor people, by
keeping down the price of land, but let these
lands once pass into the hands of speculators, oi
in the hands of the States, and the case will be
different, they will be turned ovti from a kind
parent into the hands of Egyptian taskmasters.
The poor people would soon find that those
doctors had mistaken iheir disease, that their
impassiontd appeals addressed to this body in
behalf of the poor were nothing but empty dec-
lamation The system, if adopted, was to build
up a rich austocracy to lule the democracy of the
States He hoped the democracy of these States
would examine this subject carefully, and that
they would find it their inteiest to let these lands
remain in the hands of the Federal Government,
and that they will demand their just share of the
sales of the public lands, and apply the same
to works of internal improvement, or the educa-
tion of their children, oi to lessening their State
tax
He would now take a different view of the sub-
let    That he would vote for this mode of distri-
bution, because it was the only effectual mode of
making internal impiovements, and that internal
improvement was   the   most  effectual   way  to
strengthen the union of the States    He said Prov-
idence had blessed us with a variety of soils and
productions, and watered our beloved country
with innumerable streams for the delight and ac-
commodation of its inhabitants     A succession
of navigable waters forms a kind of chain around
its borders, as if to bind it more fiimly together,
while the most noble rivers in the world run at
convenient distances, which, when properly im-
proved, will give facilities for the tiansportation
of their various commodities    Gentlemen might
say what they pleased about the disinterested
patriotism of the Ameucan people being a suffi-
cient guaranty for the maintenance of this Union.
No man on that floor entertained a better opin-
ion of the patriotism of the people than he did,
but he thought it was taxing it too heavily to
suppose that it could of itself be sufficient to
accomplish that end     Man had read past his-
tory to little advantage to suppose that a countiy
situated like   this, combining a variety of cli-
mates, of pursuits, as well as of interests, could
be held together by such a frail tenure     In his
judgment,  that unity of interest was the only
effectual bond of union in any country     That a
community of feeling could alone bepioduced by
a system of canals and raih oads that would bring
our scattered population together.   He would not
give two hundred millions of money spent in that
way for national defense, for money enough to
line our Atlantic sea-boaid from Maine to New
Orleans with fortifications.    He was like Jeffei-
1 son and Jackson on that subject; he knew it to
be impossible to fortify a sea-coast of three thou-
sand miles, that fortifications would be useless
without armament, which would create a stand-
ing army strong enough to turn upon the coun-
try and destioy the liberties of the people     He
hoped the anxiety of gentlemen to get rid of the
surplus revenue would not bring upon the coun-
try a standing army in time of peace.    Some
gentlemen spoke lightly about the dissolution of
this Union as a thoughtless man does, frequently,
about death at a distance, but, for himself, he
should regard the voice that announced to him
the dissolution of this Union as the funeral knell
of departing liberty, and he would not stop to
inquire whether the North or the South would
suffer most under this fatal catastrophe.    It was
sufficient for him  to know that they were both
ruined, and the hopes of civil liberty extinguished
throughout the world.
Mr McC said he would now answer the ob-
jection that there was no money in the Treasury
to distribute By the Secretary's report of the
I receipts and of sums upon deposit m the banks
to the credit of disbursing officers, which had not
been expended, there was, on the 1st of February
last, #30,678,879 91 This sum cannot be touched
or lessened by any of the expenditures of the
