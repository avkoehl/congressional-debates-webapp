HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, Kingston, Ga., November 4, 1864.

Brigadier General J. M. CORSE,

Rome, Ga.:

You will have most likely two days to complete the payment of troops. Do you require hospital train to remove your sick and wounded? The general wishes you to reconnoiter with cavalry well down to Cedar Springs to learn if the enemy has watched Howard's movement for the Chattanoochee; also a party out about our old camp to ascertain if any considerable force has been back in that vicinity, and where gone to. Beauregard is about Florence, fortifying and laying still. Two of the transports captured on the Tennessee were burned; one has been recaptured, and the other and the gun-boat chases down the river toward a fleet coming up, and will be destroyed or retaken. No other news.

L. M. DAYTON,

Aide-de-Camp.
HDQRS. DEPARTMENT AND ARMY OF THE TENNESSEE,Lost Mountain, November 4, 1864.

Major-General BLAIR,

Commanding Seventeenth Corps:

GENERAL: I have had the roads reconnoitered and find the best and shortest to be to go two miles toward Powder Springs, and take a left fork, and then go straight to Kolb's farm, and thence straight to Smyrna Camp-Ground by the road your corps came over on its way north. Captain Duncan, of my staff, will guide.

Very respectfully,

O. O. HOWARD,

Major-General.

P. S. -I will send my headquarters train by the way of Marietta.

O. O. H.,
