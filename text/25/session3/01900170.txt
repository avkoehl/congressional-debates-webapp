on the question
Mr KING hoped his friend from Michigan
would withdraw his call foi the yeas and nays
He was opposed to the bill as it stood, and as the
author proposed to amend it, and should vote
against it in either shape But he would prefer
that the Senator should modify his bill to suit
himself, and tnen, said Mr Iv , let him go on to
explain it, and endeavor to make it palatable to
tile Senate
Mr NORVELL accordingly withdrew his call
for the yeas and nays, saying, that as he was op- [
posed to the bill in any shape, he was averse to
the Senate's taking a vote that would seem to
imply an approval of any punciple m it                 .
