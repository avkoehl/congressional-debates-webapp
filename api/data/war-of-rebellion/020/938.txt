HDQRS. FIRST MILITARY DIST. OF SOUTH CAROLINA,Charleston, May 11, 1863.

Respectfully forwarded.

In view of the possibility of an attack, with the present force in position, and the probability of it in case it is weakened, I would respectfully recommend that the order for the movement of troops from this command should be suspended.

From my own observations I am satisfied that the enemy is in force on Folly Island and entrenching. Thus far I have seen no indications of mortar batteries against Morris Island, but from his command of Stono Inlet, owing to the abandonment of Cole's Island last year by General Pemberton, the enemy can, with his superior transportation, attack either Morris or James Island before we could possibly concentrate a reduced force.

R. S. RIPLEY,

Brigadier-General Commanding.

CHARLESTON, S. C., May 12, 1863.

Honorable JAMES A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War:

Have ordered to General Pemberton, contrary to my opinion, Evans' brigade and one regiment, amounting to 2,700 men, leaving only 6,000 infantry available in whole South Carolina and Georgia; the other 1,000 will await further orders of Department.

General Evans reports two brigades of enemy on Folly Island yesterday. Please answer.

Richmond, May 12, 1863.

Honorable . PORCHER MILES, Charleston, S. C.:

The official returns show that a force of 15,000 to 17,000 effectives will be left in General Beauregard's command. I do not believe the enemy have that number; indeed not 10,000. The Mississippi is vital. I send from every point that can spare any troops.

J. A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War.

CHARLESTON, S. C., May 13, 1863.

Honorable JAMES A. SEDDON:

Other 1,000 men referred to in dispatch of yesterday form part of total given for this State and Georgia. The troops going will be hurried off as soon as practicable.

G. T. BEAUREGARD.
