Major-General THOMAS,

Nashville, Tenn.:

The following forces, besides those mentioned in your telegram, have been ordered to Nashville, viz: Three companies of Minnesota heavy artillery and two companies of the Forty-fourth Wisconsin Infantry. The other companies of this regiment will follow as soon as organized. There will also be sent to you three regiments from Ohio and three from Michigan. The two regiments from Pope's command are on their way. It was intended to send you A. J. Smith's command, but it will probably be required WEST of the MISSISSIPPI for some time. General Canby is very confident that he will be able to prevent any considerable rebel force from crossing to the east side of the Mississippi. Texas and Arkansas troops mutinies against the order to cross, and rebel authorities in these States have applied for its revocation. Price is in full retreat south.

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
