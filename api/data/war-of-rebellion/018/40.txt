WHEELING, April 3, 1862.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

We have lost an opportunity to capture the force at Camp Baldwin for want of horses to move the batteries under General Milroy. I ought to have power to order the means necessary to the movements of my troops, and I ask you to give it to me.

J. C. FREMONT,

Major-General.

WAR DEPARTMENT,

Washington, April 4, 1862.

Major-General FREMONT, Wheeling:

You will make requisitions for whatever you deem necessary for the troops under your command upon the Quartermaster-General or the chiefs of other departments or bureaus, who will receive instructions in relation thereto from the Secretary of War. This is the mode prescribed by law and regulation, and practiced by the commanders of all other departments. Experience proves that it is sufficient for all purposes, and the only mode consistent with a proper regard to public expenditure.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

WHEELING, April 4, 1862.

Honorable Mr. STANTON:

Your dispatch of this morning received. What I desire is that you will direct to be furnished upon my order whatever may be necessary for the troops under my command.

J. C. FREMONT,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS MOUNTAIN DEPARTMENT,Wheeling, Va., April 4, 1862.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

SIR: I ask your attention to the general condition of this department and to certain requirements which seem essential to the efficiency of its forces.

The quartermaster's department has been for a long time and still is greatly embarrassed for want of funds. Its credit is impaired by its indebtedness, which already amounts to more than half a million.
