Lieutenant-General GRANT,

City Point, Va.:

You have perhaps seen in the papers that ex-Senator Foote, with his family, attempted to escape from Richmond to Washington, adn that he was pursued and taken back. His wife and child are now here. Please give me the earliest information you may receive concerning him-what is likely to be done with him, &amp;c.

Major-General MEADE:

The latest intelligence from Wilmington is derived from Richmond papers of to-day, they say:

About fifty vessels are in sight, mostly opposite the former landing of the enemy. The weather is fair and the sea smooth. There was a report last night that the enemy's fleet had begun the bombardment of Fort Fisher. The War Department has no official information on the subject.
