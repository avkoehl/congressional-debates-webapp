Report of Colonel Nathan Wilkinson, Sixth West Virginia Infantry, commanding brigade.

CLARKSBURG, [W. VA.,] April 19, 1863.

GENERAL: We captured rebel Major [Thomas D.] Armesy last night about Johnstown. Our force was too small to follow up others, who are hid on headwaters of Hacker's Creek.

If you could send a squad there, and get Jacob Staucher for a guide, some of them might be caught.
