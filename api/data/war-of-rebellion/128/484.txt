The Macon and Western road forms a connection between Macon and Atlanta. This road ought to have fifty cars in addition to its present stock.

From Atlanta and Columbus the Atlanta La Grange and Montgomery and West Point roads connect the two places. The latter road ought with assistance that it receive from the Georgia road.

From Montgomery to Mobile the line is made up by the Alabama and Florida road of Alabama and the Mobile and Great Northern road. Each ought to have an engine and twenty-five cars.

From Mobile to Vicksburg the Mobile and Ohio and Southern roads form the line. The former have an abundant equipment and the latter is a present supplied by the Memphis and Charleston road now nearly out of use.

In addition to this to Vicksburg, we have the Alabama River from Montgomery to Selma; thence by rail to Demopolis, where there is a portage of four miles and half on the Tombigbee River; thence by rail to Meridian-eastern end of the Southern road to Vicksburg. This road, from Selma to Meridian is also supplies with equipments from the Memphis and Charleston road. The New Orleans, Jackson and Great Northern and the Mississippi Central roads form a line form Ponchatoula- forty-seven miles from New Orleans-to Water Valley, in North Mississippi. Each of these roads have an abundant equipment for present use. Much of it, however, is getting in very bad order, and extensive repairs will be necessary to render it equal to any great emergency.

On our northern border we have the Virginia Central and Orange and Alexandria roads connecting this city with Lynchburg. These roads, I think ought to have one engine and twenty-five cars.
