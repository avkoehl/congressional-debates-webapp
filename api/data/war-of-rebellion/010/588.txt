the Twenty-fourth Tennessee joined with us in firing upon them. Colonel Freeman, commanding a Tennessee regiment, with a squadron of cavalry, then moved rapidly to the left and opened fire upon their right flank. This, in conjunction with our fire in front, told with terrible effect, and they retreated, leaving many of their dead and wounded behind them.

We pursued them and had just formed on the fourth hill and in sight of their fourth encampment, when you returned to cheer us with your presence and to supply us with ammunition.

The remainder of the evening and during the next day [Monday] we fought under your immediate command. It is unnecessary for me to enumerate and recite the many charges and the many incidents that occurred on Monday, as you were in command and witnessed them all.

In conclusion, I beg leave to say that my men, though inexperienced, fought well and bravely, and never failed to charge or rally when I commanded them so to do.

As far as my observation went all the Tennessee troops fought well. So it was with the Arkansas troops, the Mississippi, the Kentucky, and the Alabama troops on the left. All of them fought nobly and gallantly and against great odds.

My regiment captured about 100 prisoners during the two days' fighting.

With great respect, your obedient servant,

BEN. J. HILL,

Colonel, Comdg. Fifth Tennessee Regiment, Provisional Army.
