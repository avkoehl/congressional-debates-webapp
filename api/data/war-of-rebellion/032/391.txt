HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF EASTERN ARKANSAS,Helena, Ark., July 9, 1863.

Rear-Admiral DAVID D. PORTER,

Commanding Mississippi Squadron:

ADMIRAL: I take pleasure in transmitting to you my testimony concerning the valuable assistance rendered me during the battle at this place on the 4th instant by Lieutenant Commander James M. Pritchett, of the gunboat Tyler. I assure you, sir, that he not only acquitted himself with honor and distinction during the engagement proper, but with a zeal and patience as rare as they are commendable. When informed of the probabilities of an attack on this place, he lost no time and spared no labor to make himself thoroughly acquainted with the topography of the surrounding country, and I attribute not a little of our success in the late battle to his full knowledge of the situation and his skill in adapting the means within his command to the end to be obtained. Nor can I refrain from mentioning that, after, Commander Pritchett, commanding a division of your fleet, was unusually efficient in procuring timely re-enforcements. Permit me to add, sir, that I can conceive of no case wherein promotion would be more worthily bestowed than in the case of Commander Pritchett, and it will afford me much pleasure
