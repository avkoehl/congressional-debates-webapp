Our old picket-line is re-established. The enemy probably occupy the peninsula; will find out. They left a number of their dead unburied. Colonel Harrison re-established the line, the enemy's skirmishers falling back hastily before him. The monitors and gun-boats are shelling our men on the front furiously, and the monitors have been engaging Pringle and shelling these batteries for two hours. Something must be done to drive them off. David's and floating torpedoes, &amp;c.

There is no change observable on our front. Monitor and gun-boat out of range of Pringle on flank of our skirmish lines. I have sent Colonel Harrison with 300 men on left to feel the enemy and report, if he can, their strength.

Colonel Harrison has felt the enemy on the left, and they have retired from the front, or on the left that they were intrenching yesterday, leaving spades, &c. The observatory reports that the enemy is heavily re-enforcing from Dixon's Island, and I have cautioned Harrison not to endanger his right flank. Have sent him a section of light artillery. The monitor and gun-boats are shelling our light battery in advance on the right, so heavily that I have directed it to retire. The enemy are strong, I think, on our right, and have a very disagreeable control of the country up to this point with their gun-boats and monitor, which are beyond the range of Pringle. The enemy's line of battle is form 1 1\4 to 1 1\3 miles to the front of our heavy batteries. It is in range of our heaviest guns, and we have been firing until now, but ammunition is too short to risk much occupying the end of this island but for the support of their ships, which we cannot control with our guns. Come over this evening. I think you can judge much better of affairs by looking at ground.

Colonel Black says Colonel Yates is apprehensive of another attack to-night. I do not think they will trouble him against after
