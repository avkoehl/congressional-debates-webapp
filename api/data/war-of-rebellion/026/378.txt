WASHINGTON, D. C., September 2, 1862.

Major-General DIX, Fort Monroe:

The great danger of Washington renders it necessary that the remainder of Keyes' corps be sent here as rapidly as possible; at least all of it that you can spare.

The entire army of the enemy is before us, and the fighting has been daily for a week with varying results.

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.
HEADQUARTERS FOURTH CORPS,Yorktown, Va., September 3, 1862.

Brigadier General S. WILLIAMS,

Adjutant-General, Army of the Potomac:

SIR: I have the honor to inclose herewith the proceedings of a board of officers convened at this place by my orders to examine and report upon the condition of the defenses of Yorktown and what is necessary to place them on a proper footing.

In regard to the force necessary the report of the board corresponds pretty nearly with my letter of 27th ultimo* on the same subject. It would be well to place three gunboats in York River; one or two should be kept moving continually, otherwise this fire river will be greatly used for the comfort of the enemy, and perhaps for our annoyance.

I remain, respectfully, your most obedient servant,

E. D. KEYES,

Major-General, Commanding Fourth Corps.
