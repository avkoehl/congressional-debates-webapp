ROLLA, September 28, 1864.

Colonel J. V. DU BOIS,

Chief of Staff, Saint Louis:

Two hundred and fifty rounds of ammunition for the heavy guns (24-pounders) were received with the guns; but before the railroad should be cut it would be better to send 250 rounds more-the same as you sent before.

JOHN McNEIL,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

SAINT LOUIS, September 28, 1864-6.15 p. m.

Brigadier-General McNEIL:

Don't think it safe to send the extra ammunition required for 24-pounder guns. Be careful of what you have .

Major KAISER,

Waynesville:

Inform General Sanborn upon his arrival that Potosi was taken last night. The enemy are reported marching on Franklin, although I expect him at Knob View, sixteen miles from here. Ask him to press his march on to this place, and to bring up his batteries at the earliest possible moment. You will move here with him. Strengthen the guard at Little Piney and bring that at Big Piney in with you.

JOHN McNEIL,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

FRANKLIN, September 28, 1864.

A report has reached here, about half an hour ago, that Richwoods has been taken by the enemy, and that they are advancing this way.
