outside of that receipt. The claim may be
wrong, but the Commissioner has decided seven
or eight times that itis right. This wasdecided
by the law of 1842, which provided, in express
terms, that certificates should be allowed to
Indians who were denied the privilege of tak-
ing their reservations under the fourteenth
article of the treaty of 1830, because the Uni
ted States had sold their lands, and could not
let them have it. The foundation of this claim
was a wrong which was dfone these Indians.
Why, Mr. Speaker, do you know that we
charge these Indians for the pensions that we
pay under the treaty of 1830 to those of them
■who served in the Army under GeneraTWayne.
We ch&rged "it upon the payment for the land
that we bought of them by the treaty of 1830,
;on aeebunt of which lands this claim is due ?
Do you know, sir, that we charge them over
$14,000 upon the lands we bought of them for
'the cattle we got from them? We got their
cattle, knd: instead of paying for them, as by
an article of the treaty we Were obligated to
'tfo, we took the money which was paid them
'for their cattle and charged it against them,
upon the payment of their lands. When we
{Said pensions to soldiers who fought under
General Wayne we charged it in payment for
tHbir land, as the account of the Treasury,
which the gentleman holds in his hands, will
show. '■■■-
And, Mr. Speaker, we. obligated ourselves
to Survey their lands.' We charged ten cents
an acre for surveying their lands. Of over
.ten millions^ of acres we gave over two hun-
dred and ninety-two thousand acres to rail-
roads. We only paid them twelve cents an
'4cre on1 near five million acres, taking out
ten cents for the surveying, leaving only two
and a half cents per acre to the Indians. Then
wb ttok'five per cent, for our internal revenue
fund, and carried it to the State of Mississippi,
and charged the Indians with that.
Mr. SAB&BNT. 1 have not time in the
two minutes l&ft to me to answer what the
gentleman from Indiana has stated; but it is
all easily answered, and I will reserve it for
some future time.
Mr. SHANKS. I wish to put in the Globe
a document which I have not now here.
Mr. SARGENT. When the gentleman gets
through speaking I will demand the previous
Suestion. Before the document is inserted in
le Globe I hope it will be read.
Mr. SHANKS. I will have it read to-mor-
row if the gentleman desires. I ask that it be
printed in the Globe'with my remarks.
The following is the memorandum of agree-
ment between the Secretary of the Treasury
and Nathaniel Paige touching the Choctaw
lands which have been appropriated in 1861
and reappropriated in 1871 : this memoran-
dum of the Secretary with Paige provides for
submitting the matters to the Attorney Gene-
ral for his opinion ; but Grayson swears before
the committee a few days since that the sub-
mission to the Attorney General was, at his
and Paige's request, withdrawn by the Secre-
tary without the Attorney General's report or
decision as to the value of Paige's information.
Mr. SARGENT. I supposed you had it in
your hand.
• ^PliAKER. If there be no objection
it will be ordered accordingly.
There was no objection.
The document is as follows:
rls^of1 °naMn?erstan<1!n8hatl this 30th
ih Jti March' between the Secretary of
the Treasury and Nathaniel Paige, of *,he City of
Washington. Xhe said Paige alleges, onhehaJf of a
certain person whose name is withheld, that a cer-
tain claim is pending in the Treasury Denartmmf
nfVtw0"1^' 80 moulting to the sum
of between three and four hundred thousand do™
"aid See-
payment of said claim, by establishing the illegal
and fraudulent character of said claim.
It is therefore understood that the said Secretary
shall receive from said Paige such information,
which shall be a full statement of the nature and
history of said alleged frauduleut claim, and the
names of all the principal persons connected there-
with, and of their particular individual relations
thereto, and if in the judgment of the Attorney
General of the United States^ to whom it is agreed
that said facts and information shall be referred,
such disclosure shall fully establish tlje illegal and
fraudulent nature of said claim, so that said Sec-
retary should not be obliged to pay the same and
in the opinion of said Attorney General, upon a
full hearing, sufficient evidence and grounds for
a refusal to pay said claim by the said Secretary was
not already in the knowledge or possession of his
Department before the making of said disclosure by
said Paige, then the said Secretary agrees to pay to
the said Paige, for and on behalf of himself and in-
formant, ten per cent, of the amount of said claim,
provided that the whole amount so to be paid shall,
in no event, exceed the sum of $30,000.
It is also agreed by said Paige that his informant
shall hold himself ready, at any and all times, upon
reasonable notice; to give such further information
and explanations in regard to all matters within the
knowledge of himself or his said informant, con-
nected with said claim, as may be required by said
Secretary.

ment oi the amounts paid, and to be paid, to the

she was to receive five per cent, of the net proceeds
of the sale of all lands within her limits, and to in-
close for your information, a copy of the report of
the Commissioner of the General Land Office, to
whom it was referred.
J t is,Proper t0 jdd that the apparent disorepanoy
to the amount of net proceeds of lands sold up
to January 1, 1859,) between the report of the Com-
missioner and the report submitted by me to Con-

it An f C0S of s1r.Yey\ng. was estimated
