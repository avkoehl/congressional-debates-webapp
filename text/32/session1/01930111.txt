THE CASE OF THE PROMETHEUS.
The BRESIDENT pro tem.'laid before tKe Sen-
ate the following message from the President of
the United States:
To the Senate of the United States:
I have received a resolution of the Senate, adopted upon
the 12th instant, in the following terms:
"Resolved, That the President of the United States be
' requested to communicate to the Senate, if not inconsist-
ent with the public interest, any information the Execu-
tive may ?i?ive received respecting the firing into and
â€”* seizure of the American steamship Prometheus bv a But-
e tali vessel of war; in November last, near Grey Town, on
( the Mosquito Coast; and, also, what meaeuics have been
4 taken by the Executive to ascertain the state of the fact
' and to vindicate the honor of the country."
In answer to this request, I submit to the Senate the ac-
companying extracts from a communication addressed to
the Department of State by Mr. Joseph L. White, as coun-
sel of the American Atlantic and Pacific Ship Canal Com-
pany, dated 2d instant.
This communication is the principal source of the in-
formation received by the Executive in relation to the sub-
ject alluded to* and is presumed to bo essentially correct m
its statement of the tacts. Upon icceivmg tlii^ communi-
cation, instructions, such as tlx; occasion seemed to de-
mand, were immediately dispatched to the Minister of the
Uiutvd States in London. Sufficient time has not elapsed
for the io turn of any answer to tins dispatch tiorn him; and,
in my judgment, it would at the present moment be incon-
sistent with the public interest to communicate those in-
structions. A communication, however, of all the coire-
spondence will be made to the .Senate at the earliest
moment at which a propei regaid to the public inteiest will
permit.
At the same tune instructions were given to Commodore
Parker, commanding the home squadron, a copy of which,
so far as they relate to the case ot the Prometheus, is here-
with transmitted to the Senate. ^

FLOGGING IN THE NAVY.
Mr. BRODHEAD. I have been requested to
present a memorial, signed by a large number of
the citizens of the United States, praying for the
restoration of the law authorizing prompt and
summary punishment for petty offences in the
Navy and commercial marine. T understand the
petitioners to piay for the restoration of the law
authorizing Hogging. I move that the memorial
be referred to the Committee on Naval Affairs.
Mr. STOCKTON. 1 am quite amazed, Mr.
President, at that paper. I did not believe it pos-
sible that so many people m Philadelphia could
have been found to sign such a memorial as thai
seems to be. I hardly know at this moment of
surprise what tn gay m relation to it. It is a very
important matter, which is presented to the Sen-
ate, in reference to which 1 ought not, perhaps*,
inconsiderately to discourse. 1 cannot but remem-
ber that the State of New Jersey was one of the
first in the Uiuon which approved those important
amendments to the Constitution of the United
States which secured freedom of religion, of
speech, and the right to petition, and which has so
securely guarded the State sovereignties from en-
croachments by t-he General Government. For
myself, I yield to no man in respect to the right
of petition; and as long as truth is permitted to
combat error, I will throw no obstacles in its way.
Sir, if there be a right to petition the Senate upon
such a subject, I suppose it is entirely within the
power of the Senate to take what action they may
think proper upon it; and therefore perhaps it
would be most prudent for me to postpone the
expression of my opinions, and ask that for the
present the memorial shauld be laid upon the
table, with the view of taking it up again for dis-
cussion on Tuesday next. By adopting this
course, I shall hove an opportunity of reading the
memorial. Jn the mean time, 1 give notice to
those who may be in favor of the measure, that I
will fight it from the start. Sir, I am entirely op-
posed to any such proposition; and move that it
be laid on the table.
Mr. SEWARD. What is the prayer of the
petition ?
Mr. STOCKTON. To lick the sailors.
The PRESIDENT. If the memorial is laid
upon the table, Jt can be called up at any time.
Mr. SEWARD. I move to lay it on the table,
and let it lie there.
The motion to lay the memorial on the table
was agreed to.
Mr. GWIN, at a subsequent period of the day,
rose and said: Mr. President, I wish to mak* a
remark respecting a memorial which was presented -
this morning by the Senator from Pennsylvania',
[Mr. Brodhead,} praying for a restoration of
iu the Navy. Before that memorial shall
be referredto the Committee on Nayal Affairs, it
will be desirable to know whether it,is intended to-
restore flogging, or to substitute any other system
of punishment in" the Navy. That the opinion 'of
the Senate may be expressed on this subject, I
give notice that I shall call up the memorial on
Tuesday next3 and I hope the Senator from New
Jersey will then be ready to debate it.
