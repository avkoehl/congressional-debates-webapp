THE LATE SENATOR SPEIGHT.
Mr. FOOTE rose and addressed the Senate as
follows:
Mr. President : A few days since, we were
called upon to assume the customary badges of
, mournful respect in honor of a deceased Senator
from Connecticut; and now, whilst the sentiment
of fraternal grief is yet warm in our bosoms, and
the tokens of sorrowing affection are still visible
upon our persons, it has become, necessary that I.
should give renewed pain to the sensibilities of
Senators by passing in review before them another
dispensation of Divine Providence, which, since
the last annual assemblage in this Hall, has de-
prived the National Legislature of an upright and
efficient member, the State of Mississippi of a
faithful and approved political agent, and myself
of a most-worthy and esteemed colleague. -The
Hon. Jesse SpfciGHTdied at his own residence, in
the State of Mississippi, on Saturday, the first day
of May last, after a long and p^infnl illness, which
came upon him here, whilst arduously engaged in
the extraordinary labors of the last Congress, and
which continued to oppress him sorely for several
months, until at last he sunk into that grave where
now quietly repose all that was mortal of the pa1
triot, the philanthropist, and the statesman. I
shall not attempt, on this occasion, to deliver a
formal and elaborate eulogy upon my lamented
friend, feeling that I shall best display the real
respect which t entertain for the well-known re-
publican simplicity of his own tastes by confining
myself to concise and unostentatious delineation of
his life and character.
Jesse Speight was born in thecounty of Greene,
and State of North Carolina, a few years anterior
to the close of the last century, where he continued
uninterruptedly to reside, until his removal to the
State of Mississippi, in the year 1837. "Prior to
his migration from the State of his nativity, he
had officiated as a member of her Legislature, and
had likewise supplied material aid in the reforma-
tion of her organic law, as a prominent member of
the convention â– Which assembled for that purpose
in the year 1837. Before leaving North Carolina,
he had represented onq, of the congressional dis-
tricts of that ancient Commonwealth in the other
wing of this Capitol for four consecutive terms,
closing on the 3d of March, 1837; and I am as-
sured that his whole political conduct at that criti-
cal period of our national history was eminently
creditable to himself and satisfactory to his con-
stituents. After his removal to the West, he
successively represented a most intelligent and
patriotic constituency, first in one branch of our
State Legislature, and then in the other, and pre-
siding over both, at different times, with such
distinguished success as greatly to elevate his
character as a public man, and multiply the num-
ber of his admirers. From the presidency of the
Mississippi Senate, he was elected to a seat upon
this floor, where he acted under the daily and
hourly inspection of those in whose presence I
now speak; and X trust that I shall not be deemed
by any Senator who hears me at all extravagant,
when "I assert, that my lamented colleague, whilst
connected with this body, gave constant evidence
<?f his possessing a sound, acute, and practical
intellect; habits of persevering industry seldom
surpassed; inflexible honesty of purpose; a mag-
nanimity of soul, which held him ever in readi-
ness for the performance of generous and noble
deeds, and which equally saved him, at all times,
from the least participancy in augiit that could be
recognized as little, or sordid, or illiberal. He
was blessed with unusual sweetness and uniformity
of temper; and the unceremonious cordiality of his
manners rendered his society particularly agreeable
and attractive. In domestic life, he was strikingly
amiable and exemplary; and his untimely decease
has brought sorrow and disappointment to kiryl
and innocent hearts, which his living presence
never failed to inspire with sentiments of buoyant
hope and elastic gladness of spirit.
Mr. F. concluded by offering the following reso-
lutions; which were unanimously adopted:
Resolved, unanimously, That the Senate, from a desire to
exhibit a profound respect for the' memory of the Ron.
Jesse Speight, late a member thereof, will go into mourn-
ing by wearing crape on the left arm for thirty flays.
Resolved, That, as an additional mark of respect for the
memory of the Hon. Jesse Speight, the Senate do now ad-'
journ.
Ordered, That the Secretary inform the House of Repre-
sentatives thereof.
Whereupon, the Senate adjourned.
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
Thursday, December 16, 1847.
The Journal of yesterday was read and ap-
proved.
RUIZES OP THE HOUSE.
The Speaker announced the special order of the
day, being the report heretofore made by Mr. C.
J. Ingersoll, from theSelect Committee on Rules.
Mr. INGERSOLL said, that upon consultation
t with members of the committee, it had been
that the special order should be postponed until to-
morrow. He therefore m&de motion. And
the question having been taken and decided in the
affirmative, the special onior was postponed ac-
cordingly. -
MAIL COiJTttACTS.
Mr. BOTTS asked the unanimous consent of the
Hoijse to introduce a joint resolution authorizing
and directing the Postmaster General* to renew the
contract with the Richmond, Fredericksburg, and
Potomac Railroad and Steamboat Company, for
the transportation of the great northern! and south-
ern mail between Washington and Richmond; and
was about to address the House on the subject,
when
Mr. G. S. HOUSTON inquired if it was in or- .
der to do so ?
The SPEAKER replied, that at -the adjourn-
ment yesterday, a question was pending which
could only be set aside by general consent.
Mr. BOTTS was satisfied, if the House would
permit him to make a brief explanation, that no
objection would be made to the consideration of
his resolution, which was on a subject in which
they were"ail deeply interested.
Mr. G. S. HOUSTON called for the 'orders of
the day.
Mr. BOTTS inquired if it was in order to move
a suspension of the rules?
The SPEAKER, replied that it was not, the
pending question being that which was before the
House at the adjournment yesterday.
VETO OP THE RIVER AND HARBOR BILL.
The House having resumed the consideration
of the said message-
Mr. PETTIT, who was entitled to the floor,
said that he wished to detain the House only for â– 
a shoit time. To reason was the province of man.
! To reason rightly, indicates, in the first place, a
I well-formed intellect; and, in the second place, a
j highly-cultivated and improved one. But to ad-
i here pertinaciousjy to those opinions which were
, formed early in life, closing the mind to the light
i of experience, was characteristic of the dogmatist,
' and was" unworthy of an intelligent being. The
position which he occupied on the question involv-
ed in this message, was to him an unpleasant one;
for, of all things, it was most pleasant for him tg
agree with those with whom he desired to agreeâ€”
with those of -whose course he had an intense and
ardent desire to approve., Nothing but the stern-
est dictates of dutyâ€”settled, as he thought, on
well-founded considerationsâ€”had brought him to
differ from the conclusions and reasonings of the
message under consideration. If any one man
more than another had ardently wished and labo-
riously exerted himself to bring into power the
present incumbent of the Executive chair, he might
ciaim that for himself, though probably he had not
labored so effectually as some others. Nor was
there any member of this House that more cor-
dially agreed with the Administration in air its
prominent measures than he did. That distinc-
tion he might also claim for himself; and he cor-
dially concurred with the Administration in its
measures in regard to our commercial relations,
our impost duties, th.e tariff law of 1846, and the
annexation of Texas. There was no man there
that would give a heartier and more cordial sup-
port to the war which we are and have been wa-
ging, and which thus far had resulted to the glory
of our arms and the honor of our country. In
these things he was an ardent and consistent sup-
porter of the Administration. Others might claim
for themselves a devotion to some particular mea-
sure, or to some distinctive policy of the country;
but he claimed for himself to be a supporter of the
Administration in all its prominent measures. He
had laboriously defended them, and pertinaciously-
adhered to them from a consciousness of their
being right; and it was from these considerations,
and this course of reasoning, that he had come
to the conclusion to differ from the argument
contained in this message. Here wasa sub-
ject which, of all others, was deeply interest-
ing to his constituents; duty, therefore, imposed
on him the necessity frankly and boldly to
make known to the country what his views
were. But allegations and assertions did not
amount to arguments and reasons. Dogmas, how
often soever uttered, could never ha\;e the force of
truth. What, tV&n, were the conclusions of this
message? It had been said by some that they were
