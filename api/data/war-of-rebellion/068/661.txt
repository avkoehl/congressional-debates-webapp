HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,May 12, 1864 - 9.20 p. m.

Major-General HANCOCK, Commanding Second Army Corps:

The major-general commanding desires to know if you will have any surplus force after your trenches are fully manned. The trenches should be rendered as strong as possible.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,May 12, 1864.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

Chief of Staff, Army of the Potomac:

GENERAL: General Birney's loss in this action was a trifle over 2,800 killed, wounded, and missing. General Mott's loss is unquestionably heavy, say 1,500; Barlow's say 1,000 - at least that. Gibbon's is already reported at 1,800. Total, say 7,100.

General Birney has collected over 3,000 stand of arms, of which eight wagon; loads have been sent away. General Mott, if the time permits, will collect more - perhaps 2,000. What cannot be carried off will be destroyed.

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,May 12, 1864.

The major-general commanding directs that the defensive works of this command be strengthened as much as possible, so as to have as many troops as possible available for reserve. The army will not assume offensive operations to-morrow. Commanders are requested to see that the entrenching tools are properly cared for.

By command of Major-General Hancock:
