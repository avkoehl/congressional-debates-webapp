and don ol the nation
Mv eo eague has applied to  L vi Woodbury, Secretary of
the Trea> jrv, lor a statement ol the compensation which Ge
neral Harrison nas received trom the Government   for the *ei
vices which he has rendered in  the  vauous pubic stations
which he has filled  duunga long and eveittul  life, most of
which  has been-pent in the service ot his country     It would
■wm that the accommodating Secretary was quite happy to
have it in his power to furnish the lniormauon sought for by
rav colleague, and the  musty records ot the past not having
been destroyed by the fire which consumed the Treasury build
mg in IS33, the whole clerical force of the Treasury Depart
merit leems to  have been biought into requisition, by order of
the Secretary, to lurnish 'o   my colleague the desired official
stitement, rom which it appears that General Harrison has,
during his ine, received from the Government, as compensa
tion an aggregate sum ot U[ wards ol seventy thousand dollars
This olh lal statement is embodied in  the speech of my col
league, and sent lorth to the people, for the double purpose of
correcting the impression which   la abroad  in the land, that
Gen Harrison is not weal hv, and to satisfy the people that he
1 is no chim upon then giatl ude    This grand political move
ment ot im colleague iml the Secretary ol the Treasury will
chubt'ess constitute an era in the annals of political warfare
When the people are hereafter cilled upon to decide between
tiecuflictiniclJims ol rival aspirants to the Presidency, they
wi I, Iouptose, on vha e to ascertain the respective amounts
winch the rival candidates have  received from  the Treasury,
and give thei   votes to him who has received the smallest sum
This new m de of tes nig mtnt emanates from a source so
high and r^pectab'e that it is certainly entitled to serious con
sillera ion     For my own par , I desire to see an lmmediaie ex
penmen al app ication ol ti e principle    I have not applied to
the Secretary of theTreasury to lurnish to me statements of the
eom^iensation which Mr Van Buren has from time to time re-
ceived    But we know tha', when the present year shall have
expired, he will have been four years President of the United
Sates, receivingin aunualsalary of twenty five thousand dol
¡are. making an aggregate ot one hundred thousand dollars which
he has received tor his services as Presi entofthe United States
\\z know that he has  been four years Vice President of the
1 iited Sti es   receiving an annual salary   of  five   thousand
collars, making an aggregate of twenty thousand dollars which
he has received for his services as Vice President of the United
States    W e know that he has been minuter to England, re
ceivin? for his services in that capacity the usual outfit and sa
lary making an aggr-gate of eighteen thousand dollars whi h
he his received toi his service  as minister to England    These
items, added together, amo    t to the sum of one hundred and
thirty eight thousand dollai-    If to this wasadded the compen
sation winch Mr Van Bui en has received for his services in va
nous ether public stations, i would appear that he has received
from he Government a sum more than double  the amount
which has been received by General Harrison    Thus you see,
bir, that unJerthe new test of merit which my colleague and
Mr Woodbury seem disposed to introduce, General Harrison
s ill occupies the vantage ground    Compare the services ren
dereJ to his country with those of Mr Van Buien, and the con
trast will be more stnkingin favor of Gen Harrison  Whatpub
lie service has Mr Van B jren ever rendered which conferred ho
nor upon his country, ordispensed blessings to his countrymen?
Mr  Speaker, my colleague was pleased to treat the House
with a review of sev eral Whig conventions which have recently
issemb'ed in d fferent parts ol the Tinned States andtofavorus
with sketches of the lives and characters of the individuals who
compcbed th jse conventions   He read a statement from a news-
paper in Clio, (the publishers of which have, for many years
past, been quar'"red upon the publie Treasury, and have re
ceived from it large amounts of money,) in relation to a conven
tion which recently assembled at Columbus, in that State   That
statement is so glaringly and ex'ravagantly false, that I deem it
unnere "ary   to   no ice   it    I  cannot forbear,  however, to
express    my    sui prise    and    astonishment   that   my   col
league   should   have   felt   himself   authorized   to  embody
that   statement   m   his   printed  speech, and suppress  the
remaiks made by the gentlemm from O no, (Mr  Bond,) ex
posing the  filsehood of that  statement,   and   the  infamous
character of lis authois     But my colleague, no doubt, thinks
he has a right to select for himself a code of morals by which
to govern his own conduct, and I therefore, without furthet
remark upon that part ol his speech which related to the Co
Iambus convention proceed to notice his review of the Harris
burg «invention  wh ch nominated Gen   Harrison as a candi
date for the Presidency     That convention consisted of 240 or
230 nvmoere—gentlemen of character and distinction from a!
most every State in the Union, who met together (or the purpose
of securing harm my and concert of action upon a subject of
absorbing mteiest to themselves and their countrymen gene
rally    They were not the "hired soldiers of the President,"
who met to devise measures to sustain power in its encroach-
ments upon popular liberty, but they were freemen, who, in
the exercise of a constitutional nsht, met together to devise
measures for the perpetuation of that freedom which they inhe
rited from thetr ancestors    A man who could number among
hn phrenological developments the organ of conscientiousness,
wjuld feel it to be a delicate task to undertake, upon his own
iesDonsibitity, to publish histories of the past lives, the present
political position, and future purposes and objects of such an
assemblage of gentlemen      Biographical historians generally
nevóte much time and labor to the collection of materials for
writing the life of a single individual, and are careful to know
that their information is collected from authentic and reliable
souices   But my colleague, being gifted in a peculiar and ex

traordmary mannei with unparalleled unscrupulousness, and
reckless ot the injustice which he is likely to inflict, enters up
on the task of giving to the public the private and public histo-
rvot 210 individuals, with whom he is unacquainted, and of
whose lives and chaiactcrs he knows nothing    Surely my col
league will secure to hnnsell all the benefits of his new discove
lv in literatuie by piocuring a patent light    Certain I am,
that his friends v. ill nisi t upon his persevering in this new field
of ambitious adventuir    T eywill conclude that, if he cannot
win a lame as immortal as Plutarch's, he may, nevertheless,
leasonably hope to achieve a notoriety as enviable as that of
Baron Munchausen     It is a maxim, sir the truth of which is,
I believe, geneially conceded, th t no man is so entnely vicious
as not to possess some redeeming virtue, or bo good as not to
possess some   vicious tiailty    But it seems that this maxim
does not apply tu ti e members of the Hainsbuig  Convention,
foi mvcolltagut has not been able to find in the character of
any o le ol iho individuals who ct mposed  that convention, a
single redeem rig virtue upon which to bestow his commenda
tion, but on the contrary, hi finds, in the character and history
oleath one   something which  he seems to imagine will dis
parage him m  i ublic estimation     home of them   he writes
down as lawv trs, some as traders and   speculators—others  as
meichants Abolitionists, rederalist«¡ Aristocrats, men ot  plea
sure, men ol leisure &c —all ot which terms he seems to use
as if they implied odium and disparagement    If all that my
colleague has pub'i lied in lelation to the pursuits and avoca
tions of those wli >   ompo ed the Harnsburg Convention be
true, what does it pi ove?    What does it establish]   How  does
he intend to apply li s fact*, if they be facts'!   W hat is the ar
gumen ?   Itisall   une incomprehensible to me    I regret that
mv colleague was not more luminous    What does he  mean?
Aie they n it all American citizens')    Would my colleague pro
scril>e|ihem  on account ef their avocations or pursuits?   Is it
thus that his Democracy exhibits itself?   I had believed that
tiue Demoi racy   recognised as true the  maxim that "worth
makes the man, and want ot it the fellow," and I had supposed
it to be a cardinal pnnciple in the creed of Democracy that all
men are entitled to equal political rights  irrespective of their
trades callings, pursuits, or professions    I am, therefore, una
ble to understand why mv colleague seeks to disparage the no-
minee of the Hirnsburg Convention, because there  were law
yers, dociois niei chants, &c   &c in   that  Convention, and I
am sui prised beyond expression that he should labor to excite
public piej idice against lawyers  for, if I am not much mista
ken, some very generous judge has given him  a license to
practice law in the courts of Tennessee    Whether he has ever
found an individual so simple and credulous as to become his
client, I am uninformed    Nevertheless, he is a member of the
legal profession, and " 'tig   strange, passing  strange,   pitiful,
wondrous pitiful," that he should seek to accomplish a poli-
tical object by disparaging the  profession   of which he is a
member    My colleague, in his extreme anxiety to find some
thing to disparage each member of the Harnsburg Convention,
writes down some e,entlemen as men of pleasure, and others
as men of leisure'   Sir, tnese terms are exceedingly vague
They do not com ey to the mind a distinct idea of the charac
ters which he attempts to delineate    They may apply to me
for, when at home, I am not a day laborer, and am quite fond
of leisure    Does my colleague mean to convey the idea that it
is criminal to indulge in leisure?   Does he use the term in an
odious sense?   These terms might, with much propriety  be
ay plied to my celleague, or to any law yer who, like him, has no
professional duties to perfoim, except to make a daily visit to
his < ffice, to see that the sign board maintains its place over
the door, to give notice to the woild that the occupant is await-
ing candidate for 'fees and fame "   A man of leisure '   I know
ot none who enjoy so much leisure as |the  planters of the
South, who have been genei ally admitted to be pre eminent in
those noble qualities and manly virtues which give dignity to
human natuie    I do not comprehend my colleague    I am
sorry that he was not more intelligible    After completing his
biographual view of the members of the convention, he con
denses an expression of his object into one sentence, by saying
that they are men "who have no interests m common with the
great body ol the people "   The farmers were not there in
their proper persons   and my  colleague no doubt hopes to in
duce them to vote against the nominee of the Harnsburg Con
vention, by exciting their prejudices against those who nomi-
nated him, by telling them 'hat the convention was composed
of lawyers, ('octors, merchants &c  'who have no interests in
common with the great body of the people "   Is he not aware
of the fact that it is very much the custom   of the American
people to entrust the performance of public  duties to law
yers and other professional characters?   Let him look around
this ball—upon his own political friends, and he will see that
the   proportion  of  lawyers,   merchants,   A,c   is  as   great
upon this  floor,   as it was in  the Harnsburg convention
I am a faimer—my colleague is a lawyer    I arrogate to my
selfnosuperiorclaim o public confidence over him on that ac
count    On the contrary, I do not hesitate to declaie it as my
opinion that the study and practice ot the law give a training to
the mental faculties, a discipline to the mind, which, when
united with talents and integrity, qualify aman better than any
thing else can for usefulness in public life    Talents, integrity,
and patriotism, are confined to no particular profession or avo
cation, and, wheiever found, the possessor is entitled to honor,
to trust, and to confidence    But, sir, if my colleague will insist
upon establishing an arbitrary test of merit, which shall ex-
clude all who aie not farmers from participating in public af
fairs, he -will find that it will be very fatal to that political party
whose ascendency he seems to have so much at heart.   Mr.
Van Buren, the chief of that party, is a lawyer, as also are a
large maionty of his supporters in both Houses of Congress
General Harrison s a farmer, and although  I am not preju-
diced against lawyers, I most sincerely believe that the farmers
of the United states will very much promote their own interest
and that of their countrymen generally, by elevating to the
Presidency the man who has faithfully served the Republic in
many important civil stations; who nobly and valiantly defend-
ed his country when the storm of warraged within its borders,
and who now, when p;ace blesses the land, lives in republican
simplicity, upon his own faim, devoting himself to the pure,
virtuous, and manly pursuits of agriculture.
Mr Speaker, it is the habit of Mr Van Buren's supporters to
rely very much upon the force of names They entertain an
opinion very different from that of the poet, who said, "What's
in a mme1 A nvie by iny other name would smpll ai sweet "
And they hope to d sguise the enormity ol their principles and
practices, and render their political opponents odious to the
people, by applying to them unpopular names    Hence, they
assume that all who oppose the re election of Mr Van Buren
are Federalists, an i thatall ol his opponents w I o live north of
Mason and Dixon's line, are Abolitionists Proceeding upon
these bioad and false assumptions, my colleigue, in his review
of the Hainsburg Convention, writes down many of the eentle
men who composed that assemblage as Federalists and Aboil*
tionists, hoping theretiy to aid the exertions which the leaders
of Ins party are making to induce the people of the Southern
States to believe that General Harr son is an Abolitionist and a
Fedeialist My colleague did notopeily and manfully make
the charge that General Harrison i an Abolitionist, because he
kne n that the c harge would be promptly met, and its lalsehood
proven, and the efore, I t citóse to deal in ' damnable hints and
diabolical niueiidoes," accomplishing his object by indirection,
and avoiding the íesponsibility of making a false charge I pro-
pose, sir, to expose the injustice of this disguised i nputation.
No gentleman upon this floor has ventured to make the charge
that General Hanison is an Abolitionist No man of common
sense and common information believes him to be one No
man who will reter to the course which he puisued m this
House, upon the application of Missouri for admission into the
Union, and lake the trouble to examine his oplulons, as ex-
pressed in various letters and speet lies, can lor a moment doubt
that he isas flee as any 'iving man from this odious imputation,
and I do not hesitate to declaie it as my opinion, that not one of
the gentlemen of this House who h've garbled his Ictteis and
speeches for the purpose o making the people believe him to
bt an Abolitionist, do themselves believe it Yet they do not
hesi ate 11 inflict the deepest injustice upon General Hanison,
by mdking the people believe him an Abolitionist I am not so
profoundly veised m ethics as to be able to draw the dis-
tinction between the moral guilt nf originating an untruth and
that of endeavoring by such means to make the people believe a
falsehood
[Mi Cooper of Georgia rose, and, in substance, said tha  with-
out undertaking to say whether or i ot General Harrison was an
Abolitionist, his party was identif ed with them, and that, if
elected President, his administration would be controlled by
them, an 1 that this was the issue which he desired to present to
the country ]
Mr Gentry resumed his remarks I understand the gentle-
man from Georgia to say that, while he declines to make the
charge that General Harrison is himself an Abolitionist, he con-
tends that he is supported by them for the Piesidency; and
that Abolition influence will control Ins Administration In
some of the States of this Union the people are very equally di-
vided between the two great political parties, and the Aboli-
tionists hold the balance of power between them, and can, by
uniting with the one or the othei pauy, control the election,
and doubtless Mr Van Buren or General Harrison will be very
willing to receive their support in any of the States thus situ-
ated As lor myself solemnly believing that the defeat of the
party which has for so many years wielded the power of the
Government is demanded by the best interests nf the people
and the Government, I sinceiely hope that the Abolitionists
will co operate in the accomplishment of that object in all the
States which are situated as 1 have described But, sir, we
have the most indubitable evidence that such will not be the
case, for the leaders of the Abolitionists have nominated candi-
dates foi the Presidency and Vice Presidency of their own par-
ty, and, at this time, are making vigt rous and successful exer-
tions to establish a separate and independent political organi-
zation The premises of the gentlemen are false, and his con-
clusion is absurd It is not true that General Harrison is ihe
candidate of the Abolitions s, and, if it was true, that thev are
supporting him for the Presidency, it would still be absurd to
conclude that they would control his Administration It is an
undeniable truth, that the leading men and principal newspa-
pers of the Abolitionists have been actively and zealously op-
posing the election of General Harrison, an'' have denounced
him for his ultra opposition to their views Vet, in defiance of
these well known facts, gentlemen iterate and reiterate tho
charge that General Harrison is the candidate of the Abolition-
ists, and that the Southern States of the Union cannot, consis-
tently with their peculiar interests,support him f^rthe Presi-
dency Who can believe that General Harrison would, in any
event, countenance the schemes of those fanatics?—schemes
which jeopard the integrity of the Union—that Union which he
has made so many sacrifices to maintain, and so often perilled
his life to defend
Sir, it is a well known fact that the Abolitionists have never
been united upon political questions, but have co opeiated with
the one party or the other, and been governed in their party as-
sociations, like other citizens, exclusively by local circum-
stances—by their individual opinions, partialities, or preju-
dices, and it is extremely absuH to make the charge of Aboli-
tion against either of the candidates for the Presidency, be-
cause they are or have been supported by Abolitionists We
may, more reasonably, look upon the conduct of those distin-
guished individuals, in relation to the admission of Missouri
into the Union, as lurnishing a true index to th ir principles
upon that question, so peculiarly interesting to the Southern
portion of this Republic At that time, neither of them were
aspirants to the Presidency, and there was no motive to induce
either one of them to conceal his true principles, or profess
those which he did not in truth entertain What, sir, was the
nature of that question? The people of Missouri applied for
admission into the Union as a State The Northern portion of
the Republic insisted upon makmgit a condition of thatadmis-
sion that slavery should be prohibited within the limits of Mis
soun The Southern States regarded this movement as a de-
velopment of principles and purposes of a most alarming cha-
racter, and as vitally involving that peculiar interest which is
now attacked by the Abolitionists They stood forth, as one
man, in indignant opposition to the restriction which the North
desired to impose. The North was equally earnest and uncom-
promising m its opposition to the admission of Missouri, ex-
cept upon the condition which I have mentioned In this con-
flict of opinions, of feelings, and of interests, between the
Northern and Southern sections of the Union, each became fu-
riously excited—excited to a degree which menaced civil war,
and imminently threatened a dissolution of the Union At that
most perilous period of our history, when the peculiar institu-
tion of the South was in such imminent jeopardy, where was
General Harnsoni He was a m« mber of this House—the Re-
presentative of a constituency whose opinions and prejudices
were adverse to the feelings and interests of the houth upon the
pending question, but he, like a true patriot, nobly stood forth
to maintain the compromise of the Constitution, and saenfied
himself m the performance of a duty which patriotism en-
joined    Where was Martin Van Buren, and what was hie cor-
