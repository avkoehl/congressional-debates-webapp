that it is the intention to throw General Owen farther forward. If so, it is my desire to have my line advanced at the same time. It is possible that my people may take the advance of the skirmish line ordered this morning for the advance of the whole line. Please let me know what your intentions are, that I may keep up the connection.

HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,May 31, 1864 - 10 a. m.

General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: The firing in my front is that necessary to carry out my instructions in feeling the enemy. General Barlow has possession of what appears to be their first line of rifle-pits for a distance of what appears to be a brigade front on the left of the Richmond road. General Birney has advanced his skirmishers and taken the line they threw up in front last night. As soon as the matter is developed I will give you detailed information. It is thought the enemy have a line run with a salient more in the front of General Wright. The conduct of the skirmishers in my line was extremely spirited, but I hear nothing going on to the right or left.

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General, Commanding.

[Indorsement.]

General HUMPHREYS:

Inquire of General Burnside whether his skirmishers have advanced, and with what result. Notify him of Hancock's progress, and notify Hancock of Wright's report.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,May 31, 1864 - 10 a. m.

Major-General HANCOCK:

An officer of the escort of these headquarters just from your front states that Barlow's troops are in the enemy's entrenchments, and that the enemy has withdrawn all his guns, except one, and is withdrawing that.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
