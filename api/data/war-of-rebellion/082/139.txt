HEADQUARTERS EIGHTEENTH CORPS,July 10, 1864-6 a.m.

Colonel H. L. ABBOT,

Commanding Siege Train, Broadway Landing:

Lieutenant Sergeant with his detachment did not arrive until it was too late to put the mortars in position. Six wagons have been unloaded too late to put the mortars in position. Six wagons have been unloaded and sent back, but the rest of the mortar train stand near here. Can I keep it until dark to-night? It will cause much trouble if I try to unload it to-day and to find transportation and load it again to-night.
