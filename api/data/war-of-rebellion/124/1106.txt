GOVERNOR OF RHODE ISLAND,

Providence, R. I.:

SIR: Since the receipt of Colonel Bailey's letter of the 27th ultimo, written by direction of Your Excellency, I have had our rolls re-examined, and find that the State of Rhode Island has furnished and had mustered into the U. S. service to include October 31, 1863, 9,150 three-years" troops. Our records, therefore, now show as follows:

Per revised statement to October 31, 1863, 9,150 including company Hospital Guards. Number credited per statement May 19, 1863, 6,663. Gain, 2,487. The number (2,487) will be passed to the credit of the State. It is made up of volunteers mustered into service between May 19 and October 31, and all men mustered into service prior to May 19, but were not reported in statement of that date in consequence of the proper rolls and records not being filed in this office. I would respectfully request that the foregoing figures may be compared with the records of your adjutant-general, and that I may be advised of the result.

I have the honor, &amp;c.,

THOMAS M. VINCENT,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
