No blame is attached to the officers and men of the Nineteenth Indiana Battery in the unfortunate loss of three of their guns. It was one of those misfortunes which cannot be provided against. The commanding officer lost his life in trying to save his battery. Lieutenant Keeler succeeded to the command and brought tho balance of the battery off in good order. Second Lieutenant Judson Rich, commanding Battery I, Second Illinois Light Ad his battery well and is a deserving officer.

The fire from all the artillery was accurate and well-directed, and officers and men alike acquitted themselves honorably.

I am, Colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

CHARLES HOUGHTALIN,

Major, Commanding Artillery Brigade, Fourteenth Army Corps.
