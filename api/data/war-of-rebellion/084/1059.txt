ORDNANCE BUREAU,

Richmond, September 24, 1864.

Respectfully submitted to the honorable Secretary of War, through the Adjutant and Inspector General, in response to call for his information for His Excellency the President.

In addition to the arms enumerated herein there were 5,000 arms lost crossing the Mississippi River in the summer of 1863, and there have been sent via Havana upward of 6,000 arms to Texas, making an aggregate of 50,000 arms sent to the Trans-Mississippi Department; 46 pieces of field artillery, heavy and light; 18,000 sets of infantry accouterments; 2,225,000 small-arm ammunition, and over 3,000,000 percussion caps. Of the small-arms three-fourths of those carried over went into Arkansas, and nearly all the artillery. On the other hand, the machinery brought from Little Rock Arsenal cannot be stated definitely now (owing to the removal of papers), but it was unimportant. As to the arms brought from Arkansas none were received, save those in the hands of troops, most of whom were rearmed on this side the Mississippi, and the crude arms with which they were supplied are now in store at Montgomery.

J. GORGAS,

Colonel and Chief of Ordnance.
