more serious difficulty than its practical operation.
The appellant not oniy selects the judge who shall
try the case, but also pays the fee of twenty-five
„ dollars allowed him. The amount of compensa-
tion thus received will depend upon the number
- of cases brought before him; that number will
inevitably be influenced by his course of decision.
The judge is thus placed in a position of embar-
rassment, if not of humiliation, alike to be de-
plored by himself and the country.
This law should be repealed, and some other
system substituted, which will put this office in a
position of independence in its executive action,
and at the same time secure all the rights of in-
ventors. The most feasible plan yet suggested
to effect this is, In my judgment, to authorize the
creation of a permanent board of review, to con-
sist of three members, selected from th'c exam-
iners of the office, and who shall be known as
examiners in chief. This board shall be charged
with the duty of hearing and determining upon
all appeals from the judgment of the primary ex-
aminers, except in cases of appeal where any of
these may have previously formed and expressed
an opinion; in which case another examiner may
be substituted to act in his stead; and then their
judgment and action will be subject to the super-
vision and review of the Commissioner. This
alteration of existing law must necessarily in-
crease the efficiency of the office, and at the same
time secure uniformity and certainty in its rules
of action. And while the inventor will be saved
from vexatious delays, and heavy costs to judges
and counsel, he must feel satisfied that, in the
provision made for the thorough examination of
his application by the examiner in the first in-
stance, then by the board of examiners in chief,
and lastly by the Commissioner, he has secured
to him the amplest opportunity for the establish-
ment of his rights.
The activity and success of the inventive genius
of the country, the limited circumstances of this
worthy class of our fellow-citizens, who are badly
prepared to brook delay or expense in the prose-
cution of their claims, the rapid enlargement and
growing importance of this branch of business,
and the fact that this office asks nothing from the
nationalTreasury, but only seeks such an organ-
ization of its internal machinery as will place this
branch of the public service Upon themosteffieient
footing, justify an earnest invocation of the atten-
tion of Congress to the wants of this office.
The agricultural division of this office is grow-
ing in popularity with the country and increasing
in usefulness. It may bo well questioned whether
any other expenditure of the public money has
ever proved so largely remunerative and so benef-
icent in its influences. The crop of Chinese and
African sugar cane alone, for the present year,
will more than compensate for the money here-
tofore expended m this behalf.
Measures have been taken for the establish-
ment of a more satisfactory system for the dis-
tribution of seeds; the introduction of the tea
plant; the collection of the seed and cuttings of
the native grape vines with the view of testing
their value for the manufacture of wine; the in-
vestigation of the nature and habits of the insects
that infest the cotton plant, with a view of ascer-
taining whether some plan can bo devised for the
protection of the cotton planter; and for the chem-
ical analysis of various plants and soils.
The cases required by the act of March 3,1857,
to bo constructed in the hall of the Smithsonian
Institution for the reception of the collections of
the exploring expeditions and other objects of
curiosity and interest, liQwin the main hall of the
Patent Office building, have been contracted for,
and sufficient progress has been made to warrant
the belief that the removal can be made before the
expiration of the current fiscal year. The object
of the transfer of these collections to the Smith-
sonian Institution evidently was to relieve the
Patent Office from the responsibility and trouble
of their custody; the force, therefore, heretofore
employed to take care of them will then be no
longer needed by this office, and no estimate has
been submitted for that purpose.
I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient ser-
vant, J. THOMPSON,
Secretary of the Interior.
To the President of the United States.
Kcport of tSic Postmaster General.
Post Office Department,
. December 1, 1857.
Sir: Since entering on the administration of the
Post Office Department, I have ventured on no
now theories, nor attempted any innovations on
the well-tried system established and practiced
upon by my predecessors: I have contented my-
self with endeavoring, as far as in my power, to
perfect existing arrangements, and extend its
facilities equally and fairly to every portion of our
widely-extended country. In examining its pres-
ent condition, it is worthy of observation that,
while the total number of post offices created
during the twenty years from 1827 to 1847 was
but 8,146, the number established in just half that
length of time, from 1847 to 1857, was 31,444.
On the30th of Juno, 1827, the whole number of
post offices in the United States was 7,000; in
1837, 11,767; in 1847,15,146; and on the 30th of
June, 1857, 20,586. During the last fiscal year
there have been 1,725 office's established and 704
discontinued, being a net increase of 1,021. The
number of postmasters appointed during the year
was 8,680. Of these appointments 4,767 were to
fill vacancies occasioned by resignation; 1,681 by
removal; 238 by death; 269 by change of names
and sites; and 1,725 by the establishment of new
offices. The total number of offices at this time
is 27,148, of which 368 are of the class denomin-
ated presidential, their incumbents being subject
to appointment by the President and Senate. The
commissions of the higher class run four years
from the date of confirmation, but those of the
lower are not limited.
transportation statistics.
On the 30th of June last, there were in opera-
tion 7,888 mail routes. The number of contract-
ors was 6,576. The length of these routes is
estimated at 242,601 miles, divided as follows;
Railroad 22,530 miles.
Steamboat  15,245 "
Coach  49,329 "
Inferior grades 155,497 "
The total annual transportation of mails was
74,906,067 miles, costing §6,622,046, and divided
as follows:
Railroad, 24,267,944 miles, at $2,559,847—
about ten cents and five mills a mile.
Steamboat, 4,518,119 miles, at @991,908—about
twenty-two cents a mile.
Coacli, 19,090,930 miles, at §1,410,826—about
seven cents and four mills a mile.
Inferior grades, 27,029,074 miles, at §1,059,375
—about six cents a mile.
Compared with the service reported on the30th
of June, 1856, there is an addition of 2,959 miles
to the length of mail routes; 3,598,170 miles to
the total annual transportation—being about five
per cent.; and of $586,572 to the cost, or nine and
seven tenths per cent.
The aggregate length of railroad routes has been
increased 2,207 miles, and the annual transpor-
tation thereon 2,458,648 miles—eleven and two
tenths per cent.; at a cost of $249,458, or eleven
and eight tenths per cent.
The length of steamboat routes is greater by
294miles, and the annual transportation by 277,949
miles, costing $131,243 additional, or six and a
half per cent, on transportation, and fifteen and
two tenths per cent, on the cost.
The expense for this species of service was
increased, in one case alone, $28,200, without
any additional service, that is, owing to the fail-
ure of the contractor on the New Orleans and
Key West route. By act of Congress, $7,200
additional was also allowed between tSainbridge,
Ueorgia, and A ppalachicola, Florida, without ad-
ditional service. A route was put m operation
on the Missouri river, on the 1st of June last, at
§85,000 per annum, including side mails by horse
or coach, and regular land service during the sus-
pension of navigation. Steamboat contracts were
also made between Padueah, Kentucky, and
Cairo, Illinois, at $6,000 per annum;and between
Columbus and Bay Port, Florida, at §7,000; and
a fourth weekly trip commenced between Now
Orleans and St. Francisviile, at §3,323. On the
other hand, a reduction of $15,719 per annum
was effected by discontinuing service between
CliaX.auooga, Tennessee, and Decatur, Alabama,
and curtailing the Nashville and'Memphjs route
so as to end atCairo, Illinois. Suchdre the more
prominent changes in the steamboat service.
The length of the coach routes has been reduced
1,124 miles, and the annual transportation 24,061
miles; while the expense has been increased
$70,470, or about five and a quarter per cent.,
($10,000 less than would appear from comparing
the cost on 30th June last with that reported on
30th June, 1856, the latter having been short
stated by that amount.)
In the States of New Jersey,- Pennsylvania^
Delaware, Maryland, and Ohio, where new con-
tracts took effect on 1st July, 1856, the length of
coach routes was decreased 505 miles, and the
annual transportation 228,976 miles, at an in-
creased cost of 024,752. At the same time the rail-
road service and cost in those States were largely
increased—907 miles in length of routes, and
$119,208 in the cost.
In the New England States, during the past year,
the coach transportation was slightly decreased,
but the cost increased $11,264—the amountalloWed
by Congress to a failing contractor.
In Missouri there is a seeming reduction of
coach service of 1,366 miles in length of routed,
137,960 miles annual transportation, and $43,174
in cost; but it must be noted that the Missouri
river contract, above referred to, absorbed itf&eh
coach service, which, to a great extent, will con-
tinue as such, although, under the circumstances,
unavoidably reported under the head of steam-
boat transportation.
In Tennessee there is a disproportion between
the miles and cost of coach service, the cost only
being increased. This is accounted for by an
allowance for expediting in the gap between the
Virginia and Tennessee and the East Tennessee
and Virginia railroads, and other changes.
In other States there have been no changes
requiring special noticc. In some there have bfeen
reductions; but in most of them thecoach servico
has been somewhat increased.
There is nothing of note in connection with the
California,Oregon,New Mexico, Nebraska, and
Kansas routes.
The cost of the Utah , routes was increased
$17,500 by the allowance of that additional pay,
under an act of Congress, without any increased
service, on the route between Salt Lake and San
Pedro.
The additional length of inferior routes is only
1,582 miles, owing partly to the fact that during
the year ending 30th June last, comparatively littlo
new service of this description was putin operation.
The large increase of such service reported 30th
June, 1856, arose from new routes established by
Congress, amounting to nearly 6,000 miles, in the
nortlfwes'tcrn and southwestern sections alone,
and from other extraordinary servico.
The increased cost over that of 30th June, 1856,
($124,401,) maybe explained by the additional ex-
penseundcrthenewcontracts commencing July 1,
1856, in themiddle section of the Union, ($63,533,)
while there was a decrease in the length of routes
of this grade; and the allowance of $17,500 on 'tho
Salt Lake and San Pedro route, without addi-
tional service, must also be taken into account.
As already stated, the extension of railroad
service has been very great; and in order to ex-
hibit this more plainly, the increase is given sep-
arately in five geographical sections, as follows:
States.
New Eiifrland 
New Jersey, Pennsylvania.
Delaware, Maryland, and
Ohio 
Vngima, North Carolina,
South Carolina, and Geor-
