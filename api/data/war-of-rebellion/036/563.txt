BRIDGE OVER COLDWATER, ON HOLLY SPRINGS ROAD,

Via Senatobia, April 20, 1863.

Enemy re-enforced and returned to Hernando. Unless I get help, I must fall back to Panola, and that gives up the provision region. My effective force is only 650, and about 150 more in Panola. Can you send Waul's cavalry and a battery to Panola, and Stocks' to Abbeville?

PANOLA, April 22, 1863.

Enemy advanced from Memphis again yesterday, and about the same time I heard of the advance from below. I destroyed the bridge and ferry over Coldwater, and fell back on the flank of the same force, intending to attack them to-day, when I discovered that I had but four rounds of long-range ammunition. I fell back, and the enemy (2,000 strong) passed on east, after plundering the country of horses and mules.

PANOLA, April 23, 1863.

Enemy, after passing east through [toward] Buck Snort, turned back, and came within 6 miles of me last night. Force estimated at 2,000, composed of cavalry and infantry, mounted on stolen mules and horses. Another force, reported same size, from Memphis, at Coldwater Depot.

I left camp at 12 o'clock last night, and arrived here at 10 o'clock. Believe I can hold this place against their force, and feel confident, if [Leonidas] Willis and Stocks arrive in time.

Lieutenant-General PEMBERTON.

PANOLA, MISS., April 23, 1863.

Force at Coldwater Depot has not advanced; force at Buck Snort gone east. I can strike the Memphis and Charleston Railroad, or I can get my rifled gun to Austin and destroy transports. Which would you prefer?

JAMES R. CHALMERS,

Brigadier-General.

Lieutenant-General PEMBERTON.

Jackson, MISS.

[Answer.]

First strike the railroad, if you are sure you can seriously incommode or injure them.

J. C. P. [PEMBERTON],

Lieutenant-General.
