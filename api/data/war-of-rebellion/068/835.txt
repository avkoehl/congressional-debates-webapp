[Second indorsement.]

General Gillmore has lost all connection with me. I have done my best to inform him of the movement necessary for the safety of this command, supposing the reports to be true of the re-enforcements crossing the river.

WM. F. SMITH.

[Third indorsement.]

I am falling back on two roads between the railroad and pike.

Q. A. GILLMORE.

MAY 16, 1864-9.30 a. m.

General GILLMORE:

Why falling back? Lieutenant Davenport reports no fighting at Ware Bottom Church nor on our right. I sent him back to see and report.

BENJ. F. BUTLER.

MAY 16, 1864-11 a. m.

General Gillmore must bring his command with promptness on to the turnpike to cover the movement of General Smith to the right. This is the third order to this effect.

BENJ. F. BUTLER,

Major-General, Commanding.

MAY 16, 1864-2.15 p. m.

General GILLMORE:

Advance two regiments of Turner's reserve line to the Half-Way House to relieve the regiments there of General Brooks' command. You are expected to hold the turnpike and cover the left of General Smith while his corps advances by the right.

BENJ. F. BUTLER,

Major-General.

Acknowledge receipt with hour of reception.

HEADQUARTERS TENTH ARMY CORPS,May 16, 1864-2.40 p. m.

Major-General BUTLER:

Your order to send two regiments to the Half-Way House to relieve whatever force General Brooks may have had there, has been received and carried out. The balance of my command is where you directed it to be put, covering General Smith's left and rear. i judge from the artillery fire in my front and left that the intrenchments which I was ordered to fall back upon this morning have been reoccupied by the enemy.

Very respectfully,

Q. A. GILLMORE,

Major-General.
