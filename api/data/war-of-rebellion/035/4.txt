CAIRO, January 22, 1863.

Major-General ROSECRANS:

There are now three light-draught gunboats in Cumberland River. The third (Lieutenant-Commander Fitch) went up last night. Please communicate with him. I cannot reach him. Will co-operate and give all the aid we can. I have not men enough left to man a light-draught gunboat.

A. M. PENNOCK,

Fleet Captain, and Commander Station 49.

MURFREESBOROUGH, January 22, 1863.

Captain A. M. PENNOCK, Cairo:

Can you not fill up your gunboat fleet? If necessary, I will make details from here.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.

CAIRO, January 22, 1863.

Major General W. S. ROSECRANS:

Have but two boats at my disposal; one has small-pox on board and the other has not sufficient motive power to stem the current. All other boats now here are positively ordered by the admiral to join him below.

A. M. PENNOCK,

Fleet Captain, and Commandant of the Station.

MURFREESBOROUGH, TENN., January 22, 1863.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

I need gunboats, to be sent up the river to destroy all means of crossing. Captain Pennock says he has none to send. Have telegraphed him asking why common boats cannot be procured, barricaded, and armed, and I will detail men to man them. If boats can be had, will send [Gordon] Granger up there. There is 25 feet of water in the river.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General, Commanding.

WAR DEPARTMENT, Washington, January 23, 1863.

Major-General ROSECRANS,

Murfreesborough, Tenn.:

I have just learned from the Assistant Secretary of the Navy that an express boat has been sent from Cairo to Admiral Porter, with orders to immediately send gunboats to the Cumberland and Tennessee Rivers. In the mean time it is hoped that Captain Pennock may give you assistance from Cairo. Offer him details of soldiers to man his boats.

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.
