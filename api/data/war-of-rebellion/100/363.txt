Lieutenant-Colonel WOODHUL,Assistant Adjutant-General, Fifteenth Army Corps:

COLONEL: I have the honor to report that I left my camp at Rogers' Cross-Roads at daylight this morning and marched out on the road toward Ferrell's Bridge, crossing Tar River about 1 p. m. I went into camp at 4 on the north bank of Cypress Creek, covering well the approaches toward my camps, and establishing my headquarters near the house of Mr. Davis. I marched my division nearly if not quite twenty-five to-day, and the troops came into camp in good order. I notice no straggling and hear no complaints.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

C. R. WOODS,

Brevet Major-General.
