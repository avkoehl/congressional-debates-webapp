Colonel ECTOR:

SIR: I have this evening learned that the enemy, in considerable force, have appeared before General Wise and are engaging him. I have reason to believe that this attack is intended to hold General Wise in his present position, while the much larger portion of the enemy's force will advance upon me by a different road. You will therefore hasten with all dispatch to join your regiment.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

John B. FLOYD,

By WM. E. PETERS,

Assistant Adjutant - General, Floyd's Brigade.
