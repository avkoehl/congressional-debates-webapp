but that we are discharged from the executory part
by our own want of faith I beg to enquire w hy
the payment of this money to the States was pro-
vidediorm instalments'! Was it to accomodate
the Treasury'2 By no means 1 he true secret is
this, sir The public money had been improperly
withdrawn from the Bank of the United States,
and placed in certain State banks It was pro
claimed that these banks would render the same, or
even greater, fiscal aid to the Government than the
Ban,k of the United States did In the party news-
papers of the day, and m the official papers of the
then Secretary of the Treasury, these SUjte banks
were openly stimulated to discount on and lend the
public money When the deposite bill passed, it
was admitted much of this money had been lent,
and could not suddenly be recalled As the Gov-
ernment itself had, in a great degree, prompted the
use of the money, it was thought unjust to recall it
suddenly Hence, sir, the provision for the defei-
red instalments If it could have been controlled,
the whole amount would have been required to be
paid on the passage of the law
I will not dwell on the argument which, I think,
fully establishes these laws as constituting a con-
tract It has been w ell illustrated and sustained by
othei gentlemen Those who wish now to with
hold this money from the States, may, if they please,
i ely on the technical letter of the law I go for the
spirit of the case, and for meeting the just expecta-
tion of the country I call the attention of the
House to the laws passed by the different States on
this subject, by which the whole amount of each in-
stalment has been appropriated m advance It is
said that the State of New York entered mto sol-
emn engagements for the disposi'ion of this fourth
instalment, which she must now in good faith keep,
and, to do so, will obtain the means elsewhere, it
v ou disappoint her in this payment Ohi«r too, my
own, my favorite State, has, by her legislation,
looked to this fund as furnishing permanent means
of general education w ithin her borders Will you
now disappoint the hopes of hei people ! Will you
take from her the means of lighting the lamp of
genius in the humble cottage1 Is the demand for
yom countless and extravagant appropuations so
urgent that thto poor pittance must be withheld1
Is it not rather a pretext seued by those who ori-
ginally opposed the distribution now to deieat its
execution 1 The uniform character of the legisla
Hon of the several States on this subject fully ex-
picsstatht, undemanding which the people had of
that law
Do you suppose, sir, that the States would have
thus acted, if they had imagined the money was to
be recalled, much less if it was not even to be paid
ov ei to diem1 I wished then, as I now do, for an
opportunity to vote on a proposition foi itsdiiect
H linqmshment I am against any postponement
of the payment It is bettei to settle this question
atonte, than to lesene it m such manner as to
bunga periodical debate into Congress Gentle
n>( n say they object to collecting money to be di
v ided among the States, and allege that is but taking
money from one pocket to put into another Sn,
I would not mjsell laise money lor such express
puipose, nor was this money collected with that
design The else is this The States united in
gov eminent for a common purpose, under one Con-
s ltution On looking into their Treasuiy, they
find that, under their system oí finance, a greater
sum collected than the wants of their Government
require Is it safer to leave this money wheie pa
frmage is alieady too great, where it may lead to
i he abuse ot poner, and tempt to the violation of
trusts or shall it be divided among the States on
some just principle of apportionment, and applied
bv them to great and benevolent objects, ovei which
the General Gol eminent disclaims power i ] pre
fpr'ed the latter A few gentlemen, some forty or
ioi y-t\io, came to the othei conclusion, and you
now find such of them as are here, desirous oí es-
tablishing th« propriety of their opposition to that
l lib* their 7<t&\ for the piesent measure I sir
am the less incUned to «edit the necessity fe-i tins'
measure, bv file very circumstance that it emanates
from, and i  eiuefly sustained by, the pertinacious
eneauo&.of the deposite law It is well questioned
vv h.e%r, d the true slate of the Treasury were as'
eertained, this fund wouja be needed, even if not
already pledged to the States But, be the state of
the Treasury what it may, I cannot pass over the
mc( nsistency ot the Secretary in unvoking to his
present aid a fund which he intimates is not m d
f-ondmon to avail him   The Secretary tells you
too, that this measure will disappoint the States
Then why do so, when you have not even the hope
of relief to the Treasuiy to justify4, you * Besides,
among othei measures of relief nbw proposed, is
the bill for the issue of Treasury notes Why not,
if you will pass suchabill, issue these toan amount
sufficient for all purposes, and relieve yourselves
from the imputation of violated fauh1
And now that I have named the Treasuiy note
bill, I will express my astonishment that, after
such repeated professions of dislike for all paper
money, the administration should itself be the
means of giving it currency Have you not prom-
ised the people that )ou would give them hard
money—a gold and silver < urrency ' Why issue
note' then' If your Treasury is exhausted, create
a loan, borrow the money The issuing of Trea-
sury notes is but creating a loan by indirect means
Then why not do it directly1 Advertise ior a
loan, to be taken m gold and silver, and thus let the
people plainly see what you are at The truth is,
it is not designed io carry out what you profess
Mr Chairman, for what purpose are we now
here i Why has the President convened us at an
extra session1 His proclamation gave us lo un
dei-stand that we were to have gieat and weighty
matters submitted for our consideration I knew,
indeed, that the whole country had been overtaken
by a common disaster, and was suffering, that its
currency and exchange were wholly deranged,
and Shat we had by the measures of our own Gov-
ernment, been deprived of the most uniform and
best circulating medium m the known world I
was aware that a sudden shock had overspread the
land, and was willing to suppose that it had occa-
sioned the \ ery abrupt change of opinion in the
President, who, in one short week alter telling the
New York committee that he saw no reason for
an earlier convocation of Congress than the consti-
tutional period, issued his proclamation, under
which we have now assembled I cannot, there-
fore, express my surprise at having offered for our
earliest eonsideiation at such a crisis, the bill to
w Inch I have directed my remarks
Is it tiue, sir, that this Congress has been assem-
bled here a few days befoie the first of October in
older that they might withhold from the States the
paltry sum w Inch the Government ha I pledged its
faith then to pay them1
Then comes the Treasuiy note bill to which I
have already advert d, next, the bill extending
the time of payment on merchants' bords, a bill m
íe'ation to the deposite banks , a bill affecting the
banks m this District, and, lastly a bill with a very
innocent title, imposing additional duties on ofbceis
m certain cases, but which is your Tieanuy bank
in disguise These, I believe, are the leading
measures pioposed, and we have been required to
confine our attention to them for a few weeks, and
go home ' These bills have been seveially report
ed to us in broken doses, by the chairman ol the
Committeeol Wajs and Means, (Mr Cambreleng,)
and I am constrained to ammadveit on the fact,
that they have all been bi ought forward unaecom
panied by any leport This has been the usage of
that committee No longer ago than the last ses-
tion, when the gentleman just alluded to, proposed
to reduce the tariff, by wa\ of depleting the Trea
sury, and in utter disregaidoi the compiomise act
on that subject, we all remember what an elaborate
and subtle report was produced and scattered over
the land But now, when the state oí the country
is such as to lequne a special session of Congress
a studied silpnce i« observed on all subjects íepoit
ed for our eonsideiation See how ti c numerous
memona s of the people on the subject ol a Bank
ot the United Stales have been disposed of A re
solution of two or three lines puus them all at lest
Sir, though the committee may have come to the
conclusion indicated by the resolution thev should
have accompanied it with a repoit which, how-
ever opposed to the pia>er of the petitioners, would
tend to show thev had been heard with iespect,and
in its reasoning, perhaps leconeile them to the re
iusal of their request I beg not to be misimdei
stood I donotproposc aBankof the United States,
those in power, with the President a' their head,
say the people shall nof hav e it The people them
selves, therefore, must come to their ov> n relief If
they wish the country to have such an institution
with a modified charter, improved bv all the lights
of past experience, they must speak out and demand
it I am now leadv to vote, ll the subject is pre
sented for my consideration and will always, it I
can ascertain it, vote m obedience to the will of the
people whom I represent But it would be in vain
at this moment to urge before this Corgress a Bank
of the United States, especially as the President
has already prejudged the case If the people want
it, they will in due time send thoje hete, and with
clear instructions, by whom it will be granted Un
til this be done, I do not believe the country will be
restored to a healthy state m all branches of its
business currency, and exchange
The President m his message affects to believe
that the Bank of the United State chartered by
theState of Pennsylvania, has even greater strength
than the institutions of that name which expired m
1836 And assuming this position he infers that
the present evils of the country cannot be attributed
to the absence of saeh an institution, because that
bank did not avert them' In this he is uncandid
and disingenuous He well knov s the Pennsylva-
nia institution is but a mere State bank, and that it
is not in the power of that State, or any othei to
confer such a charter as the late Bank of the United
States had The power to establish branches
throughout the United States, and the íeceivability
of the paper of the bank for the revenue of the
country, constituted the gi eat means of controlling
the number and inordinate issues oí State banks,
and of regulating the exchanges The United
States Bank of Pennsylvania has not those privi-
leges I wnl not stop longer to refute a position so
evidently insincere
But this subject of exchange w hich so intimately
connects itself with all our commeice foreign and
inland, is now abandoned, m all its chaotic irregu-
larity, on the pretext that the Government of the
United States has no constitutional control over it!
Washington thought differently, so did JefTeison,
and so did Madison, and in fine, so did lackson him-
self, and ever othey President of the United States
From the origin of our Government under the
piesent constitution to this time, covering a period
of fifty years, an anxious desire to regulate the cui-
rency and exchanges was cherished by each succes-
sive administration, with an admitted constitutional
control over the subject It remained for Mr Van
Buren to discover that all his predecessors had been
violating the constitution, and that h6 alone sustain-
ed it in its sti ict purity ' But it w as unfortunate foi
Mr Van Buren that an attempt w *s so recently
made by the General Gov ernment to contiol and reg-
ulate exchange Ifnojiower existed ovei it, whv
was the matter undei taken1 I ea'l the attention of
gentlemen to the exultalion lelt and so vauntmgly
expicssed m the Globe and in the reports oí Ml.
Secretary Taney and his successor, the present in-
cumbent, Mr Woodbury, when the) told the coun-
try that they had succeeded in then pet-bank sj s-
tem, and by it were giving to us an improved cur-
rency, and more moderate and uniform lates of ex-
change than we ever before had' But now, sir,
when it is found thev have deceived the country,
and that by their tmkenng nostrums they^iave re-
duced order to chaos instead of having the mag-
nanimity to confess their erroi, as thev ought to do,
and retrace their steps they disclaim all constitu-
tional powei over the subject, but propose anothei
experiment' The oug nal andgenmnedemocratic
partv did not act thus 1 hat sa ne patriotic repub
hcan phalanv, who, with the illustrious Madison at
its head, sustained the country in the wai of 1812,
were bi ought by Ipssons of experience honestly to
admit their error m refusing to reincorporate a bank
m 1811, and they sir established tl p hank of 181fe
The exp< riment has been again tued and we are
in the midst oí its sad consequences but the remedv
presci ibed is not that prompted by experience it
is yet proposed to lest another w ild and unknot  n ex-
periment The country, by means of its youthful
vigor and stiength, may sustain itself, but its pros-
perity will, I fear, be greatly retarded
Mr Chairman, I was utterly opposed to the man
aeempnt of om financial concerns through the agen-
cy of Sfate banks*—1 could consent to it only
as a choice ot evils I am not here as a defendei
of these banks Indeed, I openly condemned many
oí them for indiscreetly lending themseh es to the
uncalled-for and unhappj measuie of removmglhe
public deposites from the Bank of the United States
They have now to "flee from the wrath ' of then
inends, the very democratic party by whom thev
were seduced from the even tenor of their way
Yes, sir those vv ho used them to pull down the Bank
of the United States, and held them up to the peo
pie as tiustworthv agents, now turn from them with
uplifted arms, and cry "unclean' unclean1"
And m this way an attempt is made to create an
