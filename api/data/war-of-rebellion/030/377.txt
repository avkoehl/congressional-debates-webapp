ever the difficulties look particularly discouraging I think of a rebel prison, and the contrast is sufficient to put one immediately into a good humor.

I telegraphed you in regard to the discharge of a number of our mutineers, by order of the War Department, for no apparent reason whatever except that their friends at home, aided by Congressional influence, have applied for it. This has a very bad effect on the remaining men, and is decidedly unjust, as is also the commissioning of any mutineer in another regiment. I hope no discharge will be granted to men of this regiment until it is first submitted to me.*

Yours, truly,

WM. J. PALMER.

Four mutineers of Anderson Cavalry, in addition to the two already advised of, have been discharged by Special Orders, War Department, viz, Charles De Ward, Company B; Samuel Hildeburn, Company C; Charles H. Warner, Company G, and Lewis G. Reed, Company G. It would have an excellent effect upon the discipline of the regiment if these discharges be revoked.
