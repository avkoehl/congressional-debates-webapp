those who look to die establishment at this period
oí a national bank, should awake to the reahtv,
that such an event wou'd, at this crisis, pievent the
resumption of specie pavment bv the State banks,
depreciate then paper so as almost to drive it out

increase and piolong the existing emba íassments
is oi should it be forgotten, that even i* the attempt
were now made to procure from England the
necessary specie to put a nat onal bank m opera-
tion, at the very tine when so many of the State
bai ks are endeav onng to obtain it from the Same
sourc°, botn could not sou t td, and the suspended

But sufpo e the bank charteied and put m ope-

claimed b} the iuends cf the late Bank oí the
United Stales to leguhte and contic1 the State in
stitutioas. The capí al of a new na íonal bank, ade-
quate at this pel od foi th^se puiposes, mu t con-
sist, as hcrctofoie sf ted, of a least seventy mil

their capí al one hundred mil'u ns of dollars 1 he
number of the e u stitutions a this period is e ght

augmentation of the eontiollmg povvc is to hepi
any propo.tion to the mciease ol the cumbei and
capital of the institutions sought to be controlled,
the capital of the new legulator must be at least
double that of the old one,  which wou'd make it
seventy millions of dollars     But  we  must atso
consider that the new bank mu«t not only  have
adequat   powers to contro1 the eight hundred and
twenty three State barges, bat also to  eontiol  the
very power which   is clamied  to have  regulated
them, coitmied in existence by the Slate of Penn
sylvania, under achaitei whicn its very allepresi

able to rontrol the regulate , "> 11 the regulated and
as t! e foini r must have been mor  noweiful than
the l?tter, the capital oí the new bank must be at
least double thai of the o'd one     Indeed it mi st
be much greater, in thepie-ise pn port on m which
the power of the old bank as a ¡egulaior exceeded
tiat of the   nstitutions oiei which it exercised a
control    Seventy millions then is the least camtal
upon uh ch the new nark can be askel to be cie-

banks, and control the cur ency     Under the old

to the brink of rum It was saved, and barely
sived, bv its success ve curtailments, but the Stale
banks were destroyed by the operation, and the
country rumed Speaking of that gloomy period,
Mr Niies m his Register of that date says "Prom
all parts of our country we hear of a severe pres-
sure on men m business, a general stagnation of
trade, a large reduction in the price of sfaple arti-
cles—real property is rapidly depreciating Many
highly respeetaole traders have become bankrupts,
three per cent p"r month is offered for the discount
of prom =sorv note , which a little whi'e ago were
considered as good as old gold There are 20,000

of taat gloomy period, as it will be found portrayed
in all the public journals of that date The whole
counti) presen'ed one boundless expanse oí rum
and desolation And how produced? By Ihe enor-
mous expansions, and as sudden contractions, of
this great reg ilator, the Bank of the United States
The present Bank of the United States proclaimed
by Presileit Biddle "o be stronger under its pre-
sent than its orm i charter has iatled to regulate
Ihe currency even ii t! e State of Pennsylvania,
but this very bank, although conducted by one ct
the most remaihable finare ers of this orof any other
country, as well as the rest, has suspended specie
pa men s This same mstitu ion, under its late
charter fiom Congress, failed to regulate the cur-
itiicv in 1819, when the local bpnks bioke almost
v uv isally, and the eld bank rf the Umon did not
succeed as a regulator when, in 1808-9, during

Pvpenment fa led m 1808-9, under the regulation

under the dominion of the late Bank of the United
