HEADQUARTERS JOHNSON'S DIVISION, July 19, 1864.

COLONEL: Nothing unusual has occurred along the lines since last report. Sharpshooting and shelling was quite brisk yesterday; General Gracie's pickets got the best of the sharpshooting; they claim to have killed a Yankee officer of some rank while crossing an open place. General Gracie's brigade collected 1,000 shells and solid shot yesterday, together with 350 or 400 pounds of lead; the other commands were also engaged in the same manner but have not yet forwarded detailed reports. General Gracie suggests that a ration of whisky would be very acceptable to his command.

The following casualties are respectfully submitted: Wise's brigade, wounded, 1. Gracie's brigade, killed, 1 (unnecessarily exposed); wounded, 4. Elliott's brigade, wounded, 6. Ransom's brigade, killed, 2; wounded, 3. Total, 3 killed and 14 wounded.
