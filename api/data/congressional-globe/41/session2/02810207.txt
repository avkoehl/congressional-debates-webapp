My colleague [Mr. Town send] hands me a let-
ter containinga statement of American wages in
some of the same branches of labor. That gen-
tlemen may contrast them with the wages of
Germany, as set forth by the statistical bureau
of Prussia, I will hand the letter to the re-
porters:
Pikenixville, Pennsylvania,
March 21,1870.
Deak Stit: Your favor of tho 16th is before me.
Below I give you the prices paid per (lay to our
principal workmen, as follows:

I am unable to give the wages paid for the above
classes of work either in Engl and, France, or Belgium,
but X am satisfied from the prices, as we have had
them from time to tiinefrom these, that their present
pay is not over an average of 40 per cent, of above.
Respectfully, JOHN GRIFFIN,
General Superintendent.
Hon. Washington Towksf.nd.
Mr. ALLISON. Will the gentleman yield
to me for a question ?
Mr. KELLEY. Yes, sir.
Mr. ALLISON. I will ask the gentleman
whether that is not a report of wages paid by
a company that manufactures what are known
as iron beams for vessels and bridges ?

Mr. KELLEY. They manufacture beams,
rails, and other heavy forms of iron.
Mr. ALLISON. And is it not a company
which with three others has agreed upon an
established list of prices for that class of arti-
cles, which prices embarec the prices abroad,
together with the tariff duty and a profit on the
cost of manufacture ?
Mr. KELLEY. I cannot answer the ques-
tion, because I do not know. I can, however,
say that I have never heard such an allega-
tion. Bat, my dear sir, I do not care what
they have agreed to do, if they are thereby
enabling American workingraen to keep their
children at school, well fed and comfortably
clad, to maintain their seats in church, and
to lay by something for old age and a rainy
day, and not compelling them, as German
workmen in like employments are compelled
to do, to take their wives and daughters as
colaborers into iron and coal mines and
furnaces and rolling-mills, so that they may
together earn enough to eke out a miserable
subsistence.
Mr. ALLISON. I do not take issue with
the gentleman upon that question, but merely
desire to call his attention to the fact thut this
is one of four establishments that have a
monopoly in this business.
Mr. KELLEY. A monopoly ! A workman
a monopolist! A poor workman for^wages a
monopolist! A man who is earning daily wages
by hard work in a mine, a furnace, or a roll-
ing-mill will hardly be regarded as a monopo-
list, though his pay may be ten times what he
could get in his native town. No, sir; such
men are not monopolists, though free traders
constantly denounce them as such.
cincinnati—her woekshops and wobkhen.
Mr. Chairman, 90 per cent, of the cost of
iron in all its forms is the wages of labor,
and the wages of labor go very largely into
wheat and pork and mutton and beef that are
eaten, and woolen clothes that are worn by the
workmen and their families. The wages of
well-paid laborers thus find their way to the
pockets of the farmer and the wool-grower.
Mr. STEVENSON. Will the gentleman
yield to me now for a question 1
Mr. KELLEY. Yes, sir.
Mr. STEVENSON. It seems that the gen-
tleman has just discovered that there are some
manufacturers in Cincinnati. i want to know
whether he has not also discovered that more
than half of the capital and labor and produc-
tion of those manufactories are in the articles
of wood, iron, leather, and paper, upon which
I want the duties reduced, and whether it is
not to the interest of those producers to have
cheap raw material?
Mr. KELLEY. It is the interest of the
working people of Cincinnati that the general
rate of wages shall be maintained at the highest
point. It is not for the interest of any mechan-
ical producer in this country to have the duties
on his productions, or others which involve
much labor, so reduced that the cheap labor
of France, Belgium, Germany, and Britain can
come in competition with them in our home
market. And thus I fully answer the gentle-
man's question.
The gentleman is mistaken. I have not just
discovered that there are manufactories in Cin-
cinnati, for as I heard the gentleman pleading
for a law which would inevitably check their
prosperity and progress and reduce the wages
of labor I thought of old Charles Cist, and
wondered whether his bones were not rattling
in his coffin. From almost the birth of Cin-
cinnati he was a champion of protection, and
did more than any other man to build up her
workshops and manufactories, and more than
twenty years ago devoted a day to conducting
me through many of the largest of them.
But I want to allude further to the remarks
of the gentleman from Ohio, [Mr. Stevenson.]
Speaking of Pennsylvania, he said :
"All! sho is shrewd! New Englandheretofore has
had the reputation of great adroitness in takingcare
of her own interest, but Pennsylvania carries off the
palm. Quietly sho sits looking out for herself, wo
