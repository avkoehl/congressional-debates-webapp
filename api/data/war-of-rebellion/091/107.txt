Nothing new for past tow days. General Sheridan moves on enemy at daylight. To-day enemy attacked Averell in force, and drove him. To-night his command reported at Shepherdstown. He reports that he was attacked by two divisions of infantry. No particulars of the affair. The firing continued at intervals of several hours. The enemy commenced attack at Bunker Hill. All trains sent to rear.
