The company at Pelican Spit should be removed quietly. Spike the gun. Act so that the enemy's attention will not be called to your movements.

To the Foreign Consuls residents of the Town of Galveston, Tex.:

GENTLEMEN: To prevent the effusion of blood and destruction of property which will result from a bombardment of the town of Galveston, I have demanded of the military commandant the surrender of the place, with its fortifications, &amp;c. This demand having been refused, I have the honor to inform you that four days will be allowed you from this date in which to remove your families and property. After that time the bombardment will commence at my earliest convenience.

I have the honor to be, your obedient servant,

HENRY EAGLE,

Commanding U. S. Navy Forces off Galveston, Tex.

JOS. J. COOK, Colonel.
