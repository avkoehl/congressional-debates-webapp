COLUMBUS, OHIO, August 15, 1861.

Honorable S. CAMERON:

Recruiting slower than we had hoped. Will be hastened greatly by your immediately directing mustering in of fifty and squads of five each, until completion of company, and your directing their subsistence accordingly. I pray you to give the instructions at once to the proper officer. Telegraph me what you do.

WM. DENNISON,

Governor.

Governor DENNISON,

Columbus, Ohio:

Instructions were given to Adjutant-General yesterday, and to-day a general order has been issued to receive and recruit men in small squads, subsistence to be furnished by Government. Leave nothing undone to fill up all your regiments immediately. Let me see what Ohio can do to aid the increase now wanted for our Army. Keep me advised.

SIMON CAMERON,

Secretary of War.

HARRISBURG, PA., August 15, 1861.

Honorable SIMON CAMERON,

Secretary of War:

The last infantry regiment of the Reserve Corps, Colonel Taggart, left here on Saturday. Five companies of cavalry are here, and we hope to send you the regiment next week. Fifty companies infantry are about assembling here to fill the new requisitions, and the colonels of the regiments are making up the remainder. We have no regiment sufficiently prepared to send you at once. Will make every exertion to send at least one next week in addition to cavalry.

One battery of artillery left for Washington last night. Two regiments infantry are in process of formation. Cannot start them for a week or ten days. Am doing all that can be done to hurry them on. Two additional batteries could be formed if wanted.
