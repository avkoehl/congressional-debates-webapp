CARTHAGE, March 2, 1863.

Major-General ROSECRANS:

The cavalry from Gallatin has not yet reported nor been seen. The enemy has been scouting all around us, and we can do nothing with these small parties without cavalry.

Respectfully,

GEORGE CROOK,

Brigadier-General.

CAIRO, March 2, 1863.

Major-General ROSECRANS:

Your two telegrams of 1st instant received. Am glad to hear by the last that Captain Fitch has communicated with you. Have sent every gunboat that I have available. Admiral Porter directed me to send all gunboats to him, except those now up Cumberland and Tennessee Rivers. Will send your dispatch to the admiral.

Fleet Captain, Commanding Station.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF COLUMBUS,March 2, 1863 - 4.30 p. m.

Major-General HURLBUT,

Commanding Sixteenth Army Corps, Memphis, Tenn.:

I have just received the following telegram:

PADUCAH, March 2, 1863.

Brigadier-General ASBOTH:

Fort Donelson is again threatened by a force, said to be 8,000, under Van Dorn. I should like to have more infantry and some artillerymen to work the siege guns at the fort.

H. DOUGHERTY,

Colonel, Commanding.

If Van Dorn succeeds at Fort Donelson, he will long for Paducah and Columbus, and I am obliged to trouble you again for cavalry and light artillery, and beg for arms for two regiments of infantry.

As already reported, I have no artillerists in the district to serve the heavy guns, and no light batteries for the field.

Deprived of the garrisons of the three forts on the Tennessee, I have hardly anything wherewith to check an invasion of the six counties between Columbus and the Tennessee, with forces at Paducah and Columbus entirely inadequate.

ASBOTH,

Brigadier-General.

MEMPHIS, TENN.,

March 3, 1863 - 10.30 a. m.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

Van Dorn is reported moving on Fort Donelson with 8,000 men. I have telegraphed to Rosecrans, and to fleet captain at Cairo to send gunboats.

S. A. HURLBUT.
