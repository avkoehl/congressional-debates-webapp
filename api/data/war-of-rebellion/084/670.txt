good supply of prison rations on hand, and, seeing how matters were, went to work and issued them out to the various companies of Enrolled Missouri Militia as fast as they came in. I did this to prevent that confusion and ill feeling which is ever consequent upon soldiers going around pressing their meals. I saw the judge, asked him how many men he had, and if he did not want rations for them. He said he had about thirty; that, by God, he did not want any rations for his men; that if his men could not find rations for themselves they had no business with him. I remarked that I did not know he belonged to the Enrolled Missouri Militia service. He said that he did not; that he was here in command of an independent company of jayhawkers, out upon a jayhawking expedition. This conversation occurred on the public street, and in the middle of a crowd of some fifteen or twenty of his men, who seemed to relish the idea of being commanded by such a captain. I would not take any notice of this were it not for this man's position as circuit judge, and the effect and influence of such sayings and teachings upon men of lower stations. He is also, I understand, endeavoring to get up a regiment for the twelve-months' service. I trust you will succeed in impressing upon the general commanding the importance of adopting some salutary check to these evils. "An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure." If we can prevent these two parties from becoming so heated that they will be bound to ignite, we will have added another proof to the truth of the above old adage. Should nothing be done, one party will in a short time become so elated with the success of their schemes that, as I have before remarked, the authorities may have considerable trouble in bringing them under the law,while at the same time the other party will become so irritated and exasperated that they will be equally unmanageable.

I have the honor to be, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WM. McILWRATH,

Lieutenant and Assistant Provost-Marshal.
