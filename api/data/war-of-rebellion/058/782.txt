His Excellency Governor WATTS,

Montgomery, Ala.:

The emergency seems to require the use of the military forces of the State of Alabama in support of that of the Confederacy in resisting the movements which now threaten your State. May I ask you to place such force under arms immediately and hold in subject to my call. I suggest its concentration at points in easy communication with a line from Meridian to Selma.
