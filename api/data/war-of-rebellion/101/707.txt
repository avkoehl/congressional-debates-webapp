war, from the abolition of slavery, and from the disheartening aspect presented to them in the loss of their fortunes, their sons, and their hopes, which are all swallowed up in the terrible grave dug for them by this huge rebellion. They are now preparing to give way to new capital and new proprietorship.

CONTRASTS IN TREATMENT OF FREEDMEN--EXCEPTIONS.

Of the men who are known as the "old planters" of this country, so far as dealing fairly with the freedmen is concerned in the matter of wages, I have to inform you that as a rule they have paid them more promptly, more justly, and apparently with more willingness than have the new lessees from other parts of the country. There are exceptions to this rule. I allude to some few Northern men who have come with their wealth to settle here in the midst of the ruins. These have done better for the freedmen than any others, not desiring to merely grind a fortune out of the freedmen in one year and then go away (as was the case of most Northern men who undertook the work of plantations). These treat the freedmen humanely and in a manner which cheers and encourages them. They contribute cheerfully to their educational, religious, and social welfare, and I only wish that the character of the few had been that of the many. The change would have been more promising, and the contrast with the old planters far more creditable.

WAGES OF CONSCRIPT LABORERS.

In pursuance with orders from department headquarters and with the energetic and faithful co-operation of the parish provost-marshals, I have collected wages due to conscripts taken under military orders from the plantations into the service of the United States. There was at one time great danger, in consequence of the hurried manner in which these men were forced into the army, that they would be deprived of their wages. I accordingly, and by great labor, instituted measures, approved by you, for the collection of the amounts due, and as a result I have collected the sum of $11,777. 05 and paid to conscripts, $1,521. 13, leaving a balance in my hands of $10,255. 92. A detailed statement showing the amount collected in each parish, the amount paid to conscripts from each parish, and the balance on hand belonging to those taken from each parish, is herewith appended.
