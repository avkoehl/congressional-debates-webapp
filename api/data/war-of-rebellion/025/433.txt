Maj, General H. W. HALLECK, General-in-Chief:

In answer to yours of yesterday I proposed to furnish all General Sherman calls for the Helena - 12,000 - leaving about 13,000 to operate in Arkansas. This last force I propose to move cautiously till the downriver move is accomplished. Blunt's force Arkansas - about - 18,000 - is still at north base of Boston Mountains, scouts extending near to Arkansas River.
