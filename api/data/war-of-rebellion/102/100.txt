LEAVENWORTH, April 14, 1865.

Adjutant HEWETT:

Have you any further intelligence from Stant Watie's forces? Have you heard from Colonel Blair since he left Fort Scott? I telegraphed from Paola to Colonel Blair to send Brayton's commission by mail. Has he done so? Answer.

JAS. G. BLUNT,

Major-General.

FORT SCOTT, KANS., April 14, 1865.

Major-General BLUNT,

Fort Leavenworth:

Have no further intelligence of Stand Watie's forces. I have not heard from the colonel since yesterday morning. He had not then reached Humboldt. He said the roads were so bad that it was almost impossible to get along. He seems to think that the Indian war is a humbug. Brayton's commission was mailed to him on the 10th, and should have started the 11th.
