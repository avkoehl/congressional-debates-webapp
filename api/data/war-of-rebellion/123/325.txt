P. H. WATSON,

Assistant Secretary:

Reports from recruiting officers to-day show that enough men are returned to fill sixteen regiments. We have about 3,000 guns on hand, embracing five different kinds, and generally returned arms of inferior quality. I hope that sufficient arms will be forwarded at once.

General C. P. BUCKINGHAM,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Washington:

MY DEAR GENERAL: Your dispatch of this date is received. I hope the draft in Kentucky will not be pretermitted.

At all events, let there be no whisper that Kentucky will be excluded from the draft until I have had a chance to fill the quota of Kentucky. We are now doing admirably and are getting good men-men of position and property.

Yours, very truly,

JNO. W. FINNELL,

Adjutant-General Kentucky Volunteers.
