Captain Ziegler's battery on this as on former occasions did splendidly and inflicted severe injury upon the enemy. My officers and men behaved well. Colonel Rose and his brave Seventy-seventh Pennsylvania Regiment deserve notice for the gallant manner in which they resisted the advance of and skirmished with the enemy until driven by overwhelming numbers into the main lines. The Thirtieth Indiana, most of them new recruits, under Captain Lawton, commanding the regiment, stood by the colors to the man and fought well. I had the honor of being on their portion of the line most of the time, and can speak of my own knowledge. The Eighty-fourth Indiana, under Major Taylor, on the left of the front line, maintained their position bravely. The Seventy-fifth Illinois, under its gallant colonel (Bennett), discharged its whole duty. The Ninth Indiana, as on all former occasions, with its brave and daring colonel (Suman), did their part. I regret to be compelled to record the severe wound of Colonel Waters, of the Eighty-fourth Illinois, in the upper part of the right arm, from a farreaching minie to the rear of the line. The Eightieth Illinois, under Captain Cunningham, did a willing part in being shifted from one point to another during the engagement where danger would threaten most.

I return my grateful acknowledgements to my staff officers and non-commissioned staff for the efficient and willing assistance given me on the field.
