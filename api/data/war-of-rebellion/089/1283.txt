HEADQUARTERS,Wilmington, December 20, 1864.

General BRAGG,

Commanding Department of North Carolina:

GENERAL: On my way to observe the enemy off new Inlet, I beg leave to make a few suggestions, in case anything should delay or prevent my speedy return. I think the citizens should be notified of the imminence of attack, that all business should be suspended except that of transportation and that purely connected with the defense. It should be decided what is preferable to save and that at once, for stripped as we are of forces, we shall have little time before the enemy will be upon the city.

Very respectfully,

W. H. C. WHITING,

Major-General.
