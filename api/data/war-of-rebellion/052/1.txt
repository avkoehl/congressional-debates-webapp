Colonel E.M.McCOOK,

Commanding First Division Cavalry:
COLONEL: The general commanding cavalry directs that you order Colonel Watkins to move two of his regiments to Huntsville,leaving one at Flint River. This arrangement will give greater facility in watching the crossing of the river.

I am, colonel, very respectfully,your obedient servant,

LESTER L. TAYLOR,

Lieutenant and Aide-de-Camp.

Major W.H.SINCLAIR.

Assistant Adjutant-General:

Order received. It is a mistake to think that moving two regimens to Huntsville gives greater facilities for watching the crossings. If the river is to be guarded thoroughly, it would be better to move more of the force this way or else to make a radical change. There is but one Crossing to guard near Huntsville. The two regiments here are already overburdened with duty, and I would recommend that Colonel Watkins be moved in this direction instead of the other. In addition, continuous use will totally destroy the transportation necessary to carry supplies between Huntsville and Flint River. This change will increase the duty and very materially lessen the efficiency of my command, and mast necessarily involve a change also in the disposition of both the First and Second Brigades. Look at the map. Please answer.

Respectfully,

E.M.McCOOK,

Colonel,Commanding.
