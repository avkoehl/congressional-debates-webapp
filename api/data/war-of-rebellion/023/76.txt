CORINTH, June 30, 1862.

Major-General McCLERNAND,

Jackson:

The defeat of General McClellan near Richmond has produced another stampede at Washington. You will collect as rapidly as possible all the infantry regiments of your division and take advantage of transportation by every train to transport them to Columbus and thence to Washington City. General Quinby will be directed to turn over to you certain troops of his command. The part of General Wallace's division at Memphis will go up the Mississippi and the portion at Grand Junction will follow as soon as relieved. All transports at Pittsburg and Hamburg will be filled with troops from this place. The entire campaign in the West is broken up by these orders and we shall very probably lose all we have gained. I will do all I can with the few forces left. You go to a new theater; success attend you.

Major-General.

Major-General BUELL,

Huntsville:

Lieutenant-Colonel Bennett, of the rebel army, has arrived at General Thomas' camp, with permission from you to come to my headquarters for the purpose of exchange. The impropriety of sending rebel officers to my headquarters for any purpose whatever must be manifest. You can exchange them or parole them for the purpose of effecting their own exchange if you deem it expedient, but under no circumstances should they be sent through our armies to my headquarters.

Major-General.

General HALLECK:

I have given no rebel officer, knowing him as such, permission to go to your headquarters for any purpose. I never, to my knowledge, saw or heard of Colonel Bennett.

General HALLECK:

General Thomas report that the engines which he had in use have broken down. Is it not possible to spare others until he can get some forage from Iuka? I made other arrangements for provisions, but calculated on the Iuka road for forage and we are suffering for it.
