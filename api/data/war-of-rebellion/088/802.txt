The lieutenant-general commanding desires me to say that we have no troops at Reams' Station. Reports from corps commanders this morning are that all is quiet.

HEADQUARTERS TENTH ARMY CORPS, September 12, 1864.

Brigadier-General WILLIAMS,Assistant Adjutant-General:

Nothing of any importance on my line. The enemy are working on four flying saps steadily. I presume they are for pickets, and probably to gain the crest of the hill and drive my pickets away. Will commence this morning on a countermine at the Hare house, pushing forward the old work. The enemy are throwing up a work on their second line, just in rear of the Crater. There is also new rebel battery on the foot of Cemetery Hill. The work is well covered by woods. It opened at 7.45 this morning. Large quantities of timber are being hauled from Petersburg toward Weldon road.

D. B. BIRNEY,

Major-General.
