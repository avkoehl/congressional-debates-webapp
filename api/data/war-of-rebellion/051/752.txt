At this time General Sherman fortunately arrived with his staff on his way to Corinth and escorted by the Thirteenth Regulars, numbering 240 men.

Upon the return of the flag, the enemy opened a vigorous fire from his artillery, but without much effect. At about 12 o'clock a charge upon the right was made by two of my companies to drive the enemy from their dangerous proximity to the train, which was successful, but Lieutenant Millis, following his advantage too far, was captured with 10 or 12 of his men. The engagement lasted until 3 p. m., at which time the enemy was driven from the field.

The whole number engaged in the action upon our side of the Sixty-sixth Indiana was 175; Thirteenth Regulars, 240; making the aggregate considerably less than 500 men.
