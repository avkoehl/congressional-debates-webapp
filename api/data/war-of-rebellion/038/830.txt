[S. D.] Lee at Hall's Ferry, Redford and Hankinson's roads, and [A. W.] Reynolds here. The line is too extended, and with but three brigades, and having no cavalry, cannot properly watch it. Will do my best thereat. Will go in to-morrow to see you on the subject. General Loring left Hankinson's at 11 o'clock, and has gone to Bovina.

Respectfully,

C. L. STEVENSON.

Vicksburg, May 4, 1863.

Major General C. L. STEVENSON:

You must establish a line of couriers from your headquarters to this place, and constantly and frequently keep these headquarters advised of every movement and necessary information. The attention of the lieutenant-general commanding is drawn as much to the Big Black as in your direction, and unless he is kept constantly advised of every movement, he is unable to act with any satisfaction or certainty. A line of couriers, with a station every 2 or 3 miles, would admit of rapid operations. Last night two barges, loaded with commissary stores, and a tug, were burned.

J. THOMPSON,

Assistant Inspector-General.

Vicksburg, May 4, 1863.

Major General C. L. STEVENSON:

You say nothing of General [T. H.] Taylor's brigade or of Moore's. General [J. C.] Moore is at Warrenton. You will take command of his brigade in case of necessity. The lieutenant-general commanding will be glad to see you to-morrow.

I am, very respectfully,

J. THOMPSON,

Assistant Inspector-General.

HANKINSON'S, May 4, 1863.

Lieutenant-General PEMBERTON,

Commanding:

GENERAL: Three of my brigades are now with me; the other has been halted near the point designated. I will have the DIVISION in position to-day. A train which I directed to move early the morning after I left has not arrived. Please have supplies sent us to-night at the point assigned us.

I am, general, respectfully, your obedient servant,

C. L. STEVENSON.

Vicksburg, May 4, 1863.

Lieutenant Colonel T. N. WAUL,

Comdg. Fort Pemberton, via Grenada:

Leave 300 of your troops under a reliable officer at Fort Pemberton, and come at once down the river to Snyder's Mill with the remainder of your command. Your cavalry must also be brought down to Vicksburg. Telegram has been sent to Yazoo City to send you a boat, in case you have none, immediately.

J. C PEMBERTON.
