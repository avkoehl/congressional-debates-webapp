for the consequences. I inclose you two dispatches lately sent to the President, which I wish destroyed after being read. They were sent in cipher, and are too important to be risked in crossing the Mississippi; also copy of tow letters* which were forwarded a few days since. Your relations with the President will, I am sure, be good; the interests of the country require they should be so. Will you impress upon him, if you have the opportunity, that I am striving for the general good of the cause, and to merit his personal regard; that, let my enemies say what they may, I will honestly and faithfully carry out the instructions of the War Department and his wishes to the best of my abilities. I hope you will urge the appointment of general officers, as recommended by me at the close of the campaign last spring. The inclosed memorandum exhibits clearly the necessity for appointing general officers. Of seven major-generals three only are commanding divisions, whilst the return shows twelve divisions of troops in the department. A good efficient lieutenant-general who can ably support the department commander is greatly needed. I doubt whether any aid can be expected in this respect. General Walker, as well as Magruder, can be promoted; the former is ranked by both Pirce and Forney, and unless he is promoted cannot be retained in command of a district. Communication with Richmond is growing more difficult daily. You can and must have appreciated the necessity of granting more powers to the department commander. He should have the power of assigning to duty all appointments or promotions created under the law (subject to the approval of the PRESIDENT and confirmation by the Senate). He should have a controlling influence over the Treasury agency established at Marshall. The whole control of cotton is in the hands of judge Gray; the support of the army is dependent upon his action. he has tendered his resignation, is overwhelmed by the responsibilities thrown upon him, and has not the business capacity for conducting the purchasing bureau upon a scale commensurate with our wants. I feel a delicacy in advancing these opinions as I am department commander; but they are necessities created by the circumstances and the times in which we live. If I cannot be trusted another commander should relieve me with whom these powers can be safely confided. I do not court the responsibilities of this vast command. I shall labor conscientiously to discharge them, but the greatest kindness the President could confer upon me would be to relieve me by some one in whose ability as well as correctness he can implicitly confide.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

E. KIRBY SMITH,

General.
