Brevet Major-General KIMBALL,

Commanding First Division:

The general commanding directs that you detail thirty-two six-mule teams and wagons to report to the superintendent of railroad repairers at Lick Creek railroad crossing to-morrow morning at daylight. The trains will remain on duty with the construction corps for several days, and the teamsters had better bring five days' supplies for themselves and teams. He also desires you to detail fifteen men daily to work with the teams to assist in loading and hauling timber for the railroad. Put the men under good officers, and direct the commanding officer of the detachment to report to superintendent construction corps also.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WM. H. SINCLAIR,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

Brigadier-General ELLIOTT,

Huntsville, Ala.:

The general commanding directs me to say that he has sent Captain Stansbury to Knoxville to order your troops to come to Rogersville Junction by rail. Your transportation will be unloaded at Knoxville and your command will wait at the junction till it comes up.

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS FOURTH ARMY CORPS,Lick Creek, East Tenn., March 28, 1865.

Major-General WOOD,

New Market:

Move up your division to Rogersville Junction. You best camp will be about one or two miles west of the junction, leaving room for the Second Division to camp close to the depot, as they have no transportation. Leave a company of about twenty-five men at New Market and relieve the two companies of the Thirtieth Indiana at Mossy Creek by about twenty-five men. All these small posts must intrench strongly. This is only a temporary arrangement. If the weather proves inclement there is no emergency which would require that you should march. If you have stores to move up call on Mr. Bornell, transportation agent at Knoxville, for empty cars.

D. S. STANLEY,

Major-General.

The telegraph office will be at this place to-morrow. At present it is at Rogersville Junction.

D. S. STANLEY,

Major-General.
