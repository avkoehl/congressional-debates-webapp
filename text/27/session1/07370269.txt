APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

Repeal of Independent Treasury, fye.—Mr. Pickens.

will be compelled to ship .specie. This will have
to be done, or there most be suspension, or a re-
sort to mote Government credits to sustain the
Bank. Nothing can be raisfd equal to specie, bat
the credits of the General Government. And as it
will be a Government Bank-, you will consider it
your duty to sustain its credit; and it is as certain
as the law of trade, tbat, under expansion, the spe-
cie must be shipped to meet foreign exchange; or
the Government must supply the plac« by the crea-
tion of stocks to meet the demand; or there must be
suspension. This has often been the case with the
Bank of England. In 1792, Clavier, with the
French financiers, through assignats and cashing
drafts, made a run upon the Bank, which threw
the nation into convulsions, and the Government
was obliged to resort to exchequer bill? to sussain
the institution. Pitt tras always compelled, when
a foreign debt was pressed, or when heavy dis-
bursements were made to the continental armies
in tneir wars, to resort to exchequer bills to pre-
serve the Bank ftom ruin. Under a large foreign
debt, and with local expansion created by Govern-
ment credits, no National Bank can, in ihe nature
of things, stand without constant aid from Go-
vernment. The difference in 1816 and the
present time is as wide as poss.ble. There
is now a heavy foreign debt pressing; and any
thing calculated to swell loeal expansion will
create exchanges against us, and a conse-
quent ran for specie. There can be no other
result. We might sustain a National Bank,
if the Government owed a large debt, and that
debt was principally due in this country. Resting
upon the revenues of the Government, a Bank
might then sustain itself; but even then it would be
difficult, if the States were to expand their credits.
What sustained the lust Bank was the public de-
posites that it held and discounted upon. These
surplus deposites were alone justified by the iaet
that we had a heavy war debt to pay off, which
authorized ihe Government to collect a beavy reve-
nue; and it was used by the Bank as a central fund
to check and ¿iscount upon. It was to the Bank
the same thing as if the Government had brought
so mucb specie from Mexico, and placed it in vault
for the purposes of banking. The following is the
table of deposites for each year:

The average annual amount ot public deposues,
during that time, was $6,717,191 17. That, at
simple iDteiest, would be $7.523.253 92, If
they issaed three to one in deposite, then it
was $22,569,662 53. After removal from ihe
United Siates Bank, ihe public deposites in the State
banks were a^ follow*:

It was these deposites of public money, used fur
banking purposes, that creatrd a central fund,
wtt'ch enabled She bank to do such sucees-f-il busi-
ness m .-¿change. They did business upon pub-
lic money, íumiíhed by uxatioii; and having the
collection K?d disbursement of t-.:e reveiues, they
concentrated in their haurts all the exchanges of
the country. The consequence wa«, that iheir
chief profits were made from exchange.-; so much
so, that i'i ' ne year they had the profits, from biiis
of ihis kind, on an amount of §160 000,000. It
was a to i.iopoly; and as they han r unite, funds
with whicn to iperaie, there could be no compe-
tition. Unless you give a National Bank heavy
public deposites, it can do bat h tie more busi-
ness in exchange than any other Bank. Hence it
is, that a public debt w ihe v«y soul and
strength of a National Bank. A^ soon as the pub-
lic deposites were removed, the Bank began to de-
cline, until it was rechartered by the Pennsylvania
Legis'ature. Then it was that Mr. Biddle pro-
claimed in a letter that he had obta'ned a charter
stronger than ever—stronger for all useful purpo-
ses. But what was the result? In little more than
a year from this declaration ihe B?nk began to
fail and run down. The difference was, that the
Bank had to pay out to the State of Pennsylvania
$5,000,000 as a bonus; and, instead of receiving
about an average of $7,000,000 of public deposites
to bank upon, it received nothing; and the conse-
quence wa«, that it lost the business of exchange.
It had no favors from Government; and its capital
being large, it was induced to seek a foreign
market, under the hopes of making large dividends
for such a capital. From this consideration, also,
it was tempted to speculate in stocks and produce;
and the more extended its operations became, the
more complicated its concerns, and the more com-
plete were its disasters and final overthrow. It is
only Government stocks, public debt, public depo-
sites and revenues, that can sustain aUniled Slates
Bank; an^l then with great difficulty and gieat loss
to productive labor. The recent developments
connected with the United Slates Bank at Philadel-
phia—that dim charnel-house through which we can
be—
"--------Led only by those gleams
"Which foul corruption lights"—
ought to make us hesitate long before we would
wLh to see another such created. Who can lisok
on the vouchers for more than $600,000 said to be
burnt, and other transactions disclosed in relation
to that institution, without feeling his heart grow
sick with disgust for ihe weakness and depravity
of frail human nature? And, yet, while all these
things are fresh around us, we see men eager to
ruth again into the same temptations. Similar ex-
amples m,<?ht also be furnishe i on a smaller scale,
in hundreds of minor institutions throughout the
country for the last three years It cannot be
otherwise where deposite and issue, discount and
circulation, are concentrated in the same in-
stitution. The temptation is too great for
the frailty of human nature. If we must
have banks, let th.m be sepaiated into
tho e of deposite .and issue; keep the tsoo powers
in distinct institutions. There can be no permanent
safety to the community where the two powers are
habiually united in one and the same, corpora-
tion. If paper circulation is praclically ¡o become
the mea-'ue of value, then it ought to be regulated
by the ^overeisn power of ihe community; for it
becomes as much an attribute of sovereignty as the
power to "coin money and rfgu'ate the value
thereof."
But, Mr. Chairman, we are told that a Naiion-
al Bank is essential to regulate exchanges; and I
rather think that this assertion has had as much
weight in the community as any other considera-
tion. Kanv have been induced to believe that
such was the tact. There never was a greater
fallacy. The true meaning ot real exchange is the
difference between cash&nd a bill drawn-on a givtn
point. This could alone be regulated by the state
of trade between ihe two points. But, in the
modern use of the term, U bud come to be consi-
deied us merely the difference between bank-notes
of different maiiiulions, or the difference m the
price of bank paper. A bank note was at specie
par, or m.dcr it, according to i--* convertibility.
Exchange is now considered the difference between
the-apacity of bank: to convert their paper into
specie at one point, and their capacity at another
point. Pur instance: in ¡he city of Áogusla, I
beli ve. ihe bani;i all suspended—"xcep", perhaps,
th« Plant! rs and Mechanics; and (lie consequence
was, that t  ere was a difference in favor of ihe
paper of tba' m'titutirn of some five or ax per
cent. So that, if thi? tie exchange, then thi le was a
difference ot (ive or six per cent, in exchange from
one street in Augusta on ano'hrr street in :,:e Sim-'
city. The same might be said as to the HaT-bur?
Bank, which is on one sid>? of the nvtr, and the
banks on the other side. It is only the difference
in the price 'of bank paper, as compared with spe-
cie par; it is a mere absurdity to call it exchange,
and the argument founded en it is a mere catch-
penny argument. Now, in this modern sense of
exchange, I lay down the proposition, that the late
United States Bank never did equalize exchanges;
We have heard it boldly asserted that all this was'
regulated by the last Bank, as if we were to forget,
the past. Cross-road politicians and county court
lawyers, straddling eider barrels, with racoon-
skins around their necks, have recklessly and igno-
rantly made these assertions to gull and deceive a..
credulous people. Counting-house clerks, with a-
quill behind their ear, whs never read any thin  but;,
the prince-current in some foreign paper or in Ben-
nett's Herald, will gravely lecture the country
about equalizing exchanges, with as much pre-
sumption as if they were the paires conscripli of the
land.
Now let us look at the history of this matter
from the records, during the full operation of, the
last United States Bank. I present you a table
taken frttn. Senate document No. 457, session of
