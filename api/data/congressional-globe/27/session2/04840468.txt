CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
'without violating wantonly the prohibition in the contingent
appropriation to use it for any bat ordinary expenses
la pawing, however, let me next ask who imposes this
«53,000 burden? Who causes this S53,000 deficiency? Who
makes thi? monstrous arrearage? Who transcends in this way
the estimates of last year? Who starts it? Who urges It suc-
cessfully? Who is the author of it? Who the father? Let the
journals reply Mr W had been taunted enough on matters
like these, when new appropriations had been formerly asked,
not by him, but by other departments, after the annual esti
mates bad been sent m—and by some Senators, also, who now
seem to live m rather glass houses At first, a certain Charles
F Mitchell—nota little notorious—went foi ward in this matter
But, when he failed, who next asked for this enormous amount?
and who succeeded, in obtaining it? The chairman himself,
{Mr Evaíís 1 Not, he -admitted, m the same form, but in a
«hanged form, more expensive and wasteful, as well as ad
¡mirably adapted to mislead, though, without doubt, not so de
signed Mitchell's resolution contemplated on its face a pur
chase of books, and specified the kinds of books It provided
*lthat tke Clerk be directed to procure" the books "from the
respective pubh&ktrs," butMr Evans's merely provided that
he should furnish them to the members
The first form might well alarm, as it expressly looked to
"buying oi the publishers the last might not alarm, as it did not
look to buying, if the Hou&e or the Government had enough of
such books on hand One necessarily involved expense, and
was rejected the other might not, and succeeded Hence, the
Senator from Illinois says, members of the other House have
an formed him they supposed no purchases were to be made
"What majority would, then, have knowingly voted an expense
of $53,000 like this?
Again, sir Mitchell's resolution in enumerating the books,
<hd not specify the Documentary History by Clarke and Force
ButMr Evans's, by a change from Mitchell's, inform refrained
from enumerating any paiticular books, but said generally,
euchashad been dehveied to the preceding House, and thus
was broad enough toembraceapartofCldrfceandFoice s work,
which Mitchell had accidentally or designedly omitted Who
flung this new an 1 great burden on an embarrassed Tieasury?
Who then apprized the House that they were thus voting
away $53,000? But would you, sir, and the Senate, believe it,
that the purchase also appears afterwards to have been made
no as to extend to volumes of that work which had not been
even printed much less distributed, when the former House
reased to exist? On this point, certain information had been
asked, but couldnotbe obtained Such, howevei, would seem
to be the fact, on the face of these proceedings for Congress
refused to buy the 2d and 3d volumes of that work, as late as
May, 1840, by yeas and nays, in both Houses,—(here is the rec
ord,>—yet it seems likely, from the account, that these very
"volumes have been bought and distributed since March 1841,
under this hasty and general resolu ion of only one House,
passed near midnight, and nobody, f robably, dreaming that it
was to cover any pait of that woik beyond the fijst volume, or
any part not already on hand and paid for This is the appar
entcondiuon of the whole subject How the exact tiuth may
be, on this last point, it is hor ed the ehauman will explain, as
it is no part of my design to do injustice either to him or the
lespectable publishers of that woi k
Mr W aaul he diílered irom some of Ins friends as to the
■value of that, and some of the other works m an historical and
political view He appreciated them highly, and wished
to see them properly diffused over the whole country, but
not to be done in a manner ill undaistood—in a midnight
bustle—with little more than a quorum present, under a form
Íiuestionable in its character hasty inconsiderate, and not
áiriy or fully sancuone i by a m ijoruy of both Houses
Stuke this clause for books our of the genenl contingent,
and take it up in a separate bill, and then all can be nut right
aa to the past After that, the amendment in his hand, part of
which was offered last Saturday would put all right i* to the
future in thiscourse there was nothing invidious Then both
Houses will stand on an equality—both be served alike—both
obtain works in the same way, iid to he same extent, ifatall
He had never voted for such dwtubulinn* and piobably never
should But others thought differently from him—acted differ
ently—and had then right, as he had Ins All he now asked
•was for equal, open, intelligible dealing ir both Houses, and on
alt matters, peiaonal as^well is public
The provisions he sTouid soon move looked to that, and
regulated this matter by law, for us all, and on the same terms
This course would enable us, also, to see if the books now m
dispute were all purchased, o* should have been, considering
what the Government already owned of some of them, and if
the prices given were reasonable, looking to the large amount
bought at once, as well as whether some volumes have not
been purchased, which did not come within the terms of the
resolution of the other House
Mr ARCHCK thought, as the question of concealing the ob-
jectof the appropriation had been mooted, the fair way would
be to adopt the motion instanler to strike out the word' books "
and let a subsequent amendment be made for a distinct appro
priation of 853 QiQ for these books
Mr EVANS had thought of that before, but he could not
consent to it now, beciuse it was a mere matter of form and
would only tend to further d«Iay, asthete would be discussion
raised, not onl/ in the Senate, but in the other House, and the
whole bill might be lost by it
Mr KING showed that, years gone by the Senate had set its
face against this system of appropriation fordistiibution, and if
the House chose to pursue a different cours , the Senate at least
should interfere, so far as not to z\ ve its sanction to it The Sen
ate knew the course to be pursued, and had acted on it and he
thought It was now time to use whatever influence It possessed
in checking the system As to delay he had frequently urged
the propriety of making a distinct appropriation bill early in
every session, embracing nothing but the ordinary charges of
the Governmem, thereby leaving all other appropuations, dis
putable in their nature, to become distinctive measures, so that
they could be examined and a Ij usted on their own merits
He did notsuppose any memoei ofthe Senate was opposed to the
payment of a liability properly incurred by the Hou^e, but it was
highly necessary that all liabilities of th« contingent fund should
be authorized ma correct manner If the chairman of the Com-
mittee on Finance would not accept the proposition of the Sen
ator from Virginia [Mr Archer ] he himself shoull offer an
amendment, that is, incase the motion to strike out the word
"books" should be adopted His proposition would be, after
¿hat motion should have been adopted, to reduce the sum ap
ftv£)3ftte4 m the eJauw to $45,335 85, and then to rnafce a sep-
arate appropriation of «53 000, if that be the correct amount
for these books—statingthem in detail.
Mr WRIGHT saul ne was very sorry to find himself com
polled to take any part in this debate He hoped, however, it
was not necessary foi him to say that he had no interest m de
laying thermal action on the bill, nor was it his object to do so
Rut, at the same time, he must say that he was not desirous
that the proposition which had been just announced to the Sen
ate by the Senator from Alabama should be adopted, it was
quite as unsatisfactory to him, as was the present appropriation
bill, and he would assign, as briefly as possible the reasons
why it was unsatisfactory The proposition came up aa the
supply of a deficiency in the contingent expenses of the House
of Representatives, and he understood the chairman of the
Finance Committee to say, this morning, that it was in the usual
form of such appropriations
Mr EVANS stated, that what he had said was, that it was
such an appropriation as was usually made out of the contin
gent fund                                                               , ,
Mr WRIGHT said he believed—and he intended to convince
the Senate, if he could, that he was correct in that belief—that
this was the first attempt to make such an appropriation out* of
the contingent fund, and that whei ever such appropriations
have been made, it has been done by specific grants, uncon
nected with the contingent expenses of eithei House He ("Mr
W ) had taken pains to ascertain something of the history of
legislation upon this subject, and he had ftund, in the ses
sum of 1836 while upon the appropriation bill for that year,
under the ordinary appropriations for the contingencies of both
Houses, this item Toi furnishing such members oí the
House of Representatives as had not received the same under
a former order of the House, copies of the Diplomatic Corre
spondence, American State Papers, the Register of Debates,
Elliot's Debates, and theregistiation ofthe Land Laws, provided,
that if there wpre any sur¡ lii« hooks copies of which had been
distributed to other membeis, remaining m the library of Con
gress, they should be distributed, a copy to each of tho^e mem
bers who had not received the ?ame He (Mr W )should never
forget the encumstance, that when the bill came to the com
mittee, a member of that committee, and a respected member
—the Senator from M ssouri—said, 'Sink the bill, or stuke out
this provision " It was at the close of a short session, at the
expiration of a Congress The public services of those who
were to receive the books were almon at an end Exertinsc
upon the Senator from Missouri what personal influence he
could, he prevailed upon him to permit the committee to report
the bill It was reported, and the Senator from Missouri then
opposed it, in his place, and every member of the committee
present (and there weie but four) signified to the Senate that if the
bill were permitted to pass this should be the end of the actior
of the Senate upon the subject of book appropriations The
bill did pass the ¡senate and passed the House of Representa
tives, and became a law The question came up once in two
years Weil the session of 1839 came on, and what then took
place? The bill came down to the Senate there was a vivid
recollection In this body upon the subject ofthe book appio
pnations there was then no attempt to cover up the appro
pnttion under the head of contingency
Mr EVANS deined to remind the Senator fiom New York
that that was entuely a different work which it was proposed
to pay for by that appropnation The appropriation for that
purpose could not be paid out of the contingencies of either
House.
Mr WRIGHT would follow up the history of the book mit
tei a little further, and he hoped the honorable chairman of the
committee would listen to what he was going to say, and he
would find that lie (Mr Wright) was m possession of more in
formation relating to this subject than was contained m the doc
ment before them He would teil them how the Senate acted
upon this matter Ihey stiuck out the whole proposition and
sent the bill back amended to the House of Representatives
The House lefused to cone ir in the amendments And the
Senate then consented to recede from so much of its amen 1
ment as consistid of an appropriation of money upon the
contract, an 1 insisted upon so much as struck out the distnbu
tion of books, and the matter was finally settled upon that
ground He would not now enter into a controversy respect
mg that contract It was well known here The money was
appropriated under a contract, but they refused to give the
books to members of Congress A controversy arose on the
last night of the session, and late at night, between the two
Houses, and the fate of the whole civil and diplomatic appro
gnation bill stood upon the issue of that controversy The
enate took the mildest possible course, andat last requested a
conference, the request was granted, the conferees met, ard
the proposition agreed upon was th s that Senators should
have no books, and that if the House insisted upon having the
books, they should have them They did insist they adopted
the report ofthe conferees, as did this body
Now, (continued Mr W ) I come to enter upon an important
inquiry Here is a resolution which has passed the House,
and my attention has been drawn to it within the last ten
minutes That the Clerk of the House be directed to furnish
to such members as had not already received the same, such
books as were furnished to members of the last House Now,
sir, I have been examining the journals all this morning, and
I do not find that the last House directed to be furnished to
themselves any books They may however, have been entitled
under some of our former laws, for the publishing and dis
tnbuting to the members of the House of Re presentan vea,
without exception, to the value of $117 each But this was to
furnish those who had not been furnished at the iormer session
But those were not books ordered to be distributed to the mem
bers at the last precedióse session, except the Documentary
History Ana Jhe appropriation for that purpose was not made
by that Congress And I ask members whether they are pre
pared to say, whether the accounts for books furnished to
members could be properly paid under this resolutioa
Does that contract exist? I say it does not There is now a
permanent law—or at least q joint resolution, which is equiva
lent to a law—for the distribution of this Documentary History
The honorable chairman has done me a favor by eivmgme
a part of the history of the distribution of this work, and I choose
to continue that history An item of appropriation lately pro
duced was one of between six and seven thousand dollars
to Clarke and Force Now, where are the $1,500 which were
previously appropriated under the resolution which I have
before refei red to? The resolution of a single House of Con
gress cou*d not reach the case The books were public prop
erty, and must be distributed bylaw With regard to the State
papers now within the capítol, you cannot reach them by a
resolution of a single House The resolution did not authorize
the Clerk to touch a single volume of those books, but that he
should go to the publishes and buy others, which be did And
this brings me to the monstrous abuse which grew out of this
course of proceeding The publishers of these works come
about you with repiesentations of their immense importance to
the public, and the imprac'icability of procuring their publica
tion without assistance fiom the public funds, and we accord
mgly, with great liberality, order the publication and pay for
it well, when the publishers r ave furnished us fifteen hundred
or two thousand copies, they take care to print five thousand
for themselves, at the expense of only the press work and paper
Theie were looms in the Capitol now filled with them They
undersell us, and they get their copies off This is the abuse,
and I now call on the Senatorio correctthat abuse L"tacom
mittee investigate the facts, and report to us, Jet us clearly
ascertain the folly of the course we have been pursuing, let us
pay for what we are obliged to pay and let us understand
what books were properly distributed under the resolution of
the Senate, and I will be the last man to repudiate the payment
for those which we ought m rea ily to pay for But I desire to
know the*e tact*, for I denv that this item of expense has any
connexion with this bill at all It is entirely foreign to it We
might as well take from the contingent fund a sum of money to
pay our board bills I am perfectly sure that if the chairman
desires to facilitate the passage of the bill, he cannot for
ward his v ews so well as by acceding at once to this amend
ment
Mr EVANS denied that the Documentary History of the
Rev lution alluded to by the Senator in the course of his re
marks, had any thing to do with the subject This he explained
at some length He contended that the assertion that members
did not know what they were voting for, was ridiculous
Mi YOUNG observed that he had been positively assured of
the fact he had stated by several members
Mr EVANS said if they thd not know what they were about,
they should have known it lie had been urgently solicited by
more than a hundred members to introduce theresolution He
could refer to several instance  in which books were printed,
authorized by resolution ofthe Senate, and distributed to mem
bersof the Senate, and this very session the balance of books
so authoiized had been disposed of—he alluded toDufTGreen's
reprint of the Land Laws
The Senator ?ays a great many of these books have been
bought, and are on hand, and asks, why were they not given
out, instead of new purchases being made? They are locked
up in the State Department, and Congress has no control over
them There are no copies m the possession of Coegress, ex
ceptm the various offices and libraries All have been appro
pi ated or used And as to the rfumber of copies printed for
speculation o\er and above the number ordered by Congress,
the Senator was mistaken There were only 750 copies of
Gales and Seaton's books printed m addition to the 750 ordered
ty Congress, and these surplus copies have been on hand ten or
twelve years The puce of them was about $12 a copy, and
when the Clerk of the House was orlered to prov de them, he
could no nothing else than buy them whei ever he could get
them and they could not be got for sale a y wheie but where he
did get them
Mr 1OUNG reasserted that the gentlemer ofthe other House
who had stated the faet to him, oí several members not being
aware that the books were to be puichased, never would have
suffered the resolution to pass if they knew its real object He
did not mean that all those who had spoken to him on the sub
jecthad \oted foi the resolution Many of them did not But
many who did vote for it understood from the general íumor
through the House that they were books already belonging to
the Government But he would puttie matter m its true light,
by asking the ¡senator from Maine Would he say that if the res 
lution had been a direct proposition to lay out ©53000 for
books, to be distributed to 117 members, u could have been
pa¡-.sed?
Mr HUNTIJNGTON pointed out two resolutions adopted by
the Senate foi the distribution of books—the American State Pa
pers published bv Gales and Seaton One was on the 14th
October, 1837, at the special session
Mr WRIGHT knew nothing about these resolutions He
could not say th it he had or had not «auctioned them, for he
could not recollect that they had pttracted his notice, but if
such resolutions had been to purchase books for distribution,
he never would have suffered them to pass without his onposi
tion
Mr WOODBURY observed that he had been shown that
ever since 1837 the contingent fund had been restricted to ap
propnations expressly for the oidmary expenses of Congress,
and ' no other " He referred to the first distribution of the
Documentary History ofthe Revolution by the House of Repre
sentatives, which was only for one volume, and m 1810 the
proposition to purchase the second and third volumes ofthe
Documentary History was negatived
Mr EVANS obsen ed that it was on a report of the joint com-
mittee that $20,000 was allowed in full payment for the second
and third volumes It was an attempt to putan end to an ox
istin* contract, bu t it could not pu t an end to it
Mr WOODBURY asked why should the Clerk of the House
when only authorized to distribute one volume, purchase three
volumes and distribute them?                            ' puiuuse tnree
Mr EVANS said, if the Clerk transcended his duty, he was
very wrong, but the books had been received and distributed
and all he knew was, that Congress had got to pay for them'
whether the Clerk had trinacended his duty or not                    '
Mr ARCHER said a few words m favor of the proposition
to strike out the books and their amount from this section ofthe
hill and ad 1 a new one as a separate appropriation for the
book , specifically stated
1 he question was then taken by yeas and nays, on the propo
sttion to strike out the word 'books," and resulted—yeas 16

Mr ARCHER moved to amend the 7th clause by addme

Mr TAPPAN observed that the act of the House was directly
in conflict wity that clause of the Constitution which, declares
