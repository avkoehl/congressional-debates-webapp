HEADQUARTERS TENTH ARMY CORPS, October 1, 1864-5.45 p. m.

Lieutenant Colonel E. W. SMITH,Assistant Adjutant-General:

The enemy tried to turn my right flank of skirmish line, which was repulsed handsomely. Enemy opened on the Darby column with two heavy batteries and one field piece, but little musketry. No firing heard from Charles City road. The main line of works is in plain sight and the column is directed toward them. We have only used one section (3-inch). I still hold up to their works at Varina junction. Heavy skirmishing.

The few prisoners taken in our charge on the pickets on the New Market road are all of the militia, quartermaster, naval, &amp;c. General Terry's advance is at the Powell house on the Central road. A column reported to be a large one is in sight. I will be all prepared on my left near the work.

Brigadier-General FOSTER,Commanding Second Division:

GENERAL: You will select one good regiment and send it as a line of skirmishers to drive in the enemy's pickets on the New Market road. They will make a demonstration, firing on them, and cheering to give the enemy an idea of an attack. This should be done to relieve Generals Terry and Kautz advancing up the Central road. Please report the progress of reconnaissance. You can take a regiment of Plaisted's if you prefer.

Yours, respectfully,

D. B. BIRNEY,

Major-General.
