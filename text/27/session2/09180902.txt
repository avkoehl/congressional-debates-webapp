Hou«e. In the present instaure, the Señale had
agra v. to      report; but not so before

of order. He had no doubt but thdt the chief red-
son Tfhy the House reacted the first conference re-
pon, was on accstint of the usurpation oí th- com-
Kti'tee in interfering with m aters not consigned to
their charge.
The SPEAKER overruled the point of order
Mr. ADAMS made s"tne remarks m vmdica-
t on of the committee, and ob^-rved ihat ihe title1
ei "full and free contiene " was app i?d to ct < i-
mitlees of this sort, because of ihe extended potci^
v ah which they were invested. They v. e-e not
only to reconcile existing differences, but a! o to
propose substitutes and additions to measure^ n
issue between the two Houses.
After some further remarks between Messrs J
CAMPBELL and the SPEAKER, Mr C acqui-
esced in the decision of the Ctiair, with the tinier
s andmg that he c< uli have it in his power to call
Ira division of the question upon eacn separate

Mr. McKAY remarked that the report was not
amendable. It must be agreed to, o, rejected, with-
out division. Should the House reject any one
resolution of recommendation of the commit'ee, s:
would be tantamount to a rejection of the a hole
report.

Were any retrenchments to be effected? If he un-
derstood the character of the report, it proposed to
surrender more than ever to the ¡senate He ex-
pressed his surprise mat the Speaker should ap-
point upon committees of conference a majority of
members opposed to the Views of the majority m
the House.
The SPEAKER was understood to say he had
no other means of ascertaining the vu.*  of gen-
tlemen whom be might appoint, except from their
recorded votes/ and, in this instance, he claimed to
have appointed two out of the three «embers of
the committee who had voted w th the majority
upon the army bill.
Mr. CAVE JOHNSON continued, and com
mented upon the manner in which these confer-
ences were managed, so as to yield always to the
views of the Senate, and continue ex ravagant ap-
propriations. For one, he was not wilhrg to
vield to the recommendation of the committee on
this occasion.
Mr STANLY regretted the course of the gen-
tlerean from Tennessee, [Mr Johnson J and pio-
ceeded to show how the friends of reuenebment
