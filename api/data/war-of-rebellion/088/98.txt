GENERAL: No movements of the enemy to report. They are busily engaged in constructing works in the rear of their mock line along the edge of the woods. They seemed to be staking off a new work during the day 400 or 500 yards to our right of the Gregory Chimneys. They did not work upon the fort west of the Weldon railroad to-day. A train of fifteen wagons passed toward Petersburg this a. m.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
