DECEMBER 28, 1862.-Skirmishes near Suffolk and at Providence Church, Va.

Report of Brigadier General Orris S. Ferry, U. S. Army.

[DECEMBER 29, 1862.]

Colonel Gibbs, sent out by me at 3 o'clock p.m. yesterday toward Carrsville to occupy the enemy while Spinola's column was moving out, came in contact with the enemy's scouting parties a short distance beyond our pickets. He drove them back, capturing 9 of them, and bivouacked about 10 miles from here. The prisoners say that Pryor was at Carrsville with two brigades of infantry, two regiments of cavalry, and nine pieces of artillery. Colonel Gibbs returned at daylight this morning. I send the prisoners to the Fortress to-day.

On the Windsor road an attack was made on our vedettes at Providence Church at 4 o'clock p.m. yesterday. The vedettes were driven in, but the reserves attacked and repulsed the enemy, driving them back several miles to a main body of about 300 cavalry.
