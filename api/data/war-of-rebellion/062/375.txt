HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF CENTRAL MISSOURI, Warrensbourg, Mo., February 19, 1864.

R. H. FARLEY, Esq.,Lexington Mo.:

SIR: Your letter, with one from Brigadier-General Vaughan, inclosing a communication from Captain Louis F. Green, Eleventh Cavalry, Kansas Volunteers, has been received. I presume this company has been moved to Kansas, and that you will not be troubled with this fellow, but I would suggest that you be around, and, with your neighbors, make the country too warm for men who, under the plea [of] releasing the negro, are committing robbery. The letter, with yours, will be forwarded to the Secretary of War.

I am, very truly, your obedient servant,

E. B. BROWN,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers, Commanding.
HDQRS. FOURTH SUB-DIST., CENTRAL MISSOURI, February 19, 1864.

Captain J. H. STEGER,Assistant Adjutant-General:

SIR: I would respectfully request Brigadier General E. B. Brown, commanding District of Central Missouri, that he would allow me to employ two detectives on secret service on this border. There are so many inducements for thieving and running off of property over the border into Kansas, which, if properly watched in a small way, will do a great deal toward breaking up this lucrative branch of plundering. In connection with this request, I would also ask that the recompense allowed to such be stated, if the request be granted to employ them.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JAS. H. FORD,

Colonel 2nd Colo. Cav., Commanding 4th Sub-Dist., Dist. Cent. Mo.

Respectfully returned to Colonel Ford, who is authorized to employ two detectives, the compensation not to exceed $60 per month and expenses.

By order of Brigadier-General Brown:

JAS. H. STEGER,Assistant Adjutant-General.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

I am highly pleased with the compliment you paid my chief of staff, Colonel N. P. Chipman, by ordering him to return to do service at your headquarters at the end of thirty days, but with great reluctance I must beg you to direct his services to continue with me for
