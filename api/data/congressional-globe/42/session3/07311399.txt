THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

Mr. KERR. And you are one of that kind.
'[Laughter.]
Mr. BUTLER, of Massachusetts. That
may be ; but that I am not alone here is most
•evident.
Now, I meant to say directly and exactly
that these insurance companies have received
$6,000,000 where they have not paid out more
than $5,000,000; yet there are men on this
floor who seem to desire to give these com-
panies $5,000,000 more out of the funds in our
Treasury, or out of the money belonging to
honest claimants. The proposition seems to
me so monstrous as hardly to be supported by
any honest man, unless his judgment has been
led away by sophistical arguments of one side
only.
Let me call the attention of my friend from
Ohio [Mr. Shellabarger] to the fact that he
■will find the case he read here—and I know he is
with me—to be the case I cited yesterday, where
the assured had got $8,000 out of a treaty
stipulation which provided for the claims of
private citizens. That is the difference be-
tween the two treaties: one provides for public,
the other for individual wrongs. That is what
I meant when I said I would answer the gen-
tleman from Kentucky, [Mr. Beck.] The
court were dealing with a claim that arose out
of the Spanish treaty, which provided for
individual claims. I cited still another case,
where a like claim arising out of the French
treaty came before the court. Both those
treaties provided the United States should
assume and pay the claim of their own citi-
zens. Thus the citizen acquired a right to
which the insurance company was subrogated.
Where the assured recovers the loss, then the
insurance company ought to recover it from
him if he has been paid by them.
When we provide, which we never will do,
that the assured who has received his loss from
the insurance company shall have it over again
out of this award, then I am willing the insur-
ance company should recover it back from him.
Such was the case of Comegysei al, vs. Vasse,
(1 Peters 193,) from which the gentleman from
Ohio [Mr. Shellabarger] read. The assured
had received his claim out of the Government,
and the court said, and said rightly, that having
got the claim out of the Government, that the
insurer, who paid him in full, ought to have it
out of him. So say I; and so would we say,
all of us.
That is as far as that case goes. But I do not
mean, and this bill does not mean, to put one
dollar of this award into the hands of the
assured, who has got his insurance in full of
his loss. When we do so inequitable a thing,
then let the insurance company do a like thing,
get it from him.
We provide, therefore, first, the wholly un-
insured men shall be paid; then those insured
in part shall be paid for loss beyond the insur-
ance; and then the rest shall be distributed
where it ought to go, to wit, to the men who
lost their war premiums, because war premiums
do not come back to them in any shape; for it'
they get their insurance they lose the premium,
and if they do not they lose it as well. To
prove this I desire now to send up and have
made a part of my remarks a table carefully
prepared by one of the first merchants in New
York, at the request of a friend of mine, which
shows, and you will examine it, we had to com-
pete in our cargoes with British ships which
paid no war premiums, and we got no higher
prices for our goods than they did, who paid
no war premiums. Prices were not raised by
war premiums; they were raised by the fact
that gold was going down, or rather currency
was going up, every moment; and you will
find hogsheads of sugar sold in 1863 at ten and
a half cents currency when gold was at 150.
If, however, there ever was any considerable
difference between the worlh of merchandise
here, not munitions of war, and merchan-
dise abroad, there were lines upon lines of
English steamers running under the British
flag, with' perfect safety, between Liverpool
and other parts of England and this country, to
bring us goods here without war premiums,
and equalize that price. So the payment of
war premiums was in fact a dead loss to every
merchant, and this bill comes here by unan-
imous vote of the Judiciary Committee, save
one, and they ask that these deserving mer-
chants should have that loss repaid if there is
money enough left, after paying those men
who were not insured at all, and therefore
deserve consideration more than those who
made partial losses only.

fect it.

change the general scope of my amendment
but merely correct the praseology.

remove my objection, 1 suppose ?
Mr. POLAND. Not at all.
