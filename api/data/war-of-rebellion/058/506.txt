His Excellency the PRESIDENT,

Richmond:

The brigade of General Gregg, who was severely wounded at Chickamauga, was broken up in a reorganization of the army by General Bragg. He has returned to duty; there is no command for him. Do you prefer General Bragg's organization, or reforming General Gregg's brigade?

Colonel GORGAS,

Ordnance Office, Richmond, Va.:

COLONEL: Your dispatch received to-day. Since my dispatch to the Secretary of War, Colonel Wright has notified me that he had for my command 1,500 small-arms, which will supply the immediate demand. I am somewhat at a loss to estimate the additional number.
