HDQRS. FIRST CORPS, DEPT., OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA,Near Parker's Store, May 6, 1864.

General R. E. LEE:

GENERAL: We succeeded in getting General Longstreet this far in tolerable comfort. Doctors Cullen, Barksdale, Wood, and Guild have made a partial examination of the wound, which they pronounce not necesarily fatal. I assure you, general, nothing could be announced to General Longstreet's staff that could give them more pleasure, and we hope that in a short time he will be on duty again. It will afford our dear geenarl great pleasure to know that what he inaugurated has been successful-that is the entire repulse of the hated enemy.

Most respectfully, your obedient servant,

ANDREW DUNN,

Aide-de-Camp.

General R. E. LEE:

GEENRAL: I am moving Rosser to the front again, and hope to get the same position we had this morning, in sight of Brock road. General Fitz. Lee is engaged with enemyh below. Rosser's force is very much reduced by hard fighting yesterday and to-day. The railroad cut was between me and Brock road, and crosses the latter to the east of my position of to-day.

Most respectfully,

Major-General.
