member of a re presen taüve Democracy and, as such, he should
discard a!i false notiors of economy The Ser-ate was the re

Mr EVPRETT sml he should go against thenm-mdment
Jaoptfid by the committer, (mseitinc the ratio of 60 500 ) and
would vote for any cumber in committee by which that ratio
could be stricken out If his own State were the only State that
would suffer, he did not know that he should have complained
of this ratio, because they could fix no latio, without fractions
were represented, but would Ltd* ' a d on some of the States
He read from a calculation showing tl p inequalities of the
fractions by this latí i He appealed to the la-ge S ates to ac
quire at least some ci edit for ma nammity when they could not
heipit,forhe told them at once that they could not cany the
ratio named The.* miglnm this lion e, but there were twenty
one States represented elsewheie which would not mar tain it

of a large anda small House lip had been in the habit of be
lievmg that the best part of the business they transacted was de
bating It was from debates heie, and here alone, that the peo
pie wereinformed of their afhurs
Mr E yielded, for purposes of mtenogatory, to Messrs WÍSE
and SHIELDS.
Mr BIDL4CK wished to say a word oi two, more by way of
explanation to many gentlemen who ha 1 solicited him to vote
to strike out the ratio now m the bill, than for the purpose of
influencing the votes of others It had been said that the ratio
ofb0,500 had been inserted in the bill m consequence of a cay
cus among the membeisfrom the laige ¡states It was due to
iiimself to sute that he knew of no caucus, and did not believe
one was held 1 he ratio of 60,5JO was rot n s favorite mini
ber,and he would go for any numbe that vould no* mriease
ihesiz^of tht House A'lei having given the sublet a tho
rough examination m the committee of which he was a mem
bef and a ter listening attentively t> all the arguments that
had been made hete, he btill remained conscientious1 y opposed
to incteasmg the number of the Kepresentatu es He went foi
the number pioposel by the committee, not because it was
more favorable to his own Snte, hut because he believed it
weuld bo more j ust towai do all the States than any othei He
would not go mm an argument to show the íeasons which hal
influenced his nurcl to the cone usum at which he had arrived,
but woüd content himself with repeating the remaik of a
trench writer—that when a legislative body was mciea&ed be
yond a certain number it deger erated into a rrob
Mr FILLMORE i ose to saya word m rt.pl y to a remark
thrown out by the gentleman trun Indiana [Mi Wh te ] that
the present ratio -vas ihe íesult of a caucus among the large
States It there had b^en any such, caucus it was without h ¡ 
knowledge, and, what was moie he had never heard of it
{Several voices, " Not I—not I "] He had voted on all tho
numbers, and invariably for the highest, and regietted that the
House had n t consen ed to fix on the latio of 100 000, which
would have reduced tl is House to a convenient body foi the
transaction of bus ness
Mr CARUTHERS said he still enteita led tl e opinion that
this subject was to be d'spo ed of by votes and mam strength,
and not by argument Oi> a \ lew oí the whole matter, he had
come to the conclusion that, in accor lance with the true pi m
ciplesofotu Government, they ought to enlaise this Hou:=e
He replied to the arguments against this, contending that a
large House—a House of 500 members—couH as easily be
governed by good rule's, and tl e entug tir er oi cement ol those
rule, as a House of half tint numba , that, in a u odeiatdy
laise House, tl pre would bo no moie debating as the dim ulsy
ofgettins the floor would be mcieased, that thev woull be
less subject to Executive influence, that there would be im re

Mr WHITE of Indiana,said that the gentlen m frem New
York [Mr TiLi/MOiír] seemed to have t iken exception to a íe
mark made by him (Mr W) that the ratio of bO 500 was
the result oi a caucus among the members of the Urge ¡Mates
Hehad ¿^prted that an 1 wa"! not prepared o retract it Tí eic
was probably adiffeierceof understand]) g, uetwten the gentle
man and himself of the term cducus In New Yoik the idea
was of x seeret meeting of a certain time, of a dark room and

ingas to measures to be adopted He had seen the memb i^ircm
the large ^tatps con/ersmg togethei on he subject and to a I
intents and purposes this id 10 was the íesjlt o a caucus held
mthis House
Mr COOPER, of Peinsylvama sa d he had prnpo^pd the
ra 10 of 60 300, which had beenaaopte 3 and he hal dore it with
out any undei tand ng with snyger  email fi in Nev? Yorl
Ohio, orPeu isylvdnia lie did it he conferid becau e it sui
el his own *tate but he did not intend that it s lould bear haid

fromlndiana [Mr V^hite] what it wa^ m this ratio tlut inuv
edhim—if it di Inot b<Mi harl on Indiana"?
Mr WHITE s«.id it wa& a irost favorable numbm for Indi
ana, and It1 did not iherelore oppf ce it on that ground
Mr COOPER continued Tier has ilvn\e been too
much difficulty about fraction  lit- wentfu fíxií g a piopei

and he was disponed toadheie to it asalli umbeis eft h*t nr 
and especially as they Kd b en threatei p 1 tl it the Ser a e
would not agree to it, a d he hoped uiecxrim wewouldi of dv,

Mr R D DAVIS, of New Yoik rose to *iv, that if «uch a
caucus had been held he had no knowledge of it With re-
spect to the ratio, of which he approved, it would he borne
in mind that it was the smallest number proposed But he was
of opinion that the true question was lost sight of in bis debate
The question should be, what shall be the size of this House,
an! whethei u shall be a laigeorasmall body and all this
nrotracted controversy as to how the fiactions would fall on this
or that Sate, appeared to him ti he a very ummpouant matter
It should be borne in m r\^ that wlntever m'ghtbe the result of
those fractiors they were not stationary The progipssof a
single year mightchangt- them, and he could see but onepnn

nearest appioach to perfect equality that was practicable On
the present plan, suppose, for example, the legal ratio to be
70,630, MdttH would get a Representative for- every 71,000,
(nmittincr frac ions,) Massachusetts for every 73 000, and Rhode
Island 103 000, Alabama for every 81,558—thus leaving in that
S ate 10 878 persons not represented at all Instead of suffering
such an inequality a^ thn, he would turn the principle the other
way, and as Alabama could not get one Representative fax
eveiy 70,630 he would give her a Representative for every
69 90b, this would come witrun 774 peisons of entire equality
He would carry the same principle ail thiough, and thus get at
a lepre^cntat on as nearly equal as possible
Mr E referred to a bilí m our early history which had been
negatived by Gei eral Washmgt n because it gave a represen-
tation to a State foi less that 30,000 contrary to the letter of the
Constitu ion, and al*,o because it proposed a representation not
effected by any common divisor so far as the latter reason was

Mr WISE opposed the amendment,because it represeited

tho whole peop'e as one, he should be foi it, but, as the Con-
stitution contf mplated a representation by federal numbers, he
must oppose it TheGovernmentwasfedeialin eveiy feature

The Sta es stood on the people—the General Government on

dated representation The district system was the only system

Mr CHARLES BROWN opposed the amendment as im-
practicable and e\piejsed his hope that the House would
stick to the mode which hal been usual for so long a time
Mr W COSÍ JOH^bON lepIiedtoMr Everett, m oppo-

self by tre onmion of General Washington—that Congress had
no right to sancti n the repiesentation of fiactions This was
