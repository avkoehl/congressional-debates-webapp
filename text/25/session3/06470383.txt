Public Defaulters—Mr. Prentiss.
Ho. of Reps.
not, it seems, yet offended his olfactories Besides
all this, his fi lends excuse him by saying that the
Government will, probably, not ultimately lose
anything by these defalcations; that the money
will be recovered back, either fiom the defaulters
or their sureties.
Sir, if a thief is detected, and compelled to dis-
gorge the subject of his larceny, does it íelieve
the rogue and hisjaccompliee fiom guilt' does it
extinguish the crime' Upon the answer to this
question depends the validity of the Secretary's
excuse.
It is also urged in his favor, that defalcations
have occuired under othei Administrations; that
the public money has been stolen before. This
plea I feel compelled to allow to its whole extent.
" Brave men lived before Agamemnon, "and great
rogues before Levi Woodbury In justice to the
Secretary, I cannot deny that his peti aie not the
first thieves on record; and 1 give him joy of the
able defense which Ins fuends have extiacted
from this remarkable circumstance.
And now, Mr. Chairman, what do you think of
this Secretary of the Treasury' of his epistolary
talent' of his capacity and fitness for the station
he occupies' He resembles much, both in man-
ner and morality, that worthy old lady who lived
at "The Mug," in Bulwer's "Paul Clifford,"
and rejoiced in the name of " Mrs Margei y Lob-
kins," more familiarly called " Peggy Lob "
His correspondence with his subalterns cannot
fail of calling to your recollection the exquisite
admonitions of honest "Peggy" to " Leetle
Paul "
Thus moralized, not Levi, but the kind-heaited
dame:
"Mind thv kittychism, child, and reverence old a<re
Never steal, '«peeially when anyone be in the wry B
modest, Paul, and stick to your -uivuicm in lid Ri id

without it,take it away by insinuation, not lilu ter Tin y

m the other end of this building, as Senator from
my own State, a State upon whose laws and in-
stitutions his talents and genius are indelibly im-
pressed. The political history of Mississippi is
illusliated by his name from its very commence-
ment He served her in all her departments; and
as legislator, judge, and Governor, advanced her
¿ruospeuty and atlded to her character What he
w^vas as Senator you all know. He stood proudly
among the pioud, and lofty among the loftiest,
at a time when the Senate Chamber contained the
garnered talent of the country; when its intel-
lectual giants shook the whole nation with their
mighty strife, when, sir, it inclosed within its
wallsthemosttranscendent deliberative body that
ever was assembled upon this earth. The floor
of that body was his proper arena. To a cor-
rectness of judgment, which would have given
him reputation even without the capacity of ex-
pression, he joined a power of debate which for
parliamentary stienglh and effect was unsur-
passed To all this was added a stern, unyield-
ing attachment to his political principles, and an
indomitable boldness m expressing and sustain-
ing them.
Do you not recollect, sir, when General Jack-
son, like Challes I , stiode to the legislative
chamber, and tlnust among the Senatois a des
potic edict, moie insulting (han if he had cast at
their feet a nak<- d swoid ' It was that fieice mes-
sage which commenced with breaking down the
independence and chaiactei of the Senate, and
finally icsulted in that woise than felon act, the
deseoiation of its recoids But the mandate

When it buist, like a wild beast fiom his lair,
upon the astonished body whose degiadation it
conitmpliled,and in the end accomplibhed, most
of the distinguished S< natois were absent, but
he of whom I speik was at his post Single-
handed ami alone, like Codes at the head of the
bridee, he held at bay the Executive squadion
Yes,
,, and lot a whole day diove  hick the Mamelukes

studied this maxim, and cunningly did he prac-
tice upon it when he recommended that defalca
tion should be made a penitentiary offense Peg-
gy Lob placed in " leetle" Paul's hand the sum
of five halfpence and one faithmg "Theie,
boy,"quoth she, and she stroked his head fondly
when she spoke, (just as Levi caresses his sub-
ordinates.) " you does right not to play foi noth-
ing—its loss of time1    But play with those as

doctrine of those in power, and " to go for to I

of tenor, when he had to legislate, as he told us
the other day, with " harness on,"when the best
aigument was the pistol, and the only law was
club law It was the time when " Hurrah for
Jackson1" constituted the "open sesame" of
power, which gained at once admittance into the
robber's cave and participation in the plunder
Then Geneial Jackson had  but  to whistle,
and
"Instant from copse and heath arose
Bonnets, and spears, and bonded bows "
His followers, like those of Roderick Dhu,
started up in eveiy diiection, ready and eager to
peifoim his bidding He had but to point his
finger, and his fierce blood-hounds buried their
muzzles in the unfortunate victim of his wiath.
Then were the saturnalia of the office holdeis;
and, like the locusts of Egypt, they plagued the
land. Pew dared to whisper of corruptions or
defalcations, and a bold man was he who pro-
posed to investigate them, for it wassuie to bring
down upon his head the rage which neverrelent-
ed, and the angei whicli nothing but funous per-
secution could assuage                                               I
There was one man, however, who blanched
not before General Jackson's fiown, and who
dared to propose an investigation into fiauds and
corruptions which had become so paipable and
gross as to be an offense m the nostrils of the
community.   He occupied, at that time, a seat i
flush the foiehead to the very temples
1 need not tell you that man's name wasGeoige
Pomdextei, a name that will long and honoiably
live among the lovers of independence and haters
of tyranny But he dared to propose an investí
gation into the fiauds and conuptions of the Gov-
ernment, and fiom that moment his doom was
sealed The dec p, turbid, and resistless cui ient of
Jacksomsm swept him from the State in whose
service the best of his life had been expended,
and, ostracised from hei councils, he became an
exile in othei lands
Sir, the office-holders m this countiy form an
oligaichy too poweiful to be resisted Why was
notSpmcer rtmoved' why was not Hams 'why
noiLinn and Boyd' I will tell you The Admin
istiati m did not dare to remove them, even had
it wished to do so; like pachas, they had become
too poweiful for the Sultan, and would not have
hesitated in twisting the bowstring round the neck
of the messengei who presented it
Since the avowal of that unprincipled and bar-
barian motto, that "to the victors belong the
spoils," office, which was intended for the use
and benefit of the people, has become but the
plunder of party Pationage is waved like a huge
magnet ovei the land, and demagogues like iron
filings, attiacted bv a law of their nature, gather
and clustei atound its poles Nevei yet lived the
demagogue who would not take office            ^
The whole frame of our Government, the wnole
institutions of the country, are thus piostitu'ed to
the uses of party I express my candid opinion,
when I aver that I do not believe a single office of
importance within the control of the Executive
has for the last five years been filled with any
other view, or upon any other consideration, than
that of party effect; and if good appointments have
in any instances been made, and benefit accrued
to the country, it has been an accidental, and not
a voluntary result. Office is conferred as the
reward of partisan service; and what is the con-
sequence ' Why, the office holders are not con-
tent with the pitiful salaries which afford only
small compensation for present labors,butdo not in
their estimation constitute any adequate reward
for their previous political services. Thisrewaid,
they persuade themselves, it is perfectly right to
fetain from whatever passes through their hands.
Being taught that all moneys in their possession
belong not to the people, but to the party.it re-
quires but small exertion of casuistry to bring them
to the conclusion that they have a right to retain
what they may conceive to be the value oí their
political services-, just as a lawyer holds back his
commissions. The Administration countenances
all this, winks at it as long as possible, and when
public exposure is inevitable, generally gives the
bloated plundeier full warning and time to escape
with his spoils.
Do you not see the eagerness with which even
Governors, Senatois,and Representatives m Con-
gress, grasp at the most trivial appointments, the
most insignificant emoluments' Well do these
sons of the horse-leech know that there is more
blood in the body than what mantles in the cheek,
and more profit in an office than is exhibited by
the salary.
Sir, I have given you but three or four cases of
defalcations; would time permit, I could give you
a hundred. Like the fair Sultana of the ouental
legends, I could go on for a thousand and one
nights, and even as in those eastern stories, so
in the chiomeles of the office holders, the tale
would evei be of heaps of gold, massive ingots,
uncounted riches Why, sir, Aladdin's lamp was
nothing to it They seem to possess the identi-
cal cap of Foitunatus. Some wish for $50,000,
some for $100,000, some for $1,000,000; and be-
hold it lies in glittering heaps before them. Not
even
" The gorgeous Erst, with richest hand,
Show* i^ on her kings barbaric pearl and gold"
in such lavish abundance as does this Admmis 
tiation unon its followers Pizarro held not forth
more dazzling lures to his robbei-band when ha
led them to the conquest of the Children of the
Sun.
And now, Mr. Chairman, have I not redeemed
mv promise' Have I not shown that the Piesi-
dent is but a hypocnte in his pietended horror at
defalcation, that the Secretaiy is much worse—a
conniver, a weak, imbecile pm tice-ps citminis11 Let
his defendéis reconcile his conduct m the case oí
Harris with his official duty, with the dictates or
common honesty,if they can, I dare them to the
trial Let them reconcile his licentious corre-
spondence with Spencer, Hendricks, and more
especially Garesché, with the principles of com-
mon decency.
Mr Chairman, it is not my intention to exam-
ine minutely the case of Swai twout. I know not
why the President should have selected it out of
so many as the subject of special communication.
There is, however, one curious matter connected
with this subject, which I shallnoticc ThePres-
ldent, the Secretary, and the party, all piofess to
unite in the belief that the defalcations of Swart-
wout, Price, and cithers, affoid the best possible
aigument in favor of the sub-Tieasuiy scheme.
Most of these defalcations, say they, occuued
under the deposit system, and, theiefore, to that
system these losses are attiibutable. Now, sir,
if you will look over this Document 297, you will
find that, out of the two hundred and sixty-five
letters to receiveis and collectors, nearly two hun-
dred contain complaints that the public money
had not been deposited in bank, but retained in
the hands of the officer If you will look into the
cases of Harris and Boyd, you will see that their
defalcations could not have taken place had the
Secretary not indulged them in a continued and
habitual violation of this duty of periodical de-
posits But the proposition itself is giossly ab-
suid It amounts to this, that the running away
of sub-Tieasuiers with large amounts of the pub-
lic money is proof of the safety of the sub-Trcas-
uiy system, in other words, stealing is oroof of
