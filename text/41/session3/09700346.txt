which she will have accommodation, and also
a good life-preserver or float for each deck or
other class passenger which the inspector's
certificate shall allow her to carry, including
the'officers and crew, which life-preservers or
floats shall be kept in convenient and accessi-
ble-places on such vessel in readiness for imme-
diate use in case of accident; and every such
vessel of two hnndred tons or less shall also
keep at least eighteen fire buckets and two
barrels, and shall have not less than four axes;
and every such steamer of over two hundred
tons, and not less than five hundred tons' bur-
den, shall carry not less than twenty-four
buckets, four water barrels, and six axes; and
every such steamer of over five hundred tons
shall carry not less than thirty-five buckets, six
water barrels, and eight axes. The buckets
and barrels shall be kept in convenient places
and filled with water, to be in readiness in case
of fire, and the axes shall bo kept in good order
and ready for immediate use: Provided, how-
ever, That tanks of suitable dimensions and
arrangement, or buckets in sufficient number,
may be substituted for barrels.
Sec. 9. Andbeil further enacted, That every
such vessel carrying passengers on the main
deck shall be provided with permanent stair-
ways and other sufficient means, convenient to
such passengers, for their escape to the upper
deck, in case of the vessel sinking or other
accident endangering life; and in the stowage
of freight upon such deck, where passengers
are carried, gangways or passages, sufficiently
largo to allow persons to pass freely through
them, shall be left open both fore and aft of
the vessel, and also to and along the guards
On each side; and it shall be the duty of the
captain or mate of such vessel to assign to all
deck passengers when taking passage the space
on deck they may occupy during the voyage,
and such space shall not thereafter be occupied
by freight,_ nor overcrowded by other persons,
nor shall freight be stowed about tho boilers
or machinery in such a manner as to obstruct
or prevent the engineer from readily attending
to his duties ; and for every violation of this
section relating to the carriage and accommo-
dation of passengers, the owners of the vessel
shall pay a fine of three hundred dollars.
Sec. 10. And be it further enacted, That
every steamer carrying passengers shall be pro-
vided with wire tiller-ropes, or iron rods or
chains, for the purpose of steering and navi-
gating the vessel, ajid shall employ wire bell-
pulls for signalizing the engineer from the pilot-
house, together with tubes of proper size so
arranged as to return tho sound of the engine
bells to the pilot-house, or other arrangement
to repeat back the signal: Provided, That on
any such vessel, navigated by the mariners'
compass, so much of such wire rope or chain
may be dispensed with and disused as shall
influence or disturb the working of such com-
pass.
Sec. 11. And be it further enacted, That
upon the passage of this act the offices of all
local inspeetorswho have notthequalifications
prescribed in this act shall be deemed vacated,
and that when any vacancy shall occur in any
local board of inspectors now existing, or when-
ever local inspectors are to be appointed for a
new district, the supervising inspector shall
notify the collector or other chief officers of
the customs for the district and the judge
of the district court of the United States for
the district in which such appointment is to
be made, who, together with the supervising
inspector, shall meet together as a board of
designators; and it shall be the duty of such
board, or the major part thereof, one of which
majority shall be the supervising inspector,
when designating an inspector of hulls, to select
a person of good character and suitable qual-
ifications and attainments, to perform the ser-
vices required of him by this act, who, from
his practical knowledge of ship-building and
navigation and the uses of steam in navigation,
shall be fully competent to make a reliable
estimate of the strength, seaworthiness, and
other qualities of the hulls of steamers and
their equipment deemed essential to saf [e]ty
of life in the navigation of such vessel, to be
called the inspector of hulls; and when desig-
nating an inspector of boilers, to select a per-
son of good character and suitable qualifica-
tions and attainments to perform the services
required of him by this act, who, from his
knowledge and experience of the duties of an
engineer employed in navigating vessels by
steam, and also in the construction and use of
boilers, and machinery, and appurtenances
therewith connected, shall be able to form a
reliable opinion of the strength, form, work-
manship, and suitableness of such boilers and
machinery to be employed without hazard to
life, from imperfection in the material, work-
manship, or arrangement of any part of such
apparatus for steaming, to be called the in-
spector of boilers; and these two persons,
when approved by the Secretary of the Treas-
ury, shall, from the date of designation, con-
stitute a board of local inspectors, and shall
be empowered and required to perform the
duties herein specified, to wit:
First. Upon application in writing of the
master or owner they shall, once in every year
at least, carefully inspect the hull of each
steamer within their respective districts, and
shall satisfy themselves that every such vessel
so submitted to their inspection is of a struc-
ture suitable for the service in which she is to
be employed, has suitable accommodations for
passengers and the crew, and is in a condition
to warrant the belief that she may be used in
navigation as a steamer, with safety to life,
and that all the requirements of law in regard
to fires, boats, pumps, hose, life-preservers,
floats, anchors, cables, and pther things, are
faithfully complied with; and if they deem it
expedient, they may direct the vessel to be
put in motion, and may adopt any other suit-
able means to test her sufficiency and that of
her equipment.
Second. They shall also inspect the boilers
of all steamers before the same shall be used,
and once at least in every year thereafter, sub-
jecting them to the hydrostatic pressure pre-
scribed by this act, and satisfy themselves by
thorough examination that the boilers are well
made, of good and suitable material; that the
openings for the passage of water and steam,
respectively, and all pipes and tubes exposed
to heat, are of proper dimensions and free
from obstruction; that the spaces between and
around the flues are sufficient, and that the
flues are circular in form, and the fire-line of
the furnace is at least two inches below the
prescribed minimum water-line of the boilers;
and that tho arrangement for delivering the
feed-water is such that the boilers cannot be
injured thereby; and that such boilers and the
machinery, and the appurtenances, may be
safely employed in the service proposed in the
written application without peril to life; and
shall also satisfy themselves that the safety-
valves are of suitable dimensions, sufficient in
number, and well arranged, (one of which may,
if necessary, in the opinion of the inspectors, to
secure safety, be taken wholly froni the con-
trol of all persons engaged in navigating such
vessel, and secured by the inspectors,) and
that the weights of the safety-valves are prop-
erly adjusted, so as to allow no greater press-
ure in the boilers than the amount prescribed
by the inspection certificate; that there is a
sufficient number of gauge-cocks properly in-
serted, and to indicate the pressure of steam,
suitable steam registers that will correctly
record each excess of steam carried above the
prescribed limit and the highest point attained,
which shall be taken wholly from the contro}
of all persons engaged in navigating such ves-
sel, and secured by the inspectors, and relia-
ble low-water gauges; and that fusible metals
are properly inserted so as to fuse by the heat
of the furnace when the water in the boilers
shall fall below its prescribed limits; and that
adequate and certain provisions is made for
an ample supply of water to feed the boilers at
all times, whether such vessel is in motion or
not, so that in high-pressure boilers the water
shall not be less than four inches above the
top of the flues; and also that means for
blowing out are provided, so as to thoroughly
remove the mud and sediment from all parts
of the boilers when they are under pressure
of steam: Provided, however, That no kind of
instrument, machine, or equipment, for the
better security of life, provided for by this act,
shall be used on any such vessel which shall
not first be approved by the board of super-
vising inspectors, and also by the Secretary of
the Treasury.
Third. That in subjecting to the hydrostatic
tests boilers called and usually known under
the designation of high-pressure boilers, the
inspector shall assume one hundred and ten
pounds to the square inch as the maximum
pressure allowable as a working power for a
new boiler forty-two inches in diameter, made
in the best manner, of inspected iron plates,
one fou[r]th of an inch thick, and of a quality
required by law, and shall rate the working
power of all high-pressure boilers, whether oid
or new, according to their strength, compared
with this standard, and in all cases the test
applied shall exceed the working power allowed
in the ratio of one hundred and sixty-five to
one hundred and ten; and in subjecting to the
test aforesaid that class of boilers usually desig-
nated and known as low-pressure boilers, the
said inspectors shall allow as a working power
of each new boiler a pressure of only three
fourths the number of pounds to the square
inch to which it shall have been subjected by
the hydrostatic test, and found to be sufficient
therefor; but should such inspectors be of the -
opinion that said boiler, by reason of its con-
struction or material, will not safely allow so
high a working pressure, they may, for reasons
to be stated specially in their certificate, fix
the working pressure of said boiler at less than
three fourths of said test pressure; but all
boilers used on steam-vessels, and constructed
of iron or steel plates, inspected under the
provisions of section thirty-six of this act,
shall be subjected to a hydrostatic test, in the
ratio of one hundred and fifty pounds to the
square inch to ono hundred pounds to the
square inch of the working steam-power al-
lowed; and no boiler or pipe, or any of the
connections therewith, shallbe approved which
is made, in whole or in part, of bad material,
or is unsafe in its form, or dangerous from
defective workmanship, age, use, or other
cause.
Fourth. When the inspection is completed,
and the inspectors approve the vessel and her
equipment throughout, they shall make and
subscribe a certificate to the collector or other
chief officer of the customs of the district in
which such inspections shall be made, in ac-
cordance with such form and regulations as
the board of supervising inspectors shall pre-
scribe; which certificate shall be verified by
the oaths of the inspectors signing it, before
the chief officer of the customs of the district,
or any other person competent by law to admin-
ister oaths; and in case the said inspectors
refuse to grant a certificate of approval, they
shall state in writing, and sign the same, their
reason for their disapproval.
Sec. 12. And be it further enacted, That
upon the application of any master or owner
of any steamer employed in tho carriage of
passengers, for a license to carry gunpowder,
the said inspectors shall examine guch vessel)
