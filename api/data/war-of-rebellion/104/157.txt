HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND, Nashville, March 31, 1865.

Brigadier General R. W. JOHNSON,Pulaski, Tenn.:

Your report on the complaints of General Roddey and Major Gilbert has been received and your action is approved. Your command will be remounted as fast as the horses can be procured, but I want you in the meantime to concentrate and keep all the regiments at Pulaski. Keep one regiment constantly in the vicinity of the Memphis and Charleston Railroad, to patrol the country and hunt up guerrillas. Now that Wilson has gone, you will have to watch the Tennessee River closely. Hatch is still at Eastport, his division dismounted, but he will be able to watch his immediate vicinity. You can watch particularly Florence and Bainbridge, and Lamb's Ferry, arrest all persons engaged in smuggling, and you will have to watch persons holding permits to purchase cotton.
