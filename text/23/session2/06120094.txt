PUBLIC IMPROVEMENTS
The following resolution, submitted on Satur
day by Mi   Chilton, was taken up
Resolved, That the Committee on Roads and
Canals be instructed to inqune into the subject,
and report their opinion to this House, of the
most equal and just mode of applying the icv-
enues of the country to such woiks of public
improvement within the íespective States of this
Union as miy be necessary foi the facilitating of
commerce with foreign nations and among the
several States And that they moieovei íeport
their opinion of the best and most piacticable
mode ot ascertaining and deteimining tilt nuion
ality and importance of such improvements as
may be proposed within the said several States
Mr CHILTON rose and said, that the piop
osition which he had submitted to the House
would be found, on examination, to consist of
two parts The first relates to the great punci
pies of justice, which may be observed in n aking
disbursements of public money fiom the Iicasui y
for works of impiovement, the second to the
character of the woik proposed in the sever il
States of the Union He sitd he should like to
confine his íemaiks to these two points The
first i elates to the principle of distubution, and
includes the inquiry—What distubution will be
just > This inquiry excludes any discussion with
regard to so much of the revenue of the eountiy
as íegards the necessaiy expense of the Govern-
ment He was peisuaded there would be found
no difference oí sentiment with rcgu&to somuih
as relates to the necessity expense of the Gov
eminent It is right that ev i y American citizen
should contribute so much, whither dnectly oi
indirectly, as arc necessity for curymg on the
opeiations of the Government 1 he difference
of opinion that exists, relates to the lemiindcr
of the money in the Treasury iftcr the expenses
of Government have been paid In ordei to de
termine with regard to the distubution, what
course will be proper and just, the answer in-
volves two questions—questions of fact in part,
and part of conventional agieement or constitu-
tional law Those of fact will be first How is
this fund created, and fiom whence derived ? and
secondly, to whom does this fund belong' In
answer to the fii&t question—it is derived from a
variety of sources, the principal of which ai e the
duties on foreign pioductions, and fiom the silo
of public lands He might revert to many more,
to the Post Office and Patent Office, &c , but the
aggregate would be found so inconsiderable that
he would not take up the time of the House to
enumerate them He would confine himself to
these two gieat and linpoitant souices of lev-
enuc, to the amount leceived from duties on the
foreign article, and fiom the sale of the pub
he domnn of this nation 1 he duties on foreign
articles are paid immediately by the importers,
mediately by the consuméis, and remotely by
the foreign manufacturers He did not consider
the cost of the article was increased to the con
sumer in proportion to the amount of duties
He would put a single case in illustration In
1828, when the tmlf bill was passed, the eastein
members adopted the opinion that the cost of
molasses would be reduced in pioportion to the
reduction of duty Bj the act then passed, the
duties were reduced When Congiess met next
winter, he called on them to know if they had
realized their fond hopes, and learned, to his
astonishment, thatthe price was increased instead
of being diminished     He inquired of them the
cause, but they could not tell, neither was he
able to find any one who could account for it to
then own or his satisfaction, till he happened in
company with an intelligent foreigner, who ie-
maiked that it was a matter very easily accounted
for, that foreigners had then  seciet agents em-
ployed'm all Ameucan maikets     They knew as
well as Amencans themselves the puce of the i
article and the e item of the demand, and when
the duties wcie u duced heíe five cents per gallon,
the price  was  increased five  cents  per gallon
abroad      Mr C said h" hau shown by this illus   I
tiation that the consumei was not lelieved by a 1
reduction of duties, but that the piofits of the
foieignei were mcieased     When you take into
considerition the small extpnt of the temtoiy of
Great Britain, it  is certain they cannot live by
agriculture, but must be engaged in manuftctuics ¡
and commerce, they aie compelled to sell the ai
tides they manufacture, whether they will com
mand much or little     He said that the duties the
citizen pays for the support of his own Govern
ment would, but for those duties, be pud into [
the pockets of foieigneis       Mr   C    pioceeded
with his remn ks  till arrested by 1 call for the
orders of the day

sentitives of Biiley L Chrk,
A bill for the relief of Henry Awkward   and
A bill to authouic the Secrttaiy of Stite to I
issue letteis patent to James Jones                           ¡
When the hour allotted for the consideration |
of moiuing business had elapsed,
Mi   CLAY lose and leminded the Chur and
the House that, sevtril weeks ago, the "bill to  |
reduce andgiaduate the puce of the pubhclands" Í
had been made the specul oidei  foi  this day
He inquiied of the Chdii whethei this bill would
not have precedence ovei other special older-?
The SPEAKER replied in the negative—
remaiking that vvnen the day aruved foi the
consideiation of anothei special older, since that
of the "Navy bill" had been pending, he had
given his opinion thit the unfinished special older
had precedence, and that the House had then
acquiesied The Speik r also mentioned me
several special oidtis which had piectdence over
the bill mentioned by Mi   C
Mi CLAY remaiked that the decision heip
tofoie pionounced by the Chan hid (perhaps
fiom inattention) escaped his notice, that he did
not wish to mteifeie with other special oiders, if
he cuuld avoid it, and would, theiefoie, for the
present, acquiesce in the coutse indicated as the
pioper one by the Chair
PAY OF THE f,AVy.
The Hou^e then pioceeded to the consideration
of the unfinished special ordei, being the bill to
regulate the pay of the Navy of the United St Uts
The amendment pending at the hour of id-
journment, when the bill was list undei discus-
sion, ofieied by Mi Joh\son, of Kentucky,
which i use« the salanes of pissed midshipmen
and midshipmen, was read and o_,rcec! to, afier
being assented to Dy the chin man of the select
committee, [Mr   Watmoooii ]
Mi GRLNNELL pioposcd to amend the
clause relating to cleiks of navy yaids, by íaising
their pav from $900 to $1,100 pei annum
Mi G said, he was not disposed to obstruct
the passage of the bill, towaids the geneial f i-
tures of which he felt fivoiably disposed, but
the more he had lcilectcd on this point, the moie
firmly he was convinced of the justice of the
amendment he had submitted The office belonged
to whit might be piopeily cilled the civil depait-
ment of the Navy—a class too apt to be over-
looked Mr G said, he should go lor the bill,
though it contained some objectionable featuie*—
so tie of the salaues, he believed, were placed at
rithei too high a late, but this impoitant office,
tint of clerk of nav y yn ds wis, in his view, dis-
piopoitionately too low The duties of that officer
weie oneious and responsible He not meiely
kept the iccounts of the yaid, but had charge of
the correspondence—not, as had been supposed,
baiely to file hat coirespondence, but was him-
self the to;ii«, and should possess talents and
receive a compensation couespondent to his
duties A chaplain leeeived $1,200 pel annum,
while a cleik'o duties were ceitamly much moie
severe He did not deny the importance of the
duties of the foimer officer, but it would be ad
mitted they weie only requited twice a week,
while the clerk must be in attendance eveiy day,
fiom sun use to sun set, and even Sunday did
not bring a Sabbath to him Mi G here enu-
meiated all the duties c^ clerks, and appealed to
gentlemen to admit that compensation was not in
piopoition to that given to othei officers He
said it ought to be remembered that the salaiy of
the cleik in the yard at Washington had always
been $1,000 pei annum, until the last yeai, when
it was leduced by the IN ivy Comimssioneis to
$7j0     He 1 oped the amendment would prevail
[Here Mi Lf WIS obtuned have to lay a
motion on the table to reconsidei the vote of
Satutday list on the bill foi the relief of Susan
Decatui, the consideration or which was post-
poned to Friday next ]
The question was then taken on the amend-
ment of Mi Grennlll, and it was rejected
without a division
The question now being on the engrossment
of the bill,
Mr ALLEN, of Vngima, rose and said he
should feel constrained from various considera
tions, to move tint this bill be committed to the
Committee on Naval Affairs foi icvisal The
increase in the pay of the officers by this bill was
moie than $200,000 The whole pay of Wavy
officeis w 11 thus cost the nation at least a million
of dollars No one could be moie alive than
himself to the glory which out naval officeis had
shed upon our name, but not even this considei-
ation should induce him to suppoi t this bill in its
present shape, contiaty to his own ideas of ught
Mi 4. said theie was another view which
should be taken of tins subiect The officeis
destined to receive the additional compensation
were not generally tho«e who so bnlliantly dis-
tinguished themselves in the last war Those
engaged in that memoiable contest, had most of
them passed to their final rewaid They belonged
to the old school of economy, and were content
with what their countiy awarded them, and the
glory of achieving her vrctoues Mi 4. heie
went into a comparison between the lelative pay
and duties of the officeis of the Army and the
Navy The disparity was not now so gieat as
had been represented to the disadvan ige of the
latter The bill did not equalise the p ly of the
two services A certain class of officers in the
Navy, were to be paid at a much higher rate
than those of a correspondirg lank in the Armv
The pay of a lieutenant in the Navy was not only
gi eater than that of a colonel of the Army, but
