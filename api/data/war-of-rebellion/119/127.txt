rebel army. The seven leaders are intelligent, educated men-three physicians and one teacher the others their blind followers. Two men, John Dunlane and Richard Wilson, said they would heartily take the oath of allegiance and had never aided the rebellion, but both were arrested as spies. Three men, Patrick Wallace, John McGrane, and Frank Barry, were British subjects, and are willing to swear not to aid the rebellion, and that they never have. The prison ship has been ordered by General Patrick to Washington to-morrow, and at 10 o'clock to deliver the prisoners to Captain Todd, and Iaawit your orders to execute at that hour, when the ship arrives at Sixth Street Wharf. I discharged no prisoners, as your orders could better be executed here to-morrow a. m. than at Alexandria at 8 p. m. this day. I have the names of all the prisoners.

Respectfully submitted.

L. C. TURNER,

Judge-Advocate.

Lieutenant Colonel WILLIAM H. LUDLOW, Agent of Exchange:

SIR: I return the inclosed unsigned communication,* not knowing whether it was written by you or intended to represent your views. I am sustained in that doubt, not only by the fact that the paper is without your signature, but by the extraordinary nature of some of the paragraphs. If it really does embody your views you can send it to me with your signature.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

RO. OULD,

Agent of Exchange.

CONFEDERATE STATES OF AMERICA, WAR DEPARTMENT,

Richmond, July 18, 1863.

Lieutenant Colonel WILLIAM H. LUDLOW, Agent of Exchange:

SIR: Some months ago I called your attention to the case of Captain Robert W. Baylor, who was captured last year in Virginia and who was held upon some charges. I have understood that after many delays a court was convened in his case, but that he was not allowed to choose his own counsel or introduce any witness in his behalf who would not take the Federal oath of allegiance.

Can you inform me what was the finding of the court in the case or whether there was any finding, and if there was no finding what is proposed to be done with Captain Baylor? His case is certainly a very hard one. He is entirely innocent of the charges preferred against him. He has been a prisoner for more than five months and has been very roughly treated. Even now he has no bed and not a seat to sit upon. How do these things happen?

I hope this communication will meet a different fate from most of the others wherein I have ventured to make specific inquiries or bring particular cases to your notice. I trust I shall at least receive some answer.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

RO. OULD,

Agent of Exchange.
