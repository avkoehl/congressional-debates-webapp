CHAMBERSBURG, PA., July 9, 1863-7 p. m.

Captain CAREY:

I visited Greencastle this a. m. Took the Williamsport pike to near Cunningham's Cross-Roads; then over to Muttontown, or Middleburg. While on the latter trip, we saw a number of wagons foraging; gave chase, and had a skirmish with some 80 infantry. We drove them, but were unable to get the wagons, as it was within 1 mile of their camp. We retraced our steps to Middleburg, and then here. While at Middleburg, I learned that Lee's headquarters were on the pike between Hagerstown and Williamsport, and a corps is camped on one side of the road this side of Hagerstown; another, near Hagerstown, and another on the Leitersburg road. One hundred men of the First New York Cavalry are here, besides my command. General Couch, I learn, is at Shippensburg; will be here to-morrow.

Received order about returning to Waynesborough. Will attend to it. Very respectfully, your obedient servant.

WM. H. BOYD.

[P. S.]-No casualty on our side.
