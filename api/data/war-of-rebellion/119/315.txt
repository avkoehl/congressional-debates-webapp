WAR DEPARTMENT, November 7, 1863.

These papers are respectfully referred to the Commissary-General of Prisoners. The Secretary of War is not disposed at this time, in view of the treatment our prisoners of war are receiving at the hands of the enemy, to erect fine establishments for their prisoners in our hands. Whatever is indispensable, however, to prevent suffering, whether from the effects of the weather or other causes, will be provided by commanding officers of prison establishments if ordinary means fail, by the use of the prison fund if necessary to that end, as far as it will so, Nothing more will be authorized.

By order of the Secretary of War:
