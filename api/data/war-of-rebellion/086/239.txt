We are not informed as to the exact locality of General Rosecrans. Our latest advices lead to the belief that he was about fifteen miles southwest of Kansas City last evening.

Major McDERMOTT,

Commanding Escort:

The general commanding thinks it advisable that the company of eighteen men now on Grand River should scout down the river through the timber and join us at the crossing of the harrisonville road. They should start by 6 a. m. The same messenger that carries the order to draw in the couriers can carry the order to this company.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
