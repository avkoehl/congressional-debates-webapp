even if it was to save his life. Camell Bilt was arrested at the same time. He also deserves your consideration.

I saw a gentleman to-day from Centreville who had been arrested and taken there. He reports a great many tents there, but few men.

Please send me some late Southern papers.

Very respectfully, &amp;c.,

Lieutenant-Colonel.

SEPTEMBER 2, 1863.

GENERAL: I attacked yesterday a portion of Kilpatrick's command on the Barbee and Orleans road.

Killed 6, wounded 10; captured 24 prisoners, 30 horses, arms, equipments, &c., also 1 first lieutenant.

A large force of cavalry came to Leesburg on the 31st from Centreville, with five pieces of artillery. They are now at Middleburg. I have not been able to find out the exact number, but, from the information I have, think there were between 1,000 and 1,500. For several days after my raid into Maryland the river was not picketed, though it is picketed now. The force at Middleburg is commanded by Colonel Devin. Say they are determined to have me.

Lost no men in yesterday's fight.

Very respectfully, &c.,

E. V. WHITE,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding Cavalry Battalion.

Major General J. E. B. STUART.
