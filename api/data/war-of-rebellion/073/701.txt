Mills, where we bivouacked for the night. May 19, moved out this morning toward Cassville, formed line, threw out skirmishers in front, and advanced to within short distance of Cassville and to the left and rear of part of Twentieth Corps. May 20, moved out this morning on Cassville Station road; when within short distance of the station discovered the cavalry of enemy in front. The command was formed in line, with skirmishers in advance; moved forward skirmishing continually, occasionally heavy, to Cartersville, where the command was camped. Captain Bratton, of Sixteenth Kentucky Volunteers Veteran Infantry, was severely wounded during the advance; some few privates were wounded during the day. I cannot refrain from speaking in the highest terms of the efficiency and bravery of Major John S. White, of Sixteenth Kentucky Veteran Infantry, who was in charge of and conducted the skirmish line of brigade during the day. May 21, brigade remained in camp during the day, except the One hundred and fourth Ohio Volunteer Infantry; the latter regiment made a reconnaissance on the Allatoona road to the Etowah River in evening, losing 2 wounded and burning station-house at river. May 22, the One hundredth Ohio Volunteer Infantry, Sixteenth Kentucky Volunteer Infantry, Eighth Tennessee Volunteer Infantry were ordered to and did proceed to the Etowah Mills, some five miles from camp, and destroyed the mills containing large quantities of corn, flour, &amp;c., and other buildings connected therewith, skirmishing slightly with the enemy while in vicinity of river; command reached camp about 8 p.m. May 23, brigade moved out this morning and marched to Etowah Cliffs, on north bank of Etowah River, and bivouacked for the night. May 24, crossed river on pontoon bridge of Twentieth Corps and marched to Burnt Hickory Ridge and camped for the night. May 25, moved about 2 p.m. and marched to Burnt Hickory, when command halted until about 1 a.m. May 26, marched to and across Pumpkin Vine Creek, and were placed in position on extreme left of the division and connecting on right with Second Division of corps. The brigade advanced some distance in line in an easterly direction until

Creek was crossed at----cotton-mill, near which the skirmishers of enemy were met by our skirmish line; skirmishing continued during the day and night, the brigade losing 1 killed and 2 or 3 wounded. May 27, the command occupying the same relative position to the other portion of the division and corps, was advanced some distance to the crest of ridge immediately opposite crest occupied by enemy's fortifications, which were held by apparently a very strong force. The brigade fortified this position during the night. The command remained in this position until dark on the evening of June 1. During almost the whole time a constant fire was kept by the enemy upon our lines. I regret to report that Captain M. C. Horton, Company D, One hundred and fourth Ohio Volunteers, was killed by a musket-ball while in rear of our first line on 28th of May. Captain William Bishop, One hundredth Ohio Volunteers, was severely wounded; since dead; and also Second Lieutenant H. Sherbondy, One hundred and twelfth Illinois Volunteers, wounded on skirmish line of the 29th, and Lieutenant Taylor, of sixteenth Kentucky Volunteers, wounded on 27th while reconnoitering enemy's position. While in this position the enemy daily made demonstrations upon our skirmish line, the command suffering in either killed or wounded
