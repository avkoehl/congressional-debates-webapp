Numbers 3. Report of Commander Foxhall A. Parker, U. S. Navy, commanding Naval Battery.

CAMP EDGEWARD,

Morris Island, S. C., August 23, 1863.

SIR: I have the honor to report to you that, agreeably to instructions from General Gillmore, the Naval Battery, under my command, opened upon Fort Sumter with two 8-inch Parrott and two 8--pounder Witworth guns, on the 17th instant, since which period we have been engaged from daylight to dusk of each day, up, to the present time,

The whole number of Parrott shell expended amounts to 703, or which 373 struck the fort; 252 fell short or went over it, and 78 tumbled.

From the Whitworth gun, 222 soil projectiles were fired, of which 98 hit and 124 missed the fort.
