hour, of over 12 tons in weight. It has but one engine, and we have but five, making six in all, fit for use upon present track, and equal, at best, to eight cars of troops or hay, and six or seven of heavy freight, at from 7 to 12 miles per hour. We had to put up two new water stations, and rebuild several bridge over, say, 75 yo 100 feet long and 30 to 50 high. We have no idea at all of present condition of bridges, water stations, &amp;c.; but if they are obliged to abandon it, they will, doubtless, make sad havoc; indeed, our own troops completely destroyed all the buildings of road at and near Winchester on 3rd September, at their last evacuation. Nothing but an entire renewal of track, with not less than 45 pounds T-trail and new ties, will make it fit to use for over 40 to 60 cars per day, and they work at great cost and difficulty. We are without ties almost entirely, and have but little iron. We could do the work very rapidly with your aid in labor to cut ties along line and in getting iron. I will consult Mr. Garrett and Mr. Quincy to-day (Saturday), and advise you further.

HEADQUARTERS DEFENSES OF WASHINGTON,October 11, 1862-11.10 a.m.

General R. INGALLS,

Headquarters Army of the Potomac:

I learn the following facts: The Winchester Railroad is perhaps the worst in the Union-thin slab rail for more than 30 miles. Only one siding on road holding more than 12 cars. Utmost capacity about 52 cars per day. No ties or iron on hand to reconstruct road. To purchase iron, cutties, and reconstruct road might require at this season six weeks. If the enemy is expelled from the valley, your supplies would go via Manassas Gap Railroad. As this would be the design of any movement, would it be expedient to reconstruct the Winchester Railroad? Pleas consult General McClellan, and give me his opinion.
