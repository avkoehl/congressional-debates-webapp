CINCINNATI, May 26, 1863.

PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:

The extension of time to Campbell and Lyle in justice requires the same extension to the others condemned to be hung on Johnson's Island next Friday, and I have therefore ordered that the executions be postponed one week till I can hear more definitely from you.

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND, Murfreesborough, May 26, 1863.

Brigadier General L. THOMAS,Adjutant-General U. S. Army, Washington, D. C.

GENERAL: I have the honor to inclose herewith a copy of a letter just received from Colonel Hoffman, commissary-general of prisoners, and to ask your attention in connection therewith to the marked passage in General Orders, No. 31, from these headquarters, series of 1862.

Colonel Hoffman's letter seems to convey the idea that it is not the wish of the Secretary of that any persons who are or have been in the Confederate service should be treated otherwise than as prisoners of war. I desire specific instructions on this point as I am well assured that large numbers of men now in the Confederate Army, especially the Kentuckians, would desert if they were sure they would not be returned for exchange. As it is many deserters are admitted within our lines who express great unwillingness to be returned and who desire to become peaceable and law abiding citizens. Great care and judgment has to be exercised in liberating these men, but there little room to doubt that in most cases their statements are true and the desires they express honest.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General of Volunteers, Commanding Department.
