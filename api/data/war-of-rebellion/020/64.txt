The medical officers of the division were and have been unwearied in their exertions and attendance upon the wounded both in the battlefield and in the hospital. The medical director of my division, Dr. George S. Kemble, is especially entitled to commendation for his good arrangements and activity.

I herewith submit the reports of brigade and regimental commanders and of commanders of special arms. I call special attention to the mention made therein of gallant conduct on the part of officers and men. Where so much intrepidity and devotion were exhibited I cannot do more than to refer to the sub-reports, with the expression of my judgment that every case noted is well deserved.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your most obedient,

ISAAC I. STEVENS,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
