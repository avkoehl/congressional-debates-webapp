I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

RICHARD I. DODGE,

Major Twelfth Infantry, Acting Assistant Provost-Marshal-General.

[Indorsement.]

JANUARY 16, 1865.

Respectfully submitted to the Secretary of War.

The duties referred to within do not properly belong to provost-marshals, and as they have enough to do without them I do not think it best to require their performance. I therefore submit the subject, that some other branch of the Department may be called on to attend to the matter if it is deemed worthy of attention.

JAMES B. FRY,

Provost-Marshal-General.
