still profess to be loyal to the South. They are so far from me that I have had little intercourse with them; the same of the Seminoles and others than those mentioned. I shall be very glad to see a superintendent, to whom I can turn over the whole subject of feeding the destitute. This matter has become interwoven with the supplies for troops in a manner that embarrasses any calculations that can be made. The disposition to drain all that can be gotten from the public crib exists with the Indian as well as with the white man. A few days since I discovered in a list of "indigents" a man with 20 negroes.

If your order Speight's brigade to move toward Vicksburg, I should like to have a regiment sent to this place to relieve the one on duty here, and one with a colonel or field officer of some character, who can be trusted for a short time whenever it may be necessary for me to move about in my district.

I have written the above with freedom, giving my own ideas; but should your views differ from mine, I shall, nevertheless, endeavor to carry out to the utmost of my power any line you may suggest.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

WM. STEELE,

Brigadier- General.
