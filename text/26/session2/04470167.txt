"In 1835 a black mm, of irreproachable character, and who

carman's license, and was refused solely and avowedly on ac
count of his complexion ''
We are rext told  that these free negroes are
''LIABLE TO BE SEIZED   AND TREATED AS SLAVE "  by
the Abolitionism, and then this evidence of the
insincerity and hypocrisy of these pretended friends
of humai rights is closed by showing how they ha-
bitually "subject" the negroes among them to "tnsult
end outrage "

the contempt with which th^y aie treated, aie indicated by the

PROSPECTIVE PRE-EMPTION BILL.
SPEECH OF MR. LINN,
OF MISSOURI,
In Senate, Friday, January 29, 1341—On Mr. Crit-
tenden's amendment to distribute the proceeds
of the sales of the public lands among the States.
Mr LINN addiessed the Senate as follows •
Mr President •  As this seems to be a day of
general settlement of accounts and misunderstand-
ings, I desire to say a few words in order to pre-
vent the possibility of any mistake in regard to my
course on the important question now before the
Senate.   Tne honorable Senator from Kentucky
[Mr. Clay] was in an error when saying that I had
remarked, that under no state of thing1  that could
present themselves, would I vote for the proposi-
tion of the Senator from South Caroli a [Mr Cal-
houn] to cede, under certain conditions, the pub'ic
lands to the States in which they lie.
Now, sir, I have never committed myself thus
far  against cession, although determined to vote
against it wh-n presented a  an amendment to the
pre-emption b ¡1    But more am I opposed, and de-
cidedly opposed, to  the gentleman's [Mr Clay]
v ell known proposition for distributing the pro-
ceeds of the sales of the public lands among  all
the States    I will watch, sir, all these  different
propositions wi'h care and   deep  interest when
they come up  at naked question1?, and  give my
vote   according to the dictates of my   judgment,
and   the   mteiest  of   my constituents.     Having
voted tor   one   distribution bill  already,   sir,   I
think   it more   tnan probable   u   shall   be   the
last—events   <=inee   that   lime, n t  very clearly
proving   us   wisdom      When   my friend   fiom
Kentucky [\Ir. Crittlndln]   mjved his amend-
ment or resolutions ot instructions to the Com-
mittee  on   PubLc Lands to   report   a bill, one
feature of which should be the distnbu ion princi-
ple, I promptly and instantly rose in my place and
remaiked that Í would move an amendment at the
proper time to his resolutions, to di«p se of the pro-
ceeds of the sales of the public lands for the benefit
of the whole country, by aporopnatmg them to the
mciease of the ¡navy, to the fortifications, and other
national defenc", for n was my  opinion that if
ihey were to be taken from the common  fund of
the Union, tnac the} should be devo'ed to high and
important national oljecis, to which I think they
justly and properly belong, and should ihi Sena-
tor s [Mr   Ca.TfKNDEN] proposition p ev?i), it is
my hxed de ermmanon then to present mine, and
press it vuih a i ¡V z al, energy, and abi'ity, in ray
power to command.
I do noikror, sk, how far a rember cm go ,n
condemning or characterizing measures, -ind still
not be personal to the mover. Tneie is some deh-
casy due to others, and some hauls or ought to be,
to the use of epithets, which, although applied to
measure*, were made often to stick to persons.
The honorable member from Kentucky [Mr.
Clay] this   morning, m the course of debate,
theught proper to speak of the resolutions against
the assumption of  State debts, and for which I
voed, as wanton, cruel, Danton and Robespierre
like, and even traitorous to the States    I should
be very sorry to use such epithets, to mark the cha-
racter of the proposition to distribute the proceeds
of the sales of the public lands.   But if such epi-
thets and appellations were strictly in order, with-
out meaning any thing personal to an individual,
or disrespectful to the Senate, I would be glad to
be informed of it, so that I may avoid a breach of
order, nor do I wish such information for self-protec-
tion against violent or harsh language, for the mart
that can give harder blows in that respect is welcome
to aH-tfcra-Jvantages he can gam; but this body of
grave men should be the last to resort to denuncia-
tory language, and even on this occasion, when
there might be same justification for it, I will not
resort to harsh words to mark with disapprobation
the proposition cf the Senator from Kentucky [Mr.
Clay] to dKtribute the proceeds of the public lands,
although presented at a time when the-Treasury
is empty, and wh n the aspect of affairs was war-
lite and threatening on every hind.   I know, sir,
this is a favorite project of the Senator from Ken-
tucky, and the pivot upon which many political
events will be made to turn, and that to sustain it
he would strain every energy of his soul; but, in
my opinion, this is the last moment m our history
that a proposition should be made to alienate any
poriioi of our revenues    Rather, sir, increase them
for great national objects.
Mr President, did not my colleague, a few days
since, in the most solemn arid impressive manner,
say ihat be wou d not at this moment permit him-
self to speak as he thought of the dangers that at
pre ent environed us?            *
I know him, sir, tobe one of the bravest men
that God ever made, and it bay seem something
like vanity and presumptions in me to say any
thing on this subjeet after suc|l a declaration. But,
sir, I must and will speak out' now, as ^heretofore,
and warn the country of its danger an4 defenceless
condition. I feel it a solemn and imperious duty
to do so Look for a moment^at out condi-
tion Why, you know w^U that a few years
su ce there were not men enough in garrison m
New York cr some other large Atlantic city to
fire a national salute on the arrival of a French
vessel of warm their harbor1 Yet a strenuous
opposit.on was then made i© the increase of your
army, and small enough it is now, after being dou-
bled by the act of 1833 Examine into the state of
the English navy, but the following l*tter from onr
Navy Department will show it at a glance.
