extended and truckling system of espionage; that no secret military movement against hostile Indians can be undertaken without the latter becoming possessed of the number, time of starting, direction, equipments, &amp;c. Such a state of affairs would be dangerous even were the head of this system actuated by kindly feelings and a humane disposition, but it becomes intolerable when on every hand are found striking and undutiable evidences of hatred to the Government, disloyalty to the Union, and affiliation and sympathy with treason in the East and savage massacre and plunder all around and about us.

It is difficult to restrain indignation when the harangues of the prophet and his aspostles each Sabbath fill the crowded synagoghe with flippant expressions of disloyalty and vulgar threats against the Union and those brave hearts yielding up thei lives upon the battle-field; when each reverse to our arms is, with mock tears and sneering lamentataions, pointed at as evidence of the truth of Joe Smith's prophecies and Brigham's weekly threats, adn each demonstration of traitors, tortured into magnificient victories, is held up to the admiration of the gaping throng as abundant proof of the impotence of Government and the sure destruction of the Constitution and Union. Yet all this must be endured by those who visit the tabernacle of the Saints on almost every Sabbath of the year. Were the exhibitions of hatred to the Government and its ministers, civil and military, confined to these vapid word discharges of long-cultivated spleen, it might be endured in silence, but such is not the case. The whole people are being thus educated (if indeed the term education may be applied in any sense to a community so plunged in the depth of ignorance and fanaticism.)

The whole people are being educated into the most complete hatred of the Government and the institutions under which we live, the two cardinal points in Mormon religion being contempt and hatred to the Union and faith in and subservience to the head of the Church. With no regard for the South, and in fact probably a repugnance to slavery and Southern institutions, the rebel cause appeals to and receives their hearty sympathy merely because it is regarded as the appointed means of destroying the Government. How far the ramifications of the Mormon Church as a religion extend among the Indian tribes within and adjoining this Territory I am unable to say, but that Brigham Young has in immense infuence over the savages and maintains frequent and intimate relations with them is past a doubt. I have the strongest reasons, based on many proofs, for believing that the recent raid on the Overland Mail Line, the massacre of drivers, and the stealing of stock were incited by whithe Mormons, and not improbably under the direct orders of the head of the Church. But whether this be strictly the fact or not, it is beyond the possibility of doubt that the Indians met with aid, food, and encouragement from nearly the whole Mormon people.

It is in proof before men that the savages have been collecting for weeks in and near the southern Mormon settlements; that they passed through a dozen, towns in small parties and large bands coming northward, avowing their purpose to slaughter and steal, to kill soldiers and break up the Overland Mail Line; that they were fed from place to place by the people and drew supplies from the public granaries; that in some instances they sent their couriers ahead to the next town to notify the bishop that they were coming, and to have a for them, and that their demands were complied with and no intimation sent to these headquarters of the impending slaughter. Not only did they boast that they would kill emigrants and break up the overland
