It will be seen that a wagon can haul from 1,200 to 1,400 rations of provisions, without salt meat. It can also haul forage enough for its team for ten days.

Three wagons for a brigade of 1,500 men is ample to carry its hospital supplies. An increase of one wagon for every 500 men is too great; I would suggest that four wagons be allowed for a brigade not less than 2,000 or exceeding 2,500; five wagons for 3,000 and not exceeding 4,000. A hospital tent complete only weighs 175 pounds; one wagon can carry the hospital tents of an entire brigade,with its quota of forage; two or three wagons should carry the balance of the supplies.

The ammunition, heavy and small-arm, is assigned on actual weight of over 2,000 pounds to each wagon.

Respectfully submitted.

[Indorsement.]
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,April 14, 1864.

Respectfully forwarded for the information of the lieutenant-general commanding.

The transportation of this army is a subject which has engaged my attention most particularly, and every effort made to reduce it to the minimum. It is believed a careful perusal of the within statement will satisfy the lieutenant-general that with the number of men now in the army no reduction is practicable, unless the amounts of ammunition, subsistence, forage, &amp;c., are diminished. There are now twenty-five wagons carrying subsistence for contingencies with these headquarters; also 180 for the quartermasters' repair depot, and possibly some of the provost-marshal-general's train that might be dispensed with, if deemed necessary.

Brigadier General D. H. RUCKER,

Chief Quartermaster:

Be prepared to furnish a train of 500 wagons, equipped and organized, in addition to those now at Annapolis, lately sent to Captain Blodgett, which are, I understand, 150 in number. These wagons should be organized and held ready for issue on short notice.

M. C. MEIGS,

Quartermaster-General.
