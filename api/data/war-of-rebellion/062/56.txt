If the rebels could be driven south of that river, it would serve as a shorter and better line of defense for Arkansas and Missouri than that now occupied by General Steele; moreover, it would open to us the cotton and stores in Northeastern Louisiana and Southern Arkansas.

I am inclined to think that this opens a better field of operations than any other for such troops as General Grant can spare during the winter. I have written to him, and also to General Steele, on this subject.
