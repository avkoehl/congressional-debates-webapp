By command of Major-General Meade:

S. WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

WARREN'S HEADQUARTERS,

November 27, 1863.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

The road I have had prepared will, I think, enable our ammunition trains and Reserve Artillery to pass up the hill opposite Germanna Ford. It turns to the left, crosses a bad little stream on a good bridge, gains the plateau by a side-hill location (on old road, passes near an old house); thence toward the right of the pine woods, enters the woods, and joins the plank road. It is all the way and old road, and needs now only to dig down the rebel breastworks across it, which is but a moment's work. Tell General Tyler to take a look at it. (See sketch.)
