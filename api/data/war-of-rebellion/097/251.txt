General Hays will maintain the connection of his pickets with those of the troops from the Army of the James.

General Miles will maintain connection with General Griffin and support him if necessary.

Division commanders will keep the commanding general of the corps constantly advised of their progress and the character of the ground they are occupying.

The headquarters of the corps will be about the center of the line of battle.

We have prisoners from Bushord Johnson's division. They report many troops coming down the road to attack us. Our two advances met and drove them back. They are now deploying on our front. I should like re-enforcements if your line will permit.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,
