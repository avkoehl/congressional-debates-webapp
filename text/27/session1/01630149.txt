The gentleman from Maryland had said that the time would
come when a tariff must be laid upon luxuries Ñow¡ he (Mr.
McK ) w&hed the people to know how the deficiency m the re-
venue of the Government was to be made up—whether these
thiee or four millions taken from it were tobe made up by the
imposition of taxes But did gentlemen of the Administration
paity ventme to say that this money was to be taken, and yet no
taxes be laid upon ihe people? No, not they. He was op-
posed to the proposed scheme of taxing sugar, tea, coffee, and
othei neie=i arie^ of life, which the poor man consumed, and
was in lavoi ol what he deemed to be the true Democratic po-
licy—that poliev which looks to the poor man as well as the rich
fhisbill wa-of a bold and danng character, and aristocratic m
its pimciplt  Pass this bill and every stock m the market
would iis>e at onoe And whyi Because twenty sx sovereign
btah.s of this pi oud Union would have been prostrated at the
leet of then own creature—Congress That would be the con
ilifon of the proud ¡states ol this Union And the people on
tin- othei side of thebioad Atlantic would greatly rejoice at it
Mr VIcK weiiton to declare that he would not throw any ob-
stacle in the waj of this Administration, and that he would
examine and ti-at all its measoies with fairness, openness,
caudir, and impaiuality, and those he could conscientiously
at>piove lie would sive his support to But, on the contrary,
it hesiwapiopobinon which went to change the entire policy
of the 1 ountiy, and to create embarrassment, he would be found
equally a  rtady to denounce and condemn it Ifhewerenot
to pmsue this 1 mu e, he would be false to himself and false to
Ins country Ht. wished thi people to know that, while the Go-
vernment was -it this moment actually m want, of about
$¿8,0üU,000 to 1 uable it to perform its functions, Congress
was about to take fiom three to five millions out ot
the public Tieasuiy Ho would recommend to the gen
tletr.ao fi om Marj hn J to bring in a Ml in reference to fo
reurnccl, and he would íecommend, too, that the duty be
taken off coarse bashing Mr McK enumerated several
othei ai tides, and then added, that he asked these things in
the name of the hard working men of the country. He was
leadyand wiling to so hand iu hand with the gentleman in
lelievmg the disnea of the country, lfhe would pursue this ¡sort
0! legislation wli'< h he had j u«t indicated He objected to this
billon anotliei ground, and that was its inequality It proposed
to i\e 10 pt-r ct 1 ( less to 'New York, and the either old States
than 11 ihe now -state-, and he <iaw no good and sufficient rea-
son wh> tht Immei should be treated worse than the latter. He
concluded by c uüemnius the bill as calculated to make the
■^titpi, dppendei t upon the Geneiil Government instead of ma
kmgtni Gepeia Government dependent upon the States.
Mi VfiV' RWUOliEjd that ht had listened very attentively
in tl t, ch bate t ulhis bill ior seveial tlavs past, and ltwasper
lectly ceitini ihat if he weie to undeitake to reply to the nu
iiieroi.-,aigiiinen's that hid ! etn anvanced, he would consume
moiethan the umtniuer of  the day     He therefore would
be bnef m wlut he had to  av      Almost every   gentleman
vi ho hadaidiei ed the committee, he had noticed, had com-
plained that the piovi'ion citing ten  percent more to the
lew States than to the old was monstrous and iniquitous m
its ih-iwctu    i>one of his fnends,  that he recollected, had
a—laned the reasens why the distinction was  made between
ihe   new  and    the  old  States     Hie distinction,  then, he
would  sav,   was  to  pievent miustlce and inequality being
done to ihenew States, who„e population was comparatively
-pai e at  pres nt, though   happily increasing  every day
Hence it was that the ten per centum was proposed to be
a ven to them  and i'«o to equal ze the division of the proceeds
1 f the sales of the public lands as fairly as impossible    Exact
justiie cotllnot alwa^ be obtained, and m the present case
an attmpt wi-  made   to  apptoximate as near   to  it  as
nu-ht be, and!    knew of no laner mode by which to equal-
i?p"anil treat the matter as le-pected il the States, than by
allowing ten pi 1 cent t) ail the new fctates ir which the land
lifb    He did notthn k the objections of reutlemen to this sec
non of the bill weie well founded    it would be found, accord
or to the last (emus, that ihe Repnsva alive strength of the
new Mates in thi-. House, as based upon 11 «ir lespe etive popula-
tion, w is n finitely gieafer than ten pel cent   indeed it varied
fan tmtaiiiount to about lifty per cent    How, then, look
mir at this fact, i oulil gentlemen complain that it was unfair and
unequal to give the new States ten pel cent?   Many of the
gaiilemen   who  attacked  this  bill  had represented that it
>i  II put the Mites in the position of beggars, and asde
tuIiiu tnems-olvcs when   they came to this Government
and   asked   lib    assistance      'Ihe    idea    that    gentlemtn
