nue, as feu as xt might be convenient, or (o meet a
temporary deficiency m the revenue, like the pre-
sent, than to use bank notes, or resol i to a  loan
He did not wish to be undeistood as going furlhei
There was no contradiction between his coarse
now and formerly, as the Senator supposed. He
never doubted that the demand of the Government
for gold and silver to pay its dues, would: more or
less disturb the process of resumption, but not to
the extent for which he and others, who thought
with him, contended, while he regarded the good
to be attained as infinitely outweighing the evil
It is not difficult to see, why the advocates of the
banks should be so much m favor of a loan It is
a ver> profitable transaction to those institutions
to exchange credit with Government, and receive
nearly seven per cent to boot, getting at the same
time a better credit than their own.
Mr C concluded in showing that the Senator
had not met the case he stated of A, B, and C, which
Mr C restated, and further illustrated, and said
that he would be glad to hear any one fairly state,
and attempt to answer it
Mr WEBSTER said he did not wish to resume
the discussion on the Sub-Treasury, but he would
say a few words in explanation, and I wish it, said
he, always to be understood that, when I insisted
that the Government should pay in specie, I always
added, "or the equivalent of specie," because spe-
cie-paying bank notes are equivalent to specie Un-
der the resolution of 1816, every thing was passed
to the credit of the United Slates as cash. Ind why
did we allow the payment ot specie-paying bank
notes? It was for the sake of convenience But
it was not said that they would not be subject to
loss It -«as not on account of their absolute secu-
rity, but of their convenience, that the joint resolu-
tion of 1816 was adopted There was danger of
loss, or at least no absolute security, and the same
may be said of specie uself, for that may be coun-
terfeited My argument was this that the paper of
speeie-payingbanks was received and paid, valuing
it ao a constant equivalent to specie; and this, is
iounded on the fact that specie-paying bank paper
is the representative of specie, having that which it
represents always at command The factis known
to be that the paper of such banks does pass as spe-
cie, and the Government adopted it on that ground,
and that was all I said
Eut I am glad of one thing that the gentleman
does not deny what I said in lespect to his being in
favor of aGotenimentpaper currency, but, on the
contrarj, has confumed i* If this is not the ten-
dency of the doctrine of Stfte rights, it is the result
of the doctrine of him and his friends, all tends to a
Government paper, a Government bank. He has
said nothing to show that I misrepresented him in
this respect. He is for a Government paper, and
I go against it. I am but for one standard, and that
is the standard of the community.
The gentleman says that my argument carries
contradiction in. it If it is m opposition to any
other argument of mine, that might be shown But,
as he w as rather indefinite, he may say that it is op-
posed to my course [It was opposed to an in-
ference of Mr Cai hous ] But what has been my
course, and what opinion have 1 ever expressed, or
what vete have I given, inconsistent with what I
have expressed to-daj' I do not see that Govern-
ment pays in specie any the less because it mes
the agency of the bptiks Foi twenty years we
have paid in specie, or its equivalent, and have
used the banks is our agents, and we use them
now The gentleman says he will have no-
thing to do with'ba'ik paper But what says the
Secretary of the Treasury? Does he not say that
he will receive bank notes, and has it not been pro-
claimed as a great merit in the Administration that
they do receive tkern? Does the gentleman sup-
pose that specie is now paid on goods imported' I
understand just the reverse, and that the merchant's
eheck is received for his bond, and this is justly
considered as equivalent to specie Therefore, if
these treasury notes were sold in New York, the
Merchant would gare his check lor them
The gentleman seems to complain that I did not
answer his case of A, B, C It was thus, as I
understood it He supposed three farmers of equal
Ctedit, but the Government says it will receive the
papei of C If that were the case, I should say it
would be a very foolish and unequal law. But if
he had put m the case of C that fus paper was con-
vertible, on demand, to specie, and that the paper
of the other two was not, he would then have a
parallel case, and it might be an advantage lo C to
give his paper this respectability But that is not
the object The great object of the Government is,
and ought to be, the accommodation of the public,
and, if there is an incidental benefit, that can be no
objection, but a recommendation But the object
is to accommodate the public and the Govern
ment
Mr CALHOUN said that he wished to be dis-
tinctly undeistood, that he did not carry his ideas
of the Government using its own credit beyond t'ie
temporary wants of the Treasury, and the conve-
mest management of its fiscal concerns.
If he did not censure the Administration for re-
ceiving the notes of specie-paying banks, it was be-
cause he believed that the laws left no discretion,
but, with his opinion, if he were the Chief Magis-
trate, and believed that he had a discretion whether
to receive such notes or not, he would not permit a
dollar of bank paper to be received There was a
heavy responsibility somewhere We are renew-
ing our connection with the banks, when it was ad-
mitted that a shock must again follow at no distant
day, unless some measure was adopted to prevent it.
He hoped gentlemen would bring forward their
plans for preventing it, so that they might be duly
considered He, on his pail, regarded the separa-
tion as the most safe and simple that could be
adopted, and trusted that it would not be sunen-
dered, unless some other more eligible could be de-
vised, of which, however, he had no hope
Mr PRESTON argued at length against the
adoption of the bill He would give Ins assent in
no shape or form to the establ shment of the repu
diated and continental s) stem of paper money. He
should meet the crisis boldh, and not seek to hide
the matter under the garb of a re-isme of Treasui y
notes This bankrupt state of the Treasury must
have been known, or at least forcssen. The sales
of the public lands had almost entirely ceased, the
revenue from the customs was dried up. Why,
then, were the States not called on for the restora-
tion of the deposites? He would answer, that the
people might rut have their eyes opened to scruti-
nise the conduct of the present Administration, that
Administration which had promised so much in the
waj of trenchment and leform, and done so little1
That ejplained the partiality for Treasury issues,
that splendid financial operation, which made money
for the Government by the skill of the engraver, the
object of which was to conceal from the people
the state of embarrassment whiah misrule had
brought upon them. We were told last session
that it was a case of great emergency and pressing
distress Give us an issue of ten millions, that
shall be the last you will ever hear of it, and yet
in the space of a few short months we are called on
for ten millions more. It would appear that when
we got out of money, all we had to do was to send
to New Yoik, a little steel, and copper, and ink,
were the only mgiedients necessary lor the issue,
as the people had already forgotten the Common-
v, ealth piper of the Revolution and the assignats of
France What was the object ol all this, but to
bung the people by degrees to the adoption of a
Treasury Bank Mr P denied the constitutional
right of Congress to issue bills of credit, and for so
high a right as that he would claim the express
power, we had the right to tax, and to borrow, and
the enumeration of these powers showed clearly
that the right to i sue bill  of credit was not in the
grant Mr P then read an amendment which he
had prepared, calling on the States for the amount
of the surplus fund deposited with them, in the pro-
portions, and at the dates, prescribed by the depo-
site act, but which, he said, he would not offer at
the present time
Mr CRITTENDEN opposed the bill on the
ground that this mode of raising money led to ex-
travagant issues, and therefore ought to be dis-
couraged In three years this Administration, with
ths cry of íetrenchment and reform, had spent one
hundred millions of dollars, and now gav« out an
"emerge/ley "   If this were to continue, and the
people called on for ten millions every few months,
the sooner the Administration was in the bills of
moitahty the better! Nothing could cure it but
keeping it from the money Mr. C. continued his
íemarks to some length, and announced his inten-
tion of voting for the amendment, because the
more limited the grants of money the better.
Mi. BROWN before the question was taken,
wished to makea few obsei valions,and he promised
the Senate thai he would detain them for a very
few minutes But for some remarks which had
fallen from the two gentlemen who had addressed
the Senate on the othei side, and for some errors m
point of fact which had escaped them, leaving him
in no surprise at the conclusions to which they
had arrived, he would not, at this late period of 'he
dav, have trespassed on the indulgence of the Se-
nate In the first place, the Senator from Massa-
chusetts spoke of the depreciated condition of Trea-
sury notes, and contrasted them with the notes of
the banks, greatly to the advantage of the latter
One ol the arguments of that gentleman, predicated
on this assumption, was, that Treasury notes should
not be offered to the creditors of the Government,
but that they should, at all times, have the option
ol leceivmg gold and silver, or their equivalents.
Another honorable gentleman, distinguished in the
ranks of the Opposition, took occasion the other
day to say, thai the notes of the Government were
inferior in value to those of the Bank of the United
States. Now he [Mr. B ] happened to have in his
possession a statement, which conclusively esta-
blished life contrary. He saw m the prices current
of New Yoik, dated the 15th of ihis month, that
they had sold at par in the notes of banks which
weie redeemed in specie, and, therefoie, they were
equivalent to specie
At the very time that the gentleman uttered the
remark that the Treasury notes v ere inferior to
those of the Bank of the United States, the lattei
wee four or live per feut brlow par, when the
An mr r u ere abo\ c, or eq i a1 to it He found, also,
by the same papei, that m the c ty of Philadelphia,
Treasu,y notes sold at 2i per cent advance. Now
there was that difference between the c irrent notes
of Phibdelphia and specie, and therefore, at that
place, the Treasury notes were equal to specie He
w.is astonished at the boldness with which gentle-
men for some time past had made in their places
similar declarations. He took the occasion to say
that these errors and misrepresentations we e of a
piece with many others that daily went out from
this body One of the great objects of a certain po-
litital paity seemed to be to assault and destroy the
credit an ¡ character of the Government of the
United Stales, and while they did that, they, in the
same breath, sought to elevate the credit and cha-
racter of the Bank of the United Slates Such as-
saults were not only agiuist the credit and charac-
ter of the Government of the United States, but they
weie against the honor and character of the people
of the United Slates, for ihe people and the Go-
\ernment were identified, both m credit and in cha-
racter and their pecuniary and political intsrests
were indissolubly connected together. Notwith-
standing the acknowledged tiuth of this axiom, we
have heard gentlemen from day to day endeavoring
to bring down the ciedil of the Government of their
country belo v that c( the most corrupt banking
corporations, and yet they would talk of their pa-
triotism1 Patriotism' Why, it was said that the
De il could quote scripture, when it suited his pur-
poses to do so
No man was moie averse to an extravagant ex
pendil ue sf the public money than he was He
was one ot that school, who believed that a rigid
and judicious economy, in the management of the
j pu'ilu finances, was essential to the preservation of
I oui ins ¡unions in iheir original pmity, and he
would I c the last man to s.tnet on ,i igsort to the
uedtot the Government for the encouragement
of waste or extravagance But the Government
was embarrassed, and that embarrassment was
brought about not by its own acts, but by a great
moneyed power, acting m concert with a certain
political party, whose only hopes of success rested
in destroying the credit of the Government, and
diying up the resources and commeice of their
country.   It was one of a series of actions, put
