THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
February 22,
York, as a free city, may shed the only light and
hope of a future reconstruction of our once blessed
Confederacy."
Thetis were the disloyal and disunion senti-
ments at that time of the mayor of New York,
Ferfa.ndo Wood.
Mi. WOOD. Mr. Speaker 
Mr. TOWNSEND. A moment more, and
I am willing that the gentleman shall have a
full opportunity to reply. In the same month,
in 1861, when Robert Toombs telegraphed to
his honor, Mayor \Vooi>, of New York, to
know why it was that arms had been taken
possession of by the authorities of New York
that were intended to go down South to be
put in the hands of southern Democrats to
disrupt the Union, the mayor of New York,
Fernando Wood, made the following reply,
which was published in the New York Times
of January 26, and is to be found in the first
volume of the Rebellion Record, Documents,
page 20:
In reply to your dispatch I regret to say that the
arms intended for and consigned to the State of
Georgia have been seized by the polico of this State,
butthat thecity of New York should in no way be
made responsible for the outrage. As mayor I have
no authority over the police. If I had the power I
should puinmarily punish the authors of this illegal
and unjustifiable seizure of private property.
i-'ERNANDO WOOD, Mayor.
Hon. Robeet Toombs, Milledgeville, Georgia. -
I was therefore in no way surprised that he
should have brought these articles of impeach-
ment against. General Howard, for his record
and hi3 political history make him the anti-
pode of the Commissioner of the Freedmen's
Bureau, and of anything that belongs to our
common humanity. [Laughter.] I have given
you, Mr. Speaker, a little specimen of the
loyalty of the gentleman from New York ; let
me now give you the sentiments of the mau of
whom he this day in this House stands forth
the accuser. A few, short weeks after this
telegraphic correspondence took place, Gen-
eral Oliver 0. Howard passed through that
same city of New Yoik, and then and there
he was the recipient of a flag for his regiment.
What did he say on that occasion?
[Here the hammer fell.]
Mr, TOWNSEND. Allow me one moment
msre. [Cries of '• Go on !"]
The SPEAKER. Is there objection to the
gentleman from Pennsylvania proceeding?
[Loud cries of " No!" '"No!"]
Mr. WOOD. I do not object to the remarks
of the member from Pennsylvania, provided
the House will extend to me the same cour-
tesy. [Loudcries of "Agreed!" and "That's
right!"]
Mr. TOWNSEND. A few weeks thereafter,
on his way to the front, with the spirit of loy-
alty burning in his bosom, General Howard
stopped in the city of New York, that was
ruled over by this loyal mayor, and oil that
occasion lie made this reply to an address pre-
senting him with a flag for his regiment:
" I was born in the East, but I was educated by
my country. I know no .section ; I know no psirty,'
and I never did. I know only mycbnntry to love it,
aud my God that is over my country. We go iortll
to battle, and we go in defense of righteousness and
liberty, civil and religious. We go strong in mus-
cle, strong in soul, because wo are right. I have
endeavored to live in alt good conscience before God,
and I go iorth to battle without flinching, because
the same God that has given his spirit to direct me
lias shown me that our cause is righteous; and I
could nut be better placed than I am now, for He has
Kiven mo the warm hearts of as noble a regiment as
tho United States has produced."
And he did go forth to battle ; and but a little
time thereafter lie gave up his good right arm
to the cause of his country, and was fighting
the battles of the nation while the gentleman
frjm New York was sympathizing with the
Democratic party in convention assembled,
that was hanging out the dirty white flag of
surrender in the city of Chicago. [Laughter.]
This, Mr. Speaker, was the difference between
these gentlemen. I feel that it is exactly
according to the " eternal fitness of things"
that the one should he the accuser of the other.
And now, Mr. Speaker, much lias been said
with regard to General Howard and the Freed-
men's Bureau. I ask a few moments only to
say a word in his vindication in regard to that.
The Freedmen's Bureau was the outgrowth of
the war ; it was the outgrowth of the Demo-
cratic rebellion. Every leaderin that rebellion,
from Jeff. Davis down to the lowest officer
in the Army, was a Democrat. I say, there-
fore, that it was a Democratic rebellion; and
after it was crushed out by the good right
arms of northern patriots there arose a situa-
tion of affairs in the South that called upon
Congress to take charge of the loyal southern
people. The Freedmen's Bureau was created
for that purpose and Abraham Lincoln looked
around for a man who was qualified by his
firmness, decision of character, and humani-
tarian principles to take charge of this insti-
tution. His eye fell upon General Howard,
who had lost his arm, and who had been
thanked by Congress, and was known to the
nation as a gallant soldier and a Christian
gentleman. Mr. Lincoln died by the hands of
an assassin before he had made the nomination,
but Andrew Johnson came into power and
made the nomination, and General Howard
was appointed Commissioner of the Freed-
men's Bureau.
I would have liked to have time to go into
the details of this matter, but I can only say
briefly that a committee of ten of this House
examined into all the charges of the gentle-
man from New York from beginning to end.
We gave him the whole power of the Govern-
ment with its Argus eyes and its Briarean arms,
to seek for and to bring from all parts of the
country all the witnesses that he called for to
support his charges. They appeared here in
our committee-room, and for sixty days, more
or less, they were examined by him and his
attorney, while General Howard only occupied
three days, and eight out of ten of the com-
mittee eame to the conclusion that no one of
the charges was sustained.
And more than that, I want to say that every
dollar General Howard has expended has been
spent in the cause of patriotism, humanity,
and philanthropy, and has been accounted for
to the officers of the Treasury, and ratified by
those accounting officers.
I know the feeling of the Democratic party
against this bureau. I know they hate it be-
cause it has been the friend of the negro, and
that the negro recognizes the obligation. I
know they have endeavored to cast a slur upon
the fair fame of General Howard. Let me
tell the Democratic party that in that puny
political effort they have signally failed, and
that the name of Howard, which in the Old
World is the synonym of patriotism and love
of mankind, has lost none of its luster in the
New; and I repeat it, that the name of Oliver
0. Howard, Commissioner of the Freedmen's
Bureau, whom they have persecuted so long,
will be remembered, as long as written history
endures, as the friend of liberty in every clime,
and long after the names of his accuser and
persecutors are forgotten; or if their names
shall be remembered at all, they will only be
remembered in a connection not unlike that
of the ambitious youth who endeavored to ob-
tain immortality by applying the incendiary
torch to the Bphesian dome.
Mr. WOOD. I can readily conceive that, a
cause so bad as that which the gentleman from
Pennsylvania [Mr. Townsend] appears in this
House as the champion of would seek to divert
attention to some other topic or to some other
object. The strategic ingenuity of the geutle-
man from Pennsylvania is not original; it has
been resorted to from the foundation of Chris-
tendom to this day; it is common for the wrong
and the defamatory to seek to divert attention
to another direction.
Mr. Speaker, I had not intended to indulge
in any personal accusations or any personal
defense. Whatever I may be, whatever I may
have been, is a matter of little concern to this
House or to this country. I may have been a
rebel; I may have been a traitor; I may have
been a general in the Union Army ; I may
have perpetrated all and every outrage known
to the criminal calendar. But what has that
to do with the subject under consideration?
I am but an individual member of this House;
but acting in pursuance of my duty, and with
a conscientious desire to discharge that duty
faithfully, not only to my own constituency,
but to the whole people of the United States,
aware of all the responsibility and all the
gravity which the occasion requires. And
whether I "be what the gentleman would like
to make it appear I was during the war or not,
is a matter of no concern connected with the
subjeet now before the House. It is now the
first time within my long congressional career
that I have felt compelled to notice personal
accusations on this floor. While I do so, I
hope the House will pardon me, not only for
the egotism which my reply to those accusa-
tions must necessarily lead me to exhibit, but
for the valuable time of the House and of the
country which I shall take in discussing a
matter of so little concern as this. .
The gentleman from Pennsylvania has read
something he has found in a work published by
the Clerk of this House, that purparts to bean
extract from a message sent by me as mayor
of the city of New York in 1861 to the common
council of that city. Hecommeuced by telling
you that that extract would prove that I was in
favor of the secession of the southern States.
Sir, I submit that when the extract was read, it
simply showsthat I, like many others, believed
at that time, under the then existing circum-
stances, secession was possible, and my recom-
mendation to the common council of the city
of New York was, that as the great metropoli-
tan city of the United States, as the city which
controlled all the great monetary interests of
the eountry, she might, if such a calamity should
befall us, retain her metropolitan commercial
power.
Neither in the extract-read from that mes-
sage nor in any other part ef it was there a
single expression, not one, that could be con-
strued into any desire to bring about a dissolu-
tion of the Union. So for from that, it was
upon my message to the common council of
the city of New York that the very first dollar
of public money was ever voted by any city or
State of this Union in favor of sustaining the
Army of the Union. I sent a special communi-
cation to the conflbon council of the city of
New York, recommending that an appropri-
ation of $1,000,000 be made to sustain the
Army of the United States before any action
was taken by the Federal Government here to
sustain the Union ; that that amount of money
should be appropriated by the city of New
York for the purpose of fitting out troops.
And, sir, upon that message, SI,000,000 was
voted by the common council of New York
city; and with that §1,000,000 the Union de-
fense committee, organized by our city author-
ities, fitted out fifteen regiments of the finest
troops that went into the war. And I, sir, out
of my own private purse, every dollar of the
expense being borne by myself and never
reimbursed, paid for fitting out the Mozart
regiment, which was named after the political
organization to which I was attached.
1 refer to these things because I am com-
pelled to do so. The first great public meeting
gotten up in the United States after Fort Sum-
ter was fired upon by the confederates in South
Carolina was one called in the city of New
York the day after that occurrence. At that
meeting, which was held in Union square, John
A. Dix presided, Colonel Baker, (a Senator
of the United States, and who lost his life in
this vicinity in defense of the Union,) and
myself were the speakers.
The message to which I have referred, the
fact that those regiments were fitted out, and
the speech which I made at. Union square, are
matters of record.- Therefore, when the gen-
tleman rises here and imputes to me what haa
