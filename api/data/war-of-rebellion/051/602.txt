Thrash, representing himself a post quartermaster at that place, who informs me, through the telegraphic operator at Zollicoffer, that Brigadier-General Frazer surrendered unconditionally on the 9th instant. Enemy estimated at from 6,000 to 10,000; Generals Shackelford and De Courcy commanding. The gap was provisioned with meat for thirty and flour for twelve days, and 1,700 bushels of wheat. Captain Thrash, it seems, was present when the place surrendered, as he says General Frazer told him the surrender was unconditional. Many officers and soldiers escaped after the flag was lowered. Will send more authentic information when procured. I again urge that re-enforcements be sent here as soon as possible. Has the Secretary of War received my telegram* of yesterday? I start for Jonesborough this evening.

BRISTOL, September 14, 1863.

I have no doubt whatever of the surrender of Cumberland Gap. A number of officers and men escaped after the surrender, among them the major of a North Carolina regiment and Captain Thrash, the post commissary, instead of quartermaster, as I telegraphed you yesterday. All concur in stating that the place was surrendered without resistance. Conflicting reports as to the numbers of the enemy. Am I to have any re-enforcements? It is important that I should know.

(Received at Richmond, 21st.)

The enemy made a demonstration in force on us here to-day and were repulsed. My cavalry followed them to Blountsville, 6 miles from here. Their force engaged to-day are believed to have been not less than 2,000, all mounted, and six pieces of artillery. Five other regiments reported between Jonesborough and Watauga Bridge, but they had not engaged my force at the latter place this afternoon.
