and of the amount of ammunition required will be forwarded at once, so that it may be supplied, if necessary. All the horses for the expedition will be shod; and, if possible, each man will be provided with two extra horseshoes and nails to put them on. Captain W. H. Forrest, Crews' battalion, will be placed in command of one of the companies of the detachment. Five of the best wagons and teams, of six mules each, in the brigade, will be sent with the detachment. A similar detachment will be made from Neely's brigade, which will be ordered to report to you. You will assume command of both detachments and report with them to the major-general commanding, at 6 a. m. on Wednesday, May 18, for duty.

HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF EAST TENNESSEE,Dublin, May 17, 1864.

General S. COOPER:

I received a telegram from you several days since to order Brigadier-General Vaughn's brigade to Staunton as soon as he could be spared from this department. As the condition of our supplies and the absence of a part of his command in North Carolina necessitates still delay in his departure, I respectfully ask to retain these troops for the purpose of reclaiming East Tennessee from the enemy. I feel assured, from the reports made by my scouts, Knoxville and all east of that point can be taken by the troops under my command.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. E. JONES,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

[Indorsement.]

ADJUTANT AND INSPECTOR GENERAL'S OFFICE,

General Bragg has directed me verbally to telegraph General Jones to retain Vaughn's brigade within his command.
