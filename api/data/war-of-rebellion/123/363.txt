because some information is wanted before the answer can be given. Blaine represents that you directed him to assert that he was sent because you could get no answer from this Department to your communications. If there has ever been any neglect or delay, it has been for want of physical ability to attend more promptly, or for the reasons above stated. The immense business of this Department requires the laborious attention of its employes from twelve to eighteen hours a day, and it is painful to have complaints in the name of one so highly appreciated as you are by the Department stated in the most impertinent and offensive manner.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

WAR DEPARTMENT,

Washington City, D. C., August 12, 1862 - 11 a. m.

Governor ANDREW,

Boston, Mass.:

The Adjutant-General has been directed to muster out Major Wild and Captain Wardwell as requested. You must not be impatient if your request for officers from the field should not be answered immediately. The demand for them is so great for the new enlistments, and the exigencies in the field so critical, that it is sometimes impossible to comply with the request, and sometimes it is necessary to obtain information that is difficult to be had as to whether they can be supplied. This has occasioned the delay in respect to Captain Dana, in respect to whom I cannot answer even yet. You can have Captain Morris. We have this moment received news from General Pope that Jackson and his forces are retreating and Pope is pursuing. The battle by General Banks" force on Saturday was one of the most severe, gallant, and skillful engagements during the war.

WAR DEPARTMENT,

Washington City, D. C., August 12, 1862.

Governor ANDREW,

Boston, Mass.:

Your dispatch saying "I can"t get those regiments off because I can"t get quick work out of the U. S. disbursing officer and the paymaster" is received. Please say to these gentlemen that if they do not work quickly I will make quick work with them. In the name of all that is reasonable, how long does it take to pay a couple of regiments? We were never more in need of the arrival of regiments than now - even to-day.

A. LINCOLN.

BOSTON, August 12, 1862.

Honorable E. M. STANTON:

The nine-months" regiments of militia which we are organizing should be put into camp at once and under strict discipline. May I go on and make requisitions for quartermaster's and commissary supplies as for three-years" men?

JNO. A. ANDREW.
