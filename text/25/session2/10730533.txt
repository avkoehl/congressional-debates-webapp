to keep them in the right way I beg the gentleman from

cannot so readily believe [hat the sages of past times violated

Just as slow am I Mr Speaker, to believe that the gieat men,

a bill for-the fulfilment ot a contract It proposes to cany into

On the 30th of April, 1802, an act was passed authorizing the
people oí theeastern division of the Notthweatern Terikoiy to
foi m a Constitution and State Government In that Jaw the
piopcsi ion, somewhat modified, is inserted, and by Congiess
pioposed to the Convention winch was to assemble the next
sunimei In the act just quoted, live percent of the proceeds
of the landswithm the Stale aie proposed as a fund 10 make a
road "from the Atlantic waters to and On ongh the Slate, and
th" condition of the grant is, that the State shall abstain from
taxing thelands sold by the United States fox Jive years fiom
andaftei the day of then sale "
In the month offtovembei, 1802 the Convention of Ohio as
s med to the proposition contamedin the act of April, 1802, with
this modification that three fifths of the five percent fund
should be appiopnated to 1 tying otit and making roads wxihm
the State, and under us direction and aut hoi ity, leaving two pel

said to the purchaser ol your lands, buy of Ub, and youi pio
perty thus acquired shall be free ñom taxation for five yeais,
and thus you got an increase of price paid to you, what other
wise would have gone, in the shape 01 ítóes, into ihe cufiéis of
the States This is tiue 10 regard to almo&t all the lands in the
three States of Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois Each of these
States was admiitedinto the Union with barely sixty thousand
inhabitants Thequantity of lands ihehsold wassomcoaside
idble as to make no son of change in the estimated value of the
light we surrendered TakeOhio, foi example Shergave up
tuypubei tight (o tax all lauds then unsold for five years after
they should be sold She ha** then sixty thousand inhabitants,
she has now probably one million anda halt e f population,
and there are yet public lands unsold in that State. Thus, you
can see that we have released to you our light to tax Janda m
the hand's of nme-tweníieths of our people for five successive
years This, too, was done at a time when theie was bcaicely
any other subject of taxation but lands, and when, in the 111
fancy of our seveial State Governments, the first movements
ol political and social machinery iequire heavy expense from
those least able to bear it Let us see what it was m money
that we gave It will be found, on examination, that ihe three
States uneiested covet an area, according to the best authori-
ties, of something over one hundred and twenty millions oí
acres of land Deducting something for re^eivations made be
fore the compact, we may safely estimate the lands then to be
sold in the three Western States, at one hundied and twenty
millions of acres We gave up the right to tax these foi five
years from the day of sale What has been the usual rate of
taxation upon lands in these States? T think I mayfairlyaJhrm
that the rate ot taxation on lands in the three States interested
has been one dollai on every .hundied acres This, levied on
one hundied and twenty millions of acies, would give one mil-
lion two hundred thousand dollars per annum, which, m five
year0, the time fui which the tax wassuuendeiedby the Sta es,
wouldgive the sum of sn. mij lions op non ars Tint sum
have we paid into youi Treasury for youi piomise to complete
the road m question la addition to this, we sunendeied oui
sovereign right of taxation withm oui own limits—a neht it
self so dear to Slates that* as matter of pude,just pude. it¡> sur
rendei could only have been extorted by the strcngest hope <f
advantage—the hope of some gieat and stukmg impiovemcut
in our whole ct in'iy, such as thi-. great woik will be when you
complete it, as ) ou have promised
Mr Speakei, I lu\e shown that the three Western States
have given into the National 1 íeasury, in effect, ¡>ix million*
of dollars^ for the promise to con&uuct this road Let us now
advert foi a moment to the cost of the work as estimated at the
time of the contiact, and we shall find that the Government then
undeistood that this sum would construct the loadfiom the At-
Untie waters to the Mississippi nay, that, mall probability
theie would be a buiplus umuipinsf m the Treasury aitei the
road was finished The kind of road, itslocuion, and the time
of its completion, were all left with this Government to be ad
justed, under a fair interpretation of the compact After pio
per eximination it was determined to commence at Cumbei
land, and stuke the Ohiolinc at Wheeling, in vuginia
* On the 3d ol March, 1803, Mi Gallatin, then Secietarv of tho
Treasury, reports to Congiesa that the road had been located
from "Cumberland towards Wheeling, a distance ot seventy
miles, and adds, the expense of completing that pai t of the road
is estimated at $400,000 This estimate shows that the avciagc
estimated cost of the road, ovei by far the most expensive part
of it, was a trifle less than six thousand dolíais per mile The
whole length of the road, fiom Cumberland to the Mississippi,
as surveyed, is 650 miles, it may be a mile or two, more or Jess
Now, take the estimated cost per mile, asieported by Mr Gal-
latin, which was for the mountain region entirely, and lemem
bet tnat one half less, it was supposed would suffice to rrake
(he road across the level plains of the West, and wc shall &ee at
once how íeasonable it is that the Congress of that day, after
receiving what was equivalent to six millions of dolíais, should
mal« an unconditional promise to constiuct the road to the Mis-
sissippi nvei
The contiact, as then understood fiom the estimate, wassinj
ply as follows
Valueofthetaxieleasedm fivoi of the federal Government by
the thiee Western States     -                                  - «b 000,000
Cost of the road, 650 miles, at 66 000 per roilr   ac
cording to Mr   Gallatin's es'imate for the fast 70
miles              ...                                  -   33300,00ü
£2,100,000
Leaving two millions m the Tieasuiy, after making the load as
then estimated Upon this Mew, founded on facts and repin-
scntations of public men, contempoianeous with this compact,
it is clearly shown thst the States paid the F< deial Government
what the p irties then believed a lull consideration for complet
nig the load the entne distance pioposed Fiom this, whit Jul
lows'* Why, suiely that the Government piumi&cd to do whit
m conscience it ought that is, to do the act which they were
paid foi doing—to make tho load complete accoidmg to the
contract
But here, Mi Speakei I am toM that whatever may have
been the reasonable expectations of the paities, ab to the com
pietion of *his woi k, when the contiact was made, the Govern
ment only bound itscli to appropriate two per tent of the nett
piocecdsof the public lands, and that this has been done   nd
no morejs jemamo! tins fund applicable to di" pnipo->e   of

I think I have shown this fiom the pi oofs already adduced    I
grant you that two pei cent of the nett pioceedsuf ihe public
lands are pledged fortheperfoimamo of youi piomi e to mike
the road, but this pledge does in no &eu«¡e limit the contiact for
which it is only a meie security    let it bercmembcied hdt,
