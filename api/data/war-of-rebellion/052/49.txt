strengthened, unless a large portion of the new recruits are given him, which is not probable, because the army under General Joseph E. Johnston is being very much weakened by desertions. There is a strong probability that Johnston's army will be sent to East Tennessee with the intention of making a move into Kentucky. This is the opinion held by many of the officers and citizens. It is very much desired, and an effort to satisfy the public that Kentucky and the States north of the Ohio are to be invaded. Bragg's army has only one-third rations issued to it. Supplies are scarce and growing more so. Atlanta is the magazine for supplies. The feeling of the people of the northern counties of Georgia, bordering on Tennessee, has undergone some change, and is softening down. There is a strong Union sentiment in those counties but it is suppressed and kept down. It will manifest itself the first favorable opportunity. The feelings of the mass of the secessionists in East Tennessee are abating, and would entirely disappear in the presence of a Union army.
