If the three regiments ordered by the President to proceed to Richmond have not eft, order them off without delay via Knoxville. You will also direct Colonel Seibels to proceed with his Alabama regiment to Richmond via Knoxville. Let the be provided with ammunition before leaving.

WYTHEVILLE, June 4, 1861.

The PRESIDENT OF CONFEDERATE STATES:

I received this telegram from a reliable man:

The news is confirmed that thate are about 8,000 or 10,000 foot and 1,200 hrose of Lincoln's men marching rapidly for the Virginia and Tennessee road. We have no arms. From their position now, two or there days will take them to Dublin Depot. If you can send us arms, please do it. If not, come and lead us with such as we have. They are now in Fayette County, making forced marches.

M. W. McCOMAS.

I have no means of knowing the probabilities of the report, but have suspected for some time an invasion from the direction of Kanawha.
