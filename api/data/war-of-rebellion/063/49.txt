Colonel, Commanding.

LITTLE ROCK, ARK., April 5, 1864.

Colonel JUDSON,

Commanding District of the Frontier, Fort Smith:

If you can reach the commanding officer of the Ninth Kansas use my name and order him to report to you.

NATHAN KIMBALL,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DETACHMENT SEVENTH ARMY CORPS, Little Rock, Ark., April 5, 1864.

Colonel POWELL CLAYTON,Commanding, Pine Bluff:

COLONEL: I congratulate you upon your recent brilliant successes and hope that you may ever be equally successful. I need not ask you to be vigilant, for I know that is one of your characteristics. I desire you to send me a report of the force under your command, and to keep me constantly advised as to movements of the enemy; and, colonel, I hope that you can spare us a few horses. I have here some 500 dismounted cavalry, and they are useless in this condition. I desire to mount as many as I can, so as to send force against guerrillas who are threatening our railroad communications and playing the devil generally with citizens. I have a rumor that the enemy have crossed a force below you. How is it? If the enemy have left your front and Monticello, I may desire you to communicate with General Steele. If you can, arm the negroes you have and send the Eighteenth Illinois up here, as I presume you will have force enough without them. I need them, so that I can add to the force on the railroad. We have no news from the front. Let me hear from you often. I would be glad to see you.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

NATHAN KIMBALL,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

LITTLE ROCK, ARK., April 5, 1864.

Colonel GEIGER,

Commanding, Devall's Bluff:

Keep cool; use your infantry, cavalry, and artillery well if you have occasion to do so, in the best manner, and you will be in no danger. You have all the artillery you can manage well there.

NATHAN KIMBALL,

Brigadier-General.
