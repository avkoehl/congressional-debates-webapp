CAMP NELSON, June 11, 1864--11 p. m.

Captain J. B. DICKSON:

Every man for whom I have a gun is under arms and on the fortifications. We will do the best we can in case of an attack. We had but few arms and they not of the best quality. Keep me informed of movements of enemy during the night, if you get any information regarding them. Where is General Burbridge; has he left Paris?

S. S. FRY,

Brigadier-General.

CAMP NELSON, June 11, 1864.

Captain J. B. DICKSON:

Should you ascertain that an attack upon this place is contemplated by anything like a formidable force, I should like, if you could spare them from Lexington, to have some 400 or 500 sent here, either cavalry or infantry. A large portion of the men upon whom I have to depend are clerks and employees in quartermaster's and commissary departments, very few of whom have ever been drilled or disciplined for military duty. Anything more from Hobson?

S. S. FRY,

Brigadier-General.

LEXINGTON, KY., June 11, 1864--11 p. m.

Colonel J. W. WEATHERFORD,

Lebanon, Ky.

Have just received dispatch from General Burbridge at Paris. He says direct Colonel Weatherford to closely watch in the direction of Bardstown and Danville, and if any part of the enemy's force appears in that region to attack and destroy it.

J. BATES DICKSON,

Captain and Assistant Adjutant-General.

LEXINGTON, KY., June 11, 1864--1 p. m.

Brigadier General H. B. CARRINGTON,

Louisville, Ky.:

Have heard nothing of or from Governor Bramlette. Rebels left here yesterday morning for Georgetown; supposed to have gone east from there. General Burbridge started in pursuit with fresh horses last night, and will push them up and fight them steadily.

J. BATES DICKSON,

Captain and Assistant Adjutant-General.

LOUISVILLE, KY., June 11, 1864--9. 45 p. m.

Captain J. B. DICKSON:

We understand that Frankfort is besieged, and cannonading has been heard most of the day at Bagdad in direction of Frankfort. Where is General Burbridge? Keep me posted. Ample force will be provided.
