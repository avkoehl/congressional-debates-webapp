[General MEADE:]

GENERAL: Kitching's brigade is up and formed far in the rear, in two lines, on the edge of the woods, just in open space. our line holds on well. I see no stragglers coming back.

THEODORE LYMAN,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Volunteer Aide-de-Camp.

Rickett is coming up.

MAY 12, 1864 - 11.30 a. m.

Major-General MEADE:

GENERAL: Ricketts is rapidly forming in three lines, and will go in on the right of General Wright. The Fire is not so heavy and we hold the pits. They do not shell us now.

THEODORE LYMAN,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Volunteer Aide-de-Camp.

Major-General MEADE,

Commanding Army of the Potomac:

I sent the following to General Wright and received the reply below:
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,May 12, 1864 - 12.25 p. m.

General WRIGHT,

Commanding Sixth Corps:

Is there a point of attack near you which would promise success if the whole of the Fifth Corps was put in? If so, the corps can be withdrawn entirely from the right and sent there, abandoning this part of the line altogether. Let me know.

By command of General Meade:

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.

I think a large force might carry the lines at this point. I have not the force to do it.

H. G. WRIGHT,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major_General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS SIXTH ARMY CORPS,May 12, 1864 - 1 o'clock.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

General Griffin's division is needed to enable us to hold the position at the Angle in the enemy's works. My troops there are constantly pressed, and General Hancock cannot spare me a man. I think, from reports just received, that it would be dangerous to withdraw Griffin. Fire must be maintained constantly to keep down the enemy, and the troops now there should be relieved, having been in all day.

H. G. WRIGHT,

Brigadier-General.
