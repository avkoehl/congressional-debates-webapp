HDQRS. CAVALRY FORCES, MIL. DIV. OF WEST MISSISSIPPI,

Montgomery, Ala., May 8, 1865.

Lieutenant Colonel C. T. CHRISTENSEN,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

COLONEL: I arrived here yesterday with my command from Georgetwon, Ga. I have the honor to acknowledge receipt of the communication ordering me to report to General A. J. Smith. In case the cavalry here should be ordered west, I would prefer marching to Natchez or any other point on the Mississippi to embarking it upon steamers here. I respectfully request that the company of the Second New Jersey, now at Blakely, as well as the detachments of General Lucas' brigade which were at Pensacola, be ordered to join their respective regiments immediately. While at Eufaula I received dispatches from the Secretary of War, through Generals G. H. Thomas and J. H. Wilson, announcing the repudiation of the armistice by the War Department and ordering all commanders to push the enemy in every direction. I have furnished Major-General Steele with copies of these dispatches. I suppose you have received them via New Orleans. The command is in good condition and ready for operations. Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

B. H. GRIERSON,

Brevet Major-General.
