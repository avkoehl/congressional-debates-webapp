Stilesborough and Cedartown road crosses the Rome road. The enemy's trains were parked yesterday at Cave Spring. I can hear of no force of infantry this side Cedar Creek. The enemy thoroughly picketed every road in rear of his army and at such long distances from it that he might now be crossing the Coosa at some point below Rome. From all that I can learn, however, the rebel army is now marching on the road from Cave Spring to Blue Mountain. The Second Cavalry DIVISION, General Garrard, I learn, encamped last evening at Stilesborough and move to-day on the Rome road. My orders were to go to Van Wert. I have scouting parties in direction of Cedartown and Cave Spring. I would proceed with my entire command to Cedartown did it not exceed the above order. I can subsist my command in this country both as to rations and forage with but little trouble. Two dispatches have already been sent you, one by telegraph from Cartersville and one by messenger to Acworth. * I would respectfully ask for further instructions.

Respectfully,

J. KILPATRICK,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

CARTERSVILLE, October 11, 1864-3. 10 a. m.

General HOWARD:

Use all the cars and trains you can get to-day to send re- enforcements to Corse at Rome. Send organized regiments and brigades as far as possible, but don't let this delay your march. Your trains are safe this side of Allatoona. Pass when you can Stanely's trains, leaving them the road.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.

ALLATOONA, October 11, 1864.

General SHERMAN,

Cartersville:

My head of column is about a mile back. I can send 2,000 men at a time, and will have them for you.

O. O. HOWARD,

Major-General.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, Kingston, October 11, 1864-9. 40 a. m.

General HOWARD:

Be sure to bring some cattle along, say 1,500 above your original lot. Rome is quiet and Corse does not know yet where the enemy is. Army of the Ohio is now passing Kingston; Cumberland just behind. I left General Stanely near Cassville an hour ago.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.
