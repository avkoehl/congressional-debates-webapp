Indian Hostilities—Mr. Bell.
H. of Reps.
generation, or for a short time, withajust^ wise, and patriotic
prince, they hare nb-secüíity that hie successor may not prove
a foot or a tyrant Our form of govermrleht proposes to cor
irect this evil, to secure a perpetual succession of wise and vir
tf&ousrúíefs, through frequent elections hy the people But
VAI11 say, as I have often heretofore maintained on this floor,
thatall the evils of the worst form of government that now ex
jsts among civilized nations may be visited on this people,
-when we choose to elevate to the highest executive trusts men
who are destitute either Of the proper skill and talents, or, what
is still more important ^han talents, of patriotic purposes and
principles In this country, and-under our form of govern-
ment, the abuse of the appointing power alone is suj&cient to
render the best laws abortive, and to destrov the efficiency of
any branch of the public service
What signifies it what laws we have, or what we might have
passed, to provide for the proper execution of the various du
ties assigned to subordinate officers connected with the Indian
Service, if, after ail, the President will fill tht officeb with
Worthless and incompetent partisans'? with men who take of
ftce, and are appointed to office, rather that the) may pro
fit by their offic s, than that the country may profit by their
ssrvices Depend upon it, sir, if the head is wrong, the whole
system will go wrong, and fait mto disoider Let me illustrate
this position by referring to the judicial ti ibunals of the country
Of what avail aie good laws when the jud^e who administers
them is either corrupt 01 meompotent1* Another lllustiation
was whispered to me by a friend sitting near me, when this
straage argument was urged by the gentleman from Michigan
If your laws be evei so strict and guarded for the security of
orphans' estates, yet, if the judge who appoints the guardian 11
unfaithful, and will appoint a ushonest knave and take msuf
hcient sureties, what will pievent the estate from being squan
dered, and the orphans from beggary 1
fiut to test the aigument ol my colleague, and especially
that of the gentleman from Michigan, further on this point, I
will put the case of the Florida war, in the conduct of which I
have complained there have been the greatest abuses and the
most unpaialieled waste of the public treasure Does the
gentleman from Michigan mean to say—but Í know he has too
much good sense to entertain the idea—that, by proper attention
to our duties in. Congress, we could by law have prevented
these abuses, this extravagance? Does the gentleman mean
that Congress could have passed a la-v forbidding the Execu
tive to call more volunteers or othei tioops into the field than
two to every one of the enemy, or four to one, or six to one'i
And, I believe, m the last campaign we had in the field eight or
ten soldieis for every Indian wainor of the hostile party Is
this the nature of the legislation which the gentleman from
Michigan or my colleague thinks might have been effected, if I
had done my duty1* And if this is not the =011 of dbuse which
might have been corrected, I would like to know what abu es
he alludes to For my pait, sir, I have not lound fault with
the laws The laws, in the mam, relating to this service are
well enough As to the appomtmpnt of numerous public offi
c*rSj and prescribing annual salaries without authority of law,
that is an abuse which has only become striking and enormous
within the last few years, and duimg a period when it is noto
nous I had no power in th?s House to correct any abu*e which
tended to curb Execum e influence If Congress had even
passed laws to prohibit such a practice, the new doctrine as to
the extent of Executive power and discretion under the Con
stitution, m the construction and execution ot the laws, would
probably have made them unavailing
The next ground of attack assumed by my colleague relates
to the effoit which was in de, near the close of the session of
1836, to have a committee appo nted to exam me into the frauds
alleged to exist in the execution of the Creek treaty, with
power to sit during the recess, and to proceed to the scene of
the alleged frauds, and there tako the proofs In my first
address to the committee, I alluded to, and relit 1 upon the
failure of that attempt, a* evidence that Congress itself, or a
majority of the House of Representatives, refused to take ade
qtíate steps to ledxess the complaints of the Creek Indian?
J haá also contended that the expensive war in the Oieek
country, and all ti e other mischief which ensued, had been
the result of Executive mismanagement or abuse í showed,
also, that by the cas mg vote of the Speakei of this House, the
motion- for a committee to go and examine into the alleged
ftau.ds.and abu-es had been defeated, and that, instead of a
committee appointed by the House, the duty of appointing
commissioners to examine into them, as well as into the causes
generally of the wai, had, by the act of the House, been as
signed to the President' Thus the appropriate business of the
House—inquiry mto Executive abuses—was transferred to the
Executive himself, and he was empowered to appoint a com
missioner to examine into and report upon his own alleged
delinquency, lor such, in sub tance, was the nature of that
proceeding
My colleague |ustifies the conduct of the House in refusing
to authorize the Indian Committee to sit in the va alion, by
alleging that thecommntee w u!d have been engaged in elec
tioneenng—going up and down the country for the purpose
of producing effect upon the Presidential election My col
league read nom the speeches delivered upon the occasion, to
show mat such wis the ground taken by tho^e gentlemen who
apposed the motion I well remember the arguments used m
defeating that pioposition, and I remember that the expense
growing out of the piactice of appointing these travelling com
mittees was also relied upon, to show the impropnety of adopt
ing the. course proposed In answer to the allegation that the
committee, if appointed, would have been merely an elec-
tioneering one, I will only say, that the commissioners appoint
edhy the Piesidentto examine into thefiauds, as they were his
Warm partisans, might, with far more justice anl propriety,
havc-been suspected of devoting themselves to the business of
the pending Presidential election, than the Commttee on Indian
Af&irs, Sir, it is well known that the Ptesident himself was
industriously employed during that summer in the same voca
tiofi As to the expi nse incident to granting the committee
power to proceed with then inquiry m the recess, it is a suffi
dent answer to say, that the commissions! s appointed by the
Executive have be°n sitting two years, and receiving the pay
of member  of Congress all the while, mileage included, and
they have notyetall made then final report But m> colleague
has-examined the journal, and kund that, as eaily as the 9th
of January, 1836! the Committee on Indian Affairs had the
power, under the order of the House, to examine into the
frauds and abuses of the Indian Department, and he charges
that we did not take the first step towards the investigación of
the Creek frauds durhig the remainder of the session    Hence,
concludes that my professions are hollow j that my com-
plaints against the House for failing to give power to examine
are unfounded, and that I have raised a clamor about abuses
that never existed, or, if they did, that I had failed to examine
into them, when I had full power to do so that, in short, I was
the responsible and guilty person in this as in other like cases
Such is the substance of my colleague's allegations on this
point (1)
Now, sir, I beg leave to state that my colleague is wholly
m staken in his statements upon this subject It is true, that
the Committee on Indian Aftas had powei to exam ne mto all
abuses m that branch of the service as early as January, in
1836, but it 1=1 also equally true that the committee, from that
t me, until they applied for power to sit in the recess, were
most industriously and laboriously employed in the business
assigned to them If this statement be not satisfactory, I call
upon the members of that committee, who may be present, to
couoborate, as I know they wiil, whatl siy Sir, I repeat that
the committee proceeded, with all diligence and solicitude, to
discharge their dunes, as the records of iheir proceedings will
show The committee, then, had the whole range of abuses in
every quarter of the country to inquire into The Creek
iiauds were least accessible to them, but they proceeded, as far
as they had the means and the time, to inquire into them I
refer tho^e who may be disposed to leceive the «statement of my
colleage as true, to the files of papers in your clerk's office, to
refute it The Committee on Indian Affairs, it is true, did not
devote their whole time to this business during that session It
will be remembered that various questions of great public
interest and importance were pending before Congre&s during
that session The membeis of the committee did not think
proper to neglect those questions, and therefore they devoted
such portions of their time only as they could, when the House
was not in session, to the prosecution of the business before
the committee I trust that I have answered this part of my
colleague's attack fully and satisfactorily
My colleague next proceeded to notice what had been said by
me about the political engineerxng of the late Administration,
at a u  e when their attention should have been fixed on the
war then brewing in the Creek countty, and the one which was
raging in Florida I stated that those wars frrew out ©f the
neglect and bad management of the Executive chiefs, that
when our Indian relations demanded then serious and unre
muted attention, the lar greater portion of the care and solici
tude of the Piesulent was devoted to the bunging in of a sue
cessor and so of most of his lieutenants My colleague under
took to show that my «*t tement upon this subject was without
foundation, and that I had done great injustice to the late Pre
Pidpnt My colleagu went so far as to <<ay that he knew of no
other interference of the late President with the late election
than the famous Gwm letter My colleague must know very
little of the couise of he late President m relation to that elec
tion, if he suppo es that this is the only evidence that exists of
his interference (¿>
My colleague cannot have forgotten that the late President
pa d a visit to his State in the summer of 1836 My colleague,
who sits on my left, [Mr Carter] has a lively impression of
that visit, for the President threaded Ins district, and caused
him no httlp trouble an 4 annovance thereby But sir, the Pre
sident did not seek to disguise the object of his visi, so far, at
least, as a free expression of his views and opinions ol the par
ties to the then existing contest was calculated to disclose his
mentions He not only expressed his views verbally upon the
subject of the election, but he did not hesitate to put them
down upon paper, so that there can be no denial or cavil on
the subject To a committee, appointed by a public meeting to
invite him to partake of the hospitality of the citizens of Shel
byville and Bedford county, he denounced those who suppoit
ed the election of fudge White for seeking to undermine our
fiee institutions, and declared that their object was to deliver
the State into the arms of the Federalists, Milliners, and new
born VVhigs To this statement he subscribed his name, and
it was soon aftei wards published to the world in all the newspa
pers in that interest m the State I quote from memory, but I am
certain that I am not mistaken m the «ubstance of the charge
Many other declarations, t f the same nature and equally une
quivoral, might be referred to But it was not in 1836 only
that the late President emphyed himself m advancing the
cause of the present incumbent of the Executive chair He
was devotedly and industriously occupied in the same manner
in 1835 I hold in my hand a specimen of one mode of elec
tioneennsr in 1835, which i=> singular enough to deserve the a'
tentiorl of the committee It is a copy of a lettsi written to the
late William Blount, ex Governor of Tennessee and a man of
great iecnectability and influence in that State
Extractfrom General Jackson's letter to Gov   Blount, of
Tennessee, dated May 10,1835
"I would to God that our old friend Judge White would soon
disentangle himself from the false position that he has been
placed in by Bell, Crockett, and Co If he does not, he will
be política ly lost since lohn Bell has turned a good Whig, and

The original of this letter was put into the hands of a iate
member of this House, [Cave Johnson,] and he did not scruple
to read it frequently to laige assemblies of the peopld, ivhile
canvassing for a seat m this House, as an evidei ce oí the wishes
of the President m íelation to the pwiding Piesidentia] election,
andofhis own orthodox principles (3) But, besides writing
numerous letteis of misdescription, of which I had a know
ledge, the late President must have consumed a conaídejcabfe
portion of tlie time which would have been moie constjtu'ion
ally employed in guarding the public interests m FIoihU and
the Creek nation, in distributing newspapers and speeches un
der his frank Of thib iact 1 have a personal kiowled¿e All
the vile calumnies which appeared during that year in the co
lumus of a certain proMituted piefcs, 111 íelation to the origm,
motives, and intention of the movement m favor of Judge
White, and more especially m relation to my own couise, and
which, until now, have been confined to thecolumnsofkmdied
papers, were distributed and propagated undei the frank of a
Pi esident of the United States! There can be no mistake upon
this subject His own sign manual appeared upon the tnve
lope of a great number of such enclosures, lorwaided tomo
ñ oai various quarters of the Stafe Of the nature of these ca
lummes, I forbear to speak It will be sufficient to say, that,
human malignity could scarce do moie in the woik ol detrae
tion and slander (4. > Yet, with such vile and pestilent rrat ei

communicated, eveiyman of supposed influence and mtelU

Such were the means such was a pait of the machinery,
employed to blight the piospects of Judge White and his sup*
porters every wneie, and to elevate the present tenant ol the
Executive mansion, such was the nature of the plan adop ed
by unpnncipled party adherents, to fulfil the prophecy which
foretold that General Jackson would be able to crush me and
the other leadersof the rising opposition to Mr Van Buten, in
Tennessee, as with the foot of an elephant, ¡=uch was one oí the
devices by which my opponents sought to blast my character,
and with which 1 was distinctly menaced befoie I took my po
sition in opposu on to the favonte candidate of the Executive
I thank God that those efforts to deprive me of the confidence of
my fellow citizens signally failed m my own district, and 111
