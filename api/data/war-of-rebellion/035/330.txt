 [CHAP. XXXV.
into East Tennessee, from Somerset. Your dispatch received. Have just heard that Wheeler's, Morgan's, and Pegram's forces are on the Monticello road, advancing within 1 1/2 miles of Waitsborough. It is said they have sixteen regiments, and are scattered over 7 miles of the road. Their pickets at the river have been strengthened this p.m. I have ordered additional forces toward the river. Directions have been sent scouts across the river for news. We have no additional facilities for crossing. River not yet fordable.

Troops have four days' supply, and three days' in store. A train is loaded for to-morrow.

Beef contractors have failed in their duties. Forage not abundant. Road to Middleburg pretty fair, except bad hills.

Later.-Have only passed by battery with help of infantry. Will call on General Welsh, if I see a probability of being attacked by superior force.

S. P. CARTER.
