Howard; the ammunition train and the different brigade and division trains in the same order as when marching. I was ordered to remain in this camp, and to keep on hand five days' rations, and hold myself ready to forward any rations or forage, or all of the train, at a moment's notice. I kept the camp supplied with the necessary forage and rations, and sent them forward to the troops form time to time as ordered, using the wagons when possible and the pack mules at times when the bridge was impassable for wagons.

The corps was kept well supplied with forage, rations, and ammunition while on the march and while at Chancellorsville, and were encumbered with no unnecessary wagons except those which were with the First Brigade, Second Division, at Kelly's Ford, and which accompanied the troops on the march, and were finally sent out of the way to the east side of the Rappahannock.

Respectfully,

WM. G. LE DUC,

Lieutenant-Colonel, and Chief Quartermaster Eleventh Corps.
