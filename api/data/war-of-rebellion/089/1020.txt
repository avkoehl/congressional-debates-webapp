You will take with these 300 men from your regiment, making 1,000 in all, and immediately proceed, via the pontoon bridge at Broadway Landing, to the Bermuda Hundred line, where you will report to General Ferrero, commanding defenses, for temporary duty. The men will take all their equipments, sixty rounds of ammunition, and two days' rations. The movement must be executed as rapidly as possible, and if Major Slosson does not report as soon as the infantry is ready you will proceed with them, leaving the Engineers to follow.
