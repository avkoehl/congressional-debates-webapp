I believe I can prepare one here much earlier that will answer the purpose, as i happened to take the precaution to bring sixteen extra canvas pontoons with me. By reducing the length of a sufficient number of balk and chess of the wooden bridging now here, and using army wagons, which, I think, can be made to answer, I will try and get this up as a serviceable, not, of course, a perfect, train, probably within a couple of days, if you so order it.
