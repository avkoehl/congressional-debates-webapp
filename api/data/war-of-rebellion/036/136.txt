detachment with the Thirteenth Army Corps remained with that corps at Raymond, while those with the Fifteenth and SEVENTEENTH Corps moved forward to Jackson. On the approach of the army to Clinton, Lieutenant Sample, with one enlisted man, without support, reconnoitered the road within one-half mile of Clinton, and when the skirmishers reached that point, he, with Captain Hoyt, acting signal officer and an officer of the FIFTH Iowa, was the first to enter the town. S station of observation was immediately established, which overlooked the road in the direction of Jackson as far as the enemy's pickets, when the army entered Jackson next morning by different roads. Much good work was done by officers of the corps during the engagement which took place. Lieutenant [Clifford] Stickney, with Captain [Julius] Pitzman, engineer of General Sherman's staff, was the first to enter the city, and captured some 20 prisoners. Of the detachment with the SEVENTEENTH Army Corps, Lieutenant [Thaddeus C.] Withers was the first to raise the Stars and Stripes on the State capitol. While the Fifteenth Corps remained at Jackson, Lieutenant Sample made a reconnaissance of the country for 3 1/2 miles in the direction of Canton, meeting the enemy's lookouts, and afterward in the direction of Livingston for 4 miles, leaving the advancing army at Clinton.

At the battle of Champion's Hill the officers were active, and rendered very efficient service. Lieutenant Roberts was engaged in signaling while he could do so, and afterward served on the staff of General Logan, and was complimented by that general for his activity and bravery. Lieutenant Sampson, from a station at General McPherson's headquarters, communicated by signals to the right of the line, to a station which was established and worked by Lieutenants McNary and Morris, until the retreat of the enemy. Lieutenants Irvin and Gryden should also be mentioned for their services during this engagement.

Two days thereafter, Lieutenant Irvin led the advance guard after crossing the Big Black, reaching Bovina 2 miles in advance of the army.

When taking position in the rear of Vicksburg, Lieutenants Sample, Sherfy, and White performed important duties for the general commanding.

As soon as the troops were in position, Captain Rose and others n from headquarters Thirteenth and SEVENTEENTH Army Corps to General Grant's headquarters, which line remained in operation for some time, and over it many communications of importance passed.

The line from Chickasaw Bluffs to Young's Point, established by Captain McClintock and Lieutenant Magner, was of the first importance, as the only available means of communication between General Grant and Admiral Porter.

A line was partially opened from General Grant's headquarters to Haynes' Bluff by Lieutenant Gryden and others, but the removal off the forces from the latter point caused this to be abandoned before its completion. Desiring to improve the communication between headquarters and the station at Chickasaw Bluffs, Lieutenant Sample, upon a reconnaissance for that purpose, found it expedient to make important alterations in the whole line, and communication was opened by him to Hayne's Bluff through stations Nos. 27, 28, and 31, on the accompanying map. *
