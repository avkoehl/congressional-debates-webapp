The order for the impressment of labor, fixing ration, &amp;c., should come from department headquarters. I will require an experienced engineer

to locate the work at Chapman's Fort on Ashepoo River, and 200 negroes to complete the two works within the next four or five weeks. The immediate attention of the major-general commanding is respectfully called to this subject.

I am, major, respectfully, your obedient servant,

Lieutenant YOUNG,

Engineer:

Remember, I am greatly in want of baskets and gabions. The barges failed last night; the excuse given was the weather, which was no obstacle at all. I think they should be reported; it was neither rough nor blowing, and the rain was not hard. Send the plank, but not the heavy timber.

J. JONES,

Captain.
