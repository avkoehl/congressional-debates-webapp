Indian Hostilities—Mr. Bell.
H. of Reps.
riment we are making m government    Violations of the prm
eiples and maxims which, I maintain, ale entitled to be held m
the first rank of importance in a Republican Government, *ra
becoming so common as no longer to excite public attention
But, sir, if our institutions stand, the attention of the people
must be roused to the point of resentment and  collection
One of the abuses, and the greatest of all, m ray opinion, that
prevails in the practice of the Government, though I know it
does not so strike many of those whom I now address, is the as
sumption on the part of the Executive of the right to convert
all the public offices and employments under the Constitution
and laws into the wages of paiusan servive    The piactice of
nutting men into places of high and important trusts, rather
that the offices may afford them the means ot malting their for
tunea, than with any view to the public mterest, the practice
of removing or dispensing with faithful public officers merely
because they will not consent to sacuflce their political mte
gnty and independence of character—this I consider the fyun
dation of all the abuses that have of late prevailed in the van
ous branches of the public service    It was  the principle that
lay at the bottom of this piactice—I mean the pimciple of t on
verting every thing that partakes of the chaiactei of Executn e
patronage into productive political capital—that was the prime
eause ofthe derangement of the currency, and all the accumu
lated evils which flowed fiom that source    Sn, all the world,
I mean this little world of ours, the  people of the United
States, appear now to be exclusively absorbed and occu
Eled with this question of the currency The great, and, it
i eafd,only issue which is now pending between the two great
political parties in the country is abank,or theSub Treasury or
No Bank However important that issue may be, Mi Chair
aian, I beg leave to express the opinion that it is still a suboi
dlnate issue It possesses only a fleeting and temporary im
portance when contrasted with the real issue formed between
the party in power and the Opposition feir, there is a prior
issue, and one ot far greater impoitance Whatever may be
the decision at this time upon the question of a Bank, or ofthe
Sub Treasury, whatever may be the character of the plan for
the future management of the finances of the country, or for
the regulation of the currency, which maybe adopted by this
Congress or the next, tin1 whole subject is connected with inte
rests so active and powerful, so vital to the pursuits of trade
ana accumulation, that nothing we may do will stand longer
than a few years, if it shall not be found expedient andadvan
tageous to those interests, unless, indeed, the adoption of the
Sub-Treasury shall so increase the already swollen tide of
Executive influence and power as to bear down and quite over
whelm all obstructions Sn, I repeat, that the true issue is,
whether all political power and control in this country are to
be concentered m butene department 01 the Government And
I cannot cease to remember, and to uige upon the attention of
the people, that the man who now enjo>s the highest honor,
and fills the highest stauon un lei the Constitution and laws,
was the first, of any high pretensions to character and mflu
ence, who openly avowed andmcuicatedthe fatal doctrine that
public offices and employments arethepi©per objects of poli
tical strife, and the just rewards of party seivice His rone
spondencewith President Monroe, in 1823, upon the subject of
the appointment of a postmaster at Albany will confirm alii
say upon this subject There, too it will be found that he was
the first to desire to taint the Post Office Department with this
foul blot, and to insist that the power of appointment in that, as
in all the other branches of the public seivice, should be exer
Clsed with a view to political tnd party íesiilts
My colleague has quoted anothei part ofthe speech at Hart
ford, in which I am represented as having stated that I knew
members of Congress wno had sat in this House and voted for
the Administration under a piomise of office, and as a reward
therefor And my colleague thought pioper to state that he
could see no difference Setweui a member who would sit by,
having such a knowledge, and not disclose it, and a member
■who would thus sell himself to the party m power Sir, I am
sure that I could not have used the language imputed to me in
thisinstance I would not have used such language without a
personal knowledge ofthe fact slated, and that is one which
rarely or scarcely ever admits of such knowledge
[Mr TnitNEvr here said that the statement was, "that mem t
bers were known" to have so arted ]
That would still be too stiong a mode of expiession to ron vey
my meaning I must have in ended to say that membra of
this House were understood oi believed to have voted foi ihe
Administration, fiom day to day, and month to month, undei a
promise of office, that then objects were so apparent as to
cause them to be pointed at, and that they actually received of
lice afterwards Such must have been the substance of what I
etated in the speech refened to, and I could appeal to many
gentlemen upon this floor for the ti uth of the t harge I did not
refer to members of the present Congies« for theiehadbeonno
such test furnished of their motives oi objects But during the
late Congress, especially, and the preceding one, I now reaffhm
that there were several s rikme instances ofthe kind—instances
m which the course of certain members was marked, and ¡e
marked upon—instances m which uwa« «¡aid among many of
the a re observant members ofthe Opposition, when speaking
of some particulai membei, ' theie is a man who has got his
assurances," and in due time will be tianslated from this House,
and in every instance of this kind, which fell under my notice,
except one, these suspicions weiedul) confirmed, and the ho
notable nwraber placed in a haven of lest secure from the
«tornwandstrife ot Congressionalseivice lean slate for the
information of my colleague, a still stronger ca«e of the won
derful fulfilment of a prophecy m oui day In making certain
party arrangements, the conduct of one gentleman was so re
rnariable, that another predicted, at the tnr , that he had made
his bargain, that in due time he would expect to be placed in
one of the highest statiom under the Governme it, ant. the sta
tion was named Those to whom the remaik was made were
incredulous to the existence of such profligacy, but, behold,
after the lapse of a decent interval of time ihe prophecy was
miraculously fulfilled to tnc letter? But my colleague thinks
that, m such a case, I ought to have given information to the
House, Ot to the late committee ot investigation, ana to have
named the mdividmls This would not only be a very mvidi
ous task, but it might also be productive of gie t injustice to
the individuals suspected The cucum-tances upon which
conclusions are drawn against the motive rf members in this
Kapict, are often of such a nature as to make u it ntt e impi ■<,
SHB1 spill the careless observer, and pi ove sonretimss deceptive
to the mw watchful In eraicely any case ofthe kind could
positive evidence lie adduced 1 is, generally, only after the
«onwmmation of the arrangement, by the acceptance el office,
36
1
that suspicion beoomesbtubborn fact, and then there is seldom
any adequate inducement to pioseeute an inquiry m this House
That the frequent appointment of members of Congi ess is a
great abuse rtiid to show he true r ature and consequences oí
such a practice, I will read, for the edification of my colleague,
an authority whiGri I know he wni respect I allude to the
celebrated le'ter of the late President to the Tennessee Legisla
ture, in which aftei stiongly recommending an amendment of
the Constitution prohibiting the appointment of members oí
Congiesa to office, he diavys the following picture ofthe cont>e-
quence&of a continuance of so dangerousa practice
"But if this change in the Constitution should not be obtain-
ed, and important appointments continue to devolve on the re-
piesentatives in Congress, it requires no depth of thought to be
convinced tbat corruption will be the outer ofthe day, and
that undn the garb of conscientious sacrifice, to establish pre
cedents for the public good, evils oí serious impoitance to the
freedom and prospu ity ofthe Rt-pubhe may arise It is through
this channel that the people may expect to be attacked m their
constitutional soveieignty, and where tyianny may be well ap
prehended to spring up m some favorable emeigency "
Yet, m the faceofthis solemn denunciation ofthe corrupt
and fatal consequences of appointing members of Congress to
office, General Jackson appointed between forty andfify mem
bers of Consresa to office during his single Administration"!
A greater numbei,I believe than was appointed by all pre
ceding administrations' If I am not mistaken, there have been
nearly, if nof quite, sixty appointments of members of Con-
gress to office since the dominant paity came into powes^for,
en, this practice has not ceased since the present incumbent of
the white house as&umed the control of public affairs Have
we not lately seen one ofthe members of this Hou«e suddenly
taken from among us and transferred to a distinguished station,
under circumstances, when considered m connection with cer-
tain official changes and arrangements which grew out of it,
which stamp itone ofthe grossest and most scandalous trans
actions ofthe kind ever perpetrated in the face of any public? I
regarded these official arrangements at the time as an offence
against public decency, and if they can be íenewed at pleasure,
without exciting the indignation ofthe country, I shall consider
that there is no hope lemaining for the preservation of this Go
vernment m any tolerable punty So open, so shameless a de
fiance of all sense of shame and decency was never attempted,
even m the days of Walpole, palpable and monstrous as weie
the con upturns of his administration let, sir, I would not
be thought ldiberal upon this subject I know the apology that
is made lor Gen Jackson's violation of his own avowed prm
eiples upon this subject, and I think that, since there was no
amendment of the Constitution, he might be excused for ap
pointing a few members of Congress to office It often hap
pens that the ablest men, and those best qualified to promote
the public seivice in paitioulai branches ol it, are members of
Congress But sir this cn.n bf no justifirition of the abu<=e of
this pnvi'ege which hx^. beea rraetised of late l*?oi, when I
speak ol the acceptance of office by membeis after a term of
unscrupulous pai j seivice heit, do I mean to s=ay that all who
accept office are of this class Ihav too high arespeetfor the
geneialvhaiacter of the House, I have too high an e&timat ot
human nature to make such a charge On the contrary, mem
bers of both Houses of Congress, without doubt, ate sometimes
brought to accept particulai employments, orto take charge of
particulai departments of the public service, contrary to their
own wishes, o" because they belie vp they can thereby lender
important service to then countiy or their party To maintain
the chaiacter of this House especially, and to pieserve the con
fidence of the people in its general integrity and respecta
bihty, I ipgaid as one of the first duties of a patriot and
¡statesman m this country If any thing I have said here
or elsewhere may be thought to have a contrary beanng—
if at any time I am supposed to have spoken in disparage-
ment of it, let it be borne m mind tint, to insure the public
respect, it is necessaiy to point out and if possible, to reme
dy iropeilections which would soon destioy its authority
and lespectabihtv And I also ask gentlemen to íemember who
commenced thi  war upon the character oi this House and of the
reptesentativebof the people W ho are they who for ycais, in
the official oigan of the Admimstiat on, in the public journal",
generally, in its mte est, and sometime* in this House, have
held them up as unfaithful and unworthy of any great public
trust? that they were Bank bought, and that the Executive
alone < ould be relied upon to maintain the lights and interests
ofthe people! Sir, in the whole histoiy of party warfare, there
is nor, in my opinion, a parallel to be found foi the system of
unqualified abuse and detiaction which was for years pursued
by the pies  in the service ofthe \d ministration, against the
charactLi, u.o ive and conduct of the lepitisentatives of the
people in this Hou^e But, sir, tK moment a majority was «e
cmed m both Houses, who favored the views ofthe Executive,
the tone ofthe partisans of power is suddenly changed, the ae
nate and House are li led wi h true pitn *f, worthy ofthe high
trust with whir tin1 r e pie i iv <' >'hH M W A"T)tlsnow

high oifencb to impugn the mulivthttnd conduct of the Senate or

JJut mv colleague says that if I had any knowledge of «inch
impropei audconupt conduc* on the parto) membeis  of Con-
gtess as I alleged m my spppch at Hartford, I was bound to
have disclosed it to the committee of investigation, when called
as a witness bef^e it My colleague, m another pan ofhi& re
maiks, took the same ground m lelati n to the fiauds alleged to
exist m th execution ofthe Creek treaty ofl833, and nt, m bo'h
cases strongly insinuated that, eithei way, 1 had been guilty of a

If I had rn knowledge of a coiiupt motive m the appointment
of members of Congre^, or o! actual frauds in the execution ot

such knowledge Í ought to have made the disclosure befoie the
committee of investigation, when I was sworn to ..eil the whole
truth, in rela'ion to any abu es 01 corruption ofthe Admmistia
tion, within my knowledge (b >

My colleague, in connecíion with £hie part of the sufyeet
stated that I had not, after all, pointed out the existence of any
fraud m the execution of the Creek treify committed by (ht
Government agents My charge was, íhítt the fraudscommitted
on the Creek nation were the result either ofthe incompetency
or bad faith ofthe agents ofthe Governmeni, and that the Ex
ecutive was responsible for having committed such[important
duties to such improper hands, and as to the question whether
any fraud  had been actually committed, I read from tb6 com-
munication of one of the agents concerned in the execution of the
treaty to the Secretary ofWar^ stating that he liad good reason
to believe that nineteen out of twenty of ail the contracts certified
by himself for ¿he jsale and transfer of Indian titles were fraudu-
lent' Stionger proof of thetruthof a charge T do not think can
be adduced If the agenthad been both competent and faithful,
frauds to such an extent wonld certainly never have been per-
petrated, especially when we remember that it was the express
du ty of the agent to see thai the Indians were not cheated
Now, sir, f will answer the charge of dereliction of duty fee
fore the committee of investigation It is true thatl was sum
moned befoí that committee—a committee packed, and com
posed of i majority of thorough paced partisans of power—to
make good ail the charges of abuse and corruption wiich I had
ever in debate in tkis House alleged to exist in the administra
tion o 'ie Government And I was summoned to do this by
the coi nittee at the express suggestion, or, rather, dictation of
the Pi evident of the United States Yes, s>ir, the President of
the United States, in effect, ordered me to be summoned to give
the sa aiun of my oath to all the charges I had ever made
again his Administration on this flooi, under penalty, upon
failu t thereof, to stand before the Ar&encan people "a con
victe 1 calumniator " A grossei violation of the essential and
fun Umental privileges of this House never was perpetrated,
and yet the House stood by a passive observer, and tuuk no oi
der upon the eubject If th** true spirit of constitutional liber
ty had pervaded this House at that time, if that watchful
jealousy of every approach of arbitrary power, so necessary
to guard the public liberty had then any abiding place here,
such a proceeding would never have uanspired in this
Capitol
Sir, the majority, the supporters of the paity m power, slept
over their own v olated rights, and the rights oí ali ihe people
of this country, when they permitted a member of tins House,
for words spoken in debate, to be subjected to such an inquisi
tion by order of the President Why I waived my privilege
upon that occasion, how far I did so, foi w hat reasons I though 
proper to answei upon oath before that committee, the manner
in which I was interrogated, the pro est whi ,h I submitted
will show more fully and satisfactorily than any ih ng further I
can say now, and I beg heie indulgence ofthe committee to
have it read
[The Clerk of the House read th   protest filed with the evi
dénce given by Mr Bell on oath before the committer ofmves
tigatwnm 1837 j
Mi BfiLL resumed and said To show my colleague that the
Cieek frauds did not escape my notice in the evidence I gave
befoie the committee, I beg leave to read that part of H
which relates to this subject, and I think my colleague wih
rind that he has fallen into an eiroi msuppo m that I had
failed to dibdose what I knew of that bianc'i of tho abuses o
the Government
[Here Mr Bell read that part of t* e te0turn ny given be
fore the committee of investigation which le'ate^ to frauds m
the Creek nation }
Mr Bell resumed and ¡said I tiust my colleague is now
fully satisfied upon this point
My colleague next read another passage fiom the speech de
livered befoie a pouioh of my constituents, at Nashville, m
1833, in winch I stated that I had nevei failed in showing apro
per respect foi General Jackson, and that I had faithfully sup
poitedhis \dministration, "an i m every instance with that
degree of seal which could consistently and re it.onably be ex
pected "
My colleague refeis to this declaration of mine m 1835, as a
proofof insincerity on my pait^and to show that my conduct
since that time has been at variance w ith my professions My
colleague also has asserted that I have changed my principles—
asks what new lights have flashed upon me—complains, not
that I have changed, but that I should abuse my old political as
sociales, whoie principle  I have deserted, and he could assign
no other than a corrupt motive foi the change of my politics It
may surpu^eothei gentlemen as well as my colleague to hear
that, up to this day, Í have never failed in pergonal respeet to
Gen Jackson There aie sonv me nbeit  of this Hou&t who tan
never discriminate between peisonal abuse oi invective dud the
fair and proper use of that essential pnvilege in a fre  country—
the privilege of indulging in fiee and open discusión, and m
severe and pointed denunciation of public chiractei and con
duct While I have often spoken of General Jackson & puohc
conduct in sui h teims as I thought they merited, I repeat thatl
have never said a word which vs. as intended to be oi can be pi o
perly considered, personally offensive to h*n In &psaking ol
his public life and conduct I have forborne many expiession*
which a parliamentary license might ¡U'tiJ) Foi example, I
have never said that Geneial Jackson was a usutper, a tyrant,
a despot, or a dictator though I belicvche his aesu ned powers
not venter! in h«m by the Constitution and laws-, and that he ha,*,
m many instances, acted in a mannei arbmai}, despotic, and
coi i uptions,or usurpations, and, in answei tl ereto, fully ac
guitiedf not only the executive himself, but all the heat's of De
