SPEECH OF MR. CUSHING,
Of Massachusetts.
In the House of Representatives, September 25, 1837—
On the Message of the President oí the United
States, at the opening of the Twenty-fiAh Con-
gress
The House being in Committee of the Whole,
and having under consideration the state of the
Union generally, and particularly the bill from the
Senate postponing the fourth instalment of the
surplus revenue to be deposited with the States—
Mr. CUSHING addressed the committee sub-
stantially as follows
Mr Ch°i'man I am not prepared to vote for
this bill Various reasons for opposing it have
been adduced by difTeient gentlemen, m many of
whose arguments I concur I have another rea-
son, particular to myself
The clauses of the deposite act, which appertain
to the present question, seem to me to possess all
the features of a contract It provides that the
whole surplus revenue of the United States, beyond
a certain sum which may be in the Treasury on a
certain day, shall be deposited with the several
States, which deposite the States ara to keep sately,
and to pay back to the United States, whenever the
■same shall be called for by the Secretary of the
Treasury in a prescribed time and mode, and on
the happening of a giv en contingency Here, it
seems to me, is a contract t  honor, and, so far as
there can be a contract between the United States
and the several States, a contract in law, there be-
ing reciprocal engagements, for a valuable consi-
deration on both sides It is, at any rate, a quasi-
contract They, who impugn this view of the
question, argue on the supposition that the act,
performed or to be performed, by the United
Slates, is an inchoate gift of monej to the States
Not so It is a contract of deposite, and that coa-
tract is consummated and made perfect on the
formal reception of any ms'alment of the deposite
by the States.
How, entertaining this view of the transaction,
I am asked by the Administration to come forward
and break this contract True—a contract made
by the Government of the United Stales can not be
enforced m law Does that make it either honest
or honorable for the United States to take advan-
tage ot its power, and violate its pledged faith ' I
refuse to participate in any such breach of faith
But further The Admmibtration solicits Con-
gres  to step in between the United States and the
States as a tolunleer, and to violate a contract, as
the means of helping the Administration out of
difhculues, into which its own madness and folly
have wilfully sunk it, and which press equally
upon the Government and the people The object
ot the measure is to relieve the Secretary of the
Treasury from the responsibility of acting in this
matter, as he has the power to do Let him act
I will not go out of my way to interpose m this
between the Executive aad the several States, until
the Administration appeals to me in the right
spirit This it has not done The Executive
comes to us with a new doctrine, which is echoed
by his friends in this House, namely, that the
American Government is not to exert itself for the
rehtf of the American people Very well If this
be your policv, I, as representing the people, will
not exert myself for the relief of your Adminis-
tration
Let me re-state the question The doctrine of
the Executive is, m short, that, m their mutual
relations towards eaeh other, all the Government
his to do is to be supported by the people, and all
tie people have to do is to support the Govern-
ment Now I say that, under such circumstances,
for an Administration professing such tenets, I
will do just that which mj public ditty to the country
require , and no more I will, if the public neces-
sities require it, vote fonts Treasury note bill, that
is, grant it a loan, not for the sake ot the Adminis-
tration, but for the &ake of the public creditors, to
whom the money is or will be due, and of the
Government as such, which must not be allowed
to suffer, whatevei may be the faults of the Ad-
ministration. But I will not, as a member of
Congress, volunteer to take on my own shoulders
the responsibility of revoking or withholding the
surplus revenue from the States, in order lo lighten
the burden of responsibility, which the existing
law imposes on the Secretary of the Treasury Let
him untangle his own snarl I will not raise a
finger to do it The Administration has got itself
and the people mto these desperate straits It now
proposes to cut loose '"rom the people, and aban-
don them to their fate, but ask of us, the House
of the people, to take upon us the propitiation for
its sins , and to do this, by the violation of a con-
tract between the Federal Government and the
States    I will not do it
Sir, I submit these-brief remarks, on this partic-
uhr bill, by way of preface to the more extended
line ot argument, which I am about to puisue
This debate, like others in Committee of the
Whole on the stale of the Union, has been rather
unequal m character Some gentlemen have con-
fined themselves to the bill, others have taken a
wider range The course of the Committee of
Ways and Means, who íeported the bill, has been
worthy of note They have introduced into this
H iuse a series of remarkable measures, deeply
affecting f>e public interest, but they have sub-
mitted no leport, or other formal exposition of the
subject They leave no hing on the record justifi-
catory of the measures they propose I understand
this I see the art of it Their argument is the
general system of the administration in the present
contingency, as unfolded by the Piesident m his
Message That committee came here with the ad-
vantage of a case made out for them by the Pres -
dent of the United States Their case has not been
fullv. met by the opposition So far as, regirds the
general policy of the administratirn, of which this
is a part, a lmk in the chain, it has not yet been
argued in detail    This 1 mean to attempt
Intimations hav e been thrown out concern ng
the nee essities of ihe Government, as a reasonici
hunymg on this bill IrepK, that this bill does
not give money to the Government Not a dollar
If the Government is in urgent want of money, let
the chairman of the Committee of Ways and
Means bring forward his loan bill, and have it
passed It is not my fault that he keeps this bill
m advance of the others And if he does, he
must bear the responsib lity of the consequences
We came here, expecting to be gagged in the
Hous' , and, for aught I know, to be gouged under
the gag, but, in Committee of the Whole on the
Union, we will not be chol ed off, by anv cuch
management, from discussing the state of the
Union
It wa  the original usage lo reply to the commu-
nication of the President at the opening of Con-
gress That course has been discontinued, and
the consequence is, that political discussion can
take place only in connection with bills or íesolu-
tions in themselves of limited scope But there is
no want of pertinency m such discussions here
The Message is confined to one subject That
subject is the party point, and at the same time the
business-point, of all the existing agitation of the
country And I propose, on this occasion, lo en-
ter into a full examination of the Message
The President himself invites thus He sajs
that the subject " deserves a full and fair exami-
nation, and can not fail to be benefited by a dispas-
sionate companson of opinions " In undertaking
this, I design to discuss the Messags fairly, as a
mere State paper, and in the spuit of proper íe-
spect and courtesy due to the Chief M igistrate
It is a well digested, carefully written, aigumenta-
tive document, promulgating and advocating certain
opinions The other side should be heard, and
this can be done only by subjecting the Message to
senium, and discus^ng it direct!} , as well mas
out of Congress
COVVOC1TI0N   OF  CONGREoS
Mr Chairman this is an extraordinary session
of Congress We are called here by the procla-
mation of the President, nduced b\ great and
weighty considerations Naj, he deems the cir-
cumstances of the time so remarkable, that, in the
Message he recommends, I will notsav commands,
Congress to attend to nothing else. He withholds
from us information as to all other departments of
the public business What are these " considera-
tions," as developed in the Message?   They are,
1    The alleged inability of ihe Executive to car-
ry into effect the provisions of the deposite act, so
far as respects the public deposites, in consequence
of the suspension of cash pa\ ments by the banks.
2    The apprehension of a diminished or defi-
cient revenue, and consequent embarrassment of
the Treasure
3   The question of the time of forbearance to be
conceded to the debtors of the Government
4   The liability of Government to encounter
difficulties in the pajment of the fourth instalment
of the suiplus revenue engaged to the States
Th°se are, in substance, tie spec al inducements
assigned for the convocition of Congress The
public distress of the country is not stated as one
of then The President does indted, barely hint
at this, in saying that he vv as desirous to enable us
to exercise our "full constitutional powers for the
relief of the cnunfay " Wherein does the country
need relief? This we are not told We are in-
structed as to the difficulties of the Government
We are not instructed as to the prostration of the
activ e business of the country, the bankruptcy of
its mcrchints, the embarrassments of its bank',
the cessation of manufactures, the stagnation of
trade, the fall of our staples, the universal dis-
tress and alarm which pervade the commercial in-
terests of the whole Union The difficulties of the
country and of the people are not so much as the
subject of a suggestion The Government is lo be
talwn care of, as if it were a foreign conqueror,
revelling at free quarters in the heait of a van-
quished nation, but nothing, absolutely nothing, is
to be done for the general relief of the people
The Executive cinnot find specie-pavmg banks
to receive the p ibhc deposites Well, could he
from Mar to September, four months' If he could
regulate Ihe dpposites for that time, why not three
mon hs longei, until December' Especially if
there is no revenue Especially, if Congress is to
do, what the President recommends, leave the
whole public treasure in the very hands of the
ExccuíH c
A deficit m the Tieasurj? Very well What
is the remedy'! Draw on the surplus revenue' It
is all subject b> law to the call of the Secretary
Issue Tre"suiv drafts' The Execu'ive has done
it already, without the aid of Congress.
Forbearance to the public debtors' If the
Execu'ive could extend their obligations, first to
"September, and then to October, it can do so until
Dec mbei
Specie paymei 's' The Message does not re-
commend any thing for the public relief, in th s
respect, either of the country or of the banks un-
less it be a sp-eial bankrupt law for the demolition
of corporations, a measure not of relief, but of ad-
ditional distress
Thus, comparing the alleged inducements with
the remedies propos d, there would seeem to be
little reason for an extra session of Congress
We might as well be at home The difficulties
propounded to us are Executive difficulties, for the
Executive to worry along with the ordinary draw-
backs on the enioym°nt of place and power Is it
not paltering with Coneress to teU us only of the
difficulties of the Executive' Is it not a mockery
of the sufferings of the people' I sa\, either Con-
gress si ould not have been convoked, or, if con-
voked, scmethm" should have been proposed for
th<- substantial relief of the country, rather than
exclusively of the Government
Sir, the seciet the true secret of the extra session
of Conaress, is, m my judgment the bankrupt con-
dition of the Treasurv But this, the Administra-
tion, which has lauded itself so extravagantly on
the discharge of the national debt, this the Adrm-
nistrat on shrink fiom looking frankly in the face,
and avowing ti the people According!}, what
do we now see' Whv, we are daily goaded into
the hum m  foiw ard of this b 11, by the allegation
that the Treas uy is emptj Yet the Adm nistra-
tion instead of manrully meeting the contingency,
bv aslmg fot a loan, asks us to pass a Treasury
Note Bill What are thesf ten millions < f Treasury
notes i Nothing more or less, in plain English,
than a vtTiov*r dfbt, a Government loan, and, if
tssued without interest, a Government loanm that
worst possible form—old Continental paper money
