I have also the name of each conscript for whom money has been paid, and in order to complete this arduous and important work I requested and promptly received an order from department headquarters to commanders of colored troops requiring them to make such returns of conscripts serving in their commands as would enable me to secure such payments as have not been made, as well as to forward such as I have in my possession.

DISTRIBUTION OF PAY ROLLS--MEANS OF SECURING FINAL PAYMENTS.

I have prepared and distributed 4,000 pay rolls for plantations, by which I shall know when duplicates are returned as required by a circular which I issued, approved by you, that every laborer in the department is properly and fairly paid. I think we shall be able to conclude the year with a brighter record as to the treatment of the freedmen than their most sanguine friends could reasonably expect. Considering the depression of the money market and the utter ruin of the crops, this result is marvelous. Men have also expressed their surprise that the laborers are generally paid for their services, adding that they expected not more than one half of them could possibly be paid. It is doubtful whether during many years to come the freedmen of this department will have secured such general protection as they have during the past year. It is not probable that after clothing and finding themselves out of their earnings next year they will have as much clear cash in hand as they have at this time. To escape the payment of the laborers, with the orders issued for the freedmen, and the manner in which we have executed them, is regarded by every planter and every merchant as an absolute impossibility. To secure equal completeness on the laborer's side of the contract, together with a suitable recognition and treatment of their freedom, will crown our efforts in this line with success.

REGISTRY OF FREEDMEN.

I have completed a registry of all the laborers on the plantations, which is arranged in alphabetical order, excepting the small plantations where French creole owners could not make out returns. By means of this I am able to tell where any laborer is employed. This registry also embraces the names, age, sex, wages, former owner, and residence of each one. To complete this arm of my work I have had to use much patient exertion, and the result has rewarded us double.
