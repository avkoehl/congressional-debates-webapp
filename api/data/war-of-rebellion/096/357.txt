report by letter to the Adjutant-General of the Army? General Max Weber and General Sullivan are both at Hagerstown, off duty. I have some splendid young officers who could well fill these places.

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS MIDDLE MILITARY DIVISION, February 2, 1865.

Brigadier-General DEVIN,Commanding Cavalry, Lovettsville:

You must always keep yourself well informed by scouting parties well out. Let these scouting parties burn all forage sought of the Leesburg and Snickersville pike, but the most rigid discipline must be exercised to prevent wantonness or bad conduct toward women and children. No dwelling will be burned at present, bur if the guerrilla warfare is to be maintained in that section of the country, it must be desolated, as the country is from Alexandria to Brandy Station; but I will give the order when the time comes. Those who aid and abet robbers and murderers must go back to the Richmond authorities as the authors of their hardships and sufferings. The Confederate authorities sustain these bands and approve their infamous acts of murder and robbery.

P. H. SHERIDAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS MIDDLE MILITARY DIVISION, February 2, 1865.

Major-General CROOK,Commanding Department of West Virginia:

When I suggested that an infantry regiment should be sent to New Creek, it was for the purpose of garrisoning that place and relieving the cavalry regiment now there form all garrison duty, so that if it should be necessary to have a movable force, you could use the whole of the cavalry regiment, and the regiment of infantry could protect the post and the cavalry camp, wagons, &amp;c.; as it is now a portion of your cavalry has to remain at New Creek to protect that place and their camps.

P. H. SHERIDAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
