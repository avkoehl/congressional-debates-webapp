Captain ENO,

Saint Louis:

Thank you for full information by telegraph. Try to keep me posted. The enemy has burned railroad bridges and taken Independence, my picket leaving that place yesterday. It is occupied by rebels in force. I hold Kansas City, Hickman Mills, and the border. My army is closing up to confront the rebels, and to pursue, as best I can, whatever comes. Am anxious to hear of Colonel Harding and Major Curtis, who went down with troops on steam-boats last Friday.

S. R. CURTIS,

8. Colonel B. Gratz Brown having been relieved, at his own request, of the command of the City Guards of Saint Louis, Colonel Charles A. Fritz, First Regiment, is assigned to command of all troops of that organization. These troops are to be called upon to do duty only within the defenses of Saint Louis and only on occasions of emergency. But the general commanding regards it as important that the organization should be kept alive under such orders prescribed by Colonel Fritz as will not exact duty or attendance unnecessary to the preservation of the organization, or the performance of the service for which it was formed. Colonel Fritz will furnish such details to the mayor of the city as may be required by him in the enforcement of the ordinances of the city. Major Fred. T. Ledergerber, Twelfth Missouri Infantry, is assigned to duty with Colonel Fritz as acting assistant adjutant-general.
