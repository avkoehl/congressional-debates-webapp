HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF WEST VIRGINIA,Cumberland, Md., March 23, 1864.

Colonel E. D. TOWNSEND, Asst. Adjt. General, Washington, D. C.:

COLONEL: I have the honor to request that Brigadier General Max. Weber, U. S. Volunteers, now, as is understood, in Washington, may be directed to report to me for assignment to duty in this department. Brigadier-General Weber is a meritorious officer, was wounded at Antietam, and is not now, as is believed, assigned to any command. In view of his efficient services and the limited number of general officers in this department, the interests of the service would probably be promoted by the assignment suggested. Such assignment would not interfere with any general officer now serving in this department.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

F. SIGEL,

Major-General.

CUMBERLAND, March 23, 1864.

Colonel MULLIGAN, New Creek:

Your telegram received. The general commanding deems your information important, but does not wish just now any extensive cavalry expedition undertaken. For the present he desires simply the country on your front and flank well scouted, and the cavalry prepared for future important movements.

By order:

T. MELVIN,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF WEST VIRGINIA,Cumberland, Md., March 23, 1864.

Captain WILL RUMSEY, Asst. Adjt. General, Cav. Div., Martinsburg:

CAPTAIN: Yours of yesterday, concerning name of General Averell's division, has been submitted to the major-general commanding, who, upon reconsideration, consents that the name be changed as desired. As regularly the name of a command is only changed by the authority creating it, an order will be issued with that view. Until then the name of Cavalry Division may be used.

I am, captain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

T. MELVIN,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HDQRS. CAVALRY DIV., DEPT. OF WEST VIRGINIA,Martinsburg, March 23, 1863.

WM. W. AVERELL,

Brigadier-General.

Scout in from Cacapon Springs. All quiet.
