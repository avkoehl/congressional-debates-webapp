WAR DEPARTMENT, May 1, 1862.

Major-General HALLECK, Pittsburg Landing, Tenn:

I am pressed by the Missouri members of Congress to give General Schofield independent command in Missouri. They insist that for want of this their local troubles gradually grow works. I have forborne so far, fear of interfering with and embarrassing your operations. Please answer, telling me whether anything, and what, I can do for them without injuriously interfering with you.

A. LINCOLN.

PITTSBURG LANDING, May 1, 1862.

To the PRESIDENT:

General Schofield has entire command of the Missouri Militia in the United States service, and of the volunteers in two-thirds of the State. He has been informed that his district will comprise the entire State as soon as Major-General Curtis moves south. This is more than his rank entitles him to. If he is intriguing for more he is not honest. I would rather resign than to have him given an independent command in my department. I have yielded much to the importunities of his friends, but their ask still more.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General.
