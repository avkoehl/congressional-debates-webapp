WINCHESTER, December 24, 1864.

I have no information from General Torbert. Custer has sent in his report of affair at Lacey's Springs, near Harrisonburg, between Chapman's brigade, of his division, and Payne's brigade, of Rosser's. He repulsed and drove them, and there was no necessity for his return except bad weather and total absence forage. Custer report his loss, 2 killed, 22 wounded, 20 prisoners. Enemy's loss, killed and wounded, 100, and 27 prisoners. The fight occurred before daylight. Custer had 230 of his men frost bitten on the expedition.

(Received 27th.)

I have the honor to transmit the following report, just received, from General Torbert:

DECEMBER 26 - 6 a. m.

I have the honor to report that on Thursday, the 22d, I reached the Rapidan at Liberty Mills, having driven Jackson's brigade of cavalry from Madison Court-House. At Liberty Mills Jackson made a junction with McCausland with two pieces of artillery. I drove them across the river, but they had the bridge mined and it blew up as my men got to it. It wa impossible to force a crossing in front, so I made a detour on both flanks of five or six miles, which turned them out of their position and we captured their artillery (tow pieces) and several prisoners. This move took till 8 or 9 o'clock at night. Next morning I pushed on toward Gordonsville and I found them strongly posted in the gap, and I could not drive them out with 2,000 men, and I was making a movement to turn the position when infantry commenced to file into their breast-works and I commenced to withdraw, and am now ten miles south of Warrenton, and may be on the Little River turnpike to-night. I will try to come through Ashby's Gap. My men and horse suffered almost beyond description with cold and bad weather. I captured one herd of cattle going south, about 200 head. I received your dispatches concerning Custer. I heard nothing of matters in the Valley before I got your dispatches, and expected more trouble in my rear, but thus far have not been troubled.

WINCHESTER, December 28, 1864.

(Received 12.35 p. m.)

General Torbert has just returned. In a more detailed report he says the great difficulty which he had was the could, bad weather, and ice on the roads. He brings in 2 pieces of artillery, captured at Liberty Mills, 30 prisoners, and 1,000 head of stock. He reports that infantry came from Richmond to Gordonsville; that Rodes' division was at Fishersville, between Staunton and Waynesborough, and did advance in the direction of Harrisonburg when Custer was in that vicinity. Other information which I have received is to the effect that Gordons' division, or a part of it, moved out in the direction of Wytheville, W. Va. This later information comes from rebel sources.
