Colonel G. E. SPENCER,

Decatur:

The general intends the Thirty-ninth Ohio to return to this place again. He so instructed Colonel Noyes last evening before starting. The general is quite sick. I know that he wished their camp and garrison equipage to remain here, and the regiment to return when it is ascertained beyond doubt that Decatur is in no danger of attack soon.
