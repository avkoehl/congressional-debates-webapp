General CLEBURNE:

General Johnston in anxious to know whether the enemy is still in your front, and whether the movement you thought was being made to your left last night was continued. Nothing heard from you since 10 o'clock last night.

Respectfully,

W. W. MACKALL,

Chief of Staff.

DALTON, May 9, 1864-9.45 a. m.

Major-General WHEELER:

General Johnston wishes you to send a body of cavalry toward Resaca to observe any movement that may be made by the enemy from that direction toward Dalton. Let them observe all gaps through which an enemy may pass across Rocky Face south of Dug Gap.

Respectfully,

W. W. MACKALL,

Brigadier-General and Chief of Staff.

MAY 9, 1864-10 p. m.

General MACKALL:

GENERAL: I have withdrawn Deas' brigade from the right and placed it in reserve between Cumming and Mercer, which I regard the weak point of my line. If Govan is not needed in the works on Cleveland road I wish you would order him to report to me, with his brigade, very early in the morning. The enemy were repulsed handsomely at every point they attacked on my line to-day. I have just seen Stevenson, who feels able to maintain his position on the mountain. Remember Govan's brigade.

Very truly,

W. J. HARDEE,

Lieutenant-General.
HEADQUARTERS CLEBURNE'S DIVISION,Dug Gap, Ga., May 9, 1864-daylight.

Brigadier General H. B. GRANBURY:

General Cleburne directs me to say that General Strahl has been taken from him and he is allowed no one to replace-him. He directs that you put the two Arkansas regiments on the line at once, and that General Lowrey will extend to the right, so as to fill Strahl's position.

Respectfully,

I. A. BUCK,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

Major-General WHEELER:

Your dispatch of 6.15 a. m. received. To make the entire circuit of the army would take too much time. If you can push on to the rear
