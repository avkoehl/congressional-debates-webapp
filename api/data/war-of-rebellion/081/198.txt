Major-General BUTLER, Commanding,&amp;c.:

If you can dispense with Wright direct him to join General Meade, with his command,so that the balance of the Eighteenth Corps can be returned to you. Before starting in this campaign I directed a siege train to be put afloat subject to my orders. I understood that it came to Fort Monroe some time since, and was under the impression that it came up here. Do you know anything about it? Colonel Abbot was in command.
