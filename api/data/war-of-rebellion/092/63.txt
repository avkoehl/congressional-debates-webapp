crossing the river above and getting to it by some of the numerous cross-roads. An enemy would not be likely to do this, unless he were in largely superior force, since he would necessarily put himself in a "pocket. "

Third. The defense of the river navigation: This is best accomplished by a force stationed at this city large enough to go out and fight any enemy that would be likely to approach. In order that our opponents might reach any of the points where they could injure us much, they would be compelled to thrust themselves some miles beyond us, leaving whatever garrison there might be in Savannah on their flank and in rear. They could not interrupt navigation without establishing themselves in inclosed works upon the bank of Saint Augustine Creek (we hold Fort Jackson), and a very short time would suffice for the capture of any enemy having temerity enough to do this. With all our great resources of water transportation I regard it impossible for our enemy to make a successful lodgment on Saint Augustine Creek.

I am, General, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

O. M. POE,

Captain, Engineers, Brevet Colonel, U. S. Army,

Chief Engineer Military Division of the Mississippi.

A map* is in course of preparation, under my direction, which will clearly show the topography of Savannah and vicinity, the works of attack and defense, the new lines constructed during our occupation of the city, and the lines of 1814.

All of which is respectfully submitted.
