ROCKVILLE, September 11, 1862.

Major-General HALLECK, General-in-Chief:

Colonel Miles is at or near Harper's Ferry, I understand, with 9,000 troops. He can do nothing where he is, and could be of great service if ordered to join me. I suggest that he be ordered at once to join me by the most practicable route.

There is no way for Colonel Miles to join you at present. His only chance is to defend his works till you can open communication with him. When you do so he will be subject to your orders.

General White has joined him with his command from Martinsburg. Miles is in possession of Harper's Ferry and Loudoun Heights. If he holds out to-day I can probably save him.
