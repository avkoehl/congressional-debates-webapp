MAY 16, 1863.

The work on the road has proceeded slowly from the damage done by the rebels; besides, Colonel Foster's troops have been engaged more or less for two days. The enemy has kept up a lively artillery fire on the track most of the time. Yesterday they advanced upon his position within canister range, not suspecting his amount of artillery, and were driven back with such loss. One of Davis' caissons is riddled with bullets; 1 horse killed, 9 slightly wounded. Our loss is very slight. Have deemed it best to press the work, making that the object rather than engaging the enemy at that distance. Colonel Foster has managed thus far with great judgment.

Respectfully referred to Headquarters Department of North Carolina.

Two gunboats from Captain Flusser's squadron will start in two hours for Roanoke and Currituck, using the North Shore as a tender. One hundred and fifty infantry will embark in the boats, to attempt the recapture or destruction of the Arrow and Emily. I am not in possession of the details.
