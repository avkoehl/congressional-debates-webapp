CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
showing such undisguised disrespect for the unanimous opi-
nion of those who brought him into power, that hie meaning
cannot be misunderstood Of this character is the appoiM-
ment of the marshal of Middle Tennessee, and the selection for
Government favor of the organ at Nashville, which ha , in all
possible ways, without the restraints of ordinary decency,
BOOgnt to vilify the Whigs of Tennessee
[The Speaker suggested that this was not strictly in or
der }
Then, sir, (continued Mr B) I ask pardon for this digres
swn. I only desired to say that the WIhes of Tennessee at
least should not be held responsible for the Executive or his Ca
binet But I must be permitted to say that the reference of the
honorable gentleman from New Yoik,[Mr BowNE]asa party
thrust, was unfortunate The items refened to were charged
at a dale prior to the 1th of March, and were the expendituies
ol Mr Forsyth What a prodigious mistake1 A Democrat has
thrown censure on a brother Democrat' But it was a/mistake
Sucha thing is never done knowingly Democracy can do no
wrong, is the maxim of Democracy
I have looked a little into Mr Forsyth's report of December,
1840, and 'American Scenery" and ' Canadian Scenery" are
there found to figure extensively His fondness for newspapeis
was also remarkable 1 have a list ol periodicals and newspa
persm my hand which he paid for out of the contingent fund
The number is twenty four A few items will show how the
"Treasury pap" has gone for political newspapers with a view
of sustaining partisan editors It w n also throw light on what
is meant by "contingent expenses," "miscellaneous expenses,"
and "incidental expenses," of which more hereafter There is
charged "five copies of the daily Glohe, 850 " "Twelve copies
of Globe containing convention with Mexico," "one hundrtd
copies of Globe containing letter relating to census " And then
comes the climax m the way of Globes ' Eighty one daily
Globesio publishers of laws from Januiry 27 to August 22,
1810, $161 13 " These are all charged to the Government un
der the head of contingent expenses It is probable that each
of the printers of the laws took the Globe, if they did not,
they should have done so But it was necessary to swell the
patronage, aheady immensely large, given by the Government
to the party organ The Secretary, thereloie, not on!) or
dered five daily Globes for himself, but also ordered 81 more
for his pet printers, and chvrged them all to the Government
Was this right! Would he have managed his own affairs m
this way
But it seems the Department was veiy unlortunate inlo-mg
papers offthe flies 11ns, item is also charged to the public
purse "Subscription to newspapers to complétenle?, £211 "
f will only notice one othet item out of many The item
stands thus 'I Leigh, subscription toTeuness.ee 1'atiiot, SI "
This paper lived and die I in the district I have the bonoi to re
present, and some of my constituent-, may be sin pnsed tiletrn
that it was deemed by the late Administration essential to the
public interest that it should be sent to Wasungt n anj , nd
for out of the Treasury of the nation It is, neveithelees, ccr
tamly so
Now. sir, allow me to íefer to a few other facts lllusti ative of
the bold game that has been played off under the name of "in
cidental expenses," "contingent expenses," "miscellaneous
expenses," &c In the report of expenses for 1838 as an ex
ample, are the following items 1 lie ' current expenses of the
Indian Department" are set down at $4,831 50 Under this
stand the following items "Miscellaneous obiects ' $4 09'! 27,
' miscellaneous and contingent charges" 8694,423 79' Now
a Id these lastsums together, and vou have sent down to conlm
zency the amount oí five hundred and ninety eight thousand
five hundred an I seventeen dollars and six cents growing out of
a department the ' current expenses" ol which fall short of five
thousand
It might in charity be inferred that this immense amount of
aontingeney had been used in lemovwg Indiams, or some
other important object, but this is lebuttedby the lact that a
string of expense^, amounting to between two and three hun
dred items, some of them very large, embracing every possible
case that the mind can imagine, is set down and charged These
astounding ltoms, therefore, stand unexplained and un expiara
able,                                                              .    ,
Sir, I will give you another example In the appropriation
bill ofl838 the following is found, which is only an example
taken from others of a similar kind • For mat d predotions
and special agents, twelve thousand dollars, foi clerks for
offices, one hundred and forty thousand dollars, for mtscclla
7ieou8,forty thousand dollars "
What do all these things mean? Here are "miscellaneous
objects," "miscellaneous and contingent charges " put down
in all possible ways,, until the Department, not wishing to put
down too much of the same trung charges the Government
with forty thousand dollars' worth of "miscellaneous'" I) a
plain man in the country had such a cbaige run at him, he
would start as though a pocket pistol had been snapped it him
Observe the item for clerks It is not told what clerk  No
sir, no This Utile item oí one hundred and forty thousand
dollars is Isujjpose, for clerks mamifactmed iu the manner
already shown withoutany authority of law
In 1833 the "contingent fund," as it is called, amounted to
one million eight hundred and forty thousand dollars Now,
sir, imagine the extent of corruption that mieht be produced
by such a fun 1 And is it wise to give unbridled license to our
public agents in the manaeementof such vast amounts Ought
they no'themselves to pray not to be led into such tcmiti
tion?"                                                      ,                        , .     ,

In these remarks my aim is not for party, but for my country
Reform—immediate, thorough, honest reform—is the desire of
my heart Those who are for this kind of reform I take by
the hand, without inquiring whether they call themselves
Whig, Democrat, or Tyler men And m this reform I de
siieto avoid extiemes on either side The oflicersof Govern-
ment should be paid a reasonable compensation, and held
to strict accountably They should especially be restrained,
as lar aspracticable, from the exercise of irresponsible dis
cretion
But there are those who talk for the people and to the peo
pie, and who never intended to be undone in piofessions, who
would, as I heard a venei able gentleman on this floor forcibly
express it "tear down the Capitol and hold Congress in a
camp " Stuch reformers are always dangerous to reform
Iheybringthewholdsubjectinto ridicule The true friends
of reform will ujquile what is reasonable ard whatls, right,
and in good faith carry it out The committee m this case
have examined the subject well, and their lecommendation
will receive my hearty support I go for the resolutions as
reponed, without alterationin any thing And to this I add
my hearty thanks for the service the committee have done the
country
Mr MATHIOTT said he had not intended to have engaged
m this debate, and it was not until he discovered that the gen
tlemen in the opposition gave this question a party character
that he had determined to occupy the time of the House on this
subject
He wouid endeavor, in the few remarks he might submit to
the House, to confine himself to the amendment of the gentle
man from New Yoik, [Mr  Gordon ] which was the pending
question    It appeared to lum strange "passing strange," that
this amendment had come from this quarter    What was the
cry of the party to which the gentleman belonged at the close
ot the administration of the venerable gentleman from Massa
chusetts,   [Mr Adams]— an administration   than which, he
would hazard the declaration that there had been no le puier
It was their cry then that the salaues of the oflkeis of this
Government 'had increased, were increasing and ought to be
diminished "   They then promised the American people le
tronchment and lefori i if they would elect them  to ofhee
That party, after having admmistcrtd the Government f n a
numbei of years was  thrust out of power    Another party
came into power with the same pui poses, and yet Oe very mo
ment the paity now in power undertook to rede™ the pled p«
made to the American people, they were met with or positnn
from gentlemen belonging to tha   paity, which in 1828 sun 
tho siren song of retienchment and reform    lie called on the
ffentleman fro n the Otscao district [Mr Bowse] ml fiom the
Driiw iedi tnct [Mr Gordon] of "Sew  loilt to come u) «id
aidthem in thswoik
During the extiases ion d committee was appointed on the
subjectof retienchment ol thecxpen ntures ot ihi-i' n«e ml
had made their leport, which bore on its face the impress of
cieat laboi and thorough examination, in which they came to
The conclusion that two clerks of this House ought to bo dis
jemed with, and could be without detument to the public sen
lhe report showed that, m 1826, during the admimslia-
tion of the gentleman lrom Massachusetts, the number ot as
sistant rltiks m this House amounted to six, and were au
thonzed by law and that by a resolution of the House of
the 6th March 1826, one additional clerk was allowed The
cry of the | arty to which the g-ntlemen from New York be-
lon  then was that the numbei of clerks was too large, tr at
officers were iocreasmg,had mcieased, and ought to be dm ,
mshed, and, place them in p wer, they should he dimisbel
This same party, on the 11th Octobei 1S37, introduced into this
House a íesolution for the employ of two additional clerks
Did they ston here? No During the last j ear of tho admi
mstration of Van Buren they found two additional clerks, with
salaries of $1,500 each, employed in tins House without lawor
resolution of the House                                                   t,       ,
This committee, then, after thoroughly investigating this sub
lect, came to the conclusion that ti ese two clerks ought to he
dispensed with, and could be without detriment to the public
service And yet the gentleman from New York-not in ac
rordance with the pledges of his party in IS28-offeied an
amendment to retain the services of these two cleiks without
theauthoilty of law or resolution He was opposed to this
principle He was ready to go for the re'olu ion which had
been reported by the committee, after thorough investigation,
because he stood pledged to the people of his distiict go ft,
