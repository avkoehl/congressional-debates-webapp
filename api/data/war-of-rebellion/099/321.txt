may select about Bamberg or Lowry's, to be parked. As soon as you reach the railroad set to work to destroy it effectually, viz, every rail must be twisted. Your advance should push out a mile or so beyond the railroad toward South Edisto, on the Cannon's Bridge road. If you hear Howard engaged lean toward Midway, but get the road broken anyhow. I will be with you, but want you to fight your own battles, as I am a non-combatant. The enemy ought to fight us, but I don't believe he will.

Yours, &amp;c.,

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.

P. S. --Have the left-hand road at the church clear for Williams by 8 a.m.
