Mr LINN said, on the suggestion pf the Senator from Alaba
ma, he had, a few weeks ago, moved to lay a bill of similar
character ou the table He had hoped that the general bill in
the House* covering al! these cases, would pass, but as there
was noprospect of that bill becoming a law, he moved to take
up the bill first alluded to    The motion was agreed to, and
The bill to continue m force the act for the final adjustment
of private land claims id Missouri, approved 9th July, 1832,
and the act supplementary thereto, approved the 2d March,
1833, was taken up as m committee of the whole, considered
reported to the Senate, and ordeted to be engrossed for a thud
reading
Mr. TAPPaN, as an act of chanty, if not of justice, made an
effort to have action on a bill for the benefit of an old soldier—
name not heard, but the motion did not prev ail, being opposed
by Messrs STURGEON and PHELPS, who were opposed to a
departure from the order of business on the calendar, and to
the exclusion of other cases eq ually meritorious
The bill for the relief of John C Reynolds, late disbursing
agent of the Indian department, was taken up as in commi lee
of the whole.
THE DIFFICULTIES IN RHODE ISLAND
Mr ALLEN desired that his resolution calling on the Presi
dentof the United States for information of the state of facts
touching the difficulties in Rhode Island, and on which he
founded his letter to the Governor of that -tate, should be taken
up and passed upon The information could be obtained from
the President, and without a word of debate If the Senate per
Bistedm refusing action on the resolution, he should feel bound
by a sense of duty to present the question in another form He
could not abandon the intention of calling out the information
Therefore, for the purpose of testing the sense of the Senate, he
moved to lay the bill (read above) on the table, for the purpose
of submitting a motion to take up the resolution
The question was put, and decided in the negative
The Senate then resumed, asm committee of the whole, the
consideration of the bill for the relief of Mr Reynolds
Mr LINN remarked that this was a question whether the
person for whose relief (he bill was, should have credit for
moneys of the United States which were stolen from him, and
not recovered Now, he did not mean to oppose the bill, but
he would call the attention of the Senate to us vote, rejecting*
a bill similar in character, which proposed to indemnify an
agent for some 0200, being the expense incurred in recovering
several thousand dollars which were stolen from him Hem
tendedtovote forthis hill,because he believed ltwasjust He
believed the other should have parsed It would show great
inconsistency in the action of the Senate, to pass a bill giving
an agent credit for the whole amount of moneys stolen, an!
not recovered, alter refusing to pay another agent $200
for expenses incurred in recovenng money stolen He mti
mated an intention of moving to amend this bi 1, so as to
make provision for the case alluded to, which was rejected,
but, after a few remarks by Messrs SEVIER, CLAYTON, and
KING, with a view to show that there was a shade of difference
in the two cases, the bill was reported to the fcenate, without
amendment, and ordered to be engrossed for a third reading
The bill for the relief of Charles M Keller was taken up as
in committee of the whole, considered, reported to the Senate,
and ordered to be engrossed for a third reading
THE GENERAL APPROPRIATION BILL
On motion of Mr EVAN , the Senate proceeded to the con
sideration (as in committee of the whole) of the bill making
appropriations for the civil and diplomatic expenses of the
Government for the year 1842 anil the ame idments of the Fi
nance Committee which were undisposed of
The next amendment was on 27th page, lines 635 and 636, to
strikeout "four thousand," and insert " eleven thousand two
hundred and fifteen "
Mr KING asked for some explanation on this point from the
chairman of the Finance Committee
Mr EVANS observed that the amend nent was to be con
sidered m connexion with the succeeding amendment, which
is to strike out the proviso Ihe piovisois 'That the com
missions of two and a half per cent (and any and all other
commissions) heretofore allowed to the supeimtendent oflight
houses, be discontinued in all cases where the compensation o(
thecollectoi, as such andas superintendent of light houses,
including fees, perquisites, official shares of fines, forfeiture:,,
and penalties, and commissions, and all emoluments of office
whatever, shall amount together to one thousand dol'arsor up
wards per annum, and the different collectors shall hereafter
discharge the duty ot superintendent as heretofore required,
without any additional oi specific compensation for the pet
formance thereof, except as above stated "
The committee had maturely weighed the whole matter, and
had come to the conclusion that this moviso oughtto be stricken
out, and the whole sum appropuatet be -estored m the pre
ceding provision of the section Mr E made some furthei
explanations, with which Mr KING expiessed him¡>elfsatis
fled, and the amendments were both adopted
The next amendment was, page 28 to strike out lines M>r>
and 666 hem  ''Por outfit of a Charge d'Affaires to the Republic
of New' Granada, foui thousand five hundred dollars," and in
seru ToroutrUsufChaigesd'Affaire-, to Sweden, Belgium and
New Granada and half outfit to a Ch.iged Affanesto Holland,
fifteen thousand five hundred and fifty dolíais "
Mr KING hoped the chairman of the T nance Committee
would explain the reason of this. piO| oscd change                         ,
Mr EVANS observed thit the amendment was the re<-u t ol
maunies which had been male at the Executive Department
to which the arrai zeiuent ol the fortisn minions properly be
]on"ed Thecomrmuee fi.lt assuied fiom thattr quiry, that the
nuhlir service of the Government i equited this an angement
Mr WRIGHT said he was well awaie thit the action of the
Senate upon this item of api lopriation had a v eiy intimate re
lation to is action in another capacity which it would not
be proper to discuss at present. And he propo-cd to te,t,
at once, the disposition to continue at the present time, and in
?he presen cord t.on of the Trea ury, this system of accumu
latin  the expenses of the Government He would move
herefore, to strike out -he word Sweden and his desistíi was if
tlusshou d prevail, to strike out certain otl er words f, lowing,
bo aS to leave only Belgium New Gianada and Holland so
that appropriations might he made only for those which they
knew to be vacant The amendment ifeted by the coram t
tee, proposed an approni.ation r  Swe len, a p'ace which they
knew to be full He (Mr Vvmr-HTi was opposed to the ex
change moposed, and for the pui[ ose of tenuis the question,
he made the motion to strike out -Sweden A' to the ca--e of
Holland, he had hcaid it said that the gentleman representing the
f United States in that country desired to be recalled, but he had
i no information upon that point, upon which he felt authorized to
act If the President thought proper to recall thatgentleman, he
, had no objection, but he was not willing to facilitate an ex
| change, and to vote half an ou fit f r that purpose, merely be
s cause it was desired by the gentleman who represents this coun
try at one of those places
e Mr EVANS desired to know if the object of the Senator
from New York was the saving of ihe half outfit As to the
propriety of making the trarsfer of the representative of the
United States from Sweden to Hoi and, he was not sure that
.this was the pioper place to enter in'o the consideration of that
'matter
Mr WRIGHT said he had noobjection that the prestntmm
ister at Swedtn bhould go to Holland, if the President saw fit to
recommend it, but he wis not disposed to pay haif an outfit
for the personal convenience of that gentleman
Mr LVANS thought the Senator would reach his object
more readily by simply moving to sjike out the half outfit to
Holland
Mr WRIGHT said no for that was evidence that there was
to be a vacancy in Holland
Mr HUNTINGTON supposed the caseof a repie&en'ation
heme made to the Senator by the Executive, tha thetiansfer
was demanded for tlie interests of the Government and asked,
would it not be improper to pronounce any decision mantici
pationi
Mr WRIGHT observed that, as the bill could not be got
through to day and the Senate would probably go intoexecu
tive session, where something more might be known on the
subject, he would withdiaw his motion, m view of renewing it,
if necessary, when the bill should be reported back
A few remarks were made on the subject by fllessrs SEVIER,
EVANS, WOODBURY, and MERRICK, which weie inter
rupted on a point of order, no question being before the Senate,
as the amendment was withdrawn
Mr WOODBURY insisted on his right to speak on the sub
ject of the original amendment What he objected to was this
increase of appropriation (&I5 5501 at a time that letrenchment
is so necessary as hid been admitted and avowed
Mr MERRICK explained his reason for having mteirupted
the Senator fiom New Hampshire
Mr EVANS stated that it was the usual practice to niakeap
propnations m advance
Ml HENDERSON wabof the same opinion
The amendment was ther adopted
Tile next amendment wa —paee 29, lines 072 and 673, to
strike out "twenty one thousand two hundred and forty toui
dollars and thirty three cents," and inseit "thirty thou and do!
lars," being the appropnation for contingent expenses of for
eign intercourse
Mr BUCHANAN asked some explanation
Mr EVANS explained that «30 000 was the usual sum ap
propnated    But the House of Representatives had fixed the
extraordinaiy sum of $21 244 "i¿ under a mistake   id conse
quence of a bal-inee of formtr appropriations being on hend,
amounting toS87C3 67 which it was conceived ought to be de.
ducted from the usual sum of $30 000, but it had been since
discovered that there were outstanding claims on the balance
in hand, which were called for
The amendment was adopted
The next amendment was— page 29, after line 678 insert,' For
contingent expenses of all the missions abioad, thirty thousand
dollars "
Mr LVANS explained the object of the amendment
It was adopted
f he next was—page 29 ltne 679, after "I ondon " insert "and
Pans," stnke out "two" and m-ert "four," being the appro 
priation (No 196) for salary of the consul at London two thou
sand dollars
Mr EVANS e\p'amed also the object of this amendment,
and submitted a letter from the ministers at Pans an I Berlin
and the consul at London, with a view of shown g ihe justi ess
of the addition to the appropriation
A letter was then read from Mr Cass to Mr Wehsfr, dated
Paris, setting for h various duties imposed on the American
consul m that city, for which he does not get any comjiensation,
though subjected to great addi it nal expense
A letter was also read fiom Mr Wheaton dited Palis, certi
fying the necessny and utility of making additional allowance
to the consul at Paris
Also, an extract of a letter from the American consul at ion
don enumerating many reasons for continuing the salary of the
consul at Pans                                          „                      ,   ,
Mr BUCHANAN ar-ked the Senator fiom Mame what was
the amount of consular fees receivi-d by the consul at Pai is1
Mr EVANS )wd no piecise int jniatton but he unler tood

ihonld th rot sul at Pans have a salary allowed to him n
addition I the fees of office?    The or.gm of giving a salary
was as compensation for the iu'filhng the duties of cojji-
missionerof claims The necessity for that duty had ceased
He had now no duties to perform, except those which were
commonly performed by coi suis, and he was receiving double
or treble the amount received by any other American consul.
At the time, too, when the salary was granted, Pans was hot
muco of an exporting city, and the fees of the consul must have
been very inconsiderable in (omparison with the present
amount. Circumstances had changed, there was now agreat
deal of direct trade between Pans and the United States It
would, he thought, be a very great injustice towards other
officers ol this descnption to give him a salaiy of «2,000,
while they gave noth ng to the others As to the reasons
contained m the Ietteis which the Senator had read, he did
not consider them entitled to much weight It was trae, ap
plications were made by Americans m distress to the consul,
and subscriptions were obtained by him from American real
dents for their relief But this was nothing more than was m
cambent upon ail consuls, and m seme cases, ashewasaware
—particularly m that of St Petersburg—the consul, m place
of obtaining sul srnptions, as there were ro American lwdents
there, furnished supp íes om of his own pocket to Ameucan
riti7ensmdisttecs— an 1 this without having half the amount
of means which t le c< nsu! it Pans possessed
Ancthei re is >n given was, that the consul was very service
able to the resident American minis er    Verv true, he was of
ten consulted, and was often of considerable service but no
one ever thought of giving him asalarv onthataccount, merely
because he assists the minister occasionally—in leturn for
which, he  no doubt, got manya good dinner    These reasons
he did not conceive to be sufficient to induce the Senate to de
part from its former decision, in favor of a gentleman who al
ready receives more than any othei    It was what he would
never consent to
The question was then called for
Mr EVANS demanded the yeas and nays
The yeas and navs were ordered
Messrs RIVES, BUCHANAN, and EVANS, made a few
remarks with regai d to the suppression of the salary
Mr RIVES was not aware of any argument in favor of dis-
continuing this salarv for the consul at Pans, that has not
existed for the last thirty years He knew, personally, that
when he was in Pans it was a source of geneial complaint,
that even with the salary of $2,000 added to the fees of the of
fice, the conbuldte found it very difficult tj keep out oí debt
Inasmuch as he looked upon the pioposition to suppress the
Ealarvasan unnecisearv innovation, and until better reasons
were shown than any vet adduced for ta «ui. pression, he should
vote for the amendment of the coromit'ee
Mr MLR HICK made a few rem uK not distinctly heard in
the gallery
Mi KING, from h s experience, could say that the living
and expensts of individuals holding official stations in I ondon
were more than double those of living in Tans This sum of
$2 000 for the consulate in Paris could not be considered in the
Ii"ht of a salary, it was an appropriation for compensation as
agent foi Amenoan claims Now, he thought it was for those
calling (or the appropriation to slow what were the circum
stances which entitled this consulate toan allowance not grant
ed to other consulates at places much less profitable with re-
gard to fees                                                     ,                          ,
Mr WRIGHT debited to say only a single word listo the
reason why he should vote against the amendment It was the
fiist instance, he believed, in which it had been deliberately
pi oponed to Congress to grant salaries to consuls as such The
salarie  heretofore granted to the consuls at 1 ondon and Pans,
were in rami entate those individuals for acting as commis-
sioners of claims Those duties, it had been shown, had ceas
ed and if they now granted the silaues, it would be as consuls
that they would receive them and if they v. c re to begin at the
verv best point, where would they end'
Mr PRESIÓN did not think it necessary to make any al-
lowances to consuls for maintaining national dignity There
wei e mm sters for that purpose at foreign courts It appeared
that the consul at Paris had fees to the amount of S3 tu , and
upwards If allowances besides feesaie tobe malo to consols,
it ceitamly should not begin with tht fifth consulate in the gut
of the Government, in point of value He would mention the
consul at Rome is o .e much more llistly entitled [psome al
lowanco Hi thouaht that out of this $2000 usually allowed
for the consulate at Pans a just distribution of compensation
