HEADQUARTERS, May 7, 1862.

General D. H. HILL:

MY DEAR GENERAL: Please place Rodes' brigade about half way between Diascund Bridge and Burnt Ordinary, with his battery - one regiment a mile in advance of the brigade, with a section of artillery. This is necessary to guard our rear on that road.

Please direct General Rodes to select the best position that he can find both for his three regiments and his regiment on advance guard, and instruct them that our cavalry will retire by that road, so that they may not fire on them. A position must be selected which can be held, and must be held.

Most respectfully,JAMES LONGSTREET,

Major-General, Commanding.

[Indorsement.]

General RODES:

I send you directions from General Longstreet, which please read and return. The order must be promptly executed.

D. H. HILL,

Major-General.

Hon. GEORGE W. RANDOLPH,

WILLIAM PANNILL,

Provost-Marshal.
