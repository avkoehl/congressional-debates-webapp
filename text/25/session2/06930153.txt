S5rn Co io—2nd Sess.                         Making public officers depositaries—Mr. Strange.                                                        Senate.
greenest laurels that will ever bloom above their
graves, have since changed their opinions, and be-
come the advocates of a National Bank. They are
still men of high intellectual power, and bme can-
not have abated their vigor. Bat how different
are their efforts from what they then were1 They
still strike with power, but they beat only the air
The ground which they occupy does not afford
scope for the exertion of their might. Upon this
subject Sampson is shorn of his glorious locks, and
«hakes himself m vain, as at other times
I now come to a portion of my country's histo-
ry, from which I would turn aside w ith shame,
but the story must be told. A vi ar of glory had
been fought, the Federal parly had opposed ll  be-
ginning, and during its continuance lasted for the
victories of their country, and rejoiced over those
of the enemy. But the war ended a  it had begun,
in the honor of the nation. But war is expensive,
and ihe Administration found itself involved
in debt and taxation, and the local banks had
stopped pajment, and the Opposition began
to wag their heads, and point the hnger m derision,
and cry " There' there1 So would we have it "
The pride of the Administration was stung, and
another instance was furnished of the frailty oí man
in his best estate; and in a desperate effort to re-
trieve its pecuniary affairs, a United States Bank
was proposed and chartered, against the opposition •
of the Federalists, consistent only in opposition
Such I believe to be the tiue secret of the charter
of the second Bank of the United Stales Others
more familiar with the political secrets oí the day
may account for it upon some other principle, Lut
Mich I believe, and alwajshave believed, was the
true nature of the transaction But the b°nk \ is
cha tered, and sime apo'og) must be mad  for t &
barefaced inconsistency oí the Republican party,
and an apology, the ¡strangest that ever cou'd hav e
entered into the conception of one who set any
value upon a written Constitution, was offered. It
had been once decided, it was said, by all the de-
partments of the Government, that a bank was
constitutional, and therefore it was settled.
Strange that the very warmest opponents of con-
struction should thus have established it m the
very heart of the Constitution, and made what
was intended to be Stable as the hills, and
inflexible as iron, as fugitive as stuobie, and
as supple as a liable wand That what «as
intended to encompass the powei  01 ihe G< vera-
ment, and hedge them m tilth walls ot brass, so
that they should not encroach upon the right  of
the States, should be rendered submissive to the
ever encroaching spirit of that very Government,
securing to it the undisputed right to every foot ol
ground it gains in us advances. If the bank «as
ever unconstitutional, it was so then, and must
continue so until that Constitution is altered by the
only means which has been provided. But the
bank was chartered, and soon began to show forth
its natural fruits A high tariff for the protection
of manufactures, a process by which the Govern-
ment is enriched, and the nation impoverished, and
which mthe particular instance was well nigh rend-
ing asunder this noble confederacy, and pollut-
ing its sacred soil with the mmged blood of kinsmen
meeting in hostile array Splendid schemes of in-
ternal improvement by the General Government,
by which local bargains and legislative log-rolling,
acting like gold upon the Roman legions, decided
who should be elevated to power, and who degrad-
ed while the people are reasoned with through
their sufferings, as to the mode in which they shall
exercise their sovereign prerogative of election
For the greater portion of the existence of the
late United States Bank, its mischievous tendency
w as very much restrained by the want of concert
hetween the administrators of the Government and
the administrators of the bank, but notwithstanding
the resistance whieh it thus met with, it impercep-
tibly drew arter a Democratic administration into
the path along which it naturally led. It was only
during the one term of the jounger Adams that an
Executive, on «hose co-operation it might calcu-
late, was in power, but, fortunately for his count! y,
so ímpracticasle was hejin his disposition, that the
finest plot ever formed would be maned if at all
dependant for success upon his co-operation
I come now to the two terms of his revered suc-
cessor He found upon coming into power high
tariff, internal improvement, and other Federal
abominations, m full possession of the Capitol, in-
troduced by the United States Bank, like another
Trojan horse concealed within her dark and capa-
cious bosom.

He was not only a brave man, but a wise one
His «as that true heroism which combines the
most undaunted bravery with the most consum-
mate prudence He knew well that it would not
be safe to make an open and direct attack upon
these formidable and combined interests, but by
the most ingenious and refined s'rokes of policy, he
dealt first one, and then another, some disabling
blow, until he was so fortunate as to hand them
all over to the American people, bound hand and
foot, to be dealt with by them according to their
pleasure Thi  it was which provoked against him
the hatred of the Opposition, this was the very head
and front of his offending He had ca=t their idols
to the moles and the bats, and cleansed the temple
of libert} of their polluting presence For this, they
have pursued him with most unrelenting vengeance
long before his Presidential term had closed, and
even now, when he has retired, like another Cm-
cmnatus, to his own peaceful Hermitage, the
hoarse baying of their ban-dogs breaks in upon the
stillness of that magic circle I will not anticipate
the time, now so near at hand, when he will share
the repose of her who shared with him m life the
calumnies of the world When his shall be the
only apotbehsis known to the Christian When
his name shall be noth ng but a watchword to wake
up the reco'lction of noble deeds When his
tomb «hill be a sacred spot, whither each western
traveller will turn aside from his path, a shrine
where valor and patriotism w ill rekindle their fires,
and Beauty and Purity offer the pearl of gratitude
to their gallant defender
But efforts are making to re-establish m their an-
cient niches those tutelary deities of the Federal
party which he hath cast down, and efforts will
continue to be made until success shall attend
them or even hope becomes desperate. We have
heard some description upon this floor of the ma-
chinery employed «e have leinW that the United
States Bank, m the late application for a recharter,
had dealings w th members of Congress very simi-
lir to those described by Mr Jefferson, in by-gone
times—that the pi ess ceaselessly poured forth its
v enom and threatemngs upon the heads of those
who dared *o oppose its recharter, and that even
the galleries of Conguss vvre filled with the myr-
midons of the bank, stmmg to overawe its delibe-
rations And shall we, with this experience, with
a'l our experience, again create a itrant to seouige
us into submissiot' Shall we set up a golden calf
to draw off the devotion  of the people from prin-
ciples consecrated by the blood of their STes^ Sha'l
we charter another United States Bank"* But I
snail be to d the substitute does not propose
the cnartei of a United Slates Bank I know
it doe  not m terms, but its effect will be to
produce that or a  imilai result The existence of
an institution with powers much more vast than
any heretoiore enjoved by a United States Bank,
w ill follow its adoption, as certainly as the spring-
ing of the herbage upon the showers of April
Either the United Sta'es Bank, so called, at Ph 'a-
delphia, wi'l seize upon the public treasure, and
thus accomplish the consolidation of the monej
power, w ith a capacity for wielding it heretotore
unknown, or the honest Fedeialists and the timid
Democrats, alarmed at Us power, will, upon the
principle of setting back file in a prairie to check
the wide spread rum with which that raging ele-
ment is alread\ threatening them, unite m the char-
ter of a United States Bank as the desperate but only
lemaimrig remedy S*e what power that institution
possesses even now The other banks stand by, like
trembling slaves, obedient to it  nod, and stop or
resume the payment of «pecie, as it commands
What will he its power, if the substitute is adopt-
ed, and it possesses iteelf, as it must do, of the pub-
he deposites'' Whom it will it will set up, and
whom it will, destroy Whichever of the alterna-
tives before stated 1  adopted, the chains will be
forged which will bind the wills of the American peo-
ple in fetters stronger than iron. And when so
bound, whifher-will they be led? First, to bow dowa
at the feet of an aristocracy, and from thence at the
footstool of a king, for the chrysalis does not more
certainly become a butterfly, than Government pro-
ceeds from one gradation to another, until all power
centres in one man, if there is no provision made
for resisting that tendency Our Constitution pre-
sent  that resistance, while it remains in it  primary
vigor, bat if sapped by the corrupting influence of
money, our security is lost. The Senator from
Kentucky, [Mr Clay,] with a candor which does
him credit, admits the corrupting influence of
money, and especially when that influence is
thrown abroad from one great centre. But we are
not limited to the Senate for proof of this corrupt-
ing influence. The sacred scriptures declare money
to be the root of all evil With the ancient pagans
Plutus was ranked among the infernal gods. He
was not deemed w orthy to take his seat in the celes-
tial throng his propensities were considered low
and grovelling he was of the earth—earthy. And
of the tendency of consolidated wealth m a bank to
affect materially the political action of a nation,
and especially when that bank is its fiscal agent,
we have testimony ab haste A writer in the Edin-
burgh Review, Ño 1, p 196, himself evidently a
friend of the paper system, says as follows-
' If ihe Bank of England must now be cons dered as a national
establishment, not merely nfluenciug, by the superior magni-
tude of lis capita!, the state of commercial circulation, but
guiding lis movements according to views of public policy, an
important revolution has taken place since the first creation of
thatcjrporation asa banking establishment That power of
issuing the medium of exchange, with the opportunities it lm
pt es of varying its quantity and value, which, while precious
com was in use \vas exercised under the immediate preroga
tivt, ofihe Ci )wn is nov, Mrtually vested in the governor and
dnectorsof the Lank of England In the official charactei of
that board  omt of the functions of sovereignty are united to
those o*"a tiader and the oppo-tuouies of hanking profits are
b enc ed with a tru=t and ch<nge of the public interest It wiH
be p]pa= ng if the e «hall prove more happily compatible than
the} have been lout i in o her i stance- The organization of
thi« establishment, po e^"dof jch mean  to crmtrol the ope
rations of commerce a^ well as to lacduate the advance of
financial suppil^ ma\, into our po'i'ica constitution, already
go complica ed mtioducea new principle of action, theeilect
of which cannot bp easily d  cerned
Perhap  an unbounded neld will be opened for the exten
sion o ministerial influence Peihapsan unexpected control
may be gained to the people over the views and measures oi
the Executive '
If such is to be the effect in England, where a
strong Execuuve existo like a balance-wheel, to
keep steady the action of the Government, such as
it is, what must be the effect with us, where the
political action is from below, from the great mass
of the people, upon whom this pestileutial influence
may be brought to act in the most subtle and im-
perceptible manner'2 I wish I could say of this
Republic a Louis of France did of his monarchy:
"The monarchy is \ er} old, but it will la t my
time " This Republic is hut fifty jears oí age, but if
something i  not done to arrest the corrup'ing influ-
ences abroad among the people, it will smk into
ruin before, in the common course of nature, those
who now fill th<"se halls are gathered to their
fathers There was a time when the American
people despised appeals made to their pockets, but
now they have learned to listen Already are we
repioached in Europe as a nation of merchants,
whose sordid souls are alwajs in the marke';
and the same venerable man to whom I re-
ferred in a former pan of my address, re-
marked to me, v ím honest indignation in his coun-
tenance, that he never doubted the stability of our
institutions until he found so large a portion of
our people calculating the value of exchanges.
Isothing maiks so strongly the decline of that vi-
goious virtue which makes a nation, as when the
barter begins of principle for gold, as when men
and measures commend themselve  to the public
fa\orbythe luxurious splendor with which they
are invested How fallen was Athens from its
Democratic punt} and p'ovmoial bravery when
the talented and accomplished but corrupt Pericles
scattered abroad the public, treasure in buying up
the hearts of the peopls He threw around them
the magic chain of pleasure, dazzled them with
magnificent public works, instituted expensive
games, pampered their appetites, and steeped them
in sensual enjoyments Nor were the fine arts ne-
glected, every thing, in short, was done, and that
at the public expense, for fitting them to throw
