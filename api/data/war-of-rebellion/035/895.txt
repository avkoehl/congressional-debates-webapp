General MACKALL:

General Wheeler thinks, from best authority, the river will not be fordable until to-morrow night. Railroad bridge burned. All trains and troops are on this side, except such cavalry as General Wheeler thinks will not require a bridge.

ALLISONA, July 1, 1863.

General MACKALL:]

In reply to your question, shall we fight on the Elk or take post on the mountain near to Cowan, I say take post near the mountain at Cowan. I think as many trains as possible should be sent over the mountain.

L. POLK.

[THOMAS M. JACK,]

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF WESTERN VIRGINIA, Dublin, July 1, 1863.

Major General SAMUEL JONES,Salt Sulphur:

General Pegram telegraphs from Knoxville for re-enforcement; says he is directed to do so by General Buckner, who has carried all available force to Bragg. I shall not order the Fifty-first from Glade Spring unless Preston says positively that there is no advance on the Salt-Works. His last telegram, of yesterday, confidently looks for the attack. I forward it to you to-day. I cannot see how you can now spare troops to Knoxville, and will await your directions. The delay in getting the Fifty-first from Knoxville and back, in case they were needed, would be very great. Enough will be here to-night. Will bury the work.

Yours, &amp;c.,

CHAS. S. STRINGFELLOW,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

P. S.-Colonel Clarke will forward without delay.
