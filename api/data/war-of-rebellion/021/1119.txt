SHIP HARTFORD,

Above Port Hudson, April 24, 1863.

General BANKS:

I am glad to hear of your successes. I can hear nothing from Grant until the five gunboats from Vicksburg arrive; till then I have none that can pass Fort De Russy, at Gordon's Landing. Port Hudson is on half rations; troops discontented. The enemy has sent to Arkansas for troops for Taylor. There is nothing to impede communication with me in the Atchafalaya.

D. G. FARRAGUT,

Rear-Admiral.

SPECIAL ORDERS, HDQRS. DEPT. OF THE GULF, 19TH A. C., No. 106. Opelousas, La., May 2, 1863.

IV. The action of Brigadier General William Dwight, commanding First Brigade, Fourth Division, in causing Private Henry Hamill, Company D, One hundred and thirty-first New York Volunteers, to be shot to death in front of the brigade, at sunset on the 25th of April, for quitting his colors to plunder and pillage, while the brigade was on detached service in an exposed position and in presence of the enemy, if sully approved by the general commanding this army.

The last warning against straggling and pillage has been exhausted. It has become necessary, to prevent demoralization, that the fate of this wretched man should be measured out to all who follow his example. The safety of this army is more important than the life of any man in it, from the humblest private to the commanding general.

Brigadier-General Dwight will cause all white males, to the number of 100, in the vicinity of the scene of the murder to-day to be immediately arrested, and sent under strong guard to New Orleans, wee they will be kept in close confinement till fuhrer orders, as hostages for the delivery of the murderers into the hands of the military authorities of the United States.
