brief debate ofyestciday in relition to the removal of the post
mastei at St Louis and the complaint of the Postmaster Gtn
eial against the publication of certain letteis received fiom hi

new pieten'-ion to secrecy, to enow that it was unfounded in
itself, and contradicted by the practice of the departments

Ucation    Theobjecutn of the Postmastci  General is to the
publication holding the letters to come under the rule of oonfl
dantial common)rations from the President to the ¡senate   The
answer ib, that they are not commumca'ions from the Presi
dent at all, that they come from a public office, and constitute
a pal t of the archives of the office, as characterized by the Post
m («lei General himself   They w<*re papers on file in a public
office, marked with the endorsements of the office, and put there

he had a light to puuhsh 'hem    No rule of confidential com

nomination Well at the end of a long time, f hurchill is nom
limed, and I present the nomination as a casern which the Prea
ident has been imposed upon, and led to do an act which violates"
his inaugural address, viola es his Secretary's circular, and
piostuutes the post ofhee to the purposes of party and faction
Publicity corrects these things,, secrecy sanctions them, and
by my publication I have brought the facts to light, and shown
to the President and the country the imposition which has been
practised
Again publicuyhas had another gieat effect in this case.
Mi Taylor, the father in law of Mr Churchill, made foul charges
and insinuations m order to get Mi Watson put out, and hia
son m law put in If the new doctrine of the new Postmaster
General had prevailed, Mr Tayloi's charges would have re-
mained a state secret' The President and the Senate would
have acted upon it and Mr Watson in addition to losing hie
office, would have remained branded as a spy, an intercepter
of letters and a perpetrator of heinous oflences This would
have been the tesult if the doctrine of secrecy had prevailed 
But I disregarded that doctrine and what is the result! Mr
Watson calls upon Mi Taylor foi his proofs At the end of
eiffhtdays Mt 1 aylor answers, and sa>s, M AM FREE TO
ADMIT \OV MUSI S1A!ND ACQUITTED  
Thus publicity has tescued a worthy man from foul impu-
tations, which must have ruined him in the opinion of lhe
Senatt ard I rejoice in being the instrument of saving him
fiom defamation, and savi ig the President and the Senate
from (he imposition which was attempted uapn them Mr.
Watson, infi/ims me that he has sent the corlespondence be
twe^n him-splf and Mr Taylor to eveiy member of'heSenate,
to the President, and to the Postmaster General and whoever
will read it, will see that the two Whig gentlemen to whorri
Mr Tayloi referred for the proof of his charges, have given
warm andle&pectful testimony in behalf of Mr Watson He
wants no otheror higher character than his political opponent 
will g ve him—either those of Sr Louis, where he now lives, or
those of Newbern North Catolina, wh^re he was postmaster
for a quarter of a centmy
Mr li said he would drop this subject here There were
otntr views of it, which could only betaken in secret ¡session.
For the pieaent, he would refei m addi ion to the President' 
mauguial and Mi Webstef's circular to the speech of a Sena-
tor Irom So Jth Carolina [Mr PrbstokI against political pro-
scription and fights for spoil That ¡senator had delivered fin©
sentiments u pon the^e points, and had announced that the war
foi the spoils was at an end, and that proscription was now to
he proscribed This is what he said au the change of adminis-
tration a little more than ayeai ago, and he is now about to
have a grand opportunity for the applicat on of his sentiments.
All I now do is to remind him of what I then told him—that
proscription and fighting for spoil had never been known in
Missouri, that if they came there, his paity would introduce
them and, in relation to this very psst office reminded him
that it had been held eighteen years by a gentleman of the op-
position, and had only been filled a few months by one of
ourown paity, appointed at the expiration of the other's term,
after 11£ yeais tenure under Jackson and A ai Buren
Mi B then submitted his íesolufjon, m relation to Mr N P
Tayloi's conduct in the register's office at St Louis, and re-
maiked that the answer would^probibly illustrate the truth of
a beautiful maxim of antiquity—Mai a good mams rarely
accused except by those who are themselves worthy ofa<s*
cusatwn    The resolution was read, asfollows
Resolved^ That the President of the United States be re-
ques ed to C( mmunicite to the Senate all the information
which maybe in the General Land Office, imputing improper
conduct in the register s office to Mr N P Taylor, present

The i evolution lies nn the table till m morrow
A mes age wa" received fiom the House of Representatives,
ircompained by the bill pio\idmg for 'he apportionment of
Kepieseniatives among the states, according to the sixth
cersus
Mi WA.LKLR t'eoired that the above bi'1 should be taken
vp with a view to have it lefened tu the Committee on the
iudiciarv, but he said, if it was des rabie to hive it referred
lo a select committee, he >vouid have no objection to such ref-
erence
Mi CI AYTON did not °ee thai it was more important that
this bill should be refened to the 7udiciary Committee than to
any other It was his opmton (hat if the bill was to be referred
at all it ehon d bo sent to a special committee He did not,
howevei seethe necessity of ary reference—inasmuch as the
Senate was in posesión of all the facts to guide its action on
the bill    He was opposedto any reference
Mr WAI KETi ri mirked that it had been always customary
t> íe^r bills ol this character to the Judiciary Committee.
But were weie special reasons why this bill should be
referred to that committee, oi some other There was a
very important, legal and const! utional question involved
in this bill, in consequence of the amendment which had
been engrafted upon it by the House of Representatives,
assuming the power by Congiess to district every State
in the Union He was not oppo-ed to the district system as
a geneial principle, but as to how fai Congress should goto
lego ate the d.^tnc mg of the Sta es, was another question.
It was a grave question, involving one of legal and consti-
tutional power, upon which he would not, at that time, expresa
ary t pinion The powei m Congress to district the States had
beeudened by many memhers of the other House, and it was
doubted by many Senatois who held it to be unconstitutional
it there was no c ther reason for the reference, this alone would
be sufficient but there wa*> anothet least  In lookingover
theapport onmentjie found that such a latiohad been fixed
upon a-uii 1 srio s n justice to the State of Missis ippi—leaving
her with a laiger unrepresented fraction than any other State m
the tlnnn thoush she wai one of the smallest States, when, if
an addition of 560 had been made to the ratio, it would have
inven her another ReDiesenUtive The«e were his reasonsfor
the reft rence but h* ha 1 r o objection to the bill being sent to a
select committee ins ea 1 of the Judiciary Committee
Mr AI LBN «aw no good reason why the bill should be re-
ferred io any committee, foi at ¡as , all 'he questions invoked
wou d have to come before tbf1 ¡senate If it w«=? referred, the
consequence wou! 1 be an unnecessary consumption of time
He won! i prefer tint it should lie on the tahlf, tobe called up
immediately afrer the appro; ria ion billwas disposed of
Mr ARfHEK onuded wuh the Senator from Mississippi,
that the bill shou'd be refe¡ red to the Judiciary Committee, not
only because precedent justified it but because there were
gia\e legal and constitutional question* mvo ved as to d?e right
of Congress to exercise the power to rfjstnct fhe States—a pow
er which had never b^en « et up before
