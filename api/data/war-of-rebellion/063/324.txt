I do not believe it, but the have scouts on the Saint Francis, and he cannot cross that stream until the water falls, and I should know it long before that. Last night that same rumor reached here, but I give credence to it. I am watching and have no fears. I tolled you last night I through the rumor wild. We cannot get to Bloomfield, not neither can any enemy. We are all right at Bloomfield. Have no fears on our account.

Is the water so high that you cannot re-enforce Bloomfield? Answer at once.

Brigadier-General EWING,

Commanding:

I do not credit the rumor of any danger to Blomfield. The high stage of water makes all the streams impassable. The Saint Francis could not well be crossed. I am satisfied that it is all hamburg. I will write you fully by to-day's mail.

You entirely misunderstood me if you conclude I think myself in danger. The rumor I referred to came from Colonel Tyler, via Patterson. I do not believe it. He seems to understand that I am about to lose Bloomfield; do not apprehend any such calamity. My scout are on the Saint Francis; can get no farther on account of high water. I fear no attack, have asked for no re-enforcements; do not want any. I spoke of the First Missouri State Militia to take the place of the heavy artillery which you spoke of sending to Bloomfield. I spoke of the future entirely. I did not think it best to send away all the heavy artillery, leaving ten siege guns and four forts useless. I fear no siege-expect no attack. Moving forces now is out of the question, the water is so high. I can hold Bloomfield without aid. We have no communication with Bloomfield. The line is down, and the water is so high on the White River bottom that the repairers cannot reach it. It would swim a horse for miles. You entirely misunderstood me if you think I am afraid. We shall not need help from Patterson Pilot Knob. My cavalry force, all toll, at this post is 350 effective men. It is enough.

J. B. ROGERS,

Colonel, Commanding.
