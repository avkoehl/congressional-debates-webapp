ROYALL'S HOUSE, May 21, 1864.

The enemy have landed on James Island from Long and Dixon's Islands. Our pickets have fallen back to this side causeway very properly. We are firing on enemy from Secessionville, which place I have ordered to be re-enforced. I have sent aide to front to learn particulars. Since sending the above, hear that the enemy are advancing a force on new lines. Simonton says he cannot hold them longer in check with his pickets. Asks al the re-enforcement he can get. Send some troops here.

ROYALL'S, June 26, 1864-6.45 p. m.

Colonel Yates reports that the enemy opened on Fort Johnson this evening with guns and mortars from Gregg. We returned their fire, cutting off the tall flag-staff at Gregg. Colonel Frederick reports that he had Battery Island thoroughly scouted last night and finds that the enemy have obstructed the river with a cable from Horse Island to the obstructions, to which cable he thinks torpedoes may be placed to operate upon any torpedo or other boat going down the river. No sign of work on Battery Island, although the enemy were over there yesterday.

Assistant Adjutant-General.

ROYALL'S HOUSE, July 2, 1864-3.40 p. m.

The enemy's line of battle extends from Rivers' to Grimball's Causeways, with their line of skirmisher in front. Their force is represented as strong and must be not less than 3,000 or 4,000. They are intrenching. The troops are just arriving from Charleston, but the force is not large enough, I fear, yet to attack.
