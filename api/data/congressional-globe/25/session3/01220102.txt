RESOLUTIONS OF VERMONT.
Mr PRENTISS fiesented certain resolutions
from the Legislature of the State of Veimont,
mstiucting then Senators and requesting their
Repiesentatives to u&e their efforts to prevent the
passage of any law for the annexation of Texas
to the Union, and to procure the passage of a law
for the abolition of slavery and the slave trade in
the District of Columbia and the Terutones of
the Union, and of the slave tiade between the
several States, and also piotestmg against certain
itsolutionb [Mr Atherion's] adopted by the
House of Representatives, as unconstitutional,
which Mr P moved should be laid upon the
tabic and ordered to be printed
The question was, on motion of Mr POSTER,
divided, and the fiist division was agreed to
The question coming up on the second division,
viz   to punt the resolution,
Mr PRENTISS said he had made the motion
to punt these resolutions because he supposed it
would be an act of proper courtesy to the Legts-
latute from whom they come When he pre-
sented them he had not the slightest idea thatanv
serious objection would be made to them, or that
they would excite any debate, and he would say
to gentlemen of the South, that the couise which
they weie pursuing was precisely the course to
mcieasc the number and augment the strength of
the Abolitionists, and he thought it in other re
speet* impolitic and inj inous, as well as wrong
and unieasonable in itself
The virtual ujection of petitions heie was re-
garded as an infraction of the right of petition,
and this was connected with the gre it subject of
abolition, and had given to it a powei not pioperly
its own, so that those who were opposed to ex-
treme and premature measures, and who wished
to prevent useless excitement and agitation, found
themselves powerless inconsequence of this con-
nection, and if this couise weie persisted ill, they
would be obliged to give way entirely Mr P
trusted these resolutions would be printed as an
act of common courtesy, and he called for the
yeas and nays on the question, which were or-
deied
Mr CALHOUN confessed that he was amazed
when he saw a gentleman of the calmness and
conect judgment of the Senatoi from Vermont,
pursuing the com se that he did That there should
be any man of any intelligence whatever who did
not see that this question strikes at the very foun-
dation of the Union, alienating one portion of it
from the other, and that it tended to the ovei throw
of the best hopes of mankind, indeed surprised
him Noi was it less wonderful to him that any
gentleman of that description should pretend to
say that the best course of southern gentlemen
was to permit the Abolitionists to come here and
uige the question whenevei they pleased Ihey
tell us (said Mr C ) that we have no light to our
own estates, that a large part of our property is
held without law, and that they have the right
to come heie week after week, yeai aftei yeai,
questioning oui right to it, and calumniating our
cbaractei, while the best mode foi us to pursue
is to be quiet Su, (said Mi C ,) I would not
have made these obseivations, if the lemailisthat
called them foith had not come from a respect-
able quaiter The course ol the gentleman from
Veimont was a striking pi oof that on all ques-
tions of deep excitement the strongest minds may
be cairied away Mr C would say to the Sen-
ator fiom Vermont that this thing must be arrested
at home, by stiong measuies, or the South would
take care of itself
Mi PRENTISS said he had simply asked that
these resolutions might be printed, as a mark of
the couitesy usually evinced to States of this
Union He did not enter into any argument on
the question of abolition IN either he nor any
other Senator from the North had, on any occa-
sion, been found to agitate that question The
fault, if it was one, lay in another quarter He
wished merely to discharge an obvious duty If
he found it certain that he could not carry out
his own opinions on the subject of slavery, which
he ti usted were well known, he thought it best
to defer the attempt to a more favorable oppor
tumty These resolutions were passed by the
Legislatuie of Vermont in consequence of peti-
tions requiting their passage They were reso-
lutions ot instruction, and, so far as he was con-
cerned, he wished to discharge the duty imposed
upon him
Mr KING found no fault with the Senatorfrom
Veimont for discharging his duty to his State,
in presenting such resolutions as they thought
I proper to charge him with He waived, there-
fore, under these considerations, any objections
< to receiving the resolutions They came from a
sovereign State but whether that State was true
to theprmciples which should govern every mem-
bei of the Confederacy, was another question
With íegard to the prayer of these resolutions,
every man of common intelligence knew that, if
it were granted, this Union would not last twenty-
four hours He knew that he, and every man
fiom that section of the Union which would be
so grossly outraged by such a measure, would
instantly on the adoption of it retire fiom their
seats He would, in such an event, return to his
constituents, and tell them that the compact was
broken, the Constitution violated, and their prop-
erty taken away from them, and that he, as their
representative, could render them no furthei ser-
vice by remaining wheie he was Believing that
such would be the inevitable consequences of car-
rying out the doctrines contained in these resolu-
