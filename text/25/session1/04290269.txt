H. of Reps,
moneys in deposite, be<ause, whenever any surplus occurred,
it wa" immediately applied by the commis-oone * of the «inking
iund to the piuchiss of the public debt The mesponsibie
agents behird the m enes, who instigated the removal of ihe de
posites, selected with instinctive sagacity their^me They had
oihei plosions to gratify besides then \mdictive malignity
rhey saw the uses to be mide oflaigc and long continued sm
pities, and that the mone-vR of the nation m scht -be hvished for
the conjoint rnd uni ed profl gacy of poli ical piun ler and pn
\ ate «peculation That they nu 'it not want the conn erance
of the admmistiation in this laudable pms ut the Secretary of
the Treasury snuned them to i with the eagerness of a hunts
man panting for his piey
1 The deposites of the public money,' said the Secretary of
thoTieasiiry to the president of the btanch of the Bank of the
Siat° of Alabama it Mobile, m his letter selecting that bank as
oie of the new deposito íes, "will enable yon to afford mcreas
rd facilities to the commercial and o'her clashes of the com
munity, and the Devilment anticipates Aom von the adoption
of s ich acouise respecting our accommodation'; as w ill piove
acceptable to the people and =are to   he Government '
Tne Br inch o! the Bank oí the State of Alabama at Mobile
had been chattered inDecember, 1832 Its capualoftwo mil
bo-it of dalláis consists of the proceeds ofsales of the bonds of
the Staie irredeemable for t lurry yeaio Is li directors are
-illinnuilly chosen by the legislarme There is no peni't/
prescribe! foi then suspension of specie payments, but the
faithof the S a e is p'e'ged for the finil pajment of their h?
b Itties Tnn hank in October, 1SÍ3, wasseleneias one of the
depositaries ofthe public funds, instead of the Branch of the
Tj nted ritale-, Bank at Mobile
On the 1st day of October, I 33, there were deposited m the
Bmkofthet ute I Staus                                        $647r)4 rj <*>
w'uch had been accumulating from the firsl quarter of the yeai,
s->-ne small fragments of public debt still remaining to be paid,
hut not enough to arrest the tide of the public íe^emie flowing
into the Tie?Mirv
On the 1 st of Tanuai y, 18-34, this sum had been i ed need to less
thin one million of dollars, .md m therm an time the Bianchof
the State Bdnk of Alabama had become adepositoiyfor
©231,614 3"
which sum continued increasing fiom quarter to quartei, with
one exception, till \pril 1835, when the deposite m the
S ate Branch Bank of Alabama, at Mobile, was   $1,309,738 65
Since which time, that i=>, tor m«ie t an two yeais belire the
suspension of specie payments, theie lies been in hat bank i
permanent average deposite ofiwebe hundted tho i and dol
iirs—never ieduced so low as ^900 000 and once swelling fo
upwa ds of sixteen hundred thoiuand doláis—little thou uf

secret On the3dof lanuaiy last, a resolution ol thwHouse
cilledon the Secretary of the Treasury for this as w 11 as
oilier mfoimation, if within hispowei but on the 12th of that
month he reported that it was nit within his power It seems
that the amount of dividends declared, of surpluses retained,
and of contingent funds retened, isnotundeistood tobe a part
of their condition, of which they are required to give account
from time to timetotheBecietaiy of the Treasury He «ays
tint by none of the agreements made with them by him either
befoie er since the deposite act of the 23d of June, 1836, has it
ever been stipulated that they bhould furni«h this specific m
f rmatien, and that they have not furnished tt fhr it was pre
cisely the most important of alt possible information tn show
their actual conditi n, and the omi «¡ion tocxll f>r it would be
i ^excusable, but fortheieason tdeitkd by theSccutaiv that
i was not reí tared bylaw The omi-sion wis the fiultoftlie
law, and not oí il e Secietuy, and jet it wou'dhayp beer ju-t
and judtcnus ifhe Odd required it There can be no honest
íeasin fer the binks to refuse it and it would now he the best
oí all evidence to show whit profit was eleiived by tho*ebanks
from he deposites We must, theiefore be rontent with an
estimate anda permanent depose of tw*-he hundred thousand
dollars foi moje than two years may he fan ly estimated at ten
percent oi one bundled and twenty tbousand dolhr<= lyear,
and as it is to be continn d f >i nine fifteen, and twenty one
mon hi longei, the whole 'iim is m such deposit* equivalents
a gratuity t uhe State oí Alabama of four hundred thousand
dollar* at heexpense ofhei northern eistero
Mr Adams was. pioceedmg to comment on this statement,
when
Mi Cambpeleng rose, and appealed to him to peimit the
question to be taken on the bill befoie the committee He
thought the gentleman wis g ing to ta'k ill night, (he «aid )
and it was Ute
Mi Ada.ms was *oiry the gentleman fiom !Ne\> York dtd not
relish his remarks
Mr Cambieleng assured the gepileman rrom Massachusetts
that he had not listened to a single wor 1 he had said
Mi Adam5! puisued his remark^ He atgued from the facts
he had been eommen wg on that the accumulation of the pub
he moneys m certain States hid been permitted foi political
t fleet and that this 1 ad been u-ed as an argument with sen
itemen fiom those State- to mince them to su«tim other
measure- of the admmistiation and wa- proceeding on ihih
view of the subject, by alducingfacts when he wascilleHo
or ler bv
The Chairman, who intimated that he wis wmdet n^ from
ihe question immediately befoie the Committee ol the Whole
Mr Adam-, ubseivedth.it this was be first time any ^en
tleman had b"en callpd to vder in Commit ee of the \\ holt, by
the Chairman 1m not confining himself str < tly to the question
immediately before the committee It would bu impossible
to enumerate the dififewnt subjects which had been discussed
under questions to which they had no re'evmcy and he gave
•w an instance, the bulliant --prech of the gentleman trom
South Cuolin i, (Mi I-^g^ie ) The amtiidment of d eentle
man from Georgia had been under the consideran m i f the
committee, when that gentleman had delibere 1 aphilosoph oil,
historical, admnible discourse upon finance to whuh the
House had li« f-ned w ith creit j leapme, but which o d not in
the remotest mannei relate to the particular motion before the
<*emmnt<iel and had not boon interrupted The chairnan of
■the ( omtnitU t of Ways ■and Me ins himself hid made ¡ «p e h
<he night bnfore upon the same amendment nt the gendeman
iromweoigia, which gave ri^to a dialogue between himself
and a colleague, (Mi Hoffman ) and wf ich induced a di*p ite
which had doubters he «cttíe^ to the entire ^utisfic ion of
both those gentlemen It wis a sknmish instigated by the
piivate personal enmities and p<u*ioiis of the churmii of the
Committee of Ways and Meins himself, and he wis not re
strained by the thur from wandering fiom the subject of
debate while he (Mr *Adams) had been pronounced on' of or
der foi connecting with the subject befoie the committee such
allusions to another bill as tendel to show the nfluence that the
manner in wi rh that bill pa^ed would have upon his vote
(Cries fr m tbe Douse, ' Go on' '   !go on'   ]
Fiom the time ofthepissa^e of the deposite act of Tune K3--,
it was obvious'y the duty of the Secietary of ihe Treasury to
withdiaw liom the bank at Mobile all srmeiftnous dopo lies
, neco-,siry to pay the whole of the four instilments to whieh
othei States weie entitled The supplementary act of T tly

complacency upon hi& vigoious is^idiuty m performing it
And what lias he donei
In the fourth quiuei of 18S0 there was m depo^i'e of public
funds in that bank                                                   si 000,2-10   0
The f mi instalments of the deposi'es piyable to the S ite of
Alabtmiin the \eai 1^37, amounted to $692:115 71
What had the *->ec ctny oi the Ireasury to do Lit t to requi e
of thit bank to credit the Tieismei of the United States with
the four insta'menfs due to the Vate of Mabama as thev became
piyable an I 'here would ha\e yet remained upw uds ol one
hundred thoumnl dollctrs m thitbuil to be tccounted ut
That the secretary himself ur leistool this to be his dt tv is ar
parent from the fact which appears in his repoit i f the 25 h of
September la-t to this House, thr he did actually so piv ofTthe
