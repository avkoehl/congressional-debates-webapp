HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE TENNESSEE,In the Field, May 16, 1863.

Major General F. P. BLAIR,

Commanding Division Fifteen Army Corps:

GENERAL: Move at early dawn toward Black River bridge. I think you will encounter no enemy by the way. If you do, however, engage them at once, and you will be assisted by troops farther advanced. Sherman left Jackson to-day and is moving by forced march. He will join us by 10 a. m. to-morrow, after which you will receive orders from him.

Very respectfully,

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General.

[Indorsement.]

I shall join you as soon as I can in the morning. It is near ten miles to you by the road which I must take. I am near given out, as well as my horse.

WM. D. GREEN,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

April 7, 1863, Seventy-third Indian Volunteers, effective force.......................... 282

----------

Total (nine regiments) ........ 3,050

I would respectfully call the attention of the general commanding to the above list of regiments, taken from my command during the tiem which passed from the 20th of November, 1862, to the 7th of April, 1863. Some of these old and depleted regiments were sent home to recruit and come back, or their places to be supplied by new and full regiments. Not one of those sent to recruit has ever returned, nor has any regiment reported to supply any of their places. I understand these regiments sent to recruit have greatly increased their numbers, and as I have served with them long I would much prefer that they should be ordered back, if practicable, to having new regiment in their places. But this statement is submitted that the commanding general may see to what a very serious extent my command has been diminished within a short time, and with the hope that the commanding general can and will do something to restore my command.

Very respectfully,

T. L. CRITTENDEND.

Major-General, Commanding Twenty-first Army Corps.
