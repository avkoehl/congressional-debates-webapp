night beyond the river (west) near Cox's Bridge. I will move on, reporting from time to time. There are two roads to the left of this, both leading from Goldsborough to Raleigh, one near railroad, the other north of it.

Respectfully,

E. M. LAW,

Brigadier-General.

I have just head from the scouts ahead. They have captured four prisoners from the Fourteenth Corps, who say that they had orders to go to Goldsborough, and the foragers have gone in that direction. They report the Twenty-third, Twenty-fourth, and Twenty-fifth (black) Corps on this side of the Neuse, but none moving this way. The other corps seem to be crossing and going down. Can Sherman be making for Petersburg and Weldon?

Brigadier-General.
