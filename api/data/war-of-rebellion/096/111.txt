CUMBERLAND, January 12, 1865-9.20 a.m.

Major-General CROOK,

Harper's Ferry, Va.:

The following has just been received from Colonel N. Wilkinson, by General Kelley:

I have the following from commanding officer at Philippi, dated 11 last night: "General Rosser made the attack on Beverly with 700 men. It was a complete surprise. Lieutenant Swain, Eighth Ohio Volunteer Cavalry, with ten mounted men, re-entered the town at 10 o'clock, but was driven out by twenty-five rebels. At 12 o'clock he represents the rebels retreating on Staunton pike, and that they fear being cut off by General Torbert. The command at Philippi will start for Beverly this morning, and on arrival will send messenger back with particulars."

N. WILKINSON,

Colonel.

The Thirteenth Virginia has been ordered back and will go into camp.

WINCHESTER, January 12, 1865.

Major-General CROOK,

Cumberland:

I got your dispatch of this morning. Send details as soon as possible.

P. H. SHERIDAN,

Major-General.

CUMBERLAND, January 12, 1865.

Major General CROOK,

Harper's Ferry, Va.:

A telegram from Colonel Wilkinson gives further news. He seems to think that the enemy intend to attack Clarksburg or Grafton, and says he cannot hold those places if attacked by them in force, as his garrisons are small. I have just ordered one of Duval's regiments to go to Grafton, but will stop it until I hear from you. Please answer. This regiment can go up without very great inconvenience, as we have stores in the cars, and it may save some more captures. I wait to hear from you.

ROBT. P. KENNEDY,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
