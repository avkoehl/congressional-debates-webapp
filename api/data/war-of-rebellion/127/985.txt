Captain CALEB HUSE:

(Care of Fraser, Trenholm &amp; Co., Liverpool, England.)

SIR: I have hitherto supposed that Colonel Gorgas, as chief of the Ordnance Bureau, was corresponding with you; but learning that he has not written to you recently, I now take pleasure in assuring you of the full approval of your Government of your conduct in the business intrusted to your charge. The responsibility you have assumed in making purchases of army supplies, not directly authorized by your instructions, is also approved. Your assumption of it under the circumstances was judicious and proper. It has been my aim to keep you fully supplied with funds. I have placed to your credit on-

February 14. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 300,000

In all. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1,261,600

or about 250,000 pounds.

The cargo of the Gladiator has been received in full. It was necessary to reship it in small steamers, which made three separate voyages from Nassau, and it has all reached port safely. Unfortunately the Stephen Hart has been captured, and her cargo has gone to the benefit of the enemy. We are awaiting news of the Economist with great anxiety, and if she has come directly for one of our ports I fear she will be lost. Prudence requires that all cargoes for the Government be sent to some port in the West Indies, and they ought always to go on steamers. Let them be directed to some port in Cuba, to care of our agent, Mr. Helm, and we can get them away with almost entire certainty by breaking bulk there. I wish also to impress upon you the necessity of as much secrecy as possible in your shipment. As fast as possible give us small-arms and cannon-powder, or saltpeter, small-arms, and powder. These are out great needs, and I pray you to spare no effort to send them with all possible dispatch-to the neglect of everything else if necessary.

I am, your obedient servant,

J. P. BENJAMIN,

Secretary of War.

LOUIS HEYLIGER, Esq.,

Nassau, New Providence:

DEAR SIR: I am gratified at being able to inform you of the state arrival of the entire cargo of the Gladiator, thus accomplishing successfully the object of your mission. Your conduct throughout merits the warn approval of the Government. Your dispatch by the Cecile was not received till after the departure of that vessel for Nassau, and your letter by her is not yet at hand, so that I can give no answer to its contents; nor did I get your letters by the Kate in time for reply be any communication known to me. Your yielding to the unjust and extortionate demands of Captain Bird was unavoidable, and has resulted most fortunately, as be it we have secured the cargo, which was beyond all price to us. I have arranged with John Fraser & Co.
