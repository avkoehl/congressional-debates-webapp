LOUISVILLE, KY., December 28, 1862.

Colonel STAGER:

Captain Hewett, commanding at Shepherdville, says he believes he will be attacked before morning. Rebels reported in force in front and on both flanks. Dispatch from Lebanon Junction, 5 p.m., says: "Figth at both trestles; our forces surrendered." A lieutenant of the Ninety-first Illinois, paroled at Elizabethtown, reports Morgan's force 8,000 to 12,000 and six pieces of artillery. Rebels say their destination is this city. Both our lines cut south of Bardstown Junction about 10 p.m. Orders given to evacuate small posts. Stockades concentrated on important points.

MUNFORDVILLE, December 28, 1862.

J. FITCH:

Will send your dispatch through to Louisville. Morgan at Elizabethtown. Colonel Harlan went this morning in pursuit. I fear that he will not be in time. Hope, however, that General Gilbert made some arrangements to meet them, as we were in constant communication until wires were cut north. All well.

Brigadier-General BOYLE,

Louisville, Ky.:

Johnson's cavalry have been ordered to report to you. They have not been fully armed and equipped, but you shall have them as they are. Will try in the morning to secure you some gunboats. Don't understand XVI * conduct, and it must be looked into. Use your authority in the matter, if necessary, without hesitation.

H. G. WRIGHT,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE OHIO,Cincinnati, Ohio, December 28, 1862-1.30 p.m.

Brigadier-General BOYLE,

Louisville, Ky.:

Johnson's cavalry, some 800 strong, may not be fully armed. Have muskets or rifles ready for issue to them on their arrival, if they need them. You had better recall Edwards' regiment, unless you have some especial service for him. He can do nothing by himself, and he will add materially to your force. Don't mind small places; you can't defend them all, and any attempts to do so will involve your being beaten in detail.

H. G. WRIGHT,

Major-General, Commanding.
