HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS,October 8, 1864 - 10.15 a. m. (Received 11.35 a. m.)

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,October 8, 1864 - 11.30 a. m.

Major-General PARKE,

Commanding Ninth Corps:

General Crawford telegraphs at 10.50 a. m. that the left of his line has advanced nearly a mile in front of his present position, and occupies a line of old works of the enemy; that the enemy have a thin line in their works. How is it with your reconnaissance?

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS,October 8, 1864 - 11.30 a. m. (Received 11.40 a. m.)

Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

General Potter reports at 10.15 that his right has considerably advanced; I presume, of course, keeping pace with the left of the Fifth Corps. Potter's center is far ahead of his whole line. Willcox is now sending out from the rebel redoubt; says the enemy's skirmishers fell back before him and now occupy a ridge between the redoubt and Boydton plank road.

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS,October 8, 1864. - 1.15 p. m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS.

Chief of Staff:

Dispatch of 1 p. m. received.* A dispatch from General Willcox of 12.30 p. m. states that he cannot safely advance his right any farther. He has directed General Hartranft to attack the enemy's skirmishers on the left. As soon as I hear the result of this I will direct the return of Willcox, in connection with the Fifth Corps movement. The center of the line occupies such a salient position that it is not safe to advance it unless our left is thrown well around to the northward, but this is not prudent in my opinion. As far as I can judge at present the enemy occupy about the same position as they did when General Mott advanced, although their skirmishers were considerably advanced. The center, a salient point on our extreme northwest, is now on the most favorable found and I will not change it. To the right and left I will make the dispositions directed.

JNumbers G. PARKE,

Major-General.
