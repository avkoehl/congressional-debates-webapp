with us. They will be sent up to-day. Lieutenant Hume conducted the movement skillfully and in a manner which proves him to be a brave and energetic young officer.

I am glad to add that no casualty occurred on our side.

In haste, yours, very respectfully,

J. R. ROBERTSON,

Major, Commanding Cavalry.

SALT SULPHUR SPRINGS, July 11, 1863.

(Received July 12.)

Honorable JAMES A. SEDDON:

A dispatch from Colonel McCausland, just received, informs me that all the enemy's troops on the Kanawha are concentrated in Fayetteville to attack him at Piney, near Raleigh Court-House. He has but two regiments of infantry, two batteries, and four companies of cavalry. The enemy, he reports, has seven regiments of infantry, two regiments of cavalry, and two batteries. Under these circumstances, so much changed since the 20th instant, when I wrote to the President, I have stopped the movement of troops from Lewisbutg to Winchester, which was delayed two days, that I may send re-enforcements to McCausland. Otherwise fear he will be overwhelmed, and the way to the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad open to the enemy. If you disapprove this, please say so.

SAM. JONES,

Major-General.

JULY 12, 1863.

Respectfully submitted for the information of the President.

J. A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War.

Major [GEORGE] JACKSON, Magnolia:

It is reported that enemy intend to raid in Onslow Country, 400 strong. You had better throw your cavalry force in that direction, and notice their movements. They are expected to-night.

Major-General HILL,

Richmond, Va.:

Hurry Colquitt's brigade. If they reach here on time, I will forward some to Charleston. Enemy reported moving in Onslow County. I ought to have troops in that direction. May have to retain one of Clingman's regiments on the Sound road. Beauregard reports capture of south end of Morris Island.

W. H. C. WHITING,

Major-General.
