My express party came in this evening, and I determined to make a night march to the Negrito on the next night. I could not leave this evening, as my guide was very sick and was not fit to travel. Left camp on Rio Bonito on the evening of July 13, with seventy men,and made a night march across the Negrito. Left Lieutenant Haden, with the balance of the command, to follow me in the morning with the pack train. We marched over a very rough country and arrived in sight of the Rio Negrito about 10 p.m. Here Juan [Arroyas], my guide, and myself went on top of a high hill overlooking the course of the river for a great distance, but could discover no fires or others signs. I camped here on the side of the mountain, completely hid from view, until morning. At daybreak we went down to the river, but found no signs of Indians. Waited in the brush all day for the train to come up. Train came in all right. Made camp here for the night. Ordered Lieutenant Martin to take Lieutenant Young and Whittemore, and fifty men,and go up the river for ten or fifteen miles and see if he could find any Indians, and to leave camp next morning at 3 o'clock. For particulars of his scout I would respectfully refer to this report,* herewith submitted. Left camp on Rio Negrito on the morning of July 16, Followed down the river about five miles by a narrow canon and filled with brush and timber. Here took the trail over the mountain to the Francisco or Nutroso. This is a terrible mountain to cross; very rough and rocky. Descending the mountain on the northeast side to the Rio Francisco, saw some very rich looking copper leads cropping out of the ground. Distance here between the two rivers about twenty-two miles. Found water in tanks about half-way between the two rivers. Found no Indian sign on Francisco whatever. Has the appearance of no Indians being there this season. Found no grass at first camp on river. Mules nearly all barefooted and gave out on account of sore feet. Men's shoes worn out, and they very tired. Left camp early in morning of 17th and moved down river about three miles. Came to good grass. Camped to graze animals and rest men. Ordered Captain Frink to take Lieutenant Martin and fifty men, and proceed down the Francisco to its junction with the Gila, and then down the Gila canon and meet me with the balance of the command at the Pueblo Viejo. Broke camp at 5.30 morning of the 18th, Captain Frink and party going down the river. For all the incidents of his march I respectfully refer to his report,* herewith submitted. With the pack train and balance of the command I struck across the country across low rolling hills and came out on the Rio Gila about twenty miles above the mouth of the Francisco, July 19, and marched up the Rio Gila about ten miles and camped. Wood and grass plenty all along river. July 20, marched up river about two miles and then struck across the mountains and came out in Gila at the Pueblo Viejo. This is a very rocky and hard trail to march over. Found water about twelve miles from the pueblo in tanks in the rocks. Day's march thirty miles. Men and mules very tried. Was fourteen hours making this march. Found Captain Frink at the Pueblo Viejo, he having beat us one day. There I was compelled to lie over the 21st to rest my men and mules. From this point I followed down the Rio Gila to this front, where I arrived on the 24th instant, nothing of interest transpiring on the march down the river.

For the distance marched and the direction traveled, I would respectfully refer you to a journal of the trip prepared by First Lieutenant J. B.
