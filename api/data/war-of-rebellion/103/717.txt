Lieutenant General U. S. GRANT,

City Point:

GENERAL: I have the honor to report that last fall the Second Regiment Missouri Cavalry was ordered to report to me. Up to this time only a detachment of four companies have so reported, and a letter from Major General G. M. Dodge, of date February 4, instant, received* informs me that the battalion is now with Major-General Stanley, and that the balance of the regiment has been ordered by General Canby and by Major-General Halleck to join that portion of the command with General Canby. In am relying on this regiment for Major-General Stoneman, and if I obtain it, will be able to give him a storing and good command.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Chief of Staff:

I have not in all my command a general officer so well suited to command the District of Paducah as Brigadier-General Meredith. His administration of affairs there appears to have given universal satisfaction, and I would respectfully request that the honorable Secretary of War will permit him to remain.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General.
