Brigadier General G. H. STEUART,

Commanding Pickett's Division, Nine-Mile Road:

Have Corse's and Terry's brigades ready to march to Richmond at once, to take the cars for Petersburg. Major Taylor, chief quartermaster, will telegraph you at office on Nine-Mile road when the transportation will be ready. When you hear from him, lose no time, as General Lee wishes the troops to arrive by day at Battery Numbers 45, near Petersburg. Have couriers at telegraph office. Hunton will remain where he is. You will accompany the brigades. Answer this at once, so that I may know you received the orders. General Lee will meet you with orders at Dunlop's.

Your own and Terry's brigades will prepare to go at once to Petersburg. Major Taylor will send notice to General Steuart, Nine-Mile road, when the transportation will be ready. You will have a courier kept at that office to receive his dispatch. As soon as you are notified you will lose no time, but get your brigade to the depot promptly. General Lee wishes no time to be lost. Orders will meet you at Dunlop's from General Lee. Similar orders to these were sent to General Steuart, under the impression he had returned. Reply to this dispatch so that I may know you received and understand the order.
