May 6, 1862.

Colonel D. H. RUCKER,

Quartermaster:

What is McDowell doing with so many boats in the Rappahannock? Can't some of them be ordered here and to Perryville? We are moving troops by water to West Point, and want everything we can obtain. Besides, we have now 2,500 sick and wounded soldiers to be sent by water to hospitals. We have had a pretty severe fight and whipped the enemy handsomely. Hancock's brigade acted splendidly. Our cavalry used their sabers.
