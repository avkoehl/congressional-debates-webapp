After passing the night on the battle-field we were marched back in the woods north of the battle-field, and lay in line of battle until about 12 o'clock Friday, the 29th. We then changed positions, and with the brigade maneuvered about for some time, and finally took a position behind a fence not far from the old railroad, where a body of the enemy were advancing in front. They being soon driven back, the Fourth, with the brigade, was marched to the rear and remained until morning. The loss in the regiment on Friday, the 29th, was light.

On Saturday, the 30th, the Fourth, with the brigade, engaged the enemy at the old railroad, in which a heavy fight ensued. The regiment acted most gallantly in diving the enemy from a very advantageous position. We entered this engagement with less than 100 men, and lost-killed and wounded. As the surgeon has condensed the 29th and 30th together, I cannot tell of either day separate. In the two days the loss in killed and wounded was 21.

The position occupied by the regiment was the right center of the brigade in the battle of the 28th. I believe that 65 men were present and participated in the battle. The loss was 4 killed and 24 wounded.
