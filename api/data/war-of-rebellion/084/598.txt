General FISK:

A band of sixteen were robbing near West Ely yesterday, among them Major Snyder, Captains Kinkard and Frost, and probably Hughes. Our men went out last night, but I have little expectation of catching them.

Proceed at once to Olathe and relieve Lieutenant-Colonel Hoyt of his duties. Lieutenant-Colonel Hoyt will again assume command on his return to Olathe. Keep up a continuous scouting.

Send Company F, Fifteenth [Kansas Cavalry], Captain Curtis commanding, to take up station at Coldwater Grove, with five days' rations in haversacks; no other equipage or transportation.
