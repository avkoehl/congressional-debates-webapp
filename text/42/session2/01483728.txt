Mr. THURMAN. I make a point of order.
We are still in the session of Tuesday. This
bill was introduced this day. The point of
order is that the bill cannot be read the third
time to-day—cannot be read the second time
even.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill
has been read twice.
Mr. THURMAN. I make the point of order
that it cannot be read the third time to-day.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair
sustains the point of order.
Mr. CARPENTER. We have not reached
that point of order yet.
Mr. THURMAN. The point, of order be-
ing made you cannot pass the bill beyond its
third reading.
Mr. CA RPBNTEll. Your point of order
is not going to prevent its consideration.
Mr. THURMAN. You cannot pass it to-
day, and there is no use in taking it up.
Mr. EDMUNDS. We want to consider it
to order it to a third reading.
Mr. HAMILTON, of Maryland. Has the
bill been printed?
The PRESIDING OFFICER. It has not
been printed.
Mr. CARPENTER. It is printed as an
amendment lo another bill. I move to lay
this bill on the table.
Mr. CASSERLY. I make a point of order.
Can that be done ? That bill lias not been
read a third time.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Certainly,
the motion is in order at any time.
Mr. CARPENTER. The bill is before the
Senate.
The PRESIDING OFF1CKR. The bill is
before the Senate by order of the Senate and
a motion is mads to lay the bill on the table,
which does not admit, of debate. [Putting the
question.] That motion is carried, and the
bill is laid on the table.
Mr. CARPENTER. I move now the Sen-
ate proceed to the consideration of the bill
numbered one on the Calendar, which is Senate
bill No. 99, supplementary to an act entitled
"An act to protect all citizens of the Uni-
ted States in their civil rights, and to furnish
means for their vindication," passed April 9,
1866.
Mr. THURMAN, (at five o'clock and fifty
minutes a. m.) I move that the Senate do

So the Senate refused to adjourn.
Mr. DAVES, of West Virginia. What is
the stage of the bill now before the Senate?
The PRESIDING OITFICER. The ^question
is on taking up this bill for consideration*
Mr. DAVIS, of West Virginia. And the
former bill has been laid on the table?
The PRESIDING OFFICER. It has been.
Mr. CASSERLY. Let the bill be read for
information.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion
is to take up the bill, to proceed to its con-
sideration.
Mr. CASSERLY. I make a point of order.
I have always understood that a bill may be
read for information. How are we to know
what the bill is?
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill has
not been taken up.
Mr. CASSERLY. But a Senator always
has a right, 1 respectfully submit, to have a
bill read before he is called to vote on taking
it up. It has always been done.
Mr. EDMUNDS. It is done by unanimous
consent.
Mr. CHANDLER. I object.
Mr. CARPENTER. The bill is not be-
fore the Senate and cannot be read until it is
taken up.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. It may be
read by its title.
Mr. CASSERLY. What is the pending
motion ?

is to proceed to the consideration of the bill.

tion on the table.

So the amendment was not agreed to.
_ The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ques-
tion is on taking up the hill.
Mr. DAVJS, ot West Virginia, (atsixo'clock
and two minutes a. m.) I move that the Senate
adjourn.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator
from West Virginia moves that the Senate do
now adjourn.
Mr. CASSERLY. I call for the yeas and
nays.
The yeas and nays were ordered.
Mr. CARPENTER. I m'ove that the Ser-
geant-at-Arms be requested to notify the
absent Senators to attend the session of the
Senate immediately.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. No motion
can be entertained until the result of the roll-
call is announced.
Mr. CHANDLER. Let the absentees be
called.
Mr. CASSERLY. I call for the announce-
ment of the vote.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The vote
will be read.
The Secretary read the list of votes—yeas

of Vermont, Nye, Osborn, Patterson, Pomeroy,

Logan, Morton, Norwood, Ramsey, Ransom, Rice,
Schurz, Sherman, Stevenson, Stewart, Stockton,
Sumner, Thurman. Tipton, Trumbull, West, and
Windom—37.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. On the
motion to adjourn the yeas are 8, and the nays
are 29. The Senate'refuses to adjourn, but
the vote discloses the lack of a quorum.
Mr. CARPENTER. No quorum is neces-
sary on a question of adjournment.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. But the call
of the roll shows that there is no quorum vot-
ing. The motion is lost, but the vote discloses
the lack of a quorum.
Mr. CARPENTER. I move that the Ser-
geant-at-Arms be directed to invite absent
members to attend the sessions of the Senate
immediately.
Mr. DAVIS, of West Virginia. On that I
aek for the yeas and nays.
Mr. SAULSBURY. I move to lay that
motion on the table.
Mr. CHANDLER. Let the absentees be
called.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator
from Delaware moves to lay the motion,on the
table.
Air. CARPENTER. I withdraw ray motion.
Mr. CONKLING. I ris-'e to a question of
order. My point of order is that the roll-call
having disclosed the absence of a quorum, no
business is in order except to adjourn or to
send for absent Senators, and that the motion
of the Senator from Delaware is therefore out
ot order.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sena-
tor from Wisconsin has withdrawn the motion,
and it is not before the Senate.
Mr. CONKLING. 1 suggest to the Senator
that he need not have withdrawn his motion,
because the motion to lay on the table is not
in order.
The PRESIDING 'OFFICER. The Chair
entertains the point ot order of the Senator
from New York, but the Senator from Wiscon-
sin has withdrawn his motion.
Mr. CARPENTER. I move that the ab-
sentees be called.
Mr. THURMAN. Does the Chair decide
that it is not in order to move to lay that mo-
tion on the table?
The PRESIDING OFFICER. That motion
is in order.
Mr. THURMAN. A motion to send for
absentees may be laid on the table?
Mr. CARPEN TER. Oh, no; you cannot
do that.
Mr. CASSERLY. I inquire whether the
motion to send the Serjeant-at-Arms is in
order until we have a call of the Senate.
Mr. CARPENTER. My present motion is
for a call of the absentees.
Lhe PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion
of the Senator from Wisconsin is that the ab-
sentees be called.
Mr. DAVIS, of West Virginia. Pending
that, is a motion to adjourn in order?
The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is.
Mr. DAVIS, of West Virginia. I move
that the Senate adjourn.
Mr. CONKLING. I rise to a question of
order. Was not the last vote taken on a
motion to adjourn, and no business has inter-
vened ? _ I submit to the Chair that business
has not intervened. When that one thing has
been done which the Constitution says may be
done with less than a quorum, that is to pro-
ceed fc> ascertain who the absentees are, sup-
pose it turns out that there is a quorum in the
Chamber, that Senators have occupied their
seats and have not voted, although their names
were called, we have the right to know how
