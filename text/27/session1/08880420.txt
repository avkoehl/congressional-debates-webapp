«•intact with the United States    Butldo most deeply íegret tc
«e0 «.hat party spirit is seekma to possess itself, for sinister put
r oses, ofthe patriotic feeling of the counuy, and Isa   to the
Opposition that if they think to make any thing of this, m a
party point of view, they will fird themselves deplorably mis
taken    Gentlemen of the Opposition' will you undertake, by
speeches here, impeaching the patriots n of the Adm'mstra
tion, m its management of our relations with England, to stiniu
late and madden the people of the United States into a war fe
vei against England?   I say to you, do this ll you dare *   Do it
at your peril' For in who«e control are the issues of war and
^eacel   In yours, or in ours"?   Is it not we who, if we hold m
one hand the olive branch of peace, yet grasp in the other the
thunderbolt of war, to be hurled bv us against the enemies of
our country, whensoever the time foi action shall arrive?   Is it
not the Government oftheTjniteel States which, like the old Ro
man ambassador, may, at its will, shake forth from Us íobesttie
tempest of war, or diffuse through tke land the tranquil mflu
«enees of peace?   You may, if you choose drive the country into
a. wai, and the moment you do so, you rendei this Administra
tion peimanentandall poweiful, and conveit yourselves into a
wre ched humble, insignificant faction, matead oí continuing to
be a constitutional Opposition You would be, insm h an event,
forced by the necessities of the case—) ou would be impelled by
your own patiiotism to snppoit the Government of yum coun
try, and by such a course of opposition you would do more than
by all other causes combined to strengthen andconsohdite the
present Administration, and to fix it in the favor ard t-upport of
the people of the United States
Hating deposed of these incidental questions, I propose
next to discus* the meats of the controversy
Mr Morgan ofNew York suggesting that it wanting but a
few minutes of the hour of adjournment, on his motion, the
House adjourned
Triday, June 25, 1841
.The House resuming the consideration of the resolution   of
Mr   Floyd, in continuation  of the  debate yesterday, Mr
CUSHINGsaid
In the hasty remarks on this subject, which I submittel to
the House yesterday, I commented on the general spmt of the
speech oí the gentleman fiom Pennsylvania, [Mr Inger'oll ]
«ndon sundry incidental tópico introduced into the speech ot
fttót gentleman I reviewed al*>o the foieign policy o Mr \ an
Bulen, moie especially in relation to Great Britain, beginning
with the notonous instructions oí Mr Van BirentoMr Mc
Lane, hi# firot great act a Secretary otante, and tracing the
subject dewn to the close of his Admmistiation as Piesithntof
the United Sutes I endeavored also to exl ibit to the House
the party consequence  to the present Opposition of an attempt
on their pan to stimulate the war feeling of the people of the
United States, and showed that any such attempt could not but
operate eventually to consolidate the power of the present Ad
ministration, in whose hands the issue of wai or peace must of
necessity rest I now propose to discuss the merits of the ques
uon before the House
When I thus speak of the merits, I do not mean the merits
of the case of Alexander McLeod, but the merits of the discus
«ion pending, and of the concerted attack on the foreign policy
of the Administration, undertaken by the Opposition in both
Houses of Congress X shall avoid to day. as I did yestarday,
the points debated m the Senate It would he idle for me to
re argue the particular things which have been discussed theie
ao fully, ably, and tnumphantly, by eminent Seuaiois To do
so would be
"To gild refined gold, to paint tin  lí v
Or add a perfume to the violet

the actsof (heSecietaiy of s ate My puiposc on the contra

to show lhat, if not the object, yet the tendency and end of their
course is to substitute foi the true i^ue between theUnted
States and Great Bri ain a false one, to play into the hai hef
England, to foice the Government of the Unite 1 State if they
may, to abandon the impregnable loitiess of light an 1 to
duve the country to the edge of a piec pi^e urwh h il the

something in the particular en cumstances of the case of the
Caroline to take it out ofthe general principles of national
right, that attack was wholly unjustifiable, andconfeis on the
