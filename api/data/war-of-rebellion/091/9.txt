(Received 8.15 p. m.)

E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

Have just returned from front. The enemy yesterday evening drove Averell from Martinsburg, then retired in direction of Bunder Hill. Yesterday evening and to-day they were found in force between Berrywille and Winchester. The best information to be obtained at front indicates the enemy still in force at Bunker Hill. There is no evidence of their having retired any of their forces down the Valley, except through rebel sources.

The developments of the cavalry on both flanks last night and to-day controverts the conclusion that the enemy are giving up the Valley. Torbert is pressing his reconnaissance in the direction of Winchester this evening,the enemy holding the opposite side of the opequon Creek in force.

JOHN D. STEVENSON,

Brigadier-General.
