Lieutenant-Colonel BLACKBURN:

I send you a true copy of a dispatch that General Van Cleve has just received from General Milroy:

One hundred and fifty rebel cavalry crossed the railroad, half a mile north of this place, at 12 o'clock last night. They captured two of the Fifth Tennessee Cavalry, who got away after crossing the railroad, and said there was a rebel general with them who had been cut off from Hood and was trying to go through East Tennessee. Can't you send word to Blackburn to cut them off about McMinnville. The Fifth are all out west.

You will carry out the above instructions.
