Captain and Assistant Quartermaster.
HEADQUARTERS ARMIES OF THE UNITED STATES,City Point, Va., June 16, 1864.

Mr. O'BRIEN,

Chief Operator, Hdqrs. Dept. of Virginia and North Carolina:

DEAR SIR: General Grant directs that a line be constructed from these headquarters to General Butler's headquarters, and an office opened here as soon as possible. He also orders the construction of a line from General Meade's headquarters, and as Mr. Caldwell is short of operators, perhaps you have one or two to spare. I think Doren is at work down from Fort Powhatan, but have not heard to-day. Please let me know when you can complete the line to this place, and how you are off for operators.

Yours,

S. H. BECKWITH.
