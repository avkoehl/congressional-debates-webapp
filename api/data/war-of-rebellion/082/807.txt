General R. E. LEE,

Petersburg, Va.:

General Ewell reports General Kershaw to have been driven back this morning, with loss of four pieces of artillery, by heavy force of enemy. General Ewell has called out the local troops. The best information I can get reports the enemy to consist of at least a division, with twenty-two pieces of artillery. General Ewell states prisoners have been taken from Hancock's, the Tenth, and Nineteenth Corps. You are doubtless informed more fully. I telegraph only to guard against possible omission or miscarriage.

J. A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War.

General R. E. LEE,

Near Petersburg, Va.:

Such embarrassment results from calling out the local troops that the President prefers the call should not be made till further advices or greater appearance of danger.

Secretary of War.
