then whether the Governor had any authority to
order an election.
In the second section of the first article of the
Constitution of the United State"  is found the
clause which is the fruitful theme of this prolonged
debate
" When vacancies happen in the representation
from any State, the Executive authority thereof
shall issue writs of election to fill ¡s ich v acancies "
It is agreed on ad hands that this clause is not a
dead letter, but that it confers some powei ot some
kind upon the Governors of States, but it is argued
that the power extends only to issuing writs of
election to fill vacancies which "happen," and
much subtle refinement ib resorted to in order to
draw the line of distinction bet «sen those which
do, and those w hich do not, "happen" And it is
further said that the term " vacancy" is not appli-
cable to the condition of the representation from
a State when the period of sen ice of former mem-
bers has expired, and before the election of their
successors With regard to the Pist position, I
will not repeal the conclusive lexicography of the
gentleman from Virginia, (Mr Pennybacker,) but
content myself with saying that it certainly has
not been, or I believe attempted to be, answered
If the meaning of words is to be judged of by
authority, the books which he has produced conclu-
sively show that the word " happen" expresses a
genus of which " chance" is only a species No
matter what mav be the cause of the vacancy
whether it has occurred bv "chance" or "design,"
or the expiration of a term of service, the generic
word equally includes it, and those who framed
the Constitution could not, by the most assiduous
study, have discovered a word more comprehensive
in its signification than the precise one which they
adopted I leave this branch of the argument
where that honorable gentleman placed it, deeming
it impossible either to make it more clear 01
refute it
But it is said, also, that there was no " vacancy"
in the representation from Mississippi, that a va-
cancy can take place only when a member elect
dies, or resigns, or removes, and that it can not be
created by the expiration of a term of service Por
this limitation of the meaning of the word, no
grammatical auihonty is adduced, but it rests upon
the arbitrary assertion of those w ho so construe it
I should rather define " vacancy" to mean the ab-
sence of something which ou^ht to be ticie The
limited meaning which is given to it is contrary to
common sense, and indeed, no grammatical defini-
tion of it has been attempted to be given All that
is said is, that this case is not included within it
Let us suppose that the resolution of the minority
should be passed to-day, and that, on to-morrow,
when no person was in the occupancy of the chairs
which are now so worthily filled by th two gentle-
men from Mississippi an inquirer should ask of
the gentleman from Ohio, for example, where was
the delegation from Mississippi, he would be bound
to reply, as he has said in his argument, there is
no "vacancy"m the representation from that State
But the incredulous interrogator would proceed
there is nobody in those chairs, and tney aie ap-
propriated to the use of that delegation Still my
learned fnend would be obliged to insist upon it,
that there was no vacancy m that representation
It is true, he would say, that Mississippi has no
members upon this floor in those chairs, or any
where else, but I tell jou there is no vacancy, be-
cause she elected members to the last Congress, and
has not elected any to tms, therefore, there is no
vacancy Do you not perceive, mi, that this is the
inevitable result of the argument upon ihe oppo-
site side1 Because, if there was no vacancy when
the Govrnor issued his proclamation, there is none
now, and yet, see how impossible it is to convince
the eyes of the truth of the argument addressed to
the ears I say, therefore, that this consiruction of
the Constitution is contrary to common sense, how-
ever stronglv it maj' be supported by techmcalitie ,
and I am no advocate for adopting refined and
scholastic subtleties as the proper means of inter-
preting an instrument which was intended to be
understood by plain men m legulatmg the business
of life.
I wish, however, to refei you to the journal of

TO THE CONGRESSION
Mississippi Election—Mr. Howard.
the Convention which framed the constitution, m
order to show that the meaning which we now give
to the clause which I have quoted, is the one which
they attached to it, when it received the assent of
that distinguished body But before I do this, let
me refer v ery br efly to the opinions of two gentle-
men of acknowledged talents who have, at differ-
ent periods, filled (he office of Attorney General,
as there is an entire harmony between the conclu-
s ons which they have draw n from a cautious
inspection of the Constitution as it is written, and
the designs of those who made it, as mim'ested by
the history of their proceedings I propose to
touch very summarily upon these opinions, be
cause other gentlemen have examined them more
fully, and I desire to avoid the repetition of what
has been already, and no doubt bettei, «aid In
October, 1823, and July, 1832, cases occurred m
the admimstiation of the Executive authontj,
which drew from those who occupied, at those
times, the situation of Attorney General of the
United States, elaboiate opinions upon the con-
struction of that part of tne constitution which
empowers the President " to fill up all vacancies
that may happen during the recess of the Semte "
It will at once be peiseued that there is a strong
analogy, although not a perfect identity, between
the meaning of this word " happen," m this clause
ot the Constitution, and the one which we aie con-
sidering, because, under both, the argument is,
that a case where there is no incumbent in office,
owing to the expiration of a term, is not included
withm either clause But Mr Wirt says, " The
substantial purpose of the Constitution was to keep
these offices filled, and powers adeauate to this
purpose were intended to be conveye ] But if the
President (and the remark is equally applicable to
the Governor of a State) shall not hav e the po ^ cr
to fid a vacancy thus circumstanced, the powers
are inadequate to the purpose, and the substance
of the Constitution will be sacrificed to a dubious
construction of its letter "
He comes to the conclusion, that if the vacancy
is found to exist, the constitutional powei of p"o-
viding for its being fitted is immediately applicable,
and adds
" This seems to me the only conduction of the
Constitution which is compatible w th its ipait,
reason and purpose, while, at the same tine, it
offers no viol'mc* to its language, and these, I
think, are the governing points to which all sound
construction looks "
Mr Taney, in 1832, concurred in opinion with
his predecessor, without knowing, however, that
Mr Wirt had expressed it, because it was not nr-
til he had prepared his own, that an examination
into the files of the office resulled in the discover]
that Mr Wirt had been called upon by the fhea
President for an opinion m a similar c«e
Mr Taney says
" The w ords used in the Constitution do not, I
thmk, by anj fair consttuction, requne a distinc-
tion to be taken It was intended to provide for
tho e v acancies which might anse from accident,
and the contingencies to wh ch human affairs must
always be liable And if it falls out i'iDt fiom
death, inadvertence, or mistake, an office icauiied
by law to be filled, is, m the recess, found to be
vacant, then a vacancy has happened n the recess,
and the President may fill it This appeals to be
the common sense and natural import of" the w oi ds
used They mean the same linn* as f the ConHiai-
tion had said 'if time happen to he any vacnneus
during the recess ' "
I propose now to show that ti e fi neis of the
Constitution intended to attach thisiiKai n? to the
kindred clause which is to govim  i m I'l-ioi in
the case before us, and this intention is lo Le d i\ n

wg They first settled general principles in com-
mittee of the whole, and then appointed five of their
body to re\ ise the style of the articles agreed Up-
on, but without alteration of the meaning, and to
arrange them under proper heads This was the
extent of th nr duty The committee consisted of
Mr Johnston, Mr Hamilton, Mr G Moms, Mr.
Madison, and Mr King, who reported the revised
draft on the 12th of September, 1787, which con-
timed the clause m the first article, word for word
as we non find it m the Constitution, viz
" When vacancies happen m the representation
from any State, the Executive authority thereof
shall issue writs of election to fill such vacan-
cies "
The argument of the friends of the minority re-
port of the Committee of Elections is, that thts is
a conditional grant of power or imposition of duty
upon the E tecutive authority of a State, taking
effect onlj when vacancies "happen," and not ap-
plying to a case w here a vacancy is created by the
expira ion of a term of service, as it can not then
be slid to " happen," it not being the work of
chance or accident I find, on looking over the
jorrnal, thit when the convention was employed
in sett'ing the principU which they meant to esta-
blish, on the 6 th of August, they expressed it m these
words
" Vacancies in the House of Representatives
shall be supplied by writs of election fiorn the
Executive authority of the States m the representa-
tion from which thev shall happen "—Elliott's De-
bates on Federal Constitution, vol 1, page 256
Every one must see at once that the only diffe-
íence between these two sentences is, that the latter
excludes the construction which the friends of the
minority repoit wsh to apply to the former, and
tnat this vexed article is made to express the very
idea which Mr Wirt and Mr Taney contended
should be applied to another clause upon the same
subject, coinciding precisely with the interpretation
which those who thmk with me allege should be
placed upon it. Without resorting to a strict gram-
matical analysis, every unprejudiced mind would
agree at once, as it seems to me, that the original
draft meant to provide for filling up all vacancies,
no matter fiom what cause, or when they might
oceui, and this inference is ímpregnably fortified by
a closei eximmat on Top wo-d "when," which
is considered as diawing after it a limitation of
piwer by admitting only a certain class of cases,
and excluding others, is not found in the first draft,
and the word "happen" is detached from the ím-
portanf noun " vacancies," whose comprehensive
meaning it is said to control, and made to assume
an humble and merely explanatoiy duty I repeat
that the idea intended to be advanced by the fra-
meis of the Constitution is found in the original
draft, for I find that the committee of five were
anpom ed "ioretu.se the style of, and anange, the
ai heles agreed to by the House,'" and I can not find
that, m a si igle instance, they departed from this
s^cfin 1" 3 duty No fault appears to have been
found w ith l^cm on account of any aberration from
the 1>ripcipVs wn ch the convention had pieviotisly
alonfd and, in fact, they had only to paint and
furnish th" House which had been built, without
interftr ng with the order of its aichitecture I
hold that, as statesmen, we are net only at liberty,
but bounl, to follow the intentions of those who
prepaied the Constitution, and thmk that they are
sufficiently manifest, from the authority which I
ha e adduced
Whilst upon the subject of authority, I beg leave
to refer to on" quoted bv the honorable gentleman
