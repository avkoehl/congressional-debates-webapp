There is, fi&Qfher item of increase of the
present 1duty provided for in the bill before us
whiqji Will operate witt peculiar hardship upon
the 'farmers of the country, First, the duty
upon stgeh The diity levied upon most kinds
of steel in use is 2J cents per pound ; the cost
of this steel in England is 3} cents per pound;
consequently the present rate of duty is 70 per
cent. It is proposed to increase this duty to
3i cents per pound, a sum equaling the first
cost pf the steel. The cost of importing, in
other words the rate of protection on the fol-
lowing grades of §teel, equal 86 per cent.
Subjoined is a detailed statement showing
the cost on one ton each of the different grades
of ordinary spring, Swedes, and cast spring
steel, tire, toe eorjk, sleigh-shoe, plo>w, plow-
molds, cultivator, and blister steels to the
manufacturer in England:

Mr. KELLEY. Poes not the proposed rato
on steel make a very large reduction V
Mr. COOK. Not on the particular qualities
of which I am speaking, if I understand the
bill.
Mr. KJ3LL,EY. I am speaking of cast steel.
Grades of steel that have hitherto paid 3}
cents a pound and 10 per cent, ad valorem are
reduced to cents a pound.
Mr. COOK. I understand that the rate on
duty proposed upon the steel used in the man-
ufacture of the agricultural implements of the
country is 3J cents per pound.
Mr. KELLEY. The rate proposed is 3J
cents per pound on all steel. Hitherto a large
part paid 3 J cents a pound and 10 per cent, ad
valorem, so that there is a reduction of 10 per
cent, ad valorem, and a quarter of a cent a
pound.
Mr. COOK. If it was too high under the
old tariff, and is not materially modified in this
bill, the objection which I make to it is good.
I am arguing that the protection which is im-
pose)! by the present tariff is unjust to the
agricultural interests of the country. _ At 3i
oe.nts per- pound the cost of importing. the
above grades of steel will equal 117 per cent,
of their cost. That such a rate of duty is not
needed ean be shotfn by the evidence of the
steel-naSkers themselves. I quote from the
memorial addressed to Congress January 1,
18&7, and signed by all • of the steel-makers
then in the United States. The manufacture
of steel in this country became an assured suc-
cess as early as 1859, The duty was then abQut
12 per cent, ad valorem; this rate was increased
seme 300 or 400 per cent, by the tariff of 1861
and 1862.
The steel-makers sent us a memorial, stating
that these figures had been agreed upon by
the representatives of foreign and American
manufactures before the Committee of Ways
and Means as being well adapted to the exist-
ing state of steel.manufacture in this country."
They also told us that the object of the increase
of duty in 1862 was. to compensate the steel-
maker for the internal tax> which in all equaled
2J cents per pound, They further stated in
their memorial that under this rate of duty
'1 the American, manufacture of steel had at-
tained from 1859 to the commencement of the
rebellion very considerable efficiency, and dur^
iqg the succeeding four years made rapid prog-
ress, competing successfully with the best'Eng-
lish, which had previously enjoyed a monopoly
of the market. When the internal tax was 2£
cents per pound (see steel-makers' memorial,
annexed to Revenue Commissioner's report
for 1865 and 1866, page 342) the steel-makers
got all that they asked for ; they got a rate of
duty which they say was "well adapted to the
condition of the manufactures of this country,"
and under which they say the American manu-
factures made rapid progress, competing suc-
cessfully with the best English brands; and
now where the internal tax has been wholly
removed they iisk the following increase of
rates;

Why should there be such an increase of duty
now when the tax is remoyed and the cost of
production is greatly reduced ? The whole is
iu the interest of a small number of manufac-
turers, who. seek to increase enormously their
profits by legislation. This change proposed
will largely decrease the revenue and largely
increase the price of steel manufactures, so that
for every dollar paid into the Treasury many
dollars will be paid .by the people in the in-
creased price of an article of universal con-
sumption.
The cost of transporting grain from the val-
ley of the Mississippi to the sea-board ia a bur-
den upon the agriculturists of that portion of
the country. _ Any legislation whieh makes that
.nirden heavier is wrong and unjust. We com-
pete in the markets of the world with the graia-
growing countries of Europe—Russia and Hun-
gary.' That competition becomes ruinons to the
American farmer when the cost of transport-
ation is much greater to him than the cost of
transporting the grain grown in Europe to its
market. But what is the fact? The following
statement will show the comparative cost of
operating railroads in Great Britain and the
State of New York :

Ihe cost of what is termed locomotive service in
England por milo run is as follows: fuel. 3.42 cents;
wages of engineer and firemen, 2.98 5 wages of clcaners
and eokemen, 0.60; oil and waste. 0.56: cost of re-
pairs and renewal of engines, 6.48; water service,
0.3G; salaries and superintendence, 0.32; gas, rates, fire
charges, <fcc., 0.26; total, 15.30 cents.
"The items that make up the total cost per mile
run on English railways is as follows: maintenanco
of locomotivo servicc, 15.30 cents; way, 12.70; cars,
6.7t; traffic charges, 1.82; general charges, 5.48; com-
pensation, 0.90; rent of cars, 0.3S; working joint
lines, 1.08; general office expenses, 1.24; rates and
taxes,2.?0; Government duty, 2,24; other items, 0.G2;
total, 03.62 cents."
IIow is this enormous difference in the cost
of transportation caused ? The present duty
on steel rails, which are rapidly superseding
iron rails on first-class roads, is 45 per cent.
ad, valorem, which is 1 cent per pound; the
other charges of importation carries it up to
65 per cent, ad valorctq. This bill makes the
duty 2 Gents per pound, or nearly 100 percent.
ad'valorem, tho cost of manufacture being
Sj?48 50 per ton of 2,240 pounds gross. If any-
thing should be wholly exempted from the bur-
den of taxation it is the material that enters into
the cost of transportation. Steel rails can be
made for about 2 cents per pound; they last
twelve times as long iron rails, and the cost
of transportation can be greatly reduced bv
their use. Should this bill become a law they
would not be impoited or used tp any very
great extent, and thus the great cost of trans-
portation, the chief burden of the western
farmer, be fastened more firmly upon him.
Instead of taking off the duties fiom the
articles I have named to tlje extent to which it
is admitted that the amount of revenue to bo
derived from tariff ought to ho reduced, it ia
proposed by this bill to add to the duty'upon
the cheaper qualities of lumber, those kinds
which are most indispensable for the use of the
inhabitants of a prairie country; to leave salt
and coal as at presprjfc taxed, and to reduce
the duty on pig-iron $2 per ton, leaving the bur-
den so heavily borne by the agricultural inter-
ests of the country comparatively untouched.
The amount by which the tariff is proposed to
be reduced is to be taken off from tea, sugar,
and coffee. Every dollar collected from the
people upon these articles goes directly to the
Government, and it is a burden upon the peo-
ple to the extent of $1 only, while the duty
upon lumber has to be psjid many times over,
once to the Government and many times to
the capitalist engaged iu its manufacture; and
so the price ha.s been forced pp from less than
§7 per thousand upon a mean average to §27
per thousand.
The Government last year received $1,300,-
000 duties on lumber and timber. How much
