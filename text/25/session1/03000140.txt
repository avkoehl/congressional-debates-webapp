~25th Cong.....1st Sf.ss.                                     Making public officer? depositories—Mr. Moore______________________________H. of.Reps.
for  an act of incorporation,   granting   to   them
and to their successors and  assigns for ever, the
sole and exclusive right, extending to all the States
in the Union, of smelting iron ore with anthracite
coal, and of manufacturing the same.   The me-
morialists set forth in their petition the immense
benefits that would result to the nation fiom their
contemplated enterprise.   They dwell upon  the
advantages incident to associated capital, and con-
centrated wisdom and industry.   They represent
that the  mining interest of  the country  would
be   benefitted   in   proportion to   the   extent   of
the monopoly—inasmuch as the products of the
iron and coal mines would ever find a ready mar-
ket at  the company's works; that the public m
general would be enabled to obtain the manufac-
tured articles at a much cheapei rate, and of a
better quality, and that, m time of war, arms and
ordnance could be furnished with greater facility,
and of superior temper and calibre.    Trie States,
notwithstanding all these plausible representations,
remonstrate—individuals remnnstiate.    The St ites
urge   that the   grant would   be a   violation  of
their reserved rights, and the pnnciple upon wh'ch
the Union was founded, and demand ot Congress
the source whence the power is  derived to grant
such   cha'tei   of   mcoiporation'    Congress   veiy
complacently   point   them   to ihe   potent   words
"common   defence   and   general   welfare,"   and
the thing is settled.    Individuals represent,   tV.it
an equality of civil and political rights constitute
the bas'S   of  purely  democratical   governments;
that none but equal laws can legitimately flow jrom
the principle of equal rights;  and that all laws,
■which mvade that principle, conflict with the spi-
rit of our institutions, and are, to all intents and
purposes, legislative frauds upon the rights of the
people, and, consequent!), uticily destitute of con-
stitutional sinclion     The} ím'íiei show, that an
exercise of power, such as asked for by the peti-
tionee, would confer  exclusive   privileges   and
legislative favors—infringe on their natural and
political rights—violate   the sacred principles of
justice and political equality, and, for this reason,
be clearly unconstitutional.   But Congress, regard-
less of the truth and propriety of these representa-
tions, grant the chartei of incorporation, and when
called upon to show their constitutional right to do
so, triumphantly refer to the magical words " com-
mon defence and general welfare," and there the
matter ends     I have put this case fui the purpose
of illustrating  the  evils  consequent   upon an as-
sumption of powei, such as contended /oi by those
who maintain that  the c'auce wc  have been ex-
amining authonzes Congiess to establish a iedeial
bank.    And, as legislator are as much "subject to
infirmities as othei men, and the world not having,
as yet, approached  that desirable state of which
Plato dreamed—" the peifeetibility of man"—-it is
not only possible, but veiy probable, that ci es of
this kind might frequently happen     Nor can those
who contend foi   the pnnciple uluch  merges all
power in the words " common defence and general
welfare," or, what amounts to the same thing—m
the w ill of Congress—object to any case coming
withm that principle, however dangerous and per-
nicious in its consequences.    As this clause of the
Constitution has been, ana is still, mach íelied on
by the advocates ot  a United States Bank, 1 will
take the hheity of introducing such authority in
opposition to their views, as will, I  trust, have
weigh:, both with this house and the nat on     The
fbmth resolution passed bv the General Assembl}
of Virginia, in December, 179S, reads as follows*
"Tb.it the General Asscmbh doth atso txpiess us deep

And here, sir, I think I may safely rest this pait
of the subject.
The second paragraph of the 8th sect.on of Ihe
Constitution, which vests in Congress the power "¡o
borrow money on the credit ot the United States,"
has also been appealed to by the iriends oi' a na-
tional bank.    But as nothing like an argument has
ever been adduced m support of this position, as it
rests upon mere  conjecture, without the shadow
of authority to support it, and as a bill to charter
a bank is not a bill to borrow money, I will not
trouble the committee with any further remarks on
this point, but proceed to examine the  third para-
graph of the 8th section of the Constitution, winch
gives Congress the power "To regulate commerce
with foreign nations, among the several States, and
\\ ith the  Indian  tubes."    This clause has been
appealed to by the advocates of internal improve-
ments, as authorizing Congress to construct roads
and canals, &c ; it has also been appealed to by
the friends of  the  tariff system,   as   vesting  in
Congress   an   implied  power   to protect our do-
mestic   manufactures;   and   lastly,   it   has   been
appealed   to,   as   authorizing   Congress   to esta-
blish a United   States   Bank.    Now, sir, in my
humble opinion, the power to  regúlale coinmerce,
does not  include the power to make internal im-
provements of the character just noticed—to pro-
tect manufactures by imposing a tariff—nor to esta-
blish a national  bank.    Neither the clunse imme-
diately under consideration, nor any other foand in
the Constitution, authorizes Congress, in my judg-
ment, to do either of those three things.   Sir, is it
meant to be affirmed, that the power to "regulate
commeice" includes the power to regulate the cur-
rency of the several States^    If so, then is Congress
au'houzed,  under   the power to  "regu'ate com-
merce," to regulate  the  issues  of all  the State
banks—for these constitute the principal currency
of the country: on the other hand, if it be meant
that Congress have not the power, under this clause
of the Constitution, to regulate the currency, how
c in it ba said that Congress aie thereby authorized
to charter a bank for the purpose deregulating com-
meice, when the only object of a national bank, as
we are told, is to regulate and equalize  the ex-
changes and currency of the country?    Again: if the
power to "regulate coinmerce" includes the power
to incoiporate a bank, why may it not also include
the pou er  to grant chaners of incorporation for
other purposes'! Why not authorize Congress to in-
corporate companies for objects of internal nnprove-
men's, for manufactures, or, what would appear to
be ralh<"r moie congenial, for ordmary commercial
purposes'*    If Congress can, by this clause of the
Constitution,  authi nze one set of men, under an
act of incorporation, to deal m bank paper, they
possess equally the power to au'honre another set
to deal in siIks and satins, calicoes and ginghams.
Nor can this position be controverted.    The stock-
holders and agents of a bank  are as much traf-
ficers and  dealers m paper money, which is  a
species of commercial commodity,  as  meichants
are in broadcloths and cassimeres.     If an act of
incorporation, therefore, can be claimed in the one
case, as a proper and necessary moans to "regulate
commerce,"  it unquestionably can  in the other.
But the clause in question confers no S"ch power.
The power to "regulate commerce,"and the power
to grant charters of incorporation are separate and
distinct.    The former is confeired by the Constitu-
tion, the latter is not.    Sir, what was the nature
of the power which the framers of the Constitution
intended to   confer on   Congress by this clause?
Evidently, to   authorize  Congress  to piescribe or
establish ceitain i ules by which commerce should
be governed       But «ill it be pretended that the
authois of the Constitution meant that this power,
which  they vested  in Congress alone, should be
transferred by Congress to an  incorporated com-
pany'   That a chartered company should possess
the exclusive power of regu ating  the commercial
interests of ihe nation' o   presenbino; rules lor its
government'of deleimining theprmc pies on which
it should be conducted'md thus pi ce one of the
i   great interests of the country  bsyond legislative
and constitutional control'      No  one, I presume,
will say, in direct terms, that such was the mten*
