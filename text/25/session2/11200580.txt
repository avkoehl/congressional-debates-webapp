not be U insfetied and disbursed without the agency of banks,
and when another measure comes up, I will propose, if no one
else due1* a p an ef special deposites, which will place the mo
nev in tue custody oí the banks, but witnout their having the
powu to u^e one dollar of K I am and always have been,
opp >sed to (he pet bank system, as dangerous and corrupting,
and I mi prepare I to show that the plan of special deposites
dun nrshes patronage to absolutely nothing, and has advantage
over any other proposed in every point of view, and that it
would be idoptt' I do n  t doubt, if it were not for the extreme
ZL.il of iluason both sides—on the side of a United States

There isanother branch of this subject and to me by far the
mo t impol (ant, winch Í now appioach It is said that this hard
money policy will benefit the South, and reheve it from its
c rn i tacial thialdom to the North This is said on highautho
li v ind i vouched by names in which the South reposes a
we! eaimd confidence I do not doubt their sincerity, I justas
hule doub theeiror of the=t o jinions, I hive heard no argu
mo-it, fi )ni any quaittr, in support of them Whe« I ask foi
dtgument 1 am answeied by declamation, or some of thot-e
buad and geneialabstiactiona which, in politics, I have gene
rally founl t< be enbei uuisnis,or things that are not true My
own settle I conviction candidly, not hastily, arrived at, andcau
ti > i&ty and deiibarUtly re examined, with an ardent desire to
aim tat thetinth i , that whilst tins polity will be injurious to
all sections of the country, it will be lumous, fatally injurious
1> the South It is due to those who sent me here, it is due to
my df ogive the reasons that have forced these conclusions
upon me Aftei wha-i has passed in my very humble public
life I hid supposed that it was not necessaiy forme to declare
my dtvotion to the south But even I, sir, ail of whose interests
iii liiecriorib are mdissolubly connected with, and who have
pt liu' all that man values m defence of the South and its inte
i-^ts e\ en I am «impacted It is my dutytodefend myself, by
giving the reasons foi my opinions
AUhou°h this selfish and sectional policy has not marked the
mriont char ic ei of south Ca olma  although it has been fi om
i hi h cpneinub and patuotic disregard ol her peculiar mte
íí- t   and the rei'ine^s with which she has, on all proper occa

mainly m^btcl Or hei huh character, and the moral power
which she hi*, exeued m the Confederacy, lam forced to say
tint ih the ptcsci t condition of the politics of the country, I ie
,iard it to he my imppuous duty to look first  if not mainly, to
the interests tí my i wa peculiar section    Satisfyme, sir, that
my   policy wi I advance the interests- of the South and of
( harle-, on and T shall not hesitate to do all that I may honora
bH d > to thitend all that I cando consistently with the obliga
titns of duty md of honor to the other membeisof theConfede
j irv    Mote than that I trust I would not do to tdvance any in
t itst «sectional oi «tifish    Further than this I do not flunk it
either nght oi prudent to go    We, sir, aie, and are destined to
bt  Uieweakei mtcie-n, and to say nothing of the obligations
of an honorable pati ioti<-m, it is not the moat wise in us to avow
a policy bdn>h an 1 sectional    If we do, it will be with an ill
grace that we shall complain of it m others who wield ti e
power oft majority     Will this policy benefit the South'?   I
would not vote loi  an expungine resolution because I should
be toil it would benefit the South, and I might be told  o with
Lismucb tiuth a¡s that  this gold and ¡silver j obey will   nay,
sir  with mote tnith   fir that would be haimle^s  and this
would le injurious    Amongst the aphorisms on this subject,
(iiulni one ins descended lower than an aphorism) is, tint
ti   bai km£byt.tem haseiven the North its commercial aseen
d neyovpithe South    If any thing is meant by the North,
if muot lit New  Yotk,  foi   it is   New   York  that imports
e\ luoively foi  the fciuth all th t is not imported m Soathern
cities    With just as much truth my a n*> on a coachwheel be
heldresp nsible for the du«tthat i& made, the fly is on the wh^-eJ,
and the dust i  made, but the poor fly has very little hand in it
i he banking system is in existence, and New York has this
nscendancy  but it is no more attributable to the banking system
than is the dust to the fly    This I will show    Andido not
vaunt when I ¡>iy that I will put it beyond the leath of refuta
tion or aigument      One  hearing a proposition of this sort
stated, would naturally suppose that the ban king capital of New
York wa-- muthgreatei in proportion than that of Charleston oi
other Southern cities     But what will gentlemen «my whtn they
aie toid that it does not aaiount to one tenth I might say one
twentieth, of that of any one of the cities of the South'-   I sup
po<*etftey will say, as did the ardent Henchman, when he wis
told that the facts did not support his theory  ¡*o much the
woise said he, for th" facts—tant pispour lesfaits, the f icts

Thp«e facts and fiiruresspcak for themselves    It will not be

quires ts much currenty ai tbo=se which are larger and have
greater commeice  Upon what ratio will y ~*u regulate it** That
ot population or commerce or what is the nearest approxi
mation to a j ust íatio, a combined one of population and com
meice    New York has ten times the population of Charleston,
md is emit ed on that principle to eighty millions    It ha=i
Twenty    It has forty times the commerce, and, on that ratio,
to duet hundred and twenty millions on a compcund ntio of
numbeisand of commerce, to twenty fire times as much which
w two hundred millions    It has twenty    And •*« ol all the
Southern cities    New Orleans, w th one tenth (it   the tutU
and oTfrtfnxth of the population of New York   his me bird
moie of banking capital   It is still more «unkindly shown m the
cases of Philadelphia, which, with one third of the population,
and less than a fifth of the commerce of New York ha^ thret
times the bank capital    Not less sinking is the case of Boston
Why has New York so far outstripped them both?   Will any
pne, m the face of these facts, hold up his head, and attribute the
powerand prosperity of New Yoik to the banking ystenr? But
it is to the dt-posite of public funds that the great prospea y of
Ne% A ork is owing Ho\t much has been, on ar average de
po ited there at any one tune? Not ¡moietlian three or four
million" A jd that to the capital and currency of that city, and
how btriKingly unequal, still, is the statement
I do not suppose that it will be pretended that public money
has any peculiarly refreshing and mvigoiatirg quality, any
more than'-o much private capital    This wi ole notion about
detositesi&asheí rand downright fallacy    The money iá not
deposited in New York, unless collected, there    No bank is&ues
to the whole amount of us deposites, a portion of it, geneia'Iy
half, remains locked up, and is, to that extent, a diminution of
currency, and theiefo e an embarrassment instead of an aid to
commerce     Of all the extravagancies that ever have been
broached by intelligent nvn, this is the greatest—to attribute
the commeicial power of New Yoikto causes so obviou ly in
sufficient    What made Amsterdam so long the commercial
metropolis ot the continent, I ondonof all Kuiope, Glasgow of
Scotland?   Who can tell, or what sane man would have attr
buted eitl er to any one caused   1 he advantages o*"NewYoik
are vast and innumerable    The most perfect h cal  position,
enonnons accumulation of capital, regular packets, and ships
without number, and, more than all, facilities of inland tram
portation,  unequalled and perfect, by which goods jmioited
there are distributed all over the United States    If New York
had not a single bank, the currency of other btates would accu
muíate there more than at any other p int     I met m New
Yoik, a few days since, a friend who had gone to obtain funds
to set on foot a bank in Arkansas     I asked him if lie wished
gold and silver    He said no ,  that forthe gieater pait he pie
fei red exchange on New York    Ht, wa¿ íisht, mi , and the fact
is tht most conclusne refutation of all these fallacies    These
are means by which the trade of the South, and of much of the
West, may be bioueht back to our own city of Ch trleston
But it never will be done if rebaneéis placed upon cveiy new
theory more polmcalthan commercial, that is started     One,
and the chief of these means is our great enterprise of commit
mcatmg with the West, by that ana similar works, this, to the
South, ereat end m >y be attained, and I hope and believe it will
be    I hope so, sir from every consideration of interest as well
as every íeelmg of afTtetion    I should love that venerabeokl
city if for no hmgelse but that it held the bones of the Rut
ledges the lauiensesand the Pmckneys, and now, in h^r day
of calamity and suffering, that feeling is almost one ofdevot <n
ButlwdPnot suppoit every wild and impracticable theory be
c tuse lam told on any authority that it will benefit Charles
ton when I have no shadow of doubt that the effect* will be the
very ie verse    I called some tune since, for a report showing
the lecciptsand expendiiuresm^achof the States    The Stcre

Now sir, that the fiscal operations of the Government opei att
injuriously to U'' I lo not doubt and have often asserted beie
But, in a demand of specie for Government due", I sec only an
aggravation of the evil    Whilst bank paper ib the currency,
and the banks pay specie, the pressure of these unequal dis
hursements is less severely felt    It ¡«arranged and alleviated
by the silent operations oftrade and commerce    jBut adopt the
specie system and the «pecie must be transported, or 1 ept
where it is collected at an equal cost and it cannot be t vaded
Suppose there was now in Mobile a million in specie belonging
to the Government, how would you u^e it?    I have been an
sweiedm conversation bv prominent ilvoratesnf this p hey
by transpnitmg the spe ie    That is my opinion    If the On
vernuitiit dou> not do it, ihe officer or employee to whom a
draitisgiven  or the merchant or bark into whose hand*it falls
will or he will only allow the «pecie to remain by being paid
font    In the last hveyeais two millions and a half have been
collected m < harletton— ceitamly ic*s than a mitltor   u d a half
pail out m the State    Sur pose that amount collected sn«pecie,
and transferred, does it not unavoida^y dimini hourcmrency
not one million only but three'*   Tor one million of spent )& a
safe basis for three of currency     Bees it not add juat that much
to the currency of the place to which it is transferred'   Mr
Crawford, m 1817, saw this  and saw, also, that anv reculur
currency, being adopted by the Government, would tend to the
alvantageof that section east of this city where Government
disbursements weie chiefly made   and this effec is infiniuly
increased when that currency is gold and silver which is ihe ba^is
ofathiee fold paper currencv
Again, m New \ ork the money paid into the Trea«ui> isal
most immediately paid out aaain and is available to pay lutie 
twenty times in a week Not so in Charleston, it is lotkt d up
and only unlocked to be transferred New York not onh

the case To a certain but an infinitely le«s extent, it ha<* tin
derthe system of meivir g convertible bank- paper, the its
mfidicatiixof commeiceand trade has greatly diminished the
injurious effects
It has been said that the South is to be bet efited by the ex
change on the North being against us How benefited? By
forcing a direct trade to our own ports This lool & rnighmy
like the tariff policy I* is certainly true that if rheie was a to
tal no i intercourse with Northern eiups, the people of the
South w ould be forced to trade a.t Southern seaports, ami that,
m proportion as impediments are thrown m the way of .such
intercourse will this effect be produced tSut at whose cost?
Atthe costoftheconsíumer,ifthereisany üims trueinlhean
ti tariff aigument, that the effect of cutting off ompe'itien is to
mercase prices Ask the farmei to which market lieprefeis
th it his merchant should go, to Charleston oi New York? Hisie
ply will be, to that where he can layan his goods cheapest
For he knows that the cheaper he buys, the cheaper he can
sell Ifhecanbuy -asch/ap m Chai les on, theie is no reed of
artificial checks to competition li he has to pay highei prices,
the consumer ultimately pays the difference Now, sir, if any
Stale in the South wihhesio force the increase uf iropouation
in theirown citits, nothing is easier Let the legislature pío
\ide by law to pay one hall the duties on all goods imponed,
mv hie on it, the impor anon  theic will be enormously in
creased, and, if I am not mistaken, at some itpk of dissatisfac
tion when the people come to be taxed to pay the money
The SoutJ, it is said, laise^ the staples which are needed m
foreign markets, and has, therefore, the command of foieign
specie A greater fallacy never was utt°aed We raise these
staples, it is true, but they are marketatfe commodiues,and ave
any body's who can pay for them How but m cotton do w
pay? How can we pay for the immense amounts which w
annually purchase of Northern commodities, such articles a-e
we are obliged to have, and which the Noithein people cans
fui msh us on better tei ms than any one else—negro cloth, ¡shoes,
hats carriages furniture all ai licit s of wool, leather, furs, m
short, all articles of which the law miteiial constitutes ti e
chief element of value? Then they have cotton «js well as we
hav e, and the bame command of foi tign ept c e as we haye Let
usstateacase
Anew bank is about tobe established, and e\ciy body wan s

comes to the South with a caiso of the articles I have enumera

Yoik meiclunt wants a hundied thousand dollars in s-pecle
