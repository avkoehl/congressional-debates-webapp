Plenty of grain and meat can be procured here. I expect General Sherman here to-day from Tellico, and them will know what I am to do next.

I have no cavalry, and can get along but illy without it.

The guerrillas are very impudent around me.

I am, very respectfully,

JEF. C. DAVIS,

Brigadier-General, Commanding Division.

Major-General GRANT:

I have just arrived. Sherman has gone. General Granger is here, but impatient to return to you. Longstreet has given out that he will make a stand at Bristol. I propose to advance with all available force to attack him there. Shall I do it, and retain Granger for that purpose?
