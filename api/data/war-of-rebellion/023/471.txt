has been making demonstrations to cross the mountains for several days. Some circumstances however justify the suspicion that he is moving up the valley, with the object of going into Kentucky. the wires are cut almost as soon as they can be repaired, and may any moment be interrupted entirely. One of Grant's divisions has arrived, but not the other. I expect it in a few days, though I have no certain knowledge when it crossed the river.
