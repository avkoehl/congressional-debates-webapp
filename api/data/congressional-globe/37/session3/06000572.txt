Mr. COX i supposed the question of reference
was the only question drb.m-'d, and that the merits
of the bill were not propt rly beloie ih'1 House.
The Sl'KAKI'jR. l>uf the merits of a bill can
Ij)1 discussed under a motion to refer.
Mr. COX. It may be; but that was not the
question before the House.
The .SPEAKER. The Chair decides the point
on the fiiNt ground, and thinks it was raised too
Into. The Chair does not know whether the bill
oonnvmtt u v impropriation ov not.
Mr. COX. There is an appropriation in it.
The pie\ toiir, fjtie.sJion was then seconded.

So the House refused to lay the bill on the table.
MESSAGE FROM THE SENATE.
A message from the Senate, by Mr. Forney,
their Secretary, informed the PIousc that the Sen- !;
ate had passed an act of the House (No. 591) to 1;
indemnify the President, and other peisoris, for >j
suspending the privilege of the writ of habeas
corpus, and other acts done in pursuance thereof, jj
with amendments, in which the concurrence of the
House is requested.
NEGRO SOLDIERS AGAIN.
The SPEAKER. The question recurs upon
seconding the demand for the previous question.
Mr. COX. i laise the point of order that the
bill of the gentleman from Pennsylvania contains
an appropriation of money, and that, thejefore,
its first consideration must be had in the Com-
mittee of the Whole on the state of the Union.
The SPEA.KER. The Chair thinks that if the
facts stated by the gentleman are correct, it is too

So the House refused to adjourn.
Mr. WTCKLIFFE. Mr. Speaker 
The SPEAKER. Debate is not in order.
Mr. WICKLIFFE. I know it is not; but I
want to ask the unanimous consent of the House
to offer an amendment, in the nature of a nroviso,
to the .substitute of the gentleman from Pennsyl-
vania.
Mr. BLAKE. I object.
Mr. W1CKLIFFE. The effect of my amend-
ment would be to confine the President to the fi ee
States and to the seceded States in the enlistment
of negroes. I think if the House would hear my
amendment reported, a majority of the House
would sec its justice. The effect of this bill will
be, if'recruiting id attempted in the State of Ken-
tucky, to violate the constitution of the State and
the penal code of thatState, and brin^ the Federal
authority and the State authority in conflict. I
ask that my amendment may be road.
The SPEAKER. It can only be read by unan-
imous consent.
Several members objected.
Mr. COX. I ask to be excused from voting on
this question. I believe this is part of a plot to
drive the slave States out of the Union. [Cries
of " Order!"]
The SPEAKER. Debate is not in ordei.
Mr. MALLORY. 1 demand the yeas and nays
on excusing the gentleman from Ohio.
The yeas and nays were ordered.
Mr. .VALLAND1GHAM. I ask to be excused
from voting on the question of excusing my col-
league.
The SPEAKER. The Chair cannot receive
that motion.
Mr. VALLANDIGHAM. Why not?
The SPEAKER. It has been decided hereto-
fore that such a motion is not in oider.
Mr. COX. I appeal from the decision of the
Chair.
Mr. HOLMAN. I call for the yeas and nays
on the appeal.
Mr. MAYNARD. I move to lay the appeal
on the table.
Mr. CRAVENS. On that I call for the yeas
and nays.
The yeas and nays were ordered.
The SPEAKER. The gentleman from Ohio
[Mr. Cox] asked to be excused from voting on
the proposition before the House, and un that the
yeas and nays were demanded and oider* d. The
gentleman from Ohio on the right [Air. V.\ll\n-
dioiiam] asks to bo excused from voting <><* the
request of his colleague. The Chair dectth s that
that motion cannot be lecoivou, as the i uh s only
contemplate that gentlemen shall be oxen vd fmrn
voting on business before the House Th - Chair
recollects, that in the Congress of whkh Mr. Orr
Was Speaker this question came up, and the
Speaker, after he had once allowed such motions
to be made and they had accumulated, fiii.d'y de-
cided that he would not enteitain more than one
motion to excuse a member from voting at a tune.
The Chair, in conformity with that ptec.dem,
decidcs the motion of the gentleman from Ohio
[Mr. Vallandigham] to be out. of order.
Mi. COVODE. 1 desire to know if it j'?: m or-
der to move to amend the motion of the penile-
man from Ohio, [Mr. Cox,] so as to excuse the
gentleman'« brother from further serweoin the
intcuor Dopaitruent? [Great laughter.]
The SPEAKER. It is not in oidut.
Mr. ALLE.N, of Ohio. I move that the House
do now adjourn; and on that motion I call for the
yeas and nay&.
The yeas and nays were ordered.
Mr.ANCONA. 1 ask to be excused from vot-
ing on that question.
Air, VALLANDIGHAM. I ask the ytas and
nays on that motion.
TheSPEAKER. There can bene su< h motion
made when a motion to adjourn is pending.
Mr. VALLA XDIGHA M. 1 appeal from that
decision.
The SPEAKER. These i.s ail appeal ponding
already, and the g^ntl-mian i.s aware that there
cannot be two appeals pending at the same time.
