HDQRS. ARMY AND DIVISION OF WEST MISSISSIPPI,Mobile, Ala., May 23, 1865.

Major General F. J. HERRON:

Transmit to me in detail any propositions that the rebel authorities may desire to make with a view to the surrender of their forces west of the Mississippi, but do not consent to any suspension of hostilities, either general or limited. I will give a decision as soon as I know fully what they propose.

E. R. S. CANBY,

Major-General, Commanding.

BATON ROUGE, May 23, 1865.

Major General E. R. S. CANBY:

I send you herewith dispatch from General Brent, C. S. Army. Of course nothing has or will be done with these officers with reference to a suspension of hostilities. My opinion is, after further talk with them, that Kirby Smith expected or hoped to get some concessions, but General Hays, commanding the State of Louisiana, is ready for terms at once.

F. J. HERRON,

Major-General.

BATON ROUGE, May 23, 1865.

Major-General CANBY:

GENERAL: We are now at this point, vested with authority by Major General Harry T. Hays, C. S. Army, commanding the Militia District of West Louisiana, to open negotiations with you and ascertain what terms will be granted preliminary to the surrender to you of all the Confederate forces, public property, &amp;c., in his district, which we are authorized to make. We have also authority from General E. K. Smith, C. S. Army, commanding forces Trans-Mississippi Department, to arrange terms for the surrender of the remaining portion of the department. We request to be permitted to have a personal interview with you at such officer or officers as you may be pleased to empower to treat with us. The many details which will necessarily attend these negotiations, embracing different armies and a vast extent of territory, seem to produce a necessity for personal conference between duly authorized agents, even after a general basis of surrender may be settled.

Very respectfully, your obedient servants,

J. L. BRENT,
