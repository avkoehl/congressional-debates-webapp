HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,February 8, 1865-9.30 p. m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Commanding Second Corps:

The general commanding directs me to call your attention to the fact that your left cannot be withdrawn to occupy the new line until general Warren shall be prepared to withdraw Generals Ayres and Griffin. This cannot be done until the new works at the crossing of Vaughan road shall be finished, which will probably take three days.

The part of the new line I propose to take up to-morrow morning is that which extends from the proposed battery in the vicinity of the Tucker house to Fort Sampson. The other part, under the change in the order, is not indicated to me yet.

I was absent when your aide called at my headquarters this afternoon. It will be satisfactory to me for you to relieve my troops in charge of the line between Forts Fisher and Gregg as soon as possible. I will ascertain from General Miles the number of men that will be required to picket the line.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General.
