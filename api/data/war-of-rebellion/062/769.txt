HEADQUARTERS U. S. TROOPS, WESTERN LOUISIANA,Cane River, March 29, 1864.

Brigadier General C. P. STONE,

Chief of Staff, Department of the gulf.

GENERAL: I have received your dispatch of yesterday and today. I arrived here this morning about 11, but the road being full of cavalry, the infantry only reached here at sundown-its advance, I mean. The infantry pioneers were sent forward at 1 a. m. to build a brigade. The pontoons, by great exertion, may be here by 12 m. to-morrow, and it is my opinion that the pontoon bridge will be more available than the other, even if the latter be finished as soon,
