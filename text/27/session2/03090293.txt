He believed most solemnly that if resumption had beei en
forced in 1839 the country would not have suffered half as
much as it had done, and the longer it was delayed ¡he greater
wo ijd b« the suffering    To compel specie payments at once,
would be the dictate of mercy, as well as justice, to iheopprelbs*
ed millions What had precipitated the city of PhiJadelphia
from her lofty elevation, and brought her down to her present
level? It was nothing on the earth but the refusal of the I>gie*
lature of Pennsylvania, ai the proper time, to compel the banks
to resump specie payments When the banks of that city sus-
pended, m Oetobei, 1Q39, it fell upon ue like a clap o( thunder
from a cloud'esssky &he was then in a state of comparative
prosperity Foicign exchanges were then m our fayor Spe
cie was_not demanded for exportation There was no extraor-
dinary pressure felt Every thing was calm as a sunnne *9
morning At the meeting of ihe banks in Philadelphia, mr«-
voted against the suspension whilst five only, including the
Bank ol the United State", voten m its favor In the face of thia
vote, the great monster issued its mandate m favor of atiepen-
sion, and on the very next morning, m order to save it (rem
immediite íuin ai! the other banks disregarding the interests
oftheir stockholder-and the community, foi owed itsexamp e,
and thus declared tliTnnelves willing to share its fate fhete
banks weie thetiuodei no absolute neceseuy io suspend, but
in less than s'\ months fiom the time this unfortun te step
was taken, they became completely powerless and could n t
hav* resumed even if th^y would Having agreed to lire-or
die with the Hank of the United Mates, they could not refuse to
receive its notes in payment of debts or on deposite Its
despeiate condi ion compelled it to issue its notes m large
q ti mtities, and they soon became the chief medium ofcirculation
in the city and county of Philadelphia, and throughout many
poiuons of the country The Senator Iron Mistoun had ii
foim^d m that it sent its agents to the utmost extremities of
the Union, loaded with its irredeemable notes, who captuied
the ffoWand silver with them This they sent to Europe, to
sitisfy then creditors there In ibe mean time, the Bank of
the United States was becoming more and more indebted
eveiy itay to the other banks of Philadelphia for-its notes ie-
ceived by them in payment of debts and on deposite, until at
list they were reduced to their present lamentable condition
Ha ! the Legislate promptly, at their next meeting after Og
tobei, 18J9, compelled resumption, this would have arrested
the other banks in this ruinous career, and saved the people of
the countiy fiom thecuise of suffering two years under an
ii redeemable currency Had this been done, the city of Phila
delphia would now be standina on that proud and lofty emi
nence which he tiusted she was soo a destined to regain In
the meantime, hei hade had languished, and a great portion
of it had been transferred to New Yor?, where ihe specie star
daid had been preseived I he days of her prosperity would
soon again return, because her people now felt the truth of
the maxim, in its full force, that honesty was the best po
hey, ii regard to banks as well as individual , and they
would compel their banks to act upon this principle whe
thei the resumption bill should pass or not He meant, of
comse, that this compulsion would be of a legal and const!
