Brigadier General G. WEITZEL,

Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: Your telegram of July 14 received at 7 a.m. this day. I put every available man on engineer fatigue till I received General Orders, No. 6, from division headquarters, requiring me to drill in school of soldier and company at least three hours per day and one hour additional in battalion drill. I soon after received from brigade headquarters a time table for these drills, dividing them between the a.m. and p.m. This I soon got modified on application to General Marston, so as to allow me to do fatigue duty a.m. and all the drilling p.m. Since then I have been furnishing in the a.m. all the men for engineer fatigue requested by Lieutenant Baldwin.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
