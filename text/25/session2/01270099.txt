diciary, made an unfavorable report m the case of
Thomas Chapman
Mr COLES, from the Committee on Military
Aftairs,made an unfavorable report m the case of
by Wester Day.
Mr MORGAN, fiom the Committee on Revo-
lutionary Pensions, reported a bill to amend the act
entitled an act for the relief of James Steele, ap-
proved 28th June, 1836, which was oidered to be
engrossed for a third  reading io-day
Mr TAYLOR, from the Committee on Invalid
Pensions, reported a billlor the lelief ol Pamela
Brown, \udow ot the late Major General Jacob
Brown
Mr UNDERWOOD asked leave of the House
to make a few lemarks explanatory of his state-
ments relative to the Postmaster Geneial, con-
tained in his speech as reported and published in
the National Intelligencer of the 9th instant.
The House having unanimously granted leave,
Mi  U said he had been unexpectedly called on
m the couise of debate, to explain a passing allu-
sion he had made to old transactions, in, which the
Postmaster Geneial took an active part,and which
at the time p) educed a very deep sensation m Ken-
tucky, that, in compliance with the call, he had
made a statement from his best recollection at the
moment    Since then, he had conversed with othei
gentlemen from Kentucky, whose oppoitunities to
know and understand the facts were equal, if not
superior, to his own     From  such conversations
and his own reflections (said Mr U ) I have be-
come satisfied that so much of my former state-
ment as holds out ttw idea that the Postmaster
General was to "mould and touch" a pamphlet,
wrote or to be written by Beauthamp, abusive of
the Old Couit party, or implicating any of them in
the mmder of Colonel Sharp, as the price or teuns
upon which a paulon was to be granted, is erro-
neous    I now believe the letter, in which the Post-
mastei General used the words "mould and touch,"
was written after Beauchamp's execution, and con-
sequently could have furnished no evidence of a
willingness   to   combine with   Beauchamp, then
dead, in effoits to procure his pardon as a reward
for political services    That letter, from my pre-
sent information, related to a manuscript left by
Beauchamp, purporting to be his confession    It
v, as repeatedly charged upon Mr Kendall in the
public journals  of that day,  that his motive m
desnmg to "mould and touch" the confession was
con upl  and from the course which the Argus had
taken, the Old Court parly, so far as my informa-
tion  extended,  believed that Mr   Kendall had a
smistei political object in view in his proposition
to  "mould  and touch "   Such  was my opinion
then, and I still retain it
In sptakmg of these tiansactions of so many
years' standing, it can scaicely be presumed that I
should precisely lecollect every eucumstance I
have deemed it a duly to nnself to correct the mis-
take into which I ha\e (alien, a-> far as my subse-
quent mloi mation and reflection show to be proper
Mr WHITTLESEY ol Ohio suggested that
the Hou«t now proceed to the private bills
Mr C W1BRELENG objected, because he pre-
ferred occupying the morning houi witn the public
business
Mi JOHNSON of Louisiana, on leave, offered
the following resolution, which was agreed to
Resolved, That the Committee on the Public
Lands be instructed to inquiie into the expediency
of reviving the act of Congress authorizing all pei-
sous wmng lands on watei courses m the State of
Louisiana to enter the lands in the rear of their
front concession^; and into the expediency of au-
thorizing all such claimants of land on the said
water courses as may be unable to obtain, in the
rear of their claims, the quantity of lands contain-
ed in their front tracts, by reason of bends m the
water courses on which they are situated, or other
causes, to make their entries on other public lands
in the vicinity of their front claims.
RELATIONS WITH MEXICO
The House then resumed the consideration of
the following resolution submitted by Mr   Adams
on the 18th ult.
Resolved, That the President of the United States
be requested to communicate to this House a copy
and translation of the pamphlet m the Spanish lan-
guage, stated in the report of the Secretary of State
to this House, to have been printed and cnculated
by the late Minister tiom the Republic ot Mexico,
Goiostiza, before his departure from this country,
and the name of a diplomatic functionary from a
foreign Government who communicated a copy of
said pamphlet to the Secretary of State
The question pending was the motion of Mr
Howard to strike out all that part relating to the
name of the diplomatic functionary, alter the word
" country," in the eighth line
Mr SHIELDS did not rise foi the puiprse ol
entering into the merits of the whole suoject undo
debate, but solely for the purpose of repelling and
protesting against the allegations which had been
made against the citizens of the southwest m rela-
tion to the revolution m Texas With regard to
the resolution itself, he did not see of what benefit
it could be to the country, as its principal object
was to call foi a ropy of a pamphlet, eveiy word
of whirh had been already read by every member
of the House But he had risen to protest against
certain conclusions «Inchhad been drawn íeflecting
on the conduct of citi7ens whom he had the
honor to represent It had been asserted in the
course of debate, that the citizens of the south-
west had participated in the affairs of Texas, in
direct violation of the laws of neutrality be-
tween this country and Mexico Such was not the
case. He would contradict the charge, and affiim
that the citizens of the Southwest had neither m
point ot fact or law participated in the revolution
of Texas He would assert that there was not one
man in fifty who left the United States for Tetas,
but who went with the bona fide intention of be-
coming a citizen of Texas It was true they had
taken with them arms and ammunition, but this
was after they had expatriated themselves, and
■w ere they, under those circumstances, to be blamed
for carrying means with them to defend the country
of their adoption'2 Such individuals a-s went from
that quarter were no longer our citizens they were
citizens of Texis, and from the first had engaged
in that cause with the bona fide intention of uniting
themselves with that Government But there was
not the least comparison between 'he circumstances
attending ths movements in the southwest, and
those of the northern frontier The individuals
who left the United States to render assistance to
Texas did so after the war had commenced, and
weie invited so to do by the Government of Texas
They therefore could not be charged with violating
the laws of Texas, because they had merely ac-
cepted an invitation held out to them by that Go-
vernment, and by that act he protested that they
had not breken one solitary law of the United
States, as there was nothing to prevent persons from
expatriating themselves, and becoming citizens of
another country, if they thought proper But how
nas it with the North' There the matter was
widely different A portion ot our citizens had,
uninvited, entered the terntory of a foreign power,
with the avowed intention of tarrying on a war,
under aggravating circumstances, calculated to di -
tnrb the haimony betn een die Iv, o counti íes Mr
S \i ent into a detailed statement of the affairs of
our Canada border, for the purpose of showing
there was not the slightest ground for instituting a
parallel between the conduct of our citizens m that
quarter, and that of the people of the southwest in
relation to Texas
Mr HOLSEY did not rise fox the purpose of
discussing the merits of the proposjtion immedi-
ately before the House,  but simply   to reply to
the observations of the gentleman from Kentucky,
(Mr. Menifee,) who had on a previous day,
when this resolution was under discussion, charged
the late Administration with a breach of neutral re-
lations with the Government of Mexico. He de-
nied the imputation, and invited that gentleman
to lay his finger upon a single instance in which
this Government had failed to act in strict con-
formity to the laws of nations. There are bat two
modes of deriving neutral obligations—one from
the conventional, the other from the natural and
necessary law of nations. Will the gentleman from
Kentucky produce the treaty of neutrality between
the two powers1 The subsisting treaty of amity,
commerce, and navigation, is not of that charac-
ter. It does, indeed, define the rights and obliga-
tions ot neutrals, whilst the parties choose to retain
that characlei, but does not bind either of the par-
ties to remain neutral in a contest with a third
power. The tieaty establishes the rights and
privileges of neutrals, but the question, who
are neutrak? it leaves to be decided by the
natural law of nations. By this law you re-
main neutial so long as you extend to the
belhgerants equal piivileges You shall not deny
to one, in consequence oí the war, what you grant
to the other It ii not a violation oj neuti ahty to per-
mit one of Ike beJhgei ants to enlist troops within your
dominions, provided you do not exclude the other. The
nations of Europe engaged m war, enter the Re-
public of Switzerland and enlist her citizens, whilst
none of the belhgerants ever complain of such per-
mission as a breach of neutrality Let us, then,
apply the law to the facts of the case before ns. I
shall take the strongest case put by the gentleman
from Kentucky, of the officers of Texas enlisting
soldieis within our jurisdiction. Now this is a
privilege granted, we will suppose, to one of
the belhgerants Has it been refused to the
other' Has any disci immation between the par-
ties been made by the Government' It is true,
sir, that the act of 1818 excludes both parties
from recruiting within our limits But this act
is a domestic regulation—it prohibits that which the
law of nations pet wits. A relaxation of that policy
concerns this nation exclusively With its execu-
tion or non-execution foreign nations have nothing
to do AH that they demand when m a state of
war, is that the door shall be opened or closed upon
both parties alike If you enforce the act against
the one, you must also enforce it as to the other.
If you relax it as to one, so you must as to the
other. Now, sir, I aftirm there was nothing in the
couise of the last Administration towards the two
powers of Mexico and Texas, contrary to the prin-
ciple just stated If the people of the United States
choose to serve under the banner of Texas rather
than that of Mexico, it is not chargeable to the Go-
vernment They act only m pursuance of a perfect
right allowed them by the law of nations Nations
engaged in war have no right to impute to a third
power the conduct of its citizens who take part in
the war Such a practice would multiply the causes
of war, and be subversive of the peace of nations.
It is not recognised by the custom of the enlighten-
ed nations of Europe. But as, between Mexico
and Texas, the question occurs how far foreign na-
tions may interfere, I shall admit it to be a sacred
principle, that you are not allowed to intermeddle
m the domestic quarrels of other States. The inci-
pient stages of revolt, a popular commotion, or an
insurrection, do not furnish proper or legitimate
gtound for interference.
When, however, the contest has reached the
higher appellation of civil war, you are at liberty
to take the justice of the cause into consideration,
and join the party whom jou may deem to have
j ustice on us side Sue h was the conduct of France
in our struggle for independence. Such was the
course of the allied sovereigns who arrested the
march of the Ottoman in the Moren, and prevented
him from grinding to the dust a people whose an-
cestors are renowned in history. The war be-
tween Mexico and Texas has been of a similar
character. The latter are a people cradled in
American liberty, once enjoying a federal system
similar to our own, but resisting the overthrow of
the Constitution and the march of a military chief
to a throne    The struggle soon assumed the cha-.
