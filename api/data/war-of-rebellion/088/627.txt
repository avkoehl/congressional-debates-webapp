U. S. SHIP ONONDAGA,

James River, September 1, 1864.

Lieutenant General U. S. GRANT,

Commanding Armies of the United States:

GENERAL: I have respectfully to inform you that since the morning of the 29th ultimo the boats of the U. S. steamer Sassacus have been employed dragging the river with grapnels below City Point to Harrison's Landing for the torpedoes supposed to have been placed in that vicinity, but have not succeeded in finding any. It is thought that their locality is not correctly defined, or that the parties reporting them have been misinformed. I have ordered a steamer to patrol the river nightly from City Point to Harrison's Landing to prevent the enemy from indulging in any such diabolical tricks hereafter.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

MELANCTON SMITH,

Captain and Divisional Officer, Commanding in James River.
