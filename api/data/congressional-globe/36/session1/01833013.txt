1860.
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
those least able to pay them. We have seen that
its provisions are complicated; that it must mul-
tiply the number of officers necessary to execute
the icvenue system. We have seen that it opens
the doors to fraud more than perhaps any finan-
cial system that ever was devised; and it opens it
more, because it is subject to all the objections on
that score that have ever been raised against any
bill. It is subject to all the objections tho t have been
made either to specifics or ad valor ems, for we have
sometimes both duties upon one article, and the
duty is paid, not only upon measure, but upon
weight; and not only upon that calculation, but
upon a calculation of minima afterwards. I be-
lieve, therefore, that the custom-house officers in
New York were right in saying that it would in-
crease the number of stores, because it would
require a much longer time in order to give the
merchant his goods and calculate the duties on
them; and, of course, it would increase the num-
ber of officers required to execute it, because it
would increase tho labor of the work.
Cut this is not all the bill does. It virtually
repeals your warehouse system. Under this. 1
believe, you can keep goods in warehqusc only
thirty days. That system, whose operation has
been so beneficent on trade, and particularly on
the navigating interest, and on those gieat uties
which are destined to become, and indeed have
become, great centers of trade, it is proposed vir-
tually to sweep away at one fell blow. Sir, what
harm has the warehousing system ever done any-
body? How does it operate on tho consumer?
It operates according to the old Scripture rule of
laying up in years of plenty in order to meet those
of scarcity. When prices are low and the article
is abundant, instead of being thrown on the mar-
ket to glut it and reduce the price, the goods go
into store; and when prices are high, they come
out again, and thus prevent them from lismgtoo
high. This tends to preserve an equilibrium in
prices, and does, without injury or injustice to
any one, that which the advocates of specific du-
ties propose to do very unjustly under thatform,
because it increases the rate of duties which the
lower qualities and prices pay, while it diminishes
that of the higher. So far, then, as the ware-
housing system affects the prices of commodities at
all, it tends to preserve a level and an equilibrium
in price. But it has a far more important operation
on our commcrcial progress than that. It is essen-
tial, in order to make any great center of trade,
that this system should be introduced. It is to this
that the trade of Great Britain owes so much of its
vast expansion; for she has favored the storage
of goods by her laws and system far more than
we have ever done; and it is thus that a ship is
enabled to make up at one of those ports an as-
sorted cargo for any part of the world.
What is it that makes JNew York the great
center of commerce? What is it that makes a
bill on New York more valuable, as a general
rule, than a bill on any other American city? It
is because we can convert a dollar in New York
into a larger variety of articles than we can any-
where else. There may be individual articles that
we might get as cheap m Baltimore, or Boston,
or Philadelphia, or Charleston; but when you
come to making up an assorted cargo, it is im-
possible at any port in our country to make up
one with the same facility as at New York. It
is there that ships may resort to load and make a
venture to any port of the world; and the whole
effect of repealing this system would he to lestore
to England much of that pccuhar advantage which
she has derived from the centralization of com-
merce there, and which, under this system we
have been taking away fiom her.
Is it not an advantage to us if they store their
goods in our warehouses ? Is it not an advantage
to us if they place them here, so that our ships
may always find facilities for making up caigoes
that may be suitable for any port of the world:
And shall we not take away from them this facil-
ity if we destroy the warehouse system, which it
is proposed now to do m this bill?
Now, sir, under all these circumstance?, I have
felt authorized in making this motion to postpone
this bill until December next, because it is mani-
fest that it is one not only not fit to be passed, but
one which docs not even furnish the foundation
to build another upon. It is in itself the most
monstrous piece of financial legislation that I ever
have seen; and I know of 110 use that could be
made of it, exccpt to engross it on vellum and
send it as a present with the Japanese embassy
to the Tycoon, as the best means of preserving
that exclusive policy which has been traditional
in his country for so many centuries. It is utterly
unfit for this enlightened age, and would be de-
structive to our trade and commerce. It would
set back the whole country, if you were to intro-
duce such a scheme as this, I do not know how
many years. I believe, if it were to be passed,
we should, at the opening of the next session, be
inundated with memorials from every portion of
the Union to put an end to such a system of legis-
lation. Is it not better, even for those who believe
that there ought to be an increase of the tariff, to
take time, to get information, to mature it, and
to present one which may be more consistent, not
only with the financial wants of the country, but
with its great industrial interests?
Mr. BIGLElt. AJr. President, I remarked a
few minutes since that f rlid not intend to make a
speech on this subject for the country or for the
purpose of consuming time. What I desire to say
I wish to say to the Senate, and for a practical
purpose, and to sec if any good result can be at-
tained. I am especially desirous that my friend
from Virginia should notice my presentation of
the condition of the finances, the piactical opera-
tions of the Treasury, and the necessity which I
claim to find for action on the subject of the tariff.
I may, Mr. President, before closing what I have
to say, allude to other considerations connected
with this question—the present depressed condi-
tion of the industrial interests of the country, and
to the respect and confidence I have in the views
of those of my constituents who believe that the
manner of assessing charge on foreign imports
might be so changed as greatly to advance their
interests without harm 01* wrong to any other
class of the people or section of the counti y. But,
sir, so far as the general details of the proposed
bill are concerned, 1 have arranged to leave thom
toothers. I shall fust undeitake to show that
there is a real necessity for an increase of revenue;
a necessity which presents the alternatives of in-
creased public debt or an increase of revenue.
Mr. President, 1 was struck with what I thought
was the skill of my fnend fiom Virginia, in as-
serting what should be a sufficient sum to pay the
annual expenses of the Government; but 1 feel
required to take the lessons of experience on that
subject. I think these a safer guide. So far as
my friend from Virginia undeitakes to establish
his position on any assumption of what the ex-
penses ought to be, every day's experience in this
body, every hour, shows that it is a fallacy, and
cannot be relied upon. Whatever he may say—
and he has stated a great deal winch is incontro-
vertible in reference to the increase and growth of
the country and its growing consumption—I am
safe in saying that the unavoidable expenditures
of the Government will mcrcase 111 a like latio.
The whole experience of our Go'vernmcnt goes
to show that the Senator's assumptions are un-
safe, and to furnish a conclusive answer to all that
he has said on that point. It wouhl be an easy
task to prove that the increased expenditures arc
out-runnine; the growth and consumption in the
country. I do not care to look particularly into
that point at this time; it is not my purpose; but
I wish to present the operations of the Treasury
for a period of four years; and I have undertaken
to do so in the most simple way possible, having 1
freed the whole operation of your loans, of your j
balances in the Treasury, of yourunpaid appro- [
priations, and presenting the simple operations of !
the Treasury each year, in a foini so simple that -
a child can understand it. On this point it is my ,
desire,it is my pride, as it is mv duty, to endeavor j
to be accurate. If I have not fallen into some grand ;
fallacy, the Senator from Virginia is mistaken. 1 j
have the utmost confidence m his ability and his :
great experience on this question: and I have said [
to lnm, in all candor, that if he discnvers in the t
exhibition which I make any palpable error, f !
wish him to tell me so, because it is right that I j
should correct it. That is the point to which I 1
wish to come plainly and promptly. I do not.de- I
sire to present a solitary figure here that will not '
stand the test of the closest investigation. Now, i
I ask every Senator within the sound of my voice ;
to give the statements which I shall exhibit a fair j
examination. I can see 110 possible way of meet- j
mo- them or controverting them. In order that j
there may be no dispute about my starting point,
I take the year I85B, as settled and audited:

not show the actual ordinary operation of the

Next, let us look at 1860, the fiscal year which
is just about to close. If there could be any com-
plication in my account, it would appear in I860.
It is here I have erred, if I have erred at all; and
I suppose I shall remain in that error, for I fear 1
shall not have the attention of my friend from
Virginia:

Miscellaneous  1,102,000 00
  56,910,079 06
Deficit $5,914,261 67
There is no point at which any of the items I
present, here con be disputed, unless it be the Sec-
retary's estimate for the last quarter. Tho total
receipts fiom customs amount to $53,046,000.
That is the accurate account, except for a few
ports where they were obliged to estimate up to
the 1st of May, and the estimate made by the De-
partment for the month of June. Then the re-
ceipts from public lands are $1,861,000, and from
miscellaneous sources ,102,000. Thus wc have
a total receipt of $50,910,000, leaving a deficiency,
on the operations of the year I860, of $5,913,000,
That is the practical working of the Treasury;
and yet, sir, we are told that there is no deficiency;
and we are told that we may anticipate a large
excess in the year 1801.
If it be asked why the Treasury has not been
exhausted, I answer that I have taken no notice
of the balance in the Treasury at the beginning of
the fiscal year—£>6.398.316; of which, on the fore-
going statement for the year, there remains but
§485j000. Thus you see the whole balance in the
Treasury must be exhausted; or if you keep it
at what it was at the beginning of the year, you
must have a deficiency of over $5,000,000. If it
be said that for the years 1858? 1859, and 1860,1
