Colonel BOWERS,

City Point:

Nothing new since the rebel attempt this morning to re-establish their picket-line, which we had driven into their works; the attempt handsomely repulsed, and we captured 61 prisoners, killed and wounded a number, and lost but 4 men. Their prisoners state that General Heth, commanding the corps, was present at work there from 1 till 4 a.m., arranging to recover their line, which he looked upon as of the utmost importance. We are erecting batteries with a view to farther advance. My loss so far about 240 killed and wounded; gain so far about 300 prisoners, not counting rebel killed and wounded.

E. O. C. ORD,

Major-General.

ORD'S HEADQUARTERS, April 1, 1865.

Lieutenant-General GRANT,

Commanding Armies of the United States:

GENERAL: I have made arrangements to have an artillery fire and sharpshooters do their best to keep re-enforcements from the work south of Hatcher's Run. I have ordered the engineers to push the battery that is to counter-batter those of the enemy covering the approach to their work which I spoke of as appearing feasible. Since then I learn from General Foster, on whose front it is, that deserters from the enemy have to cross an intervening bay-gall, on logs, which I presume is what delayed General Heth's party last night. I shall mass a column anyhow in front of the place, send out several scouts to reconnoiter the bay-gall, or morass, and if it is found practicable shall try it. I am very sorry, general, that I find it necessary to report these obstacles, and wish very much you would let some one else take this line and put my command out in the open country. I have no doubt my officers and men can give as good account of the enemy's works on an open, and I would not be compelled to report so many impracticable lines of rebel works.

Yours,

E. O. C. ORD,

Major-General.
