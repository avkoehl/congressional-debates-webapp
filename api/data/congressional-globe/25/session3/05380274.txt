APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
[March I,
25th Cong,...3d Sess.
Maine Boundary-Question—Mr. Evans.
Ho. of Reps.
tion, by bunging forward, prominently, a new
and collateial one, as stated by the gentleman
from Pennsylvania
Agieat and new question is now presented,
whether an mdiscieet step of a State shall involve
tins nation in a gteat and tremendous war! War
between these two nations will be no child'splay,
all say, that once begun, it will be long—that it
may be of ten years'duration, ten years of stufe,
of suffering, and of bloodshed.
What, then, should this G-overnment do? We
should do nothing which may have^a tendency to
excite unnecessary irritation, nothing which may
unnecessarily tend to produce war I have no
fears of being leproached with want of spirit and
courage Gieat Britain knows well with whom
she is to contend, that wa are of hei own blood,
her own race, who have not degenerated, but
who have taken a new start in the fresh soil of
this new world. Her own experience, also, has
taught her that it is not from fear that we are in-
clined to a pacific course No, it 13 fiom other,
from higher consideiations; from our abhorrence
of war between these two kindied nations, as a
great and teruble calamity And at this timo,
when wo have been hoping that the facilitas of
intercourse between nations, and the improve-
ments of our day, had produced more enlightened
views and better feelings on the subject of wai,
we had flattered ourselves that theie had been
great change, a great advance in tmeciviliziiion,
and that the history of the next two hundicd
years would not be written in blood, like that of
the preceding Who would rcsoit to wai,except
liteially as the last lesoii—war between two gicat
nations, bound together by the stiongest mutual
inteiest, as well as by tho indissoluble tics of
common ancestry, language, literature, and re-
ligion?
Some things 111 this debate have surprised me
No one, I trust, dcsnes war  why, then, connect
this with other subjects'   Why connect it with .
the dispute at the mouth of the Columbia rivu, '
or any other difficulties'   And what reason is
there to suppose that Great Eiitain has sent ai-
mues into Canada or tho West Indies, or fleets to
the Gulf of Mexico, for the puiposc of militiry
warfare agunst the United States '   May it not
have been  thought wise to guaid against the
possible effects of abolition in tin West Indies'
And are not their sixteen thousand 01 twi nty-
five thousand tioops m Canada ncccssaiy to keep
those colonics from disturbance'   And has Bng-
land discovered no confidence in this Govern-
ment'    Her whole Canadian fiontm  has been '
in a state of alaim on oocount of incursions fiom
our territory, mid yet it has nit distuibed the
friendly relations of the two nations
Think of tho connection between these two
nations, our constant intercourse, our mutual
commerce, more than between any other nations
on the globe, our competition in the arts, com-
merce, and manufactuics Is it sin prising that
there should arise occasional causes of difficulty
and nutation' Will they not happen among the
most honorable men in the transactions of busi-
ness'
But, Mr Chairman, the question now is, what
shall be done in the piesent emergency ' Shall
we leave Maine alone in this contest' No, she
must be protected. Is it expedient to pass this
bill' I believe the provisions of the act of 1793
are sufficient for the occasion That authorizes
the President to call out such part of the militia
as he may deem necessary to resist invasion, or
in case of imminent danger of invasion I know
this imposes the whole responsibility upon the
President I am willing, therefore, to go further
—to go for the first section of the bill, or for a
resolution to the same effect I hold that Maine
is to he protected Why? Because there has
not been such an explicit arrangement or under-
standing as is asserted. There is some misunder-
standing of the matter, and I believe it will be
found either that Sir John Harvey has mistaken,
his instructions, or that they were founded in
misapprehension, and that the British Govern-
ment will he satisfied that there was no such
agreement, express or to be implied fiom the
diplomatic intercourse between the two Govern-
ments.
MAINE BOUNDARY ClUESTION
REMARKS OF HON. GEO. EVANS,
OF MAINE,
In the House of Representatives,
March 1, 1839,
On the bill giving the President idditionat power for the
defense of the United btatoo, &c
Mr EVANS said he rose to make a brief íe-
ply to the honorable membei from Pennsylvania,
[Mr Biddle,J who had taken very decided ground
against the bill and against the whole policy on
which it is founded Perhaps (said Mr É ) I
shall not be able to fo'low very closely the Older
of his argument, and veiy likely many things
which he has uttered may escape my recollection
altogether, as, not intending to participate fur-
ther in the discussion upon the subject of our
border troubles on the northeastern frontier, I
took no note of the honorable gentleman "s course
of remark I had hoped that, after the cxposi
Hon which I offered a day or two since of the
state of affairs on that frontier, the rights and the
honor of Maine might bo safely committed to the
hands of those who might bo supposed to be
somewh it calmei in their feelings than the Rep-
resentatives fiom that State could be when they
were in hoiuly expectation of intelligence that
its toiutoiy had been invaded by a foreign enemy
and tlu blood of its atizeos pouied out upon its
soil The dneet allusions, however, which June
so fieciuontly been made to me by the gentleman
fiom Pennsylvania, and to the measmes reemtly
adopted by the Slate I lepresent, leave me no al
tcrnativc but again to trust myself to the nidul
gence of the House 111 defense of the measures
proposed by this bill I hope not to weary its
patience long
I he first objection slated by the honorable
member to the geneial scope of the bill is, that it
is a hostile mcasute—a measure of itm> , and, in
deed, he ícgaids it almost equivalí nt to a decla-
mliouofwai Accordingly, he presents in fervid
rolois to oui excited imaginations the pirtuiesof
cfttistiophes and calumnies nece«sauly incident
to such a state The conflagrated \ illages—fields
furiowid by the heavy cars of mtillory, and wet
with blood, and the desolations which war evt ry
where spicads aiound, aie arrayed bcfoie us in
all the force and eloquence for which the honoi
abl member is so distinguished Now, sir, it is
piecisely because I wish, most earnestly, to avoid
those calami ties and desolations—because I desire,
of all things which my heait can compass, to pre-
serve the pi ace and happiness of the country, that
I desuo this bill to pass It is a measure ofpeace
It will pieserve peace It will prevent, if it come
not too late, collisions that must inevitably lead
to war Let me assure the honorable gentle-
man and the House, that, if the sentiments he ex
piesses be earned out, there will be actual war
long before we are prepared for it, and which I see
no honorable mode of averting What are those
sentiments? What does he propose' What will
he do' Nothing' Nothing, whatever And
this he calls pence ' Is he aware of the present
condition of affairs in Maine and on the fiontier '
If so, what course does he recommend to be pur-
sued ' He offers no amendment He points out
no method of averting the penis in which we are
involved. He suggests no step to be taken, and
this is peace ' It may be peace, but what sort of
peace ' Sir does the honorable gentleman serious-
ly consider the condition of things—the State of
Maine in arms—with its panoply on—the pano-
ply of right and pistice, and solemnly pledged to
themselves, to their country, and to the world,
not to lay down their arms in the face of any hu-
man enemy, until the occasion which summoned
them to the field is removed ' Such is the posi-
tion which Maine has assumed It is a position
she will maintain at all hazards She will redeem
all her pledges. The occasion which has com-
pelled her to assume this position is an expected
and threatened invasion of her territory on the
part of a high-minded and gallant officer of the
British Government, acting, as he avows, in obe-
dience to explicit instructions from that Govern-
ment, for the purpose of arresting and suppress-
ing the exercise of civil authority by the State in
thetern'ory which Congress unanimously has
offii med to belong to her
Maine is prepared to meet that invasion, come
when it may, as becomes her character, and in
fulfilment of her pledges, and Sir John Harvey
is doubtless prepared and prepaung to attempt it
as becomes a soldtei, and a distinguished one, of
a brave nation, and in such a stale of things the
honorable member from Pennsylvamaadvises ua
to do nothing, fiom the apprehension that it may
lead to war He would sav to Great Britain,
" We offer no protection to Mame, she has taken
her giound, let her defend it " Will such lan-
guage as that lead to peace ' Sir, if the General
Government had come long ago, when it ought
to have come, to the protection of the violated
ngius of Maine, if it had acted with promptness
and energy, and a becoming sense of what was
due to itself and to that State, does anybody sup-
pose that these lofty and constantly augmenting
pietensions on the part of the British Govern-
ment would have been made and persevered in'
I am as desirous of peace as any man can possi-
bly be My State is so She has every reason
todesuc it With more than three hundied miles
of matiume fiontier, indentfd with capacious
harbors and rivers, and studded with thriving
villages, winch must belaid 111 ashes by thetoich
of wui, with three or fout hundied miles of in
land fiontier, accessible in almost every point
from tho neighboring provinces, with scarcely a
man or a gun to defend themselves, which you
have furnished, what has Maine to gain by war'
Nothing, sir, nothing She knows it, and she
desires peace, and she knows that the way to
preserve peace is to assert your rights, and to
cause them to be lespected, as they always will
be respected, by a proud and gallint nation, if
asstrted in a spirit becoming a nation no less
proud and gallant If language suitable to the
occasion had been held at the commencement of
those aggressions, and had been persevered in,
who can doubt that the whole matter would long
ago have been amicably settled' And, now that
we have bcenduven back—back—back, until we
can yield no longei, are we to be told that the
way to preserve the peace of the count! y is todo
nothing' Such, si 1, is not the voice of this nation,
if it hive any remains of the spirit which once
animated tho bosoms of our fathers No error
can be more fatal
The honorable gentleman, sir, referred to some
of the incidents in the late conflict with Great
Britain, to demonstrate the hazards of a state of
hostility with that nation He spoke of a portion
of the State of Maine having been in the posses-
sion of the enemy, and more than intimated that
it had not been defended with the bravery becom-
ing a people now so ready to appeal again to the
sword in vindication of their rights, and that what
had once happened might again occur in the
chances of war Certainly it may, sir But if,
at the period to which the honorable member re-
fers, he had been a citizen of that exposed coun-
try, instead of being safely lodged behind the
mountains, if he liad seen it left wholly unde-
fended by the General Government, without a.
man or a gun or a dollar furnished for its protec
tion, but, on the contrary, with thousands of its
men drawn off to fight your battles elsewhere, on
the land and on the ocean, leaving their own fire-
sides unprotected, without a State government
even of its own to call out and direct its energies,
he would hardly have thought it worth while, at
this distance of time, to search in the volume of
history from which he read for the fact that some
small portions of the territory of that State, very
sparsely settled and wholly without defense, were
compelled to yield to the naval supremacy of
Great Britain, and, least of all, would he nava
deemed it just to remind us of it as a matter of
reproach Was Maine the only State whose soil
felt the tread of a hostile foot in that conflict?
Were her small, defenseless villages the only ones
which capitulated' or did the British arms show
themselttes elsewhere, leaving behind them proofs
sad to remember—no less of their prowess than
of less honorable modes of warfare5 Such scenes
may happen there again, in the course of human
events, or may happen elsewhere^ and, for one, I
