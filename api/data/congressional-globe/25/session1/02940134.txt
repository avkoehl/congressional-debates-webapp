the favorite measure of the paitj  m powei      But,
sir, strange to sav, those who  «eeminglj,  at least,
favoied the principle of separal on, now  denounce
it as factious  end chimenea], and its  opponents
have become its warmest advocates     It is not foi
me to question the sincerity of eithei party      That
is between them and their consciences      We have
to do here with measures, not motives    I think
now, as I thought fhtn, and «ill not change my
course, because the admim trahon party, or the
opposi ion paity, may think fit to chpnge thens    I
have never ^o iar enlisted unc'ei the banners oí
either, as to give up the e\eru e o   an   own judg-
ment, noi cons.nttlto submit <o the dictation oí

other House—or in tie Whi'e House  Still less vull
I yuld up the conv u tions oí 1i< ov. n mind, because
my political adversaries bave ackno v lodged their
truth  The experience of the last two years has been
enough to open their ejes, and I will hope, sir,
they have «een their error    To adhere to an opin-
ion, when reason and experience shr w it to be ei-
roneous, is  to be a bigot,   or a  hypocrite     It is
equally due that those who deceit then  own prin-
ciples, and act m opposition to thcirown judgment,
?re slaves, mere puppets, moved by  the   will  of
anothei     Macl/el could construct a House oí Re-

But it is askcl, why legislate upon the subjec'
now? Th separation h <s tal t v place, and the

principle which ihe SuL-Treasuiy scheme is
designed lo assnt Special dcposite^no more imply
any pecuniary or political union between the Go-
vernment and the banks, than such an union
would spimg from employing a railroad, oi steam-
boat company, to transpon the mail or munitions
of war I tnist, therefore, sn, we shall have the
aid of the chanman of the Committee of Ways
and Means to amend the bill in the way I have
had the honor to suggest It would be the most
effectual means of readenng the measure success-
ful, and putting an end to the hopes of those w ho
look to its failure as resulting in the establishment
of a national bank.
REMARKS OF MR. HUNTER,
Or Virginia,
In Ihe How of Representatives, October 10, 1837—
In Committee of the Whole, on the bill " im-
posing additional duties, as depositories in
ceitain cases, on public ofhceia "
Mr Speaktr I auseunderthe painful sense t'latl
am asking almost too much oí this committee, when
I throw mj self upon its indulgence whilst 1 express
my views m relation to the s ibject before us But
our piesent position is high'y responsible, the con-
sequences of our action in the eAistmg cusís may
be lasting to the coi ntij, and I \v ish to be heaid in
vindica ion oi the punciples vvhi h v ill govern my
couise We stand, sn, in the midst cf a great
commueial revoluti! n, ue have jus witnessed an
p\plosion in the credit system, thiough \vh eh the
s k vm of cipitnl eieulilps and dispenses us
might again ti the coutilrj Old channe s have
been abandoned, new ones are being formed, and
now, sn, when every institution of the land is,
trembling undei theshock,andoui mostimpoitant in-
terests are sjmpathizing with the disiiess m'the cir-
culating system of the bodj politic, the eyes of the
people aie turned in anxious solicitude upon our
course
Thej have suffered with exemplary patience,
under oa'amities which would have goaded almost
any other people to tumult and bloodshed , and
th(j have even foi borne to speak forth then «ntcv-
ancs as it ienlulthat the clamor muht disturb
the presence of miiidof those whose peculiar task it
was to woik the ship of stale oil the lee shore upon
which it was duvuig—" Ace lumullus nee qmes,"
bm theie is tint stale or deep and silent suspense
wlnuimoie foiciblv than bywords seems to say
tin', upon this oic son, "oui conntij expects
cvlij man o < > his duty " I feel, sn, a most
painful sense of die lesponsibdity of my position
On the one hand, I know ihat he cannot be justified
on the plea of ignorance wno lightly tampers w ith
the important interests nt w concerned in our ac-
tion , and, on the oihei, it pe sonal or pirtv con-
Mderaticns wtrt in d°te>- me from doing whatevei
may be done rir the reuef of the country, I feel
that my name would deseive to be pursued through
all posteuty with execrations I might, pernaps,
es-ape lesponsibdity bv declaring that, as I had
nothing to do in producing the present disiiess, so
I was bound to do nothinc towards restoring things
to a sonn lei condition Sn I scorn ihe extuse J
(link I see something which may b" done for the
good cf the counttj, and i am willm« to shaie the
responsibility with those vvhi will at empt it In
tal ing my com e I ft nn no new connections, Imakc
no alUinces, I act as 1  vas sent here lo act I
legislate not fet paity, but foi the good of our
comme n coun n 1 tread all peisonal and party
cMisulerati nis in'o the dust, y h"a thej present
themselves j i competit on vyjh the most important
interests of tne people
Mr fnairman, it I can "ree this Government
from a corruptn g connection, if I can aid in so
moulding its action as to remove the causes bv
which it has disused the natural level of our
cnculaimg capital, and advance one more step
towards that perfect freedom which American
trade ought to enjoj, I shall be content, be my on a
fate what i* may, but if I should unfortunately
woik harm where I m an siood I shall only regret
that otheis will surfer under the consequences of
my mistake But, sir, I turn from these considera-
tions to the giea' question before us How can we
exercise the powers given us by the Constitu-
tion, and lemou'd the fiscal ac ion of the Govern-
ment, so as to relieve the country of its sufferings,
?nd prevent their recuuence again1? It has been
well said that debt is the evil undei which we are
suffering The real balance ot trade has been
against us , the foieign creditor demanded the ad-
justment of this balance in specie , and the currency
system of the country, having been inflated bevond
its just dimensions, was unable to meet the demand
foi a en nsion so sudden What, then, can be
done, su, to lelieve the people from this pressure''
Ti' ie are Dut two modes oí relief from debt the
one consists in its payment, and the othei palliates
the evil by obtaining t me, so as to divide between
several yeais the burden which is too heavy for
one Tt is obvious that, as a Government, we have
neither the right nor the means of pnying the debt.
Governments maj spend money, brt they never
make it, and their a'tempts at politic ü alchemy
have always resulted, like the vain search after tbe
phikrsophei'  stone, m more expense than profit.
Has tne Government the means ot extending
the ere lit upon the áeDt due abioad'2 If tais could
be done, we should undoubtedly ¡md immediate re-
lief In truces have occurrc ' m the nistoiy of
English commerce, and m some of oiu ow n
States, m which Govemn mt has tfle ted this
puipo e, by interposing its own credit between the
domestic debtor are' the foreisu eieehtor There
are tines when a people may be arable, without
"leal suffering, to meet a sadden call for the
bal mee of tndt wl i h exists again t them Butit
c.nseaicelv happen that thf>v shon'd not be ulti-
mately able to meet the call, it time weie given
On thes- occasions, the foieign creditor presses,
because he can not well know the actual responsi-
bility of individuals In such situations, the Eng-
lish Government has exchanged its own credit,
whicn was undoubted, for that of the domestic cre-
ditor, who vw-.s thus enabled to make his lemittan-
ces abroad m undoubted secunties We have no
povtr here to enter into any such trade, and
a'though the exercise of this power might occasion-
ally b useful, yet i* is too liable to abuse to have
been wisely entrusted to us The direct fiscal act on
of Ctovernmei t might have been rendered condu-
cive to this end, and eminently beneucial If we
had issued certificates of loan upon time for the
money necessary ioi Government, I believe, sir,
ihat the meiclnnt, itiNtead of exporting his specie,
would have given it io us in exchange for this
i aj 11 uh e i vv ould have served a batel purpose
abued In this way we should have done much
foi the lehef of the country, w e shouidhave avoided
all danger oí a deprecia'ed paper currency issued
by Government, and \ve should have been cleaily
within the limits cf our constitutional power But
the occasion has passed an ay, vv e have passed a
bill for Tieas try notes, and when I connect the dis-
cretion, as to interest, confided to the Secietary,
un 'er the bill, with his known opinions on that
subject 1 am bound to conclude that they will be
issued and desioi ed as curiency
But, Mi Chairman, that subject in not now be-
fore Us, and I vv ill not det-in the committee with its
further considention
I siifdl pause but a moment to consider the expe-
dient of a United States Bank, which has I een sug-
gested by sjme as affoidmg tne means of ] i< due ng
imined ">te relief If thswtre so the suggestion
would be useless ti tnose who, like myself, believe
that it is demonstrable, and that it has often oeende-
monstiated—mat we 1 ave no pow ei under the Con-
stitu'ion to chart.r such a tvnlr But, foi one, I do
not bent, e that the expected eff°ct w ould ñow iiom
an institution I* would en'er the field as a '•■val
of the 'state institutions, and could on y sustain th«-
competition by ei'her debasing its currency to the
levl of tlv> State institutions, oi by elevating their
circulation to the s under level which it might
establish for itself The first operation wou'd pro-
long the present evils, and the othei, if attempted
by any but the most gradual means, would break
the State bsnks, and aggravate the distress of th
