ment, in which the land batteries were assisted by one of the monitors.

In reply to the enemy, to-day the Brooke Gun Battery fired 40 mortar shells; Battery Rutledge, 21 columbiad shells and 13 mortar shells; Fort Moultrie, 29 shells and Battery Marion, 28 shells. The fire from the two latter works was directed with a view to extinguish the enemy's calcium light, the position of which has been determined by triangulation from several points, by direction of the commanding general, and it is believed to be in an embrasure of Battery Gregg. General Ripley telegraphs that he fired briskly for about three-quarters of an hour, and did not succeed in putting it out, but frightened the Yankees, and induced them to believe that a night boat attack on Gregg was intended, as is shown by one of the intercepted dispatches.

Major Jenkins dispatches by signal that the enemy have reoccupied Seabrook's Island in force, and came near capturing our pickets. They landed troops from a steamer which came in the North Edisto last night, and also crossed over boats from Kiawah Island.

General Robertson reports that some scouts on Edisto Island have returned with 2 negro soldiers of the Fifty-fifth Massachusetts Regiment, who state that there are only 120 men (chiefly black) on Edisto Island, and also 12 engineers, engaged in establishing signal communications.

Colonel Harrison, commanding at Fort Johnson, reports the elevating apparatus of the two guns (one at Battery Wampler and the other at the Tower battery) as out of order, owing to failure of the ordnance department to fill requisitions. Colonel Waddy, chief ordnance officer of the department, was directed to make strict investigation into the cause of the alleged delay, from which it appears that the requisitions were overlooked by Major Trezevant, commanding the arsenal, and who expresses his regret at the occurrence.
