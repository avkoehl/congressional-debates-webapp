Major General O. O. HOWARD,

Commanding, &amp;c.:

GENERAL: The chief quartermaster represents that paragraph III, Special Field Orders, Numbers 141,* has not been complied with as yet, and he desires it shall be as soon as possible, for the reason that for the absence of this guard and fatigue service, the public property cannot be protected nor the supplies arrived be furnished the army. Please give this your earliest attention, as General Easton is in pressing need of the detail of men.

I am, General, with respect,

L. M. DAYTON,

Aide-de-Camp.

Savannah, GA., December 28, 1864.

Captain O. M. POE,

Chief Engineer Military Division of the Mississippi:

I have to report that I have examined the ground for the new line of fortifications about the city. The line will run so as to render it necessary to destroy some old buildings (some of them occupied by families) and to remove some of the camps of our troops. I have located the line to interfere with both of these as little as possible. I think it necessary to give me authority, in orders, to have all buildings or camps in the way of the line of works removed at once.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

C. B. REESE,

Captain of Engineers, Chief Engineer Department of the Tennessee.
