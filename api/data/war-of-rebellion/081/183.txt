HEADQUARTERS FIRST DIVISION, FIFTH CORPS, June 18, 1864.

Colonel LOCKE,Assistant Adjutant-General.

COLONEL: In answer to your communication, just received, I have to state that nearly all the dead and wounded were recovered. A very few of the One hundred and fifty-fifth Pennsylvania are still, I fear, outside, perhaps within twenty feet of the earth-works.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

CHAS. GRIFFIN,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND DIVISION, FIFTH CORPS, June 18, 1864-11 a.m.

(Received 11.15 a.m.)

Major-General WARREN,Commanding Fifth Corps:

GENERAL: I have established my line to the left of General Cutler, across the railroad, on a crest in the open. I drove the enemy's skirmishers from it, and am now intrenching. Also shall establish batteries. The ground falls from the crest about 200 yards to a deep ravine. It rises from the other side gradually, about the same distance, to the first line of rebel works; still rising, you come to their second line. Their line runs beyond my left, which I have refused.

Very respectfully,

R. B. AYRES,

Brigadier-General.

JUNE 18, 1864-12 m.

General AYRES:

General Meade has ordered an assault along the line at this hour. If we carry the enemy's intrenchments, so that you can swing in with your right, do so, ut I want our left as a pivot for the present. Knowing as you now do that there is a general assault use your judgment in advancing if you see the enemy falling back, and look out they don't re-enforce their left from your front.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND DIVISION, FIFTH CORPS, June 18, 1864-12.20 p.m.

Major-General WARREN:

GENERAL: The enemy are reported by my skirmish line as going around our left double-quick. I think it may be that they think we are massing against their right. The cavalry is pushing out. Should the rebels turn my left with a strong force I can swing back into a strong line of works running at right angles to my present line.

Very respectfully,R. B. AYRES,

Brigadier-General.
