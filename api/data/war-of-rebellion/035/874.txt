Major THOMAS M. JACK,

MAJOR: Will you please order a detail of 1,050 men to report to Captain [H. N.] Pharr, on the fortifications on the east side of the Fairfield turnpike, on the hill, in a wheat-field about three-fourths of a mile north of Little Horse Mountain; 350 to report at 6 a. m., 350 at 9 a. m., and 350 at 2 p. m.? The detail to report until further orders from you, and to have the proper officers, and each day enough cooked rations for that day. The detail is wanted by to-morrow morning, the 13th instant. I expect all the works will be command by Tuesday or Wednesday next.

Very respectfully, major, your obedient servant,

KNOXVILLE, June 13, 1863.

Major V. SHELIHA,

Chief of Staff, Cumberland Gap:

Yours received. On first information I moved one regiment by rail; it is now at Zollicoffer. Can recall it at any moment. I wrote the general fully, and sent courier via Jacksborough. I will not move the battalion of General Gracie beyond Morristown until further advised by you. The report of General Gracie's scout in Harlan Country removes any present apprehensions. The quartermaster has only received 450 sacks corn this week. He sent 150 this morning to quartermaster at Clinton. Will furnish more for Big Creek Gap, if possible.

J. N. GALLEHER,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

Brigadier-General PRESTON,

Abingdon, Va.:

Gracie's cavalry just returned from Harlan County. No indication of the enemy's attempt to cross the mountains. Will not your force at and near Jonesville be sufficient to watch the passes?

J. N. GALLEHER,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

Major-General WHEELER:

Enemy appears to be moving large mounted force to our right, north of Cumberland. Try and develop movement. Ascertain facts about Murfreesbourough.
