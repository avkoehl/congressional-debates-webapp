the circumstances around you being your guide; but one restriction must be insisted on, and that is this, that these Indians must not return to the north side of the Missouri River under penalty of their lives. Whilst circumstances may render it judicious that they be permitted to remain in peace on the south side of the river, their own crimes have closed for ever Dakota or Minnesota to their reoccupation. The peace of the whole border, and particularly the security of the frontier settlements of Minnesota and Iowa, depend upon a vigorous campaign on your part until the cold weather drives you from the plains.

Your presence on the Upper Missouri in time to have co-operated with General Sibley would probably have ended Indian troubles, by destroying or capturing the whole body of Indians which fought General Sibley, but your failure to be in proper position at the proper time, however unavoidable, renders it necessary that you should prosecute with all vigor and dispatch the campaign I have marked out for you.

I am, general, respectfully, your obedient servant,

JNO. POPE,

Major-General, Commanding.
