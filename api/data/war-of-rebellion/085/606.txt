rebel pickets on the Monticello road, and develop the force at that point. Spies report that Magruder anticipates that Price will soon be driven south, in which event he will attack both Pine Bluff and Little Rock, while Price and Shelby fall upon Devall's Bluff and destroy the railroad. My force is being constantly reduced by the muster out of non-veterans. The veteran portions of regiments do not return, as General Halleck promised they should. The confusion occasioned by non-veterans being left behind without sufficient date for their muster out is a very serious annoyance.
