who passed Pickett's division at Hanover Junction, but as it was at the time Longstreet was trying to intercept Sheridan nothing more was thought of it. A scout is on its way to Edinburg this morning. For several days there have been rumors here of a raid by Rosser, who has collected a large part of his force.

General MORGAN,

Headquarters Middle Military Division, Winchester:

The rebel deserter is now here. He says he left Staunton, to-morrow will be a week. There were but two companies there. He afterward saw a courier who told him that Pickett's division was on its way to Staunton from Lynchburg. He reports Rosser as having gone to Lee with his own and McCausland's divisions of cavalry, and that Lomax, with Imboden's and Jackson's brigades, were to reoccupy the Valley with what there is left of Early's infantry. He states the men are through the Valley now collecting all men on leave. He is a young Irish boy, apparently not very intelligent. It is only from the courier that he knows anything of Pickett's division. His report does not impress me as being very important. He brought his horse and equipments.

Major-General.

Lieutenant Colonel J. H. TAYLOR:

COLONEL: I sent out a scout of 100 men, Eighth Illinois Cavalry, under Captain Corbit, last night, to examine houses in front of my lines. The scout returned an hour ago with two rebel prisoners belonging to the Fourth and Sixth (rebel) Virginia Cavalry, who were furloughed from Early's command to steal horses here. The prisoners were sent in to-day's train to Colonel Wells, and a rebel deserter to your headquarters under guard.

Colonel, Commanding, &c.
