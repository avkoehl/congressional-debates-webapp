(Received 15th.)

Brigadier General JAMES CRAIG:

There is a large force moving up the river on this side now in Carroll County. Carrollton has been evacuate, and also Lexington. Hear 200 crossed the river to this side, about fifteen miles from this place, last night. Would it not be best to concentrate the forces in this subdistrict at once? If not, send us re-enforcements without delay. Answer at once.

W. B. KEMPER,

Captain Company K, Ninth Cavalry Missouri Militia.

WM. G. GARTH,

Captain.

Captain FRANK ENO,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

I have the following additional facts from same source as my forme dispatch: The man was captured near Glasgow by Kennedy, with whom he is well acquainted. Eastern column of rebel force will strike Macon City. The other two columns will strike a point west of that; appear to be diverging westward. The column are commanded by Jackman, Kennedy, and Shelby, under command of Marmaduke. I have no doubt of the reliability of this.

A. J. HARDING,

Lieutenant and Aide-de-Camp.
