Most respectfully, your obedient servant,

P. S.- Shall I withdraw my cavalry pickets? General Sheridan's command is bivouacked directly in advance of my pickets, and probably has pickets several miles outside of my line.

Major General A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

I moved against the enemy's forces at this place yesterday; they all fell back over Black Creek, taking a strong position near Tunsstall's Station. During the night the enemy retreated and crossed Bottom's Bridge. I sent General Torbert's division to Jones' Bridge this morning. Have not yet learned whether or no General Torbert has secured the crossing at that place. I shell start the trains tonight for Jones' Bridge, and hope to get everything off by to-morrow morning. I have in the trains here 800 wagons.

P. H. SHERIDAN,
