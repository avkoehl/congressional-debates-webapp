INDIANAPOLIS, IND., July 26, 1861

JAMES LESLEY, JR.,

Chief Clerk;

Am I understanding your dispatch as an acceptance of my recent offer of ten additional regiments? The commission of W. C. Darlington [Tarkington] as commissary of Second Brigade of Indiana Volunteers has not been received. Please answer immediately.

O. P. MORTON,

Governor.

WAR DEPARTMENT,

Washington City, July 26, 1861.

Governor O. P. MORTON,

Indianapolis, Ind.:

Your understanding of the acceptance is correct. It is for the ten additional regiments which you offer.

JAS. LESLEY, JR.,

Chief Clerk.

BURLINGTON, IOWA, July 26, 1861.

Honorable SIMON CAMERON,

Secretary of War:

Am I to understand your dispatches as requiring three or four additional infantry regiments? The horses for the Second Cavalry Regiment must be furnished by you, and should be brought here. Mr. Vandever and Mr. Hoffman have no regiments. Is [it] your request that I accept their regiments? That I appoint them to colonelcies? Will furnish the regiments as required, but may need a little more time. Will furnish the men for the two batteries at this place and Council Bluffs. Can I raise a company of mounted men for defense against Indians? It is needed. Answer to Davenport.

SAMUEL J. KIRKWOOD

Governor.

WAR DEPARTMENT.

July 26, 1861

Honorable FRANCIS THOMAS,

Frederick, Md.;

SIR: The four companies of cavalry offered by you-one to be attached to each of the four regiments of infantry heretofore accepted-are accepted for three years or the war. This acceptance is with the distinct understanding that the Department will revoke the commissions of all officers who may be found incompetent for the proper discharge of their duties. You will advise Adjutant-General Thomas at Washington, the date at which the men will be ready for mustering, and he will detail an officer for that purpose.

By order of the Secretary of War:

JAMES LESLEY, JR.,

Chief Clerk War Department.
