The men must consider themselves the protectors of the people east of the Mississippi, and desist from everything to excite them or molest them unnecessarily. All unwarranted individual foraging must be peremptorily stopped, and the officers made strictly responsible for the acts of their inferiors.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
