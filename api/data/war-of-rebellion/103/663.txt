mand. The objects of the expedition are similar to those indicated in my letter to you of November 27 [26],* and General Grant says, "Let there be no delay." Please get me off as soon as possible.

GEORGE STONEMAN,

Major-General.

LOUISVILLE, KY., February 6, 1865.

General A. C. GILLEM,

Nashville, Tenn.:

I have just received orders from General Grant directing a movement, in which your fine body of Cossacks is to play a very important part, and I would advise you to put them in condition to take the field as soon as possible. I am only awaiting the arrival of General Thomas, in Nashville, to leave here. Can I aid you in any way?

GEORGE STONEMAN,

Major-General.

LEXINGTON, KY., February 6, 1865.

COMMANDING OFFICER TWELFTH KENTUCKY CAVALRY, Lebanon, Ky.:

Move with your command from Lebanon to Glasgow and report arrival at Glasgow to these headquarters. Leave company at Cave City and draw rations from there.

By order of Brigadier-General Hobson:

J. S. BUTLER,

G. F. BARNES,

Major, Commanding.

MEMPHIS, February 6, 1865. (Received 16th.)

Major-General THOMAS,

Eastport, Miss.:

My informants state that all of Hood's army, except Stewart's corps, have gone to Branchville, S. C., and that Jan have accompanied Corinth.

N. J. T. DANA,

Major-General.

GENERAL: I think in this cipher "accompanied" should read "occupied." I don't know what "Jan" means. Am at a loss to account for the delay of this message, which was just handed me, in the handwriting of the Paducah operator.

Very respectfully,

W. R. PLUM.
