thosedifficulties, and it ia the greater part of a year
since Congress unanimously decided that we nave
a right to the disputed territory And yet, as far
as -we have any information before lis, the Ex-
ecutive Government seems to have been .sleeping,
instead of availing itself of the difficulties in the
British provinces, and, worse than that, instead
of our profiting by the Canada disturbances, or
availing ourselves of any advantages from them
whatever, the whole profit of them has been de-
rived from Great Britain And how is it that
Great Britain has taken advantage of the insur-
rection in Canada ? She has taken the opportunity
to throw into her provinces a force of from fifteen
to thirty thousand men, and under what pretext 
That they were to suppress insurrection But if
there had been peace there, and the United States
had seen regiment after regiment and corps after
corps thus thrown into the provinces, would we
not have increased our military means ? But Great
Britain, thus increasing her force  under cover of
silencing Canada, is now ready for war, and may
at once, with advantage, enter into hostilities with
«s, while our Government, instead of pressing
the negotiation, has been asleep, and there has
been no increase of the means on our part to meet
the increased dangers of war Therefore I say,
that while, from these events, we have failed to
denve any profit, which should have been wholly
our own, Great Britain has been benefited to a
great extent, while she has just so far placed us
at a disadvantage, and while I say this, I repeat
that it is no matter whether the negotiation was
tardy or sppedy in its consummation, Mame has
no right, in consequence of such taidmess, to
assume the functions of a common authouty, and
to plunge the country into a war We nio not
represented by Mamo nor by Govoinoi Fairfield,
and I do not choose that Maine should take on
herself the lesponsibihties of entering into a war
with a foreign Power, not only without the con-
Bent of the common Government, but without
that of any of our citizens except those of Maine
Mr President, my voice is for peace, as Ion 
ns it can be maintained consistently with the
honor and interest of the country But the ncgo
nation has bsen unreasonably long, and I hope
the two parties, aioustd by recent o<furientes,
will see tiienecessity of terminating it as soon as
piaeticablu It would be a sony spectacle to see
two kindied nations mailing into a state of wai,
without its duration being foreseen, for the sake
of five or six millions of waste land, the whole
of which would not bo woilh thoexpensc of such
0  war for two or thiee months Yet I must say
that, holding tlio opinion that Great BiHam has
not the shadow of a ilaim to this tenitorv, and
that the clear right of Mamo has been nil ead y too
long withheld from her, if we now foibeai suffi-
ciently, and if at tho termination of the negotia-
tion we have no lesouice left but the final resort
of nations, 1 repiat we shall be furnished with
the contingency of a just war, which will be filt
to be so by the people of the United Slates, and
Will be appiovea by Heaven, and m such a wai
1  do not fiar but that mu country will come out
of it gloriously and tuumpliantly, as it always
has done in its contests with that Power
Mi NORVELL said that he would suggest to
his honorable friend from Maine [Mi Wn-
iu«s] the expediency of modifying his motion
to strike out the whole of the founh resolution
reported by the Committee on Foreign Relatione,
and of limiting himself to a proposition to strike
out the second clause of that resolution The
first branch of the resolution expressed the opin-
ion of the Senate, that " should the British au-
thorities refrain from attempting the military oc-
cupation of the temtoiy m dispute, and from
enforcing their claim to exclusive junsdietion
over it by arms, that then the State of Maine
ought, on her part, to pursue a course of similai
forbearance " The forbearance here suggested
to Maine amounted eimplv to this that she
ought not, pe ndmg the negotiation, to attempt the
military occupation of the territory ih dispute,
should not claim Ihe exercise of an exclusive
jurisdiction over it by orms, if the British authoi-
ities desisted from any such occupation and
claim So far, he thought, the Senate might be
justified in going upon this subject But they
ought not to go further     They ought not to de-
clare that should the State of Maine refuse to
forbear, as recommended, "and determine to
settle the controversy for herself by force, the
adjustment of which is intrusted by the Constitu-
tion to the Federal Government, in such an event
there will be no obligation imposed on this Gov-
ernment to sustain her by military aid." When
this body were called upon to make this declara-
tion, they were invoked to violate the Constitu-
tion of the United States, to fly directly in its
face, and to absolvo themselves from the solemn
duty of discharging one of their highest obliga-
tions to the several States of this Union The
fourth section of the fourth article of the Federal
Constitution provides that "the United States
shall guaranty to every State in this Union a re-
publican form of government, and protect each
of them from invasion "
It was manifest from this provision that the
Federal Government could not, under any cir-
cumstances, withhold its military aid from any
State of the Union to repel foreign invasion No
matter what might induce that invasion, no mat
ter whether the act of Maine may have provoked
it or not, let the invasion come, and this Govern-
ment would have no alternative, it must yw Id its
military aid promptly and effectually to that State,
it must march up to the rescue He would never
consent to tin eaten a sovcrugnibtate of this Union,
as the latter clause of ihe resolution did, to with-
hold our aid from hei in the i vent that any action
on her part should cause her invasion from abroad
We could not stand coldly by, and si o Maine
crushed by a powerful European kingdom, who
was seeking to extend her dominions on this con-
tinent, as well as in every other quarter of the
globe 1 he constitutional injunction is unquali-
fied The State of Maine certainly owed it to the
Genera] Government that the question of peace oi
wai should be left to its decision Nor did she
appear to have entertained any design of waging
war without our pr< vious stviiCtton It was not
necessary to menace her, in anticipation, u ith
our diaplittstiie It was not m cessniy to K II her
that, il she did not pursue n course cxnttly am h
as we might dictate, w< should not hi bound to
rend r hei efli etive military assistance against a
I foiugn invader She deserved no such rehuke,
no sue h llire at, at our hands Mie hid enduteei

toiy till endui incc had censed to be a virtue Tor

He was willing to h t the resolutions of the Com
miltee on I'oieign delations pass, modified as he
had suggested to his luend fioni Maine, if they
were followed up, as he ti usted they would be,
by an act of Congi ess giving millionty lo the 1 x-
ceutivo to raise force s, and to eflecta loan, for the
vindication of the rights of Maine and the honor
of the nation.
Mi CLAY, of Alabama, said- It is net indis-
pensable for us to say what we will do in such
and such oontinge ncies it is enough for us to de-
teimine what we will do at piesent, and I theie-
loie ask a division of the question on the founh
res ilution, so that we may first deiieleon the fust
bianeh, which is the expiession of n meie opin-
ion that M une ou^ht to forbear and then on the
second, which I think disiespcctful to Maine,
ind I would not appear as attempting to mtimi
elate hei with a thieat of withdiawing the aid of
the Gove i nment in any event
Mr BUCHANAN    I have said all I intended
to say on this subject, and I leave it entirely with
the Senate, stating this, howevei, that I believe
the last clause of the fourth resolution is more
important than all the rest     It is no threat, but
simply a statement that we will not be under ob-
| ligation to brin  the United Slates forces to the
aid ol Maine, if she goes out of the pale of the
i Constitu Kin by occupvin°"the disputed territory
I with a military foice   and if the last resolution
, is stricken out, I do not think the resolutions
ought to pas<i
Mi WILLIAMS now moved to strike out the
last clause of the foiuth ie«olutii>n, denying the
obligation of the United States to suppoit Maine
m case of hei not withdiawing it New Bruns-
wick should withdraw
Mr CALHOUN said it was a subject of very
gre*at regret that there was any difficulty in regard
to these resolutions. The opinion of the Senate
on this subject ought to be unanimous He had
examined the resolutions with care, they weio
evidently drawn up so as to operate  most effect-
ually, and, in his opinion, the part proposed to
be stricken out constituted much of the essence
of the resolutions
We here propose (said Mr C ) that, if the Brit-
ish authorities do not attempt to assert their claim
to exclusive jurisdiction, then Maine is to retire;
and I ask, m that case, ought not Maine to retire'
According to herown declaration, she did not un-
dertake to hold military possession of the territo
ry, but simply to drive off intrudeis, and when
that is done, can she in good faith remain * And
I next ask, can it be derogatory to Maine for us
to say that if Great Britain will refrain from as-
serting exclusive jurisdiction, we also will do so?
Sir, we are on the edge of a precipice. Although
the right of Maine is clear to us and certain, yet
it is a matter in dispute between the parties We,
on our part, can trust Maine; but Great Britain
ought to have the assurance that Maine willwilh-
diaw H Britain will forbear And we ought to bo
unanimous in measures in regaid to this subject
1 think the coontiy owe this very able committee
their thanks for these resolutions
Mr  ALLEN said    This is a subject which in-
volves the relations between this and a foreign
country, and yet we are speaking of one of the
States of this Union, which is but a part of tho
whole, as being in  contest with Great Btitain
Sn, on such a subject I know of no such power
as the State of Maine, and I will not admit, for a
moment, that one of the States can, by any pos-
sibility, commit an act which will throw it on the
meicy of an armed world    This Government was
formed chiefly in  relation to the external part of
the world, mid in wai I will know nothing about
the several States, and nothing but the entire Re-
I public     You make an assumption here that if
' Maine does so and so, you will tinn her out   Sit,
I will not admit the assumption that Maine can
do in ae t that will take hei out of the piote ction
of  this Government     Right or wrong, I am for
¡In   tommy, and the whole country, and lam,
the re fore, in ttivor of striking out the last clause
of this r« solution
|      Mi   BUCHANAN said    I repeat that I con-
side i the last part of ihe fourth resolution as the
metst lmpottiuit pirt of the whole matter, and,
' le&t this temblé anathema against a positive lee-
ommondation of the Biisident may occasion some
I more response, I will read an extract from his
I message, which declares
i     " I hest ire «tilt niy vie ws on the luhreei, nnel until tlm

Sir, the íesolution is not so stiong as this It
does not negatne our going to the aid of Maine,
if she does not comply with the terms of the res-
olution, but merely asserts that we are, in that
case, not undei obligation to aid her, and that is
the  whole of it
Mi N1LLS spoke in favor of the resolution,
and of the ptit pioposeel to be stricken out, urg-
ing that Maine was now acting under a false lm
pression in regard to the views of the Genera!
Government, and it was therefore their duty to
undeceive her
The Senator from Kentucky (said Mr N ) has
represented this as a controversy about a few
million acres of wild land It is not a question
of millions, but of the rights and honor of the
country Butain has refused all negotiation on
i the tienty of 1783 and is not tliata vntual denial
I of our rightsJ Sir, I would carry our foi bearance
no further, but assert our right at once I would
authouze the Executive to say that out forbear-
ance is exhausted, and that furtbei delay neither
consists with the peace nor the honor of this
country
Mr SOUTHARD, having read the fourth res-
olution, said he was opposed to smiting out any
part of it I think it necessaiy (he said) to the
former pait of the lesolutious And it is but a
declaration of their resalta as to the matter of om
I duty   I soeak not of feeling, but of constitutional
