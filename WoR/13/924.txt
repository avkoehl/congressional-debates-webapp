
Upon ascertaining these facts and consulting with General Wessells, who was present, he advised me to retire, as I was unsupported by infantry or artillery, and would be liable to be cut off by advancing, and my command fired on by the enemy's infantry under cover of the woods, without the power of making an effectual resistance.

I sent Major Clendenin to the gunboat on the river with a request to throw a few shells in the woods, where the enemy was plainly visible; but he could not get on board, and did not know the private signals, and the boat would not send on shore to communicate with him; consequently I returned to camp with the command, after examining all the houses and ground, so far as we advanced, for stragglers or wounded, but found none.

On opening the fire the boat immediately put out her lights. She was struck several times and considerably injured, but succeed in passing the battery.

On the night of the 6th instant the same guns, accompanied by a section of Rogers' battery, proceeded to a point known as Wyanoke, on the banks of the James, some 4 miles below Charles City Court-House, and about 7 o'clock in the morning of the 7th opened on a transport, and after some twenty shots made her turn back, throwing overboard part of her cargo to facilitate her escape. Several gunboats of the enemy immediately came to our vicinity and commenced shelling the woods and fields, but without damage.
