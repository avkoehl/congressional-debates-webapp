P. S. - The sick and stragglers, without passes and with their arms, come in large numbers daily to the city by the railroad trains. No guard at either end and no officer on the trains. Trains make three trips each way daily.

They insist on your saying where you propose taking up your line in case Richmond falls. If you choose to tell them, send me a courier early in the morning, with such information as you think proper.

Yours,

A. H. COLE.

General HUGER, Petersburg, Va.:

Captain Blackford leaves to night for Mill Rock to post sharpshooters from that point (on the south side of the James River) to the obstructions. Captain John J. Clarke, at Chaffin's Bluff (north side of river), will post below that point. Major Stevens will direct the whole.

Lieutenant CHARLES P. MASON,

Provisional Engineer Corps, Drewry's Bluff:

DEAR SIR: Captain William Blackford has been directed to post sharpshooters below you on the right bank of James River. Extend to him every facility consistent with a due regard to your own work. He may have need for a few tools for rifle pits; if so, let him have them, if possible. Some rifle pits at Drewry's would also be advisable. Major Stevens, of the Confederate Engineer Corps, will take charge of the whole defense in the morning.

Very respectfully, yours,

ALFRED L. RIVES,

Acting Chief Engineer Bureau.

RICHMOND, VA., May 14, 1862.

General B. HUGER, Petersburg, Va.:

Send immediately General Mahone, with his brigade, or part of it, to Drewry's Bluff. Let him land at Proctor's Creek, on the Petersburg Railroad.

R. E. LEE,

General.

[Indorsement.]

Respectfully forwarded for information of General J. E. Johnston, commanding, &amp;c.

By order of General Lee:

W. H. TAYLOR,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
