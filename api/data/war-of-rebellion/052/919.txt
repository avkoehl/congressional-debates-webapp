HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,Chattanooga, October 1, 1863.

Respectfully returned.

The general commanding requested a revision of the within report, and a careful examination of the figures of the same, to prove if it be made out accurately and correctly. Also requests that the same be reforwarded at the earliest possible moment.

Very respectfully,

HENRY M. CIST,

Lieutenant and Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS TWENTY-FIRST ARMY CORPS,October 5, 1863.

Respectfully returned.

The return by regiment sent yesterday shows the effective force to be 11,310, making a deficit of 733 on this report, which I think is very satisfactorily accounted for by the accompanying division reports. The principal item is the Twenty-first Kentucky, present at the time of making, and included in the present report, but absent on detached service and not reported in the regimental reports.

T. L. CRITTENDEN,

Major-General, Commanding.
