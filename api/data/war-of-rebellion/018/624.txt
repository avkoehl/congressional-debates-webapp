J. H. D.:

If you can furnish locomotives to haul them, I think I can arrange with Mr. Koontz to let the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad cars, loaded with troops, go directly through to Alexandria, on my promise to have the cars unloaded promptly and immediately returned by you to Washington. What say you to this?

The first two regiments will arrive about noon to-morrow.
