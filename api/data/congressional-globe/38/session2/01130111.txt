During the call,
Mr. ORTH stated that his colleague, Mr. Ju-
lian, was confined to his room by sickness.
Mr. HIGBY stated that Mr. Woodbridge was
absent on account of sickness.
Mr. HUBBARD, oflowa, made asimilar state-
ment in reference to Mr. Allison.
When the result of the vote had been an-
nounced,
Mr. FARNSWORTH said: Mr. Speaker, is
there a quotum ?
The SPEAKER. A quorum is not in attend-
ance.
Mr. STEVENS rose.
Mr. FARNSWORTH. I rise to a question of
order.
The SPEAKER. The gentleman will state it.
Mr. FARNSWORTH. No quorum appeared
on the last vote, and business is not in order.
Mr. WILSON. I move to reconsider the vote
by which the House tefused to order a call uf the
Ilouse.
The SPEAKER. No quorum being present
arrests business.
Mr. CRAVENS. I move that the House do
now adjourn.
The House refused to adjourn, there being, on
a division—ayes 37, noes 39.
The SPEAKER. The motion to reconsider
the vote by which the House refused to order a
call of the House has not been received generally,
although under the strict language of the rule it
may. be; for under the rules a motion for a call
of the House may be renewed, like a motion to
adjourn, after other business has transpired.
Mr. WILSON. I withdraw my motion, and
move that there be a call of the House.
The motion was agreed to.
Mr. ELDRIDGE. It is apparent that we can
do no business, and I therefore move that the
House do now adjourn.
The motion was disagreed to.
The Clerk proceeded to call the roll, and the
following members fai led to answer to their names:
Messrs. James C. Allen, Allison, Arnold, Blaine, Bliss,
Boutwell,Brandegee,JamesS. Brown, Ambrose W. Clark,
Freeman Chnke, Clay, Coffrnth, Creswoll, Dawson, Deny-
ing, Driggs, Dumont, Edgerton, English, Fenton, Finek,

B. Washburne, William B. Washburn, Wheeler, Chilton
A. White, Joseph W. White, Wilder, Benjamin Wood,
Fernando Wood, and Woodbridge.
Mr. BEAMAN moved thatall further proceed-
ings under the call be dispensed with.
Mr. HUBBARD, of Iowa, stated that his col-
league, Mr. Allison, was detained from the
House by illness.
The SPEAKER announced that eighty-nine
members had answered to their names, three less
than a quorum.
Mr. STEVENS. Probably we shall not be
able to get a quorum to-day. It does seem un-
kind, after we have granted so liberal an adjourn-
ment of two weeks for the holidays, that gentle-
men should not stay here, and that wo should
thus lose one more day. But I do not see any
remedy for it, and I therefore move that the House
do now adjourn.
Mr. FA'RNSWOPiTH. I make no point of
order, and I trust the House will not adjourn. I
understand thf gentleman from Pennsylvania is
desirous to speak to-day.
Mr. STEVENS. I do not wish to speak un-
less a quorum be present.
The SPEAKER. The Chair is notaware how,
after a call of the House and no quorum appear-
ing, the matter can be waived by unanimous con-
sent. The House is in that dilemma that it must
send for the absentees or adjourn.
Mr. FARNSWORTH. I desire to say a word
in explanation of the motion I made. The House
was liberal when it agreed to an adjournment of
two weeks for the Christmas holidays. Yesterday
unanimous consent was asked by some member
of the House that no business should be trans-
acted to-day, and it was refused. We came here
supposing there would be a quorum present for
the transaction of business, and find that members
have left. I think that the piactice growing up
is a bad one, that when we adjourn to a particu-
lar day members regard it as an adjournment from
the day before and go off leaving the House with-
out a quorum. If is unfair to the members who
remain. It is unfair to the country.
Mr. WILSON. I insist on the motion that the
House do now adjourn.
Mr. SPALDING- demanded the yeas and nays.
The yeas and nays were ordered.
The question was taken; and it was decided in
the negative—yeas 22, nays 64, not voting 96; as
folio ws:

So the House refused to adjourn.
The question recurring upon the motion of Mr.
Beaman, that all further proceedings under the
call be dispensed with, it was put and decided in
the affirmative.
Mr. NOBLE. I move that the House do now
adjourn.
The motion was not agreed to.
Mr. RANDALL, of Pennsylvania. By way
of compromise, I have a suggestion to make. I
would like to inquire of the Speaker whether it is
not possible that we can go into the Committee of
the Whole on the state of the Union, so as to give
to any gentleman who desires to speak the oppor-
tunity to do so, with an understanding that after
we come out of the Committee of the Whole no
further proceedings of a business character shall
be had in the House.
The SPEAKER. The Chair will state that he
is unaware of any mode by which the House, in its
present dilemma, can proceed to do any business
unless a quorum is present. It is a constitutional
provision that a quorum shall be present to do
business.
Mr. RANDALL, of Pennsylvania. Cannot
we suspend the Constitution a moment or two?
[Laughter.]
Mr. WILSON. I move there be a call of the
House, and upon it demand the yeas and nays.
The yeas and nays were ordered.
Mr. MORRILL. I move that the House do
now adjourn.
Mr. SPALDING. Upon that I demand the
yeas and nays.
The yeas and nays were ordered.
MESSAGE FROM TIIK SENATE.

their Secretary, announced that the Senate had
passed a joint resolution (S. No. 88) suspending
the sale, by sealed bids, of the lands of the Kan-
sas and Sac and Pox Indians, in which the con-
currence of the House was requested.
ADJOURNMENT AGAIN.
