May 20, 1864-10.50 p. m.

General GILLMORE:

Your dispatch dated 7.30 p. m. was received at 10.30. You had better draw in your line according to the suggestions of my dispatch of 5.30 p. m. The weakness of your works requires this and that we take no risk. You will see to it that strong working parties are kept busy upon the line during the night. Card against surprise.

I think it well to ask for details from Eighteenth if we are to fight again to-morrow.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

ED. W. SERRELL,

Colonel of Engineers, New York Volunteers.
