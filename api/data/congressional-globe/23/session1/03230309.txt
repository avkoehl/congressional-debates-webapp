THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
309
inhabitants of the county of Providence, nearly
all freeholders, and voters, that they aie the very
backbone of the Democracy of the country, and,
in point of intelligence and moral worth, would
not suffer in comparison with the same number of
signers of any memorial presented to Congress at
the present session Mr. P said, since the me-
morial was put into his hands, he had examined
the list of signers, many of whom he knew, and
fully believed that what was said of all of them was
correct
Mr P also presented a memorial, signed by a
great number of the citizens of Br stol, Rhode
Island, approving of the course of the Administra
tion in the removal of the deposites, and adverse
to the recharter of the Umtad States Bank
He took occasion to say, that he had now a me-
morial in such a form as would be received by the
House, that it was headed by a venerable gentle-
man, John D'Wolf, in every way as respectable |
as the Hon James D'Wolf, his brother, whose j
name was at the head of the memorial from the
county of Bristol, presented by his colleague on
Monday last, that this memorial was also signed
by Jacob Babbitt and Parkei Borden, men highly
respectable, who are—as is John D'Wolf—pres-
idents of banks in the State of Rhode Island. He
moved that these memorials be read, laid upon the
table, and'prmted
The SPEAKER presented a memorial from the
town of Stratford, Connecticut, approving of the
removal of the deposites, and protesting against
the recharter of the bank
On motion of Mr HUNTINGTON, the memo-
ral was read, laid on the table, and ordered to be
printed.
Petitions were presented by Messrs SLADE
and EVERETT, of Vermont, WARD, DICK-
SON, FULLER, and LAWRENCE
Mi BEARDSLEY presented a memorial from
the town of Pittsford, Monroe county, New York,
approving of the couise of the Government in re-
gard to theUmteu Slates Bank, protesting against
its recharter, and denying the existence of any pub-
lic and general distress in that vicinity, or within
their knowledge. Read, ordered to be*pnnted,and
laid on the table
Mr LANSING asked leave to present certain
resolutions adopted by the inhabi ants of the town
of Coeymans, in the county of Albany, and State
of New York, in their annual town meeting assem-
bled, against rechartenng the Bank of the United
Stages, and against the restoration of the public
deposites to that bank.
Mr L said, before those proceedings are read,
I ask the indulgence of the House, while I submit
a few remaiks in reply to, and explanatory of,
some observations made by my honorable col-
league [Mr Selden] from the city of New York, i
when, a few days since, he presented a memoual >
of a diflerent character from a portion of the inhab-
itants of the c ty of Albany
The honoraole member felt himself authorized
to state upon that occasion, that the memorial he
then presented was signed by two thousand eight
hundred persons Mi Speaker, I have been per-
mitted to examine the original of that memorial
upon the files of the Senate, and have myself
counted the number of signatures found upon it.
I now state to the House, fiom my own Knowl-
edge thus derived, that no more than thirteen hun-
dred and sixteen names are signed to the paper,
as it now appeals in possession of the Secretary
of the Senate Where my honorable colleague
gets the additional fourteen hundred and eight/-
iour names which 1 e purported to represent in the
piesentation of that memorial, he may, perhaps,
be able to inform the House                        ,
My honorable colleague (said Mr L ) felt au-
thouzed further to state upon that occasion, that
the memo-.al he then presented spoke the> taguage
and opinions of the people of he district from
which it came, m opposition to the opinions and
action of their .epresentative here, and was the
language of the constituents opposed to the act of
thefr aSent I cannot believe, Mr Speaker, (said
Mr V,) that the respectable committee who bore
that memorial from Albany to this P««f •«"* *™ 
chose to make my honorabI. ^"S™^"0^™
,n us presentation to this House, authorized^these
representations as to the congressional district 1
have the honor to represent here, and I therefore
consider the expressions wholly gratuitous, and
as the opinions, or perhaps I might better say, the
w.shes, of the honorable member from whom they
come
Simultaneously with the presentation by my
honorable colleague of the memorial before spoken
of, I had the honor to present to the House a
counter memorial, signed by fourteen hundred of
the Republicans of Albany, fully approving of
the course of the Executive in the removal of the
deposites, and against the rechartenng of the Bank
of the United States I am personally acquainted
with many of the signers of both memorials, and I
recognise among the names upon each, individuals
as respectable, intelligent, and responsible, as any
of the citizens of that ancient city I will not
detain the House to go into minute particulars as
to the individuals who have signed those memo
rials, but I will take the occasion to say that, wi h
very few exceptions, the politics of the memo-
rialists who sign both, are shown by the respective
papers to be no w what they were in 1832, the time
of the labt congiessional e'ection.
The district from which I come, is composed of
the city of Albany and of nine country towns
The aggregate population of the district at the last
census was 53,560, of this number of soul% 24 238
was the population of the city, and 29,322 the
population of the towns. At the canvass in 1832,
my opponent received a majonty of about 100 of
the votes of the city, and I obtained my election in
the district by a majority of 182    Such was the
evidence of the feeling of the district at that period
Within a few weeks past town elections have been
held in all the towns of the county composing my
district, and* those elections rather show an increase
of strength on the pait of the friends of the National
and State Administrations, than any change un-
favorable to them    These facts I have considered ,
it a duty to myself and my district, to state ex- ,
pheitly ,andhaving done so, I most cheerfully leave
to the judgment of the House to say what credit
is due to the declarations of my honorable col-
league, that the language and opinions of the
people of my district are opposed to the course and
action of their representative  in this body     To
thejudgmentof that oneof my colleagues 1 should
be unwilling to submit the question, as he and
myself might differ much more as to the obliga-
tions of the representative to those who elected
him, than it is likely I shall differ with my most
respected constituents, either as to what is my
duty or their wishes
Mr LEE presented a memorial from citizens ot
Salem county, New Jersey, representing the dis-
tress growing out of the removal of the deposites,
and praying the recharter of the bank. Laid on
the table, and ordered to be printed.
Mr   WARD,  of New York, presented  the
petition of Calvin Pollard, Lafevre and Galher,
Isaiah Rogers, and Seth Green, praying for com-
pensation for the draft of plans for the new custom-
house in New York                                           ,
Mr SCHENCK presented the proceedings and
resolutions of large and respectable meetings, held
m the counties of Somerset and Hunterdon, New
Jersey, app'obatory of the general policy pursued
by the Admimstiation, also, praying that the
United States Bank be not rechartered, and that
the pubhc money be not restored to that mstitu-

Mr. Speaker, in presenting these testimonials
of public opinion, I beg leave to state that, with |
many of the gentlemen who composed the conven-
tion of Somerset, and with some of those who I
convened at the public meeting m Hunterdon, 1
have the pleasure of a personal acquaintance, and
fiom what I know by reputauon of others, I feel
justified in assuring the House, that for intelli-
gence, integrity, and patriotic attachment to the
Constitution, and laws of their country, they will
suffer no disparagement by a comparison with an
equal number of their fellow-citizens in any part
of the Union.                                              ,   ,
The independent electors who constituted the
meetings above referred to, are engaged m various
pursuits Many of them are farmers, who, with
[keirown hands cultivate the soil of which they are
propnetois, and with manly independence enjoy,
as the reward of their industry, a comfortable
competence. Enterprising mechanics ha?e also em-
braced those occasions to declare their wishes and
express their feelings upon this exciting topic—
men, sir, whose hands are hard with useful labor,
and whose hearts are warm with love of country,
and who cheerfully earn their biead by the sweat
of their brow, animated by the proud conscious-
ness that they are American freemen. Profes-
sional men also united in manifesting their anxiety
for their country's best interests. They know,
from the history of former ages, that the inordinate
desire of gain, and the accumulation of money m
the hands of a few, have proved the bane of for-
mer republics Seeing the same dangers impend-
ing over us, they are solicitous to avert the evil
from our yet happy land Mingling with the
meeting, and excited with all the ardor of youthful
aspirations for the welfare of their country, were
to be seen the time worn patriots and veterans of
the Revolution, living witnesses of those deeply
interesting scenes which transpired at that eventful
period" which tried men'a souls." They remem-
bered, with profound concern, the great price
which had been paid for American hbejrty, and
they firmly resolved that the inestimable blessings
which had been gained by heroic valor, undaunt-
ed courage, and unyielding perseverance, should
not be sacrificed to sordid selfishness or pestiferous
venality
But, sir, it is not deemed necessary to detail the
various interests represented at those assemblies of
the people. It is enough to say, that men, highly
reputable and personally interested in the various
avocations which occupy the attention, and call
into exercise the industry, of the community,
participated in the patriotic deliberations of the
respective conventions, men sir, who are conver-
sant with the occurrences of the day, and neces-
sarily acquainted with the pecuniary condition of
that part of the country in which they reside, so
far as it can be ascertained by the usual intercourse
between individuals, were convened upon those
occasions. And, sir, they make no lamentation,
nor do they utter a single expression indicative of
a chilling panic or overwhelming pecuniary em-
barrassment in the resolutions which they design-
ed to have preaented for the consideration of the
House.
If, sir, the amount of money in circulation be
less than it was a few months ago, the people are
apprized of the source of the evil, and will justly
appreciate the motives of an institution which
will thus unfeelingly exercise its power for the
purpaseof inflicting distress upon the community,
in the hope of extorting an assent to recharter a
corporation which the people have already con-
demned, and which they have determined shall
not be tolerated. The decision expressed in the
resolutions on the much-agitated subject of the
United States Bank, I believe to be the deliberate
and fixed opinion of a decided majority of the
citizens of New Jersey. And, sir, I feel persuaded
they will not be diverted from their purpose either
bv the fallacious promises of better times, if the
deposites be restored, or the menacesof want and
rum if the bank be not rechartered.
The issue of bank or no bank was fairlyjomed
and distinctly understood by all the political par-
ties of the country previous to the last presidential
election. The reasons assigned by the President
in his message returning the bill rechartenng the
United States Bank, was definitely submitted to
the people They canvassed with strict scrutiny
that luminous document, andafter full deliberation,
rendered their verdict at the polls. The fact is
notorious, that those opposed to the reelection of
the presentChief Magistrate reminded their fellow-
citizens, in their speeches and through the press,
that if the incumbent were sustained in the high
office he then filled,, the bank must go down The
intelligent freemen of this great Republic were,
therefore, called upon by all parties to declare
their wishes upon this subject, and they responded
to the call by reelecting that distinguished individual
by an overwhelming majanty. The conclusion
is therefore irresistible, that the people, m their
election franchise, indicated unequivocally the r
opinions and their wishes with regard to tlua
institution.                                              .i..„,¡
I feel persuaded, sir, that a majority oftheci ti-
zens of New Jersey have unabated confidence m
the integrity and ability of the Chief Magistrate
And while they contemplate, in the history of hw
