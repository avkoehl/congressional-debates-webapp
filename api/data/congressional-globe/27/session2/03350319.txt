the whole policy of the Government with regard to the disposal
of the public domain He thought it came w Kb. an ill grace
from the State of Alabama, wiuch had received two millions of
acres of public lands in grants and donations, to reproach and
upbraid Congress for the Distribution act
Mi KING interposed, to ask the ¡senator whether he drew
upon his imagination for his statements, or,upon facts'?
Mr ■MILLER replied that his ¡statemeut was based upon
facta
Mr KING requested that the Senator would mention the
facta specifically
Mr MILLER enumerated many item , making up the aggre-
gate by the share allotted in the Distribution, and computing
theschool landsat eight hundred thousand acres
Mr KING explained the right of the States to the school
lands, and corrected the Sena or as to the enoia into which be
had been led in supposing Alabama had received, ether by
grant or donation, any thing that was not her undoubted right
Mr MILLbR supposed if Alabama had not received two mil
lions in land, she had in money and land
He argued at considerable length in justification of the distri
button act, and said he was wiling to go bef ire the people,
with its oppon-nts, on the issue, whether they were to pay lets
direct taxes bv three millions annually, m consequence of die
tnbution, or the landlund was to be restored and they were to
pay three millions more than tnev now pay indirect taxes
As to reverue from customs alone—the only source of reve*
nue to b-1 the jght of—he was willing to go as far as the Sena
tor from K  .tucky desired—to raise twenty sit mill ons for
the purposes of Government    Iftheie was any thing in the
compromisefact to prevent duties or customs being laid to a
Buffiuent extent to i aise revenue for the suppoit oí the Govern*
ment in the necessary exerci eof its powers, he would throw
the act to the winds, for there could be no fair compromise made
on such a principle      But he believed the compromise act set
no such limits to a tariff as gentlemen imagined    The ques
tnn at the time of the Compromise was, how to bnng down the
revenue to the expenses oí theGovernment, but no man in end
ed it should be brought below the expenses, now the ques ion
is, how to raise the revenue to the amount oí the expenses oí the
Government   the principle, set fot th in the resolution he con
tended, was recognized in the\ery clause oí the aet, winch says
the tariffshall be sufhciert foi an economical administration of
the Government    What he asked was me t)  by a  eeonomi
cal administration^   Was it that of Mr Adams of Gene al
Jackson, or of Mi   Van Buren!   lie contended that the next
year after the passage of die Compiomise at t the iuties went
down to thirteen mill or«, and thisveat t icy had come uowi to
ten millions    He contraste 1 tne annua'rtcei   * Irom cits onis
with the annual expenditure, and coi en ee< hat il e late Ad
ministration was bo in J in (hi y to have ha I tin Compromise

He next aiguel in lavoi of the home valuation, and entered
into details m support of his positions, contending that theie
-was no difficulty whatever in coming at the tiue value    But
he thought it was perfectly useless to dwell upon the absolute or
nominal value, asthe twenty six millionswouldraveto be raised
at any rate, and it was of no consequence whether it was done
by a duty of twenty per cent on the home valí c, or tl irty per
cent on the foteign value    There was another question, whe
ther the ad valorem principle alone was to be adhered to, ot
both it and a discriminating principle, which admits of inci
dental protection to th-mdu   íy of the c >t n'rv    He did not
contend that a duty ought to be iail for protection meiely, but
for purposes of revenue affblding incidental pio ection, fol bis
position was tha. the  lncidentil protection necessary for the
encouragement of home manufactures, would he effected by
an ad valorem duty on some articles, and a discriminating
duty on others    He. asked, would H be proper to put fie same
direct tax upon a race horse as upon an old cowl He contended
it was   the practice of Coligiese to discriminate with re
gard  to every new production—evei y new invention , and
Ft   was   a   matter   of   daily   occuirence   to   give   encou
ra ement  to what  is   called  home  labor and  skill, when
it is likely to come in competition witn foreign lab-jr and smll
He admitted that there was great difficulty m drawing the line
so as to mark out where competí ion b°ginsand wheieitmJs
buthe contended that whenevei the line could be diawnit was
the duty of Congitss to pro ect and encourage home ml is

.      Mr LUSHING.   I use to a point oí ordei    Ido    tohjec
to the moving of the lesolutitn, but the objection which I make,
and winch the House does not seem to understand, is that my
colleague is presenting areport from the Committee on Foreign
Affans
Mr ADAMS I made the motion for reference, by direction
of the Committee or Foreign Affairs I move the suspension ot
the i ules not by the direction of that committee, for tile/ had
very little expectation that opposition would be made to it.
The motion to suspend the rules, therefore, is my own The
motion for rtieience, I repeat, is made by the unanimous vote
of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, with the exception of my
colleague
After a br ef convei sation, m which Messrs BRIGGS and
PICKENS participated—
Mr LUSHING then asked the Speaker to state the question
to the House to be a motion to suspend the lules for the pur
pose of rece vmg a report fiom the Committee on Foreign Af-
