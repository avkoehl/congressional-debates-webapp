WARRENSBURG, MO., May 26, 1864. (Received 6.05 p.m.)

General E. B. BROWN,

Kansas City, Mo.:

I will send the stage through as soon as I can furnish the escort. About 100 rebels are 10 miles southwest of this place. All the men that can be spared have been sent after them. I need more men here. I have ordered Company C from Burris' camp. They will not be here until to-morrow night, and propose to order Colonel Philips to send me 100 men, mounted, armed, equipped, immediately, if they can be spared. Neither the stage nor railroad can go on until this band is broken up and dispersed. Please answer.

J. McFERRAN,

Colonel, Commanding.
