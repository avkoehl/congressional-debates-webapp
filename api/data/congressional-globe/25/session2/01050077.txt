confiimmg his statements as to these incidents
Havmg done w hich, he obse'veil ih.it his object
now was to ascertain if the Executive ha' any in-
formation nrKin the subject
Mr. HOWARD said that this resolution hid
been reported by a committee. It was not in his
power to accept or absent to any amendment—a re-
mark which he would make in relation a  well to
the amendment offered by Mr Adams, as to that
proposed bj Mr Fillmore The fact is indisputa-
bly trae, that the position rf affairs upon the Ca-
nada frontier was inll of interest, and even of j"o
pardy, to the relations existing between this Go-
vernment and that of Great Bri am This he should
not «ontrovert
Bu* the remark had been made by Mr Fillmore,
and, Mr Hon ard believed, also by Mr <vdams, in
offering their respective imendmen s that this na-
t on was on die eve of wai with Greit Pntain
lie had regretted to hear llus rpmirk He trusted
it was not correct So far as documents so to show
the intention's, and, indeed, the efforts, of both Go-
\ernments, they had been, and still were, directed
to the preservation of peace, and the security of
neutrality. He trusted that those intentions would
not be changed, and that those efforts would be
continued; and that, if there were no laws now m
existence to prevent breaches of neutrality on the
part of onr citizens, that such laws would bs en-
acted He hoped we were on the e\e of no such
war He believed we were not, but that, on the
contiatv, the country was still preserving, and in-
clined to preserve, the most lofty grounds m the
preservation of neutrality He Knew ot no diffe-
rences existing between tns Government and Great
Britain, exceptm  only that arising; cut ot the po-
sition of the northeastern boundary question Pei-
haps, said Mi H. this may be thought, by some, to
be a faiorable opportunity to press thit subject up-
on Great Butain, but inns net so, in his judgment
Mr. H again aveired thath- housht the u i n-
try far from any dangei ot a war with Gisat Bri-
tain, and he trusted a large majority of the House
agreed with him in this opinion He remarked
that the subject had been referred to a committee,
(Foreign Affairs,) which would give it a serious
and anxious consideration
As to the inquiry proposed by the gentleman
from New York, (Mr Fillmore,) in regard to the
recent even's upon the Niagara frontier, they were
so verv recent that Mr. H doubted if any official
information can have been received w ith legiid to
them At all events, h« was for keeping the in-
formation asked for from the Executive, m re'a-
tion to this subject, and that regarding the Mexi-
can question, disimct and separate Hewasftn
keeping each by itself He was opposed to both
the amendments proposed
Mr ADAMS regretted that the chairman of the
Committee on Foreign Affairs had thought it ne-
cessary to ( ppose the adoption of his am ndment,
and that proposed by the gentleman from New
York Without intending to misrepresent him,
the gentleman (Mr H ) had imputed to him lan-
guage he had not u-ed Hs had not said that he
thought the country on the eve of war with Great
Britain He had said that he viewed the nation
as m imminent danger of such a war, which was
quite another statement, and he hopea that what
the House would now do, and «hat ihe Exec i-
tive would also do, in consequence of the proposed
action of the House, would avert that danger
The gentleman from Maryland had said that
he bad now no control over the reoolu'ion he had
reported from the Commit ee on Foreign Affairs,
and that he «-as not authored to ass nt to the pio-
posed amendments That (Mr A said) was un-
doubtedly true , but it w is also as true lhat he was
not authored by that committee to oppose «uch
amendments He opposed them, if at all, upon
his own personal and individual responsibility, and
it was upon thit ground that he (Mr A ) was re-
plying to his object ons against those amendment
The Committee on Foreign \flain> have no more
dissented from these amendments than they have
assented to them It was, therefore, to be regretted
that such oppuaitioB had been made to them by the
chairman of that committee, and the more because
ibegenttsraau fro  New York (Mr F,) and him-
self, (Mr A) who h-d offered then, do not be-

there Sir, (Mid Mr \ ) we arc likely soon to
be called upon to " toe the ma-k" in matters uprn
which I hope in God we may not be dtv ide 1 by
partv lines We. are neirmg, I fear, a state if
things, «hen it will hardly do to reject proposi-
tions upon important matters, b°civjse ihey do not
come from a particular s <'e ot this body
The question tor us to consider now is, whether
these amendments of my friend fiom New York and
mvself are proper, in the present state of 'hm"s, to
be adopted, and not from what quarter of the House
they may come. Too resolution of the C> mmitiee
on Foreign \ffairs alludes to a single act of hosti-
lity on 'he part of an officer of our own Govern-
ment against the Mexican Go\ eminent, acknow-
ledge! afterwards to have been such bv ihe sibse-
quent conduct of that officer 1 wish, and the
gentleman from New York wishes, to go a litt e
further m I'ns inquiry for information We desire
to obtain from the President of the United States
all the information m his possession as to the di -
feienees existing between Mexico and this Govern-
ment, and between Great Britain and this Gov em-
inent, information, without which the House can-
not possibly act advisedly and effectively He had
(he continued) offerpd his proposition before the
Message of Hie President had been transmitted to
the House, becuse he saw the necessity of ob-
taining all the infe rraation in possession of the Ex-
ecutive m relation to the difluentes existo g be-
tween this nation and Mexico on the one side, and
Great Britain on the other. This message hid
come in as a confirmation of the ptopnety an 1 ne-
cessity of lhat step of hi", refcning,-is ih° House
would perceive it does, as \ ell to out relations wiih
Mpxko, as to thi se with Greit Britain, arid touch-
ed upon onr No>- h°ni as we I is Smiht rn i) in" r-.
And no \ jll he sited « is, thit I i' H p p ent it i 's
of the peorle she old reepies' ol ll c Piesident oi the
United States what is the actual ltuati n of the
country, what hid been done, what wis propose 1
tobe done in lelation to it, what was demanded
on th° one side, and «hat claimed on the other
He had hoptel that a proposition so reasonable
would have been permitted to pass without oppo-
sition Some other rule should be observed, he re-
marked, in matters so momentous, than " toe the
mark " The divisions of party should be broken
up upon questions hl<e these, and they \ bo aie not
m t e eonbdi nee of ihe Executive should leper
m tted to have an opportune of domo- then di tv
by their common countri, as we! as the ch ¡sen
sect
The chiirman of the Committee on Toreigi Af-
faiis, continued Mr Adam10, teds tbegentlemm
from New York that if he will, for th" present,
purge his amendment of so much as relitcs to the
suhject-makeis already treated ot b; the President
of ihe United Stites, in the Message just i cid to
the House he would have no obj"ctu n to it as it
now siands, it the pioper time, and n p distinct
form Now, docs not that gent ennn know that if
hememlerfrom New \oik md mssel were to
forego this inquiiy upon that suggestion, and the
resolution were then to pass, the time would never
come when «e might bring up our propositions"
Wtuld vie net uolh be declared out of or'er lift
we to mihpsnch an attempt' And so we shoul 1
be put off till, peihaps, some time in Tune r ext,
while, in the midst of a war, with the candle burn-
ing a' both ends, when our resi Iutions of irqnrry
muhtb' , at least, 'in order'' Tn  inform ition
«e demmd is asked rot alone for the Committee
on Fi reign Affans, hut for the members of this
body— for their consideiation and the basis of th ir
aclion
Tnis Mecsage, continued Mr \oiws, is a very
important one It demands men—it cal's for the
expenditme of money—for millions m ne to be
added to the millions already lavi^h-d in the at-
tempt to cheek Indian he subtes, and for apmpose
lather more deeply important, he would remark,
than ihe prevention of any Indian hostüit es A
great increase of the army would become necessa-
ry to carry out the suggestions of the President
How great an increase, and how large an expemli-
tu> •>, he e-ojld not sa}, probably all this wou'd be
'novnvvhen t e desued ln'ormauon siali come
from the Execn'ive
This message ^continued Mr Adams) says no-
thing on the subject  f any violation of neutrality
on the Canada sjle Yet such a violation, and
one of ihe grossest chaiacter, had actually taken
p'ace on that side, and idmitted, as it appears, to
be such, bv the British officer himself
Mr 4 said h" thought it pyobable tint this Mes-
sage was prepared before the information which
hid just been laid befoie the House was received
\\ hetner this oe so or not, this Hemse, as wel' as
ihe Fxecutive have a pm to tike in the matter—.
a highly rc-ponsib'e and important part a duly to
perform, m seeing that a strict neutralitv is ob-
served on the part < f this Government and also
that that neutrality be not violated on the o'her
side to tho exten of a single hair, without demand-
ing and ins sting upon the most peifert and full
satisfaction
He hop-d that, if the Cha rman of the Commit-
tee on Foreign Affi r  dies not feel himself aulho-
nzed fo accede to the proposed amendments of his
rtsolut on, the House will feel otherwise dispeseet,
and take such order in relation to the subject as
w ill not postpone the consideration of questions so
important until it shill be too late for any practi-
cal goe d purposes
After ma'ung such a modification of his amend-
ment as to mike it consistent with the original re-
solution,
Mr FILLMORE said he could not conceive how
his pioposmon cmld possibly tend to embarrass
the act on oi the House npon tí e reso1 ition offered
by the Comnntte  oi Foreisn Affurs It was cer-
tiinly vciy eic\ fo th- President to distinguish be-

that m «hieh it no« stood For if it were offeree!
as in mdeoendent resolution, it would take its
place behitic' all others now on the Speaker's table
its great impoitance w ml 1 not permit him to ex-
j.ose it to such ausk and he had, therefore, offered
it m ihe form of an amendment to the original reso-
lution ol the Committee on Foreign Affairs, in
wh ch sh°pe he hoped it would pass
