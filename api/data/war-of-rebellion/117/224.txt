OFFICE COMMISSARY-GENERAL OF PRISONERS,

Detroit, Mich., July 15, 1862.

Captain J. HANDY, Prisoner of War, Sandusky, Ohio.

SIR; Your letter of the 7th* is received. It appears by the papers accompanying your letter that you have served as a medical officer by authority of the medical director, but it appears also that you were a captain in the line, and as the medical director is a subordinate your services in his, department must be looked on as only temporary and you were liable at any time to be recalled to your appropriate duties. Under this view of the case I do not feel at liberty to class you with medical officers. Other cases similar to yours have been laid before the Secretary of War and if the decision is favorable to you I will inform you. Your order is herewith returned.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. HOFFMAN,

Colonel Third Infantry, Commissary-General of Prisoners.

FORT WARREN, Boston Harbor, July 15, 1862.

I have no official information as to the time or place of their capture. It embraces all that I have not before reported.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
