CONGRESSIONAL GLOBl.
Stats of Pennsylvanon Did he not suppose that the Whig
party of the South had any say in this matter? Or were their
views and wishes to be wholly disregarded? The gentleman
might as wel1 appeal to the Whigs of the South to secure the
protection 0f agriculture by laying duties on iron, on salt, on
sugar and molasses Iron was more indispensable to the pool
ftlf&i.ttian coffee or tea, on which such holy sympathy had been
manifested In his behalf; but the gentleman was willing the
poor farmer should pay a high duty on ha plough, yet he must
have his cup of coffee rree
Had the Whig party ever pledged itself, as a party, in favor
of protection? río But there was one pledge which it had
openly made in every State, and county, and city, and hamlet
of the land—a pledge to give, the country a fiscal agent, and to
reform the currency He called on the gentleman irom Penn
sylvama(Mn Irwin) to come up to hi  pledge—to reform the
chrrenGy—am! hat without regaid to Executive dictation
Was the raitleman ready to redeem that pledge? When he
had done that, it would be m somewhat better taste to call on
the Whigs to protect domestic industry But the gentleman
was mistaken The lanff never would or could become a party
question, and so he would find
The gentleman from New York fMr Linn] had «poken not
very lespectfu.W of the gentleman from New liampsh re,
tMr Atherton ] who hid moved this resolution Though
that gentleman was not of Mr R's party, he thanked him
heartily foi the motion he had made It would shotf, ll the
gentleman's subsequent course corresponded to it, that tins

In conclusion, Mi R disclaimed to spe ik % the south"
—he had heard that done till he had been often disgusted—but
ríe would say th tt he believed there was a laige portion of the
people of these Fmted States who nevei would co tsent to see
one great interest m tne country protected and fostered a' the
expense of another and he believed it would fina ly com" fo be

onerous ejtacti m
Mi \THERTQN next obtameiHhe floor, but the point was
raised by Mr Buíler, of South Carolina, and gave rise to con
versation between various members and the Speaker, that Mr
A according to the lules, was not entitled the ñooi, he having
moved the amendment before the House and having, at that
time, submitted some remarks    Mr A yielded the noor to
Mr WM BUTLER ol South Catalina, who proposed to
make a brief reply to some rtmatks %vhich had fallen from
gentlemen who had pieceded hirn So lar as the isolated ques
tion now at i^sue was coi cetned, he ce nsidered c f /ery little
importance to which committee the reference of this portion of
the message should be made &o fat as the composition oí the
two committees was concerned there was little difference m
them, but, on the srround of principle, all qu stions leiating to
revenue should pro, erly be refe red to the Committee of Ways
and Means Iftheque^ ou was settled that they should Jay a
tanfl of duties for the protection of manufactures, it would be
proper to make the refcience to the Committee on Mu ufac-
tures. But such he understood, was not the case rihis was
said to be a tanfi forrevetiue,oratarifT(o raise means bywhich
to carry on the opera 101 s of Government Ihat being its
character and object, theie was no íeason why they should as
sign itto a committee whose object and oigamzation was the
protection of iranufacuiies
The gentleman from Maryland |Mr Sowers] had a very
summary method of disposii g of all particulars in the way of
his conclusions He had made allusions to the State of South
Carolina He had said tnat ¡state was occupied by a few
heretical theories, but he had not examined them, he had de
Glared, in simple denunciation only, that the op.mons enter
tamed in Sot th Carolira were ridiculous and absurd He had
not only not examined the chaiacter and pnncip'es of bouth
Carolina, hut he bad mw eprcserted them Ineio wis no
party in South Carolina that was hostile to manufactuie*, or

people would rejoic-more at it, but they wereunwiihrgto see

occasion to allude to the course of South Carolina on this subject
in such a mannei as clearly r roved that they did not u idei«tdnd
her principles If, in the examination of the couise that has
been laden by South Car dina, tht y attacked hei principles, let

that this property should be secure to them, that th / were to
&a allowed the same privileges undei the Constitu'ijn and that
was the ground on which this Constitution was ratified by South
Carolina, that they (the North) had with íespect to th ir free
labor And now the unblushing effronteiy was exercised by
the gentleman to come on this floor, and say that he would
disiegard all these obligations, and destroy their property,
sooner that1 h s favorite interests should not be protected
Mr LINN requested the floor for an explanation, which be
mg granted, he said that the gentleman from South Caí olma had
been either very inattentive, or had entirely foi gotten what he
(Mr L ) had said He did not in the first instance, or finally,
make the distinction between slave and fiee labor He had ex
pressed his regret that this issue was so unnecessarily made be
fore them on this and kindred questions and had then said if
this issue must be made—if in the adjitstmentof the tariff the
question was, which system shall you support, the free or
slave system? he felt hound, m duty and conscience to go m
favor of the free system, and he trusted, as an American
ritmen, he m'ght be permitted to avow these principles on this
floor
Mi BUTLER continued He had misunderstood the gentle
man The gentleman had put the condition that if this ques
Hon weie raised, he should take the side which he said he was
bound to take in philanthiopy it was against this sentiment that
he (Mr B ) had contended—a sentiment which common hones
ty, good faith, and ill legard to constita'ional obligations would
never sanction No man who h d watched the course of things
m this fatovernment, and the circumstances in which the Consti
tution was ratified by the States, could deny the fact that slave
la! n came into thi„ Government exactly on the very footing
with other laboi
Tne gentleman from New lersey [Mi R.andolfh] and the
gentleman fiom Pennsylvania [Mi Irwin] had called on the
Whi^sof theSouth to raily undei then sttndard, pnd support
protection He, (Mr B ) as one of the Whig party, never ap
pearcd with such a standard, he recognised none such, he had
come forward to correct the abuses of this Gt vemment, which
tnev (the Whigs) behsve J had crept into every crevice and de
partment of this Government They believed the finances of
this coun ry were deranged, that the currency had been affected
by the operation of this Government, and he had come foiward
to assist them to remove these difficulties, buthe had never ex
pcted to be hailed by gentlemen frori the North, in this bold
ind barefaced effrontery, to come Joiwaid and assist them m
iaymir taxes on the South, foi the benefit of Northern labor
Gentlemen had said thev were for protecting domestic labor,
meaning to exclude «lave labor They would say, as a gentle
man had remarked yestei lay, that South Caiolina might be
const lered m this country under peculiar circumstances, hut
not when the question of free and slave labor "vas considered
All duties laid by this Government on foreign amele-, were to
thit extent a benefit andas istance to domestic manufactures,
wbefher the duly was ten, fifteen, tweoiy, or twenty five per
cent Í he moment they carried the t uty to such an extent as
to prohibit theini.ro Suction of foieig articles,  t was exclusive
ly a duty for piotec ion and not for revenue, and the very oh
j ct of Government would be directed to the protection of ma
n ifactiiiis As understood the ques ion now submitted was,
whethei, i ifthisadjustment of the tariff, they would confine it
to the puipo e Oi raising tevenue necessary lor the most eco
lomical administration of Government
Thus fai ho was as willing to go as anybody, he was in
favor of sjch a tariff but the moment they transcended iu they
carried duties so high as no* only to desuoy levenne, but ex
elude íor^igr ai tides, and this he could never sanction Let it
be called a tanff foi íevenite by its ptoper name and it would
he understood, if they did not intend i-uch a tariff as was laid
in IS2ü, which was said to be a tauff foi revenue, when its
whole character was for piotection if they would come for
ward and lay atarif of duties for the support of thisGovern
ment, he woule! most coi dully vote foi suth atanfl, and sub
scnbc to itsdoctimes
Allusion hid been made to t1 e piotection the South receives
on her cotton but he had heird no geni lemán pretend to inti-
ma e that this was not meiely a nominal duty Whence
might the South expect to meet competition lor her cotton?
It hid been said, fiom the Ei"f Indies but this v/asnot now the

wi h some in one particuii1* he had not defii itelv fixed the time
when the event would happer, but had said "the ti ne was not
far distant" when the South would appear m this Hall with
appeals for the protection of manufactuies He Mr B could
not^siv whether the gentleman was correct, but he now saw no
ludftriiions ii the kind whatever, he wasi ot able to contest the
question when it would happen
