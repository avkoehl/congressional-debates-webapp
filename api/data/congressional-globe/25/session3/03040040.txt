Dry Docks—Mr. Elmore, Mr. Hoffman, etc.
Ho. of Reps
principles High taxes, a national debt, a large
navy, and a standing army, are among the old
and favorite themes of the Federal party. But
those professing Democrats who, when at home,
wish their constituents to believe that they are
opposed to Federal doctrines and measures, will
find some trouble to reconcile their votes in this
House for measures, the inevitable consequences
of which are to increase the taxes, create a na-
tional debt in time of peace, build up a navy and
army, and all the necessary appurtenances be-
longing to them, with Democratic doctrines and
their own professions Mr P said he came to
Congress the representative of Democrats who
■were the uncompromising advocates of " equal
rights," were willing to be taxed when it was
necessary for the support of Government, the
protection of the country's rights, or the aveng-
ing of its wrongs But his constituents were op-
posed to the extravagant expenditure of the reve
nue in useless and expensive woiks They were
opposed to raising money by taxing unnecessarily
the many for the use of the few In fact, their
maxim was the old Democratic creed of equal and
exact justice to every part of the nation, and they
did not wish to take their neighbors' property
illegally, nor invade his rights, nor were they
willing to have their propeity illegally taken, nor
their constitutional nghtB invaded
Mr P said that he had endeavored, during the
two last sessions of Congress, to adhere to and
support the true Democratic principles That, on
a late occasion, his conduct had been canvassed
before his constituents, and he felt proud of their
yerdict of approval of his political course Hehad
uniformly voted against all appropinations of the
nature of those contained in the bill now before the
committee He should willingly vote for money
to keep up as many vessels oí war as the service
of the country required, and for navy-yards and
dry-docks enough for all the purposes of keeping
our present navy in good repair
Mr. P said he was not a little amused to wit-
ness with what avidity and zeal members from a
particular section, whose constituents were to re
ceive the benefit of those appropriations, pressed
the passage of bills to raise money for their own
particular districts     They foiget all their profes-
sions of Democracy, and then principles, wl en-
ever money was held up to their view, and they
spiung at it like a mackerel at a red ian     Uemle
men might clamor and laugh at his language, but
he would tell them that lie «tpoke the language of
sincerity and truth, as he had been taught to do
from his cradle     lie had always been taught to
advocate his principles feailessly, in all places, i
and on all occasions, and he would do so now m |
spite of the clamor of any man, or set of men
He was the  lepresentative of freemen, and, as |
such, would express, in hu own language, and in
his own way, the  opinions  of those who  had
elected him, cautig not who approved or disap-
proved  of what lie said     Lie was  accountable
only to God and his constituents                              i
As  foi   the  proposed   dry dock  at Pensaeol , |
(Mr  P  said,) ü eie appeared to be some plausi
bility m it Irom the geogriphical situation of that
city     He ha i not seen an/ lecomi lendation of it
by the Department, but in the present state of the
finances, he couid  not vote for any inciease of |
expendituie that could possibly be avoided     He I
said that he felt much pleased with the dibclosuie '
made   by Ule gen lemán   from   Virginia,   [Mr
Wis&,] as to the manner 11 which most of those |
projects were gotten up     Tne gentleman hud let
the cat out of the bag, and the mends of the o II |
did not attempt to contiadict it     The plan was,
when a few designing men wished foi  a public
work for their own inteiest, they would come on
to Washington, and commence operations  by '
teazing and importuning, night and day, officers
of the engineer department and members of Con-
gress for the funnerance ot Weir views     They I
would intrigue at noonday and at ni°-ht, wneh ,
they ought to be  n the r beds, to gam then ends,
and it was gene-aiiy found that, by " hook or by
crook," they succeeded     Thu was the way the
public money got f lched from the people
Mi P said, that althougn he could easily ac
count for some members of Congress from the
northern and ruddle States \oting for bills of the
character of the present one, yet he confessed
himself totally at a loss how to account for the
gentleman fro-n South Carolina [Mr Pickens]
advocating so useless and extravagant an appro-
priation, whose constituents were opposed to the
whole system of legalized swindling that had
been practiced by Congress for several years past
He thought the gentleman might see that a con-
tinuance of that course must eventuate in an in-
crease of the tariff,or a national debt, which, like
all other encroachments on the constitutional rights
of the citizen, was odious in the sight of every
Democrat
Mr P said he would ask the attention of mem-
bers to the millions that had been expended in
and about New York withm the last few years
for the erection of forts, light-houses, navy-yards,
&c A custom-house is about being built in that
city which will cost $3,000,000 before it is fin-
ished, although the first estimated cost was not
l much over a fourth part of that sum This build-
ing, he was told, will look more fit for the palace
of an eastern Satrap than for store houses of a
plain Republican Government
As to the statement made of the probable cost
of the proposed dry dock, Mr P said it was all
fallacious, for, from his experience of estimates
made for the erection of public works by engi-
neers, there was no dependence to be placed on
them, and all safe calculators would add fourfold
to the estimated cost of the work as being much
nearer the truth than the estimate made by the
engineers He said he would repeat that he op-
posed the passage of the bill because there was
no necessity for the work, in his opinion, at any
time, but especially at a time when he was told
the Treasury was empty He hoped every con-
sistent Democrat would be found recording his
name against not only this bill, but all of a like
kind, during this session
Mr THOMPSON moved to amend the amend-
ment by adding an appropriation of §100,000 for
a navy yard at Pensacola
Mr ELMORC obtained the floor, but, on so-
| licitation, yielded it to
Mi IIOPFMAN, who observed that a remark
lie had accidentally let fall when last up had ex
cited the rebuke of some of the puritans of the
House, who looked with maidenly abhorrence on
everything like bargains and fog rolling in this
House He would remind his friends from Penn-
sylvania and Georgia [Mr BiDDLtandMr Daw-
son] that the companionship of which they com-
plained had been no secret collusion, but a union
in views proclaimed openly on that floor Nor did
[ he see how any principle was violated when a
man who was a friend to two measuies advised
the fi lends of the la'ter one proposed that they
! had better take one at a time, lest they should
lose both If he had been opposed to the second
measme, and, for the sake of carrying the first,
had promised to compromit his views of piopri
ety and vote for the second when it should come
i up, then there might be some room forthechaige
of bargaining and of sacuficing principle He
had piofessed himself friendly to a dry dock at
Philadelphia lie was fnendly to it, and he did
not see how he hid been guilty of any the least
violatioi of the dignity of legislation, or of the
punty of the Iloiih?, by pledging himself to vote
for it in a separate bill hereiftei. But he had of
fended the honorable gentleman, his friend from
Georgia, [Mr Dawson,] because that gentleman
had not been successful in obtaining his favorite
object for the benefit of the South A part of the
leisons, if it were so, might perhaps have been
stated with some truth by tne gentleman from
Vngtnia, [Mr Wise ] But was the fact really
sc' Had the South been tnus neglected m favoi
of the North' He remembered a certain chart
referred  o on-i former occasion bv the venerable I
gentlerran from Massachusetts, [Mr Adams] in
which he had undertaken to pursue the couise of
the public money, which was sa'd to flow, lik 
the Gu'f stiearn, always towaids the Northern
ard Jiastein Sutes, and, following it, he had
found that in Georgia he was fu-thei North than
when he had se' out fiom Missachuseits, ai d
when he go' to New Orleans, hehad found himself
at the North Pole Whence h id the millions .
flowed that vie.e spent n driving out the southern I
Indians > and the millions more that had gone to
consummate the Georgia lottery, and enable the
gentleman's constituents to draw some of the
highest prizes' His friend over the way [Mi
Biddle] was afiaid that, after the bargain was
made by which New York was to get her dry-
dock, when it came to giving Philadelphia hers,
the bargain would not be consummated, and the
rights of Pennsylvima would be forgotten in the
overweening jealousy of New York, and her fear
of the aggrandizement of Philadelphia Now, he
would say to that honorablegentleman, that New
York was proud of Pennsylvania for many things,
she was proud of her on account of her talented
delegation on this floor, she was proud of her for
her noble projects of internal improvement, she
had not been so proud of her on account of
last winter's oroceedwgs, but for New York, as
a State, to be jealous of Pennsylvania, orforNew
York city to be afraid of the aggrandizement of
Philadelphia, he could only say that .New York
felt herself too big to be jealous of anybody He
acknowledged that Philadelphia was one of the
brightest jewels in the fair crown of this Confed-
eracy, he admired the beauty and cleanliness of
her streets, her abundance of fresh and whole-
some water, and owned that New York could
boast of nothing equal to her Fan-mount But
New York never could be jealous of her Phila
delphia should have his aid, and he doubted not
the aid of every New Yorker, when her project
for a dry-dock came up as a distinct measure
here New York loved and respected her as a
younger sister, and, he would add, a weaker sis-
ter, for, in point of natural advantages of situa-
tion, she was so
Mr H concluded by saying that he had no
personal interest in the piesent bill whatever, and
his sole reason for opposing the amendment, was
that it might lead to the defeat of both objects de-
sired
Mr ELMORE said, that until withm a few
minutes past, he had not intended to say a word
on this question I seldom trouble this body with
any remarks—on mere party questions, 1 might
say never—believing its time would, generally, be
far better employed m the business of thecountiy
I rise now, in, because in want of information on
a measure of great importance, which I conceivs
that the pait of the country which 1 in part repre-
sent, is much interested in I have looked in vam
for the information which was necessary to direct
me in the discharge of my duty on this question
I find no report of the committee, nor of competent
engineers, showing either that the dry dock asked
for is necessary, or what is the scale orplan of its
construction, or what it will cost, or if it is neces-
sary, whether there is not a location for it which
will be more useful and pioper It was more with
a view to inquire of the chairman of the Committee
on Naval Affairs for information on these heads,
than with any \ lew of entering into the discussion
that I have taken the flooi
The fust question piesented.sir, to my mind by
this bill was, is another dry dock necessary to the
navy' And if it be necessaiy, then the next ques-
tions are, what would be us best location ' What
will it cost' Where are the surveys and estimates'
And when were they made' There are already
two dry docks, one at Charlestown,in Massachu-
setts, and one at Gosport, in Virginia They cost,
it is said, nearly $1,000,000 a piece Is another
iifceiwn/? Most especially is it our duty to make
that lnquny now), and before ue go into tins work,
because our Treasury is well nigh beggared, and no
works not absolutely necessary should be begun
There is no report of this committee accompanying
the bill showing the necessity for this dock, no sut-
ieys, no estimates of cost, no plan of the works
Are we to go blindfold into this business' The bill
asks for §100,000, but who does not know that
this isbutadiopm the bucket' Two million dol-
íais will more probably be expended befoie the
wck is completed and if the amendment for the
one ai Phi1'lelphia prevails, a like sum maybe
added for that
if there be another dry-dock necessary for the
security or efficiency of the navy and the honor
and welfare of the country, which is intimately
blended with it, I am ready and willing to go all
lengths for it, even to the taxing my constituents
