SIR: A reliable scout reports that a small party of rebels entered Dycusburg about noon to-day. Several shots were fired at him, but he escaped. He thinks their object is plunder and conscription.

Lieutenant Colonel T. B. FAIRLEIGH,

Louisville, Ky.:

General Meredith telegraphs that Lyon has captured Princeton and Eddyville, and commands the Cumberland at Kelly's crossing with eight pieces of artillery. What reliable information have you about Lyon?

Captain J. S. BUTLER,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

A party of thirty rebels has passed down the country between here and Sharpsburg, crossing six miles from this place. They are said to be well mounted. Would it not be well to bring one gun down from fort and post it in the northern end of town, and protect it with a company of infantry?

BARBER,

Captain.
