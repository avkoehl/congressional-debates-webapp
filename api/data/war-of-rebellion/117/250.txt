that point, you will ascertain what further instructions and explanations are necessary to completely carry out the views of the commissary-general, and so far as you have authorized you will give them. The only particular suggested by the commissary-general is the introduction of Farmer's boilers at that place, to which you will attend.

With much respect, I am, captain, your obedient servant,

H. M. HAZELLE,

Captain, Eighth Infantry.

WAR DEPARTMENT, Washington, July 21, 1862.

His Excellency DAVID TOD, Governor of Ohio.

SIR: Yours of the 14th instant was duly received and at once laid before the Secretary of War. He said in reply that arrangements were about to be made for a general exchange of prisoners, which if done would obviate the necessity of a new prison at Columbus.

Should the arrangement fail I will call his attention to the subject again.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

C. P. WOLCOTT,

Assistant Secretary of War.

WAR DEPARTMENT, Washington, July 21, 1862.

Honorable JAMES W. GRIMES, Senate.

SIR: The Secretary of War directs me to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 6th instant inclosing a communication from His Excellency Governor Kirkwood, covering one from J. B. Dorr, quartermaster of the Twelfth Regiment Iowa Volunteers, with regard to 1,450 soldiers of Iowa regiments, paroled prisoners of war, and 250 officers now confined at Selma, Ala., and in reply to say that the Department is making every effort for a general exchange of all prisoners of war and has now strong hopes of its early accomplishment.

Inclosed please find a copy of General Orders, Numbers 72,* regarding paroled prisoners, &amp;c.

I have the honor to be, your obedient servant,

C. P. WOLCOTT,

Assistant Secretary of War.

CLINTON, IOWA, July 21, 1862.

SECRETARY OF WAR:

Will not Iowa soldiers of the Eighth, Twelfth, Fourteenth and Sixteenth Iowa sent home on parole be furloughed until exchanged? Was this not by officers commanding below Saint Louis? Who has a right to detail them for further service? Was not the detail for relief of the Twenty-third Missouri a violation of their parole?

N. B. BAKER,

Adjutant-General of Iowa.

CLINTON, IOWA, July 21, 1862.

SECRETARY OF WAR:

I object to Iowa soldiers who are on parole doing anything which by implication or indirection may make them violate that parole. Most
