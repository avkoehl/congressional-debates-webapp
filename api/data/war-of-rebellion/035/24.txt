MURFREESBOROUGH, January 30, 1863.

General GORDON GRANGER, Louisville:

Cannot you get barges for the cavalry and tow them up? It will not do at all to send them by land. Will take ten days to make the trip, and then the animals will be jaded and worn down so that they will be unfit for duty for ten days more, making a loss of twenty days. If the cavalry and pack animals cannot come up by water, to accompany the infantry and artillery, the whole force will have to come through to Nashville, and abandon the enterprise. Do not put arbitrary words in the dispatches. We have lost the cipher and only know the route. Please send a copy of the cipher. Direct to

C. R. THOMPSON,

Captain and Aide-de-Camp.

MURFREESBOROUGH, January 30, 1863.

Brigadier General R. W. JOHNSON:

Two dispatches received. The general commanding directs that General Davis hold his command in readiness to-morrow morning to make the movement contemplated some days ago. He has concluded it is not best to send General Davis to-night.

G. P. THRUSTON,

Captain and Aide-de-Camp.

MURFREESBOROUGH, January 30, 1863.

Colonel S. D. BRUCE, Clarksville:

I am directed by the general commanding to inform you that a large force of rebel cavalry is reported at Triune, on its way toward Franklin or Nolensville.

Respectfully,

G. P. THRUSTON,

Captain and Aide-de-Camp.

(Same to Colonels Harlan, La Vergne, and Innes, Nashville.)

MURFREESBOROUGH, January 30, 1863.

Brigadier-General STEEDMAN, Nashville:

Are your two regiments down from Gallatin yet? Is your brigade ready to move? The general contemplates giving you an order for an expedition. Colonel Wilder has been directed to combine his command with yours for the purpose.

C. GODDARD,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

MURFREESBOROUGH, January 30, 1863.

Colonel S. D. BRUCE, Clarksville:

The general commanding directs me to say that Forrest is at Chapel Hill and Wheeler is loafing in our front. The former may possibly pay you a visit.

Respectfully,

G. P. THRUSTON,

Captain and Aide-de-Camp.
