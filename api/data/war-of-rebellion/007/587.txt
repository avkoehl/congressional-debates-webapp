I was not ready to move, but deemed best to anticipate the arrival of Beauregard's forces.

H. W. HALLECK.

WASHINGTON, February 6, 1862.

General BUELL:

Halleck telegraphs that Fort Henry is largely re-enforced from Columbus and Bowling Creek. If road so bad in your front, had we not better thrown all available force on Forts Henry and Donelson? What think you of making that the main line of operations? Answer quick.

McCLELLAN.

WASHINGTON, February 6, 1862.

General HALLECK:

Buell telegraphs roads are impassable to Bowling Green. Has sent you a brigade.
