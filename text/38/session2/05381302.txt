THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
Mareli 2,
Mr. BROWN.. I have no objection to insert-
ing the word 14 clothing," but the phrase u tem-
porary relief" embraces it, sill to be furnished by
the War Department when necessary.
, Mr. DOOLITTLE. Let the Secretary read
the language of the amendment as it stands.
' The Secretary read, as follows:
j!hid be U further enacted,Thai the Secretary of War be,
and be-is hereby, authorized to furnish the so-called refu-
gee Indian? in the Indian Territory such temporary relief as
inay he absolutely necessary during the restdue ot' the fis-
cal year ending the 30thof June, l&oo, to be furnished out
of any lamb liiat may be at Ins disposal for the support of
refugees.
Mr, DOOLITTLE. I would suggest to the
Senator from Missouri that he insert the words
โข* provisions and clothing."
Mr. BROWN. I have no objection.
The VICE PRESIDENT, h is not in order
to make that amendment, the Senate havingjust
agreed to the amendment in its present form.
Mr. DOOLITTLE. It may be done by unani-
mous consent.
The VICE PRESIDENT. Those words may
be inserted by unanimous consent. The Chair
hears no objection.
Mr. POM EROY. I would inquire whether the
Secretary of War has any fund out of which he
can pay anything for this purpose. The amend-
ment says that the payment is to be made out of
any funds the Secretary of War may have at his
disposal for the support of lefugees. 1 think
there is no fund in his hands for that purpose, and
therefore the amendment means nothing.
Mr. BROWN. He does it etery day for white
refugees.
Mr. DOOLITTLE. I should like to inquire
of the chairman of the Committee on Military
Affairs whether there is any fund in the hands of
the Secretary of War to supply the wants of ref-
ugees, Indians or others.
Mr. WILSON. I do not know that any ap-
propriation is made for that purpose, but if he
wants to do a thing of that kind he will find the
money.
Mr. DOOLITTLE. The answer of the hon-
orable Senator is just what i anticipated, that the
War Department,by the manner in which money
is supplied to it, has the power to get hold of
money for any kind of purpose. There is noth-
ing specified particularly about it. There is so
much appropriated for the grand quartermaster's
department, four or live hundred million dollars,
and for the commissary department three or four
hundred millions, and so on. It is not stated that
he shall have a certain sum of money for a certain
purpose.
So far as this question is concerned, if it is the
determination of the Seuate to take these refugee
Indians entirely from the Indian department and
put ihem upon the War Department, if the Sec-
retary of War has the funds by which lie can take
:hem  ii will be a great relief to the Indian
'.v. .'-iftmeiu, 1 h ive no doubt, it will bo a great
?i ,u I" ?o me at the head of the Commits <. on In-
iii in Affair*, for I shall not have to struggle any
with the Senate for appropriations for the
o> ti* tit of these Indians, but they will come in
u:nJ< r those general heads that cover four or five
hundred millions in a single bill which is passed
wuhuut any discussion some morning in the
morning hour. But, Mr. President, I wish to
mak^ certain of the tact that there is a fund in the
haud;  of the Secretary of War for refugees. The
chairman of the Military Committee says that if
that Secretary is directed to provide for these In-
diana he has a fund out of which he can do it.
I wish to know whether that is the fact.
Mr. WILSON. 1 thinkl answered theSena-
tor's question fairly. He itsked me a question,
i answered it as I understood it, that no appro-
priations had been made for this object, but if we
directed the Secretary of War to support certain
persons { supposed that out of the commissary
and quartermaster's department appropriations
enough could be used for that purpose, {sup-
pose that to be the case.
Mr. DOOIJTTLE. I ask the Secretary to
read the last clause of the amendment.
The Secretary read the following words: "to
b';- iurnished out of any funds that may be at his
disposal for the support of refugees."
Mr. DOOLITTLE. I move to strike cut the
words " for the support of refugees.'*
The VICE PRESIDENT. That is not now
in order.
Mr. POMEROY. It will be in order when the
bill shall have been reported to the Senate.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senate have
just agreed to the amendment in this form} and it
is not in order now to strike out words which
the Senate have agreed to.
Mr. DOOLITTLE. I think there can be no
objection to the modification I have proposed.
Mr. HARLAN. I move a reconsideration of
the vote on the adoption of the amendment of the
Senator from Missomi in order that we may hear
the Senator from Wisconsin. I was not aware
that the word " Indian" did precede the word
"refugees;" I inquire of the Secretary if that is so.
Mr. WILSON. I think we had better say
"out of any money appropriated for the quar-
termaster'^ or commissary's department."
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator from
Iowa moves to reconsider the vote just taken
agreeing to this amendment.
Mr. HARLAN. The modification suggested
by the Senator from Massachusetts might be
made by common consent, I think, and save time.
I think no one will object to that amendment.
The VICE PRESIDENT. Whet ia the pro-
posed amendment?
Mr. HARLAN. To insert" out of any funds
appropriated tor the commissary or quartermas-
tei 'a department."
The VICE PRESIDENT. Iftherebe no ob-
jection these words will be inserted, and the
question is on agreeing to the amendment as
amended.
Mr. DOOLITTLE. I would like to add at the
end of the amendment a proviso that the officer
in command or having charge of the Indians shall
report to Congress the expenditures made under
this amendment specifically.
The VICE PRESIDENT. _ The Senator will
reduce the amendment to writing.
Mr. DOOLITTLE. I will put it in this form:
jProvided, That a detailed report shall be made to Con-
gress at itc* next session of all expenditures made for their
relief.
The amendment to the amendment was agreed
to; and the amendmentas amended was adopted.
Mr. HARLAN. I desire to offer the follow-
ing amendment as an additional section:
Jind be it further enacted, Thai any person who may
drive or remove, except as liereiuaftei provided, any cattle,
hoses, or other stock liom the Indian Territory for pur-
poses of trade or commerce, shall be guilty of felony, and
on conviction be punished by fine not exceeding ยง5.000,
or by impri -onment not exceeding three years, or by both
such fine and imprisonment. That the agent of each tribe
of Indians lawfully reading m the said Indian Territory be,
and he is Hereby/authorized to '-ell, for the benefit of said
Indian*, any cattle. hor-es, or oiher live stock belonging to
s/lid Indian*, and not required for their use and subsistence,
utidei such regulations as shall be established by the Sec-
retary ofthe Interior: PiocxdaK Ttiat nothing in this and
the preceding section shall interfere with the execution of
any order lawfully issued by the Secretaiy of War con-
nected with the movement or subsistence of the troops of
the United States.
The amendment was agreed to.
Mr. WILKINSON. 1 offer the following
amendment to come in after the amendments that
are printed at the end of the printed bill:
For payment of awards made by the Secretary of the
Interior, to be paid damages growing out of the loss and
destruction of improvement* made upon the land known
as the Winnebago j enervation, In Blue Earth county, Min-
nesota, by the bona fide actual settlers thcieon, under the
preemption laws of ilie United States, before the same was
selected and set apart as an Indian reservation,and which
award was made pursuant to an act of Congress entitled
"An act lor the relief of precmptors on the home reserva-
tion of the VVinnebagoes, in the Blue Earth region, m the
State of Minnesota," approved July 14,1862, and to be paid
to the several parties named in the said award, ยง7?302 06.
Mr. BROWN. Will the Senator explain the
amendment?
Mr. WILKINSON. I will. Prior to the estab-
lishment of this reservation m Minnesota the pre-
emption laws were applicable to this region of
country, and there were some settlers on the land.
The Government took possession of the land, and
the settlers weredrrven off; and in 1862alaw was
passed for their relief, authorizing an investiga-
tion in a certain land office in Minnesota, with
the direction that an inquiry should be had as to
the amount of damages, and also as to whether
their preemption right had been established, and
authorizing the Secretary of the Interior to make
an award of the damages. That award has been
made by him in pursuance of the act of.Congress
of July 14,1862.
The amendment was agreed to.
iVfr. NESMJTH. I am directed by the Com-
mittee on Military Affairs to move to amend the
bill by striking out " twenty-five" in line twelve
hundred and twelve on page 50, and inserting
" fifty;55 so as to make the clause read:
For defraying the expenses of the removal and subsist-
ence of Indians in Oregon and Washington Territory not
parties to any treaty, and for pay of necessary employes,
ยง50,000.
In relation to this proposed amendment, I will
state that m Oregon and in Washington Terri-
tory, in the portions of country that are settled,
the Indians have been gathered up and placed on
reservations. With some tribes in 1855 treaties
were made, but not with all. A large portion of
the Indians on these reservations are -obtaining
the assistance of the Government under the an-
nuities provided for by treaty stipulations, but
there are five or six thousand Indians who are
now in these reservations, where the Government
is endeavoring to have them taught the pursuits
of agriculture, that get no assistance from the
Government. They cannot be released from the
reservations and permitted to return to their own
country because it is occupied by the whites, and
their presence has been a fruitful source of the
war which has desolated that country. The In-
dians who have been gathered up and taken into
the reservations without any treaties, compose
some foiy, five, or six thousand, embraced within
Oregon and Washington Territory. But in or-
der to explain the matter more fully, I shall read
a paragraph from the last annual report of the
superintendent of Indian affairs for Oregon:
u In my last annual report I set forth the reasons why
a treatv should be made with these tribe.*, or the one made
by Oencial Palmer in 1855 should be ratified.
u These reasons >ull cxi^t with increased force. About
half the Indian-* m the superintendency, who are under the
control oi the Government, are located upon this reserva-
tion Their number is* about thiee thousand. Except the
nnall tribe of Shasta Scoton, none them are entitled to
annuities nor aie appropriations made for their benefit.
They were induced t<> remove to the leservation by hue
Superintendent JOel Palmer in 1855, and a treaty for thft
pmchase of their lands concluded. The Senate failed to
rati! y the treaty, and they have consequently never received
anything under it. But tfieir part ol the stipulations have
all been complied with. They gave up their lands, and
they have since been occupied" by whites. Common jus-
tice requires that some provision bemadefor ihem. They
have tin means of pioeunng clothing, are not in reach of
any lYiarket where agiicuJtural products c.in he sold, and
they are consequently discontented, and eager to leave the
reservation whenever they can elude the vigilance of ihe
agent. I still think, as I expressed it in my i sport for 1863,
that a new treaty can now be made with them more eco-
nomical to the Government, and more suited to their wants
and prevent condition. I recommended that course as best;
but whether that is adopted or it is preferred to ratify the
treat* of 1855, it is very important that wmeaction be taken
without longer delay."
I will slate that they have surrendered their
country and are now kept upon the reservations
without the means of subsistence. I have not
complied with the recommendation of the superin-
tendentof Indian affairs by inaugurating a system
of makinga treaty for thispurpose, for the reason
that I believe they can be more cheaply subsisted
on reservations by a small annual appropriation
and avoid the expense which will be incurred
and the delay which will ensue from making a
treaty. An appropriation of this sum of $50,000
was recommended by the Secretary of the Interior
and embraced in the estimates submitted to Con-
gress. It was stricken outof the bill in the House
of Representatives without any reason being of-
fered, and I now move simply to restore it. I
have here a lengthy argument from the Commis-
sioner of Indian Affairs and the Secretary of the
interior, both recommending that that sum be re-
instated. I ask that the amendment be made in-
serting " fifty" in place of" twenty-five."
The amendment was agreed to.
Mr. HARLAN. I am instructed by the Com-
mittee on Indian Affairs to offer the following
amendment to come in on page 53, after lirte twelve
hundred and seventy-six:
To supply deficiencies in the Indian service in Arizona
Territory, ,$12,900, for the present fiscal year.
The amendment was agreed to.
The bill was reported to the Senate, and the
amendments were concurred in. It was ordered
that the amendments be engrossed, and the bill
read a third time. The bill was read the third
time, and passed.
