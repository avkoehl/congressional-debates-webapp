the coming summer, but entirely new barracks should be erected for winter use.

The brook which runs through the camp has been well policed and is now and advantage to it instead of being as before a nuisance, as the receptacle of all the refuse and filth of the camp. At present, at least, it furnishes a sufficiency of water for washing purposes. Sinks. - Still in very bad condition - simply open excavations without screens and not filled up with sufficient frequency or properly disinfected. I would strongly recommend that portable sink receptacles be employed, as at Rock Island, to be daily emptied into a large sink to be dug at a reasonable distance beyond the camp limits.

Cooking. - Still done by squads, or each man for himself, over camp-fires. I understand that the erection of cook-houses for two of the divisions has been authorized and ordered. I am convicted that it would very much conduce both to the sanitary interests of the camp and to economy also if the rations were cooked in bulk. Under the present system there is necessarily great waste both of rations and of fuel, nor can the former be properly prepared.

Rations. - Quality good and quantity sufficient, though it would be advisable to increase the issue of vegetables, scurvy being still prevalent among the prisoners. The bread issued is of good quality.

Clothing. - Supply sufficient, but in many cases very filthy, owing to the absence of laundry facilities.

Blankets. - Supply sufficient, but condition as of clothing.

Laundry. - The erection has been authorized and ordered, but has not yet been put into execution.

Condition of men. - Would be generally good if cleaner.

HOSPITAL.

This department has been very greatly improved under the management of Surg. C. J. Kipp, U. S. Volunteers, who assumed charge about March 1.

Ground. - The ground is well policed, graded, and ditched.

Wards. - The central ward, which was never fitted for its purpose, has been abandoned and converted into offices, store-rooms, and mess-rooms, the sick being removed into hospital tents. Every part of this building is in admirable order and police. The south ward, once used as a guard-house, and under former administrations used as a hospital ward without the slightest fitness for the purpose, has been repaired and refitted, and is now used for the reception of semi-contagious diseases, as erysipelas. This, with the two main wards, are models of neatness, thoroughly whitewashed, and in admirable order and police. They are well ventilated by ridge and windows.

Tents. - Thirty-eight hospital tents are in use, arranged by twos on both sides of a street running nearly in the form of a right angle triangle with the hospital buildings at the apex. They contain six to seven beds each and are in very good order and police.

Sick, clothing, bedding. - The patients are well clad in U. S. Army hospital clothing and are clean and comfortable. The bedding is in ample quantity, obtained from the Medical Department, U. S. Army, and is clean and in good order.

Number of beds. - Three hundred and fifty, arranged as follows:
