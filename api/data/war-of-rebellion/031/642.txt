the cavalry in scouring the entire country around. It is my belief, so far as I was able to judge, that there was less disposition on the part of the men to shirk from duty, but on the contrary everything went to prove their willingness to do their utmost; the great mass seemed eager to confront the foe. The present system of provost guard, if carried into effect, will prevent all future straggling.

I have the honor, sir, to be, your most obedient servant,

Hardaway opened upon the gunboats about 3 o'clock on the 5th instant. Finding the fire too hot for them, they fled back to town, where they were sheltered from Carter's fire. Hardaway continued to pelt them, and to stop his fire [as is supposed] the ruffians commenced shelling the town, full of women and children.
