MONTGOMERY, May 1, 1861.

Governor JOHN LETCHER, Richmond, Va.:

I have received no reply to my dispatch of the 26th of April, relative to the military force of Virginia, its organization and disposition. Until this information is received, it is impossible for the President to determine in what manner he can best execute the convention between your Commonwealth and this Government, by which that force was made subject to his control.

L. P. WALKER.

EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT, May 1 1861.

General Lee will give instructions to call out volunteers to the extent that may be necessary for the defenses at Harper's Ferry.

JOHN LETCHER.

Arrangements have been made to call out, if necessary, 50,000 volunteers from Virginia, to be rendezvoused at Norfolk, Richmond, Fredericksburg, Alexandria, Harper's Ferry, Grafton, Kanawha, Parkersburg, and Moundsville. Convention has authorized a provisional army of 10,000. Our troops are poorly armed. Tolerable supply of powder; deficient in caps.
