HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS, August 21, 1864-9.30 a.m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

GENERAL: The enemy showed an infantry line of battle of Flowers', but our artillery compelled it to leave. I don't think I can be whipped if dispositions will save me, for my line extends well around, with considerable reserves. If the enemy comes between me and the plank road to attack I would like to have his rear harassed if you have any little spare force to do it with. I consider the efforts this morning as demonstration to get at a knowledge of my position. The firing has ceased for a few moment past.

Respectfully,G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, August 21, 1864-10 a.m.

Major-General WARREN:

Major-General Parke will move at once with Ferrero's division toward your position to carry out the orders of yesterday. Major-General Hancock's troops will move at once to carry out the same orders, having arrived in this vicinity about 8 o'clock this morning. Should the enemy endeavor to penetrate between you and the plank road and attack you Hancock's troops will be at once thrown upon him.
