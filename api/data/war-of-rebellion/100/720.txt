NEAR SMITHFIELD, N. C., March 30, 1865.

General J. C. PEMBERTON,

Hillsborough:

General Bragg, whose artillery seemed to me in excellent condition, promised me four batteries. I thought the ten to be organized at Hillsborough, sufficient in addition to these. If you think it best to have two more, please desire Colonel Gonzales to prepare them. The two you mentioned are on duty here with Hoke's division.
