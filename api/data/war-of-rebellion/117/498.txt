Newport Barracks and Wheeling preparatory to being sent to Camp Chase.

Much embarrassment has been occasioned by the neglect of officers who arrest prisoners to furnish full rolls with them showing their position, whether military or civil, the place and time of arrest and the cause of arrest. In some cases not even the names have been furnished and in others only an imperfect list of names.

I earnestly beg that you will give orders that in every case where prisoners are sent to any of the station in my charge you will require that full rolls be sent with them, giving all the necessary details of their arrest. Of military men it should be stated particularly whether they belong to the Confederate service or to State or irregular organizations.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. HOFFMAN,

Colonel Third Infantry, Commissary - General of Prisoners.

Major W. S. PIERSON,

Commanding Depot of Prisoners of War, Sandusky, Ohio.

MAJOR: Rev. L. Molon, of the Catholic Church, has asked permission to visit those belonging to his church among the prisoners at the depot, and if there are any prisoners who desire it you may permit him to visit and to preach to them on Sundays; and in case of sickness at special request he may visit them on other days.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Captain JAMES A. EKIN,

Assistant Quartermaster, U. S. Army, Indianapolis, Ind.

CAPTAIN: Your letter of the 2nd instant with one from Doctor Kitchen of the same date in relation to expenditures at the city hospital is received, and in reply I have to say that all proper and reasonable expenditures for the benefit of the sick prisoners in that hospital not covered by the hospital fund may be paid out of the prisoners fund at the camp. As no bills are presented I cannot decide as to the propriety of those which it is proposed to pay. The hospital was in very good police when I visited it and I don't see how it can cost $ 100 for house - cleaning. Whatever is right shall be paid. This fund is now in the hands of Captain Foster subject to your order, and any accounts to be paid out of it must forwarded to me. Those for expenditures at the hospital must have the doctor's certificate with your approval. Please see that all property, bedsteads, bedding, &amp;c., purchased with the prisoners' fund which remains for use in the hospital is property receipted for. Did Lieutenant Palmer leave any settlement of his accounts with you to be forwarded to me, and what became of the accounts which I examine with one of your clerks and which were to be left in your hands?

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. HOFFMAN,

Colonel Third Infantry, Commissary - General of Prisoners.
