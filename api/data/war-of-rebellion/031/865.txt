HEADQUARTERS,Baltimore, Md., December 18, 1862.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

I have received your dispatch of last evening. The preservation of the Union being a paramount object with myself, and in order to be in readiness to aid in suppressing the rebellion, caused me to suggest the arrangement which you were so kind as to approve, whenever the President shall relieve me of my present command. It is advisable, therefore, I would suggest, if it should meet your approbation, that your order me to Troy, N. Y., there to await orders. I should be pleased to have with me Colonel Thomas J. Cram, Lieutenant Colonel John B. Frothngham, and Major C. T. Christensen, all aides-de-camp of long standing, and whom I should like to have with me whenever a command should be assigned to me. If Capts. S. Carncross and De Witt Clinton, both aides-de-camp, can be spared, as the have been a long time with me, and constantly on duty, I should be pleased if they could have leaves of absences, to report to me for duty at the termination of their leaves, or otherwise, as you may deem proper.

JOHN E. WOOL,

Major-General.
