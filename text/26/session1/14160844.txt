abolition Petitions—Mr. Slade.
H. of Reps.
But we are told that the poor laborer will be distressed; and
the has been the burden ofa speech of an honorable Senator,
which has been scattered to every corner, for electioneering
purposes. Sir, this cry is the veriest demagogueisrn la the
poor laborer of this tree country like the serf of Russia, that we
ire te mete out his living? Are they so abject that they need
special legislative caie? No, sir, they take care of us, and will
look well to us, instead of our taking care of them They are
an intelligent, independent race of freemen, and scorn any thing
but equal privileges They that are poor to day, may soon be
rich. The wide world is «pea to them, and so long as we have
more than a million of square miles of land, not even surveyed,
labor, m the country at least, w ll I be high, and we need fear no
vile servitude, unless it be by the unwarned, insidious approach
of grasping monopoly But suppose it were otherwise—1 have
•aid labor only creates wealth Who does the labor! The poor
laborer. Who, then, is to pay our European debt, the offspring
of this banking system, which cannot be paid in promises? The
laborer. Why pays the six millions to carry on the oanks? The
laborer Who supports the speculator? The laborer Think
you the laborer gains by this extra burden? Whose wages are
the last to rise, and the first to fall? What benefit is it to a la-
borer to raise his wages from seventy five cents to a dollar a
day, and raise flour irom five dollars to ten dollars? Has the
laborer, with a family to support, got rich within a few years
past) What benefit to give him a brisk business, with extrava-
gant prices and increased expenses this year, next, throw him
entirely out of employment, or make him work for a bare sub-
sistence? In whose hands were most of the bills of one hundred
and sixty banks, which broke between 1811 and 1830? How
can a poor man, who wishes to "go West" to buy his "sec-
tion," safely "lay up" a paper dollar? Sir, in this country,
with all its advantages, atltady currency is best for all Specie
alona, from ita nature, is so. It is best for the manufacturers,
for out high prices induce the foreigner to flood us with his
merchandise. Better for the agriculturist, for he can export
nothing;, it casts too much here, and beside, though he may do
well this year, in the language of Mr Clay his grain perishes
unthreshed next. His average gams lor a series of years are
less. The farm produces no more, and if there is a charm in
mere nominal prices, without substantial gam, why not at once
callan ounce of silver five dollars? This would be more^ational
than by a paper infHuon 'Ihe sj stem, like a certain plant, ex-
pands with all the blandishments of hope, only to contract, and
crush to death ail within us folds
Sir, I wish to create no prejudice against those who have en-
caged in banking They are no doubt good citizens—certainly
those with whom I am acquainted—and have only consulted
their own interests, like all the rest of the world. It is the sys
tem which I doubt I throw out these hmts, and I cannot for-
bear aiding that our present condition is a practical illustration
of my íemarks Though mthe midst of banks, we are in the
midst of debt, foreign and domestic, and in the midst of distress,
■s we are told every hour Promises will no longer avail us—
no relief but a bankrupt late, or go to woik, live economically,
and work it out
But it is said injustice will be done to the honest debtor—he
who, perhaps, owes for a farm, purchased on credit at these high
prices Sir, injustice was done to the man who sold a farm upon
credit, before the rise. 1 he money he received would not have
bought a fifth part of his farm back The system is full of in-
justice But 1 feel, deeply feel, the force of the appeal But the
remedy, as I shall show m the conclusion of my remarks, be-
longs alone to the States Whether they will be inclined to ap-
ply the knife at once, oi gradually bring the system to us proper
level, is not for me to say In its present unnatural state, all
can see it cannot endure, even if all «ere so agreed If left to
me, I should hesitate before I added to the embarrassment al-
ready felt I do not believe this measure will do so in the
least But, from us own elements, a change or annihi
lation of this paper system must come. Mr Crawford,
in the ablest production of his life said in 1820, when
we wer* in a like condition "It is, then, 'believed that
the evils felt m those sections of the Union, where the distress is
most general, will not be extensively relieved by the establish
tnent of a national currency The sufferings which have been
produced by the efforts that have been made to resume and con-
tinue specie payments, have been great They are not termina
ted, and must continue until the value of property and the price
of labor shall assume that relation to the precious metals which
our wealth and industry, compared with those of other States,
shall enable us to retain Until thisshall be effected, an abortive
attempt, by the substitution of a paper currency to arrest the
evils we are suffering, will produce the most distressing conse-
quences. The sufferings which are passed will, in surh an
event, recur with additional violence, and the nation will asain
find l'self m the situation which it held at the moment when
specie payments were resumed " But, sir, we have no power
to interfere, and the dis>cussion ofthia whole subiect belones to
the States, and would have been gladly avoided by me, had it
not been drawn m as a principal topic by our opponents
But my colleague [Mr Marvin! says the precious metals are
insufficient in quantity, and lose by abrasion The first objec
«on I think uncustomed by fact Withdraw your paper, and
specie will increase. In France the currency is about ten
elevenths specie—in England half, while here it has been as low
as one-third, and of the actual circulation, no doubt more than
nineteen twentieths were paper As to attrition or abrasion, he
will, I think, find a satisfactory answer in the report of Sena'or
Sanford, in 1830 He there thinks coin should be recomed when
fourpercent is abraded, though then itBtill retains the impies
ston. In ordinary use, to wear away the eagle or dollar, four per
cent he found required two hundred years the half eagle and
half dollar one hundred Then the piece should be rtcomed
By this wesee the entire amount of the original eagle and dollar
would not be abraded short of five thousand years, and that of
the half eagle and half dr.'lar two thousand five hundred \ ears, a
very different material from that of the other currenry My col-
league says Mr Jacobs suggests that the dark ages might have
been owing to the decrease of the specie by abrasion Sir, if
scaicity of specie has this effect, I am not r ertain but the dark
ages will return If this system is g ontinued, soon none but the
antiquary will show us com Even our lexicographers are
changing the very definition of "money " as every gentleman
may see who has the cunopity to examine
But another colleague [Mr Barnard] thinks the use of hard
money induces to cringe Sir, I will state a few facts m reply
Mr McCulloch informs us that in 1820 there were seventy «even
capital convictions for forging Bank of England notes, and two
hundred and seventy-five convictions for having them in posses-
■ion.  Total, three hundred and fifty-two, and that seven hun-
dred and seventy-two of such convictions took place in three
years And for ten years previous to 1831, that Bank lost, in
forgeneson the funds alone, over one hundred and ninety (our
thousand dollars per annum
Mr Chairman, but three plans for keeping the national trea-
sure havebeen suggested One bythe State banks, is, Relieve,
repudiated 1 have heard no advocate for it here But not so
with a National Bank But a short time since an honorable
member from Vermont (Mr Everett] told us this was a ' by
gone" question In the debate on this bill, I unders'ood my
colleague [Mr Hunt] to say, "It was no* to be spoken of "
But, sir, we are now assured that they are sanguine of success
in the approaching political contest. The gentleman from
Massachusetts IMr Cishing] told us a few days since, that he
saw the "Aurora ofa brighter day,'' and that "Di Harrison"
is abont to be called in And the gentleman from Kentucky
[Mr Pope]comes forward with a matured plan for a National
Bank, which he openly advocates here, and says Mr Harrison
will no' veto it Sn, I do not know whether General Harrison
is a doctor or a nurse, but I am quite certain that, if called in,
"plasters" will be the prescription "Aurora" I think an apt
figure She was somewhat inclined to amours The gentle
man's party has formed some strange attachments She ap
peared neiied, too The gentleman will not mistake the ap
plication But those prophecies are periodical They come
as often as the Olympiads, or aie rather a leap year mspi
ration But experience has shown them false oracles It is
now day, and none but owlish viBions deny it The people
are not dissatisfied with this Administration, and if they were,
I think when they see the greedy swarm of office seekers,
who are the most anxious for a change, they will remember the
fable of the Fox and the Flies Still gentlemen have excited
thtirown delusive hopes, until th"y are bold enough to =peak
out Not only the gentleman from Kentuckv, but two other
gentlemen from that State, [Messsrs Underwood and An-
drews.] and one from Tennessee, [Mr Crockett,] have spoken
out without reserve, in favor ofa National Bank Recently the
Whig Governor of Connecticut, flushed Tvith victory, foreot
his caution, and I may add, I have not heard a Whig member
on this floor, during this debate, whose argument lias not lieen,
expressly or impliedly, mere or less in its favor, and not one in
the least condemnatory Sir, what would be the first act of
that party if in power? Every man can answer A tendency
to a National Bank is Whig polarity ,and distress the wind of their
hopes This bank question is like an insidious disease, haneing
about the Constitution, ready, at every derangement, to Eeize
and hurry it te death
The gentleman from North Carolina [Mi Rayner] told us
the people were like certain British troops of Waterleo begging
to engage in the contest Sir, the similitude is apposite "Cer
tain crowned heads decreed that a gallant people should be go
verned by the last fragment ofa «orthlets and stagnant blooded
race, w hich that f eople had unanimously rejected At Water
loo thatdecree was executed So here, a free people have bo
lemly decided that they will not be controlled by a National
Bank Opposition gentlemen may carry out the parallel Sir,
I believe such an institution unnatural, unnecessary, and unau-
thorized—a fungus upon the Constitution And when 1 think
of its immense power, over the debtois, it would have in every
city and hamlet, of its loans to legislators and editors, and its
other "bjsiness transactions," of its enormous electioneering
pow*n>, already proved, and of the attachment of a certain
class to this institution—I have no hope but in "eternal vigt
lance "
We are often t«ld here, by our opponents of the overwhelm
ing power of Andrew Jackson Suppose he had been a bad
man, with an obsequious National Bank of seventy millions at
his heels' Sir, strong as he was in the affecfons of the people,
he would piobably have been conquered in thai memorable
struggle, had it not become bank against bank Whether that
conflict was abput intentionally or accidentally, it was alike
providential The gentleman from Kentucky [Mr PopbI tells
usa National Bank will be "a bond of union " Fir, it would
be a chain of bondage, which nothing but a revolution would
ever break But, thanks to the "old hem," the tocin has been
heird, the people aroused, and they will never allow themselves
again to be either eoaxed or tortured into similar danger They
aredetermined to practise Jeffersoman principles They feel
and know that a strange power, unnamed in, and unknown lo,
their ¿acred compact, cannot bo safe to their liberties, or com-
patible with their self government
Sir, as to the details of the bill before us, notwithstanding all
the objections urged against it, it meets my approbation I be-
lieve it will lessen the patronage of the Admimstiation No
patronage is so dangerous as the control of banking interests.
But my colleague [Mr Marvin J says the expense of the collec
tion of our revenue has ard will increase Sk, I believe the
lour last years of the table he held in his hand show the very
lowest'rate percent on imports" The very next column in
that table shows this Besides, the weights and measures for
the States, and some cutters in the Florida service, I am teld,
are included Mr Woodbury, who is never caught nepping,
has also recommended a reduction of officers in that depart-
ment
Nor, sir, do I believe this measure will destroy credit, or
destroy the banks, but will, on the contrary, act as a well ad-
justed balance wheel to the system And, unlike Oppo«ition
gentlemen, I see nothing like a Government bark in it, and am
surprised thit the advocates or a National Bank should be so
alarmed, if there were But, say gentlemen, the money will
no be so safe as in a bank But they for a that a bank has
great liabilities, besides the claim for public deposites They
forget all expenerce too Sir, w ho his forgotten the recent em
bezzlements by acashier of an Albir y banU The same of a
Philadelphia banki And more recently still, of a Virginia
bank, and many other cases, m some of whuh, half of alarge
capital was cone before the slightest su'picior? By the ch ir
ter, the bond ofihe cashier of the United States Bank might
be only fifty tho^and dollars Mr McCulloch informs us that,
in 1803, the Tank of England lost, by the fnul of one of lis
cashiers, (Asilett,) more than one and a half millions of dollars,
and that bank losta stnllaieer sum by the forgeries of iaun'le
roy, the banker Banks are in human keepm", and exposed to
the frailties of our catur> This hill ctmains the «evere^t
checks But, say, they, Ihis will benefit those who live upon
salaries. Reduce them if too high But it will give Govern
ment a better currency than the people have The Const] uiion
knows but one currency, and the people should be content
with none other And who 1s the Government, but the mere
servants of the people? Sir, there is no such thine as the Go
vernment's money.   The people own it all.   And, too, is an
answer to the foolish cry of the "purse and swoid "   Not a
dollar can the President touch, without leave of the owneis.
Mr Chairman, I regret that, in the discussion of a question
so important, the debate should hive contained any thing but
argument and reason I regretted wheat one of my colleagues
charge this and the last Administration as "faithless and trea-
cherous," and to hear some harsh languagefrom another Asa
New Yorker, I wi«h some one else had said those things Sir,
it was easy for the President to have yielded to the clamor ex-
cited by the banks, to have "eased away," and gone with the
current It would have bpeneasy for the late Presidentto have
done so in relation to a National Bank What, then, but a
sense of dutj, and the hope of approval by the people andfuture
generations, could have induced them to brave such bitter, hos-
tility Sir, approving consciences, ard a candid world will
amply repay them These tests will send their names down to
a grateful posterity, and are most fortui ate for them, and such
is my admiration of this bill, that I deem my ability to vote for
it, most important for me But the gentleman from Pennsylva.
nia| Mr Biddle] has been more particular In his remarks
vesterday, he spoke with great severity of our present Chief
Magistrate. He denies him talent, and adduces as evidence of
that, that he did not areue some law case after it reached the
court here I deny the conclusion So great is the amount
and importance of the business of some professional gentlemen
of that State, that no other business would justify their absence.
But what do my Whig col'eagues say to this? The man who
successfully competed with our Emmet, Van Vechten, Henry
Williams, and all the others of that galaxy of professional
talent, as bright as ever adorned a bar, has, altei all, but inferior
talents1 Sir, Ins bitterest political opponents ever accorded to
him the first rank in ability, and every trial, in stations the
mon trying to the powers of man, has approved their judgment
But he brings another charge—that he did not bear arms during
the last war Sir, his services at that critical period were most
important to the country The journals of my own State show
what they were He was the right arm of the patriotic Tomp.
kins, and by his ability the support of that great State was ef-
fectually given to the war The ' classification" bill and many
other matters, are lasting monuments of his zeal and patriotism
in those trying times No ?>ew Yorker ever presumes to doubt
this But he supported Clinton and not Madison Sir, I have
m my hand the address of the New York Committee, acting for
the State Committee, at that period, to which 1 find high Demo-
cratic names, and in which they say, they were not enemies to
Mr Madison, but preferred Mr Clinton, because they believed
he would prosecute ihe war with more vigor He was of their
own State and they supported him, not that they loved Madison
less but Clinton more But once more I understood the hono-
rable eentleman to say that Clinton, in his dying moments,
execra'ed Mr Van Buren for treachery Does any man in New
York believe this? Do not circumstances preclude it Weie not
these illustrious men friends at thattime and have not the grateful
sons of the one, since felt the effects of that friendship. Bir, the
gentlemaB says Patrick Henry, had he known certain things,
would have desired to have been buried with his face down-
ward Clinton, too, I believe, would rather have been so bu-
ried than to have his grave made a «peaking trumpet to slander
his fi lend Sir, to the gentleman from Pennsylvania I accord
superior talents, and none, unwarped by prej udice, can deny
the same, in a most eminent degree, to the object o'his attack.
So far, then, they are kindred and lofty spirits, and I regret
that, in the honorable gentleman's valedictory, he should have
shot aParthian arrow, tipped with the poison of personal vitu-
peration
Mr Chairman, a word upon the "divorce," so called, and I
have done Gentlemen implore Government to give the people
a grod currencv Sir, in a Republican Government the con-
feoera'ed power should be s mple, well authorized* and well
defined In the exercise of us functions there should be no as-
sumption of doubtful authority A rule of clear right only can
preserve harmony in the whole If restrained hy strict con-
struction, none can complain What right, then, has Congress
to give a currency to the States? By what clause in the Consti-
tution? Does not that fix the currency, as far as we can inter-
fere? How humiliating to these States would be such a step> if
submitted to' It would be a great stride to consolidated rower.
No There is the instrument By it all must act Nor, sir,
would it be wise to do so, if we had the power Dangerous to
the purity of our elections wo'ild it be to mingle with them
questions on the currency These latter appeal to the cupidity
of man, and excite his worst passions It would be a bribery
upon the elective franchise The very principle degrades the
free elector If the price current is to elect our President, let nt
nominate a Jew, and fill that high office with some deep
scheming bioker at once.
Sir, this bill proposes to disconnect Government from all
these dangers, to place us above their reach, and leave nought
upon all but their plainest constitutional duty For this alone
it i* worthy the support of every freeman, who feels how dan-
gerous it is to add the ebbs and flows of monetary influence of
the deep surgesof the political tempest.              /

himself, in the remarks he had thought to make uiun the

with which gentlemen from the Booth had assailed those ef the
