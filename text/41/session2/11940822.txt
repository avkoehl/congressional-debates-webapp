MEMBERS-ELECT JFUOM "VIRGINIA.
Mr. PAINE. I rise to a question of priv-
ilege. I submit a report of tho Committee of
Elections on the cases of the claimants from
Virginia to seats in this House. The House
referred the credentials of those gentleman to
that committee.
There were eight certificates of electiOQ? show-
iiig that eight Representatives had been elected
in single districts of that State. There is a
ninth certificate in favor of a Representative
alleged to have been chosen by the State-at-
large.
In obedience to the order of the committee,
I move that the following-named gentlemen,
claiming to represent single districts, be now
sworn in, namely: Richard S. Ayer, from tho
first congressional district in that State; James
H. Piatt, jr., from the second congressional dis-
trict; Charles H. Porter, from the third con-
gressional district; Robert Ridgway, from the
fifth congressional district; William Milnes,
jr., from the sixth congressional district; and
James K. Gibson, from the eighth congres-
sional district.
I am further instructed to report that we
have examined the credentials of George W.
Booker, claiming to represent the fourth con-
gressional district, and Lewis MeKenzie, claim-
ing to represent the seventh congressional dis-
trict of Virginia.
The SPEAKER. The Chair would suggest
that the gentlemen to whom there is no objec-
tion had better be sworn in first. Will the
chairman of the Committee of Elections send
to the Chair the certificates of the gentlemen
whose rights to seats are unquestioned ?
Mr. WOOD. I beg to inquire of the Chair
whether, if the motion of the chairman of the
Committee of Elections be adopted, it will
exclude the right to object to the swearing in
of any of the gentlemen reported ?
The SPEAKER. If an objection is roado
to any one gentleman he will not be sworn
until his right to a seat is determined. But the
objection to one will not exclude the right to
be sworn of those to whom no objection is
made.
Mr. WOOD. I will object to Mr. Porter
being sworn at this time.
Tho SPEAKER. It is the right of the gen-
tleman from New York to make that objection.
Mr. PAINE. I understood the practice to
be that when credentials were presented, and
before they had been referred to the Commit-
tee of Elections, an objection on the part of
one member might prevent a member being
sworn in, but not after the credentials, as in
this case, had been referred, examined, and
reported upon.
The SPEAKER. After the committee have
reported on a case the question whether the
gentleman shall take the seat is one to be
determined by the majority of the House; but
of course the report of the committee will have
its due weight. The Clerk will report the
names of the gentlemen whom the committee
recommend to be sworn in.
The Clerk reported the following names :
Richard S. Ayer, James H. Piatt, jr., Robert
Ridgway, William Milnes, jr., James K. Gib-
son, Charles H. Porter.
Mr. WOOD. I object to Mr. Porter.
Messrs. Plait, Ridoway, and Milkes ap-
peared and qualified by taking the oath pre-
scribed in the act of July 2, 1862.
Mr. .PAINE. Before making a motion in
