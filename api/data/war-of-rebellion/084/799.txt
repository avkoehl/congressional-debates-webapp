HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF WEST MISSISSIPPI, OFFICE OF THE CHIEF SIGNAL OFFICER,New Orleans, La., August 22, 1864.

Major General E. R. S. CANBY,

Commanding Mil. Div. of West Mississippi, New Orleans, La.:

GENERAL: I have the honor to submit to your consideration a statement of the information received at this office this 22nd day of August, 1864, from the following sources: A report from Captain Andrew G. Fitz, Port Hudson, La., August 18, 1864; a report from Captain Thomas B. Reed, Rolla, Mo., August 10, 1864. Deserters report the enemy from 3,000 to 5,000 strong at and near Clinton, La. The force stationed at Clinton is only 350; the rest are divided into squads, scouting through the country, conscripting and obtaining supplies. Much of the scouting is in the direction of Baton Rouge. July 30, Freeman, at Hookram, Ark., issued rations for 2,200 poorly-mounted, half-armed men. Shelby had left Jacksonport with 5,000 men going in the direction of Little Rock. Intercepted letters show that Shelby had largely re-enforced his command by conscripts. One letter states that General Price has everything satisfactorily arranged for the invasion of Missouri before winter. Nearly all reports from Missouri and Arkansas indicate that such a movement is likely.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

FRANK W. MARSTON,

Major and Chief Signal Officer.
