General S. WILLIAMS:

General Gibbon's division will be entirely over shortly, and General Barlow's is at hand. The boats on this side are for the moment exhausted on account of the lesser facilities on the other for landing. General Birney is working at the upper wharf on that side now.

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS, Wilcox's Landing, June 14, 1864-6.10 p.m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,Chief of Staff, Army of the Potomac:

GENERAL: I have the honor to state that with the aid of four or five pontoon-boats on the south side of the river we can make two landings instead of one, as is now the case. There are steam-boats enough here to use both landings. There are two wharves on this side.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS, Wilcox's Landing, June 14, 1864-6.30 p.m.

General WILLIAMS,Assistant Adjutant-General, Army of the Potomac:

GENERAL: Two brigades and two regiments of the Second Division have now gone over. I shall send four guns without caissons on the next boat.

Your obedient servant,

Major-General of Volunteers, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, June 14, 1864-6.50 p.m. [Received 7 p.m.]

Major-General HANCOCK,Commanding Second Corps:

Your dispatch is received. The commanding general has directed that six pontoons be sent you. Send the order down by one of the steam-boats to General Benham, so that the pontoons can come to you at once. If you have no control of the steam-boats, this order will be sufficient authority. I send the order for General Benham to your headquarters, since the telegraph line is not finished to the bridge-head yet.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
