Colonel La Grange, advancing upon the Stafford road,encountered the enemy in very heavy force, far exceeding his own, but the persistent courage and determination of his officers and men enabled him to force them steadily back till an open field was reached on the right of the Stafford road, near its intersection with the Fair Garden road, which was enfiladed by the enemy's battery. The dismounted men, however, advanced across the field, pressing the enemy's right and obtaining a flank fire upon the heavy force which was engaging Colonel Campbell upon our right. The enemy was thrown into confusion and rout,a nd Colonel La Grange,w it detachments of Second and Fourth Indiana Cavalry, by a magnificent and gallant saber charge upon the Fair Garden road, captured two pieces of artillery, sobered the cannoneers and supports,a nd captured a large number of prisoners. At the same time Lieutenant-Colonel [Major] Lesslie, Fourth Indiana Cavalry, with a part of his regiment, charged with sabers the enemy's line upon the left of the road, driving them after a desperate hand-to-hand fight, and capturing about 50 of them together with General Morgan's battle-flag and part of his escort.

In this charge Lieutenant-Colonel [Major] Lesslie, Fourth Indiana Cavalry, fell morally wounded while gallantly leading his men. He was an able, brave, and dashing officer, and his regiment, the cause, and the country can illy afford his loss.

The number of our forces that had reached the battery from the rapid gallop that had been made was necessarily small, and some of the enemy, emboldened by this fact, attempted to form and retake their guns; but four companies of the Fourth Indiana Cavalry arriving upon the spot, charging this line of the enemy, gave them barely time to remove some of their wounded, and the last attempt of any part of Morgan's division to preserve their organization upon the field was abandoned.

It was now nearly dark, Morgan's division was thoroughly and disgracefully routed and broken, our men were worn out by an advance over a hotly contested and difficult ground, our supply of ammunition was in a great measure exhausted, and I therefore, after occupying the position taken, sent out detachments of the First East Tennessee and First Wisconsin Cavalry-these detachments comprising the only men that had not been actively engaged in pursuit. They overtook the enemy at Flat Creek and captured quite a number of prisoners. They attacked the rear and flanks of Armstrong's division, and soon forced them into nearly the same rapid and confused retreat that had before overtaken Morgan's division.

We captured 2 3-inch rifled guns, with their horses; about 800 small-arms, which we destroyed; 112 prisoners (9 of them commissioned officers, 2 of the latter being regimental commanders), General Morgan's battle-flag and his body servant, General Morgan himself narrowly escaping, being in the immediate vicinity of the battery when it was taken. We also recaptured the regimental colors of the Thirty-first Indiana Volunteer Infantry,a and one other regimental color (a silk American flag), which was in the possession of the rebels, and a battery guidon. Many of their killed and wounded fell into our hands, and I estimate their loss in killed and wounded, exclusive of he prisoners taken,a t upwards of 200.

Our casualties (detailed lists* of which are herewith inclosed) were 4 killed, 24 wounded, and 3 missing. I can only account for
