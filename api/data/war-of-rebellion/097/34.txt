The major-general commanding the corps does not doubt that soldiers who have given their strength and blood to the fame of their former badges will unite in rendering the present one even more renowned that those under which they have heretofore marched to battle.

The First Division will wear the red hearts; the Independent Division, the white hearths; and the Third Division, the blue hearts.
