Brigadier General EDWARD HATCH,Eastport, Miss.:

You may parole such regiments as desire to surrender to you at Iuka and Corinth, but be careful to do so in accordance with the requirements of the instructions sent you some time since. Summon Chandler to surrender, and, if he refuses, declare him an outlaw and treat him accordingly, and inform the people that hereafter all illegal bands will be regarded and treated as outlaws. Will direct Van Duzer to place a battery on the line of sufficient strength to answer all purposes.
