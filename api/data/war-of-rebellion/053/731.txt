S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF WESTERN VIRGINIA, Dublin, October 5, 1863.

Brigadier General JOHN S. WILLIAMS,Commanding, &amp;c.:

GENERAL: The major-general commanding directs me to say that Major-General Ransom's order regarding your not advancing beyond Bull's Gap was given only because in the condition of your command it was not thought prudent to push farther into East Tennessee, the enemy occupying Cumberland Gap and Knoxville.

The general has since ascertained that the enemy's force at Cumberland Gap is so small that it is not likely to disturb you, and if you can possibly press the enemy back beyond Bull's Gap do so by all means.

The reports of the arrival of re-enforcements to the enemy from Kentucky, probably originated with disloyal citizens and are circulated to deter you from attacking.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. B. MYERS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

MERIDIAN, October 6, 1863.
