Brigadier-General SANBORN,

Springfield, Mo.:

You stand a fair chance to get a visit from Price &amp; Co. Concentrate your forces carefully and secure your property.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.

SPRINGFIELD, MO., September 13, 1864.

Major-General ROSECRANS,

Commanding Department of the Missouri:

Would you recommend the withdrawal of the troops from the posts on the western border or the post of Cassville at once? Has Price crossed the Arkansas River?

Respectfully,

JOHN B. SANBORN,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS,Saint Louis, September 13, 1864.

Brigadier-General SANBORN:

Price and Fagan, with about 5,000 mounted men and four pieces of artillery, are said to have crossed the Arkansas at Dardanelle last Thursday. My impression is that he will advance, if at all, by Rolla and pass north and east of you through Missouri into Kansas. If you have scouts out time the concentration of your outposts so that you may lose nothing and yet not disturb the enemy too soon. To that end make your arrangements beforehand carefully. Look to the trains.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.

CASSVILLE, September 13, 1864.

General SANBORN:

Buck Brown is reported in the vicinity of Bentonville with 200 men; threatened to take the first train to Fayetteville. I have corralled the train the other side of Keetsville. Have ordered all the mounted men from White River, and will re-enforce the escort as soon as possible. More mounted men are needed here.

Respectfully, &c.,

HUGH CAMERON,

Lieutenant-Colonel Second Arkansas, Commanding Post.
