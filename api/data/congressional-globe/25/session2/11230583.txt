The honoiabte gentleman ¡says that he ha8 never t-een any evi
denee to ju-*ufy the charge that the Administration has, ut any
time, manifested a disposition to injure, muca lees destroy,
either the banks or the credit system which has ^9 long> existed
in the country Ha*t he forgotten, that, from th* period the de-
structive sentiment was announced, of * perfsft CiViiit, pensh;
commerce,J in this Capitol, down to thishour, the ie"aderaof the
IMrty in Congress, and 111 ihe country, as well a^the pv&lic
press, official and unofficial, have been mcessarii m denofiticmg
the whole credit system aa anti republican m its tendencies,
" making the uch richer, and the poor poorei,' and equali> *lc
structive of morals and equal righto Has he forgotten, sir, that
: it was announced from a high quartei, "that all who deal on
i boi lowed capital ought to break," that 1 hose interested m banfe*,
■ ind men of property generally, were called ' lag barons" anfl
1 * monopolists ' and that the banks had but lecently, ftom tie
eime high quaitói, been chaiged with unheard of treachelyi If
tie gentleman ifeignoiant oi ail this, and much moie o/the
same chai acter that might be adduced to prove that the Go* ern-
mentmduced the people to believe that it was for ttieir interest
to pat down bank paper and destroy credit, and I am bound to

luion to those interests, hf js but in his novic ate in the pohti
cal church to which he has so recently united himself, and has

as yet, in the chi ysahs state, and when he shall 1 a\ & passed from
that, and acquired full vigor and proportions, 1 e will b&ableto

that there io borne evidence of what his bet n believed, h\ d,
arge portion of the people, to have been the intention oí the Go-

have alluded Before I can be satisfied 111 thi¡= point, «11., I must
have assuranees " from the fathers of thechuich, and not frtm
the junior apprentices of the law," as wasome said on thisiioor
on another occasion
fill Chairman, the honorable gentleman has been smgulatly
unfoitunatem re'ttion to ano bet trarsaction connected w th
this subject Hehossaid that, after the removal of ihe depo-
sites fn m the Bank of the Umted Sta es, the State banks had
wooed the Government into an alliance with them, and ho
calis H a meretricious aUiance, and, when they had consumma*.
ed then purpose, they violated then pjighted tioih, and played
the wanton Now, su, the reverse of this is the fact Í sup.
poseí it wis a mattei of public notoiiety known fo eveiy one,
tin*, at the period alluded to, <m individual, now high m office,
and then hi^h m the confidence of the Adn mistia'ion, was
cimmissioned to visit the vanous banks in certain pai s of the
ITniun, aud a^ceitam the term^on which they wou'd receive
disburse, and aafely keep the public money that might be depo-
sited with them by the Government And thus, mi, th„ ahi
anee, if'here was one was formed at the solicitation oí the
Government and the banks were advised, by the theuSe rc-
taiyot th** rreisury, to be liberal m their diS' untt>, andina
su^te^oudow 1 to a very recent period, has uniio«*mly declared
tha.1 they had pei formed theirduty to theGovecnme it and the
country with the utmost fidelity They may have plajed the
wanton, but, if so, it waa by the pioeurtinent and with ths
connivance oi the Government And now, ai ci procuimg
tins meretricious alham e, and having spent the honev moon in
sinful flalliance, they have been ' cast, like a loa hvoroe weed,
away "
Sir Chairman, the anxiety evinced in 1 certain quaitru foi
the passage of ihis bill cannot be miiunderfltood It is the

the people I allude 10 what has at one time been ca'ied the
