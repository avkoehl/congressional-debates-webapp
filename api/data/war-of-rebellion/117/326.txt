Captain J. A. POTTER,

Assistant Quartermaster, U. S. Army, Chicago, Ill.

CAPTAIN: On reflection I think it was scarcely proper for me to give you an order in relation to the removal of prisoners of war from Prairie du Chien to Madison. It was done under instructions from some other authority without my knowledge and it is not therefore right that I should give one to cover it. You received some orders in relation to the movement, and that, whatever it was, will complete your vouchers. Even your own certificate will be sufficient, as the necessity of the case if perfectly approved. I must request, then, you will not use my order.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. HOFFMAN,

Colonel Third Infantry, Commissary-General of Prisoners.

SAINT LOUIS, August 1, 1862.

Lieutenant A. ARNOLD, Provost-Marshal, Ironton, Mo.

LIEUTENANT: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of July 31 and to say in reply thereto: Prisoners taken in arms against the United States who are regularly in the service of the so-called Confederates are prisoners of war subject to exchange.
