In announcing these achievements, the commanding general takes special pleasure in adverting to the promptness of the officers in striking a successful blow whenever the opportunity offered, and the endurance and gallantry with which the men have always supported their commanders.

These deeds give assurance of vigilance, activity, and fortitude, and of the performance of still more brilliant actions in the coming campaign.
