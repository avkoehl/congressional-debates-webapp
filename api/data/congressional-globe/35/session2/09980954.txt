THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
February 10,
the statement is reliable—that if you would take
the native-born population of the United States,
you would find that the fifteen States of the South
would equal, in population and political strength,
the original fifteen free States of the North, leav-
ing out the two new free States of California and
Minnesota. ■ ., .
But, sir, I do not propose to consider this as
merely a question of expediency, I allude to it
simply as a reason which I think ought to weigh
upon the minds of members from my own section
Of the country. It is a question which, in my
estimation, involves, to a gieat degree, our polit-
ical inferiority or equality. .
It seems to me that this provision of the Oregon
constitution is unconstitutional, for another lea-
son. The Constitution of the Uniied State confers
upon Congress the power " to establish a uniform
rule of naturalization." Now, I ask, docs not the
constitution of Oregon, by the section which I
have read, naturalize aliens after they have been
within her limits for twelve months.' What is
naturalization? What is the right of citizenship? !
In this country, il is the right to govern. The ;
citizen, by the ballot-box, wields the primary
power of controlling tbe Government. That con-
stitution gives an alien the right tovote; gives him
access to the ballot-box; gives him equal power to
control the Government with one of your own na-
tive-born sons. "You thereby make him axitizcn
to all intents and purposes. What else is there
that he lacks to constitute him a citizen ? What
else is there to bestow upon him? You have in-
vested him with sovereign power, and that includes
everything else.
It is provided in the general law of Congress,
that the alien who is admitted to the riglus of citi-
zenship shall renounce all connection with or
fealty to any foreign prince, potentate, and Power,
and to swear loyalty to the Constitution of the
United States. By tiie constitution of Oregon
citizens are made without requiring them to re-
nounce any fealty to the Powers of which they
are the subjects, and without any oath of alle-
giance. I think that it is wrong, that it is unwise,
that it is unconstitutional, and that a due regaid
to the oath I took when I came to occupy a seat
upon this floor requires me to vote against the ad-
mission of this State, with this provision in her
constitution.
The amendment by which I propose to obviate
this difficulty, is simply this: that the people of
Oregon shall have their attention called to this
feature of their constitution; and they shall, at the
ballot-box, decide whether they are willing to
come into the Union as a State without that ob-
jectionable provision. As soon as it is determined ^
that she has a sufficient population; and as soon j.
as she striki-s that anti-republican clause from j,
her constitution, then admit her as a sovereign <;
State, equal and coordinate with the other States jj
of the Union. I will not further prolong thisdis- [j
cussion. !■

In an almanac for the year 18GS, pu&i^hcd nt Oregon by
a delegate to the constitutional convent,on. n, among oilier
interesting and valuable ttau-nc.-', a tabic khowins tin; c-ti
mated population of the Terntoiy, bv counties. Tina table
gives the total population of the whole Territory at forty-
three thousand two hundred and beven.
That it may more full} and clearly appear where and m
what way out puhhc lauds have gone and are si ill going, I
append tlie following veiy carol ally compiled tabic, lor
which I acknowledge obligations to my hiemi Mi. Davis,
of Indiana, and a&k ior it a canntd and attentive examina-
tion (See table in next column.)
The question of alien suffrage was considered bv the
House in the last Congress, and the following proceeding?,
in Committee of the Whole, during the discussion of the
enabling act bill for Oregon, on the 31st day of January,
1857, will show the immense majo-ny m favorof the views
* entertained by me and those with whom I act.— Cong.
Globe, third i-es&ion Thirty-Foui th Congress, p. 522:
" Mr. II. Marshall. I move to amend the third section
by inserting, after the ninth line, the words:
"(Provided. That only citizens of the United States
shall be entitled to voto at the elections provided lor by this
law.'
" I do not desire to discuss this proposition. The amend-
ment itself indicates sufficiently my object. But f will make
this single remark: that in making the constitution of a
State, T believe His unsound policy to allow any but citizens
of the United States to vote. Here [.make that point, and
take my stand.
" Mi. Haven asked for tellers. *
" Tellers were ordered; and Messrs.-Talbot and Pur-
year were appointed.
" The House divided; and the tellers reported—ayes 77,
noes 49.
" So the amendment was agreed to."]
Mr. CLARK, of Missouri, obtained the floor.
Mr. HOPKINS. If the gentleman will yield
the floor, I will move the House adjourn.
Mr. CLARK, of Missouri. I yield for that
purpose.
Mr. STANTON. Let us take a recess.
Mr. JONES, of Tennessee. No; let us adjourn.
I do not want any more recesses of the House.
Mr. STEPHENS, of Georgia. I am very anx-
ious to have the previous question seconded to-
day., or else a general agreement as to when the
vote will be taken. If not, it will have to go over
till Tuesday. I want it disposed of to-morrow
or next day.
Several Members suggested Saturday.
Mr STEPHENS, of Georgia. I proposed Sat-
