oí distinguished officers, to take part directly and
effectually in the late giviI wars of Spain. Large
bodies of troops were likewise without the slightest
concealment, enlisted in England and Ireland, at
open rendezvous, for service with the rebel colo-
nies of Spain, fighting for independence In
Egypt, the interference of Great Britain by fleets
and armies has been d rect and conclusive I have
read in a French newspaper, that of la e, men are
openly enlisted at Gibralter for service, with «orne"
. of tbe Barbary powers, resisting the effort of France
to. establish a colony by conquest, in «hat she
calls Algeria. In a word, tir, such has been the
character of what is termed neutrality, in the prac-
tical British construction of it, that it has become
the mere refuge of weak nations, while entirely
disregarded by the powerful When I consulted
a highly respectable friend before I left home re-
specting the legal views belonging to the condition to
which Mr Webster ha«* brought the United Sta es,
a gentleman of great learning and experience, his
first mortifying answer to me was, When weak and
strong nations come into colisión, the weak hive
no alternative, there is no law for then, but to
yield to the strong.
Be that as it may, never, I venture to a<sert,
was honester, sterner, more complete 01 unexcep-
tionable neutrality than that actually enforced by
every branch of the Government of tnese United
States, during these untoward Canadian troubles
Every gentlemen who hears me will recollect
the frequent, earnest, and anxious proclamations
of the late President, who, whatever may have
been said as to his indisposition to commit himself,
did not hesitate, on that occ?won, to throw the
whole power of his office, and all his peisonnl m
fiuence, to rr=k his pro\ ¡acial popularity, and his
re election to tbe Presidency, in the strongest ap
peals to the inhabitants bordering upon Canada,
to refrain fiom all interference <,m pam of the se-

Case of McLeod—Mr. Ingersoll.
Notwithstanding, however, every exertion that
could be and was made, it was impossible alto-
gether to prevent some outbreaks, and among the
rest a parcel of some seventy or eighty Canadians,
as I have understood, with a very few Americans,
took possession of a place near the Canadian shore,
called Navy Is and, and fortified themselves m de-
fiance of British power. If I have not been misin-
formed there were not more than eight or ten
Americans among them. An American steamboat
supplied them with a cannon and perhaps other
munitions of war for 1 have no di^pos «ion to di-
minish whatever was the full extent of American
illegality, but, m this statement of the premises,
desire to present the argument with the most un-
reserved concessions I am discussing nothing as
th® member of a party. I consider the Secretary
of Slate as the representative of his Government
and country. I desire to be understood as not in-
tending to say one w^rd against that gentleman as
an i dividual, as meaning to avoid every thing
like personality, and addressing myself to Ihe posi-
tion he has assumed for the coun'ry, without refer-
ence to wh-nh-T ha is connec ed with one admims
tration or another, viewing this as a controversy
between the Unittd States and a foreign Govern-
ment, m which all Americans should be of one
part), acknowledging no distinction between
the acts of Mr. Forsyth and Mr. Webster,
but considering the whole affair, under
boih the successive Administrations, as one
and indivisible, and on many points, I believe
this country is altogether of one and the sam°
sentiment concerning this controveisy It seems
to be utuv-ria'ly agreed that Briti hpnates as they
weie, as I w 11 show according to the strictest legal
definition oi the term, m the dead of night, burgla-
riously invaded our countiy, murdered at least one
of our unoffending fellow citizens, were guilty of
the furtuer crime of arson by burning what was
at least the temporary dwelli g of a number of
persons asleep in a '•tearabo.it moored U the whaif,

Now,  Mr   Speaker, this, in its national a peot,

per, etratt rs, named McLeoJ,  in a fit of lhat sort
of mfnuation with which Providence mostly be-
tiays the  guilty, strayed   over fr-am  Ganad i to
the Amenesn shore, like a fool, as he  was, and

wi h .he o her cantors, he returned su 1 armed, and
«tin wire of the booty, and i eard hi n then  m er
the fooli h and v icked  boast that h  had helped
to  kill the Yamree?.    Such is  the pn of ot  his
guilt     That of his   innocence proceeds,   i a-n
assured by the same authentic source, from the tes-
timony ot two women of bad character, a mother
and her daughter, who undertook to prove an Mi
H. of Reps.
Guilty orinnocent, however, there he was, under the
aigis of the law of the sovereign State of N York, with
the full protection of every branch of the Govern-
ment of that State, when the present Administra-
tion superseded the last, and the first moment after
the late President's inauguration was ungenerously
seized by the British Minister to present the new
Secretary of State with a letter containing the inso-
lent, threatening, and insufferable language which
I am about to read from it
'The undersigned is instructed to demand from the Govern
ment of the United States formally', in the name of the British
Government, the immediate release of Mr Alexander
McLeod " "The transacuon in question may have been, as
hei Majesty s Government, are of opinion that it was, a justifta-
Weemployment of force for the purpose of defending tbe Bn
tistitemtory ñora Iheunpiovoked attack ef a baud of British
rebels ard American pirates, who, having been peí milled to
aim and orgarize themselves within the teirltory of the United
States h%i actually invadfd and occupied a portion of the ter
ntory of her Majesty, oi it may have been, as alleged by Mr
Torsyth m his note to ttie undersigned of the ¿6th ofDecember,
'a most unjustifiable invasionm time of peace of the territory of
the tinned States'"
Finally, after a tissue of well elaborated diplo-
matic contumely the very absurdity of part of
which, m the application of the term pirates to the
interfering Americans, is demonstrated by Mr.
Webster—the British Mmisler reiterates, towards
the conclusion of his artfully insulting note—lhat
' be that as it may, her Majesty's Government/or-
milly demands, upon the grounds already stated,
the immediate release of Mr. McLeod, and her
Majesty's Government entreats the President of the
United Sta'es—I pray the House to mark ihe sar-
casm of this offensive entreaty—to tak« into his
dthheiate consideration the serious nature of the
consequences which must ensue from a rejection of
this demand."
Here let us pause a moment to contemplate the
state of the nation. The new President had ]Uit
been inaugurated, of which ths British Minister
seemed to take advantage for the purpose of put-
ting its his crafty appeal It was impossible for
General Harrison, at that time, to give much at-
tention to foreign affairs Just 11 the honey-moon
of his union null ihe American people,he had
neither time nor inc'ination for them He says
himself, in his inaugural address, that he was un-
avotdab'y uninformed of their situation. The
language of that sincere and unreserved commu-
nication to his fellow citizens, the whole para-
granh o this particular topic, deserves to be
quo ed,
Mr I here read from the President's Inaugural

ih°dut> of dean ruination and of action neces-
sarily devolved m a great measure, if not altogether,
upon the new Secretary of State, and eveiy proper
allowance stiouid b- nade for the difficulty of his
responsible po ition. The issues of peace or war
were m m* haids As his much considered letter
trulv tays, ' the object of this country is peace—its
policy is peace " Undoubted'y so Any officer of
the Government of these United States would be

with the conviction that tue RepuDlican grandeur,
as well as the unexampkd prosperity of this new
einji^e, aie to be prrduced by the development of
its immense natural resources, with all the arts of

Government is, that no Executive can involve his
