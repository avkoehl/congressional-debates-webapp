HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, June 4, 1864-7.30 a. m.

Major-General WARREN, Fifth Corps:

The major-general commanding, learning that the enemy have withdrawn from Burnside's front, directs that you contract your lines to the left as far as practicable, and relieve General Birney, and order him to report to General Hancock. General Burnside is ordered to move to the left and take up the ground you vacate so far as it may be necessary, concentrating his force at the same time.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,Major-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, June 4, 1864-7.45 a. m.

Major-General WARREN:

Telegram reporting withdrawal of enemy from your right received. This is either to mass for an attack somewhere on us, or they are withdrawing beyond the Chickahominy. In either case Burnside ought to close up on you and you close to the left, as Birney should return to his corps and await further intelligence from you and Burnside; but we had better get ready for receiving attack as soon as possible. The other contingency can be met at leisure.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS, June 4, 1864-8.40 a. m.

Major-General MEADE:

Dispatch of 7.45 received. I am making arrangements for closing to the left as soon as Burnside is ready to occupy the vacancy I make. The enemy is still southwest of Bethesda Church, same as before, and from there on to our left.

G. K. WARREN,Major-General.
