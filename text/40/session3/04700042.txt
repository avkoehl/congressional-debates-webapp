APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
[November 30,
Senate & Ho. of Eeps.
Report of the Secretary of the Interior.
40ra Cong....3d Sess.
Since my last report the Central Branch
Union Pacific Railroad Company have com-
pleted sixty additional miles of road and tele-
graph line. They are entitled, under the acts
of Congress, to no further subsidy.
Sixty-nine and a half miles of the road and
telegraph line of the Sioux City and Pacific
Railroad Company were completed, equipped,
and accepted in March last. About thirty-one
and a half miles, necessary to make a connec-
tion with the Union Pacific railroad, are under
contract and in process of grading. The iron
has been purchased and is in transitu. The
company have secured a water front of about
one mile on each side of the Missouri river,
and have contracted for a steam ferry to pass
the cars over the river.
The indebtedness of the company is repre-
sented to be ;
Cash of stockholders $1,676,000 00
United States bonds received on 69i miles
road  1,112,000 00
Duo contractors  511,80102
Aggregating $3,299,801 02
No stock certificates or first-mortgage bonds
have been issued. The amount received is
given as—
From passengers .861,407 79
From freight 1 44,156 li
From telegraph  1,135 97
Total $96,699 90
Operating expenses $53,184 98
The company have six first-class locomotives
and ninety-nine passenger and other cars in
use. They expect to have the whole line of
road completed and in operation next month.
No track has been laid by the Western Pa-
cific Railroad Company within the past year.
They, however, reported on the loth of Sep-
tember last that the grading of the unfinished
part of the road would be completed and ready
for the track in a few months.
No portion of the Northern Pacific railroad
has been constructed. The company report
that surveys have no'- been continued during
the past season for want of a military escort to
protect surveying parties.
In 1867 two lines were run from Lake Supe-
rior ; one commencing at the west end of the
lake and the other at Bayfield. The first, fol-
lowing a westerly course, crosses the Mississippi
about twelve miles above Crow Wing ; thence
runs south of and near to Otter Tail Lake, and
pursuing the same general course intersects
the Red river at a point between Port Aber-
crombie and the mouth of the Sioux Wood
river. The second follows a southwesterly
course for fourteen miles to Pleasant Bay;
thence westerly to within eighteen miles of Su-
perior; thence its course is direct to the Mis-
sissippi, crossing that river at St. Cloud; thence
northwesterly up the Sauk valley to the Sioux
Wood river a little to the south of where it
joins the Otter Tail river. Both of these lines
have such a direction on approaching the Red
or Sioux Wood rivers that when continued
westerly they will pass to the south of and near
the Cheyenne river iu Dakota. The distance
of the first is 232 miles, and its estimated cost
$7,9(57,000, being an average per mile of
§84,357 48. The distance of the second is
817 miles, and its estimated cost $11,815,000,
being an average per mile of $37,286 05. The
alignment is favorable on both routes. The
maximum gradients will not exceed thirty to
forty feet to the mile, and are of limited extent.
Upon the Pacific side the surveys were confined
to an examination of the Cascade range, with
a view to ascertain the relative elevation and
practicability of the passes. Three were found;
the Cowlitz or Packwood, 2,BOO ; the Snoqual
mie, 3,030; and Cady's, 4,800 feet above the
level of the sea.
The Atlantic and Pacific Railroad Company
have not filed the report required by the act of
June 25, 1868, and no information touching
their doings has been communicated to this
Department.
The Southern Pacific Railroad Company
report that they have surveyed only that por-
tion of their line lying between the towns of
San Jos6 and Grilroy, in the county of Santa
Clara, a distance of thirty miles. The grading
is rapidly progressing. The iron has been pur-
chased and is in transitu. They expect to com-
plete this thirty miles of road by the 1st of
April, 1869. Their capital stock is $1,800,000,
of which $72,000 has been actually paid in,
and their indebtedness $480,000.
The following statement exhibits the amount
of United States bonds issued to the respective
railroad companies:
Union Pacific, 820 miles $20,238,000
Central Pacific of California, 390 miles  14,7o4,000
Union Pacific, eastern division, 393 9425-
10000 miles  6,303,000
Sioux City and Pacific, 69£ miles  1,112,000
Western Pacific, 20 miles  320,000
Atehison and Hike's Peak, I inn 1 640,000
Central Branch,Union Pacific, J \ 960,000
l,793i miles nearly $44,337,000
The act of July 13,1868, authorized the sum
of $6,500, appropriated by the act of March
3, 1865, to be applied to the completion of the
bridge over the Dakota river, on the line of
the wagon road between Sioux city and the
mouth of the Big Cheyenne. A superintend-
ent was appointed in August last and the budge
is in process of construction.
Th  architect reports the completion of the
exterior marble work, and of the arrangements
for securing a supply of water to the central
building and south wing of the Capitol. Many
of the passages and rooms have been painted,
and other improvements made. Sewers for
drainage have been built, and the archways
under the porticoes paved, one with the Nicoi-
son and the other with the Burlew & Smith's
tar and gravel concrete pavement. He sub-
mits a new plan for the extension of the east-
ern froi't of the central building.
The bronze doors designed by Crawford have
been finished, and placed in position at the
main entrance to the northern wing.
The central portion of the Capitol has been
kept in good repair. It is desirable that Con-
gress should, without delay, authorize the con-
struction of apparatus to heat the rotunda, in
the same manner as the corridors and other
passages of the building are now heated.
The obvious necessity for the extension of
the Capitol grounds induced Congress to
authorize the appraisement of the contiguous
private property, the annexation of which was
deemed indispensable. Certain squares were
appraised in the year 1860, but in the absence
of legislation no further step has been taken
in acquiring a title to them. The appreciation
of other real estate in that portion of the city
would seem to require their reappraisement.
Delay complicates the difficulties incident to
the subject, and I earnestly repeat my former
recommendation of immediate and favorable
action by Congress.
The north portico of this Department has
been completed, and considerable progress
made in inclosing the adjoining grounds and
iu flagging the sidewalk which borders them.
The fund appropriated for these purposes,
although carefully and economically expended,
was insufficient. I confidently trust that Con-
gress will at an early period of the approaching
session provide means for the completion of
these necessary improvements and for paving
G street, between Seventh and Ninth streets.
The office of Commissioner of Public Build-
ings was formerly under the supervisory control
of the Secretary of the Interior. The act of
March 2,1867, abolished it, and devolved upon
the chief engineer of the Army its duties as
well as the superintendence of the Washington
aqueduct and of all the public works and im-
provements in this District, unless otherwise
provided by law. It wag evidently impractica-
ble for him to discharge in person these obli-
gations in addition to his other arduous labors.
An act approved the 20th of that month pro-
vided that the expenditure of the moneys which
had been appropriated for disbursement by the
Commissioner should be under the direction
of such officer of the corps as the chief engi-
neer might direct. On the following day Con-
gress provided that all moneys appropriated
for the Washington aqueduct and for the other
public works iu this District should be ex-
pended under the direction of the Secretary of
War. The terms of this act were broad enough
to embrace the Capitol and the contiguous public
grounds, but by another act of the same date
the control of them was reserved to this
Department.
1 recommend that these acts be repealed,
and the office of Commissioner of Public Build-
ings reestablished. I hazard nothing m saying
that since it was discontinued the duties which
appertained to it have not been discharged
more efficiently than formerly. This improvi-
dent legislation divides the charge over the
public grounds and works between two Execu-
tive Departments and withdraws an officer of the
Army Irom his appropriate duties to perform
services having no relation to his professional
pursuits and acquirements.
The following statement shows the amount
advanced to marshals of the several districts

fraying the expenses of the courts of the United
