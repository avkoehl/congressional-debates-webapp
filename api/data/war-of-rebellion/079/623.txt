JOHNSONVILLE, November 3, 1864.

Captain A. H. PLUMMER,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General:

The guns captured are in position and the place well fortified. The enemy on opposite side of the river. Gun-boats have engaged them. Have about 100 rounds of ammunition for 20-pounder Parrotts. Should like to have more sent. The enemy have no boats except the Undine gun-boat. The others, except the Venus, recaptured, are destroyed. The Undine is in sight, but can be caught by the boats here. The enemy have a battery about six miles below. Think they intend to plant one to-night opposite. We have our eyes open. The troops from Nashville have arrived. The break in the telegraph was between here and Waverly, cut by rebels about forty strong.

C. R. THOMPSON,

Colonel, Commanding.

NASHVILLE, November 3, 1864.

Colonel C. R. THOMPSON:

Your telegram to Captain Plummer has been shown me, and I have ordered down the Parrott ammunition you desire. Keep your men cool, and be prepared for the enemy when he attempts the attack. You have a sufficient force to prevent him doing any damage.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding.

JOHNSONVILLE, TENN., November 3, 1864.

Captain ROBERT H. RAMSEY,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

The general's telegram received. The men cool and confident. Don't think because I give you all the reports of scouts that we are scared. We have nothing of that kind in the camp. On looking over the boat Venus to-day I found over 200 rounds of ammunition for the 20-ponderous.

CHARLES R. THOMPSON,

Colonel, Commanding.
