tion established by President Jackson on the 29th of June, 1835, and reconfirmed by President Pierce April 30, 1855, issues in advance to the States and Territories under the law of 23rd of April, 1808, are not authorized to be made. This rule has, however, in several instances been recently departed from by issuing arms to some of the States for 1861. If you desire it, and will so indicate to me, I will refer your letter to the Secretary of War for his action in the case.

Respectfully, &amp;c.,

H. K. CRAIG,

Colonel of Ordnance.

EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT, Nashville, Tenn., November 20, 1860.

Honorable JOHN B. FLOYD,

War Department:

SIR: Will you do me the favor to have a statement of the number and character of arms advanced to Tennessee made out and forwarded to me; also the amount now due the State, and when the next installment of arms will be due?

Very respectfully,

ISHAM G. HARRIS.

ORDNANCE OFFICE, Washington, November 20, 1860.

Honorable JOHN B. FLOYD,

Secretary of War:

SIR: The letter from the quartermaster-general of the State of Ohio, referred to you by the Honorable S. S. Cox, asking that directions be issued to this Department to issue to that State such friction and Mayard primers and fixed ammunition as it might require on account of its quota of arms, or to allow it to purchase such, has been received, with your directions thereon for a report.

On the 10th of April last I reported that, in consequence of the changes that had taken place in arms and ammunition, and of the difficulty to the State authorities in obtaining the requisite ammunition for the new arms issued to them under the law of 1808, I recommenced that such cartridges for small-arms, pressed bullets, primers, and ammunition for field artillery as the States should form time to time require should be sold to them at cost from our arsenal supplies, and upon your call for a report whether such sales could be made in view of the act of 3rd of March, 1825, I had the honor further to report in favor of the measure. You came to no decision on the subject that I know of, and in my annual report of 30th ultimo I recommended that an act of Congress should be asked for expressly authorizing such sales to the States.*

In the special case in hand I recommend the sale.

Mr. Cox's letter in herewith returned.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. K. CRAIG,

Colonel of Ordnance.

NEW YORK, November 21, 1860.

Honorable JOHN B. FLOYD,

Secretary of War:

SIR: I understand that you have a large quantity of muskets changed from flint to percussion now at Watervliet for sale.
