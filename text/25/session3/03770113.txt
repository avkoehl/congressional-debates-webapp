equal ti such a crisis It is to these high quali-
ties that the country js indebted for its escape
from the grt ttes>t danger that ever threatened it,
whether considered with reference to its free in-
stitutions oi all its great interests
Had tl at institution been reestablished as the
head and center nf this vast system of banking
monopoly, the system would have been fixed
upon the countiy for all time to come, and nothing
short of a ci\ il revolution could have overthrow n
it It would have controlled the act on of this
Got eminent here, and made and unmade, as its
mteiestdictatcdjthe supreme Executive, and the
State Legislatures would have been equally sub-
jected to its influence Its power would have
been everywheie felt at the ballot box, and Us
corrupting influence beyond it, on the lepresent-
atives of the people All thegreatmterestsof the
countiy, and eveiy department of industry, must
have been subjected to its sway, and every kind
of employment would have become a gambling
operation, rising or falling, prosperous or de-
pressed, as the papei bubble was expanded oi
contracted This system, it is true, has its root
in the States, but the great cential institution
would have consolidated its power, and given it
that unity and energy which it cannot othetwise
\ ossess
The late Administration ísentitled to the credit
of having arrested the progress of this great evil,
and of arousing the public attention to its dan-
gerous and inevitable tendency The struggle
which was brought on has been severe, and if the
crisis is not yet past, the final issue cannot be
doubtful The deep interest excited has led to a
genetal discussion and investigation of the sub-
ject in all its bearings, both on the political rights
and the business and industry of the country
The evils and the dangersof this system of paper
monev monopoly aiealitady undeistood,and the
public mind is now engaged in devising a rem-
edy On that question there is much diversity of
opinion, but so long as the national sensibility is
alive to the danger, we have little to feai, as a
remedy in some form will, in due time, be dis-
covered The repulse which the system has re-
ceived here, ha& enabled the people everywhere
to rally and arrest its fmther progress
Those evils and dangers the Senator fiom Mas
sachusetts may regaid as imaginary, but, if he
supposes that a large portion of the people of the
eastern States do not consider them as realities, I
can assure him he was never more mistaken in
his life They were not speculative evils, they 1
were seen and felt in every interest and in every
employment,and especially by thepioducingand
iabonng classes It was on thtm that the euls
of the system fell with the greatest injustice and
seventy. It rendeied labor precarious, and its just
leivaids uncertain and fluctuating In numerous
ways unspen, yet not the less real, it robbed the
laborer of half his earnings, whilst it threw upon
him an accumulation of uurders.
Sir, the people understand this matter; they
felt the evils which were upon them, they saw
the dangers which are ahead, and they know to
whom they are mainly indebted for arresting
them, and preparing the way for a safe deliver-
ance fiom them, and a remedy against their re-
currence. They understand this paper money
monopoly and fraud, and regaid it as an ingeni-
ous rontuvance to confer on capital an undue
advantage, and to rob labor of its just reward;
or, in the expiessive language of the colleague of
the Senator, not now in his seat, they consider
it as the most successful scheme which the wit
of man has ever yet devised, to" fertilize the
rich man's field with the sweat of the poor man's
brow " And let me tell the Senator that his
constituents and mine, and those of the other
eastern States, understand this subject, mystified
as it is, too well, and know their rights too well,
to regard the man who put down the Bank of
the United States and arrested the progress of
this paper-money system, as having conferred
no other benefits upon them, and having no other
claims to their gratitude than in " his not having
vetoed the bounties of Providence "
Mi N said he had been cained along by the
ardor of his feelings, and gone further into this
subject than he intended, but would detain the
Senate no longer

BONDS OF UNITED STATES BANK
SPEECH OF HON. SILAS WRIGHT,
OP NEW YORK,
In the Senate, January 25, 1839
The report of the Secretary of the Treasury of the 27th
of December, 1838, and the message of the President of the
Jltli of Jinuary labt, bolh m answer to calls for information
m relation to thi. recent transactors between the Govern
meiu and the Bank of the United Stues, chartered by the
fotate of Pennsylvania, being under consideration—
Mr. WRIGHT said
Mr Prlsidejm- I rise to peiform a task from
which I had hoped to be discharged I had hoped
that some other member of the Senate, moie capa-
ble, and less likely to be suspected of partiality,
upon the one side, and of prejudice upon the
other, would have relieved me from it Hence,
to some extent, the long delay, on my part, to
ask the Senate to bring the subjectof these reports
again to its attention. And hence, too, the ex-
treme reluctance I have felt, and some of which
I have manifested to this body, to seem to court
a continuance of debate upon it The clearest
convictions of duty, however, to myself, to the
hitherto tried and faithful public officers whoso
conduct is brought under suspicion, and, above
all, to that great public, whose servants we all
are, to whom we are all responsible, and whose
full and clear and perfect understanding of the
truth, in reference to every public act of every
public servant, ought to be an object of primary
interest with us all, impel me to the course I
pursue
The lecent business transactions between cer-
tain executive officers of the Government and the
Bink of the United States chartered by the State
of Pennsylvania, has justly excited some interest
throughout the country     That inteiest has been
materially increased and strengthened by the man-
ner in which the chief officei of that banking in-
stitution has fi.lt himself authorized to speak to
the public of these transactions    It was not, there- |
fore, to have been expected, much ¡ess hoped,
that Congress would fait to make the whole sub
ject one of lnquuy and examination     The Sen- I
ate has not disappointed this leasonable expect-
ation      On the contrary, a lively and pervading
interest, m this body, has been given to the whole
matter, by the   particular care  with  which  the I
calls for information have evidently been drawn,
and by the anhcipatoiy debates which accompa   ¡
med those calls     The resolutions were passed I
without objection, and, when I remember their
particularity and precision, I feel authoiized to |
assume that all the facts are now before us, em- i
bodied in the reports under consideration   A fair '
and full examination ot those facts, and of the
conclusions properly and naturally to be drawn I
from them, is my present purpose, and I take
great pleasure, Mr  President, m promising you
that the duty shall be discharged with as little con-
sumption of the time, and as light a tax upon the
patience, of the Senate as shall be possible
Inasmuch, however, as the preexisting rela-
tions between the Government of the United
States and the Bank of the United States have
given foundation for the transactions complained
of, a very brief notice of those relations will, in
my estimation, contribute essentially to a full and
clear understanding of the matters under discus-
sion The first ot these relations was that of a
partnership in banking, and the second was that
of creditor and debtor, and out of both have
grown the proceedings which form the subject
of this debate
The Bank of the United States, as a national
institution, commenced its chartered existence on
the 4th day of March, 1816 By the terms of
the charter, the United States were to hold the
one fifth part of it3 whole stock—an amount
equal to $7,000,000 Thatstock was taken, and,
with very trifling exceptions comparatively, was
held throughout the term of twenty years which
the charter had to run. I believe that some
transfers of stock from the general Treasury to
the Navy pension fund had vaued, very limited-
ly, the amount of that direct interest, but the va-
uation is immaterial to the purposes of this ar-
gument; and, as the transfer was made to a trust
fund, in the safety and protection of which an
interest was felt, and actually existed, equal to
that for the safety and protection of any other
equal portion of the public treasjre, the real
public interest was not at all changed.
Upon the expiration of the charter of the bank
as a national institution, in March, 1836, this
great interest was left subject to the management
of the directors and other officers of the bank
during the two years allowed by the chai ter for
the winding up of its affairs, and left, almost ne-
cessarily, in an unproductive state Hence, the
early interest felt and manifested, as well m Con-
gress as by the chief fiscal officer of the Govern-
ment, to give prompt and efficient attention to
this portion of the public treasure The charter
of the bank expired during the session of Con-
gress, and before its ad)ourntnent a law was
passed constituting the Secretary of the Treas-
ury the agent of the United States to superintend
this interest, with full power to liquidate tha
amount, to receive payment, or to take security
for payment at a future day, submitting to his
sole discretion the forbearance to be extended and
the sufficiency of the security to be offered
In the meantime, and at about the period, if
not upon the very day, of the expnatten of the
chattel, a proceeding was had by the board of
directors of the bank, which I must be permitted
to call singular, at the least, and especially so, as
it was a proceeding to which the Government
was in no sense a party. The whole bank,ats
stock, debts, credits, and effects, of every name
and character, were sold and transferredto a bank-
ing institution chartered by the State of Pennsyk
vania This transfer took place in March, and
the law of Congress last referred to did not pass
until the 23d of June after The transfer was to
an institution in which, upon the face of its
charter, the United States were prohibited from
hnldirg stock,so that the Government could take
nothing in the new bank by this sale of its prop-
erty in the old Such was the condition of this
public interest at the time Congress adjourned in
1836
It is proper to pause here and see what was the
state of the public Treasury at this period, that
we may estimate the willingness, on the part of
all the public functional íes, to accept security for
the payment of this debt at a future day, instead
of payment in hand, and consequently the will-
ingness of -Congiess to submit the time of pay-
ment to the Secretary of the Treasury alone. The
Treasury was, at the time referred to, full to
overflowing, and statesmen of the greatest expe-
rience and deepest i eftection considered the abun-
dance of our revenues, and the surplus of our
treasure, as one of the severest evils which then
did, or which ever had, threatened the purity and
permanency of our institutions So great was
the desire to discharge the country from the cor-
rupting and demora'izing influences of this flood
of money, that, on the very day on which this
agency over our interest in the bank was given
to the Secretary of theTreasury, a law was passed
to set apart fiom the general and ordinary uses
of the Treasury, and distnbute to the States, in
the form of a deposit, mine than thirty-seven
million dollars of the public money This law
stands upon the statute book next before that
which authorizes the Secretary to extend a credit
upon the debtduefrom the bank
I will now pass to the next session of Con-
gress, the annual session of 1836-37 On the
1st day of January, 1837, the balance was to be
struck, and all the money found in the Treasury,
deducting $5,000,000 to meet outstanding appro-
priations, was to be laid aside, and deposited
with the States, in the ratio of their representation
in the two Houses of Congress, the one quarter
on that day, one other quarter on the 1st day of
April, the third quarter on the lstday of July,and
the remaining quaiteron the 1st day of October, of
that year This left the Treasury with 15,000,000
of means, and something more than #14,000,008
of outstanding appropriations The eurrent rev-
enue of the year, therefore, must meet the bal-
ance of outstanding appropriations beyond the
§5,000,000 left m the Treasury, and also the cur-
rent appropriations of the year, or the money
placed in deposit with the States must be called
back to pay the deficiency.   This, I think, was
