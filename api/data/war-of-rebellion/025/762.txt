Lieutenant-General PEMBERTON:

General Smith reports that the gunboats have left on their way back; did not descend below Ashton, near Grand Lake.

Colonel Adams has sent the men ordered, leaving at Columbus 300 militia, 1 battery, and 80 heavy artillerists. I ordered Captain Landis this morning to proceed with his battery to Abbeville; it came from that post here to be fixed up.

ABBEVILLE, November 26, 1862-1 p. m. (Received November 27, 1862.)

Major J. R. WADDY:

Generals Pemberton and Van Dorn are not here. The enemy reported moving down from Memphis and in front, and gunboats, transports, mortar-boats, and rams are said to have gone down yesterday. I believe the attack is to be on Vicksburg. The generals are expected to-morrow. Your dispatches received. I suggest that the Holmes matter needs your attention, as the general may not return until late to-morrow.

Inform General Pemberton that General Holmes is understood as objecting to troops going from his command to Vicksburg. Another order from the War Department is necessary.

General Pemberton is with the army at Abbeville, Miss.

J. R. WADDY,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
