1833.                                 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.                                       5
the extent of the commerce carried on between
the United States and those islands, particularly
the former, this discrimination causes serious in-
jury to one of those great national interests which
it has been considered an essential part of our pol-
icy to cherish, and has given rise to complaints
on the part of our merchants. Under instructions
given to our Minister at ¡Madrid, earnest represent-
ations have been made by him to the Spanish
Government upon this subject, and there is reason
10 expect, from the fuendly disposition which is
entertained towards this country, that a beneficial
change will be produced. The disadvantage, how-
ever, to which our shipping is subjected by the
operation of these discriminating duties, requires
that they be met by suitable countervailing duties
during your present session—power being at the
same time vested in the President to modify or
discontinue them as the discriminating duties on
American vessels or their cargoes may be modified
or discontinued at those islands Intimations
have been given to the Spanish Government that
the United States may be obliged to resort to such
measures as are of necessary self-defense, and there
is no reason to apprehend that it would be unfa-
vorably received The proposed proceeding, if'
adopted, would not be permitted, however, in any
degree to induce a relaxation in the efforts of our
Minister to effect a repeal of this irregularity by
friendly negotiation, and it might serve to give force
to his representations, by showing the dangers to
which that valuable trade is exposed by theobstruc-
tionsand burdens which a system of discriminating
and countervailing duties necessarily produces.
The selection and preparation of the Florida
ai chives, for the purpose of being delivered over
to the United States, in conformity with the royal
order, as mentioned in my last annual message,
though in progress, has not yet been completed
This delay has been produced, partly by causes
which were unavoidable, particularly the preva-
lence of cholera at Havana, but measures have
been taken, which it is believed will expedite the
delivery of those important records
Congress were informed, at the opening of the
lest session, that " owing, as was alleged, to em-
' barrassments in the finances of Portugal, conse-
' quent upon the civil war in which that nation was
'engaged," payment had been made of only one
instalment of the amount which the Portuguese
Government had stipulated to pay for indemnify-
ing our citizens for property illegally captured m
the blockade of Terceira Since that time, a
postponement for two years, with interest, of the
two remaining instalments, was requested by the
Portuguese Government; and as a consideration,
it offered to stipulate that rice of the United States
should be admitted into Portugal at the same
duties as Brazilian rice Being satisfied that no
better arrangement could be made, my consent
was given, and a royal o'der of the King of Por-
tugal was accordingly issued on the 4th of Feb-
ruary last for the reduction of the duty on rice of
the United States It would give me great pleas-
ure if, in speaking of that country, in whose pros-
perity the United States are so much interested,
and with whom a long subsisting, extensive, and
mutually advantageous commercial intercourse has
strengthened the relations of friendship, I could
announce to you the restoration of its internal
tranquillity
Subsequently to the commencement of the list
fusion of Congress the final instalment payable
by Deiumrk.undei the convention of the 28th day
ol March, 1830, was received The commissioners
for examining the claims have since terminated
their labors, and their awards have been paid at
the Treasuiy as they have been called foi The
justice rendered to our citizens by that Govern-
ment is thus completed, and a pledge is thereby
afforded for the maintenance of that fuendly inter
course becoming the relations that the two nations
mutually bear to each othei
It is satisfactory to inform you that the Danish
Government has recently issued an ordinance by
The ratifications of the convention with the King
of the Two Sicilies have been duly exchanged, and
the commissioners appointed for examining the
claims under it have entered upon the duties as-
signed to them by law The friendship that the
interests of the two nations require of them being
now established, it may be hoped that each will
enjoy the benefits which a liberal commerce should
yield to both.
A treaty of amity and commerce between the
United States and Belgium was concluded during
the last winter, and received the sanction of the
Senate, but the exchange of the ratifications has
been hitherto delayed, in consequence, in the first
instance, of some delay m the reception of the treaty
at Brussels, and subsequently, of the absence of
the Belgian Minister of Foreign Affairs at the im-
portant conferences in which his Government is
engaged at London.
That treaty does not embody those enlarged
principles of friendly policy which it is sincerely
hoped will always regulate the conduct of the two
nations, having such strong motives to maintain
amicable relations towards each other, and so sin-
cerely desirous to cherish them.
With all the other European Powers with whom
the United States have formed diplomatic relations,
and with the Sublime Porte, the best understand-
ing prevails From all I continue to receive as-
surances of good will towards the United States—
assurances which it gives me no less pleasure to
reciprocate thaji to receive. With all, the engage-
ments which have been entered into are fulfilled
with good faith on both sides. Measures have
also been taken to enlarge our friendly relations
and extend our commercial intercourse with other
States The system we have pursued of aiming
at no exclusive advantages, of dealing with all on
terms of fair and equal reciprocity, and of adher-
ing scrupulously to all our engagements, is well
calculated to give success to effoits intended to be
mutually beneficial
The wars of which the southern part of this
continent was so long the theater, and which were
carried on, either by the mother country against
the States which had formerly been her colonies,
or by the States against each other, having term-
inated, and their civil dissensions having so far
subsided as, with few exceptions, no longer to
disturb the public tranquillity, it is earnestly hoped
those States will be able to employ themselves
without interruption in perfecting their institutions,
cultivating the arts of peace, and promoting, by
wise counsels and able exertions, the public and
private prosperity which their patriotic struggles
so well entitle them to enjoy.
With those States our relations have undergone
but little change during the present year No re
union having yet taken place between the States
which composed the Republic of Colombia, our
charge d'affaires at Bogota has been accredited to
the Government of New Granada, and we have,
therefore, no diplomatic relations with Venezuela
and Ecuador, except as they may be included in
those heretofore formed with the Colombian Re-
public It is understood that representatives from
three States were about to assemble at Bogota to
confer on the subject of their mutual interests,
particularly that of their union, and if the result
should render it necessary, measures will betaken
on our pait to preserve with each that friendship
and those libeial commercial connections which it
has been the constant desire of the United States
to cultivate with their sietei Republics of this hemi-
sphere Until the lmpoitant question of leumon
shall be settled, however, the different ma'ters
which have been unde- discussion between the Uni-
ted States and the Republic of Colombia, or eithei
of the States which composed it, are not likely to
be brought to a satisfactory issue
In consequence of the illness of the charge
d'affaires appointed to Central America at the last
sess<on ot Congress, he was prevented from pro-
ceeding on his mission until the month of Ouober
IL is hoped, however, that he is by this time at his
post,and thatthe official inteicouise, unfortunately

This change cannot fail to prove beneficial to the     part of the two nation* so amicably and ad van

ot^ei nations                                                                  '     It is Ratifying to state that since my last annual
message, some of the most important claims of
our fellow-citizens upon the Government of Brazil
have been satisfactorily adjusted, and a relianceis
placed on the friendly dispositions manifested by
it that justice will also be done in others. No new
causes of complaint have arisen, and the trade
between the two countries flourishes under the
encouragement secured to it by the liberal provis-
ions of the treaty.
It is cause of regret that, owing, probably, to
the*civil dissensions which have occupied the at-
tention of the Mexican Government, the time
fixed by the treaty of limits with the United States
for the meeting of the commissioners to define the
boundaries between the two nations has been
suffered to expire without the appointment of any
commissioners on the part of that Government.
While the true boundary remains in doubt by
either party, it is difficult to give effect to those
measures which are necessary to the protection
and quiet of our numerous citizens residing near
that frontier. The subject is one of great solici-
tude to the United States, and will not fail to re-
cieve my earnest attention
The treaty concluded with Chili, and approved
by the Senate at its last session, was also ratified
by the Chilian Government, but with certain addi-
tional and explanatory -articles of a nature to have
required it to be again submitted to the Senate.
The time limited for the exchange of the ratifica-
tions, however, having since expired, the action
of both Governments on the treaty will again be-
come necessary.
The negotiations commenced with the Argen-
tine Republic relative to the outrages committed
on our vessels engaged in the fisheries at the Falk-
land Islands by persons acting under the color of
its authority, as well as the other matters in con-
troversy between the two Governments, have been
suspended by the departure of the charge d'affaires
of the United States from Buenos Ayres. It is
understood, however, that a minister was subse-
quently appointed by that Government to renew
the negotiation in the United States; but, though
daily expected, he has not yet arrived in this
country.
With P?ru no treaty has yet been formed, and
with Bolivia no diplomatic intercourse has yet
been established It will be my endeavor to en-
courage those sentiments of amity and that liberal
commerce which belong to the relations in which
all the independent States of this continent stand
towards each other.
I deem it proper to recommend to your notice
the revision of our consular system. This has
become an important branch of the public service,
inasmuch as it is intimately connected with the
preservation of our national character abroad, with
the interest of our citizens in foreign" countries,
with the regulation and care of our commerce,
and with the protection of our seamen. At the
close of the last session of Congress I communi-
cated a report from the Secretary of State upon the
subject, to which I now refer, as containing in-
formation which may be useful in any inquiries
that Congress may see fit to institute with a view
to a salutary reform of the system
It gives me great pleasure to congratulate you
upon the prosperous condition of the finances of
the country, as will appear from the report which
the Secretary of the Treasury will, in due time,
lay before you The receipts into the Treasury
duung the present year, will amount to more than
thirty-two millions of dollars The revenue de-
rived from customs will, it is believed, be more
than twenty eight millions, and the public land3
will yield about three millions The expenditures
within the year for all objects, including $2,572,-
248 99 on account of the public debt, will not
amount to twenty-five millions, and a large bal-
ance will remain in the Treasuiy after satisfying
all the appropriations chargeable on the revenue
for the present year
The measures taken by the Secretary of the
Treasuiy will probably enable him to pay off, in
the course of the present year, the residue of the
exchanged four-and-a-half percent stock, redeem-
able on the fiist of January next It has, there-
foie, been included in the estimated expenditure of
this'yeai, and formsa partofthesurr above stated
