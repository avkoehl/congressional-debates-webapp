WASHINGTON, February 1, 1864-12. 30 p. m.

Brigadier-General KELLEY,

Cumberland, Md., and

Brigadier-General SULLIVAN,

Harper's Ferry, W. Va.:

General Lockwood has been directed to send you all available troops in his department;also one battery, one regiment of cavalry, and one regiment of infantry have been ordered from this place. As these will soon reach Harper's Ferry, re-enforcements can be drawn from that place.

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.

CUMBERLAND, MD., February 1, 1864.

(Received 12 m.)

Brigadier-General CULLUM,

Chief of Staff:

Nothing new from Milligan this morning. The railroad and telegraph yet safe. The cavalry seen near Green Spring last night was doubtless a reconnoitering party to ascertain the strength of the guard at the bridges across the North and South Branches of the Potomac. If they do not interfere with the road below here within the next twenty-four hours it will be safe, as Sullivan's cavalry will arrive at Romney, I trust, to-morrow. Sullivan will send me 1,000 infantry as soon as they can be got off.

B. F. KELLEY,

Brigadier-General.

CUMBERLAND, MD., February 1, 1864.

(Received 3. 20 p. m.)

Brigadier-General CULLUM,

Chief of Staff:

The telegram of General-in-Chief just received. I will now perfect my arrangements as rapidly as possible to take the offensive and drive the enemy out of the valley.

B. F. KELLEY,

Brigadier-General.

Colonel Mulligan reports the enemy's advance down both the New Creek and Patterson's Creek Valleys. In the New Creek Valley he is within 9 miles, skirmishing with his outposts. Please have the troops pushed forward as rapidly as possible.
