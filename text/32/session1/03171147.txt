1852.
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
1147
cific, Arctic,and Baltic, amounted to §2,344,142 71.
The sworn statement of the company, showing
the actual expenses and receipts of the'first twen-
ty-eight voyages of these vessels, exhibits the
actual average cost of each voyage at $65,215 64,
and the actual average receipts at $48,286 85;
leaving an average deficiency on each voyage, of
Spl6,928 79, or for twenty voyages, the sum of
5*338,574 40.
Under these circumstances, the contractors call
upon the Federal Government for additional as-
sistance, on the ground that they have built larger
and better vessels than their contract required of
them; that they have been compelled to combat a
most extraordinary and unequal competition; that
the cost, the interest account, the expense of run-
ning, and the premiums of insurance have been
uieieby largely augmented; and that without thus
exceeding the stipulations of their contract and
incurring these extraordinary expenditures, they
could not have accomplished the great object to
which the nation looked with so much solicitude,
and now contemplate with so much pride and sat-
isfaction.
This view of the case embraces many consider-
ations which entitle the parties to such an increase
of their compensation, as may enable them to
maintain against the Government steamers of
Great Britain that competition, which will con-
tinue, at least, to divide the advantages of the mail
and passenger service of the Atlantic with our
great commercial rival; for it is sufficiently obvious
that, from the moment the British Government
it. also be borne in mind that the compensation
paid the Collins line is £385,000 per annum; that it
has not yet been in operation two years, and we
have already received into the Treasury, from
postage, by the establishment of the line and the
postal treaty, more than the compensation paid to
the contractors.
The returns of postages show that they are
steadily increasing; and with the enlarged immi-
gration, travel, and commercial intercourse, must
continue to increase during the term of the con-
tract.
The postage receipts accruing to the United
States Government by the establishment of this
line, and postal arrangement with Great Britain,
up to the quarter ending 31st March, 1852,
amounted, as above stated, to the sum of
§828,675 59, of which amount f.138,606 55 ac-
crued to the Government by the postal treaty, and
before the commencement of service by tlie Col-
lins line, all of which in the absence of our own
steamers, and the postal treaty, that resulted from
the policy of establishing these lines, would have
been contributed by American citizens to the
maintenance of the powerful commercial and naval
marine of a foreign Government. And this would
have been but a small portion of the contribution;
for the passage money, tlie freights on bullion and
on expensive articles of merchandise, largely ex-
ceed the sum that is levied in the shape of sea
postage. Indeed a more ingenious and successful
scheme for the maintenance of a formidable steam
navy, at the expense of the other nations of the
! world, and to the actual profit of the British Ex-
made its first contract with Mr. Cunard to carry , - . , . .
the Atlantic mail, at ic0,000 per annum, (a sum Jl chequer, could not have been devised,
now largely increased,) the door was closed to I I am aware that the objection las
mere individual enterprise, or commercial compe-
tition.
The tonnage of the Collins steamers largely ex-
ceeds the whole amount stipulated in llieir con-
tract, and is competent to perform the increased
service required by the Post Office Department.
And it should be observed in this connection, that
the sum now paid to this line constitutes no charge
on the Treasury, but is overpaid by the trans-
atlantic postages, as will be seen from the letter
of the Postmaster General to the Naval Commit-
tee, extracts from which I will now read:

In the preceding- statement, the closed mails are
estimated for the quarter ending December 31st,
3 851, and the newspaper closed mail accounts tor
the quarter ending 31st March, 1852, are not in-
cluded. . , „
I will state for the information of the Senate,
that the closed mails here alluded to are those sent
to Canada and other colonies of Great Britain,
upon which a stated sum per pound is paid. Let
am aware ttiat tne oujection has been urged
j against this line of mail steamers or the contem-
plated increase of pay, that it builds up a monop-
oly by which individuals are sustained at the ex-
pense of other members of the commercial com-
munity. But, in my opinion, the aid of Congress
was invoked to neutralize an existing foreign
monopoly, against which American enterprise
could not, venture to struggle, until it was also en-
couraged and stimulated by the aid of the General
Government. The aid asked for is to pi event the
resumption,by Great Britain, of a monopoly now
lost, and which, cost what it may, she ought never
to be permitted to regain.
But, passing over this view of the case, the pres-
ent application loses all semblance of a monopoly,
from the stipulation of the contractors themselves
to transfer their ships at cost, with their contracts,
and all the additional facilities that may be ex-
tended to them by Congress, to any persons who
may be acceptable to Government, anil capable of
carrying out an enterprise of such vital interest
and importance to the nation. In addition to this,
there is $1 ,000,000 of the stock of the company,
now represented by its bonds and debts, not yet
taken, which will continue open to the subsctip-
tion of American citizens, in the event of a fixvor-
able issue to the present application for additional
compensation. In considering this important Sub-
ject hi all the aspects in winch it lias been pre-
sented, I cannot avoid the conclusion that it is the
true policy and obvious duty of the Government
to sustain this line of steamers by such appropria-
tions as may be necessary. The enterprise is one
of a national character. It enlists national feeling,
pride, and interests, and must be regarded m a
broad and liberal view, without reference to the
narrow apprehension that too large a remuneration
may accrue to individual beneficiaries. II this
objection were not entirely removed by the stipu-
lation to transfer the contract, a sense ot justice
would dictate that the parties who have run the
hazard of this enterprise and have achieved its re-
markable results, should receive their reward.
Their success has elevated the American name
and character; it has wrested from Great Britain
the palm of the maritime dominion, and merits ^
such a substantial recognition by the American i
Government as will indicate that ihe contest is a I
national one upon both sides, and not a strife be- •
tween ail association of American citizens and the
greatest governmental power of the world. 1 heir
enterovise cannot fail to commend itself to every
American mind as worthy the spirit of the age,
and the genius and destiny of our people.
Mr. HUNTER. Mr. President, I am opposed
to this amendment. I know that the opposition
which I shall raise will be perfectly vain and fruit-
less ; but I hold it to be a duty wluch I owe to the
Senate and to the country, to raise my voice
against the continuance of a principle which I
think I can show is the adoption of that of the
protective system in one of its very worst forms.'
That, sir, is the greatest, but not the only objec-
tion to it. In the first place, this is an amendment
to a deficiency bill. There is no pretense that we
have not provided for Mr. Collins $385,000 per
annum, the sum specified in his contract. There
is, therefore, no deficiency.
In the next place, if we should believe tliat the
change made by the Postmaster General ordering
up, as tliey call it in that Department, the service
from twenty to twenty-sis trips a year, to be right
and proper, the addition thai should be made jmv?
rata would only be, according to his own state-
ment, about«>96,250 for the additional trips, which
would make the compensation something like
^,431,000 a year for the twenty-six trips. But, in
this amendment, (which has been oflered to this
bill, I think, very improperly—for if Congress
mean to bestow this gratuity on the Collins line,
it seems to me it should be done as a separate meas-
ure, or, at any rate, in one of the general appro-
priation bills,) we find, as I think, a manifest con-
tradiction. The amendment provides, that the
increased service from the first of January, 1852,
shall be at the rate of $33,000 per trip, ill lieu of
the present allowance ; and it also appropriates
the sum of $236,500, in addition to what is al-
ready provided. Now, the addition of the sum of
$230,500 to $385,000, the amount they now re-
ceive, makes a fraction over $,(120,000 per annum.
But twenty-six trips, at $33,000 per trip, would
be §858,000 a year, which they would get for this
service. But take either sum, the higher or the
lower, it seems to me, that there is no good reason
for granting it in this bill, and at this time. Nor
do I believe that it can be justified by sound policy
or justice, at any time.
Sir, we are told that this is a grand enterprise,
in which the credit of the nation is concerned.
On the one hand, we are assured that these indi-
viduals cannot keep up this contest without fur-
ther aid from the Government, because the British
Government gives a greater support to the Cunard
line; and, on the other hand, we are assured that
it has already brought in postages enough to pay
us. I understood 'the honorable Senator from
California to contend that the Collins line has
already brought m postages enough to compensate
for what we have paid "for it. in short,  e aie
told that, according to a fair calculation, thus far
the line has not cost us a cent. Now, 1 propose
to look a little into that matter.
Mr. GWIX. I stated that the postages re-
ceived under the postal treaty—which was the re-
sult of the policy of establishing these steam lines—
into the national Tieasury, had exceeded our ex-
penditures for the Collins line.
Mr. HUNTER. Then I understand that the
Senator from California does not maintain that the
Collins line has brought in as much as we have
expended on it?
Mr. G \V[N. I never said so. I said the amount
received—both by the Cunard and Collins lines,
since the postal treaty—exceeded tlie amount paid
for the Collins hue.
Mr. HUNTER. Then I submit that it has
nothing to do with the question before us. The
amount of money that we receive under the
postal treaty, and from the Cunard line, has noth-
ing to do with the question as to what the Collins
line brings, or how far it is calculated to bring, m
money.
Mr. GWIN. It is a part of the same policy.
Mr. HUNTER. We charge, on every letter
brought by the Cunard line, five cents inland post-
age. So we do on every letter brought by tlie
Collins line. Is all that to be given to the credit
of our share in this grand national enterprise?
Why, if we had had no postal treaty—if we had
had no steam lines—undoubtedly we should have
made a charge for this inland postage upon letters
brought here by the Cunardcrs. Now, if you
want to see what it is that the Collins line have
brought in to us, and what it is that we have ex-
pended, let os look at, the report of the Post Office
Department.
In the first place, we had to make an advance,
I think, of something like $380,000, to enable the
company to build the ships. In the next place,
we have given them §385,000 a year for twenty
trips. That is something like $19,000 a trip.
