MACON, August 14, 1864.

Honorable J. A. SEDDON, Secretary:

I have called out the militia; will get 4,000 or 5,000. I ask for 5,000 stand arms, with accouterments and ammunition; call was made by order of Legislature, at urgent request of Major-General Maury; 1,000 men already reported; cannot get arms without your order, although promised by General Maury; fatal consequences may follow failure. The Confederate forces here cannot save MISSISSIPPI or Alabama. General Forrest reports enemy 25,000 in La Fayette County. You know our resources.

CHAS. CLARK,

Governor of Mississippi.

Report of operations for the week ending Sunday, August 14, 1864.

1. Lover obstruction have been strengthened and closed; several torpedoes have been placed in the main channel about two miles south of the closed gate.

2. Round Battery: Two 7-inch Brooke guns have been mounted; the battery has been placed in position at Choctaw Spit; its parapet has been lowered; sand had been filled up in its revetment; cistern has been placed; the battery is in fighting order now, but will require ten more barges of dirt before completed entirely.

3. Iron-clad square floating battery: A 9-inch Dahlgren gun has been mounted in it; the battery is placed temporarily near the upper obstructions, from whence it will be taken to Choctaw spit as soon as the ordnance department will have placed the guns in fighting order. No crew is assigned to this battery yet.

4. Battery Gladden: Seven guns are mounted; the magazines, bomb- proofs, parapets, and traverses have been strengthened. The battery is in good fighting order. Piling in rear and front of battery has been commenced.
