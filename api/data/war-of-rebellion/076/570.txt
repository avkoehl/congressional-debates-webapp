General Kilpatrick time to make a good break in that road, so vital to Hood. We all feel confident we can succeed, and for that reason I do not regret that Wheeler has gone up to East Tennessee. I think we have force enough at Knoxville, the Gap, and Kingston to hold vital points until necessity will force Wheeler to come back; but I will leave him to be attended to by those in my rear.
