NEAR ATLANTA, July 16, 1864.

His Excellency the PRESIDENT,

Richmond:

Your dispatch of to-day received. The slight change in the enemy's dispositions made since my dispatch of the 14th to General Cooper was reported to General Bragg yesterday. It was a report from General Wheeler that Schofield's corps had advanced eastwardly about three miles from Isham's Ford and intrenched. As the enemy has double our number, we must be on the defensive. My plan of operations must, therefore, depend upon that of the enemy. It is mainly to watch for an opportunity to fight to advantage. We are trying to put Atlanta in condition to be held for a day or two by the Georgia militia, that army movements may be freer and wider.

J. E. JOHNSTON.

NEAR ATLANTA, July 16, 1864.

His Excellency the PRESIDENT,

Richmond:

Our scouts on the Tennessee report on the 6th that a division of the Seventeenth Army Corps passed Shellmound the week before. It had been relieved at Decatur and Huntsville by 100-days' men, and that from one to three regiments of these 100-days' men had passed up during that week.

J. E. JOHNSTON.

JULY 16, 1864-1 p. m.

Major-General WHEELER,

Commanding Cavalry:

GENERAL: General Johnston asks if you have ascertained the truth in regard to the reported advance of Schofield yesterday. We have scout reports which seem to contradict it.

Respectfully,

W. W. MACKALL,

Chief of Staff.

JULY 16, 1864-9 p. m.

General WHEELER:

GENERAL: The enemy disappeared this evening from their works in front of Green's, and from Turner's Ferry. A spy reported this evening that their right rested on the railroad-Hooker's corps-and that Palmer, Schofield, and McPherson were on the upper river.

Respectfully,

W. W. MACKALL,

Chief of Staff.

MOBILE, July 16, 1864.

(Received 17th.)

General J. E. JOHNSTON:

Have ordered seven companies reserve troops to General Withers, at Montgomery, to meet raid coming from Talladega.

D. H. MAURY,

Major-General.
