General TYLER,

Harper's Ferry:

At noon a special train will start, taking an officer and 10 men of the [First] Connecticut Cavalry, with their horses, to Monocacy Bridge; thence they will start as scouts, to see if enemy is coming around in your rear, or is or has been about Hagerstown, and will report to me telegraph from Frederick as soon as they can. Cannot you get, by scouts, definite information of the enemy in front of you?

WAR DEPARTMENT, Washington,

June 16, 1863-1. 30 p. m.

Major-General SCHENCK,

Baltimore, Md.:

My orders to concentrate your forces at certain points do not mean that you abandon block-houses established for the security of railroad bridges. These block- houses were built for the very object of saving these bridges from raids as far as possible. All other troops, excepting the small forces in block-houses, must be immediately concentrated as ordered.

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.

BALTIMORE, June 16, 1863.

Brigadier-General TYLER,

Harper's Ferry.

Do you want more subsistence? Have you enough for twenty days? If not, the train must go on. If so, the train must return. It will not do to have it exposed on road. We are embarrassed by not receiving prompt answers.

By order:

DONN PIATT,

Chief of Staff.
