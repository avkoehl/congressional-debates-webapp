favor of some bank, differently framed lie had
seen with surprise in the newspapers, the doctrine
that the members of this House aie elected to lep
esent the Piesident— o obey his will' The doc
tune was acted upon in this Hall. Who, su, are
we, and what are we > If we have lost the sub-
stance, let us down with its forms Why sit we
here piating about the laws,and the public funds?
Let us, in obedience to a INew Yoik organ, pass
the approrjnaüon and go home. Let us giease the
wheels of the idol, aim go home and tell our
wretched and distiessed constituents to piost ate
themselves befoie it, and be crushed to atoms
It had been intimated that the President would
order us to go home, and that we should shortly
receive the royal mandate If the President in-
tends to prorogue his Pailtament, he hoped he
would do it with historic forms Cromwell, after
calling together a parliament which at first sup-
ported him, though the majority afterwards turned
against him, determined to prorogue them He
cal'ed them to his presence m the painted Cham-
ber, (we, he supposed, would be convened in the
east room ) He told them that they had been in
session five months and had passed no bill, (our
time was not quite out yet ) They had done
nothing, except to encourage the L°vellers to in-
trigue with the Cavaliers, (the Nulhfiers with the
National Republicans ) By their dispersion they
had aided to throw the nation into connjs'on By
their slowness of proceed'ng, thesoldieis had been
compelled to take free quarters (It had not come
to that heie yet, though we had not yet got the
army appropriation I ill through ) You suppose,
continued Cromwell, that I cannot mise money,
except through you But he reminded them that
he was inured to di^Irulties, and that God, on
whom he relied, had helpedhim tluougnall The
people would be compelled, by necessity, to fui
nish him with suD^lies The very same anguige

!t vvillbeiememberedjsn, in the commencement
of tin bnlln it and poweiful eft )it, which has just
itceived such fixed and memed attention, the hon-
orable gentleman from South   Carolina alluded, |l
with somewhat of reproach, to the only parha-i
menlary measure by which a l gislative assembly I
can restrain discussion or compel a decision of a
I debated question, however essential to the public ,
i interests     He called it, sn, a " signal of retreat " |
i     I am nota military man, as is that gentleman, |l
but if I may be permitted to use his margal figure,
|| I would call it the stem oidei of "charge bayo- .
net," to which the most skilful general has some-1
times to resort to terminate a piotracted conflict, |i
i and  bring a  manoeuvring adversaiy to  decisive
11 action     1 feel assuied that there can be no just
' ground of complaint if, in the very presence of the
blaze of his  eloquence,  if, having received the
unanswered file of that tremendous park of artil-
lery which thatgent'eman supplies and commands,
those who approve the resolutions of the commit-1
tee are willing to abide this decisive charge
It cannot be necessary, sir, that I should remind
the House how long the subject of this debate has  I
I' been under consideration   how mjuuously the i
uncertainty of lis resultaffects the business of the
whole community, how necessary it is, as far as
may be, by our decision, to allay the agitation and
'  excitement whicli  distiact the country     In my i
poor judgment, the time has come when our duty I
requi.es a definitive dieoosition of this great and
I absorbing question     Impelled by ásense of duty, ,'
. I demand the previous question
I     Mr  BR1GCS, ard Mr HALL, of North Car- !
. olma, were appointed tellers, and the House sec- |l
,  onded the call—

Mi PLLDDN lose to a question of order By
the 3Gdi rule of the Hause, no membei should
vole upon a question in which he is interested
The SPEAKER deemed that such a question
could not tl en he i used, the House having sec
ondid the call foi the pievious question                    |
Mi SELDCN saui heundeistood there were
many members who, being stockholders in the
State bant s selected by the SecieUry for the de
po'itoiy vf the puu'.ic money, were mteiested m
the pi esent question, ai d can e within the ru'e
11 e SPEAKER said, when any membei who
was interested  was about to vote, then was the ¡
time to ia.=e^uch    n oljection

Mi   DICKSON, of New York, moved a call '
of the House, ard called for the yeas, nnri navs,
which were ordeied, and a motion for a call was
rejected                                                                           ,

Mi CHILTON said, if it was in order, he
vould move ih„t the f st resolu ion, v 7 " That
tne Bank f the united States ought not to be
rechaitcn it," should be laid on the table
The SPLAKCÍI deemed, that inasmuch as a
motion to lay on tl e tabie was of the second class
of puwle¿td questions, whilot í call for the pie
viot.b qaes'ion was in the third class, the motion
of Mi   C  havni" piecedeiice, was in order
Mi CHILTON men asked foi t' e yeas and

the t„ble, which were ordered, and the question
thereon liavirg been put, was decided in the nega-

So the House refused to lay this resolution on
the table
Mi WILDE appealed to the courtesy of the
House, as it was obvioustheie could be no fuither
debate, to peimit the vote to be taken, that his
fuends might have an opportunity of recoidmg
their sen lmentson the amendment submitted by
1 im, "that the leasona of the Secretary of the
Tieasury for removing the deposites were insuffi-
cient "
The SPEAKER said this was not m order,
except by unanimous consent of the House.
Mr POLKoljected
Mr BÜHÜ then moved to lay the other resolu-
tions (bung ihr 2J, 3a, and 4th) of the committee
