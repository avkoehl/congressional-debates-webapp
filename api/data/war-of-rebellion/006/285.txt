RICHMOND, September 27, 1861.

Gov. JOSEPH E. BROWN,

Atlanta, Ga.:

The thousand rifles were ordered to be given you instead of sending back the battalion from Lynchburg. Grave reasons of policy forbid sending back any troops from Virginia.

J. P. BENJAMIN,

Acting Secretary of War.

Assistant Adjutant-General, Savannah:

One thousand small-arms and one rifled 12-pounder were assigned by order issued to the proper ordnance officer for the service of Georgia.

J. P. BENJAMIN,

Acting Secretary of War.
