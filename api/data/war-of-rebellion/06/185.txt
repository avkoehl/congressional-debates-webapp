CIRCULAR.] HEADQUARTERS EXPEDITIONARY CORPS,

U. S. F. Wabash (off Port Royal, S. C.), Nov. 4, 1861.

The general commanding has the unparalleled gratification to congratulate the officers and men of his command upon their safe arrival at this point, after a most perilous and tempestuous passage from Hampton Roads.

Some vessels probably have been lost, but it is believed that the hand of Providence has saved the lives of all. For this let us be thankful to the Ruler of our destinies, in whom we must ever trust for protection.

Soldiers! Let the dangers you have encountered and the anxieties you have experienced be an incentive to a greater exertion on your part in the holy cause in which you are engaged. The eyes of your country are upon you. She expects you to conquer. Deceive not her expectations. Be cool and determined. Act only at the command of your officers, and be prompt to do so. Be not led away by a vain and spontaneous enthusiasm, nor restrained by a want of willingness or alacrity. Let your officers judge when you are to act; to do otherwise would lead to confusion and disgrace. Some of you have not had proper opportunities for instruction; let coolness, firmness, and the cold steel take the place of better instruction.
