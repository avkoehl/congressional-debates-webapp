THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
May 10,
P.UBJjl'c works at iiakpeii's feery.
Mr, WILLBY submitted the following res-
olution ; which was considered by unanimous
consent, and agreed to:
Resolved, That the Secretary of War be requested
to inform the Senate what is the present condition
of the public works belonging to the United States
at Harper's Ferry, in West Virginia; whether the
Department is now using the same for any purpose,
and, if so, for what purpose and to what extent;
whether it is the purpose of the Department to have
said works repaired and to resume the manufacture
of arms there, and if not, whether in the opinion of
the Secretary of War the property of the United
States at Harper's Ferry is any longer necessary or
advantageous to the public interest, and'mightnot
be sold or otherwise disposed of without detriment
to the public good.
COINAGE OF FIVE-CENT PIECES.
โข Mr. SHERMAN. T move to postpone all
prior orders and take up the bill (H. B. No.
ยง97) to authorize the coinage of five-cent pieces.
It will take only the time occupied in reading
it, I think. I do not suppose there will be any
objection to it.
The motion was agreed to; and the Senate,
as in Committee of the Whole, proceeded to
consider the bill. It provides that so soon as
practicable after its passage there shall be
coined at the Mint of the United States a five-
cent piece, composed of copper and nickel, in
such proportions, not exceeding twenty-five
per cent, of nickel, as shall be determined by
the Director of the Mint, the standard weight
of which is to be sixty grains, with no greater
deviation than four grains to each piece ; and
the shape, mottoes, and devices are to be deter-
mined by the Director of the Mint, with the
approval of the Secretary of the Treasury; and
the law now in force relating to the coinage of
cents, and providing for the purchase of mate-
rial, and prescribing the appropriate duties of
the officers of the Mint and the Secretary of
the Treasury is extended to the coinage herein
provided for.
This coin is to be a legal tender in any pay-
ment to the amount of one dollar. It may be
paid out in exchange for the lawful currency
of the United States, (except cents, or half
cents, or two-cent pieces, issued under former
acts of Congress,) in suitable sums, by the
treasurer of the Mint, and by such other de-
positaries as the Secretary of the Treasury may
designate, and under general regulations ap-
proved by the Secretary of the Treasury.
From and after the passage of this act no
issue of fractional notes of the United States
is to be of a less denomination than ten cents;
and all such issues at that time outstanding
shall, when paid into the Treasury or any
designated depositary of the United States, or
redeemed or exchanged as now provided by
law, be retained and canceled.
If any person or persons not lawfully author-
ized shall knowingly make, issue, or pass, or
cause lo ho made, issued, or passed, or aid in
the making, issuing, or passing of any coin,
card, token, or device whatsoever, in metal or
its compound, intended lo pass or be passed as
money for (he coin authorized by this act, or
for coin of equal value, such person or persons
are to be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and
on conviction thereof to be punished by a fine
not exceeding SI.000, and by imprisonment for
a term not exceeding five years, at the discre-
tion of the court.
It is to belawt'ul for the Treasurer and the sev-
eral Assistant Treasurers of the United States
to redeem in national currency, under sueh
rules and regulations as may be prescribed by
the Secretary of the Treasury, the coin herein
authorized to be issued, when presented in
sums of not less than $100.
Mr. SHERMAN. I move to amend the bill
in section one, line eight, by striking out the
word "sixty" and inserting "77.16," and in
line nine to strike out "four" and insert
" two ;" so that the clause will read :
The standard weight of which shall be 77.16 grains,
with no greater deviation than two grains to each
piece.
This amendment is moved after conference
between the Secretary of the Treasury, the
head of the Mint at Philadelphia, and the.
special committee having charge of this sub-
ject in the House.
The amendment was agreed to.
The bill was reported to the Senate as
amended, and the amendment was concurred
in. The amendment was ordered to be^ en-
grossed, and the bill to be read a third time.
The bill was read the third time and passed.
DUTY ON LIVE ANIMALS.
Mr. CHANDLER. I move to take up
House joint resolution No. 110.
Mr. RESSENDEN. I wish my friend from
Michigan would give me a chance to pass a
little bill which they say will save us a thou-
sand dollars a day, and to which there can be
no objection. It is a bill reported from the
Committee on Finance, and it will cause no
debate whatever. It is House bill No. 511,
imposing a duty on live animals.
Mr. CHANDLER. Let my bill come up
and then I will give away. I move to take up
House joint resolution No. 116, to prevent the
introduction of the cholera into the ports of
the United States, and then it can be laid aside
informally.
The motion was agreed to.
Mr. CHANDLER. Now I give way.
Mr. FESSENDEN. Now, if the Senator
gives way, I should like to take up House bill
No. 511, imposing a duty on live animals.
There being no objection, the Senate, as in
Committee of the Whole, proceeded to con-
sider the bill. It provides that on and after
its passage there shall be levied, collected, and
paid, on all horses, mules, cattle, sheep, hogs,
and other live animals imported from for-
eign countries, a duty of twenty per cent, ad
valorem.
Mr. EDMUNDS. Since this bill was re-
ported I have received information, which I
believe to be true, that a good many persons,
cattle dealers and others in the northern States
along the frontier, have purchased cattle in
Canada during the winter with the provision
with the seller that they should remain in Can-
ada until the spring, and that there are now in
Canada a considerable number of cattle which
are actually owned by citizens of the United
States, and have been paid for under the law
as it now stands admitting their importation
free of duty. In order, as an act of justice, to
authorize those people within a very limited
period of time to withdraw their cattle upon
the same terms they might have withdrawn
them before, I offer the following amendment
as a proviso:
Provided, That any such animals now hona fide
owned by resident citizens of the United States, and
now in any of the Provinces of Dritish America, may
bo imported info the United States froo of duty until
the expiration of ten days next after the passage of
this act.
That, I think, will do justice to that class
of persons without doing any injustice to the
revenue.
The amendment was agreed to.
The bill was reported to the Senate as
amended, and the amendment was concurred
in. The amendment was ordered to be en-
grossed and the bill to be read a third time.
The bill was read the third time and passed.
ASIATIC CHOLERA.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The, joint
resolution (H. R. No. 11G) lo prevent the in-
troduction of the cholera into the ports of the
United States, is now before the Senate, as in
Committee of the Whole, the question being
on the amendment reported by the Committee
on Commerce.
Mr. GRIMES. When this measure was
under consideration yesterday and the day
before, the Senate was assured that its passage
was asked for by the medical profession, and
especially by the Medical Association that-
recently assembled in the city of Baltimore
I believe we were told that the doctors for once
failed to disagree, and that they appeared be-
fore the Committee on Commerce unitedly in
i favor of this proposition. I apprehend that
there is some mistake about this. I hold in
my hand a letter written by Dr. M. L. Linton,
of St. Louis, and addressed'to^ the Baltimore
American, in reply to an artftle which ap-
peared in'that paper containing substantially
the same statement which was made here yes-
terday and the day before._ I need not tell any
person who is acquainted in the valley of the
Mississippi river who Dr. Linton is,_ lor he
has a reputation coextensive with the limits of
that valley as a gentleman of high professional
attainments and great excellence of personal
character. In this letter he says, addressing
himself to the editor;
Me. Editor: I notice in your report of the pro-
ceedings of the American Medical Association on the
fourth and last day of its sessions some glaring mis-
tulces.
It is well known to all who have attended to the
proceedings of the association that it refused not only
to memorialize Congress in favor of the system of
quarantine, but that it refused even to ask Congress
to test the utility of quarantine regulations. The
majority of the association thought that quarantines
had already been tested and iound wanting often
enough. At any rate, the vote was as X have stated;
nevertheless, there was a minority in favor of pe-
titioning Congress in favor of quarantine. This mi-
nority met at No. 47 Calvert street on the night of the
4th, and passed a resolution in favor of rigid quar-
antine measures; and appointed a committee of five
to present and urge the petition.
. The account in your journal goes on to say that
"the meeting consisted of some seventy-five mem-
bers of the association," and mentions Dr. Davis, of
Illinois, as among them. Now, Br. Davis -was not
there at all, nor can I find, after some hours of in-
quiry, any member of the association who was there.
There were evidently not seventy-five present; nor
did the few who may have met at No. 17 Calvert
street meet at eight o'clock, for thoy did not arrive
from Annapolis until about nine o'clock.
The main error, however, which I wish to correct
is this: speaking of the Calvert,-street meeting, your
report concludes in these words:
"The meeting then adjourned, thus terminating the
nineteenth annual meeting of the American Mcdical
Association." Now, all the members of the associa-
tion know that the final adjournment took placeon
the morning of the 4th, and that the little meeting
at 47 Calvert street consisted only of one portion of
the discontented minority that had been defeated
In full convention. I hope you will make this cor-
rection, so that when the committee of five shall
appear before the authorities with their petition, said
authorities may know that said committee lias been
delegated and empowered and sent by a little out-
side meeting held at eight o'clock at No. 47 Calvert
street, and not by the American Medical Association,
which held its meeting in Concordia Hall, and. ad-
journed on the morning of the 4lh, to meet again at
Cincinnati, May, 1S&7.
jtf. L. LINTON, M. D., .
Delegate Jrom tit. Louis, Missouri.
To the same effect I have a letter from one
of my own constituents, Dr. M. K. Taylor,
professor in the Iowa Medical College, .also a
physician of most excellent attainments, who
attended the medical convention last week in
Baltimore as a delegate from the Medical
Association of the State of Iowa, which I will
read:
National Hotel,
Washington, D. C., May 9,1866,
Hon. J. W. Grimes;
I see by tho rcjoorts of the proceedings of the Senate
yesterday that you opposed the establishment of a
uniform system of quarantine for tho United States,
as asked for by certain medical gentlemen claiming
to represent the American Mcdical Association, re-
cently in session at Baltimore.
Iam very glad that you have taken ground against
such an impractical measure. We may just as well
attempt to establish a cordon around the wind that
blows. It will go over the country as it has done
before, despite any and all quarantine regulations.
The memorial which has been presented to the
Senate did not emanate from the American Mcdical
Association, but only from a few disaffected persons
who-were not satisfied with its action and got up a
supplemental meeting after the as.-oeiation had ad-
journed. The principal leader in the affair was Dr.
Sayre, of New York, and fromtke pertinacity mani-
fested by him and a few of his friends I suspect there
is an ax to grind.
The communication presented to the Senate does
not represent the sentiment of the American Medi-
cal Association as a body in any sense.
I make this statement thismorning as Ishalllcave
for Keokuk this evening, and may not see you before
I go, and I feel it necessary to apprise you of the
facts before leaving the city. Dr.Huglies and family
are here also. lie leaves for New York this evening.
He goes to Europe on Saturday.
I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
M. K. TAYLOIi.
Mr. JOHNSON. Who is the writer of that
letter ?
Mr. GRIMES. Br. Taylor, of Keokuk,
Iowa, one of the delegates from that State to
