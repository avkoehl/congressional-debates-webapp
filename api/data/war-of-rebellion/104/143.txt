Lieutenant Colonel C. T. CHRISTENSEN,

Asst. Adjt. General, Military Division of West Mississippi:

COLONEL: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your dispatch of yesterday directing me to make arrangements to have my supplies forwarded and come up at once. The high winds prevailing all day yesterday and this morning have very much retarded movements. One vessel (the steamer White Cloud, Numbers 2.) assigned me is now at the wharf and the Eighteenth New York Battery is loading. The two remaining batteries, ordnance stores, ammunition, &amp;c., will be forwarded as soon as the winds and transportation will permit, and I will then come forward immediately.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JAS. TOTTEN,

Brigadier-General, Chief of Artillery and Ordnance.
HDQRS. ARMY AND DIVISION OF WEST MISSISSIPPI,March 30, 1865.

Captain M. D. MCALESTER,

Headquarters Sixteenth Army Corps:

I think the only fire the rebel gun-boats will be afraid of will be the mortars. They may, however, be put in General Carr's front and changed if the 30-pounder rifled do not drive off he rebel gun-boats.

E. R. S. CANBY,

Major-General, Commanding.

Captain J. C. PALFREY,

Chief Engineer, 13th Army Corps, General Granger's Hdqrs.:

Report received. Do not fail to use labor not required for important batteries in rectifying and connecting the advanced trenches and widening them to six feet, as ordered yesterday. General Bailey reports no arrivals of tools and siege material at Starke's Wharf as yet. The quartermaster's department is blocked, apparently. Will telegraph you the arrival of these articles.

Captain and Chief Engineer.
