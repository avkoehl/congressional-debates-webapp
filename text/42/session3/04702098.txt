ined the Calendar, and finding it waa not
there, I made no objection.
The SPEAKER. This bill is npt on the
printed Calendar, but it is nevertheless on the
Speaker's table, and is subject to tho same
two-thirds vote as other bills.
Mr. HOAR. Had I known that this bill
was embraced in the order, I should have
objected to proceeding to the Speaker's table.
The SPEAKER. The gentleman will ob-
serve that, however much he may be opposed
to this bill, he has lost nothing by the action
which has been taken, because the bill can-
not be acted upon favorably now except by a
two-thirds vote; and with such a vote in its
favor it could at any rate have been taken up
under a suspension of the rules.

tain that motion. The only question is, shall

thirds vote is necessary.

Senate for a conference will not be agreed to.

Mr. FARNS WORTH. I move that this bill
be referred to tho Committee on Commerce.
The SPEAKER. The Chair thinks it will
be.best to adhere literally to the order which
has been made. If the bill does not obtain a

two-thirds vote could at any rate reach it
wherever it might be.
