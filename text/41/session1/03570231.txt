and for the reasons. stated by the gentleman
from Maryland. [Mr. Swank,] that it would
endanger the lives of foot passengers and of
carriage passengers within this district, if the
bill shall pass in the shape in which it now
stands. In my judgment it should be care-
fully considered by a committee of this House.
It should receive that consideration which this
House cannot at this time give to it. The
committee should take testimony in regard to
it and examine everything pertaining to the
route which this bill proposes to establish for
this road within the District of Columbia. 1
hope that some committee, the Committee on
Roads and Canals, or the Committee for the
District of Columbia, or some other committee
will duly and carefully consider this bill before
it is acted upon by the House. I therefore
renew the motion to refer this bill to the Com-
mittee for the District of Columbia.
Mr. FARNSWORTH. I move that the
House do now adjourn.
The motion was agreed to ; and accordingly
(at tnree o'clock and thirty minutes p. m.) the
House adjourned.

Prayer by the Chaplain, Rev. J. P. New-
mas, D. D.
The Journal of yesterday wao read and
approved.
EXECUTIVE COMMUNICATION.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore laid before
the Senate a letter from the Secretary of the
Interior, communicating papers in relation to
the claim of Bruquier and Goewey for sub-
sistence furnished for the protection of Fort
Union in I860 and 18G7 ; which was referred
to the Committee on Appropriations.
PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS.
Mr. CONKLING. Mr. President, I rise to a
privileged question, and send to the Secretary
the Washington Chronicle of yesterday, con-
taining an alleged account of proceedings and
debates in a caucus of Republican Senators
held on Monday last. I have marked the por-
tion relating to myself. ,
The Secretary read the following :
" Senator Grimes replied, and said hcecrtainly had
no desire to stay. He had attended some weeks since
a caucus called at the instance of Senator Conkling,
and found nothing bat wrangling over the same ques-
tion that brought tliem together to-day. Then it was
a call for a caucus,which Senator Conkling ostenta-
tiously announced ' was to settle finally and forever
the tenure-of-office law.'
"Mr. Conkling denied making any sueh statement,
and rpoke in favor of the proposition to suspend for
four years, and thought it would bo as satisfactory to
General Grant as it was to him. He did not under-
stand why there should be such a disposition among
certain Senators to reject, all compromise and modi-
fication and insist so obstinately on repeal. It had
been dinned in his ears that the State Legislature of
New York had instructed him to vote for repeal, but
he rejected the claim of any Legislature or of any
man to become the keeper of his honor and con-
science. He should vote as he thought proper, and
not as thejStateofNew York thought, or the Senator
from Indiana or any other man."
Mr. CONKLING. It has never been my
habit to ask attention to statements in news-
papers or elsewhere personal to myself. My
belief has always been that matters merely
personal are not usually entitled to be urged
upon public consideration, and that individual
injustice had better be endured than to be
thrust into public discussion. I would not now
for the first time in my life depart from the
rule long ago prescribed for myself and ask
attention to the statement read were it appli-
cable only to myself personally. It is, however,
of more significance than this. It charges me
as a Senator with using language disrespectful
of the State which honors me with a seat in
this Chamber. It charges me with an unwar-
ranted assumption, and with braving and defy-
ing the sentiment of the Legislature of New
York. Therefore I have called attention to
the matter that I may pronounce the whole
statement without the slightest foundation.
The entire passage in every essential part is
untrue, as I take you, Mr. President, to wit-
ness, and every other Senator present at the
conference in question. Any statement in a
public journal upon such a subject is some-
what remarkable. A caucus like the consulta-
tions of a court, a jury, or a committee is in
its nature such as is supposed to forbid all
those who take part in it, and therefore all who
know what is said there, from making it public.
It can hardly be supposed that any Senator has
even truly disclosed the debates held in the
caucus on Monday last, and therefore it is not
surprising that, relying upon guess-work, re-
porters should have fallen wholly into error.
It is not rematkable that the New York Times,
a journal usually so careful and reliable in its
news statements and very creditably repre-
sented at Washington, as it, too, undertook to
publish what it cannot be supposed to haye
known, should have fallen into misstatements
which must at least amuse those who know
how far from the truth is the account of the
caucus telegraphed to that, journal from here,
which may bo read in the issue of yesterday.
Mr. GRIMES. Mr. President, as my name
is mentioned in the extract read by the Cleric
from the Chronicle, it is proper for me to say
that the statement, so far .as I am concerned,
is wholly untrue. I had no controversy and
no debate with the Senator from New York in
the conference or so called caucus to which
reference is made; and what remarks I did
make were entirely impersonal and referred to
no particular individual. As to the source
whence the information was derived, of course
I know nothing ; and in view of my experience
during the last year I have ceased to care much
about the statements that are published in
connection with my name in the public news-
papers.
