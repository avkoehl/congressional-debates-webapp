unjust to them. Governor Reoder* for reasons best
known to himself, ordered the former residences
of the settjers to be reported, f, like the gentle-
man from Georgia, [Mr. Stephens,] have, for the
purposes of this argument, carefully counted the
former residences of each of the voters reported
in this census, and find that our.figures substan-
tially agree; and now, after all the clamor we have
heard here and elsewhere about " down-trodden
and invaded Kansas," it does astonish honest,
plain men, throughout the country, to see that by
Reeder's own census a large majority of the settlers
of that Territory are from the southern States.
The account stands as follows: two thousand nine
hundred and five voters are reported as the whole
number—of which one thousand six hundred
and seventy are from southern States, and one
thousand and eighteenfrom northern States, -wj,ith
a remainder of two hundred and seventeen for-
eigners and others whose former residence is not
reported. With this state of things before them,
tho majority of the committee have been reckless
enough to bring in a report, which, if not totally
false, answers the same purpose—by a suppres-
sion of all the facts, material and necessary to a
correct understanding of the matter? in dispute;
and 1 am content to apply to their nefarious
work that universal rule of all codes of law and
morals, that willful suppression is criminal false-
hood.
I will .now compare the statements of this report
with the census of Governor Reeder, in connec-
tion with the election and representative districts,
and show that the pro-slavery party, by the legal
votes cost, must have elected a large majority of
the first Kansas Legislature; and, if this be true,
no matter how many Missourians may have voted,
it cannot alter either the law or equity of General
Whitfield's right to his seat., The following table
will show the strength of parties in the election
districts,.^ exhibited by the census:

I admit afree.State majority in the first district;
and the committee have proved, by the oath of
Ladd and others, that Bond, Willis, and Stearns
were driven from the election groundof this pre-
cinct; but these witnesses most positively state
that it was not, to prevent them from voting, but
because one was accused of acting the bully; the
other of, abducting a negro woman; and another
of taking notes.for the New York Tribune; and,
ctrange to tell, these eleven hundred and eighty-
eight pages nowhere prove that any other man
was prevented from voting. I appealed to the
gentleman [Mr. Sherman] who made this report
to name another, man, ana you saw that he was
silent.
Of the election in the sixth district this beauii-
Jill report makes the usual charges: five or six
hundred. Missourians present; Sheriff Jones and
pistols; and concludes with the false statement,
that " we are satisfied from the testimony that,
had the actual settlers alone voted, the free-State
men would have been, elected by a handsome
majority;" and yet the census of their own m$n
reports in this district one hundred an(Lthirty-two.
voters from the southern States—sixty-seven
from northern States. You see the unblushing
i mpudence— the brazen falsehood of this infamous
document! I take no pleasure in uttering these
Harsh words; but if gentlemen forget the high
obligations they owe to truth and honor—if a
man is false, to hutti&lf wu} his reputation in the
dirty work of party warfare, I will not be rec-
reant to duty, but shall denounce his act as it
deserves, if he were as tall as Lucifbr. They have
put forth these broad, unfounded statements to
mislead the public mind, which are contradicted
by Reeder's census at every step; and if ever
that gentleman uttered any truth- at any time, it
cannot be supposed that he lied in this document
in favor of the South. He, then, had no interest
so to do; but when these gentlemen made their
report, the power and necessity of a rebellious
and traitorous party demanded a perversion of
the truth.
Of the third district, the committee say four
to one free-State man. Governor Reeder says
forty-nine to thirty-seven; both reports cannot
be true. !
Of the fourth district, it is reported that " the
free-State men constituted a decided majority of
the actual settlers." Governor Reeder says free-
State men twenty-three, southern men twenty-
three, and one from New Mexico.
Of the fifth district, the report says: " From
the testimony, the whole district appears to have
been largely free-State, and had none but actual
settlers voted the free-State candidates would have
been elected by a large majority," but Reeder's
census shows two hundred and ninety-five south-
ern men, and one hundred and twenty-nine north-
ern men. It is impossible to believe so gross a ;
perversion was the result of misconception. i
Of the sixth district, the report admits that the 1
pro-slavery candidates received a majority, and I j
imagine for once it told the truth. I
Of the seventh district, the report says two hun-
dred to three hundred Missourians were present;
some residents did not vote; twenty-five legal
votes were east;.nearly all the settlers were free-
State men. The census shows thirty-two north-
ern men, twenty-one southern men; and it is thus
seen that the report fraudulently pretends that
the pro-slavery party, with a large body of Mis-
sourians to help them, only got three of these
twenty-one votes, while the other party got
twenty-three of thirty-two—some residents not
voting. Such facts and such logic are only worthy j
the cause they attempt to rustain. j
Of the eighth distnet, the report says: " in it !
thirty-seven votes, were cast, of whom a majority
voted the free State tiaket." The census shows I
twenty-five southern men, and twelve free-State
men. With such facts contradicting these State- |
ments, willany man believe anything contained in j
this report, when it is seen that the census is true, j
and the report had inducements to be false ? The
responsibility of this language is not mine: let
those who brought this base pile of " frauds and
perjuries" into this House answer to the country.
It deserves more than I have said of it, although
it has coat the people large sums, and Congress
much time, in its preparation. Of the ninth district
there is no complaint; and'of'the tenth, it is said
that ten Indians and eleven free State men, not
entitled, voted, who neatralize each other. Of
the eleventh and twelfth nothing is said that re-
quires an answer.
Of the thirteenth district, the committee say
" a majority of free-State men"—only twelve legal
votes cast; Governor Reeder says "there are fifty-
five southern men and twenty-two free-State
men;" which scatters to the winds another solemn
allegation of this committee; and members on the
other side of this House dare not trust these reck-
for electioneering purposes, and unworthy the
consideration of just men.
Of the fifteenth district, the report says: " the
free-State men thought themselves equal, and
some claimed a majority; but.the census shows
two hundred and six southern men and thirty-
seven northern men." Such truth and such honor
are truly Black Republican !
Of the sixteenth district, the report says: " the
testimony is divided as to the relative strengh of
parties;" but the census showsone hundred and
ninety-two southern men, one hundred and twen-
ty-nine northern men, and more than sixty for-
eigners, who, it is said, always vote the Demo-
cratic ticket; and yet this committee, in search of
truth, could not tell which had the majority.
Of the seventeenth and eighteenth districts,
nothing is said that demands a reply.
In conclusion, the report states the whole
number of legal votes cast at this election, four-
teen hundred and ten, with a discrepancy of five
hundred and twelve; of which number the free-
State men cast seven hundred and ninety-one,
which leaves six hundred and nineteen south-
ern men. The absurdity and unfairness of this
conclusion is fully manifested by the fact that
there were sixteen hundred and seventy southern
men to one thousand and eighteen northern men
in the Territory; and yet they report that, with
near five thousand Missourians to help us get
our men out, and drive theirs from the polls, the
northern men cast two hundred and seventy-two
more votes than the other party. Such a state-
ment is good for nothing, except to dishonor
those who made it.
Again: the report says " thirty-eight legal votes
were cast in the eighth, and thirty in the second
district;" thus claiming that every vote was polled
in the first, and not a sixth part in the latter.
This conclusion is worse than a guess—it is a
reckless statement,proved untrue by surrounding
facts; and I must so denounce it or retire from
duty, which is not my feeling at the present
time.
The election districts were laid off into repre-
sentative districts, some being divided for that
purpose. The following table is a reliable ap-
proximation, based on Governor Reeder's cen-

Not being able to ascertain the fractions, I
    have taken whole districts,and it is seen that, witlv*
less perversions unless, in their anxiety to place ' out the aid of the foreign vote, which our oppo-

one of their own party in the presidential chair,
they are ready to trample all justice, truth, and
honor under foot.
Of the fourteenth district the report admits that
parties were pretty near equally divided—but
strives to make the impression that the free-State
men had a " small majority;" suppressing the
material fact recorded in Reeder's census, that in
this distriot there were two hundred and eighty-
six•southern men and only forty-two free-State
men—showing aclear mistake of more than two
hundred votes in a single district. This is a fair
specimen of the truth of this report. Such " facts "
as it contains are not surpassed bv the stories of
Gulliver, Munchausen, or the wildest fanoies of
fictitious history. I. denounce them as unmiti-
gated, pattial, and fraudulent inversions, mads
nents charge is always cast for the Democratic
ticket, the southern men elect twenty-onei jnettt-
bers, and the free-State men only five; and these
facts and figures are a fall answer to the wise
charge of usurpation that comes up from the
other aide of the House. .
The storm that now rages over this country
i# political—raised by ambitious men m hopes
of obtaining power and public plunder; all out
troubles since Congress first assembled the
loud shrieks for freedom and Kansas the unjust
denunciations ofthe southern people, here and else-
where, are the result of this cause. We are now
in the midst cf a presidential struggle, which car-
i ries with it the government of this great country
