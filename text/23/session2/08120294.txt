THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
February 26,
fortnight 1 cannot understand the propriety of
this reproach The bill was explicitly announced
in the speech from the throne, on the very day in
which the Chambeis, met This was all that was
required to make known the opinion and design
of the Government, and to prevent that species of
moral proscription to which absolute silence would
have given a ithority With regaid to the mere
act of presentation, so long befoie discussion
could possibly take plaie, this proceeding wou'd
have been so unusual and extraordinary, that it
might have increased the unfavorable pieposses-
eions of the public, already too numerous, without
producing any real advantage in return Above
all, the result which the Piesident had in view, of
being able to announce the new voteof the Cham-
ber of Deputies in his message would not have
been attained
President Jackson expresses his regret that
your solicitations (z/isia«ces) had not determined
the King's Government to call the Chambers to-
getherataneailierday Howsoonsoevei they may
have been called, the simplest calculation will serve
to show that the discussions m our Chambers could
not have been known in the UmtetfStates at the/
opening of Congiess,and the Piesident's i egret is
therefore unfounded Moreover, the same obsta
cíes and the some administrative reasons which
rendered a real session impossible during the
months of July and August, were almost equally
opposed to its taking place befire the last weeks
of ihe year The heaj of a Government, like
that of the United States, should Le able to com
prehend more clearly than any one else, tho«e
nioial impossibilities which arise from the fixed
(haracter of the principles of a constitutional
regime, and to see that in such a system the Ad
mimstiatioti is subject to constant and legi lai
forms, fiom which no special interest, however
important, can authorize a deviation
Ii i", then, evident, that, far fiom meriting the
repioaeh of failing to comply with ite engage
ments, far fiom having deferred, eithei voluntarily
or from negligence, the accomplishment of its
promises, the King's Government, ever occupied
in the design of fulfilling them, was only arrested
for a moment by insurmountable obstacles I his
appears from the explanations now given, and, 1
must add, that the gieater part of them have
already been piesented by M Serruner to the
Government of the United States, which, by its
faience, setmed to acknowledge their full value
It is worthy of remark, that, on the fust of
December, tne ('ay on which Piesident Jackson
signed the message to Congress, and lemarked
with seventy that nea ly a month was to elapse
oefore the assembling of the Chambers,«they were
in leahty assembled, in vutue of aioyal oidmance,
calling them together a' a penod eaihei than that
fi st pioposed Their assemblage was not indeed
immediately followed by the piesentment of the
bil1 rtlitive to the Ameucan claims, but yuu, sir,
kn iw bettei than any other person the causes of
this new delay You youiself requested us not
to endanger the success of this, important afTan,
by mingling its discussion with debates of a dif
ferent natuie,as their mere coincidence might have
the effett of bringing other inluencs into play
than thee by which it sh< ukl natuially be gov
«rued By this request, you cleaily showed that
you hid, with youi judicious spirit, correctly
appieuated the situation of things, and the means
of advancing the cause which you were called to
t'fftnd A id permit me to add, that the course
win h you have bought pioper to adopv on this
point is tne best jus ificat on of that which we
ou^tlves have for some months leen puisuing,
in obedienc" to tbp necessities n herent in our
politi al oigani/ttion, and in order to ensure, as
far as I es in oui power, tne "iiccess of the rew
attempt whicn we weie piepaung to make in tne
Chamber
However this may be, the King's Government,
fre^d from the internal difficulties, the force of
which you have vouiself so formally admitted,
was preparing to present the bill for giving sane
lion to the treaty of July 4 h, when the stiange
menage of De-embe" first came, and obliged it
again to delibeiate on the course which it should
puisue
The King's Government, though deeply wound-
id by imputations to which I will not give a name,
having demonstrated their purely gratuitous char-
acter, still does not wish to reireat absolutely
from a determination, already taken, in a spirit of
good faith and justice How great soever may be
the difficulties, caused by the provocation which
President Jackson has given, and by the irritation
which it has produced in the public mind, it will
ask the Chambers for an appropnation of twenty-
five millions, in Older to meet the engagements of
July 4th But, at the same time, his Hajesty has
considered it due to his own dignity no longer to
leave his Minister exposed to hear language so
offensive to Frai ce M Serrunei will receive
oiders to return to France
Such, sir, are the determ nations of which I am
chaiged immediately to inform you in ortler that
you may make them known to the Government of
the United States, and that you may yourself take
those measures which may seem to you to be the
natural consequences of this communication Ihe
passports which you may desire, are, therefore, at
youi disposition
Accept, sir, the assurance of my high consid-
eration                                              DC RIGNY

Legation or ihe United Stvtes,     )
Paris, Januaiy 15, 1835  \
Sir [laving determined to send Ml Brown,
one of the gentlemen attached to the legation, to
Havre, with my despatches, I have ju^t time to
add to them the copy of the note which I have
sent to the Count de Rigny The course indicated
by it was adopted after the best i eflections I could
give to the suo]ect, and I hope will meettheappro-
bation of the President My fiist impressions
weie, that I ought to follow my inclinations, de-
mand my passports, and leave the Kingdom
This would at once have freed me from a situation
extremely painful and embarrassing, but a closer
attention convinced me that, by so doing, I should
give to the Fieneh Government the advantages
they expect to derive from the equivocal terms of
their note, which, as occasions might serve, they
might repiesent as asuggestion only, leaving upon
me the responsibility of breaking up the diplomatic
mteicouise between the two countries if I de-
manded my passports, oi if I did not, and they
found the course conveniens they might call it an
order to depart, which I had not complied with
Baron Rothschild also called on me yesteiday,
saying that he had conveised with the Count de
Rigny, who assiuel him that the note was not
mtei tied as a notice to depart, and that he would
be glad to see me on the subject I answeiedthat
I could have no verbal explanations on the sub-
ject, to which he leplietl -hat he had suggested the
wining a note on the sub]ect, but that the minister
had declined any written communication Roths
child added that he had madean appointment with
the Count de Rigny foi six o'clock, and would see
me again at night, and he called to say that there
had been a misundeistagding a^. to the time of
appointment, and that he had not seen M de
Rigny, but would see him this morning, but, in
the meantime, I determined on sending my note,
not only for the reasons contained in it, wmch ap
pear to me conclusive, but because 1 found that
the course was the correct one in diplomacy, and
that to ask foi a passport merely because the
Government near wh ch the Mimstei was accred-
ited had suggested it would be considere 1 as com-
mitting the dignity of his own that the universal
practice in such cases was to wait the order to
depart, and not by a voluntary demand of pass-
pnrts, exonerate the foreign Government fiom
the odium and responsibility of so violent a
measure
My note will force them to take their ground
ff the answer is that they intended only a surges
tion, which ! may follow or not as I enoose, 1 will
remain, but keep aloof until [ receive your direc
tions Jf, on the other hand, I am told to depait,
1 will retueto Holland oi England, and there wait
the President's orders In either case, the arrange-
ment will be extiemely expensive, and my situa-
tion very disagreeable The law was not pre-
sented yesterday, but will be to day, and I have
been informed that it is to be intioduced by an
expose, throwing all the blame of tne present state
of tbino-s on M SeTuner and me, for not tru'y
representing the opinions of out respective G v
ernments They may tieatlhen own Minister as
they please, but they shall not, without exnosuie,
piesume to judge of my conduct, and make me
the scape-goat for their sms The truth is, they
are sadly embairassed If the law should be re-
jected, I should not be sui prised if they anticipated
our reprisals by the seizure of our vessels in port,
orthea tack of our ships in the Mediterranean wi h
a superior force I shall, without delay, inform
Commodore Patterson of the state of things, that
he may be on his guard, navmg already sent him
a copy of the message
I have the honor to be, sir, your most obedient
servant,

Legation or the United States oi.      )
I                  America, Paris, January 14, 1835   )
,     The  undersigned, Envoy  Extraordinary and
J Minister Plenipotentiary of the United States of
America, received late last night the note of his
Excellency the Count de Rigny, Minister Secre-
taiy of State foi Foieign Affaus, dated the 13th
instant
,     The undersigned  sees with great surprise, aa
well as regret, that a communication made by one
! biancli of the Government of the United States to
another, not addiessed to that of His Majesty the
I King of the Fieneh, nor even communicated to
¡ it, is alleged as the motive for a measure, which
not only increases actual subjects of irritation, but
which necessauly cuts off all the usual means of
restoring harmony to two nations who have the
same mteiest, commeicial and political, to unite
them, and none but factitious subjects for col-
lision
The grave matter in the body of His Excel-
lency's note demands, and will receive a full
answer, it is to the concluding part that his atten-
tion is now requested The undersigned, aftei
being mfoimed that it is the intention of His
Majesty's Government to recall M Serruner, is
told " that this information is given to the under-
signed in order that he may communicate it to his
Government, and in older tl at he may himself
take those measui es which may appear to him the
natural result of that communication, and that, in
consequence thereof, the passports which he might
reqtuieareat his disposition " This phrase may
be considered asan intimation of tne course which,
in the opinion of His Majesty's Government, the
undersigned ought to pursue, as the natural result
of Mr Serrjner's recall, oi it may be construed,
as it seems to have been by the pubi c, into a
direction by His Majestv's Government to the
Mimstei of the United States to cease his functions
and leave the country
It is necessary, in a matter involving such grave
coi sequences, that there should be no misunder-
standing, the two categories demanding a line of
conduct entuely different the one from the other
In the first, he can take no directions, or follow
no suggestions but those given by his own Gov-
ernment, which he has been sent here to repre-
sent The recall of the Minister of France, on
the grounds alleged, could not have been antici-
pated, of course no instructions have been given
to the undersigned on the subject, and he wi 1 not
take upon himself the responsibility which 1 e
would mcui by a voluntary demand of his pass-
ports, although made on the suggestion of his
Majesty's Goverrment If this be the serse of
the passage in question, the duty of the under-
signed cannot be mistaken He will transmit the
note of his Excellency the Count de Rigny to his
Government, and wait Us instructions Widely
different will be his conduct if he is informed that
the conclusion of the Count de Rigoy's note is
intended as a direction that he should quit the
French temtory This he will, without delay,
ci mply with, on being so informed, and on re-
ceiving the passports necessary for his protection
until he shall leave the kingdom
Leaving the responsibility of this measure where
it ought to rest, the undersigned has the honor to
renew to his Excellency the Count de Rigny the
assurance, &c , &c
