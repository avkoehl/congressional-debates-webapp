see Captain Latham's report.*) Whilst Latham's battery was taking position I was advancing with Preston's regiment toward our then left flank, which the enemy was pressing and threatening to turn. About 500 yards beyond the left of Latham's battery, as placed in position and near the fence extending toward our left in a thicket of pines, and the enemy giving way, this regiment advanced still farther toward the left. Whilst thus advancing Colonel Preston came upon and captured with his own hands Colonel Wilcox, of the Federal army, whilst a captain and other prisoners were taken at the same place. THE report of COLONEL Preston, to which (beg leave to refer, will show the further important part he took in the battle.+

In the meantime, continuing to advance with Strange's regiment, Nineteenth Virginia Volunteers, and guided by the firing, I endeavored tot urn the extreme right of the enemy. Coming athwart an intense fire, and not being able to see friend or foe through the pines, the regiment was caused to lie sown whilst Colonel Strange and myself sought a view of the enemy. Entering the Sudley road on the left, I ordered the regiment to be marched by flank in that direction, and proceeded diagonally forward and left through the wood skirting our left of the road following a firing heard in that direction. Emerging from the wood into the open field, the regiment was led by a path toward Cinn's house, near to which a battery was firing upon the enemy. By the time it got up the enemy was retreating, and on the hill beyond Chinn's house (overlooking the turnpike), falling in with some of the regiments of Colonel Early, the nineteenth Regiment continued the pursuit of the enemy. Crossing the meadow toward the turnpike and proceeding by Dogan's house, followed the track of the retreating column toward Bull Run below Sudley's Mill and crossed the run below and in sight of the mill. The enemy now being out of sight and pursued by the cavaf us, and night coming on I determined to recross Bull Run at Sudley's Mill, and ordered the regiment to march back to Lewis' farm. Finding numbers of prisoners and wounded at the church near the mill, one company was left in charge of the prisoners and wounded, the balance of the regiment continuing its march to Lewis' farm. It would his appear, general, that in consequence of the disposition made of the troops, the firm and gallant manner in which they acted along my whole front line of three miles in extent (which front, although threatened throughout the day was nevertheless held in the face of greatly superior numbers, several assaults repelled, and the enemy effectually prevented from passing that line at any point, which if he had done would have been disastrous to our cause), this command forced the enemy to rely for victory solely upon his great column which, turned the left of our entire position by the way of Sudley's Mill; that he skillful and heroic struggle of Evans on my left, after he had been turned and taken in flank by overwhelming numbers, with his Spartan bend led by himself, and by that true and tried soldier Major Wheat, and the brave Colonel Sloan, and backed by men who showed themselves not only insensible to fear, but actually inspired with superhuman daring and power, carried death and dismay into the ranks of the enemy, the fight thus continuing for more than an hour unsupported, and until the re- enforcements of Generals Bee and Bartow and others came to the relief; and finally, when
