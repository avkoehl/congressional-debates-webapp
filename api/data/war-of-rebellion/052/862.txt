WASHINGTON, D. C., September 25, 1863.

Brig. General R. ALLEN,

Quartermaster, Saint Louis, Mo.:

Please have transportation complete for 20,000 troops that will be at Nashville on the 1st proximo without transportation for ammunition, supplies, or baggage.

JOSEPH HOOKER,

Major-General.

WASHINGTON, D. C., September 25, 1863.

Major-General SLOCUM,

Brandy Station:

Make such arrangements as will prevent any scattering of your command. I just learn that your artillery has been ordered to march to Alexandria. See to it that they are kept together and properly and promptly loaded. They ought not to march in. Colonel McCallum, railroad superintendent, will be at Manassas until the Eleventh Corps are embarked. It will cause great annoyance and delay to have any embarkation in large towns.

JOSEPH HOOKER,

Major-General, Commanding.

WASHINGTON, D. C., September 25, 1863.

Major-General HOWARD:

Dispatch of to-day received. You must not permit your men to leave unless they have room to be seated in the cars. Retain them in camp until more cars arrive in case there is a deficiency. Washington is no place to make transfers. It only requires attention to have the troops assigned to the places they are to retain on the march before leaving camp. Under no circumstances will they be permitted to ride on the roof of the cars. We must start right or we will be in confusion during the entire march.

JOSEPH HOOKER,

Major-General, Commanding.

WASHINGTON, September 25, 1863-1.40 p.m.

Captain ANDERSON,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

What are your latest advices from General Burnside, and where was he? I have nothing from his since the 21st.

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.

CINCINNATI, OHIO, September 25, 1863.

COMMANDING OFFICER,

Cumberland Gap:

Do you know anything about General Burnside's movements? When did you hear from him last, and where was he?

W. P. ANDERSON,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
