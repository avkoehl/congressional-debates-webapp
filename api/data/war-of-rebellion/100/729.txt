TORPEDO BUREAU.

Richmond, March 31, 1865.

Honorable J. C. BRECKINRIDGE,

Secretary of War:

SIR: I have the honor to report since my last, setting forth the success of our torpedoes in the destruction of the U. S. mail steamer Narcissa, in Mobile Harbor; that of the Patapsco, iron-clad, in Charleston Harbor, and of six vessels of the enemy in ascending the Roanoke River, N. C., that our torpedoes have destroyed in Cape Fear River, just below Fort Anderson, U. S. transport steamer Thorn on 4th instant. The vessel sunk, as usual in such cases, in two minutes, but in this the crew escaped, but barely with their lives. Also the destruction of Dahlgren's flag-ship Harvest Moon by a torpedo, near Gergetown, S. C., on the Pedee River. This torpedo was left there before our troops evacuated.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. J. RAINS,

Brigadier-General and Superintendent.
