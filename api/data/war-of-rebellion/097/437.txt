I can reach General Sheridan at Five Forks, but I could not have concentrated my command and have reached him before this hour [7.30 p.m.], consequently could only have joined him with between 300 and 400 men. I will report through a staff officer to General Sheridan and move as he directs.

Very respectfully,J. IRVIN GREGG,

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

General Hartsuff reports no discernible change in his front. I have tried everything here to ascertain any, and have found none or little. Is it certain that Mahone's division is in your front? You say that is so reported.

G. WEITZEL,

Major-General.
