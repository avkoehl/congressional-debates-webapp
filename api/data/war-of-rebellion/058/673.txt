OXFORD, February 4, 1864.

Brigadier-General CHALMERS:

Keep your scouts well out. If there is not more than a brigade of the enemy, and they attempt to cross at mouth of Coldwater, let them do so, secreting your force and attacking them in the bottom between the river and the hills. Leaving a regiment at Panola to guard, keep your command well in hand ready to move at a moment's notice, keeping four days' cooked rations on hand. Send all your extra baggage, tents, and surplus arms by railroad to Grenada. Have 40 rounds in cartridge-boxes and 40 in wagons if you can get it. Have ordered McGuirk back to you. If he has not reported send for him. Withdraw all your forces south of Tallahatchiee except small scouts.

N. B. FORREST,

Major-General.

Colonel R. MCCULLOCH,

Commanding Brigade:

COLONEL: The brigadier-general commanding directs me to inform you that scouts from the bottom report a brigade of the enemy's cavalry at Friar's Point, on the Mississippi River. He directs that you at once send a strong picket to the mouth of Coldwater and send forward a scouting party of 4 or 5 to ascertain the movements of any force that may advance from Friar's Point. Should they attempt to pass Coldwater you will attack and drive them back. The general also desires that you keep him advised of any hostile movement you may discover.

I am, colonel, yours, very respectfully,

H. C. YOUNG,

Acting Assistant Inspector-General.
