certainty to a great and protracted reduction m the
revenue, strengthened the propriety of the earliest
p acticable reduction of the public expenditures."
"The attention of every department of the Go-
vernment was immediately directed to that end,
and has been so continued to the present moment "
Let us test the correctness of this statemen t of ihe Pre-
dent by the prominent features of his administration
in the years 1837 and 1838, connected wiih the
public expendilures and finances. Between four
and five thousand troops were called or admitted
and continued in the service in Fbnda more than
the Commanding General recommended as useful
or necessarj; and, cons quently, upwards of two
millions and a half of dollars were expended in
that war in the course of that year, in aldition to
the four millions which bad been appropriated by
Congress before the new Administration com-
menced—thus making the whole expenditure for
that service in the year 1837 amount to seven and
a half millions of dollars. In December, 1837,
the Secretary of the Treasury included in his an-
nual estimates for the service of the year 1838
appropriations to the amount of su hundred and
sixty-tour thousand dollars for the const! uction of
roads, and one million and sixty-five thousand
dollars for the improvement of harbors rivers &c.
and Congress actually voted to both these cl?sscs
of objects upwards of a miluoi and a half of
dollars
For the services of the Florida war, m 1838
there were appropriated and expended upwards ot
six millions of dollars. In Decern b r, lv38, we find
the Secretary of the Treasury once moie presenting
his annual estimates of appropriation  for the ser-
vice of 1839, including the sum of five hundred and
eighty-seven thousand dollars for roads, and one
million seven hundred and thirteen thousand six
hundred and ninety dollars for harbors, rivers, &c.
I refer to the estimates of the Treasury in ihis
branch of the public expenditures to --how that the
President and his Secretary did not then consider
roads, hirbors, and rivers proper objects of retrench-
ment under the orders which he stales he gave to
the Departments m 1837, to carry out in good faith
ihe policy of "ihe earliest practicable reduction of
the public expenditure." In his annual message
of 1837, he stated that "it seemed proper in the
condition of the country, to have the estimates on
all subjects made as low is practicab'e, without
prejudice to any great public measure " "The
Departments were therefore directed to prepare ih 
estimates accordingly," and he was "happy to find
that they hai been able to graduate tnem on so
economical a scale." It is curious to trace the
progress of this new-born passion for economy in
its operation on the measures and re -ommrndat ions
of the President. We have seen that the estimates
and appropriations for roads, rivsr , and hirbors
for the service of the year 1838 (the first year over
the expendilures ot which, as the President states
in another part of his message, he had any control)
amounted to upwards ot a million and a half ct
dollars. In the same year "more than nx millions
were appropriated and ex( ended in the Florid 
war. It was also n the same year that, in pursu-
ance of the recommendation of ihe Pre ident, the
rank and file of the regular army was mcreased
from about eight to between twelve md thirteen thou-
sand men, thus imposing upon the country a new
ana' permanent charge of nearly a million of dollar
In the same year, and upon the express recommen-
dation cri the President, the staff of the army and
the ordnance corps wer« also reorganized and en-
larged, and foi ty-seven new officers added to the
military and topographical corps of engineers, in
order, chiefly, to secure a more effective superin-
tendence of works of internal improvement So
much for the reductioas effected by Mr Van Buren
and his economical Secretary in th" fitst two years
of the present Administraron
The Ptesident may with fome more propriety
advert to the reductions which have taken place
within the last two years; but let us sse what credit
he may properly take to himself on that «core At
the first session of Congress which followed the en-
largement of the military and topographical corps,
a majority of Congress rejected the entire estimates
¿"or works of that nature.   And in the next annual
message of the Prenden!, we find a conesponjmg
change m his toie and Un^iiaef with resird to re
trenchn ent and economy in bos message of De-
cember of 1839, 'ie inrorra  Confess lhat he had
"directed the es imates for 1840 to be subjected to
the severest scrutin),and to be limited to the abso-
lute requirements of the publu service" I will
net stop here to inquire how much below the pre-
scribed standard of 1840 the pabhc expenditures
can be pioperly reduced in order to sqaare with the
revenue m 1842 I will simply ask how it was
that m the fall of 1839 the neces-ny for reduced es-
timates and expenditures was so much moie impe-
rative thin it wasm 1837 We Mere borrowing
money and issuing Treasury note5 m 18^7, and
again m 1838, at the rate of ten millio is per en-
num Tht expenses, abo, of lbo Florida war,
were then kept at their maximrai Ii is apoaren',
therefore, whatever the Piesident may declare to
the contrary, that there was no serious effort to re-
duce the public expenditures within the two first
years of his Administration
Let us inquire inn thr* mtuf aid extent of the
reductions which have taken place m 1839 and
1840 The President m h s last Annual message
boasts (hat the expenditures of 1839 were reduced
s'i miPions be'ow those of 1838 That wa^ a
most wonderful performance, indeed How was it
brought about' In 1838, as we h?ve seen, there
were upwards of six millions expeodsd upon ihe
Florida war, and upon roads, rivers and harbors,
a million and a half In the >eir 1819, ihp-e were
expended in lh> Fion'i war m-emil ion ei^'it hun-
drtd thousand dollars only, and nron ¡"ids rt/e <*,
and harbors, nothing.it all, so that the difference
between lhese> two jIpois of expenditure in t e tno
jeais (1838 and 1839) comes withm three hund-cd
thousand dollars ot the whole saving m 1839, co
much vaun'ed ot by the Pris dent and his support-
ers The operation was effected simply bv reducing
the number of tioops in Honda in 1839, wi h >tu
any favorable chang* in the circumstitu *s of ihe
wir, and the xolins; down by Congress of aH the
appropriations included m ihe ans>u>l estimates for
internal improvements This may be statfd as tue
sum total of ihp Pipsi 'ent'  merits on this score "
But the President claims to hive redi'c d th 
expenditures of 1810 two or three mi'lton1- be'ow
those of 1839. Let u see ho v this may be so
counted for There wre appropr ved t r the ser-
vice of the Florida wir m 1819 one millón eight
hundred thousand dollars, as already stael, but
for the sime service n 1840 o.ily thre* hundred
thou and dollars Tub wojld makp a difF renee
in ihe expenses of the two years of a million and a
ha'f o( dollar . It now appeirs that htlf a mnl on
of do'lar-, were expended in tne- Fli-ida war in
'840, «Inch wis not provided form the apprrpni-
lions of that vear, am1 which, of course, v ¡>{ ,n-
creise the amount ol expenditure? fer that >e¡>r by
that sum The appropriations i r fonifloaiiii s and
the oidnance sen ice in the year 1839 vete ene
million one hundred and fifty two thousand doi'vs,
which we,? ne.<rlj all expended in that year, while
out of more than one million seven hundred thoj-
sind dollars appropriated to ihe same ODject, in
1840, not qui'e half a mi'l.on was expended m that
year There w\^, therefore, a difference m th' ex-
penditures of the two year-, upon these three ob-
ject alone, vi7 the Florid i war, fortifie?ti ins and
ordnance service, of upwards of two millions of
dollars
But, says the President m h s list menaje, the
expenditures in 1840 will appear to be mm or ten
millions less than hose of 1837 Let us seo how
this was effected, and what eredit the Presid-nt can
justly claim on that account. The expenditures
for Ihe Florida war in 1837, as has a'rea^y been
slated, amounted to seven and a half «vllions of
dollars. Upon roads, rivers, harbors, ¡fee and upon
new light houses, ihe pub'ic documents wi 1 show
an expenditure m that ) ear of thre  mill on two
hundred and nmety-six thousand dol ars, making
together the sum often million « ven 1 ondied an i
ninety-six thousand dolhrs. The expenditures up-
on similar objec s m 1840 did not exceed the sum
of eight hundred thousand dollars, and this was
conined to the Florida war alone. Thus is the
extraordinary difference between the expenditure
of 1837 and of 1840 fully accounted for, simply by
the eu'tailtriestof toe expenses of thf Funda war,
and the refusal of Congreso to make Rrty a propn-
ations foi mlcrnil improvements oí any kind The
only retrenchment worth notice, therefore, in what
has been considered, for the last twelve years, the
ordinary and current expenditures of the Govern-
ment, has been the withholding of all appropna-
t ons for the Cumberland road, for the improve-
ment of the great navigable rivers, the harbors up-
on ihe Atlantic and Lake frontier, and the building
of new lu'ii houses for the convenience and «afety
of commerc- The next most cc nsiderablo re-
tienchments have been effected m the expenditures
upon ihe rivy, fe firt.fioaticns and o her esta-
blishments conn c ed wi h the public defences—the
mo=' d'«erving, the most suffíring, and the most
important of «11 objects of public expenditure. All
other retrenchments, e picially uch as looked to
the reduction of < ffices an i agencies, or the erar la-
ments connected wi n them, have not exceeded fi'ty
thousand dollar , nor do I kno v that so mu^h has
been retrenched in that branch ef the public expen-
diture
It would be easy to demonstrate from the Execu-
tive documents that the cy tern of retrenchment,
meagre as i was, entered upon two jer.is ?go, in
respect to ihe Navy, the Ordnance < epartment, and
ihe defences of the frontiers, Atlantic, Lake, and
interior AVcstern, has b en ca.ned into execution
m opposition to the earnest remonstrances of every
scientific and patriotic seivantof the public, bolh
military pt>d naval, that af'ir ihe engireers *uper-
ir'erd nc, ihe works in prtgress for ihe public de-
fence h'd rut down t1 eir estimates to the lowest

wor«ts to pr vent di'apulalion, Ih; Heads of De-
partments aclu illy ¡educed Ihem still lotser, in
order to comply win their rrb trary standard of
expediency and eeonom). In December, 1839,
when the chief of tb  engineer corps demanded
ene million, one bun4red anl n net - lght thou-
sand dolía s for fortification^, to be expended in
1840, is the least that the public service would
adroit, c nsis ently with the idea of sensible pro-
gre supon lh^ works deemed most essential to the
safety oí our option' cities and other cpo^ed points
