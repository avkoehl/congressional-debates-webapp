Major General JOHN A. LOGAN,

Commanding Fifteenth Army Corps:

GENERAL: The general has been requested to move four divisions in light marching order on the upper road, that the Left Wing may be supported if necessary. You will therefore encamp your corps to the left or rear of General Blair instead of on the right, as heretofore ordered, and be ready to move forward on the upper road. You will move three of your divisions with only ttheir headquarters and regimental trains, and ten ammunition wagons for each division with five days' supplies, two of which will be carried in the regimental wagons. The supply trains and the remainder of the ordnance train will be consolidated, and move in rear of this column, and the other division move as a guard for the train. This division will not be relieved during the march to Faison's Depot. A small portion of our headquarters train will move with your column. General Blair has been directed to move via Clinton. The pontoon train and surplus wagons from these headquarters will follow him. The order of march will be issued to-morrow.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

A. M. VAN DYKE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

P. S. - Please cross two of your divisions by Slocum's bridge as soon as it is free to you to-morrow.

Please send a sufficient force to the bridge on that road to support the details now absent from the command, should they become engaged with the enemy, and facilitate their return to camp. I send you the man who makes the report.
