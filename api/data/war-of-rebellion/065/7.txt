through the country by General Birney had all been brought in without loss. One hundred and fifty bales of cotton captured by General Birney had been brought in. There will be some trouble about the cattle reported by him as captured. A large portion of them are claimed as the property of loyal citizens. Justice will be done both the Government and the citizens. An examination of brands and other marks is being made.

HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE SOUTH,Hilton Head, S. C., May 23, 1864.

COLONEL: A report from General Schimmelfennig, commanding Northern District of this department, arrives just as the steamer is about sailing. He considers the bombardment of Sumter as having rendered completely useless the guns lately put in position in that fort. he also believes that the force of the enemy has been considerably reduced within two days, although the force felt under my command was reduced to a purely defensive force. I shall endeavor to take advantage of the present opportunity should I find that the enemy are sufficiently weakened to enable me to do so with a reasonable prospect of success.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JNO. P. HATCH,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE SOUTH,Hilton Head, S. C., May 26, 1864.

GENERAL: I have the honor to report my arrival and the assumption of command to-day. An expedition has been sent out by General Hatch, consisting of about 2,000 men, under Brigadier General W. Birney, having for object the destruction of the railroad bridges over the South Edisto and Ashepoo Rivers, and the long trestle-work over the swamp lying between those two rivers. This expedition was expected to land near the mouth of Mosquito Creek, on the Ashepoo River, last night, and to march to the railroad and perform its work to-day. I propose to visit the whole department on a tour of inspection, and to make a report to you afterward of its condition and wants.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. G. FOSTER,

Major-General, Commanding.
