,-iThenL?uiSmIIe* Cxncin«ati, St Louis, Nashville, Evans-
villc, Cairo, 1 ennessee rivei, Pittsburg, and all the boats
on the tributaries of the uppex Mississippi river that run to
New O)loans, invanably stop at Memphis on their dowji-
wairi ami upward trips, making upwards of three thousand
ai rivals and departures annually at Memphis, exclusive of
the regular packets above named.
A groat many of Hip regular packcts enumerated in the
foregoing schedule lay up at Memphis everv summer be-
sides others which lay up not in the regular trade. ?
I think, i.ir, that th  above, although by no moans a full
and-perfect schedule of the amount of business of this char-
acter transacted at the port of Memphis, is sufficient to
satisfy any one of the great necessity of an inspection dis-
tiict at the city of Memphis.
All which is respectfully submitted.
Very respectfully, ' W. T. AVERY.
Hon. E. S. Wasijburne,
1 trust 1 have explained the bill to the satisfac-
tion of the gentleman from Georgia.
Mr. CRAWFORD. I suppose the gentleman
has forgotten to state the amount of increased
expenditure to the Government under the bill.
Mr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois. There are
four new boards of inspectors created.
Mr. CLARK, of New York. Five.
Mr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois. No, sir,
four; at Memphis, Paducah, Oregon, and Galena.
Mr. CLARK, of New York. And two assist-
ants at New York.
Mr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois. I have al-
ready stated that. They do not constitute a new
board, but are assistants in New York to take
the place of the two inspectors who acted under
the law of 1838, upon the appointment of the dis-
trict judge. They have no relation whatever to
that part of the act about which I am now speak -
ing. The salary of these officers is: for those at
Oregon City, Oregon, $1200; and for those at
Galena, Memphis, and Paducah, §600. It will be
seen that the expenditureforthem'allisnotalarge
sum.
I will make a remark or two in relation to the
increased expense. The gentleman from New
York [Mr. Clark] says that he has a statement.
I am aware with how much force a man can get
up here and talk about the creation of new offices.
I am aware how susceptible the House may be to
an argument of that kind. Now, sir, I have made
a calculation on the subject, and by that calcula-
tion the increased expense under this bill over the
law as it exists is $237. That is, by allowing
the fees exacted for the inspection of boats, now
for the first time brought under the law, I believe
experience will show that the additional amount
coming into the Treasury will pay all the addi-
tional salaries. Indeed, I hardly believe that it
amounts to that. The Government pays these
officers their salaries, but it does not pay them
large salaries. These supervising inspectors are
the best men in the country, of high character
and great experience; men coming from all parts
of the country, and who understand their business. 1
And what salary do you think is allowed a super- i
vising inspector? The pitiful sum of $1,500 per ;
annum. Many of them are retired ship-owners,
or steamboat-owners, or captains, who take an !
interest in this matter. I will refer to one man :
from Kentucky, known to all the members from !
Kentucky—Captain Schaileross—who informed I
me that he had run steamboats upon the Missis-
sippi and its tributaries for thirty-five years, and :
had never lost a life, nor to an insurance company :
a dollar. Hq belongs to the class ofmcn-who have !
charge of this law, and who are endeavoring to !
carry out its provisions. ' j
Mr. CRAWFORD. Do I understand the gen- '!
tleman from Illinois to say that the expense to
the Government, under this bill, will not exceed
that under the law of 1R52 more than <5237'
Mr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois. I made a cal-
culation of the comparative cost, and that was the
result of my comparison. I was going on to say
that this bill provides for the payment of fees
which go into the Treasury; and the salaries of
the officers are paid oat of the Treasury. If the
gentleman from Georgia will look over the whole
subject, he will find that there never has been a
law upon our statute-book of so great use, "which
has been carried out at so slight an expense.
Mr. CRAWFORD. Let me say to the gentle-
man that, by taking the act of 1852 and compar-
ing it with the present bill, and adding the cost of
the new inspectors who are to he selected, he will
find the expense increased over twenty thousand
dollars per annum.
Mr. WASHBUPiNE, of Illinois. The gentle-
man is mistaken, and I will tell him why: there I
will be a very large amount accruing under this >
law for the inspection of ferry-boats, tow-boats, !
and freight-boats, which now goes into the pockets i
of the inspectors, but will hereafter go, if this bill
is passed, into the Treasury.
Mr. CRAWFORD. The gentleman will al- ;
low me to ask him a question touching this mat- ;
ter. I desire to know if he is aware of the amount
of money which is collected by the inspectorsand '
paid into the Treasury, and of the amount paid !
out of the Treasury? <
Mr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois. 1 have that '
statement at my room, and will bring it here and :
show it to the House. I tell the gentleman I have
no concealment about this matter. I desire to mis-
lead no man. If it be an objection to this bill that
it increases the expense a few hundred dollars, or
a few thousand dollars, why, gentlemen mjift
make the most of it. While I believe that in fact
the execution of the law under' this MI will not
cost the Government an additional dollar, yet iflt
did, when we take into consideration the object^
accomplished by the bill, it is bilt as dust in 'the
balance. • '
Wlien the gentleman from Georgia interrupted
me, I was going on to speak in reference to tMe
matter of carrying lights. I was saying, as a mat-
ter of course, being no sailor, but only a "land
lubber, I knew and could know nothing practi-
cally of the matter. But men of great experience,
seafaring men—experts we might call them—con-
sulting with the supervising inspectors,have agreed
in relation to a system of carrying lights, Which
I believe is satisfactory to the men who are en-
gaged in navigation. It is a matter of very great
importance that all vessels should be bound by law
to carry its lights, and that we should provide a
system of lights to be carried by them. In that
respect I believe, frdm all the knowledge and all
the information I can get, that the provisions of
this bill are entirely satisfactory to those to whom
it will apply.
_ The subject of carrying lights for the jirbtec-
tion of life and property, is no new subject; font
England and France have legislated in regard to
it. This leads me to speak of some objections
made to this bill, so far as it relates to the dis-
cretion which is invested in these supervising in-
spectors and local inspectors. The laws of Eng-
land confer a discretion far more extensive than
that bestowed by this law. There they do not
provide by law what the lights shall be; but leave
that matter to be regulated by a board conform-
ing to our supervising inspectors—"the lords
commissioners for carrying out the marine act
of 3850." Those men prescribe what the lig-hts
shall be.
But the subject of carrying lights has not only
been pro vided for by British law, but by the French
law, which I hold in my hand. They provide
for carrying lights for the protection of lives arid
property. In the reportofthe Minister of Marine,
made in 1848, he says, (I translate from the Journal
dxi Palais:)
" Navigators of all nations have sought for a long time
the means of preventing, during the night, the collision of
steamships, and to pievent accidents which are the con-
sequence ot these disasters. The differentsvstcms of lights
and signals admitted to be in operation, even at this day,
are not fully of that'extent which might be desired."
Therefore it will be seen that our country, in
providing for this system of lights, is but follow-
ing the example set us by the French and English
nations.
Now, I wish to state, in reference to this bill,
that there may be some amendments which gen-
tlemen may think, and which the House may
think, proper to be adopted, but I trust that no
gentleman who is not desirous of killing the bill
at the outset will vote to refer it to the Committee
of the Whole on the state of the Union; because
I propose, if there are any amendments which I
believe are required and demanded by a majority
of the House, to put them into a substitute and
have the substitute adopted in the place of my
original bill. I am aware that some objections
were made to this bill at the last session upon
constitutional grounds. In reply to that, 1 have
only to say that this bill goes no further in any
direction than the bills of 1838 and 1852. If this
bill has initany unconstitutional provisions, both
those bills had them; and, sir, one of those laws
has been in operation for twenty-two years, and
its constitutionality has never been challenged in
any court of justice, and, so far as I am aware,
the question has never been raised.
I do not propose at this time to call the previ-
ous question. If any gentleman has objection to
the bill and desires any information I possess, I
shall be pleased to give it to him to the extent of
my ability.
Mr. TAYLOR. The subject before the House
is one of as great importance as can engage the
attention of the Representatives of the American
people. The object aimed at by the bill under
consideration, is to throw additional safeguards
around the lives of citizens who arc compelled to
have recourse to the different methods of trans-
portation by steam upon the navigable waters of
