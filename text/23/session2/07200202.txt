to
LOUISVILLE A!\D PORTLAND CANAL.
Mr POPE rose to submit a motion, which he
said he did with great reluctance It was a mo-
tion in which thirteen States of the Union were
deeply interested He alluded to the bill in tela
tion to the Louisville and Portland canal He
moved to postpone all the orders of the day pie-

Committee of the Whole on the state of the
Union upon it.
A count having been called %>on the motion,

of Pensions   which was agreed to
Mr WATMOUGH lose to a question of order
He desired to   know  whether  a  bare majority
could set aside the usual and regular routine of

The SPEAKER remarked that this was the

was sufficient

of J,G51,800 be, and the ssme is hereby, appropn
sted (out of any money in theTieabury notother
wise appropriated) for the purpose afoiesaid
Mr.POPEsaid Mi Chairman, I feel profoundly
grateful to honorable gentlemen foi their kindness
in consenting to postpone the orders of the day to
take up the bill under consideration I will requite
their courtesy by being very brief I should not
sty a word, sir, but that the bill before the com-
mitiee is a highly impottant one It involves the
interests of the inhabitants of an immense region,
and is entitled to the grave and respectful con
sideration of this body AH the citizens of the
transmontane Slates, in greater or less degree, are
interested in its fate, and they expect us to legis
late upon the subject in a liueial, enlightened, and
national spirit In numerous memorials which
have been presented, they invoke the interposition
of the National Legislature to disembarrass their
tiade of burthens as injurious as they are un-
righteous    They tell you that their industry and
enterprise are shackled by unwonted taxation—
that their legitimite gains aie subjected to the ex
action of ac irporation almost wholly irresponsible,
and they earnestly and respectfully call upon Con
gress for relief    Sir, they have a deep stake in
this matter    Tneu rights, their m'eiests, then
feelings, are all mvohed    Blessed with more than
plenty, they aie yet debaired a fiee and nghtful
highway to a ready market     Their surplus pro
ductions must either rot on their hands, or in tl en
transit to market be fixed almost at the will of a
licensed corporation—a corpoiation most nnprov
idently clothed with extraordmaiy  poweis, and
possessed of thft pernicious gift, perpetual  exist-
ence     Let me not be told, sir, that these foimi
dable powers were de-ived  from an act of the
Legislature of my own State    This fact does not
render them less exceptionable    The motives of
tnose who passed the act of incorporation were
pure and  praiseworthy     They intended to do
good, although  they acted  unwisely     111  their
anxiety to  furnish facilities to the navigation of
the Ohio  river they went too fai      They were
apprized of the difficulties and perils which the
falls of the Ohio presented to the navigator, and
they, theiefort, incorporated a company to con
struct the Louisville and Portlard canal     They
weie aware that there was no surplus local capital,
and it was to tempt the employment of foieign
means m the undertaking that the act complained
of was passed     Be that as it may, the ev 1 is un
questionably inflicted, and it is now the part of
wisdom and duty to adopt the best, and I may
say the only, mode of coirecting the error
Mr Chairman, if it be a part of the settled
policy of this country that objects \ urcly, essen
tially, and confessedly national, shall receive the
favorable consideiation of the Government, the
one now under discussion is most eminently enti
tied to it Recollect, sn, that it is the busy, the
enterprising, and increasing thousands of an im-
mense extent of country, who demand relief—of
a dis'pict of country which stretches from clime
to clime, comprehending with n its circuit parts
of the States of New York, Pennsylvania, Mary
land, Vnginia, and the whole of Ohio, Kentucky ,
Indiana, Illinois, Missouri, Tennessee, Alabama,
Mississippi, and Louisiina, and ihe 1 emtory of
Aikansas—of an extent of co miry which includes
within Us sweep the " Gi eat Father of Rivers"
himself, and all his beautiful, unrivalled, and mag
nificent tributaries Sir, as the " King of floods "
rolls his rushing and turbid waters to the deep, he
bears upon his bosom the surplus pioducttons of
all these States and many more, much of which
find a way thiou{,h the Louisville and Portland
canal Fiom its mountain sources to its mouth,
the Ohio flows freighted with the exportations of
New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Vn-
ginia, which States receive in return, by the same
communication, the valuable and increasing agri
cultural and mineral productions of the fai South
and West Whatobject then, sn,let me inqune,
is more national than theone under consideration '
Throughout this wide spread, far-reaching land,
can any one be designated in which so many
States and so many people aie so deeply inter
ested ? Sir, there can be but one answer to thebe
questions
Mr  Chairman, the value of tb.e annual com
merce of the Ohio river is estimated by the com-
mittee that reported this  bill at five millions of
dollars     Recent information and íelection have
satisfied me that this est mate is too low     ! have
been ciedibly informed that, during the yeai 1833,
there was fieighted from the city of Cincinnati,
pioduce of the value of four millions     If this in
formation be con eat, we may safely put down the
value of the annual conmerce of the Ohio river at
this time at ten millions     This immense amount, i
su, ought to be sufficient to arrest the atten ion I
and enlist the feelings and judgment of Congress
in favor of the bill      But if it be not sufficient, let I
■us look into the futme, and behold if we can the I
events which time will leieal—let us bole onward
to the period when the forests of the "West sha 1 i
disappear before the axe of the emigrant, when
its valleys and its hill tops shall be peopled with
laborious millions—when  its mighty nveis shall
be dotted, and enlivened, and variegated with val
uable and beautiful gardens, and farms, and man-%
ufactoues, and villages, and towns, and splendid
cities—when magnificent s'eamers, rever out cf
vie , shall, " rej nemg as the} go," bear ciT the
surplus products of Ub boil, ai d let us, irqi ie if
its population will not have a right *hcn to  «um
a bolder tone, a d to demand horn the Felei.,1
Government a dispersal on of benef s ai d en
couragem^nt great as those gianteu to noie
favoied portions of the country Sir, do I make
a wild, unreal, visionaiy pieuiction, wl en I say
that this proud day of j rjspenty „ not distant'
I wi 1 not pietend to foietell the mighty destinies
of the valley of the Missisei) pi, or to portray the
world that is there leaping into existence But if
the lessons afforded by the history of the past
give us any right to found calculations upon the
future, the lapse of less than ntty yeais will pie-
sent the In it g, moving, and wondious specttcle
which I have depicted Porty five years ago the
territory which is now the State of Ohio was a
wildelness Natuie theie reposed in primeval
and unmvaded grandeui, save only when it was
distuibed by the piowhn s of the wild bea t, and,
the roaming footbteps of the savage Now it
numbers and sustains more than a million of in
habí ants, ranks the tlnd State in the Union, ai d
is still hurrying onwaid in her brig1 t career
In 1817, Mr Chairman, when steamboats began
to obtain general u^e on the western watei*., the
commerce between Pittsburg and New Oileans
employed about twenty barges, and me bundled
keel boats, geneially of small dimensn n„ and
cap.city I know not the number now en ployed
in the exclusive trade of those two citieb, but 1 do
know that the whole trade of the Ohio ai d Mis-
sissippi, and their tnbutaneb, gives employment
to about three hundred steamboats, and more than
two thousand fl it and keel boats As population
increases in the West its commerce must n c ease
and no matter how much it may augment, it mubt
enduie afl oppiessive aid perpetual tax, unless
Congress shall see proper to remove it Sn , the
inhabitants of that region feel and know tl is
They see that their industry and trade are sub
jeued to a most oneious impost, wh le that of
other portions of the Confederacy is en ¡rely freed
fiom it They see hat obstructions to tl e navi-
gation of eastern and northern rivers, inconsider-
able when compared with the Ohio, have been
removed entnely at the pxpense of the Genetal
Government, and no loca' tax imposed on tho< e
who profited by it They spe that a Delawaie
bieakwatei has been cinstructed at the common
expense, and Philadelphia and the suiiounding
country paying no local charges theiefor They
know thu large sums aie annually appropriated
by Corgre«s to construct and improve harbors
a'ong the sea coa^t and the lakes, to plant buoys,
build and support light houses, and no 'ocal tax
paid by those who gam by the expenditme Sir,
they do not cavil abouf or com pi Tin of thfetl mgcj,
but they «ay tha* the ohjpct rf tnis bill is more
national than any or all of these They thml that
these acts of favor to our noitl em and eastein
brethien, give them a r ght to claim something
from the bounty and liberality of their Govern
ment They tell you thatthe Falls of the Ohio con-
stituted an obstructic n to the navigation of a river,
in the removal of which thirteen States weie
duectly mteieoted, and seveial others indirectly
interested— hat the obstruction was only about
two miles in lergth,and shou d nave been lemoved
asm sll similar mitinees, at the expense of the
Generil Government—that it «as done (>r lather
avoided) bya privatecoiporation acting under the
autl oruy of acnarter most incautiously gianted—
that the corporation has a ri^ht, and will, in pro-
cess of time, le^y upon then commerce (for who
can set bounds to human ct p dity ) an annual tax
of at least one hundied and f fty thousand dollars
—that undei most disadvp l'ageous < ir< umstar ces,
the company received in the y ai 1833, fiom tolls,
the sum of £G0,73G 92—tlatthis lux is a vam¡ ue
which is fattening upon then eneigies—that their
trade cirnot we 1 sustain it—tl at it is an unac
Cus omed and perpetual imposi ion—and they
earnestly call upon Congress for relief Sir, let
me add my feeble voice to theirs in this appeal
Let me invoke this body to give a friendly ear to
then complaints Look, sir, at the list appended
to the report of the Corr mittee on Reads and
Canals, ard you will find that some of the steam-
boats are compelled to pay as much as pSO foi a
