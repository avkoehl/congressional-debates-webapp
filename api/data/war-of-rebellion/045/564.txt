By command of Major-General Stahel:*

H. BALDWIN, JR.,

Major, and Assistant Adjutant-General.

FREDERICK, MD., July 6, 1863. (Received 8. 20 a. m.)

Major-General HALLECK:

The river is high, and cannot be forded at Shepherdstown or Williamsport. The enemy is sending his wounded across in flats.

WM. H. FRENCH,

Major-General.

WASHINGTON, July 6, 1863-1 a. m.

General S. WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Army of the Potomac:

Dispatch just received. I have not one-third enough land transportation for two bridges at Harper's Ferry. Will start as soon as it can be furnished by the quartermaster, if the canal is not repaired. I was informed to-day that the Quartermaster's Department was repairing canal. If likely to be finished in time, I will have two bridges in the locks as early as practicable to make them up from boats on hand here.

H. W. BENHAM,

Brigadier-General.

WASHINGTON NAVY-YARD, July 6, 1863-1. 30 a. m.

(Sent from War Department, 10. 15 a. m.)

General S. WILLIAMS,

Headquarters Army of the Potomac:

I have not enough land transportation for two bridges at Harper's Ferry. Will start one then the other as soon as arrivals can be sent from Quartermaster's Department, if the canal is not repaired, so that they can reach there earlier by that route. Was told to-day that it was under repairs by Quartermaster's Department. If likely to be finished in time, I will have two bridges in the canal as early as practicable to make them up from boats here. It appears impossible to get them as far as Poolesville to-day by land.

H. W. BENHAM,

Brigadier-General.
