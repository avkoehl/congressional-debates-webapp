Brigadier-General COX,

Commanding Third Division:

GENERAL: The signal officer reports our pickets driven back from forty rods on the right to half a mile on the left. Do not permit this; strengthen your line and drive the enemy back. I will be on the line soon.

Respectfully,

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.
HDQRS. THIRD DIVISION, TWENTY-THIRD ARMY CORPS,Nashville, December 9, 1864.

Major-General SCHOFIELD,

Commanding Army of the Ohio:

GENERAL: In reply to your note of this date, I have the honor to report that on yesterday I myself called on General Kimball at his headquarters in regard to the picket-line, and went with his assistant inspector-general to the line on the Franklin pike, and there agreed with him as to the proper place for it, my own line being then upon it. Subsequently my inspector, Major Dow, met General Kimball himself at the same place, and General K. expressed himself satisfied with the connection. I therefore do not understand the report to which you refer. My line was over a mile from my works, and I did not regard it necessary or best to keep it out so far, as it was at all times liable to capture, unless a far larger part of the whole command was put upon picket than is usual. I will, of course, place is at any position you may indicate, but have no report of its being driven back to-day.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. D. COX,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
