FOURTH PERIOD

On the 1st of September I went into Washington, where I had an interview with the General in Chief, who instructed me verbally to take command of its defenses, expressly limiting my jurisdiction to the works and their garrisons, and prohibiting me from exercising any control over the troops actively engaged in front under General Pope. During this interview I suggested to the General in Chief the necessity of his going in person or sending one of his personal staff to the army under General Pope for the purpose of ascertaining the exact condition of affairs. He sent Colonel Kelton, his assistant adjutant-general.

During the afternoon of the same day I received a message from the General in Chief to the effect that he desired me to go at once to his house to see the President.
