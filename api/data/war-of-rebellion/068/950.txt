large number of negroes; has been detained eight or nine days in crossing the Potomac, but heard nothing of Burnside's moving from Annapolis to the front. It is reported here that Sigel is at Strasburg with a heavy force. His force while at Winchester is estimated by citizens at 9,000. Mr. Webb reports 60,000 men under General Hooker at Harper's Ferry. I will send you something definite to-morrow or next day by young Crane. Two other members of the Maryland cavalry (Colonel Johnson) have just come up; one has been to Washington, and one to Philadelphia. They promise to go immediately to your headquarters, and can give you much valuable information.

In great haste, your obedient servant,

THOMAS D. RANSOM.

Crane leaves Luray for your headquarters this morning.
