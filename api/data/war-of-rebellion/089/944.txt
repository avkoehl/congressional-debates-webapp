HEADQUARTERS TWENTY-FOURTH ARMY CORPS,December 10, 1864- 9.05 p.m.

Brigadier-General TURNER:

I make the following dispositions: Heckman's 600 go to the Deep bottom line to relieve a corresponding or less number of Jourdan's troops, which, with Spear's men dismounted, will garrison the line connecting the Deep Bottom line with Camp Holly. Henry's brigade is assigned to the defense of the space between Camp Holly and Signal Hill. Two of the guns sent to me by Heckman will be placed in the redoubt in the line from Camp Holly to Deep Bottom; the remaining four guns will be placed in reserve near Kautz's headquarters. At 5 o'clock I intend to move Voris down the New Market road, until the head of his column reaches the ravine redoubt.

Since I commenced writing this I have received a report that a deserter has come in from the Palmetto Sharpshooters, of Kershaw's division, who says that the enemy are now retiring; that they had three divisions and were 15,000 strong. This, of course, must be an overestimate. His report is corroborated by one from Colonel McArthur, at Camp Holly, who has pushed his pickets out to the second house in front of his works without meeting opposition. This deserter has not yet arrived here.

Brevet Major-General.

Brigadier-General DEVENS,

Commanding Third Division:

GENERAL: General Ord has instructed me to have the troops under arms at 5 o'clock to-morrow morning, to remain ready to move until after sunrise. He also wishes to have all the wagons hitched up and ready to move at the same hour. Will you be so good as to see that these instructions are carried out in your division.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

ALF. H. TERRY,

Brevet Major-General.
