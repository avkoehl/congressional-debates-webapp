APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
[May 20,
Ho. of Reps.
Mines and Mining—Mr. Kendall.
42d Cons....2d Sess.
This tunnel, if completed, will beyond ques-
tion produce two most remarkable and eco-
nomical results. By means of it the mines
along the Comstoek lode can be worked at a
depth of over four thousand feet, and the im-
mense wealth therein contained brought to
the aid of commerce and trade and to the
exchanges of the country and of the world.
It would besides encourage a rational system
of mining, and induce the investment of private
capital in similar undertakings throughout all
our mining region. Our mining operations
would then lose to a great extent their present
speculative character and become a regular
business, based upon definite and certain re-
sults,—as much so as the production of coal and
iron in Pennsylvania.
The scientific value of this work as a prac-
tical geological survey and exploration alone
would justify the loan from the Government
that is asked in aid of the work. If it were
once demonstrated that our mineral lodes ex-
tend to an indefinite depth and that the lower-
grade ores can be utilized, it would give to all
this mineral domain which I have described
a value beyoud computation.
In order to effect these great objects a bill
has been carefully perfected by the Com-
mittee on Mines and Mining, and which will
be reported for the consideration of this
House. The preamble to the bill sets forth
the following postulates: That our public lands
contain mines of the precious metals which
are unsurpassed in extent, and can with
proper development be made speedily to en-
hance the value of all property, and thereby
relieve the burdens of the people ; that a wise
policy indicates that the revenue derived from
our mineral lands should to some extent
be devoted again to the much-needed de-
velopment of this important interest; that
Congress, by an act approved July 25, 1866,
authorized the construction of a draining and
exploring tunnel to the Comstoek lode, in the
State of Nevada, and granted to Adolph Sutro
certain rights and privileges, which have been
assigned, transferred, and set over to a corpo-
ration duly organized under the laws of the
State of California and known as the " Sutro
Tunnel Company;" that great benefits will
accrue to the people of the United States from
the construction of said tunnel, which, as a
great geological survey, penetrating into an
> argentiferous mountain to a greater depth than
has yet been reached by any similar work in
the world, will establish the value of our min-
eral domain 5 that the principal wealth of our
mineral regions consists in low-grade ores,
which can only be utilized by means of im-
proved reduction, concentration, and smelting
works, for the erection of which extraordinary
facilities exist at the mouth of said tunnel;
that this work bears a national character,
and its magnitude is beyond the capacity of
private enterprise, and that the security offered
to the Government is ample for the repayment
of any sums to be advanced under this act.
The bill then provides, not for a subsidy,
not for a gift either in money or lands or in
aught else, but simply for a loan from the
Government, for the repayment of which,
principal and interest, the amplest and most
perfect security is given. And more: as a
condition of this loan, not to exceed $2,000,000,
this company are bound to expend on this
great work at least an equal amount. The
total cost of the tunnel will not fall short of
$1,000,000. And still more: the last $500,-
000 of the proposed loan is to be withheld
until the company shall have erected reduc-
tion, concentration, and smelting works 011
the most approved plan, and to cost not less
than said sum so withheld. One half of all
the income derived from the tunnel is set
apart to the payment of the loan; and in de-
fault of payment within a stipulated time, of
principal and interest, the Government is to
declare the rights of the company under the
act forfeited and their possession and control
of the property terminated.
These are some of the main features of the
bill. I claim that it is as complete and perfect
in all its parts for the protection of the rights
and interests of the Government as it is pos-
sible to be made. And what more could the
most cautious and watchful guardian of the
Treasury desire ? I repeat that the mining in-
terest of all that region I have referred to,
and which is involved in this great enterprise,
comes not in this bill before Congress begging
for gifts or "subsidies." All I ask is a care-
ful examination and consideration of what is
proposed. It is a loan with the best security
for speedy repayment. It is some small aid
by the Government to a work too great for
unassisted private means. It is the conserva-
tion and development of the great mineral
wealth which belongs to the whole people. It
is some encouragement to the leading indus-
try of that West which has more than once
saved 'the country from financial ruin ; an in-
dustry that is to us what commerce and agri-
culture and manufactures are to my friends
from New England, New York, and Penn-
sylvania, and from the valleys of the Missis-
sippi and the Qhio.
Mr. Speaker, in the first session of this Con-
gress I had the honor to present to the House
certain resolutions then just passed by the
Legislature of my State, as follows:
Resolution of the Legislature of Nevada relative to
the establishment ofreduetion works by the United
States.
To the honorable the Senate and House of Represent-
atives of the United State* ;
Your memorialists, the Legislature of the State of
Nevada, most, respectfully represent that there is
between the Roeky mountains and the Pacific ocean
a great number of mines yielding gold, silver, lead,
and many other metals that are valuable and indis-
pensable to the various industries of the world ; and
that in the most perfect and practicable establish-
ment for the reduction of said ores, now in operation
in said region, a large percentage of the gold, silver,
and lead, and nearly the whole of other base metals,
are lostor destroyed; thecharacter ofsaid reduction
works being such that those metals cannot be saved,
and that a very great number of mines of great
wealth are already discovered in the State of Ne-
vada and in other localities accessible to the Central
Pacific railroad, whose ores are now either left to lie
in the mine, awaiting improved facilities forreduc-
tion, or worked at a great loss of valuable metals,
by present imperfect methods, or shipped to Europe,
where those processes are so perfect as to save nearly
all that is valuable in said ores; and that the erec-
tion of such works as are necessary for the perfect
and economical reduction of said ores will be so
expensive that in this, as in other countries, the as-
sistance of the Government will be found necessary
for the inauguration of the enterprise ; and that the
establishment of ^uch reduction works at some ac-
cessible point in the great basin, west of the Roeky
mountains, would be of incalculable benefit by
saving to the people of the United States the money
now paid for transportation to and the reduction of
said ores in foreign countries, by making valuable
a vast number of mines now idle, and giving a new
impetus to base-metal mining, by giving employ-
ment to thousands of additional laborers, and by
largely increasing the development of the mineral
wealth of tbeUnited States ; and your memorialists
would further represent that it is their opinion the
proceeds of the sales of mineral lands could be
appropriated to no purpose so conducive to public
welfare as the establishment of this enterprise to
encourage mining.
Thereiore they pray your honorable body to set
apart all tbe moneys arising from the sales of mineral
lands, under such conditions as your honorable body
may deem fit, for the purposes hereinbefore set forth ;
and that reduction works similar in character to
those in Swansea, England, or of such character as
modern scientific discoveries may suggest, shall he
established at some point 011 or near the Central
Pacific railroad most accessible to the mines of our
region.
Resolved by the senate, (the assembly concurring,)
xhatour Senators aremstructed, and our Represent-
ative in Congress is requested, to use their utmost
endeavors to secure the passage of a law that will
accomplishtheobjectssetforthin thememorial; and
Resolved further, That the Governor be requested
to forward a copy of this memorial and resolution
to each of our Senators and to our Representative
in Congress, asking their early attention to the
subject.
Passed February 27,1871.
The bill under consideration, as I have said,
provides for the erection of these works.
At a previous session of the Nevada Legis-
lature the following joint memorial and reso-
lutions which I have here before me, were
Joint memorial and resolutions of the Legislature
of Nevada asking Government aid in the construc-
tion of the Sutro tunnel.
Whereas the State of Nevada contains within its
borders a silver vein called the Comstoek lode; and
whereas a deep drainage and exploring tunnel,
leading into said lode, is necessary to its permanent
yield of the precious metals; and whereas the char-
acter of said lode is now demonstrated to be such as
to give ample security to the capital necessary to be
advanced for its construction; and whereas the fol-
lowing facts in connection with the foregoing are
of weighty consideration: that the mines of said
lode have been worked for seven years last past, and
during this time have produced $64,000,000; that the
present annual yield is $16,000,000,an amount equal to
the total annual product of the republic of Mexico;
that the expense of working these mines so rapidly
increases with the increaseddepth, that the $16,000.-
000 were last year realized at a cost of $15,500,000;
and, at the present ratio of cost to production, their
resources would, in a few years, be wholly absorbed,
and the mines practically abandoned; that the causes
of increased cost are, among others, the accumula-
tion of water in the mines, insufficient ventilation,
and the increase of heat with depth ; and that now,
having reached a depth of eight hundred feet, these
combined causes will prevent their being worked
profitably, 011 the present plan, below twelve hun-
dred feet; that the Comstoek lode is conveniently
placed for deep drainage, being situated on the side
of a mountain, which declines into a valley, from
which a horizontal adit or tunnel four miles long can
be constructed, which will cut the mines at a depth
of two thousand leet; that this tunnel once con-
structed, these mines can be profitably worked to a
depth of three thousand feet, and by means of it, at
least a thousand millions of treasure will besecured;
that the State of Nevada cannot render material aid
to this indispensable work, by reason of constitu-
tional inhibitions; thatthe mining companies, while
producinglarge amounts of bullion, and distributing
it into the channels of trade and commerce, under
existing circumstances derive but an inconsiderable
profit, and are not equal without Government aid to
the successful prosecution of such an undertaking ;
that the taxable property of the United States has
been more than doubled within the last eighteen
years, and this increase has mainly resulted from the
vast addition to the precious metals within this time;
and the further addition of one thousand millions
would be an increase to that extent of the public
resources, and virtually a reduction, to a consid-
erable extent, of the public debt; that the United
States contain, by estimation, one million square
miles of mineral land, the chief value of which is
to be found at great depths from the surface ; and
what is now wanting to enlist private enterprise in
the aid of deep mining, and thus develop incalcu-
lable wealth, is a practicable proof, upon such a
scale as the proposed tunnel would furnish, that our
mines are continuous to the lowest levels at which
drainage can be secured; that in all European
mining countries the aid of Government is given
on broad financial considerations to enterprises
of this and like character; that the magnitude
of the proposed work and the results to flow from
its completion, as favorably affecting great finan-
cial questions, justly assign to it a national con-
sideration: Therefore,
Hesolved, by the senate and assembly of the State
of Nevada, conjointly, That our Senators be instruct-
ed, and our Representative recfuested, to use their
best endeavors to obtain from Congress such mate-
rial aid as will secure the speedy construction of the
deep-drainage and mining tunnel known as the
Sutro tunnel.
Unsolved, Thatthe Governor be requested to trans-
mit a copy of the foregoing preamble and resolution,
together with the reports of committees, to each of
our Senators and to our Representative in Congress. •
These, sir, are the instructions under which
1 ask the aid of Congress in behalf of this
great work. These are the solemn acts of
the Legislature of the State I represent. And,
claiming some acquaintance with the people
of Nevada, and with their wants and wishes,
I declare here in my place that these memo-
rials and resolutions faithfully represent the
great body of thatpeople irrespective of party
or politics. This work is in the interest of
labor and the laboring men of my State, and,
indeed, of every mining State and Teriitory.
My distinguished friend from Pennsylvania
[Mr. Kelley] has, with singular vigor of
statement, shown how we delvers deep down
in the earth are interested in this enterprise.
In the course of a debate which arose in the
last Congress touching this subject he said:
" Gentlemen on the other side have spoken for
