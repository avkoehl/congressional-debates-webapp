THE CONGRESSIONAL? GLOBE,
May 28,
The documents accompanying the mes*ase of the Presi- 1
denr, show a series of ajrcressive acts on the commerce of
the United Statesm the Gult of Mexico, and off the We^t
India 1-land*, by the naval forces of Gieat Britain, of a
character so marked and extraordinary as to have fixed the
attention of the country.
Ameiiean vessels put suing the paths of lawful commerce
on the high seas, or passing near the American coast from
one domestic port to another, under the flag of their coun-
try, have been pursued, fired into, and compelled to stop by
the public force of a foreign Tower; questioned as to their
destination, their caigo, and the character of their crew;
required to submit to an examination of their sea paper?,
and to a scrutiny into the objects and purpose of their voy-
age.
In other instances, American vessels anchored in the
harbor of a friendly Power, at the port of Sugu.i la Grande,
in the Island of Cuba, have been subjected to a police in-
quisition by the *aine foreign Power, and in like manner
lequtred to exhibit their papers, and to mi hunt to questions
ns to their de&tmation, the cause of their absence from
home, and the number and chat victor of their crews.
It would appear fiom the letter of the consul ot the Uni-
ted States at Havana, (a document accompanying the
sage,) that no less than fifteen Ammican ves>el> lying m the
harbor, or in poit a' S.igua la Giaiule, wei e made to undergo
this humiliating sv^em of e-ptona'/e, whilst mx vessel* on
the high seas in the Gulf of Mexico, beating then country's
■flag, were, as above f-tared, bv actual exhibition and u-e of
force, endangering, in bome instance**, the lives ot those on
board, compelled to stop ami submit todesemiois, until a
boarding ofiv-er was satisfied in s>ueli questions as it wa* Ins
pleasure to put.
Besides the instances above cited, officially communi-
cated with the President's inevs.ig,^ in r«'ply to a call of the
Senate, each suoee^svc arnv,->l fiom the infected quattcr
brinps intelligence of new and additional ag^te-sions of hl<e
character, committed by the same Power, on vessels bear-
ing the flag ot the United States.
It has occasionally happened heretofore, under oiieum-
stances ot' snisappu hen-ion. or nn-eoii-ti uction of ordeis,
or from other and like eun^e>, that vp.s.-els of tiie United
States have been subjected by the aimed loree <>l a foreign
Power to visitation and seat eh. m violation ol international
law, and in denotation of the independence of out llag, and
in such isolated ca>c-> the honor ol ihe country may have
been sufficiently vindicated by a disclaimer ot intended
wrong or by icbuke -of the ofVicei offending Hut the con-
tinuous and peiMWenng character of the ,i<jL'ic—-ion.-now
brought to the notu e ol the eountrv committed bv a Powei
with whom we are at peace.and almost Wiiliiu oightol oiu
shores, is sufficient to murine the pi-t iiidmti.'inon of ihe
country, and call-, in the opinion of the committee, toi the
most piompt and efficient mea-ures, to ane-t at once, mid
to end finally and lorevet, the commi-won of like indigni-
ties to our flag.
The documents aceompanj ing the menage di-^lose the
fact that these act4? ot visitation and examination of Amei-
?can vessels were sought to be justified uudej the plea of
■necessity for the suppie.sston of the -lave trade, fuppo-unl to
be or actually earned out, between Aftica and the Island of
Cuba.
The committee will not go into any inquitv in ictVreri'*e
to such alleged rieee^itv. It is sulfietent tor them to know
that the assent oi the United States, although oiten invoked,
has nevei been yielded to an\ Mich > \stem of police on (lie
sejis. They rest on the position, not to be eontiovciied, tint

Without going at huge into the (juertton« hcreto:ore m-
volvcd as to the right.- ol independent nations on thai com-
mon highway ot the woihl—the open sea — the committee
ifeem this, neveitfu fe--, a til occasion to t(e< hue tie* pi in-

There is no rislit of vi«ita iou, frit If;*** of seat eh. to be e\-

Such are the rights and I'MutMi'.je-, of our citizens navi-
gating the ocean, which have been fi.iguuiUv \ioL.ted and
outiaged by aimed ve-r-eJs of a foieigu Power in time of
profound peace, and, in some instances, almost w.llun ^.ight
-of our own shoies.

i*et their occurrenco and giuvity v, iil opportunel:\-u|>p!y the
occasion, and to end,now and forever, all future question
as to tins right of vsitation atsea between the United States
and the otFending Power. And the committee refrain only
fiom recommending at once such additional {"gisbiuou as
would ba most effectual to protect the commerce ot the
country from aggressions of tiie character thus brought to
the notice of the Senate. from the fact that the President (as
shown by the letter ot the Secretary of the Navy accompany-
ing the message) lias already ordered all the disposable naval
force of the country into the infested quarter, with orders
' to protect all vessels of the United States on the high seas
from bearch or detention by the vessels of war of any other
nation." These are preventive measures only, and tempo-
rary in their ehaiacter, but, in the judgment of the commit-
tee, goto the lull extent ot the power of the Executive in the
absence of legislative provision. It is believ&d, however,
they will airest, for the present, fmther like offensea m the
quarter whence they have proceeded.
It appeal*, hirthei trom these documents that the altered
state of the relation" between the United States and Great
Bntain, which must arise fiom this aggies«ive conduct of
her aimed vessels, ha« been already bioiight to the uotice of
that Power, by communications trom the Secretary of State
addres-ed both to ihe Bntish Minister here and to the Min-
ister of the United States at London.
It cannot be known until the result of these communi-
cations is laid befoie Congress how far the aets m question
will be avowed or disclaimed by the Government held le-
sponsihle. It i- the carne.-t hope of the committee that the
eouise that Government may adopt will be of a ehaiacter
| to sutisly the pt-t demands of thK Govei nmeiu. and, at the
i saw* tune, to nnnish :i guaiaulee again-t the tepetitton of
j the offen.-e. Nothing shoi t ot this m tiie opinion of the
J committee, will be compatible with peaceful reiatiotis be-
1 tween vhe two eonntnes.
j In the pie-ent po-tuie of the affair, therefore, The eom-
j mittee foibeai trom leeouimending any additional legi^la-
1 t i m to <*nable the President to [>rotect American vi'SseN oil
