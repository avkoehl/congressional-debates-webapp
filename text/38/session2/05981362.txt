THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
March 3,
and upon which we had no information and had
ho time to send to get any.
Mr. ANTHONY. That was a good reason
for the committee in not agreeing to recommend
the appropriation, but I understand from my col-
league in the House of Representatives that the
Department made this estimate and recommended
the appropriation.
Mr. SHERMAN. This item is one of many
raore such, and I ask the Senate to stand by the
Committee on Finance in their action. This bill
was sent to us to-day, and if we take the asser-
tions of a Senator here as to what a member of
the other House may have said was estimated for
at the other end of the avenue, when we have be-
fore us official documents containing no such esti-
mate, we shall load down this bill to an. extent
that Senators would be startled at.
Mr. ANTHONY. If the Senator will allow
this amendment to lie over for the present, I think
I can have the estimate here very soon.
Mr. SHERMAN. I cannot agree to that; we
must go on in regular order. The bill will prob-
ably be reported to the Senate some time after
midnight, and the Senator can then have another
vote on this question. I prefer to go on with it
regularly.

[I For building a cu«tom-house at Portland, Maine, in nd-

! ury may, it he thinks it advisable, expend a sum, not ex-
} cecding §25,000, in the puiehcise of ground adjoining the

• j ted States shall be made upon such exchange, except a
il conveyance, on its behalf, by the Secretary of the Treasury,
of the interest of the United States in the lot aforesaid and
the building thereon.
Mr. JOHNSON. Is that to be stricken oat?
Mr. SHERMAN. As I said before the bill
came to us to-day, and we hud no official infor-
mation on the subject of the custom-house at
Portland. At the last session we appropriated,
I think, $60,000 for building a custom-hnuse at
Portland, and it seems from the proviso attached
to this appropriation that there was some doubt
about the location of the custom-house; at least
there is provision made for a change «f the loca-
tion, and we thought until that question was de-
termined we ought not to appropriate any more
money for tins purpose. An explanation has been
made to me since the uction of the committee
which makes me doubt somewhat the propriety
of that action; but let the amendment be agreed
to now, and before the bill is reported to the Sen-
ate I shall have time to confer with the members
of the committee in regard to it and perhaps to
get more information.
Mr. JOHNSON. The papers from the Treas-
ury Department in relation to this particular im-
provement, which, as I understand, satisfied the
Committee of Ways and Means and the other
House, were not sent by that House to our com-
mittee with the bill, and therefore have not been
before the Committee on Finance. I understand
that the statement from the Treasury Department
satisfied the House committee that the appropri-
ation was not only a proper appropriation but
one about which there should not really be any
doubt. I rather think, therefore, under the cir-
cumstances, it would be better to reject this amend-
ment.
Mr. COLLAMER. I trust we may not agree
to this amendment. I think it has arisen from
some misunderstanding of the case.
Mr. SHERMAN. I will explain to Senators
again that ffie Committee on Finance never saw
this appropriation bill or heard of it until to-day,
and we had no official communication from any-
body in regaid to this item, ltwas not contained
in any estimate of appropriations submitted tons.
We knew very well that a year ago an appro-
priation had been made toward building a cus-
tom-house at Portland, and this provision on its
face seemed to indicate that there was a doubt
about the site. Under these circumstances we
thought it was not wise to continue the appropria-
tion until that question wassettled. A statement
has since been made to me that we shall find offi-
cial information on the subject by sending to the
Committee of Ways and Means. I do not cara
whether the amendment is now concurred in or
non-concurred in, because by the time the bill is
reported to the Senate I may be able to get tha
information. We are simply acting in the absence
of information.
The amendment was rejected.
The next amendment was to strike out the fol-
lowing item:
For compensation of the revenue agent stationed at New
York, in addition to the sum authorized by the act of June
30,1864, inciuding^l,000 for the current fiscal year, §2.000.
The amendment was agreed to.
The next amendment was to strike out the fol-

for in the discretion of the Secretary of the Treasury, and
not exceeding $7,000.
The amendment was agreed to.

To enable the Srcrotary of the Treasury to pay to Wil-
