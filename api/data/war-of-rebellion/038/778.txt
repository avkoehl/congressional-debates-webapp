JACKSON, April 23, 1863.

General S. COOPER, Richmond:

General Stevenson telegraphs from Vicksburg, 2. 30 a. m.:

Six boats have passed down. I think one was a gunboat and five were transports [loaded] to the guards, and so prepared as to have the appearance of gunboats; two were disabled. Some twenty vessels of different descriptions are now between Vicksburg and Port Hudson.

J. C. PEMBERTON.

JACKSON, April 23, 1863.

General S. COOPER, Richmond:

The following just received from Vicksburg:

The wreck of one of the boats in sight near Brown &amp; Johnston's. Smoke-stacks and one wheel-house out of the water. No other boats in sight.

J. C. PEMBERTON.

JACKSON, April 23, 1863.

General S. COOPER, Richmond:

I am notified by General Johnston that it may be necessary to subsist his army from this department. I have, therefore, this day issued an order that no sugar or molasses belonging to private parties be allowed to leave the limits department. No more can be expected from Trans-Mississippi. Would like to know the highest price to be paid for sugar or molasses.

J. C. PEMBERTON.

JACKSON, April 23, 1863.

General S. COOPER, Richmond:

I have so little cavalry in this department that I am compelled to direct a portion of my infantry to meet raids in Northern Mississippi. If any troops can possibly be spared from other departments, I think they should be sent here. Please inform me of supposed disposition of enemy's fleet which operated against Charleston.

J. C. PEMBERTON.

TULLAHOMA, April 23, 1863.

Lieutenant-General PEMBERTON, Jackson, MISS.:

Colonel Roddey reports enemy repairing railroad WEST of Corinth. Will not General Chalmers be able to prevent its being [done]?

J. E. Johnston.

TULLAHOMA, April 23, 1863.

Lieutenant-General PEMBERTON:

The movement you propose would have been made but for the heavy force in front of Colonel Roddey, which still prevents it.

J. E. Johnston.
