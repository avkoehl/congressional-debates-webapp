Captain and Assistant Adjutant-General.
HDQRS. CAVALRY CORPS, MIL. DIV. OF THE MISSISSIPPI,Macon, Ga., April 21, 1865.

Major General E. R. S. CANBY,

Commanding Mil. Div. of West Mississippi, near Mobile, Ala..

GENERAL: This place surrendered to me last night unconditionally. Major-Generals Cobb, G. W. Smith, and Brigadier-Generale Mackall, with 1,500 militia, are prisoners. Since arriving here I have received through General Cobb a copy of an official dispatch from General J. E. Johnston declaring the existence of an armistice between the troops under his command and those under General Sherman for the purpose of arranging terms of agreement between the belligerent. General Cobb has also received a dispatch him to communicate this information to General Taylor, who is requested to solicit and extension of its to your forces and his own. My own impression is that it is not contemplated by our authorities that a general armistice should be declared, or that its terms should apply to your or my forces. There is no doubt, however, that General Lee and his army are prisoners of war, and that General Johnston is in command of the Confederate forces. I have telegraphic communication through the rebel lines and General Beauregard's headquarters to Goldsborough, N. C., and have sent a message to General Sherman.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. H. WILSON,

Brevet Major-General.
HDQRS. ARMY AND DIVISION OF WEST MISSISSIPPI,Mobile, Ala., April 21, 1865.
