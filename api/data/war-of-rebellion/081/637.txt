JONES' NECK, July 4, 1864.

Colonel SHAFFER:

Shall I allow the Widow Grover to pass out of our lines? Her children are outside, and she is very anxious to join them. She is suffering for want of food, and is also exposed to the fire of the picket-line. She can do us no injury. I have forwarded two communications through proper channels, but have heard nothing of them.

Yours, respectfully,

R. S. FOSTER,

Brigadier-General.

JULY 4, 1864.

General R. S. FOSTER:

You can do as you please with Mrs. Grover.
