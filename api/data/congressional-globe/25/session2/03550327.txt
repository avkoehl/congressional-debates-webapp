CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
mi
tamed whether the committee had not transcended
their powers He dented that the objection
was a technical one It was a substantial
one, cons stent with common sense, and founded
on the nature of things On this point Mr S
dwelt at considerable length, illustrating it by re-
ferring to the courts of committees upon other ques-
tions, which was always confined within certain
rules In this instance the comm-tftee jjad nothing
to do with trying the individuals implicated, or
making an argument to prove they were guilty, but
merely, as grand jurois, to return if there was suf-
ficient cause to put them upon then tria' The
only report they were empowered to make was that
Mr Cilley was killed by Mr Grvves in a duel,
hut they should n« ther have pronounced a verdict
of guilty, have recommended a punishment, nor
have made an argument to enforce the necessity of
the verdict and punishment Hence he was op-
posed to the printing of this document, was in favor
of its being recommitted, and should then be un-
willing to postpone it At present, if it was sent to
the people, it would be promulgating an ex parte
statement
Mr TOUCEY again protested against this asser-
tion, for, so far from the testimony being ex parle,
every opportunity was afforded to all the indivi-
duals, interested in the examination, to cross exa-
mine witnesses, and bring others of their own
Mr. SLADE explained, that he refeired to the
report as being ex parle, for the people m the fer-
vor of their feelings, would take it up and make
up their minds upon it, and hence, if the House
should, at the end of the fortnights postponement,
come to a different decision, there would be a con-
flict of opinion between them and their consti-
tuents
Mr S in reply to tha argument that the peti-
tions p-ulook of the nature ot insti uctions, admitted
that, though general petitions did, tins was not an
analogous case, because it affected the private
rights of individual members of the House
Mr FOSTER, contended that it was not propel
for the committee to present a mere report of evi
deeee in a crude, undigested foim They were
instructed to investigate the facts, and "report
thereon," and it was their duty to examine the evi-
dence, and present it in intelligible order, with such
remarks as might lead the House to an intelligi-
ble decision He thought the committee hid kept
strictly within the hne of their duty If he sup-
posed any injustice was done by the committet to
the persons implicated, he would not vote foi the
printing Tht question was, whether the leport
should be printed—not how it cime (here lie was
disposed to do all justice, and would be the last
man to shield amembei by mere technicality, such
as the cobw eb technicalities that prevail in courts
of law He could not consent to establish techni-
cal rules, to rice over mies o' justice He went at
length into the principles of trials m courts of jus-
tice, and by impeachment The rights of the House
to expel a member, when two thirds of ihe mem-
bers thought it propel, was not derived from the
usage  of the British Parliament, nor like ihose
usages, from piescriptum.butaiose under the Con-
stitution, and it was necessary and pioper to insti-
tute free and full examinations, and net for tie
members to shield themselves under abstruse
technicalities, so as to avoid those respon-
sibilities to which other individuals aie liable,
from the action of the House He also le-
ferred to the various petitions, pra>mg for
investigation, and some *>f them praying for
the expulsion of certain members by name, all
which were referred to the committee, as a suffi-
cient reason for a full and general repot t Such a
report alone would satisfy the people, and if the
committee had stopped short, and merely had re-
ported uV evidence, there would have been just
cause of complaint, and he -would have been m
favor of sending the íeport back, for the committee
to complete their duty, a  other committees are re-
quired to do In the case of John Smith in the
Senate, the committee reported the evidence, with
a report and re-olution, and that resolution was the
foundation of all the subsequent action of the Se-
nate. The report and resolution were íeceived
then, and by the same rule should be receiv ed now
He looked upon this as a mere preliminar) pro-
ceeding, and the House had the right and powei,m
their future actionjto correct any erroisfche commit-
tee may have made, and to receive any additional
testimony, to enable them to arrive at a just con-
clusion     There was no danger, he aigued, of
members being treated with injustice by the House,
their friendly relations and daily social intercourse
would forbid it     Mr   P   repelled the intimation
that any members desired to circulate the report to
injure the standing of any member, or to influence
his re-election m case he should be expelled     He
thought no member could be actuated by such un-
worthy motives      He did not fear excitement in
the public   mind   if there  was excitement  two
month ago, it had been allayed, and the  inevi-
table   consequence    of  any   excitpment   which
might   lead  to   injustice   to  any   individual for
a time, was a reaction which would more than
atone for the momentary injury    There was no
fear of permanent injustice to any man, and the
people wanted, and had a right to have, all 'he
evidence up< n which the House was called upon
to act    The question he considered to be, not whe-
ther the committee had conformed to technical
. forms, but whether they had done injustice, ana he
hoped the report would be printed, that the House
might be enabled to judge of the tacts and the ar-
guments, which they could not do as long is it re-
mained in manuscript    He construed the intention
of the rule of the Manual to be simply to pi event a
member being tried, and pernaps degraded, by the
report of a committee in secret session, without his
having any knowledge of it    This was, in  no
sense, such i case, and the rule eould not operate
Mr FLETCHER of Massachusetts sud he felt
no scruples upon the particular point of the printing,
but he felt some solicitude to know, if tht repoit
should Ik postponed for a fortnight, what would be
the condition in which it would then come up, and
in what condition some miners m relation u   it
would be found     With a view   to undeistindng
s >me of these points upon which he felt solicitous
to have information, he desired to ask som< ques
turns of the chairman of the committee, ind he
would propound them sepirately
lie would first ask the chiirmati whethet the tes-
timony of the individual affected by the repot t, or
of any ol them, had been taken?
Mi TOUCLY staled, in r^ply, that the testimony
of Mi CrfuvES was taken upon the application of
Mr "Wisi., as allegid, foi his special benefit, the
testimonj ofMr Wisf was taken it hi*- own ¡e
quest, ind it his own solicitation, the testimonj of
Mr Tims was tiken vuthout the solicitation of
any one, but was his own voluntiiy oflei
Mr WISE wished the chairman to repeat thit
statement
Mi TOUCEY did so
Mr WISE wished the chairman also to state the
fact that the ltquest was not made until aln r the
wnten testimony of Mr Grtvus had betn le
turned by the committee                ^
Mr TOUCEY stated that the general tnteitoga
tory, put to witnesses, was furnished to Mr Graves,
accompanied with a proffer that his testimonj,
his own statement, would be received bj the com-
mittee Mi Gravfs addressed a letter to the com-
mittee, accomjianymg his statement, in which he
expressed himself as wishing it tobe undt [stood
that the committee had interrogated him, and called
upon him, to make a statement The committee
thereupon returned his testimony to him, and
adopted a resolution, declaring that it was not the
intention of the commiUee to put him under any
obligations to answer, but simplv to give him an
opportunity, if he chose to avail hnnself of it It
was subsequent to this that a letter was addressed
to the committee by Mr Wist requesting that his
statemtnt might be taken, as necessary to his de-
fence That letter was laid before the committee
was read, and upon it he presented his statement
Mr WISE would ask the chairman whether a
different notification was not written to Messrs
Grav es, Wisí., and Jones, than was written to the
other witnesses in the form of summons' Whether,
without the examination of any testimony, and
before any testimony was gone into, it was not
taken for granted by the committee that these peí
sons were to be implicated'
Mr TOUCEY could answer that inquiry The
r nominee, in die fir-t place, called upon Mr
Gpuf^, M<- Wisr, and Mr Jo .rs, for the corre
spondence, which was presented bj the committee
It appearing, in that correspondence, that Mr.
Graves was interested, and that the other gentle-
men acted as seconds in the duel, a resolution was
then offered that the interrogatory which was put
to all the witnesses should be put into their hands,
and that, if thev chose, the committee would re-
ceive a statement from them This might not be
the strict phraseology, but if was the substance
Mr WISE     But there was a difference in the
notification to them from that sent to the other Wit-
esses
Mr TOUCFY had stated the fact as he under-
stood it
Mr FLETCHER Will the chairman allow
me to ask if the testimony of those individuals was
taken under oath'
Mr TOUCEY It was taken under oath, and
all the witnesses were cross-examined
At this stage Mr TAYLOR rose, and drew the
attention of the Cu ím to the irregularity of this
proceeding, and the Chair ruled it out
Mr TOUCEY expressed a hope that he might
be permitted to make a full statement in reply to
Mr Fletcher's inquiry, and begged that no one
would object to it
Mr. THOMAS should object, for the obvious
reason of its irregularity He understoid these
interrogatories were propounded m order to obtain
from the chairman statements of what occurred in
the committee room Now it must be foreseen
that this would be wholly improper
The CHAIR stated the ground taken by him in
the eatly pait of this proceeding It wa-, to ex
elude all statements of what occurred in tht cam
mittee room, and he had attempted to rule the
House down to that point In the progress of the
debate, however, although in almost every hour he
had interposed, m as mild and pioper a manner as
he could, by suggesting to gentlemen that they
were exceeding the proper limits, the debate
had gradually slided beyond that point, though,
to this moment, what had been referred to
had been spoken of -uppoMtiously, m for the sake
of argument and illustration When the gentle-
man from Massachusetts rose and propouaded his
interrogatev, the Chair did not, at the instant,
ptrceive its exact bearing, but he saw enough now,
how ev er, to make it \ Ay cleai that the course of
the interrogatories was extending -the debate too
far, foi statements of what occurred in the commit-
tee room, or any transactions there, were entirety
it regular
Mr TOUCEY desired to state a fact tn expla-
nation
The CH4JR could not suffer this debate to go
on, but the House might, by its unanimous con-
sent It was objected to, however, bj several gen
tlemen
Mr GRAVES expressed a hope that the range
of debate would not be restucted, as he desiiecl an
oppoi tunny of addressing the House on the merits
of the question As it would have to be opened,
he ti usted it would be opened at once
Mr FLETCHER resumed, and went on to sav
that he understood that there had been an adjudica
lion, and that sentence had m effect been pro
novmced
Mr TOUCEY rose to explain
Mr FLETCHER said he had seen m a public
print a decision, as a part ei the report, that cei-
tam members had offended,and should be subjected
to certain punishments, and that he took to h* an
adjudication
Mr TOUCEY was about ts explain the ae 'on
of the committee, when
The SPEAKER interposed, and said the report
must speak for itself.
Mr FLETCHER resumed, and said that as to the
question of printing, he had nothing to say But he
wanted to know, when the subject should come up
finally for the action of the House, how he was to
standm relation to the report He wanted to know
tfthe members had been puton trial and if they had
