EXECUTIVE MANSION,

Washington, November 10, 1862.

Major-General POPE, Saint Paul, Minn.:

Your dispatch giving the names of 300 Indians condemned to death is received. Please forward as soon as possible the full and complete record of their convictions; and if the record does not fully indicate the more guilty and influential of the culprits, please have a careful statement made on these points and forwarded to me. Send all by mail.

A. LINCOLN.

SAINT PAUL, MINN., November 10, 1862.

His Excellency ABRAHAM LINCOLN,

President of the United States:

I hope the execution of every Sioux Indian condemned by the military court will be at once ordered. It would be wrong upon principle and policy to refuse this. Private revenge would on all this border take the place of official judgment on these Indians.

ALEX. RAMSEY.

[Indorsement.]

Respectfully referred to Secretary of War.

Major-General HALLECK, General-in-Chief U. S. Army:

Ross, nephew of the Chief, reports to General Blunt that he left Little Rock on the 1st instant. Hindman had 20,000. Holmes with another column of 25,000. Both appear to be moving against General Steele. I suppose this means toward Pilot Knob or Houston, but will try to get the meaning and report to you. General Steele is moving from Patterson to Saint Genevieve with all I can spare from Pilot Knob, according to your orders. General Schofield is sick at Springfield, having turned over his command of the district to General Brown, and the moving force now near Ozark to General Totten. I need more generals. Cannot McKean be sent to me?
