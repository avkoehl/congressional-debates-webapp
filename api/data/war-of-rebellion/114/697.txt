of had he not been a member of the Legislature. These considerations and the state of his health render his release peculiarly proper. The conditions you suggest are reasonable and I think should be complied with, i. e., to take the oath of allegiance and give his parole of honor not to enter Maryland or any insurrectionary State without your permission.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOHN A. DIX,

Major-General, Commanding.

P. S. - The papers sent to me are here inclosed.

SIR: Your order for the arrest of Senator McKaig was received at 8 p. m. yesterday and he was in custody at 11. 30.

Major-General, Commanding.

FORT McHENRY, October 18, 1861.

Honorable WILLIAM H. SEWARD, Secretary of State.

SIR: In the last of August I was arrested at my residence in Cumberland, Md., by the military then stationed at that place and sent to Grafton, Va., the headquarters of Brigadier General B. F. Kelley. After remaining there until the evening of the 3rd of September I was authorized by General Kelley to go to Ohio (of which State I am a native and still own a large property in Columbiana County, Ohio), and also to visit Pennsylvania on my own private business at my own expense. I was not to visit any part of Maryland except the city of Baltimore and that for the purpose of obtaining money to pay my expenses.

It was my wish and General Kelley's intention that I should not return to Cumberland until after the November election simply because I did not wish to take part or be involved in the contest. After spending six weeks in Ohio and Pennsylvania (not being known in that part of Pennsylvania where I was spending my time in geological studies) my money gave out and lest I should give out also I came yesterday to Baltimore to replenish. I arrived at 4 o'clock from Philadelphia and obtained the little money I needed and would have gone back to Pennsylvania this morning in the first train for that city but was arrested at the Eutaw House last night at 10. 30 o'clock. I send you a certified copy of General Kelley's permit. General Kelley heard my case and with the statements of all parties before him he gave me the permit. My parole I have kept strictly. I have not said one word to any person living nor have I written a word to any on the subject of politics. No one in that part of Pennsylvania where I have been knew who I was, what my political sentiments were or whether I had any.
