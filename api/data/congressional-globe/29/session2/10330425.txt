APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
29th Cong 2d Sess.
The Tobacco Trade—Mr. John G. Chapman.
Ho. OF*Re£S.
hogsheads a year. The production of the country |
in 1840 amounted to 175,126 hogsheads, weighing j
219,163,319 pounds, of which 147,973 hogsheads,!
weighing 177,351,600 pounds, were exported. The i
crop of 1842 amounted to 194,694,891 pounds, ac~ j
cording to the report of the Commissioner of Pat- !
ents. The bulk of the crop was formerly produced j
east of the mountains. The greater part is now I
grown west of the mountains, most of which finds
a market at, and is shipped from, New Orleans.* I ;
will not fatigue the House by stating the particu- !
lar amounts grown in each State. As an article |
of trade and commerce, tobacco is the second in- j
terest in the country, and exceeds in amount any :
other article exported except cotton. I take leave :
here to refer the House to tables prepared from the i
records of the treasury, showing the amount of i
exports from 1821 to 1845 inclusive, by which it j
appears that the value of tobacco exported exceeds ;
that of any other production except cotton. That i
I may not fatigue the House by dwelling too mi- j
nutely upon the statistics of the commerce of the i
country, I have prepared a synopsis of the exports j
of the last year, which has been furnished by the
Treasury Department, ending June 31, 1845, and ;
it appears— i
That the fisheries yielded $4,507,124 |
The productions of the forest in timbers, peltry,
dye3, ashes, &c  6,550,421
Wheat and flour    5,735,372 ,
Rice  2,160,456 \

Manufactures of cotton    4,327,928 .
All other manufactures and manufactured arti- \
cles... r   6,307,721 ■'
Tobacco in tfie leaf 7,469,819
Manufactured tobacco  538,438 I
  8,008,317 1
Thus it appears, sir, that of all the productions
of this vast country, the article of tobacco is sec-
ond in amount in the commerce of the country,
and after cotton affords a larger sum for the inter- ,
change of foreign commodities than any other.
2d. Let us now inquire upon what terms this ;
production is admitted into foreign countries, and
how far the much talked-of free trade system op-
erates upon it. It is true, sir, that tobacco is an
article that will well bear a heavy tax, without be-
ing onerously felt by the consumer; but the tax
also operates oppressively upon the producer. It;
is used by every individual in small quantities, and '
therefore the tax is not sensibly felt by him. The -
operation of the restrictions imposed by most of:
the Governments of Europe is felt by the producer 1
in the smaller quantity consumed, and the dimin-
ished price which he receives for his labor, by rea-
son of the immense profit which the consumer is ,
.compelled to pay to the Government. I
The following table, compiled from the records
of the Government, shows the export of tobaccoj
from the United States from 1821 to 1845, exhibit-"'
in<r the value of the article, the number of hogs-
heads, the average value per hogshead,f and the ;
value of tobacco in the leaf. The difference be-
tween the value of tobacco in the hogshead and
the total value of the article exported, is the value j
of manufactured tobacco exported last year. >

That the operation of the restrictive policy of the Governments of Europe may be understood, and
the immense amount of revenue which they raise from this one staple of the United States, I here ask
leave to call the attention of the House to a statement, showing to what countries the tobacco from
the United States is sent, and the amounts exported to each country, as correctly as the commercial
statistics of the country will enable us to ascertain.

Thus it appears, sir, that in the year ending June, 1845, there were exported 147,168 hogsheads,
valued m this country at §7,469,819. ' A table here inserted will show to what countries it was sent, and
the amount to each.

t If hoie proper to state, that ttie hogshead is calculated
at 1.200 pound-; and (o show that the enormous duty levied
b\ Great Britain upon tobacco is productive of enormous
fraud* upon her iovonne, it is estimated that the loril im-
port* into Ureal Britain, upon which duties aie collected*
are 27.000.000 pound* than the export* from the !Tmted
States thither. This arises, in a great measure, tiom the
