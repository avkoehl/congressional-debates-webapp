The gentleman from New Hampshire had said
there was no design to interfere with the institu-
tions of the States If that were so, what were the
people to infer from their acts'! Look to the bank-
rupt laws, as recommended by the Executive at
e/ ;a session Whatever the President recom-
mended, he must have presumed at least that it
would have been acted on, and then what would
have been the effect produced? Why that all the
banking institutions through >ut the whole country
would be placed under the hands of commissioners,
and they under the revision of the President the
result of which would have been, that all the greit
mteiests of the country, commercial arid inlaid,
would have been sacrificed Had the President
iooeV Wh'le a Senior from New Yotk, m
1826, he had declared in this body that the bank-
rupt law was unconstitutional, and > et i n this Miort
period, he was the first to lecemmend a measure,
which, if it could have been carried out,-would
hate ended in one wide sweeping deduction over
all the monejed institutions ot the States
Mr T- said that another reison why the people
had taken the alarm was, that every m in w ho
Sifted his voice against these schemes was pn-
■senbed by the " affinal organ," as it w as call, d
They saw their representatives denounced and vili-
fied for the stand they bad taken They saw, too,
the acts of the Executive, m recommending one
measure, and then, when they weie ready to cairy
it into effect, they were ordered to wheel about and
march off. They had seen the Specie circular,
with the feelings of both Hemes, of Congress
against it, retained, to the great injury of the coun-
try They saw, too, that this identical measure
now before them, when mtiodnced by a representa-
tive fro-n Virginia some time since, was denounced
as revolutionary m its bearing, as injudicious ind
unsafe, and that all the force that could be rallied
in it  favor did not amount to more than thirty-two
votes And yet, said Mr T this scheme is now
presented by the Executive, and we are cilled on
and expected to vote for it He, as a piriy, took
ground agains,t it at that time, and he, as one ot
that party, was pressing the sime principle he then
pursued, and yet the opponents ot this scheme
were treated in a manner that shotted that freedom
of speech and thought was no longer cherished ,
that the very theory of government was r< vcisi d,
and when Executive power had become Mich lint
all who opposed its views, were to be prosnihid
and denounced, it was time for people to take the
alarm, and he would tall gentlemen, ii these
means were persisted in, that New York would
speak in November m a voice louder ih m the
mighty cataract on bet western border
Mr T said that there was nothing to justify the
allegation that the banks had excited their influ-
ence , theiewas not the slightest foundation lot
«uoh an assertion, yet what a picture did it pusent
to the world of Repubhcan institutions' What
would be the opinion in England, with whom we
had moie intercourse than all others, when a Chief
Magistrate charged upon a Slate, and that the Lm-
pire State, that her elective franchise had been oor-
mpted through the influence of local banks
Mr. WRIGHT said, he rose more because he
supposed the Senate would expect him to reply,
than because he was disposed to do so The re-
marks of his colleague had been principally con-
fined to questions belonging to the State which
they had the honor to represent here, and its citi-
zens, and not to questions involved in the dticus-
siort before this body
It had been his object, and he believed his habit,
to confine himself to the debate before the Senate,
and he could not be induced now to vary from a
rule which he had found so salutary In the part
he had taken m those debates, he had endeavored
to discuss every topic with temper and modera-
tion, and to respect the feelings and courtesy due to
every member of the body, whatever opinions he
might hold.
That, too, he intended to do now And as it wis
certam that arty discussion between himself and his
colleague, upon questions which did not pertain to
our duties here, which related to the action of their
CONGRESSÍldNÁL GÍÓÉÉ>
common constituents, and to the results of elec-
tions, and the like, would be almost certain to
throw them into conflict, to develope a radical aif-
ference of opinions and views between them, and
perhaps to excite pergonal feeling, he declined all
such discussions wholly
He had, as he had had occasion to say, upon a
very recent occas on( intended to treat his honora-
ble and respected colleague -with eeery kindness,
and be cou'd not fo'low him into a debate which
might place ihe full execution of that intention be-
jond his power
They could jet b >th as;rce in one opinion that
thev iepies<med a people as intelligent, as free,
as uncorrupted and incorruptible, as the constitu-
ent <>f any t'vo Senators upon the floor. What-
eve) then mightbe their opm onsofths causes which
influenced a particular election, or to which its re-
sults were attributable, or whaiever they might
think of the influence of pending questions upon
future elect ons, the} could not claim that thur
opn ions, or wishes, would materially influence
that constituency If they wettfiee, and mtellt-
Ciiit, and nncoirupted, this inference was not au-
thoii/e I

Mr CLAY slid it was not his intention to enter
into any argument ?t this ttme on the mam question
under discussion, but he had risen to express his
thinks to the Senator from New York, who first
dddiessed the Chair, (Mr Tallwadde,) for the no-
tice he took of the President's Message The Sena-
tors colleague, (Mr Wright,) m declining to meet
him on that ground, showed that he acknowledged
the truth «f the maxim that " discretion was the
better part of valor "   lie was shocked (Mr. C.
m
$aid) at the President having undertaken in his
Message to comment on the result of the local elec-
tions    It was unprecedented, and, he must be al-
lowed to say, undignified     It was the first example
in which the president spoke of th* election , not of
the Generil Government, but of the State Govern-
ments    He reccllecieel when, some }ears ago, an
illustrious man, now no more, who was the Chief
Magistrate of the State of New York, called the at 
ttntion of the Legislature to the interference of the
Federal officers with ihe átate elections    A resolu-
tion was adopted, asking him to give evidence of
the facts chained by him, which, from the nature
of the circums inces, it \ *s  nit in l^s power to
give, but had the tads been established, the whole
country would have sympathised with him and ex-
pressed the deepest abhorrence at ihe conduct of
nhieh he complained     \ Stite Chief Magistrate
might,  in h s message, lefer to ihe result bf his
elections in his own Sipte, but what decent pretext
had a Plesident of the Unites! States to take notice
of th" result of Stite elections, and assign causest
dishonoiable causes, for them     The Senator from
New York (Mr Wright)  said that he would dot
oocupy  the attention ot the Se late with subjects
foreisti to tint under discussion     If it «as nnpro-
pei for the Sonaior 1> do  it,  how came the Presi-

for the result?  for no mm enti'd read the Message

stands on the record, severely leprehending such

was ready with a resolution calling on the Chief
Magistrate for th" evidence em yvhieh he made h,s
allusions to the New York eleptions, but íefrained
from offertntr. it, merely because the matter did not
relate to his own State
Mr WRIGHT said the Senator from Kentucky
(Mr Clay) yvas over kind t) his co'league, that if
a controversy must arise betyveen him and his col-
league lure, he (Mi W ) should have more than
he could well attend to, to meet upon equal terms
his colleague i one, with ut the we „hl ot the dis-
tinguished Senatoi in the scale a^an^t him It
was, therefc re, yvholly unnecessary lint the pa-
triotic eentlemm should hiye interposed himself as
a shield to his colleague upon the present occasion.
He could not, hoyvever, forbear one remark in
reply in the Senator himself That distinguished
and experienced statesman had told him that, in
declining the controversy with his colleague, he
hid illustrated the maxim tnat "discretion is the
belter part of valor " This was a sound maxim,
and he (Mr W ) had intended, in all his actions
here, to bear it constantly in mind Since hearing
the vicyvs of the Setiatoi upon that part of the
message of the President to which his honorable
colleague had alluded, and his declaration as to the
resolution in censure of the President, which he
says he was inclined and prepared to offer, but
which he finally omitted to present, he nit t say
that, upon one single occasion, thf gentleman had
consulted the rule which he had so promptly com-
plimented him for following In thu case, discre-
tion was, most clearly, the better part of valor in
his action.
