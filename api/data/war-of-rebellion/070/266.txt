a. m. to-morrow. The reports from the cavalry are not entirely satisfactory, but I hope to get that which is more reliable before morning. What I have would indicate that the rebel force had moved west, probably to Edwards Ferry.

OFFUTT'S CROSS-ROADS, MD., July 13, 1864.

(Received 11.45 p. m.)

This afternoon I sent a staff officer to the detachment of the Nineteenth Corps commanded by Colonel Davis, with orders to move. Colonel Davis reported his command without rations and without transportation, although requisition had been made for both. His command numbers only about 600. He had received no preparatory orders, and was, therefore, requested to communicate at once with General Gillmore. Under these circumstances it is doubtful whether this party reaches me to-night.

HEADQUARTERS SIXTH ARMY CORPS,July 14, 1864. (Received 4.10 p. m.)

My command moved from Offutt's Cross-Roads at 4.30 o'clock this morning, and advanced to near Seneca Creek, when, learning nothing from the cavalry on the Rockville road, and getting intelligence through a small party, which had been sent from the cavalry in my immediate front, which had been driven in, that the enemy was in full force at Darnestown, I have halted until I can ascertain the truth of the report by an infantry reconnaissance now out. I believe that the bulk of the enemy's force has already crossed the river at Edwards Ferry. This fact will shortly be developed, and, if they have left Darnestown, I shall continue the march to Edwards Ferry. I send three prisoners, one an officer, who says that the bulk of their command has already crossed the river. One of his men also reports that General Franklin escaped Tuesday, about nine miles from Baltimore. is positive of this. The march is rather a severe one, the men straggling badly. The teams are green, and the trains consequently move much less rapidly than the infantry. At last accounts none of the Nineteenth Corps had joined. General Gillmore sprained his foot seriously last night, and has probably returned to the city.
