This does not agree with the information you have that Rosecrans was at Nashville on the 12th. As I am very desirous of supplying as far as I can the deficiency in our force in Kentucky caused by the non arrival of General Breckinridge's command, I shall send Howard's cavalry and one battery (Eldridge's) with General Maxey, and there shall be no delay which I can prevent in pushing forward Maxey's command, I am naturally very anxious to receive early information of your movements and of those of the enemy, and have arranged relays of couriers from here to Gainesborough, Tenn., at intervals of about 10 miles. Your last courier was four days reaching here. Dispatches may be sent through in less time by my couriers. I am afraid there is some delinquency the part of the quartermasters or wagon-masters of your army in sending back empty wagons. Only 21 have yet reported, and I understand from your letter of the 4th that both Generals Polk and Hardee would send back trains. I telegraphed the Adjutant-General of Georgia to ascertain if he could furnish any arms for the Kentuckians, and have just now received his answer that he could send only pikes and knives. I replied that it was not advisable to send them, as the Kentuckians could improvise such arms if they are in earnest.

Respectfully,

SAM. JONES,

Major-General McCOWN, Knoxville, Tenn.:

General Maxey's command will start in a day or two for Kentucky via Knoxville, and carry all arms that can be procured to Kirby Smith. Have your or do you expect to have any arms to send? Be sure to have Douglass' battalion at Kingston ready to join Maxey.

General S. COOPER:

General Bragg informed me that General Breckinridge with his command would come by Chattanooga en route to Kentucky and transportation was provided, and that General Tilghman would bring the exchanged prisoners from Vicksburg here. General Breckinridge has gone with General Van Dorn to Holly Springs or West Tennessee. Have any counter orders been given to General Tilghman or may I look for them?

Brigadier General W. PRESTON, Atlanta, Ga.:

Telegram received. General Maxey will start with about 3,000 men to-morrow to join Kirby Smith by way of Knoxville. Governor Hawes and council will leave here this evening or to-morrow to go to the army in Kentucky. You had better come by here and join Maxey or Hawes.
