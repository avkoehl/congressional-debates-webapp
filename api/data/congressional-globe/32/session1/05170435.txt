Mr. STUART, from the same committee, re-
ported the following resolution:
Resolved, That the third week in April next be set apart
for the consideration of territorial busings, and that during
that week such biiMness >hall take precedence over othei
business, and be regarded as the special order.
Mr. STUART. I was told by the chairman of
the committee, who was expected to make this
report, that such was the arrangement at the last
Congress, that certain days were set apart for that
purpose.
Mr. STEPHENS, of Georgia. I rise to a ques-
tion of order. The House never instructed this
committee to take into consideration the time at
which territorial business should be taken up, and
hence they can submit no report upon the subject.
They can report only upon matters committed to
them. It is not competent for a committee to ask
the suspension of the rules for the purpose of in-
troducing a resolution, except on Monday of each
week.
The SPEAKER. The Chair cannot entertain
a motion to suspend the rules of the House, at
any time, except on Monday of every week. The
Chair overrules the point of order ot the gentleman
from Georgia in this, that he thinks it competent
for the committee to consider and report upon the
time proper to take up territorial business; but the
committee has no more right than an individual
member of the House to submit a resolution to
make a special order, which would, if objected to,
require a suspension of the rulesâ€”motions for
which purpose being in order only on Mondays.
Mr. GIDDINGS. Has not this been the uni-
form practice of the House?
The SPEAKER. It has been customary to set
apart days for the consideration of territorial busi-
ness, but not in the manner proposed.
Mr. HALL. It can be done only by the sus-
pension of the rules, which motion is not in order
to-day.
Mr. STUART. I will withdraw the motion,
intending to submit it on Monday, as I do not
wish to consume the time of the House upon
points of order.
Mr. GIDDINGS, from the Committee on Ter-
ritories, reported " A bill authorizing the Govern-
or of the Territory of New Mexico to call an extra
session of the Legislative Assembly of the said
Territory, if the same be deemed necessary and
expedient;" which was read a first and second

Whole House, made the order of the day for to-
morrow, and, with the report accompanying, or-
dered to be printed.

morrow, and ordered to be printed, together with
the accompanying reports, viz:^
A bill for the relief of Catharine Clark;
A bill for the relief of Jacob Shade; and
A bill for the relief of Thomas P. Dudley.
Mr. HARRIS, of Tennessee, said he had been
instructed by the Committee on Invalid Pensions
to ask that said committee be discharged from the
further consideration of the following petition's,
and that they be referred to the Committee on
Naval Affairs*, viz:
. * k.e petition of John Duncan for an invalid pen-
sion in consequence of a disability received in the
naval service of the United States;
_ The petition of Mary Woodward, of Connec-
ticut, the widow of Lieutenant Woodward, who
lost his life in the service of the United States,
asking for a pension; and
I he petition*of Lot Davis for a pension in con-
sideration of a disability incurred in the United
States service in the war with Great Britain.
Mr. CABELL, of Florida. I ask respectfully
what is the purport of all these applications fiom
which theNaval Committee asked to bedischarged?
They all ask, I believe, pensions for naval service.
Mr. HARRIS, of Tennessee. They are me-
morials for the allowance of pensions for injuries
sustained in the naval service of the country. The
examination I have given the subject lias con-
vinced me, that heretofore that class of cases
has been considered and reported upon by the
Committee on Naval Affairs. The committee of
which I am a member, instructed me to ask that
these cases be referred to that committee.
Mr, CABELL. The Committe&on Naval Af-
fairs have unanimously passed a resolution, that
they will report back cases of this kind to the
House, with a recommendation that they be re-
ferred to the Committee on Invalid Pensions. It
is no argument, as a reason for the reference to the
Committee on Naval Affairs, that the pension
arose from services connected with the Navyâ€”no
more than that pensions growing out of military
operations should bcrefencd to the Committee on
Military Affairs. As a member of the Naval
Committee, I shall object to the reference.
Mr. HARRIS. 3 will state, as a member of
the Committee on Invalid Pensions, that these
cases belong to the Naval Committee. The com-
mittee are willing to discharge the duty, but after
an examination of that class of cases, and from the
precedents heretofore established, the committee
think that they appropriately belong to the other
committee. I desire to get the sense of the House
as to which is the appropriate committee for the
consideration of that class of cases.
Mr. CABELL. I will merely state, that the
chief ground upon which the Committee on Naval
Affairs applied for a clerk was, that their time was
very much engaged with private claims. Here is
a committee appointed specially for the considera-
tion of these particular cases, aiid I beg the House
will refer these memorials to the appropriate com-
mittee, and not lefer them to the Committee on
Naval Affairs.
Mr. STANTON, of Tennessee. I concur with
the gentleman from Florida [Mr. Cabell] in re-
gard to the disposition which ought to be made of
these memorials. If I understand them correctly,
they concern pensions, and, therefore, ought to
go to the Committee 011 Invalid Pensions. I stated
this morning, and it's very proper to say it here,
that the Committee 011 Naval Affairs have more of
these cases than it is possible for them to attend
to. So far as I ton individually concerned, T do
not care a farthing whether the House give a
i clerk to that committee or not. I do not ask a
clerk for them, upon mv own account. I believe no
one will charge me with neglect of duty, as head
of that committee, so far as I have capacity to do
it. No one will charge me with want of industry,
at least as much industry as ought to be applied
! to public business under these circumstances, f
i say to the House, that it is impossible for us to do
| the business of that committee, as things now are.
I shall, however, do as much as I can, and'the
balance I shall leav e undone. I think it is wholly
mineeessan' to send this memorial to the Com-
mittee on Naval Affairs, when another committee
can more appropriately dispose of it. I say fur-
ther, that, if it goes there, it cannot probably receive
the attention of the committee.
1 Air. HALL. I move that these memorials be
recommitted to the Committee on Invalid Pen-
1 siuns.
1 Mr. BOCOCK. The question raised by^ the
I chairman of the Committee on Invalid Pensions
: is, whether these subjects come legitimately before
! the Committee on Invalid Pensions, or the Com-
I mittee on Naval Affairs. 1 believe the practice of
