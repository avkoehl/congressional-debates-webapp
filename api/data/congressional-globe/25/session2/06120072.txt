APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
Jan. 183§.
2oTH ConG"--2nd Sess.
Mr. Calhoun's Resolutions—Mr. Rives, Calhoun, Preston.
Senate.
conflagration that mounted to the clouds, by thiow-
mg a bucket oí water on it Expediency, conces-
on, compromise' Aw ay with such weakness and
lly Right, justice, plighted faith, and the Con-
i tutipn the*e, and these only, can be relied on to
avert conflict These have been surrendered for
inexpediency'
He was not satisfied w ith the explanation which
the Senator from Kentucky gave, why the amend-
ment should be limited to FJorida. He says, that
many of these fanática are so ignorant, that they
are not aware of the fact, that Florida is the only
slaveholdmg Territory If such be the case, how
idle would be the whole scheme of the Ssnator to
meet them with argument' But, as badly as he
thought of them, he did not think the Senator had
done them justise They weie indeed blind and
deluded in their warfare on oui institution1!, but
on all other subjects, many of them were as intel-
ligent as the rest of the community, and
know as well as he and the Senator how
many -Territories we bad, and that Flon-
da was the only one with i slave population
On this point they knew perfectly what they were
about, and in praying that slavery might be
abolished in the Territories, they intended to esta-
blish a general principle, not only that it should be
abolished in Florida, where it exists, but that
hereafter no Terntory should be created m which
it should not be prohibited This was clearly their
intention, and when the Senator limits it to Florida,
he deel nes to meet this broad issue, and virtually
surrenders the whole ground, except Florida, to the
Abolitionist* One of his leading objects, as he
has often said, m moving these resolutions, was to
ask the Senate to define its position, in order that
his constituents and the world might know what
ground this body intends to occupy He asked
none to vote against his judgment 01 inclination,
but to say distinctly by his vote what he intends
If it be intended, then, to surrender all constitu-
tional grounds as to the Territories, and places their
protection on the ground of inexpediency, and to
surrender all Territories hereafter to be created,
without even the poor protection of this feeble
word, vote for the resolution as amended As to
himself, he would give no such vote He never
would consent to place our rights on such frail
foundation He stood on the Constitution—on the
great principles of non-interference and non dis-
crimination, and he ne-'er would surrender them,
and put the questioti on mere inexpediency He
would leave those who took different views to de-
cide on the resolution as amended as they might
think proper He would take no part in it, one
way or another
Mr CLAY here modified his amendment, on the
suggestion of Mr Hubbard, the most important
part of which modification related to the implied
breach of faith, by abolition, with citizens who,
with their slave , settle in the United States Tun-
tories
Mr C4.LH0UN said he believed the Sena'or
from New Hampshire was willing to go as far as
he psssibly could m this course But Mr C had
set out in this discussion with the determination to
jield or recognise neither the right of interference,
or of discrimination But this amendment would
yield it, or, at best, it did not assert the contrary
right Mr C would neither oppose it nor vote
for it, perhaps it was the strongest that ccnld be
had, and if so, let it pass What Mr C wanted
was, that the Government, the common agent of
the States, should define their posit on, and that
the Northern States should be declared to have no
right to look into or judge of Southern institutions,
or to legislate in relation to them on any ground
After some remarks from Messrs WALKER
and CALHOUN,
Mr RIVES, after sorte remark1., moved to
strike out the proposed amendment after tne word
"Resolved," and insert the following as a substitute
"That any interference with the subject of sla-
very m the Territories ot the United S ates 11 w hie1!
jt may exist, is innibited bv all th" confide!ations
in regard to thenglts and interests of the nhabi-
tantsof the said Territories the security of the
slaveholdmg States, and the danger of the Union,
which are mentioned m the preceding resolution as
forbidding any interference with, or action on, the
subject of slavery in the District of Columbia, and
for the furthei reason that the people of the Terri-
tories, when admitted into the Union, as States,
will be exclusively entitled to decide the question
of the existence of slavery, within their respective
limits, for themselves "
Mr CALHOUN said that the Senator from
Virginia (Mr Rives) appeared not to be
pleased with his determination not to vote
lor .the resolution as it now stood amend-
ed He (Mr Calhoun) complained of no Se-
nator's course, and none had a right to complain
of his We are acting on a great and dangerous-
subject, one which will long agitate this country,
and have a decided influence on its future destiny
He, for one, was determined throughout to occupy
the srround which his judgment and conscience dic-
tated , and he expected and desired others to do
the same At the outset, he stated that he wvs
piepared to modify Ins resolutions, so as to make
them acceptable, as tar as he could, without sacri-
ficing thp principles on which ihey rested These
were, as he had fiequently stated, non interference
andnon-discrimination, which,mini opinion,could
not be abandoned, at any point, without a sacrifice
of the lights and safety of the South , and, under
this impression, he had constantly resisted every
attempt to induce him to surrender them
The Senaloi seemed to think that he had not, in
his fifth íesolution, taken constitutional ground
He thought diflerently, that he had taken the
highest and strongest constitutional ground in de-
claring tint interference with slavery in this Dis-
trict, or the Terntoru s, was a direct (yes, he would
repeat an epithet he had yielded to reconcile the
Senator from Kentuckj, Mr Crittenden,) and
dangerous attack on the domestic institutions
of all the Slates, as duect and as dangerous
as an interference with slavery in one, would
be an interference m all the other slave-
holding States, thus placing slaveiy here, and
in the Territories, under the same constitutional
protection as m the States themselves He
would have added the additional ground, which
the Senator had so well explained, and m which
he entirely concurred, but he knew that the sense
of the body had already been tested in relation to
it, andahat we of the South were ma minority on
it, and his object was to place it on constitutional
grounds, siill higher and stronger, if rossible,and
on w Inch he had hoped there would be grcatei
unanimity As to voting foi a resolution placing
the question on the ground of inexpediency, the
Senatois fiom Virginia and Mississippi must ex-
cuse him He believe 1 it would be fallacious and
dangerous, and neither his judgment nor sense of
duty would pen lit him to give it Ins vote II we
place the question there, vie will be overpowered
The whole N«rlh, wiih little exception, would be
united against us, and we would be voted down in
both House , m less than two years and that on a
ground which would notjustify the South in taking
the remedy into her own hand 
The amendment offered by the Senator from
Virginia was much better than the resolution as it
stood amended Though it surrendered much, (the
only strung and tenable grounds, in his opinion)
yet it abandoned the Itebie ground ot inexpediency,
and resied the question on "something like a princi-
ple With a slight modification, adding a single
letter to the resolution, so as to mike it plural in-
stead of singular, and to refer to the resolutions
already ad< pted, it would, in a gieat measure,
make it conform to the filth as he had originally
presented it He hoped the Senator would make
the modification Thus modified, he would wil
lmgly give it hisvote, and he trusted that the Sena
tors from the non-slaveholding States who had sup
ported his first fo ir resolutions, would give it theirs
also
Mr PRESTON,-fter briefly cr ticismg the se-
veial amei dr ent , said that he thought them all
object inab e in many respect  Indeed, from the
f rst, he had not con^ea'ed the repu 'nance he felt
pt bnngin" the South, in this manner, to trial be-
fore an incompetent tribunal, by any mere resolu-
tions and abstractions of any kind He still con-
tinued of this opinion, and deprecated the agitating
course which had been pursued His position was
to deny the juiisdiction—to declare the subject was
coram non jttdice, and not to stand here and be in-
sulted by agitation and discussion of his undoubted
rights Therefore, he utterly disclaimed the course
of dragging the South before the Senate by resolu-
tions and abstractions.
As to these amendments, if adopted, they would
weaken the effect of the resolution He thought
that resolution, as it stood yesterday, was stronger
than it now is, with these amendments Mr. P.
earnestly invoked the Senate to put an end to these
discussions What benefit could accrue from such
endle s discussions? How was this a way to meet
the Vermont resolutions1 Gentlemen might re-
solve and resolve, and still go on resolving and re-
solving, but what, he would ask, was the effect of
such a course'* Its only effect was to create agita-
tion, and open a wider door for the Abolitionists
here, and throughout the country Discussion
(said Mr P ) sets us down, it weakens our cause,
we want action, and not discussion It was a dif-
ference merely of tweedle dum and tweedle dee,
which was contended for in the verbiage and mere
phraseology on which debates were started, but
while gentlemen were amusing themselves in this
manner about the difference between a few letters
and words, the outrage upon the South was carried
on all the while by the very discussion There-
fore, Mr P deeply regretted the introduction of
thts matter fiom the first.
I can see precisely, Mr P said, that the gentle-
men have very kind feelings towards us I am
grateful for it, and would not disturb the harmony
between us, or withhold from them due gratitude
and respect I am disposed to vote the way they
suggest, and have concluded to go with them, and
the consideration is not passed by that they may
conquer for us at the North I am not disposed to
adopt any oflensive armor, nor yet to preach up the
great principles of moderation But the South are
properly to avail themselves of defensive armor,
and when these boiderers know that they are linked
and bound together, and ready for action whenever
assaulted, this frowning altitude is the very best
that can be taken, and the only possible means of
making a secure defeuce They can protect them-
selves , and what I here w*sh to do is to save the
Union, and maintain the peace of the country, by
keeping the agitators out of these halls Sir, if
you will only do your duty here, we will keep out
the borderers, and we do not want your help for
that purpose Protect us within the walls of the
Capitol out of it, we will protect ourselves, and
we ask you only to let us alone
The modification proposed by the Senator from.
Virginia links in the same destiny the Territories
and the States, because it declared that to touch
slavery m the District or the Territories would dis-
turb and endanger the Union m the same manner
as to touch it m the slaveholdmg States It first
aimed at preserving the Union, and then the inte-
grity and lights of the States
After some lemaiks from Mr NILES, Mr.
WALKER submitted amodification, which wasac-
ceptcd by Messrs CLAY and HUBBARD, to slnse
out the wordi "ought not," and to insert that any at-
tempt of Congress to abolish slavery in any of the
Territories would create serious alarm and just
apprehension in the States, sustaining that domestic
instil ution, &c
The question was then taken on Mi RIVES'S
amendment, and decided m the negative;—yeas 10,
navs 29, as follows
YFAS—Messrs Calhoun, Cuthbert, Fulton,
Lumpkin, Preston, Rives, Roane, Sevier, Tipton,
and White—10
NAYS—Messrs Allen, Bayard, Benton, Black,
brown, Buchanan, Clay oí Alabama, Clay of
Kentucky, Claytrn, Crittenden, Grundy, Hubbard,
King, Lyon, Merrick, N cholas, Niles, Norvell,
Pierce, Robinson, Smith of Connecticut, Smith of
Indiana, Strange, Swift, Walker, Webster, Wil-
liams, Wngnt, and Young—29.
The question then recurring on Mr CLAY'S
substitute a  amended
Mr CALHOUN moved to amend it by insert-
mg the words " dangerous attack upon the States
in which slavery exists."
