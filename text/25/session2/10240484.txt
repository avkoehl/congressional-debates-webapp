Since the >ear 1819, me have been continually
told that no treaty cutí d be obtained on peaceable
and reasonable terms And why, sit1 Becau e the
treaty of mat ye ir indicated to the Indians a wil-
lingness on the pait of the Government that their
1< cat on should be permanent, that the compact
b ould not be enforced but, above all, a new in-
fluence ajid a moral power had arisen aanngst the
Cherokees, which began then, and has ever su ce
gov Lined that tribe, whit  men, mam of them fo-
reigners, \i ho had taken Indian tomes, were nume-
rous, and bv their alliances soon had great influ-
ence I heir children grew up, many half-breeds,

Constitutions ot the States They had legislative,
executive, and judicial departments The mem-
bers ol council, their chief executive, and then va-
rious circuits, judges, clerks, sheriffs, &c wtie

This Government went into operation as mde
pendent and sovereign, exercising civil and crimi-
nal jurisdiction
The question here piesent°d is important, and
involves drecfty and vitally the doctnne ot State
rights liad Georgia the right to extend her juris-
diction over the Clierokees and abolish this inle-
periLnt and sovereign Go einmentof theirs? Most
clnrlj, ' for, by the Revolution, the duties as well
as the powers of Government devolved on the peo-
ple of t*e State It is a Imitted that among the lat-

« Fmdiey, 2 Peter , 591, the «ame principle, it
is decided, applies to the States, "ror though th j
form a confederated Government, yet the several
States retain their mthmdual sovcieigntiei, and, with
íespect (o their mun cipal regulations, are lo twh

volved on Georgia by the Revolution, over her

of her territorial jurisdiction, by the old confedera-

depending entuely on the legislative will of Geor-
gia, whether the Cherokee Government should be
abolished, and the laws of the State extended o er
the Indians
Georgia delayed the exercise of this power, she
felt unwilling todo any act which might change
the habits of the Indians, or limit them in the r
pursuits, she determined to lorbear as long as th
