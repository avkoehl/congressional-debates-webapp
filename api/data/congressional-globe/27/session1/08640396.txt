on this p iM I hold it to be next to impossible that here
should beany suspension of specie payments by banks situated
like those in Massachusetts, except it be wholly < nventional
They may suspend by conceit with banks elsewhere, as the
most convenient thing to be done, but I apj rehend it would lie
difficult to compel them to a susr ension agiinst their own will
Andas for a National Bank, with thr seeu mes v,i,ith would
beaffirded by the piovisions in regard to circularon and in

LAND REVENUE DISTRIBUTION BILL.
SPEECH OF MR. BENTON,
OF MISSOURI,
In Senate, Friday, August 13, 1841—On Mi McRo-
burt&'s auiPiielim-nt lo ludirse th  g anls of
land to each oí ihe new States ior ol j els of in
lenidl improvement, io an. amount ih it would
make Hem equal to ihe quantity granted to
the State ot Ohio for the same purpo e.
Mr. BENTON begged the attention of the Se-
nate, and especially the indulgent heanrg of ihe
Sena'ors from the old Stales, wh,le 1 e vindica ed
the justice oi th s ameudmeit, and showed ihe
propriety of achpiipg it Tne grants lo the tew
State*, which the amendment pr posed, were not
gratuUies, as some migb' think fl i^mg from ihe
generosity and appending upon the bounty of Con
gress, but vere debt  oí jus 'ce, f>uly due 10 die
new Siatp , and depending on principles wluh
only needei to b  stsred in or ler 'o be nnd r.'ood
and acknowledged. The pitnctple on which tt.ey
depended was, that it w s die duty ot Iindnoideis
in all coui 'nolo assist in making the na ! cmals
and bridges, and keeping thera in rrpa'r, wh ch U-
cihtate communications between differmt pms 0t
the coun ry, and g ve value to the lands ^ ich they
bring into no ice and make accessible it cial or
commercial n ersour* . O.i this pi nr-p > <. w„s
that the United States, in . 1 llcir eren < ci i tin
the retv Slates, agreed to p->y ¡hem bite per
centum on the amount of ¡.n! sai«s wiihin
the S a e, for m-<k ng roads av! c<n Is within
the Siae, and io expend t«o p-"- ceu'un for
roadsio the St.t, <nd, in cons deration ti iho e
per cemuras, the new Stales agreed not to in efere
¿/¡th the primary disposition of ¡he soil, ior to ia<c
the lands while they remained the property of the
United .States, nor for five years alter they weie
sold. These were the compacts and the pnncip'e
on which h y wee made; and it was soon found
that they were ve-y b<<d bargain^ for the new S ateo,
which had given up ir tra uable nms'fges °f sove-
reignly in exchange for .he insignificant ronsi-
deiation of ih.e'-eliiile perceruims It was lue
rally a case in which 'he hi'th-right had betn sold
tor a mess of pott>g? The clear nght of taxation
a onp, to say nothing of the con ested r ght to tne
vacan" land wi bin h¡>r hmiis, («h ch I am free to
?y I never claims *,) though Congress dfenifd it
ot sufficient njomfnt io ¿uard ?gRirst thi State
claim by a c!au j in the compacts leaving out
this claim, which ihe lompacis put to rest, and
only looking io the uncon e^'ed neht of taxation,
sr,d ltwascleai that every Sate lost in the n n-
taxab'lttv of ihe public lands some fifty or an hun-
dred u-nes as much as sh° received in the little per
ct-ntums upon the sales, only three rer centum of
which could be spent n thin her own limits if he
right ot taxa'ion had continued, ihe public I nds
would have been subject to all the laxes which (ell
upon pr vate property: Slate tax, 'ounty tax, nad
tax, bridge tax, and every thing. By 'he compacts
nit this was given up, and it v*as soon found Ibat
an nvaluable privilege faaá been surrendered for a
song
Oi o was the oldest ot ihe new Sta'es with which
these e-ompacii were made, at d she w?s Ihe first
'o frel ihe injust ce of them, an ' to d>man 1 «ddt

Sutes-, have reeved, o ie about 400 000 and t>e

S ate, Missouri, Arkansas, Michigan, Loui-
siana Fnd fio"isHss ppi have rec°i rea noihint, or
next to nothing; not because they did not apply
fur their rights, but for reasons which I shall pie-
sently explain
The bill row before the Senate proposes to ,-]iow
to such of the new States as have received Ic-g
thsn half a million ol acres, as much as, in addi-
tion io what they have leceived, «ill make half a
million, tne effect ot which voukl b-, lo gnnt no-
thing to Indnna ard Illinois, «hich have i ^ceived
more ihan half a million, and io ronftre the grants
to Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas,
Missouri and Michigan These six Slates, jn re-
ceiving ihe amounts allotted them by the bdl,
would st.ll receive upwards of half a million hss
than Ohio receivd, upwaros of a quarter of a mil-
lion less than Indiana received, and about one
100 000 Peres le s than was granted to Illinois
This is an inequality which no >-easoa onjusufy,
or apologv ex< use Thj amendment rf the Sena-
tor from Illinois [Mi. IVÍcRobeits] proposes tcie-
medy this mequal ly, and to increase tne giant-> of
paeh of tn erewStales to the same amount which « as
granted to Ohio, whi"h was about 1,140 000 at if,
Todo justice to his mouon I will read it Itisin
these words-
'There shall be eranted to each of the States of Illinois In

amsidmeit irsTted, and before I proceed to "ive
farther reasons for this opinion I will exhibit"the
difference between the bill and the   amend-
ment, and the loss to the new Siates  by the
bill, in a tabular torm, which will make  it clear
and striking.

Tnis is thj d fference beave i the bi'l and the
arrendmen*, and th s the less to ihe e'Elit Stales
named; and the same loss may be exieii'ed to
the Tern tines of Florida, Wisconsin and Iowa,
which, on becom ng States, are to receive tit  same
quantities of land for obj-cis of internal improve-
ment wh ch th'S bill may srant to the new States
exclusive of Ohio The difference is great—the loss
heavy—and what reason can be assigned for
lfi Non3 t pon earth, except the ore which no
member chcoses io jssign, and that is, that it
would lessen ihe dt<tnbuttve sha es to the old
Slates' It wou'd take aoout four mill'ons of acres
to make gotd the quantmeo lo the eight new States,
and about a million and a half to make them good
to ihe three Tem'oaes; m all about five and a half
millions of acres, and would dim n sh io that ex-
lent the amount of the distribution fund' This is
fie only reason that can be given for opposing the
amendment. It is ceiUinly a smail reason, and a
vile om, bu one of «-onie weight in a case of plun-
der—in the case of tn  strong plundering the
veak, as this is—tnd iberrfore ia the only assign-
able ledson for the injasucc perpetrated in the case
bafrre in,
A'l the reasons which sustamel the grants to
Ono, apply \ ith equal force to the other S ates;
and the principle on which her grants turned wou'd
give a rinitis larger quantity to each of the olher
Sates The rease i was, the tot'! inadequacy of
the three per ceoioms u compensate fs r the li ss of
taxes en the public lanj„ during the whole period
that they remained unsold, old for fiíe years ihere-
afier, end the ob'igation which the Uni ed Slates
was tinder, as the great landholder in the Sate, to
cininbute her fair prop rtton to ihe construction
and repttr of th  roads, bridge--, and canals, which
were so advantageous to her own property. This
rea on is just as strorg in the other Stales as in
Ohio, and the principle of it tyould demand larger
grants for them than for ,he State of Ohio, for all
the other S'ates contained much more public land,
and some of ihentw.ee, ana nearly three times,
as that State did. The puhlc lani belonging to
the United States in Onio never exceeded about fif-
teen millions of acres. The great reserves, to Vir-
ginia and Connecticut, and other re- < rsations, and
previous granf, cut deep into the punbe domain in
.he State, and left ihe Unite 1 States little more than
two-th rds of its superfitial content The area of
the State is but twenty-five millions of acres, whi's
that of other new Siates is f.om thirty to near forty
millions, and all belonging to the United States.
Missouri contains near forty millions of acres:,
nearly all of wh ch is, or was, public land; and,
upon the same principle that Ohio receivsd above
one million of acres for fifteen millions held by the
United S ates within her limits, Missouri should re-
c iva a i andalu.'f nil ons of awes upon the
quantitj «eld withtr her I this. The same of the
other hoi*- States, eacn of which would recave two
millions ot aeres, or more,uoon the -¡.m principle
ttvt O.iio received one. Yei this bill offers but
half a million, and the supporters of the bill op-
pose the increase ot thit quan'it/ to ihe mil ion
and a fraction which Omo ,eceived. In other
words, the bill offers about t'.e one fojith of what
the unsatisfied States are en it ed to receive. We
ask for the half, and wc aie uemed. This is injus-
tice—flagrant, cryirg injustice—and ro excuse or
apology can be made for it, except the sordid con-
s deration ot not diminishing the fund for distribu-
tion.
I say it ic the onlv reason, for the pretext of
alarm that ¡he b li w.I! not pa-s if it is made any
better for the n-w Stales, ,s all a joke—mili for
babes, but not meat for men.   Not pass!   No dan-
