The following telegram just received from General Evans:

ADAMS RUN, S. C., July 10, 1862.

I have reconnoitered the enemy on Edisto. he is in large force and still landing troops and provisions. Yesterday he attacked my pickets on Dawho and Wadmalaw. I have sent one regiment to the assistance of Colonel Walker at Pocolatigo.

I do not believe the enemy have many troops on the coast. Colonel Walker reports they have recrossed at Port Roayl Ferry. Pickets generally exaggerate.

Report of Major W. P. Emanuel, Fourth South Carolina Cavalry.

CAMP MARION,

Near Georgetown, S. C., August 15, 1862.

GENERAL: I have the honor to report to you an engagement with the Federals, which is as follows:

On Wednesday, the 13th instant, about noon, the enemy's gunboats and a small tug made their appearance in Winyaw Bay, in front of Georgetown, and anchored. They remained there until about 3 a. m. of the 14th, when they moved off very cautiously up Black River to Mrs. Sparkman's plantation, some 20 miles above Georgetown. I immediately took all the forces on the south side of the river and arrived there as soon as possible. Before getting there, however, I heard heavy firing in the direction of the section of artillery belonging to Captain Ward's battery, but not being able to get any communication
