I informed him that the change of Steele's column and his march toward Camden had determined me in leaving him to conduct the operations on Red River, while in person I marched wight eh column moving to Arkansas; that should Steele retreat across the Ouachita the infantry column under my command would be turned at Minded and take the direct route to Campti, and thus be in time to operate against Banks' retreating column.

In the mean time orders were given to remove the obstructions in Red River and to float the pontoon bridge down to Campti. Banks was reported fortifying at Grand Escore; Steele about occupying our fortifications at Camden. Hid dislodgment was an absolute necessity. he threatened any movement down Red River against Banks. He held a strong base from which he could either united with Banks at Garand Ecore or by a short line of march occupy Shreveport and destroy our shops, depots, and supplies while the army was operating on Red River below.

The infantry passed through Shreveport on April 16. I moved in person to the neighborhood of General Price's headquarters. General Walker was halted at is camp, 19 miles from Minden, on April 20, 21, and 22. By reference to the map* you will see that this was the strategic point from which he could be thrown rapidly to Camden, Campti, or Shreveport. The fortifications at Camden were too strong to be taken by assault. A few day's delay in operations awaiting the arrival of the pontoon train was necessary. Minden, from its strategic position, was the point for detaining Walker during this delay.

On April 17, I made my headquarters near Calhoun, in telegraphic communication with Shreveport, and a few hours' distance from General Price by courier. He here submitted to me his proposed attack upon the enemy's train, which on April 18 resulted in the battle of Poison Springs, under General Maxey. On April 19, I found that General Price had not crossed any cavalry to the north side of the Arkansas River as directed, and that the day previous the enemy had received from Pine Bluff a commissary train of 200 wagons, guarded by an escort of 50 cavalry. I immediately organized an expedition of 4,000 picked cavalry, under General Fagan, who were ordered across the Ouachita, under instructions to destroy the supplies at Little Rock, Pine Bluff,a nd Devall's Bluff, and then throw himself between the enemy and Little Rock. The destruction of these depots would have insured the loss of Steele's entire army. Neither man nor beast could be sustained in the exhausted country between the Ouachita and White Rivers. The destruction of the enemy's entire supply train and the capture of its escort at Marks' Mills by General Fagan precipitated General Steele's retreat from Camden. He evacuated the place on the morning of April 27. By a force march of 42 miles we overtook him at Saline Bottom on the morning of April 30. Our troops marched through mud and raid during the previous night and attacked under great disadvantages-tired, exhausted, with mud and water up to their knees and waists. Marmaduke's bridge of cavalry, dismounted as skirmishers, opened the fight, and were hotly engaged through the morning. The battle closed at 1 o'clock, a complete victory; the enemy leaving his dead, wounded, wagons, &amp;c., on the field. The rise of the river, which flooded the bottom for some miles, and the exhausted condition
