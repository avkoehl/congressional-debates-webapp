The above comprises all of the batteries serving with General Homes' division in the field. There are a number of other batteries throughout the Department of North Carolina, but I have not received any returns from them since the division took the field. All of these batteries, excepting French's and Brem's, have only been under my command for a few days, so that the remarks regarding efficiency, &c., are necessarily more of less imperfect.

JAMES DESHLER,

Colonel and Chief of Artillery, Department of North Carolina.

[Indorsement.]
HEADQUARTERS ARTILLERY CORPS,July 22, 1862.

There is reason to believe that the two guns herein reported as lost from captain Graham's battery were not captured by the enemy, but secured by some company of our own. It is positively affirmed at the ordnance depot in Richmond that a brass 6-pounder, indubitably identified as Captain Graham's, was turned in there disabled, and has been subsequently readjusted and delivered to Captain Graham. Of the caissons and Parrot gun nothing is known; but if the 6-pounder was secured, they may have been. The enemy seem not to have occupied that position in force.

Respectfully submitted.

W. N. PENDLETON,

Brigadier-General and Chief of Artillery.
