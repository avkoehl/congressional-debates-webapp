Lieutenant WOODS,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General:

I have no news of the enemy. Do not know what Captain Cotter means; hope he may be sent for to explain to you. I have just ordered him to report here. A regiment of Ohio militia has passed here; others on the road. Shall I detain them, as previously ordered?

R. S. RODGERS,

Colonel.

Of course you will retain two regiments, and strictly obey the orders you have received.

Assistant Adjutant-General.

MARTINSBURG, May 13, 1864.

Captain H. M. BURLEIGH,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

I sent on the first regiment, meaning to retain the other two, which are on the road now; will be here to-night or to-morrow. I had ordered them to stop here. The cavalry to-day have scouted thoroughly to the front to North Mountain. There is no appearance of any enemy in that direction. I shall post part of the first regiment on the railroad. Four hundred men will be enough on the railroad to relieve my regiment, not including Duffield's Station.

R. S. RODGERS,

Colonel, Commanding.

Colonel WILKINSON,New Creek:

What re-enforcements have you received? What is the strength of the regiment? Have you cavalry?

Assistant Adjutant-General.
