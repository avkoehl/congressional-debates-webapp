which is a densely wooded thicket, but principally from the necessity of keeping a close connection, the omission to do which yesterday enabled the enemy to penetrate between the Sixth and Second Corps, taking the latter in reverse, and producing much confusion and disorder, the re-establishing order taking more time than would have been consumed if the connection had never been broken. Prisoners taken this morning report the enemy falling back last night, to what line they do not know, the presumption is to their fortifications; but I must watch my left flank carefully, as the more we envelop the enemy the further advanced the left is, and until we hold to the river my center and rear is greatly exposed. I have retained from Wilson's command a small force of cavalry to watch the left. Burnside reports an attack about 11 p.m. yesterday, which he repulsed. Burnside reports an attack about 11 p.m. yesterday, which he repulsed. His picket-line, he says, was at one point driven in, but quickly re-established. I am not able to judge of the practicability of holding to the river above till more information of the line held by the enemy is known, but from present appearance I infer we shall have to extend our right corps, Fifth and Ninth, more to the left and across the Jerusalem plank road to enable me to hold the river. I will keep you advised of anything occurring.

The Sentinel says a report was current in Richmond on Monday night that 3,000 of Hunter's men had been captured. The paper will be sent you. Nothing new since last dispatch from the lines.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

There is nothing new. The Sixth and Second Corps are endeavoring to get into position, but the character of the ground and the difficulty of insuring a co-operation has delayed the movement. Signal officers report the enemy moving to our left, possibly to attack Wright, possibly to occupy their works in anticipation of his advance. Wright's skirmishers have reached the Weldon railroad. Contrabands report the cars returning this a.m., Wilson having destroyed the road at Reams' Station. It is also reported that Lee's division of cavalry have gone after him. I have ordered the small cavalry force with me to endeavor to destroy still more of the road, and should Wright secure a position upon it I will set infantry at the same work. I am a little anxious about my left; we are so extended it gives the enemy a chance to mass at that point, and I have no re-enforcements to send. It at-
