Brigadier-General VAN VLIET,

Chief Quartermaster, Headquarters Army of the Potomac:

It is proposed to send troops from Alexandria to the Pamunkey. You will please dispatch, with all possible speed, steam vessels, or vessels towed by steam, to move a division of 5,000 men-artillery, infantry, cavalry, and baggage trains-from Alexandria. As dispatch is of the utmost importance, much should be sacrificed to collect ample means for this movement. The transportation available here is about enough for 3,000 men, without horses or baggage or artillery, and will be at Alexandria to-morrow. It is supposed that within forty-eight hours you can have a portion of the vessels now within the Department of Virginia for service at Alexandria.
