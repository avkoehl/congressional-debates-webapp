stroyed last fall by my forces, and nothing of consequence raised in vicinity of either place, they can't subsist, provided the river is guarded. I am advised by General Magruder that he has sent Colonel Brooks, with 1,000 men and two pieces of artillery, to the Arkansas for that purpose. If Brooks is fit for his post he has a splendid opening, and can do great service; if not, it will only be another failure. If he is any account, he will know of these movements and can advise General Magruder. I will send copy hereof to General Magruder by to-day's mail.

S. B. MAXEY,

Major-General.
