Major General A. J. SMITH,

Montgomery, Ala.:

General Hatch, from Eastport, will cover the country on the Mobile and Ohio Railroad as far south as Okolona, and on the Memphis and Charleston road as far east as Tuscumbia, with small posts fifty or sixty miles south of Tuscumbia and Iuka. Your command will probably extend as far east as the Chattahoochee. Make arrangements so as to connect with Wilson on the east and Hatch on the north. Report the dispositions you make you telegraph, so that I may, if necessary, replace some of your garrisons by troops from the Department of Mississippi. Keep in mind the reductions that will be made by discharges, and the consideration that your corps, with some addition of colored troops will probably have to garrison Mobile. The Thirteenth Corps will be required west of the Mississippi.

Major-General, Commanding.
