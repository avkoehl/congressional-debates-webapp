Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

Have been threatened with lung fever; now convalescing; hope out of danger. Doubtless the Cumberland can and should be made our line of supplies, but bullet-proof, light-draught, powerful steamboats should be used, such as one called the Meigs, built on the Kanawha in 1861, for quartermaster's use. No organized means exist, and the rebels are now concentrating a cavalry force behind the waters of the Harpeth, to cut off all our communication. I hope to defeat, and possibly destroy, them, by a force from Kentucky: but as to boats, you can see what we have from the Navy.

Their maintenance and police surveillance are essential to my lines of communication and the control of the contraband trade, and they ought to be under my command.
