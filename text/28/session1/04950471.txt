CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
4
cents; so that, in practice, liobody would send a letter
of an ounce weight, when a saving of five cents
could be effected by dividing it into two letters.
Mr. MERRICK explained that the object of the
committee was to obtain the most revenue by the
proposed arrangement, conceiving that when bank
notes are enclosed, the amount being generally valu-
able, as each quarter of an ounce of weight was
added, the additional postage would not be regarded
as onerous.
The point of the propriety of putting a different
ratio on additional weight beyond the first standard,
was debated by Messrs. MERRICK, WOODBU-
RY, EVANS, KING, and DAYTON, it being held
by some that the ratio ought to be the same; by
others, that the rate ought to decrease as the weight
increased; and by Mr. MERRICK, that the rate
ought to be higher as the weight increased. Finally
it was thought this was a point deserving more de-
liberation, and a general wish was expressed of hav-
ing time to consider it.
Mr. MERRICK observed that, as it was too late
to-day to proceed further, and as he should have oc-
casion to leave the District on business for a few
days, he hoped the bill would be laid over till his
return.
On motion, the further consideration of the sub-
ject was postponed to Monday next.
The Senate then adjourned.

TERRITORIAL BUSINESS.
On the motion of Mr. HOUSTON, the House re-
solved itself into Committee of the Whole on the
state of the Union, (Mr. White in the chair,)
for the purpose of proceeding with the consideration
of bills relating to the Territories.
The following were taken up, and after being con-
sidered, were laid aside to be reported to the House:
A bill for the benefit of James Anderson, of the
Territory of Iowa.
A bill providing for a mrrine hospital at Key
West, m Florida.
A bill granting to the Territory of Wisconsin a

ment of Grant river, at the town of Potosi, m Wis-
consin Territory.
A bill to authorize the allowance recommended by

sentatives of said Territory.
A bill to authorize the legislatures of the several

tation, and for other purposes.
A bill to confirm to the city of Fernandina, in
Florida, certain lots reserved for public use by the
Spanish government.
A bill to amend an act entitled m act to provide
for the armed occupation and settlement of the unj
settled part of the peninsula of Florda.
A bill to confirm certain entries of land in the St.
Augustine land district, in the Territory; of Florida,
made under the act of 22d of June, 1838.
The bill to provide payment for the militia of
Iowa who were called into service in the year 1839,
was taken up.
Mr. A. C. DODGE addressed the committee in
support of the bill.
Mr. CAVE JOHNSON replied.
On the motion of Mr. WELLER, the committee
rose and reported the bills to the House, and the
question recurred on the engrossment. They were
all ordered to be engrossed, and were read a third
time and passed, with the exception of the bill pro-
viding for the payment of the Iowa militia, and the
bill authorizing allowances to officers of the Florida
legislature.
On motion of Mr. C. JOHNSON, it was
Resolved, That on Thursday next, at 2 o'clock, all debate
shall cease upon the bill making retrenchments m the army;
and that the House shall proceed to vote upon the amend-
ments (if any) to be reported by the committee.
Mr. C. JOHNSON then moved that the House
resolve itself into Committee of the Whole on the
state of the Union, with the view of taking up that
bill.
Mr. RATHBUN gave notice that he would, to-
morrow, move a reconsideration of the vote by
which the bill (No. 302) to amend the act entitled
"An act to provide for the armed occupation of
Florida" was passed.
The House then resolved itself into Committee of
the Whole on the state of the Union.
The gentleman from Kentucky, [Mr. G, Davis,]
who was entitled to the floor upon the bill making
retrenchments in the army, being at the moment ab-
sent, that bill was laid aside temporarily, and
The committee, on motion of Mr. JAMESON,
took up bill No. 19, reported from tho Committee
on Military Affairs, making appropriations for the
payment oflosses by the Missouri volunteers in the
Florida war.
Mr. HARDIN said he had reported this bill by
the direction of the Committee on Military Affairs,
and it was intended to be confined to the losses sus-
tained by the Missouri volunteers; but it appeared
that it would', in its present shape, extend to other
cases. He therefore proposed the following pro-
viso:
Provided, That the provisions of this act shall be applica-
ble to the Missouri volunteers alone.
Mr. COBB asked the gentleman to give some rea-
son why the benefits of this act should not be ex-
tended to all volunteers who had sustained losses.
This sort of legislation appeared to him partial in
the extreme.
Mr. HARDIN said an appropriation was made
in 1838 for the specific purpose of paying the Mis-
souri volunteers their losses, and the present act was
merely intended as a reappropriation of the money,
which had reverted to the treasury in consequence
of some difficulty having arisen in carrying out the
provisions of the appropriation. The chairman of
the Military Committee had examined the subject
fully, and had come to the conclusion that it was not
aer that the provisions of the act should be ex-
3d beyond the direction originally given to
them
Mr. CHAPMAN observed that he saw no reason
for offering the amendment, as the bill, without the
proviso, would not extend to other cases. For his
part, he was just at the point of offering an amend-
ment, to make the bill apply to the cases of volun-
teers from other States; for there were one or two
provisions m it that applied only to those of Mis-
souri. One of these provisions was, that the lost
horses should be paid for at their appraised value at
the time they were taken into service; whereas
there was no fixed value for the lost horses of the
Alabama volunteers, but they were paid for at an
arbitrary value, fixed at the departments. The de-
cision was that no horse should be paid for more,
than a certain sum, no matter what his value might
be. His object, therefore, was to offer an amend-
ment to make the bill apply to the volunteers of
other States, as well as those of Missouri.
Mr. JOHN W. DAVIS offered an amendment to
provide payment for horses lost by the rangers of
Indiana in the Black Hawk war.
Mr. D. said that, in the year 1837 or 1838, there
was a general law on this subject passed, which
emanated from the Committee of Claims, of which
he was then a member. Mr. Whittlesey, of Ohio,
