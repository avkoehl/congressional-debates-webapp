a suggestion to the House, and to the chairman
of the Committee on Territories?
[Cries of " Yes !" "Yes!"]
The SPEAKER. A great many members
upon this floor hare bills which they wish to intro-
duce or report for reference only. It would be a
great relief to them, and to the Chair, if those bills
could be run off this morning, provided they give
rise to no debate, and with the understanding that
they are not to be brought back by motion to
reconsider, and put upon their passage.
Mr. RICHARDSON. Mr. Speaker, I am
anxious, for one, to progress as rapidly as pos-
sible with the territorial business. Lam aware
of the desire of gentlemen to introduce bills for
reference, and shall gratify them so far a3 I am
able to. With unanimous consent, I propose
that a short time this morning be set apart for the
reception of bills for reference only.
The SPEAKER. Say twenty minutes.
Mr. JONES, of Tennessee. I do not object,
provided the understanding is that the bills are not
again to be brought before us by motion for recon-
r sideration.
The SPEAKER. Is there objection to the
proposition ?
There was no objection.
Mr. HOUSTON. Mr. Speaker, I have endea-
vored, for the last two or three weeks, to get an
opportunity for calling up the bill which pro-
poses to modify the existing tariff. That there
may be no misunderstanding, I propose now to
give notice in the House that, if I can get the door
on next Thursday, I shall move to go into the
Committee of the Whole on the state of the Union,
for the purpose of taking up and considering that
bill. I feel itdue,aa well to those who oppose the
measure as to those who favor it, to make this
public announcement in advance, so that all who
desire to vote upon it may be present when the
question is taken. If the House agree with me,
1 shall ask that the vote on the motion to go into
the committee be considered a test. If the vote
be adverse ,to the motion, I shall then ask the
House to proceed to the consideration of other
billsâ€”considering the vote as conclusive that the
subject wilftiot be touched during this session.

understood was to be received.

anything to come in which may give rise to debate.

Mr. RICHARDSON. I rise to a question of
I order. 1 understood the agreement was that gen-
I tlemen were to waive the opportunity for intro-
l ducing bills which they desired to get before the
i House for consideration. If these reports are
allowed to consume the time set apart for that
purpose, I may as well now move that the rules
be suspended, and that the House resolve itself

the Union. Let the committees wait to submit
their reports in regular order.
