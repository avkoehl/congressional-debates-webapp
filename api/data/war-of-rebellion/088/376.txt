AUGUST 21, 1864.

Captain NORTON:

Rebel message received at 2.20 p.m.:

O. O. and Colonel B.:

The enemy was driven from Wedlon road. We are still pursuing him.

O.,

At B.

Send to Lieutenant-General Grant.

B. F. BUTLER.

CITY POINT, VA., August 21, 1864.

Major-General BUTLER,

Commanding,&amp;c.:

The last dispatch from General Warren was dated at 11 a.m. He then stated that the enemy had attacked from the north and west, but were, too, easily repulsed. We did not get them close enough for his fire to have full effect. He captured, however, 400 prisoners that he know of. I hope there is a mistake in the intercepted signal.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

CITY POINT, VA., August 21, 1864-1 p.m.

Major-General BUTLER,

Commanding,&c.:

The enemy is evidently massing everything he can to drive our troops form the Weldon road. To do this he is undoubtedly leaving his intrenched lines almost to their own care. Have a reconnaissance made, and if, with the Tenth Corps, you can break through, do it.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

AUGUST 21, 1864-2 p.m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

General Birney and myself are at this moment consulting upon the movement which you suggest, and will try and do it to-morrow morning. If we do anything I must have all the batteries I have left. I have but seven in all on the line and in reserve on this side of the river. Will send the one at Spring Hill to Ord. General Hancock has twelve.

BENJ. F. BUTLER.

CITY POINT, VA., August 21, 1864-3.50 p.m.

Major-General BUTLER,

Commanding,&c.;

The operator at General Warren's headquarters, this moment, in reply to a question from me says every attack of the enemy has been repulsed, and Warren's position is now stronger than ever.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
