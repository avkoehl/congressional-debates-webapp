ANNUAL POST ROUTE DILL.
Mr. FARNSWORTH. I ask unanimous
consent to report back from the Committee
on the Post Office and Post Roads the Senate
amendments to House bill No. 028, to establish
certain post roads, with the recommendation
that they bo concurred in with certain amend-
ments, embracing only post routes asked for
by members of the House. There is nothing
of general legislation in the bill; nothing but
the usual provision for post routes.
There was no objection, and the amendments
to the amendments were adopted, and the Sen-
ate amendments, as amended, were then con-
curred in.
SUPREME COURT OF TIIE UNITED STATES.
Mr. BOUTWELL. I ask unanimous con-
sent to report back with amendment from the
Committee on the Judiciary House bill No.
861, relating to the Supreme Court of the
United Stales.
The bill was read. It provides that in case
of the removal of the Chief Justice of the Su-
preme Court of the United States from office,
or of his death, resignation, or inability to dis-
charge the powers and duties of the said office,
the same shall devolve upon the associate jus-
tice of said court whose commission is senior
in time; and such associate justice shall be
Chief Justice of such court until such inability
shall be removed, or another appointment shall
be duly made, and the Chief Justice of said
court shall be duly qualified.
The amendment reported by the committee
was to strike out the words "and such associate
justice shall be Chief Justice of such court."
The amendmentof the committee was agreed
to.
Mr. BOUTWELL. I demand the previous
question.
The previous question was seconded and the
main question ordered ; and under the opera-
tion thereof the bill, as amended was ordered
to be engrossed and read a third time; and be-
ing engrossed, it was accordingly read the third
time, and passed.
Mr. BOUTWELL moved to reconsider the
vote by which the bill was passed ; and also
moved that the motion to reconsider be laid on
the table.
The latter motion was agreed to.

imous consent to offer the following resolution :

to inform this House of tho names of all special
agents of the Post Office Departmen t, the place whero
such agents are employed, the rate at which they are
paid; and also the nauies of all persons to whom
special-agent commissions have been issued of a'
complimentary character, and the reasons for grant-
ing such complimentary commissions since January
1, 1867.
Mr. LAWRENCE, of Pennsylvania. I sug-
gest to the gentleman that ho had better mod-
ify the resolution.
Mr. WASHBURN, of Indiana. I demand
the previous question.
The previous question was seconded and the
main question ordered; and under the opera-
tion thereof the resolution was adopted.
Mr. WASHBURN, of Indiana, moved to
reconsider the vote by which the resolution was
adopted; and also moved that the ihotion to
reconsider be laid on the table.
The latter motion was agreed to.
FRBEDMEN'S BUREAU.
The House resumed the consideration of the
bill (II. R. No. 598) to continue the Bureau for
the relief of Freedmen and Refugees, and for
other purposes, pending at the close of the
morning hour on Tuesday last, on which Mr.
Eliot was entitled to the floor.
Mr. ELIOT. Mr. Speaker, I have taken
the floor at this time for the purpose of calling
the previous question on the bill which has
been considered in the morning hour for two
or three days. I suppose it is proper that I
should first withdraw the motion to recommit
which is pending. I accordingly withdraw it,
and demand the previous question. I will
state that I have promised to assign to the
gentleman from New York [Mr. Wood] thj/ty
minutes of the hour which belongs to me, with
the right to assign it as he sees fit to his friends
on the other side.
The previous question was seconded and the
main question ordered.
Mr. WOOD. I yield to thegentleman from
Now Jersey, [Mr. Haight.]
Mr. HAIGHT. I simply ask leave to pre-
sent the petition of officers and soldiers of the
State of New Jersey, against the passage of
this bill, and ask its reference to the Committee
on Military Affairs.
The petition was referred accordingly.
Mr. WOOD. Mr. Speaker, this is a bill to
continue the Freedmen's Bureau. It will be
recollected that the original act creating this
bureau was passed in March, 1865. The ori-
ginal act terminated the existence of the bureau
in one year after the cessation of hostilities.
Subsequently, in 1866, another act was passed
continuing in force the bureau for an additional
period of two years, and adding very largely
to the powers of tho bureau as originally given.
The present bill proposes to continue the bu-
reau for a period of nearly a year and a half
beyond the present time, to devote the unex-
pended balances to educational purposes, and
to add very largely to the powers of tho Secre-
tary of War and of tho Commissioner of Freed-
men's Affairs.
It will be recollected that the immediate
cause for the passage of the original act was
the then condition of the slaves who were about
to become freedmen under the operation of
our military power. As the Union Armymade
its progress into the insurgent States, and as
it obtained and held possession of the enemy's
territory and property, it necessarily freed,
practically at least, a very large number of
those who were then slaves. These colored
people, of course, naturally came into our lines.
They sought protection from the military au-
thorities; they were doubtless encouraged to
do so, until, as we gradually obtained and held
permanently a very large portion of the enemy's
