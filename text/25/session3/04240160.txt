Naval Appropriations—Mr. Peti ilfin.
Ho. of Reps.
are not prepared to yield to the policy of import-
ing; the chains and gags of the legislation of Great
Britain to manacle and fetter the free citizens of
this country The free and honest exercise of the
right of suffrage ought not to be abridged, shackled,
or fettered by Federal legislation, noi shoulj any
class of cit zens be rendered odious by jealous dis
tinctipns The committee can perceive no reason
for the adoption by Congress of any restriction
upon any of what they deem the inestimable and
unalienable rights of every class of citizens, merely
because they have been honoied with the confi-
dence of the people. They know no objection to
reason, argument, or even persuasion, by word,
message, or writing, either before or after an
election, from whomsoever it may proceed, or by
■whatever motive prompted Nor do they under
stand on what just principles it can be maintained
that the possession of office simply should deprive
a citizen of the influence arising from character,
intelligence, integrity, and the confidence which
they inspire, and of the right to use it as others
are left free to use theirs The committee can find
no scales in the Constitution in which to weigh
the relative patriotism, integrity,and independence
of the functionaries of the Federal or State Gov
ernments, and the officers of corporations, or the
employers of individuals They cannot believe
that the employe* of the Federal Government are
more coirupt or corrupting than the emyloyes of
other bodies corporate 01 politic, or of individuals
They are satisfied that the best corrective of any
abuse of the freedom or purity of elections by the
officers designated, in the manner rendeied penal
by this bill, even if any such exists, will be found
in an enlightened public opinion, which, sooner
or later, depends upon the legitimate moral force
of truth, and the influence of isason and fatrnrgu-
ment, irrespective of mere official authority So
far, they believe the experience of the working of
our institutions has proved the truth of the ajnorri
of the great apostle of Democracy, that " error of
opinion may always be safely tolerated, where
reason is left free to combat it " They can find
no justification of the policy or justice of restrain
ing, bylaw, the unlimited liberty of the exercise
of the freedom of speech or of the press by every
class of citizens, whether in or out of office, than
such as in other countries has prompted the estab
lishment of political or religious inquisitions,
snalogous to the tendencies of this bill, which are
alike at war with expenence, the spirit of the age,
and the genius of oui institutions But if any mis
chief has arisen or may anse from this sourte, the
legitimate remedy must be sought and found in
the legislation of the several States, whose con
siitutional duty it is to prescribe the privileges and
immunities of their citizens, fiee from the control
of Federal legislation
But whatever may be the opinion entertained,
ns to the policy of this law, the committee are of
opinion that the remedy proposed is unconstitu-
tional The second section of the first aiticle of
the Constitution declares that the members of the
House of "Representatives shall be chosen "by the
' people of the States, who shall have the qual fica
'tions requisite for electors of the most numerous
'branch of the State Legislature " Andbvnrticle
necond, section first, declares that electors of Pres
ident and Vice President "shall be appointed in
such manner as the State Legislatures may direct,"
and the second section of tie fourth article of the
Constitution declares that the citizens of each State
"'shall be entitled to all the privileges and immuni-
ties of citizens in the several States " Congress,
therefore, have no right to intermeddle, by law,
in prescribing the qualifications of electors or the
mode of conducting elections of members of the
House of Representatives, or electors of President
and Vice President, noi m respect to the privilege
or immunities of a cm-en of a State, that right
belongs exclusively to the States, and is by the
Constitution withheld from the Federal Govern
tnent It is difficult to perceive upon what con
stitutional grantof power the right to prescribe the
qualifications of electors, and the mode of conduct-
ing State elections for State officers, can be sus-
tained,and the committee cannot find any warrant
in that instrument for its assumption by Congress
But if any doubt upon this subject could exist-
it la dispelletjby the first artieleof the amendments
to the Constitution, which declares that " Con-
'gress shall make no law respecting an estabhsh-
' ment of religion, or the free exercise thereof, or
'abridging the freedom of speech or of the press,
' or of the right of the people peaceably to assem-
' ble to petition the Government for the redress of
'grievances " The committee believe that the
powersof the Fedeial Government result from the
Constitution, and are limited by the plain sense
and intention of that instrument, and that the State
sovereignties are only diminished by powers spe-
cifically enumerated or necessary to carry the
specified f owers into effect, and that theStates, by
the Constitution, retained to themselves the right
of protecting the freedom of religious principles,
and of judging how far the licentiousness of
speech and of the press may be abridged without
lessening their useful freedom, and how far the
abuses which cannot be separated fiom their use
shculd be tolerated, rather than the Ose be de
stroyed The freedom of religion, of speech, and
of the press, and of the right of the people peace-
! ably to assemble and petition for the redi ess of
gnevances, is withdrawn in express terms, from
the poweis of the Federal Government     It is
I deemed unnecessary by the committee to attempt
to demonstrate these propositions They have
already been done by the resolutions of the Vir-
ginia Legislature in 1798, 1799, and 1800, and the
íesolutions of the Legislature of Kentucky in 1798
and 1799 The provisions of this bill aie, in the
opinion of the committee, more clearly unconsti-
tutional than those of the alien and sedition laws,
their tendency is more clearly and unequivocally
to abridge the freedom of speech, of the liberty of
thepress,and of thenghtof peaceably assembling
It is true it is confined to a particular class, cer-
tain designated officers under the Federal Govern-
ment, but it will hardly be seriously contented that
this makes any essential difference If you may
lawfully abridge the freedom intended to be granted
by the Constitution to all, by laws embracing only
a portion, you may thus proceed until all are
finally depnved of their rights
Under every aspect that the committee have been
able to view the provisions of this bill, it appears
to them that it is unjiiRt, unequal, impracticable,
impolitic, tyrannical, and unconstitutional tftatit
is founded on an assumption of power by the
Federal Government not granted by the Oonsti
tution, and destructive of the rights of the several
independent States composing the Union, and of
the constitutional rights of the citizens of those
States, and that its provisions are of a most alarm-
ing and dangerous tendency—not called for by
any existing mischief, and would not afford an
appropriate remedy if such mischief existed
They, therefore, respectfully report the said bill,
without amendment, and recommend that the same
should not be passed
NA\Y APPROPRIATIONS
REMARKS OF HON D PETRIKIN,
of pennsylvania,
In the House op Representatives,
February 15,1839,
In the Committee of the Whole, on the motion to
strike out the appropriation for the Board of
Navy Commissioners, and in reply to the re-
marks of Mr Adams
Mr PETRIKIN said
Mr Chairman As to the propriety or expe-
diency of abolishing the Board of Commissioners
of the Navy at this time, there may be some little
doubt, but there can be no doubt that a reorgan-
ization of the v. hole Navy Department is absolute-
ly necessary The Board of Navy Commissioners
has, from its first organization,acted asan incubus
on the Navy, this is a matter of history, and can
not be denied This board has become odious
to the people, and in every quarter of the coun-
try the people are complaining of it This alone
ought to be sufficient cause for abolishing the
board The people in this country are sovereign,
and if an office or any branch of the Government
becomes odious or obnoxious to them, we, as
their Representatives, ought at once to abolish the
office, or reorganize the obnoxious branch of the
Government As to the suggestion by the gentle-
man from Kentucky, [Mr Williaivis,] that the
present head of the Executive Department is
Odious to the people, it is not the case, and is con
tradicted by facts The people have, on several
occasions, and some of them very recently,
declared themselves satisfied with the general pun-
ciples the present Executive has acted upon in the
administration of the Government, and the people
will advocate and approve of hisadministration as
long as he acts on those general principles, which
they consider necessary for the preservation of the
Constitution and liberties of the country But they
do not approve of many of those who are kept in
office Was the will of the people obeyed, the
President would sweep out of the Departments in
this city, a horde of officers and clerks of the same
political party of the gentleman, (who has volun-
teered the suggestion I allude to,) who are truly
odious to a large majontyof the people So much
for the suggestion of thegentleman from Kentucky.
We are told the Board of Commissioners of the
Navy was created at the close of the last war with
Great Britain, to remedy evils that were discov-
eied during the war in the organization of our
Navy But the true reason is the scene we see
every session of Congress in every department of
this Government—a disposition to create offices
and officers, and to furnish salaries to enable men
to live in ease and affluence, under the pretext of
doing service to the country We heard of no
deficiency in the organization of our Navy Depart-
ment during the war On the contrary, our Navy,
for the number of vessels and size, excelled that
of all others in the known world for discipline and
bravery Italy had its Capua, so has the United
States Idleness, luxury, and dissipation, has a
tendency to enervate and debilitate both body and
mind We are told of the preeminent services of
those who have composed the Board of Navy
Commissioners, and that they are high minded,
honorable men This may be, and is, no doubt,
all true I do not know them, nor have I heard
any charges made against them as individuals It
is not my intention to say aught disrespectful of
the individuals who now fill the offices of that
board, and 1 have no doubt they have, in times
past, rendered service to the country, but, sir, the
man who would come to this place, or any other
of the cities of the Union, and live five or six years
in idleness and luxury, without becoming debili-
tated in body and mind, must be an exception to
the rest of mankind The history of the world
proves what I assert to be true And does age,
and the natural debility consequent to that stage
of life, tend to lessen the debility produced by
dinner parties and dissipation >
We were told yesterday by a gentleman of long
experience in government, from Massachusetts,
[Mr Adams,] that men who represented people
residing m inland districts, had no right to express
opinions here relative to the organization of the
Navy Departmen t, and that he was surprised that a
gentleman [Mr Crarv, of Michigan] should have
made the motion to strike out this appropriation,
who had not a sea-port in all his State I came to
Congress under the impression that each member
had an equal right to express his opinions in rela-
tion to every branch of this Government, and to
find fault or approve as he thought the merits of the
case required I was aware that the gentleman
from Massachusetts acted with a party, the leaders
of which would, if in their power, deprive us of
that equal right, but I had not heard it before open-
ly avowed on this floor I can tell the gentleman
from Massachusetts that the constituents of mem-
bers who represent inland districts and have " no
sea ports," during the war of 1812, rejoiced when
they heard of the victories achieved by ourNavy,
not only by words, but also by acts Tney will
ingly submitted to pay every species of tax, direct
and indirect, to support the Navy then, and ar"e will-
ing now to do the same, when the honor and safety
of thecountry require it But, when the constitu-
ents of those whom the gentleman from Massachu-
setts says have no right to interfere with the Navy
were rejoicing at its victories, the gentleman's con-
stituents, and their representatives in their State
Legislature, were passing resolves "that it did not
btcome a rooraZ and rchgwmpcople to rejoice oí the mo-
