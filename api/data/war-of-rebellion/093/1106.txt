By order of the Secretary of War:

E. D. TOWNSEND,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

NEAR COLUMBIA, November 28, 1864 - 8.45 a. m.

Major-General THOMAS,

Nashville:

GENERAL: My troops and material are all on the north side of Duck River; the withdrawal was completed at daylight this morning without serious difficulty. Cox holds the ford in front of Columbia, and Ruger the railroad bridge, which I partially destroyed. Stanley is going into position a short distance in rear of Cox. I think I can now stop Hood's advance by any line near this, and meet in time any distant movement to turn my position. I regret extremely the necessity of withdrawing from Columbia, but believe it was absolute; I will explain fully in time. Re-enforcements will have to march from Spring Hill or Thompson's Station. Supplies should be sent to Thompson's Station.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.

NEAR COLUMBIA, November 28, 1864 9 a. m.

Major-General THOMAS,

Nashville:

I am in doubt whether it is advisable, with reference to future operations, to hold this position or to retire to some point from which we can move offensively. Of course we cannot secure* the river here. I could easily have held the brigade-head at the railroad, but it would have been useless, as we could not possibly advance from that point. Please give me your views and wishes.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.

NEAR COLUMBIA, November 28, 1864 - 9.10 a. m.

Major-General THOMAS,

Nashville:

I have all the fords above and below this place well watched and guarded as far as possible. Wilson is operating with his main force on my left. The enemy does not appear to have moved in that direction yet to any considerable distance. I will probably be able to give you pretty full information this evening. Do you not think the infantry at the distant crossings below here should now be withdrawn and cavalry
