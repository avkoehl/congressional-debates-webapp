Honorable WILLIAM H. SEWARD,

Auburn, N. Y.:

The following telegram has just been received from General Dix, and is referred to you for such action as you deem proper:

NEW YORK, November 6, 1864.

Honorable EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

I am advised by the mayor of Buffalo that the propeller Georgiana is arming on the Canadian shore, on Lake Erie, for the purpose of encountering the steamer Michigan, and for piratical or predatory enterprises on the frontier. Ought not the Canadian authorities to be called on to arrest this proceeding?

JOHN A. DIX,

Major-General.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

WAR DEPARTMENT,

November 6, 1864.

Major-General DIX,

New York:

The contents of your dispatch of this date have been forwarded to Mr. Seward, at Auburn, to be communicated to the Canadian authorities. It is not likely that they will take any steps toward preserving the peace. You must take your own measures, without reference to them. General Grant telegraphs that all the troops required have gone forward, and it seems to me you and General Butler ought to be able to take care of Jake Thompson and his gang.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.
