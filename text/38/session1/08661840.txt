THE UOXOliESSlONAL GLOBE.
April 25.
can then <ro buck and reverse the decision made
last evening.
This is tin interest as yet in its infancy; and by
imposing a tux upon crude petroleum we are put-
ting sue!) a tax upon the small operators who are
boring for this article in all the country where it
is to be found as wili compel them to abandon
the pursuit.
It has been stated that this article was recently
discovered in Michigan; but before this rebellion
there were a number of wells in West Virginia.
They me not operated now for the reason tl^at
people cannot gel to "them, so as to operate them
profitably. By imposing a tax upon eiude ne- ;
troleum you are directly placing a heavy burden |
upon those men in my district,and in the district i
of my colleague, [Mr. Scofield,] who are boring ;
into the bowels of the earth to limit this oil which
is to make the faces of Congressmen '-very- 1
body else shine. [Laughter.] j
Now, sir, had the Committee of Ways and J
Means left the bill as it was, imposing a duty of '
twenty cents a gallon on refined oil, neither I nor •
any ot her person who represents this interest here ;
would have been so persistent in our efforts. It
is no captious spirit which induccs us to ask this i
small favor for these small operators. We ask
it in the interest of the Government, ho that the ;
Government shall lose no revenue. If you im- !
pose a tax of fifteen cents a gallon on the refined \
article theconsnmption will be much greater, and i
the Government will deiive more revenue.
I ask the committee, then, to make this article
ofcrude petroleum exempt in this scction; it comes
in appropriately before " whaleand fish oil;"and
then we can go back to the oth,er section and strike
out the exorbitant tax there imposed. These
w< i!s are discovered principally in vaiievs. Some
of them produce one barrel a day and somi1 of
them pioduce a thousand barrels a day, but the
small 
[Here the hammer fell.] *
Mr. KERNAN. It seems to me that we
should not now exempt crude petroleum. This
tax does notcomS out of the man who digs the
well but out ot the consumer,and certainly if we
should tax it in any form we may tax it in the
crude form. This is a low tax, and I think it
should be adopted, so as not to hnv< peuohum
go abioad free of taxation.
Mr. SCOFIELD. I ask my colleague to with-
draw his amendment.
Mi. ANCONA. 1 object, and call for a di-
vision .
The amendment was rejected.
Mr. STEVENS. I move toamend by striking
out of the ninety-fifth section the wouis "steel
who, rolled, tempered, or covered," so as not to
exempt those articles from duty.
The amendment was agreed to.
Mr. ANCONA. I move that th" committee
do now iise.
The motion was not agreed to.

Mr. HOTCHKISS. 1 move to amend by add-

The amendment was r< jected.
Mr. RANDALL, of Pennsylvania, T move to
amend the seoiion by striking out " t-ne fourth of
one per cent.," and inserting in lieu thereof" one
eighth of one p^r cent." I tlnnlc the tax is rather
excessive ps against auctioneeis.
The amendment was rejected.
Mr. STKVENiS. I think that, gentleman on
the other side are somewhat anxious to get home.
I therefore move that the committee do now rise.
The motion wr>s not agreed to.
Mr. NORTON, i move to gimend the section
by striking out. the whole proviso. 1 cannot see
why a man who holds a mortgage or trust upon
property should not be compeleld to pay duty
upon the sales of such propcity the same as a
man who sells his own property.
The amendment Wos rejocttd.
Mr. A. MYERS. ] nnne that the committee
do now rise.
The motion whs agreed to.
So the committee rose; and tho Speaker having
resumed the chair, Mi. Wasiiburke, of Illinois,
reported that the (atmmi?tee of the Whole on the
state of the Union had had under consideration,
as a special order, the internal revenue bill, and
had come to no conejusion thereon.
And 'then, on motion of Mr. ANCONA, (at
five o'clock, p. m.,) the liou^e adjourned until
Monday next at twelve o'clock, noon.
