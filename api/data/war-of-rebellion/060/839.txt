HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,April 11, 1864-7 p. m.

COMMANDING OFFICER SECOND CORPS:

Lieutenant-General Grant went to Washington this afternoon. I presume he will not be back before day after to-morrow. I will let you know when he returns.

S. WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS CAVALRY CORPS,April 11, 1864.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff, Army of the Potomac:

A regiment from General Kilpatrick's division has taken post at Grove Church and will scout to United States Ford and in the direction of Stafford Court-House. A regiment from General Gregg has taken post at Morrisville and will scout to Tackett's Mills and White Bridge. These dispositions and scouting parties, with General Gregg's division at Warrenton, should obviate the necessity of keeping the regiment now scattered along the railroad on duty there. I respectfully request that it be relieved and ordered to report to General Gregg.

P. H. SHERIDAN,

Major-General.

[Indorsement.]

Cavalry on railroad to remain. That at Morrisville may be withdrawn, if desired.

Major General F. SIGEL,

Cumberland, Md.:

I have directed the Thirty-sixth Ohio to be ordered to General Crook. If I can send you an engineer officer in place of Lieutenant Meigs, I will do so. If one is not sent, exercise your own judgment about letting him go into the field.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
