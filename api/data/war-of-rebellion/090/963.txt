Major G. G. HORTON,

Commanding Sixteenth New York Cavalry:

MAJOR: You will proceed with your command immediately, and without stopping to get rations or forage, direct to Gum Spring, and there endeavor to join Major Waite, Eighth Illinois Cavalry. If you do not find him, go on to Aldie; and if you do not there meet him, push on still further, and as long as there remains a probability of overtaking his party with safety to your own. You will find Captain Washburne, of your regiment, at either Gum Spring or Aldie, with rations and forage for you for three days. The inclosed instructions are for your information. Major Waite will leave Gum Spring to-day at 10 o'clock on his way to Aldie. In order to make sure of finding Major Waite, it would be well to send some couriers ahead to let him know of your coming. Lose no time in getting started from this camp.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

EDWIN Y. LANSING,

First Lieutenant and Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
