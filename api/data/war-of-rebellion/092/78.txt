Lieutenant Sherfy, however, was retained, and many important messages transmitted until the evening of the 22d, when, by order of the general commanding, it was broken up and the officers withdrew to their respective detachments.

I have the honor to be, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

We took from Atlanta as follows: Hard bread, 15 days; fresh beef, 10 days; sugar, 15 days; coffee, 25 days; salt, 60 days.

It was thirty-four days from the time we left Atlanta until we received stores, which would give the following amount of subsistence taken from the country for 35,000 men:

I would respectfully call your attention to the very imperfect coopering of packages containing stores. When they are to be transported over long and rough roads by wagons, the boxes of hard bread should be bound with iron hoops or hickory witches, and sugar should be put in substantial barrels.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

D. REMICK,

Lieutenant Colonel and Chief Com. of Sub. Dept. and Army of the Tenn.

Major General O. O. HOWARD.
