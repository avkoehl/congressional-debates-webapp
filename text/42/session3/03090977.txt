Mr. CONKLING. I ask the attention of
the Senate for one moment, and only one mo-
ment. I introduced an amendment, which was
printed as having been introduced by the Sen-
ator from Rhode Island, [Mr. Anthony,] to
increase by two or three hundred dollars the
pay of one of the doorkeepers, Mr. Christie;
I may name him. I am told that the form of
that amendment is such as to admit of some
possible doubt as to whom it was applicable,
and therefore I wish to say in the presence of
my honorable friend from Maine, and of the
Senator from South Carolina, who from the
committee offered the amendment, that there
need be no misunderstanding about it, that
the amendment was offered and was reported
as applicable to Mr. Christie. I name him so
that there need be no misapprehension by any-
body hereafter as to who was intended.
Mr. BAYARD. And it was so voted for.
Mr. CONKLING-. And it was so voted for,
as the Senator from Delaware suggests.
The bill was passed.
