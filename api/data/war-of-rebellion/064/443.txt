What information I have of Shelby you have got from Colonel Livingston, First Nebraska, now in Saint Louis. Please see him. He stated to me that Shelby was at Batesville with 2,500 men and four rifled pieces, and another force ranging from month of White River to Pocahontas, about 1,200 or 1,500 strong, contemplating move into Missouri.

Do this without delay, unless you see some sufficient reason why it should not be done, in which case advise me.
