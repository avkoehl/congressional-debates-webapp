"lapping" appropriations heretofore made
that will not be expended until next year,
namely, $'2-1,609,184, making a total probable
expenditure, during the next fiscal year, for
which revenue must be provided, of $352,320,-

EEYEXUE.
To meet the above estimate for expendi-
tures the following receipts may be estimated :
Customs  £105,000,000
It is difficult to imagine a contingency which
shall, for the present, reduce the customs
receipts below the above figures. If the aver-
age annual gold value of imports into the
United States (exclusive of specie) for the
last five years, and the present tariff be main-
tained, an annual gold revenuefrom thecustoms
in excess of $165,000,000 is absolutely certain ;
and if the tariff is reduced, an increase of
importations is likely to far more than com-
pensate for any reduction of rate—inasmuch
as the duties on some classes of products,
formerly of extensive importation, are at pres-
ent nearly or quite prohibitory.
INTERNAL KEVEXUE.
The receipts of internal revenue for the
current fiscal year ending June 30, 1888, will,
as already stated, approximate and probably
slightly exceed, $190,000,000.
The internal revenue derived from manu-
factured articles or products on which the taxes
have been abated or repealed since the com-
mencement of the last fiscal year (July 1, I860)
yielded for the same fiscal year (ending June
30, 1867) the sum of $87,214,275; of which
amount $23,769,080 were derived from the tax
on raw cotton. As many of the taxes upon
which this sum was raised were repealed by the
Thirtv-Ninth Congress during the course of the
last fiscal year, and have not been operative
during tlie'current fiscal year, it would be erro-
neous to assume that the sum of 887,244,275
represents the reduction of internal revenue
likely to be experienced for the next fiscal year
in consequence of the repeal by the present
Congress of nearly all of theso-called "man-
ufacturers' taxes" and of the tax upon raw
cotton. On the contrary, the reduction legit-
imately to be anticipated will be considerably
less; and, as deduced from an examination of
the receipts of internal revenue since July 1,
1867, and assuming the passage of the bill as
reported from the Committee of Ways and
Means without essential modifications, will be
substantially as follows : From the act of Feb-
ruary 3, 1808, repealing the tax on raw cotton,
$23,769,000; from the act of March 31, exempt-
ing certain manufactures from internal fax,
(including the abatement of taxes on gas and
petroleum,)$45,000,000. Total, $08,769,000.
The revenue, therefore, from internal taxes for
the next fiscal year, assuming all other matters
in respect to taxes and administration in this
branch of tho revenue "service tb remain un-
changed, must necessarily be predicated on the
basis of the aggregate receipts of the-current
fiscal year, less the amount of taxes abated or
repealed during the present session of Congress,
or 8190,000,000—$08,709,000=$121,231,000.
That the present state of affairs is wholly
exceptional cannot be doubted ; neither does
it seem possible that fraud and neglect cart
again reduce the receipts from those two
great sources of revenue—distilled spirits and
tobacco—to so small a minimum as the returns
of the present fiscal year have exhibited ; the
estimated receipts from distilled spirits for the
current fiscal year being less by fifty per cent,
than the amount received during the preceding
fiscal year, namely, $29,151,000, in 1867, as
compared with (an estimate of) §13,500,000 in
1808.
With the passage of the amended law, a very
considerable gain in internal revenue from
other sources is also reasonably certain'—espe-
cially from the tax on the sales of manufac-
tures, and the modification of the other "spe-
cial taxes."
The estimates of receipts of internal revenue
from various sources, as predicated on the pas-
sage of the amended law reported by the Com-
mittee of Ways and Means, may be stated as
follows :
Fermented liquors  &5.000.000*
Gas and refined petroleum (reduced)  3.500 Oo0*
Incomes and salaries  36,000.000
Gross receipts 7,500,000*
Stamps  17,000,000*
Legacies and successions  2,000,000*
Bank dividends, circulation, and de-
posits  lO.OOO.OOO5
Fines and penalties  1,460,000*
Miscellaneous, (Schedule A, &c.)  2,100,000*
Spccial taxes (exclusive of the special
taxes on the sales of distillers and rec-
tifiers, and inclusive of taxes oft sales).. 25,000,000
Total #115.560,000*
Tho receipts from distilled spirits during tho
last fiscal year ending June 30, 1867", were
$29,151,340; and from tobacco and cigars,
$19,705,827. With the passage of the amended
law it seems impossible, even with the con-
tinuance of a defective administration, that the
receipts from distilled spirits for the next fiscal
year can fall short of $70,000,000, or from
tobacco of §25,000,000.
Assuming the correctness of these latter
estimates wo have then the gross sum of
$210,560,000 as the receipts from internal
revenue, which may be reasonably anticipated
for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1809.
On the other hand, if we fail to secure any
increase of revenue from distilled spirits and
tobacco beyond what was secured during the
last fiscal year, the receipts of internal revenue
for the next fiscal year cannot well be esti-
mated at less than $161,000,000.
PUBLIC LiXDS.
From the sale of public lands the revenue
of the current year, namely, $1,166,000, will
undoubtedly be continued.
WISCELI.AXEOUS RECEIPTS.
For the revenue receipts from miscellaneous
sources, i. e., premium on gold, sales of prop-
erty, consular fees, &c., 1 adopt the estimate
of the Secretary of the Treasury, in his last
annual report, namely, $30,000,1)00. The
receipts from miscellaneous sources, exclu-
sive of the premium derived from the sales
of gold coin, for the fiscal year ending June
30, 18G7, were $28,070,008 95. For the first
■''Substantially "the same receipts as during tho last
fiscal year.
