Lieutenant Colonel MAX. WOODHULL,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Fifteenth Army Corps:

COLONEL: I have the honor to report that I have this day moved my command from White Chimney to Mill Creek via Reedy Mills and Clifton and Bowling Green, a distance of twenty-two miles, traversing the old stage road and crossing the Mattapony River and Mill Creek en route. The movement was commenced at 5 a. m. sharp, and the command had been placed in bivouac at 5 p. m. My train, having been placed in advance of the troops, moved at 4 a. m. and closed on the Second Division at Clifton Rest before it had broken camp, and in consequence I was compelled to mass my division, making a halt of the hour and a half. If I am not otherwise directed by the major-general commanding I shall continue my march to-morrow, breaking camp at 5 a. m.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOHN M. CORSE,
