COLONEL: I am instructed by the brigadier-general commanding to say that if the enemy do not advance on him and nothing occurs to prevent he will start next Tuesday morning for WEST Tennessee to assist in raising men; he will probably reach Somerville about Wednesday, and he wishes you to keep the country well scouted toward the east, and keep him advised if Hatch returns and if any other enemy appears in that direction. If you can get forage he wishes you to come nearer to him than Jackson, say somewhere about Whiteville.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
