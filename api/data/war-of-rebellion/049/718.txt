Captain D. N. WALKER,

Otey Battery, Wytheville:

I have about 200 home guards here, will have about 250 at New River Bridge this morning, and have telegraphed to Brigadier-General Nicholls, commanding at Lynchburg, to be prepared to assist if needed. Keep me informed of anything you can learn.

Colonel G. C. WHARTON,

Commanding, Glade Spring:

A large force of the enemy reported in Abb's Valley. Seven hundred supposed to be advancing either on Saltville or some point east of that place on the railroad. This is rumored to be an advance guard of a force of from 4,000 to 7,000. Please keep me informed of anything you may learn.

Major General SAMUEL JONES,

Abingdon:

I have telegraphed General Nicholls, at Lynchburg, to keep his command in readiness to start if necessary. About 600 men (home guards) reported to me at New River Bridge. I have 200, with one piece of artillery, stationed at Cloyd's Mountain. The force at Wytheville has not been reported to me. I suppose about 300. Is it worth while to bring the Lynchburg Home Guards to Central Depot, or shall I only keep them on the alert?

WM. B. MYERS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF WESTERN VIRGINIA,Dublin, September 13, 1863.

Colonel G. C. WHARTON,

Commanding, Glade Spring:

The enemy, reported 800 strong, are supposed to be advancing through Tazewell, either on Wytheville or in this direction. The home guards of Pulaski are stationed on Cloyd's Mountain with one piece of artillery. They number 200. I have about 600 more from Roanoke reported at New River Bridge. I do not know the force at Wytheville. If anything occurs in your front please let me know. The raid may be on the salt-works. Some prisoners taken yesterday near Marion reported it as the advance of a large foce. It may be so. The salt-works would in that case probably be their destination.

WM. B. MYERS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
