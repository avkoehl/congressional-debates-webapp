and extravagance m the gross, bul unfortunately,
when brought to the details of appropriation and
expenditure, every item is earnestly and energeti-
call supported
In looking to the expenditures of the Government
for the last few } ears, and the present straitened
condition of the Treasury, gentlemen seemed to
have overlooked some of the earliest and most
efficient causes which have brought us to our
present embarrassments The original fault was
here That fault was the cieation of a redundant
revenue—a redundancy arising from the policy ot
piling one increase of duty upon another bv your
tariff acts from 1816 to 1838 It is thus, sir, that
a redundant revenue had its origin, and the con-
sequence has been a correspondingly increased
expenditure It may be stated as a general prin-
ciple, both in public and private affaits, that re-
venue and expenditure will he proportioned to
each other And although the public revenue
should never be greater than may be sufficient to
meei the necessary expendituies of the Govern-
ment , if, either by foil) or any other means, a
greater revenue should be created, that revenue
ought to be expended, ir proper and legal objects
can be found upon which to make such expendi-
ture This Government has no legitimate power
to raise revenue for the purpose of hoarding it or
wasting it upon any system ot corruption or
favoritism whatever How or wherefore, it is
unnecessary to the present inquiry, we must bor-
row money m some mode or other to meet the
public expenditure What, then, should guide us
in the appropriation's to be made while this condi
tion of things shall continue to exist i The dictate
of a w se and considerate economy would require
that we Gonnne ourselves to such appiopnations as
are indispensable to the public service, and no no
further Surel) the continual on of the Cumber-
land road is not embraced in the class ot objects
to which he hid adverted Eut he should fail in
ihe discharge of his duty to himself and the coun-
try, if he did not reply to the often reiteiated le-
marks heard in this House about the bankrupt
condition ef the Treasury He had alieady spoken
of the unnecessary accumulation of the public
revenue as the leading cau^e which has brought
the Treasury to its present condition But what
has become of this accumulation of revenue?
By the act of June, 1836, there had been depo-
sited with the States about twenty-eight millions ot
dollars of publn money At the cxtia session m
September last, indulgence was given to the depo-
site banks and impoiting merchants for ten or
twelve millions more But this was not all When
the Bank ot the United States, the grot ¡emulator,
cea ed to have a legal existence m 1836, it was
unable to refund the six oi seven millions of stock
owned m it by the Government Thus has an ag-
gregate amount of public money been placed
beyond our rpach but little short ot fifty millions of
dollars, and now, forsooth, because it has become
necessary to borrow mone>, or employ the credit of
the Government by the issue of ten millions of
Treasury notes, we are met with the cty ot ' A
bankrupt Treasury'" But in addition to this ag-
gregate of more than forty millions of dollars depo-
sited with the States, or the payment of which has
been postponed by indulgence to the deposite
banks, the Bank of the United States, and the im-
porters of foreign goods,  t must not forget oui
obligation under an act pass-ed at tha late extra
session of Congress, to deposite nine millions of
dollars, more with the States on the first day of
January next
Sir, the amount still due from the late deposite
banU, and the Bank of the United States, exceeds
the whole amount of Treasury notes, issued by au-
thority of the act of October last In the distribu-
tion of public money by the deposite ?ci of June
1836, about three millions thiee hundred thousand
dollars have been received by ihe States of Ohio,
Indiana, and Illinois, the Stite' interested in the
passage of the bill under consideiation xiai this
]<? not all the public money in possession of ihose
States and the deposite banks situated within them
The deposite banks m Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois,
yet retain, under the act of October last, granting
indulgence to the public depositories, more than
eight hundred thousand dollars of the public mo-
ney, making m all a total of more than four mil-
lions of dollars Under this state of things, bor-
rowing money to defray the necessary expenses of
the Government, more than four millions of the
public money in possession of the States, and de-
posite banks, of Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois, is there
any one who has pledged himself to an economical
expenditure, who can permit himself to vote for
this bill?
The debate was further continued by Messrs
C H WILLIAMS of Tennessee, and GRAVES
of Kentucky, in opposition to the bill, and by Mr
SOUTHGATE in its support.
Mr UNDERWOOD then renewed his motion
to recommit the bill to the Committee of Ways
and Means, with instructions to report a bill sur
rendering the road to the respective S ates through
which it passed, and, having spoke a short time in
suppoil of his motion, and in opposite n to the bill,

there was for the Govr-nment to interfere for their
protection, and the ai ícfioration of their condition.

give them a knowledge of agriculture, to insure all
the best wishes of the Government towards this un-
fortunate lace Mr T concluded by moving to

tucky or any other Senator, justify the reissuing ef
