variety of considerations which it embraces, I
should have contented myself by letting it pass
without doing more than giving a silent vote on
the proposition before the House Sir, I deem
this one of the most important questions that
has for years past occupied the attention of this
House—not from the simple proposition on which
we are called to act; no • but from the magnitude
of the consequences which, if some of the inti-
mations that have fallen in this debate be true,
must ensue, if it is intended to carry on this in-
vestigation in good faith to the country, or if
anything more is intended by it than a political
hoax, which it has now become so customary for
a certain party to practice upon the too confiding
people in almost every nook and corner of this
vast and growing Republic The immense im-
portance of this investigation, and of the manner
in which it should be conducted, arises from two
considerations, entirely independent of the pro-
fessed and ostensible objects of those who have
now taken it into hand The propnety of in-
vestigating the mere defalcations of Swaitwout
and Price involves matteis of common occur-
rence, about which few, I hope, of any party,
will be found, here or elsewhere, to disagree
That investigation should be made, and in good
faith to the public; and if none othei had moved
It, I should have leJt it my duty to have done it
myself Upon that suljecl i have seen little or
no disagreement, heie 01 eisewheie
But he had said that theie appeared now, from
tht1 remaiks of honomble genth men on the othei
Bide, two othei subjects involved, of independent
consideration fiom the one avowid to be the ob-
ject of the inqun y What were they > First,su,
is the contemplation of an impeachment of the
Secretaiy of the Treasury as a paititseps cnnwim
of these defalcations He, sir, has been maiked
in advance, and charged with the commission of
crime that should and must bland him and his
family With infamy with all postonty, if the one
hundredth part of the allegations and bitter de-
nunciations that have been made against him on
this floor, within the tast few weeks, be tiue, and,
en, if they be not true, then 1 will not say here
what execration and public indi<*n ition should
aw'ait the base calummatoi and false accuser I
hope I am the last man on eaith who would step
between the guilty criminal and the impending
penalty of the outraged laws of the land, and
should be amongst the last to attempt to thiow
around an offending guilty officei one panoply
that would shield and piotcet himfiom the odium
of insulted justice, and immediate and desei ved
punishment, howtvei ign imimous If, then,
these seuous consideiations are involved, which
none will deny, what infuu Ued partisan will dare
rise on this flooi and say that this investigation
should not be conducted with the stnctest impai-
tiality, and that the composition of this commit
tee should not be made by men the most uncom-
mitted, dismteiested,and tiee of prejudice a¿amst
the Secretaiy, whose private, as well as public,
character is to be so senously affected by the
result of this investigation '
The importance of these ficts surely cannot fall
to stuke o-ritlemt n whof'd an inteiest in an lin-
pnntal unestigation of this mattei I would say
to them, if they have no íegaid for Levi Wood-
bury's public or pmate chancier, and aie de-
termined to immolate him in their paity rancoi,
let the innocence of an unoffending piivate family
plead for the observance of the common forms of
justice m the prosecution of this trial, and commit
their fortunes and their fame not into the hands
of those who have openly and public!) pioclaimed
him already gailty, in advance, and to establish
which they have staked their interest and their
honor I appeal to gentlemen to pause, if but foi
a moment, in this mad caieer of paity wajfue,
ard leflcot upon the stupendous injustice that
t! ey are about to mlictupon mjuied innocence
iu the blind and maddening pursuit of a victim
f r | arty malice Let them place upon the com
on tee no mm that has prejudged the guilt or ln-
n icd ce of a party to be placed on his trial, or if
the j do, Ihen let him h tve at least one fnend, to

combination, have obtamtd the power of this

House, not to go into this investigation, which is I
to affect so seriously the individual character of
one heretofore uncontammated with reproach,
with unclean hands, or with any predetermined
resolution to convict, whether there is found in-
nocence or guilt. The country demands a fair
and an impartial investigation of this matter, and
not of a partisan nature, not by men whose own
innocence or guilt is to be dependent, in any way,
on the result of this inquiry No gentleman who
has, in any way, imbibed a prejudice or expressed
an unfavorable opinion, should deign to act on
that committee for a moment, nor should any
consideration induce this House, under present
encumstances, to place such a on% on that com-
mittee To do it, sir, would be a mere mockery
of justice, and to bring into scorn the partiality
of the whole investigation The countiy does
not look for such an inquiry, nor can it m the
least be benefited by such a one The people
have alieady been haiassed with repeated inqui-
ries, intended for party purposes merely, with-
out a single practical good resulting to the coun-
try
In the second point of view, the character of
this committee is of the first importance, as the
charactei of this whole Administiation will, in a
measure, be brought before them Ties, sir, an
Administration bioight into power by nearly
two thirds of the fiee voters of the countiy is
now about being committed to the hands of a
majonty of a committee who are deadly hostile
to the feelings anil sentiments of nearly two
thirds of the people of this country—an effect
pioduced by alliances the mostextraoidmary,and
one which the people of this countiy should
never cease to remember The people will learn,
with no little astonishment, that a Congiess, a
majority of which they elected suppoiters of this
Administration, have been convened, by politi-
cal management here, into a dead minouty To
know wheie and by whom this recreancy and
tleacheryto their rights have been committed,
the fieedom of no people can 'ong endure, until
a strict accountability is demanded and had into ¡
the conduct of those who have piesumed to
change their couise without consulting them I
Their conduct should not be foigotten                     j
Ihe people should, and will, I cannot enter  I
tarn a doubt, demand of those Repiesentatives of
easy virtue to know « hj they have joined in v> ith '
the Opposition to thiow the Admiinstiation they
were< lected to support into ammoiiiy     But, su, '
between them ard then constituí nts 1 shall not m- !
terfere   '1 his hsttieachery only affouls additional
evidence of the incontestable tiuth of that evei tobe
remembeied maxim with eveiy fnend of fieedom
throughout the woild   " The pi ice of hbeity is
eternal vigilance "   With it, no man, or set of
men, should te trusted to tampei with impunity,
and those who do it have e\eimoie acted on the
jiresumption that the people, the friends of lib
eity, and to whom its pnee is beyond all value,
are ctedulous, and are easily to  be imposed on
ami duncd by gieat pi ofessions of scorning to be
dictated  to by patty and paity leadeis of hon-
esty, sincerity, and dismteiested jiatnotism   The
woild ovei,and these have been the uniform dec-
laiations and piofessions of those who have be
come recieant to the tiusts confided to them by
a too generous constituency
J he Republican paity, beyond all otheis,have
suffered most 'rom this political malady     It has
been  their curse siace the eailiest foimation of
this Government, and has been progiessive up to
the piesent date, and now even thieatens the sub
version of all freedom in that Government under
which we live and have prospered so long and
soglonously
I     One of the greatest novelties of this investiga-
I Hon, as it is pioposed to be earned on by the
j piesent allied poioeis, is that the majority of this
House, the representatives of the majonty of the
¡ people of this country, the whole of the officers
I of the Government, aie' to be placed into the I
j hands of a committee,  a majority of which—I j
| m gilt bay two thuds of which — remesenta paity |
that are composed of the icpiesentatnes of imost
I mcngci   minouty of the  peop'c of this country
Heie, sir, then, absolutely for the first time in
i the histoiy of th b Government, be it said to its
immoital honoi, has been the majonty of this
I country placed into hands to be tned by a minoi-
Senate.
ity, a thing that should belong recollected as the
first step of a departure fiom that fundamental
rule in all free Republics, that in all cases a ma-
jority shall control—facts, sn, that must stuke,
forcibly, every statesman of the waning and de-
creasing regard for the soveieign contiol of the
great majority of the people, as now entertained
and evinced for the fiist time by a certain party
in this country
Sir, (said Mr B ,) I am glad, truly glad, that
it is so I am rejoiced at this eaily development
of the principles of a party that has just gamed
control in this Government I am glad of the
developments made here of their true chaiacters,
and of the principles upon which they are to act
as a party It is the first earnest given of the
punciples upon which they are to act, and on
which they are to cany out the tiue doctunes of
what is now called the modem Whig party and
their appendages in holy alliance
It will now be seen, most astounding as it is,
that the character of this Administration, brought
into power by a majonty of the suffiages of the
fieemen of this country, backed by the election
of a majority of Representatives to this Congiess,
have, by an art not unfrequeniy used here, by
an alliance to which the people have in no way
been a party nor instiumental, now been placed
into the hands of a minority Opposition, the pecu-
hiii repiesentatives of all the idle, unpioductive
inteiests of the entire nation, an auguiy than
which nothing could be moie poitentous and
alarming to the advocates of pioductive industry
and of freedom throughout the civilized world;
evincing, most clearly, a regularly concocted
plan, to my mind, of a settled, fixed system,
which, in connection with what has taken place
elsewhere* by this new party to usurp by fraud,
deception, intrigue, and stratagem, the lights of
the majority of the freemen of this country, and
to oveithrow that great fundamental pnnciple m
all free governments of the undisputed right of
the majonty to contiol Is not, then, thecouiss
about being puisued here, and on this occasion,
peifectly in character with, and a piece of, that
well-di°ested plan of operations which has been
lccently earned on elsewhere by the same party
to thwait the will of the majonty of the gieat
body of the people of this countiy? Does no
man see the kmdied relationship ot this step to
otheis of íecent date' Sir, in my judgment it
wems the paity hi and—lesistance to, and usuipa-
tion of, the rights of the majonty of the fiee peo-
ple of this country Hence the stupendous mag.
mtude and impoitance of the appointment of a
fair, impartial, and unprejudiced committee, with
a due respect to the feelings of a majonty of this
House and the country, and with hands un-
stained with any preconceived opinions of the
guilt or innocence of any man oi set of men
Upon this subject this House has a lesson. Will
it heed it?
In the next place, will it be foigotten that the
people of this nation have but just letumed to
this Congress a majonty of Representatives—
from fifteen to twenty five—in favor of the pies-
ent Administration, who piofessed to be Demo-
crats and Republicans when elected, and pledged
themselves to the suppoit of the piesent Repub-
lican Administration' Can the opinions of the
majonty of the people's Representatives, oi the
opinions of a majonty of the people themselves,
be fanly lepiesented on that committee when it
is known that a majority already elected on it
belong to the minority of the House, and who
represent a most meager minority out of it? Do
gentlemen not see the extraoidmary composition
and character that they aie about to give to that
committee—about, did I say?—which they have
already given to it, and which must mark with
suspicion their whole proceedings with eveiy
friend of popular rights?
Sir, the committee themselves should pause
befoie they take it upon themselves to act eindei
such circumstances For thisieason, then, I have
said if you would have the íeport of this com-
mittee to produce a salutary effect, give us a fan
committee, composed of unbiased, ui committed
members in favor of the guilt or innocence of any
individuals, and whose inteiest nor honor is at
