Lieutenant Colonel J. B. McLIN,

Lloyd's Cross-Roads, Tenn.:

COLONEL: The major-general commanding has received no report from you. He directs that you will inform him immediately how your command is employed, and communicate to department headquarters all important intelligence you may gain respecting the movements of the enemy. You will be active and vigilant,and keep your scouts well out in the direction of the enemy. Major Harper who is at or near Maynardville with his command, reports that one of his scouting parties was fired into about 300 yards this side of Powell's River, on the Hurst Ford (Clinch River) road, by a party of about 80 infantry posted on an eminence. They succeeded in cutting of his lieutenants and 4 men, but who may not have been capture. This occurred yesterday. A large body of Federal troops are reported to have crossed at Rogers' Gap. You must watch all their movements closely.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. F. BELTON,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
