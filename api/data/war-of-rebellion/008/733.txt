GENERAL ORDERS,

Numbers 7.HEADQUARTERS MO. S. G.,Camp, Springfield, Mo., January 5, 1862.

The major-general commanding earnestly hopes that no depredations upon property by officers and soldiers of the army occupying houses in and around the city be committed by them or allowed to be committed by others.

The fencing around buildings and yards, timber, &amp;c., are liable to be injured or destroyed by such an army as his. Men frequently pay but little attention to fruit and ornamental trees or shrubbery or to the value and safety of yards and gardens. These are all prized by the owners of the property, and the major-general intends to have such rights respected and protected. He calls the special attention of all officers and soldiers to the above, and hopes that no such abuses as those enumerated will occur while his army remains in Springfield.

The attention of commanders of divisions and brigades, regiments and battalions and companies, is particularly directed to this order and they will see that it is not violated. This order will be read daily to the men when in regimental, battalion, and company drill, or at roll call, for one week. For any infraction of it by the occupants of the buildings or property the company commander will be held responsible.

By order of Major General S. Price:

WM. H. BRAND,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

The major-general commanding, desiring that none but those belonging to the army shall forage (in any sense of the word) upon the community at large, as deceptions of that kind have been practiced, now orders that all who are not citizens of the county or members of the army, or who have not permission to remain either in the county or in the army, do leave.

III. Officers of the army, especially the commanders of divisions, are ordered to give notice of any infraction of this order, and unless satisfactorily explained they will in every case be held responsible therefor. Independent of the officers of the army and the commanders of the respective divisions, citizens of the city of Springfield and county of Green are earnestly requested to report any and all violations of this published order.
