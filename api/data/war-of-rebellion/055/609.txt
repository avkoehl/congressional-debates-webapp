following as conspicuous in bravery, viz: Colonel Hugo Wangelin, wounded in arm at Ringgold (since amputated); Lieutenant Colonel J. Kaercher, Major Frederick T. Ledergerber, wounded at Ringgold-all of the Twelfth Missouri; Lieutenant Colonel F. W. Partridge, commanding Thirteenth Illinois Volunteers, wounded at Ringgold; Major Willard Warner, commanding Seventy-sixth Ohio Volunteers; Lieutenant Colonel Theodore Meumann, Third Missouri Volunteers. Major James F. How, Twenty-seventh Missouri Volunteers, with 10 men, attacked and took prisoners 65 armed rebels.

I have to regret the loss of Major D. R. Bushnell, Thirteenth Illinois Volunteers; Captain J. A. Ledergerber and Actg. Adjt. F. Kessler, both of Twelfth Missouri Volunteers; Captain Ira P. French and First Lieutenant John R. Miller, Seventy-sixth Ohio, who fell gallantly fighting at Ringgold for the country to which they gave their services and their lives; also First Lieutenant S. B. Wall and Second Lieutenant John A. Lemert, Seventy-sixth Ohio Volunteers, who were mortally wounded at Ringgold, and are since dead. Captain H. A. Kircher, Twelfth Missouri, wounded at Ringgold, and Actg. Adjt. John Wellmeyer, Twenty-seventh Missouri, wounded at Lookout Mountain, received their wounds while gallantly doing their duty.

To the members of my staff-Captain C. H. Kibler, assistant adjutant-general; Lieutenant Fred. H. Wilson, aide-de-camp, and Lieutenant W. E. Ware, acting assistant inspector-general-my warmest thanks are due for the gallant and fearless manner in which all orders were executed.

The number of prisoners reported captured by the different regiments of this brigade is 57 officers and 1,942 men, as appears by the inclosed list.

I have the honor, captain, to be your obedient servant,

CHAS. R. WOODS,
