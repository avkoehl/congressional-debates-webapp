CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
Sury from Executive control, we should watch with
even more vigilance and apprehension the growth
and movements of a power which, when combined
with the organization of party, and ptsiraanently
successful, must inevitably, not onlv control our
finances, but govern the couniry Without refer
ring to earlier contests, the struggle of the last six
years affords at least some evidence of an ambi-
tious desire amorg those institutions which are
contending lor tne us-eot die public money and pub-
lic credit to shaie xn the administration of our ra-
tionil affairs In th s great stiupgle the inte-
rests of trade, and the welfaie ot the coun-
try, have been sacrificed by the too ¿lileus elicits
oí the political portion of our ban^eis to perpetuate
their control ovei the National Treasury, ,.nd to
secure foi evei to themselv s , nd then successors
the profits on the ux of the public money and pub-
lic credit Such efforts, when combined null poli-
tical view-., might elevate to the Presidency a Chief
Magistrate «ho would effect a foim dable union
between fne Executive and the immense banking
capital of the country altea ly amounting 11 m ire
than thieehundied millions of dollars Ifn ,        w
so much alarmed at the influence oí the E\ec i i>e
with our limited revenue, unit mav ue n t lear
when tnat powerful branch of <>m Governm n i
sustained, not only b> the pinhe Treasui}, bin oy
a thousand bai ks and tnousands of oil er co> posi-
tions, comrolltd "nd directed by a league oí Stilt
institutions with large capitals, or by a nat oinl
bank wiih a capital of fitty 01 one bundled mil-
lions of dollars
Such are ihe consequences involved in fie issue
which is now dividing the nati n, and agitaimg its
trade and industry It would almost seem thit
the honest efforts of some of our banks to pioduce
harmony oí action, and to resume s jecie payments,
are defeated to prolong our cmb rrassm nts, and
to co lv nice the nation of the necess tv oí assigning
the most important powers of Government to the
stopkhol lersoi aNatioualBmk This contest should
be endedb} the prompt adoption of the measure pro-
posed, for trade can never enjoy a stead) prospe-
rity till Government and banks are independent of
each other The public moi ej should be applied
to public purposes alone, and the bank* should be
free to pmsae then own profitable course, \ ithout
being embarrassed by 'he efforts of a small poitten
of their number employed as I'reasmy agents, or
by p"rpetn'>! struggles with the Fxecutive o C u
gress Shomd this conk st ever result in the triumph
of an all anee of the Executive  nd moneyed pow-
ers of the country, it cannot be expected that a
union so fearful in its consequences, could be per-
manently successful Patriotism would be justly
alarmed for the fate of out political institutions,
and for the existence of popular rights Another
and a more powenul struggle would commence,
which would prove ruinous to trade, and might
involve the legislative privileges of every bank
and everj corporation in the Union By continu-
ing this as an unsettled quesaon, the trading and
banking interest will be<\pospil> all the vicis-
situdes of party, and engaged in a perpetnn war,
unprofitable to themselves, ar-d ruinous to the
country By adopting the mei ure pionosed, and
making it our permanent policy, every bianeh of
trade will be left to move on undisturbed bj our
national poliucil contests, and the Executive
branch of oui Government would be separated
from a powei which, v, ien united with it, is the
most dangerous toouriiee inst tutions and to our
Confederacy
The committee, theiefore, respectfully submit
the measure to the consideration ot the Hous , sin-
cerely hoping that, whatever difiere ice of opinion
may exist "s to the details of the b II, its essPntu 1
principles may be adopted in some form, that tin
at least, among the many agitating quesiior s, mi)
be put to lest, that regulations so necessary to the
safety of the public money may no lorgei be post-
poned, and that we mav, b) a 'horough separation
from banks, secure, at ail times and under all cir-
cumstances, an Independent Treasury
