MODIFICATION OF TIIE TARIFF.
Mr. LATHAM. I move that the Senate pro-
ceed to the consideration of House joint resolu-
tion No. 145.
Mr. FESSENDEN. I wish the Senator would
defer that, as I am anxious to pass a little tariff
bill that has come from the House of Representa-
tives. i think it will only take the time occupied
in reading it.
Mr. LATHAM. Very well.
Mr. FESSENDEN. I report the bill back from
the Committee on Finance with a recommenda-
tion that it pass,.and I ask that it may be consid-
ered now. It makes some necessary alterations
in the tariff bill. The committee report the bill
without amendment.
There being no objection, the bill (H. R. No.
779) to modify existing laws imposing duties on
imports, and for other purposes, was considered
as in Committee of the Whole.
โข The bill provides that all goods, wares, and
merchandise now in the public stores ot bonded
warehouses, on which duties are unpaid, having
been in bond more than one your, and less than
three years when the act of July 14, 1862, " in-
creasing temporarily the duties on imports, and
for other purposes," went into effect, may be en-
tered for consumption, and the bonds canceled
at any time before the 1st day of June next, on
payment of tho duties at the tales prescribed by
that act. Section fourteen of the act of July 14,
1862, is to be so modified as to allow cotton and
raw silk as reeled from the cocoon of the growth
or produce of countries beyond the Cape of Good
Hope, to be exempt from any additional duty,
when imported ftom places this side of the Cape
of Good Hnpt>, for two years. So much of the
act of August IB, 1856, "to authorize protection
to be given to citizens of the United States, who
may discover deposits of guano,"as prohibits us
exportation, is to be suspended for two years from
July 14, 1863, in relation to all persons who have
complied with the provisions of section two of the
act of August 18, 1856. The proviso in section
fifteen of the act of July 14, 1862, is to include
any ship, vessel, or steamer to or trom any poit
or place south of Mexico down to and including
Aspinwalland Panama.
In lieu of the duties now imposed, printing pa-
per unsized, used for books and newspapeis ex-
clusively, is to pay twenty per cent, ad valorem;
sublac and sticklac the same as gum shellac;
polishing powders of all descriptions, Frankfort
black, and wash-blue twenty-five per cent, ad va-
lorem; petroleum and coal illuminating oil, ciude
and not lefined, twenty per cent, ad valorem.
Hereafter a drawback is to be allowed on foreign
saltpeter manufactured into gunpowder in the
United States and exported therefrom, equal in
amount to the duty on the foreign saltpeter ftom
which it shall be manufactured.
Mr. LATHAM. There is one section I should
like to have the Secretary read again, in relation
to Aspinwall and Panama.
The Secretary read the fourth section of the
bill.
Mr. SUMNER. There is a clause I should
like to have read again; that relating to the paper
duty.
The Secretary read section five.
Mr. FESSENDEN. A Senator asks me what
effect the provision will have that was read by the
suggestion of the Senator from California. The
act'To which that section refers provides that ton-
nage duties shall only be levied once a year from
vessels coming from Mexico. This extends it to
Central America in order to take in the steamers
that ply regularly to and from the Isthmus, and I
not impose upon thorn the burden of paying ton- i
nage duty every trip. j
The bill was reported to the Senate without j
amendment, ordered to a third reading, read the |
third time, and passed.
PROPERTY DEVISED BY CAPTAIN LEVY.
Mr. FESSENDEN". I wish to introduce a joint
resolution to which nobody will object;, it will ex-
plain itself on being read. It is very necessary to
pass it immediately.
By unanimous consent, leave was given to in-
troduce the jointresolution (S. No.137) in relation
to propel ty devised to the people of the United
States by Captain Uriah P. Levy, deceased; and
it was read the first time. It proposes to accept
the devise and bequest of Captain Levy of his
Monticello farm in Virginia, and his real estate in
New York city, in trust, to establish and maintain
at Monticello an agricultural school for the educa-
tion of the children of wan ant officers of the Navy,
and to appoint William M. Evarts, Erastus Corn-
ing, and Lewis B. Woodruff of New York, to-
receive the property and report their proceedings
to the next Congiess.
Mr. FESSENDEN. It will be observed that
this will bequeathes a considerable amount of
property; it is said to amount to about $300,000,
including an estate at Monticello, and a consider-
able estate in the city of New Yoik, to the Gov-
ernment of the United States. The whole amount
bequeathed 1 am told will reach that sum. The
only question is whether Congress will accept it
for the purposes theiein named. It is for the con-
sideration of Congress, i understand that if the
United States refuse to accept it, then it is devised
to the State ofVirginin, and if they refuse to accept
it, then to somebody else.
Mi HARRIS. We must accept a law suit with
it. I understand the heirs are contesting the va-
lidity of the will.
Mr. FESSENDEN. I submit it to the consid-
eration of the Senate.
The resolution was read a second time by its
title, and considered as in Committee of the
Whole.
Mr. GRIMES. It seems to me that we are
hardly possessed of sufficient knowledge on this
subject to justify us in assuming this trust. It is
an agreement on our part, if we appoint these
trustees and direct them to take possession of the
estate in New York, that we will at some time
establish some sort of a school for the benefit of
ceitam beneficiaries on the Monticello estate in
Virginia. Jt occurs to me that it ought to be con-
sidered by some committee of this body. We
ought to know something about it, and I move
thatube referred to the committee on the Library.
That is an excellent committee, composed of our
oldest and best memheis.
Mr. FESSENDEN. I will simply say that the
resolution was considered in the room of the Com-
mittee on Finance, being broughtin there by a sub-
committee who were examining matters, and that
sub-committee consisted of the only members of
the Committee on the Library, namely, the Sen-
atorfrom Vermont, [Mr. Collamer,] and myself,
so that it hasaheady been considered by the Com-
mittee on the Library. Ifitbe now referred back,
it is very manifest that we can acquire, no inform-
ation in regard to it at this session of Congress,
and Senators, therefore, must consider whether
it is advisable to act now and accept the devise or
not. Of course it ought to be done in a reasonable
time if it is to be done at all.
Mr. LATHAM. I should like to inquire of
the Senator from Maine whether there is any lim-
itation as to the time within which the bequest
must be accepted ?
Mr. FESSENDEN. All I know about it is
precisely what appears in the resolution itself, it
was brought in to the committee by the district
attorney of New Yoik. We had no time to ex-
amine it. He said to me that it was believed the
estate devised would amount to about ยง300,000.
I was not aware that there was any litigation
about it.
Mr. COLLAMER. I understand that the form
of the devise is this: the property is given first to
the United States: if not accepted by them, then
to the State of Virginia; and so on. I suppose
that under such a devise, the United States ought
to manifest their intention to receive it in some
reasonable time. I will ask how long it is since,
the man died ? I do not know, but'i think it is-,
withm a short,time.
Mr. GRIMES. About a year, i think.'
Mr. COLLAMER. ft seems to mc that Gcin*
gross should, at the earliest session after being?
informed of the fact, manifest its willingness-ta
receive the devise or not. Perhaps it might be
construed by the courts as rejecting it, if they did
not accept it at the first session after they were
informed of the fact. Perhaps not, however. 1
give no opinion on that point. My idea would
be that we had better accept it, at any rate.
Mr. HARRIS. The Senate, in acting upon
this resolution, ought to, understand the precise
position of the property in question. The heirs
of Captain Levy have already commenced a suit
in equity for the purpose of having this will de-
clared void. Thatsuit isnow pendingin the courts
of New York, and if the Government accept this
donation, undoubtedly we shall have to take with
it a severe litigation in the courts of New York
in reference to it. I have no objection at all to
accepting it, but it should be understood that the
matter is to be litigated, and will be litigated with
great severity by the heirs of Captain Levy.
Mr. DOOL1TTLE. I suppose this would be
the rule. It is for us to determine whether we ac-
cept it, and we ought to have a reasonable time
for that purpose. For the first time, this morning,
as I understand, it is brought to the attention of
the Committee on Finance and presented to the
Senate. Now if we should, under these circum-
stances,. lay it over until the next session of Con-
gress, it could not be said that we were asking any
unreasonable time. It seems to me, therefore, it
would be better that this matter should go over
and be investigated; for we, by accepting the de-.
vise, especially if the whole property is m litiga-
tion, may be worse off than the person who bought
the elephant. We may be as bad off as the man
who supposed his father-in-law gave him a lar^e
donation on his wedding day of certain stocks in
a railroad corporation.^ He felt himself rich, but
when he began to inquire into the value of the
stocks, he found that they were perfectly good for
nothing, and more than all, that the stockholders
were liable to assessments. It may be justabout
as valuable as having a pew in a church that you
have to pay a tax upon to the minister.
Mr. President, I think it would be wise'for us
before we agree to accept this devise and take upon
ourselves the responsibility of establishing this
school, to let the matter go over until the Com-
mittee on Finance can examine it, or the Com-
mittee on the Library, which ! think is the more
appropriate committee to refer it to. #
Mr. HARRIS. I do not propose to offer an
amendment to this resolution, but 1 will take the
liberty of suggesting to thechaiiman of the com-
mittee who has reported it, whether it might not
be wise to modify the resolution so as to author-
ize some officer of the Government, the Secretary
of the Treasury, or the Attorney General, to ac-
cept this devise or not, as upon investigation he
should find to be proper.
Mr. FESSENDEN. I think it would.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question
now is on the reference of the resolution to the
Committee on the Library.
Mr. FESSENDEN. I move that it lie on the
table for the present, in order that the Senator from
New York may prepare an amendment.
Mr. GRIMES. Before that is done, ] beg to
express the opinion that no action will be taken
upon this subject when there is not a full Senate.
I am utterly opposed to vesting the power in any
man to determine for us whether we will under-
take to establish such a school as is proposed
here.
The resolution was ordered to lie on the table.
ISSUING OF AMERICAN REGISTERS.
Mr. CHANDLER. I move to take up the joint
resolution which I reported from the Committee
on Commerce last evening.
The motion was agreed to; fud the joint reso-
lut on (H. R. No. 154) authorizing the Secretary
of the Treasury to issue American registers to
certain vessels named therein, was considered as
; in Committee of tiie Whole. It provides for the
issuing of American registers to the Marion; the
Selkirk, of Windsor; the Hastings, of Ottawa;
and the California, of the Oswego district, in New
