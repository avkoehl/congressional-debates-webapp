S. NICKERSON,

Acting Volunteer Lieutenant, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS MIDDLE MILITARY DIVISION,April 22, 1865.

Brevet Major-General EMORY, Cumberland:

General Hancock directs me to inform you that about 380 of Mosby's men have surrendered, under Lieutenant-Colonel Chapman. Mosby himself did not surrender.

C. H. MORGAN,

Brevet Brigadier-General, &amp;c.
HEADQUARTERS MIDDLE MILITARY DIVISION,April 22, 1865.

Brevet Major-General EMORY, Commanding, Cumberland:

GENERAL: The major-general commanding directs me to say to you in reply to your dispatch of yesterday, that General Grant's order some time since permitted all deserters to go to their homes. General Stevenson afterward, when he was temporarily in command of the Department of West Virginia, at the solicitation of the governor, issued an order, which you have on file, referring to this matter. That order in certain respect was contrary to General Grant's. General Stevenson's order afterward modified, as you will see by the copy of the following dispatch to General Carroll when he was in command of the Department of West Virginia.*

The modification referred to you will no doubt find among the official papers in your office at Cumberland. Paroled prisoners under the late agreement between Generals Grant and Lee have an absolute right to go to their homes in West Virginia, under their paroles, and to remain there, subject to the conditions of their paroles. As to refugees, the general knows of no rule to act upon at this juncture,m save that applied to deserters, who may or may not be dangerous to their neighbors, &c.

Respectfully,

W. G. MITCHELL,

Brevet Colonel and Aide-de-Camp.
HEADQUARTERS MIDDLE MILITARY DIVISION,April 22, 1865.

Brevet Major-General EGAN,

Commanding Third Division, Army of the Shenandoah, Charlestown, Va.:

GENERAL: Major-General Hancock directs me to say that leave of absence is granted to you for ten days. You will please leave General Raum in command of your division.

I am, general, very respectfully,

W. G. MITCHELL,

Brevet Colonel and Aide-de-Camp.
