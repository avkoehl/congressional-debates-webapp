BALLOON CAMP, June 14, 1862.

Brigadier-General MARCY,

Chief of Staff, Army of the Potomac:

GENERAL: Accompanying this note is a map with some of the most important earth-works represented, and in the right place, as near as I can get them according to the map. There are other places where earth has been thrown up, but I shall have to ascend again to a high altitude in order to locate them. The work that commence at Widow Price's house runs to the woods a little to the right of Old Tavern, and on the farther end I should judge that 500 or more persons were at work this morning. There is also a small work to the right of the house, running into the woods.

The numbers upon the map are for the purpose of explaining the various points better when telegraphic from the balloon. Please preserve it for that purpose.

I am greatly in need of a good field glass for the Mechanicsville balloon. If one can be obtained will you please send it by the orderly, and greatly oblige,

Your very obedient servant,

T. S. C. LOWE,

Chief Aeronaut, Army of the Potomac.

BALLOON CAMP,

Near Doctor Gaines" House, June 14, 1862-6.15 a.m.

Brigadier-General MARCY,

Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: I remained in the air from 5 to 6 o"clock this morning. There appears to be no movements of the enemy upon any of the roads at this time. Many camp-fires were built during the time I was up, showing the enemy in the same position as yesterday. The artillery that was at James Garnett's house yesterday is not in sight this morning.

Your obedient servant,

T. S. C. LOWE.

BALLOON CAMP,

Near Doctor Gaines" House, June 16, 1862.

Brigadier General R. B. MARCY,

Chief of Staff, Army of the Potomac:

GENERAL: The first ascension that I was able to make to-day was at 3.30 p.m. The enemy are still hard at work on their entrenchments all along their line.

The work in front of Widow Price's extends farther along to the right than I at first supposed, as I can see by breaks in the woods when at a high altitude. It also runs some distance to the left and masked by bushes.

After remaining up nearly one hour Colonel Alexander ascended. I then went to Mechanicsville and had a fine view from that point. The enemy there appeared to be more in force immediately opposite Meadow Bridge than between Mechanicsville and Richmond.

There are two works in sight from the upper balloon-one near Caxton's, or No. 16 and another at 21, as marked on the map that I sent you. Much the largest force, however, and the most work going on, is in front of our left.

While up at Mechanicsville I saw what appeared to be two regiments moving on the New Bridge road-from figure 7 toward Thorn's, with thirteen covered wagons in the rear. I then came to this point and saw them come in near Old Tavern. There are several pieces of artillery visible near James Garnett's house. I will have a balloon in operation as soon as possible near headquarters.

Your very obedient servant,

T. S. C. LOWE,

Chief Aeronaut, Army of the Potomac.

BALLOON CAMP,

Near Doctor Gaines" House, June 17, 1862.

Brigadier General R. B. MARCY:

GENERAL: I took an observation this morning at 7 o"clock. Found the enemy still busy at work on their trenches. The work in front of Mrs. Price's seems to have been enlarged during the night. No other movements of the enemy are visible at this time.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

T. S. C. LOWE,

Chief Aeronaut, Army of the Potomac.
