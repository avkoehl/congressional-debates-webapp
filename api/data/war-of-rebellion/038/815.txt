Telegraphic communications ceased, and have not heard from him since. About 3,500 re-enforcements are en route to him; General Loring goes with them. Enemy is also evidently re-enforcing heavily. I shall concentrate all the troops I can, but distances are great. Unless very large re-enforcements are sent here, I think Port Hudson and Grand Gulf should be evacuated, and the whole force concentrated for defense of Vicksburg and Jackson. It will require at least 6,000 cavalry to prevent heavy raids and to keep railroad communications, on which our supplies depend. Vicksburg and Port Hudson have each about thirty days' subsistence at present. I am holding the country from Snyder's Mill to Bayou Pierre. A large force, which I have no means of meeting, is reported advancing from LA Grange and Corinth.

J. C. PEMBERTON.

RICHMOND, May 2, 1863.

Lieutenant-General PEMBERTON:

Your dispatch received by the President. Heavy re-enforcements will be sent from General Beauregard's command. Will telegraph further intelligence in the next twenty-four hours.

J. A. SEDDON.

[MAY 2, 1863. -For Seddon to Beauregard, ordering re-enforcements to Pemberton, and resulting correspondence, see Series I, VOL. XIV, pp. 923-926.]

TULLAHOMA, May 2, 1863.

Lieutenant-General PEMBERTON:

Enemy reported falling back. Forrest moving west. Cavalry instructed to operate in Mississippi. Let General Ruggles communicate with him. If Grant crosses, unite all your troops to beat him. Success will give back what was abandoned to win it.

J. E. Johnston.

Vicksburg, May 2, 1863.

Brigadier-General ADAMS, Jackson:

Arm the 600 exchanged prisoners. Withdraw the guards from Big Black Bridge and other points on Mississippi Central Railroad between Jackson and Grenada, and send them all at once to Vicksburg.

J. C. PEMBERTON.

GRAND GULF, May 2, 1863.

Lieutenant-General PEMBERTON:

Generals Grant, McClernand, Stevenson, McPherson, Smith, and Osterhaus are in Port Gibson. They know of our forces and prospects; they know we expect Loring and ammunition.

JNO. S. BOWEN.

Vicksburg, May 2, 1863.

Commanding Officer or Quartermaster, Edwards Depot:

Send this dispatch immediately to General Loring or Tilghman; show it to commander of troops on way if he overtakes them:

General Bowen is represented as having fallen back to Grand Gulf, and road is open to enemy. Generals Loring and Tilghman must be on the lookout for him, and, if necessary, fall back across Big Black.

J. C. PEMBERTON.
