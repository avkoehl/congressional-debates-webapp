ordei     There was so much confusion and disorder that gentle
men could not be heard
Mr W then pi oceeded to say that the principle of the home
squadron had already been recognised bv an act wh ch was
passed in the year 1837 It was a remarkable fact that that
law originated from a cause which most clearly illustrated the
necessity of a home squadron In that year it was suddenly
telegraphed to the whole na on that a pira e was off the Oap 3
of Delaware, and that the Philadelphia packet ship "^usque
hanna" had been taken and bcuttled And, stiange to say, this
nation, with a commerce of two hundtedand sixtysx mil
lions—with more than ten millions afloat on the Pacifie
ocean, round Cape Horn—the nation had not even a vessel of
the size of a schooner to protect trade in ports upon its own
waters It was true that, withm a week or ten days after the
aiiegul disaster to the Susquehanna was reported to have ec
cuued, íevenue cutter weie mannedand armed, and sent m
search of the pinte that did not in fa *t, but might have taken
the ship probably with hundreds of thousands of specie on
board, on that pait of the coasf, scuttled her, or scatteied her
to die four winds of heaven, whilst we might never have ¡nown
who did it, what had become ol the vessel and crew, or aay
thing about them— and that, too, immediately undei the gurib
almost of our own homes
Thisaffiir, humbug aait turned out to be, caused a bill to be
passed foi a home squadron and it was the object of the
bill now before the com "mt'e to carry out the object of that
bill The sjra appiopruied hy the pnsent bill was

conflict with a standing standing rule adopted by the House fa

scribed that no appropriation should be introduced into a gene-
ral appropriation bill foi any other than work* already autho-
nzed by law A fort on the Delaware, at a point to be selected
by the Secretaiy, would be a new work The rule was a good

TheCHAJR decided the amendment not tobe in order
Afier some discussion on the question of order-
Mr TOLA.NI> molmed his amendment so as to strike out the
following; provi« > 'Piovulel the title to the Pea Patch island
shall be decided to be m the United states "
He ur^ed the importance and necessity of having some ade-
quate defence piovided for interests of sogreat magnitude, and
evpre^ed his hope that mere considerations of dollars and
cents would not be sufieied to prtvuit it
Mr FIILM jRF, opposed the imminent He apprehended
theie was little danger ihatanenen y would venture to advance
so far up the mer as to s nke at Philadelphia and there were
othei point"- beside this which migh be availed ol as po.nt** of
defence loappmpriaie unconditionally $al)000 toward the
works on the Pea Patch Island would only augment tht difficul-
ty of settling the title the demands of the claimant would grow
with eveiy such addition to the \alue of the property He
thought it best to leave the appropriation as it stood in the bill.
Mi &CRC-EANT stated it as hisunpiession that there was
nov no "tut pending in relation to the titleof the Pea Patch Isl-
and, but that the title had been decided but that there wag now
a negotiation going on between the New Jersey claimant and
