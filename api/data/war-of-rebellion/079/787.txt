CARLEY'S HOUSE, October 4, 1864.

Lieutenant-General LEE:

General Hood directs that you will inform your officers and men that General Stewart took possession of the railroad at Big Shanty yesterday at 3. 30 p. m., killing a few Yankees and taking a few prisoners, and that he is now occupied in destroying the road from Big Shanty to Allatoona. He desires that you will commence at once to strengthen your present position, and would like to see you after breakfast this morning.

A. P. MASON,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

(Same to Major-General Cheatham.)

[OCTOBER 4, 1864. -For Mason to Stewart (two communications), relating to operations against Allatoona and the Etowah bridge, &amp;c., see Part I, p. 814.]

CARLEY'S HOUSE, October 4, 1864 -7. 15 p. m.

Lieutenant-General STEWART:

Commanding Corps:

General Hood directs me to say that you should inform General Armstrong of the movement of that portion of your troops who have gone to Allatoona and to the Etowah (should the latter be deemed practicable), so that Armstrong may keep the commanding officer of those troops advised of any movement of the enemy that might endanger their safety. General Hood thinks they will have to leave the railroad by to-morrow evening, but as regards this it must depend much upon the movements of the enemy. To-morrow as soon as you have arranged your troops General Hood would be glad to see you at his headquarters.

A. P. MASON,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

CARLEY'S HOUSE, October 4, 1864.

Brigadier-General IVERSON,

Commanding Cavalry:

General Hood has received your letter in relation to destroying mills. He directs that should the enemy advance anywhere in your front that you must destroy all things that woild be useful to them and to drive out of the country into which they may advance al the live stock you can.

A. P. MASON,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

CARLEY'S HOUSE, October 4, 1864.

Brigadier-General Jackson,

Commanding Cavalry:

General Hood directs me to say, that since he has read the last report from General Ross, he thinks it more than ever important that he should be in communication with General Armstrong, and be ready to assist him and keep him from being driven in on General Stewart.

A. P. MASON,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
