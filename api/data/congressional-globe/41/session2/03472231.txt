The Secretary read the joint resolution, as
follows:
Joint resolution of the General Assembly of tho
State of Iowa, relating to tho civil contest m tlie
island of Cuba. r
Be it resolved by the General Assembly of theState of
Iowa, That the people of this State regard with deep
interest and profound sympathy the struggles of tho
people of Cuba to realize their independence irorn
European domination; and they regard with abhor-
rence the cruelties inflicted by tho Spaniards upon
their patriot prisoners, treatment which is unchris-
tian and unworthy of the civilization professed alike
in Jiavope and America. , , , . . , .
Be it further resolved, That it has become historic-
ally a part of the law of nations, applicable to the
relations of tho American continent to the older
world, that whenever a State of this continent,
founded by colonization, has a population fitted lor
seif-goYornment, with its chief interests antagonistic
to a longer condition of dependence on European
rule, and its people with reasonable unanimity desire
and insist on the adoption of independent American
civil institutions, such a State has a right to assert
its independence, and to establish agovercmentwith
American principles, founded on the voluntary action
of its own people. _ â€ž ,
Be it further resolved, That after the lapse of a
reasonable time, showing the persistent determina-
tion of such people for independence of Luropean
control, and their .ability to maintain their civil
organization against the effort to resubjugato them
during such period of trial.it is the right and the
duty of tho United States Government to recognizo
them as belligerents within the pale of international
law, and to maintain perfect neutrality between the
contending parties; and this without offense to the
foreign (Government, which can find in such action
only a recognition of Ihc right on which our own
and all other independent American Governments
aro founded.
lie it finally resolved, That in applying these prin-
ciples to Cubas the time has fully come for a cessa-
tion of that policy which allows the European Power
to build and fit out vessels of war at will in our pons,
and nv>vc them thence t'ov the resubjugation of the
Cuban people, white this Government at tho same
Mine sei7.es and confiscates patriot Cuban vessels
driven into our ports by stress of weather, or for
relief; and it is theduty of our Government to adopt
a rule that shall equally admit both contestants to
tho privileges of our ports, or equally exclude both
therefrom; and no further delay can be made in
recognizing tho belligerent rights of tho revolution-
ary government of Cuba without impugning a right
isaciwd. to Ameiicans, and historically established by
nearly all tho original European colonies ot thi*
continont.
liesolved, That our Sonators in Congress br in-
structed, and our Representatives requested i o ni at-
tain theso principles in Congress, and to use tbrir
influence to sccuro their adoption by the ^xeoiUu â– Â«
government; aÂ«d to present thc&e resolution,^ w
their respectivo branches of the Government.
