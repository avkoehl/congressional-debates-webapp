GENERAL: I have the honor, by direction of the major-general commanding, to acknowledge your communication of this day relative to the return to General Newton's division, and in reply to state that orders were given for General Newton's return as soon as relieved by General Dodge, and the major-general commanding thinks he should join you to-day.

Major-General SHERMAN:

General Howard will, to-morrow morning, move a brigade down the south bank of the river from Phillips' to Powers' Ferry, and move one of the pontoon bridges from the former point to the latter. The road at Phillips' is so narrow on each side that but one wagon can pass at a time, consequently there is use for but one bridge. The trestle bridge will not be completed for several days.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General.

GENERAL: The major-general commanding directs that when you get the bridge complete you move your whole corps to the south bank of the river.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
