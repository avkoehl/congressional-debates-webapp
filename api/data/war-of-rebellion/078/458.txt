PULASKI, September 24, 1864.

Major B. H. POLK:

Colonel Spalding, of Tennessee brigade, has arrived. He thinks Forrest, Wheeler, Roddey, and Biffle have concentrated. I shall hold this place to the last.

JOHN C. STARKWEATHER,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

PULASKI, September 24, 1864.

Major-General ROUSSEAU:

I have just returned from a scout. There is no doubt in my mind that forrest is on this side of the river with at least 8,000 men and eight pieces of artillery (I captured 2 of his wagons and took 4 prisoners), and citizens tell the same story.

GEO. SPALDING,

Colonel, Commanding.

PULASKI, September 24, 1864.

Major B. H. POLK,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

All my mounted men moved at 3 this morning, with orders to open communication with Athens, placing strong force at the two important bridges. Your first dispatch this morning says that Colonel Prosser is after the enemy, and now that it is expected I shall attack him, I will do so whenever found, but the two dispatches seem to be not consistent with each other. The information sent you is from Captain Slatery. THIRD Tennessee is Colonel Prosser's regiment, and the regiment having met the enemy at 2 p. m. yesterday it would seem that the information is entitled to some weight. Will keep you fully posted as possible. Have scouts out toward Tennessee River. Have ordered Colonel Pace to move forward, find the enemy, and attack him if found, but not uncover the bridges until he knows fully as to the enemy.

JOHN C. STARKWEATHER,

Brigadier-General.

PULASKI, September 24, 1864.

Major B. H. POLK,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

Have ordered the trains back. Courier just from Elk River bridge and Sulphur Branch trestle. All quiet there. My forces are there, and are trying to communicate with Athens. Lieutenant-colonel of THIRD Tennessee Cavalry, Colonel Prosser commanding, corroborates all that I have telegraphed you. He states this to my officer in command at Elk River bridge, having just returned from near Rogersville. Colonel Spalding and command will be in to-night. Captured man of the Ninth Indiana Cavalry just in, who also corroborates the statements.

JOHN C. STARKWEATHER,

Brigadier-General.
