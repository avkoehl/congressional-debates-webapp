to ¡h  peculiai situations that they bore towards
cei tain subjects It was to be expected, ftom jm
mediate and deep personal interest in certain m-
sti'utions, however obnoxious to the public good,
ther¿ would be found individuals in and out of this
House, always ready to step forward m their de-
ft nee on any and every occasion Sir, it would be
ungiateful in them not todo so, regardless of every
species of diffidence on the occasion The ties of
consangain ty had too a wonderful tendency to
lenuei moit- accutc our sensibilit} , wisen  tne con-
luet of a friend lad been, or was about to be, im-

and almos inevitable consequences, ?nd most fre-
quently piorapted us to action imperceptibly, and
Wi'hou. due consideration  of motives,  but I will
ic nov dwell eithei upon the remarks or course
pu sued by those two distinguished gentlemen,  as
I  design to lotice them more particularly here-
after
Sir, v. hen I reflect upon the character of the op-
position to the present and past Administrations,
upon the peculiar circumstances under which it has
been created, and on which it is know n to act, and
on the peculiar materials of which it has been
made, I am les>t in wonder an 1 surprise that conse-
quences moie, by far more, disastrous have not
befallen to, and been witnessed by, this great na-
tion of freemen, that it has not, is the greatest com-
pliment that could be bestosed upon the great
mass of the ftee and intelligent men of this Repub-
lic Yes, to the immortal honoi of the people will
it be sa d, by the future historian who shall chro-
nica the events, that, under s milar circumstances,
there is no nation of the old world that would not
have been plunged into the most deadly of civil
wars, and have drenched the land with the best
Wood of bxr ow a citi/ens, and which would
have on^inated, and Hit in a blaze a i evolution,
that nothing short of human gore could have extin-
guished S r, I say emphatically, had a similar in-
cident to that which we have all witnessed here,
taken place in any Government in. Europe, ancient
or modern, a revolution, mo«t bloody, disastrous
and fatal, would have inevitably been ihe re ult
Lt us for a moment look at the circumscances
and materials, let us not throw our itenlirn fur
ther back than for the last six c r eight 5 ears, and
contemplate Ki a morrent « at h is transpned
here, and before oui i  n ejes, and none will say
that he ought to uc stn prised at any o( the most ex-
traordinary attempts to confuse and oppose and
thwart every action of thi> Government, even at
the hazard of revolution and bloodshed Nor can
any intelligent, disinterested man say, that he could
reasonably have expected otherwise tnan an indis-
criminate opposition to nearlj ever; measure of
this and the late Administration, without the least
,tgard to right or wieng, its policy or impolicy
How shall we account for this' I have been asto-
nished not to have heard 01 seen, even m the
i ewpareis, that these facts have .iot been alluded
to before, so palpable, so inductive, co admonitoiy
to tht American pet pie, o) the natural course that
should 'iavt been expected, from the very compo-
sition and materials of the opposition to then Go-
vernment, that has kept up one continued scene of
sinfc with the people of thiscountiy evei since the
elect on of President Ja Von to the Presidency of
these United States Could it have been other-
wise, when, as soon a« it was piacticable, nearly
the whole of that very discarded, deitated cabinet
which had been <¡o recentlj defeated and superseded
by President Taeltson and his administration, ai ,
all sir, burning with ret enge, it tie placed iinme
II lately, either m the Senate of the United S ates, or
m the House of Representative, wlv-ie they couid
glut their most malignant appetites upon he ob-
jects and conduct of those by whom trey had been
driven from office into retirement, if not disgrace
I say, sn, could it hate been otherwise' Look to
the Senate, analyze its composition, and with such
disappointed spirits, all thirsting alike for revenge,
seeking out the victims of then disgrace, what
would their conduct not effect in other countries
less enlightened, less intelligent, less pair otic, than
our own' In that body was placed the Prime
Minister [Mr. Clay of Kentucky] of the defeated
Administration to arraign and try and execute com-
petitors who had disrobed him of his ill-gotten
honors It was on their conduct that it had be-
come his daily duty to pass, and, with such feel-
ings, enter on the duties of a judge, to enter up a
decision on their conduct The Secretary of the
Navy, too, [Mr South ird of New Jersey,] of the
same defeated and discarded Cabinet, was also,
with the same feelings, thrown about the ¡.ame time
into the same body, as a co judge of the conduct of
those b/ whom he had been expelled fiom his place
in the Cabinet of a former administration, of the
characiei of whose feelings, as there exhibited, the
public has had the most incomestible evidence
^nothtr distinguished individual, who had had
a personal altercation with the former President,
that had once held an exalted station in the Go-
vernment, was also placed by their sides, m the
same body, all men most distinguished for their
t dents and powers of eloquence, and men who
were not m the habit of brooking an insult, or sub-
mitting peaceably to disappointment and degrada-
tion by an adversary These, sir, were surround'd
by many 01 their adjuncts, most devoted parlisars
and proselytes ftom almost eveiy section of the
countrj The Horse of Representatives, too, has
not been without its portion of these rebuked and
disappointed spirits, upon whom public censure
had rested, whose duty it his become to convulse
heaven and earth to wipe off this foul blot In
the House of Representatives has been placed the
very head of that superseded Administration which
had been condemned by the voice of ihis free peo-
ple Nor, sir, does he stand here alone, but aided
by the powerful arm of one of his former minis-
ters, [Mr Sergeant of Pennsylvania,] who is ever
ready to do him service, and lend a hand in mak-
ing any opposition to the present Administration
and at difieient times, w ithm the same periods,
have we been favored on this floor with the distin-
guished talents of two disappointed and defeated
Vice Presidents, each with their tram of friends
and devoted partisans, all colleagued 111 the holy
office of opposition, mdiscnmaielv, to the measmes
of those by whom th y have been deftatcd before
the pec pie Ntr was it long befoie they united
their destinies v. th a gigant c money ponei, moie
potent than the Government itself, possessing more
amply the means to keep up and carry on a war
against the Government, tnan ihe Government
itself had for its defence against it Such, sir, has
been the position, the composition, and materials,
of the opposition to the past and piesent Adminis-
trations of this country With such materials m
this and the other blanch of Congress, is it to be
wondered at, that panics extiaordmary, and every
other effort to thwart, embarrass, defame, degrade,
and even to revolutionize and disgrace, this Govern-
ment, should be attempted' No, sir, no, sir the
only marvel is, that with such materials, placed un-
dei such circumstances m jour Congress, that a
revolution, bloody, disastioas, and convulsive, of
this great Repubnean empire, has not been effected
Sir, nothing but the hand of Providence could ha; e
prevented it m any other Government than our
own, and much cause have we te congratulat on,
that theie has been found in our blessed native
country j írlue, intelligence and patriotism enough,
amidst the sons of her Democracy, to ward off a
calamity so fatal to the peace, happiness and pros-
perity of our people, and for hae ing effected that
which no nation of Europe could have done, unt'er
similar circumstances, without being deluged m
revolutionaiy blood Sir, the future historian will
be amazed, in recording these facb, at the little mis-
chief that has been done this country by the compo-
sition and position of such materials of an cpposi-
t o 1 to your Government Yet much has been at
templed, and more has been dtsigned, to effe< t a
ltvolution witn tie people TI e leaders 01 the
Opposition, in nv humble opinion, h-> /e been loi g
piepared for 1 , and have been awed fiom the at-
tempt at its excution by no hm? but the unflinch-
ing integrity and intelligence of the people
Yes, sir, no intelligent mind could have misun-
derstood the invocation oí that "revolution, though
bloodless as yet " It gave utterance to an intention
and lecklessness of feelmgs,that the American peo-
ple have not yet properly appreciated, ¡sor rebuked,
and happy this thrice happy people, who have thus
far escaped the mischiefs and intrigues to conjure
up a revo'ution by this modern Philip of Macedón,
to whom life, ?nd fortune, and peace, aad revolu-
tion, and blood, were as a feather, when weighed
in the scale against his malicious and ambitious
projects But with this I have done, and will pro-
ceed to notice, with more minuteness, the character
of the body of the great contending parties now
before the country
Sir, I have, on another occasion, said that the
great political divisions of the two most prominent
parties now contending for power in this country
were composed,, on one side, of the great mass of
the non-p'-oductive classes, and on the other, of the
great productive and laboring classes of this coun-
try, which ever have been the only true great natu-
ral divisions of society since the first organization
of civilized institutions for the government of man,
and which will ever continue to be, to the end of
time, though often interrupted by domestic and
foreign v. ars, which for a time may, and have,
contributed to obscure the original landmarks that
have divided these primary classes, yet, whenever
they have passed away, society has never failed to
revert back to its original divisions, which ever
have been, and aie now, common alike to allcoan-
tries where civilization has proclaimed its domi-
nion Sir, at no time in the history ef our country
has this line of demarcation been so distinctly
drawn as at ihe present moment, a division that has
become, at this time, too palpable and obvious to
escape the observation oí the most superficial ob-
server, and which neither skill nor artifice can
longer conceal from the discerning eye of a plain,
practical, foreseeing people.
Under the speeious name of Whig have all the
elements of the non-productive interests been re-
cently arrayed, which had been formerly known in
this country by the name of Federal, and then
National R pubhcan, party, and which has been
recently augmented by the addition of the Aboli-
tionists and Antimasons, with all their intolerance,
boih of which, however, are greatly subordinate,
m point of strength and influence, to that of the
gieat banking and moneyed interest of the country,
with w hich they have all become now identified
and united in one common interest against the in-
dustry, laboring, and productive classes of the
coun'ry Enlisted, sir, under the Whig party, you
will find every man who aves on the interest of his
money and the labor of others—the banker, stock-
holder, stockjobber, and usurer, every speculator
and man who lives by traffic and chicanery, every
idler and vagabond who lives on the productive in-
dustry of others, which, whenever united, will con-
stitute a force sufficiently large to carrj every city
election in t*is nation, in which places you will
ever find the gieatest proportion of this species of
population to the whole number of its inhabitants.
Sir, what is the fact now' Look at Boston,
New York, Phi'adelphia, Baltimore, Richmond,
and Norfolk, and, until within a few months,
Charleston, New Orleans, and Mobile Sir, what
has been their langi age, and what the character of
their politico Add to ihes°, Providence, Ply-
mouth, Nev Haven, Hartfoid, Albany, [Juca,
Trenton, Brunswick, Elizabethtown, Mornstown,
Harnsburg, Wilmington, Petersburg, Lynchburg,
Winchester, Lexington, Nashville, Cincinnati, Ra-
leigh, Newbern, and hundreds, if not thousands, of
other villages, partaking of their nature and sym-
patmes, and say, sir, what are their political castes,
and by v.hat interest are thev led, if not by the
trail" ckmg, ncn productive, banking interest of the
country, all presenting a uniformity of sen'iment,
demoi stratiug a general cause, beyond the power
of ail earthly contradiction' There is «carcely a
note sha\ er, or pa« ubroker, 01 extortioner, to be
found in any section "f the country, that is not a
member ot that party There is scarcely a gam-
blei, or speculator et'her in stocks or litteries, that
has not espoused the interest of that party Sir, I
admit that there are many hones-t farmers, plant-
ers, and mechanics, who have been won over to its
interest, and are conscientious member;, of it, but
the number that they have been able to delude and
entice into tneir fold is comparatively small, and
they are compelled to act an insignificant part to
