KANSAS CITY, July 18, 1864.

Major O. D. GREENE,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

I am here and would like to hold a conversation with the general commanding relative to affairs in Platte and Clay Counties.

J. H. FORD,

Colonel, Commanding.

SAINT LOUIS, MO., July 18, 1864.

Colonel J. H. FORD,

Kansas City:

What is the present condition of affairs? What do you propose?

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.

KANSAS CITY, July 18, 1864.

Major-General ROSECRANS:

If I had the troops I would send the whole command now lying at Liberty down into Ray County and force them through. If you think best, I will do so, and concentrate all the men I can possibly raise, and go down on this side of the river and try and force them into a fight. I am very scarce of available troops, but I can whip four to one. Just received dispatch from Major-General Curtis that bands of them in neighborhood of Platte City and Weston threatening vengeance against me and my forces and advises that I move a part of my force up there. I cannot divide my command. I think these small bands up the river are only trying to draw all our men in that direction. I await orders. Trouble on every side. Give your orders, and I will carry them out, or at least do the best I can. We need more troops. You will see more trouble in Missouri this year than ever before. I know what I say. I have been among the inhabitants. Have had spies out, and I tell you we will have it on all sides.

JAS. H. FORD,

Colonel, Commanding.

KANSAS CITY, July 18, 1864.

Major-General ROSECRANS:

Todd with 150 men threatening Independence; the station has less than thirty men. Todd's whole force amounts to over 200. I must have my mounted men back. I cannot take them into Ray County without leaving my sub-district unprotected. I shall leave Colonel Draper and his command of 190 men, Ninth Missouri, at Liberty, and withdraw my force, and I will take the field against Todd while his thieves are together.

J. H. FORD,

Colonel, Commanding.
