Captain J. P. WILLARD,Aide-de-Camp:

CAPTAIN: The officers on the point opposite Lookout Mountain say the enemy's shells did no damage to us. I watched out own shells closely, and almost all of them fell short of the top of the mountain. One or two of them struck the crest, but not near their earth-works. The work has just been unmasked, and has three, or perhaps four, embrasures.

Very respectfully, yours,

JESSE MERRILL,

Captain, and Chief Signal Officer.
