Major-General BURNSIDE:

My infantry is already in motion. Am expecting General Shackelford every minute. It will probably be late before Colonel Hoskins gets down. I will push General Shackelford ahead as rapidly as possible. The general has just arrived here. I will make every effort and move everything as rapidly as possible.

O. B. WILLCOX,

Brigadier-General.
