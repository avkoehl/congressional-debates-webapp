follow up the effect at once. General Potter is now on his way to join you, and the general commanding leaves immediately for your headquarters.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Captain and Assistant Adjutant-General.

NY RIVER, May [10], 1864-6.30 p. m.

[General BURNSIDE:]

GENERAL: Your dispatch of 4.20 p. m. received. No attack by the enemy since 12 m. We hold all the ground. The enemy's lines are in rear of a strip of woods. He looks like throwing up some slight breast-works, and there are some indications of planting batteries, but I think it is to defend the road along which their trains have been moving all day. We have thrown up fence-rail breastworks along the whole line, and will do heavier works to-night.

Very respectfully,

O. B. WILLCOX.
HEADQUARTERS,Ny River, May 10, 1864-7.15 [p. m.]

Major-General BURNSIDE:

All quiet. Well entrenched. Feel perfectly easy.

O. B. WILLCOX.
HDQRS. THIRD DIVISION, NINTH ARMY CORPS,Ny River, near Gayle's House, May 10, 1864-10.30 p. m.

Major-General BURNSIDE:

GENERAL: Your note with reference to holding this position is received. If Meade holds his own he will occupy the enemy too much to enable them to mass on me. I think I can hold the position and am willing to take proper risks. The least attempt to withdraw would be actively followed up by the enemy and enable him to mass everything here suddenly on Meade's left.

Very respectfully,

O. B. WILLCOX,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS,May 10, 1864.

General WILLCOX,

Commanding Third Division:

The commanding general directs that you inform your entire command that official information has been received that General Butler has been entirely successful, and is now advancing between Petersburg and Richmond, and is sanguine of complete success. That General Sherman has whipped the enemy and occupies Tunnel Hill
