HEADQUARTERS LEFT WING,La Grange, November 11, [1862] - 8.30 p. m.

General GRANT:

Colonel Lee is not out. He does not wish to start until the morning, and then to make his arrangements so as to enter Holly Springs just at daybreak. He is a little afraid his return may be embarrassed by a larger force of cavalry than he has.

I have directed Quinby to send a brigade with one battery as far as Lamar to-morrow for Lee to fall back upon if pressed. Lee has had his scouts in the front to-day.

C. S. HAMILTON,

Brigadier-General.

LA GRANGE, TENN., November 11, 1862.

General HAMILTON:

I have just directed five companies of cavalry to report to Colonel Lee in the morning, and sent a communication for you to furnish a brigade and battery, just as your dispatch states you have done.
