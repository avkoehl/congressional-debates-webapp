HEADQUARTERS JAMES ISLAND AND THE MAIN, Charleston, S. C., October 19, 1862.

Brigadier General R. S. RIPLEY,Commanding First Military District of South Carolina:

GENERAL: In compliance with your request that I should report what additional forces are necessary to a proper defense of the city of Charleston from an attack by way of James Island and the main-land, I have the honor to submit the inclosed estimate, which I consider as absolutely essential.

In submitting this report I would respectfully call your attention to the want of heavy artillerists. We have several important batteries completed on the main-land that are without guns or artillerists. The guns might be supplied of the caliber 12 and 24 pounders, but we would have no artillerists to man them.

I submit a statement of the present effective force and of what additional forces are necessary against an attack by a force not exceeding 30,000 men.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. R. GIST,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
