1866.
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
m
be the best, but in that which I suppose most
likely to succeed. ' -.  •
There are well-grounded ©bgeetioits to.com-
pensation in the form- of asalary. ; The mode
of compensation by a per' diem allowance is
more just, equitable,- and- in accordance with
the analogies in the State :Legislatures, where
it has always been adopted. ' And this opinion
has prevailed in Congress during the larger
part of our history;' (Affliak'of Congress, first
session. Fourteenth Congress, 1815-16, page
190; Annals of Congress, second session,
Fourteenth" Congress, 1816-17, page 314.)
• The act of Congress of September 22, 1789,
fixed the compensation to March 4, 1795, by
giving a per diem of six dollars, with mileage
at twenty cents per mile. (1 United States
Statutes-at-Large, 70)
Theact of March 10,1796, provided the same
compensation. (1 United States Statutes, 448.)
The act of March 19, 1816, for the first time
provided an annual salary of $1,500, leaving
the mileage unchanged. (3 United States Stat-
utes? 257; Annals of Congress, 1815-16, first
session, Fourteenth Congress, page 458.) This
act was so indignantly disapproved by the peo-
ple, that of all those who voted for it only
three were returned to the next Congress, and
it was repealed by the act of February 6, 1817,
to take effect from the close of that session of
Congress, with a provision against reviving the
repealed act, so that the neA Congress was left
to fix the salary. (3 United States Statutes, 345.)
The act ofJanuary 22, 1818. fixed the com-
pensation from March 3, 1816, at eight dollars
per day, and mileage at forty cents per mile.
(8 United States Statutes, 404.)
This act remained in force until repealed by
the act of August 16,1866, which left the jnile-
age unchanged, but provided an annual salary
of $3,000. (11 United States Statutes, 48.)
The practice of the nation, except during a
period of about twelve years, has been in favor
of the per diem compensation rather than a
salary. Rawle, in his work on the Constitu-
tion, declares that—
"The compensation ought to bear as exact a propor-
tion a8 possible to the time employed. An act of
Congress was passed a few years ago (March 19,1816)
in wnicn a gross sum was allotted for an entire ses-
sion. The dissatisfaction it occasioned produced an
early repeal."
I know it has been urged that the tendency
of a per diem compensation is to lengthen the
sessions of Congress.
I cannot conceive it probable that such effect
wouldfollow; butifmembers eouldbeinfluenced
by such motive then with a salary the desire
to avoid the personal expenses of a long ses-
sion would be a motive to immaturely hasten
or omit to act on at least some necessary busi-
ness, and this is a vastly greater evil than
long sessions or much speaking. Long ses-
sions are not generally an evil. The presence
of the Legislature is necessary to arrest exec-
utive usurpation, to correct abuses as they
arise, and to prevent their occurrence. (Fed-
eralist, No. 53.)
The stupendous usurpation of Andrew John-
son in exercising unauthorized legislative power
in the reorganization of illegal State govern-
ments in the rebel States would never have
been attempted ortolerated if he had performed
his duty by calling Congress together early in
1865 to settle the whole subject of recon-
struction.
Even in the States where biennial legislative
sessions have been authorized, the experiment
has been found disastrous. In Ohio, where
the constitution of 1851 authorized biennial
sessions, the Legislature has held annual ses-
sions by adjournment over during all the time
except in one year, that of 1855.
If a per diem allowance should lengthen the
sessions, public measures would be better ma-
tured; and if thereby Congress should to some
extent become a logocracy, its much speak-
ing would have the advantages which always
flow from mature discussion. This mode of
compensation is more just, too, because it pays
for time employed, and not like a salary for
time whether emploj'ed or not. The law can-
not fix the length of all the sessions; the busi-
ness to be performed alone can do so, yet a
salary unjustly assumes that equal compensa-
tion should be made for all sessions long or
short, with much or little business.
But the pending bills have not attempted a
change so great as sound policy would sanc-
tion, for they only seek to restore the salary
as it existed before the increase made byihe
act of July last. And now we are met with
the question, is the salary of $3,000 per year
adequate and just?
It was once said in debate that—
"The object of giving a per diem to members either
of the State or national Legislatures was not by way
of compensation for their services, still less to re-
munerate them for sacrifices of pecuniary or personal
advantages of any kind. The real object was to en-
able individuals whose private means would not
enable them to attend the sessions of the respective
Legislatures, to meet the moderate and reasonable
expenses to which they mustneeessarily be subjected
by their attendance on them, and to the end that the
country might not be altogether deprived of the ser-
vices of men in narrow circumstances, from their ina-
bility to suffice to this extra expense. Henee.and in
the same spirit a moderate and reasonable allowance
was made for traveling expenses, not at such a rate,
however, as would be required by the nabob of the
South," * * * * "whoeannotgetalong
without his carriage and two horses and two black
servants and two dogs."—IXitger's Speech, March 7,
1866, Annals first session Fourteenth Congress, page
1163; Harrison's Speech, January 6,1818, Annals first
session Fifteenth Congress, pages 278, 279, as to mile-
age.
If this were true that members should only
he paid "the moderate and reasonable ex-
penses to which they must necessarily be sub-
jected by their attendance'' on Congress, a deci-
dedly sweeping reduction should be made in the
salary. But it is palpable that such was not
the design of the Constitution, for it declares
that members " shall receive a compensation
for their services.'' The spirit and purpose of
this provision contemplate such reasonable
and .moderate compensation for services as
the average talent employed would command
in other occupations equally arduous and as
nearly similar as may be. This would include
not only "the moderate and reasonable ex-
penses of attending Congress'' butmoderate and
reasonable recompense besides, for all these
are included in the idea of " compensation for
services.'' It cannot include compensation '1 to
remunerate for sacrifices of pecuniary or per-
sonal advantages,'' for these are not proximate
consequences of or necessary incidents to the
position of a Senator or Representative, and
could never be "ascertained by law" because
they would differ with the condition and cir-
cumstances of each member. I am perfectly
aware that no uniform compensation can do
exact justice, and all that can be secured is an
approximation to it. The same salary may
not with equal and exact justice compensate
some of the Representatives from California
and the mining regions or from large oities, as
it would those from the agricultural districts,
for there is a wide disparity in rents, taxes, ex-
penses of living, and rates of wages generally.
I will not inquire whether it would bo just to
discriminate, but that is impracticable and the
Constitution seems to contemplate a uniform
rule, which should be made not for exceptional
cases, but with a view to a general and just
average.
And now, in the light of these principles, a
comparison of congressional compensation
with the salaries paid to the highest judges of
the State courts, which it is fair to presume
are reasonable and just, will support the meas-
ures for which I am contending.
In the National Almanac and Annual Record
of 1864 I find the salaries of the highest judges
and of the Governors stated for twenty-four
States thus:

X Chancellor, 62,500; chief justice, £2,100.
I Chief justice, $1,200.
The average annual salary of these judges is
$2,433 each. Their expenses I know are less
than would be incurred in attendingthe sessions
of Congress, but the difference in salaries erei^
before the act of July last leaves a margin for
that.
I might cite additional salaries, both official
and unofficial, but they are sufficiently familiar
and with rare exceptions prove by way of com-
parison the justice of the measures I am urging..
The return of incomes under the internal
revenue law affords additional evidence. The
Commissioner of Internal Revenue under date
of December 14, 1866, says:
"On theSth ultimo I addressed a circular letter to
the assessors directing-them to forward to this office
the number of persons on the May annual assess-
ment list of 1866, tn each of the three following
classes:
"1. The number who returned a net income of
$1,000 or less.
"2. The number whose net income was over $1,000
and not over 35,000.
"3. The number vrhose net income was over$5,000.
"Six hundred dollars exempted by law was to be
included in each case, Returns have been received
from 207 of the 240 collection districts. The total
number so far returned in each of the classes is as
follows :
1st class 209.231
2d class .179,627
3d class 33,812
The bills on this subject have been intro-
duced with the more confidence because the
provision sought to be repealed was agreed to
by a meager vote in the House, and in opposi-
tion to its matured opinion, twice solemnly and
almost unanimously expressed.
It was agreed to on the report of a committee
of conference in the hurry of the last morning
of the session, under the previous question
without an opportunity for discussion, by a vote
of 51 for to 50 against, with 85 members absent.
(Part V, Congressional Globe, Thirty-Ninth
Congress, first session, 18G5-6, page 4288.) That
final vote cannot, therefore, be the deliberate
judgment of a majority of the whole House.
Mr. WILLIAMS. Is not the gentleman
from Ohio aware of the fact that the decision
of the House was confirmed unanimously on
the motion to lay the motion to reconsider on
the table?
Mr. LAWRENCE, of Ohio. There was no
recorded vote on that question.
Mr. WILLIAMS. There were no votes
against it.
Mr. LAWRENCE, of Ohio. There was no
recorded vote, and it is fair to presume that
the result would have been the same as on the
passage of the bill.
Mr. RANDALL, of Pennsylvania. Does
the gentleman know of a single member who
did not take the extra pay?
Mr. LAWRENCE, of Ohio. I do not.
Mr. MAYNARD. I ask the gentleman from
Pennsylvania [Mr. Randall] to restate his
question.
Mr. RANDALL, of Pennsylvania. I asked
the gentleman from Ohio, whether he knew a
single member of the House who had not taken
his pay, and he said he did not know one.
Mr. MAYNARD. I deem it due to myself
to say that I did not take it until after thd
matter had gone before the great body of the
American people, in all but six States. \-\ hen
I found that the gentleman who had taken it
