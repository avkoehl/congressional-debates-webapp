JANUARY 2,[1865.]

Major General B. F. BUTLER,

Commanding Dept. of Virginia and North Carolina, Fort Monroe:

GENERAL: I have the honor to refer you to the bearer, Second Lieutenant Dobbs, Nineteenth U. S. Colored Infantry, as escaped prisoner from Columbia, S. C., as to the manner in which Captain Shad. Harris, [Third] Tennessee Cavalry, is treated by the rebels. Captain Harris has bee in the hands of the rebels for two years, and has had all the indignities heaped upon him by his brutal captors of which even they are capable. You will learn from the statement of Lieutenant Dobbs the falsity of the assertion made by Mr. Ould that Captain Harris was not in irons.

Trusting, general, to the efficacy of your measures with rebels to secure the release of a zealous,high-spirited, and gallant officer of our service, who has suffered long and uncomplainingly,

I am, respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. P. CARTER,

Brigadier General and Provost-Marshal-General of East Tennessee.
