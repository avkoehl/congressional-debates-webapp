HDQRS. SECOND DIVISION, SIXTEENTH ARMY CORPS,Before Blakely, Ala., April 8, 1865.

ASST. ADJT. General, HDQRS. GENERAL STEELE'S COMMAND:

SIR: I have the honor to report that my skirmish line on my left is between 200 and 300 yards from the enemy's works, that the line recedes as it extends toward the right and at that point is some 600 or 700 yards off. I have one battery of four 10-pounder rifled guns on the left of my right brigade, and three Napoleons in center of my middle brigade, and one Napoleon in works a little to the rear and farther to the left. My line was attacked last night by quite a force, but did not succeed in dislodging my skirmishers. My right is still considerably in advance of General Veatch's left, and I must now wait until connection is made. My works are being strengthened. I am building a battery for two 100-pounder guns on my extreme left.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

K. GARRARD,

Brigadier-General, Commanding Division.
HEADQUARTERS SIXTEENTH ARMY CORPS,In the Field, Ala., April 8, 1865.
