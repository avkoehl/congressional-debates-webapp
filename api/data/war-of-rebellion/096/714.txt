BUCKHANNON, W. VA., February 26, 1865.

Colonel N. WILKINSON,

Clarksburg:

I started a scout for Beverly this morning. One of the men has just returned. Says they met the corporal that was in charge of the scout sent yesterday about four miles from here on foot. He told them a squad of the enemy was halted by the sentinel about 9 o'clock. They immediately fired a volley and charged them. Supposed the man on duty to have been killed. He escaped through the back of the building in which they were quartered for the night. Don't know whether any one else got away or not. Saw nothing of the operator or repairer since.
