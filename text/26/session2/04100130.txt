The estimated receipts into the
Treasury from the sale  of the
public lands for the present year
are just about the same as the ac-
tual leceipts of the last year, and
either bum is                   -           -   3 500,000 00
Tins will leave an annual balance
-   of ihe annuities and Revolution-
ary pensions, over and above the
while cmrent  proceeds of  the
land>, of                                         #273,928 75
This will be about the true state of things for the
last and the present years It is true that the pay-
ments for Revolutionary pensions are now dimi-
nishing, from me death of the pensioner , more ra-
pidly than they are increased by new applications
and admissions under the existing laws, and this
diminution will be annually more and more rapid,
it further legislation dees not prevent it. It is also
true that many of ihe Indian annuities are for
terms of years, and the expiration oí such aonui-
h ties may Mnk the amount of payments under that
head, ii new treaties do not make a corresponding
addition So also the annual sales of lauds may
be extended in future years, and thus this compari-
son be changed. But at pre ent there are no nett
proceeds lrom the lands, if thee two single
Kjnu are made an annual charge upon them Still
theie are constant annual chaiges ot the highest
necessity, which are not included here, and which,
by the admission of all, vhould be deducted w ar-
rive at the nefi proceeds for distribution He rt-
lerred to the ord nary expenses of ihe land system,
of the General Land Office here, ot ihe various lo-
cal land offices, ot survey*, and all those classes of
expenditures which are paid by annual appropna-
tioñs from the Treasury, and not by commissions
«pon the money collected These expenses cannot
fall short of, and are more likely to exceed, half a
million annually. He had caused them to be as-
certained for the five years, commencing wuh 1833
and ending with 1337, to be used for another pur*
pose, and during that period they averaged more
than one million per annum. Those, howaver,
weie years, or at least some of them, when ihe
surveys and «ales were unusually extensive. Still
half that average, he thought, could not be exces-
sive tor oidinary years It should not be forgotten
that no mention is here made of annual payments
lor holding new treaties, for new purchases of land
from the Indians, and tor the many other constant
but uncertain expenditures growing out ot ibe ac-
quirement oí mle, management, and sale of these
laud , mil nothing is said oí the expenses of the
lrtquuii Indian wars wh ch have attended the exe-
cution ot tht various treaiie , and ihe clearing the
lands ftom Indian possession
He would npw pas's to another part of the argu-
ment. He had already said that the light ot the
Sutes to the distribution propo^d, and the power
and duty of Congress to make it, had been attempt-
ed to be tested upon the deeds of cession from the
Slates to the United States, and the alleged ob] ct
and purpose of those cessions He had previously
attempted to 'how that neither those deed , nor any
ol (he proceeding'-, either on the part of the States.,
or the Üu ted States, presented any resting place
far the assumptions in question He might, how-
eve , )i.iv been mistaken in his efforts to accom-
plish J at ojjfct, and it would be too great an ex-
htoitiori of unity o'l his part to say he had accom-
plished niiat he had hoped to accompli h upon
¡hose poi'i He must, therefore, pursue the ar-
s>uni -ut funnel Sjppose he had wholly failed to
* establish tho e positions, a consequence followed
fiom which tnere was no escap-, and that he
would now state
No right of the S atrs, or power or duty of Con
gress, based upon the deeds of cession, could apply
to any other than the ceded tern i ry Th s must
be admitted, for whether ihe ce s o is contained
upon ihsir face reveisionary rights to the ceding
States, or remainders over to all the States, no such
rights could attach, or be valid, ei her in law or
«quity, beyond the limits and interests of thp estate
covered by Ihe deeds; ihe estate to which the gran-
tors m ths deeds claimed tuie or interest. He
would not for * moment presume that any Senator
would atlempt to pu*h the right of ths States to a
distribution of the proceeds, ot the public lands upon
such grounds beyond this limit, and he would ther"
fore proceed to show how far short of the ground
covered by the proposition before the Senate this
justification of its principle and equity would be
found to cover
The boundaries of the cessions weTe, invariably,
all the lands situate without ard beyond certain
defined-limits, northerly, westerly, or southerly,
and without any prescribed extent, or spscified
limit, north, west, or south. The limits of the
ceding ^States in those directions were fixed and
defined, and ti e grants were of all ths lands be
longing to the granting State wuhout and beyond
its boundaries. The most which can be asked,
therefore, as the outer limits of the ceded lands, is
the outer limits of the United States as established
by ihe definitive trealy of peace of 1783 This
mu't follow from the fact that the lands, whether
in fact the property of the Confederation of States,
or of the seven ceding States, were held by con-
quest in the war of the Revolution, and cannot be
supposed to extend beyond the boundaries fixed in
the treaty which terminated the war, aDd fixed the
limits of territory for ike bell gerent parties The
western anl s-ouihern of these boundaries are now
alone material, as tho northern and m rthwes ern is
the present limit of British and American posses-
sions The western and sou'hern of these bounda
ríes, beginning upon the Lake of the Wood , are
described m the treaty as follow

slialghttothe head ot St Maiy'a liver, and thence down alo ig
ihe middle of fit Maiy's nvcr to the Atlantic Ocean "
Thus making the middle of the Mississippi
river the western, and the thirty-first degree of
north latitude the southern boundary of these
cessions. With these boundaries, the ceded lands
do not include any of the territory west of the
Mississippi, and the Territory of Iowa and the
Stales of Missouri, Arkansas, and Louisiana, and
all the country west of them, are free from any
claim of the States growing out of the deeds of ct -
sioa. So, a's>, those parts of the States of
Mississippi and Alabama, south of ihe thirty-
first degree ot north latuude, and the whole
ot the Territory of Florida, are equally untouch-
ed by these grants It may be well further
to specify whit the grants do not touch, be
fore seeing what they did cover and convey. They
did not, ihen, touch any portion of the o'd thirteen
States, as at present bounded, or any portion of the
present States of Maine, Vermont, and Kentucky.
A very small portion of the State of Tennessee was
ceded by ihe deed of cession of North Carolina, but
the remnants of land were so scattered, and so bad-
ly located, that the Government has never yet sup-
powed it a mattei of inteie&t to cause their survey,
or to open a land office and attempt a sale of lands
within that State Indeed, it seems now certun
that nothing is to come to the common Treasury
fi om tin1 pub ic lands in Tennes ee, as a bill passed
ih s body at its last session, without a dissenting
vo e, to cede the remnants of those l/rils to ihut
Slaie without compensatu n, and a similar bill has
agiin pa<ced by the same vote, at the prese it te -
st< n Thus Ihe whole cession ot North Carolina is
disposed of, without bringing one dollar into the
Treasury, (or he f tind lhat the law for the admis-
sion of the State of Tuinessce, described the State
as "all the territory ceded to the Unutd States by
the S aie of North Carolina " He did not mention
this fact to the prejud ce of that old, pa'notic, Re-
publican Stale Her cession had given to the
Union one of the proudest of th? present sisters of
the family, and it was made with a patriotic devo-
tion to ilut Union not inferior to that which go-
verned the action of any other of the seven ceding
State* Yet when a claim for a reversion, or an
equitable remainder, was interposed against this
Governmen', a fact like this spoke volumes in re-
lation to ihat equity. It showed, beyond the power
of question, wnai nefi proceeds one of the ceding
S ates would receive, it the right ot reveision to
the ceding S ates alone should be admitted, and the
equity claimed should be adjusted by that rule.
There h ere other fact? of a somewhat similar
character, to which it might be well to refer in this
conrection Tfte cession of Georgia was last made,
and comprehended all those portions of the States
of Alabama and Mississippi which iire north of the
thirty-first degree of north latitude, and it is daily
contended hsie, by the friends of this proposi-
tion for distribution, and has been regularly
so cortended, ever since the Cherokee controversy
has been known to the country, that the Federal
Government, by the terms of this cession, had con-
trac ed to pay all and more than ths ceded lands
were in fact worth And ever since the late Che-
rokee treaty, extinguishing the Indian title to the
lands in the State of Georgi?, 'his argument, which,
previous to that period, was only hypothesis, has
been assumed is demonstration. The nett proceeds
of the Georgia cession, then, must be much like
those of North Carolina—nothing Virginia is
claimed lo have made Ibe great and material ces-
sion, and yet Virginia did not cede Kentucky, the
only part of the great unappropriated country, in
all probability, falling within her chartered limits,
Kentucky was constituted a State from the acknow-
ledged bounds of Virginia, as was Maine, at a
much later day, from those of Massachusetts.
These facts were not mentioned, or referred to, for
the purpose of delracung from the patriotic libe-
rality, public spin', and devotion to the Union, of
Virginia. Fír/umit She claimed ihe territory
northwe t of the Ohio rather by coi quest than by
ch irteied right, and she ceded her claim, whatever
it might be, as a coma on fund to the Union, upon
terms wh eh } et sbow, up< n thar face, that her ob-
ject was Ihe extto-ion of tho^e free Republican
principles she 1ms ever so dearly cherished, and so
fearlessly main amed, raiher than any pecuniary
consideration to herself, or even to the Union.
These facts however, show that from all the
ceded territory southwest of the Ohio, no nett pro-
ceed  were to come, or ever can come, into the
common Treasury, enher for distribution or for any
other purpose.
It would be proper here to extend a little farther
an idea following from a former position of his ar-
gument. He had attempted to show, and he
thought upon unsnswerab e grounds, that if any
right of remainder, or leversion to the ceded lands,
or to their proceeds, whether legal or equitable,
can be sustained in favor of any ol the States,
it must resuit to the ceding States only, as it
was only asserted and claimed as an infer-
ence and consequence of law or equity, fiom
Ihe grants, and the alleged object and purpose
of the grants. He now wished to inquire, upon
the supposition lhat such a right should be admit-
ted, what would be the stats of things with the
ceding States He found, upon a careful exami-
nation of Ihe deeds of cession, that the descnp'ions
of the territory ceded by New York and Massa-
chusetts were identical, and without sloping to in-
quire where, within ihe present bounds of the
United Slates, lhat territory was, who should de-
termine what the rights of these States would re-
spectfully be to such remainder or reversion' Let
the cessions of Connecticut and Sou'h Carolina be
examined with the same view, and let those who
could, answer these inquiries
He would now proceed to show where and what
the ceded lanes in fact were, regardless of the
que tton as to what State may have originally
owned them, or what Stale may now be entitled to a
remainder or íeveision of them, or their proceeds.
Tho e portions of the States of Alabama and Mis-
sissippi north of the thirty-first degree of north
latitude, the Sutes of Indiana, Ohio, Illinois, and
Michigan, and the Territory of Wiskonsan, em-
brace the country, and, from a calculation made
at the land oil ee, which he held ro his band, the
whole number of acres, within those districts of
ceuntry, were,                                      231,773,379
From this quantity, the number cf
acres reserved in the deeds of ces-
sion, were            -           -           -       7,226,405
Leaving the the number of acres acta-
