General SCHOFIELD:

General Howard's conduct to-day had an excellent effect on his command. After the firing has ceased he walked the line, and the men gathered about him in the most affectionable manner, and he at once gained their hearts and confidence. I deem this a perfect restoration to confidence in themselves and leader of that army.

General SCHOFIELD:

If you have not already a command by one of your batteries of the Decatur road and railway, clear out the trees, so that your shot and shell can reach them easily about the brick house you burned.

Let one of your batteries, 20-pounder Parrott or Napoleon, throw a shot into Atlanta every fifteen minutes during the night, partly for effect and partly for signals to our cavalry.
