I only ask for two, and will go in with one. I fear we put off the attack too late, but it is a great consolation to us to know that it was neither our wish nor fault that Mobile was not taken last year or last month.

Very truly,

D. G. FARRAGUT,

Rear-Admiral.

WASHINGTON, March 3, 1864 - 3.30 p.m.

Major-General GRANT,

Nashville, Tenn.:

The Secretary of War directs that you will report in person to the War Department as early as practicable, considering the condition of your command. If necessary you will keep up telegraphic communication with your command while en route to Washington.

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.

STRAWBERRY PLAINS, March 3, 1864.

Major WHERRY,

Aide-de-Camp:

The pontoon bridge cannot be laid before this evening; it had to be taken up last night to save it. General Whipple telegraphs to me March 1, Chattanooga, that General Thomas is willing that General Schofield shall retain Spears' brigade, provided General Schofield will return the other troops belonging to the Army of the Cumberland, whose services are very much needed.

EDWARD E. POTTER,

Chief of Staff.

KNOXVILLE, March 3, 1864.

Major-General SCHOFIELD:

Colonel Crawford has just informed me that he has reliable information that Martin's cavalry, thought to be 4,000, are encamped between Newport and Wilsonville, near Big Pigeon River. I have no fear of their coming here, but think the information may be valuable to you.

DAVIS TILLSON,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers.

CHATTANOOGA, March 3, 1864.

General G. GRANGER:

Send a brigade to Calhoun, and telegraph what one you send and who is in command. Further orders will be sent.

WM. D. WHIPPLE,

Brigadier-General, Chief of Staff.
