[General W. S. HANCOCK:]

GENERAL: Colonel Miles has advanced a skirmish line into the woods, say 1 mile. The colonel commanding reports no enemy except squads who were seen setting fire to the woods and fences. The whole of Miles' front is covered by a dense smoke and the fire would prevent our advance. The cavalry who connected with Miles has moved, so the connection is lost. See sketch inside [following].

Lieutenant-Colonel and Chief of Staff.

Major-General HANCOCK:

You will immediately detach a division of your corps to proceed to the vicinity of Hawkins' Church, or where the Reserve Artillery is, and accompany and escort the Reserve. This is urgent, as reliable information indicates the enemy having sent a force to the Rapidan fords. Hawkins' Church is on the Chancellorsville pike.
