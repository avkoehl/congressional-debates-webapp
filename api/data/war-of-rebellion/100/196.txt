HDQRS. DEPARTMENT AND ARMY OF THE TENNESSEE,Wilder's House, near Hinton's Bridge, [April 13], 1865.

Major General F. P. BLAIR,

Commanding Seventeenth Corps:

DEAR GENERAL: I have just returned from Raleigh; saw General Sherman comfortably fixed in the governor's mansion with many citizens, among whom were ex-Governors Graham and Swain. The latter wished to see you very much. Vance sent out his aides, &amp;c., to meet Sherman, but they were intercepted by Hampton, and afterward by Kilpatrick, and Vance, hearing they were arrested, concluded to flee. The Fourteenth Corps is garrisoning the city. Kilpatrick is pushing directly after Johnston, now about twelve miles toward Hillsborough. We will pass straight through Raleigh and encamp to the northwest of the city to-morrow night. I think you will find it better to lay the pontoon instead of following the Fifteenth Corps.

Respectfully,

O. O. HOWARD,

Major-General.
