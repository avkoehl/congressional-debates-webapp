DISTRICT BANKS.
Mr. JOHNSON, of Arkansas. The Commit-
tee on Printing, to whom was referred a motion
to print the petition of citizens of Georgetown, in
the District of Columbia, praying that the bill re-
ported by the select committee to restrain th 
issue of bank notes in the District of Columbia,
may not become a law, have instructed me to re-
port adversely to the printing, and to move that
it lie on the table, on the ground that it is only
of interest probably to the select committee that
have the subject-matter of that bill under their
consideration. I move that it lie on the table.
Mr. SL1DELL. I move that it be referred to
the select committee on that subject.
Mr. JOHNSON, of Arkansas. 1 think that is
the proper direction; but I did not deem it proper
to take the responsibility of proposing it. 1 with-
draw my motion.
The motion to refer was agreed to.
MINNESOTA LAND GRANT.
Mr. JOHNSON, of Arkansas. The same com-
mittee have had under consideration a motion to
print the report of the Secretary of the Intmor,
in answer to a resolution of the Senate, submit-
ting an estimate of the quantity of land which will
inure to Minnesota for railroad purposes, under
the act of March 3, 1857, and report adversely
to its printing. The report is of no very great
length; it is so short that any member of the Sen-
ate can read it in a minute; it will not make two
pages; and, indeed, hardly one, of octavo size.
We do not believe it will be of any avail at all to
print it; but we think it will lead to calls from
other States for reports showing what each State
is entitled to receive, or has received, and this
would lead to a large amount of printing in the
end. It is unnecessary, because any indi\idual
member can get the information without the cost
of printing. 1 report against its printing, and I
ask that the report be adopted.
The report was concurred in.
DEPARTMENTAL PRINTING.
Mr. JOHNSON, of Arkansas. The Senate,
some days ago, on the motion of the Senator from
Michigan, [Mr. Stuart,] adopted the following
resolution:
11 Resolved, That the Committee on Printing be instructed
to inquue, and leport to the Senate, what amount has been
paid annually timing the last five > ear^, to each of the print-
ing establishments in the city of Washington, for punting
and advei tiding of any land, for the United States, other than
thai ordeied by either House of Uongie^s, whether done by
the direction of any Depaitment, or civil or mihtaiy officer
theieof. Also, whether the &ame has been paid under tho
piovi-aoiis oftheexi-aing law, and whethoranyamendmcnt
of existing laws is tieocs^aiy, in Older to secure proper econ-
omy in the pt Hiring expenditures of the Government j and to
repoit by bill oi otheiwise."
There are facts called for in this resolution that
no doubt are desirable. There are other duties
imposed on the committee, by virtue of this reso-
lution, which will take some considerable time for
them to fulfill. I refer to that part of the resolu-
tion which says they shall inquire "whether any
amendment of existing laws is necessary." The
committee are now engaged on the subject of
amendments to existing laws, and will prosecute
that inquiry with as much rapidity as they may
be able, until they bring forward such measures
as they believe should be adopted by Congress.
The resolution goes further, and directs an in-
quiry to be made as to the cost of public printing
done in this city not by order of Congress. The
proper mode of procuring that information is, of
couise, thiough the heads of the different Depart-
ments. The committee, therefore, ask to be dis-
charged from the further consideration of the res-
olution, trusting that the Senator from Michigan
will bring in a resolution calling on the heads of
the Departments to state to us the cost of printing
of that character; and it will come more appro-
priately and satisfactorily before the Senate by
that means, we think, than by the process pro-
posed by the honorable Senator. The Commit-
tee on Printing have instructed me fro ask that
