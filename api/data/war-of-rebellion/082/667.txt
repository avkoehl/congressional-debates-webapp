reported to be captured almost entire; also, the Fifty-eighth Massachusetts and Second New York Mounted Rifles, and the Second Maryland Volunteers are almost entirely captured, besides several hundred of killed and wounded left upon the field. The line from which we advanced this morning is so weak that it is in great danger. I beg leave to call the attention of the commanding general to the fact that my division is reported as nearly annihilated, and cannot therefore possibly reoccupy the position from which it advanced this morning.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

ROBERT B. POTTER,

Brigadier-General.

P. S.-General Griffin sends me word that General Bartlett fell into the enemy's hands. My brigade commanders report that a very small proportion of the wounded were removed from the field.
