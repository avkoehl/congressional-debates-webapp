WASHINGTON, October 21, 1864.

Lieutenant-General GRANT,

City Point, Va.:

As it is manifest that no troops can at present be taken from General Sheridan's command, and as the vessels collected at Alexandria are wanted elsewhere, and involve enormous cost for demurrage, I have directed General Rucker to use them for other purposes. They can be collected again in week or ten days if required. Nothing satisfactory from Missouri. I can form no clear idea of the condition of affairs from reports received here. General Curtis seems to be fighting near Independence, but I hear nothing of Rosecrans, A. J. Smith's or Mower's divisions. No action yet as the change of commanders.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.

CITY POINT, VA., October 21, 1864-6.30 p. m.

Major-General HALLECK,

Washington, D. C.:

I think it would be well to send Canby the orders you have prepared. If he was within telegraphic communication I would not have them sent until it was known Sherman had started.

U. S. GRANT,
