Colonel GRIMSHAW,

Fairfax Station:

There is a current rumor that Stuart, with several thousand men, is preparing to make a dash at the Orange and Alexandria Railroad, with the view of breaking it up between Accoting and Manassas. Use your spies and scouts freely on the south side of the railroad toward Dumfries, so as to get timely notice of such an attempt, should it be made.

POOLESVILLE, MD., August 14, 1863

(Received 12. 30 p. m.)

Major T. T. ECKERT:

About 6 or 8 cavalrymen rode through this place this morning, and went about 5 miles below here, toward Darnestown, and inquired for Colonel Dawson, revenue collector. He was not at home. They took 3 horses from his place. A little after 4 a. m. they returned, passing close by my office. Captain Means' officers say none of their men were out last night; say also they heard that White was at Waterford and intended crossing last night, but the report came too late for them to send out scouting parties. I am quite confident that it was a party of Confederates.
