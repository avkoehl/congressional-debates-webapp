[special messenger], with the delivery of the same. I avail myself of the occasion to express the very high gratification I feel in being able to announce to you the accession of this ancient State to the Confederate States of America; and most devoutly do I pray that this union, strengthened by all the kindred ties of climate, pursuits, and institutions, may perpetually "promote the general welfare and secure the blessings of liberty to our people and their posterity. "

To which I beg leave to add assurances of the very high consideration with which I am, your obedient servant,

W. N. EDWARDS,

President of the Convention.

Ship Windsor Forest cleared from Liverpool on 27th of April, with munitions of war for this Government. Her charter was for Quebec; really, however, for Southern port. Her real course to the Gulf lies by the south side of Cuba. She will be near Cape San Antonio by the 1st of June. She should be advised of blockade. Can you put pilot-boat on this duty?
