NASHVILLE, TENN., November 26, 1864-10 p.m.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Washington, D. C.,:

The wires not having been in repair, I have not heard from General Schofield to-day. The telegraph operator at Franklin reports that he heard cannonading during the day, but not heavy. The detachments of General Smith's command left at Memphis when he went to Missouri reached this place to-day. The commanding officer thinks General Smith's advance will reach here to-morrow or next day. Your dispatch of 12 m. to-day is received. I will dispose of the troops as authorized therein and should it be necessary to call for the militia of any of the States, I will notify the Adjutant-General. Nothing from Stoneman to-day.

GEO. H. THOMAS.

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding.

Rear-Admiral LEE,

Mound City:

If you have any iron-clads which can resist heavy shot I will be obliged if you will order them up the Tennessee River as far as they can go on a reconnaissance. Hood is threatening Columbia now, and I am anxious to know positively whether he has all his force with him or not.
