days

The number raised the first seven days was 674, being an average of about 96 per day; the number raised the second seven days was 785, being an average of about 112 per day, and increase in the average of the last seven days of 16 per day. This statement does not include substitutes in anticipation of the draft enlisted elsewhere that at our office in the Part, in regard to whom we are not advised, but to which there must have been quite a number. This average is the largest we have ever reached since we commenced the business of raising volunteers in November, 1863. From the 20th of November, 1863, to the 17th of March, 1864, inclusive, under the call for 500,000 men, the whole number of newly enlisted men paid the bounty was 7,995, being an average of a little over 81 men per day.

From the 18th of March to the 31st of May, 1864, under the call for 200,000 men, the whole number of newly enlisted men paid bounty was 5,426 in sixty-four days, being an average of a little less than 85 men per day. Of these enlistments nearly one-half were for the Navy, which are now very much restricted. From the 7th of july to the 30th of September, 1864, under the call for 500,000 men, the whole number of newly enlisted men paid bounty was 759 in sixty-eight days, being an average of little over 11 men per day. From the 20th of November, 1863, to the 30th of September, 1864, we paid bounty on 230 days, and during that whole period there were only twenty-seven days in which the gross number of newly enlisted men paid bounty reached 100, while the average for the whole 230 days was but little over 61 men per day. It will also be found on investigation that the average enlistments for the Army under the existing call have been nearly double that of the most favorable period of enlistments during that past two years; and considering the adverse circumstances under which we have labored up to this time, we are certain you must credit us with having used all due diligence in the matter. We would also beg to call your attention to the facts that nearly all the men enlisted by us now are for three-years" service; that the whole number of
