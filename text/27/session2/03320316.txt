crease the tauff above the maximum of tjieCompiomiseact, to
repeal that p-ovioion of the Distribution act, which íequiresits
operation to be suspended if a duty of more than 20 percent be
demanded to support the Gwernment to íetrenchand econo
mize the expenses of Government
To which Mr Wright 1 ad proposed amendments—in favor
of practical economy, by abolishing useless offices by lopping
offall unnecessary expenses m Congress and all the Depart
merits of the Government, and by repealing the Distribution act,
so a*, to rendei any inciease of the tariff above the C mpromise
act, or any new burdens on the people unnecessary

therefore he assumed that the strongest presumptive evidence
existed that no other meaning than that entertained by the
fi lends of protection, could be given to the power to regulate
commerce-even to the total exclusion of foreign manufac
tuied articles, which cheek and compete with domestic manu
factures
What, after all, he asked, was this power  but a power to pro
tect the labor of this country from being hound dow n and para
lyzed by the pauper laber of foreign nations'* The only ques
tíon could be, whether the nation or the gta es should
have the power of this protecting domestic labor, and arguing
from the analogous powers delegated by the Constitution—the
taxing power, treaty power, and power to make peace oi war,
as well as every other accorded to the General Government,
he maintained that the protective power belonged to the
game delegated agency, and was to be found in the
taxing power and ue power to regulate commerce
He reiterated that this powei was demanded by the peo
pie in the formation oí the new Constitution, and rofeiiel
to thepiocessionsof trades convened to-celebrate as a jubilee
the insertion tf this power to regular commerce, in the Con
s'jtufmn, osa full andsat^factoiy protection of 'hen interests
He al«o referred to the debatea of the Convention, to enow that
the strongest argument urged against the old Confederation,
was its inability to give ampie protection to homeindu&tj} in
consequence of not being invested with any power to regulate
commerce
In conclusion, C imploredthe Senate so to e-seici^e the powers
of tho Constitution as to be not le*s neglectful of i ational nte
rests than werethefiamersof theinstiumentitsetf If so miny
Congresses and so many Presidents had lured rhe manufactu
íers of America into the invpstment of all their capita], and
much of their ctedit, in the promotion of home industry, would
it, he asked be just, wise, oi politic, now to deny them that pi o
Cection which had thu^become doubly then duel
