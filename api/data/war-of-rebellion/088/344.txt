battle. One good volley well put in will render the enemy's line powerless. When the firing continues and but few bullets come back, the firing must cease and a thin skirmish line advanced, and a division commander can order a charge or an advance whenever he deems it advisable without waiting for further sanction.

By command of Major-General Warren:

FRED. T. LOCKE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND DIVISION, FIFTH CORPS,August 20, 1864.

Lieutenant-Colonel LOCKE,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Fifth Corps:

COLONEL: I have the honor to report that the line remains the same. My pickets are confronting the enemy's. Occasional shots are exchanged. I send you a report from the calvary officer sent out to the left. He speaks of a raid being in progress around to our left. My front is about as strong as it can be as a single line. The enemy made two attempts along the railroad last evening after the line was re-established and were driven back handsomely.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. B. AYRES,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND DIVISION, FIFTH CORPS,August 20, 1864.

Lieutenant-Colonel LOCKE,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Fifth Corps:

COLONEL: I have the honor to report that the cavalry pickets report the enemy felling timber on my left beyond the road which comes into the railroad to our front. The work is going on briskly. I have just now a report that the enemy are marching a large force of infantry down to our left of the road mentioned above.

Very respectfully, yours,

R. B. AYRES,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,August 20, 1864 - 7.30 a. m.

Brigadier-General AYRES:

GENERAL: The major-general commanding is of the opinion that what the enemy are endeavoring to [do] on your left is to get some artillery around there to fire over this way, and if they do they will not be able to touch your line.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

FRED. T. LOCKE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
