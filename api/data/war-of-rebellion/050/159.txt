Commanding Officer, Bridgeport, Ala.:

Report at once situation of brigades at Bridgeport. Have you heard of any enemy in vicinity? After everything has crossed at that point take up the pontoon part of the bridge and float it around, and defend the island to the last. Have your patrols down the river. Do you hear of any enemy in that direction? Make every disposition to prevent enemy from crossing. Be sure that all transportation is across before taking up bridge between island and this side.
