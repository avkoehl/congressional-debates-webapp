FORT MONROE, VA., July 25, 1866.

Commanding OFFICER MIL. DIST OF FORT MONROE,

Fort Monroe, Va.:

SIR: I report the health of state prisoner Jefferson Davis to be somewhat better than on the 18th instant. The febrile symptoms then showing themselves have yielded to medical treatment. This with the moderation of temperature has caused the improvement. He is still very feeble, has scarcely any appetite, and is in low condition.

Your obedient servant,

GEO. E. COOPER,

Surgeon, U. S. Army.
HDQRS. MILITARY DISTRICT OF FORT MONROE,Fort Monroe, Va., July 30, 1866.

General E. D. TOWNSEND, Assistant Adjutant-General:

GENERAL: I have the honor to report the health of state prisoner Jefferson Davis about the same as in last week's reports. There has been but little change in his condition for several weeks. I do not think he improves either in appearance or strength, although he has every attention, both of the post surgeon and his wife, and the best of fare.

I am, general, most respectfully, your obedient servant,

NELSON A. MILES,

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers.
HDQRS. MILITARY DISTRICT OF FORT MONROE,Fort Monroe, Va. July 31, 1866.

General E. D. TOWNSEND, Assistant Adjutant-General:

GENERAL: I have the honor to report state prisoner Jefferson Davis as looking very well to-day and quite cheerful. His counsel, Mr. O'Conor, visited him to-day.

Most respectfully, your obedient servant,

NELSON A. MILES,

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers.
