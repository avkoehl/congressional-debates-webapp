Delived the inclosed commission to the parties named:

HENRY MAURY and GEORGE BLASKESLEE:

You are authorized by the Government of the Confederate States of intercept and seize all transport carrying supplies and munitions of war for the Government of the United States. This authority will protect you, in the event of your capture, from being treated as pirates; but the transports seized will not be your prizes, but your share must be determined by the Congress.

LOUISVILLE, April 12, 1861.

Honorable L. P. WALKER:

DEAR SIR: Yours of the 9th by Mr. Hooper is at ahnd. I will write immediately to the captains of different companies to be in readiness, and I doubt not we will eb enable to rendezvous here in a very few days, if ordered to do so. The companies are in different counties, some at a condsiderable distance, but can be easily concentrated upon a given point I three days. It has been my intention to take them by boat to memphis, which can be done at a small cost, and from there they can go to any designated point by railroad. It might be just as well
