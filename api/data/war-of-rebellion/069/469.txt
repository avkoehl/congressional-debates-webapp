NEW CASTLE FERRY, June 1, 1864.

General AMES:

GENERAL: The general commanding corps directs that until further orders nothing be allowed to join us by the road on the south side of the Pamunkey. You will remain in your present position at the White House till further orders. All messengers will communicate with us by the road on the south side of the Pamunkey. Colonel Gregg's cavalry has been ordered away to join General Sheridan, so you will use the squadron of cavalry you have to picket the roads. You will need to keep a sharp watch. One division of cavalry is at Cold Harbor. Two verbal messages to the above effect have already been sent.

Respectfully, &amp;c.,

N. BOWEN,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIRST BRIGADE, THIRD DIVISION,June 1, 1864-6.25 p. m.

Major-General SMITH:

With assistance on our right and left we can hold the woods and rifle-pits. Our center is firm.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: I am in receipt of your dispatch* to hold on to Cold Harbor, and will do so if possible. I have ordered General Davies' brigade to Cold Harbor. It is not a full brigade, as some of it is at Bethesda Church. I have been very much weakened by the brigade sent to White House.

Clingman's brigade was rounded with Fitzhugh Lee's cavalry yesterday, and 61 of his men captured instead of 15, as heretofore reported. Butler's brigade of South Carolinians was with Fitz. Lee's division, and is well represented in prisoners. The fight on the day before yesterday was with Hampton's division and Butler's brigade. Hampton's division was relieved early yesterday morning by Fitz. Lee, who came from Atlee's Station.

P. H. SHERIDAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
