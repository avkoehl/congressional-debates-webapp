Major Pringle informs me that the has telegraphed Nelson's battalion to be at the wharf at Fort Johnson by 12 to-night. This, with the Twenty-fifth and Twenty-seventh [South Carolina Volunteers], make up 1,500 men to move to-morrow. He cannot say when Eleventh South Carolina Volunteers and Twenty-eight Georgia can be moved, but will say definitely in the morning.

Mean time, hold Twenty-eight Georgia ready to move. Is this satisfactory?
