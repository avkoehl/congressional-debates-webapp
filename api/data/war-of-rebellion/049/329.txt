our right. I believe we can whip him in any fair fight, even by attacking.

If you wish, I can push forward again and see what is going on in my front, if you are still in doubt about the enemy's movements.

I am very tired, or I would come down to see you.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN.

[P. S.]-The officers of the corps are very much delighted with your compliment, and I am more than pleased-am very grateful.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

The enemy, I believe, had a thin picket line at dark along Bull Run. We could see a little force at Manassas, but could not say how much. I think there is no considerable force in my front.

The Fifth Wisconsin will leave for Washington this afternoon. Shall I arm the new organizations coming in from the interior of the State? It will perhaps save time to send them on direct.
