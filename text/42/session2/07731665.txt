of Lueyna Hathaway, praying for arrears of
pension, submitted an adverse report thereon.
Ho also, from the same committee, to whom
was referrsd the petition of Eleanor C. Ram-
sey, praying for arrears of pension, submitted
an adverse report thereon.
He also, from the same committee, to whom
was referred the petition of Bridget Trainor,
praying for arrears of pension, submitted an
adverse report thereon.
He also, from the same committee, to whom
was referred the petition of William J. Wright,
praying for arrears of pension, submitted an
adverse report thereon.
He also, from the same committee, to whom
was referred the petition of Susan Patton, the
widow of a soldier of the war of 1812, who was
married after the termination of the war, pray-
ing for a pension, submitted an adverse report
thereon for the reason that the petitioner does
not fall within the spirit of the statute.
He also, from the same committee, to whom
was referred the petition of Ann Moxley, the
widow of a soldier of the war of 1812, praying
for a pension, submitted an adverse report
thereon, on the ground that her husband did
not serve the length of time the law required
but falls within a general class which the law
has excluded.

was referred the petition of John H. Felber.
who was a mail-carrier in Nebraska, employed
in the civil service, and got frozen in driving
the mail, asking for a pension, reported ad-

Mr. FERRY, of Connecticut. The Commit-
tee on Patents and the Patent Office, to whom
was referred the bill (H. R. No. 1835) for the
relief of Levi Bisseli, and aiso the petition ol :
Levi Bisseli, have instructed me to report ad-
versely upon both, with a request that the com-
mittee be discharged from the further consid-
erationofthe petition, and that the bill be indef-
initely postponed. The petition is in the nature
of an appeal from the decision of the Commis-
sioner of Patents upon an application for an
extension. The committee think it contrary to
public policy to entertain petitions which are
in the nature of an appeal from the decisions
of that officer, and in this particular ease they
think the decision of the .officer was right. I
therefore move that the bill be indefinitely
postponed, and that the committee be dis-
charged from the further consideration of the
petition.

indefinitely postponed, if there is no dissent.
