APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
121
40th Cong....2d Sess.
Report on Southern liailroads.
Ho. oi? Reps.
igatlon required by the following resolution,
December 4, I860:
"Resolved, That a committee of five be appointed
to examine into and report to the House of Repre-
sentatives, at the next session of Congress:
" The past and present relations existing between
tho Federal Government and tin; railroads in the
States lately in rebellion;
"The amount of money expended by the United
States authorities in constructing, repairing, equip-
ping. and managing said roads;
"The amount of money each of said railroad com-
panies is owing to theGovernment, and all otberfacts
that may bo deemed of importance in connection
with these subjects;
"And Uioy shall also report what, in their opinion,
would be the proper course to be taken by the Gov-
ernment in regard to such railroads or railroad com-
panies.
' The committee shall be authorized to send for
persons and papers, and, when thought necessary by
them, may employ a clerk, and may report progress
at any time."
On the l'2th July, 1867, the duties of the
committee were enlarged by the following reso-
lution :
" Resolved, That the select Committee on Southern
Railroads be instructed to inquire into the expediency
of reporting a bill declaring forfeited to tho United
SUtcsalllandsgrantedbyCongiess in the year 1850 to
Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, and Ark-
ansas. to aid in the construction of railroads, which
grants have now expired bv limitation."
Upon this resolution, as to the forfeiture of
lands in five of the late rebel States, the com-
mittee do not now report, as the information
sought by them through the War Department
has not yet been furnished. And this subject
will require another and separate report.
The testimony upon the other subjects referred
to the committee on which the present report
is based, is comprised in two volumes, to wit:
Report No. 34, House of Representatives,
second session Thirty-Ninth Congress, referred
to this committee, and Report No. 0, first ses-
sion of Fortieth Congress, made by this com-
mittee ; to which references are made in this
report, as detailing facts more minutely and
sustaining its more general statements and
the conclusions to which the committee have
arrived.
The magnitude of this subject and import-
ance of the principles involved have rendered
it extremely difficult to confine a report within
the usual limits ; but it will be as concise as
possible for a proper understanding of the sub-
ject, without imposing the necessity upon others
of reading two volumes of testimony.
Acting under your instructions the com-
mittee take up the various brandies of the
subjects in the order in which they are pre-
sented in the resolutions.
PAST AND PRESENT RELATIONS.
First. "The past and present relations exist-
ing between the Federal Government and the
railroads in the States lately in rebellion."
To speak in general terms, as the Federal
arms were victoriously extended over States
and portions of States lately in rebellion the
railroads, with few exceptions, were seized and
possessed, and thereafter during the rebellion,
and for some months after the cessation of
hostilities, occupied the relation to the Gov-
ernment of captured property and were used
for military purposes in the transportation of
troops and supplies.
To define this relation more fully and, at
the same time, to disclose the testimony, if
testimony apart from the familiar history of
the country be needed, the committee here
give statements of distinguished witnesses, both
as to the facts and their opinions of the law.
On pages 238 and 200 of Report No. 34, above
named, are words of Hon. 13. M. Stanton,
Secretary of War, as follows:
"The .seizures of the railroads in the rebel States
and tho theater of war were regarded by me as acta
of war under tlio war power, and as being among what
has always been regarded as the mostimportant meas-
ures of war." "The sciauref were mado by tho com-
manders in the field without reference to any other
consideration than depriving the enemy of their use
and applying them to their own, t,o fnr as X have any
knowledge." " I conceive that the military command-
ers, as the agents of the Government, had the un-
doubted rightto seize the roads exactly as they would
seize any other property of the enemy in time of war,
either for the purpose of injuring the enemy or for
tho purpose of using them themselves."
And Secretary Stanton (see page 271 of Report
No. 04) when asked "in regard to tho act of
Congress nndcr which the roads were taken pos-
session of throughout the Union," replied:
" I do not regard that act of Congress" Lof January
31,1S62J "as applying to any ease except the cases in
the loyal States."
And on page 212 of Report No. 34, President
Johnson seems to have entertained the same
view, as the president of the Kast Tennessee
and Virginia Railroad Company says :
"The President declines to appoint tho commis-
sioners under that act, on tho ground that the act
does not apply to railroads in the rebellious States."
On page 256 of Report No. 34, Quartermaster
General M. C. Meigs uses these words:
" X have always thought that our right to tako and
use t his property during the war arose from the gen-
eral law ofw.tr, the same as taking a battery of artil-
lery. I cannot compare a railroad to anything more
properly than to a battery of artillery, or rather to a
park of artillery, as it is a most powerful and efficient
auxiliary or instrument of war against an opposing
force."
On page 14 of Report No. 34, Colonel A. H.
| Markland testifies he "was, as special agent
: for the Post Office Department, with the advance
of the Army from the time General Grant first
moved until the Army was disbanded," and
says :
" We took possession of them and used them for the
benefit of tho Army. Wo also took possession of the
rolling stock and whatever appertained to the rail-
road as n matter of military necessity.'' "I knot?
every railroad wo did capture we used as a matter of
necessity; frequently fighting for a piece of railroad
to use it."
On page 25 of Report No. 34, General l. S.
Trowbridge testifies:
It was necessary for tho Government to use these
roads for military purposos. They wereindispensabl©
to the Government; it could not get along without
them."
On page 236 of the same report General E.
R. S. Oanby testifies :
" They were held as captured property and for the
benefit of the Government, and so used in any way
they could be used."
On page 160 of the same report General
Philip II. Sheridan testifies :
" Thoy were treated as eapturcd property; that was
my idea; and therefore rightfully belonged to us;
and we used them as wo pleased; destroyed or re-
paired them as occasion squired."
The committee might be regarded as under-
estimating the intelligence of the House and
the country were they to do more upon this
point than add the words of Secretary Stan-
ton, page 269 of Report No. 34 :
"Nobody doubts my opinion that these seizures
were * a legitimate exorcise of the rights of war.'"
It appears from the testimony of General
M. C. Meigs, on page 255 of Report No. 34,
that the matter of southern railroads became a
subject of consideration, more or less, from the
beginning of the rebellion, and that u the sys-
tem grew up gradually to meet necessities as
they arose" in connection with the quartermas-
ter's department.
This system became so immense that it was
familiary called the military railroad depart-
ment.
To the officers connected with this department
the committee are much indebted for the in-
formation which they are here enabled to give
in a more condensed form.
Other testimony corroborating the reports of
these officers, introduced as testimony, show
that forty-two railroads were seized and oper-
ated by the United States Government in the
late rebel States, the names of which roads
here appear, with the terminal stations^ their
length, the dates at which possession was taken,
and when they were returned to the companies:
