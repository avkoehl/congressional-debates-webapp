STtii CoNtt....2d Sess. Public Debt, Liability, and Expenditures—Mr. Vallandigham.
Ho. oj? Reps.
and theotherDemocraticmembersofthis House,
who put forth recently a certain "address" to the
people, have been unsparingly denounced here and
elsewhere forasserting that the public debt to-day,
the end of the present fiscal year, amounts to
#from seven hundred to one thousand million dol-
lars, and that the expenditures average now from
two to near four million dollars per day.
Now, sir, upon what authority did we assert,
and had we a right to assort it> No Democratic
member of this'House has access, or at least fa-
miliar access, to tlic Treasury Department, none
certainly to its secrets. We have not the means
of knowing, by the inspection of its records, what
amount of indebtedness hasalready been incurred,
nor what the expenditures are. Such access and
means of knowledge belong alone to the Repub-
lican members of the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives, and above all to the members of that
party which compose the Committee of Ways
and Means in the House, and the Committee on
Finance in the Senate, and whose business it is
to deal with the Treasury.
A large, a generous charity, therefore, I say,
ought to be extended to us who, after three and four
months' repeated and specific statements officially
from Senators and Representatives as to the
amount of debt and expenditures, have but put
upon record before the people that which we de-
rived from their authority. I propose then, sir,
in the first place, to review and collate what has
been said upon this subject within the past eleven
months in this House and the Senate.
On the 25th of July, 1861, the chairman of the
Committee of Ways and Means said:
" It must be recollected that the demand on the Ticas-
ury is well nigh a million dollars a tiay."—Congressional
Globe, extia session, 1861, p. 267.
Again: on the 5th of August, 1861, ten days
later, he said:
" I am alarmed at the expense we are incurring. This
day, and every day foi some time, the nation has incurred
an expense ofsome one Million two hundred and fifty thou-
sand dollars. J cannot &ec wheie the money is to come
from."—Ibid., p. 448.
That, sir, was before the notion that the Con-
stitution authorized the making of the promissory
notes of theUnited States, oranything else except
gold and silver, a " legal tender," had ever entered
the brain of any one, and before the Secretary of
the Treasury had compassed and devised his ex-
traordinary scheme of a grand national paper mill
for the manufacture of money by steam.
Again: thegentleman fromMassachusetts, [Mr.
Dawes,] who was thrust forward here the other
day as the advocate to defend, upon special re-
tainer, and abet the Secretary of the Treasury in
his deliberate effort to underestimate the true
amount of the publicdebt and daily expenditures
of the Government, and who, by some sort offinan-
cial legerdemain, contrived to prove them to be
somewhat less than one million dollarsa day, him-
self, on the 13th of January last, said:
"Mr. Speaker, it takes $2,000,000 every day to support
the *\riny m the field."
Mark1 you, not as he here subsequently sug-
gested, that on that particular 13th of January, or
the day before or the day after, or any other one
day, that was the expenditure, but " every day."
And this, too, for the Army alone.
But he proceeds:
"One hundred millions have been expended since we
met here in the beginning of December, upon an Jinny in
repose.
Ah! indeed. Why, sir, that is at the rate of
§2,380,000 a day for the preceding six weeks, with
the Army " in repose." He adds:
" What they will be when that great day shall atrivc—if
it shall ever airive—when our eyes shall he gladdened with
the sight of the Aimy in motion, Ido-notknow.''—Congres-
sional Globe, 1861-6:2, vol. 2, p. 299.
Well, sir, our eyes were at length " gladdened
with the sight of the Army in motion." The
grand army of the Potomac did actually move;
and yet is then of all others precisely the time
which the gentleman selects for severe censure
upon members on this side of the House for in-
timating the mere suspicion that the expenses
which he could not even estimate might be seven
or eight hundred thousand dollars^more a day
with the army c< in motion" than his own state-
ment of the expenditure for the same army " in
repose."
But he proceeds again:
" Another $100,000,00(1 will go with this, as the $100,-
000.000 more i have here enumerated, outside of the daily
support of Uie Army, have gone"—
Outside of the daily support of the Army, in-
deed ! Why, sir, that is $200,000,000 in six weeks,
or at the rate of $4,760,000 a day. Oh, what a
" traitor" to assert it!
"Another $100,000,000, 1 &ay, rnu&t be afflBed to this be-
fore the 4th of March!"
How long before the 4th of March ? But $300,-
000,000 for full three months are $1,200,000,000 a
year; or, if he means only §200,000,000, that
itself is at the rate of $800,000,000 a year for the
Army alone, to say nothingof the other legitimate
expenses of the Government, nor of the gigantic
plunder and peculation which have disgraced it.
But the gentleman fromMassachusetts proceeds
next in elegiac strain:
" Sir, what it may eost to put down this rebellion, I care
very little, provided it may be put down j but, sir, faith with-
out works is dead, and I am free to confess that my faith
sometimes fails—-my faith in men, not m the cause.*"
Thus heavily and despairingly, on the 13th of
January, the Pilgrim of Massachusetts bore upon
his vicarious back the huge burden or pack of the
sin of this Administration's indebtedness, as he
struggled on sorrowfully in the financial Slough of
Despond; what cross—what sort of a " cross" it
was at the sight of which, some months later, this
vast burden rolled from his shoulders, no doubt
some future Democratic Bunyan, languishing in
the cells or casemates of your military prisons,
will hereafter disclose.
On the 28th of January, 1862, the gentleman
from New York, [Mr. Spaulding,] a member of
the Committee of Ways and Means, said:
" But with a Navy and an Army of six hundred thou-
sand in the field, requiting, with the other expenses of the
Government, an average daily expendituie oi' more than
$1,600,000"—
How much more? But at that sum alone, it
equals $584,000,000— ^
" this new system of banking will not afford relief to the
Treasury m tune to enable the Secretary to meet thts press-
ing demands that are made upon him."—Congressional
Globe, 1861-62, p. 524.
Again: on the 4th of February, 1862, the gen-
tleman fiom New York, [Mr. Roscoe Conkling,]
assuming to estimate the expenditure, oidinary
and extiaordinary, from that date to July 1,1862,
at $300,000,000, said:
"This last item is at the rate of $2,000,000 per day for
one hundred and fifty days. If $45,000,000 a month is taken
as the estimate, the item will be $225,000,000. But Jt will
then reach $300,000,000, because there Is an item of a hun-
dred millions nearly which will be payable at the close of
the war, growing out of bounty acts, and it has been no-
where included."
And estimating the entire debt to July 1, 1862,
at $806,000,000, he exclaimed:
"Eight hundred and six millions! Who can credit these
figures when he remembeis that the world's greatest trage-
dian closed liis bloody drama at St. Uulena, leaving the pub-
lic debt of France less than seventy millions of pound*?"
Rank disloyalty, all this! Sir, had I presumed
to speak thus, my fidelity to my country would
have been utterly denied, and the gentleman from
Massachusetts would have added at least one page
more to the suspicions and innuendoes of his
speech of the 27th of May. The gentleman from
New York adds:
" This enormous debt amounts, for each congressional
distilct lepreaented upon thisflooi, to$4,210,000, and when
the war is ended it will be more than five million dollars.
Let every gentleman ponder upon the fact that there is more
than tlnee hundred thousand dollars of interest to be paid
every year by his congressional district."—Congressional
Globe, 1861-62, p. 635.
Again: in the letter of the Secretary to thegen-
tleman from New Hampshire, [Mr. Edwards,]
setting down the public debt at a more moderate
figuie than any one else, nevertheless declared it
" appalling," estimating it at $650,000,000 upon
the 1st of July, 1862.
The chairman of the Committee of Ways and
Means again, on the 6th of Febiuary, said:
"The daily expenses of the Government are now about
$2,000,000. Tocairy us on until the nevt meeting of Con-
gress would take $600,000,000 more, making, before legis-
lation could be had at next session, about $700,000,000 to
be provided for. We have already appiopriatod $350,000,000,
making our entire debt $1,050,000,000."— Congressional
Globe, 1861-62, p. 687. *
On the 12th of the same month, the chairman of
the Committee on Pinancein the Senate, the Sen-
ator from Maine, [Mr. Fessenden,] said:
"Sir, we are contracting a large debt. At the end of this
fiscal year, (July 1, 1862,) I suppose It will be, in round
numbers, $750,000,000; and at the end of the succeeding
year, if the war should continue, $1,500,000,000."—Co -
gressional Globe, 1861-62, p. 765.
Still further: on the 19th of February, the gen-
tleman from New York [Mr. Spattlding] said:
" One million six hundred thousand does not cover the
daily expenditures."— Congressional Globe, 1861-62, p. 883.
And, on the same day, the gentleman from
Maine [Mr. Pike] estimated our " enormous ex-
penditures at from one to two million dollars a
day." (Congressional Globe, 1861-62, page 887.)
Still further, the chairman of the Committee of
Ways and Means, [Mr. Stevens,] on the 20th
of February, 1862, said:
" Now,in less than a year, taking the public debt at what
my colleague makes it—J make \l more—$1,200,000,000,
what will the interest be upon it at seven and three tenths
per cent., for it will all center at that rate of interest?"—
Congressional Globe, 1861-62, p. 900.
And again, on the 8th of April:
" I suppose our debt on the 1st of July next will not be
less than $[800,000,000. When some time since I had occa-
sion to addict the House on the Ticasury note bill, I stated
out daily expense"? at $2,000,0(10. 'fhey 5lre now, and have
been for some time past, over three million dollars a day.
It ls'plam, thcreiore, that the sum i have stated will be
inther below than above our indebtedness at the end ol' this
liscal year."— Congiessional Globe, 1861-62, p. 1577.
And the Senator from "Maine, [Mr. Fessev-
detf,] again, on the 30th of May, declared that,
taking the old debt and the appropriations for the
years 1861-62, the whole amount would reach
§670,000,000; and added:
"The Senator can judge for himself whether, taking into
consideration the odds and ends, unsettled claims, defi-
ciencies, &e., which will bohkelytocome in upon us, we
shall fall shoit of $700,000,000."— Congressional Globe,
1861-62, p. 2M6.
On the 31st of May, the Senator from Iowa,
[Mr. Grimes,] said:
"The Senator said yesterday, I believe, that the pub-
lic indebtedness now was only $550,000,000, and ihat the
amount of interest we wore paying was only a little up-
wards of four per cent. But when you eomo to examine
that, you lind included the amount that was unliquidated,
that was out^tandim«, that had not been reduced to writing,
and we do not know mueh about, and was not drawing in-
terest at all; and when we sttuek the balance then, it re-
dueed the average rate bomewheic in the neighborhood ot
lour and a half per cent, i predict that our indebtedness
will amount at the end of the yeai to $1,500,000,000. You
cannot approximate to the amount of it now. You have
got ten thousand incidental expenses growing out of this
war. You have got to pay damages, untold damages; no-
body can compute them. 1 think that tiie real expenses ot
the war will be one third greater than they are nominally.
" I have not the most remote idea that the Secretary of
the Tieasuryoi anybody else knows what is the amount, or
can come within several million dollars what will be the
expenses of the present fiscal year. 1 presume all the char-
ter parties for all these vessels that have been engaged m
transporting Hoops during the first two months have not
eomo in to be settled at the end of this quarter.
" Mr. Harris. Ten months have.
" Mr. Grimps. We are talking about what are the ex-
penses of the picsent fiscal year. They come in quarterly.
The«se re turns have not been made during the last two months,
and during that time this army has been transported, and wc
have employed a very large amount of transpoi tation, the ag-
gregate of which 1 have no moans oi teaching, but 1 know
it ii immense.
" Mi. Harris. There is no use in deceiving ouiselves
about this tiling. I have heard so much clamor here about
spending two or three millions a day, that F want the truth
to lie known.
" Mr. Grimes. The truthis, there are none of us who know
anything about it. We can come within a hundred millions
of it, probably, and not nearer."— Congressional Globe, 1861
-62, p. 2474.
Strange to say, this declaration was made in the
'Senate some days after the speech of the gentle-
man from Massachusetts.
On the 6th of Junc5 the chain nan of the Finance •
Committee of the Senate, [Mr. Fessenjden,] said:
"I gave the other day, and X can give perhaps a little
more accurately to-day, the amount of those appiopriations
for the pre^entyear. The appropriations for the year ending
June 30, 1862, were, at the second session of the Thirty-
Si vth Comjro^s,.^!,000,000, and at tiie special session, and
at this session of Congress thus far, $5^5,000,000, making
.$•606,000,000. Then if you add to that the old debt of
$70,000,000, >ou have $870,000,000 as the total amount.
Gentlemen musi be perfectly aware from their experience,
when you take into consideration the state of the country
at the pie-*ent tune, theconttacts that have been made, the
outstanding claims, the expenditure* of which no iceord,
necessarily, can be made in a time like thus, with so vast an
expenditure, and the deficiencies that we aie callcd upon al-
most every day of the session to meet, that>ou may safely
add twenty or thirty million dollars to that estimate winch
I have thus stated, and in that way you have got a little
