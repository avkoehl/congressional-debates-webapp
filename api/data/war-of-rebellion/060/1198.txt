the fortifications or on some light duty, with the understanding that they be returned to these hospitals when their services are again required. The matrons will be retained. The medical officers attached to these hospitals will be assigned to other duty. As regards Winder Hospital, it is deemed advisable to pull down every alternate building, in order to give free ventilation and to secure them from entire destruction by fire. The buildings thus torn down can be re-erected in the fine grove adjoining the division of Surgeon Dudley.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. P. MOORE,

Surgeon-General, C. S. Army.
HEADQUARTERS, Wilmington, February 25, 1864.

His Excellency the PRESIDENT:

SIR: I beg to call your attention to the importance of a suspension or partial suspension of the writ of habeas corpus in this command. Many writs are being sued out under the authority of Judge Pearson, of the supreme court of this State, a man whom I believe to be a traitor, if not open at least at heart. If you would suspend the writ simply so far as relates to soldiers and parties liable to military service, I think the ends proposed in the recent action of Congress would be attained for the present.

I beg leave to inclose herewith an extract from this morning's Confederate. *

Very respectfully,W. H. C. WHITING,

Major-General.

[Indorsement.]

SECRETARY OF WAR:
