commanders are very anxious to send. Will leave here in the morning; will reach Barboursville on Tuesday. If you are sending more troops this way, send 6-mule teams, for it is almost impossible to get along with 4 experience teaches.

HEADQUARTERS POST, Natchez, Miss., September 14, 1863.

General CROCKER:

I send you a copy of a message I have just received from Colonel Malloy.

The bearer of the message tells me that he left Colonel Malloy 3 or 4 miles this side of Cross Bayou, and he met the First Kansas still farther this way, coming toward Vidalia.

The Eleventh and Ninety-fifth Illinois are at Vidalia. Shall I send, or rather shall I go out with, a force in the morning? If I go I would like to take some artillery with me. I can't tell whether the enemy has got over Cross Bayou or not.

I do not think there are more than 200 men at Cross Bayou, but I leave the matter to you, and will cheerfully do whatever your order.

I am, general, very respectfully, &amp;c.,W. Q. GRESHAM.

[Inclosure.]
HEADQUARTERS SECOND BRIGADE, SIXTH DIVISION, Cross Bayou, September 14, 1863.

General GRESHAM,Commanding Post:

From the best information I can get, the enemy is now in force at Cross Bayou.
