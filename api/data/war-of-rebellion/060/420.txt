These suggestions, though not directly called for in the letter, are of such manifest importance that I have improved the opportunity to direct attention to them. The proportion of material as called for in the letter should be as follows, viz:

For a train of twenty-four boats:

Articles. 	 Number.	 Articles. 	 Number.

Boat-wagons (each	 24	 Carpenter's tools-

loaded with 7 balks.)	 	 Continued.

Chess-wagons (each	 10	 Hand-hammers	 2

loaded with 60 chesses	 	 Broad-axes

Tool-wagon	 1	 Augers (From 1/2 to	 3

 	 2 inches)

Forge, containing a	 	 Chisels (from 1/2

complete set of	 1	 to 2 inches), set	 4

blacksmith's tools for	 	 Draw-shaves

shoeing, &amp;c.

follows:	 	 balks)

Cross-cut saws	 2	 Extra long balks	 14

Hand-saws	 2	 Wagon (for long	 1

 	 balks)

A liberal supply of cordage should always be taken.

The pontoon and chess wagons as now arranged and repaired by Captain Ford at this depot are the most complete and reliable.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WESLEY BRAINERD,

Major Fiftieth Regiment New York Volunteer Engineers.

Respectfully forwarded.

I would call attention to the remarks in regard to the trestles. I have always found them unreliable. They are bulky, costly, and of little use in the field. I would also suggest that the claw-balk is unnecessarily bulky and might be replaced with advantage by common balk cut of the same length as the claw-balk (20 feet 8 inches), with iron claws let into the wood and the ends chamfered to allow for the rise and fall of the boat without displacing or splitting the chess. a
