Unless the weather should be very unfavorable the track will be laid to the bridge on the night of the 18th. The siding will be put in then as soon as the track reaches that point. I ordered an additional force of bridge-builders to the river early to-morrow morning, and if we can get the timber to the road the bridge will not detain us long. One locomotive, narrow gauge, has arrived at Morehead, which I will have unloaded and at work immediately. The axes asked for by Major Cox were not sent forward to-day, because the wires were down and my dispatch did not get through.

CHIEF QUARTERMASTER'S OFFICE,

DEPARTMENT OF NORTH CAROLINA,

Wilmington, March 15, 1865.

Major-General SCHOFIELD,

Commanding Department of North Carolina:

GENERAL: I have the honor to inform you that I have been to Fayetteville, N. C., and have seen General Sherman. He leaves for Goldsborough to-day. I sent him all the coffee and sugar that the commissary had at this depot; also forage. General Sherman informed me that he can spare 500 wagons from his army if necessary. He has sent all of the refugees, white and black, to Wilmington, and has directed me to send the black to General Saxton, at Beaufort, S. C., and all the whites who cannot find employment here to New York. I have furnished General Terry's corps with 129 wagons. He leaves to-day. I shall send supplies up the West Branch of the Cape Fear to [South] Washington. General Sherman is anxious that the work should commence as soon as possible on the railroad. No material yet arrived. General Sherman is well and the army all in good spirits. He will be at Goldsborough, he thinks, on the 21st instant. The armory at Fayetteville was destroyed; also the factories.

Very respectfully, your most obedient servant,

GEO. S. DODGE,

Brevet Brigadier-General and Chief Quartermaster.
