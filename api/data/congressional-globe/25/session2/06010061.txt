Senate.
sideration this, subject of the invasion of the right
of petition , and from Kentucky, a slave country,
he had this morning received a letter from one of
the most intelligent men, in which he says you
cannot maintain jour ground, beware how you
attempt it Th s is a point on which I know I
differ from the Senator5 and I should regard noth-
ing-moie fatal than a deliberate determination of
this body to invade the right of petition Does not
every State claim in tne District equal rights^
There is but one measure more fatal than the in-
vasion of the right of petition, and that is to adopt
the concluding resolution of the Senator from
South Carolina I make no imputation against his
motives but that his act may be fatal to the peace,
and may endanger the Union of (he country, is to
be seriously apprehended
The last objection was that the tone of the
amendment was subdued, but with what propriety
is this charge1 It is in language as strong as ever
was used You cannot aboh«h slavery ■without a
breach of the public faith Can any thing be
stronger'    It equals the Constitution itself
And then that you cannot abolish slaveiy with
out mischievous and dangerous results Is this
undertoned' Sir, in public life, I prefer firmness
and decision unaccompanied with rashness or vio-
lence
Mr BUCHANAN inquired if he was to under-
stand the Senator from Kentucky as having modi-
fied his resolution
Mr CLAY said he would readily do so, as it
appeared that it would render the resolution more
acceptable to the Senate Mr C accordingly
struck out that part of the resolution, relating to
compensation to the owners of slaves
Mr HUBBARD then called for the reading of
the original resolution, and it was read accord-
ingly
Mr CLAY said that there was one observation
peculiarly applicable to the resolution under con-
sideration He believed that we had but one Ter-
ritory, that of Florida, and how could we assert
that the abolition of slavery m the District of Co-
lumbia, and the Territories of the United States
would be a violation of faith, implied m the ces-
sion of the District, since Florida was acquired
twenty years after the cession
Mr CALHOUN said that the part of the reso-
lution referred to by the Senator from Kentucky was
inserted as an amendement offered by his colleague
He presumed that his colleague referred to the
District of Columbia only
Mr PRESTON, with the consent of the Senate
modified his amendment, so as to append the words
" violation of ft>e public faith, implied m the ces-
sion of the District of Columb'a," at the end of
the resolution
Mr KING of Alabama said his principal ob-
jection to the resolution of the Senator from Ken-
tucky had been removed by the modification the
honorable gentleman had himself made, as it stood,
it was to him very objectionable He was not
prepared by any action here, to give to the people
of any portion of this country the idea, even by
implication, that the public money could be ap-
propriated to liberate slaves in this District, or in
the States or Terntories The Senator from Ken-
tucky had, with a becoming spnit of liberality, re-
moved that objection, and he would now give the
amendment his support He had notnsen to enter
into any d scussion He had remained silent du-
ring this proti acted debate, on a subject m which all
must know he could but feel a lively interest His
sole desn" wis, tint sucha direction might be given
to this matter, as to allay the excitement that per-
vaded the coantry, and put a stop to the further
progrfss of the spirit of abolition If tne Senator
from Kentucky will further modify his amend-
ment, so as to include the Territories, setting forth
in explicit terms, tint, to abolish slavery in them,
would be unjust to the inhabitants, calculated to
excite just apprehensions of theslaveholding States,
and dangerous to their domestic institutions, he
believed it would do much to quiet the public
mind, and he hoped, with thismodification, the hono-
rable Senator from South Carolina would consent
to accept it.
Mr CLAY l> en modified resolution, so a-  to
meet the viewsJsuggested by Mr Kiisc
Mr SEVIER asked the Senate to add the words,
uani a'so against the treaty stipulation with bpain of
22a February, 1819, which guaranties the right of
property "
Mr CLAY remarked that 1 e w as not awaie of
such a treaty stipulat on, but if there was such, he
would cheerfully insert it
Mr CALHOUN said he could appeal to the
Senate, that he had shown throughout this discus-
sion a liberal spirit of concession, and a perfect
readiness to make any modification of theseresolu-
tions that did not sacrifice the principles on which
they w ere based Farther he could not go, and he
had hoped that none of the friends of those princi-
ples, who had thus far supported him, would ask
him to go farther, and it was with profound regret
that he had heard the remarks of Ihe Senator fiom
Alabama, (Mr Kim, ) He would tell him, to
vote for this amendment to strike out the fifth reso-
lution, and substitute what the Senator fiom Ken
tucky (Mr Cr ay) proposes, even as now modified,
would be an utter abandonment of the entire
ground assumed in the resolutions already adopted
The great and governing pr neiples which p rva'ie
all these resolutions are non interference on the
part of any of the States or their citizens with the
institutions of the other States and the nondiscri-
mination on the part of this Government (the com-
mon agent of the States) m reference to the insti-
tutions of the several States—principles that he at
the foundation of our political system—principles
which cannot be departed from without bringing
the whole superstructure to the ground—principles
which place slavery in this District, or wherever it
may exist in the Territories undei the same broad
shield that protects it m the States To attack it
in one State would be to atfuk it in all, and in like
manner, and for the s->me íeason to attack it nere,
or m the Territories, is to attack it m the S'atxs
and this the fifth resol Uion, now proposed to be
stricken out, directly affirms He regarded siavery,
wherever it exists throughout the whole Southern
section, as one common question, and is as much
under the protection of the Constitution here, and
in the Territories, as m the States themselves, and
herein lies our only safety Abandon this, and all
is abandoned
He would tall the so ithern Senators if these
great principles be abandoned, theirs will be the-
responsibility If they yield, it even a small por-
tion, one or two, y eld in the slaveholdmg States, the
member  from the non slaveholdmg States must
yield They cannot do otherwise You force
them to do it How can tnev stand up when you
abandon your position'' How can they defend
themselves at home, when told that even southern
members hid surrendered the ground' Let not the
fallacious hope of drawing m votes, of uniting all,
induce a «¡unender of the strong and impregnable
position we occupy There is no hope but in meet-
ing the danger, and it i* bettei to stand alone wilh-
out a vo*e beyond the slaveholdmg S'ates, tnan to
surrenderan inch of gnuod Bui such will not be
the altérname li we stand fast, all wno agree
with us from every quarte-, all w ho hold to our po-
litical creed, will ultimately rally around our prm
ciples and the Constitution, but, on the contrary if
we surrender our ground, in order to bring m the
timid and those of an opposite creed, we will lo e
all The timid will become more timil, and those
of a different noluical faith, m spite of all the i oi -
cessions 5 ou may mal e, will, in the houi of tn 1
be found m the opposite rani s, and t ius pr vi« cs
and supporters, -dl wi'l be lost Be it r membeieo, I
be it held fa°t in on recol e tm, tnat the fi ih
resolution has bien s , ro'fi t as o phi a <n
as to make it accent 1 he b heved he m sh  a ,
to nearly all, and that if it be s'ruck out, it could
not but be considered as an abandonment of the
pnnciples which pervade these resolutions, and an
adoption of those con'amed in the amendment as
far as this Distr "t -nd the Territories were con-
cerned
He ought m t pei aps to be surprised that Se-
nators should differ sow de'j fnm him on this sub-
ject They did not view the d'sease as he did
He saw working a,t the bottom of these movements
the sims spirit which til o centuries ago convulsed
the Christian world, and deluged it m blood, that
fierce and cruel spirit of persecution whtch ori-
ginated m assumed superiority .and mistaken prin-
ciples of duty, that made one man beljeve that h*
was accountable for -the sms of, another^ a,nd that
he was thejadge of what belonged to W temporal
and eternal welfare, and was bpund, at4h? peni of
his own soul, to intenere to rescue him from perdi-
tion    Against this fell and bloody spirit it was m
vain  to   interpose   this amendment    Something
higher, more sacred, appealing more deeply to the
heart and understanding, must be. offered, and let
him tell Southern Senators, that if they should sur
render the impregnable portion assumed in the ori-
ginal resolutions, and place their hope m mere in-
expediency, the lime will come when they will be-
wail their folly in sackcloth and ashes.    An inflex-
ible adherence to our principle  and our rights, and
a decided and emphatic tone, equally remote from
nolence or concession, only can save us    Tha de
luded agitators must be plainly told that it is no
concern of theirs what is the character of our insti-
tutions, and that they mast not be touched here, 01
m the Territories   or the States hv them.or the Go
veinmtnl  that tlwy «ere uiitVr ihe guardian pro-
teclion of the Constitution, and that we stood pre-
paied to repel all interference, or disconnection, be
the consequence what it might
It had pleased Providence, said Mr Caíroon,
to cast his lot in the slaveholdmg States Tjhere
were his hopes, and all that was near and dear to
him His first duty was to thenr, ^and he held
every other, even his obligations to this Govern-
ment and the Union, as sacred as he regarded
them, subordinate to their safety He knew he
would be assailed, both here and elsewhere, for
thi-5 avowal, but he had long been accustomed to
such assault-, Iheyhad no tenor for him It
would tike something much more formidable to
compel him to suppress hit sentiments, or drive
him fiom the performance of what he believed 10
be his duty, th in the pens of hired «cnhblers, 01
the denunciations of an organized press
Before he concluded his remarks, he would call
on the Southern Senators to bear in mmd that the
f rst battle is to be fought m this District and m the
Territories, and that, by carrying these point-., the
Aboiittonists hoped to carry them m the States
To yield here, or m the Terntories, is to givp
ground where the two lines come into confl.ct, to
give the first vie ory to the foe, with all the fatal
conseqnf nces which usually follow a defeat on the
first encounter With these reflections, he w ould
ask, he would make a solemn appeal to his asso-
ciates from ti e Somn which presented the more
ímpregnabe pos lion on these exposed points—the
high and lofty ground of non-mterfeience and non-
discrim nation assumed in. the fifth resolution, or
that of inexpediency in the amendment now pro
posed as a substitute'2 And he would ask, on what
motive of policy, or duty, would they surrender the
stronger and occupj the weaker—give up the Con-
stitution, and rely on expediency'
He saw (said Mr C ) m (he question before us
the fate of the South It was a higher than the
mere naked question of master and slave It in-
volved a great political institution, essential to the
peace and existence of one half of this Union A
mystenius Piovidelice had brought together two
races, from different portions of the globe, and
pi ceil them togethei in nearly equal numbers
in the Southern portion of this Union They were
there msepvabh united, bejond the possibility of
ppat ( n I xperience had shown that tne exist
n? relatim bttw'<n -then secured th pe.ace and
h p ness fi ooi'i Fach htl impuved the m-
f 1 nn/i'lv so much so, tint it ha 1 attained a
decree of civili/itu 11 nevei lefore attained by the
bUck race in any age or count)y Under no other
relation could they co-exist tegether To «Jestrey
it was to involve a whole region in slaughter, car
nage, and desolation, and, come what will,, we must
deferid and preserve it
This agitation ha  .produced one happy effect at
least it has compelled us to the South to look into
the nature and character of this great institution,
and to coirect many fahe impressions that even
we had entertained m relation to it    Many tu th«s
