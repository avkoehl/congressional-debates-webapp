applied, and collecting timber and other material. I have to report now that all the spaces between the ribs have been filled in, and in a few days hope to commence the planking.

The deck timbers are fast being gotten out and will soon be ready to go into position. I have succeeded in getting a large supply of pine timber for the work, and have made application to Commodore Ingraham for a supply of oak. I have also had prepared a complete specification of all the material I can possibly require and sent it in to Commodore Ingraham, who assures me that he is ready to do everything in his power to further the progress of the work.

I hope in my next to be able to report every part of the work in course of successful operation.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

FRANCIS D. LEE,

Captain, Engineers.

Brigadier General THOMAS JORDAN, Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: Since preparing my report I have received a reply to my communications to Commodore Ingraham, asking material to conduct the work on marine torpedo ram.

The following are my letters, with the commodore's reply:

CHARLESTON, November 8, 1862.

Captain D. N. INGRAHAM, C. S. Navy:

COMMODORE: In compliance with our conversation of yesterday I hereby submit an estimate of some of the material which will be required for the construction of marine torpedo ram, viz, 18,500 feet oak, sawed, 4 inches thick; 6,000 pounds oakum, 5,000 pounds 8-inch spikes, one-half inch thick; 5,100 pounds 10-inch spikes, one-half inch thick; 10,500 pounds three-quarter inch iron; 4 tons of coal.

The above estimate only embraces such material as cannot be otherwise procured by the ship-carpenter. Messrs. Cameron &amp; Co. have been instructed to hand in an estimate of all the material they will need for their portion of the work, which I will forward immediately upon receipt. You will confer a special favor and materially advance the progress of the work by obtaining for me out of the force under your control five good ship-carpenters. We have only three or four now in our employ, and they are far from sufficient to meet our requirements.

General Beauregard has ordered me to report as early as possible the means at my disposal for the prosecution of the work.

For this reason you will oblige me by answering my requisition as early as possible.

I have the honor to be, commodore, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

FRANCIS D. LEE,

Captain, Engineers.

CHARLESTON, November 8, 1862.
