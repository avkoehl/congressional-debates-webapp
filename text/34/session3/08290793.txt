THE CONGRESSIONAL GLQBE.
the said States, Virginia inclusive, according to their usual
respective proportion* in the general charge and expendi-
ture, and shall he faithfully and bona fule disposed of for
that purpose, and for no other use or purpose whatso-
ever.' 9
How has Virginia had her common share in
this common fund ? The State of Illinois received
from the Congress of the United States a grant
of IanU which has enabled her to make her great
Central railroad; and now, after making it, she
has a sufficient quantity of rhat land left to sell
for more money than would pay the whole debt
of Virginia.
And yet Virginia has gone on with no aid but
her own means, resorting to the taxation of her
citizensin making her ownimprovements. While
Illinois, which was once a county of Virginia,
has rapidly shingled her whole State with rail-
roads, not by her own means, but by grants of
these lands, which she obtained from the Con-
gress of the United States. Virginia planted her-
self here on her desire that these lands should be
hold sacred, and should go to defray the common
expenses of this Government, and thereby re-
duce the taxes of the country. Bur, sir, she has
found that all her efforts have been fruitless. It
is worse than idle that her people should be made
to groan wuh taxation and her public works
unfinished, while this land fund is diverted from
the purpose for which it was intended, and is
being daily and hourly appropriated by others.
So it is with the other old States.
But there is another reason, it seems to me,
which ought to be sufficient in itsolf, and which
has recently developed itself in our legislation.
During the present session grave charges have
gone abroad connected with the manner in which
these grants of land have been obtained, and the
whole Congress of the United States has been
resting under the odium. Sir, let us get rid of,
this corrupting influence, if it be such.
But how have these lands been appropriated?
How mui.h of them have been sold' How much
of the money arising from their sale has gone into
the public Treasury, and' has thereby relieved
to that extent the people of the whole country?
I have before me a table, which, though not.
strictly accurate, approximates accuracy. Here
it is:

IT Estimated.
Why, sir, instead of the whole of this land
going into the common Treasury to help to defray
the common expenses, not one third of it has
done so. One hundred and thirty-four millions
eight hundred and ninety thousand one hundred
and thirty acres have been sold, while much more
than double that number of agres have been given
away. Upwards of eightam millions of acres,
UP to the 30th of June last, were granted to rail-
roads, and since that time about fifteen millions
nwre, making about thirty-three millions of acres
e'vt" for railroad purposes'atone.
We all remember the rapidity with which these
railroad grants were pressed through at the last
session. We all know with what eagerness gen-
tlemen are now watching around tms Hall to ap-
propriate millions of acres more; and 1 call on
the committee, and from the committee 1 appeal
to the country, to take this subject into cunsider-
tion, and see that Representatives are in this body
who will secure to all sections and every State,
their due and proper proportion of those lands,
and thus carry out the intention of the grantors,
to wit, that the lands shall be disposed of for the
common benefit of all the States, Virginia inclu-
sive, and remove from th« coffers of the United
States this great source of legislative corruption.
I propose, in the first place, to equalize the gi ants
of these lands, by giving to the States that have
not received any grants of land, as many acres
as have been grunted to those States in which
they he, and then to divide the lands remaining
equally, according to the congressional repiesent-
ation of each, among ail the States of the Con-
federacy.
