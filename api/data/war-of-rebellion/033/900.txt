ON THE MARCH,

Two miles from Moro, July 1, 1863-7.20 p. m.

Major THOMAS L. SNEAD:

MAJOR: I finished crossing this evening at 5.30. Worked the men in water to their waists last night until 10; again this morning from daylight. Men much wearied; mules more so, they are without forage; not a grain to be had without pressing. Will be at Moro at 9 p. m. When shall I issue ammunition?

Respectfully,

M. M. PARSONS,

Brigadier-General.

Major THOMAS L. SNEAD,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Price's Division:

I have the honor, major, to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

D. McRAE,

Brigadier-General.

Shelby's brigade is about 10 miles from Helena; Greene's brigade about 17. Pickets, covering their entire front, are thrown well forward. Has General Price any orders to give relative to the position of these brigades?

I am, very respectfully,
