The VICE PRESIDENT. The impassion of
the Chair is that the uniform practice of the Sen-
ate has been to receive no communication fiom
foreigners, persons not citizens or subjects of the
United States., other than those that reach the body
through the State Department. Thathasbeen the
practice, as the Chair believes.

wlM'ic within the territorial limits of the United States and

tiihes, or the lojal poittons. of such tubes, now ret-iding in

nionfy known as the '• fndian eonntiy," as may be ueces-
saiy m owler to seeuie foi the Indians of Kansas who shaii
he removed to said Indian conntiv, under the provisions of
fceetion one of tins act, the title to the lands to which they
may be fo removed.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The question is on
the amendment reported by the committee.
The amendment was agreed to.
The bill was reported to the Senate as amended,
and the amendment was concutred in. The bill
was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading;
and was lead the thud tunc.
Mr. I^ESSENDEN. I should like to have some
explanation of the bill. I do not ihmk a bill of
this importance should pass through here without
anybody explaining it. 1 ask that itbeagain read.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The bill will beread,
as amended.
Mr. LANE, of Kansas. The bill cornea from
the Committee on Indian AffMrs.
The Secretary read the bill, as amended.
Mr. FESiSENDEN. Mr. President, I should
like to hear some explanation of the bill. It seems
to £o into an cxpiess provision about a matter
winch is not according to the policy of the Gov-
et nnT'tU as lately developed in reference to the In-
dians. I should like to know what arrangements
there aie now on the subject. This is certainly a
bill of vei y i^reat importunec#and will involve very
much expense. 1 would like to know something
about, it before it is allowed to pass.
Mr. LANE, of Kansas. Mr. President, 1 have
hcie a map of Kansas, showing our condition with
repaid to these Indian reservations. The Indian
re.serves are in the midst of our settlements. Law-
renee, the town where I live, is wiLhinfive miles
of an lndun reserve, on one side, within twelve
miles of an Indian reserve on another, and within
u mile on another.
The Indians themselves are anxious to be re-
moved. They have appointed committees, and
have opened a correspondence with the tribes
houth of us. There is, south of Kansas, an In-
dum territory of seventy-eight thousand square
miles, suincitnt to accommodateevery Indian cast
ot the ilocky mountains. All the treaties with the
Indians of that territory are void, by reason of
their netion in this rebellion. Congress has here-
tofore authorized the President of the United States
to declare those treaties void. The policy, as pre-
sented by the Committee on Indian Affairs, sec-
onded by the Secretaiy of the Interior and the
Commissioner of Indian Affairs, is to open up a
negotiation with tin: tubeb of Kansas and the tribes
of the Indian territory, and see if an arrangement
can he made for their removal. I know that the
Indians of Kansas are anxious to be removed. I
am satisfied, from conversations with P*,oss and
other head men of the tribes of the Indian terri-
tory , that treaties can be made with Fhem by which
room can be obtained for our Indians; and thus
Kansas will have an opportunity of growing as
othei States have. The Indians of Kansas are
placed in a pitiable condition at the piesent time.
They are suriounded by the whites pressing upon
them from all sides, destroying tin 10.
There is another feature m connection with this
subject. By improving the lands adjoining these
reserves we are increasing the price of them for
ourselves upon ourselves. They are to be pur-
chased by our sons, or our neighbors, the resi-
dents of Kansas; and I think it is unjust. As an
instance of bow they have raised, take the Dela-
ware reset vi, the latest of the reserves; and to-
day, haid as the times are, and dangerous as is
the condition of our country, I have no doubt their
lands, if put up for sale, would bring from four to
seven dollars an acre from our own people, every
dollar of which wo have made them by our im-
provements. Our people are dissatisfied with this
state of things.
There is another reason for this removal. Dur-
