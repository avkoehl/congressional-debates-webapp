of banks, either State 01 federal, m the keeping
and disbursement of the revenue1 Has not the
employment of banks, from the first, been a mani-
fest departure from the plain and obvious course
indicated by the constitution, and may not this de-
parture be justly regarded as the source of all our
financial embarrassments and difficulties i
But is the proposed system piacticable ?    This is,
perhaps, the most impoitant question connected
with the whole subject    Is there any thing m the
constitution, or m the nature of the fiscal duties of
the Government, that renders the agency of banks
appropriate and necessai y i   If that part of the Ex-
ecutive power which rela'es to the nuances cannot
be executed except by bank agency, then a sjstem
of banks becomes an essential part of the Goverr
nient itself, and enters into its very elements    It
becomes a bank Goverrment, and cannot exist inde
pendent of banks in some foi m    And if it is not
maintained that banks aie absolutely necessary as
fis tl agents, to insist that their agencv is the most
sui   hie and appiopnale meet is of executing a por
tion of the Executive power would spem to lead to
the -ame conclusion the same connexion bets eei
the Government and banks    But those who profess
to be opposed to a bank of the United States, will
do well to pause before they come to either of the
above conclusions    for if the operations of the
Government cannot be carried on without th e agency
of banks, or if banks are the most suitable and ap
propnate means for executing the pow ers relating
to the revenue, does n not follow that w c must hav e
a,fedeial bank9    Is it not apparent that to admit
that bank agency is necessary in the management
of the finances, is the stiongest possible argument
m suppoit of a national bank 1   Sir, the tw o ques
tions are identical, the} are but one, for to «ay that
a bank is necessary as a fiscal agent, is to say that
we mu«t have a national bank     This, sir, is a
complete independent system of Government   it
possesses \uthm itself all the necessarv functions of
a Government     It is in no particular dependan' on
the States, so fai  as its own action is c< nreined
and least of all can it be in so important a function
a  that of its finances     If it has not \\ ltmn itself the
power to manage its financps then it is no Govern
menl, it is dependant on the States almo-t to the
same extent as the old confederation w hich had no
power over a revenue but by requisitions upon the
States    H°s this Government any control over the
Sta'e bin, si   Has it anv right to command their
services'1   And, m   times of party  excitement,
might not many of the States ptohibit their banks
from acting as agents of the Government'   What
securrtj can there be m a reli ince on State m«titu
tions1    Who eontiol the banl     and  what i-then
spirit1   Do they not p escnt-thc embodied el< mems
of aristocracy   and have thev not usu ill) been op
posed to the Government when administered b)
agents possessing the confidence of the great bod)
of the people 9    Sir  there is no avoiding the con
elusion that lihmkagencv isnecessaiv   we must
have a federal bank, which we can eontiol cm
selves, or, at least, have a legal right to control    But
no such agency is necessarv     The proposed sv stem
is not only piacacable, but n" rural, simple, and
Mr N did not hesitate to 'av  would be tound on
trial, to be a° convenient a- the ^tatebank ma
chmery
Ifauthotit) is of any avail,Mi  N said hewoald
refer to that of Mr Gallatin whose gieatexpenence
and learning, as a financier, no one w ould dispute
He saj s, " it must be acknowledged that inasmuch
as the revenue ma) be collected   and the public
mone) may be kent in the public chests and trans
ferred to distant places w ithout the assistance of
banks, as all this has once been done m the TJni cd
States, and continues to be done m sev ei al coun
tries w ithout any public bank   it cannot h. assertpd
that those ms'itutions aie absolute!1  necessarv  for
those purposes if we take the word necessaiv  m
that strict sense which has leen allied to      He    :
thinks   however   it would be moie inromenient
and expensive
Wha , nen aie the ob¡ec ions to it' Several
have been urged which lie \ ould bneflj notice
It is said that i  w ill mocase tí e expense, and that
the public funds w iP be unsafe The question ot
expense was too unimpoiiant in his estimate to
be deserving of any stnous consideration, it the
expense shoaldbe double triple )i quadiuple what
it has been estimated at it w ould be a mattpi of no
moment with him As to the secun \ of the public
funds, he thought they would at least be as safe as
jb the banks    Can we not put as much confidence
in our own officers, appointed bv and accountable
to, this Government, subject to tne regulations, and
pains, and penalties, which may by law be pre-
scribed, as we can m the officers ol mere corpora-
tions, over whom we have no control, and who are
no way accountable to us for their conduct Wc
have no remedy, either civil or criminal, against
anj officer of a State bank for embezzling onr funds,
our only remedy is against the corpoiation, and
that by suit, like any other creditor But 'he pow er
of supervision and removal, which will be appli-
cable to officers of oui own, and a frequent exam
mation ol the state of their funds and accounts, as
provided for in this bill, is a source oí great secu
rity But it is said il we entrust oui funds in
banks, we have the capital of the institution as a
reliance to make good any defalcation But if our
moneys were embezzled or w asted by the officers of
a bank, the same fraudulent conduct w ould waste the
capital also How many banks m the Union have
experienced such a catastrophe I There is one
eircumstatce greatly m favor of the proposed
scheme as regards secunty The federal officers
are to be the mere keepers oí the public mone) they
are not to use it, whereas, the banks are expressly
authorized to use your funds, ar d do u=e them, as
a part of their capital, and, of course, they are
subjected to all the hazards and contingencies at
tending the banking business Theie is another
important point of difference theie are general
causes which operate upon all banks at the same
time, and which may prostrate the whole at once,
to the mo t serious embarrassment of the Govern-
ment This is precisely our present condition
But there are no such causes whu h can opetate on
federal officers, an individual may prove faithless
or fraudulent, but that cannot seriously affect the
public interest
It is fuither objected, that the proposed plan w ill
withdraw the public funds irom use, this is true
But who have arighttouse the public mone}s foi
then own benefit'' Their use herctofoie hasbeen
almost exclus v ol> confined to one e'ass, the u ei
chants, who have had a monopol) of the punlege,
if l1 is one the pnvilege is also confined to the
places where the ícvenue is collected Is this just 1
The onlj sound principle is that the public funds,
w hich belong to the w hole people, shall not be used
by any one, but kept sacred until wanted to pa) the
public creditois, and the expenses oí the Govern-
ment
Is it not the fact that the merchants have been
doing business on the funds of the Government,
that has occasioned most of the clamor and excite-
ment which has existed in the commercial commu
nil) m legard to almos* ever) financial measuie
which the ccndition ot the country or it- revenue
have required ' Is it not time this c ause of dis'urb-
ances was lemovedl But, sir we are g^aveh lold
bv the honoiable Senator fiom Virginia that the
bill w ith the amendmen*, w Inch prov ides prospec t
ivelv tor collecting and disbutsing the revenue m
specie, will introduce two kinds of currencies—one
for the Government its officers contiactois, and so
foi 'h, and one for the people He was sorry to see
such an objection which he would not saj was taken
fiom the newspapets of the dav put foith from such
a quaitpr Whv the Senator himself seems to be
sensible that it w ill be regarded as an ad captandum
argument )et, in the same breath, he informs us
that he discovers m it the germs of an anstoerac}
The officers of the Government were to have a
bettei euirencv " but rags were good enough for
the people But this curienc) of the pnvileged
oulei is no better than the public oficeis aro en-
titled to bv law, it is no "bettei" than we ha'e
nm ed to pa-) them no ' belter' th&n justice enti
ties them to To pay the public ci editors m any
thing bn* the lawful currencj 01 what is equiva-
lí At thereto is to defraud them, and this was the
fiist nine he had heard it urged that democracj
consisted in cheating the public acdiioi <; This ar
gument was hard]) deserving of a «■enous refuta-
tion1, it was better adapted to the newspapers of the
day than to the Senate The simple fact is, there
never has leen and never can be, but one curren
cv so far as this Government is concerned, which
is the law ful currencj of the United States 01 vv hat,
foi the time is deemed equivalent theieto How
would the Senator remedy the supposed evil"i
Would he requtrp the revenues to be collected and
paid m the paper issues of broken banks 1 And of
which banks'! How will he distinguish between
those which have only su-pended payment, and
those w hich are really insolvent'   But bank notes
aie not the onlj paper currencj which the people
use, theie aie small notes, bill , and shinplasters
issued by all sorts of corporations, and even by
boot blacks and chimney sweeps Would the gen-
tleman have the Government receive and pay out
these shinplasters, so as to bring about the equality
between the people and the Government 1 This
Government has no control over these spurious
paper issues, whether fromeoiporations or individ-
uals , it did not authorize them, and it cannot sup-
press them If the people suffer themselves to oe
defiauded, is that a reason why the Government
should be defrauded also1 Or is it a reason why
the Government should encourage these frauds-
upon otheis, and upon the whole community i
But the Senator furthei informs us that the pro-
posed plan, which he insists should be called a sub-
treasuiy scheme, w ill open the flood gates to Exec-
utive influence and thi= seems to be his strong po
sition If this was true in iiomt of fact it would
be an objection possessing great force But to sus-
tain it, the gentleman draw s largely upon his im-
agination He looks beyond the present bill,
which, he sajs is onl) tne germ of the system,
which, when fully developed, will produce fifty
thousand ofhceis like the establishment of the Re-
ceivers General m F anee As this objection rest-
ed mainly on extraordinar} flights of imagina-
tion, andas he (Mr N ) had no capacity for such
flights, he could not, perhaps, perceiv e its truth
He w as willing to admit that it might hereafter be
found necessary to enlarge samew hat on the plan
as now proposed and, at three 01 four points, to add
some few additiona1 officeis to be specially chat ged
with the keeping and disbursement of the public
monejs New York, Philadelphia, Boston, and
New Orleans, he thought were the only places
where any such additional officers could be i equired,
but as tne mint and branch mints are to be places oí
deposite, it was quite uncertain whethei any re-
cen ers or new treasury officers w ould be required
But as to the armv of fifty thousand the) will never
have anv existence, except in the warm and feitile-
imag nation of the Senaloi who has so stiong
faith m his own foreboding, that, even now, he can
see in a gram of mustard seed t^the smallest of all
seeds) springing into life, a large plant, spreading
broacl its blanches, whilst the birds of prey are seem
lighting upon them, ready to devour the substance
of the people But when w e descend from these
airj flights, and look at this subject as if is, w^eshall
find that this aimy of fiftv thousand «ifieets dwin-
dles downtoafew clerks for, as thebill now stand" ,
it does not provide for the appointment of any other
officers And should u be lound necessarv to en-
laige the system, as ho had supposed it possiblv
might heieafter the increase of pattonage to the>
Execufiv e can amount to no moie than the appoint-
ment of some fifteen or tw enty additional officers.
These officers can have no extiaoidmary influence
from having the keepirg of the public funds, as
they will not be peimitted to use ihem m an any
way or manner whattvci He was aw aie thst it
as elsewhcie, if not here, chai ged upon thissjs-
tem, that it placed the w hole public treasuie in the
hands and under the eontiol of the Executive
But even one knows th-jt this is enlnely incorrect,
that the President 01 the Secretarv of the Trea«u-
lv, can have no more actual eontiol over the funds
on the proposed plan than the) now have The
President can have no direct control m either case,
and the Secretary cannot draw a dollai from the
Treasui) e\cept in pursuance of appropriations
made h) law
But sn, I w i«h to call attention to the great po nt
of distinction between the proposed plan and the
deposite bank scheme It is this—that the formei
is cntnely fiee from am moneyed influence That
is the onlv influence which we have to fear, that
is the subtle poison which is to corrupt the very
foun'ams of our liberties that is the secret ene-
mv which like the worm that nevei dies is knaw-
mg upon the veiy vitals of our free institutions.
In the one plan the public funds are not to be loan-
ed or used, the), therefore can neither benefit any
one nor corrupt anyone, but m the other case, the
public funds aie to be loaned through the agency
of banks But this is not all noi the worst The
deposite bank system as established by the act of
1836 is subject to the most weighty and alarming
objections Those provisions of the bill were not
sufficiently considered they passed without discus-
sion , the attention of all being engrossed by the?
sections of the bill relating to a deposite of the svu*
plus with the States,
