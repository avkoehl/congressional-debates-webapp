HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND, Nashville, February 27, 1865-8 p.m.

Lieutenant General U. S. GRANT,City Point, Va.:

Your telegram of 11 a.m. to-day is received. I am sorry that the expedition under General Stoneman could not get off sooner than this, but he has not had time to prepare fully since I received your instructions. I will direct him to throw his forces into Southwestern Virginia, as you direct; and, in anticipation of probable operations in East Tennessee this spring, have already thrown into Knoxville over 2,000,000 rations, and have given orders to have the store-houses filled to their full capacity. Orders were also given, some weeks since, to accumulate forage at Knoxville, which order is now being complied with by the quartermaster's department. Unless you wish otherwise, I shall send General Stanley's entire corps to East Tennessee, as soon as a sufficient number of new regiments report to enable me to withdraw it from Huntsville, Ala. I shall also concentrate the surplus of new regiments at Chattanooga, as the most available point from which to re-enforce the troops in East Tennessee, if necessary.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General, U. S. Army, Commanding.
