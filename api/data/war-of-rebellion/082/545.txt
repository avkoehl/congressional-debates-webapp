Brigadier-General WEITZEL,

Chief of Staff, Dept. of Virginia and North Carolina:

General Hancock has his line perpendicular to the New Market and Malvern Hill road, pushing up the road, his right resting on what he thinks is the New Market road. He appears to have turned the enemy's works on their left. The enemy are falling back toward Chaffin's Bluff. I am pushing my line near the Ruffin house and shall try and drive the enemy into their entrenchments, taking good care of my lines.
