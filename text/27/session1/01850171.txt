note is discounted, the utmobt publicity would be
of no disadvantage Honesty has nothing to fear
from light, it is iraud whicn wants a hiding place
The man who lives upon fictitious credit, who
enjoys heavy accommodations tor purposes of spe-
culation, can maintain his credit only under the
cover ot concealment To him the secrecy of the
bank parlor is tas real capital—remove that and
his occupation is gone
The remarks, which he had made, Mr N said,
applied more particularly to ihe proposiuon
to give publicity to the discounts and loans of the
Bank They were applicable, however, to the
proposition now pending to publish the orders is-
sued from time, to time by the board of managers
to the branches Tnr  board is to niaiidge and
conirol the operation-, of all the branches—to dic-
tate their policy—to , we ordei tor expcnd nsj and
contracting the tune of discounts We des re that
these orders shall be made public as soon as they
pre issued Ever/01 i--101 expau mi or eontiac
tioa mu t affect the interest ot every i ji in the
country Hence, every man haa an in i irst in
having (he eanitst information of any chan,. in
the policy if the Bank, to e able him to auoraiio
date his own business to the change This infor-
mation, so áesaable to all business men, ought not
to be confined to the favored few who enjoy ed the
privilege of knowing the Bank secrets
But, said Mr N the full importance of .his pro-
position can only be comprehendeu by taking a
vie «of the extraordinary powers wi h which this
boaid of managers are to be invested The advo
cates of ihe bill maintain that the Bank will have
the power to ",urnr-h a sound ana un form curren-
cy for the people This power, watch belongs only
to sovereignty, is to be del-gated to the beard of
nine It, by "unitorm currency," gentlemen mean
a currency which will circu a'e at par in every po-
tion of the country, he would admit that ? great
benefit would be secured by such a curre cy Bat
this was merely "«ticking in the bark"—the ev 1 ot
the curtency was that it lacxed uniformity in
quantity, or, m other \ ords, stability 1t the uncu-
letting medium was ihe grea' desidei atw n If the
cunency can be made to a^pioximate to stability
varying only according tithe ie<; ticiate mies of
trale, uniformity in value become^ a necessary
comequence. But (said Mr N ) t is sovereign
power of famishing a uniform currency foi the
people is to be entrusted to a stlect board of
nine, and this board is to execate the power
through order? issued through the Branch Ought
the.e orders to be secret edicts' This ooard was
also to regulate the State banks, the ex^hangeí,
commerce, and, in fact, to assess the value cf the
whole property and labor of the Union. By their
orders they are to check the discounts of State
banks or to authorix  them to expand, and yet the
order wmch is to operate upon the Stale banks is
to be kept secret even from those banks E/ery
order issuing from this board will have all the force
and sanction rf law Under the charter and by
laws ot the Bank, this board are constituted a
commercial and monetary legislation for the
Union Its laws are to operate directly upon
the value of the currency, its quantity, and the
value ot property and labot, and yet those laws
are to be enacted in secret, and to be di closed to
none but those initiated m the Bank secrets' Undjr
this system of secret Bank legislation andseciet
communications to the branches,the existence oí new
laws can only be known from the effects which are
produced. The causes lor their adoption or the
purposes to be effected ?re cartful!/ concealed
within the bosoms of the Bank managers
Mi N. «aid that the powers conferred u on this
board of Bank managers were sovereign powers
greater than s]'ho*e possessed by the G neral Go-
vernment Ño Senator would vo e directly to au-
thorize any one man m the Union to sit ir judg-
ment upon the value of propeny and labor, to fix
that value from day to day according to their dis-
cretion, much less wsuld a ly Senator sanction an
outrageous proposition, it th° power was to bo ex-
ercised and executed in secret Ytt Congress
was about to confer such powers indirectly, if the
Bank possesses the attribute* which are claimed
for ¡t by its friends    It were far better, said Mr.
N that this Government should exeicrse its legi- ]
tímate furctions with closed di ora, and cease to
pu'dith to the world the resal s of its dthbetatwns,
than tint such unlimited p wers snould be delegat-
ed to the Bank to be exercised without responsi-
bility, and in the stcret courts of the Bank parlor1
Mr N said it should be borne in mind that to give
full effect to the extraordinary powers of the Bank,
it wa<= to be owned at least m the proportion of one-
third by the people, and the public moneys were to
be committed to its  custi dy and use With such
an interest in the institution, he maintained that the
people had a right to the fullest information as to
its policy
But ihere was anoiher point of view, (said Mr
N ) in which the impoitance of the proposition be
casue still nore apparent     Tiu  fact was not to be
disguised or conccal-d, that ih s Bank was to be a
parti/ machine—it  vas enphaticaliy, as  us  name
imports, a Treasury Bunk '    He remembered that
Mr. McDufTie, some years since, had made a report
in which he had argued   the  cons'itu íonality <t a
Bank  and presented its  advantages  wi h a degree
ofabili v not surpassed, if ever equalled by any other
mau     if he was not mistaken, Mr McDufhe con-
eluded ihatrep >rt with the sentiment, that if sucha
Bank should  ever become a party machine, its
powers and dangers would h  so great that all its
advantages would be  outweighed     In 1837, the
same gentleman had avowed himself opposed to a
United States Bank   upon   the   distinct   greund
that    under    existing    circumstances   such   an
institution   would   become    necessarily   a   po
litical     machine      Mr     N     «aid,    it     would
be madn^s m  any man now to doubt the tiuth of
this remark of Mr. McDuffie    Tht  Bank cannot
exist a day except as a  political  institution     Its
friend  cla m ¡S establishmtt t as the result ol toe
late paity  mump-1'    If parsed it must be p «¡ed
exclusively b/ « paiiy vole' Its stock will be taken
by none but the members of one part)'    But when
we turn to the organisation of the Bank, and see
it located in this Di ¡net, amidst politicians and in
full view of the Executive— vnen \vp see one third
of its maiMgers the cieatures of Executive will,
and the whole  Bond the actué pamzans of the
paity which has treated it, «e ennot doubt what
will be toe resl character of the ¡"stitrmor'
Now, said Mr. IN can aiy reason be gnen why
t e Ir^nsic ions o( ,uch ai ínsLUmoi), the right
arm ot EwsUtive pot er, uhoj'd be concealed from
tic country Who can begin to fathom the power 
of a President with awe wil'ing subservient parti
zansas aBjardof Control for'his Bank' Allow
th s clique to conco t their measures in secret, to
issue them secretly, to execute them secretly, an 1
the Executive power s irresistible
Mr N said, that believing as fee did that honesty
wished no concealment butdeligh'ed in open and
fair dealing, he had therefore voted for every pro
position lo give publicly to the procee'mgs of the
Bank, and upon the same pnnciple he should vote
for the present amendment.
Mr BENTON rose to give his assent to thi , as
he would to all prono itions o the kind tending to
bnig light into the Bank pattor Publicity was a
great question, and was i laning prugrest, He re
iurred to the rejection oí the pr iof 4iioit to make
th- Senate's proceedings publ c in 1791, wnen on-
ly seven men could be found to vote lor it
He alluledto the secret ] urnal of the conven-
tion, which was only punlishel in 1819, affei re-
peated eff rts, and he asked who would think of
holding a secret conventio i o make laws or acon-
s i utionfor tns comí r> no"?

phan by the operations carried on under the
veil of bank parlor secrecy, than undei any
other veil of darkness evet yet employed   as   a
pall to cover crime. He would go more at
large into this ¡some other time—weuld investi-
gate the bank parlor doings, from the splendid
chambers of the United States Bank palace to the lit-
tle shanty in which the washerwomen were cheated
by shinplasters. Secrecy was at the bottom of all
tins evils that ever flowed from contractions and
expansions Had the veil been torn away, they
never could have happened. This great straggle
for publicity will be rewarded by the approbation
and thanks of millions. Every man, every wo-
man, every child in the community will invoke
blessi igs on them. Those who support the princi-
ple of -ecrecy, will have to consider themselves as
a doomed sect. It only reeds to be explained to
tne people to insure the exclusion of that sect from
the legislative halls of the country—and the people
shall have it explained to them. This Bank is to
follow ihe old plan to secrecy—every shilling ex-
tracted from the people to make up its capital, and
to keep it supplrd with Government funds to loan
oat to its partners, will be employed in producing
expan ions and contractions to make fortunes for
the f>iends and directors of the great Fisc A.nd

in the minority, but never, during the last twenty
lears, did he feel so triumphant, so victorious, as
he felt at the battle of this extra session. He said he
would not go at large into these matters. He rose to
back his friends, not by backing out as did Sir John
Falstaff's friends, bat by voting and standing with

of him who is orthodox on Democracy, and whose
name grows brighter, and bnghter,aad will continue

M- Jefferson tells what he had learned from his
friend Brown     He says
' 'Mr Brow t telle me lie has it from a merchant here that

Th's reminded Mr B of Voltaire, writing from
Fernay, two hundred miles from Paris, in his own
beautiful and simple language
' I have a inend in Pans who writes to me when there is a
Bark contiaction I thtn buy in stocks and he wutes when
thete i an t \[ tmion then I sell out, and thus I make a for
tune sitting m my t hau
Now, sir, said Mr. B. that which Volt&ire did
fm himself I want to do for the people of this
Union, by 'his amendment 1 want them to have
a fuel)d to tell them when to buy and when to
sell, but to simplify the operation and reach every
man, I wait it to be published in the gazettes of
the countrj I wmt the world to know when this
great Pise is going to change the prices of labor
and every thing else, that all may be prepar-
ed, &o
Mr   W4LKER showed, from  official docu-
ments  furnished by the Bank itself,  the expan-
sions and  contiactions of that ms'ttution for a se-
ries of year'    F'om 1817 to 1318, the expansions
weie S38 000,000, from 1818 to 1819, the contrac-
tions were s,(j 000 000, from 1819 to 1820, thecon-
tracions were $4 000,000, from 1820 to 1821,  the
contractions were §1,000,000, iroml821 to 1822,
&2 000 000, thus contracting to the amount of #13,-

again,  anl from 1822 to  1823, Ihe   expansions
were %2 Ü00 000, from 1823 to 1824, #3,000,000,

the important fact that the year before the  Bank
apolied fo' a recharter, she had extended her loans
and discounts from forty-four mdltons to sixty-six
million  ot dollars, in order to put the country in
■k general slate cf mdebtednes , so that the refusal
to recharter woull indict the greatest amount of
suffering on the community.   This was an extra-
ordinary document, showiag how fluctuating and
uGsullied was the standard of value established by
the late Bank of the Uni'ed States   Instead of being
a correct standard  it was   shown   that   it   had
increased in amount 5u per cent m a single year.
