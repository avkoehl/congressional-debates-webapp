Colonel CHRISTENSEN:

I have just arrived and without any accident. I met three of our steamers on their way up. It is too dark nd windy to do much with boats to-night. Matters are somewhat confused by my being absent to-cay, but I will put all in shape soon. It will be impossible to send the 100-pounder Parrott belonging to the navy aboard before morning.

Respectfully,J. BAILEY,

Brigadier-General.
