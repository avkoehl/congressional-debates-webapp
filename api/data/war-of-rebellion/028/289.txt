September 14, 1862 (Sent 1.30 p. m.)

Major-General McCLELLAN:

Yours of 11.15 is just received. Scouts report a large force still on Virginia side of the Potomac, near Leesburg. If so, I fear you are exposing your left flank, and that the enemy can cross in your rear. Can you not ascertain the fact from Sugar Loaf Mountain? Hearing that you had withdrawn all troops from the river below Conrad's Ferry, I directed General Banks to supply their place. I do not understand what you mean by asking me to look out for Chambersburg. I have no troops to send there.

General HALLECK,

General-in-Chief, U. S. Army:

We are firing the passes of the Blue Ridge. Have possession of the heights on the left of Hagerstown pike; are now attacking the right. Franklin is attacking the Rockville [Crampton's] Pass, through the same ranges. Thus far all goes well. have taken about 100 prisoners. I have the troops in hand. They are confident, and hope to have full possession of the passes by dark.

(Received 1 1. m., 15th)

Major-General HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

After a very severe engagement, the corps of Hooker and Reno have carried the heights commanding the Hagerstown road. The troops behaved magnificently. They never fought better. Franklin has been hotly engaged on the extreme left. I do not yet know the result, except that the firing indicated progress on his part. The action continued until after dark, and terminated leaving us in possession of the entire crest. It has been a glorious victory. I cannot yet tell whether the enemy will retreat during the night or appear in increased force in the morning. I am hurrying up everything from the rear, to be prepared for any eventuality. I regret to add that the gallant and able General Reno is killed.
