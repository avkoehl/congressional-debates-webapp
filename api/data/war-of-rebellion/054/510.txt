were still on the west side of the railroad and in an open field to the north of the wood. I therefore concluded to work my way as quietly as possible to the edge of the wood next to the railroad, and then make a dash upon their flank. Accordingly, after throwing Captain Nance's company on my left, deployed as skirmishers, to report any movement of the enemy and to guard against any flank attack from that direction, I moved out of the woods unperceived by the enemy, and simultaneously opened fire and charged on their right flank. They immediately broke and retired beyond the hill on which they were posted, but just before we reached the railroad I discovered for the first time a considerable body of troops, who were unmasked by our passing from behind a thicket of small pines, posted on the railroad and about 500 yards to our left, some of whom were mounted and others dismounted.

Under these circumstances I halted at the railroad, where I found protection for my men behind the embankment, and engaged the enemy, who changed front and returned my fire from behind the brow of the hill, intending to act as circumstances might dictate. Just beyond the railroad was an open meadow, which it was unadvisable to enter while the enemy's cavalry was on my flank. There was no sign of an advance of our line of skirmishers (whose left rested on the railroad on the railroad) to connect with my right.

Captain Nance reported a large body of cavalry passing around my left and to my rear, toward the woods from which I had just emerged, and a fire at the same time being opened on my left from up the railroad, I determined, upon consultation with my field officers, to retire by the same route by which I approached. I did so, and some time after having reached the woods I received an order from General Kershaw, through Lieutenant Dwight, assistant inspector-general, to rejoin the brigade on the Loudon road. I did so immediately. Not knowing the exact purpose of my orders, I cannot say how far the design was executed, but if not fully carried out it was as much so as circumstances would allow.

A list* of casualties in this affair is herewith submitted. Among the wounded was Lieutenant Wade Allen, who was struck while bearing a message from me to Captain Nance. I regret to state that he fell into the hands of the enemy when we retired from Knoxville.

On the morning of the 18th, by order, I took my position in line of battle, and after marching near to Mr. Armstrong's house I was halted in a ravine to the left of the road, where I remained until late in the afternoon. During the whole day there was heavy skirmishing in front and considerable cannonading from our batteries, the effort being to carry a high hill on the left of the road and just to the south of Mr. M. M. Armstrong's house.

I received an order about 4 p. m. from General Kershaw, through Lieutenant Doby, aide-de-camp, to carry the enemy's rail defense situated on this hill, but not to advance beyond them. I was told that the line of these works was indicated by two cedar trees on the top of the hill, and I directed my men not to stop short of these trees, but not to go beyond them. We then advanced in excellent condition under heavy fire until we reached the cedars, but perceiving that the trees were short of the works, I urged my men forward by every means in my power, but perhaps because of the general direction "not to go beyond the cedars," and on account of having once halted, and the difficulty of renewing the advance under such
