three-quarters of a mile from the Chickahominy, about one mile and a half from the heights opposite this point, and on the road from New Bridge still remains the camp noticed in my first ascent, some days since, apparently without any increase. Directly south of this point, about five miles, is a tolerable-sized camp smoke, and I should judge three miles and a half in advance of the main camp of General Keyes.

The city of Richmond was entirely enveloped in smoke. The balloon at Mechanicsville was also up at the same time with me. I will make an ascent from Mechanicsville as soon as the atmosphere clears.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

T. S. C. LOWE,

Chief Aeronaut.

The three following reports were made after the battle of Fair Oaks:

Brigadier General A. A. HUMPHREYS:

GENERAL: I have just completed another observation from the balloon. About three-quarters of a mile from the heights opposite here, and about two miles and a half from this point, are about six regiments of infantry. Trees have been felled beyond them, so that I can now see another small field beyond where trees were standing this morning. There is heavy smoke now rising, as though underbrush were burning. I will watch their operations and report.

T. S. C. LOWE.

7.15 A. M.

Brigadier-General HUMPHREYS, or

General R. B. MARCY,

Chief of Staff:

The enemy remain the same opposite this point. I can see through a small open space in the woods, on what I think is the Williamsburg, road, troops moving toward the late scene of action, but not in great numbers, however.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

T. S. C. LOWE.

8.15 A. M.

Brigadier-General HUMPHREYS, or

General R. B. MARCY,

Chief of Staff:

The atmosphere is now quite clear. The troops still remain quiet opposite here. On the heights opposite General Smith's headquarters and on the left-land side of the New Bridge road, going to Richmond, the enemy are throwing up earth. Many army wagons are remaining stationary in that direction and horses grazing.

Respectfully,

T. S. C. LOWE,

Chief Aeronaut.

CAMP NEAR DOCTOR GAINES" HOUSE,

June 3, 1862-5 a.m.

Brigadier-General HUMPHREYS:

I ascended this morning at an altitude of 900 feet just before 5 o"clock, but found the atmosphere so thick with mingled smoke and fog that only a few places were visible. The enemy opposite this point remain the same as yesterday, and along the heights for two miles up nothing is moving on the roads.

Chief Aeronaut, Army of the Potomac.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,June 7, 1862.

Professor LOWE:

You will please allow Mr. Babcock to make ascensions in your balloon whenever it is convenient. He is making maps and desires to make observation.

R. B. MARCY,

Chief of Staff.
