HEADQUARTERS FIRST CAVALRY DIVISION,Gower's, September 8, 1863-8 a.m.

Major-General WHEELER:

GENERAL: I have arrived here with one of my brigades and six pieces of artillery; the other brigade will be up by 12 m. Please let me know what is going on in front. I am instructed by General Bragg to impede their advance on Rome as much as possible. If I hear nothing of the enemy to-day I shall cross the mountains and get in their front. What is the chance for forage along where you are? If you are telegraphing to General Bragg to-day let him know where I am. If the enemy does not advance we must move on them.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

N. B. FORREST,

Brigadier-General

General S. COOPER:

The order I communicated to General Jones for abandoning Cumberland Gap was from General Bragg. My own judgment has been to hold it and I had so instructed. It is supplied for nearly two months.

Major General S. B. BUCKNER, Chattanooga:

Acting under authority of the Secretary of War, I have not ordered

the evacuation of Cumberland Gap, and I shall not unless I see necessity for it. Keep me informed of the condition of things with you.

SAM. JONES,

Major-General.

ABINGDON, September 8, 1863.

Honorable JAMES A. SEDDON, Secretary of War, Richmond:

Labor is needed to construct defensive works at Saltville. Governor Letcher says he can give me no authority to impress slaves because you have called out all available slave-labor for public defense. May the slaves called out in this and the adjoining counties be employed on works at Saltville?

SAM. JONES,

Major-General.
