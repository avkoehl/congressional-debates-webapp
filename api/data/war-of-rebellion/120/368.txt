INDIANAPOLIS, IND., June 13, 1864.

Honorable EDWIN M. STANTION, Secretary of War:

My present opinion is that a military arrest and trial would be impolitic and provoke trouble in Ohio, Kentucky, a d Indiana. If they are amenable to a civil prosecution it would be well received and sustained. I will think further of it and write you. At present I would not move by the military power.

CINCINNATI, June 13, 1864.

General H. W. HALLECK, Chief of Staff:

The officers and men of the One hundred and seventy- first and One hundred and sixty- eight Ohio national Guard that were captured on the 11th of June at and near Cynthiana, have arrived in this city, and I have sent them to Camp Dennison. They have been paroled, but so far as I can learn, in an unauthorized manner. So soon as I can get a report it will be forwarded. General Hobson and the field officers are at Falmouth, Ky., on some conditional parole, the terms of which I have not learned. *
