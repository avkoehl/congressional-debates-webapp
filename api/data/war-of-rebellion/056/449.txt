The mills are in the neighborhood of New Market, 8 miles from Strawberry Plains. Six hundred of the First East Tennessee Mounted Infantry are occupying Dandridge.

MEMPHIS, December 19, 1863.

Major-General GRANT,

Chattanooga:

Dispatch of 11th received to-day. Steele has asked for no troops, and I think does not need any. Price is on Red River, much reduced. Recruiting going on vigorously in Arkansas. Forrest is at Jackson; forces estimated about 4,000. Grierson moves to-morrow on Purdy and Bolivar, and Smith from Columbus on Monday. Forrest must fight or run. Roads dreadful from rain. I think we shall cure Forrest of his ambition to command West Tennessee.

Major-General.

Order Mizner to be ready to move out from Corinth as soon as infantry comes up.
