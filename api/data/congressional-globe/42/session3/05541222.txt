THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
February 10,
no trust in the Government to pay insurers,
and vvlutre tlie counsel comply with their in-
structions, and an award iu gross is made for
a national injury without any minute exam-
ination of detail, there is no trust between the
Government and the insurers. Sir, if you
exclude this claim of the United States for
tfye general injury done our people, you have
an award for more money than is due us, and
you must either pay these several claimants, in-
eluding the insurance companies, that made
a profit and those that did not thirty or forty
per cent, more than would indemnify them, or
you must send back to Great Britain four or
live million dollars. The existence of an award
ir.ore thao sufficient to pay the individual claims
sljows that the arbitrators did consider that
which was urged before them, to wit, the claim
foe the loss of national wealth.
. It is said that Mr. Webster, in reference to
the French spoliation claims, maintained that
the insurance companies were subrogated to
the rights of the insured. He certainly did so
most ably. It is further stated that the case was
like this. There is, sir, no similarity between
them, and by observing the distinction between
the cases, the bouudaries of the doctrine of
subrogation will be made clear. The United
States was ou terms of amity with Prance.
Diplomatic relations existed. The French
apologized for seizing our merchantmen.
They said they could not distinguish American
from English seamen; that all the Govern-
ment of France could do would be to give
indemnity for the wrong they had done those
whose vessels they had seized. (Ex. Doc.
1826, p. 70.) General Washington, too, in
1795, (Waite's State Papers, vol. 3, p. 402,)
iu'.a confidential message to Congress, stated
that perfect harmony subsisted between the
two republics. Those seizures were made by
France when all Europe was against her, and
in the stress of circumstances she seized our
merchantmen laden with provisions and said
she would make indemnity. It was clearly
a private claim our merchants had, and of
course, under the law, the insurer would be
subrogated to the rights of the insured. That
was what Mr. Webster justly contended for.
If a British man-of-war stranded on a dis-
tant shore should send its crew and seize an
American merchantman, in order to supply
itself with provisions, the owner of the ship
undoubtedly would haveaprivate claimagainst
Great Britaiu, to which an insurer, when Eng-
land paid the money, could be subrogated.
But suppose in the war of 1812 an English
man-of-war destroyed an American merchant-
man, had the American merchantman any
claim against England? Or if an English
ship of war was provisioned and manned in
the ports of France or Spain, Powers friendly
with the United States, would the American
merchant, by the destruction of-his ship by
the British man-of-war, have a private claim
against France or Spain? No; the act was
one of war, and was controlled by the public
law. This nation might and would call France
or Spain to account for violating her good
iaith as a neutral, but the individual would
have no claim. The instance of French
spoliations, when compared with this ease,
draws the line of distinction between individ-
ual and national claims, and limits properly
the right of subrogation.
_ Mr. President, pardon another considera-
tion why the claim of insurance companies
which have made profit should not be allowed.
Ihe Geneva tribunal made no allowance for
war premiums paid by our merchants. The
principal of that tribunal was indemnity for
loss. Audt.hey could not make an allowance for
war premiums, because those war premiums
were in excess of the value of property lost โข
and hence the profits made by the insurance
companies. The loss they estimated at fif-
teen-and a half millions; the war premiums
are generally estimated at not less, than twenty-
five millions.
This bill makes no allowance for war pre-
miums, for two reasons; because no fund was
received for that purpose from Geneva, and
because the loss by the payments of those pre-
miums did not fall on those who paid them
any more than the price of the goods insured;
the premium was added to the price of the
goods and paid by the people. This premium,
thus returned to the merchant by the people,
was paid to the insurance companies, and they
therewith paid the losses for which they now
claim an allowance and had a profit over. So
we see the payment by the insurance compa-
nies for losses was made with the premiums
paid by the merchants, and the merchauts
were repaid their war premiums by the people
in the enhanced value of the goods imported.
It is difficult to see what possible claim on this
fond an insurance company that made a profit
out of the war has, merely because it was the
ageucy through which the people and the mer-
chants paid the losses that the Alabama and
her associates occasioned.
But, sir, why not extend this doctrine of
subrogation to foreign insurance companies as
well as to our own companies? England is
and was a friendly neutral Power. She was
not even, we are told, indirectly accessory to
the confederates. Why, then, not pay the
foreign insurance companies that made profit
out of the war as well as our own? Then we
should have a beautiful picture 1 The war came
suddenly; large shipments were to be made
from England, under a uniform contract, re-
quiring that insurance be made. A vast amount
of goods were insured in London and large
profits made by reason of the war premiums
there received. Then the people here have
kept up a commotion for several years, vacil-
lating between war and arbitration. Then we
receive the money ; and now, under the doc-
trine of the Senator from Ohio, we should send
the money back to the insurance companies
in England, to be distributed as extra divi-
dends among those now stockholders! If the
argument is good in reference to the insurance
companies of this country, it is as good in
reference to insurance companies that exist in
a friendly foreign country.
I submit, sir, we do all our duty when we
pay insurance companies the amount that they
lost by the transaction of the war.
It was asked, with some confidence, why
should any insurance companies ever be sub-
rogated to the rights of the insured if they
make a profit, if not in this case? The rea-
son is that the doctrine of subrogation applies
where the insured had a vested right to which
the insurer can be subrogated, and therefore
whether the company made a profit or not, it
is subrogated to the rights of the insured ; but
this being a national claim, in fact so declared
by the treaty, the insured had no interest in
the fund to which the insurer could be sub-
rogated.
This fund, then, comes to the United States
as a sovereignty to be disposed of as it sees
proper according to its lair and sovereign
discretion, and does not come to the United
States as a trustee. When a trustee presents
two undefined claims to arbitration, say each
of them equitable and just for $10,000, and
the arbitrators perpetrate the folly of awarding
to one ยง20,000 and to the.other nothing, I
suppose the trustee must carry out the award,
absurd as it is, unless it is set aside. But it is
not so with a sovereign Power. That, not hold-
ing the fund as a trustee, is governed only by
the principles of morality and justice, and dis-
tributes the award at its sovereign discretion.
A word more, Mr. President, on the second
point insisted on, in reference to the claim of
the insurers. It is stated that the United
States obtained the money award of Great
Britain on the representation and basis of the
insurance companies being entitled to subro-
gation, and that we are in honor bound to
apply it to .those on account of whom it was
paid. Nothing, sir, is more imprudent than
to rely upon matters which are outside of the
record. The arbitrators nowhere state that
they award this fifteen and a half millions,
or any part of it, because of the claims of the
insurers. In the next place, if the record
had so stated, if the arbitrators had ad-
judged that five millions were for the insurers
because of the doctrine of subrogation, we
should not be influenced by such determina-
tion, because it would be extra judicial and
mere obiter dictum. The arbitrators had no
right to apply or distribute this fund. They
had a right to find a sum in gross, or they had
a right to fix principles which were to control,
and then refer the finding what was due to
each class to the board of assessors. But,
sir, the case shows that this award was not
based upon the idea of an allowance to the
insurers, but upon the purpose of making
some award for the general loss of wealth to
the nation, because the award allows some
four or five millions more than is sufficient to
pay all the insurance companies and individ-
ual claimants who lost by the three cruisers.
It was stated here in argument that it was
represented On the part of the United States
before the tribunal at Geneva that the claims
of insurers should be allowed. The counsel
sent to Geneva were honorable gentlemen;
they were lawyers understanding their profes-
sional duty to their client, and especially when
that client was their country, and I will show
the Senate that they had express instructions
from this Government not to present the
claim of insurers in any such manner that
they would thereby have any claim upon that
fund. I visited the State Department and
examined some of the papers there, and ob-
tained permission to bring away with me a
copy of the communication from Mr. Fish to
the counsel, which I will read, showing clearly
that there is no foundation for the allegation
that we are bound to pay the insurers, because
the case was presented to that tribunal in such
manner as to make it dishonorable not to pay
them.
The instructions are as follows;
Department of State,
Washington. December 8,1871.
Gentlemen: In the discussion of this question
and in the treatment of the entire case you will be
carofal not to commit the Government a.s to the dis-
position of what may be awarded or what may be
recovered in the event of the appointment of the
board of assessors mentioned in the tenth article of
the treaty. It is possible that there may be dupli-
cate claims for some of the property alleged to have
been captured and destroyed, as in the case of in-
surers and insured. The Government wishes to hold
itself free to decide as to the rights and claims of
insurers upon the termination of the case. If the
value of the property captured or destroyed be re-
covered in the name of the Government, the distri-
bution of the amount reoovered will be made by
this Government without committal as to the mode
of distribution. It is expected that all such com-
mittal be avoided in the argument of counsel.
I have the honor to be, gentlemen, your obedient
servant, HAMILTON FISH.
Hon. Caleb Cushins, William M. Evakts, and
M. R. VPaite.
With those instructions from the Depart-
ment of State, sir, our counsel did not make
the claims of the insurers in any manner the
basis of the award of the Geneva tribunal.
We may properly assume that the counsel dis-
charged their duty faithfully and honorably.
I think it sufficiently appears that this is a
national relief fund to which no one has such
a right as to be subject to subrogation.
A word more and I am through. If, then,
this is a national fund, what is to be done
with it? It is contended by some that as this
nation is under as great obligation to protect
the property of its citizens on land as on sea,
and as the cause was the same, no matter
where the sacrifice was made, that those who
lost thousands of millions on land should
be ratably indemnified out of this fund, and
that a perfectly ratable distribution would be
effected by paying the money into the Treas-
ury in relief of taxation. There is at 'least
plausibility in this suggestion. But, sir, as we
are able to trace a part of this fund and ideu-
