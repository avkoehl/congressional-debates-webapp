but by the afflicting haud cf Providence, had been
rendered incompetent He cannot be compelled to
lesiga his office, nor can he be removed This bill,
in this state of thing1-, (Congress not being limited
by the Constitution as to the number of judges
which it may assign to a court,) proposes to ap-
point an additional judge, who, notwithstanding
the incompetency of the present judge, may despatch
the business which belongs to the jurisdiction of that
court The remedy for this state of things would,
11 ill piobability, soon be applied by the hand oí
nature in a few )ears at most The prestnt in
cumLcnt would be removed by the hand of time,
and then, b\ declining to supplj the vacancy, the
Court will be restored to its original organization
The question, then, was, whether the expense of an
additional judge shall be incurred, so as to dispose
ot the business of the Court, or shall it remain
blocked up, to the great annoyance and oppression
of the people ol the District, urtil Providence shad

PLAN OF A NATIONAL BANK
Mr CLAY ot Kentucky, rose, and stated that
he wrshed to present a petition confided to his care,
signed by a numbei ol persons, piavmsr for the
establishment ol i Bank (f the Umti d States It
uassimiiii to seven! othet petitions which had
been presented to the Senate, or tu the House, du-
rin, the piesem session, prajmg fir the sime ob-
j"ci Fiicy ailord evidence of a deep and reluming
conviction, amon^ the pet pie, oí the utility of such
an mstiliuion
Whilst I am up [continue 1 Mr   Ceii,] with the
pei mission of I he ¡bínate, 1 beg leive to submit a
few obseivations upon this subject      There is rea-
son to believe thai much honest mi conception and
sone  misrepresentation   prevail in  regard  to it,
which I wish to correct    It had bren supposed that
those   who  die  desnous of seeing a Bank of the
United States established aic anxious that a char
<ei should be gianted to  an  existing State institu-
tion, which has an eminent  individual at its head, |
and that this was the snle c hjcet of all their exer-
lious       Now  I wish    (( r one  t> '■aj   that I have i
n i such purpose in why     1 emu lam for that gen-
tleman very lu0h lespcei       I believe him uncom-
monlv able, pioloundly  s* lit d  m finance, and
truly patriotic     There is but one olhei  person, ]
connecttd wilh the uankmg institniionsof the coun- (
tn , in whose idm lustration ol a Bank ot the Uni-
ted States I should ha\e oqu ll confidence with Mi   i
1 nidle, anl that is Albci i Galla tn, who, I am glad '
to leiru, at an advancei age, retains, mfull vigor,
the laculties ot  his extraouinary mind      There
maybe other cituens equally competent with those
ivv-o gentlemen, but I do not know them, ol am
not acquainted with their paitieular qualifications     ,
But u is not lor any existing State bank, or any |
portion ai individual at lis head,  that I am con- ¡
tending     ) belieie the establishment of a Bank of
the United Slites is required by  (he common Bood I
<f the whole coun rj, an 1 although I might b( wil- ]
ling it it  were  practical If,  to  al>pr  an existing |
banl a" it     I>a is ol *nrb  an m t till on, under all
Ct'ci instance*, 1 thirk it iiosi. expedient that a new
bant, \ ith power to establish branches, bp created
and chaiteied under the   luthomy ol  Congress
My friends (as fir as ! know  their opinions) and
I are not particularly attached to this or that indi-
vidual, to this or that existing bank, but to prin-
ciples, to the thing itself, to the institution, to a
well-organized Bank of the United States, tinder
the salutary operation of which the business of the
country had so grsatly prospered, -and we bad
eveiy reason to hope would again revive and
prosper. And, presuming upon the indulgence of
the Senate, I will now take the liberty to suggest,
for public consideration, some of those suitable
conditions and restrictions under which it appears
to me that it would be desirable to establish a new
bank
1   The capital not to be extravagantly large, but,
at the same time, amply sufficient to enable it to
peiform the needful financial duties for the Go-
vernment, to supply a general currency of untform
value throughout the Union, and to facilitate, as
nigh as piacticable, the equalization of domestic
exchange I suppose that about fifty millions
would answer all those purposes The stock might
be divided between the General Government, the
States, according to their federal population, and
individual subscriber, the poition assigned to the
litter to be distributed at auction or by private sub-
scription
2   The corporation, in the spirit of a resolution
recently adopted by the General Assembly of the
State, one of whose Senators I have the honor to
be, to receive such an organization as to blend, in
fair proportions, public and private control, and
combining public and private interest , and, in or-
der to exclude the possibility of the exercise of all
foreign influence, non-resident foreigners to be pro-
hibited not only from any share in the administra-
tion of the corporation, but from holding, directly
or indirectly, any portion of its stock Although I
do not myself think this latter restriction necessary
I would make it, m delerence to honest prejudices,
sincerelj emeitained, and which no practical states-
man ought entirely to disregard The bank would
thus be, n its origin, and continue throughout its
whole existence, a genuine American institution
3    4n adequate portion of the capital to be spI
apart in productive stocks, and placed in permanent
security, beyond the reach of the corporation, (with
the exception of the accruing profits on those
stocks,) sufficient to pay promptly, m any contin-
gency, the amount of all such paper, under what-
ever form, that the bank shall put forth as a partot
the general circulation The bill or note holders,
in other words, the mass of the community, ought
to be protected against the possibility of the failure
or the suspension of a bank The supply of the
circuta'mg medium of a country is that faculty of
a bank, the proj^riety of ihe exercise of which may
be most controverted The dealings with a bank,
ol those who obtain discounts, or make deposites,
are toluntaiy and mutually advantageous, and
they are comparatively few in number But the
reception of what is issued and used as a part of the
circulating medium of the country, is scarcely a
voluntary act, and thousands take it who have no
other concern whatever with the bank The many
ought to be guarded and secured by the care of the
legislative authoutj, the vigilance of ihe few will
secure them against loss I thirk this piovision is
a desideratum m our American banking, and the
credit of first embodying it m a legislative act is
due to the State oí New Yoik
4    Perfect publicity as <0 the state of the bank
at all times, including, besides the usual heads of
information, the names ol eveiy debtor to the
bank, whether as draw er, endorser, or surely, pe-
riodically exhibited, and open to public inspection ,
or, if that should be found inconvenient the right
to be secured to any citizen to ascettain at the bank
the nature and extent of the lesponsibihty of any
of its customers There is ~o necessity to thiow
any veil of secrecy around the ordinary transac-
tions of a bank Publicity will increase responsi
bilitv, icpress favoritism, insure the negot ation of
good naper, and, when individual insolvency un-
fortunately occurs, will deprive the bank of undue
advantages now enjojed by banks practically m
the distribution of the effects of the insolvent
"> A limitation ot the div.dends so as not to au-
ihoii/o moie than — per cent to be struck. This
will checc undue expansiOBS in the «ifculating
