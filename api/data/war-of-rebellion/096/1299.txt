The subject of transportation is a serious one; having but one line to depend upon to the chief magazines of supply, the utmost efficiency is demanded in the management of the lines connecting us with North Carolina, and it behooves the Government to exercise the most rigid scrutiny upon the work upon these roads, otherwise the collection of supplies will avail nothing. The exposure of supplies at some points, especially in North Carolina, is much to be deplored, and it is to be hoped that the present scarcity will at least arouse all to more effort than has been shown at these points.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. H. CLAIBORNE,

Major and Commissary of Subsistence.
HEADQUARTERS FIRST ARMY CORPS,March 10, 1865.

General R. E. LEE,

Commanding, &amp;c.:

A deserter just in from the enemy's lines reports Thomas' army on this side preparing for an attack by the Williambsburg road. He also reports return of a part of Porter's fleet to the James River. If any part of Pickett's division is with us please send it over to me at once. It should cross at the bridge at Drewry's.

J. LONGSTREET,

Lieutenant-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIRST ARMY CORPS,March 10, 1865.

General R. E. LEE,

Commanding, &c.:

A deserter just in from the enemy's lines reports the arrival of Thomas' army to re-enforce the Army of the James. He reports this new force at 30,000 and in camp toward the Williamsburg road, making preparations for an attack on our left. He seems to be more than usually intelligent and truthful. I send him into the city to-day that you may have him questioned further, if you think fit.

If any portion of Pickett's division was left behind I hope that you will order it to me to once. There are huts on the Nine-Mile road that will shelter them from the weather and keep them in good position to meet any move toward our left. My present force is barely sufficient to meet the original Army of the James; it will be entirely inadequate against half the force said to have arrived from the West. The deserter also reports the arrival of a part of Porter's fleet in the James River. The enemy will attempt to come up the river at the same time that he moves against me. His preparations along our lines in front of Cahffin's for several days past seem to indicate an attack there.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. LONGSTREET,

Lieutenant-General.
