Honorable ROBERT OULD, Agent of Exchange, Richmond, Va.:

SIR: In reference to your letter of [11th] instant, addressed to Lieutenant-General Grant, proposing to deliver without delay, by way of James River, Wilmington, or other convenient points, the Federal prisoners in your hands, provided an assurance was given that an equal number of Confederate prisoners would be delivered within a reasonable time, I am authorized by the lieutenant-general commanding Armies of the United States to accept your proposition, and give the assurance required. You can make your deliveries by way of James River, Wilmington, Mobile, the mouth of Red River, or some other point to be agreed upon on the Mississippi River. The prisoners can be delivered to officers in command of U. S. forces at the points indicated. Our deliveries will be made in James River at the rate of from 3,000 to 5,000 per week.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

NASHVILLE, February 16, 1865-4.50 p. m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

General Forrest, through General Wilson, says that he is willing and anxious to have us send clothing to our prisoners confined in Mississippi and Alabama.* He represents them as suffering, and guarantees safe transmittal and delivery of everything sent to them. They number about 7,000. He wishes also to make an exchange of prisoners now in their hands, or who may hereafter be taken. Is also desirous of allowing the people to send their cotton within our lines and take out nothing but necessaries of life.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General.
