Major-General ROUSSEAU;

Commanding U. S. Forces:

GENERAL: Hearing nothing of either Colonels Spalding or Grummond, and my command being entirely worn down, I have gone into camp on the road leading south from this place. I have directed that Colonels Spalding and Grummond and the battery encamp north of the river. I have sent reconnoitering parties on the Mount Pleasant and Pulaski was intact up to this afternoon. There is no telegraphic communication. The railroad is not damaged but for a mile or two this side of Spring Hill, and I think you had better have the train from here bring down the infantry, and they may be able to ride thus even to Pulaski. Any way, it will save ten or fifteen miles and place them where they can support me to-morrow. I shall try and determine to-night whither they have gone, whether down the railroad toward Pulaski or toward Florence or directly west toward the Tennessee River.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JNO. T. CROXTON,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers.
