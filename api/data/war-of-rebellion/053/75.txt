HDQRS. FIRST BRIGADE, CAVALRY DIVISION, Camp Davies, Miss., October 4, 1863.

HDQRS. SECOND BRIG., CAV. DIV., 16TH ARMY CORPS, La Grange, Tenn., October 4, 1863.

Lieutenant W. P. CALLON,Acting Assistant Adjutant-General, Cavalry Division:

LIEUTENANT: I received your order for sending two battalions on our south front at 8 o'clock this morning from provost-marshal's office. The battalions are sent, but I have not the force to relieve them from this post unless General Sweeny can release the picket [75 men], provost [25 men], and his body guard [40 men], which I do not think he will do. Two companies of the Sixth Tennessee are at Moscow. I should think they might assist in relieving the post at Early Grove on their own immediate front. The Sixth Tennessee, at Grand Junction, is charged with scouting daily as far south as Ripley. I have kept a scouting party out toward Holly Springs all the time, day and night, which sometimes goes to Lamar and sometimes to Hudsonville.

I am, lieutenant, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

L. F. McCRILLIS,

Colonel, Commanding Brigade.

MEMPHIS, TENN., October 4, 1863.

Colonel L. F. McCRILLIS,

Comdg. Second Brigade, Cavalry Division, La Grange:

Move with your entire available force to Lockhart's Mill, on the Coldwater, south of Mount Pleasant, immediately. Take five days' full rations, the men to carry two and wagons three. Look out for the enemy in the direction of Holly Springs and Salem. Keep out scouts in that direction all the time. Picket La Grange with convalescent if you have them. Have courier at train to-morrow morning for full instructions.

EDWARD HATCH,

Colonel, Commanding Division.
