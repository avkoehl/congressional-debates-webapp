FORT KEARNY, August 23, 1864.

Major S. S. CURTIS:

Just arrived. Captain Thompson arrived this morning. He scouted the country effectively, but, as usual, the Indians skulked away. They are still shooting and stealing and shoot stragglers. It is thought old friend Jones, of Omaha, was, and his wife and children are, prisoners. Hard storm last night.

S. R. CURTIS,

Major-General.
