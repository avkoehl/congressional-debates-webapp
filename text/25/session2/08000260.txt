tatits could not be had without a sale of lands To
hive refused to sell altogether, would have viola-
ted the compacts, to have fixed a price at which
the hnd would not sell, would have been equalh
nmgnant Nay, sir, the establishment of prices
above the fair relative value of the land's, would
necessarily have tended to retard the settlement.ol
the countrv, and have delayed, unreasonably, the
formation of State1-, and would, therefore, have
been at least a violation of the spit it of the compact*.
Was the General Government released from the
obligation to sell m a reasonable lime and en leason-
aiU tnmi, by the admission of the new States'!
\o «11, then  is no change of the duty of this Go-
vernment, in th it respect, either made oi proposed
in the acts of Congiess authormng or sanctioning
the forma'ton of State Governments The under-
taking to build up and foini new States, so far as
lhedspos,tt(.n ol the public domain is concerned,
is lelt m full force Ey the compacts of the new
Staus « uh this Government on their admission, as
we have seen, they are íestrained from all inlet -
fc renre with the pumary disposal of the unappro-
priated lands, and they are expressly agreed to "be
and nmaiii al the sole and entire disposition ot the
Dmted Slates " The obligation ot the General
Got ernment is ev en made stronger by the inhibition
imposed on the exercist of sovereignty by the new
States as to selling and against taxing lands sold
by the United States, tor the term of five years after
the chy «I sale To prevent the settlement of the
public lands íetaimd by this Government without
lu^t purclnsms; them, and vntually to prohibit
purchi oj, by fixing a minimum price amounting
to double, and, in many instances, more than four-
told, the i 1 Hive value, would be, to my mind, a
miniltst bteaoh ot good faith By the ordinance
onruwng the Terntoiies northwest of the river
Ohio afterwaxls applied to thj others, (with the
exception ol the article against slavery) it was
stipulated that, whenever any of them should have
snty thousand free inhabitants, they should be at
liberty lo form a permanent Constitution and State
Govei ninent, and be admitted into the Union
With little greater population, most of the new
Stall sime been admitted Concede to this Go-
vernment the power which I am controverting,
•Hid let it be exercised, and the population and
tes muís of the new States might lor ever remain
sun i in But, sn, I cannot suppose that any
gtnilimin «ho will examine the compacts can
place sucn a construction on them If tins Go
eunmaitwa 1 ound to afford all reasonable and
just faoibtii s fe i the settlement and improvement
of the I't rut< nes, that they might commence State
uovornmenls, having retained the power over the
pul lie domain, it is bound, m good faith, to conti-
nue its exercise in such manner as to facilitate
their continued population and improvement till
tin v shall have attained full maturity
¡Vh President, independent of the obligations
impost d upon the General Government, by the
terms ol the compacts with the ceding States and
with the new oni s, a just and liberal policy toward
ihe latter, demands a reduction of the price of in-
lenor lands We have seen irom the report of the
Oi mmissioner of the Gen ral Land Ornee, made
at the present session, that ilia sales of public lands
at auction and private entry, fci the entire period
of the cash sjstem to the 30th September last,
1 a\e only avenged <U 27 4 5 per acre Those
sales have embraced the most fertile and valuable
portions of the public domain Within that pe-
r jd, (is prosperous as any we have known,) near-
ly (ill Alabama, Mississippi, and parts of Louisi-
ana, including the fmeu cotton region ot our coun-
trv or perhaps in the world, have been in mai-
¡ t O 522,512,334, offered for sale, since the
commencement of the cash system, 61,296,410
b i e been sold Hence, the average stated may
b (oi sido¡et¡ a fair puce for all lands of the first,
or appioximatmg the first quality It may be con-
sidered the maximum lalne, whilst the l-aw makes it
tí¡   mtiiimum price
The entire quantity of public lands which has been
rffcred for saie, from the earliest period to 30/fc Sep-
lonbei lait, is 172,374,470 acres, and the whole
quantity disposed of, at public and private sale,
but 7^025,055 acres, leaving, as before   stated,
97,34D,J15 .itres snbtett io piivate enlti, no pui-
chaset having yet cousideied it win th the present
minimum1 Why does tnis large proper tion remain
unvoldi Compared with the lands generally, whuh
have been sold, it doubtless has equal advantages
in all respects, except lertiUly It is dispelled
throughout the old, as well «as the new settlements,
and, consequently, may be regarded, generally, as
equally health}, equally convenient to trade, and
possessing equal facili'tes ot transportation The
true answei to the question I have just piopoumW
will be obvious to all it w ill not sell tot the mini-
mum price, as the othei poitton has, because it is
not worth it Itisovvm™ to the diífeunce ol intrin-
sic value It is not only mfsi 101 in soil, but mm h
of it is totally without value, according to documen-
tary evidence whuh has bun on joui files for nine
years In the yeai 1828, the legisléis and receivers
of the several land districts weie called upon by the
Secretary ol the Treasuiy to repoit the quantity of
land subject to uiliy in then respective distucts
and its quality and di in iption The icsult was, as
to the aggiegtte, 74,V>8 881 acres, of «Inch
28 247,000 actes, being more than one-third, weie
un/U fot niltnation' The same pioportion of what
is now subjec t to pmale entry, would amount to
more than ir) 000 000 of acres, unfit for cultivation'
And yet the ne\ ei vai y mg uniformity of pnce pie-
supposes that all lands must at least be worth a cei-
tatn fixed sum'
Mi President, is not the principle adopted by this
Government, in relation to the sile of the public
lands, altugitut i anomalous? What othei vendor
evet held laud, or any othei descuplionol propertv,
to bs. oi the same \alue, and «it the same ptiC(,
without rcgaid to quality? If an individual whi
holds lands bmdeungon the Mississippi oiltid
river, and also otheis, consisting of sand hills, pine
barrens, or rocky mountuns, were to demand, in
flexibly, the same pi ice lot each quality, would not
all the vvorld ímpetuh his un lerstanding, oi his
judgment Aie all domestic animals ot the same
species, necessanlv oí the same value' How pi
lound would tl at man's judgment bo considntd
«ho would appiccute as highly thecoatse dray-
horse, as the uVct couisei, or the war-hoise1 If a
merchant were to demand the same ¡nice for all
goods manufactured ol the same kind ol material,
without distinguishing between lawn ai d oiiwittrffs,
or between broud cloths and kermp, the absuidtty ol
his conduct would b« univ ersally di nouiiced Can
that be wise m a Government which would subjeit
an individual to the just charge of folly or madness?
Sir, a reduction of the puce of the refuse public
lands is not only demanded by justice to the peo-
ple ol the new States, but also by expediency in
reference to the inteicst of 'his Government At
the present minimum, veiy little of the land now
subject to entry will sell m many years, and much
oí it never will It is better for the United States,
even as regatds the amount to be rectived, to sell
al half the price established by 1 in, than to keep it
on hand for eighteen or twenty years OI the
71,000 000 of acres whuh have been offered, with-
out selling, for five years and upwards, and in-
tended to be leached by this bill, it is probable
50,000,000 would sell (or enough to average half
the present minimum, say G~i cenls pet at re The
aggregate sum produced at tins late, on the quan-
ta} supposed, would be $il 258,000, the interest
on which, in about eightcwi years, would make it
equal the price demanded by the existing law
Some of it may be sold in less time, but a great
proportion of the 50,000 000 of acres which I
have supposed mii,ht now be sold at some price,
will not sell at $1 25 per acie within thirty or forty
yeais An immediate sale, then, at half the pre
sent minimum, wojld not only be consistent with
the pecuniary interest of the Government, but it
would convert barren wastes into more or less
productive fields, asd thus adl to the general re-
sources and prosperity ol our country
Whilst the interest of the General Government
is not advanced, the effects of the piesent policy on
the prosperity of the new States is h ghly injurious
It greatly retards, if it does not entirely prei ent,
the population of large prrtions of then terntorj
Not being worth the present minimum, no one is
willing to purchase the inferior lands, and f«w are
v i ling lo go upon them and make such improve-
ments as would give, them increased value, suffi-
cient to induce some heartless speculator to enter
i hem over then heads, and rob them of the fruits of
then labor The few who do go upon them may
be regaided as meieitmetants Knowing the un-
ceitainly ot their tenure, they make no improve-
ments of a permanent character, they cut down and
destroy the ttmbei, without regard to economy, and
thev cultivate the so I merely for temporary conve-
nience, having no imeiest m its preservation The
tendency of this mode of sett'ement and cultivation
is to exhaust and impoverish, instead of adding any
thing to, the permanent wealth and prosperity of the
countt v In the mean time, the right of taxation
is suspended Is it astonishing that the new States
ate dissatisfied or impatient, when their legitimate
resomces are thus crippled, or entirely cutoff?
And are not those of the Union also injuriously
afiectedi Supp-se the great Valley of the Missis-
sippi were still a wilderness, unsettled and unim-
proved by the arts of civilization, how much would
it not diminish the wealth and stiength of this great
Confederacy' Take away the/our millions of souls,
who now inhabit that region, and the rich produc's
of then libor, industry and ingenuity, and what a
hiatus it would occasion in the now mighty tc-
sources of out Government' Yet the soil would be
there, m all its native richness Sir, it is not va-
cant, unpeopled, and unimproved territory that
constitutes the strength or greatness of any country
it is a numerous, virtuous, intelligent and en r-
pnsmg population, with then agriculture, ta ir
commerce, their mechanic arts and their manufac-
tures, constituting, at the same time, its wealth, and
its best bulwark of defence Give to the new
Sutes a haidy and industrious pjpulation, instead
ol your waste hnd>, and whilst yoa increase their
siK n„th a d prosperity, }ou will add to those of
the Union
Put vmu ulusi 1 mdsattheii fair relative value,
tint you give hoims t) the honest and industrious
pool, who have been unable to enter, or have been
duvdi licnn, the field ot competition with men of
' uge capita!, md still laigei credit By thus giv-
ing them an opportunity to acquire a permanent
interest m (he soil of their country, you will simú-
lale their industry and enterprise, and increase their
uv I ulness as citizens Nor will this liberal and
enltghti ned poney muie exclusively to the benefit
of the new States, ot of then present inhabitants
No, su it will not only bring millions into your
Ire isu i y which can never be realized under y out
piesmt sjstem, but it will open the door through
which thousands of the laboring classes and hum-
ble ttnantty of the old States may acquire comfoit-
able homes for their 'amilies, and enjoy the proud
independence ol freeholders If gentlemen could
see, as I hiveseen, the vast difference—the almost
magic change—wiought not only on the face of
lire country, but in the character of its population,
by conveitirif mere occupants into fee simple pro
prietors of the soil, I am persuaded they would
no longer hesitate as to the expediency of the pro-
posed polity They would ste that not only the
new States but the Union at large, would gam by
making unqua'i'ed donations, rather than by con-
tinuing tntse tefuse lands a part of the public do-
main Bet, sir, 1 repeat, we do not ask donations,
the bill proposes no gift, we only ask that this class
of the public lands may become individual pro-
perty at their fan relative va'ue If that cannot
b( ,istertamed under the provisions of the bill, noi
amendment, offer us a better plan, and, if it be a
valua i( n by actual personal examination of eve-
ry eighty acre tr ict, we shall not object We a«k
