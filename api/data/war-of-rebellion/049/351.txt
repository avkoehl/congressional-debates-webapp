Honorable E. M. STANTON, Secretary of War, and Major General H. W. HALLECK, General-in-Chief:

At 10. 45 a. m. I received telegram from General Sullivan stating:

Our forces were driven out of Charlestown by Imboden's forces. I will occupy it again to-day. Our loss I cannot tell.

At 11. 45 a. m. the following:

I have driven Imbonden out of Charlestown. Major Cole is pursuing. The Ninth Maryland Infantry is captured. The enemy is retreating in the direction of Berryville.

JER. C. SULLIVAN,

Brigadier-General.

Deserters from Imboden report at Martinsburg that White and Gilmore are with him, and that the aggregate is 3,500, all cavalry, 100 being dismounted, the force having six pieces of artillery. We have reports of rebel cavalry being seen this morning near Duffield's and also near Batch. Can Harper's Ferry be re-enforced from Baltimore or Washington? Have you any information of movements of Lee's army toward or into Shenandoah Valley?
