General R. E. LEE,

Commanding Army of Northern Virginia:

GENERAL: I have to apologize to you for not sooner having acknowledged and replied to your letter of the 1st instant relative to the order suggested concerning deserters. Your communication was promptly laid before the President, but owing to the pressure of important engagements I only on yesterday received his reply in the form of an indorsement upon a letter from myself. I send both as the best mode of conveying the exact wish of the President.* I may add that my own views concur entirely with your opinion, and would approve such an order as you propose.

Very respectfully,

JAMES A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War.
