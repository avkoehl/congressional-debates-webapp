HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,August 14, 1864-8 p. m.

Major-General ORD,

Commanding Eighteenth Corps:

The proposed extension of your corps and that of the Ninth, having been sanctioned by Lieutenant-General Grant, the major-general commanding directs that you relieve the Ninth Corps from as much of their line as you can hold in the manner heretofore indicated. Should you require any additional field artillery to supply the place of that taken out of battery by the Ninth Corps, call on General Hunt, chief of artillery, Army of the Potomac, who is directed to answer your requisitions. The changes should be made as soon as practicable.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS EIGHTEENTH ARMY CORPS,August 14, 1864-8.20 p. m.

General A. A. HUMPHREYS:

Will the general commanding give distinct orders to General Burnside so that I can know certainly what part of his front I am to occupy and can give definite orders on the subject. I can take half of it, but do not know how much that, is, or to what place it will take me.

E. O. C. ORD,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,August 14, 1864-9.10 p. m.

Major-General ORD,

Commanding Eighteenth Corps:

The major-general commanding requests that you will occupy one-half of the front of the Ninth Corps. I have telegraphed General Parke that you will do so, and will at once request him to designate the exact spot where your left will rest under that arrangement. I take it to be where the small marsh or run that you crossed in going to the mine intersects our intrenchments.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS EIGHTEENTH ARMY CORPS,August 14, 1864-9.45 p. m.

General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

I have five light batteries-two rifle and two 12-pounders, not under cover-which can be moved to any place at once. Would it not be well to keep the batteries of the Ninth and Fifth Corps now behind parapets where they are, and take for the use of the Fifth batteries of one corps which are not in place or under cover, because shifting the batteries in place would attract the attention of the enemy?

E. O. C. ORD,

Major-General.
