APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
[Novemb&r *29,
Sf?$h Coxa....3d Sess.
Report of the Secretary of the Interior.
Senate & Ho. of Reps.
The number of pensioners of every class in the
loyal States on the 30ih June, 1862, was 8,159,
requiring the sum of4752,711 71 to pay their pen-
sions. The amount.&ctualiy paid the past year,
including expenses of agencies and arrears of pen-
sions, was $782,161 41.
p' :li is.ascertained, from the latest information,
|hat there were 2,073 pensioners in the disloyal
States, whose pensions amounted to $168,364 98.
3?he entire amount of pensions paid in those States
in 1861, accounted for, was $8,223 35.
At the close of the last fiscal year there remain-
ed in the hands of pension agents in the disloyal
States $03,697 56. Of this sum $15,535 29 have
k<een properly accounted for at different points
taken and held by the Federal forces at which pen-
sion agencies were located.
jLn examination of the statistics furnished'by
Jvhp records of the Pension Office shows a decrease
|n the number of pensioners, since 1861, of 477.
Ilhe aggregate payments in that year to pension-
ers was $1,072,461 55. For the present year the
amount duo to pensioners is $790,384 76, being
$282,077 79 less than was paid the previous year.
The number of bounty land warrants issued in
1861 was 5,341, granting 834,720 acres. For the
present year but 1,636 warrants were issued, grant-
ing 257,860 acres, being a decrease of 3,705 war-
rants, and of 576,860 acres of land.
Since the adoption of the Constitution there
ll&ve been granted for naval and military services
J35 801,802 acres of the public domain, which, if
estimated at $1 25 per acre, amounts to the sum
of $82,257,327 50-, and the aggregate amount of
money expended by the Government in the pay-
mentof Army and Navy pensions, since its organ-
ization, is ascertained to be $90,668,521 06.
The general pension act passed by Congress at
its lust session, and approved on the 14th July,
3862, hats largely increased the business nf the
Pension Office, and will add materially to the ex-
penditures on behalf of the pension list. The law
embraces in its terms cverv branch of the military
and naval service of (he United States since the
4th March, 1861, and humanely provides for two
classes of pensioners hitherto not recognized,
namely, mothers and sisters dependent for sup-
port upon officers or soldiers; and the pensions ro
disabled seamen, and to widows and minor chil-
dren of persons in both the Army and Navy, arc
increased.
The Commissioner states that «* these facts, in
addition to the consideration of the great numbers
now employed in the Army and Navy, have lud
to apprehensions, in some quarters, of an extrav-
agant, it' not insupportable, annual burden result-
ing from -this law, in itself certainly no more lib-
eral than simple justice demands towards the
firmed defenders of the country in this day of trial.
Fr a careful examination of the data upon
which estimates may be based, it is my convic-
tion—always supposing the results of the war to
be commensurate with what may reasonably be
expected from the means employed—that the total
annua! sum required to carry out this law will in
no year exceed $7,000,000."
The number of applications for Army invalid
pensions under thisnet was, to November 15,4,411.
The number of applications of widows (Army)
under tins law to same date was 5,161; of mothers,
901; of minor children, 20; and of sisters, 10.
In the Novy branch there were filed previous
to November 35,103 applications for invalid pen-
sions, 115 for widows, 20 for mothers, and 3 in
behalf of minor children. Making the total num-
ber of applications growing out of the present
war 10,804.
The eighth section of the pension act of July
14, 1862, made it the duty of the Commissioner
of Pensions to designate physicians and surgeons
to make biennial examinations of pensioners, as
required by the act of March 3, 1859, and also to
examine applicants for invalid pensions under the
late act. In the performance of this duty, the
Commissioner has selected persons in the various
States with reference to their professional skill
and integrity of character. It is believed that the
benefits designed by this provision nf the law will
be fully realized, and the greatly augmen ted labors
imposed upon the Pension Bureau will be per-
formed with little difficulty if the zealous coop-
eration of those ©fficera if obtained.
The act of July 14, 1862, authorizing the ap-
pointment of a special agent of the Pension Office
to assist in the detection of frauds against the pen-
sion laws, omitted to make appropriation to de-
fray the expenses incident to the service required
by the law, and I have therefore submitted an es-
timate of the amount that will be necessary for
that purpose.
The Commissioner alludes to " certain errone-
ous impressions which have prevailed in some
quarters" of the existence of obstacles in the way
of the ready transaction of business in the prose-
cution of just claims for pensions; and that officer
clearly explains, for the information ofall parties,
the forms prescribed for the convenience of appli-
cants under the various pension laws, and shows
that any one of ordinary intelligence can, by fol-
lowing the instructions of the bureau, secure the
a Imission of his claim without difficulty.
Considerable difficulty has been experienced
m prescribing a mode of authenticating pension
claims, which shall be sufficiently liberal to claim-
ants, and at the same time protect the Govern-
ment against frauds.
To require all applications to be authenticated
oefore a court of record causes much trouble, and,
in many cases, unreasonable expense to the ap-
plicants. If the authentication before any person
authorized to administer oaths shall be admitted
as sufficient, experience has demonstrated that the
Government is exposed to gross frauds. Large
sums have been obtained from the Treasury upon
fraudulent certificates of justices of the peace and
notaries.
To remedy these evils, it is recommended that
the Department be authorized to appoint pension
commissioners, who shall be authorized to receive
applications, administer the necessary oaths, and
certify the papers to the Pension Office, under
proper regulations. The commissioners should
receive from the applicants reasonable fees for
their services, and the pension certificates should
be forwarded to them to be delivered to the pen-
sioners. A commissioner may be appointed in
each county where it is probable any applicants
for pensions reside.
The adoption of a system like this would pro-
tect applicants for pensions from the unjust charges
which, in many cases, are now made by agents
and attorneys.
The attention of Congress is invited to the ac-
companying able report of the Commissioner of
Pensions.
THK EIGHTH CENSUS.
In my last annual leport I stated that the tak-
ing of the census had been completed, and that
the returns were being tabulated as fast as cir-
cumstances would admit. Since that period 1
communicated to Congress, at the last session, a
report, of the {Superintendent, which embraced a
narrative account of the progress and condition
of our population, agriculture, manufactures, in-
ternal improvements, banking institutions, &c.,
illustrative of the tabular statements which ac-
companied the report,and of others not ready for
publication.
In pursuance of resolutions of the two Houses
of Congress, respectively, this report has been
printed, and appears to have been favorably
received. The work in its now detailed form is
being prepared with all the rapidity consistent
with correctness, and it will devolve upon Con-
gress to direct its publication m such manner as
to insure its greatest utility. Much of the work
is now ready for the press, and no pains will bu
spared to have the whole completed at the earliest
moment possible.
In the present condition of the country it is dif-
ficult to state what sum may be required to com-
plete payments to the marshals and assistants, or
such of them as should be compensated, and to
complete the work. Thereremainsdue and unpaid j
to marshals and assistants the sum of $223,980,
being for the most part due officers in the insur-
reeL. nary States, and which was withheld on ac-
count of the known disloyalty of some, the^unccr-
tainty which existed respecting others, and the
impossibility of obtaining the information neces-
sary to enable the Superintendent to arrive at sat-
isfactory conclusions.
Theexpensesofcompilingthecensushave been [
increased by the demands which have been mads
by other Departments for clerical assistance, and
the callsfor information by Congress and the De-
partments, which have, at times, necessarily di-
verted many clerks on the census from their ordi-
nary duties. While the law of February 22,1862,
makes this office, in a measure, subordinate to the
War Department, for which it has performed
much service, it has seen proper to assign a por-
tion of its clerks, in moments of pressure, to other
branches of Government. For these reasons,and
on account of the great increase of population and
number of farms, enlarged area, multiplied man-
ufactures, and augmentation of numerous other in-
terests, all involving increased expenditure under
the law, it will be necessary to make some addi-
tional appropriation to complete the compilation
of the census, and I respectfully suggest the sum
of $50,000 as requisite for that purpose, leaving
it to Congress hereafter to provide for the claims
of the census takers in the insurrectionary States.
On this service, at the present time, one hundred
and ten persons are employed, including clerks,
laborers, messengers, and watchmen.
The appiopriatlons heretofore made to this service amount
to  $1,627,000 00
Of which there has been paid
to marshals and their assist-
ants  $1,064,43*2 03
For clerk hire and contingen-
cies  422,934 20
  1,487,356 23
Leavingu expendfidonthe30thSeptember.. $139,633 77
I have heretofore recommended'the establish-
ment of a Bureau of Statistics in connection with
this Office, and the experience of each year con-
firms my opinion of tho propriety of such a meas-
ure.
AFRICAN SLAVE TRADE.
Continued efforts have been m^de, with much
success, during the past year to suppress the Af-
rican slave trade. Several convictions have been
obtained of prominent persons engaged in fitting
out vessels for this traffic, and the lesson has been
impressively taught that it cannot longer be pros-
ecuted with impunity.
, The recent treaty made with Great Britain for
the suppression of the slave trade will do much to
accomplish the object desired.
The unexpended balance of the appropriation
for the suppression of the slave trade made two
years ago, will be sufficient to meetany ordinary
expenditures during the next fiscal year, and no
additional appropriation is recommended.
UNITED STATES COURTS.
The expenses of the United States courts dur-
ing the fiscal year ending June 30, 1862, were
$523,662 02, being $204,337 59 less than the ex-
penses of the previous year.
