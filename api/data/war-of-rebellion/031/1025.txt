purposes. The counties of Greenbrier and Monroe, owing to the excessive drought of last summer, have a surplus of nothing except a little hay and beef-cattle. No pork can be purchased here, but bee-cattle can be had - enough to sustain this army until spring-if forage can be found to feed them when the grass gives out. I have sent an agent to-day to the counties south of the railroad to make arrangements for feeding beef-cattle when the grass here shall be gone. The cavalry force in this department is already too great, and it is hoped that no more authorities will be granted for raising cavalry companies. Would it not be well to let such cavalry companies as chose be transferred to the infantry?

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JNO. S. WILLIAMS,

Brigadier-General, Commanding Department.
