There is not a particle of forage here. The last has given out, and all the horses of cavalry, artillery, and others have been without food to-day. The place is otherwise untenable and unfit for military defense. The rebels have appeared on the hills overlooking us to-day and we have shelled them and had skirmishing, with no particular result. i have permitted General Milroy to go up to the mountain with four regiments to prevent the planting of a battery which might shell us out and perhaps a night attack. I hope this may prove a diversion in our favor, but we cannot hold such a place without a very large force against superior numbers, and at all in the present destitution of forage. If our horses starve a day longer they will not be able to draw sway the train or carry us off. I greatly retreat the necessity of this conclusion, but i believe every officer here concurs in my views.
