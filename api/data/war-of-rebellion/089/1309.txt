General KIRKLAND,

Sugar Loaf:

General Bragg ordered Colonel Conally, with his command, back to you before he reached here. He must be near Sugar Loaf by this time.

A. VAN DER HORST,

Major and Assistant Adjutant-General.

SUGAR LOAF, December 25, 1864 - 4 p. m.

Major VAN DER HORST:

I have about 1,600 men; the enemy have landed and captured Battery Anderson and its garrison; they are still landing along the beach. I am fighting them; my ammunition is very short. Have been telegraphed from Fort Fisher for re-enforcements, but could send none. What shall I do if the enemy land on my left flank? - the road to Wilmington; they will then be in my rear. I ask this, as to fall back before them will involve the loss of Sugar Loaf. I will fight to the last. Answer.

W. W. KIRKLAND,

Brigadier-General.

DECEMBER 25, 1864 - 12 midnight.

General KIRKLAND,

Sugar Loaf:

A steam-boat with 400 men will leave soon for Sugar Loaf. They will land at Gander Hall, a quarter of a mile this side of Sugar Loaf. Have lights put at that point to guide the boat.

A. VAN DER HORST,

Major and Assistant Adjutant-General.

SMITHVILLE, December 25, 1864.

Major VAN DER HORST:

I wish you would order Utley and Plyer, with their horses, to report to me at Smithville to-day; order them to come by land; tell Utley to lead my horse; before he starts let him see Mrs. Hill. Nearly all the quarters at Fisher are burnt; the fire from the fleet was terrific. Twenty-three casualties at Fisher; five guns disabled; all will be fixed. We go to Fisher at daylight.

J. H. HILL,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
