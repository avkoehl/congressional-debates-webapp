HDQRS. BRIGADE HEAVY ARTILLERY,May 18, 1864-8 a.m.

GENERAL: My company which I ordered to the left h returned. I send the officer who went with it. He reports that has proceeded down the let bank of the river for 2 miles and found no cavalry or infantry. I have sent out another party to advance still farther. Will report on their return.

J. HOWARD KITCHING,

HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,May 18, 1864. (Received 12 midnight.)

Colonel KITCHING:

I shall want you to-morrow at daybreak to move your command to the vicinity of the Harris house, to which place Captain Cope will guide you, and picket very strong our right flank from General Cutler's right flank on Ny River outside the country north as far as you can, covering the pike to Fredericksburg. All our troops are going to be moved to the left of our corps.

G. K. WARREN.

Major-General.

MAY 18, 1864.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

I do not believe there is any point of the enemy's front on my line that can be attacked with any reasonable prospect of success, and therefore advise that the attack be no further prosecuted. Certainly I can find no such point.

H. G. WRIGHT,

Major-General, Commanding.

MAY 18, 1864.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

I have already reported my opinion against the further prosecution of the attack on the enemy's works, based partly on personal examination and partly on the report of Ricketts, who says he cannot advance successfully. I shall wait further orders for withdrawing.

H. G. WRIGHT,

Major-General, Commanding.
