CAPTAIN: Upon your arrival at Lynchburg with your battery you will report to the senior officer in command of the troops at that place, stating that you are ordered there for special service, in view of the movements of the enemy. You will take with your command such necessary harness as may be required to move your pieces, horses to be furnished at Lynchburg. By telegraph or otherwise you will advise me here when your services are no longer required, in order that you may be ordered back. Permit me to urge upon you to insist upon the strictest discipline and the most prompt action in all that relates to your command.

NEW MARKET, December 17, 1863.

General LEE:

The enemy's cavalry dashed upon my pickets at Edenburg this evening, capturing several. The horses are so completely worn out they are not able to get out of the way. I was left here with about fifty men to picket the entire Valley and scout. It is impossible for me to do so much longer. Have lost about twenty prisoners. I have fallen back to the Shenandoah bridge.

CHAS. T. O'FERRALL,

Major, Commanding Outpost.

DECEMBER 17, [1863-10] a. m.

Major General FITZ. LEE:

GENERAL: I have just received a dispatch from General Lee, who thinks you cannot catch Averell by following him, and says you had better try and intercept him. I learn from Lynchburg, since you left, that Averell went this morning on the route he came; that is, by Roanoke, Red Sulphur, and New Castle toward the Sweet's Springs, but that the water-courses are very high, especially Craig's Creek. Ascertain if you can cross the Cow Pasture above or near Clifton Forge, and if so, and you do not hear that Averell is coming in this direction, you had better go to Callaghan's by the way of Covington, taking Imboden and getting up Jackson and Echols and try and intercept Averell.
