Heie, then, upon these successive acts, from 1802 to 1820, is
the engagement of the Federal Government for a public road
1 to and through Ohio, 2 to Indiana, 3 to Illinois, and 4
to the liven Mississippi It is an engagement ofthe United
States It is an engagement for a valuable consideration,
namely, among other things., the exempusn of lands sold by the
United States from taxation, foi five jeais, imposed upon each
of those new States m the several acts for their admission into
the Union
In pursuance of this engagement, we have, in 1806 the act for
the commencement ofthe Cumberland road, which expressly
refers to the act foi constituting the State of Ohio , as do later
appropriations, for instance, those of 1825, 1826, and 1827, to
the several acts of Indiana, Illirois and Missouri, thus recog
msmg the engagement for this ¡oadio and through the States
cf O no, Indiana, and Illinois It is a compact, possessing all
the paits arid conditions of a contract, binthng in strict law as
between private individuals and binding tn honor and good
faith between political communities
The gentleman from Kentucky [Mr Underwood] «peaks of
it as an "exploded compact This expression, I confess,
struck me with surprise Hoy, "exploded?" Is it rot a good
and valid bargain for ample cons deration on both sides'7
TMr Underwood explained, that he did not mean to denv
the euetence of the compact, but that the conditio is of it were
exhausted, that it had been fulfil'ed on the part of the United
States ]
Well, then it is a compací and, it roust be admi"edalsa a
con pact onerous lo thp State immediately concerned, but ful
filled and exhausted so far as regards the United States How
so"i Because the two per centum on the sales of the public
lands with n those States, conditioned toberesened to the Urn-
ted States f r this object both present and piospective, has
betn already expended    Let ui examine this point
In the first place, the three per centum assigned to the States
themselves, has that been used by them in good faith accord
ins: to the compact? We have no official returns it is tiue, to
prove this, (Exec Doc 2íth Conines, 21 sess No 61 ) but I
have been assured, by Repiesenta'ives from those St ites that
the money has been invested in a pi oper manner, and indeed,
much more morey foi the same objects And mortover that
the public loads m those States hive been conducted in refe
rence to, md upon the basis of, tins sreat avenue fiom the \t
I a íi 11   to the Mississippi
feecond y as to the two per centum This, we are told, has
been expended and therefore the woik is to stop But i& not
bi« a vei y narrow construction of the compact? A construe
non according to the lettei which killeth, not according to the
spirit wh'ch maketh whole"* A construction, fit rather for a
uFiirei's bond, than fora stipulation ol mutual honor between
great communities'* And if we come down to ciuse and hferai
readings ofthe compact, is it the true consttuction'* The Um
u 3 States explicitly agieed to reserve two per centum of its
receipts fiomthesaíes o! public lands in Ohio, Indiana Illinois,
and Missoun,for the construction of a national road leading fi om
the waters of the Atlantic to and through the States of Ohio,
Indiana, and Illinois, the construction ol the roadts impliedly,
if not explicitlj, apart of the contract it has been so under
stood by the other parties to the compact, and if the per cent
age expressly reserved foi the object, be not enough good
fai h, it seems to me, requires that the irfans shall be provided
otherwise
If this weredoubtfui in the words of the compact, it would
seem to be íendered certain by other considerations I hive
argued hi'herto, as if the f ur States referred to weie the only
pames to the compact liy name theyare But, meanwhile,
what is the practical fact? The Federal Government is the
gieatestlandholder m the United States Ithas a vast public
dompin for sale and settlement I . has held out inducements to
&e tiers to buy its lands, amonff which inducements has been
the understanding, fo«nded on thir'y vears of legislation, that
the road is to he completed, and morethan a million >es, ¡han
two millions, of souls, have planted themselves m the West
opening the forest, building uptowns constructing avenues of
Intel lor communication, upon the faith and trust that the Fede
ral Government will comply withits engagements in thi« mat
ter, according to their spirit and beneficial intent, and wish a
liberality becoming the national chai ¡ctrr
Are gentlemen satisfied wi h this view ofthe subject? If no*,
then theie i  ano'her view of if, broader truer, which I desire
to present to the Houbp Hitherto I have argued it as a que=
non of dollars and cents., upon the land system ef the Uni'ed
States but that, as before intima ed, I consider a vei v superfi
cia! way of treating it and I wi'di to go beyond and below this.
¡nto what la the root ofthe maitet. namelv the policy or the
Tedeial Government, that is to say of the Atlantic Stafes, to
wards the younger States grow irgiipm the ral'ey of the Mis
sissippi
T irouKhout the proceedings op this bill I have been s ruck
by diespect icle of so man> votes and so many arguments, and
tho e ursed with so much zeal and ability, arrayed against the
measuie from two of the ^'ates on the Mississipp! and still
more in lefiectmg that the greatei pait ofthese arguments are
considera ions oflocttl interest Kentucky and Tennessee ex
hibitme to the Atlant c Strtes the weak points m the parental
policy hi herto pnistied bv the Federal Government towids
the valley of the Mississippi' T eating this question asaques
tion of iníerpí/, which the two gentlemen from Kentucky have
done, is not this a most suicidal course of argument'1 Is not the
river Ohio the common patrimony of the States of Ohio and
Kentucky alike? Giving prosperity to the valley of the Ohio,
do you not give prosperity to tf*e State of Kentucky  And
though a particular appropriation be moie directVy for the be*
nefitofOhio or Indiana than of Kentucky, yet can it be good
policy for Kentucky, m the consideration of general profit and
loss, t s exert herself to thrust away the parental hand of the Fe-
deral Government, once and forever, from the entire vaHey of
the Ohio and Mississippi? It is not the first time I have observ-
ed the same erra I can point to important works, of Un-
doubted constitu tionahtj, needful to be adopted (or the genera!
well being of all the Mississippi States, which have peen lost,
year after year, not by opposing votes of the Atlantic States,
but by short-sighted dissensions among the Mississippi States
themselves as tn the proper locality of (hose works And I re-
call to mind that, in the last Congress, a tnost honorable and es-
timable gentleman fiom Kentucky, not now a member of the
House, [Mi C Al-LAN j applied to the school fund of the West
ern States the same couise of objection which is now urged
against the Cumbeiland road Indeed, the school reservations
and the road reservations are parts of the same system of poli-
cy And the local objections to such reservations, on the part
of Kentucky and Tennessee. <tpiing-out ofthe fact, as it occurs
to me, that Kentucky and Tennessee, though Mississippi States,
yet were not constituted out of the public domain ofthe Federal
Government At any rate, this is the origin, and the only
cause, lhat I know, ofthe inequality, as respects those States,
ofthe appropriations made by Congiess It is not inequality,
as between the entire East and the entire West, but inequality,
as between the States of Kentucky and Tennessee and the other
States of the "Mississippi
In order to explain distinctly the ideas I entertain on this
point, I must ask the House to go with me mto some few his
ton cal details
On the 1st of March, 1784, Congress accepted the deed of ces-
sion by the State of Virginia of all the right of that Staie to the
teiritoiy northwestward of the river Ohio, by which, m con-
nection with the deeds of cession of Massachusetts. Con-
necticut, and New York, and in virtue, furthei, ofthe treaty
of peace, that territory became the doma n of the Con
fede racy
Immediately after this. Mr Jtfferson of Virginia, Mr Samuel
Chase of Maryland, and Mr Howell oí Rhode Island, wete ap-
pointed a committee to report a plan for the temporary govern-
ment ofthe Western Territory, as it was then called On the
23 J of April, 1784, their lepatt after amendment, was adopted,
in the form of a resolution, which pi ovided for the future di-
vision of the Territory into States, that it should ever remain a
part of the United States, that the inhabitants of it should never
lnterefere with the pi imary disposal ofthe soil by Congress, nor
tax the ¡ande of the United States, and that the States, to be
formed m it, should have Republican forms of Government.
As originally reported, the resolution also contained a rnohibt-
tion of slavery, which wasstruclc out, and the resolution was
then passed, by the vote of all the States present, except South
Carolina
On the 20ih of Mj}  17P5, Congiess adopted an oidmance for
ascertaining the mode of disposmgof the lands in the Western
Territory which ordinance in addition to the fact that it sys
lematized the surveys and ilea by parcelling out the land into
townships each of six miles qtMie, t ivided into thirty six sec
lit ns of 640 aeree each, on meridian lines, and thus save per-
lect certainty to land grants within the Terntory, also pro
vided that there should be received the lof "No 16 m
eveiy township foi the maintenance of public schools withtn
the same *
Nextfollowed the celebrated and memorable ordinance of
the 13th of July, 17b7, reported by Messrs Carnngton Dane,
R H Lee, Kean, and Smith, which developed and j>erfected the
ideas of Congiess, for the permanent regulation ofthe territory
ofthe Uni'ed States noithwestward ofthe river Ohio Thisor*
dinance, it will be remembered, provides for the descent of
lands m the terntory, it establishes a territorial administration;
it secures to the inhabitants freedom of religion, trial by jury,
the in viability ofcontracts, religious, moral, and intellectual
instruction, and the absence of involuntary servitude, and it
marks out the future relalions of the territory and its inhabitants
to the United States As a part of the United btates, and mse
parable therefrom, it was made subject to be divided into not
less than three nor mote than five Republican States; us navi
gdble rivers being made free, forever, to the whole country
and its inhabitants being forbidden to tax the domain of the
United States, or to interfere with die primary disposal of the
same by Congress
1 his ordinance, adopted by the unanimous vote of the States
represented m Congress, and with but a single dissenting voice
from any State, is the basis of the institutions of the States of
Ohio Indiana, Illinois, and Michigan, and ofthe Terntory of
Wisconsin In fulfilment ofitb provisions and of those of the
two previous ordimnces on the same general subject weie
framed the acts for the admission of Ohio, Indiana and Illinois
into the Union, containing, among other things, the reciprocal
stipulations for public schools and roads en the one s de, and
the immunity oi the pi b^icdomam from taxation on the other
side A.nd the actso* the Pith and23def June,38 6 forthead
mission of ihe State of Michigan into the Union recognise the
same principles
IS or is this ail 1 he United States, by acquisition from the
Indian*, cession from Ger g a, and otherwise, ha\me become
propi etor of the territory now occupied by the States of Missis-
sippi and Vlabama, did, by the acts of the 7th of April, 1798,
the 3d of March, 1S03, and the 20th of April, ItlS, af ply to that
tract of country the principles of the ordmam es of 1785 and of
1787, except m the particular of slavery, in conformity with
which, the act of the 1st of March, 1817, for the admission of
Mississippi into tho Union, and that ofthe 2d oi March, Í8ÍS, for
the admission of Alabama, contain stipulations correepoadW,
m their geiieial tenor, to the compact m the acts for the admis-
sion of Ohio and the othei 3\orthwe& ern States
* As reported by the committee, this oi diuance contained the
following clause, inserted, it is believed, at the instance of Mr
llufus Kins-, of Massachusetts,, who was a member of the com-
mittee, vi? "There shall be reserved the central section of eve-
iy township, for the maintenance of public*schools, and the
ection immediately adjoining the same to the noubwaru, for
the support of religion The profits arising therefrom, in both
instances, to be applied forever according to the will of the ma-
jority of male residents of full age withm ihe same  
This clause, after various proceedings in relation thereto, was
amended* and, on the final vote adopting the ordinance, 20th
May, 1785, stood as follows "There shall be reserved the lot
No 16 oí «very township for tbe mamíenance ofpubüe & hoois
within the eaicf township."
