resources for the establishment, with the exception
of such appropriations as Congiess have made
fiom time to time, to aid in erecunga id furnishing
buildings These last appiopnations bavp been
made but seldom, and have, within ten yeats,
amounted toasm which would be on an average,
about$22,150annually,andfoi thesimepurposes,
during that period, the fund has furnished, from
its annual increase and foimer accumulations,
about $45,000 annually Should Congress grant
what is now"asl¡ed, more will probably not be
wanted for many years In immediate connection
wi'h the yards, hospitals, and other real estate be-
longing to our naval establishment, is the live oak
plantation Being situated only seven miles from
our most southei n yard, it has the past yeai been
placed under the same general superintendence
The purchase of the land, and the cutting and re
irioval of the underwood and common timber from
about 200 acres of the plantation, had been accom-
plished before the chaige of this Department was
placed in my hands It seemed to me judicious
in that state of things to attempt to preserve any
benefits already attained, or fairly anticipated, by
* continuing to destroy a few years longer the an-
nual giowth of other wood injurious to the young
live oak trees, to trim and train the thriftiest new
ones appearing, and to employ merely the leisure
of the hands so engaged in extending this process
to more of the land From 200acies of land, and
22,000 live oak trees to which, in 1829, the above
system had been applied, it has, since 1831, been
so continued and extended, that the nursery has
become enlarged to 225 acres, and includes over
60,000 trees The expense attending this has been
about $1,200 a yeai, but should any considerable
poition of the trees ever reach maturity, and attain
u. size suitable for ship building, the Government
will be amply repaid As the trees glow larger,
the annual expense concerning the same number
will i apidly diminish Doubts exist whether some
of them, from the poveity of thesoil,and their ap-
paiently dwarfish charactei, will ever attain a val-
, liable size But it is now too eaily foi forming a
decisive opinion on the extent to which the opera-
tion of these causes may affect the whole planta
Hon, and, under existing circumstances, sound
policy appears to require that the experiment, hav-
ing gone so far, should be allowed a further and full
tiial. The neamess of the plantation to the Pen-
sacola yard, and to water transportation, enhances
much the value of any timbei it may produce
Lately I have not only placed this land under the
superintendence of the commander of that yard,
but íequired his particular and constant vigilance
over the live-oak reservations in all that region of
country The whole agencies heietofore connected
with our live oak have, as before suggested, been
discontinued, all the districts,exceptsmalI portions
of two, having been explored as fully as is deemed
useful till the suiveys of the land into townships
and sections shall be completed Past as they may
be completed, arrangements have been made for
additional reservations of public land on which
live-oak has been ascertained to abound, and the
prospect of a sufficient supply of that kind of tim-
ber in future is flattering, it that on private lands,
as these aie wanted to be cleated foi cultivation,
be fiom time to time purchased at moderate prices,
and placed in depot for the ñames of vessels spe-
cially authorized, or collected under the head of
gradual improvement On this whole subject I
have so recently, at such length, submitted to Con-
gress the views of this Deraitment, that further
observations here are not deemed necessary [See
report on live oak to the House of Representatives
December 14, 1822 )
Some miscellaneous matters connected with the
Navy deseivesa bnef notice The usual attention
has been bestowed on the suppression of the slave
trade The colony of Liberia has been visited by
the schoonei Porpoise while in pursuit of a pirat
ical vessel, and which vessel, it is gratifying to add,
is supposed to have been since captured by a Brit
ish brig, and her cnminal car er terminated, near
the Island of St Thomas, on the coast of Africa
One)iaif of the usual appropimtion on «he sub]ect
of the slave trade will probably be sufficient for the
ensuing year, as may be seen by the state of the
account beiewith submitted
The renewal of an appropriation for the relief
of Alexander Clapton, made m May, 1830, has
become necessary, in consequence of its having
been transfeired to the surplus fund before all the
1 ersons entitled to it weie able to procure the
nects^aiv voucheis
The proceeding  of the boaid, appointed undei
a resoluuon of Congress, to revise die naval regu-
lations., will be soon submitted in a separate le-
port
1 he survey of our sea coast having been placed
n charge of the Treasuiy Depaitm<mt, it is not in
my power, officially, to state us progress, but
officeis have been detailed, and all available facili-
ties provided, whenevei the wishes of those su-
perintending the subject have been communica-
ted
Some expenses, u"dei the cont'ngentappropna
tion foi enumeiated objects, have not been included
under any of the amounts already mentioned, but
they belorg to courts maitial, to pilotage of ves-
sels, to tnnspoitauonof matenals, to thepurchase
of charts and books, and various other small items,
forming an aggregate of about $80,000
On a review of the whole affairs of this Depait-
ment it appeals that its expenditures on all naval
subjects the past yeai have been somewhat less
than four millions of dollars It will be seen how
this result compares with foimer penods by ad-
vening to the fact that, durm? the last twenty
years, these expenditures, except during five years
of that time, have nevei fallen so low as tnree mil-
lions, and, except during six years of that time,
have nevei exceeded four millions
The whole estimates made the past year for the
general wants of what is technically considered the
Navy, were only 43 176,766 Those for the year
previous were $3,2¿7,383 Those for the present
year are $3,292,224 (S, 1 to 8 ) But it is to be
remembered that, under the head of naval expend-
itures, besides what is paid from the amount voted
on the annual naval estimates, it is customary to
class what is paid from half a million aDpropna'ed
for a term of years to gradual improvement, al-
most $200,000 for the marine corps, the pay-
ments Iron} the navy pension, hospital, and pri-
vateer pension funds, and several miscellaneous
sums voted by Congress on motions, resolutions,
and petitions, and pait of which sums, though
charged under this head, have little or no concern
with our naval establishment On the contrary,
some of the expenses connected with the admims-
tiation of the Departmental this place are included
in the general appiopnation bills for the support
of Government, and are not usually classed under
the head of naval exoendituies
It is a high gratification to be able to state that,
since 1827, nearly half a million a year has been
disbursed for giadual impiovement, that within
ten yeaisalai^er number than formerly of seamen
and officeis, with increased pay for four classes of
the latter, have been maintained, very great and
valuable improvements, besides the dry-docks,
have been begun and accomplished atmanj of the
yards, and our foiee in commission considerably
augmented, and yet that all our ordinary naval
expenditures are,and probably can be, kept withm
four millions of dollars annually
The smaller appropriations originally made for
the Navy served to maintain the few officers and
seamen then employed, and supplied us with sev-
eral fine vessels, four of which are still in exist-
ence The subsequent appropriations on a more
extended scale, besides supporting the current
expenses of our force in its infancy, furnished the
purchase money for most of our present yards,
and defrayed the expenses of our brilliant hostili-
ties with France, and afterwards with Tripoli, till,
a few years of comparative inactivity having en
sued, the commencement and progress of the last
war with England led to a great addition to the
naval establishment, and to expenditures much
larger than at present The liberal appropriations
that were continued for some years after that war
aided in laying a good foundation foi the gradual
increase of the Navy, and helped to build not only
many of the vessels now in commission and or-
dinary, but most of those upon the stocks The
appiopnations for some years past have been sim-
ilar in amount, and have enabled the Department
to enlarge us policy and widen the sphere of its
operations Besides building some additional ves-
sels, and defraying all the cuirent expenses of an
increased force, both personal and material, it has
been able to ei ect hospitals, to construct di y docks,
to impiove greatly the old yards, to add and main-
tain a new one on oui siuihan front er, and to
collect in depot a large amount of valuable scores
as a part of the due preparation in peace for the
various contingencies of war With a caieful
regard to system and economy, and with s'rict
accountability in agents and officers, this policy
can long be pursue I and extended withou' making
theordinary annual demands for this branch of the
service often exceed foui millions, and if, without
essential changes by Congress incieasing our
present expenses, and without any unforeseen
and extraordinaiy wank, our fiscal operations
enn usually be confined within that amount yeai ly,
it is confidently hoped the naval establishment will
not be considered wasteful or burdensome beyond
its benefits to the countiy
In disbursing between three and four millions
the past year it is not known that a single instance
of any loss has occurred
The balances on hand unexpended are about
$1,400,000, but most of them will probably be
wanted to ciose the different accounts on all the
d ffeient subjects when finally adjusted
Connected with our financial concerns is one
other circumstance of urgent importance The
period of time at which the annual appropriations
for this branch of the service are usually made is
a source of great inconvenience and injury
The estimates and appropna'ions are known
generally not to extend beyond the current year
Consequently, it happens that after the 1st of Jan-
uary, there is nothing on hand under some heads
to meet the daily demands of the service, amount-
ing, on an average, to $10,000 per day, unless a
new appiopnation has been made, or there hap-
pens to be some balances of the foimer year not
called for Under some heads such balances al-
ways exist, because some disbursements, by means
of absence, distance, and other causes, are not
completed within the year But they seldom exist
undei other important heads, and ought not to, if
the accounts are seasonably sealed, and the esti-
mates were accurate, and the appropriations, as is
usual, conform to the estimates The power now
vested in the President to transfer a balance from
one appiopnation to another, is confined to certain
classes of claims small in amount, and hence, as
to ail others, no transfer can legally be made, and
if no balance lemain at the end of the year, and
the new naval appropimtion bills have not passed,
payment is entirely stopped, oi the whole opera-
tions of this Department dependent on them aie
suspended Considering how laigea pait of these
operations and of our expenditures necessarily
takes place in distant quarters of the world, rt will
be seen that the embarrassment in this branch of
the service must often be peculiar and aggravated
In the case of bills of exchange diawn abroad
chargeable to appropriations already exhausted,
the public faith, under the above circumstances, is
sometimes in danger of being violated, our cred't
in foieign countries becomes mjuied, and the
Treasury, as actually happened during the last
winter, is exposed to large losses if the holders
choose to resort to protests and claims for the
meicantile rate of damages
Undei the present system of passing so late the
naval appropriation bills, it happens that, unless
money voted under one head is without authority
as was once the practice applied under other heads,
this unfortunate condition continues evei y short
session of Congress about two months, and every
long session about four months It can easily be
remedied in two methods one of them is to make,
previous to the 1st of January, new anpropuations
for a quarter or half of the yeai towards all perma-
nent objects By limiting them to such a time and
to such objects, and by taking the estimates of the
former year as a guide, no inconvenience will in-
terpose, and no en or can occur which may not be
readily corrected when the resid ue of the appropi la-
tions for the whole year is voted at a later period
in the session. Another mode is to authorize the
Piesident to make necessary transfers fiom one
head to another, in all cases where the new naval
appropriation bi'ls do not pass by the commence-
ment of the year, and to require from him a report
to Congress of the amount and causes of such
transfers If the authority be thus restricted, it is
difficult to discover any danger likely to result from
