CAVALRY BUREAU, OFFICE OF SPECIAL INSPECTOR, MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,

Louisville, Ky., February 16, 1865.

Major General J. H., WILSON,

Commanding Cavalry Corps. Miss. Div. of the Mississippi:

GENERAL: I regret exceedingly that I am not able to send by Captain Rabcock a single horse. All shipments of horses to this point ceased on the 20th of January. When shipments are to be resumed I am not advised. I presume as soon as General Canby is supplied I will again receive horses for your corps. You may, however, rest assured that all will be done within my power. The following dispatch is from Major-General Thomas:

How many horses can you furnish to Major-General Stoneman immediately? I would like for him to get as many as can possibly be given him. You will of course be compelled to stop all issues of horses to Major-General Wilson to do this.

Even if horses could be had at present, you see that they are to go to General Stoneman. However, I shall supply General Stoneman, I hope, in twenty days, and after that shall do all I can to supply your wants.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. P. CHAMBLISS,

Major and Special Inspector of Cavalry, Mil. Div. of the Miss.
HDQRS. CAVALRY CORPS, MIL. DIV. OF THE MISSISSIPPI,Gravelly Springs, Ala., February 16, 1865.

Special orders, &amp;c., will be sent direct to Find Division headquarters.

All orders involving movement of troops will be sent to you. In appointing you to this command the brevet major general commanding looks to you for the safety of the post. Citizens will not be permitted to enter your lines.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
