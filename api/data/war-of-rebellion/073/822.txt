HEADQUARTERS SECOND CAVALRY DIVISION,In the Field, Near Kenesaw Mountain, Ga., June 21, 1864.

Respectfully forwarded.

Colonel long had one regiment on picket guarding the crossing of Noonday Creek on the Bell's Ferry road, and two regiments dismounted to meet any emergency. The fight lasted until after dark. From all information received it is just to conclude that the loss of the enemy was very severe, and that two divisionis attacked me, supported by other troops.

K. GARRARD,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
