understood they had three. The part of the lines occupied by Evans' brigade is where they approach the nearest to ours, and where firing has taken place every evening of late. It was understood that General Early had closely invested Washington and that re-enforcements were to be sent him. Informants think that none have yet been sent, nor can they imagine where they can be taken from. Their officers say not a man can be spared from here. They had not heard from Early lately. Did not know of his retreat. It was generally understood that the object of Early's movement was to compel us to send enough of our force away to enable them to open and defend the Weldon railroad. The men are getting weary of life in the trenches, and are complaining considerably of late.

The men are both intelligent, and their statements in the main corroborate those made by the other five from the same regiment that came in this a.m.
