APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
35th CoNG...!st Sess,
■Postponement of fourth instalment—Mr. Mercer.
the last quarter, by averaging the monthly expendí
tares of the past year, which, on the submission of
his first estimate, he made two millions and a half
Why his second estimate extends this average to
three millions, I am not apprized , but he cannot
consistently extend the average fori he three months
gt the last quarter as he proposed in both estimates,
by adding one million six hundredthousand dollars
for the continuation of the Florida war, since four
million and a hali of the expenses of the thtee first
quarters are asenbable to the prosecution of this
very war, and, consequently, meluded in the aggre-
gate from which his monthly average is deduced
On the principle upon which his estimate is made,
the sixteen hundred thousand dollars now called for,
if td be expended m the ensuing quarter, should be
deducted from his monthly average Such a de
auction would make the total expenses of the last
quarter, exclusive of this new appropriation, ac-
cordingtohis former estimate, less than six millions,
exclusive of his dlrtim of a million for the Mint,
and a surplus of four millions for contingencies
It would be impossible to fortify the conclusion at
■which I have arrived, that the sum required for the
residue ef the year will not exceed seven millions
and a half, by recurring to the actual expenses
of the corresponding quarter of prior years, when
no disorder of the currency 01 prostration of the
industry of the country required a reduction of the
public expenditure, and every incentive which the
tíeciétary of the Treasury, the organ of the Exec
tiihre, could offer for it  augmentation, was sup-
plied by the Unvarying tenor of all his reports,
down to that of the 5th of this month
Discarding the worsf than useless provision of
one million for the Mint, the unpreedeiited and ab-
surd retention of fourmilhon for contingencies, al
lowing three hundred thousand dollars for the extra
session of Congress, and assuming, in other respects,
the corrected estimate of the chairman of the Com
mittee of Ways and Means, the aggregate of all
the expenses of the ensuing quarter will amount to
less than eight million of dollar*, exclusive of the
fourth instalment due to the States under the depo-
site act of June, 1836
To provide these eight million,! propose to with
draw three fourths of a million, now deposited in
the Mint, leaving a small sum to purchase copper
bullion, and permitting the coinage of gold and
silver to proceed as m the year 1835, but without
taxing it, as the Secretary recommende I in his an-
nual leport of 1834 (d)
I propose, moreover, to pay to the na\ > pension
fund that portion onlv ot the first msta! nent due
from the Bank of the United States, to which it is
justly entitled, applying the residue of that instil
ment to meet the public exigencies In further aid
of thee sums, for other and higher considerations,
which I shall hereafter take occasion to explain, I
propose to raise, by a sale and transfer of the three
remaining bonds of that bank, the further sum of
five million nine hundred and eighteen thousand
and thirty-three dollars—their par value on the 3d
of Octoher next, after deducting fi om them the re-
maining interest of the navy pension lund The
aggregate amount ol these specific sums, added to
the balances that may be m the hands of the collec-
tors of the customs and the receivers of the pro
ceeds of the sales cf the public lands, on the 1st of
October, would alone be more than sufficient to
provide the eight million required for the last quar-
ter of the present year
What the receiptsof that quarter may amount to,
including repayments by disbursing officers and
agents, it is impossible now to predict nor do the
Treasury reports affoid am certa n guide by which
to ascertain them Hitherto, the actual revenue of
the year has, in every brancn of it except the cus
toms, exceeded the Treasury estimates ot the 5th of
December last That from the sales cl public lands,
during the firs' half of the \ ear, surpassed, by near
half a million, the estimate J receipts- ioi the whole
year The chaiiman of the Committee of Wavs
and Means computes the revenue from this source,
for the last quarter, at amillion,which would make
the total excess for the year very nnar SI 900 000 (e)
The estimated ie<-eipts fiom the customs, m the
last annual report of the Treasury Depai tment ex-
ceeded by amillion and a quarter, the corresponding
estimate for the vear next preceding The actual
receipts under this head, for the first two quaiters
have been $7,234 451, those for the two last quarters
vy ill doubtless fall short of that sum, though no fur-
ther indulgence be granted on the custom house
bonds due, or to become due in the course of the
year, and if indulgence be granted, the magnitude
of the sum to bs received will depend on the extent
of that indulgence
The receipts from miscellaneous sources have
already exceeded their estimate foi the whole year,
and, restoring to the Treasury the sum improperly
paid to the navy persion fund, the actual revenue
from all other sources thdn the customs, will be
found, by the expira'ion of the j ear, to hav e ex
ceeded the estimates by two million^ at least
A passing observatioi is here due to the pro
phetie sagacity, claimed by the Secretary of the
Tieasury in his report of the 5'h instan , it is that,
however ' reluctant" he may have been to estimate
the receipts lor 1837 " at o ^twenty four millions,'
he did not ad\ ert to the fact that iVs es'imate ac
tually exceeded that which he gave us of the rev e
nue oí the vei y prosperous year next preceding by
four millions and a half the estimateof December,
1835, of the revenue of the following year, having
been but $19,750,000, and the part of it anticipated
from the customs but fifteen millions and a quarter
The receipts of that jear, wc may remember,
amounted to fifty millions
I shall be excused, I trust, after a careful consid-
eration of a series of Treasury reports, so replete
with error and so marked by every species of in-
consistency of fact and argument, if 1 allow their
author the power oí expanding and contracting his
estimates, to suit every political emergency of the
party with which he has so zealously co opeiated
Amidst all the confusion of ideas necessarily a*
tendantupoil *o arduous a duty, enough is yet appp
rent upon the face of the last reports of this officei
to manifest that, without i elying on the =ums vv hicl
may remain to his ciedit with the late deposi p
banks, on the 1st of Octobei next, resources ma  b
devised   without incurring a new public deb* to
carry on the necessary expenditures of the Gove" -
men to the end of the current year
I have purposely discarded those sums nam my
estimate of the resources of the Treasury for its
ordinaiy or current expenses, because, in truth,
they were appropriated and sat apart by posnivc
and solemn enactment of law, for a distinct purpose
To the extent of the fourth instalment of the sur
plus revenue, to be distributed on the 1st of October
next, under the act of June, 1836, all authority of
the Secretary to dispose of those sums foi any oilier
purpose, ceased on the 1st of January last
Whether, in his preparation for the execution of
that act by transferring those deposites vv bach it
directed him to ascertain and to set apaitforthe
States, the Secretary has transcended or omitted lo
exeicise his lawful authority, is not, now, a ques-
tion before this committee Nor is it material to
that which we have to decide, whether those de
posites be available or not They are to become,
on the 1st of October next, to t le full extent of the
sum of $9,367,214 98 the limited property of the
several States, according to their respective propor-
tions, and under the expiess conditions set forth in
the deposite act of June 1836 which s;av e to the
Secietary of the Treasury no other power than to
obey its mandates                                           ___
If he has rendered such obedience impiactieab'e,
if he has reduced the amount or impaired the
value of the surplus fund mtmsted to his care, a id
set apart by law for a special purpose, the responsi-
bility rests with him
It cannot be doubted how ever that those ^tates
whose banks are depositories of this fund will
cheerfifly accept for then remaining share of it,
the drafts of the Treasury on fhosel anks forwlo e

the passage of the bill fum. the Senate, for the m-
defimte postponement of the fourth instalment
Are there, Mr Chairman anv other adequate
grounds for i he passage of such a bill"! Will its
passage involve a violation of the public faith to-
wards the se veral States i
Mr Chan man, said Mr M , had an intelligent
stranger lis.tr ned only to the various and contradic-
tory arguments of the advocates of this bill, I would
cheerfully abide by his decision upon its merits.
The argumentnm adat/mrdumis a legitimate mode
of leasomng and as applicable to the development
of moral an 1 political, as of physical science
One gentleman has contended that the deposite
act, which t' is bill proposes to repeal m part, was
unconstitutional, and therefore not obligatory , al-
though he admits that more than twenty-seven mil-
lions of the public money hav e passed under its
provisions from the Federal Government to the
States, who have unanimously agi eed to receive,
and plighted their faith, on certain conditions, to
íeturnit
Another gentleman has contended that no legisla-
ture can bind its successors, and, thei efore, the act
of 1836 is repealable at pleasuie
A third insisted that the deposite act does not
pledge the faith of this Government to the fulfil-
ment of its stipulations, because thev do not amount,
in terms, to a contract, oí, asa fourth has argued, if
acontiact, it is a nudum,pactum, or without an ade
quate consideiation

0¡ e ge nlcinan, after vindicating his vote for
the acf of June, 1836, against the very unmerited
attack upon it, of one of his colleagues, made
quite an original discovery, that the Federal and
Slate Governments are, in truth, identical, being
governments of one and the same people, and, con-
sequently, incapable of contracting with each other
Many of the advocates of the hill have, with more
truth, admitted the right ol those Governments to
cortracl, and that the act in question, if not in itself
a contiact, authonzed a contract lo be made be-
t" een the Gencial and State Governments, but
they claim for the former, a íelease of the obliga-
tion arising under it, upon the legal or equitable
grounds of mistake, unforeseen accident, or un-
avoidable necessity
I do not propose, Mr Chairman, a separate reply
fo arguments which, in general, so remarkably
serve to answer one another but shall content
myself with sifh an exposition of my own views
of the merits of this bill and such brief notice of
the y lews of others, as may excuse me from yield-
ing assen1 to a measure inconsistent wi'h the faith
of this Government and calculated to inflict a
deep and w anton injury upon the States of this
Union
I most readily concede to the honorable gentle-
man from Vngima (Mr Tones) who rose early
m thisdeb"te, that the act of 1836 is to be constru-
ed not as a penal statute strictly, but liberallv ,
according to its obvious intent and meaning I
canno , bow ever infer that mtent from its title
alone, noi anVm as two of m> colleagues have
dee (Mr Jones and Mr Garland,) that it is not a
distnbj 'on act meielv because it is railed an act
111egul *e die de losit s of the public money
It i in tmth as its context discloses both a de-
j mile and a dislnoutwn act since it expressly pro-
vtics foi a distention of a part of the surplus
funds of the General Government among the
scveial Sates, according to a fixed ratio, tobe
neVl I v the n in deposit", and returned when called
fn af'T a pi escribed nonce, in limited propor-
t ons
Both m\ colleagues (Messis Jones and Gar-
1 > 11) h iv c contended that the right to use did not
pi wih he jwiw-iov of the deposites—the eon-
t "I i'l c

If vscl be tne sound constiuction of the act of
I83(> what motive, I would ask had the Slates, for
aecen mg, in deposite, the     i            d lUeidered
ihrmi    Why were the "ím     o tendered  pn| oi
