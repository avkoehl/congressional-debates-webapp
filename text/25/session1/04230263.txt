that this aut  ríen aiion of then real or nominal cap
ital was <te lgned by the banks to accommodate
themselves to those provisions of the depostte act,
and, accoidingly, in the same period, their deposites
to the ctedi' of the Treasurer were extended from
thirty-seven to forty-five millions., and those on be-
half of the disbursing ofheers of the same Depart
ment, irom three millions seven hundred thousand,
tj four millions one hundred thousand dollars, and
the discounts and loans of the banks fioni scenty-
one to one bundled and fifteen millions
Such, nevertheless, wao the confidence of the
Treasury in the security oí these deposites, that this
circumstance passed unheeded, and as late as his
annual report of December last, the Secretary in-
formed Corgrpss that " tlie prospect oí the curren-
cy is on the whole becoming more satisfac ovyeven
vntloutfut liter legislation "
It became the boast of the Executive Govern-
ment, as this Treasury report announce! and the
message echoed, that it had augmented the specie
in the country by forty-three millions, consisting
chiefly of gold, yet gold was scarcely anywhere vis
lble in the hands or pockets of the people contin-
uing to serve m all its uses, as the basis of a con
s antly increasing paper circulation By common
consent, the preciou-. metals constitute the standard
of value throughout the civilized woiid, but while
they impart a certain degiee of uniformity and sta
bility to the cunency of the world, they constitute,
of themselves, but an inconsiderable part of the me-
dium of exchange m any highly commercial coun-
try
The money exchanges of the city of London,
alone, were, more than thirty years ago, computed,
by a highly respectable member of Parliament,
{Henry Tuo/nton,) to amount to between four and
live millions sterling a day To these, were to be
added all the dealings of a hundred other city and
country bankers, and of a people spread over the
surface ot the greatest manufacturing country in
Christendom But when, on the 2G'h of Febiuaij ,
1797, the Bank of England was authorized to su3
pend specie paj nent , thj whale vaaie of the bul
lion in the possession of the Bank, added to the
amount of their bills discounted, was, m a state-
ment of the Bank to a Committee of the House of
Commons, lepoited to amount to about seven mil
bans In this report, the bullion of ihe Bank, cor-
responding in its uses, to our specie, is not distin-
guish^ 1 from its loans, but no computation extend
ed the former beyond a moiety of the whole
amount, or to three and a half million sterling,
which according to our present legal rate of ex-
change, was less than seventeen millions oí dolíais
The Secretary of tne Treasury, m his Icttei of
the 5th instan1", speaking of the con Ution of the de
posite banks, tells us that, as a whole, then spent
compared with then circulation averaged, in Mai
last, moie ' than one to tiuet or n as ov er the rela
tive quantity neld by all the banks in England at
the >iiie penod,' and "was, in proportion, one
fourth large/ than thai in the Bank of England "
When it is considered that of the fouileen or fif
teen hundred millions sterling of exchanges in
London, seventy private baiik«is aie paities to a
shaieol them, and when bank papel is required
which is seklom, use it alone, issuing no papel
themselves, that the} keep then gold m the vaal s
oí that bank, it may vv ell be conceiv ed how small a
portion of specie or bullion «ustatns the credit sv
tern of England The specie cunency of Prance
is, I know, computed at a much larger pi opoitional
amount, and i*s ratio is undoubtedly much greater,
though I do not belive that «equals the halt of six
hundred million of dollars, its estimated amount
It is casiei by fai, to count a people, than the mo
n«y in then pockets, aid, as I o the numbers of man
kind, we Lave only to consult Wa'lace and othei
w riters pi tor to the institution oí a íegidar census
any wheie, to perceive how loooe and uncei'am all
calculations aie
Bul.inpropoiuon tothe very small i alio of spec  ,
to bank papci, and of the s'ill smaller ratio of both,
to the actual evidence^ of debt, and insttumenN 11
exchange w hi eh suffice to sus'am 'he business of
tne wealthiest and most commeicnl countries m
the woild, is the danger resulting íro n the sudde i
reduction of the specie of such a cotniti> as England
That this consideration should not have struck
the late Executive Magistrate, in the midst of those
efforts of which he often boast"d, to increase, bv
artificial and extraordmaiy means, the specie ot the
United States at ihe expense of that of Europe and
of England, especialh, is more a subject of íegitl
than of surprise But if effect has been veiy ap-
parent The common currency is thehfeblood
of the commercial world Its circulation cannot
be impeded or accelerated greatly m one countiy
without its effects being sensible to all Not Engl
land alone, but Prance, (h) and even China, dis-
tant as that country is from us, could not but feel
the effect which the sudden addition of forty three
millions to the specie of the United States occasion-
ed upon the currency of the rest of the commercial
world
Its-operation on England we have realized in its
most disastrous, though mo=t natural and inevitable
reaction upon our cuirency—in the rum of the first
American houses m London, and the utter, though
transient, as I hope and believe, prostration of all
confidence in the commercial intercourse of two
nations w ho were gradually becoming more and
moie assimilated by interest and affection
I have earned my views, Mr Chairman, of the
causes of the present public distress, farther than I
designed, and, forbeann? other details, of its nature
and extent, return to a brief consideration oí its ap-
propriate remedy
I have said that the impediments to a íesumpüon
of specie payments are to be found in the existence
of a heavy foreign debt and the absence of confi
denee at home The specie that sustained our
paper circulation still remains torestoie its agency,
'\ e need only the íestoration of the confidenceof the
people at home, and of the creditors of our mer-
chants abroad
What should be the study of every branch of ihe
Government m sucli a crisis ' Undoubtedly to re-
stóle that confidence by every measurem its power
Let us take lessons fiom the conduct of other States
if wo are debarred by insurmountable prejudices
from availing ourselves of the natural suggestions
of our own experience Laying aside all consider
ation oí the agenev of the Bank of the United
States m preserving, and lestonns; when unsound,
the cunency of oui country, let us look to tie
couise pur-ucd, under like ciicumsiances, with
our own, by a foreign Government, not less sensi-
tive to public opinion, Lut less free than ours, a
Government with a leal not a nominal monarch at
its head, and with a Parliament, one blanch of
which is hereditaiv, and the other elected for a
peno 1 of seven yeais
The failure of the banks in the west of England,
in 1793, spread consternation throughout that an-
eient kingdom from Land's End to the Tweed
The Paihament of Engl uid assembled, not to study
the relief of the Crown, but of the people, and the
result of their measures, I will read you fiom the
author whom I have aheadv quoted and whose
vvoik has been, for several weeks, in mydiavv<r,
av siting this occasion for its use
In advertm? to the events of ihe year 1793, this
writer says, that " through the failure of many
country banksmuch general distiust took place The
alarm (the first material one of the1 ind which had
foi a long time happened) was extremely great
"Thesuccessoi the remedy which the Parliament
administered, denotes what was the nature of the
evil A loan of cxchcquei bills, was directed to
oe made to as many meicantile persons, giving
proper security, as should apply It is a fact
worthy of serious attention that the failures abated
greatly, and mercantile credit began to be restored,
not at the period when the exchequei bills were
actually delivered, but at a time antecedent to
that ei a It aKo deserves notice, that, though the
failures hadoiiginaled in an extraordinary demand
for guineas, it was not any supply of gold v\ Inch
effected the cure That fear ot not being able to
obtain guineas, which arose in the eountrj, led, m
its eonsequene es, to an extraordinary demand
for bank notes in London and the w ant ot bank
notes m Londonbecame, attei a time, the chief evil
The verv expectation of a supply of exchequer
bills, that is, of the supply of an article which al-
most ar y tnder might obtain and which it was
know n that he might then sell an 1 thus turn into
bank notes, and, after turning i.ito bank notes,
mi<*ht also conv ei t into guineas, cieated an idea of
general solvency This expectation cured, in the
first instance, the distress of London, and it then
les ened the demand foi guineas m the count! y,
tlnough that punctuality in effecting the London
payments which it produced and the universal co i-
fidence w hich it thus inspired The sum permitted
by Parliament to be advanced m excheMuer bills
was five million, of which not one half was taken 0f wonomnwh
of the sum taken, no part w as lost, e% the contrary, J] lie

H of Reps,
the s.mall compensation or4extra interest v#hréh was
paid to Government for Knifing its creuil.Tfor It
was mere credit, and not eithtr money or bank-
notes that the Government advanced,) amounted to
something more than was necessary to cdefray the
charges, and a small balance of profit accrued to
the public For this seasonable interference, (a
meas le at first not well understood, and opposed
at the time chiefly on the ground of consatmional
jealousy,) the mercantile as well as manufacturing
mteiests oí the county were certainly much in-
debted to the Parliament and to the Government +"
Undei very difieient circumstances, when the
Bank of England was threatened, as was generally
believ ed, with embarrassment from various causes
oceuirmg during the continental war of 1797, the"
British Parliament interposed for its relief, bfau-
thonzmg a suspension of its issues of gold and sil
ver Instead of dispensing with the use of its notes
which might have been expected to sink in the
money market below par, the suspending act au
thonzed the private bankers to issue them m lieu w
the precious metals, and made them a legal tundci
in all pecuniary transactions within the kingdom
The consequence was, that, although ihe war
continued four years longer, and with such disas
trous consequences to the allies of England, the
danger which threatened the bank blew over, and,
althougn two millions of small notes were issued
under the anthontyof the same act, to supply the
place of gold and silver com in the smaller deal-
ings of society, both metals mingled m the dailj
currency with specie, at par value
It was not till three years after the revival of the
war with France, following the shoit peace ot
Amiens, oi nine yeai s from the date of the suspend
mg act that any public notice was taken of the de
preciauon of bank paper, which the policy of Na-
poleon occasioned, by rtei angmg the commerce ot
Ergland with the continental nationseontiolled b\
his councils and his arms.
This interposition of parliament to piotcct the
banir, unnecessary as it for a long time proved 10
b°, has been imputed wholly to the connexion sub
sistmg between the bank and the Government
The writei, to whose treatise I have befóte ic-
ferred, demonstrably shows that this supposition is
w ithout foundation The entire capital of the bank
it is Hue, was vested then, as now, in three peí
cent Government stocks to the amount of more than
eleven million and a half
But this investment was made and continued for
the b nefit ol the bank itself, since the stock was ai
all limes convertible into specie andproluted i
profit lint mere million oi specie could not yieid
while the Government annually negotiated with
the private bankets of the kingdom loans to the e\
tent of thrice the capital of the bank, in or lei to
supply the means of prostcu'mg airoliactcd mil
perilous naval and <o'ltinental war
In one interest, indeed, the bank and the Govern
ment, as well as the people of England wei p most
irtimately allied—in preseivmg public and t r \" i
