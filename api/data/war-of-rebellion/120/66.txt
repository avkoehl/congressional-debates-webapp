Surg. J. SIMPSON, Medical Director, Baltimore, Md.:

SIR: By authority of the Secretary of War I have respectfully to request you will direct the transfer to Point Lookout of the sick and wounded prisoners of war at the West Buildings Hospital who are well enough for the journey but will probably not soon be in a condition for service. Please apply to Major-General Wallace, commanding the department, for a suitable guard and the necessary transportation. Those who remain at the hospital should, if possible, be sent to Fort McHenry. Send a list with those transferred and a copy to this office.

GENERAL ORDERS, HDQRS. SAINT MARY'S DISTRICT, Numbers 10. Point Lookout, Md., April 18, 1864.

I. The general commanding has been surprised to observe the negligence of sentinels while posted and their remissness in discharging duty. It is presumed that no officer of sufficient intelligence to be permitted to remain in the service can be unaware of the importance of properly instructing sentinels and enforcing all the requirements of the service relating to the performance of guard duty as prescribed in Revised Regulations, paragraphs 375 to 431 and 573 to 592.

II. Challenges will commence with guards an hour after "retreat," and each sentinel will be visited by a non-commissioned officer of the guard between retreat and challenge.
