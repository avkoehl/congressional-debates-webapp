THEO. COX,

Major and Assistant Adjutant-General.

FAISON'S STATION, April 5, 1865.

Major-General SCHOFIELD:

I get frequent reports of the appearance of squads of Wheeler's cavalry down the railroad. A number of my men have been killed and others captured. As I have no cavalry I am unable to do much to clean them out. I respectfully suggest that out cavalry drive them off before the road is left to the small guard which General Hawley will have to do it with.

Let General Hawley delay sending troops up the road until he can bring up some of his garrisons from Fisher and Caswell. Your concentration will not have to be made as soon as was supposed. Sunday will be early enough.
