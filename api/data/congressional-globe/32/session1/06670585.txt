1852.
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

however, they computed the mileage of the repre-
sentatives from California by the overland route.
The gentlemen who were then the Representa-
tives of that State took exception to this compu-
tation, and they procured the advice of a gentle-
man, whose legal attainments I believe are second
to those of few in the nation; they obtained a
written opinion from him, and with that opinion
went to the Presiding Officer of the House. By
Ins advice—1 will not say instructions—but by
hid advice, which the committee deemed worthy
of nil respect, the committee rescinded its own
previous resolution, and permitted those gentle-
men to draw their mileage, under the lav.- of 18J8,
by the Isthmus route.
Air. ORR. I know that was the construction
given by the Committee on Mileage at the last
session, and also the construction of the present
committee. I take it for granted, however, from
the reading of the act, that that construction of
the act is incorrect, and that not only ih the Dele-
gate from Oregon entitled to his mileage over the
ovprland route to Oregon, but that the members
and Senators from California are not entitled to
charge by the Isthmus route, but that they are
restricted by this act to charge for the same route
m that traveled by the Delegate from Oregon.
Weil, it is said that this proviso expired with
the bill, at the end of the fiscal year, on the 30th
of last June. Xow, let me call the attention of
members to this fact, that at the last session of
Congress, there was attached to the civil and
diplomatic appropriation bill a proviso which pro-
vided that bounty land warrants should not be
located upon any lands but those that were sur-
veyed at that time: and what was the construction
j*iven to that? It was in the general appropriation
bill; and if the construction contended for by the
Committee on Mileage is correct, it expires also
upon the 30th of June next, and all the noise
which we have heard in this Hall in favor of repeal-
ing that proviso, which it was said had crept
clandestinely into the bill, has been unnecessary,
inasmuch as it will expire with the bill in which
it was incorporated. But it is a mistake. There
are very many permanent laws that are mcorpo
rated as sections into our general appropriation bills.
It is very often the case that things get into the ap-
propriation bills thnt ou^lit not to be there. I be-
lieve the rules of the House require that no appro-
priation shall he incorporated into <t general appro-
priation bill, unless a prior existing law provides
for it. But we all know that clauses ereip into
the appropriation bills that are not in strict con-
formity with the rules. I am no! sure that ofiices
have not been created by clauses in general appro-
priation bills, and it has never been contended be-
fore that those offices expired with the expiration
of the year for which the bill made appropriations.
it is bnjrgested to me that the law abolishing
floggimr in the Navy was also put into a general
appropriation bill. Is the construction to be put
upon that, that it expired with the fiscal yecu for
which the appropriations were made' Not at all.
ft is considered now as one of the gtner.d, bind-
ng laws of the land, and js so con^truf-d by the
whole Navy. And it is the same with refeience
to this bill,
There is some authority upon this subject. I
hold in my hand a report made by a committee of
the Senate", to whom this subject was referred m
March, 1851. Mr. Cooper, from that committee,
reported :
"TlK't they have, o.ncfullv eonMdered the provisions of
tin; aforcaid act, and ho- of opinion that -o much of the
:-une as piowdeft Mhat tin; mileage of the Senators and
Kepresemauve- from California, and the Dolr/r.ite from
Orc^m, bo i omputed and paid according to the most usual
rravelhisi nunc within the limits of the Untied States,5 is
permanent; and Mat the mileage of flit- Senator-- from the
State ot California, -bould be asceitamed and paid in pur-
suanc e of tin - pro\ won.''
That, 1 apprehend, is the ri^ht cu i.->uuuiun.
Perhaps thai < onstrue-tion lias been reversed by
the Senate, but 1 think it is the coriect construc-
tion of the o'T.
Air. STANTON, of Tennessee, (interrupting.;
I think, that, upon the very fa^e of tins act, the
construction contended for by the gentleman, from
South Carolina cannot be maintained. The pro-
vision in the deficiency bill is to this effect:
•c Provided^ Thauhe mileage of the Senators and Repre-
sentative-: from California, arid the Delegate liom Oregon.
De computed according to the most usual traveling route
within the limits of the T'riifed States ; and the per diem of
,saul Senators and Representative? for this- session shall
commence from the day on which the constitution of Cali-
fornia was first communicated to the two Houses of Con-
gress, respectively."
It applies to that appropriation alone, and the
j proviso certainly cannot, by any soit of construc- i
| tion, be made to extend to others. If it had said |
i the mileage shall hcitufUr be computed by such a !
| route, there mi£,ht be some reason for the con- :
j struction, but it is a proviso that the mileage pro- \
! vUkdfor in this deficiency bill shall be computed by j
j such a route. ;
j Mr. ORR. I had marked a clause in the civil !
I and diplomatic appropriation bill of the last ses- ;
| sion to which I w'shed to refer, but I cannot now i
lay my hand upon it. It was, however, the clause 1
i to which 1 have already adverted, providing that
1 land warrants shall not he located upon any lands \
except those surveyed at the time the bill was ,
passed. By looking at. the phraseology it will be >
found, that that proviso comes in in precisely the
same way that the proviso comes in in this de-
ficiency bill. |
But the point to which I called the attention of j
the House when I first rose, and which 1 do not
think the gentleman from Tennessee has answered,
was this: After jnoviding that the rate of mileage
shall be ascertained in a particular way, the law
then says, that the p?r dian for this session, and so
foith, showing that it was evidently the intention
of the law-makers to restrict the latter clause of j
the proviso, and that the first clause of the proviso !
was to be general in its operation.
if I am correct in the construction which I have
given to this act, then the Committee on Mileage
should have ascertained the mileage due to the \\
Delegate from the Territory of Oregon according
i to the terms of this act, aud that is by the overland '
route; and they should have ascertained the mile-
age due to the Representatives from California !
according to the same route. And if the House !
should concur witli me, that the construction which
I givt- t<  this net is the true construction, and that j,
it w a permanent and no! a temporary piovixion, \t
then a simple resolution <>f the House so constru- :
ia^ the law, is all that wiil be necessary, and di- !
! reeling the enmmitieeto reunse the decision made !
j in its construction. ;
| Air. HENDRICKS. On yesterday I was hi-
j quiied of hy the gentleman from {South C.iro- j
| lnm, [Mr. Woodwaph,] whether the ^enewd law 1
! of JfJSdid not limit the mileage of member to the j
[ amount of '.heir per diem. At that time, I suited |
very confidently tii.it no sia'h provision was to he ■
found in that law. I \\ ul now read the section of
the law. 11 is a^ follow
