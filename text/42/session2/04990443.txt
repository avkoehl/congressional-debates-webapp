APPENDIX TO THE CONGEESSIONAL GLOBE.

42d Cong....2d Sess.
The Tariff—Mr. Stevenson.
Ho. of Reps.
Insurance companies are lightly taxed, and
the remaining receipts are incidental and
small.
The taxation of non-residents and of alien
passengers seems illiberal 111 a State whose
prosperity is so largely due to national policy.
The tax on corporation stocks needs ex-
planation. We find 011 page 40 of the Aud-
itor's report that it is $15; 44 on the $1,000
of capital stock, one and one half per cent.
Is it possible that Massachusetts lays special
taxes and derives extraordinary revenues from
those manufacturing establishments which we
favor and foster by protective tariffs ? Does
she take to herself part of the bounty we give
to her people, whom she commends to us
as wards of the nation worthy our especial care ?
SAVINGS BANKS.
What is this tax on savings banks? In 1870
they paid the State $927,254 91. Theamount
estimated for 1871 was $1,080,000, making
over two millions in two years. We find on
page 41 of the Auditor's report that it is a tax
on the deposits in the savings banks levied
under acts of 1862 and 1868, three quarters
of one per cent.
Gentlemen from Massachusetts tell us they
maintain the protective system not only for
the capitalist, but for the laborer who finds
employment in protected manufactures at
wages which could not be paid without protec-
tion ; and when doubts are suggested whether
labor receives good wages or capital takes the
profits, and official State papers are quoted to
prove the destitution of operatives, we are
shown the record of the savings banks, and
told that of $163,535,943 deposits seventy-
five per cent., over $120,000,000 are earnings
of operatives.
Governor Washburn, in his address to the
Legislature, January 5, 1872, says:
" The moneys in these institutions are principally
received from the middle and laboring classes."
$*$$$ * # * ir us
"The number of savings institutions in operation
in the Commonwealth is one hundred and sixty.
Their progress and increased business derive spe-
cial interest from tbo fact that thoir deposits are
supposed to represent, for the most part, the earn-
ings of labor. As no individual is allowed by law
to deposit a larger sum than $1,000, the nitsregate
of depot-its and depositors must measurably snow
the general diffusion of wealth. Tho whole number
of depositors, according to the last report, is
560,890, while the amount of deposits is $103,535,943 ;
tho increase of depositors during tho past year was
82,093, and in the deposits it was $27,790,845."
This tends to dispel the gloom which official
reports cast over the life of the Massachusetts
wage laborer.
The aggregate of deposits is grand, yet when
compared witti other figures it dwindles.
The census returns give the wealth of Massa-
chusetts in 1870 at $2,132,148,741; $1,463,08
to each inhabitant.
Here are 500,890 depositors, (three fourths
of whom are said to be operatives;) with
$160,535,943, an average of about $291 each,
one fifth the ratio of property to people.
When we remember that many of these de-
positors have families, and many operatives
make no deposits, we must ask whether as a
class they are sufficiently paid to be above
want, whether they receive a fair proportion
of the joint profits of labor and capital.
The possession of three hundred dollars does
not remove a family, or even one person, far
from poverty at the present rates of living; and
this item of evidence, however interesting,
does not rebut the statements of the Bureau
of Statistics of Labor, in several reports, No
doubt there is excess of coloring in conclu-
sions drawn from evidence chiefly on one
side; but the statement in the report of 1871,
page 533, will hardly be questioned:
" The statistics of waites and earnings which we
have presented both in this report and that of 1870,
collected as they hnvo been from tho books of tho
employers in nearly every department of labor,
yield abundant ovidenco that the manual, or wage
laborer, is but a very short distance removed from
absolute want."
This condition of wage laborers in Massa-
chusetts is due in part to the fact that the
class is recruited from the ranks of poverty,
largely from immigrants, who land in the
country without property and begin work
penniless. From the foot of the hill their
ascent is tedious and painful. Tho first vantage
is most difficult to gain.- Hence it is not
surprising that we find the mass far down the
slope toiling slowly up. It is encouraging that
they are coming up at all. And if we extend
our view we shall see those who have gained
higher ground by industry and perseverance
rising more rapidly and passing cheerfully on
to positions of independence, becoming em-
ployers and capitalists.
All this we gladly credit, yet is there any-
thing to justify the Commonwealth of Massa-
chusetts in tnxing the savings of wage labor?
Three quarters of one per cent, per annum are
levied by Massachusetts on the deposits of her
operatives, which average less than $300 to
the depositor—an amount exempt from taxa-
tion and execution in many other Slates.
Here is a class of people but one degree above
want engaged in pursuits which the State pro-
fesses to cherish and persuades the nation to
nrotect in the name and for the interest of
labor, and which are very profitable to capital,
and yet she levies a special tax on the pittance
of these laborers, the slow distillation of their
toil accumulated by self-denial and suffering
in the hope of rising above want and wages
into independence and competence. This fund
should be sacred as the dew upon the brow of
labor.
Since Massachusetts comes to us once more
asking, through tho chairman of our Commit-
tee of Ways and Means for continued protec-
tion to her manufactures, in the name of her
operatives we may venture to say to her,
" remit to labor these unrighteous laxes; pay
back what you have taken ; readjust the scale
of division of profits between labor and capi-
tal, and then tell us what are the lowest rates
of duties you actually need for your great
industries, and we will hear you with pleasure."
Gentlemen may say that this tax of three
quarters of one per cent, per annum on the
savings of labor is lighter than what is laid
on' other property, but why should these
savings be taxed at all ? The State contains
over two billions of wealth without them.
Surely that is a basis broad enough to sup-
port the Commonwealth without oppressing
poverty.
This vast sum of two billions, nearly equal
the national debt, is largely the accumulated
profits of capital and labor employed in manu-
factures, and the share contributed by labor
is certainly sufficient to entitle it to some ex-
emption from tolls upon its limited earnings.
Behold the admirable prosperity of the man-
ufactures of New England 1 We have not
" protected" them in vain.
The following table is copied from a note to
the report of the Massachusetts bureau of
statistics of Labor for 1870. (See Senate
Keport Massachusetts, No. 120, page 111:)
"By Martin's tables the following wore the an-
nual average dividends of tho mills named, with the
highest market value of their stock during that and
their capital: Chiekopee Mill,2W percent., $420,000.
32f> on par of 4100; Morrimaok Mills, lf>i percent.,
$2,500,000, $1,700 oil par of $1,000; Midd-lcscx Mills.
2'Zj por cent., $750,000, $400 on par of $100; Naum-
keiig Mills, I'.Kt per cent., $1,500,000, $107 on a par of
'$.100; Pacific Mills, 2U per cent., $2,500,000, $3,240
011 par of SI,000; Salisbury mills, 22b por cent,,
$1,000,000, $360 011 par of 8100. -
"Tho average dividends of twenty of the principal
mills in Massachusetts for eight years last past
appear irom the same tablos to have been fifteen
and four tenths per cent."
What a grand exhibit! But as it may be
said these are exceptional establishments,
and the time covered was unusually favorable.

of " Martin's tables," which are of the highest
financial authority, showing the condition of
