GENERAL: A telegram just received from General Jones says:

General Echols has been defeated with heavy loss, and is endeavoring to retreat by Salt Pond Mountain. Enemy advancing, about 7,000 strong.

General Jones asks aid, if it can be given. I have no force to send, as General Pickett, under information of raid toward Weldon, has just moved thither with his disposable force. Can you render aid?
