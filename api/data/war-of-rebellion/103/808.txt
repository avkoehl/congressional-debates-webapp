WATERLOO, ALA., March 1, 1865.

Major E. B. BEAUMONT,

Asst. Adjt. General, Cavalry Corps, Mil. Div. of the Mississippi:

MAJOR: Colonel Coon offers to turn over to me all his Spencer guns, in view of the fact that his brigade is dismounted, and will have to go to Louisville to obtain horses, and will doubtless have no difficulty in obtaining arms also. This is Colonel Coon's voluntary suggestion, and if it meets General Hatch's approval I shall be pleased to have it done, as it seems plain to me while the First and Fifth Divisions have between them arms and horses for only one division, they should not be divided between them, but used to place one on a war footing. River not falling yet.

I am, major, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JNO. T. CROXTON,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers.

HDQRS. CAVALRY CORPS, MIL. DIV. OF THE MISSISSIPPI,Gravelly Springs, Ala., March 3, 1865.

Respectfully referred to Brigadier-General Hatch to know if he is willing that Colonel Coon part with the Spencers. They will undoubtedly add to the efficiency of the First Division. General Hatch's wishes will, however, decide the matter.

By command of Brevet Major-General Wilson:

E. B. BEAUMONT,

Major and Assistant Adjutant-General.

HEADQUARTERS FIFTH DIVISION, CAVALRY CORPS,MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,

Eastport, Miss., March 7, 1865.

Respectfully returned.

If an order can be obtained to send the command to the rear to remount, as much as I should dislike to lose the only good arm this division has, I should consent, on the receipt of that order, to turn the arms over for the good of the service.

EDWARD HATCH,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS CAVALRY CORPS,Gravelly Springs, March 1, 1865.

Brevet Major-General UPTON,

Commanding Fourth Div., Cavalry Corps, Mil. Div. of the Mississippi:

GENERAL: General Wilson desires that you will send a staff officer down to Waterloo Landing to ascertain whether it is practicable to embark the troops of your command at that place. If the steam-boat landing can be reached by wading without its being too deep, the general wishes to have the crossing commenced at once. Please send a staff officer at an early hour in the morning.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

E. B. BEAUMONT,

Major and Assistant Adjutant-General.
