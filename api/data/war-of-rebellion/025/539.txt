Provision returns should be approved at division headquarters, and requisitions for quartermaster's and ordnance stores at these general headquarters.

Morning report should be made to division headquarters; and consolidated morning reports, prepared in great detail and accuracy, made to these headquarters tri monthly.

All orders heretofore issued by General Sherman at Memphis or in the field will be considered binding on his present command, unless they conflict with those of our common superiors.
