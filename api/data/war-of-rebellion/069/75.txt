MAY 21, 1864-5.45 p. m. (Received 6.15 p. m.)

General BUTLER:

General Wild reports that Fort Powhatan has been attacked. I shall proceed thither at once with a part of the Fifth Regiment. This may be a ruse to waken our force at City Point. Will you send a gun-boat to cover our right flank at City Point on the Appomattox River. Colonel Russell, Fifth Massachusetts Cavalry, will be in command here during my absence.

E. W. HINKS,

Brigadier-General.

MAY 21, 1864.

(Received 8.45 p. m.)

COMMANDING OFFICER,

City Point, Va.:

Be careful against surprise. If the enemy attacks will probably attack at daylight, but at no hour let the command be unprepared. Be specially careful these foggy mornings. Let the troops understand that if they hold out we can have re-enforcements to them within a couple of hours; that will prevent panic. Visit your pickets personally and see that they are doing their duty.

BENJ. F. BUTLER,

Major-General, Commanding.

FORT POWHATAN, May 21, 1864-9 p. m.

Major-General BUTLER:

All quiet here. No enemy in sight. A few shots from our guns entirely scattered them. Affairs were much exaggerate by a staff officer of General Wild. Shall return to City Point as soon as I have inspected our lines. Colonel Kiddoo is the right man in the right place, and sufficient for any affair that is likely to occur here.

HINKS,

Brigadier-General.
