HDQRS. SECOND CORPS, ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, May 7, 1864-10.45 a. m.

General WILLIAMS:

I have information from a scout, who says he was within hearing distance of the rebel lines, that a movement of infantry to our left took place last night. A deserter from the Fifth South Carolina, Hood's division, reports that he heard from some comrades he saw this morning, that his division had moved "by the right flank." I give you these items for what they may be worth.

Your obedient servant,WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General, Commanding.

General WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Army of the Potomac:

Our infantry are moving ahead carefully on the road. The enemy have two guns, with some support, but are retiring before us, disputing the way somewhat.

Major-General of Volunteers.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND CORPS, May 7, 1864-11.10 a. m.

General WILLIAMS:

The skirmishers on the plank road are still advancing. The enemy have one gun on the road, which the brigade advancing will endeavor to take. A regiment has been sent out on the same road where a company was driven in (cross-road from Brock's to Catharpin). The brigade on the plank road has just opened with musketry, with a lull immediately. The regiment referred to above has passed out of sight, driving the enemy's skirmishers before them through the woods.

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,Major-General.

HDQRS. SECOND CORPS, ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, May 7, 1864-11.25 a. m.

General WILLIAMS, A. A. G., Army of the Potomac:

General Birney reports that he has pressed the enemy until he has found a line of breast-works occupied by a full line of battle. The skirmishers are still standing, but he has withdrawn the brigade. The enemy had a full battery in these entrenchments, with which they opened. Nothing was seen of General Burnside on the right. I suppose this is the line of battle that was seen this morning facing the order way. General Birney reports this intrenched position about 2 miles from the cross-roads. I have not thought it proper to push the matter further until I heard from you, or knew what was going on upon the other road.

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General, Commanding.

General Birney has slowly retired without being followed.
