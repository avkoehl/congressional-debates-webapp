WAR DEPARTMENT,

Washington, December 17, 1862.

Major-General BURNSIDE,

Falmouth, Va.:

As the movements of Generals Dix and Foster must depend more or less on yours, I wish to consult with you here or at Aquia. But first it may be well for you to have a reconnaissance made of the banks of the river above and below Fredericksburg, and to learn the views of your officers in regard to future operations. Colonel Aspinwall could give no information in regard to your plans. Let me know when and where to meet you.

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,General-in-Chief:

I had better not leave here just at present, but will be glad to meet you at Aquia Creek wharf to-night at 10 o'clock, or after that hour if you can come down in an extra boat. Please answer.

I supposed that it would require a day or two for you to obtain full information on the points indicated. I also wish to collect certain information here. I will telegraph you again to-morrow morning. If you have not full information about the river, it should be obtained before we meet.
