CITY POINT, VA., October 13, 1864.

Major-General BUTLER:

Has the expedition started out this morning returned? What was the result of their observations? The troops have been assigned to General Benham to complete work laid to protect this place from raids and to enable a small force to hold it, in case it becomes necessary to move the greater part of the army. I would not like to reduce this force unless there is a special necessity for it.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE JAMES,October 13, 1864-7.25 p.m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

The expedition has returned. General Terry is now telegraphing me the results. I will send them as soon as received.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

The enemy have re-enforced in front of my old line, now commanded by Colonel Potter, who thinks they may attack him; I do not. They have been reconnoitering this evening with a balloon.

Major-General.

CITY POINT, VA., October 13, 1864

Major-General BUTLER:

Have your artillery enough at Bermuda to defend it if the enemy should attack? I do not think such a thing likely, but rather judge their examination to be with a view to farther advance their force there to re-enforce north of the James. We want to be watchful at all points.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE JAMES,October 13, 1864-9.15 p.m. (Received 9.20 p.m.)

Lieutenant-General GRANT,

City Point:

I think we have artillery enough in Bermuda to defend it if they should attack. We have all the artillery necessary on the line and one six-gun Napoleon battery for movable artillery. I do not believe in any intention of attack. A deserter, I had from in front of our line there said they had orders to look out for an attack from us day before yesterday.

BENJ. F. BUTLER,

Major-General, Commanding.
