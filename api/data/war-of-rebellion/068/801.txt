U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-Genera.
HEADQUARTERS,Fredericksburg, may 15, 1864.

CHIEF OF STAFF,

Lieutenant-General Grant's Headquarters:

GENERAL: I have to acknowledge the receipt of Lieutenant-General Grant's communication of this date, informing me of the presence of the Hampton cavalry on our right, an directing me to picket in that direction, and to meet it with a mixed force of infantry and cavalry. In reply I beg to assure the general that all proper measures shall be taken, but I must say I have but 120 infantry, and the cavalry are not be depended on. A force appeared this morning on the Telegraph road (horsemen), and I have been obliged to keep quite a large number to watch the movement in that direction. The demands on the for escorts, patrols, messengers, &amp;c., are numerous, so that the available force at my disposal is very small for other purposes.

Very respectfully, general, your obedient servant,

ED. SCHRIVER,

Inspector-General, Commanding.

BELLE PLAIN, May 15, 1864.
