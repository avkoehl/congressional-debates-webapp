FAIRFAX COURT-HOUSE,

December 31, 1862-10.45 a.m.

General AMBROSE E. BURNSIDE:

Stuart had a telegraph operator with him on his raid, and took all messages from the wires. I believe, from the fact that the line is not more frequently broken by them, that they obtain much information.

H. W. SLOCUM

BALTIMORE, MD. December 31, 1862

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

I am satisfied that no crossing of rebel cavalry was attempted yesterday at Harrisons' Island. Colonel Galligher, commanding at Point of Rocks, was unnecessarily alarmed and mistaken, as I supposed he might be. However, I took every precaution, by orders to General Kelley, and by sending troops up the road. The following is my late dispatch from General Kelley:

HARPER'S FERRY, W. VA.,

December 31, 1862-10 a.m.

Colonel WHIPPLE,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Baltimore:

Nothing new this morning. I have sent out strong cavalry scouts toward Leesburg and above Charlestown. Progressing rapidly with the railroad. Will have it open for travel by January 6 or 8.

B. F. KELLEY,

Brigadier-General.

ROBT. C. SCHENCK.

Major-General.
