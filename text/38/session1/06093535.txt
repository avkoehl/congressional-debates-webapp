1864.
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
but a fighter," in his recent expedition achieved
great success, going it absolutely wild, capturing
istaunton with all its vast depots of supplies, tak-
ing Lexington, the residence of the rebel ex-gov-
ernor of Virginia, John Letcher, and burning the
military ifistitute there, a hateful nursery of trea-
son. He tore up railroads, burned their bridges,
cut the canal, destroyed barges containing ord-
nance and ammunition, and inflicting irreparable
damage upon all the country. Every railroad
running into either Richmond or Petersburg is
now cut off, and the Richmond papers say no
trains of cars are running out from the city. Pe-
tersburg is substantially at our mercy to be shelled
and destroyed, and both that city and Richmond,
short of supplies and their communications cut,
must soon succumb. Lee's army, powerless for
attack upon our brave troops, short of necessary
supplies, must soon be cooped up for eventual
capture or make its way south toward the Caro-
linas. Our troops are in the highest spirits, full
of hope and courage, and every man confident of
success. The whole militaiy situation never
looked more promising than at present, and I be-
lieve we are now rapidly approaching the tri-
umphant end of the great struggle. This Con-
gress has nobly accomplished its duty. With all
the necessary legislation passed, with the certain
prospect of filling up the ranks of the Army, with
the patient and trusting patriotism of the people,
all loyal men can now look forward with hope
and faith. The firstsession of the Thirty-Eighth
Congress will adjourn under favorable auspices.
Returning to our seats on the 1st of December, as
I hope we all may, I trust we shall see the rebel-
lion crushed, peace restored, and the country re-
generated and disnitlualled.
The resolution was unanimously adopted.
