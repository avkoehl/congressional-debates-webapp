General SMITH,Huntsville, Ala.:

Just received following dispatch from Colonel Rowett:

"TWO MILES SOUTHEAST OF LAWRENCEBURG,

"May 7, 1864-7 p. m. (Via Pulaski 5. 30 p. m. 8th.)

"Brigadier-General STEVENSON:

"SIR: Roddey crossed both above and below Florence this morning. His force about 5,000. I fought him two hours, but found myself nearly surrounded, and, after losing a great many men, fell back on the Rawhide road. The enemy followed as far as Rawhide, when I think they struck toward the Nashville and Decatur Railroad. I am now moving toward Lawrenceburg. I have sent to Clifton for re- enforcements. If they come to-night I shall pitch into Roddey again to-morrow. I understand a portion of the Seventeenth Army Corps is near Lawrenceburg. I have notified them that Roddey is on this side of the river, and hope they will push forward to Pulaski. "

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JNO. E. SMITH,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

Major General JAMES B. McPHERSON,

Chattanooga, Tenn.
