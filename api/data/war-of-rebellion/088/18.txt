HDQRS. ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, SIGNAL DEPARTMENT, August 2, 1864.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: I have the honor to report that no movement of any moment was visible from the several signal stations occupied.

About 12 m. the enemy took one of the guns out of the work in the vicinity of the Gregory Chimneys. Fifteen men, with their knapsacks, haversacks, &amp;c., moved off with the gun, entering the woods in their rear, working parties going into and returning from same woods all the day. They are constructing works in these woods; can only see small part of it; therefore am unable to say what kind of works they are.

WARTS,

Signal Officer.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

B. F. FISHER,
