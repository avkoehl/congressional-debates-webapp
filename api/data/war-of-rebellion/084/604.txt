Captain C. H. DYER:

An escaped prisoner reports that on Sunday last he was taken up to a point four miles above Cotton Plant. One of Dobbin's companies had charge of him, also 200 colored prisoners, captured near Helena. It was understood Shelby had moved up previously. That night he escaped, and before going a mile came upon a large camp. At 4 o'clock yesterday afternoon, four miles east of Des Arc, a Confederate soldier overtook him, and said that Shelby and Dobbin were both an hour behind with their commands.

Captain C. H. DYER,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

It is excellent foraging east of Des Arc, in the neighborhood of Surrounded Hill. Perhaps Shelby has come down there for that purpose. If McCray retreats and gets round to Jacksonport and is followed by General West, will it not be best to have a force move out from here east of White River, driving out of following up Shelby? I shall have a scout at Surrounded Hill soon after daylight to-morrow morning.
