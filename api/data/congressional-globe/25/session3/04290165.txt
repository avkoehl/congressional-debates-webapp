them out of the stockade into the open ground
about When the massacre was over, the In-
dians turned their steps to the block house of the
Pearces They examined it, they walked round
it at a respectful distance, they went off, and
those two brothers, with a few men m their em-
ploy, maintained their position during the whole
war, without the loss of a life, and with the com-
plete protection of their own property This is
an example, m point, to show the safety of a
block house, and numerable others might be re-
lated. Entirely safe, then, will be the proposed
settlers in Florida, even without the piotection of
a military force But it is not intended to leave
them without protection The regular tioops of
the United States will remain in the country, oc-
cupying commanding positions, íeconnoitering,
narchmg, pursuing the Indians, and defending
the settleis There are now six regiments em-
ployed on that seivice, one of dragoons, two of
artillery, and three of lnfantiy They compuse
neatly four thousand men, and,even without the
clause to that effect in the bill, there can be no
question but that the Government will keep upa
strong military force in the country, and give all
possible protection, secuuty, and defense to the
hettlers Besides this land force, small vessels of
wai have been kept upon that station to succor
troops and mariners, and will doubtless be con-
tinued theie
The settleis will find healthy positions for their
stations On this point the letter of the Suigeon
Genual, Di Lavvson, is full and explicit, and his
skill as a medical man, and his knowledge of the

to the silubnty ot the stations winch miy be

tula itself After describing a gieat number of
wealthy and ieitilc distiicts, desirable for settle-
ments, he thus speaks of the immediate point of
he peninsula

This description of the peninsula (said Mr B )
puts a diffuent face upon it fiom that which it
had before borne It is cc-itam that it will sus-
tain a large population, merely from agncultuial
pursuits, and independently of the commerce
which its geogtaplucal position will command
The immediate point itself, heretofore believed to
bo bairen sand, or insalubrious marsh, is here
shown to be healthy, fertile, and beautiful, and
furnishing good homes foi two thousand settlers
under this b U, at three bundled and twenty acres
of land each
¡sir, the plan proposed by the bill is a good
plan, and must succeed if it is tried. The men
■will go, they will maintain their positions, and
the Indians will go away It is the cheapest plan
than can be devised, tor, unless it succeed , it
will cost nothing No rations will be issued un-
less the men go to the stations, no ¡and will be
granted unless they remain there until the In-
dians aie expelled It will cost nothing unless
t succeeds, and m this it diffeis from all othei
plans wh eh have been oi can be devised In
ail othei plans the expense is ceitain, the suc-
cess uncu tain.   If it does succeed, it will cost
but $4,500,000, $4,000,000 of which will be paid
io land, of which the settlers will have to gain
possession fiom the Indians, and, at the same
time will gam possession of upwards of twenty
million acies for the United States, over and above
what will pay themselves Compared to the
heavy expense of campaigns against the Indians,
this expenditure is comparatively nothing Com-
pared m ith the mere defense of the country and
the surruunding settlements, now occupying six
jegiments of regulars, and always more or less
of militia and volunteers, called out upon every
ahum, and it will still be found to be far the
cheapest Manage as they may, unless the
country is occupied by armed settlers, the mere
defense of the frontiers in perpetual calls for mili-
tia and volunteers, will amount to a great sum
annually, and, eventually, to far more than would
be the whole expense of expelling the Indians
and pacifying the country under this bill The
ten thousand men are not too many It is a case
m which both economy and humanity require an
ample number to be employed at once The
country to be occupied is of gieat extent, abound-
ing with fastnesses, and of a foim to regime the
greatest number of men to piotect it it is up-
wards of four hundred miles in length, by above
one hundied in breadth, with large swamps in
many places, and piesentmgan outline of at least
nine hundred miles, every part of which requires
defense Spiead ten thousand men over tins su-
porfice, and along this outline, in stations of
fromfoityto one hundred each, and it will be
found that the settlements will be spaisely enough
scat tend ovei it
llus is the plan, Mi Piesident, foi the recov-
eiy and pacification of Flouda It is reenm-
ra nded by the Secietary ot War, approved by
the most expeilenced officers, and is piacticable
on its face It is the plan on which we rely, and
the question is, shall we adopt this plan, oi do
nothing, and leave the work to the regular tioops,
and to the miluia and \ olunteers which, from time
to time, may be called out? Expeaence shows
that this mode of warfare can accomplish no le-
sults, that, at the end of three years, the popula-
tion of four counties remain driven from their
homes, the frontiers of Georgia he open to incur-
sion and massacre, the suburbs of Tallahassee
and St Augustine are penetrated and attacked,
forty-one thousand square miles of our territory
aie lavaged by a savage foe, and a large extent of
coast, including a cape which must be doubled,
lying between the Gulf of Mexico and the Allan
tic—between New Oilcans and New Yoik—is
moie unsafe to the American manner than the
savage shoies of the most bai binan nations in any
pait of Afnca, Asia, or New Holland T his state
of things cannot be tolerated—cannotbe permitted
to continue The United ¡states Government ou es
deft nse to its citizens, and protection to its Terri-
tories It owes piotection and secuuty to its com-
meice We cannot give up the peninsula of
Flouda to a banditti ot savages, we cannot sur
lendei it to become a lefuge to runaway slaves,
marauding Indians, and to freebooteis and pnates
from the surrounding islands and keys of the
Gulf of Mexico We cannot permit a part of out
own coast to remain moie dangerous to oui mai-
meis thin the coasts of the most distant and bai
barian nation, we cannot suffer ourselves to be
baffled in a contest with a tube of savages We
must subdue these Indians, we must pacify and
settle riotida The plan we propose is the only
one fiom which success, in any reasonable time,
is expected It is the only one which we now
have to offer, and, having thus made an exposi
tion of the principle of the bill, it would be very
agreeable to me, and a course strictly parliament-
ary in itself, to take the sense of the Senate on
the pnnciple of the measure, unembarrassed with
details, on a motion to strike out the first section,
or to postpone the whole bill indefinitely If
theie are Senators who object to the whole plan
of the bill—to the whole idea of an armed occu-
pation by settleis and cultivators—fetthem moie
to strike out, oi to postpone We shall then
havi the sinse of the Senate upon the principle
of the measure, and if that sense is aga'nst tne
whob measure, much time and trouble will be
saved in avoiding all the labor of peiiectmg de

SEWLFMENT OF FLORIDA
REMARKS OP HON LEWIS F LINN,
OF MISSOURI,
In the St-state, Te&i uary 5, 1839
The bill for the armed occupation ind settlcrnt nt of hit
part of rienda which is now overrun uid mlistod i y i os-
tile bands of Indians, being under con*iderat on—
Mr LINN said there was great necessity of
adopting this or some similar measuie, and gave
it as his opinion that, with the means heretofore
used, we should not bring this unfortunate war
to a close in less than half a century We will ac-
complish no good by sending detachments of the
regular army against these Indians Our officers,
¡t seemed to him, were too fearful of being beaten
to act efficiently or to encounter them successful-
ly We must get men there who will be determ-
ined to subdue the Indians at all hazards Let any
one look back at the battle of Okechobe, and it
would be obvious that there never was less mili-
taiy skill than was displayed on that occasion,
that the enors committed on thatday arose from
the feai on the part of the commanding general
of being defeated by the Seminóles Mr L said
that he could scarcely trust himself to speak of
that battle, for, generally speaking, it agitated
him piofoundly even to think of it. He was not
ceitain that he ought to trust himself to speak of
it at all, and the Senate would remember the ica-
sons why, as a Missouuan, he manifested feeling
and discomposure in adverting to that battle.
[Mr L alluded to the slaughter of the Missouri
volunteers, and the attempt that was made to tar-
nish their reputation ] He was satisfied that the
best defense for the gieat western frontier would
be a coi don of just such men as his colleague had
asked lot m his bill If you will give thiee han-
dled and twenty acres ot land lying along that
whole line of frontín, of one thousand two hun-
dred miles m length, to every man who would
settle on it, and engage in its defense, you would
at once organize a force that would set at defiance
those hordes of savages which the policy of this
Government had accumulated on that border, and
of whose foimidable numbers his fnend from
South Carolina [Mr. Preston] had spoken.
Mr L here spoke in favorable terms of the bill
introduced by one of the Senators from Arkansas,
[Mr Fulton,] setting apart a ceitam portion of
land on that fiontiei as bounty lands fbr settlers
who will engage in its defense That whole fron-
tier (Mr L said) was sparsely settled, and this
state of things oífen d a temptation to marauding
bands of sav iges to attack them Build up a wall
against the sixty thousand Indian warriors stiung
a'ong that bonki, of hardy, brave, and entei pris-
ing pioneeis, and youi regular aimy will find
employment m preventing the whites fiom en-
croaching on and overwhelming the Indians. And
that should be the state of things We are enti-
tled to tianquillity and safety, and they to per
mamut protection, that they may puisue the path
which is to lead them to improvement in civiliza-
tion, Christianity, and their concomitant bless-
ings
Mi L said he did not believe theie was any
danger of a geneialwai with all the Indians on
that frontiei, unless we should have war with
Great Butain, in which event we may look font
to a great ctitamty At present wo have a stiong
hold on many tribes, through large annuities se
cured to thtm by tititles, and which they will
lose Ly going to wai with the United States But
the dangei now is, that some tube on which we
have no hold thiough their inteiests, may com-
mence hosts, mes, and be joined immediately by
clouds of young, tuibulent, and active wainors,
fiom i eighboung tubes If you will, Mr Presi-
dent, give lands to persons who will pledge them-
selves to inhabit and cultivate the same foi a cer-
tain number of years, and let them have choice
land, you would find many, veiy rnany, m the
South and West, actuated by pretty much the
same motives which Toussaint oi Chustopbe said
governed the Yankees—that is, 'f a bag of coffee
was hung up at the gates of tne internal legions,
a Yankee would be 'ound enterpiismg enojgh to
go there and get it So it was with ti e hirdy
pioneers of the West and Southwest Tell them
that you will give them a section or half secuoa
