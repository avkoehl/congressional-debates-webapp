They would not notice in. I ordered my men to fix bayonets, and said: "If they will not give us quarter, we will die like men." I then asked if they would give us quarter. One of their officers said yes. The firing ceased, and I surrendered, throwing my arms and all other property into the flames, to save them from the enemy.

My force was 83 men, of whom 2 were killed and 6 wounded. The force of the enemy was 3,100, of whom 104 were killed and wounded.

Too much credit cannot be given the men of my company. There was no shrinking among them. Each man held his post unfalteringly. They were ever obedient to orders and prompt to execute them. I strove to imitate Lexington.

I am, sir, your obedient servant,
