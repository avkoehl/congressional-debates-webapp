General RUGER,

Commanding Third Brigade:

There are at Wartrace Thirteenth New Jersey, four companies Second Massachusetts, 100 of One hundred and fiftieth New York. They are to be relieved by two regiments of Candy's brigade to-morrow night. You will find rations at the bridge 1 mile below this-twenty thousand. Take three or four days' for your command.

I shall probably go on to Decherd to-night, but will try to be in Tullahoma to-morrow night. Send three regiments of your troops to Elk River, and three at Tullahoma. Guard all the bridges, culverts, and water-tanks between Tullahoma and Elk River. Send up the battery of artillery to Decherd. You have guns at Tullahoma and Elk River. Elk River should be first and carefully guarded. Intrench everywhere.
