Honorable E. M. STANTON;

Will you please order an inquiry to be made at Vicksburg to ascertain why 2,000 released Federal prisoners were crowned on board the ill-fated steamer Sultana, against the remonstrance of the captain of the boat and when two other large steamers were in port at the same time, bound up river, with very few passengers? The loss of life is known to exceed 1,400. *
