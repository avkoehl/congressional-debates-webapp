Major-General SHERIDAN,

Commanding Third Division:

GENERAL: General Rosecrans sends information this evening that General Thomas met with no opposition at Hoover's Gap. This leads General McCook to think that the enemy are drifting to our right, and he has applied to hold General Brannan's force to-morrow, until something definite is developed. The general says he wishes you to be on the lookout for any developments, as stated above.

Respectfully,

G. P. THRUSTON,

Assistant Adjutant-General and Chief of Staff.

The general commanding cannot call at your headquarters to-night, but he desires you to send in a full report of the situation in your front, the position of your force, your opinion of the strength and position of the enemy. How have you succeeded in getting up your train? Do you think we can send our trains across to Bradyville, and thence southward? Are the roads practicable?
