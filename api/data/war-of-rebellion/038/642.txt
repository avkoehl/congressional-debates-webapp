Major-General LORING, Yazoo City, via Vaughan's Station:

The enemy reported through the Pass with gunboats and three transports; reported 3,000 strong-evidently too large. The location of the batteries unfortunately on wrong side of river. Let me know with what artillery and what troops you occupy that point; also how many cotton boats can operate with Tilghman's brigade and those on the river. I suppose you have sufficient force.
