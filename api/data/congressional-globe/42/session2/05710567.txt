land scrip may be sold, the process realized and in

add does not, please to establish a school ; and in
the existing law and that prepared by Mr. Terry

The amendment I suggest will remedy this.

reported by Mr. Maynard. of Tennessee, which is
excellent in its purpose, ana is perhaps all that can
be done as to that which is past; but for the future
letthe laws which make the donations at the same
time make provision that the donees shall perform
their part of the bargain.
My mind is strongly directed toward the educa-

We do not propose tliat the aid granted by this
bill shall be frittered away after this manner.
We do intend to do good to the systems of
education adopted in the various States. We
intend to apply a fund for that particular pur-
pose and none other. We will not have a fund
for the benefit of the children of the State turned
into a corruption fund, subject to the spolia-
tion of the dishonest politicians of the State of
any party. We have therefore provided in sec-
tion seven that after the first distribution each
State, Territory, and the District of Columbia
shall be entitled to its distribution share upon
compliance with the following conditions:
fir&t, that it shall have made the provision
for the education of its children required in
the fifth section of this act 5 second, that it
shall have applied all moneys by it previously
received under this act in accordance there-
with 5 third, that it shall, through the proper
officer thereof, for the year ending the 30th
day of June last preceding such apportion-
ment, make full report of the number of
schools free to all the children thereof; the
number of teachers employed; the number
of school-houses owned and the number of
school-houses hired; the total number of chil-
dren taught during the year; the actual daily
attendance; and the actual number of months
of the year schools shall have been main-
tained in each of the several school districts
or divisions of said State, Territory, or Dis-
trict, and the amounts appropriated by the
Legislature for the purpose of maintaining a
system of free public schools.
I call particular attention to the fact that
the report called for by the third clause of
the seventh section concern the year previous
to the apportionment, and do not in anywise
affect the basis of apportionment. The basis
of apportionment is fixed by section four of
the act upon the population of the State, and
not upou the report. A State having a popu-
lation of a million and reporting one school,
one teacher, and one pupil, in conformity with
the act, is entitled to the same distributive
share as another State having the same popu-
lation and reporting a thousand schools and
fifty thousand pupils. The report is essential;
the character of the report, so longas it follows
the conditions prescribed, is non-essential.
I may say that this section of the bill,was
the subject of much care and thought; that we
have largely followed the suggestions of my
colleague on the committee, [Mr. Duxxell,]
an educator of large experience and acknowl-
edged sagacity and wisdom, and we believe
that while it does not trench upon the cher-
ished rights of the State to provide for the
education of its children, it gives the required
check upon a grant of this character. r
I have carefully examined all the various
grants made by the United States to the dif-
ferent States for educational purposes, and do
not find one in all the list not based upon con-
ditions.
Section eight, following up the ideas of sec-
tion seven, provides that the Commissioner of
Education shall certify as to each State, Terri-
tory, and District whether it is entitled to its
distributive share of the apportionment under
this act; but in order to prevent any favorit-
ism, we therein provide for an appeal to Con-
gress from the adverse decision of the Com-
missioner.
Section nine provides for the distribution
within the State of the moneys apportioned,
and herein we appty the stimulus directly to
the school district, by providing that the dis-
tributive share of each State shall be given to
such of the school districts therein as shall
have maintained schools for at least three
months, leaving with the Legislatures of the
several States the manner in which a proper
apportionment shall be ascertained.
I find that my voice has entirely given out.
The remaining sections merely provide the
manner in which the several duties and trusts
shall be executed. I will therefore enter a
motion to recommit, and yield the balance of
ray time to the gentleman from Pennsylvania,
[Mr. Storm.]
The SPEAKER. Then the gentleman from
Pennsylvania [Mr. Storm] will be entitled to
the floor for twenty-three minutes.
Mr. STORM. Can I not take the floor in
my own right for an hour? Will not the
chairman of the committee [Mr. Perce] con-
cede that much to us?
Mr. PERCE. 1 propose that this bill, be-
ing a very important one, shall be discussed
very thoroughly in the House, and that it
shall keep its place in the morning hour until
disposed of after a full and thorough debate.
I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania3
