with safety to «self, provoke the- hostility of (he
Administration, of everfail to second ns policy
and support its interests^ and thus, sit, the entire
money power of the country, public Treasury,

of Executive patronage If you ask me how
this subjection of the banks to the Administra-
tion can he Ijrooght about, I answer in * manner
at once simple and «ffective The Administration
wtll only have to select some one or more confi-
dential and (tostrwoithy pamsans, who they
shall already ha.v <«ppon*tea to the chief places
of trust m the sub-Treasury sctteme, and inti-
mate tobim that such a bank requires to be dealt
with, and m thirty or sixty days at furthest, us
work is done—it will be discredited, or compelled
to wind up its affairs. A fund of fifty or a hun-
dred thousand dollars would be sufficient in most
cases; in some others a greater and in some,
perhaps, the temporary use of half a million
would be required to effect the destruction of the
obnoxious institution

West, forexample, with Borne few hundred thou-
sands of the public money, 01 with aulhouty to
draw on some eastern bank, employed to disguise
the source of the attack; no difficulty will exist in
exchanging such funds at any time for the local
currency fhat effected, it would only remain to
convert the notes of the several banks in a State,
thus picked up, into the notes of the one marked
out for destruction; then present the notes thus
collected for payment, and if one blow thus sud-
denly dealt should not suffice, repeat it until it

may be done in a manner so stealthy, that no

EXPENSES Or GOVERNMENT
SPEECH OF HON. JOHN BELL,
of tennessee,
In the House oí Representatives,
February 27, 1839,
On the civil and di| lomruic appropriation bill
Mr BELL said he had intended, if the public
business had permitted, to submit his views upon
severalinportantsubjectsconnected with the Ex-
ecutive adrnmistiation of the Government before
the bill parsed fiom the committee into the House,
but he had become satisfied that it was his duty
to foibear, whatever nasons of a personal natuie
might urge him to do so If any member of the-
House owed ft to himself to vindicate his course
against attacks which had tri a variety of ways
been made uponit in that House,hemightclaim
the indulgence Of the House for that purpose
The *iewá hé had Submitted on the message at
an early day of the session, had not only been
replied to with great freedom and latitude of re-
mark, but with much unfatrness and acrimony
Still he had thought it of more consequence that
certain billsxtpon the Speaker's table, and other
measures should be taken up and acted upon,than
that he should occupy the time of the House in
replying to gentlemen who had spoken against
and at him in the seieral discussions which had
intervened since December
Mr B said that he would now ask the indul-
gence of the House for a very short time He
had both a general and a special object in view in
rising to say a few words; butas it might not be
in order to present the views he desired upon the
particular amendment under consideration, he
would move to strike out the enacting clause of
the bill
After the question was stated from the Chair
upon this motion,
Mr BELL resumed He said the particular
object he had in view was to correct, so far as
regarded himself, an impression whioh appeared
to prevail relative to the vote of the House upon
the resolution of the gentleman fiom Virginia,
[Mr Maliobv,] directing the Secretary of the
Navy to lay before the next Congress a plan for
the reoiganization of the Navy Department
Many persons, both in and outof the House, had
taken up the impression that all those who voted
foi the resolution had adopted the argument and
concuned in the statements made in favor of the
motion to strike out the appropriation to pay the
salary of the Commissioners of the Navy Board,
and consequently weic prepared to dispense with
the boaid tor the future For one, I beg lea\e to
disclaim the intention imputed to me in this re
spect However plausible the inference, it is not
well founded in regaid to myself, and, I believe,
with regaid to many others I desire to state that
1 was by no means satisfied, from anything mged
111 the discussion, that the piesent organisation
of the Navy Dcpattment is defective, or'that the
piosc nt condition of that branch of the public ser-
vice is justly attnbutable to the existence of the
Navy Boaid, but it was a suffi< lent reason with
tne to support the pioposition for a report from
the Senetary of the Navy upon the propel organ-
ization of that Department, that many gentlemen,
some of whose opinions are entitled to much re-
spect, stated then strong conviction that the pres-
ent organization was radically defective 1 was
willing to hear what the Secretary had to say upon
the subject, and what he would consider an im-
provement in this branch of the public service I
was then, as I hope I shall always be, prepared
to be guided by suffieient facts and reasons, and
to sustain whatever plan may appear, upon full
examination, to be for the good of the service
J?ut there was a part of the leasoning employed
by gentlemen in support of the motion to strike
out, which I intended to disclaim at the time, had
not the debate teiminated abruptly by the with-
drawal of the motion
One of the principal aiguments advanced by the
gentleman1 fiom Mulligan, [Mr Crary,] who
made the motion, and by otheis, was, that the
Navy Board, by being composed of more than one
member, admitted of no adequate responsibility,
theie was no head, theie was no individual ac-
countability, and it was to this cause that weie
to be referred all the miscarriages and gross blun-
ders which had marked the administration of that
Department To this cause was attributed, in the
argument, the shameful mismanagement of the
exploring expedition, as well as every other abuse
admitted to exist in that branch of the service I
apprehend these views aie founded upon a total
misconception of the law and of the powers vested
in the Navy Board If 1 am not giosslymis
taken, the Commissioners of the Navy Botid have
no uncon tiollable or discretionary poweis, but are
in all their leadmgduties subject to the authority
and contiol of others When it is said that there
is no responsible head, that there is no individual
responsibility, and that all the abuses in this De-
paitment are to be ascribed to this board, I ask
honorable gentlemen to inform" the House what
disposition they have ma.de of the Secretary of
the NáVy ' What are las powers '-what his duties
and responsibility' Is he not a unit' Is he~not
that Very Aen* which they so much -desire ' And
if he*is not,w"hat else Is" he' And again- what
has become of trie Pfesidentof théXTnited States,
the executive head Of the Government—he apon
whom, in the language, and according to the doc-
trines Of the day, rests the entire and exclusive
responsibility of the Whole executive administra-
tion ? I contend that there is, first, the Sécretaty
of the Navy, who is the head of the Navy De-
partment, and who is responsible to this House
and to the country for the proper and faithful ad-
ministration of that Department; that he has, by
law1, the control of the Navy Board, and that he
is, and ought to be, responsible for its conáuct.
I assert, in the second place, that the President
himself is responsible for the coflduct of the Sec-
retary of the Navy, and for the proceedings of
the JNavy Board aleo There is, then, no deficiency
in the legal and constitutional pi ovisions to secure
a proper individual responsibility The want of
this" íesponsibility is certainly not the souice of
the evil which all admit exists What is the most
probable source of the evil, I will attempt to point
out before I sit down
It is a remarkable circumstance that not one of
the seveial gentlemen who pressed the necessity
of dispensing with the Navy Board, and dwelt
with so much earnestness upon the wretched con-
dition of the Navy, made the slightest reference
to the possible imbecility and incapacity of those
gentlemen who have foi years presided ovef that
department No exception whatever has been
taken to the qualifications or competency of any
of the late Secietanes But the facts stated h/
the gentleman from Michigan, [Mr Crary,] com-
ing from the source they do, are entitled to the
pmticu lar attention of the House and the country
No one, no matter to what political pa*rty he may
belong, will charge that gentleman with a design
to do injustice to the existing Administration, or
to the paity which has been in power during the
last ten years No one will question either his
orthodoxy or the truth of any statement he «lakes
which is in any way unfavorable to the inteiésts
of his political friends I am glad I can take my
facti fiom a souice so unquestionable If I had
ventuied to make the statements he has furnished
ns with, they would have been denied, and de-
nounced by half the country as the offspring of
disappointed ambition and party 1 ancor That
gentleman told us that, after the expenditure of
millions upon millions upon the Navy, it was
still in no better condition than it was at the close
of the late war' lsthistrue.su' Forone,Ido
not gainsay or doubt the truth of the statement
The gentleman might, also, with the same pro-
priety and truth, have stated that, although the
late and the present Administrations owed their
existence to the determination of the people to
piovide a more faithful and effective Administra-
tion, and one which would supply the defects and
correct the abuses which their predecessors, it
was alleged, had permitted to prevail in every
branch of the public service, yet, after an exper-
iment often years, and an incieased expenditure
upon the Navy, it was, in the year 1839, in no
better plight, scarcely in any one respect, than it
was in the year 1829
The gentleman from Michigan made another
statement, for which i am obliged to him, for it
referred to a period and a crisis in our affairs
which was, at the time, held up as of the utmost
interest and delicacy 1 allude to the period of
1835-36, when it was supposed by many that we
were upon the eve of a war with France The
course of some of my political friends, together
with my own at that period, was violently as-
sailed by our opponents The gentleman from
Michigan has confirmed by his statement all that
I either said or did or thought in refeience to the
conduct, or rather to the gross and culpable neg-
ligence, of the Executive, in all that concerned
the public defenses, and especially that most im-
portant of all—the Navy, at that period The
gentleman from Michigan now admits, that when
it appeared probable that we might be suddenly
involved in a war with France, and, he might
have added, when a war with that Power wias
provoked and even desired by .many influ*ntial
