PETERSBURG, April 10, 1865.

General WEITZEL:

Have just learned that Mr. Woodbury, special agent of the Treasury Department, gathered up several bags of papers in the back yard of the Weldon railroad depot which are probably those referred to in Mr. Dana's dispatch. They have been sent to Norfolk where they can yet be examined.

OFFICE OF THE PROVOST-MARSHAL-GENERAL, ARMIES OPERATING AGAINST RICHMOND,

City Point, Va., April 10, 1865.

Major General G. L. HARTSUFF,

Commanding U. S. Forces, Petersburg, Va.:

Brevet Brigadier-General Collis is acting under the orders of Lieutenant-General Grant, dated April 8, at Burkewille, and his command can neither be relieved nor removed from here until the prisoners now en route to this place are turned over to General Hoffman, commissary-general of prisoners. As this will consume two or three days I beg that Orders, Numbers 4, from your office, may be temporarily suspended, so far as the assignment of General Russell to immediate command is concerned.

M. R. PATRICK,

Provost-Marshal-General.

GENERAL: The undersigned, citizens of Petersburg, desirous of conferring with influential citizens of Richmond on the steps proper to be taken in the existing military condition of affairs with a view to the restoration of civil government, respectfully ask passports to visit Richmond and return for that purpose. As we may find it advisable to remain for a few days we suggest that the passports, if granted, be so farmed as not to expire before Saturday next.
