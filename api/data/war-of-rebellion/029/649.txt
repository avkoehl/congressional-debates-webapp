M, strengthened by 50 men detailed from Companies B, C, D, G, I, and K, commanded by Lieutenant L'Hommedieu, proceeded to establish a courier line from General Rosecrans' headquarters to La Vergne, and so remained, doing good service, until relieved January 4, 1863. These details left me with only six small companies, numbering in the aggregate 260 men, rank and file.

On the morning of the 31st, Colonel Garesche informed me that rebel cavalry were appearing on the right flank of the line of battle, and ordered me to proceed with the Fourth U. S. Cavalry to look after them. This must have been between 7 and 8 o'clock in the morning. I crossed the Murfreesborough pike, and drew up the six companies in line of battle in the following way: Each company was in column of fours, led by the company commanders; the companies on a line parallel to each other, company distance apart according to the following diagram, leading the center myself:

---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ----

---- ---- ---- Standards. ---- ---- ----

This was owing to the wooded country and fences that were obstructions to the ordinary line of battle. Proceeding to the right of the line, I found our entire right flank had given way. Learning from some men of General Davis' division the position of the enemy's cavalry, I made a turn to the right, moving about one-quarter of a mile, and discovered the enemy. I came out of a piece of timber I was in, and, getting over the fence rapidly, charged the enemy with my entire command, completely routing them, with the exception of two pieces of artillery, supported by about 125 cavalry, stationed between my right and the Murfreesborough and Nashville pike, who were not at first discovered. I rallied my men again, and, while rallying, I saw about 300 of the volunteer cavalry on my right. I rode over to them, and asked them to change the artillery with me and the few men I had rallied to take the pieces. The officer replied that he was placed there to protect a train, and would not charge with me. I have no doubt I could have taken the artillery. Before I could get my command rallied the artillery moved off. About the time I had got my men rallied I received an order from General Rosecrans to proceed to the Nashville and Murfreesborough pike as soon as possible. I did so immediately. I have since thought that the general did not know my position, or he would have allowed me to follow up the enemy. I was much nearer the pike than I thought I was. I saw no more of the enemy's cavalry on the pike that morning.

In this charge I cannot speak in too high terms of the officers and men. Every man charged and kept in position, taking over 100 prisoners of the enemy and releasing a large number of our own captured men. More redounds to their credit, considering that a large majority are recruits from volunteer infantry, and only some five days drilled and mounted. Two companies of infantry were released in a body.

The train on the pike, I have since learned, was in possession of the enemy, with a large number of stragglers, who were being disarmed at the time. These stragglers did nothing at all to protect the wagons, scarcely firing a shot. From prisoners taken I have learned that the Fourth U. S. Cavalry charged at this time an entire brigade of cavalry, and routed them to such an extent that they disappeared from the field at that point entirely.

Later in the day I sent 79 prisoners in one body to the Tenth Ohio
