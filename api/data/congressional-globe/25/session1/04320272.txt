Postponement of fourth instalment—Mr. Hahtead.
H. of Reps.
a valid consideration, and the aggregatto menhum of
thepaities. Some gent'emen have contended that
there is no contract between this Governmer t and
the States respectively, because there is no such
agreement as can be enforced in a court of justice
But it is no part oí the essence of a contract ihat it
can be enforced in a court of jnsMeo There  ie
many contracts «inch cannot be enforced m a
court of justice A contract between a sovereign
and a subject cannot be enforced in a court of
justice, for it is a part of the royal pi roga-
ttve not to be sued , the only redress of the subject
is by petition But would it not be highlv deroga-
tory to the royal dignity to evade the peformance of
its contracts, by sheltering itself behind the asjis of
royal pterogative' Again, it his been said that
there can be no contract between the United States
an I the States in refeience to ihe payment of this
fourth instalment, because there was no consideration
pas i g between them The honorable member
from New York (Mr Sibley) showed, conclusive!},
in ih very able argument which he delivered yes-
terday, that there was a good consideration fur a
cmtract, and that there was an actual valid con-
tract. I will not detain the committee by rejteiating
h s argument, and I w ould only add to the au-
thorities to which he rereired, the authority of Ihe
Supreme Court of the United States, m the case of
Fletcher and Peck, and the case of the Dartmouth
College. In the former case, it is decided mat a
grant of a Slate, m its own natuie, amounts tu an
extinguishment of the right of the granlor, and im-
plies a csntract not to assert th-t right, and lhat it
is sufficient to foim a valid a nsderaiion for a con-
tract, lfitimpoit adamage, or loss, or forbearance of
benefit, oi any act done, or to be done, on the part
of the grantee. I am, therefore, decidedly of opin-
ion that the United States have entered into a firm
and valid contiact with the seveia! States, to pay
over to them, i n Ih' firs' < f Ot ober n< \ , Inp i re-
spective port ons ol ihe surplus levenue , mid that
the withholding the fotuth instalment would be a
violation of the national faith solemnly plelged
under the sanction of law On the faith of ihit
pledge, some of the States have actually anticipated
and expended this fourth instalment , and others
have made contracts based upon its reception , and
it would be cruel now to disappoint them. Our
pledged faith should be redeemed. I am not one of
those who believe that a change m the state of the
public finances will authorize a violation of nation-
al faith , on the conuary, I believe that good faith
is a goddess, that ought to be worship} ed a all
times, and under all cucuiiist u a s
This loin In instalment has buen treated by some
gentlemen as a claim by the Government against
the Slates, as if the S ales stood to the United
States m the relation of a debtor to i en mtoi It
appears to me that this is not ihe i< lation m w Inch
they stand, or ought to be placed I do not \ lew
the money divided among the Slates as creating a
debt to the United State  I encur with the honoi-
able member from Kentucky, (Mi Underwood,)
xn believing that the States, in receiving their shares
under the deposite act, only received what justly
belonged to them. Much the greater pioportion of
that surplus was derived from the sales ot the pub-
lands—lands which were w on by the States m a
common cause, fiom a common foe, oi purclnsed
by then common tieasure And, sir, noStifenaid
more dearly for then portion of the proceeds of ihf
sales of the public lands, both in blood and trea-
sure, than did the State uf Ned Jci e^, vhoe
every field almost was fertilized, nii<l every stieam
discolored, b} the blood of her pituot cu /ens
Bui, sir, eun if the United St?tes had a valid
claim against the Sutes for the immediate leturn
of the money to whicn they lie entit'ed under tne
deposite act, it appears to me that gentlemen pn -
sent this Government m a moM unfaiorable atti-
tude, when, Sin lock like, t'itv would hate it exact
the full penalty uf its boud in this crisis of our
public calamity, though in su eh nig it should cut its
pound of flesh neaiest to the hent oí ihe pe p'e
Gentlemen scorn to considei tbi« Government like
some ancient feudal baiony, whose powuful iord,
intrenched wnhin his frowning bitikmtn s and
moated rampirt<, has no connox on m s^mpiihi
With the peop'e, and hardly knows ot then   eu t-
enoe except when he wants their aid to fight his
bitt!e~, or sends out his purvevor« to plunder their
crops. My opinion of a Go /ernment is, that the
attitude which it ought to hold to the people should
be rather the attitude which a parent holds to a
child, or a guardian to a ward, than lhat of a hard-
hearted creditor to his debtor, or a feudal baron to
his vassal The good of the governed is the main
end and aim of all government One of the very
objects which conduced to the formation of the Con-
stitution of the United State', is stated in Ihe pre-
amble to that instrument to be " to promote the wel-
fare of the people " Such laws only should be
made as will confer the greatest permanent good on
the greatest number of the people Will the pas-
s?ge of this act effect this object' This brings me
to the consideration of the consequences which will
result from Ihe passage of this bill, and to consider
the inexpediency of this bill. Will it not add gieatly
to the distress of the peop'e' An honorable mem-
ber from Ohio, (Mr Duncan,) has told us that there
is no distress among his constituents I am happy,
sir, to hear that the constituents of the honorable
member are not suffering the distress m which some
of my ¡jonstituents are involved. To show to the
honorable member, and to this committee, the ex-
tent of lhat distress in one of the cities of my na-
tive State—a city renowned thioughout this coun-
try for the enterprise, activity, and intelligence of
its inhabitants—I mean the city of Newark—I will
read an extract from a letter jecently received,
wh>ch pives the following cie^cnpt on of that once
flon-ishing city
" In 1836 the population of Newark was 20,736,
and it is believed by citizens of intelligence and ob-
seivation that at this penod it does not exceed
1 5,000 In 1836, the number of men and women
(including apprentices) engaged in mechanical em-
ployments exceeded 7,000 , at the present time the
number does not reach 1,500, ind one half of these
leceueonly parti il emplomen!, Imelj suficicnt
to keep then families from starvation Dunng the
greater portion of the summer, the number has not
exceeded 400 To such an extent has the distress
extended, that the city authorities have emplojed
for several months 300 men to work on the loads,
at fifty cents per day, out of the class of citizens
whom the city would otherwise have been obliged
to suppoi t as paupers. A once flourishing city, last
3 ear containing a population of 20,000 souls, manu-
facturing largely in fourteen different branches of
mecrnntcal business, full of the hum of industry
and other indications of piospenty, whose business
men uere possessed of unlimited credit and un-
doubted wealth, reduced in nine months to two-
thuds of its foimer population, its manufactories
stopped, its citizens out of employment, and many
of them brought to extreme w ant' This is sober
reality I have seen many of our most respectable
mechanics hired at fifty cents per day to work on
roads, who, but one year ago, were leceivmg from
fifteen to twenty dolíais per week for their labor
More than three times that number of dwelling-
houses have been abandoned, and pre now to let
Tenants are unable fi pay, and landlords will
scarcely realrze sufficient m cash to meet their taxes
and insurance "
S r, this is a description of some of the distress
which exists in a portion of the State which I have
the honor to represent Sir, if I could tike the
honorable membei from Ohio, to that eiiy, I coul I
show him scenes of distress which would rend the
heart of the most obdurate And, sir, th.it distress
has not been occasioned by ihe causes to which the
President, m his message, seems to he disposed to
attribute them, viz " to the rapid growth among all
Classes, and especially in our gieat commercial
towns, of luxurious habits, founded meiely on
fancied wealth, and detrimental alike to the in-
dustry, the íesources, and the morals of our peo-
p'e " The people of the State of New Jersey are
a temperate, mdustnous, and a moral people Let
not the President lay to his heart the flittering
unction, that the distress which has struck down the
enterprise and prosperity of that once queen of
m luufaet'iring cities to which I have alluded, and
which has paralyzed the business of the whole
country, is to be attributed to the caires which he
ha> aligned    No, Mr, it is to !?e attabuted to the
insane and ruinous experiments of  the last and
present Executive
But, sir, w hat is to be the effect of this bill' Will
it afford to the suffering people any relief1 No,
sir. That it will tend greatly to aggravate all the
evils under which they now labor, I think perfect-
ly demonstrable, even from the report of the Sec-
retary of the Treasury itself What does the
tabular statement, (letter Q,, page 63,) annexed to
that report shows us' It shows us that on the 1st
of March, 1837, the whole amount of specie in the
deposite banks was $15,312,802, and the amount
of discounts at the same period was $171,287,054 ,
and that on the 15th of August last, the amount of
specie in these banks was $10,580,413, and the
amount of discounts was $104,720,750 ; so that,
while the specie m these banks has been diminish-
ed, in five months, $4,712,479, the loans and dis-
counts have been diminished $40,689 862, or with-
in a fraction of ten dollars to one, for every one
dollar in specie which has been withdrawn from
the vaults of these banks, they have been obliged
to call in fiom their debtors ten dollars (These
deposite banks, it will be observed are generally
in a better condition than other banks, having a
larger pioportion of specie ) Now, sir, if the pro-
gress of the reduction of loans and discounts is to
go on, and to bear the same ratio to the reduction
of the specie which this table exhibits, what is to
be the condition of this oppressed and suffering
community' These banks in order to place them-
selves in a condition to pay the $12,944,666, which,
on the 15'h of August, was standing to the credit
of the Treasmex of the United States on their
books, (as appear  by the same tabular statement,)
would be obhsed to reduce their loans and dis-
counts to $120,000,000 This would be grinding
the people of this country to the dust.
But again let us lake another view of tms sub-
ject, in reference to ihe circulation of these banks,
as repiesented in lilis same table On the 1st of
March, 1837, then specie was $15,312,610, and on
the same day their circulation w as $44,827,595, on
the 15th August their specie was $10,580,413, and
their circulation is then reduced to $32,626,004, a re-
duction of $^,712,470in the specie and $12,201,591
in the circulation , so that for eveiy one dollar of
specie withdrawn from their vaults they have had
to withdraw nearly three dollars fiom their circu-
lation And this is about the average which the
circulation bears to the specie, as we are told by
Mr Crawford, in his celebrated report on the cur-
rency, made to this house m December, 1820 Then,
sir, to enable these deposite banks to pay in specie
(for nothing else will be received by the Govern
ment,) this $12,944,666, which was due to the
Treasuier of the United Stales on the 15th of Au-
gust, from these deposite banks, they must curtail
their circulation $36,000,000 Your poor suffeung
pat ent, already in a state of complete exhaustion
by your miserable quack remedies and system of
depletion, for the put pose of carrying out your San-
grado ihpory, is to be subjected to the operation of
the lancet until the last drop of blood is drawn from
his veins.
One other remark, and I shall dismiss this topic.
The specie, I have said, was on the 15th of August
$10,580,413, the amount due to the Treasurer of
the United States on that day was $12,944,666; that
is, the specie in the deposite banks will fall short
by $2,444 253 of the amount due the Treasurer o'
the United Stites, (without taking into consideration
the $4 574,076 deposited therein to the credit of pub-
lic officers, and who must be equally entitled to
draw the speue ) Now, sir, how is this balance of
$2,444,253 to be paid t It must be drained from
ihe people, or the banks must fail But while the
banks owe the Government $12,944,666, they owe
to private depositors $29,492,113, and to the hold-
ers of their notes $32,62-6,004, and to other banks
$25,083,891, why should the Government recave
in specie the whole amount of their debt, while the
other creditors of the bank recen c nothing' I see
no equity or propriety in such a discrimination. If
banks are not able to pay all the demands against
them in specie, it shou'd be divided equally among
their creditors.
But it may be said that the banks have already
curtailed their discounts, foi thepuipose of meeting
