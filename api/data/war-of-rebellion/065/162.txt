The enemy has been skirmishing with our pickets for some time. Major Manigault reports that their line of battle is 1 mile long and their force heavy. This looks like an assault upon our lines. He says they are evidently about the advance their main lines. I have directed Major Manigault not to sacrifice too many men in an effort to hold such a force long in check. The enemy have cavalry and artillery.

BATTERY Numbers 2. July 6, 1864-1.30 p. m.

Lieutenant-Colonel Brown reports from Secessionville that the enemy's lines of battle remain in the same position, and are apparently of the same length and strength as they were yesterday. A bridge, apparently for foot soldiers only, has been built from battery to this island. Captain Smith, field officer of the day, reports that the enemy have advanced in force across Rivers' Causeway. Now that fog has cleared away, the sentinel at the observatory at this post reports that the enemy's force has not diminished. From the above statements I do not think that the enemy's force on this front has been diminished by sending troops to John's Island, but think the advance on that island was made by other troops.

BATTERY Numbers 2., July 6, 1864-10.30 p. m.

This evening I sent the scout, but buy advises to Major Lucas from Major Jenkins it was thought impossible for the party to cross unobserved. Yates reported a few minutes ago that a large force was embarking in barges at the Swamp Angel Battery, threatening Johnson at once, with others, [in] all 200 men; sent the companies First South Carolina Artillery, the Fifth Georgia Regiment, to Haskell, and am on the alert to re-enforce Secessionville. I sent a small party of cavalry to patrol the Stono above Tynes and on to Pemberton. The force from Georgia was much smaller than represented, and while I would like to have sent more to the places mentioned, your order to hold certain regiments in readiness to John's Island prevented it. I had to send off, as it was, one of the regiments ordered. The enemy is signalling all around us, and it is hard to say where to look to for an attack. I was obliged to keep, with the entire concurrence of Major Echols, the bureau clerks until morning.
