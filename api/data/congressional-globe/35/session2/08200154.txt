APPENDIX TO THE .CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
[February 10,
35th Cong....2d Sess.
These figures are taken from fhe correspondence
between Mr. Rives and Mr. Moore, in 1854. I
nave not had time to get certified statements from
the proper officers-, but I presume they are cor-
rect.
The expenses for the same objects were con-
siderably less for the Thirtieth Congress. The
House then took one half only of the number of
copies now taken; and hence a less amount was
paid. The reporting and Globe for the Thirty-
Fourth Congress cost the Government the sum of
$231,496 00. This may be seen in detail, by ref-
erence to the certified statements of the Secretary
of the Senate, and of the Clerk of the House,
■which I submit:
Office of the Secretary of the Senate,
December 11,1858.
Sir : I have the honor to transmit a statement piepared
in compliance with your lequcst of the 8th instant, show-

The reporting and Globe, for the first session of
the Thirty-Fifth Congress alone, cost the Govern-
ment the sum of £1S0,535 47. I will give it in de-
tail:
House reporting $19,938 09
One cent e\tia allowance  10,'l'9 84
Senate icpoiung  7,834 54
One cent extra allowance  10,*211 52
Copies fot the f!o(w>  31,701 00
Copies ior liie fSeuate  59,5294 98
One hundred copies for libraiy      1,155 f>0
Huidnm—ailogethei   31,117 60
Extia compensation to the icportcis  0,800 00
.<*! 80,535 47
The Secretary of the Senate says that there
was a further amount paid at the Treasury De-
partment , of which he has no account. The round
sum for these objects may be set down at ^182,000
for the first session of the Thirty-Fifth Congress.
An average eost for this session would be about I
$83,000, which would make for the Congress the
sum of $265,000, or an increase over the last
Congress of §44,003 10; and an increase for these
expenses over the Thirty-Second Congress, of
$135,000.
On examination I find that the Secretary of the
Senate has embraced some payments in his item of
$59,294 28, other than the copies of the Globe, and
binding thp same, for the first session of the Thir-
ty-Fifth Congress. The regular number taken by
the Serrate is five thousand eigift hundred cm"d
fourteen, which would amount to $34,884, which,
with the binding, would make $49,154 76. There
is, therefore, an error in that item of $10,139 52.
This amount was carried into the account for
last session from an unsettled balancc of the pre-
ceding year, and is an error of the Secretary in
charging to the first session of this Congress,
the balance due from the former account.
This increase has taken place in the period of
six years, which shows the annual increase to be
$22,500. For this, Congress is alone to blame.
Previous to the Thirty-First Congress, the House
ordered twelve copies only of the Globe for each
member; but at the Thirty-First Congress the
number was increased to twenty-four for each
member and Delegate. The Senate then took
seven hundred and forty-four copies only; but
during the Thirty-Thinl Congress, the Senate or-
dered five thousand and twenty-two copies, in
addition to twelve copies for each member.
This unnecessary addition to the number of
copies greatly increased the expense, and con-
sequently the profits, of the official reporter and
publisher. But a still larger draft was made upon
the liberality of the Government during the Thir-
ty-Fourth Congress, when, at the solicitation of
the official reporter, a small section was inserted
into the " appropriation bill for certain civil ex-
penses," which gave him an additional compen-
sation of one cent for every five pages over three
thousand for the long session, and fifteen hun-
dred for the short session. This apparently petty
allowance, which Senators at the time supposed
would amount to a few hundred dollais only,
amounted to the sum of $24,394 97 for the Thir-
ty-Fourth Congress, and $20,391 36 for the first
session of this Congress. (See statements BB
and D.)
1 will not pretend to calculate the profits made
by the official reporter. The fault is not with him,
but in Congress. It may not be improper, how-
ever, to insert the propositions of other parties,
equally competent to discharge the duty, to show
that the amount paid is too large, and that theie
is needless extravagance in the matter. Piopo-
sitions from pubhsheis in this city show that they
aie willing to do the same service for thirty per
cent, lesjy than the sum now paid:

Sir: In anewer to >ours of tin.-; dare, lequesting me to
Ptate the amount at which I would be willing toieport,
punt, and bind the Congressional Globe, compaiod with
the puce - paid at present lor the panic. I would ret-pectiuliy
voph, that aMer a careful estimate of the work, I can safely
say, that I would be pleased tocontiaet ior the performance
of rhe same at thirty pei cent, less titan the puces, now pain,
and should consider it one of the bovt business op ir t3ona
I had ever engaged m.
Yeiy re.^pectiully, your obedient servant,

Washington, January 1$, 1859.
Dear Sir : fn answer to voui inquiry, " at what puce will
you execute the lcporting and punting of the proceedings
and debates in Cougre&s, a  now executed," i make uie
following pioposal:
I will punt a daily paper, and dehvei one co/i.t/to each
Senator and member ot the Hmi-o of Representaiivos. the
columns and type to ne the same size of the Daily Globe,
and bung out the pioceedmes ot each dav on the morning
following, including leportinsr, for .*7 50 per column, (he
j i< e hou' paid for the saive work, and furni-h Congress with
the same numhei of copies they now take of the Const es-
Hionai Globe and Appendix, at a reduction of twenty per
cent, upon the price now paid; or I will furnish the work
complete, bound in the same style it is now bound, foi the
same mice now paid for the. v oik m sheets, which i* a I edue-
l ion of from t>t enhj-t>co to tnevln the per cent upon the
puce now paid loi punting and binding the Congressional
Globe and Appendix.
Tne prices iieie piopo^ed will enable me to fmni-di the
woik on paper equal m quality to thnt now used, and com-
ply, m every respect, with the i equipments of Congress as
to dispatch, &e.; and I uii! give suiticient bond and se-
cuiitj faithfully to comph with this piopos-ition, and that I
will not call upon Congre^ fo increase my pay per column,
per pnge, per copy, or in any other ioim, A-no'/-m?,fiom my
knowledge of the work, that the puces named will lie amply
sufficient to pay me well for the time and capital invented.*
Respectfully, LEM. TOWERS.
Hon. George Taylor.
It will be seen that Mr. Towers does not refer
to the extra allowance of one cent for the addi-
tional pages, which would also be saved under
this proposition. -This would bej at least, |30.000
per ttongresm
