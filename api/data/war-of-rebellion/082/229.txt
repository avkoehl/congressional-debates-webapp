HANCOCK'S HEADQUARTERS

July 14, 1864.

General WARREN:

Please notify me at what you propose to relieve Smyth's brigade, so I can give the necessary instructions to General Gibbon as to the balance of his line.

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,July 14, 1864-1 p.m

General HANCOCK:

I shall relieve Colonel Smyth this afternoon if my proposed contraction of our lines in approved; at any rate if I can.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,July 14, 1864-2 p.m.

General HANCOCK:

General Meade has just directed where the new picket-line is to be established, and I cannot now say when I will be able to have it done, as it is somewhat outside of General Ferrero's, with which I had intended to connect at once. I shall, in order to expedite matters, visit the proposed line myself, and also see Generals Crawford and Ferrero. I will inform you as soon as I can when the new line will be established, and hope it may be done this evening.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,July 14, 1864-9.45 p.m.

General HANCOCK:

Your dispatch has perhaps been incorrectly sent. Do you mean that when General Gibbon's division arrives at the Dunn house the First and Third Divisions will cease work?

C. H. MORGAN,

Lieutenant-Colonel.

[JULY 14, 1864.]

Colonel MORGAN:

General Gibbon's division will go to work now, and when his troops arrive the First and Third Divisions will quit work.

WINF'D S. HANCOCK
