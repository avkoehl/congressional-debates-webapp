HDQRS. SECOND DIVISION, SEVENTH ARMY CORPS,Devall's Bluff, August 27, 1864--9 p. m.

Captain C. H. DYER,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Little Rock:

CAPTAIN: Some citizens reported this afternoon that the prisoners passed through Hickory Plains. If Shelby has gone north would it not be best immediately to send up the Gun-boat 30, Captain Grace, which is here, and a hundred men or so on the Celeste? Information might be gained and they would, perhaps, be just in season for General West. In this event an infantry regiment should move here, say the Fifty-seventh U. S. Colored, of Graves' brigade.

Very respectfully,

C. C. ANDREWS,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
HDQRS. SECOND DIVISION, SEVENTH ARMY CORPS,Devall's Bluff, Ark., August 27, 1864.

Captain C. H. DYER,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

An officer of the Third Michigan has just returned from Colonel Clark's command. Yesterday afternoon the Ninth Kansas, dismounted, charged across Cypress Bayou bridge, dislodging the enemy's rear guard, which was quite strong. The Ninth lost 3 men killed. The enemy was pursued for several miles, heavy skirmishing being kept up. The bearers of dispatches to Colonel Clark were met; also Colonel Garrett; all safe. The railroad train which passed this point last night ran off the track nine miles this side of the Bluff. The dispatches for General Canby were delivered to General Andrews. The last dispatches for General Andrews which were sent by courier were met some miles this side the Bluff.

A. ENGELMANN,

Commanding Brigade.

is reported that some of our wounded yet remain on the battle-field, that some of the dead are not buried. If this is so have the matter tended to at once.
