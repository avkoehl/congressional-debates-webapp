REMARKS OF MR. PETRIKIN,
OF PEMSS\ LVAMA
In. the  Home of Representatives, May  15,   1840—
On the bill lor the remission of duties on goods
consumed by fire m the city of New York.
Mr PETRIKIN said, that he had been so far a
silent observerof the progress of this bill. He had
looked with astonishment more than once, during
the time he had been a member on this floor, at the
flagrant want of consistency between the profes-
sions and votes of member . He, however, never
had wi'ne sed a greater degree of inconsistency in
any case than in the votes just given. The gen-
tlemen who compose the party opposed to the Ad-
ministration, are continually denouncing it both on
thin floor and berore the people, as extravagant
and wasteful. Neverthe ess, those gentlemen are
always found the foremost in concocting and ad-
vocating means to take the money out of the Trea-
sury. In the present ease they aie, with a very
few exceptions, recording their names for a bill
which must take mt'hons of dol'ars from the Trea-
sury, to go into pockets of merchants in New York,
who are, no doubt, principally foreigners, or their
agents Yes, very probable there are some of
them of that ''gang of Yorkshire merchants," cf
whom we have heard so much said on a late occa-
sion on th s floor. But be they who they may, the
question is, what claim Save they in law or equity
ft r ihe mot ey this, bi 1 proposes to give them.
Every ¿ísinieiested man must say, none. If they
insured the r goods at otlices that were unable to
pay for the lo*>% that was their own fault, not the
fault cf tne Govern r>er t.
Let gentlemen look at the votes on this bill, and
see who ihey are, ard to what party eisht tenths of
those belong, who ate not only willing to vote
awav this large amount of money, but are anxieus
to bring it through without inquiry, debate, or dis-
cussion It will be found that they are those who
wish to make the people believe that economy is a
part of their creed, and that they detrst extrava-
gance, when, in reality, their Saeta here, on all oc-
casions, coLtradict their professions -before the peo-
ple.
Mr. P. said the time was come when the people
should be informed on this subject. When they
get that information they will speak aloud; Ihey
will examine how ihe ¿cts of gentlemen on this
floor accord with their proles ions elsewhere.
We have heard a great cry about ihe Tieasury
being bankrupt, and yet gentlemen engaged in this
cry are willing to pa^s this bill to pay away money
without restriction or limits, and where none is
due. Those same men were unwilling to vote the
money necessary for the support of Government,
but have no difficulty, when asktd to vole millions
t) foreign merchants. We have been daily an-
noyed, on all occasions, b> their denunciations of
the Administration and the De nocratic party, as
being corrupt and extravagant, and there can be no
doubt, it we pass üns bill, that in ihe course of a
year we shall have this very measure held up a-s
one ot the corrupt ard extravagant acts of the Ad-
ministration, by the very men who are now voting
for it.
Have they any rori'c ence' Or do they sup-
pose the people are fools, that ihey will not compre-
hend such a total di^repard of common honeste,
such a contradiction of professions by actions' If
pentlemen thirk so, I cin assure ihem they are
mis'aken. Thf peop'e are watching iheir move-
ments, and will show them that al hough slow to
act, that action will be >-ure Mr. P. called upon
the kw Democrats who voted with ihe Whigs on
this occasion, not to abandon their principles. One
of the maxims of Democracy n "equal and exact
justice to all men " Is it just or right to take
trom ihe Treasury the money of ihe peop e, and
give it to these who have no juít c aim to it1 If
millions are thus to be taken from the Treasury,
