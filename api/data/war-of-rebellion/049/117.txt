YORKTOWN, August 31, 1863.

General NAGLEE,

Norfolk:

Colonel Onderdonk reports following information derived from contrabands:

Wise is 2 miles below Bottom's Bridge, with 4,000 infantry, 900 cavalry, and 8 guns.

I send the information for what it is worth.

Expedition starts to-morrow from Gloucester. Our loss was all in Fifth Pennsylvania Cavalry.

I. J. WISTAR,

Brigadier-General.

NORFOLK, VA., August 31, 1863.

General WISTAR,

Yorktown:

Colonel Onderdonk will not be permitted to go to Matthews Court-House unless you know there can be no force of the enemy to intercept his return.

If you have reason to believe the cavalry and conscripts can be intercepted east of Gloucester Court-House, you must send with him one or two infantry regiments, with one or two sections of artillery, to remain at Gloucester for his return.

HENRY M. NAGLEE,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

YORKTOWN, VA., August 31, 1863-7. 15 p. m.

General NAGLEE,

Norfolk, Va.:

I cannot spare of my effective strength more than 300 infantry to go to Gloucester Court-House. If that will not answer, I must give up the expedition. Please answer immediately, as Onderdonk is crossing now.

I. J. WISTAR,

Brigadier-General.

NORFOLK, VA., August 31, 1863.

General WISTAR,

Yorktown:

If there is any confirmation of the advance of General Wise, you will send Onderdonk to check and observe his advance.

NAGLEE,

Brigadier-General.
