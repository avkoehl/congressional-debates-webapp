to sustain hire > his effort to sepaiate tin ptuti g
of the House fro n eJi'ors of ne i spapTs, i hi se

ramt'c 1 and hoioiible men He had no idea of
continuing pationage to a «et of men who had
raised one of the most odious despotisms p"er held
over a free people A gentleman from Virginia
had a few ) cars ago submitted a scheme foi sepa-
rating the printing of Congress fiom the newspa-
per pres.s, and he hoped gentlemen would now see
the necessity of adopt ng this project He hid no
idea i if pafonizmg ed tors, who «ere aided b/
Executive bounty, 1 ldgrewnch from tne plunder of
the people. It was time for the House o take this
ma'ter into consideration, and sepaiate itself as
much as possible fiom the partisan press of the
day It was proposed to limit the operation of
this resolution to the third Moi div in September,
but he desired himscli to fiee ¡he House ept re'y
from the excitement, consequent upon the election
of a public pnntci He hid no icka that this
House should be engaged for da) s in a misoablc
scramble loi the election ot a man 01 set ot men
to do the pi ntmg of the House, meiely because
they w ere cd ors ot political pipers. The mattei
ol ckctionof printer had giown to be a matter of
as much lmpoitince as the election of a Speakei of
the Hou e, and would continue to cieatc anji-
proper excitement, so loii" as the printing was con-
nected with the political pre s of the country

Mi PICKEIsS inquired if there was not a pto-

Mr. McKAY read from it the words "when

Mr PICKETS Then under that provision

Mr BRIG&S « as opposed both to the  i s< lution
and the amendmeiil, becmse it appe ireil to him to
be an evasion if not a d ii.ee \ tolation, ot a statute

that the country tia« myolved liditfieuit , and he
was in favor of the speedy action of Co gicss on
the subject, in order to proeid  a remedy for the
evil. The object oí die gentleman fiom New York
in submitting the resolution, he had no doubt, was
to dispose of the question of the election of ountcr
as speedily as possible, with a vieyy to faciliu te the
business of the House, and it appeaiel toiiim that
this ought to be the debite of ei cry ge ítleman here
It seemed to him that the resolution, as modi-
fied by the gent'eman from South Carolina,
(Mr. Pickens) ought to n eet the concurrence of
every gentleman on the floor t f the House This
resobidon held out an inducement to eisiy cditoi
or printer m the community to subm t proptsa's,
and the emit.act mu t be made with the person who

that we might go on and oigii izo speedily, "o that
we might, if poss ble, unite m accomplishing the
great objects /or wh eh we w eie assembled He
cared not who wis elected printei He, to be
sure, hid his fnends, as he doubted not e\eiy mil
in that House had, but whpn we siw so many con-
flicting interests, we ought to comptoniist The
plan proposed by the resolution, as mod fled by the
gentleman from ^outh Caiulm, he considered t' e

hoped it would be adopted, so tint we m ght pir-
