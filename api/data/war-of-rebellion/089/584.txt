GENERAL: The plank road station reports:

At sundown 1,100 infantry came in from the west through works to the right of large fort west of Weldon railroad, halted in camp vacated this p. m. Two pieces of artillery came up from Warren's front as far as large fort and field westward and disappeared woods. Infantry, in squads of two and there, have been leaving works at different points from lead-works toward the left (our left), and joining the main force to the left. The column reported in line between works and woods south of large fort is still there.

The enemy seems to be uneasy west of the Weldon railroad.

Perhaps the movements of drilling and maneuvering in the Ninth Corps may be the cause of this.
