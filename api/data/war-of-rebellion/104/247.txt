HEADQUARTERS OF GENERAL STEELE,April 5, 1865.

Major General E. R. S. CANBY:

GENERAL: We have just captured a telegraph operator who left Blakely to-day. He has a Mobile paper of this date which laments over the capture of Selma by our forces. Twenty-three pieces of artillery were taken, and all the valuable machinery, &amp;c. Dick Taylor, Forrest, and Frank Armstrong made their escape. Sherman defeated Johnston, who fell back on Raleigh, where our forces are now besieging him. I will send you the paper and the operator, who is a shrewd fellow, and can be used to our advance, probably.

F. STEELE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS U. S. FORCES,Before Blakely, April 5, 1865.

Major General E. R. S. CANBY:

In reconnoitering to-day we discovered a point at the head of Minette Bay, hard ground, which commands the river to Spanish Fort. There is a rebel signal station at the point. I spoke to the captured operator about it. He says the rebels feared that we would establish a battery there. We shall complete the investment of Blakely to-night. What was reported as a battery on the enemy's extreme right turns out to be a gun-boat in the river. Garrard moves his brigade on his right to his left, and it may take more than one of Veatch's brigades to fill interval. I hope the 30-pounders will be up soon. Hawkins' men are being hurt and harassed to-day by shells from the gun-boats.

F. STEELE,

Major-General.
