providing they can be procured at Fort Riley, viz: 8,000 cartridges, Star carbine, caliber .52; 5,000 cartridges, Sharps carbine, caliber .52; 5,000 cartridges, Colt army pistol, caliber .44. The above would be sufficient for immediate necessity. Captain Backus, who has recently commanded the post, informs me that he has made requisition for supplies, stores, &amp;c., but they will not reach here in time unless stores are received from Fort Riley.

I have the honor to be, with much respect, your obedient servant,

SCOTT J. ANTHONY,

Major First Cavalry of Colorado.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF NEBRASKA,Omaha, Nebr. Ter., August 13, 1864.

His Excellency A. SAUNDERS,

Governor of the Territory of Nebraska:

Mr. Hay has made application to me for Government transportation for the Territorial arms for Columbus and Grand Island. He informs me that there will not be enough to furnish a load for a Government wagon, and as there will probably be need for use of all the Government transportation in the district for the supplying of the increased number of troops, and as I do not feel authorized to withdraw troops for escort duty without General Mitchell's knowledge, not to trust the wagons without escort, I have felt myself obliged to communicate with General Mitchell before permitting more of the Government transportation to leave here. Pending the reply to this communication could not a wagon be furnished by the Territorial authority to Mr. Hays for these arms?

I am, Governor, your very obedient servant,

JNO. PRATT,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

Brigadier General ROBERT B. MITCHELL,

Cottonwood Springs, Nebr. Ter.:

Captain Davis, at Pawnee Agency, reports that settlers are moving away from Shell Creek, and between his camp and Columbus, and asks protection from him. He says his command is not strong enough to leave his camp. I have directed him to move or remain as ordered by you.

Captain JAMES B. DAVIS,
