Mi   MANN, of New Yoik, rema-ked that this
was a bi'l involving cons derations of tne highest
moment to the nation     It proposed an appropria-
tion of gSOOOOOO  out of tne public Tieasury,
upon gr( unds of at least a doubtful nituie, it a
time, too, wl en, if all the othei demands and ap
propnations were satisfed, theie would not be a
smg'e dollar m tne Tieasury      He had had occa
sion to make some examination of tnese cla ms
He was satisfied that  they rested  on  no just
foundation     If the subject should e\er herea tei
come before the House tor discussion, he thought
| he could demonstrate the impiopriety of paying
tiiem     Al housh many of the citizens of Ins own
| State weie mteiested in  these claim , yet, from
the advanced penod of the session, he hoped the
I House would not be troubled with the investiga
Hon of the sulject at the piesent     Ht therefore
moved to lav the Jill on the table    "

usual couise
Tne SPEAKER ^aid that the motion must be

that the motion o'his colleague, if not withdrawn,
wotld not pievail
Mr MA^Nsaid he was not much conversant
with the tules ofpioceedmg in this House He
thought it possible th t the Chan was in error in
the decisiop JUbt maJe He had supposed it in
oidei at any lime to move to lay a proposition on
the table Howevei, undei the solicitation of
gentlemen, who seemed desirous that this bill
should tak=> the usual cou «e, he would withdraw
i his moiion, and "hould, at the pioper time, move
to commit the b d to the Committee of Ways and
Means

' ever should be, the" it m ght, but in i s mesent
condition the question was one relating to tieaties,
na'ional laws, ard  foieign  mtercoirse, and  its
proper leference, therefore, would be to ti e Com-
mittee on Foreign AíTu s
Mr GILLE1 rema ked that the question in-
volved in this bill rendeied it pioper, m his opin-
ion, that it should go to the Com nittee on the
Judiciary The claims we-e founded u¡ on docu
ments, and the pioper constiuction < f these Jocu-
I mentb was th^ appropriate function of i l gal
committee He there'oie moved to commit the
bill to the Coi lniittee on the Judiciary
Mr FILLMOR.E sa d, as this was a claim j| on
the Govemmen , it should go to the Committee of
Claims It wat> clearly no clum upon a foreign
Government,and consequently the subjectdid not
belong to the Cminiuee on Foieign Relations,
nor was it a judicial question lie read the lule
on the sul ject, ind concluded by moving to com
mit the bill to (he Committee of Cfaims
Mr ARCHFR thought it a waste of the pre-
cious time of the House mad scussion of this
soit Ever/ silject of a similar chi acter had
unifoimlv be°n committed to the Comimtie  on
Foreio-n Relations He was apprehensive that
the bill could no' be acted on at the present ses
sioi , but he rep°it°d that tie subject pioperly
belonged to the Committee on Foieign Relations,
and he hop d it would be t,t once retened to that

I i al pait of the subject i elated to money     it the

and nayb upon tie q íestion of commitlirgthe bdl
to the Committee ol Ways and Means
The House infused to oider the yeas and nays
Mi   VANDERPOEL said there could be no
doubt that the   most  appropriate   committee   to
which tins  bill could be refened, was the Com-
mittee on Foreign Affurs     His colleague [Mi
Minn] had obseived that it was only or mainly
a question of money, a mat er about dollars, but
it was moie tnan this     It involved the qiebtion
whether tre faith of the nation waseithe> exj íessiy
I or impliedly  pledged for the  payment Oi  tuese
cl urns     If pledged, how '    Why, sn , by leason
I of certain results and liabilities springing fiom our
I iclations with a foreign Government     The ques
tion, then, now to be determined was liability, or
no liability   atier that was determired, It would be
I t me enough to institute an inquiry m'o the ways
! and means of satisfying the obligation, if any
, snould be adjudged to exist    Then the legitimate
func ions of the Commutee of Ways ard Means
I could be invoked, but now it was a question
| whether,according to the laws of nations, and our
past rehtions with Fiance, this nation was respon-
sible to its u izens
* [Mr   V   heie read tne '7 h rule of the House,
I to show that this subject matter  did   i ot come
v ltlun the duties of the Committee of Ways and
' Means, as there prese ibed ]
j He sai 1 that wh n he came to act finally upon
this subje-t, it was more than probable that he
woald be found on the sid  of his co"eague, FVIr
M \\,] for he had paid some a'tention to the
J sub)ec, and was n dined to the opinion that the
United States weie not legally or equitably liable
I to these clain ants, l utthis could n it pieclude him
from voting for no o giving the bil1 such a dnec-
tion as he be leved th  iul«s of the Hoase and
