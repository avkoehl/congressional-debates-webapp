WAYS AND MEAN^
Mr Cambreleng, from the Committee of Ways
and Means, made the following report
The Committee of Ways and Means, to whom
were referred various memorials relating to the
Currency and a National Bank, and the report
of the Seciet ry of the Treasury on the Finances,
leeominending fuither piovisionsfor the collec-
tion, site keeping, tiansfer, and disbursement of
the public money, submit the following report
The suspension of specie payments by the banks
throughout the United States, m May last, compel-
led the Secretary of tne Treasury, in obedience to
the Constitution and casting laws, to dispense with
their agency and the use ot their notes, and to em-
ploy the officers of Government as the fiscal agents
of Ins Dtpmment    The banks refused to pay the
iarcc surplus deposited with them in the only me-
dium authorized by  law, and the expenditures of
Government would have beengeneially suspended,
had not the public creditors consented to  receive
then dues m diatts upon banks which paid them
onlv m ineleemable notes
Under ^ucn extraordinary circumstances, it be-
came obviously necessary to devise some mode of
managing oui finances which would prevent smu
lu embarrassments in future The President, ac-
cordingly, in dischaiging his constitutional duty,
r>c nnmeitded, at the la e session, a series of mea-
suies, cilcul ued, is youi committte believe, to
give stibihty to the opt rations of the Treasury,
and, at the same time, to relieve the trade and
banks ot the country ftom a connection mutually
disadvantageous to them and to Government
These recommendations were opposed by the
luends of a Nitional Bank, and by others who de-
sired to renew oui fiscal relations with the State
Bank It was, howevei, admitted that there was
no prospect of the establishment of a national in-
stitution for some ) ears to come, if ever, and the
eiploaion of the Stite bank deposite system was
too recent to winant the expectation of its renewal
at an early period, if at all Notwithstanding,
however, the condition of our finances, and the
urgent necessity 0f some regulation to render our
Treasury independent of banks, and provide addi-
t onal guards foi the sale-keeping of the public mo
nej, the Treasury was left amidst all its embar
rassments The same regulations are again re
commended by the Piesident, and nothing has, m
the meantime, occurred to induce the committee to
change their opinion, that their ddoplion is not
only essential to the safety and independence of the
public Treasury, but to the stability of trade and
of every si und bank in the Union
The events ot the last three \cars have produ-
ced a general eonv etion that the public money
shoul 1 not be em pi ryed by banks or any olhei m-
stiutions, in commercial discounts, however profi
table its use might be to their stockholders Du-
ring the speculations ot 1835 and 18 56, the depo
site banks stimulated speculation to excess, and
in 1837 suddenly withdrew their accommoda-
tions to meet the public demands The accumu-
lation and distribute >n of the surplus were among
the mist powerful causes of thdt alirm which pro-
duced the suspension <f specie payments When
hanksth is rmplty the public money, they deal in
afuniover «hich thej have no control, and Us
constant translcrs and fluctuitions embarrass then
oommcicnl opcrat ons Even Government itself
cannot legLhte its amount, anticipate its fluctúa
tmns, or the demanjs upon the Treasury Under
any system rf revenue, the transactions of Govern-
ment would embarnss trade wherever they are
united Put in this country, the connection is par-
t cularly disastrous, owing to the extraordinary
fluctuations m our revenue Our income is de-
rived from customs and public lands, and is vio-
lently affected by the rapid growth of our wealth,
commerce and population Under our revenue
laws as they have heretofore existed, we hav e rc-
pea'edly had a laige surplus at one moment, and
immediately, after a bankrupt Tr a my By re-
newing the connection with banks, we shall make
the public revenue again instrumental in exciting
speculation, embarrassing trade, and injuring every
class of the community
It is wholly immaterial whether the public money
)•• emploved in trade by State or National bank
agents The pubhc must, m either case, surfer
from the fluctuations of our income, and the occa-
sional efforts of the banks to meet the Treasury de-
mands for transfer or disbursement Had the
Bank of the United States been continued as the
agent of Government, and been called upon, as the
deposite banks were, to repay thirty-seven millions
of dollars in nine months, the shock to trade would
have been more violent, and the suspension of
specie payments would have occurred at an earlier
period The operations of any great institution,
whether State or National, with extensive branches,
and dealing largely in exchange, must convulse the
trade of every countrj where it exists under the
authon'y of Government, and the cunency consists
chiefly of bank notes Its alarms and its efforts
will be m proportion to the extent of its responsibi-
lities, and in every revulsion of trade, its opera-
tions will be watched with apprehension The
magnitude of its transactions gives it the charac-
ter of a Government, and us expansions and
contractions, like the fluctuating revenues of
the public Treasury, violently move the whole
trade of the country alt rnately forward and
backward, leaving at eveiy revulsion distressing
scene   of poverty and bankruptcy The Hade of
no countiy can ever be well regulated when con-
stantly liable lo be distuibed, eithei by the opera-
tions of Government, or of a great and entended
bank, whether State or National Whcrevei the
heavy transactions of both are united, trade must
be subject to frequent alarms and levulsions It
commercial crtdit did not depend on the public
revenue, and no great bank, vainly attempting to
regulate currency and exchanges, existed, two of
the greatest causes of panics would be removed
These would not often occur if trade were left to
its own íesources, to the exclusive and undisturbed
us,e of its own capital and credit, and if it enjoyed
the liberty to create am' manage its own banking
agents, without lequirmg that they should be
clothed with legislative privileges, or armed with
thepoweis of Government Revulsions might still
occur, but they would be less frequent and violent,
and we should at least never witness the extiaordi-
nary spectacle of a laboring population without
employment, m a country enjoying unexampled
prosperity
Such an agency is not only injurious to tiade,
but unjust to other banking institutions By col-
lecting the public revenue, whether m specie or in
bank notes, all other banks are directly or indi-
rectly made tributary to the Treasury agents Their
specie is either drawn from them, or balances are
created which compel them to draw upon their
debtor banks, while the deposite banks are paving
the public disbursements in their own notes Such
undue advantages should be given to no banks,, es-
pecially when the system is otherwise '0 injurious
to trade and to the Treasury
The proposed separation is essential to the steady
and independent action of trade, banks, and Go-
vernment The finances of the latter must become
embarrassed at every revulsion, so long as our le-
vf-nue consists of bank notes or bank deposites
The convertibility of either into specie is wholly
illusive, and has been hitherto sustained by confi
dence alone That confidence is no v destiojel
If a few banks only had suspende 1 spec e pay -
ments from bad management, confidence m o'her
institutions might have been continued Or if, as
in war, Government had deemed it expedient to
boirow their credit and sanction it  abuse, it might
have revived vv ith the return of peace, and the re-
storation of specie payments But it never has
occurred befoie, that, in time of peace and
ammst general prospmity, the banks of a nal on
have simultaneously suspended specie payments,
and, what is far more important, as. it regards the
future, the wishes of the trading community anti-
cipated the action of the banks, the suspension
was hailed as a measure of commercial relief, our
Legislatures sanctioned it, and the pubhc were
compelled to acquiesce Tne effects of the sus
pension were little understood by those who deemed
it a measure o£ relief The trade of no countiy
can be relieved by a sudden reduction of its cur-
rency We had been for twelve months under
the harsh operation of a diminution of com-
meicial and bank credits They had nearly,
if not ciuite, reached that minimum from which,
after a temporary stagnation of trade, they would
