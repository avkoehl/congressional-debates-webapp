General SHERIDAN:

General McCook directs me to say that it is most essential that your baggage train should start at the earliest dawn for the Manchester pike. He directs that you send one regiment along as guard and to help the train along, so that there may be no delay or stalling of the teams on the way, and so that the way can be cleared for troops.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. P. THRUSTON,

Assistant Adjutant-General and Chief of Staff.
