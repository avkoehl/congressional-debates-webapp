Brigadier-General TURNER,Chief of Staff;

GENERAL: Your note has been received. My picket-line has been replaced and there is no evidence of any enemy on this side of the Darbytown road. I believe the enemy to have returned to their intrenchments. If desired, I will send out on the Charles City road, although it is unimportant whether they are there or in their intrenchments. There is no enemy within our lines as held heretofore. I desire permission to order the Eleventh Pennsylvania Cavalry back to their quarters.

Very respectfully, &amp;c.,

AUGUST V. KAUTZ,

Brigadier-General, Commanding Division.
