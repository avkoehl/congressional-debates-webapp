payable quarterly from August 1, 1871, and
would be charged on the books of the Treas-
ury with the amount of interest thereon from
the 1st to the loth of August; in short, each
subscriber to the loan receives interest from
the day certificates of deposit are issued by the
banks to the Secretary, on the terms set forth
in the agreement.
It will be seen by an examination of the
report above quoted, and the testimony of
the Secretary printed with the report of the
majoiity of the Committeeof Waysand Means,
that ''by the last of August, 1871, subscrip-
tions were obtained for the entire amount
offered," and of course the new bonds of the
United States, bearing interest from the dates
of the subscription, have been or will be issued
to the subscribers. It further appears that it
was^ part of the agreement that the notice
calling in the outstanding six per cent, bonds,
and stopping the payment of interest on them
after three months from the date of the notice,
was to be issued at the commencement of each
month for " an amount of bonds equal to the
amount of subscriptions in coin for the pre-
ceding month." As I understand it, theagree-
ment that the money subscribed for the new
bonds should be loaned to or not withdrawn
from the parties subscribing (which means
both in law and fact the same thing) for
ninety days was intended to mean, and did
mean, ninety days from and after the date of
the notice calling in the six per cent bonds.
By the arrangement that the notice should
only issue at the commencement of each month
the subscribers obtained the use of the money
which they subscribed for the new bonds during
all the unexpired portion of the month in
which they made the subscription, in addition
to the three months, and they of course drew
their interest on the bonds subscribed for also:
so that if a subscription was made on the 10th
or 15th of a month, it was an additional two
thirds orhalf of a month duringwhich theGov-
ernment was paying interest both on the new
five and the old six per cent, bonds. I do not
believe that the Secretary had any right under
any law to make such a bargain, or to take the
money of the people to pay eleven per cent,
under such an arrangement.
It will be observed from the report above
quoted, that while the whole amount offered,
say $135,000,000, was subsctibed for before
the last of August, the notice which issued
on the first of September only called in and
Stopped the iuterest upon 3100.000,000 at the
expiration of three months thereafter. No
further notice was issued till December 7,
when $20,000,000 more was called in, and on
the 20th of December, 1871, another $"20,000,-
000 was recalled in three months after the
notices aforesaid. The excuse of the Secre-
tary, and the argument of the majority of the
committee, is that no man holding a six per
cent, bond would surrender it till the interest
had stopped, and therefore the proceeds of the
sales of the five per cents could not be used
till three months after the notice was given.
That being so, and all the $135,000,000 ot new
bonds having been sold before September 1,
why were not $135,000,000 of six per cents
called in instead of $100,000,000. and why
was no further call made till December 7 and
December 20; and why, if subscriptions were
made on the 5th. 10th, or 15th of a month,
was the notice calling in the outstanding bonds
postponed till thefirstofthe succeeding month?
1 can see no reason, except to give the syndic-
ate that much longer use of the money for
nothing, while the interest was running and
.the taxes were being levied to pay it on both
sets of bonds. There was plenty of money in
the Treasury to meet any bonds returned under
any notice at all times after July 14, 1S70.
The Secretary says, (see page 7 of bis last
report:)
"These estimates show a balance applicable to
the payment of the principal of the public debt for
the fiscal year ending June 30,1872, $71,i94,991 68.
And the fourth section of the act of July 14,
1870, provides;
"That ihe Secretary of the Treasury is hereby
authorized, with any coin in the Treasury of the
United States which he may lawfully apply to such
purpose, or which may be derived from the sale of
any of the bonds the issue of which is provided for
m this act, to pay at par and cancel any six per cent,
bonds of the United^ States of the kind known as
five-twenty bondswhich have become or shall here-
after become redeemable by the terms of their
issue."
I understand the meaning of that and the
other sections of the act of July 14, 1870, to
be to make all the surplus gold in the Treasury
equally applicableto the payment, and cancella-
tion ofthe five-twenty bonds which have become
redeemable, as the proceeds of the sale of the
new five per cent, bonds are. and I suppose
there never was a day since the 14th of July.
1870, when there was not from fifty to seventy-
five million dollars of gold in the Treasury,
or in the several depositaries, subject to the
order of the Secretary. I am, therefore, utterly
unable to see, when there were many hundred
millions of the five-twenty bonds redeemable
at the option of the Secretary, why, with
$135,000,000 of new five percent, bonds sold,
as he states in his report, before September 1,
and with over fifty million dollars of other gold
lying idle in the Treasury, he only called in
and stopped interest upon $100,000,000 by his
notice of September 1, 1871, unless it was,
as I said before, to allow ihe syndicate to hold
and use the money for their personal benefit,
while the people were paying interest on both
sets of bonds.
The Secretary has within a day or two past
furnished us with a detailed statement of the
subscriptions made for that portion of the
$200,000,000 new loan which was taken after
the 10th of August last by the syndicate and
the national banks, under his notice and the
agreement heretofore referred to. These de-
tailed statements vary somewhat, or at least
appear to vary from the statements made by
the Secretary in his report and in his evidence
before the committee. They are made part of
the remarks of my colleague on the committee,
[Mr. Keru,] and they show that the national
banks other than Jay Cooke & Co. took of this
loan during the month of August $14,377,300,
and that the First National Bank of Washing-
ton, District of Columbia, (Jay Cooke & Co.'s
bank, called the syndicate.) took S117.510.950.
of which about one hundred and ten million
dollars were taken in August, and about seven
million five hundred thousaund dollars have
been taken siiice. These sums, together wiih j
the $65,775,500 taken by the banks before
August, leave a deficit of $2,328,200 accord-
ing to the detailed statements in making up
the 3200.000,000. I suppose, however, there
is some omission in them, as the Secretary
says in his report to Congress that it was all
taken before the 31st of August, and 1 propose
to assume that to be the fact.
I do not know, and the Secretary says he
does not, who, other than Jay Cooke & Co..
compose the syndicate. Their bank in Wash-
ington was the subscriber for all but $14,377,-
800 taken after August, and the arrangement
was certainly a very advantageous one for them;
as they received under their contract all of
the $1,000,000. or theonehalfof one per cent,
on tiie $200,000,000, except the commission
paid to the banks and the expenses for paper,
engraving bonds &c. I do not know what the
expenses \teie. The gentleman from Indiana
[Mr. KctmJ and myself applied nearly a week
ago to have a statement of the expenses made
out and furnished to us, so as to lay the exact
facts oil the subject before Congress, but it has
not been given to us, and, I do not propose to
accept any guess as to the amount of it. It
could be made out in an hour, I presume, if
it was thought advisable to let Congress and
the country see it. 1 understand theSecre-
tary has not been able to obtain it himself;
why, I do not know.
Assuming what the Secretary says to be
the fact, that the banks were paid a commis-
sion of one quarter of one per cent, on the
$05,000,000 first taken, and one eighth of one
per cent, on the $50,000,000 subscribed by the
banks as such, out of the remaining $135,000,
and the commissions paid the syndicate would
be as follows, subject to the expenses, what-
ever they may turn out to be:
Commission on $65,775,500, at one quarter per
cent..... ยง161,438 75
Commission on S50,0u0,000 at one eighth
per cent,  62,509 00
T . $226,938*75
Leaving the amount to go to Jay Cooke & Co., out
of this portion of the loan, under the agreement,
as to the remnant of the one half per cent, on
$115,775,500  $351,938 75
Paid by Jay Cooke <fc Co., commissions on
$84,224,500, one half per cent  421,122 50
Total to Cooke & Co., (less expenses) $773,061 25
_ Thus Jay Cooke & Co. received as commis-
sion on a subscription for, say, $85,000,000,
over $773,000, less expenses, &e.: while the
banks received $226,938 on their subscription
for $115,775,500. But the great profit to
Messrs. Jay Cooke & Co. in this contract with
the Secretary, in the way it has been managed,
consisted in the loan to or retention by them
of the Government money, while they were
drawing interest on the bonds which they had
purchased with it. Nobody doubts that it was
worth to them at least six per cent., which on
$135,000,000 for the three months is $2,025,-
000, from September 1 to December 1, while
held under contract. But that is not all. They
had it, on an average, say from the 20th of
August, or one third of a month before the
notice of September 1 was given. The interest
for that time ($225,000) must he added. The
Secretary says in his report of December 4
that more than eighty million dollars had
then been received uuder the notice and call
of September 1. If it bad then reached
$81,000,000 he would have said so.
On yesterday he furnished us a memorandum
showing that up to this time, only $86,!)S0,800
of the $100,000,000, on which interest stopped
December 1, under the notice of September
1, had been returned to the Treasury, while
up to yesterday only $1,099,750 had been re-
turned under the notices of December 7 and
December 20. Assuming, what is certainly
too liberal an assumption, that the $83,080,800
of the five-twenty bonds now on hand were all
returned December 1, and the money to pay
for them was then all diawn fiorn the syndic-
ate. and charging them with interest only on
$13,000,000 ofthe $100,000,000 from Decem-
ber 1 till now, it would amount to $130,000.
The $20,000,000 calfed forDecmber 7 runs
till March 7, 1872; interest on that from
December lj 1871, till that date is SS25.000,
and as $15,000,000 ofthe amoBi.; called in by
the notice of December 20, which makes up
the $135,000. will not mature tul March 20,
Messrs. Jay Cooke & Co. have the use of that
until March 20 at least, intufst on which
from December 1 till that d,ite amounts to
$181 250, and how much longer they will hold
it no man can tell. They will retain it till the
bonds called for are returned of course.
The amount the syndica'e has received, or
will necessarily make by the transaction, may
be stated thus:
Commissions (less expenses, amount un-
known)    5773,000
Interest before September 1  2-ยฃ,000
Interest under contract irom September 1
to December 1  2,025,000
Interest aaer December 1 nu $35,lu I.OOJ,
called for under notice of Deteuiber 7
and December 20   ; 506,250
Interest after December 1, on >13,000,000 of
first $100,000,000. till now  130,U00
Total S3,659.250
Making the most liberal allowance for ex-
penses the profit to the syndicate must reach
$3,350,000. It must be" borne in mind that
this immense sum is made by Messrs. Cooke &
Co. in the refunding of less than ยง135,000,000
