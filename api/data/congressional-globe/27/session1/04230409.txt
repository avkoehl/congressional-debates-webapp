Now, sir, said Mr C. th rv can l e no doub}
about toe genuineness <f this paper, the ckrk cer-
tifies that he is acquainted with t^e persons whoso
rumes appear to ih . statement, srd , lso that their
signature   are gei nine.
And what ep< lopy hss the Postma tei General
for )i curag  rct only upon Col HoUp, tut up-
on the community m which he li.r-.? Did he take
| the ordinary bv ans of ascertaining, either the
gen 'mi n^ s of the paper, 0! the truth of the facts
it contc-ineu'! Da a- call on h- dei aatton from
the State, or any one of them, U know ho one or
the othet12 No sir. I know he did not cab on me,
nor did he call on any one of my colleagues, as I
km informed. He took no íe ot 0 e ord nary
means to satisfy himseii whahe- th- removal
would be right or wrong, but, availing himsel'' of
the colorable apology furnished by this forjed pa-
per, he has removed from olice a man of unques
tionabie capacity and urnT^eaeii be euarae'er.
Such a man as the Postmaster bereral has thus
shown htmse 1 to b , is not ti e officer to whom a

ment within three jears to remátate ¡he sum in the
Tre?stry If this b not mad^ a coDdition of the
grant, ti f re will be no curb on the expenditures of
the Department Do we not all know how dif-
ficult n is to make the Department keep down us
expenditures, and wi 1 not th" difficulty be increased
by this bill in its present form? The prudence
and propriety of the amendment mun be so ob-
vious that he (Mr. C ) should say no more on the
subject
Mr. WOODBURY observed that he would sta'e
a circumstance, for ihe purpose of preventing any
gtn ltinin vo.ing against the amendment under a
misapprehension that the Treasury was wdeb ed
a million of dollars to ihe Post Office Depar ment.
The Tieasuiy did not owe one .dollar to the Post
OfiVe D paitment. Ti e Treasury had for forty
>tar, paU all iht. expenses of the Post Office, thi
b lanc^ «as thererore m tivor of the Treasury.
