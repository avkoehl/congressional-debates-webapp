Lieutenant HANNAHS,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General:

No troops of General Pike's command arrived last night. Battery A, Second Missouri Artillery, can be in Saint Louis to-morrow evening if permitted to go by turnpike. If guns and caissons have to go on cars it will take several days longer, as all the capacity of the railroad will be used to transport to Saint Louis 100-days' men. Will order the One hundred and fortieth Illinois, stationed at Fenton Bridge, to march to Saint Louis on foot. How shall I send Battery A?
