One addressed to Honorable William Smith, attorney, &amp;c., Warrenton, Va., says: "I am informed that General McClellan says war is now to be fought [with] artillery and especially heavy guns. I hope you will meet him with as long and as large guns as he brings against you. * * * If employment could be had but fewwould go against the South. " An order was issued from the Department of State dated September 30, 1861, directing Lieutenant-Colonel Burke commanding at Fort Lafayette, &c., to release Grove on his taking the oath of allegiance and giving his parole of honor to do no act hostile to the United States. He was released October 8, 1861. -From Record Book. State Department, "Arrests for Disloyalty. "

NEW YORK, August 15, 1861.

Mr. JAMES A. GROVE, Stevensburg, Va.

MY DEAR BROTHER: Your welcome favor of July 27 was received this morning. It is postmarked Franklin, Ky. Write soon again and often and forward as before. * * * The habeas corpus case before Judge Garrison, of Brookly, Long Island, shows how completely the military is overrriding the civil power in the North under a Northern political abolition administration of the Federal Government. Counsel in this case, Messrs. Algernon R. Wood, formerly of Frederick County, Va., and I. C. Vanloon, Mr. Wood intends to apply for a writ in the case of Austin E. Smith, esq.,* son of ex-Governor Smith, of Warrenton, Va. Mr. Smith is confined in Fort Lafayette, and I suppose ex-Minister Charles James Faulkner,# who has just been arrested in Washington will be taken there also. Fort Lafayette stands in New York Bay about eight miles below the city and in the immediate vicinity of Fort Hamilton, Kings County, Long Island. Colonel Martin Burke, formerly of Virginia, is in command, as you will see from the papers. He acts according to orders from Washington. I have been down to the fort but no one can see or communicate with any of the prisoners. The sheriff of Kings County can lawfully collect a force sufficient to compel obedience to the decision of Judge Garrison but it is a matter of doubt whether it will be done. We will see. Have written to ex-Governor Smith.

The great battle of Manassas was a terrible one indeed. The loss was dreadful on both sides but the triumps of the South was complete and overwhelming. No such victory has been gained during the present century. General Scott's army was 55,000 strong, thoroughly armed and equipped for the contest, but it was utterly wrecked and ruined at Manassas. There is now a great deal of crimination and recrimination among the officers and men. The officers charge the defeat upon the men and the men in turn charge the defeat upon the officers. Many regiments are charged with cowardice. The Fire Zouaves, the Fourteenth and Eighth Regiments of this States and the Fourth Regiment of Pennsylvania came in for a large portion of severe condemnation. The officers of the Fourteenth Regiment of Brooklyn upon their return a few days ago had a terrible fight among themselves.

Recruiting or re-enlisting is now uphill work. Bounties of from $30 to $50 are offered and but few are willing to go. None would go if employment could be had. This abolition war has ruined the country and men must go to war or starve. All the soldiers that have returned are loud in complaints of severe treatment and have great difficulty of
