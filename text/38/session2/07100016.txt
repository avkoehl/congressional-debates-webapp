and 1,574,500 newspaper wrappers, amounting to
$31,490, were issued. The total value of these
issues was $10,974,329 50, which, compared with
the issue of the previous year, ($10,338,760,)
shows an increase of §635,569 50, or about 6J per
cent. T'he value of the stamps and stamped envel-
opes fold was $10,776,589 58, and the amountwsed
in the prepayment of postage was$9,878,155 61.
The details are exhibited in tables Nos. 3 and 4
of appendix.
Notwithstanding this enormous issue, the losses
of stamps in the mails amounted only to $1,206,
and of envelopes to $31 80. This result may be
in partattributed to the system of registering each
package of stamps and envelopes mailed, and to
the fact that route agents and postmasters at sep-
arating offices are also instructed to keep a recoid
of all such packages passing through their offices.
During the year 1859, (the year immediately pre-
ceding the adoption of this system of registration,)
the value of postage stamps issued amounted to
65,279,405, while the losses in transmission dur-
ing the last six months of that period were $4,373.
Since that time the losses have decreased, although
the issue has increased about 92| per cent.
The number of packages of stamps sen t out dur-
ing the year was 58,500, of stamped envelopes
18,688,and the claims allowed for deficiencies in
the number of stamps amounted to only $29, and
in the stamped envelopes 80 cents, showing great
care on the part of those intrusted with this branch
of the business.
Postage stamps are regularly supplied to the
armiesof the Potomac and Cumberland, through
Bpecial agents of the Depat tment located at or near
the headquarters of each. Since the inauguration
of this practice—about the 1st of July last—the
agent stationed at City Point, Virginia, has sold
stamps amounting to $29,773 96, and the agent of
the army at Chattanooga $5,210.
Under the act for "the relief of postmasters
who have been robbed by confederate forces or
rebel guerrillas," one hundred and thirty-nine
claims have been made, representing losses of
postage stamps and money amounting ill the ag-
gregate to $5,958 97. Of the claims thus re-
ported, sixty-two have been examined and re-
ported on favoiably, the aggregate of the credits
allowed being $2,130 50. The balance of the
claims—seventy-seven—representing $3,828 47,
are still pending, the evidence furnished being m
most cases insufficient.
Losses of a somewhat different character fre-
quently occur, relief for which cannot be granted
without additional legislation. I refer to cases
where, by reason of tfie presence of armed forces,
a post office is destroyed, and the postmaster
loses the' fixtures and furniture, and to cases
where the loss is occasioned by our own troops.
The report of my predecessor two years since
recommended that such losses be provided for,
and 1 invite attention to the subject, as several
such claims have been made, where the losses
have occurred through no faultof the postmaster.
During the last session of Congress a bill was
passed for the relief of the contractor for fur-
nishing the Department with stamped envelopes
and newspaper wrappers; under the provisions
of which the existing contract expired on Sep-
tember 11, 1864, when a conditional contract was
made, to expire December 31, 1864, at an ad-
vanced rate for stamps and envelopes.
After the award of the contract above referred
to, the Department and the contractor received a
protest from a party in New York claiming to be
the patentee of newspaper wrappeis, with notice
that he should assert his rights. Under these
circumstances, and in view of the enormous ad-
vance in the contract price of the article, the De-
partment decided to discontinue the issue for the
present.
Notwithstanding the advance of every article
used in the manufacture of stamps, and the large
increase in the number required by the Depart
merit, the National BankNote Company,of New
York, have fulfilled in a satisfactory manner all
their obligations. It is due to these contiactors
to add that they receive for postage stamps but
twelve cents per thousand, while the contractors
for internal revenue stamps receive thirty-three
cents per thousand.
Seven temporary clerks have been employed
for several year?, who are paid out of the appro-
priation for postage stamps and stamped envel-
opes, and as they constitute a portion of the ne-
cessary force of the Department, I suggest the
propriety of providing for them by law.
CONTRACTS.
Table A (No. 5) exhibits the service as it stood
on the 30th of June last in the States of Maine,
NewHampshire,Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode
Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey,
Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Ohio,West
Virginia, Michigan, Indiana, Illinois,Wisconsin,
Iowa, Missouri, Minnesota, Kentucky, Califor-
nia, Oregon, Kansas, and the Territories of New
Mexico,Utah, Nebraska, Washington, Colorado,
Dakota, and Nevada, at which time there were
in operation in those States and Territories 6,083
mail routes, the number of contractors being
5,953. The length of these routes was 139,173
miles, and the service as follows, namely:
Railroad,22,616miles; steamboat, 7,278miles;
" celerity, certainty, and security," 109,278 miles
—costing $5,818,469, divided as follows, namely:
railroad, 23,301,942 miles of transportation at
$2,567,044, about 11 cents a mile; steamboat,
2,112,134 at $253,274, about 12 cents a mile;
"celerity, certainty, and security," 30,901,281
at $2,998,151, about 9 7-10 cents a rnile-
The length of routes was decreased 425 miles,
while there was an increase in the annual trans-
portation of 89,342 miles, and in the cost of
$77,893.
The aggregate compensation of route agents,
local agents, mail messengers, baggage masters
in charge of express mails, and agents employed
on steamers conveying mails to southern ports,
was $546,753 48, which, added to the cost of ser-
vice in operation on 30th June, 1864, ($5,818,469,)
makes tiie total cost of mail transponation at that
date $6,365,222 48.
The contract term for the middle section,com-
prising the States of New Jersey, Pennsylvania,
Delaware, Maryland, and Ohio, expired on the
30th of June last, and the new term commenced
on the 1st of July following. The service under
these lcttmgs.for the first quarter of the contract,
ended September 30, 1864, is exhibited by the
annexed statement, namely:

tract office, arc appended to this report. (See No.

Notwithstanding an express provision of law,
(section twenty-nine ofact ofjuly 2,1836,) which
provides " that no person whose bid for the trans-
portation of the mail may be accepted shall re-
ceive any pay until he shall have executed his
contract according to law and the regulations of
the Department," but few of the railroad compa-
nies engaged in carrying mails are under contract;
and the practice of recognizing their service from
quarter to quarter has been necessary for a series
of years, to enable the Auditor to issue orders in
favor of the companies, for the collection of mon-
eys in the hands of postmasters on the routes, and
the adjustment of accounts for services rendered.
Attention has been called to this subject by my
predecessors for the purpose of securing additional
legislation investing the head of this Department
with power to compel compliance with the law
by prohibiting payments except on executed con-
tracts. The matter is discussed by Postmaster
General Holt in his report of December 3, 1859,
and again alluded to December 1, 1860, and also
by my immediate predecessor-in his reports of
December2, 1861,and December 1,1862; but,be-
lieving that the law is sufficiently explicit as it now
stands, I do not propose further legislation, in the
hope that the several railroad companies will no
longer refuse to enter into the obligations assumed
by all other persons contracting with the Govern-
ment. Should I be disappointed in this reason-
able hope, I shall not fail to call upon Congress
for such legislation as the necessities of the service
require.
In the lastannual report attentionwas called to
the unsettled accounts of persons employed to
convey mails by sea to the military and naval
forces and inhabitants at New Oi leans, Pensacola,
and other ports, rendered necessary by the insur-
rection in the southern States, and also for ser-
vice performed in steamships on the North Pa-
cific coast during the winter of 1802, when the
usual land routes were interrupted by extraordi-
nary floods. These services were necessary to
provide for communication with the soldiers and
sailors engaged in the defense of the country, and
the people isolated by an act of Providence, and
were authorized by several acts of Congress. The
Auditor of the Treasury for this Department, ad-
judging the contracts illegal, declined acting on
the accounts of contractors and orders of the Post-
master General, rendering an appeal to Congress
necessary. This resulted in the legislation con-
tained in the fifth section of the " act to provide
for the conveyance of mails to foreign ports,"&c.,
approved March 25, 1864, under which the sum
of $18,050 has been paitl to several parties for the
sea service performed by order of the Postmaster
General on the Atlanticcoast and Gulf of Mexico,
to the 30th of September last.
The claim made by the steamship owners for
service on the North Pacific coast, during the
floods of 1862 on the land, was at the rate of
$8,000 per month for three months, buttheamonnt
deemed adequate by the Department was $8,042
for the whole service, and this was the sum re-
poited to the Auditor as due the claimants; but
Congress having fixed the sum to be paid fortius
service at $1,500, which they declined to receive,
the claim is still unadjusted.
The contract for service on the route from the
Missouri river, via Salt Lake, to Placerville, Cal-
ifornia, under act of March 2, 1861, expiring on
the 30th of June last, an arrangement was made
with the same parties for continuing the service
on the same terms to September 30,1864.
Under an advertisement dated March 22, 18G4,
inviting proposals forservice from Atchison, Kan-
sas, or St. Joseph, Missouri, to Folsom City,
California, John H. Heistand,of Lancaster, Penn-
sylvania, was the lowest bidder, at $750,000 per
annum; but his bid having been subsequently
withdrawn, contracts have been made with Ben.
Holladay, of New York, for the service between
Atchison, or St. Joseph, arid Salt Lake City, at
$365,000,and with W. B. Dinsmore, prestdentof
the Overland Mail Company, also of New York,
from Salt Lake City to Folsom City, at $385,000,
making an aggregate of $750,000 per annum.
These parties are believed to be able to fulfill their
obligations. The contracts are from October 1,
1864, to September 30,1868; the trips to be made
in sixteen days eight months in the year, and in
twenty days the remaining four months; to con-
vey through letter mails only, mail matter pre-
paid at letter rates, and all local or way mails.
Paper and document mails for the Pacific coast
are to be carried by sea, via New York and Pan-
ama, temporary arrangements having been made
for their conveyance, within the sum named m the
law of March 25,1864, namely: $160,000 per an-
num; makingthe whole expense of territorial and
Pacific mails not over $910,000 per annum, or
$90,000 less than under the former contract.
Owing to Indian depredations, the overland
service was much interrupted during the months
of August and September last, and, for a period of
four or five weeks, the whole mail for the Pacific
coast and the Territories was necessarily sent by
sea from New York.
The contract for the California and Oregon
route—Sacramento to Portland—terminating Sep-
tember 16, 1864, proposals were invited for the
continuance of the service to 3866 and 1868. But
one bid was received, that of the California Stage
Company, at $250,000 per annum, which was
deemed extravagant for the service required, and
accepted to June 30, 1865, only, with a view to
again invite competition, which has teen done.
Pursuant to the eighth section of the act of
March 2, 1861, and the second section of the act
of February 24, 1863, the contract for service on
the route from St. Cloud, Minnesota, to Pembina,
in Dakota Territory, was extended to June 30,
1865, and the trips tncreased from one to two per
week, at an increase of compensation of $17,167
per annum. As the contracts on all other routes
m the State expire June 30, 1866, this will be re-
