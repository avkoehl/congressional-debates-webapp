Mr. BENJAMIN. I am not opposing the
appropriation; but I do make the point oforder
that the amendment is not in order to this bill
at this time, for the reason that there is no law
authorizing this work to be done.
Mr. LOGAN. There are a great many ap-
propriations made in this bill for which there
are no existing laws authorizing them.
Mr. BENJAMIN. If all points of order had
been reserved the appropriations to which the
gentleman refers eouid have been ruled out;
but as the appropriations were reported from
the committee and no points of order were
reserved, they have been retained. I make the
point of order on this amendment, and there
is no other question before the House.
Mr. LOGAN. Itis as much authorised under
existing laws as other appropriations. Seventy-
five thousand dollars were expended on this
work many years ago, and the Bureau of Kn-
gineers, when the amount came to be distrib-
uted Inst year under the general appropriation
bill, was authorized by the Secretary of War to
p-tpend S80.000 on the Illinois river ; and why
was this? Because the engineers thirty years
ago expended $75,000 on the improvement of j
the same river. It came within the regulations ■
which were then adopted ; and because $75,000
were formerly appropriated, $80,000 were ex- |
pended last year for the continuation of the j
same work without any special provision of law |
whatever. That being the construction, then, 1
that this work was authorized by law, I do not '
know why the same construction will not apply
at this time, and this appropriation be held to
be as much in pursuance of law as_ any other
which has been made. The committee failed
to put the appropriation in the bill because,
as we have been told, it was not presented for
their consideration early enough. When 1 say
the committee, I mean that I was so iniortned
by one of the committee. 1 now ask that it be
inserted in the interest of ship-owners and m
the interest of the great commerce of Lake
Michigan as well as of the commerce ot the
other lakes. I ask the honorable gentleman
iiom Buffalo [Mr. Bexxett] whether he did
not lose a vessel because ot the very diflicutty
to which I have alluded? If there be a just
appropriation in this hill, then there can be no
good ground for refusing the amendment winch ;l

Mr. BENJAMIN. I demand a decision on ,|
iiiv point of order. .... II
The CHAIRMAN. The Chair is ot opinion ,
that the point of order is well taken.
Mr. JUDD. Mr. Chairman, upon the ques- |
tion of order raised by the gentleman trom j,
Missouri [Mr. Bbsjamik] to the amendment ,
offered by niv colleague [Mr. Losax] I wish
to call the attention of the chairman and ot
the House to some facts m addition to taose
named by my colleague. The proposed work
at the mouth of the Calumet is m pursuance
of a survey of that river made by the Govern-
ment and a report upon the same made by the
engineer department, which rcpo:rt ftas been
printed by the House and is a part of its ll-<01(1-
This is always the beginning ot a work, and the
work on the improvement is already beBu .
An appropriation to carry out that wor e is not
only in order as an amendment to tais bil., b> t
it is the duty of this House to make it. it the
public interest demands it. I repeat that th .
War Department has made a survey of the
proposed improvement and sported to Wo
House the plan which it deems most expedient
for the execution of the work.
Mr BENJAMIN. The gentleman is not in
order unless he appeals from the decision of
' ^The CHAIRMAN. The Chair will hear the
explanation of the gentleman from Illinois.
Mr JUDD. The survey of tne Calumet
river was ordered, and by the expenditure of
the public money it has been unquestionably
recognized as a public work, as I have tried to
make the gentleman from Missouri [Mr. Bbx-
j.wiin] understand.
I will, with the permission of tho House, add
a word or two in reference to appropriations for
Lake Michigan. Some gentlemen have spoken
sneeringly of the small sums of money whieh
have been placed all ronnd Lake Michigan for
the improvements of harbors. Mr. Chairman,
there is not a complete or perfect harbor on
Lake Michigan to-day. There is nothing that
can be deemed adequate to the safety and pro-
tection of the large and growing commerce of
that lake. I desire in this connection to call
the attention of the committee to some of the
facts connected with the growth and increase as
well as the value of that commerce. I ask the
careful attention of gentlemen. I ask the Clerk
to read first an extract from the report made
by Colonel Graham, of the engineer corps, in
1855, who was then in charge of the works on
that lake.
The Clerk read as follows:
"Tho value of this commerce, and the extent of the
civil marine which is constantly engaged m promot-
ing it, both ol' which require protection from a. wont
of this sorb limy readily bo interred trom tho statis-
tics exhibited in tlie previous and subsequent parti
of this repol t. „ ,
"It wilt then bo seen that the value ol the com-
merce and tonnase whieli were allo.it upon this hike
in the year 1855 atone amounted to the lmiiiensofum
of $218,297,3-18 78; that is to say, that fe.'l:V2<J7,:SIS iS
was the amount of en pi tal actually atloat on the lake
daring tho navigable season ot 1855, anil directly
interested in the woik under consideration.
Mr. .i That extract is from a report
made by Colonel Graham in 1855. 1^ now ask
the Clerk to read a comparison of the ship-
ping business of Chicago in that year and in
the year 18(10. I send to the Clerk's desk the
report of Colonel Wheeler, of the engineer
corps.
The Cleik read as follows:
" State'iK'nt of the number and tonnasie of vessels
that arrived at tin, port of Uhicaso lor the yearend-
ing.December, 18of>:
Number ot vessels 
Value "of merchandise < 100,752,301
"Statement of ve-'-el ■ arrived at Chicago harbor
for the year ending Ucccmbej, 1800:
Number of vessel*  <>38 527
KsUm'ited v'aiue of merchandise, at least., 8200,000,000
"Xtwill thus bo seen that in ten years the com-
merce ul' tins poit has doubled, and reasoning from
this la/'l it appears that the value of I ho commerce
atloat ou thelake during this year, 1800, would bo in
the neighborhood of five bundled million dollars;
to if Colonel Graham's reasoning had lorco in 18o->,
how much weitrillions it now, and how much greater
and move pressmoc is the necessity of a harbor ot
refuge at this point, at tho head ol Lake Michigan,
expo sod to all the violent winds, and at which every
disabled vessel in its vicinity would naturally bock
shelter and safety."
Mr. JUDD. It will thus be seen_ that
between 1855 and 18GG the tonnage at Chicago
increased more thon a million tons, and the
value of products on that lake haa increased
about one hundred millions. I will now ask
the Clerk to read an extract from the engineer s
report for 1809, in relation to the present com-
merce of Chicago. And I desire the House
to obseivc the tact, that the statistics given
are only for ninety days, during which the
engineer was engaged in malting his survey.
The Clerk read as follows:
and soventy-eighfc arrived on the 21st of June; and
one hundred and eighty arrived on the 27tli of Sep-
tember. Tho greatest number of clearances was on
the 6th of July, when ono hundred and sixty-six
were cleared, .By examining tho reports of .Colonel
Graham wo find that he says, under dato of July 30,
1854, ' the number of arrivals and departures of ves-
sels of all elasscs amounts to a daily average of forty
during tho season of navigation.'
"A comparison of this report with tho nreeedinjt
statement of the collector will give some idea of tho
rapid increase in the last fifteen years.
" It may bo well to remark that thosizoof tho ves-
sols liavo materially increased as well as tho numbers
during that period. Is this increase still going on.
and may we expect tho same ratio during tho next
fifteen years as l'nr tho past?
"No one can safelypredictthoamountofinore .se,
but that tho commerce will still grow, and rapidly,
there is no doubt in my mind.
" Tho immense reticulation of railroads traversing
tho Northwest, having Chicago as a center, brings to
that port a vast amountof agricultural produce that
is increasing annually.
"A greater depth of water over tho St. Clair fiats
and enlargement of tho St. Lawreneo and Welland
canals, that may bo confidently expected at some
future time, will make tho question of direct trado
with Europo a practicable one.
"A steamboat canal, connecting this portwith tho
Mississippi river, is only a question of time.
" I'heso two possiblo events, taken in eonnoction
with the railroad system now in existenco, convince
mo that tho commerce of this port will at no distant
dav far exceed its present proportions.
" Wo therefore may assort it as an axiom, that har-
bor facilities of tho best and most secure kind be-
come a matter of absolute necessity for the present
vast, extent ami_ rapidly increasing growth oi tho
commerce of Chicago.5'
Mr. JUDD. It thus appears, that in the
three months during which tho engineer was
making the survey the tonnage of vessels
entered and cleared at the port, of Chicago
reached the large figure of '2,784,735 tons. 1
next ask the Clerk to road a statement show-
ing tho growth of the commerce of Lake Mich-
igan in successive years. I desire this to bo
done on account of the suggestion that there
is to olarge appropriation made for harbor facil-
ities on that lake and the protection ol'its com-
merce. I wish it to be understood by the mem-
bers of this House that there is a commerce on
the lakes worthy of the fostering carc ot this
Government, and that there is something in
that region of more value than the commerce
of the Connecticut river after it finds its way
into the State of New Hampshire, on which
lumber floats. 1 want the House to understand
that there is a commerce iloating on these
lakes equal to and exceeding our whole foreign
commerce. 1 desire the Clerk to read a state-
ment of the rapid growth of that, and ask the
House to note that between 1SGG and 1809 more
than five hundred thousand had been added in
the tonnage arrivals at Chicago.
The Clerk read as follows:
"Tho lake trade of Chicago was greater in. 18©
than in 180S. The following tables show the arrivals
and clearances for a series of years, giving the rum-
ber of vessels, number of sailors, and amount ot lon-
nago:
