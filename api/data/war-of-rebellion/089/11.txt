HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, October 1, 1864.

Brigadier-General PATRICK:

As it is probable that the troops of your command now stationed at Prince George Court-House and the fort on the Norfolk road will have to remain there some little time, the commanding general directs that you so inform the commanding officer of the detachments in order that they may make their arrangements accordingly.

Very respectfully, &amp;c.,CHAS. E. PEASE,

Captain and Assistant Adjutant-General.

(Same to Lieutenant-Colonel Spaulding.)
HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS, October 1, 1864-1 a. m.

General HUMPHREYS:

The lateness of the hour at which your order* was received makes it a difficult matter to execute it before daylight. I have, however, taken all the steps in my power to get our Mott's division, or as much of it as possible, and have ordered it to be massed in rear of the Avery house.

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS, October 1, 1864-7 a. m. (Received 7.20 a. m.)

General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

A deserter from Sixtieth Alabama, Gracie's brigade, Johnson's division, came in this morning. Says there is nothing new opposite, the lines being held by about two divisions. He was a courier for Gracie. Says they say Early had a fight in which he was successful day before yesterday.

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS, October 1, 1864-8 a. m. (Received 8.25 a. m.)

General HUMPHREYS,Chief of Staff:

General Mott's division is now relieved, and part of it massed behind the Avery house; the rest on the plank road in rear of the Chieves house. One regiment and a section of battery is still down the plank road at Williams' house. Last night I drew out one field battery from the line and put it in Battery 17, from which it can be moved during the daytime if desirable. The First Division extends from the river to Fort Meikel.

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General.
