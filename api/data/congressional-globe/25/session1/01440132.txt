¡¿lonld bring this Government to the thought of
leaning upon any extraneous aid But heie
is no necessity, no reason, no pretext, no
excuse, no apology, for resorting to collateral
aid, and, above all, to the aid of a mastet m
the shape of a national baDk The granted pow-
ers of the Government are adequate to the coercion
of all the banks. .As banks, the Fediral Govern-
ment has no direct authority over them, but, as
bank/tipis, it has them in its own hands It can
pass bankrupt laws for these delmquentmstitutions.
It can pass such laws either with or wnhout meluil-
culdmg merchants and traders, and the diy for
such law to take effect, will be the day for the re-
sumption of specie payments, by every solvent bank,
and the day for the ex motion of the abused privi-
leges of eveiy insolvent one So f-irf-om requiring
the impotent aid of the miscalled Bank of the Uni-
ted States to effect a resumption, that mstitu ion will
be unable to prevent a resumption It* teto powci

Senators have referred to this b ink as the regit
lator of paper currency and of exchanges E\ ents
have shown that jt has no pouer upon these points
but to make bad worse, to rain piper currency by
expansions, and by exporting specie, and to derange
exchanges bv flying kite-bills across the continent,
and over the high seas This is what expenence

thought' It is an ex post Jado conception Look
to General Hamilton's leasons for the estab'ish-
meat of a national bank in 1791, look to all the
debates of Congress at the charter of the first bank,
you will not find one woid upon the subject ot re-
gulating currency and exchanges These modern
conceptions, now so hackneved in the use, and so
flippantly discoursed on, and so conspicuous m the
political debates of the habeidashers' shops, were
unknown to the authors of the f.rst bank1 It was
not until that institution, and still more its succes-
sor, had ruined currency and deranged exchanges,
that these new-fangled leasons were thought of It
was only after it had done the mischief that tne
DESTROYER was appealed to as a REGULA-
TOR, an appeal which can only be enteitamcd on
the principle of the provero, that the hair of the do¿

for the appeal mvself, for the meaning of the pro-
verb is—not what is stipeificially believed bv
some, that you a e to pull a feu hairs out of the

Government towards these banks? lien at this

we have passed a relief bill for their benefit—a bill
to defen the collection of the large balance which
they nill owe the Government But theiers mer-
cy due m another quarter—upon the people,
suffering flom the use e>f irredeemab'e and de-
preciated paper—up«n the Government, reduced
to bankruptcy—upon the character of the coun-
try, suffering in the eyes of Emope—upon the
character of repubbcan gcvernmeat, brought in-
to question bv the successful usurpation or the e
institutions Tms last point is ihe soiest Gente-
men s| cak of the fa lure of exper.ments—'he fai-
lme of the specie experiment, a- U is called bj those
who believe that papei is the ancient and univer-
sal money of the woiki, and that the use of a hule
specie for the first time is now to be attempted.
They dwell upon the supposed failure of "Ihe ex-
pmwfnf," while all the monarch sts of Eur ipe are
rejoicing m thefailmc ofthe experiment oi repub-
lican government, at seeing this Go/e ninent, the
last hope of the liberal world, struck and paralyzed
by an ohgaiehv of banKs—seized bv the thioit,
throttled and held as a ttgei v ould hold ? babe—
str ppedof its levenues, bankrupted, aid ubjected to
the elegradation rf becoming their engine to force
then depreciated paper upon helpless creditors.
Here is the place for m-rc,—upon the people—upon
the Government—ipon the c! ai ic er o' th" eoitn-
tn—upon the chaiacterof lepublican Go einmei t.
The apostle of republicanism, Mr Jefflrsrn, has
left it as a political legacy to the people of the tin-
ted State-, ne/er to suffer iheir Government to fall
uneler the contiol of any unauthoi ¿ed, irresponsi-
ble, ot self-created ms'imtions or bodes whatso-
ever His allusien was to the Bank of the United
States, and its notorious machinations to govern
the elections, and get command of the Government,
but his admonition applies with equal force to all
othei similar or affiliated institution0, and since
May Hst, it applies to the whole leigue of banks
which then "shut up the Tieaimy," and reduce 1
th° Government to helpless dependence
It is taid that bankitiptoy is a seveie remedy to
apph to banks, it mav be answered that it ;s not
more seveie here than in Englanl, whet it applies
to all banks of issn^, except the IJank oi England
