Major-General HALLECK,

General-in-Chief, Washington:

No cavalry has arrived from New York, nor any other troops, since your order of yesterday. If any come, they will be sent forward to Washington immediately. Your order restoring Colonel [Samuel] Graham to the command of Fort Marshall will be promptly obeyed when he reports. But it will take the command from Colonel [Pater A.] Porter, an officer in whom I have the fullest confidence, and give it to one in whom I have very little.

ROBT. C. SCHENCK,

Major-General.
