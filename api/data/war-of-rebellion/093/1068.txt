charge of the acting quartermasters of Croxton's brigade. If you need anything, rations or supplies, you must send a few mounted men from each of the battalions. The wagons, so far as is at present known, will move with the general train of the army. Please have the fords from Lewisburg pike down to Huey's Mill, which is due south of this and probably ten miles from, well watched and guarded. I have ordered General Croxton to relieve your men who were sent down below, and they will join you to-morrow. Hurry back, to the rear your unserviceable (absolutely) horses and disarmed men. If you need any horses and equipments you can get them by sending to post quartermaster Columbia. It is exceedingly important, General Johnson directs me to say, that you should keep the river well guarded from Lewisburg down, so that timely notice of all movements of the enemy toward a crossing may be received. Do not spare any pains to inform yourself thoroughly of the condition of all the fords on your beat, and so far as possible, of the movements and designs of the enemy. Report frequently to these headquarters.

This by order of Brigadier-General Johnson:

NEAR LEWISBURG PIKE, November 26, 1864-7 a.m.

Captain N. S. BOYNTON,

Actg. Asst. Adjt. General, First Brigadier, Sixth Div., Cav. Corps:

CAPTAIN: I have the honor to report that owing to misinformation in regard to the roads I was some delayed. The march thus far has been of necessity slow, as the roads are almost impassable-utterly so for wagons and artillery, I should judge. The Columbia road strikes the pike thirteen miles from Columbia and one mile and a half from the river. The most important part of my scout is yet to be performed, viz, toward Lewisburg. I can give no information of any force of the enemy, save small parties of from six to ten; the last seen was in this vicinity day before yesterday. The fords where main roads cross the Duck River are deep, mostly impassable, I am informed, but there are numerous bridle-roads leading to shallow fords all the way between here and Columbia where the enemy might cross cavalry. I hope to make a more full report and give some sketch of the roads on my return.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. B. SMITH,

Captain, Eighth Michigan Cavalry, Commanding Scout.

P. S. - The bearer of this says that after this was written Captain Smith crossed forty men at the ford (on Lewisburg pike) and drove a few rebel cavalry whom he found there.
