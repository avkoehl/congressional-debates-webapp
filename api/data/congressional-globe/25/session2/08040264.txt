The first severe gale oí alee shore would hate

sailors for running away'from such vessels, 01
fiom a commander «ho could speak in praise ot
their excellent qualities
He thought the expedition ought to have been at
sea a year age The Secretary of the Navj, 01
Commodore Jones, was answ erable for the delaj
It the foimer had done his duty, he ought to
call the latter to a strict account, but if the Se-
< retarv was in fault, he ought to be placed where
he; ,mbecihty could bring no dishonoi upon the
country hereaftei
Mr C would not now desert this expedition
He would foice it to sea with all convenient
despatch He caied not who was sent out as
commander, if he was onlv qualified for the station
He was willing that a midshipman, a lieutenant,
or post captain should be selected llenas dis-
posed to leave? this matter entirely to Exectitue dis-
cretion He had only to say, that so far as his
vote woald effect it, the Expedition should go to
sea he would not desert it he would not thus re-
flect upon the acts of a former Congress If the
measure «as proper two jears ago, it was equally
proper now Not only were all the reasons for it
as good now as they were at that time, but theie
were additional reasons We had entered into the
plan, we had made a beginning, we had gathered
togethei the necessaiy matenaN, we had expended
large sums oí money, and we had raised great ex-
pectations These would never all be realized

unfortunate events, but the country had not jet lost

public servants Wheneier such servant failed
in a great and important measure, 01 lagged in the
performance of his duty, he veiy soon became the
subiect of animadversion and reprehension
The genllsman from New York [Mr Broivson]
had said that Congress, by voting the ippropn-

REMARKS OF   MR  CALHOUN,
Of  South Caholin ,
n bínate, March 22, 1838 —In reply to Mr Wm¡
STÍ.R
Mr CALHOUN rose and said I am not at all
surprised, Mr President, that the Senator from
Massachusetts should show such solicitude to free
himself from the responsib lit) of converting this
discussion into a mere per onal alternation, so un
ucrthy of the place andtheoccas on But it is not
a little unjust m him to attempt to t ansfcr the ic
sponsibJity from himself to me, ruing acted
thioughout, as I have, wholly on the e'efens íe, and
done every thing I could to avoid pei sonaiiti<*s I
have, in truth, a deep and unfeigned aveision to
personal altercations, in any case, especia'ly here,
in my official character, where duty and self re
spect, as well as the dignity of the body, forbid its
introduction On die present occasion, I had every
reason to avoid it The sjbjectis one unsmpassed
in magnitude and importance, and which requires,
the calmest and most deliberate consideration I
have had enfcre confidencein the strength and truth
< f the side 1 support, and, of course, felt deep soli-
citude to limit the discussion strictly to the merits
of the question
But the Senator, in order to throw the blame on
me, denies that he drew a comparison between us
Does he consider it no companion to claim ioi
himself the most universal and aident patiiotism,
and to attribute to me the opposite qualities, of
being sectional, and entertaining feelings far from
fuendl) to the Union? And this, too, without any
thing in the question, or my previous lemarks, that
could, by possibility, justify it? Does he really
think that I ought to have sat m silence without at-
tempting to show, as I have done, how perfectly
unfounded are his claims to superior patriotism,
and how unjust his charges against me?
Bat m order to justify himself, he accuses me of
having first attempted to fix on himself and friends
the charge of inconsistent , m supporting the ciib-
stit ite of ihe Senator f torn Virginia, [Mi Rivi s ]
I made no such charge I simply ai ailed myself
of the opinion which he and the) entei tamed and
expressed, in relation to astmihr measun m 1834—
acquitting them express)) of all inconsistency So
far from a charge of the kind, I placed my argu-
ment on the assumption, that their opinion lemaiiu'd
unchanged, and )et 'his he calls a charge of incon-
sistent)—a throwing of the hist stone, and on
whuhht íests the justification of his unprovoked
pt rsonalitie*.
The Senator next attributes to me the assertion,
thil I intended to draw a compauson between his
touise and mine during the late wai, if time had
permitted, accusing me, at the sime time,of making
a "railing ornando " agnnsl him My answer is,
thit I said nothing like it, and mide no accusation
whatever, either' nihng" or specific I said not a
woul of "lime ■permuting me " What I really said
was entiiely diffeient, and benis no analogy what-
i ver to what he attnbutes to me, as ihe Senate must
remembei I confined myself to an inquiry into
the tiuth of the pictme he hid drawn ol hispa
tiiotism, and his compinson between lnsp.nl Ik
conduct and mina 1 denionstnted wh u little
claims he hid to the high cjuihtics he ain gated to
himself, and how unloundt d his assumption was to

its influence, I hmiti d my rem irks, in reference to
the Sen Uorand ni)sell, to the gie at and living ejue v
ticnsoftht Hy, wh'ih are still unwilled and arc
destined to exercise in important control over the
future destiny ol the country
But, if I should be forced into the comparison, I
shall not confine myself simply to what the Senator
did at that impoitant period of our history 1 would
t ike a far wider range He claims for himself an
exalted pitnotisra, far above others, and mj«elf in
pnticular, and that, too, in war is v ell as peace,
and he w ould hive no right to compl an, if he Id rt-
sponsib'c, not only f Jr what he did, but for what he
dil nut, not only for h s ounacts, but ahoforhis po-
1 tieiI rfssoe nles and paity, which passed without
his cnisuie or ubulc I have no wuh, for the rta-
sms I hive slated, to enter on the comparison, but
if be desires it I v ill read a statement ol some do
/en or fifteen of his votes, which I hid my hands
on since he cemmenced his repl),and which will
furnish some in lex of hiscourse during thatpenod
[Mi Wefstcr indicating no desire for the read-
ing  IV" r  Caihoin proceeded]
Dropping, then, the Senator's course during the
w ar, I shall proceed to notice some remarks of his
in reference to mysslf He has hunted up with
much mduitry, and brought forward  with great
paiade, my course in relation to the tariff—to the
Bank—and the Bonus bill, immediately subsequent
to the late war, m order to fix on me a charge of
inconsistency. I am pleased that he has afforded
me, on this occasion, an opportunity to speak of
this portion of our political history, and of the part
I took It is one that requires explanation, not
only m reference to myself, but the party to which
I bilong
In supporting the measures to which the Senator
íeferred, I was not alone I acted with the great
body of the party and, if I took a more prominent
part in relation to them than others, it is to be attri-
buted to the position which I held m the House and
the paily at the time It is not my intention to de-
fend those measures, but to explain, in justice to
ni) self and the party, the circumstances under
which we acted I do not deny but that we de-
puted, moie or less, from the tiue principles and
policy of our party, but it was under circumstances
which, though they do not justify the departure, are
calculated, in a great degree, to excuse it, and to
íepei effectually any inference that it was an inten-
tional abandonment of them
No popular party is proof against success, and
the long possession of power, and such proved to
be the fact in our case. We had been in the unin-
terrupted possession of power for more than sixteen.
years, and had just carried through successfully a
war against the greatest power on the earth, and, at
the same time, overthrown the party m opposition
to us The flush of victory had, as is usual, the
effect of working a considerable change in the feel-
ings and views of our party, which contributed to
the introduction of the measures to which the Sena-
tor icfers But there were other, and powerful
causes, which also contributed to it. During the
war, the country had suffered much from a depre-
ciated and unequal currency, from the want of do-
mestic sujiphes to take the place of those articles
which we hid been in the habit of receiving from
abroad, but which had been cut off by the war,and
lrom the want of gootl roads, and other channels of
conveyance, on which to transport munitions of
war, and to concentrate promptly a sufficient force
on the points menaced or attacked by the enemy
After its termination, there was a vivid recollection
of the difficulties occasioned by these wants. The
d mger, at the time, to the country, was believed to.
be connected exclusively with our foreign relations.
The war, it is true, had terminated successfully,
but there were hostile feelings left behind on both
sides, between our country and Great Britain, and
she kept up a powerful foice in her possessions in
our immediate vicinity, which was calculated to
excite our vigilance, and to admonish us of the ne-
cissity of being prepaied for a renewed contest
Besides, we were in danger of being involved in a
long and dangerous content, growing out of the
revolution in Spinish America, m which, at one
time, the gieat powers of Europe, united by what
was called "The Holy Mhance," were strongly in-
clined to interfere Under these circumstances, and
when the political principles of our party appeared
to hive gained i permanent ascendancy, by the
prostration of our old opponents, and to be in no
danger, it is not at all wonderful that the measures
with which the Senator now reproaches me should
have received the stipport of myself and the party
to which I belong I confess, for myself, that I
then believed the danger to be, not within, but
without—not from the giving away of our princi-
ples, but violence from abioad, and that I had no
suspicion that it lay m the quarter which expe-
rience has show n it really did This accounts for
my course at that period
In voting for the tariff of 1816, which I am still
of opinion was a judicious measure, with the ex-
ception of the minimum, principle, of which I think
as badly as any one, 1 regarded it as a revenue mea-
steis, and called for by the circumstances, of the
time But I did not dream that, m the short space
of twelve yeais, it would be perverted by those in-
terested into an instrument of such unbounded op-
preoston as to exact and pass into the Treasury
one-half of the whole proceeds of our foreign ex-
changes Nor did I imagine that, in introducing a
bill to set apart a particular fund foi internal im-
provement, and leaving it to Congress to determine
