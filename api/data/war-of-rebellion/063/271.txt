HEADQUARTERS SAINT LOUIS DISTRICT,Saint Louis, April 23, 1864.

COMMANDING OFFICER,

Pilot Knob:

I understood from Colonel Myers that there was no urgent need of the horses now. If transportation is insufficient, after sending the mules up, you may put a company of infantry at Fredericton and withdraw the company of cavalry now there, and one or two companies of infantry at Patterson in place of as many cavalry withdrawn. The outpost can thus be more easily supplied, until the mules withdrawn are replaced. If you have been supplying the company at Saint Genevieve with forage or rations hauled from Pilot Knob, notify the commanding officer there to require here for his supplies which can be shipped by steam-boat.

COMMANDING OFFICER,

Cape Girardeau:

Colonel Myers informs me that there is urgent need from all the mules under Captain Hipple's control which can possibly be spared for a few weeks. He will then replace them. You will do al in your power to meet his order by reducing the number required to the lowest possible figure. To accomplish this, cannot the commands at Charleston and Dallas buy forage in the adjacent country? If so, let it be done. Answer.
