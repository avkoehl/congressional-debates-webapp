HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF SOUTHWEST MISSOURI,Springfield, Mo., November 10, 1864.

Brigadier-General HOLLAND,

Commanding Fourth Military District, Enrolled Missouri Militia:

GENERAL: The general commanding directs that a portion, if not all, of the militia be relieved from active services as soon as it becomes certain that there is no large force of the enemy north of the Springfield and Lebanon road. He desires you to consult with the general commanding the department in regard to the matter. In order that no inconvenience may be created whenever this step is taken, I respectfully request that you will cause a statement to be furnished these headquarters setting forth the localities, either in the field or at posts, where companies or detachments of the militia are stationed, so that timely arrangements may be made for relieving them by other troops at all points where troops will be needed.

WM. T. KITTREDGE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

P. S. - I would respectfully suggest that the possibility of these forces being separately disbanded be duly considered in relation to the question of issuing a full supply of clothing, &amp;c., to them.
