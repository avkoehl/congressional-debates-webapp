FARMINGTON, May 16, 1862.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

All the divisions will be up to permanent line tomorrow evening, after which active operations may be expected. I will be located in Farmington village. Flag of truce from Beauregard appeared at our line yesterday, in charge of Colonel Jacob Thompson, late Secretary of the Interior, with 61 of our prisoners, releasted on parole. To-day an other flag arrived by Colonel John Pegram, with 114 more. Beauregard sends all our surgeons tomorrow for exchange. Halleck will return an equal number, and left paroles of those sent in by the enemy. One of our men in from Corinth to-night says the enemy are receiving re-enforcements every day. A full and well-uniformed regiment of 1,000 men arrived this morning. All quiet in front. Weather clear and road good. Army in excellent condition.

THOMAS A. SCOTT,

Assistant Secretary of War.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE MISSISSIPPI,May 17, 1862.

Major-General HALLECK:

General Buell was unwilling to move this morning until he examined the ground he was to occupy, and I have been out with him ever since early this morning. Is it not too late to reach and occupy properly the designated positions before dark? Unless you direct otherwise, the movement will be postponed till morning. I need the whole day to make myself secure. I think an order from you fixing the hour of moving, say 5 a. m., would be best for all.

Please reply, as my command will be held ready to move until I hear from you.

JNumbers POPE,

Major-General.
