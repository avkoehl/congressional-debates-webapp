(Through Colonel James H. Ford, comdg. 4th Sub-Dist., Kansas City):

LIEUTENANT: I am directed by the general commanding to acknowledge the receipt, through headquarters Fourth Sub-district, of your report, dated 8th instant, and to say that the thorough and efficient manner in which you have scouted the section of country referred to, and the subsequent excellent report of the same, merits and receives the thanks of the commanding general. Such work will certainly prevent bushwhackers from obtaining a hold in the country.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Colonel J. P. SANDERSON,

Provost-Marshal-General, Saint Louis, Mo.:

In order to distribute authority over my district I think it best to establish headquarters of my district provost-marshal at Hannibal. I will keep my own at Saint Joseph for the present. Will that arrangement be satisfactory to you? I am on a tour of inspection in Platte and Clay Counties. Shall be at Saint Joseph to-morrow.

CLINTON B. FISK,

They are stealing stock in every direction and refusing to give it up. I have a strong detachment on headwaters Smoky Hill Fork, after party which stole 175 head of Irwin, Jackman &amp; Co.'s oxen. I shall chastise them severely unless you direct differently.
