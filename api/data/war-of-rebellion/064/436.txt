County. It is in Platte. The force I have at that point is not sufficient. If left to me I shall more men there. I have men wounded without proper medical treatment. What arrangements must I make for them? Please drop me a line of instruction by the bearer.

Very respectfully, yours, &amp;c.,

B. F. POE,

Captain, Commanding Company.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF NORTH MISSOURI, Saint Joseph, Mo., June 17, 1864.

Lieutenant-General SWAIN,Chillicothe, Mo.:

The party whom your force met and fired into, when in pursuit of the escaped prisoners, were not ordered out from these headquarters, and it was not known that Captain Givens was in pursuit until we received dispatches announcing the unfortunate occurrence. No one was ordered in pursuit between Stewartsville and Chillicothe, but were directed to watch out and give information. I am led to make been much discussion on this point reflecting severely upon captain Holloway, who gave the order. Iwas at the time seriously indisposed and not able to give attention to business. It was a sad affair, but I cannot see that any one was particularly at fault in the matter, and before you censure any one it would be well to fully understand the facts.

CLINTON B. FISK,

HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF NORTH MISSOURI, Saint Joseph, Mo., June 17, 1864.

Colonel CLARK H. GREEN,Glasgow, Mo.:

Your communication of the 14th instant just received. The villain Truman has been stopped in his mad career, and, with his confederates in crime, is now in prison waiting trail and punishment for his most diabolical conduct. Give the people assurance. Let all classes unite in putting down bushwhacking, thieving, and marauding. I will do all in my power to strengthen and aid the loyal arm. Truman was not in the district by my authority. He had deceived my superiors and was at his hellish work before I knew of his presence in Chariton County. I sent a force to take him and have him here safely jeweled in Saint Joseph jail. I have been an invalid for three weeks. Shall go to Howard and Chariton Counties as soon as I am able to travel. I beg of you and all other good men to stand shoulder in the work of restoring quiet to your disturbed section.

CLINTON B. FISK,

Brigadier-General.
