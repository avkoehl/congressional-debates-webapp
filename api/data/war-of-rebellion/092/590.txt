SAVANNAH, Saturday Morning, 26th.

We have no reliable information from the front to-day of any movements that are going on. We learn that the opinion prevails to some extent in military circles that Sherman intends yet to fall upon Macon, and not press on toward the coast at present. Our own forces are gathering and going to the proper place. We are informed that over 3,000 rations were issued in this city this morning to newly arrived veteran troops, and we are also officially informed that 4,000 or 5,000 will pass through here in two or three days.
