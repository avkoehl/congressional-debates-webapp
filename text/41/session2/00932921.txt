Mr. BENTON. I move that Mr. Wilson,
of Ohio, be excepted from this order. The
gentleman from West Virginia [Mr. Witcher]

Mr. JOHNSON. I move to excuse Mr.
Trimble, Mr. Adams, and Mr. Winchester.
I see that they are in the gallery enjoying
themselves very well. It would be a great
I hardship on them to bring them down. I
; hope my motion will be agreed to.
| Mr. PETERS. Will the ladies in the gal-
lery excuse the gentlemen? [Laughter.]
| Mr. JOHNSON. My friendsall around me
suggest to me to withdratv the motion; and I
will do so.
The Sergeapt-at-Arras appeared at the bar,
and announced that in pursuance of the order
of the House he had in custody, and now pre-
sented at the bar, Mr. Clarke of Kansas, Mr.
Fitch,Mr. Poland,Mr. Harris, Mr. McCrary,
and Mr. Hamilton.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mr. Fitch,
you have been absent from the session of the
House without its leave. What excuse have
you to offer ?
Mr. FITCH. I have noticed within the last
few days that the Pennsylvania delegation
seemed to have lost that active interest in the
tariff that they had a week ago; and when I
came here to-night I presumed that in conse-
quence of their absence there might be no
quorum present; so I stepped below and took
a bath.
Mr. KELLEY. I move that the gentleman
be fined ten dollars for misapprehending the
Pennsylvania delegation. [Laughter.]
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question
is on the motion of the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania, that the gentleman from Nevada be
fined ten dollars. . .
The motion was agreed to.
The SPEAKE R pro tempore. Mr. McCrary,
you have been absent from the session of the
Honse without its leave. What excuse have
you to offer ?
Mr. McCRARY. I think, Mr. Speaker, the
House ought to apologize to me. I came here
last evening and the House had adjourned. I
came again this evening and the doors, just a
minute or two before my arrival, had been
locked; I was kept waiting a long time outside
before being permitted to enter the House for
the purpose of discharging my duties. I think
the House has treated me badly.
Mr. ALLISON. I move that my colleague
[Mr. McCrary] be excused.
Mr. SCHENCK. I move to ameind the
motion so as to fine the gentleman ten dollars
for being absent without leave.
The amendment of Mr. ScHENcfc was agreed
to; and the motion of Mr. Allison as amended
was adopted.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mr. Harris,
you have been absent from this session of the
House without its leave; what excuse have you
to offer?
Mr. HARRIS. Mr. Speaker, I occupy a
seat oh the extrefaie outer circle of this House,
and this morning when a vote was taken in
reference to a night session there was so tnUch
confusion, so much noise by the noisy gentle-
men who occupy seats between me and the
Speaker, that it was utterly impossible for me
to hear what was going on or what action wis
taken by the Honse. Such things frequently
occur, as gentlemen are aware.
Mr. JUDD. Then the gentleman should be
in favor of a new draw for seats. [Laughter. ]
Mr. HARRIS. Last Monday morning, 1
believe it was, a motion was made to draw for
new seats.
Mr. BOYD. I move that the gentleman be
oxcu seel
Mr. FITCH. I move that he be fined ten
dollars for "swinging found the circle."
! [Laughter.]
1 The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair
cannot recognise the gentleman from Nevada
until he! has paid his fine. [Renewed laughter. ]
i Mr. FITCH. I have settled with the Ser-
geant-at-Arms.
Mr. SARGENT. It seenls to me that the
excuse offered by the gentleman from Missis-
sippi is an evasion. I think unless he offers
some excuse satisfactory to the good sense of
this Housfc that he should be fined ten dollars,
and I make that motion.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Unless the
House shall order otherwise, the Chair will not
recognize any gentleman who has been fined
until evidence has been presented to his satis-
faction of his having actually paid the fine.
If the House orders otherwise the Chair will
i obey the order of the House.
Mr. PERCE. I understood Mr. Harris was
excused*
Mr. SARGENT. I believe I moved an
amendment to the motion excusing him, that
he be fined ten dollars.
Mr. CONGER. I move a substitute for that
motion, that the further consideration of this
case be postponed until the next drawing of
seats in this House. [Laughter.]
Mr. ALLISON. That motion is not in
order.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Nothing is
in order but to execute the order of the House,
that there shall be a call of the House, and to
hear the excuses of the members brought in
under arrest by the Sergeant-at-Arms.
The question recurred on Mr. Sargent's
amendment, and it was agreed to.
The motion, as amended, was agreed to.
The SPEAKER pratempOrk. Mr. Hamil-
ton, of Florida, you have been absent from this
session of the House without its leave. What
excuse have you to offer?
Mr. HAMILTON. A business engagement
with one of my constituents detained me for
some time, and I have been waiting oiitside of
the House.to get in. I found the doors of the
House closed, and have been unable to get in.
Mr. ALLISON. That is a good excuse; and
I move, that he be excused.
Mr. KELSEY. I move that his constituent
be fined ten dollars. [Laughter.]
Mr. BENJAMIN. I move as an amend-
ment to his being excused that he be fined ten
dollars. [Laughter.]
The amendment was agreed to.
The motion, as amended, was then agreed to.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mr. Poland,
of Vermont, you have been absent from this
session of the House without its leave. What

to visit my minister this evening, and 1 went
! with her and cut my visit as short as possible,
j for the purpose of being here to attend to busi-
; ness, but unfortunately was a minute too late.
Mr. STILES. I move the gentleman be
eicusfed.
Mr. INGEtlSOLL. I move that he be fined
forty-five per cfent. ad valorem,. [Laughter. ]
Mr. RANDALL. I move that he be excused
on the payment of the usual fees.
