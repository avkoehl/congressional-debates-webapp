HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, August 16, 1864-9.20 p.m.

Major-General WARREN,Commanding Fifth Corps:

The major-general commanding directs that you move to-morrow morning at 3 o'clock by way of Strong's house and the shortest road thence to the Weldon railroad near the intersection of the Vaughan road, and if the enemy hold their entrenchments weakly in that vicinity endeavor to carry them and occupy the crest in rear of their first line of works opposite the fronts held by the Ninth and Eighteenth Corps. Information derived from General Hancock to-day shows two brigades of Mahone's division to the north of the James, and the signal officer on the plank road observed this evening the troops in the trenches on the enemy's right toward the Weldon railroad vacating the works, and those in our front in the vicinity of the plank road being relieved and moving out. This indicates that but three divisions of the enemy hold their entrenchments south of the Appomattox. General Kautz will be ordered to concentrate his cavalry somewhere near the plank road and prevent Fitzhugh Lee's division of cavalry coming in on your rear. Keep the commanding general advised of your progress and of everything important.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
