Captain BYRON O. CARR,

Chief Quartermasters of Department:

CAPTAIN: Please send a special train to-night to Devall's Bluff to bring to this point a battery of six rifled pieces. A detail will be at the ferry landing at 6 o'clock to-morrow morning ready to go to the opposite side to handle the pieces. My cavalry are failing every hour for want of long forage. If you can bring over from the Bluff, say 30 bales of hay, by this special train, it will relieve us greatly Please notify Lieutenant Barrell, chief quartermaster of my staff, if you do so. What we lack in numbers in cavalry it will be desirable to make up in efficiency, and it you can keep me supplied with hay for line week it will provoke of inestimable service.
