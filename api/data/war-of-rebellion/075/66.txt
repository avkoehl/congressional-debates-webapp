The summit is now occupied by an infantry picket only. A considerable infantry force is encamped along the valley at the foot of the ridge extending to about two miles and a half form Buzzard Roost. This was estimated from the sound of the drums. The first high point is about three miles from Buzzard Roost. Lieutenant Twining and his guide think Dalton can be plainly seen from that point. I presume the point can be carried without much difficult, unless it be occupied by the enemy in force to-night. I will be ready to march at daylight, and await your instructions. Our cavalry was driven from Varnell's this afternoon, but recovered it again without much loss. I think the enemy has no infantry north of Rocky Race Point.
