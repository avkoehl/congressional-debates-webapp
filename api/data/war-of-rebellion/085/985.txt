He captured the guard of 80-odd men and burned the bridge and depot and other U. S. property. I learn that the river can be forded at two or three different places near here, at which there are guards of some strength. I shall move on to Prince's Ford this morning and ascertain their strength, and from there on to Jefferson City unless I receive further orders. Dispatch me as to what I shall do. Colonel Shanks brought in the arms and equipments of the captured guard. I find that this settlement is Catholic and composed of Southern sympathizer. I have done all in my power to protect them, and will leave one company here as a guard until your advance guard arrives.
