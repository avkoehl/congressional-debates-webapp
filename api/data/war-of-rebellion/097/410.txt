General HUMPHREYS:

I have just received your dispatch by Captain Wister. Under the order to withdraw at once I thought we each could do so individually, under the cover of darkness, and so ordered. I have since received orders to attack the enemy with two divisions, sending one down the plank road to report to General Sheridan, and do so to-morrow. My artillery, five four-gun batteries, under General Wainwright, will remain on the line of the plank road. I think the enemy that drove General Sheridan to-day must withdraw to-night. I have a brigade on the road north from J. Boisseau's. I have now orders to move against the force that attacked Sheridan to-day and shall send all I have to move there or wherever the firing of a battle near us may indicate.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.

General Crawford, on receipt of order by return of staff officer, to halt and wait further orders.
