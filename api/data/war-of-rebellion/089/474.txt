CITY POINT, November 1, 1864.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

I feel it my duty to state that my officer at Old Curt-House reports that Gregg's cavalry has been withdrawn from his front, and also that Major Trucker has withdrawn all his mounted men, leaving me with no cavalry in front of my infantry pickets. I state this for your information, as the night after the cavalry were withdrawn last week two or three of my posts were driven in. Night before Gregg returned one of the cavalry posts was captured by guerrillas. Does not the general think it necessary to have mounted men in front of my infantry?

H. W. BENHAM,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
