HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,Trenton, September 6, 1863-10 p.m.

Major-General STANLEY,

Chief of Cavalry:

Your dispatches of this morning received. The general commanding desires you to push the enemy sharply, and if possible strike the railroad. It will probably be a week before Minty can join you, possibly more, and we cannot wait. The enemy appear to be preparing for making a stand at Chattanooga, and it is of the utmost importance that his line of communication be broken. Forrest and a part of Wheeler's force being in the neighborhood of Chattanooga, you can attack with impunity any mounted force the enemy may have in the direction of Rome and the railroad.
