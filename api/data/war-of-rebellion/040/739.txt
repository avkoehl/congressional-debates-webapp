HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF WESTERN VIRGINIA, Dublin, April 20, 1863.

General S. COOPER,Adjutant and Inspector General, Richmond:

From the most reliable information I can obtain, the report of the advance of 2,500 of the enemy's cavalry toward Saltville was started by a man named Menafee, who, having committed a deliberate murder, and trying to make his escape, represented himself as a courier carrying the news of the advance of the enemy, and thus procured relays of horses. I have nothing this morning of the advance of the cavalry. I have about 2,000 men at Saltville, and 1,200 more are now on the way there. Will be there this evening.

Marshall was reported at Booneville on the 11th instant.

SAM. JONES,

Major-General.
