HEADQUARTERS MIDDLE MILITARY DIVISION,Winchester, Va., March 10, 1865.

Major General C. C. AUGUR,

Commanding, Washington:

General Hancock directs me to say that citizens below Strasburg heard firing yesterday and the day before, apparently in Page Valley. They have the report that Sheridan went to Charlottesville and lost a quantity of prisoners, and is returning down the Page and Laura Valleys. It is thought more probable that Sheridan is sending some of his prisoners down the Valley. Mosby has apparently gathered together 300 or 400 men, and Rosser has about the same number, and the general thinks the firing was from an affair between a part of Sheridan's men, with prisoners, and Rosser or Mosby. The general has sent all his own cavalry up the Shenandoah Valley to Edenburg and another detachment to Front Royal. He would like to have you send a strong detachment to Warrenton, if you can, as they may be able to assist Sheridan if he is moving up toward Sperryville and Front Royal.

Brevet Brigadier-General.
