HEADQUARTERS TWENTIETH ARMY CORPS,Millersburg, June 25, 1863-5.15 p.m. (Received 6.40 p.m.)

GENERAL: The firing you hear is in front of Johnson. What we think dismounted cavalry has been annoying his picket line to-day, and Johnson wants to drive them away before dark.

Father Tracy just passed here, on his way to Granger.

Respectfully,

A. McD. McCOOK,

Major-General, Commanding.

Brigadier General JAMES A. GARFIELD,

Chief of Staff.

MILLERSBURG, June 25, 1863-7.15 p.m.

(Received 8.15 p.m.)

GENERAL: General Johnson has had a very spirited skirmish this evening, the enemy attacking. General Davis has just gone in with two more brigades, with which I hope to settle the thing decidedly in a little while. I will keep you posted. I do not know the extent of their force attacking General Johnson.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

A. McD. McCOOK,

Major-General, Commanding.

(Received June 26-1 p.m.)

GENERAL: Liddell's brigade attacked Johnson's pickets, and supporting the line caused the firing you must have heard this evening. The picket line was re-enforced, and the rebels driven back, and, I believe, have left the mountains, perhaps to Bellbuckle.

We took a prisoner this evening, who said Cleburne's division had come up to Bellbuckle. He did not see it, but was told so.

I regret to say that Colonel J. F. Miller has received a mortal wound;* Captain Patton, of the Seventy-ninth Illinois, killed. Johnson's loss will sum up about 50, killed and wounded.

The gallantry of our men cannot be surpassed. I can hold the mountains against any force.

A. McD. McCOOK,

Major-General.
