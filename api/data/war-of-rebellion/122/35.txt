We judge of this condition, however, only form the fate of requisitions for funds made by this office on the demand of officers in charge of works for the means fo prosecuting their labors. It will be seen by the statement herewith that several such demands have been unsatisfied for a month and more. This last remark refers, as you will see by the table, not alone to engineer operations at the South, but to those at the North and to those on the Pacific Coast as well. I am therefore obliged to inquire further whether it is necessary or proper, in your opinion, at once and for the present to restrict expenditures and engagements at all our fortifications.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOS. G. TOTTEN,

Brevet Brigadier-General and Colonel Engineers.
