HDQRS. CAVALRY CORPS, MIL. DIV. OF THE MISSISSIPPI, Selma, Ala., April 2, 1865.

Brigadier General E. M. McCOOK,Commanding First Division, Cavalry Corps:

GENERAL: I take great pleasure in informing you of the capture of Selma. General Wilson directs that you cover our trains with your division and march to this place as rapidly as possible. We have all the guns and many prisoners.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

E. B. BEAUMONT,

Major and Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND DIVISION CAVALRY, Near Selma, Ala., April 2, 1865.

[Major E. B. BEAUMONT,Assistant Adjutant-General:]

MAJOR: The only chance I see to take this place is to mass the greater portion of both divisions, leaving a thin skirmish line where the division was posted that masses on the other. This side is, I think, the best to make the assault on, and I am willing to lead with my division if they are both concentrated, but I think it too heavy a job for one division by itself.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

ELI LONG,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
HDQRS. CAVALRY CORPS, MIL. DIV. OF THE MISSISSIPPI, Selma, Ala., April 2, 1865.

Brigadier General ELI LONG,Commanding Second Division:

GENERAL: Send a large battalion early to-morrow morning toward Centerville to communicate, if possible, with General McCook, commanding First Division. The battalion will push on until it communicates with the First Division.

By command of Brevet Major-General Wilson:

Major and Assistant Adjutant-General.
HDQRS. CAVALRY CORPS, MIL. DIV. OF THE MISSISSIPPI, Selma, Ala., April 2, 1865.

Brevet Major-General UPTON,Commanding Fourth Division, Cavalry Corps:

GENERAL: Please send your First Brigade early in the morning on the Centerville road as far up as will cover the roads running east from Marion. Chalmers is doubtless in that quarter yet, and should be broken up. Keep me fully advised of what you learn. I would like to have you leave General Winslow here if you can do so, but you may exercise your own discretion . Use your two brigades to find out where the enemy is and prevent his crossing in the direction of Montgomery till we get ready to start.

J. H. WILSON,

Brevet Major-General, Commanding.
