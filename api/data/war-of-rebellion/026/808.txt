Major-General SMITH, Goldsborough, N. C.:

I would like Clingman's brigade (including Radcliffe's and Faison's regiments) sent back, if you can spare them. General Rains is in Richmond before now. I burst my best gun at Fort Fisher yesterday against enemy's steamer. Please give all possible facility for 10-inch gun from Richmond.

General Evans' brigade reoccupied Kinston yesterday. The bridge at that point is being rebuilt. General Pettigrew's brigade and Leventhorpe's regiments were ordered to Weldon and Petersburg last night, but they were detained by a collision, in which two engines were disabled; no lives lost.

The cars are running regularly from Wilmington to the Neuse River, and the railroad bridge at that point being reconstructed.
