HEADQUARTERS THIRD DIVISION,September 30, 1864.

General WARREN,

Commanding Corps:

GENERAL: Everything is quiet thus far. A regiment, 760 strong, under Colonel Sergeant has reported. I have ordered them to the intrenchments on the right of Fort Wadsworth. Bragg is in reserve. Another regiment, the One hundred and eighty-fifth New York, 800 strong, will report to-night. There have been some rumors of a cavalry movement near the Jerusalem plank road, but a dispatch from Hancock says he know nothing of it yet. Captain Howell has just returned from General Gregg. He is where the Vaughan road crosses Hatcher's Creek, and he holds and extends up the Telegraph road. He has had no force of any extent of the enemy in front of him. What was there was driven south of Hatcher's Creek.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. W. CRAWFORD,

Brigadier-General.
