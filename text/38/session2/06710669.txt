THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
689-
that the tellers be instructed not to count the vote
of the so-called State of West Virginia.
The VICE PRESIDENT. In the opinion of
the Chair the motion of the member from New
York [Mr. Pruyn] is made too late, the vote of
the State of West Virginia having been already-
announced and declared.
Mr. PRUYN. With all respect to the Vice
President, I desire to say that I understand the
rule to be this: the certificates of the votes of the
respective States have been opened, read, and an-
nounced, and now the tellers, as the proper offi-
cers of this joint convention, are. to pass upon
those votes, and announce the result. My mo-
tion is that the tellers be instructed not to count
the vote of the so-called State of West Virginia.
Mr. WHA.LEY. If it be in order, I would
ask the gentleman from New York [Mr. Pruyn]
to state his reasons for his motion.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The language of
the rule under which the two Houses are now
acting is as follows:
" If upon the reading nfiiany <;ueh certificate hy the tell-
ers, any question shall arise as to the counting of the votes
therein certilied," &c.
The question must be raised when the vote is
announced. In the opinion of the Chair the
member from New York [Mr. Pruyn] should
have made his motion, in order to come within
the rule, at the time the tellers announced the vote
of the State of West Virginia.
Mr. COX. If the rule is that which has just
been enunciated by the Chair, how is it that the
gentleman from Kentucky [Mr. Yeaman] can
submit his motion before the Vice President shall
have opened, and the tellers shall have announced,
the votes of the States ofLouisianaandTennessee?
The VICE PRESIDENT. In the opinion of
the Chair the motion of the member from Ken-
tucky [Mr. Yeaman] is in order. Itdoesnotap-
ply to a leturn whete objection is made, but it
applies to a return which has not been submitted
to the convention. It is a distinct motion that a
return shall be submitted to the convention. It
comes within the latter clause of the joint resolu-
tion, which relates to any other motion pertinent
to the object for which the two Houses have met
in convention.
Senator FARWELL. 1 would suggest that
the question raised by the member from Ken-
tucky [Mr. Yeaman] has already been decided
by the two Houses of Congress in the passage of
the joint resolution which 1ms just been read. It
is not in order, therefore, to again raise the ques-
tion in this convention, the point of order having
already been determined by the two Houses of
Congress.
The VICE PRESIDENT. Does the Sena-
tor from Maine [Mr. Farwell] raise a question
of order upon the ruling of the Chair?
Senator FARWELL. I raise the question of
order that this question has already been decided
by the two Houses of Congress in passing the
joint resolution under which this convention is
acting, which joint resolution has been approved
by the President.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The fact of that
approval of the President is within the knowledge
of the Chair, and in consequencc of that knowl-
edge the Chair has seen fit to withhold the returns
oHhe States in question. There has been no of-
ficial promulgation of that approval of the Presi-
dent. Still, in the opinion of the Chair, if either
branch of Congress shall be disposed to order the
returns nowupon the table to be read, it is within
their power to do so. The reading of the returns
would be one thing; then would arise another
question, whether the vote in the return so read
should be added to the count of the tellers. In
the opinion of the Chair the motion of the mem-
ber from Kentucky [Mr. Yeaman] is in order.
Mr. YEAMAN. Before I submit my motion
in writing, I would inquire whether the submis-
sion of that motion would require the temporary
dissolution of this convention and the resolving
of the two Houses into their separate bodies m
their respective Chambers?
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Chair has no
doubt upon that point. Each House must de-
termine the question m its own Chamber; and
each House iias a negative upon the determina-
tion of the other.
Mr. YEAMA^T. Then I desire to submit an-
other suggestion.
Mr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois. I object to
any debate.
The VICE PRESIDENT. AH debate is out
of order. The rule itself prescribes that no ques-
tion shall be debated in the convention.
Mr. YEAMAN. Then I withdraw my mo-
tion, if it requires the separation of the conven-
tion into the two Houses.
The motion was accordingly withdrawn.
Senator TRUMBULL, on the part of the tell-
ers, announced the following as the result of the
vote for President and Vice President of the Uni-
ted States:
List of votes for President and Vice President of the United
States for the constitutional term to commence on the 4th

necessary to a choice, 117. For President of the

coln, of Illinois, has received 212votes; George 13.

For Vice President of the United Slates, the tell-
ers announce that Ahdrew Johnson, of Tennes-
see, has received 212 votes, and George H. Pen-
dleton, of Ohio, has received 21 votes:
Wherefore, I do declare that Abraham Lin-
coln, of the State of Illinois, having received a
majority of the whole liumberof electoral votes, is
duly elected President of the United States for four
years commencing on the 4th day of March, 1865;
and that Andkew Johnson, of the State of Ten-
nessee, having received a majority of the whole
number of electoral votes for Vice President ot
the United States, is duly elected Vice President
of the United Slates for four years commencing
on the 4th day of March, 18G5.
[The announcement of the result of the vote
was received with applause upon the floor and in
the galleries.]
The VICE PRESIDENT. The object for
which the House and the Senate have assembled
in joint convention having transpired, the Senate
will retire to its Chamber.
The Senate accordingly retired from the Hall
of the House of Representatives, when
The House was again called to order.
EVENING SESSION DISPENSED WITH.
The SPEAKER. The pending question, at |
the time of the entrance of the Senate into the
Hall, was on the motion of the gentleman from
Massachusetts [Mr. Dawes] that the session of
this evening be dispensed with.
Mr. STEVENS. If that motion be adopted,
will the tax bill come up as the first business in j
the morning?
The SPEAKER. There is but one special
order in Committee of the Whole on the state of
the Union which antedates the tax bill, and that
is the Indian appropriation bill, which, by unan-
imous consent, is understood to be passed over.
As by unanimous consent the tax bill was made
the special order for thiseveningatseven o'clock,
and until disposed of, therefore, if there should
be no session this evening, to-morrow morning,
after the morning hour, the tax bill will be the
special order in Committee of the Whole.
Mr. STEVENS. Then I have no objection
to the motion to dispense with the session this
evening.
Mr. DAWES. I supposed, in making the
motion, that 1 was acting in accordance with
the wishes of the chairman of the Committee of
Ways and Means.
The motion of Mr. Dawes was agreed to.'
Mr. DAWES. I desire to ask what will bo
the first business to-morrow.
The SPEAKER. There will be a morning
hour, during which the committees will be called
for public business, beginning with the Commit-
tee on Public Lands. After that, the reconstruc-
tion bill will come up, unless the House should
go into Committee of the Whole on the state of
the Union, in which case the tax bill will be thu
special order.
Mr. STEVENS. I move that the House do
now adjourn.
The motion was agreed to.
And thereupon the House (at two o'clock, p.
m.) adjourned.
