How did Morgan get off and what direction has he taken? Is Stevenson following him? Can I do anything to aid in intercepting or overtaking him? answer promptly and give me all information you can of the evacuation. Send the above and answer promptly.

Honorable GEORGE W. RANDOLPH,

Secretary of War, Richmond, Va.:

General McCown telegraphs that Cumberland Gap was evacuated night before last and my troops not needed. General Maxey's command will proceed by Knoxville to Kentucky, taking all spare arms with him.

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS CONFEDERATE STATES FORCES,Chattanooga, Tenn., September 19, 1862.

Brigadier-General MAXEY:

GENERAL: The major-general commanding directs me to say by General Bragg's instruction Smith's Legion and Douglas' battalion were designated as a part of the command to go with you into Kentucky. Before the receipt of General Bragg's instructions Smith's Legion (which was not under General Jones' command) had started for Kentucky as escort for a money train, and General Jones is informed by Major-General McCown that it cannot be stopped without material injury to the public service. Douglas' battalion had also moved from Kingston to Spart. They are both, however, by General Bragg's orders under your command, and should you overtake or fall in with them on the march or after your arrival in Kentucky you will so treat them, unless contrary orders are received from superior authority. A copy of General Bragg's instructions are herewith inclosed.*

Very respectfully,

CHAS. S. STRINGFELLOW,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

CHATTANOOGA, TENN., September 19, 1862.

Brigadier General JOHN P. McCOWN, Knoxville, Tenn.:

The troops sent to by me Knoxville had originally nothing to do with Cumberland Gap, but are a part of General Maxey's command, ordered
