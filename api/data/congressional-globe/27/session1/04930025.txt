the appropriation of the means in its hand , puolic
and private, to break down the local banks of a
single State. Saca regulation oí our banks and
our currency ought not to be desired by any inte-
rest, or any party, and what security caí we bave
that what has so recently been may not again be
brought about, if we voluntarily reconstruct the
same dangerous machinery? We have seen what
its natural tendencies are, and what its action has
been, and have we any foundation for saying that
either will be diffeietit m future' It seems to me
not.
I will now pxamiilp very briefly the action of
these two systems of finpnee upon rm'it Here
the greatest benefit is prowed, and seems to be
expected, from a Bank of the United Stpk=, and
the greatest injury appre1 ended and feared fro n
the Independent Tie-iMny What must be the
action, and what the tendencies of each? The In
pendent Treasury =}bien\ ran, from its nature
and the necessity of the (ase, act a= a restraint upon
the excesses of credit, and therefore, in that
sense, prove a salutary regulator of it Using
no credit l'self, when it shall have reached
its perfect operation, it must constantly hold
up before the banks, the nicrcnant , the bro-
kers, the Dusiness men of all elps "■s, a sound ?nd
uniform rtandard of currency of intrinsic value, a
standard by which alone the value of all credits, as
well as all property, ought to be and must finally
be, measured. It stands m the whole country as
do the weigher, and gauger, and measurer, in the
marts of commerce, and brings a!) commojmes to
their true standard of value, as do the latter to their
true standard of quantity. The apprehension is
that it will prove too i'gtd and severe a regulator
of credit, but no experience from its ac ion has as
yet confirmed this iear Why should it continue"
The cuirency of this sysert is the standard of iruti,
and none but false cred ts need apprehend injury
from a trial by it. If the cedit be in fact, what
every credit ought to be, a representative <f mum-
sic value existing any where, this standard of in.
tnnsic value wnl strengthen and confirm i', but if it be
a false ciedit, the mere representative of imaginary
value, having no real existence, th° standard will
be precisely the one which every great interest of a
commercial country require , the regulatoi, and
the only one which can presave soundness and
uniform ty in trade, by distinguishing ihe sound
credits irom the false, and strengthening and ecn-
firmmg the former, while it discredits ana driv-s
out of the market ¡he latter.
How is it with a National Bank in these ic-
spects' Under the systems of banking which uni-
versally prevail in this country, a bank may be not
inappropriately defined to be incorporated credit,
and a National Bank may be as appropriately con-
sidered a monopoly of incorporated eiedit I am
aware that here rests one «f toe great mrri's ot
such an institution in the minds of thosp wh ) favor
its establishment, and tnat here I am 'o m«'t thf
stron«e t resistance from oar talented and respect d
opponents They consider the great va a? ct a
National Bank to consist in its power to íegn'ate
credit, a-d especially to legu'ate a currency ot cre-
dit I must tell the g nilcmen tnat the p n er and
the will to do are very diffeient t mg-, .is welt it a
money corporation, as an md.vdudi. They ma;
give great powers to a tank, and all great p w rs
may be used for the accomplishment of g-eat good,
if the will sad the wisdom exist and act \<i h ihe
power, but Congress cannot give the wi'l or the
wisdom, and the ''ear bought experrme of cur
country, ai'h two former bants, prove' hit hese
properties are not naturg ly muted, or 111 e'y to ocf
together, in a money corpora ion I know that the
late Bank has sometimes pioved a seve e regulat r
of the credit of weak insulations s nd sm„le indivi-
duals, in small and ordinary tran'actio'. , and th<J
it has been accunonW, m such cans, to take to
itself the lion's share, to extend n prods ly
restraints imposed upon their busings JThe-e,
however, have been, in a national sense, small
matters. In the great floods and ebbs m the
ides of trade and commerce and credit, where has
that giant institution been found1 As a regulator
of credits and a safeguard against excesses and re-
vulsion^   No, but as the great leader an 5 promo-

ter of th'expansionsand over-tradings and spDcula-
tions, and then oí the consequent revulsions. Look
at 1819, 1825, and 1834, for examples. In all
great irregularities the Bank was usually the first
to move, to expand, to practise excesses n-eif and
promote them in others, and, when the gale had
reached its height, it was usually the first also to
sound the alarm, to countermand the course, to
take in sail, ?nd fly for the harbor, resting upon
the strength of the cedit ot this Government and
the revenues of this Government to keep it afloat
and bring it to land, and entirely regaidless of the
wrecks and rum and destruction of local banks
and private merchants and traders lelt upon its
trail, and vhich mu t strew its hack towards self-
security So lona; a- that institution continued to
ho'd he reven íes of the United States and the
credit of the United States, it could practi e these
inegulariiies in comparative safetj, but when both
were surrendered by comoulsion, and, with the
same name and same capital, under a State char-
ter, it undertook these bold flights, it too fell among
tho«e which hid formerly been its victims, and now
remains dead snd motionless, the worst wreck npon
an over-burdened shoie
These nregulanties and evils of the two former
Banks of the United States, which I have pointed
out, and from which the country has so severely
suffered and is now suffering, pre not mere inci-
dents, the effects of particular times ind eircum-
stwees Tney arc mtiinsic, and thejr c?u es are
to be ft und in the very niture of a mon -ed cor-
poration, v anaged by pr vate cupin y, jnd having
for its support the vast credit and revenues of this
mighty nation. The experience of the country is
ample upon this point. Tne power and will of a
¡National Bank to regulat*  our trade and credit and
curtency has leen aburid?n ly tried, and has the
bu mess wtrll b<en free from expan nt s and con-
tractions, exec s" ¿nd lovulsions, u let such regu-
lation1 Have then- L«cn no leckless speculators
on the one hand, buoying men up with hop- to-
day, and no con'equent revulsions and depressions
on the other hand, «.mitins them in embarrassment
and distress and bankiuptcv tt-morrow? If such
has been tne experience of the r rtst, what better
can we expect from bank r filiation, . i hout
any other standaid for tne futuri' If uniformity
and stability, and soundnes , and true value, have
rot beet the fiuils of the former ban1  , upon what
principle are we to exp et suen fruits fiom anothei
institution, orgttuiz°d upon thesamf principles, and
holding m it vtry nature the same inherent evil
tendencies.
And wl at, Mr President, is ti e sysUm row to

A sys'em which, so far as its action can eo, w II

Bank; subject to all manner of fluctuations, both
ot quantity and value, at the will of those mana-
gers, hable to depression and destruction as well
from panic, passion, and prejudice, as from real
and stable causes, and dependent both for its uni-
formity and permanent value upon the stock of
puolic confidence which can be drawn around it.
Suca is the currency and standard of value which
the Senate is novv called upon to prefer, and for
which we are to throw away one of inherent value,
of permanent uniformity; the currency dictated by
the fathers of the Constitution for the protection of
every Citizen, and the prosperity of their country.
Will gentlemen consent to destroy, at a single
blow, a system of finance for the Government, pre-
mising results such as I have briefly and imperfectly
described, possessing tendencies,inherent in its ac-
tion, such I have pointed out, and trust themselves
to darkness and doubt for a substitute? Or will
the? exchange such a system, yet almost wholly
untried, for one whose evils have been demonstrat-
ed by experience, and are already daily staring the
whole country in the face^ Will they abolish a
system established by the authority of law, and
now m successful operation, when no man can
say that such a substitute as I have antici-
pated, and attempted to describe, is within their
reach' To return to the metaphor of the honora-
ble Senator from Kentucky, will they insist upon
teartns down the old house, for a berth upon the
pavement, or in the fields? To do so, m my judg-
ment, is wholly unnecessary, and will be most un-
tuse.
Another cons deration connected with the speedy
passage of this bill, tor the avowed purpose of fol-
lowing its passage by the establishment of a new
Nati mal Bank, is well worthy of the serious con-
sideration of those who press it forward. Quiet
and confidence m relation to the validity of the
c¡ alter oí a Bulk, to its solvent condition, to the
mt grity of its management, and its fidelity to all
its obligations, are indispensable to the success and
piospenty of such an institution, organized upon
the principles which characterize the banks of this
country, and which doubtless will be the leading
prn ciples of the charter of any new Bank of the
United Slat s now to be proposed It is a fact per-
ftc iy we 1 known here, and every where, that a
very large minority, ¿>ot to say a majority, of the
state m.pfi of this country, and of the people of
this coun'ry,enteilam a settled hostility against the
creation, or ex sttnee, of any such institution under
the authority of Congress They all believe a
JSaiicnal Bank calculated to bring evil rather than
good upon the people and the country They be-
lieve i s lend ncies, in a pecuniary sense, are rather
to deransement and nrejularity and rottenness,
thin to stability, uniformity and soundness. They
believe that, in a political sen^e, it is tht most dan-
