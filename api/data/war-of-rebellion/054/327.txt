(Received 10.30 a.m.)

GENERAL: General Hascall has reported that the enemy at 9 o'clock was advancing upon him at a point 4 1/2 miles on the road to Bean's Station. I have ordered him, in case he is heavily pressed, to fall back slowly. It is very important that General Granger should move up to our support.

RUTLEDGE, December 14, 1863-8.45 p.m.

(Received 15th.)

GENERAL: I have just returned from Bean's Station. The enemy attacked Shackelford at 2 p.m. At dark our advance has been driven in so that the enemy occupied the road leading from Tazewell to Morristown. Since dark the enemy has been pressing Shackelford so that he has been compelled to fall back a short distance. I have ordered a division of infantry to move up to his support. One of the prisoners states that he belongs to Gracie's brigade of infantry; that this brigade had the advance, and that Longstreet moved up to within 2 miles of Bean's Station. The fight will probably be renewed to-morrow. If this division of infantry cannot

hold them in check, I will back on the road to Knoxville.

Yours, respectfully,

JNO. G. PARKE,

Major-General.

General FOSTER.

GENERAL: General Shackelford's pickets, on the Poor Valley road, report cannonading in the direction of Tazewell. This may be a force of the enemy's cavalry trying to get in our rear. I think it important that Granger should occupy Blain's Cross-Roads as soon as possible.

JNO. G. PARKE,

Major-General.

General FOSTER.
