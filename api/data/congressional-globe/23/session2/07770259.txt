tion he may possess in relation to the obstructions

ington and Georgetown, in this District.
By Mr  HENDRICKS-
R solved, That the Committee on Indian Affairs

Agreed to
Mr  BENTON submitted the following resolu-
tion
Resohed, That the íesolution adopted by the
Senate on the 28th  day of March, in  the year
1834, in  the  following  words.  "Resolved, That
the  Hiesident, in ihe late executive p¡oceedtngs  ttt
relation to the public  revenue, has assumed upon
himself authority and  power   vot  conferred by the
Constitution and laus, but in delogation of both,"
be, and  the same is hereby, ordered to be ex-
punged from the Journals of the Senate, because
the said resolution is illegal and unjust, of evil
example, indefinite and vague, expiessmg a crim-
inal chaige without specification, and was lrregu-
larlyand unconstitutionally adopted bytheSenate,
in subversion of the rights of defence, which
belong to accused and impeachable officers; and
at a time  and  under   circumstances to involve
peculiar injury to the political r ghtsand pecuniary
interests ot the people of the United States.
The resolution havng been read,
Mr  POI1N DEXTER rose and said he doubted
I whether it wasmordei to offer such a proposition;
j and, therefore, he ob]ected to the reception of the
í motion of the honorable Senator    TheConstitu-
I tion of tie United States (said Mr. P ) makes it
I the du'y of each House of Congress to keep a
Journal of its proceedings      Each House may
1 incorporate with its Journals an unconstitutional
act, or Congress may pass an ur constitutional
law , but it does not follow that the matter which
I is a part of the hit/ory of the session should not
be on the Journals     To omit to place it on the
Journals would be a violation of its constitutional
I duty     The Journal is only a history of the pro-
l ceedmgs  of  this  body—there   is   no  principle
involved m it      How are we to fulfil our consti-
1 tutional obligations, if, after we repent of having
1 done an ac', we allow a proceeding to expunge it 
I The amendment of a Journal roust be made on
I the day when it is read     Is it in order to expunge
anv part of the Journal of the Senate during the
administration of John Adams or Thomas Jef-
ferson !    Ifitbe.Mr   P. said he could find enough
I  there that he would be willing to expunge     The
motion to amend, then, must be made on the day
the Journal is lead, or it is out of order to move
it afteiwards,  and he insisted it should not be
lece.ved     If the hororable gentleman from Mis-
souri tl inks the resolution complained of is wrong
in principle, let him introduce a countervail.ng
resolution, and then the Senate can take it into
consideration, and if there be an error m it, they
can correct it     Mr  P. said he objected to do that
win. h the C. institution forbids—to do that which,
if we hud not done it, would have been a violation
of the Constitution of the United States      With-
out oftenng an opinion about the resolution, or
