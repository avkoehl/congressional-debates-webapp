names of meritorious and distinguished non-commissioned officers and privates selected as the recipients of the Kearny cross, the division decoration. Many deserving soldiers may have escaped the notice of their commanding officers, but in the selection after next battle they will doubtless receive this honorable distinction. This cross is in honor of our old leader and the wearers of it will always remember his high standard of a true and brave soldier and will never disgrace it.
