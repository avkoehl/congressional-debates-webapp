HEADQUARTERS ENGINEERS BRIGADE, March 31, 1865.

Lieutenant Colonel C. T. CHRISTENSEN,Assistant Adjutant-General:

From reports gathered from different citizens I am of the opinion that the Fifteenth Confederate Cavalry is close in my rear, and perhaps the Sixth Mississippi and Eighth Alabama. This is rumor and nothing definite.

Respectfully,

J. BAILEY,

Brigadier-General.
HDQRS. ARMY OF DIVISION OF WEST MISSISSIPPI, March 31, 1865.

Brigadier General J. BAILEY;

An officer from General Steele came in this evening and reports that his cavalry has scoured the country for a considerable distance. From what he says we judge that there need be no apprehension of the rumored attack upon your position. The Eight Alabama and other regiments mentioned were very much broken down and disorganized. You will, however, keep your cavalry awake in the front, and advise us pretty frequently of the state of affairs. We shall be on hand in case of need.

By order:

C. T. CHRISTENSEN,Lieutenant-Colonel and Assistant Adjutant-General.

HDQRS. ARMY AND DIVISION OF WEST MISSISSIPPI, March 31, 1865.

Brigadier General J. BAILEY:

All the cavalry, including that which was ordered to come up here in the morning, will remain with you until further orders. Do you consider your force sufficient in case the report about the rebel cavalry should be true?

C. T. CHRISTENSEN,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Assistant Adjutant-General.
