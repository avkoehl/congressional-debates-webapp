CAPTAIN: I have the honor to report that the scout to Falmouth has just returned, having left here at 9 o'clock last night, remained at Grove Church till 1 o'clock a. m., reach Falmouth at 5 o'clock. No enemy found on this side. Citizens report that all communications have been busily engaged in throwing up entrenchments during the past week. They also state that General Young is in command of the enemy's cavalry, and that Longstreet's forces arrived at Fredericksburg on Sunday, where they are encamped. The cavalry camps seen by the first are still visible, and the officer in command reports the river strongly picketed by dismounted men; cannot tell whether they are cavalry or infantry.

J. P. TAYLOR,

Colonel, Commanding Pickets.
