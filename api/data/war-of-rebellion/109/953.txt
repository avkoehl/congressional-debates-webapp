secure its success. A Washington telegram of the 11th, published in a Northern paper of the 13th, states that it is reported that the Tenth and Eighteenth Army Corps, now north of the James River, will be called to General Grant, as they are not strong enough to take Richmond, and too strong to be kept idle. The recent success of General Beauregard may induce the fulfillment of this report, if the idea was not previously entertained.

Your position will enable you to verify the supposition of Butler's withdrawal, and you will realize the importance of not allowing him to reach Grant before our forces, now confronting him, shall reach General Lee.

Very respectfully, yours,

JEFFERSON DAVIS.

General B. BRAGG:

The following just received from Colonel Baker, stationed at Fenley's farm:

Unusual activity among transports of the enemy. Quite a number of them have assembled at the bluff in front of Howlett's house and where the road runs to the river. Considerable noise is being made, bugles are sounding the assembly, and there is every indication of a movement.

G. T. BEAUREGARD,

General, Commanding.
