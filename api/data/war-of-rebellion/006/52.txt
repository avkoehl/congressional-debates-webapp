Adams' Landing to the ferry he so managed it that only for a few minutes was he so situated that he could not instantly open communication, though in order to accomplish this he was frequently exposed to the direct fire of the enemy.

I must also express my warm acknowledgments and high appreciation of the services of the Navy. Captain Rodgers on all occasions responded to my requests. The working of the gunboats in the narrow channel of Port Royal and the handling of the guns was most masterly and most beautiful. The signaling was perfect throughout. The whole operation reflects the highest credit upon the Navy and upon the officers and men specially engaged in it. I repeat, my whole command, as well as myself, will mark with a white stone the day of this fraternal and patriotic co-operation. In saying that the troops under my command behaved with great coolness and constancy, I only say what every man observed. I will not particularize, except to say that the skirmishers of the Highlanders first met the enemy, and those of the Eighth Michigan came into the severest contact with him. This regiment has been and still is a great sufferer from sickness, but it showed that loyal steel from the frozen North has fire and power against the enemies of our country.

I must return my acknowledgments to the several members of my staff, to my assistant adjutant-general, Captain Hazard Stevens, who is referred to inthe highest terms in the accompanying reports; to Lieutenant Porter, Eighth Michigan Regiment, who, by means of the negroes, guided my force all the way from the first landing to the ferry (in this he was assisted by Lieutenant Taylor, Roundhead Regiment); to Lieutenant Lyons, Fiftieth Pennsylvania Volunteers, who organized the transportation on flat-boats, in which duty Lieutenant Cottrell, Eighth MIchigan, rendered service; to Captain Fuller, assistant quartermaster, for valuable aid in his department and on my staff; and to Lieutenant Holbrook, who volunteered and served most acceptably as aide throughout. Dr. Kemble, the brigade surgeon, was very efficient. He examined in person, under fire, the ground occupied by our skirmishers, and personally superintended the bringing off of our wounded men. I am under very special obligations to my post and brigade quartermaster, Captain William Lilley, who was indefatigable in preparing for the expedition and efficient in furthering it. He furnished the crews of negroes for the flats and removed the 12-pounder gun and carriage to Beaufort. At midnight he remounted it, took it across the ferry early in the morning, and brought it into Beaufort before night, taking along with him a wagon load of three-inch itself, with all its appurtenances, is now safely laid away at Beaufort in his charge, for use on future occasions.

The loss of my brigade is one killed, one missing, and nine wounded, as per surgeon's report, herewith appended;* in addition to which 3 men were slightly wounded of the Forty-eighth Regiment. Among the wounded is Major Watson, of the Eighth Michigan Regiment, a most excellent officer, and who gallantly commanded in the late affair. The enemy's loss must have been very considerable from our skirmishers alone, and still heavier from the shell practice of the Navy. We buried 3 of their men and have 1 of their wounded men in our hands.

A reconnoitering party I sent out to-day landed at the Adams house, examined the battle-field, and went to the ferry. They found and buried 1 of our missing men, known to have been wounded, and the only one killed, and encountered but one small scouting party of 6 mounted men of the enemy.
