The craft is described to me as a propeller, about 30 feet long, with engines of great power for her size, and boiler so constructed as to raise steam with great rapidity. She shows above the surface only a small smoke outlet and pilot-house, both of which can be lowered and covered. The plan is to drop down within a short distance of the ship, put out the fires, cover the smoke-pipe and pilot-house, and sink the craft to a proper depth, then work the propeller by hand, drop beneath the ship, ascertaining her position by a magnet suspended in the propeller, rise against her bottom, attach to it by screws, drop their boat away, pass off a sufficient distance, rise to the surface, light their fires, and work off. The torpedo to contain 40 pounds of powder and work by clock-work.

As near as my informant can give the plan I send you a rude sketch.* One of the party has gone north for a magnet and air-pump. I expect to catch him as he comes back. The boat is to be ready by 10th May.

Your obedient servant,

S. A. HURLBUT,

Major-General.

Major-General McPHERSON,

Huntsville:

General Veatch and command reached there three days ago.

Is General Garrard to relieve any of my troops? As yet I guard the railroad to Columbia.

Brigadier-General.

HUNTSVILLE, April 12, 1864.

Brigadier General G. M. DODGE,

Athens:

I shall not transfer Colonel Morgan's regiment from General Veatch's division. I have telegraphed twice to Major-General Sherman in regard to having General Garrard relieve a portion of your men now guarding railroad, and presume he will do so very soon. Hurlbut telegraphs from Memphis that Forrest is evidently making preparations to cross the Tennessee River in force, about the mouth of Big Sandy, and that S. D. Lee has joined him. Do you know whether forage for horses, mules, and cattle can be obtained along the road from Clifton to Pulaski?

JAS. B. McPHERSON,

Major-General, Commanding.

APRIL 12, 1864.

Major-General McPHERSON,

Huntsville:

Forage plenty on that road or near it. I am going to Mooresville to-day, and if I have time will go to Huntsville on the train to-night.

G. M. DODGE,

Brigadier-General.
