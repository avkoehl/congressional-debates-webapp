will be issued for getting ready for the attack at once. If others cannot get ready please notify me at once, so that I may stop all movements before daylight.

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS SIXTH ARMY CORPS,March 31, 1865-2.10 a.m.

Major-General WEBB:

Orders have gone for the corps to be in position as designated by daylight, thought the time in short. It is of so much importance to any future success that the movement of the troops should not be shown to the enemy that I would ask that any countermanding orders, based upon the insufficiency of time for the others to get ready, be sent me at once. If the troops are to return I would like to h ave them back in their camps by daylight.

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS SIXTH ARMY CORPS,March 31, 1865.

General WEBB:

At 10 a.m. enemy moved two pieces light artillery (12-pounders) from rear line, placing them in small battery in front line north from station. At 10.30 a.m. same guns were taken out of fort and now stand on Boydton road headed toward city. Three guns that were in enemy's works in front of Hammond's have disappeared. Pickets relieved at 10.30 a.m., portion of them returned to camp near Daggett's, the remainder to camp in rear of pines.

HEADQUARTERS SIXTH ARMY CORPS,March 31, 1865-12.40 p.m.

General A. S. WEBB:

I infer from the reports from my line and signal tower that no great change has taken place in my front other than the withdrawal of part of the troops to points in rear of their line, where they are evidently held ready for movement in any direction.

Major-General.
