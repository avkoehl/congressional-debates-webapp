Obliged by the precise language thus used by the French
Mim ter to view it as a peremptory refusal to execute the
treatj, except on term- incompatible vvjtli the honor and
independence of the I ntt'd State-, and persuaded tint, on
considering the correspondence now submitted to you, vou
can regard it in no other light, it becomes my duty to call
your attention tosuch me  are  as the esigencv ot thecase
demand-, if the claim of interfering in the communications
Iretween the different branches of our Government «hall be
persisted in Tin- pretension is rendered the more unr a
sonable by the lact, tliat the substance ot the required ex
planation bos been repeatedly and voluntarily given before
it m> insisted on is a condition—a condition the more hu
mihatmg because it is demanded as the equivalent of a
pecuniary consideration Do°s France desire onlv a dec
laration that we had no intention to obtain our rights by an
address to her fears rather than to her justice ' She has
alreadv had it, frankly and explicitly given by our Minister
accredited to her Government, his act ratified by me, and my
confirmation of it officially communicated by him in his
letter to the French Minister of Foreign Affairs of the &Jth
of April, 1835, and repeated by my published approval of
that letter after the pas-age of the bill of indemnification
Doe  France wantadegradmg,-erule repetition of this act,
«n terms which -he shall dictate, and which will mvolve an
acknowledgment of her as-umed right to interfere in our
domestic councils' She will never obtain it The spirit
of the American people, the dignity ofthe Lcgi-lature, and
the firm resolve of their Executive Government forbid it
•Vs the an-w ei of the French Minister to our Charge d'Af-
faircs at Pan  contains an allusion to a letter addre=-ed by
him to the representative of France at this plaee.it now
becomes prop r to lay before von the correspondence had
between that lunctionary and the Secretary of State, rela-
iive to that letter, and to accompany the same with such
explanations a  will enable you to under tand the course
Ofthe Executive in regard to it Recurring to the historical
statement made at the commencement of your session, of
the origin and progress of our difficulties with France, it
will be recollected that,on the return of our Ministerto the
united States, I caused my official approval of the expla-
nations he had given to the French Minister of Foreign
Affairs to be made public As the French Government
had noticed the message without its being officially com-
municated, it was not doubted that, if tliey were disposed
to pay the monev due to us, they would notice any public
explanation ofthe Government of the United States in the
same way But, contrary to these well rounded expecta-
tions, the French Ministry did not take this fair opportunity
to relieve themselves from their unfortunate position, and
to do justice to the United States
Whilst, however, the Government of the United States
was awaiting the movement-of the French Government,
in perfect confidence that the difficulty was at an end, the
Secretary of Slate received a call from the French Charge
d'Affaires in Washington, who desired to read to him a
letter he had received from the French Minister of Foreign
Affairs He was asked whether he was instructed or di
rected to make any official communication, and replied that
he was only authorized to read the letter and furnish a
copy if requested I he substance of its contents, it l  pre-
sumed, in i) be gatheied from No  4 and 6 herewith trans-
mitted It was an ittempt to make known to the Govern
ment of the United State-, privately, in what manner it
could make explanations, apparently voluntary, but really
dictated by Trance, acceptable to her, and thus obtain pay-
ment ot the twenty five millions of francs No exception
was taken to this mode of communication, which is often
«sed to prcpan the way lor official intercourse, but the
suggestions made in it were, in their substance, wholly
madmi-sible Not being m the shape of an official com-
munication to this Government, it did not admit of reply
or ofiicial notice, nor could it safely be made the basis
«f any action by the Executive or the Legislature, and the
Secretary of State did not think proper to ask a copy
because he could have no use for it Copies of papers
marked Nos. 9,10, and 11 show an attempt on the part ot
the French Charge d'Afiaire-, many weeks afterwards, to
place a copy of this paper among the archives of this

Government, which, tor obvious reasons, was not allowed
to be done , but the a—urance before given was repeated,
thar anv official comn ucic ltionwhich he might be author-
ized to make, in the nccustomed form, vv onld receive a
prompt and just consideration. The indiscretion of this
attempt was made more manifest, by the subsequent avowal
ot the French Charge d' \ffaires that the objtet was to
bring the letter before Conste— and the American people
It foreign agents, on a subject ot di-agreenicnt between
their Government and tin-, wish to prefer an appeal to the
American pi opt , thev will hereafter, it is hoped, better ap
preeiate then own rights, and the respect due to other-,
than to an mpt to u-e the Executive as the passive oigan
of their communication- It is duo to the character of our
institution-, that the diplomatic intercourse of this Govern-
ment should be conducted with the utmost directuess and
simplicity, and that, in all ca-es of importance, the com-
munications rcceivtd or made by the Executive should as
sume the aceu-tomed official form It is onlv bv insisting
on tin- form, til it i oreign Powers can be held to full respon-
lbilit) , th it their communications can be officiallv replied
to , or tint the advice o-inter erineeof the Legislature nil,
with propriety be invited by the Prc-ident This course is
also be-t calculated, on the one hand, to shield that oflicer
from unjust suspicious, and, on the other, to subject this
portion of In- acts to public scrutiny, and, it occ i-ion shall
riquire it, to constitutional anim ilvcr-ion It was the
more necessary to adhere to the-e principles m the instance
in que-tion, inasmuch a-, in addition to other important
intciesL-, it very intimately concerned the national honor,
a mattei, m my judgment, much too sacred to be made the
subject of puvate and unofficial negotiation
It will 1>~ p-rceivert that thi- letter of the French Minis-
ter of Ford ii Vffairs was read to the Secretary of State
on the 11th ot September last This was the first authen-
tic indication of the -pccific view- ot the French Govern-
ment reeeiv d bv the Government of the United States
after the passage of the bill of indemnification Ina-much
as the letter had been written before the official notice of
my approval of air Livingston's last explanation and
remonstrance could have rtached Pari-, just ground of
hope was left, as had been before stated, tint the Fiench
Government on receiving that information in the same
manner the alleged offending message had reached them,
would desist from their extraordinary demand, and pay tlie
money at once To give them an opportunity to do so,
and, at all events, to elicit their final determination, and the
ground they intended to occupy, the instructions were
given to our Charge d'Affatres, which were adverted to at
, the commencement of tlie present session of Congress.
The result, as you have seen, is a demand of an official
written expression ot regrets, and a direct explanation ad-
dressed to Trance, with a distinct intimation that this is a
sine qua non
Mr Barton having, in pursuance of his instructions,
rcurned to the United State-, and the Charge d'Affaires
of Trance having been recalled, all diplomatic intercourse
between the two countries is su-pended—a state ot things
originating in an unrea-o íablc susceptibility on the part of
the Trench Government, and rendered neccs-ary on our
part bv thoir reru íl to perform engagement- contained in
a treaty from the faithful performance of which In us flu v
are to this day enjoy ing many important commercial adv ant-
age 
11 It is time that this unequal position of afl urs should cease,
I and that legislative action -hould be brought to su tain
i executive exertion in such mea-ure- as the case requires
While France persists in her refusal to eompij with tlie
terms of a treaty, the object ot which was, by removing all
cause  of mutual complaint, to renew ancient feelaig  of
friendship, and to unite the two nations in the bonds of
amity and of a mutually beneficial commerce, -he cannot
justly complain if we adopt such peaceful remedies as the
law of nations and the cncumstances of the ease may
authorize and demand Of the nature of these remedies,
I have heretofore had occasion to speak ; and, in reference
to a particular contingency, to express my conviction that
reprisals would be be«t adapted to the emergency then con-
templated Since that period, France, by all the depart-
ments of her Government, has acknowledged tlie validity
of our claims and the obligations of the treaty, anil has
appropriated the moneys which arp necessary to its t xecu
Hon; and, though payment «withheld on grounds vitally
important to our existence as an independent nation, it is
not to be believed that she can have detei mined perma-
nently to retain a position so utterly mdefen-ible In the
, altered state of the questions in controversy, and under all
existing circumstances, it appears to me that, until such a
i determination shall have become evident, it will be proper
and sufficient to retaliate her present refusal to comply w nil
her engagement-, by prohibiting the introduction of I rench
products and the entry of French ve-scls into our ports
Between this and the interdiction of all commercial mter
course, or other remedies, jou, as the representative  of
the people, mu-t determine I recommend the former, m
the present posture of our affairs, a  being the least inju
nous to our commerce, and as attended with the least diffi-
culty of returning to the usual state of friendly intercourse,
if the Government of France shall render us tlie justice that
is due , and, also, as a proper preliminary -tep to stronger
measures, should their adoption be rendered necessary by
subsequent events.
The return of our Charge d'Affaires is attended with
public notices of naval preparations on the part of France,
de-tmed for our seas Of the cause and intent of these
armaments, I have no authentic information, nor any other
means of judging, except such as are common to yourselves
I and to the public, but whatever may be their object, we are
not at liberty to regard them a- unconnected with the meas-
ures which hostile movements on the part of Trance may
compel us to pursue Thev at least deserve to be met by
adequate preparation on our pan, and I therefore Wrongly
urge large and speedy appropriations lor tlie increase of the
1\ ivy, and the completion ot our coa-t defenses
It this array of miht iry force be really designed to affect
the action ot the Government and people of the United
States on the question now pending between the two na-
tion-, then indeed would it be dishonorable to pause a mo-
ment on the alternativ e vv hie h such a state of tiling  would
present to us Come what may, the explanation which
France demands can never be accorded; and no armament,
however powerful and imposing, at a distance, or on our
coa-t, will, I tru-t, deterus from di-chTging the high duties
which vii owe to our constituents, to our national charac-
ter, and to the world
The Hoa-e of Representatives, at the close of the last
session of Congress, unanimously resolved that the treaty
of the 4th ol July, 1831, should be maintained, and its exe-
cution msi-ted on by the United States It is due to the
welfare of the human race, not less than to our own in-
terest- and honor, that this resolution should, at all hazardo,
be adhered to. If, after so signal an example as that given
bv the \mencan people, during their long protracted diffi-
culties with France, ot forbearance under accumulated
wrongs, and of generous confidence in her ultimate return
to justice, she shall now be permitted to withhold from as
the tardy and imperfect indemnification winch, after years
of remonstrance and discus-ion had at length been solemn-
ly agreed on by the treaty of 1831, and to set at nought the
obligation it imposes, the United State- will not be the only
sufferers The efforts ot humanity and religion, to substi-
tute the appeal  ot justice and the arbitrament of reason
for the coercive measures usually resorted to by injured
nations will r"ceive little encouragement from such an
issue By the selection and enforcement of such lawful
and expedient measures as may be necessary to prevent a
result so injurious to ourselves and 6o fatal to the hopes of
the pliilanthropi-t, we shall, tlieicfore, not onlv preserve
the pecuniary interests of our citizen-, the ind< pendence
of our Government, and the honor of our country, bat do
much, it may be hoped, to v indicate the faith of treaties,
and to promote the general interests of peace, civilization,
and unprov ement                        ANDREW JACKSON
Wvshingtov, January 15, 183S
A message was also received from the Pres-
ident of the United States, by Mr. Doneison,
his Puvate Secretary, transmitting, in compliance
with a resolution ofthe Senate, a report from tha
Si cretaiy of State, relative to a letter written by
the French Minister, the Due de Cioghe, to
Mr. Pageot, the French Charge d 'Affaires, in thia
country, ateo, transmitting the copy of a letter
wntten to Mr Foisyth, by the Fiench Minister
to this countiy, M. Senuner, which contained
exceptionable expressions, and was, theiefore,
not communicated to Congress, together with the
correspondence that took place on that occasion.
[For accompanying documents, see Appendix,
page 22 ]
Mr. CLAY moved that the messages, with the
accompanyingdocurnents,be referred to the Com-
mittee on Foreign Relations: whereupon,
| Mr. BUCHANAN said that he had been so
much gratified with the message which had just
been read, that he could not, and he thought he
1 ought not, at this the very first moment, to refrain
from expressing his entire approbation of its
general tone and spirit.    He had watched with
i intense anxiety the progress of our unfoi túnate
J controversy with France. He had hoped, sin-
cerely hoped, that the explanations which had
been made by Mr. Lmngston, and officially ap*
proved by the President of the United States,
would have pioved satisfactory to the French
Government In this he had found his hopes to
be vain After this effort had failed, ho felt a
degree of confidence, almost amounting to moral
assurance, that the last message to Congress
would have been hailed by France, as it was by
the American people, as the olive branch which
would have restoied amity and good understand-
ing between us and our ancient ally. Even in
this, he fcaied, he was again doomed to be dis-
appointed. The Government of Tiance, unless
they change their d( termination, will not consider
this message as sufficient. We have the terms
clearly prescribed by the Due de Broglie, upon
which, and upon which alone, the Fiench Govern-
ment will consent to comply with the treaty, and
to pay the five millions of dollars to our injured
fellow-citizens.    Speculation is now at an end
