extreme, from the poor at the other, and leav-
ing all persons between the extremes free of
tax! That is the practical operation of this
income law, to tax the widow and the orphan
who have their whole means invested in
corporate bonds or in corporate stock upon
their income if it does not exceed fifty or one
hundred dollars a year, and then all persons
between that income of fifty or one hundred
dollars a year and $2,000 go free ; and when
you get up to $2,000, then you begin again.
That is the practical operation of the income
tax, taxing the rich at one extreme, taxing the
poor at the other, and leaving the great mass
go free.
But let ns pass from this feature to that
which is claimed as the great merit of the in-
come tax by those who advocate its retention,
namely, that it is paid by but few people and
those who are able to bear it. The latter part
of the proposition I have shown not to be uni-
versally true. It is not-paid in all cases by
those who are best able to bear it, but, on the
contrary, is paid by many who are least able
to bear it. The former part of the proposi-
tion I admit, that it is borne by few. I pro-
ceed now to show how few, because I look
upon this as one of its worst features; not that
it is a bad thing to rnalse rich men pay taxes,
but that it is a bad and a dangerous thing for
the law-making power purposely to introduce
any inequality, either of rights or burdens,
among its citizens. The true American theory
is that we all demand equal rights, and are all
willing to bear our fair share of burdens in
the Government.
IIow, then, will this law operate? I have
asked for a statement from the Treasury De-
partment of the number of persons who paid
income tax for the year ending December 31,
1869, and the number of districts that under
the law of 1870 will pay less than $1,000 tax.
The following is the reply I have received:
Treasury Department,
Office of Internal Revenue.
Washixgton, January IS, 1871.
Sia: In compliance with your request, I have the
honor to transmit herewith a statement showing the
number of persons assessed on their incomes for the
calendar year 1869 in each of the clashes below named.
The income tax of 18(59 was assessed in March, 1870.
Number of
Classen. persons assessed.
1. Tax $20 or less  112,421
2. Tax over $20 and notovcr $50   03.501
8. Tax over $50 and not over S100  40,584
4. Tax over $100 and not over $500  41,196
5. Tax over $500  9,213
Total  275,248*
Under act of July 34, 1870, raising the exemption
from §1,000 to $2,000,180,925 of the above number of
persons are entirely relieved from the income tax.
Each of the remaining 94,323 persons returns a tax
of fifty dollars less per annum.
^ Basins an estimate on the returns of 1860. twenty-
three collection districts would return an income tax
Irom individuals of less than $1,000 per annum.
Owing to the general depression in business.it is
probablo that this number will be largely increased
under the returns of tho year 1870.
Very respectfully,
A. PLEASOSTTON,
Commissioner.
Hon. John- Scott, United Stales Senate,
Washington, District of Columbia.
This, it will be seen, includes the whole
country, excepting one district in New York.
That will not largely affect the general result,
for I find by looking at the last return that it
is one of the smaller districts in amount in
that State, paying only $50,779 14 of income
tax. Under the present law it will pay less
than half that amount.
The same officer who made out this state-
ment informs me in another one that upon the
basis of 1809 the estimated revenue fro*i the
income tax at five per cent, for 1870 would be
$2(5,150,000. Bear in mind that is at five per
cent. Now, from this deduct the 180.925 per-
sons who will be entirely relieved, and deduct
also from the remaining 94,323 fifty dollars
* Not including returns from the eleventh district
of Now York, which have not been received.

less that each will pay than they paid in the
former year, and it takes $9,142,550 off that
$28,150,000. That would leave us for this
year $16,907,450, provided the tax was at five
per cent.; but at two and a half per cent, it
will leave us only $8,453,725 as the whole
amount realized from the tax upon individual
incomes in the whole country.
In the year 1869 there was collected from
bank dividends, $3,573,272 45; from canal
companies, $251,048 75; from insurance com-
panies, $920,519; from railroads, $2,898,-
802 31 ; from turnpike companies, $32,289 24;
from interest on bonds, $1,869,369 34; from
salaries, $1,103,520 42. All these will be
reduced one half upon the supposition that
they will be collected at all. But the divi-
dends from January to August, 1870, are in
litigation. If Senators will turn to the report
of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue,
they will find that a case was tried in the
circuit court of the United States before Judge
Strong, and that he there rendered a decision
exempting dividends declared from January to
August, 1870, from liability to this tax. That
case is now pending in the Supreme Court of
the United States, on appeal, and, if the ruling
of Mr. Justice Strong be affirmed, thatamount,
about six million dollars, will be taken off.
We all know that the present Commissioner
of Internal Revenue has, since his induction
into office, decided that dividends declared
from August, 1870, until December 31, 1870,
are also exempt, so that tliu3 far we exempt
entirely all the dividends that may have been
earned during the yeat 1870.
Now if you take the tax upon the interest on
bonds, $1,809,309 34,and on salaries, $1,109,-
520 42, the whole of them would be $2,978,-
895 70 ; but under the present income tax they
would realize but the half of that amount ; so
that if there was a tax on salaries and we get
the tax on the interest upon bonds we should
have $1,489,447 33, Then levying this tax
on individual incomes, $8,453,725, we should
get for 1870 $9,943,172 33. Any additional
amount that is to be obtained must be by liti-
gation, unless you hold that during this year
salaries are liable to income tax, a question I
have understood upon which there is some
difference. They were exempt during the past
year for the reason that they had paid five per
cent, tax during 1870, until the passage of the
law, and therefore, after the 1st of August,
1870, none was collected from them.
Now is this worth the bad feeling, the liti-
gation, and the expense that must be incurred
to get it?
Mr. CONKLlNGr. If the honorable Sen-
ator will allow me a moment, I wish to inquire
of him whether in his statement he has made
the deduction which must arise from the decis-
ion of the-courts, made first in New England,
that the income tax upon the salaries of State
officers, or upon income derived from salaries
of State officers, is unconstitutional and void.
Mr. SCOTT. I have not made that deduc-
tion for the reason that I have no figures which
will enable me to ascertain what it will be,
but I intend before I close to come to that
question and show the injustice of the Govern-
ment of the United States, which has at all
points stood up against the taxation of its own
bonds, enacting a law which, under its present
operation, demands and receives a tax upon
the interest of every bond that is issued by any
State in the Union.
Mr. CONICTjING. Having interrupted my
friend, I beg to make this suggestion in addi-
tion: I find in many directions that claims are
being collected from judges and other State
officers who have paid an income tax, and a
presentation is being made now to the Treas-
ury by way of reclamation, the courts having
decided that the tax, as far as respects the
salary of State officers, was void, and they alt
insisting not only that it cannot be collected
hereafter, but that they have a right to receive
back what has been paid in past years.
Mr. SCOTT. If the Senator will recur to
the argument which I made here at tho last
session he will find that I stated then that the
income tax, not only upon State officers but
upon the salary of every Federal judge and
upon thatof the President of the United States,
was unconstitutional, and was prohibited by that
provision of the Constitution which prevents
Congress from diminishing their salaries dur-
ing their term of office. I did not wish again,
as I said in the outset, to repeat any portion
of that argument, but embraee it in what I say
here, that litigation will follow the imposition
and the continuance of this income tax.
Now, I call attention to the expense of col-
lecting the internal revenue. In the report
of the Secretary of the Treasury for 1870,1 find
the following, on page 156 of the full report,
as the cost of the system:
Collecting...   $2,120,771 84
Administering office 1.1S2J585 6S
Assessing, (page 106)  4,418,770 01)
$7,702,127 52
This is the expense of assessing .and collect-
ing all internal revenue. I do not wish to
create the impression that it is the expense of
assessing and collecting simply the income
tax; it is that of all internal revenue. The
exact proportion of assessing the income tax
we cannot ascertain, but I am sure that it is
greater in proportion to the amount collected
than any other tax. .
Mr. SHERMAN. As that is a point which
I will controvert on the question of fact, I
would like to have the Senator submit any
testimony or evidence or report showing that
the income tax costs more to collect than any
other, because I shall be prepared to show, I
think, that it costs less than any other.
Mr. SCOTT. The expenses of assessing and
collecting the internal revenue taxes are so
blended in the official reports that it is impos-
sible to extract from them the relative propor-
tion of the one and of the other. I have no
data for that purpose. I cannot make them.
But I here wish to correct a statement that
has been made public in regard to the present
Commissioner of Internal Ilevenue, and to
quote him as authority for what I state. He
has been quoted as stating that the income tax
costs more to collect than it realizes. That is
not correct, I believe. The statement which
he did make was that the income tax costs more
to collect in proportion than any other internal
revenue tax.
Mr. SHERMAN. I will ask the Senator if
the Commissioner of Internal Revenue says
that, or has said it to anybody ?
llr. SCOTT. I have seen the statement
made, and not contradicted, that that was his
statement, made before the Committee of Ways
and Means in the House of Representatives ;
not that it costs more to collect the income tax
than it realizes, bat that the income tax did
cost more in proportion than any other tax to
collect. Let that be as it may, I made inquiry
of the acting Commissioner a few weeks ago as
to what diminution could be made in expenses
if the income tax were repealed, and he said
that if the income tax were repealed five hun-
dred assistant assessors could be dispensed
with at once, and that, at live dollars a day,
which is their pay, is susceptible of very easy
calculation. I do not know how long during
the year they would be employed; but for
whatever time it would take it wilf be a dim-
inution of expense of $2,500 per day.
1 now get back to the number who are to
pay this tax and for whom all this expense is
to be kept up'—94,333 persons in a population
of 38,500,000. Now, for the purpose of show-
ing this glaring injustice, I take the voters
according to the last and most reliable data
we have for determining the number of them.
In 1868 the united votes cast for electors of
President were 5,716,082. In Virginia, Mis-
sissippi, and Texas, which did not vote for
President, the votes cast at their elections
