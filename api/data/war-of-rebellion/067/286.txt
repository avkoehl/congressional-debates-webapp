for the reserve and the park attached to it, and was at all times disposable as a reserve and to re-enforce the corps in battle. In this way it did valuable service, taking its full share of the marching and fighting of the army in addition to its special duties. The Second Brigade consisted of six batteries, six 20-pounder Parrotts, twelve 10-pounder Parrotts, four 3-inch ordnance and ten Napoleon guns, 33 officers, 837 men, and 647 horses, under the command of Major J. A. Tompkins, First Rhode Island Artillery. The Third Brigade consisted of six batteries, sixteen Napoleons, and fourteen 3-inch ordnance guns, 24 officers, 734 men, and 604 horses, under the command of Major R. H. Fitzhugh, First New York Light Artillery. The eight 24-pounder Coehorn mortars with 100 rounds each of ammunition were served by a detachment of Fifteenth New York Foot Artillery.

SUPPLY OF AMMUNITION.

Each Napoleon gun and 20-pounder Parrott transported in the chests of the piece and caisson 128 rounds of ammunition, and each other rifle gun 200 rounds, excepting the rifle guns of the Horse Artillery, which had 150 rounds in the chests. The campaign allowance for each gun having been fixed at 250 rounds, there was assigned to each brigade a special ammunition column of ordinary wagons to transport the remainder, which formed in each brigade a reserve for supply of all its batteries. In addition 20 rounds per gun for each gun in the army was carried with the army was 270 rounds per gun. Thus the artillery with the army at the commencement of the campaign consisted of forty-nine batteries, with 274 field guns, of which 120 were 12-pounder Napoleons (smooth-bore) and 154 rifled; 8 Coehorn mortars, 657 artillery carriages, including caissons, battery wagons, and forges; 373 officers, 11,691 men, 6,239 horses, besides 609 wagons and 3,721 animals, for the transport of the ammunition, &amp;c. It formed eight brigades, four of which constituted the reserve under my immediate command, the other four being attached to army corps. The batteries had been carefully and diligently instructed by their commanders, under the supervision of the chiefs of artillery while in their winter camps, and were well manned, horsed, and equipped. At no time, indeed, had the artillery of this army as a whole been in so good condition as when it entered upon this campaign. Its principal defects were, first, a want of general and field officers, a subject to which I called attention in my report of the battles of Fredericksburg, Chancellorsville, and Gettysburg;
