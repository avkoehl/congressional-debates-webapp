ALABAMA.

For reasons stated in the first part of my report I could obtain no reliable numbers indicating the result of the operations of the conscript law in Alabama. In the State department there are rolls of all the men in the State between the ages of sixteen and sixty years, classified according to age. General Watson, the adjutant-general of militia, refused me access to the rolls, saying that "he intended making a report from the rolls to the Governor of the State, who could do as he pleased with it. " A polite letter a addressed to General Watson by me, urging important reasons for wishing to examine the rolls, received no reply. The Governor informed me, however, that the rolls exhibited the names of about 38,000 men, and that five counties had not reported. My estimate for these counties would be about 2,500 men, making the whole number between these ages (sixteen and sixty) 40,500. I was also informed by the Governor of the State that the rolls contained 12,000 names of white males between seventeen and forty-five years of age; then, allowing an average for the counties not reported, there would be about 13,000 between the ages of seventeen and forty-five years, of which (about) 4,000 are between seventeen and eighteen years of age. This would leave (about) 9,000 in the State between eighteen and forty-five years of age. Of this 9,000 there must be 8,000 (about) exempted, leaving about 1,000 still subject to conscription.

Then, of the number found to be in the State (40,500) must be deducted the number between sixteen and seventeen years of age (4,600) and the number between seventeen and forty-five years of age (13,000), making a total between sixteen and forty-five years of age of 17,600, which would leave 22,900 between forty-five and sixty years of age. Of this last number about 6,900 are between fifty-five and sixty and 16,000 between forty-five and fifty-five years of age.

Should the term of conscription be extended to fifty-five years of age the State would furnish-

As it was impossible to obtain an estimate of the number of men who have put in substitutes, they are not included in the above separately, but are probably all included in the 16,000.

MISSISSIPPI.

Some of the State papers of Mississippi, which might have furnished me data for estimating the number of troops in the field, were destroyed by fire in Jackson. The only evidence of the number of troops which Mississippi has furnished for the war is given in the report of the Board of Police to the auditor of the State. An act of the Legislature required the Board of each district to furnish the auditor with the rolls of every man who had entered the service since the beginning of the war. As far as these rolls go, they show an aggregate of 64,982 men. Some of the counties had not completed the rolls, but I estimated that the result will show about 66,982 men.

If we consider them all to have come from the class of men between sixteen and sixty years of age there will remain, after deducting this number from 92,016, what the State should furnish between sixteen
