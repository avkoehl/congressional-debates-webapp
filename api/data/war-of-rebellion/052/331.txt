HEADQUARTERS CHIEF OF CAVALRY,Camp 5 Miles from Winston's, September 2, 1863-7 p.m.

Brigadier General J. A. GARFIELD,

Chief of Staff.

GENERAL: McCook's division camps 1 mile west from Davis to-night. Crook's at Winston's, south of Davis. Wheeler is said to be at Lebanon, which is 24 miles from this place; Rawlingsville is 12 miles from here. We found the march too long to go through to-day. As soon as I get the cavalry well together I will move Wheeler. There has been no important information collected to-day. It is well for the general to know that Winston's is 20 miles from Trenton instead of 10, as the general supposed. My train will not get up to this place until the morning of the 5th. I will move on early to-morrow.

Respectfully,

D. S. STANLEY,

Major-General and Chief of Cavalry.
HEADQUARTERS FIRST DIVISION CAVALRY,September 3, 1863.

General STANLEY:

Wheeler encamped at Alpine, on the Gadsden and Chattanooga road, last night; he marched from there this morning at sunrise in the direction of Chattanooga, supposed to be going to Trenton.
