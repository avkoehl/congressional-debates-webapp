Captain WINSHIP,

Provost-Marshal, Alexandria:

When Booth was last heard from he was near Wicomico River, Md. It is feared he has crossed into Virginia. He had broken his leg and was on crutches. He had also shaved off his mustache. Let your cavalry know these particulars, and let them go down below Aquia and, if possible, connect with the cavalry I send down by boat to-night into Westmoreland County. You need not detain your cavalry any longer. I will send my letter by other hands.

C. C. AUGUR,

Major-General.

Colonel N. B. SWEITZER,

Commanding Sixteenth New York Cavalry:

COLONEL: The major-general commanding directs that you place a battalion of your regiment on board a steamer, which will be furnished by the quartermaster's department, and proceed down the Potomac, debarking on the Virginia shore as nearly opposite the mouth of Wicomico River, probably at or near Nomini Bay, as practicable. Having landed your people you will use them as you may judge best for the discovery of Booth, the murderer of the President, and any of his accomplices who may have succeeded in crossing the Potomac.

Very respectfully, colonel, your most obedient servant,

J. H. TAYLOR,

Chief of Staff and Assistant Adjutant-General.
