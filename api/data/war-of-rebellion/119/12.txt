entirely free from any obligations made by them. It was so distinctly agreed upon between us that there can be no mistake about it. Nothing will make me consent that such men shall be put under any ban or disability by reason of any action of theirs performed on the faith of this notice. You can have your veto as to the future but not as to the past. If any penalties are visited upon them it becomes the solemn duty of the Confederate Government to throw every protection it its power around them. I am sure it will do so.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

RO. OULD,

Agent of Exchange.

CONFEDERATE STATES OF AMERICA, WAR DEPARTMENT,

Richmond, Va., June 12, 1863.

Lieutenant Colonel WILLIAM H. LUDLOW, Agent of Exchange:

SIR: I herewith inclose to you a copy of General Orders, Numbers 11, in the case of Captain Webster. * It is true it is not printed, but yet it is of equal value with your General Orders, Numbers 54. + The printed copies have become exhausted save one which is now kept in the proper department.

As you only send my a copy of your general order when I asked for the record, as the general order confirms everything in relation to the charge against the unfortunate man, which I have heretofore stated in my communications to you.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

RO. OULD,

Agent of Exchange.
