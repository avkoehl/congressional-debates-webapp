Making public officers, depositaries—Mr. Hubbard.
Feb. I63g.
Senate,
different measure. He says that he anticipated a
report fiom the Committee on Finance of a dif-
ferent bill, from the indications of populai opinion
since the last session of Congress,. Considering
thcfiee'and representative character of our Go-
vernment, I admit that the state of public opinion,
at all times, should and would have a controlling
nfluence with every pubhc man, and the Presi-
dent himsel' has not communicated a sentiment
conflicting vv nh iMs safe Republican prmcipk lie
has well said, tbat " the national will is the su-
preme law of the Republic, and on all subjects
within the limits of his. constitutional powers,
should be faithfully observed by the public sei-
vant   "Local elections for State officers have,
however, been held in. several of the States, at
which the expediency of the plan proposed by the
Executive has been more or less discussed. You
will, I am confident, yield to their results the re-
spect due t  every expression of the public voice "
"Desiring, however, to arrive at truth and a just
view of the subject in all its bearings, jou will at
ths same time remember tkat questions oi far
deeper and more immediate local interest than (lie
fiscal plans of the National Tieasury were involv-
ed in those elections. Above all, we cannot over-
look the sinking fact, lhat there were at the time
m those States more than one hundred and sixty
millions of bank capital, of v hich large portions
weie subject to actual forfeituie, othei large por-
tions upheld only by special and limited legisla-
tive indulgencies, and most of it, if not all, to a
gi eater or less extent dependent for a continuante
of its coipoiate existence upon the will oí the State
Legishtuies to be then chosen "
The Senator from Virginia, and the Senator
from Massachusetts, ha/e alluded to the elections
which have taken place in Mame, Indiana, and
New Yotk, as evidence of a most extraordinary
change in public opinion with refeience to this
measiue. This may be so, and it may be other-
wise Que tions having no connection with this
Independent Treasury scheme may have controlled
those local elections; and I submit •whether any
thing unfavorable to the policy of the Administra-
tion is inferrable fiom those lesults. In Manic,
the aggregate vote given foi State Senator  shows a
J>mocrauc majoiny, while the votes for Govei-
rior indicate a different result Roth may equally
txptess the will of the people, and all that can be
niftucd liomth<> result of the Manip election is,
tint the DemccraU candidate for Governor did
not i, nnmaiid the same support that the Democra-
tic candid- ! si r the State Senate received InNew
"i oil , ui ) it is pnfectly clear that fifty thousand
lessvoe^u recast at the last than at I'e not
ptctedm^ elcc'iop On this subject I will say that,
it the the tr< ent incumbent of the Presid atial of-
fice, an I the whole combined force of tl * Opposi-
tion com enlrated in a candidate fnendl to a Na-
tional Bank, or friendly to the State depi site policy,
were now before the people ¡or office, the tcsultof
such a contest would be a fan evpiession ot the
populai will, and, unless I wholly mistake the signs
11 the times, would conclusively show that the
present Male of the public mmd, m lelation to this
question, has been gieatlj misappichended and
gieatly misrepresented
It has been stated, Mr President, that the general
obj ct of this measure was a separation of the Gov-
ernment from the banks And is there any mem-
ber of this Senate who would advocate a continu-
ance of this connection, in the present state ot the
banks themselves'2 .Vo su It then becomes, al
once, a matter of duty for Ci ngress to make ade-
quate provision for the collection, safe-keeping and
disbursement of the public íevenues. The banks
can^Oi be employed as the fiscal agents of the
Government, m their present acknou ledged state of
b'mVruptcj It would be monstrous to require the
Government, m the present state cf affairs, to make
deposite of its funds with these State institutions
The subject, then, is one most emphatically de-
manding lie consideration of Congress
The power of this Government w ould be enfee-
bled, if rj )t endd.ugue.il, uy tnc desttueaon of us
firarciil resources It is the unembarrassed ope-
ration of the fisc il system oí this Government, (hat
gives to it life, vigor aad stability.   And the Con-
gress of the United States would be faithless in the
disehai^e of their high trusts, should they fail to
make ample provision for the safe-keeping of the
public funds What then is to be done? The de-
positories of the public money, under the act o!
June, 1836, have failed to perform their engage-
ments to the Government, and to meet the just ex-
pectftions of the community. TheSecieUry of the
Tieasury, without a direct violation of law, cannot
longer employ these institutions as the fiscal agents
oí the Government. And I am, sir, well sati-fied
that there will be "neither safety or stability, so long
as the connection exists between them and the Gov-
ernment " The time has come then when some-
thing should be done. The Committee on Finance
have reportpd this bill as the result of their reflec-
tions. If it shall be adopted, the care of the pub-
lic iundo will be committed to the chaige of agents
directly lespunsible to the Government, who de-
rive their official existence through the effect of
public law, and their whole duty is denned and regu-
lated by public enactment. They are bound to
collect, safely keep and disburse the public revt-
n ues In this way the Government at once acquncs
the exolusn e control ol the public funds. In the
hands of its own agents, they are in no way liable
to dtpremtion or loss
They cm m no way become the means foi spe-
culation The same funds which shall be le-
ceivcd shall be disbursed But the moment the
public money is m nglul with the money ot bank-
ing coi potations, that moment the control and
management oí the Government funds is put be-
}ond the power of the depaitment charged with
the fiscal operations of the country The duect
benefit lesulnng from the separation is, that the
Government will alwa) s be unembarrassed m con-
ducting us own financial aflairi It must possess,
at all tunes, full knowledge of its own issources,
and, in pursuance of public law, can invariably
command iti own pecuniary means It will be
recollected that the public moneys weie deposited
with the United States Bank, agreeably to the pro-
visions of the clnrtei, subject to the control oí the
Treisuiy Depmlment It will also be recollected
that those deposites were transfened to the State
institutions, and the act of June, 183G, provided
foi the n íulation oí the deposites ol the public
mi in y in those local banks The histoiy of the
connection with the Bank of the Untied States and
with the State institutions furnishes, a lesson ot
experience which cannot be lost upon the country,
and which must ha\ e prepared the public mind
fot the mensure now recommended
I am then, Mr President, foi the bill, because
it piohibits, undei the seveiest penalties, the use of
the public money for any purpose whatever , and
bi e.iusr it secures to the Government the entire
coiitiol ol the public funds Pheie is another
leading object contemplated by the bill, which is,
giadually u effect a change m the kind oí cur-
rency in whit h the public revenues shall be re-
ceived 1 si ould have been entirely content to
have left this matter to the law of 178'J, and to the
resolution of 181G I am not one oí thos.e, how-
evei, w bo regard this provision ot the bill with
any al inn It must be matter ol groat indifference
to banks oí discount whether the revenues oi the
Government sh ill be collected exclusively in gold
oi silver, or whethei m paper equivalent to specie,
andwhirh in ly be conveitedinto specieat the place
where received It pap^r money shall be equal m
value to 1'ie pieciou  metals, the bink issuing siuh
a description oí paper can have no occasion to be
alarmed fiom the \ racimal effect of this measure.
Those banks only whose papti shall be depre-
| ciated, and whose cuculation shall be worth less
than specie, vv ill experience embarrassment from
the operation of this bill It cannot be the object
of the Government to lend its aid to sustain institu-
tions of this character The legalized currency of
tne Government should never be a depreciated
currency. Gold and snvei only have a fixed and
standard value, and all othei descriptions of money
pi s-.ess a mere relative value The public funds
should b" collected in a currency unifoim and of
intiinsiG and equal worth m every part oí the
Republic The operations of the Government
would necessarily result in  pecuniary loss by
making disbursements m a medium liable to any
fluctuation. The, public funds are the ngfetful
property of the Amencaa people, and should" te
received and disbursed by the Government, as
then agent, m a currency recognised by the Con-
stitution and sanctioned by public law.
The revenues of the Government should never
be used m banking operations, because it would
subject them to all the hazard and change to whrch,.
paper money is unavoidably exposed
Eveiy description of a paper currency, from its
nature and character, is liable to constant fluctua-
tion in. its value. Bank paper m one section of
the country may be much more below the value of
specie than in another.
Tríese considerations, Mr President, should in-
duce Congress, at as early a day as may be con-
sistent with the interest and convenience of the
lax-payers, to pi o vide for the collection of the
public revenues exclusively in a currency of a
fixed and standard value, and this is all that the
bill proposes in this respect. It provides for this
salutary change m the most gradual manner—ui a
mannei safe, practical, and convenient.
These are the leading and general objects of
the bill lepoi ted from the Committee on Finance-
And what, sir, are the objections which have beem
urged against this measure'
Pint, That it eatabishes a Government bank,
more odious m its chaiacter, and more alarming
in its effects upon the industry of the country, than,
even was the late bank of the United Slates
If this weie so, how does it happen that every
fnend of a National Bank in this, and in the other
bianeh of Congress, opposes this measure with
eveiy possible degiee of virulence and of hostility?
Not because it is, but because it is not a bunk, be-
cause it runs counter to every principle and privi-
lege of banking institutions—that this bill meets
with such unrelenting opposition. This objection
to the bill, made as it has been by the Senator from
Virginia, and enforced with so much 7eal and
ability, imposes upon me the necessity ol travel-
ling ovct the same giound which has been so re-
cently and so ably occupied by the chairman of
the committee I must ask the attention of trie-
Senate while I examine the details of the bill, with
,i view to answei this most extraordinary, and to
my mind, most unwartantable, objection to the
measure
The first section of this bill, after designating-
suitable and convenient rooms for the keeping of
the public moneys, and giving a locality to the
public treasury, provides that the Treasurer of the
United States, ihall keep all the public moneys u,hich
shall come to his hands in the Treasury of the United
Slates as hneby constituted, " until the same are
d) awn //to eform accm ding to  law "
The second see tion of the bill establishes ceitam
places as public deposito! íes, and defines the jiro-
liculai duties oí the officers charged with the re-
ceipt, «ale-keeping, transfei, and disbuisement of
all such monejs as may be deposited at those
places
The third section designates the duties which
shall be performed by certain Receivers General,
to be appointed and stat.oned at the cities ol Bos-
ton and New York, with reference to the collection
ami disbuisement of the public funds wh'ch may
be deposite I at those points
The fourth section contains substantially the
same provisions as are contained in the thud, and
gives authority for the appointment of Receivers
General to be staiioned at the c fes ol Charleston
and St Lotus, with th ■¡¡ame powers and for the
same purposes
The sixth section, after expressly designating
those officeis to be charged with the collection of
the public money, provides that they sliall keep
safely, without loaning or usmg, all the public money
collected by them, until the same shall be ordered to
be transferred or disbmsed by the proper depart-
ment of the Government
The ninth section provides that the respective
depositaries shall safely keep the public money
tii.1 the sane hall b, disponed ol acoidmg to
law And here, Mr President, I must stop to in-
quire what lineor paragiaph of the first nine sec-
tioas of this bill gives the slightest countenance to
