The taxable property of the State haa in-
creased since 1855 §>295,203,091.
I have no means at hand to ascertain the
aggregate of cases upon the dockets and the
number disposed of; but it may be stated gen-
erally that the business of the courts of the Uni-
ted States, in addition to the normal increase
from progressive causes, has been largely in-
creased of late years by cases arising under the
banking and internal revenue laws. Touching
this extraordinary increase Mr. Commissioner
Itollins, in his report of November 20, 1868,
page 17, says:
'' The proceedings growing out of the organization
of the national banks and the issue of national cur-
rency would alone have almost clogged the already
scarcely adequate judicial machinery in some local-
ities; and sinco revenue cases and proceedings in
bankruptcy have been added the calendars have
been so enlarged that in the principal business cen-
ters a speedy determination of a contested cause
has been hardly expected.*'
And in his report of November 30, 1867,
collating statistics required to be furnished by
district attorneys touching suits in which the
United States is a party, and arguing in favor
of continuing the power to compromise suits,
he says, among other things, (page 32:)
" The courts, too, in the centers of population are
often burdened with cases, and if none are compro-
mised continuances must be frequent, or the courts
themselves largely increased."
The business of the United States courts, in
the southern district of Ohio especially, has
been greatly increased within the last few years
from the extraordinary causes mentioned. The
Miami and the Scioto country has been notori-
ously the scene of the operations of "the whisky
ring," andof extensive frauds upon the revenue
by tobacco rings and dealers. Since March,
1867, statistics have been furnished by district
attorneys; and from these Mr. Rollins reports
for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1867, (from
the 2d of March in that year,) in the southern
district of Ohio forty-eight cases in which the
United States was a party; and at the close of
the fiscal year there were thirty-eight cases
pending, ten only having been disposed of.
And for the fiscal year 1868 he reports three
hundred and forty new cases, of which and
of cases coming Over from the former year
one hundred and eighty-five remained undis-
posed of. And Mr. Delano for the fiscal year
1869 reports two hundred and forty-four new
cases, and one hundred and sixty-seven remain-
ing undisposed of. Assuming that criminal
and quasi criminal cases and cases in rem, in
which the United States is a party, have prece-
dence of civil business, it will readily be seen
that the United States courts in the southern
district are wholy inadequate to dispose of the
business coming before them.
The courts of the United States are held at
very inconvenient places in Ohio, occasioning
great expense to litigants and to the United
States for traveling expenses, mileage, and
fees of witnesses, jurors, and marshals. Cleve-
land is near the northeast and Cincinnati
near the southwest corner of the State. Co-
lumbus, to say nothing of its being the capital
of the State nor of the convenience which
would result to the people of the State on that
account to have United States courts held
there, is centrally located ; and a large portion
of the State could more conveniently and
cheaply attend and litigate in the courts at that
place than at Cleveland or Cincinnati, Columbus
being easily accessible from all parts of the
proposed middle district by railroads. Cleve-
land and Cincinnati, respectively, would like-
wise be easily accessible by railroads in the
northern and southern districts as proposed to
be modified.
The proposed act would, of course, and it
does propose the creation of the usual and neces-
sary new officers; but the salaries of these
would bear no proportion to the resulting
benefits. The fees of clerks and marshals in
