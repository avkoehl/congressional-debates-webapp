Tullahoma, January 31, 1863.

Corps commanders will immediately cause the following instructions, for the government of bridge guards, to be published to all details from your corps now guarding bridges:

I. Officers in charge of bridge guards will be held personally responsible for any damages arising from drift lodging against the bridges in their charge.

II. All the floating wood or logs must be passed through at once, not allowing them to pile up.

III. Should any defect, deemed unsafe, be noticed in the track, the approaching train must be signaled to stop at least one-quarter of a mile from the bridge-in daylight by waving a red flag up and down violently, and at night by waving a torchlight or lantern across the track, and the nature of the defect must be at once explained to the conductor.

By command of General Bragg:
