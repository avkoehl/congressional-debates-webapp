hatchie. Sherman is safe at Collierville. Sweeny and Hatch must look for this retreating force. They are about 3,000 to 4,000 under Chalmers. Let them be punished, if you can come up with them.

Major-General.

LA GRANGE, October 12, 1863.

Major-General HURLBUT:

The following just received:

ON HOLLY SPRINGS ROAD,

Five Miles from Hudsonville, October 12.

General CARR:

Your dispatch just received; am pressing rapidly forward. Colonel Phillips will co-operate with me from Coldwater, and if it is in the power of troops to prevent the enemy crossing it will surely be done. Have heard nothing from Colonel Hatch.

T. W. SWEENY,

Brigadier-General.

My dispatch told Sweeny that Sherman was not captured. I have reason to believe that Hatch is on his way from Salem to Holly Springs, the Third Michigan being with him. I have not heard which way the enemy went from Collierville, but am going on the supposition that he went south.

E. A. CARR,

Brigadier-General.

HEADQUARTER SIXTEENTH ARMY CORPS,

Memphis, Tenn., October 12, 1863.

Major-General SHERMAN,

La Grange, Tenn.:

Sweeny's brigade having been ordered to Holly Springs, I did not move the brigade from here. They will be moved out and relieved from time to time as soon as I can get my wagons ready.

S. A. HURLBUT,

Major-General.

LA FAYETTE, October [12?], 1863.

Major-general HURLBUT:

Arrived here safe. Several trains here from the east; will push them forward at once. Road all appears clear. To-morrow will be a good day to load the trains with forage and rations and send to us. Sent General Corse's division to Mount Pleasant; he will be there to-night, and swing around to La Grange or Saulsbury.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.

LA GRANGE, October 12, 1863-3.30 p.m.

Major-general HURLBUT:

I advised you two days before I left that the true move was for you to send a brigade to Byhalia, and I understood that it was done. I cannot turn Corse back to Byhalia. I must move my division.
