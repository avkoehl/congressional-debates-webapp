APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
*
25th Cong- ••'2nd Scss.
Report of the Secretary of Wa-.
and Foxes, might endanger the peace of otir border
settlements. Sensib'e of the weakness of our forces
in that quaiter, having been compelled, from the
state of our ari-y, to ¡.trip both the inland and
maritime frontiei  of their sari iso is to supply the
army of Plon la with a sufficient regular force,
it was deemed mosf prud-jnt to bring down to the
seat of Government the principal chiefs of thcxe
warlike tribes It is believed to be important to
exhibit to those people the strength of die nation
with v,hich they woull have to con'en 1 in ven-
turing to attack our defenceless border-,, and at the
same time to impress upon thern the advantages
which liw from civil zation With s ieul of
these Tibes it «as made our duty to tieat and it
would hive bejnin a high d'gree lmpiodenl, m the
excited state ot feeling whkh existed among them,
to assemble laige bodies in the neighborhood of
our ungarrisonel posts, thereby cxausing our ut-
most weakness at a pe-iod when it was impo tant
to display our utmost strength The superintend-
ents «ere fheielore instructed to invite them to
> send deputations of then chiefs to Washington,
and on their armal heie, tieatits were negotiated
with several of the tribes, by which large tracts of
land have been purchased, and the object so much
desired by Government, to extinguish tne Utie to
all the Ind an land east of the Mississippi, ntu'y
accomplished. The Sioux of the Mississippi have
ceded their pos ,essions east of that stream, together
with all the islands belonging to them, and aie
to remove to the western shore Tne Winneba-
goes have at lengih agreed to dispose of their lands
in East Wisconsin, and retire to the neutral ground
on the west of the river It is probable that their
sojourn there will be temporary, and theiefore a
portion onl) ot the neutral ground has been allot-
ted to them, with pam s on t) hunt upon the re-
mainder Tne mi*- cms ci die couii i appii>i ti
require the existence of a hue ot fiontier States be-
tween the Mississippi and the Missouri, and the
extinguishment of the Indian title to all the land east
of the Missouri, to the 43° oí north latitude, would
effect that object With that view the Wmneba-
goes would have been at once removed south of
the Missouri, had the country been pievrously ex-
plored, and a tract of land of sufficient extent set
apart for iheir future permanent residence The
situaiion of that tube, fast sinking under the de-
giadmg influences whichsunound them, and pies,-
ed upon by the whites, lenders a a measure of
humanity to remove them promptly across the Mis-
sissippi, but they were given to understand that
they were not to considei the neutial ground as
their permanent home A tieaty, likewise has
been negotiated by Governor Dodge, vn n tne i
Chippewas, by «Inch tnat tri e ceded a large tract
of country east ot the Mississ pp, and have
agreed to íeure to lmds west of thatnvei.
A mistake had been «rami.ted by the surveyors
of the United S'-nes, in de'etmimng the boundary
lii.e of the land ceded to the Government by the
confederated tribes of tne Sios and Foxes bv
the treaty of f-e\ tuilei, ls33, and it was imme-
diately determined to do justice to tae Indian pro-
pnetirs ol th so 1, and ccirect ne mistake The
true line, howt-ver, would have excluded a fine
portion of coumiy, which was already settled and
improved, and wnatevu may be the ultimate
pd'icy the Government may think pronei to adojH
towarus tne scttleis wno improve new and unoccu-
pied lauds, m ordei to acquire a title to them
by future purchase, the Department is of opinion
that, so long as cusfom and tne practice of Go
vernment «anc'ion then a qunng rights by such
means, then claims ought to be respected, and
therefore entered into regoUatif n wi h the Sacs and
Foxes to extinguish their 'die to this s rip of
country, m doing so, it is deeme 1 expedient to
establish a line that will no longer be subject to
doubt or dispute
In this treaty, as m all 'he Indian tteaues con-
cluded at Waih'nglop, ng rd has been pa,d to the
permanent ben'St oí the ■sever?! tubes Provision
is made lor the establishment of schools, as well as
for lastiuctmg the peop e in the arts of husbandry,
and for the Investment of the purchase money
so as to S'cure to the Indians a perpetual rent, a
portiop of which is to be applied m «uch manner as
you may deem most useful and beneficial to them.
Much more remains to be done, m ordei to m-
sure'the faithful application of the funds destined
for the support an I comfoit of the Indians It now
appears that their annuities really go mio the
coffers of the traders, in payment of debts mcuried,
in a great measure, by the idle and dissomte, but
which are changed to the whole na'i m, and paid
out of the common fund The effect < r such an
arrangement is obvious It encomages the v icious,
and dtpuves the industrious of all incentive to ex-
ertion The whole of this suoject is d such vast
importance, boih as itgards the conditimof the
tubes, and the character of the Government, that I
propose to tieat it m a sonara'e report, and to sug-
gest such improvements m the existing laws and
regulations, ?s mav insure the faiihtul application
of their funds to tne ndi idual wants ol th  In-
dians

removing tie Indians beyond the evil influences
which suiround them within the States and Terri-
tories, and which were fast woikuig their desiiuc-
tion, theiecan be no doubt Inns oiigm, the Go-
vernment appears to have been actuated only by
considerations ot policy and p cpediency, but sub-
sequently a bett°r spuit prev ailed m oei intercourse
with the red men, and then lemoval fiom beyond

source, from the diminution of the game, and inca-
pable or unwilling to resort to agriculture for sub-
sistence, tpeir situation became depl irable, and
their distress was still further aggiavated by the de-
cisions which deprived them of ihe protection of
the General Government, and extended the jiuis-
diction of the States over them , The inaptitude of
the Indian character to conform to a state ot 'O-
ciery, moulded and íeguiated nv a sv. stem of laws
based on the punt p e ailhi^tsoi c ' di/ed I't,
and aUiird to give seuuiiy to i s inu'ulo m. pur-

Ample provision has been made lor their educa-

The subject is coi fessetlv dirncuU and embar-
lassing, but the bill introduced into Congress at
the last session, and partuilh acted upon, would
seem to offer a fair prospect of success, and to se-
cure to these Ind'ans the enjoyment of all the ad-
vantages of free go ernment, which the necessity
of streicnmg over them the protecting arm of Gov-
erament will admit.
This scheme has. been submitted to several of
the tribes, and been approved by them, and rr.ay
«ufely be carried m'o effect anil remain in opera-
Sen, and I$<jff fUflw.

and amendments it may require.
Having received information early in the
spring ot this year, from sources to be relied upo ,
that the Camanche Indians had committed out-
rages upon our citizens, and carried off some wo-
men, whom they retained as prisoners, and that ap-
prehensions were entertained of their committing
other acts of hondity, if their complaints were
not listened to and thea grievances redressed,
instructions vere given, with your sanction, to Mr.
A P. Chouteau to repair to that country and as-
ce-tam the facts connected with these outrages,
and the canoes of complaint, if any really existed;
to give assurances of ample reparation and exact
the same lrom them, and to obtain the release of
the pusoners, and restore them to their families
and inends With a view, likewise, of preserving
the peace ol that frontier, Mr. Chruteau was in-
structed to invite this powerful tribe to send a de-
putation to Washington, that they might represent
their own grievances, and, at the same time, be-
come acquainted with the real strength and re-
souicesof the nation they have hitherto deemed
lightly oí, from seeing only a few posts, thinly
scattered along tne fiontiers, and feebly garrison-
ed. It is undeis'ood that Mr. Chouteau has suc-
ceeded in this part of his mission. These measures
ot precaution were taken from the necessity of the
case, without any appropriation or legal provision
foi defraying the expenses, and I respectfully re-
commend that the subject be submitted to Congress
foi its sanction, and the necessary appropriations
asked to enable the Depaitmentto discharge its
obligat ons to Mr Chouteau; and, further, that a
small sum be entrusted to the discretion of the Ex-
ecutive, to be expended on emergencies like this,
leqiiirm  prorppt artnn to preserve the peace of

The report of the Commissioner oí Pensions
«hows the probable increase of the disbursements
for the ensuing vear, raising the estimate from
$1,593,936 to |2,532,149, principally from the ope-
ration of the third section of the law of the 4th of
July, 1836. It will be seen, likewise, from this re-
port, that some legislative action is required to de-
ter persons employed as agents of pensioners, from
defrauding them This appears to be done both
by withholding a portion of the money received in.
trust for the disabled soldier, or destitute widow
a id orphan, and bv chaigmg them an exorbitant
per centage tor collecting the stipend awarded the 
by the bounty of the Government.
Although I do not concur in a former recommen-
d mon to extend the provisions of the pension laws
to   anv other classes than   those   embraced   by
the acts now   m force, I beg leave to  reiterate
that which proposes some legal organization for the
purpose ot establishing a fund for the support of
invalid officers  and the widows and children of
such oí them as may die in the service.   This
may be done by making a moderate deduction from
then pay, to such an amount and in such manner
as rnav be agieed upon by the officers themselves,
¡similar prov isien may be made, in like manner,
for in /alied and die  ibled soldiers, and  the widows
and chikhen of those who die in the service, not
now prov ided for by law.   This provision will be-
core mole necessary should the period of enlist-
ment be restored to ñvs years, a change which can-
not be too sttongly lecomruended.    It is umieees-
saiy to enter into  the  details of these plans for
providing for the support ot invalided officers aad
soldieis and their families. They may be so fram-
ed as to obviate aU the objections which have been
uiged against then adoption, and are called for by
eveo cons.deiation of policy and humanity.    list -
mately connected with this subject is that of the
pay of the officers of the line o( the army.     The
very proper increase of pay made at the last ses-
sion of Congress for the ctvil oncers serving m the
several departments, convevs an acknowledgment
of the ne^e-stty of mcreasr g all salaries of public
servants winch are below a certain amount; a prin-
ciple which applies with great fo'-ce to the condi-
tion of the officers of the army     In pu^uance of
this policy, I would recota net d a moderate in-
crease of pav to soldiers,  r.ori-eetnmissioned and
commissioned nmcer  of th-  m Pe y and infantry
