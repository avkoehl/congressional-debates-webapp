HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,August 13, 1864-12.45 p. m.

Major-General WARREN,

Commanding Fifth Corps:

The major-general commanding directs that you be prepared to move at short notice, and see that the required amount of supplies are on hand-six days' rations in trains and four days' with the men, ammunition, and grain-according to recent orders. The working parties employed on the intrenchments will not be relieved from them, and precautions will not be relieved from them, and precautions will be taken in obtaining the necessary supplies, if they should not be on hand, to conceal the fact that it has reference to any contingency looking to a movement; that is, the commanding general desires you to be prepared to move at short notice, yet wishes that it shall not be suspected by any part of your command that any movements is contemplated as probable.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
