1622
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
April 14,
liberty, and order, such as were never before
guarantied by God to man, were by our fathers
promulgated and sustained, where they once
towed with devout and grateful Hearts, and con-
secrated and dedicated themselves to the protec-
tion and maintenance of those immortal principles
of the Constitution upon which the banners of
our civil liberty were once upheld and sustained,
which was then dedicated to patriotism and truth.
If the gentleman will look there he will see the
statue of General George Washington, the Father
of*tiis Country, appearing in all the majesty of
his national greatness, hovering over the seeneof
disunion, fanaticism, amalgamationism,and abo-
litionism, which is now being enacted around his
colossal figure, uttering from the tomb his fare-
well address to the people of this land, in which
he, in his lifetime, foreshadowed the radicalism
and disunion#of this hour. I wish Washington's
noble spirit would rise from the grave and haunt
the party in power with the noble sacrifices which
first cemented the old Union, and command his
children, North and South, to quell the spirit of
passionand revenge,and, by the compromises by
which he founded the old Union, restore and con-
struct its foundations upon a base that the com-
bined powers of earth and hell could never shake,
and stop this civil war whose infuriated and flam-
ing visage is now appalling the nations of the
earth. There are the portraits of Jackson, Clay,
and Webster, whose spirits are now bright con-
stellations in the sky. When they lived, and
reason, humanity, and Christianity ruled, this
nation was united in principle, purpose, and
movement like ancient.Greece and Rome in the
best period of the history of the world; and un-
der their lule the nation won the highest confi-
dence and gratitude of the toiling millions. They
bore aloft on its banner the sacred woids, " Free
speech, free press, and equality of the States.n
TheConstitution was their shield and theirsword,
and liberty was their watchword. No citizen
was then subject to be driven into exile for opin-
ion Vsake, orarbitrarily anested and inearceiated
in military Inmtiles. No biothers and fathers of
American and adopted citizens then wasted their
lives and fortunes in bloody, civil stiifo, upon
amnesty conditions which would place the black
Ethiopian upon a level and equality with the An-
glo-Saxon. No doctrines of abolitionism and
amalgamationism then caused a civil war to sweep
â€¢ like the raging tempest of death and hell over
divided families, ruined fortunes, blood-stained
fields, stricken homesteads, widowed women, or-
phan children, homeless mothers, decrepit fath-
ers, weeping and mourning sisters, feeble and
unprotected mothers, lonely graves of noble sol-
diers, where no board or tombstone maiked tile
spot, pale and emaciated young brides, wan and
woe-stiicken children, and a dismembered, bleed-
ing, violated,and shattered Constitution. 1 charge
that the accursed one-idea doctrine of abolition at
the North lighted up the fires of revolution at the
South, and caused to be enacted in this land evei y
horror, wrong, and outrage I have just pot trayed.
Although those doctrines have made humanity
wail,nil nature mourn,and angels weep, yet I am
not willing to consent to any arrangement ex-
cept that by which this groat Union, which is so
dear to us and posterity, and upon the restoration
of which hangs the downfall of the monarchies of
the Old World, and the peace, comfort, liberty, and
happiness of ourselvesand children depend, shall
be restored and maintained. The great contest
which is soon to be fought at the ballot-box is a
contest between disunion, radicalism, despotism,
tyranny, perjury, abolitionism, amalgamation-
ism, and usurpation, on the one side, and con-
servatism, liberty, truth,Union, the Constitution
and law, on the other; and the result of that con-
test upon the side of the latter will be more im-
portant to the people of this country and the
nations of the earth than was the controversy be-
tween Persia and Grecce decided by the battles of
Marathon, Piaueu, and Salamis, which gave as-
cendency to the genius of Europe over that of
Asia.
Before proceeding farther, let me make one ap-
peal to the conservative Republicans of the land.
1 imploie you to iook back to the promises that
weie made to induce you to vote for the Admin-
istration in power, and the gross and outrageous
violation of every such promise and pledge.
Upon your action all depends. You are chaiged
with high responsibilities by a patriotic aod
confiding Demociacy. You, in this dreadful
Crisis in the history of the nation, in an evil hour,
hold in your hands the destinies and liberties,
of this noble nation and this great country.
You are governed by honorable considerations,
and desire the harmony and unity of this once
happy people. I implore you in the name of
our God, our families, our children, our liberties,
our happiness, our homes, our property, our coun-
try, and our lives to help us save this nation at
the ballot-box. I invoice Almighty God to give
you wisdom to save this people from all impend-
ing thralldom. I would gladly join you in any
organization that would save our bleeding coun-
try, but you have none; abolitionism and amalga-
mationism have swallowed it up. 1 know of none
but that of the Democratic party.' There is no
other political organization known in heaven,and
there is none on earth, by which the precious ben-
efits of the organic law and libertiesguarantied to
us by ourfathers can be restored and maintained.
Let me also say that those men in the South
who reared the gigantic head of secession upon
the walls of Fort Sumter and attempted to haul
down and trail in the dust that proud banner,
whose glory was destined to wave over the mon-
archies of the world, violated every obligation
dear to man and deserve the condemnation ofevery
patriot, aud especially of the Democratic masses,
whom they, by leaving the Halls of Congress,
so egregiously and outrageously wronged and
brought upon them all the banishments, misery,
and woe which they have since endured, for
standing by the landmarks of the organic law of
the land. The Constitution gave them no right
to secede; they violated their solemn oaths of
office when they witluhew from the councils of
the nation, and by force and fiaud they carried
with them the loyal masses of the South, upon
a charge of oppression which could have been
easily removed had they staid in the Union. I
believe the Constitution gives the power to this
Govei nmcnt to coerce them back. I am for using
the stiongarm of the Constitution to compel them
to return, with the sviord m one hand aud the
offer to them of every honorable compromise and
conciliation by the other, without degrading or
unconstitutional conditions, as the stake is so
great that no true lover of his country ought to
throw one single impediment in the way of a re-
construction. Butalas! for my country,ltissink-
ing under the ladical policy of the pai ty in povvcr,
who are strangling it to death, and diiving all
hopes of icunion fiom the true patriot's breast.
1 am in favor of filling up our ai mies and using
every measure of wise policy and conciliatory
statesmanship to bring this sanguinary strife to a
successful close before national and financial ruin
shall overtake us; and I now solemnly charge
that from the day the President's amnesty edict of
despotism was announced, the war was no longer
diiected against armed rebellion, but against peo-
ple, propcity, and local institutions, for the pur-
pose of stripping States of all political rights;
but 1 prefer to submit to this despotism and fur-
nish men and money, upon the hope that at the
election this fall the Republic will be baptized by
the never-failing waters of libeity, and some one
will be elected President that will listen to the
warning voice of reason aud set at defiance all
usurpations of power. If wo do notgo back to
the solemn pledges made in the commencement,
national luin must be our fate, and we will have
a consolidated despotism or monarchy built upon
the ruins of our Republic. Let us use our armies
to uphold the Constitution, restore the Union,
break down armed rebellion, temper force with
mercy, compromise, and conciliation, until we
bring back the seceded States. Otu whole failure
is chargeable to a lack of statesmanship, and not
to the want of the bravery and patriotism of our
Army, for their valor and braveiy have already
astonished the civilized world. Let us stand by
our noble defenders in the field, by showing them
that their blood shall not be spilled except in de-
fense of our organic law: that their victories are
to bring peace, and that the dignity and magna-
nimity of the nation shall be identified with their
patience, fortitude, and bravery, and the generous
and humane policy of Christian warfare interposed
lor the purpose of restating a lasting reunion of
intercourse and fraternal regard; and that the
patriotic memoiiesof this second revolution shall
cluster around the annals of better days. Let
the act of treason that would destroy the rights
of free speech and'deface the proud fabric of hu-
man liberty be left to the unworthy descend-
ants of our revolutionary sires, who first fired
upon their glorious flag. Let us go back to the
solemn declaration of both Houses of Congress
and the President of the United States, 44 that
this war is not waged in any spirit of oppression
or for any purpose of conquest or subjugation,
or purpose of overthrowing or interfering with the
rights or established institutions in those States;
but to defend and maintain the supremacy of the
Constitution and to preserve the Union, with all the
dignity, equality, and rights of the several States
unimpaired; and that as soon as these objects are
accomplished the war ought to cease."
Under the garb of Commander-in-Chief, impe-
rial functions are to be performed as arrogantly
as ever was performed by Caesar toward the bar-
barian Gauls. On the 11th of January last the
machinery of despotism was set m motion by
a proclamation from Major General Banks, as-
suming soveicignty over the State of Louisiana,
and giving orders for the erection of a new gov-
ernment for the State, to be molded according to
the President's will, not only recreating the State,
but canceling the constitution and laws that ex-
isted previous to the rebellion. Pie says:
" So much of the said constitution and laws of Louisiana
as recognize, regulate, or relate to slavery are hereby de-
clared to bo inoperative and void."
This is the despotic mandate of a Federal offi-
cer not a citizen of the State nor entitled to a vote.
And by another edict he declares that all who will
not take the President's amnesty oath and vote
shall be banished, and their property confiscated,
although the constitution of Louisiana forbids
the imposition of a test oath by Federal author-
ity. To see the nation thusdie is so revolting to
the spiritof republicanism that patriotism shrinks
fiom it iu despair.
The party that are libeling and assailing every
Democrat and trying to destroy our liberties are
men who openly proclaim that the Constitution
is a covenant with death and a league with hell;
that the Union as it was is man-stealing; that the
insurgent States shall not icturn unless they set
the dear negro "free and comply with conditions
and degradations at which human nature shud-
ders; men who crawl and cringe around the foot-
stool of despotic power, and falsely putting on
Union principles as a disguise, have procured for
themselves offices of official emoluments and na-
tional trust, and cheated and defrauded honest
conservative Republicans while they have been
engaged in their usual avocations to earn their
daily bread; who, in common with the radical
secessionists of the South, have been the means
of overthrowing this great and gloiious Union;
men whom the people will yet consign to odium
and oblivion for prostrating the Constitution,
breaking down the Union, and destroying the
rights aud libertiesof thepeopleof America; men
who have used the fiatricidal arm of military des-
potism, usurpation, and tyranny to strike down
the libet tics of the people and trample upon a
hlecdingand desecinted Constitution,and by their
acts driven from the land where the bones of
Washington and Jefferson repose all emotions of
love,gratitude, and admiration foi the old Union;
men who have cued traitor and copperhead into
the ears of every man who has invoked the aid
of a just God in our efforts of compromise to re-
store national unity and peace; and have by their
conduct imitated the bloody treason of John
Brown, who proclaimed from the fatal battlements
of Virginia the doctrine of one portion of the pai ty
in power, whose first lust for blood was satiated
at Harper's Ferry's first bloody scene; men who
have allowed their cowardly and heartless satel-
lites to fatten upon the wealth coined from the
blood and misery of the land, and afterwaida
walk boldly and fearlessly among the people they
have robbed and wronged; who by their legisla-
tion are inflicting upon the people of the border
States, who have suffered the most in this con-
test and shown the noblest and purest patriotism
under the terrible ttials through which they have
passed, further and deadlier evils at the hands of
this Government which they are struggling to
uphold; men who have closed theireyes to frauds
which have nearly, in some instances, destroyed
our armies, and for some minor offense against
