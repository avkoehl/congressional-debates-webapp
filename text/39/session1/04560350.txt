Unsolved, That upon the evidence before this nation
of the starvation and butchery of its soldiers as pris-
oners of war in the hands of the late so-callcd con-
federate government, and of other violations of the
humane usages of nations in that behalf, with the
presumed connivance of the executive head of that
government and theeommander-in-chiefofits armies
in the field, it has becomothedutyof thePresidentof
the UnitedStates to orderthe trial of those pretended
functionaries, and all other ofiicers of that govern-
ment, civil or military, who are believed to have either
authorized or been consenting thereto, before a mil-
itary commission for a violation of the laws of war,
and in case of the conviction of any of them, to exe-
cute the sentence of such tribunals by inflicting such
punishment as maybe adjudged by them appropriate
to the offense.
That under the special circumstances of the case,
the arraignment of any of the leaders of the rebel-
lion for the crime of treason before any of the judicial
tribunals of the country, besides being of questiona-
ble propriety in itself after so long a maintenance of
the belligerent relation, would be attended with no
valuable practical results, from thcconstitutional ne-
cessity of a trial within the lubellious districts, where
the peers of the delinquent will be none other than
the partners of his guilt.

ment by adding the words 11 court-martial or"
before the words u military commission."

reconstruction.
Mr. GRIDER submitted the following reso-
lutions :
Resolved, That thcUnited States Government grants
the power peaceably, or if necessary by arms, "to en-
force the laws, suppress insurrection, and repel inva-
sion;'' but the General Government cannot by any
action whatever destroy itselt nor the State govern-
ments; nor can the State governments destroy either,
or legally disturb the harmony of the whole. A11 the
grants and powers under the Constitution are con-
servative, none destructive; wheiefore all the States
have been and are always in the Union.
Resolved, That when the United States Government
suppressed the insurrection it only vindicated its con-
stitutional power and preexisting rights, and no more;
and the rights and powers of the Federal and State
Governments are all remitted back and assume the
same condition and relations sustained before the in-
surrection, and (except so far as altered or amended)
remain unimpaired and in lull ioree and virtue.
Resolved, Thfit the law of Congress apportioning
Representatives to the several States (.including the
insurrectionary States) under the census of 18(50 is
constitutional and valid, and that members of Con-
gress from all the States, reguhuly elected under said
law, are entitled forthwith to their seats upon taking
the oath of office to support the Constitution of the
United States.
Resolved, That as a generous kindness and cordial
forgiveness consistent with right, now pcace exists,
are the highest attributes of our nature, and as we
must have "one Government, one Constitution, and
one people," the glory, protection, and safety of allâ€”
cherishing these feelings, we say it is untimely, un-
just, and impolitic to insist upon amendments to the
Constitution to operate upon all until all are repre-
sented in the House and Senate.
Resolved, That it is illogical and unconstitutional
to hold that States are in the Union to vote tor con-
stitutional amendments and yet not entitled to rep-
resentation in Congress.
Resolved, That to tax any State by Congress and
refuse to the people representation is contiaiy to the
first principles of the American Government, and is
inconsistent with the constitutional and equal rights
of all the people.
Mr. STEVEN'S. Is it in order to debate those
resolutions?
The SPEAKER. It is not. The resolutions
are referred, under the resolution ot the House,
to the joint committee on reconstruction.
