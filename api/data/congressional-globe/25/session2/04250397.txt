msdtuni, and restrain improper extension of busi-
ness in the administration of the bank.
6.  A prospective redaction in the rate of inte-
rest, so as to restrict the bank to six per cent sim-
ply, or, if piacticable, to only five per cent Banks
now receive at the rate of near 63 per cent, by de-
manding the interest m advance, and by charging
for an additional day. The i eduction may be ef-
fected by forbearing to exact any bonus, or, when
the profits are likely to exceed the prescribed limit
of the dividends, by requiring that the rate of in-
terest shall be so lowered as that they shall not
pass that limit
7.  A restriction upon the premium demanded
upon post notes and checks used for íemittances,
so that the maximum should not be more than,
say, one and a half per cent between any two oí"
the remotest points in the Union. Although it may
not be practicable to regulate foreign exchange,
depending as it does upon commercial causes not
within the control of any one Government, I think
that it is otherwise with regard to domestic ex-
change
8 Every practicable provision against the exer-
cise of improper influence, on the part of the Ex-
ecutive, upon the bank, and, on the part of the
bank, upon the elections of the country The late
Bank of the United States has been, I believe,
most unjustly charged with interfeience in the
popular elections There is, among the public
documents, evidence of its having scrupulously
abstained from such interference It never did
more than to exercise the natural right of self-
defence by publishing such reports, speeches, and
documents, as tended to place the institution and
its administration m a fair point of view belore the
public. But the people entertain a just jealousy
against the danger oí any mterleience of a bank
with the elections of the country, and every ptc-
caution ought to be taken strictly to guatd
against it.
This is a brief outline of such a new Bank oi the
United States as I think, it cslaohshed, would
greatly conduce to the prosperity of the country
Perhaps, on full discussion and consideration, some
of the conditions which I have suggested might not
be deemed expedient, or might require modifica
tion, and impoitant additional ones may be pio-
posed by others
I will only say a word or twt on the constitu-
tional power I think that it ought no longer to be
legarded as an open question There ought to be
some bounds to human controveisy Stability is a
necessary want of society Among those who deny
the power, there are many who admit the benefits
of a Bank of the United Statts Tour tunes, and
under the sway of all the political parties, have
Congress deliberately íiíhimed its existence Eveiy
Department of the Government has again and
again asserted it Fon y j ears of acquiescence by
the people, unifoimity every where in the value oí
the currency, facility and economy in domestic ex-
changes, and unexampled prospenty in the genetal
business ol the country, with a Bwk of the United
States; and, without it, wild disordei in i lit. cur-
rency, ruinous nregularny in domestic exchange,
and general piostiation in the co.nmen e and busi-
ness of the nation, would seem to put the question
at rest, if it is nol to be perpetually agitated The
poner has been sustained by Washington, the
Father of his Country, by Mid son, the Father of
the Constitution, and by Marshall, the Fathei ol
the Judiciary If precedents aie not to bit h'indly
followed, neither ought th<y to be wantonly de-
spised. They are the e^alence ot tintli, and the
force of the evidence is in proportion to the inte-
grity, wisdom, in t patriotism ot those who esta-
blish them I think that on no occasion could there
be an array of greater or higher authority For one,
I hope to be pardoned for yielding to it, in prefer-
ence to submitting my judgment to the opinion of
those who now deny the power, howevei respecta-
ble they may be.
But, Mr. President, strong as my convictions
are, I have no m'enuon of formally presenting any
proposition to establish a Bank of the United
States. Composed as Congress and the Executive
now are, it would be an unnecessary waste of time
to offer snch a proposal,   I should regret 10 s«e a
bank established, unle<¡  it were clearly called for
by public opinion I believe it is now desired by
a majority of the people of the United States. But
of that there does not exist perhips any conclusive
evidence. Let us wait until demonstrations of their
will shall be clearly given, and let us all submit,
and, for one, I shall most cheerfully, to their deci-
sion, whatever U may be Mr C moved that the
petition be laid < n the table

Mr. BUCHA1N \N said that his peculiar posi
tion in regard to this question rendered it proper
that he should make some remarks upon the sub-
ject. He was oppose I to the charter of any Bank
of the United States, be it located where it might
It would, in his opinion, prove to be a great evil to
'he country any wheie and every where It ap-
peared fiom the Senator's remarks that he and his
friends were in favor of the establishment of a new
bank in the city of New York, with Albert Gallatin
foi its president In this inference he thought he
could not be mistaken The Bank was to be new,
n was not to be Mi Biddle's Bank, and Mr Gal-
latin had been eulogized, no doubt justly, is a gen-
tlemm eminently (juilified to conduct a Nation il

Mr B sad he had usen, as a S nator from
Pennsylvania, solemnly to protest against this de-
termination of the gentleman and his friends to
exclude Philadelphia, and to establish a new Bank

the one city or in the othet, yet, if it must exist, he

It was a work of supererogation for the Senator
from Kentucky to have inserted in his charter any
provision to prevent the Government from warring
against the Bank, or the Bank from warring against
the Government For the last few jears we had
witnessed the exception to the rule, but we should
never witness it again Money and political povvei
mutually attracted each other, and werealvajs
ready to rush to each othei's embrace Establish
such a bank as the Senator had proposed, and there
never would be any divorce between it and those m
power The General Government was to be com-
bined iv ith all the State Governments as slockhold-
eis in this institution, and to these sovereignties
were to be added a numbei of wealthy individuals

together in solid phalanx,andun tc them all mdissolu

measure would be the longest stride towards con-
solidation which had evei been made undei the
Constitution, and such a bank would be able and
willing to keep any Administiation in powei which
might call it into pxistpnee The political power
and the money power would support each othei,

and New York will be the seat of empue. This
scheme of uniting all the State Governments as

dividuals, would render it much more formidable
than the late Bank ol the United States (poweiful
as it was) hail evei been

piujet there was no allusion to gold and silver. As
a. ubstnule, he might presume, the Senator had in
trodueed, with commendation, that provision of the
late New York law which required the banks un-
dti it to invest a poition'of their capital m stocks,
for the purpose of ledeemmg their notes in circu-

would prove the greatest humbug of modem times

The povvei to cieate and to cuculate a paper cm-
