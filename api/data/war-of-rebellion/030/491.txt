land Gap, and asked me, after driving the cavalry beyond the mountains, to permit a part of my troops to co-operate with the troops at Cumberland Gap. I instructed General Marshall accordingly, and he informs me that he has now a part of his forces at Jonesville for that purpose. I have received no confirmation of the report that the enemy was moving either on Cumberland or Pound Gap, and think it was more than probable that the report was started by the enemy to divert attention from their real designs on the bridges of Tennessee.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

SAM. JONES,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF WESTERN VIRGINIA,Dublin Depot, January 8, 1863.

Lieutenant General E. KIRBY SMITH,

Comdg. Department of Tennessee, Knoxville:

GENERAL: On the receipt, some days since at Abingdon, of our telegram, asking that a part of my force would co-operate with your force at Cumberland Gap, in repelling a contemplated attack, I directed General Marshall, after driving Carter's force beyond the mountains (if he could not capture it), to hold his troops in position and readiness to co-operate with the command at Cumberland Gap.

General Marshall reports to me that the principal part of his force is now at and near Jonesville, in Lee County, where they will remain until further orders. Please inform me if you still anticipate an nearly movement of the enemy on the gap, or if you have any information rendering it necessary or desirable that any of my troops should remain in Lee County. I take it for granted the Government will order the rebuilding of the bridges recently burned in your department. I will give all the assistance in my power in rebuilding them.

Very respectfully, &amp;c.,

SAM. JONES,

Major-General.

JACKSON, January 9, 1863.

Lieutenant Colonel C. R. BARTEAU:

J. E. JOHNSTON,

JACKSON, January 9, 1863.

General BRAGG, Winchester, Tenn.:

I do not understand your dispatch of yesterday [7th]. If you require command of Chattanooga you shall have it. If you mean that General Smith or yourself must be relieved from his department, I have no power. You have no ground of complaint against me. Answer.

J. E. JOHNSTON,

General.
