form ofReceiveis General, each of which will have its depen
dent rarmficatien1*, in the form of cashiers, tellers, clerks &c
The Treasuier also is to have his "assistants," and an indefinite
brood of clerks is provided for all the oiheers made depositors,
ofthepubhc moneys under the bill, to assist in the dischaige
of the new duties devolved on them Finally, a number oí mis
eionanee are to be appointed, from tune to time, at the discre-
tion of theSecretary of the Treasury, to visit and inspect the
various fiscal agencies cieated by the bill Now, here is a
cloud of new Executive officers at once, which bids defiance
to calculation But if their pi esent number could be estimat
ed, (as the Senator from New York has attempted to do ) it
would be altogether useless, for they must, from the nature of
things, be constantly and íapidly multiplying Would the
honorable Senator attempt to meaoui e the using cloud whu h
threatens to overspread and blacken the whole face of the
heavens, by the speck, '«no bigger than a man s hand,' winch
has just appeared on the edge of the houzon? This 10 but the
beginning; and we all know with what vigoi. and fruitiuhiess
every things gi ows on Amencan soil Receivers General ai e
allowed by the bill, at present, only to Massachusetts New
York, South Caiolma, and Missouri But will not Maine New
Hampshire, Connecticut, demand then Receiveis Genet *1 as
■wellas Massachusetts Virginia, Noith Caiohna, and Geoi¿n,
as well as South Parolma7 Kentucl y Ohio and rennesb&e , 1
■well as Missouri* And so m íecaid to all the othei folates that
are now pretermitted in the bill if we have Receivers Gene
ral, we must finally have l'ayeis Gcneial, )u this is an mil

skilled in questions of finance, expressed the opinion to mo « n

der such a power possessed by theSecietaiy of the Tieisui}
alUheofftceis connected with the opeiations oi theTn t ury
would be converted into the tiembhng vassals oí the Executivt,
A direct removal fr)m o/hce is a measuieof moic than oidi
nary energy, and involves lesponsibibty    Cabe=; might exi*t in
which the Secretary of the Trtjasuiy would be unwilling to  ,
j lake the responsibility of a direct removal horn office, and yet
would accomplish the same object by a vexatious leqmsition ol
a new bond, in solaigea sum that the officer could not, or would
not, find sureties m the i no ea^ed amount Whodoeb not ^eethat,
under such aregulation, the officers of the Treasury would lose
all eeneeof independence, and that those who could consent to
hold office on such terms mu&t be prepared to become the pas
siveand unresisting toolsof powcrl Heretofore, itbas been the
wise policy of our legislation to fix by law the sum in which
official bonds are to be given, and to leave nothing 311 that re
spect, or as little as possible to Executive discretion Again,
vtwiilbeseen, fiom an exammitum of the bill, that the com
peneation of several of the officers to be appointed under it,
buch as visiting agents, t lei ks, &c is to be fixed by the Secre
taiy, at his ditcieuon, arid not by law Here is auother source
of bervile dependence on the one hand, and of increased Execu
tive influence on the other, which is not m harmony with the
general spirit and maxims of oui legislation
My attention has also been attracted by a provision of the
bill which seems to me to introduce a most dangeious innova
tion in the established foimsand usages ol theTieasuiy It has
heieto'bie bee  a fixed principle of fiscal responsibility that no
money should be diawn from theTieasurybut upon a warrant
of the becretaiydrawn on theTreasurei, tountertigned by the
Comptroller, and rounded by theliegi^teiiand upon that war
ranUwhen itiearhes the hands of the Treasurtr thusauthenti
cated, the Tieasurer draws his draft on the depositary ol the
public menty kn paymtnt The^e foirpa havf alwiysbeen
held to he vtry impoiunt checks and indispensable piehmi
nines to any mom y being diawn out of the Treasury, or in
other wordb, paid by the depositary ol the public moneys The
Secretary draws his warrant upo  the Treasuier, subject to the
checks befoie mentioned, and then the Treasuiei diaws upon
the depoaitary who is to make the payment But in no instance
does the Secretary draw directly upnn the depositary, because
that would be to lose the security of th( mtei mediate checks oí
the Comptiollei and the Registei By the 10 h section of this
bill, howevei in contravention of these established punciples
and chicks, in* exmessly provided that "for the puipot-e of
I aymentson the public account it shall be lawful foi the said
fecciet n y to (haw upon any of the said depusitai tes. as he
may think nn t conducive to the public inteiest, or to the con
unnnu 11 the public auditors 01 both" Tinder this prnvi

Twill now Mi PicMdent, follow the Senatoi from New York
[Mi Wright] in the remarks he made on the compilative
safety of the two systems pioposed foi keeping and disbursing
the public money Although expenence the onlv safe aibi
tci,hw loeg «met settled thif question, the honorable Senator
argued Jta& if it were still oven ¡o doubt, and made I am free
to admit, an exctedingly msemous and plausible aigument
He instituted a parallel between the two systems m legaid to
ihegrtut hading points on whieh then safety is supposed to
depend and in eieh instance biought out a substantial equah
iy Inst as 10 ojfitas he '-aid it would be fair to piesume
that the ofíiceu t the Government and the officers of the
banks would be equi'Iy trustworthy Then as tosurftieojie
said boh the b cs and the Government officers aie equally
itqjnel to evo suuue*, if deeuifdnece^aiy ^o, hkewist,
i? to vanhs the Government ofíicers, he said, aie tn he pro
vidtd with 1 aulis as well a^ the banks The onlv paiticulai
then in which the banks, at, he alleged could be supposed to
piesent a betttr guaianly for the saftty of the public lunds, is,
that then capital stock is pledged touheieimhursementof the
public moneys committed to them, but this advantage in favor
oí the banks he veiy adroitly balanced by what he represented
to be the ri*Aof mingling rhe Government funds with thos eof
trading corporations Kow all this is very fan and plausible
on the surface, hut what is the fact—viHt is the testimony of
expejience?
While the honorable gentleman was running this parallel m
theory between the two systems, theie was a document lying
on the table of the oiher House which had run the same pa
rallel on the sui er foundations of practice I allude to a ret ent
report of the Secretary of the Treasury, m answer to a call of
that House, at the extia sessiooj made oa ihe motion of an ho
norable fnend of mine, [Mr Garland of Virginia,] containing
a list of all "the leceivers, collectors, or depositories of the
public money, who aie in default to the Government, with the
amount of then respective defaults," act What, sir, dees
this document, which I now have before me, show? Thai, the
whole amountof balances duefrom the banks, which are deem
ed unavailable, is a little more than one million of dollars,
(l,04b,649,) and these balances go back to a period long past,
when the extraoidmary embairassments consequent on the wai
involved banks and individuals m difficulties beyond any foimei
or subsequent example In relation to the banks which have
been recenllytmployedasdeposuories, itappears that they have
either paid up all they owed the Government, 01 aiemthecour&e
of paying itunascalled for by the wants of the public sei vice,
without any apprehension of default on their pait, or avail
mg themsehts of the indulgence of the act passed at the
late session of Congress, have eithei secured or aie expected
to seen aatiüfaetorily the paymei t of the whole balances due
from tht t iccortling to the terms of that act Only eleve n
of them it appeals, out of near ninety employed as deposito
ríes, have even asked indulgence under the act here refeired to,
and bu 1 single one of then  has been 01 dered to be sued Now,
sir, w! en we look to the list ot individual collector and re
ceiveis what do we sec? An agrégate default of about three
millions ■ And though some of the more recent balances ap
peanngon the list may be reduced by future ullections, yet,
fiom the long Handing* of most of them, there is no reason to
believe that the aggregate amount of the entire list will be af
fected m any sensible degree uy these partial recoveries It is
to be remarked too that this list does not include disbursing of
ficers^ "whose mdebtednes ," is stated by the Secretary "tobe
very great, ' and the actual looses by whom I showed, during
the latesessionof Congress, noma repoit of Mi Ciawford, to
have "greatly exceeded" a million and a half of dolíais, from
17S9 to 1819, and by this time have grown up, in all probability 
to anothei aggregate sum of tlu ee millions ' Neither does this
libt include officers ol the Post Office Department, among
whom itwas^hownby official documents, at the last annual
session of Congre&s, that there weie as many as eighteen hun
tired andthiity two defaulters' Itis to te obseived also that

Now, t>ir, if tht honoiable senatoi horn New "\ 01k ha I taken

wiuulie blunt eoiih deletion ol i acts which tins document pre-
sents, I was strongly lemnnled ol an anecdote I have often
heard of ihe late veneiable Bishop Madi&on, of "Vngtiua That
excellent prelate was also a pioiound philosophei, and much
addicted to philosophizing On one occasion, he undertook to
explain" why the shade of a lamp, almost in contact with the
flame tl the candle beneath, was not, in any degree, heated by
it This he did by a teamed disseitation the laws of caloric, and
ni the othei bcienuftc data which could be brought to bear on
the subject Having completely saiished lumt.elt, and the ad
miring mdience winch burrounded him, of the truth of his the
ory he could not avoid in tht consciousness oí his triumph,
putt ins his htind on tht lamp &h ule, which hut bten the snh
jett of his acquisition, when an exclamation of acute pain
diseloaed (lie fact that Ins hand had been seveiely burnt m the
application Nature, thus, contradicted the philosopher, and
ho stubborn facts will sometimes confute the most abtute logi
tian I cannot but think that if the honorable Senator from
New'iPik at the closs of his very ingenious argument, had
laid hte hand upon this document, he must have felt his fingere,
at least a bttlfi scorched
lias the honoiable Senator forgotten the emphatic testimony,
leduced fiom a careiut collation of facts borne by the present
Socretmyof the TreabUiy only three yi irs ago, to the supe
nor safety of banks as deposit ones  of ihe public money? let
me, then, refiesh his reco lection by leading to him and the
Btnate an exfiact from the able report of that officer, made to
Congress in December, 183-Í, on the system of keepm? and dis
bursmg the public money
It is a smsulai fact,' says theSecietaiy, "in piaise of this
tlescuption of public debtois, the ¿elected banJcb, that theie \D
not now due on deposites, Irom the whole ol them which have
now s'opped pa} ment, Irom the establishment of the Constim

tnhty ef an oath If we include the whole present dues to the
Government fiom disciedited banks, at all times and of ail
kinds, whether as depositories or not, and embrace even coun
terfeit bills and eveiy othei specits of unavailable funds, in the
Trea^Uty, they will not exceed what is duefrom tiro such
firms "
He thtn continues—
'il our iormei small losses by them, (the banks,) m keep
mg and paying over the public levenue, under circumstances
so very adverse, aie compared with our large fosses either in
collecting or dt&burstng that revenue, then present safety
seems to be as great as 's consistent with the usual operations
ol the paper system, or with the credit which must always be
entrusted by Government m some way or other, to agents of
some kind in 1 eeping the pub! c money In considering their
salt y, it should be corstantly recollected that the owners ard
managtrs ot banks when proi eily regulated by legislative
provisions m then chattel", arc, like 0 nt,i individuals, inte-
rested to tian°act business securely, are desirous of making

preference m ease of failuie, belonging to dt positors ai d
hoi lei of then hi'is over the stoekholdtis united with the secu
rity if not priority, given to the Government, render them nj
point of safety, generally, Much superior to individual agents
of the United States  
Iftherebeany fact mcontestably established in our history
and by the expenence of all other Governments, it is the supe
rior safety oí banks ad depositories over any individual cus
