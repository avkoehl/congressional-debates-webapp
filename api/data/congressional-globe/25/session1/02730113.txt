event the assets of the bank were to be disposed of
for the benefit of al! cone crned, it is not unieasc na-
ble to believe that they would take care to guard
against the occurrence of such a contingency, by
precautions better than those which lave been
generally wed This being true, heie is a simple
mode in w hich the suggestions of the Message can
be responded to, not inconsistent with the Constitu-
tion of the United States, which does not in the
slightest degree encroach upon the authority of the
States to grant bank charters or interfere with the
personal immunities intended to be secured by such
grant , and n has none of ihe sttunutes of the
measure proposed bv Mr Branch, and opposed by
Mr  Van Burén m 1827
There are othei modes m which the great object
of the Message—a remedy against depieciated
currency—could be furthered through the instru-
mentality of a bankrupt law, not mconsistcrt with
the doctrines contended for m 1827 But it is
unneces^arj to dwell longer on the subject
Enough has been said to show that the President
has rot exposed himself to just censure or denun-
ciation, and that the Committee on the Judiciary
has discharged faithfully the duty imposed on it
by the House
Mr T bad arisen to establish those tw o posi-
tions, and not to entei into the debate at large, and
having said ail that he thought needful for that
purpose, he concluded
SPEECH OF MR. \\ RTGH I\
O* New \ orne,
In Senate, Octoba   2, 1837—The bill rtpoittd by
the Committee on Finance, imposing ddditioiid'
duties as depositories ol the public money, upon
ceitain publ c (ffcer , and the. amendmei t there-
to,  offered  1}   Mr   Calhcin, to   puscribe the
currency to be leceived in pajmeutof ll e public
dues, being under considerado i—
Mr WRIGHT said, but for his situation upon
the committee, which reported the billupon the table
lie should nc t only not ieel it to be his duty, but he
should not even feel excused, for occupying the atten-
ti n of the Senate at this time, and adding to this
airead} full delate     Indeed, so extensively had all
the mipoitant pom's presented by the vanous pro-
posito na been   refened to, and ably debated, by
those who had pececded him, that he should feel
justified   in f e ervmg silence,  had   i ot  certain
charges I ecu made cgain t ti e commitiet  touchu g
trfe discharge of   ne i dune   which he fell himself
compel'ed io  noace       He did not use the ttim
" charges ' in any offensive or improper sense, but
a  expiessmgstiong differences of opinion between
himself and tbo-e who had complained
The referei ce or this and all the other impor-
tant subjects \\hn.h hnd occupied the attent on of
the Senate during its pi ¿sent session, lo a single
committee, tboujii stiicdy appropriate, had neces-
sarily devolved upon the members of th.it con''nut-
tee some ¡aboi, great anxteij, and high and deli-
cate re^onsuilities It was impossible, the-efoie,
taatany one of them, and most especially any one of
the majority of ne committee, who had concuired
mils repoils, could have listened to this debate
with any otner fiVn the most interested feelings,
iior could the} pass in silence, chaiges of msensi-
bilitj to the crisis, and its influence upon all the
citizens of the countiy, oi of a culpable neglect of
any imp rUm duty confided to them What then
were the charges to which he had le'erred'
Tie fast wa- that the commitlee had confined
their delibera'ions, and the measures thev had pro-
posed, oim.pl> to Inc. want-, of the Government, in
disregard of Ihe higher and paiamount wants of
the people It 1 ad been said that the great and
ímpolart pulpo e of this txtra contention of Con-
giess was to íelievc me people, and that the wants
of the Government were secondary and ummpoi-
tant in th  comparison He did not himself un-
deistard this new doctrine of a sepatat on of in-
terests betweo the Government and the people
He had supposed that the wants of the peop'e,
which it w as withm the const tut onal pow ei of the
Governmei t to íeheve, were, oí necessity, the
wants of the Government itseif f nor could he un-
8
derstand how it was possible that the Government
could have any want, which was not a w ant of the
people. The public Treasury wants money Is
that a want of the Government and not a w ant of the
people' For what is the money wanted' To carry
out the deaiest interest of the people, m all the ob-
jects of a good Government, of a Government of
their own choice. Why is the want of money for
the public Treasury a want of the Government''
Simply because it is a want of tne people, inas-
much as, without it, their Government can not be
earned on.
He would examine, for a moment, the measures
which the committee had reported to the Senate,
that, id that way, it might be seen what w as their
tendency and effect, and how far the committee
had been derelict m their attention to the w ants of
the citizens generally, or in proposing such mea-
sures of relief as tne Government could properly
adopt He certainly did not intend to discuss now
measures which had passed the Senate and gone to
the House many dajs smce, but he trusted a refe-
rence to these measures, foi the purpose he had
avowed, w ould be not only pardonable, but proper
The first was the bill to postpone the transfer of
the fouith instalment of the deposite with the
States The committee found (hat the existing law
made it the duly of the Secietary to make this
transfer to the States, of about nine and one thud
millions of dollar--, on the first day of the present
month, on yesteiday. They found that the means
m the Tieasury, from which aloneitcould be made,
were m the late deposite banks, and in the deferred
andunpaidmerchants'bondsforduties Ifthe trans-
fei must be made, the banksand the mcrchantsmust
be called upo i loi immediate pa) ments,to enable the
Treasury to make it Consequently, the^uaomers of
the banks, and of the merehant-, must be called
upon to pay them, th<>t the) might be able to pay
ihe Gov en ment The com nittee supposed it ni-
pohtie, to make the r all,and oppress the debtor citi-
zens, merely that ti e Treasury m'ght obtain the
money to transfer foi safe-keeping. They consi-
dered it wiser and better to postpone the tiansfer,
and gire time to the banks and merchants to pay
Therefore they presented the bill in question and
was it not a relief bill' Did any one look on it as
a relief to the banks and merchants onl)' Did any
one suppose that the banks actual 1) had in their
possession, locked up m their vaults, the money
they owe to the Government, or that the merchants
were in funds to pay then de' rred bonos without
a call u¡ on the iu-tc i rs' On he coiirai),did
not all know th t ue banks hi I loa ed ihe emx-
nevs m theord na y course of tien banking opera-
tions, and that the) could not pay without collect-
ing m these'oans at this difficult period for bor-
rower to pa}? Did not Jl know that the inability
of the importing mercnanls to pay, proceeded iiom
the inability of their customers to pay, and that, if
pressed fu pivmcntbv the Government, toe} must
nre--s tho^e custo nc- ' Anl nhoa'P the custo-
mer fthebenks and t! - merchants' Are they
not the peop e, and the whole people' Would any
one say, tnen, that th s w as not a lei ef bdl' That
this was a bill foi the Government, ?nd no' foi the
people'
Ihe second bill reponed by t'.e committee, was
to authorize the e assion of ten mdlions of dolíais
m value of Treasury rotes, in this form to borrow
upon the credit of the Ur ited States the sum of ten
millions ot dollars in mone)—and for v hat' To
enable the Treasuij to get ji , and giant time to
the debtor banks and 'neicha its The commit ee
fourd the Treasury n want of means to answer
theor'mai) cal's upon it, and that those means
mo-t be leahzed, ei her from a prempt collection of
the demands due <o it, oi from moneys raised upon
the pub'ic credi Foi the reasons which induced
t^Tn to lecorrirond a po (ponement of tr> fur'her
deporte with tne States the} vveie also induced to
present this bill to the ¡senate, f ml thus, so far as
the current ca Is upon i e T-e-su-y should leqmre
i', tu interpose th  ¡ v'ic cicdit be'ween the warts
of the Gov crin ent and the rigid collection of its
duts V s th s o 11 to be consideied in the meie
light of a ciip ft r the Government v ithonf regard

aliected b) a  piompt and ¡igid collection  oi the
public dues' Not the Government, or the Tieasn-
ry, but the public debtois Who were the public
deotors' The banks and the merchants immedi-
ately the borrowers from the ban ^s and the custo-
mers of the merchants substantially And who
were the borrowers from the bonks and the custo-
mers of the merchants but the people of the coun-
try'
The third bill repoi 'ed by the committee was. to
grant time lo the importing merchants upon their
bonds due, and to become due, for a year from the
present time The extension, as assented to by the
committee, and ordered b} the Senate, Was nine
months upon each bond Would any one question
that that was a rebef measure to the merchants'
Did any one suppose that the relief aflorded by
that bill wras designed to reach no farther than the
meichants who owed the bonds' No, sir It was
the customers of those meichants, ihe persons who
had purchased for consumption and use the goods
upon which the duties were pasable, that the bill
was to leheve Few, comparatively, of those who
occupy these seats would have voted for that
measure, had its influence and action been confined
to the merchints only But thev could not indulge
their debtors unless they could be indulged by the
Government, becaose they mu>t collect if they
must pay To enable them to grant the indulgence
w hich the state of the times and the condition of
the monetary affairs of the country demanded, was
the design and object, and would be the effect, of
the bill Who, then, would deny to it its relief
characlei'
The fourth bill vv hich the committee presented
for the acceptance of the Senate, was one to extend
a proportionate indulgence to ihe late deposite
banks for the payment of the balances remaining
due fiom them to the public Treasury It was true
that these institutions stood upon a different footing
from the merchant They had merely received
Ine public inon-ys for safe keeping The moneys
were legally and techn cally m ihe Tieasury, but
were they there in fact' Could the Treasurer
co nmand them for the uses of the Government or
the people' No They weie unavailable funds in
theTieashry And why were they unavailable
funds' Bcau^e the banks had < ot them locked m
their vaults, and were not willing to pay them upon
demand' No, sir but because the banks had
them not, because they were loaned to the cus-
tomers of the bank % the cit.zens of the country,
who could not payond<n,"nd The relation of
debtor andcredi cr, in isn'1 riy acceptation, was
not intended te Le eu't d by tne 'a.v establishing

agency for the safe keep ng of the nionev, which
the law ncorntsed, b t that agency In 1 been
turred into the relation of debtor and creditor by
the failure of the binKS to filfil on their pirt—
into the most unpleasant jelauon of debtoi and
credi'or, a ei editor who wants and debtors who can
not pay Indulgence, thcietore, became a matter
of interest to the cieditoi, as adding to the chances
of eventual pa) nent, and of f-' or to the debtors,
as giv ing them time to collect the means lor pay-
ment To whom, then, was the favor, the telief,
extended' To the banks or lo their customers'
M< st assuredl) to the lattei 1 be banks could pay
if tnev c raid collect, and, if compelled to pay, they
woud be compeled to collect Their power to
mdu'ge depended upon the indulgence extended to
them, and could it be said that a me-sure giving to
them four, six, and nine mon lis, to pay their
balances to the Treasury, was a measuie so'ely
confined to the protection of the Government,
without reg<trl to the relief ol the people'
These were the first four bills presented by the
committee to the Senate, and )ei they were'old
