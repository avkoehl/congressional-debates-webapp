THfi^CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
May 10,
cretions liave unfitted them for duty. Sir, the
law provides for the disabled, from whatever
canse it may be, uow. It' I find a sick and
wounded soldier or a dying soldier I do not
stop to inquire, and by my permission this
board shall not inquire, whether his sickness
or disability arises from his own follies or from
exposure in the service which he had endured.
Who is to be the judge? I come before that
hoard with crippled limbs and broken and
shuttered frame, and the honorable Senator,
silting in judgmentup©nme,says, " This is the
fruit of your own indiscretionwhile I plead
as eloquently as I can that it is the result of
my exposure in the defease of my country,
\\ ho is to determine? Where is theliue to be
drawn? Better by far that this Government
should sup port tour hundred andeighty officers
in idleness than to drive the dagger of iugrati-
lude into the breast of one deserving soldier.
Better a thousand times that the Government
should bear this imposition, if you please to call
it so, than to do injustice to a single man who
has dared the dangers of battle and dared the
dangers of climate.
1 do not know but that this measure will
carry; but I shall have the consolation of know-
ing that I did what I could to defeat it; and in
theday of judgment, when the wounded and the
sick and disabled soldiers shall stand arouud
me, accoutered differently from what they are
now, I shall receive iheir commendation in that
final hour.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ques-
tion is on the amendment proposed by the
Senator from Missouri, [Mr. Drake,] to insert
after the word " October,'' in line five of sec-
tion two, the words 1870.''
Mr. ROSS. The Senator from Massachu-
setts dropped a remark a few moments ago,
the truth of which is patent to everybody, and
the fact has elicited exclamations -of astonish-
ment and commendation the world over. That
was, that no nation was ever so generous to its
soldiers as this nation has been. I trust that
it will always be the case, that no stain of in-
justice or ingratitude will ever mar that record,
it is also true that bo nation was ever so faith-
fully served by its soldiers as this nation has
been,
Mr. President, I represent a State four out
of every five of whose citizens were members
of that great Aro^y which championed liberty
on a thousand fields* and I fa&l that I should
be derelict in my duty to them, derelict to the
memory of that contest, and untrue to a sol-
dier's recollection of their great patriotism and
unseltish devotion, were 1 to consent to this
proposition. I have listened attentively to the
lucid and comprehensive explanation of the
Senator of his amendment, but I fail yet to see
the justice or propriety of it. I fail to see the
justice of putting it in the power of the Presi-
dent or of any man to give to these gentlemen
the polite invitation that we give in this bill,
" Unless you choose to resign within the space
of the next six months or four months, you
shall be mustered out." I hope that the time
at least will be extended. I have suggested an
amendmentsimply to perfect the bill if it should
pass at all. I am opposed to the proposition
as it stands, or as amended even. But if it is
to pass, I hope it will be with my amendment.
Mr. SAWYER. I should like to ask the
chairman of the Military Committee a question
in regard to section fifteen. If I understood
him rightly, the pay proposed in section fifteen
will be a considerable increase of the present
compensation in the aggregate. Am I right?
Mr. WILSON. Yes, sir.
Mr. SAWYER. How much?
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question
before the Senate is on the amendment proposed
by the Senator from Missouri to section two.
Mr. SAWYER. I was aware of that; but I
have a special reason for desiring this inform-
ation at this moment if the Senator will give it
to me.
Mr. WILSON. What is the question?
Mr. SAWYER. I want to know the amount
of inciease in the aggregate expenses of the
Army made by section fifteen over the present
-compensation.
Mr. WILSON. I answer the Senator upon
the presumption, which is a fair one, that fuel
and quarters in kind which the officers are to
I receive will be the same as the commutation
I for fuel and Quarters. There cannot be any
; doubt about that, in my judgment, for the pro-
vision is that they shallhave fuel and quarters
in kind according to existing regulations. I
am told that in the cities it will increase the
expense ; that fuel and quarters in kind will
cost more than the commutation. Whether
that be so or not, leaving that entirely out of
the question, taking the pay proper, every colo-
nel in the Army, if he has served less than five
years, has an increase of $76-4; if he has served
twenty years he has an increase of $1,320.
There are sixty-eight colonels.
Mr. SAWYER. The Senator will pardon
me for interrupting him. I listened to those
details, but I want the aggregate increase.
Mr. WILSON. If the officers of the Army,
when we have reduced them down to what we
really need, should be all officers who have not
served five years, so as not to receive the ten
per cent, increase iu lieu of the service rations,
the aggregate of increase will be about five
hundred thousand dollars. If they have been
in the service for five years it will be some
two hundred thousand dollars more. In fact,
with the exception of the generals of the Army
and the chaplains of the Army, by the House
bill every other officer of the Army has had his
pay increased ; aud I will tell you exactly how
much increased. I have figured it out with my
own hand. A colonel receives an increase of
$764, without any reference to the service ra-
tions or the ten per cent.; a lieutenant colonel,
$554; a major, $340; a captain of cavalry,
$342; a captain of infantry, $262; a lieuten-
ant on staff duty, $223; a lieutenant, mounted,
$142 ; a lieutenant of infantry, $82 ; a second
lieutenant, mounted, $82 ; of infantry, $42.
That is without any reference to the ten per
cent., and that makes an increase of about half
a million dollars.
Now, supposing these men are entitled to
one ten per cent.—and I suppose they would
average nearly two—it would be about seven
hundred thousand dollars. If they were all en-
titled to the additional ten per cent, for twenty
years' service—and a great many of them are
now—the increase would be $1,154,000.
Mr. SAWYER. Will the Senator be good
enough to inform me whether there is no cor-
responding saving by taking into consideration
the rations, the commutation for rations, ser-
vants, &c. ?
Mr. WILSON. The commutation.ofrations
is $108 for every five years.
Mr. SAWYER. The point I want to get
at is, does the Senator count all those rations
in the present pay in comparing the present
pay with the provisions of this bill?
Mr. WILSON. Certainly they are all in. I
have the entire list made here. It is as fol-
lows:

Mr. SAWYER. Then I understand that in
stating this increase the comparison which the
Senator has made between the entire pay as
now fixed by law and the entire pay as pro-
posed by this bill has been fairly stated in the
figures he has given us.
-Mr. WILSON. Certainly.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ques-
tion is on the amendment of the Senator from
Missouri, [Mr. Drake.]
Mr. WARNER.. Mr. President, it strikes
me that the most important feature in this bill
is the first section; and it seem3 to me that a
more, inopportune time could not have been
chosen for reducing the Army of the United
States. The committee have presented here a
proposition to reduce the Army of the United
States just at a time when the whole Indian
border is exposed; when the entire country is
alarmed at the prospect of a murderous Indian
war; when the United States garrisons upon
the frontier are actually surrounded and con-
fined to their forts by savage Indians, and when
every section of the country is being stripped of
its troops and are,being hurried forward to save
our soldiers from capture and the tomahawk.
It is proposed to reduce theArmy at a time when
this Chamber and the other Hall ha.ve been
ringing with clamors for protection ; when the
spectacle has been held up here of the failure
of this Government to protect its own citizens;
when the Senator from Indiana [Mr. Morton]
and other Senators here have recited a long
catalogue of outrages, of violations of rights
of property, of destruction of life in large sec-
tions of the country. At a time when the
General of the Army and the President of the
United States are being beset every day for
more troops to protect American citizens, it is
proposed in advance to fix a time when the
numbers of the Army shall be reduced.
The troops have already been ordered away
from the State of Kentucky, where they served
by their mere presence as conservators of the
public peace, and I am already admonished
