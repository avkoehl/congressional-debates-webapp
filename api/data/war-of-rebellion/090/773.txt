(Received 1.30. p. m.)

Hon EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

A scout named Marsh, sent out by Brigadier-General Tyler, has returned from Virginia and reports as follows: The enemy came 30,000 strong. They now have 15,000 cavalry, the latter under General Vaughn. The officers and men he saw knew of no re-enforcements. He brings a rebel flag, taken while in the mountains near them. The divisions of the enemy are commanded by Ramseur, Rodes, Gordon, Breckinridge, and Vaughn. Breckinridge has but 5,000 men. Marsh will be able to report the condition of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. He brought four deserters from the rebels with him and delivered them to General Duffie. Thinking him reliable I have sent him to Major-General Sheridan.
