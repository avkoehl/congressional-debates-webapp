Honorable C. A. DANA,

Assistant Secretary of War, Washington, D. C.:

Your dispatch of this day just received. I can send 2,000 or 3,000 to-morrow over the Marietta road; but yesterday it was reported that even a ferry-boat could not cross there. I have also just received dispatch from the agent of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad at Parkersburg as follows: "Navigation suspended at this point. Prospects are that it will continue for three or four days. " I think the safest way is to send 5,000 or 6,000 to-day and to-morrow to Wheeling and the balance up the river, if to-morrow it appears safe to do so.

Colonel and Chief of Rail and River Transportation.
