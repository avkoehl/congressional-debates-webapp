WHITE HOUSE, June 20, 1864.

(Received 8.30 p. m.)

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Chief of Staff:

We were attacked this morning about 7.30 by rebel cavalry and artillery; the firing still continues. I think we shell be able to hold our position until General Sheridan arrives who is somewhere between Durking and the White House. I have crossed the supply train to the north side of the river to avoid the enemy's shells, which have been filling in the midst of it. The firing has abated and distant artillery can be heard about us on the river. I will hold this place to the last.

J. J. ABERCROMBIE,

Brigadier-General.

Brigadier General S. WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Army of the Potomac:

This place was attacked at 7 a. m. this day by Hampton's division of cavalry and artillery. So far I have foiled all their attempts to get into the depot. About one hour ago one of their caissons exploded. There has been no firing from them since. The head of General Sheridan's column is in sight. But 2 or 3 wounded in my command. General Getty has just arrived.

J. J. ABERCROMBIE,

Brigadier-General.

CITY POINT, VA., June 20, 1864-6 p. m.

General ABERCROMBIE,

White House:

Your dispatch of 10.20 a. m. received. Hold out at all hazards. Two gun-boats were sent from here yesterday, and must now be at White House. General Sheridan is also near you, if not yet arrived.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

It will be impossible to communicate with Major-General Sheridan on this side. General Sheridan crossed at Dunkirk last night or this morning on his way to the White House. If you can, hold the enemy in check until General Sheridan gets up in the enemy's rear. General Sheridan has enough force to whip any force Hampton has.

P. HUEY,

Colonel, Commanding.
