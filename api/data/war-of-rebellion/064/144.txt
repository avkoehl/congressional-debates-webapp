most abundant. White River low at Batesville. Along the road Major Childress saw quite a number that were wounded at Dardanelle. I will go on to Sugar Loaf this evening. Forage scarce and cannot well stay over one night at a place on that account.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Major-General ROSECRANS,

Information from Fort Scott informs me that 12 bushwhackers under Henry Taylor entered Lamar, Mo., on yesterday [28th*] and burned ten houses. There were only women and children in the place, the militia having left some days since.

HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF WEST MISSISSIPPI,Vicksburg, Miss., May 31, 1864

Brigadier General ROBERT ALLEN,

Chief Quartermaster, &amp;c., Louisville, Ky.:

The loss at New Orleans by fire of several steamers that were considered available for our purposes will make it necessary to increase the number of transports sent from above.

Before leaving Natchez Captain Klinck was instructed to advise of the number that would be necessary for special purposes at New Orleans, Vicksburg, and Memphis, and the equivalent for the boats destroyed, or transportation for about 4,000 men, should be sent in addition to his estimates.

ED. R. S. CANBY,

Major-General, Commanding.

CAPE GIRARDEAU, May 31, 1864.

General EWING,

Commanding:

Our boys killed 2 of the guerrillas who cut the telegraph line Thursday. On their return they got after another and he took to the swamp. Our boys dismounted and, after a chase of some distance through about 3 feet of water, killed him. I start a party to-morrow to kill the balance.

J. B. ROGERS,

Colonel, Commanding.
