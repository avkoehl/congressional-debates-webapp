The hands he wishes turned over to Mr. John Cheves, in charge of the work.

I am, &amp;c.,

J. R. WADDY,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

CHARLESTON, S. C., June 5, 1862.

General N. G. EVANS, Adams Run, S. C.:

Send me a cavalry company to report to General S. R. Gist, on James Island; one well armed if possible.

J. C. PEMBERTON,

Major-General, Commanding.

RICHMOND, VA., June 5, 1862.

Major-General PEMBERTON, Charleston, S. C.:

Did you receive my dispatch of last night?

JEFFERSON DAVIS.

CHARLESTON, S. C., June 5, 1862.

JEFF. DAVIS, President:

Received your dispatch of yesterday this morning. It may only be a feint, to prevent my sending troops to Richmond. If he does not increase his strength considerably I can resist him. No demonstrations at present against the harbor. He remains under cover of his gunboats on StoNumbers Four regiments will be ready to move at your call by night. Hope to be able to say, "Can send them."

J. C. PEMBERTON,

Major-General, Commanding.

RICHMOND, VA., June 5, 1862.

Major-General PEMBERTON, Charleston, S. C.:

When your condition permits send on the troops. The urgency increases. Order was sent yesterday to forward you from Danville some 32-pounders. Anything we can furnish you shall have. The forts, if well defended, will, I hope, protect the harbor.

JEFFERSON DAVIS.

CHARLESTON, S. C., June 5, 1862.

JEFFERSON DAVIS, President:

The urgency has not apparently increased here. I have ordered four regiments to proceed at once to Richmond, and will hasten them as much as possible.

J. C. PEMBERTON,

Major-General, Commanding.
