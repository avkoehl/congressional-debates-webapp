CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
U 
the most dangerous conflicts that has ever occurred
in ihe history of this Government—a conflict in
which, if the Bank prevails, it will triumph over
every ru'e of morals and every pnnrip * of trutT
and justice. If this case would s'op here, it
would be sufficiently dangerous but .is a prece-
dent for fmu'e action, it is ot most a'arming ím
port. We all know, said Mr W that not ma  /
yea's Mnce, it wu moved m this body t1 apply a
portion of the revenues oí this nation tc the eman
cipation of slaves in such < f the S a'es a^ would
not dissent. Now, mould ihat proposition into (he
form of this amendment, by decían g tint Congress
will emancipate the slaves w all the S ates, which do
not unconditionally assent or dissent, at the first ~-e<-
sion of their Legislature after the la* was parsed,
and what Southern State would so hum le ii">iself
as to acknowledge your power in any contingency
to emancipate, as to assent or dissent to sucha pro-
position? Yet if it dres neither, upon the principles
of this amendment, Congress may instantly abo-
lish slavery with n us limits.
Sir, can ihese branches, thus located in any State,
repose upjn the assent of a State wmch never has
betn or would be given' No, sir, they will have
stelen into the S ate under false and delusive pre-
texts, and corning there, not under the broad ban-
ner of the Constitution, nor upon an as ent of the
State given, but in factrefase! Your construc-
tive and presumed consent will be disproved, and
the branch will fall before the omnipotent power of
truth and justice. But there are insuperable ob-
jections to this amendment, m the fact that it pre-
sume the assent ot every State whose Legislature
shall not thus unconditionally absent or dissent at
the next session after the passage of this charter
Why. when th s charter shall have pas-
sed at this session, many of the States will
have elected their Legislatures, and th s
question cannot have be<.n maáe at the polls,
and the will of the people ot the State mus  be
unknowH to their íeprc^en'atives Again, in
many of the States, the State Senate is alreauy
chosen in whole or in part, and if the Siate S nate
do not dissent, although the Hou^e of Representa-
tives may have dissented, the State is concluded by
this bill and presumed to have assented In ?ll,
or neatly all, the Sta'es, the Senate is cnosen from
periods ranging i rom two to four years, an 1 in one
State for six years, and in that State toe whoie Se-
nate is already chosen, btit ihe lower H juse is yet
to be elected. Suppose the lower Hou e in that
State, chosen this fall, with this quest on before the
poople, shall, with great unanimity, dissent to the
locationof a branch within its limit"; but the Se
nate,all chosen long since by a small majon y, or
a tie vote, do not dissent. As a quest on of truth
and morals, the State has not assented, and
yet under this amendment she w¿U be taken
«tnd regarded as having assented To pre-
sume an assent, under these and similar
circumstances, gairst the fick and truth
of the ca«e, would be a fraud upon the
people of a S'ate, it would be a jugsle, a
miserable juggle, at which tho e who placed this
part might smile in triumph here, or within the
parlor of the Bank, but the people would mourn
o/er the degeneracy o toe times, which cruld have
sanctioned such a proposition Mr W said, he
hoped now ihai the true character of thi  amend-
ment was laid bare, that lhere "iuld be vir'ue and
firmness enough yet left in ¡his or in the other
Hou e to reject this proposition, but choull it be
otherwise, he trusted that Providence wou d nerve
the heart of an honest man, and thus far a fe=r
less and cnsistent patriot elsewhere, to stamp this
bill wi h a veto, that will be as immortal as the
existence of the Constitution
Mr. PRESTON had desired from the beginning
to tee this question assume such a shape as would
unite the Whig party in its favor. He considered
the prelom nance of that party the paramount ob-
ject, ivhioh should not be risked for tr firs He
considered tie amendment as a concession by those
who claimed the power oí branching for the Federal
Government to those who denied that power, and
so far was a compromise
Mr. BUCHANAN said that he trusted we had
now reached the last scene of the fifth act of this
Nation?! Bank drama It was not hi wish to de-
lay the finil catis'rophe beyond thia alternoon, ¡>nd
he «hould therefore trouble the Senate with bul a
very feu remarks On  ?ct of juMic° he mu i
perform to the S rator irom Virgin a [Mr. Rives,]
witho it knowing whe'her it would me<.t his appro
ballon He must say of that Senator that through
out thi dra a he had sustained his character with
firmnes , abihtv, consistency, and oigniiy. He
had t.'ken his ground manfully in the be innms,
ami had maintained it until the end And what
was th  compromise which the Senttor from Ken
tacky [Mr. Clay] had, at this last hour, oflf red to
the Senator fiom Virg ma, fo' ihe purpt se of satis-
fying Hie consciences of high-torn d Sute Rights
men? Toe S nitor f*om Viiginia, when hi? offered
hi amen ment req tiring the assent of the S atf- to
thee tibhshment of branches within their 'ímits,
I ad distinctly declared th?t wit! out this a>-s<>nt
Oongre s, in his op nion, h?d no power nnrW the
Constitution to establish suc« branches There he
s'ood- and it was impossible for him to yield
to any compromise, inconsistent with his de-
clare! constitutional convictions Under these
circumstances, what had we witnessed' The
Senator from Kentucky had off-red an amendment
pro-idmg, not for this a-rent of the States, but that
they misht dissent, if they thought proper, fiom the
etfab'ishment of branches wnhin their limits; and
in that --vpnt, no brpnt-h should be established. The
S natf r limits the power of dissent t > the close of
tne first session of the re pecfive Legis'amres aftei
the passage of the present bill, and in case th s H, -
sent shall not b- declar d within that peiiod by
some act of tie legislative power, the bunch 1-.

charter shall endure This was a most smsulpr
mode of bringing the Slate Rights portion of ihe
Whig party into the suuporf of the bill What
was the plain English of this prov s or' Tne^e
nine directors rf the Fue 1 Bank, stit oned at
Washington, will have the power of issuing a sum-
mons to e<>ch of the -overeigi S ates of this Union,
warning them that if they d > not apppir and p'ead
against it wnhin sixty or ninety ('ays, a branch
bank shall be e tabhshed within their lim ts. If
they fa I to appear, judgment shall fh°n be entered
by defaul m the high court of bank dir ctors,
aeains'these sovcreigi States. Thí tule of law,
he believed, was that judgment coald not be ob-
tained by defau't upon a scire Jacias in in Jividu-1
cases, without a previous return of "two nihils "
but, according <o the amendment of the Sena'or
from Kentucky, it might be en'ered against one
of the States of the Union, in <hr court of
the Bank direc'ort after a return of a single

if they fail to answer at all, by this omi sion, they
surrender the sovereign power of legisl non in re-
gard to the admission of a bnnch bank within
their limits To speak senou ly uponth.s subject,

The Senator from South Carolina [Mr Preston]
had informed us that "the States m ght be ndei
stood to exprés  ascert by the non-user of the
power of diesen1 " But this would b- an m er-
ence direct'y at w?r wiih the tac , becaus  an ac-
cidental Bank majority in one branch oF the Le-
gislature of any33'a,e> conld prevent the pissage
of any act declaring such dissent, and ihus eviabli'li
a branch within its limits against the will of the
other branch of the Legislature, the Executive and
the people Indeed from the nature of the Sena-
tor's amendment, it might appear to those not ac-
quainted with his frank and manly character, that
n was all a tnck; an assumption of ihe appearance
of yielding something, when it, in fact, yielded no-
thing
It was of vital importance to the interests of the
Bank that it should have branches in New York
and Philadelphia New York was the great cen-
tre of tbeommercml business, and of the foreign
and domestic exchanges of ihe country; and it was
indispensable that the Bank should establish a
b anch in that city, and Pmladelphia was scarcely
second to it in importance The «Senator conld
without difficulty ebtain branches in those cities
under hw rule that the omi«sion to dissent should
be onstrued into an assent. The Senate of Penn-
sylvania had been suddenly transformed at the time
the late Bank of the United S ates obtained its
Statechartei, ¿nd its feelings of extreme hostility
■sere changed into devoted friendship to that insti-
tution Tnere was something miraculous in the
illumination and conversion of seven of the Demo-
cratic anti Bank Senators of that body. The
Democrats had never since been able to obtain an
efficient majority in the Senate, andprobably might
not until after the next session of the Legislature.
Now, according to the principle of the Senator's
amendment, ihe Governor, and a large majority of
the House of Representatives, and the people,
might all be, as he sincerely believed they would
be, opposed to the establishment of a branch at
Pmladelphia; and yet the branch must be established,
because the Si nate alone could prevnt any legis-
lan ve act from being paused on the subject. He
undcttood that New York would, in all human
p-obabihty, be placed in a similar position Such,
then, would re the operation of the rule that absent
was lo be inferred from "the non user of the power
of dissent"
He had voted against t^e amendment of the
Senator from Virginia, requiring the assent
of the States to the establ shment oí branches
within their limits, and he «hould vote against
the amendment of the Senator from Ken-
tucky, because he deemed it still more objec-
tionable. And why had he vo'ed against the
amendment of the Senator from Virginia? Be-
cause he believed it to be equally unconstitutional
with the orinal bill, and that it would prove even
more mjurinu , if possib'e, to to the interests of the
country Had this amendment prevailed, it would
have carried the bank war into the Legislature of
every State of the Un'on. The struggle in many
Statej would have b°en tremendous, and bank
loans and bank facilities and bank accom-
modations would have been fully used to
obtain this assent The members would have
been exposed to severe temptations, and the
virtue of ¡orne might have fallen in the conflict. It
wa- to avoid the disgraceful and demoralizing
senes referreJ to by the Senator from Rhode isl-
and [Mr Simmons] ihat Mr B had vo'ed against
the pnieud-nent of the Senior from Virginia re-
qu rim; the ¿ss-nt of he Sta'es to the establishment
of br^Dcoes He rever should give a vote, the di-
rect consequence of which wouli be to bring the
money power to bear direc 1> upon the legislative
power of all the States in this Union.
But it the amendment oí the? Senator from Vir-
ginia had been bad, that of the Senator from Ken-
tucky was =til" worse, and, upon his own avowed
principle', he did not perceive how the Senator
f o a Rhode Island [Mr. Simmohs] could give it
bis support Under the amendment cf the Senator
irom Kentucky, the task of the moneyed power
would be rendered much easier, and its success
mi eh moie certain If the nine directors here
could obtain the favor either of the Governor, or
the Senate, or the House of Representatives, this
wouid be sufficient to prevent the legislative expres-
sion of diss nt, and thus the branch would be esta-
bh-hed The voice of the people was to be entire
ly di regarded Either branch of the Legislature
or the Governor would be sufficient This amend-
ment, by reducing the number of individuals on
whom the moneyed influence was to opera'e, would
enable it to operate with the more intensity and
power on these individuals.
