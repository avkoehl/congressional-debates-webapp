Major-General HUMPHREYS:

Some advance was made last night by the regular engineers in front of my left division, occupying ground hitherto held by rebel sharpshooters. On other portions nothing was done, except to connect and perfect the advanced works previously opened, and to establish additional batteries. No change can be discovered in strength or position of enemy, who has, however, worked industriously in strengthening his works.
