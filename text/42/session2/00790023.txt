42d Cong.... 2d Sess.
Disposition of Publie Lands—Mr. Dunnett.
Ho. of Reps:
gan, 20 in Wisconsin, none in Missouri, none
in Iowa, and none in Minnesota. In 1860
there were 6,946 miles of railroad, and even
at that time there were none in Minnesota.
In 1870 there were 13,741 miles. At the pres-
ent time there are not less than 15,000 miles
of railroad in those six States. In my own
State there are at the present time 1,550
miles, while it is shown by this table that in
1870 we had but 1,072 miles.
Therefore, along with the increase I have
shown in population, there has been this in-
crease in railroad construction in those^ States.
I might, however, have referred to this table
first, and shown what was the railroad con-
struction in these States in those years, and
then have shown as an inevitable consequence
this increase of population daring the same
time. I now present the following table show-
ing the true value of the property in 1850, in
I860, and in 1870, in these six States:

Total 55,774,673,262 $2,309,654,522 $510,774,614
Examine this table ;uid you will find that the
property in these States increased there just
in proportion as you furnished them with the
means of internal development, and in those
States in which had not then been inaugu-
rated this policy,you will find a far less increase.
But between I860 aud 1870, you, see this won-
derful growth—the population of those six
States going1 forward from five to eight millions
of people, and their railroad mileage advan-
cing from 5,000 miles to 13,000 miles. The
taxable properly advanced from $2,809,*
654,522 to $5,774,673,262.
These railroads have thus developed the
country an d added to it immense wealth, which
was drawn upon during the war and is now
drawn upon. And we have done all this by a
liberal policy in laying these lands open and
giving the means of communication to them.
Here, then, is vast wealth in those roads. Who
can tell their mission? It has but just begun.
Our wealth is yet largely in our soil in those
six States. We could raise twenty-five million
bushels of wheat in Minnesota when we had
but two acres to the hundred under the plow,
and we have the capacity Of raising three
hundred million bushels. Over these roads
this vast amount of wheat shall tend eastward,
and it will make but a part of the commerce
of that State. .
Are these roads, then, in no way tributary to
the wealth and power of the country, simply
because they find their field of exercise in
Minnesota? By no manner of means. What
have these roads cost? They have costavaBt
sum of money. The gentleman from Oregon
[Mr. Si.ater] spoke upon this subject one
Week ago in this House, with ability and with
force, using arguments in my judgment wholly
unanswerable, aud furnished to the House sta-
tistics which I have not the privilege myself
of presenting here to-day. I have desired
father to combat the localization of this ques-
tion ; I have desired rather to nationalize it.
While glorying in the growth of my State, I
glory in it only as it is an integral part of the
whole. These railroads have'eost on an aver-
age $30,000 per mile, wheti all equipped and
r'eady for sfervice. Multiplying the number ot
milfes constructed, 13.741, by $30,000, wehave
$412,230,000 of railroad property m those six
States, and all in consequence Of the liberal
policy of this Government. This vast wealth
iS productive, not dead wealth, bat having the
powct of carrying "on in and through these
States a commerce which has been ot immense
Value to the Government, to the Bast, and
indeed to all sections of the country.
Here is this vast capital. What has been
done with the money used in constructing
these roads? The larger part of it has been
used along their line. This expenditure of
money has not only put into existence this
vast carrying power, but while it has been
doing that it has been aiding in the settlement
of these States. It has aided men upon their
farms. The ties were bought with a portion
of this money. The road was graded with a
portion of this money. The fences have been
built with a portion of this money. Mechanics
and laborers have been employed, and half of
this vast sum expended in those States has
been' caught up by these pioneers, by these
actual settlers, and we have thriving cities
and villages, and well built houses all through
those States because of the munificence which
flowed out of these very aided corporations
against which so much may be said in one Hue
of argument, but not when you look upon
them as the source of internal development.
Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from Oregon,
[Mr. Slater,] to whom I have referred, in
his speech states that statisticians give it that
the building of a mile of railroad adds to the
property of the country through which it
passes five times the cost of the road. I doubt
not the correctness of these statistics. I have
consulted other authorities and they confirm
it, and even go beyond it. We have now rail-
roads that have cost $412,230,000 iu those
six States, mostly built since I860. If it be
true that there have been added five times
that amount to the taxable property of those
States, then we have the enormous sum of
$2,473,850,000 as the increased taxable prop
erty of those States, the result of this railroad
construction.
I doubt whether it is in the power of any
man, no matter how industrious he may be, to
gather up statistics in any section of the country
so' conclusive, so unanswerable, so stern. W e
have undoubtedly unused lands or unappro-
priated grants in these States sufficient to make
the number of miles not less than twenty
thousand. According to the figures which I
have already given, the construction of those
twenty thousand miles will cost ^000,000,000,
and it will add to the taxable property of the
country $3,000,000,000.
The following table will show how many
acres of laud have been granted to these States
for railroad purposes, and just what the Gov-
ernment has done to bring about the magnifi-
cent results stated above:

sale of public lands during this period of rail-
road construction, and if you will carefully
read the table which I shall present herewith,
the totals only of which I shall now give, you
will see that the sales of the public lands has
kept pace with the use of these granted lands
in the construction of railroads. The year
1868 was the great year for railroad building,
and in that year over five million dollars' worth
of public lands were sold-, and those lands
were sold along the lines of these projected
roads. Just where the Government had given
but, a fraction of its domain it was reaping a
rich reward; it was selling its lands. Let
us see how much the Government has sold
during this same period and during a much
less period. During the years 1865, 1866,
1867, 1868, 18B9, 1870, 1871, the Government
sold 9,066,110 acres of public lands. The
total receipts from those sales amounted to
$13,235,741 04.
The following table gives the exact data:
Years. Acres sold. Total receipts.
1865   457.202 $718,426 35

It has donated, as will be seen, in all the
grants in these six States, 30,482,374 acres of
land. These thirty million acres have been
given by the Government as an incentive, as
a stimulant to enterprises that have resulted
and will result in the construction of twenty
thousand miles of railroad, adding to the tax-
able property of the country $3,000,000,000.
What has the Government done? It has
simply said that the States might use these
thirty million acres to brmg about this large
result. When it did this the Government it
it had prescience, foresaw at once that by the
donation of this much of its publie domain it
would open up the vast ungranted tracts to
actual settlers, would promote an increased
sale of its ungranted lands, would really be-
come in fact a successful speculator by these
very grants of public lands.
Now, Mr. Speaker, there has been a
Total 
. ..9,066,110 &13,235,741 04
111 1869 the Government sold over four mil-
lion dollars' worth of public lands. Look at
the table showing the number of acres sold,
and you will see that the Government sold that
land very largely, almost exclusively at $2 50
per acre. The receipts were doubled that year,
and $13,000,000 worth, I repeat, were sold
during the period to which I have referred.
I call attention to this, because I think some-
times it is forgotten how much the Government
does receive as the result of this policy, and
we must remember that it has sold but the
merest fraction in those very regions where it
has been selling lands for these six or seven
years past, and where these lauds are now be-
ing made worth $2 50 an acre, and where set-
tlers desire them at that price, because they
are within the reach of some railroad.
I do not desire to make comparisons except
for purposes of illustration; I myself went into
the West from New England, and am now thor-
oughly in love with the West, yet not necessa-
rily disregardful of the East. But I desire to
make a comparison between the growth of
these six States in the West during this same
period of time, with the growth of the six
States of New England. In 1850 the six New
England States had a population in round
numbers of 2,800,000, but 400,000 more pop-
ulation than these six western States had m
1850. In 1860 New England had a population
of 3,100,000, having increased but 300,000
since 1850, while these six western States
had increased from 2,400,000 to 5,200,000.
In 1870 the population of New England was
3,400,000, while the population of these six
western States was 8,100,000. _

To my mind these facts demonstrate the wis-
dom of the policy that has been pursued; to
mv mind they establish the fact that this policy
wis wise in its inauguration, and that .tought
to be kept up in the future, with tlie modifica-
tions which do, in fact, begin a new P°"cy-
