New Orleans, La., December 28, 1864.
General G. M. DODGE,

Commanding Department of the Missouri:

GENERAL: Your communication of the 11th instant has been received. As the heads of the families referred to are in great part serving in Price's army, and Little Rock is designated as the point to which their families should be sent, Major-General Reynolds will be instructed to receive them on their arrival at that place, and to pass them through our lines in the direction of Camden. If any families should be found who should properly be sent east of the Mississippi they will be sent to memphis, and General Dana will be instructed to make a proper disposition of them. Before leaving this city for his command General Reynolds was instructed to make a fair application of the second section of the act of Congress, approved July 2, 1864, to the property of the class of persons referred to in your letter. The same rule cannot be applied in your department for the reason that Missouri has not been declared in a state of insurrection; but some of the provisions of the law of July 17, 1864, and March 12, 1863, may no doubt be applied beneficially.

Very respectfully, sir, your obedient servant,

E. R. S. CANBY,

Major-General, Commanding.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF WEST MISSISSIPPI,New Orleans, La., December 28, 1864.

Lieutenant General S. B. BUCKNER, C. S. Army,

Alexandria, La.:

SIR: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your communication of October 26, transmitting the complaint of Mr. Lovelace of the conduct of U. s. troops while engaged in military operations in the District of Natchez. The answer to your communication has been delayed by the necessity of referring the statement of Mr. Lovelace to several subordinate commanders for investigation and report. The reports are now before me, and I find that the statements are untrue in many respects and exaggerated in all; that so far from being entitled to respect as a non-combatant, he has been an active principal and abettor in the murders and robberies committed upon Union people and Union plantations on the banks of the Mississippi. His reputation is that of a notorious bushwhackers or jayhawker, properly an outlaw to both armies, and not worthy of respect or protection from either. I will not sanction, and will not permit with impunity that any of the unnecessary evils of war should fall upon the unoffending inhabitants of the country, but people of Mr. Lovelace's character should understand that the calamities which they bring upon others may possibly be reflected upon themselves.

Very respectfully, sir, your obedient servant,

E. R. S. CANBY,

Major-General, Commanding.
