ury for the removal of the public depositee from
the Bank of the United States are insufficient, and
that it is inexpedient to enact a law requmng the
Secretary of the Treasury to deposite the public
moneys 'n the State banks "
Mi CLAY rose and said, that as the House
had, by their recent votes, expressed their decided
opinion on the subject involved in the original
resolution, as well as upon the amendment now
proposed, it was surely unnecessary to revive a
second discussion upon these subjects He de-
sired to have the attention of th^ House duected to
the vast accumulation c f other business yet to be
disposed of, for which purpose, and with the per-
fect assert of hm colleague, he now moved that the
resolution belaid on tne table
Mr VINTON demanded the yeas and nays on
this motion, which were ordered
Mr McKENNAN said he must appeal to the
couitesy of the honorable member from Alabama
to withdraw his motion, in order to give those
members who were successively cut off by /he
motions for the previous question, an opportunity
of expressing their sentiments
Mr CLAY, howevei unwilling to refuse such
a request, felt compelled, under the circumstances
which he had stated, to decline withdiawmg his
motion
Mr  CARR moved for a call of the House
Mr WILLIAMS demanded the yeas and nays
on the call    OidereJ
The House having directed thecal!, yeas 152,
nays 11—alter some time ¡>pent theiem—
Mi WHITTLESEY, of Orno, renaiked that
as the hour (twelve o'clock) had arrived at which
private bill business should commence on this
day, by the rule, furthei p>oceedmgs> on the call
would not be of any service to the motion pend
ing
The proceedings under the case were then sus
ended     So the question on the resolution of Mi
*rdis stands ovei
The House having resolved itself into Commit-
tee of the Whole (Mr Clay in the chair) on the
bill to piovide for the payment ot claims tor prop
erty lost, captured, or destroyed, by the enemy,
while in the military service ot the United States,
during the late war with Great Britain, and the
Indian wars subsequent thereto, and foi other
pui poses,
Mr HARDIN pronosed an amendment to the
ninth section of said bill, which section was as
follows
" That any person who, in the time aforesaid,
has sustained damage by the destiuction of his or
her house or building by the enemy, while the
¡same was occupied as a military or naval depos-
ite, or for ban ai ka, under the luthonty of an offi
cei oi aj,ent of the United States, shtdl be allowed
and pud the amount of such damage Piomded,
That it shall appear that such occupation was the
cause of its destruction "
Mr HARDIN proposed so to amend the ninth
section, as to have it read, "occupied as a place of
deposite for military stores belonging to the United
States, or as barracks for sold ieis, by Older of an
officei of the United folates Army " The amend-
ment was agreed to by the committee
Mr WARD, of New York, then proposed, by
way of an intendment, a provision to extend the
benefits of the bill to tho e who had sustained
similar losses in the war of the Revolution
This wis resistid by Messis Will TI LESEY,
WILLIAMS, HARDIN, 1 ILL MORE STOD
DLRl,and PARKER, on vauous ground —that
the amendment could not with propriety be at-
tached to this bill, without fuithei veiy important
modifications In relation to the testimony which
bhjuld be leceivid by the A iditor in support of
said i evolutional y cltunib, that a measuie for the
liquidation and adjustment of this, description of
claims should come from the Committee on Itevo-
lutionaiy Claims, and contain ill Ae safeguards
which would lie necessaiy for the security of the
Government, that moie than I alf a century has
elapsed since these claims originated, and that,
without the most piecautionary m-aoures, the
adoption of tne amendment might produce gieat
imposition and fraud, that by tne resolution of
the ola Congi ess, thit, class ot claims was rejecte 3,
and that, with the exception of a single case, Con-
giess had  not assumed, by its U^ibUuon, the
adjustmentand payment of claimsfor losses,&c ,
incurred duung the war of the Revolution
The amendment was sustained by the mover,
Mr WARD, and Messrs EVERETT of Massa-
chusetts, and HUBBARD, of New Hampshire
It was urged that there was no good reason for
the distinction between claims growing out of the
last war and claims growing out of the Revolution
The war of the Revolution was prosecuted for the
benefit of the common country, that independence
was attained by the treasuie and by the power of
every member of the Confederacy, that services
were rendered for the whole country, that disa-
bilities were incurred in sustaining the common
cause of the Republic, and for these services and
for these disabilities Congress have made provis-
ion And that the principal reason why provision
has not been made for remuneiation for losses
then necessarily sustained, must have been owing
to the poverty of the National Treasury more than
to the resolution of the Continental Congress,
which has been referred to, that claims which
existed for losses during the Revolution are as just
and as honest as any claims foi losses during the
last war, and that no good reason exists why pro-
vision should not be made as well for the one as
for the other The length of time which has
elapsed should not operate to bar them
The amendment was, however, rejected by vote
of tne committee
Upon his presenting amendments to the tenth
section of a bill reported by the Committee on
Claims, to provide foi the payment of claims for
property lost, captured, or destroyed by the enemy
while in the military service of the United States,
duung the late war with Gieat Bntain, and the
Indian wars subsequent thereto, and for other pur-
poses, which tenth section of the bill, as reported
by the committee to the House, provides, "That
'any officei, field or staff, volunteer, ranger, cav-
' airy, or other peisons engaged in the campaign
'of eighteen hundred and eighteen against the
'Seminole Indians, or against any othei Indians
'in the time of war unce, who have sustained
' damage, without any fault or negligence on their
' part, respectively, by the loss of a horse, or neces
'sary equipage, in battle, or by the loss of a horse
' that was wounded in battle, and aftei wards died
'of said wound while in the service "
Mr CARR proposed to amend that part of the
tenth section above refrried to, and cause it to i ead
as follows "That any officer, field or staff, vol-
' unteer, íanger,cavalry, or othei peisons engaged
'in the campaign of eighteen hundred and eleve i,
'on the Wababh, against the Indians, oi against
'any other Indians in the time of war since, m-
' eluding the campaign of eighteen hundied and
' eighteen agunst the Seminole Indians, and also
' the six companies organized by virtue rf the act
'of Congress, approved thethuteenth of June, one
' thousand eight hundred and thirty two, for the
' protection of the northwestern fiontier, who have
' sustained damage, withoutany faultoi negligence
'on then part, respectively, by the loss of a horse
' or necessary equipage in battle, or by the loss of
' a horse that was wounded in battle and afterwards
'died of said wound while in the service, or was
'stolen by the Indians and not returned, or other-
' wise lost withou' any fault or negligerce on the
' part of the owner," should be paid for in pursu-
ance of the prowbions of the bill as reported by
the committee
Mi C said the íeasons which influenced him
to ask the adoption of th= amendment which he
pioposed were, that upon examining the bill he
had seen what he considered an omission in the
bi'l, in not piovidingfor the payment of pioperty l
lost by a very meutoi ous po-tion of our troops
who peiformed militaiy service previous to the
declaiation of the late vvai, during tne war, and
subsequent to the clo=e of the war with Gieat
Bniain
It should be recollected that the campaign on
the Wabash m the year 1S11 was performed pre
vious to the deUatation of the 'ate wu that the
amendment wHch he proposed provides for the
payment of property lobt by individuals on that
memoiable cairif uign, which has rot heretofoie
been provided for by law Mr C said ¡t was
true that a law had passed, he believed in the year
ltil-2, which provided for the prymert of horses
killed in the battle of Tippecunoe, in November,
1811, but did not, he believed, provide for the
payment of property lost by individuals at other
periods of that campaign, wh íe in tne service of
their country Mr C said that the act of Con-
gress approved the 9th of April, one thou and
eight hundred and sixteen, provided for the pay-
ment of property lost, captured, or destroyed by
the enemy while in the military seivice of the
United States, in the late war, did not provide for
the payment of property for which h is amendment
proposed to provide, nor did the act of Congiess,
appioved the thud of March, one thousand eight
hundred and seventeen That act provided for the
payment of any hor^e,mule,&c , lost while m the
military service of the United States, when it shall
appear that the loss was withoutany fault or neg-
ligence on the part of the owner, and extended to
cases of property lost in the wars with the Indian
tribes subsequent to the 18th Tebruaiy and prior
to the 1st of September, 1815
Mr C said he could not discover the reason
why those individuals who had sustained loss of
property in the campaign in the year 1811 upon
the Wabash, should not be as fully and amply
provided for as to their losses as those who had
sustained loss at any period dunng^he 'ate war,
and subsequent thereto He believed that the
services of those m the campaign of 1811 were as
essential, and their achievements as beneficial to
the security of the western frontier against a savage
foe, as were the services of any portion of the
troops in the late war He believed that then
seivices had been recognised by the Government,
that those who had received wounds in the battle
of Tippecanoe weie entitled to íeceive pensions in
propoi tion to their disabilites, and that the widows
and orphans of those who fell in the battle were
provided for in like manner with those who fell
in the battle during th- late war
Mi C said his amendment also provided for
the payment of losses sustained by sundry indi-
viduals whs h*d belonged to and performed ser-
vice in certain companies of mounted rangers,
which had been organized by laws of Congress,
passed during the war, and subsequent thereto, for
the piotection of the frontier He said that those
companies to which he alluded, who had done
sen ice in the late war, weie composed mostly of
citizens of the then Territories of Missouri, Illi-
nois, and Indiana, that those troops furnished their
own horses and subsistence for them, they also
furnished their own provisions, then own aims,
ammunition, and all necessary equipage, and that
these troops, for a term of two years, and some of
them a longer period of actiye service, undeiwent
many hardships and pnvations, weie exposed to
all Kinds of weather, swmrmng creeks and rivers,
encamping in the woods for days, weeks, ard
months, in bark camps, or under tents made of
blankets It was by the citizens of the thn and
scattered settlements of the Terntones of Mis-
souri, Illinois, and Indiana, and under cncum
stances hkei'nese,thata frontier of some hundreds
of miles in extent weie mainly guarded, protected,
and sustained, without whose exertions and vigi-
lance that vast frontier must have been la d waste,
and become a piey to savige violence
It was a poition of these tioops, with other
citizen volunteers of the then lerruones of Mis-
souri, Illinois, and Indiana, who defeated and dis-
persed the Indians on the Illinois liver in the late
wai It was the rangers of Missouri, 111 nois, and
Indiana, who reifoimed the task of haul ng, with
their own hands, some distance, every picket and
stick of timbor, out of which Foil Clark was built
on the Illinois river, at Pemia Lake Aftei this ser-
vice was perfoimed, a part of those rangers «ere
ordeied to ascend then er m keel boats, for the pur-
pose of destroying the Indian villages on the banks
of the liver Be,r>« thus separated from then
horses, which were lunmngat large, being some
hundreds of miles m the wilderness, where forage
could not be obtame 1, several of them wc.6 stolen
by the Indians or othei wise lost to their ovvn rs
On ti e return of those troops to then respec'ive
frontier tw^ of these companies were ordered to
pa«s thiough the wide mess, f'om rear Tort Claik
to V icennes, on the Wahash, thevleft Po-t Cla-k
with seven days' prows ons, ard arnved at Vm-
cannes on the seventeenth day after then departure
