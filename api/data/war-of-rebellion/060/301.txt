Numbers 4. Report of Lieutenant Lucien A. Butts, Eighty-fifth New York Infantry.

ANNAPOLIS, MD., April 5, 1865.

Brigadier General H. W. WESSELLS,

Washington, D. C.:

GENERAL: I inclose to you a report, made from such memoranda as i could make after I reached Macon, of the defense of the redoubt in which I was captured. I have not yet received the report from Lieutenant Clark I expected to send with this. I arrived here from Richmond the 27th ultimo, having escaped from Charlotte, N. C., and been recaptured at Fayetteville. I am awaiting an order for muster-out on account of expiration of my time of service, the order being very disagreeably delayed some days after the reception by Others of their applied for at the same time.

L. A. BUTTS,

First Lieutenant Eighty-fifth New York Volunteers.

C., preceding the surrender of that work, April 18, 1864, the command, by the mortal wounding of Captain Nelson Chapin, having fallen upon me as senior officer present.

The garrison of the redoubt consisted of 42 enlisted men of Company K, Eighty-fifth New York Volunteers, with its officers, Captain N. Chapin, Lieutenant L. A. Butts, and Second Lieutenant S. S. Peake, and 23 enlisted men of Company H. Second Massachusetts Heavy Artillery, commanded by Second Lieutenant H. L. Clark. Its armament was a light 32-pounder on a ship carriage, and an old-pattern iron 6-pounder field piece. Occasional shots were made from our guns as parties of the enemy made their appearance in the vicinity of the Washington road after our pickets were driven in on the evening of the 17th and the morning of the 18th. About 10 a. m. of the 18th three rifled guns opened fire from near the Fagan house upon our pickets near
