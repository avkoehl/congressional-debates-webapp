Salt Duties—Mr. Benton.

"They [the merchants] had even discharged,
'on purpose, many of their laborers, principally
' the most mutinous, under the pretext that com-
' raerce being ruined, (by the tyranny of the
'Spanish Government,) they ould no longer
' emplcy them, but in fact to the cTd that misery
'and famine might carry them moie easily to
'insurrection, assisting them from time to time to
'letain them in devotion to themselves "
This (continued Mr B ) is the tiue history of
our panics and home made distress, and wants
nothing but a change of names to be written of
the United States during the scenes of which the
Senator from Massachusetts has so unexpectedly
revived the memory For Lisbon, read any or
all of our large cities, for the year 1640, lead
1833-'34, for the Spanish Government, read Jaut
son's administration, and the history of oui own
great panic bloodless revolution is complete I he
body of the working people of Lisbon could not
be trusted with the secret of the conspu ucy, still it
was indispensable to have then services Staiva-
tion could drive*hem to revolt, by charging this
starvation to the tyranny of the Spaniaids, they
could be excited against the Spaniaids, and, by a
hypocritical distribution of alms to those whom
they had deprived of bread, they could make the
victims of their policy the instruments of their
conspiracy All this, even down to the crocodile
distubution of alms, was done in our own cities,
done against General Jackson, and to excite a de
ceived, outraged, and wronged population against
lum It was not quite so successful m our cities
as in Lisbon, but the virtue and molality of
the conduct was the same m both countries, and
history will record them in the same language
Yes, sir, history will record that the working
people, discharged from their employments during
our panics, under the pretext that commerce was
ruined, were, m fact, discharged from political
motives, and to make them instruments in a con-
spiracy against the Jackson administration, with
the secret of which they could not be ti usted
Sir. (said Mr 15 ,) these are disagreeable rem-
iniscences, but they are forced upon us, and when
forced upon us we must answei, ai d it must be
in the style which truth and justice demand*
Ttuth and justice, then, demands of me to denounce
the fictitious distresses which have been made in
this country during the admmistiation of Geneial
Jackson as sheer imposition, so far as the Hank of
the United States, and politicians were concerned,
and as ¡flieer delusion, so far as masses of the pe j-
ple were concerned They were as much imposi-
tion and delusion as the dischaige and insunec
tion of the workmen were in Lisbon in 1640 they
were as much imposition and delusion as the
famous witchcraft hallucination of Massachusetts
was in 1G90 The pretexts of the banks, mer-
chants, and politicians, for stopping business,dis
missing laborers, and making distress and panic,
were just as preposterous as weie the pretexts
of the bewitched imposters in New England one
hundred and fifty years ago Our panic and dis-
tress-makers of the nineteenth century attributed
the rum of all business to the removal of the de-
posits, and to the specie circular, the bewitched
subjects of 1090 attributed their calamity to the
looks of the witches, and, in both cases, one pre-
text was just as true as the other, and a trial in
one case would stand for a fac simile of a trial in
the other Here is a history of one of these ti mis,
had before the Honorable Thomas Danforth, Dep-
uty Governor of Massachusetts, at Salem, the
11th of April, 1692     It runs thus
" Deputy Governor —John, who hurt you '
" Jlnswei —Goody Cloy se hurt me
" Deputy Governor —How did she hurt you >
" Answer —She looked at me "
And thereupon (says the historian) Hutchin-
son, the aforesaid John, fell down, kicked,uttered
horrible cries, and began to vomit crooked pins
whereupon Goody Cloyse said to him, " Oh, thou i
art a grievous liar "   1 quote no more of the trial, I
(said Mr   B ,) but say that Goody Cloyse was
right m what she said to John, and is so admitted
to have been by all New England now, though !
disbelieved and punished at the time    Goody j
Cloyse was right; and a history of her trial, with a
I mere change of names, dates, and places, substi-
tuting President Jackson for Goody Cloyse, and
the Bank of the United States and its confederates
for John, will serve for the future history of the
I panic scenes of General Jackson's administration
1     Mi   President, 1 hope that this is the last time,
for trie present session at least, that any attack will
be made upon General Jackson on this fl >oi     He
has letired from public life, he is reposing under
his own une and fig tiee, he is now in no man's
way, he can be an object of feai to none, and
should not be an object of hate to any     He has
rendered service to his country, and certainly is
I entitled to peace m the closing moments of his life
' 1 do hope there will be no more attacks, 1 do hope
I theie will be a truce to this war upon aietired man
but if we are mistaken, if attacks must be contin-
| ued, gentlemen must rest assured that defeiue will
follow
I     I no wieturn to the appioprmte subject of debate,
and shall reply with all possible brevity and pre
usion to the aigumentuf the Senator fiom Massa-
chusetts, [Mi   Uavis]  That aigument íests upon
' twogiounds   1   Protection to the salt manufac
tuie, toi which puipose he moists the duly, if not
I laid, was at leist continued, 2  Em ourasjenient to
the fisheries as i nui sei v f< l seamen, for which pul-
póse, he contends the fishing homilies and allow
ames were giunted      1 deny both these positions,
and shall state mj leasons, in addition to the íea-
sods given  m my opemn= speech, for believing
them to be unfounded
1 Jli to the pioteclion to the srdt manujactme
The fiistanswei to thisaigument s, that the art
now in force for this salt duty, is tne act of 1813,
an act notoriously and piofessedly passed for
levenue alone, and that hmued to the wai with
Great Britain, and to one veat thereafter This,
extinguishes the idea of ¡ roteuion in the original
laying of the duty But the act was continued
after the wat' Ceitunly it was, and continued, with
all the lest of the wai duties, for the expiess pur-
pose of paying the wai debt' I he Senator fiom
Massachusetts [Mi Divib] sa^ s the at t was made
peipettinl 1 Ins is a great enoi The act was
continué i, geneially, as the oilier levuiue aits
weie, without saying f >r what tune, but foi the
known puipose of paying the wai debt, and as for
peipetuity, so tai horn I eing ¡ erpetim!, the one
half the duty was taken off ten yeais aTo, and the
lemaiiider is now in ai mise or ledu tion to a
point entnely and avowedly below the piotetnun
limit This is one answer to thit, atgnment
Another is, that the compromise act, as it is called,
provides foi the reduction of the saltduty to twenty
pei cent on the value 1 his explodes piotection,
bo that, so far as the argument is concerned, the
law has already passed which annuls it Prolec
tion to the salt manufacture has ilieady ceased by
law and the passage of the hill which I propose
to bung in, cannot annilnhte the protection to the
salt manufacture more effectually than now done
Then why continue this duty, leducedas it now
is to six cents per bushel, and as it soon will be to
twenty per cent on the value' Why continue it ?
As a protective duty it is nothing, for it will sink
below the protecting point As a revenue duty it
will be contemptible, for the revenue derived from
it will be too inconsiderable to menta thought Its
continuance will be nugatory for protection and
for revenue, and will only be effective foi oppres-
sion on the country—for fostering regrateis and
monopolizers—for creating an intermediate set of
salt dealers in the sea-port towns, standing between
the importer and the retailer—between the ship
which imports the salt and the steamboat, or
wagon, which carries it into the country, and
which intermediate set of dealers will monopolize
the article, double or quadruple the price, and
make common cause with the monopolizers in the
interior of the country in stinting the supply, in-
creasing the price, subjecting the country to their
impositions, and practicing all the arts for extort-
ing money by a monopoly of a necessaiy of life
with which the people have been so long ac-
quainted
Then why continue Jieduty' Andtheanswer
to this question brings us to the second argument
on which the Senator from Massachusetts relied,
namely, the allowances to the fishenes I say
these allowances rest on the saltduty, that they
are too large to be willingly parted with, that the
abolition of the duty is íesisted because it must
cany with it an abolition of these bounties and
allowances, he, on the contrary, mamta'ns that the
fishing allowances are for the encouragement and
rearing of mariners I come, then, to this second
point
II Encouragement to the fisheiies as a nursery for
seamen
I deny this position out and out, and without
going over the forty years' history of oui legisla-
tion on this sub]«ct, with which I occupied the
time of the Senate some days ago, I limit myself
to some piactical, and, 1 believe, pointed obseiva-
tions, glowing oufof that histoiy, and which will
fully show the fallacy of this pretension
1    The very fiist idea, Mr Pi esident, which
pi esents itself in a scheme for raising up mariners
for national purposes is, that the scheme must
embrace the features of fixed legislation and per-
manent duration Tnere must be a system of
legislation, and not occasional laws, theremnst be
a pei manency of continuance, and not limited and
contingent duiation Now, how stands these
fishing bounties, tried upon this test' Lost, over-
thi own, exploded by it1 All the acts which giant
them are of the limited, occasional, and contin-
gent km I The first one, of 1789, was to con-
tinue only seven yeais, it was to expne in June,
1796 I he second one continued them three years,
to wit until June, 1799 the third one continued
them ten years, to wit, until 1809, and that one
was not allowed to live its time out, it was repealed
in March, 1807 Some of these limited acts, Mi
Pi esident, weie enacted while the fi lends of a
navy were in power, when the elder Mr Adams
was Piesident, and when a naval force was the
policy of the Government, yet they made no at-
tempt to give pei manency or perpetuity to these
allowances, and the main act, that for continuing
them ten years, baiely got thiough the House of
Repiesentatives, with that House composed of a
large majority of Federal gentlemen devoted to
the creation of a navy and to the extension of our
eominene, rt passed by a majoiity of six votes,
wlm h wai only a difference of thiee men1 So
much foi tlie earlier acts rl he later ones, and
those now in force I hat of 181J was limited to
the wai, and to one yeai theieaftei, and dining
this time there was no way for our fisheries to go
oír except by the pel mission of the British the con-
tinuance of the act m 1816 was foi no fixed time,
and was known to befoi acomingand contingent
event, to wit  the payment of the war debt
2    lire next íemaik which I will make is, that
if encouiagement to seamen wastheob)eU in nm-
tuung these fisheries, then that blanch of this
business which did most to wai ds creating mar r iters
should have had the best pait of the allowance
This is clear reason, yet how stands the fact?
Why, the fact rs, that the great blanch of the
fisheiies get nothing, the smrll bi inch gets the
whole1 The five hundied ton whale ship, with
hei numeious ciew, doubling Cape Horn, sailing
twenty thousand miles befoie she leaches her field
of action, remaining out three yeais, and encoun-
teung the perils of a naval combat in hei conflict
with the mighty monsteis of the deep—this vast
and leal nursery of manners and combatants gets
nothing, while the five ton boat of the anglei, with
its hooks and lines and a few men, out three or
four months, and hugging the coasts, or getting
no fuither than the banks of Newfoundland, and
drawing up cod and mackerel, gets its full share
of the allowance This brings ridicule upon our
legislation, if the creation of mariners was the ob-
ject, but this is not the case, our legislation is not
udiculous, it is the aigument only of the Sen-
ator from Massachusetts which would make it
appear so
3    I merely name another omnipotent answer
heretofore given to this pretension, namely, that
by all the acts previous to the late war, the ex-
porters of beef and pork were put upon the same
footing with the fishing vessels and the fishermen,
so that, if mariners were to be nurtured among
the fishermen, they weie also to be nurtured
among graziers and herdsmen
4    1 baiely remind the Senate, Mi President,
that when the allowance was changed from the
exporter of the fish to the fishing vessel, it war
done at the request of the fishermen, as a better
means of securing the allowance to  him who
