Artillery Brigade, under orders of Captain Bridges, commanding. During the final movements for the possession of Atlanta the battery has been many times in position and has not come short of responding to every call. At this date the battery is in camp in good condition, and its commander would not fail to render to the God of Battles most earnest gratitude for the watchful care and tender mercies it has been His good pleasure to extend so freely toward us. Even through all this fierce and bloody strife and the great exposure to noonday heat and midnight damps we have to record the death of but two members of the company.

Recapitulation:* Killed, 2; wounded, 6; prisoners of war, 4; total, 12.

All of which is most respectfully submitted.

Your obedient servant,

LYMAN A. WHITE,

First Lieutenant, Commanding.

Report of Lieutenant George H. Briggs, Fifth Indiana Battery.
HDQRS. FIFTH BATTERY, INDIANA VOLUNTEERS,In the Field, near Rough and Ready, Ga.,

September 7, 1864.

LIEUTENANT: I have the honor to submit the following as a report of the part taken by this command in the campaign in Northern Georgia during the present summer:

The battery left Blue Springs, Tenn., near Cleveland, on or about the 3rd day of May last, marching with the First Division, Fourth Army Corps, to which it was attached. It took part in all the actions in which the First Division was engaged, being spiritedly engaged with the enemy at Tunnel Hill, Rocky Face Ridge, Dalton, Resaca, Kingston, Dallas, Pine Mountain, Kenesaw Mountain, Ruff's Station, Chattahoochee River, Peach Tree Creek, and Atlanta. In the movements around and south of Atlanta, by which the enemy was forced to evacuate the place, the battery was but little engaged, the section of 3-inch rifles, under command of Lieutenant J. F. Ellison, doing all the firing that was done. As I am only temporarily in command, in consequence of Captain Morrison being wounded, I am unable to make this report more explicit. The records of the battery show the number of rounds of ammunition fired and the casualties to be as follows:

Ammunition fired from light 12-pounder guns:

Shot.............................................. 1,291

Case-shot......................................... 1,594

Shell............................................. 477

Canister.......................................... 81
