captured, since he started last Wednesday, about 12,000 prisoners and 50 guns. He suggests that I shall go out and see him in the morning, which I think I will do. Tad and I are both well, and will be glad to see you and your party here at the time you name.

A. LINCOLN.

DABNEY'S MILL, April 2, 1865-6.40 a.m.

Colonel T. S. BOWERS,

City Point, Va.:

Both Wright and Parke got through the enemy's lines. The battle now rages furiously. Sheridan with his cavalry, the Fifth Corps, and Miles' division of the Second Corps, which was sent to him since I this morning, is now sweeping down from the west. All now looks highly favorable. Ord is engaged, but I have not yet heard the result in his front.

APRIL 2, 1865.

Colonel T. S. BOWERS,

City Point, Va.:

Instruct Benham to get the men at City Point out to the outer lines and have them ready. While all our forces are going in some enterprising rebels may possibly go through and down there in a fit of desperation to do what damage they can.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

GRANT'S HEADQUARTERS, April 2, 1865-8.25 a.m. [Received 8.45 a.m.]

Colonel BOWERS,

City Point, Va.:

Wright has gone through the enemy's line, and now has a regiment tearing up the track on the South Side road west of Petersburg. Humpphreys, with two divisions, is south of Hatcher's Run crossing the Boydton road. Sheridan with his cavalry, the Fifth Corps, and one division of the Second Corps, is moving from the west toward Petersburg. Ord has gone in with Wright. I do not see how the portion of the rebel army south where Wright broke through [Oak Grove] are to escape. Dispatch just received from Ord states that some of his troops have just captured the enemy's works south of* Hatcher's Run, north side, and are pushing on. This is bringing our troops rapidly to a focus with a portion of the rebels in the center.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
