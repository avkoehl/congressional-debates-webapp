1870.
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
not be represented by two Senators in this
Chamber, for instance, because that is a pre-
rogative which the Constitution vosts in every
politieai community which we declare in terms
to be a State. I suppose we could not say that
they should not be represented in the Electoral
College, because the Constitution says in terms
that every State shall be represented in that
college in a certain way. But within such lim-
itations as these it seems to me we may impose
any condition that we please. But suppose we
impose no conditions whatever, then what is
the condition of the State after you have once
agreed to admit it?
Upon my word, Mr. President, I have been
surprised to hear the question raised thisafter-
noon in this discussion, in the year of our
Lord 1870, whether Virginia had ever been out
of the Union or not. Territorially speak-
ing, I do not believe Virginia has ever been
out of the Union since she first came in.
Politically speaking, if she has not been out
of the Union she has been terribly abused.
Politically speaking, if Virginia has not been
out of the Union you have wrongfully and
illegally deprived "her of every prerogative
which the Constitution declares that a State
shall enjoy. I supposed she had been out of
the Union. I supposed she had ceased to be a
State within the meaning of that Constitution ;
not purely and merely by any act or fault of
her own, but by reason of an act which the
Congress of the United States passed, and
which they justified by the conduct of the
State of Virginia; in other words, that the
people of Virginia did those things, commit-
ted those crimes, so violated the Constitution
of the United States, so opposed themselves
to the authority of the Constitution of the
United States, that the Federal Legislature was
compelled, in the discharge of its duty to the
whole people of the United States, to take
from the people of that locality the preroga-
tives of a State.
It was, for all the world, as when in the
State of Wisconsin a man commits certain
crimes he is prosecuted for those crimes in tri-
bunals provided by the State of Wisconsin, and
if he is found guilty and the offenses are of
sufficient enormity he is taken right away from
the ballot-box, from his family, from all his
politieai privileges, and is shut up in the State
prison and may be kept there for life, and he
has not one of the prerogatives which the con-
stitution of Wisconsin gives to its citizens. The
constitution of Wisconsin says that if he is a
freeman and twenty-one years of age he may
vote, but he never thinks of pleading that con-
stitutional provision when the judge proposes
to shut him up in the State prison for life.
I know the Constitution of the United States
says that each State shall be entitled to two votes
in this body, and we have heard, from the be-
' ginning of the war down to this time, a great
deal about the rights of the States; there has
not been so much said about the duties of the
States. We found, by reading the Constitution,
that it imposed duties upon the States just as
' much as it did upon individuals, and wc found
: that certain States disregarded those duties,
every one of them, and trampled them under
f foot, and we had got to provide a remedy.
: We found in the Constitution authority ex-
' pressly delegated to the Congress of the United
! States to do everything that was necessary and
* proper to enforce every part of the public law.
• We could not think of any other way to bring
f those States back to their duty but these two :
first, to raise great, big, overwhelming, two-
story armies to crush out the military force
that they had raised in defense of their viola-
p tions of the Constitution. That was the first
t thing ; but we knew that, large as our armies
i were and well disciplined as they were, they
I could not shoot any statute off our books, and
f while that statute remained on our books which
i said that Virginia and Georgia were States, the
f Army could not interfere with them ; the Senate
# could not; the House of Representatives could
not; but that Congress, which put it there could,
we thought; and we thonght it was a proper ex-
ercise of the authority vested in us by the Con-
stitution in order to bring those States within
the control of the Federal Government and
see_ that the Constitution was enforced within
their respective limits. So we employed the
Army for the single purpose of crushing out the
military force there, and then we employed the
constitutional authority of Congress to revoke
the political power which we had placed in
their hands as States. I always supposed that
was the theory on which we acted. That was
the theory on which I acted, at all events.
How does that bear upon the question now
pending ? If we have that authority when a
State violates a plain injunction of the Consti-
tution and persists in it, and you have no other
remedy in the world and cannot contrive any
but this one of deposing its government, of
declaring a forfeiture of its State prerogatives ;
if we have that authority when we do not make
it a fundamental condition is there any objec-
tion in truth in the world to making it a funda-
mental condition, and giving notice when we
vote for their admission, "Yes, come in ; but
if you perpetrate a fraud in getting in and ex-
pose it afterward we claim the right to impose
this correction?" I do not see any objec-
tion in principle to doing that. I know, sir,
it is very unlike anything we have been in the
habit of doing heretofore, but we have been
obliged to do several novel things since 1861.
I do not believe that we have exercised any
authority over the prerogatives of those States
which raised the standard of rebellion that can-
not be justified by just as clear terms in the
Constitution as any power that the Congress
of the United States has ever exerted.
Mr. MORTON. Mr. President, the amend-
ment proposed by the Senator from Missouri
is a practical measure. It looks to the accom-
plishment of a particular and direct result in
which this whole country is deeply interested.
It is simply a measure to prevent the commis-
sion of a fraud. As the Senator from Wiscon-
sin has just said, a rescission of this ratification
would be a fraud. It would not be a proposi-
tion to chimgethe constitution of a State, where
public opinion finally works around to a par-
ticular result; but having just ratified, then to
turn around when they suppose they have the
power to rescind would be to commit a fraud.
It cannot be looked upon in any other light,
and it does not necessarily involve the question
of a fundamental condition. We have made
the ratification of the fifteenth amendment a con-
dition of reconstruction, and it is to preserve
that condition and to prevent the commission
of a fraud that this amendment is proposed ;
and it does not necessarily involve the doctrine
of a fundamental condition.
If this amendment is adopted we shall
never have to consider the question, either in
court or in Congress, as to whether New York
has the power to rescind her ratification. We
shall never have to consider it, for the reason
that there will be a complete ratification of the
fifteenth amendment without the vote of New
York. I believe that New York has no such
power. But, sir, that is the only one of all
the questions, in my judgment, that have ever
been raised against these amendments that is
even debatable. I have never heard a plaus-
ible argument made yet in regard to the ques-
tion of coercion ; I have never heard a plaus-
ible argument made yet as to the necessity of
every State being represented in Congress
when an amendment is proposed. The only
question that seems to me to be at all debat-
able is the question as to whether a State has
the right to rescind. I believe she has not;
but I do not want the fifteenth amendment to
hang on that question; and if we shall pre-
vent Virginia, by adopting this amendment,
from rescinding her ratification we shall never
be called upon to consider that question. " Ail
ounce of prevention is better than a pound of
I want to say one thing further to Senators
here this afternoon. There has been too much
haste, in my opinion, in disclaiming the power
of Congress over States that have been recon-
structed and readmitted. Sir, we do not know
what is before us in regard to these 'recon-
structed States. We shall probably have to
deal with some of them again and right soon.
Take the State of Tennessee, for example.
Only yesterday, I believe, the constitutional
convention assembled in that State refused to
take an oath to support the Constitution of the ■
United States.
Mr. DRAKE. And elected a confederate
officer as its president.
Mr. MORTON. Yes, sir; elected a rebel
general as its President. That, perhaps, was
not so material as the refusal of that conven-
tion to require its members to take an oath to
support the Constitution of the United States.
These and other things that have occurred in
the State of Tennessee show tons that we may
yet be compelled, a.y, sir, for our very life as
a nation, to deal with a reconstructed State.
I beg Senators not to be too hasty-in disclaim-
ing our power over a reconstructed State. As
I said this morning, if we have the power to
set up these governments we have the power
to protectthem. I warn Senators not now to fall
back from the legitimate and legal sequences
of their own doctrine. If the doctrine of
reconstruction is right, if we have authority
for what we have done, then we have a right
to protect what we have done; but if we have
no right to do that, and the reconstructed
States have a right to overturn it, then of
course it will be conceded that we have a right
to begin anew and set up -and build up again.
But, in the mean time, I insist that we havejust
as good a right to preserve as we have to con-
struct.
# Mr. President, I believe that Virginia has a
right to come in. I do not propose to delay
her one day. She has our word for it that she
shall come in on the performance of certain
conditions. This amendment will not delay
her. It is simply to prevent the commission
of a fraud. Sir, was not the action of Georgia
a fraud? And I ask you if the majority of the
men composing the Virginia Legislature are
not alike in feeling and sympathy and purpose
with the majority in the Georgia Legislature?
They are the same class of men. The Georgia
Legislature were mistaken. They thought they
had got beyond the power of Congress, and
they acted too hastily. As the Senator from
Missouri said, they had only got half way in
and we shut them out.
Now, sir, the Virginia Legislature have been
told to-day by Senators on this floor that when
their Senators are received here and the State
is completely admitted, according to the phrase
that is used, then our power over them ceases.
Understanding that, what will there be to pre-
vent them from rescinding that ratification in
ten days or ^ne week after their Senators shall
comehere? Would they like to do it? Would
it be in consonance with their feelings? Sir,
it would be in consonance with their feelings,
and we know it. Is there any Senator on this
floor bold enough to say he does not think so?
And would it not be in consonance with the
feelings of the whole Democratic party, North
and South, that they should do it?
Then, sir, if they have the power to do it and
if it is their wish and their feeling to do it would
it not be a measure of common prudence, such
as a man of ordinary sense would take in his
own business, now when we have the thing in
our hands to adopt a simple precautionary
measure, one that can do no harm but may do
much good? If we adopt this measure we
know that they will not do it, and the vote of
Virginia for the fifteenth amendment will never
be subject to any reasonable objection; for all
the otheif objections that have been made I
consider as nothing.
Now, I appeal to Republicans, I appeal to
those who not only desire the success of the
