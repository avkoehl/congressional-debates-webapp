HARPER'S FERRY, October 14, 1864.

(Received 8.40 p.m.)

Major-General HALLECK,

Chief of Staff:

The only telegram received from you was in regard to paymasters. I immediately communicated your order to General Seward, at Martinsburg.

Respectfully,

JNO. D. STEVENSON,

Brigadier-General.

POINT OF ROCKS, October 14, 1864.

General STEVENSON:

Two men have this moment come in from Adamstown. Rangers charged and drove enemy, who in turn charged and scattered our force. I have sent to have Grubb rally and keep his men together at all hazards. I have no horse, or I would go. First got through, but the second is just now back. There certainly are from 200 to 300.

BURTNETE.

POINT OF ROCKS, October 14, 1864-4.55 p.m.

Brigadier-General STEVENSON:

Captain Grubb, Loudoun Rangers, 100 men, sent back for re-enforcements. Reports 250 of the enemy's cavalry between Adamstown and Monocacy River, stealing horses. General Tyler, at Monrovia, has been informed; Government wires cut. I have directed Grubb to follow up and pitch into them at the first opportunity; at all events, to hold the enemy and annoy him until further developments. Will wait directions from you. Spence caught the operator, and he will keep him.

JOHN D. STEVENSON,

Brigadier-General.
