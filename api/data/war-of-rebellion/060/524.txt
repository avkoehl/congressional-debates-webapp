HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,February 6, 1864- 11. 45 p. m.

Major- General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

I have just come from the south side of the Rapidan, and have withdrawn all my force except about 150 men. I have seen General Segwick's note to you. General Hays was of the same opinion as General S. We have had about 200 men wounded, many of them seriously; but few were killed, but more will die from the ir wounds. The enemy show very large fires on both our right and left, but none n the center. Wounded have all been brought off and dead buried.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major- General.
