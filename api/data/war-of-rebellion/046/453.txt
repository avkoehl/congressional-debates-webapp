No. 26. Reports of Colonel Lawrence M. Keitt, Twentieth South Carolina Infantry, commanding on Morris Island, August 1-6, 15-21, and September 2-7.

SULLIVAN'S ISLAND,

July 11, 1863-9.10 p.m.

CAPTAIN: I have just returned from Morris Island. The enemy, I think, will use mortars, and there is no sufficient protection. I would suggest bomb-proofs, at once, and a few heavy guns on sea face to keep of wooden ships; light artillery on land face to repel assault. Heavy guns would probably be dismounted. A few mortars, large numbers of sand-bags, and some re-enforcements will make it safe.

Respectfully,

LAWRENCE M. KEITT,

Colonel, Commanding.

Captain W. F. NANCE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
