Numbers 99. Report of Captain Stephen H. Weed, Fifth U. S. Artillery, Chief of Artillery, of the battle of Bull Run.

I remained there doing effective service until forced to retire by a general advance of the enemy and a falling back of our troops. About 5.30 p. m. the battery took up a second position behind the house it had been in front of, and remained there engaged until nearly all the ammunition with the pieces was exhausted. The caissons were sent to the rear after the first position was abandoned.

The battery left its second position about 6.30 p. m. While moving offend under have fire two pieces broke down by the breaking right in two of their axles. Both these pieces were taken entirely of the field and beyond fire. It was afterward found necessary to abandon them on the road. The statements of the officers who had them in charge are appended. I also transmit reports of the officers in command of the other batteries of the division. My officers and men, with scarcely an exception, behaved remarkably well. I would especially mention Lieutenants Watson and McIntire, who exhibited much cool
