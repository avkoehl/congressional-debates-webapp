WAR DEPARTMENT, Washington, October 18, 1863-7 p. m .

Major-General MEADE:

Army of the Potomac:

The attack on Charlestown was not in great force. Enemy finally repulsed. General Sullivan has promised details, but none received. Lee is unquestionably bullying you. If you cannot ascertain his movements, I certainly cannot. If you pursue and fight him, I think you will find out where he is. I know of no other way.

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.

OCTOBER 18, 1863-8. 30 p. m. (Received 10 p. m.)

Major-General HALLECK:

Your telegram of 7 p. m. just received. If you have any orders to give me, I am prepared to receive and obey them, but I must insist on being spared the infliction of such truisms in the guise of opinions as you have recently honored me with, particularly as they were not asked for. I take this occasion to repeat what I have before stated, that if my course, based on my own judgment, does not meet with approval, I ought to be, and I desire to be, relieved from command.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General, Commanding.
