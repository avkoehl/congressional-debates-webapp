strong, is now between Tazewell Court-House and Wytheville. I have just received a telegram from General Lee, dated yesterday at Bunker Hill. He evidently thinks I am on my way from this place to Winchester, and yet I am remaining here by what I regard as your orders. I beg that you will relieve me from any doubt as to your orders, by a telegram this evening, otherwise I shall start tomorrow to join General Lee, and leave the command of this department to General Echols.

Please answer without delay.

General R. E. LEE,

Bunker Hill, via Winchester:

Another battery will follow him on Wednesday from Staunton. The enemy is this instant so pressing me in front that I cannot, under present orders, leave here without orders from the War Department. Please do not incorporate Colonel Wharton's command with any other brigade before I arrive. He is an admirable officer-has commanded a brigade for eighteen months. Let him command my troops until I come.

I leave to-morrow morning for Winchester, unless otherwise ordered. Come here immediately, and assume command of the department.

The enemy, 1, 300 strong, were this morning between Jeffersonville and Wytheville. I have given all orders I regard as necessary in the emergency.

I will leave a clerk here, who will tell you all that has been done, and show you all the papers.
