HEADQUARTERS TRANS-MISSISSIPPI DEPARTMENT,Shreveport, La., September 19, 1863.

Major General RICHARD TAYLOR:

GENERAL: I am in receipt of your communication of the 12th instant, in regard to the unparalleled number of desertions occurring among the Texas troops of your command, and in reply thereto am directed by the lieutenant-general commanding to say he sees no method of stopping this disgraceful abandonment of colors other than by the most summary punishment. He suggests, therefore, that a cavalry force be used by you for the apprehension and delivery of all deserters, and that their cases be disposed of as speedily as possible, the several sentences of courts-martial being executed at once.

With regard to the subject of pay, as referred to in your letter, the lieutenant-general commanding directs me to say that he has given instructions that all the troops belonging to this department should be paid alike, and if any deviation from this rule has been made, it has not been with his consent or knowledge or that of the disbursing officers of his headquarters. No one can be more solicitous than himself that the troops of his command should be paid promptly. A copy of the indorsement of the chief paymaster of the department on that portion of your letter in regard to pay is herewith inclosed.

I am, general, very respectfully, your most obedient servant,

S. S. ANDERSON,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

[Indorsement.]

Arrangements have been made for the payment of all the troops up to the last of August.
