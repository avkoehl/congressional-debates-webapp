It is essential solely that the service shall be performed and the officers shown to have rendered distinguished service.

First Lieutenant William S. Gogswell, Company I, fifth Regiment Connecticut Volunteers, and First Lieutenant Henry S. Taff, Company H, Fifteenth Regiment Massachusetts Volunteers, acting signal officers, having carried their flags in action at Port Royal Feerry, S. C., and in a manner to receive the official approbation and mention of the military and naval officers under whom they were serving, will hereafter bear upon their battle-flags a star having inscribed "Port Royal Ferry" in place of the block now borne. The name of the non-commissioned officer or private who acted as flagman during the action for which any flag is decorated will be reported to the Chief Signal Officer with a statement of the circumstances, in order that the name of the flagman may be laid before the commander in chief on the list of those who have rendered meritorious service.
