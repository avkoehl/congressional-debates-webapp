NASHVILLE, July 22, 1862.

Major-General BUELL:

My bridge force at Murfreesborough on yesterday p. m. expected to complete two burnt bridges by to-night. Wires cut; three bridges over Mill Creek, division house, wood house, and water station at Antioch, 9 miles from here destroyed yesterday p. m. by a band of cavalry. Shall I go on to rebuild those structures as soon as I can reach my men or take them to ---? After I get my forces to Mill Creek it will require eight days to rebuild the bridges.

J. B. ANDERSON.

NASHVILLE, July 22, 1862.

Major General D. C. BUELL:

I sent this morning a train for Reynolds'; it passed Franklin safely. The party that destroyed bridges on Chattanooga roads yesterday are reported as having remained at Antioch all night. I fear they will reach Tennessee and Alabama road to-day. I have instructed trains at Columbia to start up as soon as Duck River Bridge is made safe. Foreman says it will be completed soon, but if you so order at once I will detain the four trains at Columbia until we ascertain certainly that track this side is safe. Enemy is said to have reached Louisville and Nashville near the line.

J. B. ANDERSON.

There are 1,000 barrels of flour in the neighborhood of Manchester for sale; shall I purchase it? If it is not secured it may fall into the hands of the enemy. The owners are here waiting for an answer. General Smith requests me to make this inquiry.
