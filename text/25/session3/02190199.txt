HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Friday, Febív,my 22, 1839
The privileged question on the publication of
Mi Duncan,asstatedinyesterday's proceedings,
was again resumed
Mr PETRI KIN, who was entitled to the floor,
addressed the House as follows, m explanation
of the motives inducing him to make the motion
with which he concluded I rise, not to make a
speech, or to take sides in this war It matters
not what my individual opinions aie of members
of this House in their individual relations lam
bore not to gratify my own private pique against
others, or to gratify my own private feelings at
the expense of duty to my constituents and the
country generally I disclaim any intention
to express an opinion on the merits of the case
now before the House, but I must be allowed to
give my opinion of the scene enacted within this
Hall yesterday We were called upon to inquire
into the conduct of one of the membeis of this
House, on an alleged breach of privilege, for print-
ing and publishing an alleged libel on other mem
bers, and in discussing the propriety of passing
those resolutions, a scene has been enacted, in
my opinion, and I believe the country will con-
fíiuei it so, infinitely more a breach of the privi-
lege of the members of this House, than that al
leged to be perpetrated by the accused member,
even if that be as great an outrage as those com-
plaining of it allege We have, by law, but seven
days todo the business of the country—to furnish
the supplies for the necessary operations of Gov-
ernment, and shall we, regaidless of our duties,
spend that time in idle debate? I intended to
have made my remarks last evening but, on re-
flection, I thought there was too much excite
merit I hope all are cool now, and ready to do
their duty, and I therefore move to lay the whole
subject on the table
Mr P , however, withdrew the motion at the
lequestofMr Elmore
Mr THOMPSON sent to the table the follow-
ing substitute, which Mr Prentiss accepted as
a modification.
Whereas, Alexander Duncan, a member of this Hou**c
from the State ot Ohio, has, in his plane, aefcnowledged
himself to have written, and caused to be published in the
Globe newspaper, of the 19th instant, the following writing,
to wit
[FOR THE GLOBE ]
On the 16th and 17th January list, I made some remarks
in the House of Representatives on the resolution to ap
point a committee to inquire into the defalcations of bam
uel bwartwout, which remarks were soon after published
in the Globe and have since been published in pamphlet
iorm Mr ¡stanly, of North Carolina, followed me in re
ply At the commencement of his remarks, he insinuated
that I was a  Aboímoniat I promptly pronounced the m
sinuation a base falsehood and a foul detraction, whether
it dwelt upon the lips of the unprincipled calumniator, or
floated on the bree¿e in the corrupt, poisonous , and slan
derous Federal sheets of the day My intention at the time
was to insult the member So he understood me So all
who heard me understood me My meaning was that the
tnemher was a base liar and a foul calumniator, and the
oily leasoH that be was indirectly thus denounced, was
because the rules of the House prohibited me from doing U
directly, withoutlajirfgmyselfhable to its censure All this,
too was well understood at the time and for tins intended
and well understood msult, i held myself m readiness to
give tiie member any satisfaction which he might have the
moral courage to seek But no disposition to seek for re
dress was mamfi sted within the time I had anghuoexpect
it, or within the tunc it might be expected from a man w ho
bad any regaid for. Ins honor or reputation    So I was di 
posed to let the member go for, what X believe him to be, a
mean poltroon and a base liar, and which I believe he may
at any time, and in any place, be pronounced with nnpu
nity.
Some ten or twelve days after making the remarks to
nhich X allude, I saw a communication in the National
Intelligencer, occupying the space of four or five columns
of that paper, purporting to be ' the reply of Mr Stanly,
of North Carolina, to Dr Duncan " I was surprised to
see a reply of such length I was not present all the time
the member was speaking I was present, as I have stated,
when he commenced I was present when lit- finished,
and his last remark was, " I have detained the House not
more tlnn fifteen minutes " I thought he was correct as
to tht time he occupied the floor—{a short time in which
to make a «peech occupymgfour anda half columns of one
of the largest newspaper sheets )
Leave is sometimes asked of the House to write out a
speech which there may not be time to make, and the pnv
liege is generally granted This is an accommodation to
the House and to the country, whose business is permitted
to progress But, in all cases of this kind, leave of the
, House ought to be obtained, and a notice ot the fact ought
to accompany the written speech It i  mean and basely
dishonorable, and it is a falsehood and a fraud practiced
upon the community, to promulgate a speech purporting to
have been delivered on the floor of ( ongress which never
was there spoken, on any other conditions than by the leave
and with the notice which f have named
I say that the speech published m the National Intelh
geneer of the 4th instant, purporting to be " the remit 1« of
Mr Stanly m reply to Dr Duncan," never wis delivered
m the House of Representatives, nor an> other place, except
through the polluted columns of the corrupt bank bought,
servile, and degraded sheet through which it makes its ap
pearance , thett fore, its very caption ortitlecoritiinsabasp
falsehood,andamean attempt at fraud and imposition upon
the public     Its whole body is a tissue of misrep recenta
tions, unmanly insinuations, and low vulgarity, worthy of
the man that can be charged with ba^c falsehood and foul
detraction with impunity     in order to know that I could
not be mistaken as to the time the member occupied in his
attempt to reply to me, and to ascertain some other facts
of which I will soon *peak, I addressed the following notes
to the gentlemen whose names are prefixed, to which I re
ceived the subjoined answers
IIousf of Rlpresentativf-s   Fpfauarv 9  1839

Sir In replv to your note of the 9th instant, and the
questions therein contained, Í can only sav that Iwa«-pres
ent and heard the concluding part of your remarks on the
occasion alluded to, alter which, I saw Mr Stanly rise,
and heard his reply
I did not see Mr Slade hand Mr Stanly tht paper eon
tuning} our letter on the subject of abolition Mr Stabi
has informed me since, however that he did hand Mr
Stani y such a paper at the time alluded to by you
While Mr S was speaking, Í saw Mr Slade standing
by or behind Mr Stam y, pointing, as I thought, at difler
ent paragraphs m the paper held by Mr S As to the last
question, I think X heard Mr Stanly sayTh) concluding
his few remarks, that he had not addressed the House mora
than fifteen minutes, and I think that about the time he
did speak
With respect, I have the honor to be your obedient ser
vant,                                                            j A BYNUM

Hon  A Duncan
I think I im sustained in the fact which I have assertedj
viz tli it ' the «peech of Mr Staniy of North Carolina,
in reply to Dr Duncan," &c , never was made in the
Hou«e of Representatives, or if made, must have been
made in the short space of "fifteen minutes "y But even
all that time was not occupied in making the speech «ftr
i porting to be the iepl> to (i Dr Duncan ' When I charged
upon the member a base falsehood, &c   for making the in-
[ «muation which he did some part of the fifteen minutes
w is occupied in den> mg that he had insinuated that I was
an Abolitionist Here is where the member showed the
white feather    That denial was but a squirming from un-
1 der the ie«ponsibihtv of answering in an honorable way
the charge of being guilty of base falsehood A part of the
balance ot these precious fifteen minute*., (and a great part,
j too,) was occupied in reading garbled extracts from a letter
winch 1 wrote in uiswcr to some Abolition interrogatories
propounded to me shortly before my reelection Themem-
ber first rejjn tted that Ik had not the letter in his posses-
sion but it w is oou furnished Who furnished it' Mr
