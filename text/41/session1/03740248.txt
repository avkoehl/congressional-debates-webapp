land district in wyoming territory.
Mr. JULIAN. I ask unanimous consent
to report from the Committee on the Public
Lands the bill (H. R. No. 134) to establish a
land district in Wyoming Territory, and for
other purposes.
Mr. SCOFIELD. I reserve the right to
object after we have heard the bill read.
The SPEAKER The bill will be read,
after which there will be an opportunity to
object to its consideration.
The bill, which was read, provides in the
first section that the public lands of the United
States in the Territory of Wyoming shall con-
stitute a land district, to be called the district
of Wyoming, the office for which shall be
established at such place within the district as
the President of the United States may from
time to time direct; and the preemption laws
are to be extended to the Territory.
The second section authorizes the President
of the United States to appoint, by and with
the advice and consent of the Senate, a sur-
veyor general for Wyoming, who shall locate
his office at such place as the Secretary of the
Interior shall from time to time direct, and
whose duties, powers, obligations, responsi-
bilities. compensation, and allowances for
clerk hire, office rent, fuel, and incidental
expenses shall be the same as those of the
surveyor general of Colorado, under the direc-
tion of the Secretary of the Interior, and such
instructions as he may from time to time deem
advisable to give him.
The third section authorizes the President
to appoint, by and with the advice and consent
of the Senate, a register and receiver for the
district, who shall respectively be required to
reside at the site of the land office, and who
shall have the same powers, perform the same
duties, and receive the same compensation as
are now or may hereafter be prescribed by law
for other land offices of the United States.
Mr. FARNSWORTH. I object.
Mr. JULIAN. I ask the unanimous con-
sent of the House to occupy one minute in
making a statement to show why this bill ought
to be acted on now.
The SPEAKER. The Chair hears no
objection.
Mr. FARNSWORTH. I may ask consent
to make a short statement in reply.
Mr. JULIAN. Mr. Speaker, settlers are
pouring into this young Territory of Wyoming,
and are desirous to establish their homesteads
there. The Union Pacific railroad runsthrough
that Territory. It is utterly impossible with-
out surveys for the settlement and occupancy
of the public domain to go on. This is an
ordinary bill extending the surveys to accom-
modate the settlers who now, in the spring of
the year, desire to locate and settle on the
lands, and thereby contribute to the national
wealth. I hope there will be no objection to
the passage of this bill. It is simply ordinary
legislation in a case where it is needed.
Mr. FARNSWORTH. The reason why I
object is that this is multiplying offices where
they are unnecessary. Wyoming Territory is
made out of part of Dakota, and the land dis-
trict of the two is now no larger than it was
when it was all comprised in Dakota. There
is no difficulty in the world in putting Wyoming
under the same provision that applies to Da-
kota. We have the authority of the Commit-
tee on the Territories that there is very little
land that anybody would care to settle upon
in Wyoming, and therefore, seeing no necessity
for multiplying districts and officers, I object
to the passage of the bill.
The SPEAKER. Objection being made,
the bill is not before the House.
kigiits of actual settlers.
Mr. AXTELL, by unanimous consent, intro-
duced a bill (E. R. No. 252) amendatory of
an act to protect the rights of actual settlers
upon the public lands of the United States,
approved July 27, 1868, and for other pur-
poses ; which was read a first and second time,
and referred to the Committee on the Public
Lands.
minnesota state university.
Mr. WILSON, of Minnesota, by unanimous
consent, introduced a bill (H. R. No. 253)
authorizing the allowance of the claim of the
State of Minnesota to lands for the support
of a State university; which was read a first
and second time, and referred to the Commit-
tee on the Public Lands.
equalization of bounties.
Mr. NIBLACIC, by unanimous consent, in-
troduced a bill (H. R. No. 254) to equalize the
bounties of soldiers, sailors, and marines who
served in the late war for the Union ; which
was read a first and second time, referred to
the Committee on Military Affairs, and ordered
to be printed.
actual settlers in kansas.
Mr. CLARKE, by unanimous consent, intro-
duced a joint resolution (H. R. No. 47) to
enable actual settlers on certain lands within
the State of Kansas, known as the Cherokee
strip, to purchase said lands ; which was read a
first and second time, and referred to the Com-
mittee on the Public Lands.
sale o-path-o-la-ho-la.
Mr. CLARKE also, by unanimous consent,
introduced a bill (H. R. No. 255) for the relief
of Sale 0 path-o-la-ho la and her family, iieirs
of the late O-path-o-la-ho-la; which was read
a first and second time, and referred to the
Committee on Indian Affairs.
Mr. ALLISON moved to reconsider the votes
by which the several bills and resolutions were
referred: and also moved to lay the motion to
reconsider on the table.
The latter motion was agreed to.
equalization of bounties.
Mr. JULIAN. I would inquire of my col-
league if the bill he introduced in regard to
bounties provides for bounties in lands?
Mr. N1BLACK. It provides for scrip which
may be used in the location of land.
Mr. JULIAN. Iask its reference, then, to
the Committee on the Public Lands.
The SPEAKER. As a motion to recon-
sider the reference lias been made and laid on
the table, the reference cannot be changed
except by unanimous consent.
