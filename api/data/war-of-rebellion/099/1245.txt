WILMINGTON, February 21, 1865.

Brigadier General L. S. BARKER,

The enemy's force and positions are such on my arrival as to compel the evacuation of this place to-night. Continue to send trains.

WILMINGTON, February 21, 1865.

Major ROBERT STRANGE,

Fayetteville:

I find on arrival the enemy had driven us from west bank of Cape Fear. This uncovers the arsenal. Commanding officer should send off his most valuable stores, especially ammunition for small-arms. He should impress wagons and send to nearest railroad depot.
