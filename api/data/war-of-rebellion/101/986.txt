MORGANZA, February 26, 1865.

Major-General HERRON:

I received the order relieving General Ullmann and assigning Colonel Fuller. Colonel Fuller was on board of the Grey Eagle just ready to start down the river when I received the order. Colonel Fuller has assumed command. I think it is well, for General Ullmann is full of whisky all of the time-so much so to-night that he cannot walk steady.
