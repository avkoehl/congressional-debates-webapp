HEADQUARTERS TWENTIETH ARMY CORPS,September 2, 1863-11.30 a.m.

General R. W. JOHNSON:

General McCook wishes you to have the Thirty-ninth Indiana Volunteers reconnoiter and mark out or blaze a road from where you are to encamp to-night to Bridgeport, or gar enough to establish us a road there. It is understood that there is such a road there, but it is not sufficiently marked for travel without an examination and possibly some repairing. Corps headquarters will not get up on the mountain to-night.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. P. THRUSTON,

Assistant Adjutant-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS TWENTIETH ARMY CORPS,September 2, 1863-4.30 p.m.

Lieutenant CIST,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General:

Send following dispatch forward to General Johnson on top of the mountain, via pontoon bridge, immediately:

General JOHNSON:

By detachment of Thirty-ninth Indiana forward dispatch to General Davis to advance no farther than absolutely necessary to get water, and to be on his guard.

By order of General McCook:

G. P. THRUSTON,

Assistant Adjutant-General and Chief of Staff.

The above dispatch is sent to Lieutenant Cist by order of General Rosecrans.

G. P. THRUSTON,

Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS TWENTIETH ARMY CORPS,Stevenson, September 2, 1863-9 p.m.

General R. W. JOHNSON:

General McCook directs that you move your division forward at an early hour to-morrow morning, on the road taken by General Davis to-day, to a position near his division, so that the two divisions may be closed up. The bridge at Bridgeport broke down to-day, so that Sheridan's division will not be able to advance as rapidly as was expected, and on this account General Davis has not been ordered to move to-morrow-to give time for General Sheridan to keep up with him. Corps headquarters are at the foot of the mountain, but General McCook will probably remain here to-night.

G. P. THRUSTON,

Chief of Staff.

STEVENSON, ALA., September 2, 1863-12.45 p.m.

General P. H. SHERIDAN,

Commanding Third Division, Bridgeport:

General McCook directs that you move your troops and train up the mountain to-night if practicable. The Fourteenth Corps will
