THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
April 10,
tions and reports to make; and it is not customary
to insist on taking up a bill while there is busi-
ness of that kind to be presented. I do not know
how long the bill will take. At any rate, I will
call for the yeas and nays, if the Senator insists
on his motion, to see if the morning business is
to be postponed.
Mr. LANE. I am not disposed to be in the
way of Senators with their business; but i am
sure I have not taken much time of the Senate.
This is a bill in relation to lands granted to the
State of Oregon under the provisions of the law
providing for her admission, by which the lands
franted must be selected within a given time.
'hat time is about expiring. These lands have
been given for the advantage of the State of Or-
egon; and they have not had an opportunity, for
want of the meeting of the Legislature, to provide
means for locating the lands; and as it is entirely
local, relating to her interests exclusively, and
providing for selecting lands granted to the State
by lav/, I trust that Senators will allow it to be
taken up and passed.
The VICE PRESIDENT. On the motion to
take up this bill the yeas and nays are demanded.
The yeas and nays were ordered.
Mr. TRUMBULL. I trust the Senator from
Oregon will not persist in a motion to take up a
bill before we can relieve ourselves of petitions.
He will gain nothing by this. The resistance to
his motion is not opposition to the bill which he
wishes to call up. It is because we wish to re-
lieve ourselves of these papers.
# Mr. LANE, I will do anything in the world
to oblige Senators. If they say " withdraw it, and
let it lie," I will do so. I am willing to yield.
Let them present their papers.
The VICE PRESIDENT. If there be no ob-
jection the motion may be withdrawn, the yeas
and nays having been ordered. The Chcur hears
no objection.
