warded with the next detachment for delivery: Colonel J. C. Morehead, Dr. Joseph E. Dixon, Captain or Lieutenant James H. Baker, Private John W. Garrett, Company D, First Kentucky [Infantry] Volunteers. The two officers referred to in your letter of the 30th will accompany the first party ordered to City Point. Prisoners of war are not permitted to decline to be sent forward for exchanged, and if there was no better reason for detaining Doctor Read at the depot than that it was not sufficient. General Burnside has been directed to order all prisoners of war in his department to City Point, and if you have received the order notify me by telegraph.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. HOFFMAN,

Colonel Third Infantry, Commissary-General of Prisoners.

Colonel WILLIAM HOFFMAN, Washington City.

HONORABLE SIR: Permit me to trouble you for a pass to visit the rebel prisoners at Johnson's Island. I am Catholic pastor in Sandusky City and successor to Rev. L. Molon, to whom you generously gave a permit. I inclose a note from the major commanding, which will be for you a kind of testimony that all will be right. Excusing myself for troubling you,

I remain, honorable, sir, respectfully,

R. A. SIDLEY.

DEAR SIR: I shall be pleased to see you at my quarters, but under my orders it will be necessary for you to have the order of Colonel William Hoffman, commissary-general of prisoners, Washington, D. C., before you can be admitted to see the prisoners. He gave such an order to Father Molon, and I presume will to you; but I have not the authority.

Very respectfully,

WM. S. PIERSON,

Major, Commanding.
