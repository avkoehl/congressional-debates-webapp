deny it We have had no Executive recommen

ruined (as I will show) under the pret«uee of re-
lief.   This bill has for its author not John Tyler,
but a Sen-.tur fiom ihe West-, who comes to'Con

tating all ihe measures which Congress «hall pass,

convulsive efforts < f these baiks to regain politi-

paltry purpose of po'it cal triumph, thus to  crip-
ple their own resources'' No, sir, no.
This aggregate of $580,943 497 was the aggre-
gate loas of fifty one years Dividad by that num-
ber and yoa have the annual loss $11 374,39$—
enough, or nearly enough, to support ihis Govern-
ment, economic* ly adrmms ered Well, sir, what
does toe bill under consideration propose to do?
To leoonnect ihe Government wnh banks, and
thereby to open anew this exhausting annual drain
upon their resources; and yet we are to'd it is for
ihe relief ot the people
Mr Chairman, we are told you have anoih°r
scheme for the relief of the people. What is it,
sir? To divile the prtceedsoi tbc public lands
among the Sta es' Vfes, this is another of the re-
lief measures of ho dominant party of this House.
You teU us your Treasury is e>npty, asd that there
is a large nati nal drb to pay, and you have actu-
ary passed v. bill taxing tea, coffee, sugar, salt, mo-
'a s s and cot on ba"girg, to pay lhat deb', and at
trse same urn- yoa 'ake from the Treasury all the
money artiir-g from the ^ales of the public lands,
amoun'mg to between three and five millions an-
nually, and give it away to ihe States
Sir, js it relief to ihe people to tax them with one
hand, that you may give it away with the otheit
It ,t was really your intention 10 relieve ihe people,
why did you not let the money arming from the
sale of the public lands, remain in the Treasury,
to pay th" nece siry expenditure* of this Govern-
ment It wou d have superseded the necessity of
laying a tax of 20 icreent. on tea, coffee, and cjt-
tcn ba"girg 'irus would have dimini bed the
burden 1 f the people, and ¡hereby relieved iherr,
for not doing tlu-, you can gws no reason that you
dare avow.
The truth 1, you have an ul e' or object to ef-
Í ct, rn I that is, a ht*h tariff for purposes of protec-
tion Hem e we hnd you advocating a «connec-
tion of the GoverimieiH with baak , by which the
people los" annually            -            -   #11,374,399
Assuming the debts due by the States,
and pledging the public lands ¡or
the payment of that debt, amount-
to              -            -   $200,000,000
Ínteres* per annum at

Sir, this r; an enormou  amount, the codectioa
of whuh will cripple the eneigy and panlyze the
. 1 'ustry of t! e people, but a t  a 1 necessary to the
full eorryh 10a d a s stem ot raea,ures, to the at-
tainment tí whi 1 all j^ur legislation   directly
tends
N)w,sir,the ba'uens of Í13 Government fall
in a very unequal dtg'ee upon the different sec-
t oils 01 this Union. Tne South pays the tax into
the public Treasury—¡' is d'sburs-ed in the North,
and at the s.1.ie time th> í>¡or'h receives protection
upon h<.r manulacittres-, to n^ar y th  amount of
the rev cm es of ti   nation Will the South stand
this s\sem 01 b-tnl ing, dis ribulion, and exces-
si/t e> lenduwes-, for the sole purpose of piotecting
he >n<.f ufactures ci the Nortu! She will not; she
oridi not, if she wotdd And I tell you now, sir,
if his v tern cf fraud and inequality is ours-ned to
¡nat uuv, ihe iSouih will secede from this Union,
iet ci u-tqu pt-e^ be woat they may I do not say
tnio 111 a si, ri of defiance, or with teelmgs oí exut-
Ut 1 r No, sir, fat from it We know the evils
11 d>sU4 ion, but between sjaveiy ail antrchy, we
rhco 2 the ¡stter I w 11 rot looir at consequen-
cci, beyond the existence of tne Union—1 trust ibis
is not to be the fate of my country—I trust «ome
rnodetn L.eonidas will show himself m ihe Ther-
moDy a3 of his country, and save her from evils
which seem to await her.
Sir, John Tyler could ask no higher honor than
io fall himself, to save his country.   He can do it,
