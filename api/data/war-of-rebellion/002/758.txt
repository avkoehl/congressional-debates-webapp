If you have sick and wounded that cannot walk, I will send ambulances. Give them ample for their breakfast, and make out extra returns to cover the issue from your stores.

We are all amply able to whip the enemy if he will give us a chance here.

MANSFIELD,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS OF THE ARMY,Washington, July 23, 1861.

Brigadier-General McDOWELL, Arlington:

An Ohio volunteer, who left Centreville at 9 o'clock yesterday morning, walked to this place, and did not see an enemy. May you not profit by this, and send out for our wounded and stragglers? It is reported that Mr. Jefferson Davis, or the enemy, is advancing upon your lines. This is possible. Rally and compact your troops to meet any emergency.
