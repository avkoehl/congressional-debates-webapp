Colonel Campbell reports nothing heard of enemy to-day. I have sent strong parties out to gain information of McReynolds' men. I did intend to go through Bloomery Gap, and thence to Sir John's Run. The only other way to get there is to return across the river and down the other side about 40 miles, over a very hilly road. Campbell has one company at South Branch, one at Great Cacapon, four at Sir John's Run, one at Hancock and at Sleepy Run. It would not be proper for me to leave here, I think, until I hear from the parties gone out.

WM. W. AVERELL,

Brigadier-General.

SIR JOHN'S RUN, October 7, 1862-6.40.

R. B. MARCY,

Chief of Staff, Army of the Potomac:

The infantry force, supposed to be about 700, is believed to be in Hedgesville. The cavalry, I am informed, has fallen back to Pughtown. I did not inform General Kelley that they were advancing on me, but that they were falling back. I have no cavalry. The small force I had, 71 men, under Captain [A. H.] Langholz, left Sleepy Creek on Sunday nigh without orders, and crossed into Maryland. I have not heard of them since.

J. M. CAMPBELL,

Colonel Fifty-fourth Pennsylvania Regiment.

The enemy's cavalry have recrossed into Virginia, near the mouth of the Monocacy. You will, therefore, order back your brigade from McConnellsburg to Hancock, and proceed to Clarksburg, according to your original orders. Please forward the accompanying dispatch to General Averell.*
