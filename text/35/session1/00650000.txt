to the chair by Messrs. Allen and Jones, said:
Gentlemen of the Senate : I acknowledge
with feelings of lively sensibility the confidence
you have reposed in me. The situation is new
to me, and it could doubtless have been more ap-
propriately assigned to a more experienced and
older member of the body. ~Vou may rest as-
sured, however, that I shall, to the extent of my
ability, impartially and faithfully discharge the
duties incident to the station, relying at all times
upon the uniform courtesyand forbearance which
have characterized the deliberations of the Senate.

is of an executive character.

and, after some time spent therein, the doors
\ltere reopened.
On motion of Mr. SEWARD, the Senate took
a recess for half an hour; at the expiration of
which time the President pro tempore resumed
the chair.
Mr. STUART. It is very obvious that the
other House will not organize m time to enable
us to appoint a committee to wait on the Presi-
dent and hear from him to-day; and, therefore,
I move that the Senate adjourn.
The motion was agreed to; and the Senate
adjourned.
