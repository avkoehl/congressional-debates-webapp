HEADQUARTERS FIRST ARMY CORPS,January 8, 1865.

General R. E. LEE,

Commanding, &amp;c.:

The excitement reported in the enemy's lines on Tuesday and Wednesday may be further evidence of the move against Wilmington that the deserter reports.

J. LONGSTREET,

Lieutenant-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIRST ARMY CORPS,January 8, 1865.

Lieutenant General R. S. EWELL,

Chaffin's:

A deserter from the Twenty-fourth Corps reports that nearly all the troops from this side of the river gone off to renew the attack on Wilmington. Will you endeavor to ascertain if any changes has been made in your front?

O. LATROBE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS JOHNSON'S DIVISION,January 8, 1865.

Major R. P. DUNCAN,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

MAJOR: I have nothing of importance to report this morning. The following casualties are respectfully reported: Ransom's brigade, 1 killed and 1 wounded; Wise's brigade, 1 wounded.

Most respectfully, your obedient servant,

B. R. JOHNSON,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS,Wilmington, January 8, 1865.

General BRAGG,

Commanding Department of North Carolina:

GENERAL: I think it not at all unlikely that a renewal of the attack on Wilmington will be made very soon. It is hardly possible that the enemy will put up with such a failure as the last. I should keep one good brigade and a battery at Sugar Loaf, and send at least a regiment, and a strong one, if not a brigade, to Piney Point. The very reduced cavalry force is not sufficient to do more than observe-is not, indeed, adequate for that-and I hope that on any renewal of an attempt to land, the enemy will not be allowed to do so without opposition. Information received from Morehead City indicates so far that another attack is imminent, and therefore these suggestions are respectfully offered.

Very respectfully,

W. H. C. WHITING,

Major-General.
