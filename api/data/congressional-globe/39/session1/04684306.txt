Mr. DELANO. I move that the amend-
ment of the Senate be concurred in.
The motion was agreed to.
Mr. DELANO moved to reconsider the vote
by which the amendment was concurred in; and
also moved to lay the motion to reconsider
on the table.
The latter motion was agreed to.
RETURN OF DRAFT COMMUTATION.
Mr. ANCONA called for the regular ordei
of business.
The House accordingly resumed the con-
sideration of House bill No. 811, for the relief
of certain drafted men, which had been post-
poned to and made the special order for to-day
immediately after the reading of the Journal.
The bill was read at length. The preamble
sets forth that certain persons drafted into the
military service of the United States, under the
calls of the President of the United States of
February 1, 1864, and March 14,1864, paid the
sum of $300 each, that being the amount of
commutation fixed for such service in the fifth
section of the amendatory enrollment act of
February 24, 1864; and the same personswere
afterward again drafted under the call of' De-
cember 11), 1864, or within less than one year
of the previous draft, and before the filling up of
all the quotas assigned under the two calls first
named above, and were then required to enter
the service or furnish substitutes; and the true
intent and meaning of the fifth section of the
amendatory act of February 24,1864, being to
exempt persons thus paying commutation until
the quotas assigned under such calls were full,
not exceeding one year, the Secretary of War
is directed t-o refund the sum of $300 so paid
by persons for commutation who were after-
ward again drafted as above stated.
Mr. ANCONA. I move to amend by striking
out these words:
Provided, That this section shall apply only to claims
received at the War Department prior the passage
of this act.
The amendment was agreed to.
Mr. ANCONA. I now call the previous
question.
The previous question was seconded and the
main question ordered.
The bill, as amended, was then ordered to be
engrossed and read a third time ; and it ,was
accordingly read the third time and passed.
Mr. ANCONA moved to reconsider the vote
by which the bill was passed j and also moved
to lay the motion to reconsider on the table.
The latter motion was agreed to.
PUBLICATION OF ACTS OF CONGRESS.
Mr. ANCONA introduced the following res-
olution ; which was referred to the-Committee
on Printing under the law:
Resolved, That there be printed for the use of this
House ten thousand copies of the acts of the present
session of Congress.
PENITENTIARIES IN TUB TERRITORIES.
Mr. RICE, of Maine, moved that the rules
be suspended and the Committee of the Whole
on the state of the Union discharged from the
further consideration of the bill of the House
(No. 715) setting aside certain proceeds from
internal revenue for the erection of peniten-
tiaries in the Territories of Nebraska, Washing-
ton, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Arizona, and
Dakota, for the purpose of having the same
considered in the House.
The motion was agreed to.
