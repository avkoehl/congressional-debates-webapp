General S. COOPER,Adjutant and Inspector General, Richmond, Va.:

GENERAL: Your telegram of the 23rd is just received. At the time that I applied for General Ransom to command General Hood's division I did not know that he had a command, and had no one in view to take his place in his present command. I found it impossible to use the division to great advantage, owing to the jealousy between two of the brigadiers (Jenkins and Law), and applied for General Ransom, knowing him to be an active officer and believing him well able for the command.
