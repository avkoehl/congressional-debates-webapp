IN SENATE.
Tuesday, Jlpril 9, 1850.
Mr. WEBSTER. I am sorry, Mr. President,
quite sorry, to be obliged to request of the Senate
that I may be excused from performing the duties
of one of the committee who has been raised by
the Senate for the purpose of accompanying; the re-
mains of the late distinguished Senator from South
Carolina [Mr. Calhoun] to his mansion in that
State. Being quite desirous of doing whatever I
could to manifest respect for the illustrious dead,
and sympathy and condolence for the living, I had
hoped it might be in my power to proceed with
the rest of the committee on this service. But I
find that there is a necessity, on account of private
affairs, that I should, for a few days, visit my
own home. This will render it impossible for me
to perform the service which I, under other cir-
cumstances, would have cheerfully performed. I
must, therefore, pray the Senate to take such
measures as may be necessary to fill my place on
the committee.
Mr. MASON. I regret very much that cir-
cumstances have occurred which require that the
Senator from Massachusetts should decline the
service to which he was appointed; but 1 am sat-
isfied that circumstance did require that he should
ask to be excused from that service. The com-
mittee waa appointed by the Chair, under a reso-
lution of the Senate, and I move that the Chair
have autho;ity to fill the vacancy.
The motion was agreed to.
The VICE PRESIDENT nominated Mr.
Clarke, of Rhode Island, to serve in the place
of Mr. Webster, excused.
