APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE,
July, 184!.
27th Cong"-1st Sess.
Fiscal Bank—Mr. Choate.
Senate,
say they need it to íestore, reform, and regulate their currency
We say th«ynped it to promote business intercourse amoi g
the Mates and between this counny and other countues, hy
m-^anaofaflynem of steady and economical exchange Wt
«uv they netd it to keep an 1 transmit then public mousy, and
t"> give them the benefit ol it in one way and another while it
He* on hind We say they need it, last and least, to increase
t leir supply of cred t accommodations, foi the prosecution of
th^ir vast and various enterprises
Well, sir, they need it now They need it to day This mo
mem, while we continue the dispute, ihey need it He seiveg
'hem beat, he series them twice over, who seive^ (hem soonest
in this matter Now, I believe I shall meet this demand'of the
countiy aoonei by this amendment than without it Look for
a moment at the altei natives presented We know that we
can make the amended bill into a law at this session of Con
gress We know, judging on all the circumstances, that there
are no opinions, here or elsewheie, to prevent it, u the ftjends
ofalkmk unite m its favor I believe, too, that the Bank
which tin** I iw will establish may go into operation to some
use u! and substantia! ex'ent, by thefiist of lannaiy certainly
by ih° fi sw of Apu' next It is said, and it m ty be, that capí

S ates will ceitamlyas ant to the establishment ol blanches at

duty, and was my pulpóse, had not all opinions heie united < n
this District for the so a of the mother Bank to present the
Claims of Boston to that distinction If Masoaohusetis should
give her assent, it would be pleasant to see New York sulkily
and suicidally lefu i litis &hc would nomoie do it thm she
would voluntarily come down fiom the throne o our commer

who mark their objects and pursue them with the eyes of
eagles do not vote afninsttheamendment m sufficient num.beta
to defeat it if we divide on it among ourselves T speak not
of motives, and I know nothing of attual intentions, but I
reason from the obvious nature of the case, and I believe that,
if they see that noihin<r else will, their paity tactics wi'l de-
feat it
Toi my part I own that T wish the new Administration to
have the honor a rd the fUicny of carrying svtc(-c<*biullv thiough

c-nved this amendment,you will find that it jn truth assumes
and asserts the eonstitutionai power of the JNatonal Legi^kiure
totieaie a cotporanon which has auttioii'\ to transact m
ever> oneo^the S ates all the business ulabrk exce[t that
of discounting So much powei it necessiniv assumes and
asserts And then as 10 the busnitbbof making tl set nuts, it
neither assens 1101 denes that you have the power to authorize
it without thea^entof the States, 11 just authorizes the cor-
poranon to do it with then assent, and thei e 1* leat os tne mat
ter Coth classes of expounders of ¡he Cons itution, certainly
tbatto which I belong may vo*e lor such a bill without yield-
ing any orinion oi changing n the least the sacred, and awful
text of the great Charter ltscK
Let me say, sir, that to administer the contested powers of
the Constitution is, for tho=e of you who believe that they
exist, at all times a trust of cifhculty and delicacy I do not
know that t should not venture to* sugges tint gereral direc-
tion or the performance of tl at g ave duty Steadily and
stiongly assert their existence, do not «urtender them, retain
them with a provident f( recab , for it e time may come when
yoa will need to enfuice them by the who e moial and physi-
cal strength of the Vn on, hut do not e\ptt them at all so long
as you can by o her test, off Msive expelen so*"wisdom effec- '
tuatly secure to the ¡reo 1 ill the pr itlical renefitsw ich you
beheve they weie inserted 'mo tne Constitution to t-ecure
Thus will the Union last longest ml do most good To exer-
cise a conte&ted powet without necessity on a pntion of keep-
ingup the tone of governn ent is not much bet er than tyranny,
and veiv 1 npiovident ard impoi t c tynwy too It is turn-
ing "exuemi. rncdiunt, into daily biead " It foi gets that the
final end of government is not to exert 1 estratot, but to de
gool
Within this general view of the true mode of administering
contested power , 1 think the mi asme we piopo^e js as wiueas
it is conciliator; wise because 11 is c mcdiatoiy wi^e heoause
it reconciles a sound and a btrong theory of the Constitution
