I consider it absolutely necessary that the navy should make every effort in this matter possible, and should attend particularly, so far as is in their power, to keeping the river patrolled. that portion of it which is not covered by batteries, and from which I have been compelled by necessity to withdraw troops, ought to be constantly under the watch and guard of the navy. Please to advise with the flag officer, to whom I also will send a request and you may communicate these suggestions.

A force under the direction of an engineer is already engaged in taking up iron on the York River road. Unless necessity requires, which I hope will not be the case, the road within the defenses will be retained intact.

JAMES A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War.

Proper representations have any reference to the restoration of the road. Indeed, it has been me policy, so far as with reference to the truth and propriety I could, to induce the public impression that the injury is more serious and
