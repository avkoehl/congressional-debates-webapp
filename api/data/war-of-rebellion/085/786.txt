a general uprising of the disloyal element in that region, and that Price is conscripting both white and black who are not enlisting voluntarily. The river is so low that the lightest boats are required for navigation.

A. PLEASONTON,

Major-General, Commanding.

JEFFERSON CITY, October 11, 1864-5.25 p. m.

Major-General ROSECRANS:

Please hasten forward the supplies of subsistence and forage for this place. I do not wish to be delayed by the non-arrival of supplies, and the stock here is almost exhausted. General Smith's command should be here to-morrow; his cavalry arrived to-day. I am in hopes to be able to forward some of them west by rail to-morrow.

A. PLEASONTON,

Major-General, Commanding.

SAINT LOUIS, October 11, 1864-6.50 p. m.

Major-General PLEASONTON, Jefferson City:

Dispatches received. Supplies will go forward with all possible promptness. This movement across the river requires attention.

Attend to Fisk's supplies.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.

JEFFERSON CITY, October 11, 1864.

Major-General ROSECRANS:

Dispatch of 6.50 p. m. received. General Fisk has ample supplies, and is in good position to prevent re-enforcements coming to the enemy at Rocheport. Price has sent over from 1,500 to 2,000 cavalry to pick up horses and conscripts, but I don't think he intends crossing. They have left the country full of broken-down horses, which I have authorized to be taken by such citizens as have lost animals by the rebels, horse for horse; the remainder is taken by the quartermaster.

A. PLEASONTON,

Major-General, Commanding.

SAINT LOUIS, October 11, 1864-9.15 p. m.

Major General A. PLEASONTON, Jefferson City:

If Price has halted at Boonville, instead of moving westward rapidly, as reported yesterday, the general says it will not be best for your troops to go too far out on the railroad. They had better move directly on him.

R. S. THOMS,

Captain and Aide-de-Camp.

JEFFERSON CITY, October 11, 1864-10 p. m.

Major-General ROSECRANS:

Please send a battery of artillery to this place. Only two small guns are left here, as the others are in the field, and I need a battery for the brigade of cavalry under Catherwood. Let the guns be 3-inch. Battery I, Second Missouri, is one, and is at Franklin.

A. PLEASONTON,

Major-General.
