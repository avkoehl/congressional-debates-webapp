or sick under such circumstances. It is well
known that such citizens resort to foreign
countries in great numbers. Though most of
theiu are able to bear the expenses incident to
locomotion, there are some who through acci-
dent or otherwise become penniless and have
no friends at home able to succor them. Per-
sons in this situation must either perish, cast
themselves upon the charity of foreigners, or
be relieved at the private charge of our own
officers, who usually, even with the most
benevolent dispositions, have nothing to spare
for such purposes.
Should the authority and appropriation asked
for be granted, care will be taken so to carry
the beneficence of Congress into effect that it
shall not be unnecessarily or unworthily
bestowed.

With the great reduction of taxation by the
acts of Congress at its last session, the expend-
iture of the Government in collecting the
revenue will be much reduced for the next
fiscal year. It is very doubtful, however,
whether any further reduction of so vexatious
a burden upon any people will be practicable
for the present. At all events, as a measure
of justice to the holders of the nation's cer-
tificates of indebtedness, I would recommend
that no more legislation be had on this subject,
unless it be to correct errors of omission or
commission in the present laws until sufficient
time has elapsed to prove that it can be done
and still leave sufficient revenue to meet cur-
rent expenses of Government, pay interest on
the public debt, and provide for the sinking
fund established by law.
The preservation of our national credit is of
the highest importance; next in importance
to this comes a solemn duty to provide a
national currency, of fixed, unvarying value
as compared with gold ; and as soon as prac-
ticable, having due regard for the interests of
the debtor class and the vicissitudes of trade
and commerce, convertible into gold at par.
WAS DEPARTMENT.
The report of the Secretary of War shows
the expenditures of the War Department for
the fiscal year ending June 30, 1871, to be
$35,799,991 82, and for the fiscal year ending
June 30, 1872, to be$35,372,157 20—showing
a reduction in favor of the last fiscal year of
$427,834 62. The estimates for military ap-
propriations for the next fiscal year, ending
June 30, 1874, are $33,801,378 78. The esti-
mates of the Chief of Engineers are submitted
separately for fortifications, river and harbor
improvements, and for public buildings and
grounds and the Washington aqueduct.
The affairs of the Freedmen's Bureau have
all been transferred to the War Department,
and regulations have been put into execution
for the speedy payment of bounty, pay, &c.,
due colored soldiers properly coming under
that bureau. All war accounts for money and
property prior to 1871 have been examined
and transmitted to the Treasury for final set-
tlement.
During the fiscal year there have been paid
for transportation on railroads $1,300,000, of
which $800,857 was over the Pacific railroad ;
for transportation by water, $626,373 62,
and by stage, $48,975 84; for the purchase
of transportation, animals, wagons, hire of
teamsters, &c., $924,650 64. About$370,000
have been collected from southern railroads
during the year, leaving about $4,000,000
still due.
The quartermaster has examined and trans-
mitted to the accounting officers for settle-
ment $367,172 72 of claims by loyal citizens
for quartermaster's stores taken during the
war. Subsistence supplies to the amount of
$89,048 12 have been issued to Indians.
The annual average mean strength of the
Army was 24,101 white and 2,494 colored sol-
diers. The total deaths for the year reported
were 367 white and 54 colored.
The distribution of the Medical and Surgical
History of the War is yet to be ordered by Con-
gress.
There exists an absolute necessity for a
medical corps of the full number established
by act of Congress of July 28, 1866, there
being now fifty-nine vacancies, and the num-
ber of successful candidates rarely exceeds
eight or ten in any one year.
! The river and harbor improvements have
been carried on with energy and economy,
j Though many are only partially completed, the
results have saved to commerce many timet
the amount expended. The increase of com-
merce, with greater depth of channels, greater
security in navigation, and the saving of time,
adds millions to the wealth of the country and
increases the resources of the Government.
The bridge across the Mississippi river at
Rock Island has been completed, and the
' proper site has been determined upon for the
bridge at La Crosse.
! The able and exhaustive report made by
i the commission appointed to investigate the
Sutro tunnel has been transmitted to Con-
gress.
The observations and reports of the Signal
Office have been continued. Stations have
been maintained at each of the principal lake,
seaport, and river cities. Ten additional
stations have been established in the United
States, and arrangements have been made for
an exchange of reports with Canada, and a
similar exchange of observations is contem-
plated with the West India islands.
The favorable attention of Congress is in-
vited to the following recommendations of the
Secretary of War: A discontinuance of the
appointment of extra lieutenants to serve as
adjutants and quartermasters; the adoption
of a code providing specific penalties for well-
defined offenses, so that the inequality of sea-
' tences adjudged by courts-martial may be
, adjusted ; the consolidation of accounts under
which expenditures are made, as a measure
of economy; a reappropriatiou of the money
I for the construction of a depot at San An-
tonio, the title to the site being now perfected;
a special act placing the cemetery at the city
! of Mexico on the same basis as other national
' cemeteries ; authority to purchase sites for
i military posts in Texas; the appointment of
commissary sergeants from non-commissioned
officers, as a measure for securing the better
care and protection of supplies ; an appropri-
ation for the publication of the catalogue and
tables of the anatomical section of the Army
Medical Museum; a reappropriation of the
amount for the manufacture of breech loading
arms, should the selection be so delayed by
the board of officers as to leave the former
appropriation unexpended at the close of the
fiscal year; the sale of such arsenals east of
the Mississippi as can be spared, and the pro-
ceeds applied to the establishment of one
large arsenal of construction and repair upon
the Atlantic coast, and the purchase of a
suitable site for a proving and experimental
ground for heavy ordnance ; the abrogation
of laws which deprive inventors in the United
States service from deriving any benefit
from their inventions; the repeal of the law
prohibiting promotions in the staff corps; a
continuance of the work upon coast defenses;
the repeal of the seventh section of the act of
July 13, 1866, taking from engineer soldiers
the per diem granted to other troops; a limit-
ation of time for presentation of old war
claims for subsistence supplies, under act of
July 4, 1864; and a modification in the mode
of the selection of cadets fbr the Military
Academy, in order to enhance the usefulness
of the Academy, which is impaired by reason
of the large amount of time necessarily ex-
pended in giving new cadets a thorough know-
ledge of the more elementary branches of
learning which they should acquire before
entering the Academy ; also an appropriation
for philosophical apparatus,*and an increase
