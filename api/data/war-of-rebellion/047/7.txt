ances due at the time of desertion, but are subject to the severe penalties awarded by law to that crime.

III. When a man leaves this command without proper authority,, and remains absent more than one day, his company commander will report him as "deserted" on his next morning report, and will prefer written charges against him to be forwarded through regimental to brigade headquarters; and if the man afterward returns, he will be reported as having "joined from desertion and awaiting trial," and these remarks, with the proper dates annexed thereto, will be placed opposite his name on the next subsequent muster-roll of his company, unless he shall in the meantime have been tried and acquitted, or restored to duty without trial by the general competent to order the same. Company and regimental commanders have no authority to dispose of such cases.

By order of Brigadier General Q. A. Gillmore:

ED. W. SMITH,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE SOUTH,Port Royal, S. C., June 30, 1863.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief, U. S. Army, Washington, D. C .:

SIR: I have to report no important changes in the condition of things at Folly Island. My preparations are nearly completed, but I can no nothing until Admiral DuPont's successor arrives and gets ready to work. The admiral has no instructions, and does not feel at liberty to put his vessels into action on the even of relinquishing his command. I believe we could get Morris Island without the assistance of the navy, but so long as they lie outside the bar the enemy's iron-clads and other gunboats could annoy us so much that we could accomplish very little toward the erection of batteries.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Q. A. GILLMORE,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
