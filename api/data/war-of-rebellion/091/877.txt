executed your orders. I hope you will continue to harass the enemy's troops as much as possible, and retain his efforts to exercise civil authority in the counties in which you are operating. I inclose a copy* of a letter written some time since, in case the original should not have reached you, and call your attention to the instructions it contains.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. E. LEE,

General.
