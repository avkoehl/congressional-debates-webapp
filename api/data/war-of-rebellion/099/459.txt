MAJOR: I have the honor to report the operations of this command for yesterday, the 16th instant, as follows: Broke camp at 7 a.m. and moved across Congaree Creek; halted until near noon, then moved to ground occupied in the morning by First Division. Remained at that point until 2 p.m., and then moved to bank of Congaree River, opposite Columbia. At 4 p.m. received orders to follow Fourth Division and cross Saluda River at Saluda Factory; commenced crossing at the earliest possible monet (11 p.m.). The last of the command (except supply trains) arrived at camp near bridge across Broad River at 2 o'clock this p.m. These headquarters are established on the east side of the main road, opposite the left of the division. The troops were, owing to the lateness of the hour, encamped with reference to their comfort.
