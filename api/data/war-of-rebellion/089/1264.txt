WILMINGTON, December 9, 1864.

General HEBERT, Smithville:

I intended to come down to-day but cannot. Lee reports the Fifth and Second Corps from Grant's army, with a division of cavalry and a large number of wagons and cattle, moving on North Carolina by Veldon. Last night they were near Belfield. A part of Lee's army is following. He requires all the troops in this department available to oppose. Between Bragg and Lee, Sherman and Grant, od North Carolina is in a pretty fix. This morning I get word from the front that raids are moving on railroad from Sheppardsville and New Berne. Am compelled to hold Jackson in hand with Paris' battery and three battalions of Junior Reserves. Am glad there is a northeaster.

W. H. C. WHITING,

Major-General.
