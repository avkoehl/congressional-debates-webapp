of their own political party If gentlemen on the othei side
chose to make this a party q lestion, it lay at then, own dour
Asa representative of the people, Mi II would art on more
enlarged views, not stopping simply to inqune how the system
would operate on New Jersey but lo iking to its general effect
throughout the Union at lai^e The policy of his own Sate
had, for the last twenty years, been against the amendment
She had elected by general ticke ever since LS12, but he should
be governed by more general and extended views
Aftothemoiives which had operated on the committee, the
first was a desire to produce uniformity in the representa ion
of the States. It was essential to a good law that it should be
permanent, uniform, and umveisal, but tbe law of elections,
aa it now stood, was neithei The second motive was a wish
to secure equality in political rights Another was to give per
manence and stability to this important part of our republican
system Again, the measure was essential to the permanence
of our free institu ions Next, hecause this would supply a de
feet long seen, and often, but hitherto in vain, attempted to be
remedied, and further, to secure to all the States the Demo
cratic feature of the Constitution, viz a full expression of
popular opinion
Mr H insisted that the Representative ought to be one of the
people, intimate with the circumstances, wishes, and opinions
of those he represented, one of the.r neighbors, whom they
knew, and who knew them but the adoption of a general
ticket election rendered this impossible The Stafe of New
York, for example, contained 93 000 farmers and92 0OO of the
manufacturing and commercial interest if the geneial ticket
should be adopted m that S a*e, the wh de of her lorty votes on
the floor oí Congress would be directed by the agricultural in
terest, exclusively In other States the balance was the other
way, and a like injustice would he done to the farming interest
The Juggernaut of caucus must lecide every t hmg
Ourrepresentative s>-tem of government ha I been denved
from Gieat Britain and in thatcountiy, so Ion? ago as 12bo in
the daysof Henry HI, writs had been issued (or the election of
burgesses to Parliament but such, a thu g as the central ticket
system never had been thought o( This was the case at the
time of our Revolution, and the framers of our Constitution
never intended to make an alteiation in this respect, of the an
cient system
Besides, should the geneial ticket system prevail, it would be
practically, physically impossible to (airy out that pro ísion
of the Constitution that made Congress the exclusive judges of
the election and qualifications of their own members In the
small Stateof l\ew Jeisey, with a population of but 373090,
there had occuired, atan excited election, Gb4 ccntested cases
for a committee to examine, and it had taken about se-ven
months Now Newlork had a oopjlation of 2 400 000 At
the same rate, how many cases might arise iheie and how
many years would it take a comnmtet to <?o through their ex
animation'* The provision of the Constitution must be vutu
ally annulled, for it cmil I not be carried into effect And yet
such, a case was not unlikely to occur If the smaller S ates ton
tmued to secure an undue proportion of power by adhering to
the general ticket plan, could H be expected that the laiger
States, in self defence, would notadopt th*, same?
Mr H now proceeded to notice tht objections which had
been urged against the amendments proposed by the comm ttee
to the bill He first direc ed his attention to the ronstite lonal
objections, and then to those which íefenel to expediency
He referred to the modifications which had been made m con
vention, of theonginal piopositton of Challes Pmckney in le
gard tothe pawer of Congress over the subject of elections,
laying great stie=¡s on the insertion of the word 'mike' in ad
dition tothepievnusworti "alter, ' which he was understood as
contending gave Congiess 01 iginal iun&dictton over the whole
subject wheiever it chose to legislate in legaid t* it He
quoted, 10 support of this view contempoianeous evieeiue,
drawn from speeches recorded in Elliot's Debates He next
went into fciiner Congressional action on the subject, Mr
M'DumVs íeport pioposing to tix the hstuct system by an
amendment to the Constitution, which alone could give it per
manence
As to the objection? based oi expediency, the first wis, that
it Congressacted at all, it musf leguldte the w hole subieci and
the adoption ofthe amendment would amount to giving dnec
Hon to the States as to their legisla ion    Th s objeitnn vent

and required subsequent legislation on the part of the Mates to

by direction oí the com mi tee, he hid tht honor to oflei
Mr FERRIS now nb mned tht. floei, and s\ ole in opposition
to the amendment The pow er it proposed to Congtess to exer-
cise* was not merely a dormant, it was a latent p >wer it was
nowhere tobe founu in the language oí the Cmib ituuon but
jatíst be drawn out of u by inference and cons ruction    The
gi eat mass of the nation had long acquiesced in the exercise of
the power by the ¡states alene yet now, without any application
on the part of the people, without any íesolutjous of primary
assemblies, or any memorials or petitions to Congress from any
quarter, by the mere ieoolve of a committee it was proposed to
introduce a new practice in a matter of such weighty import
anee The plea was, that the larger States might adopt the gen
eral ticket system, and, by combining together, might rule the
residue of the States But to attempt to guard against this by
legislation on the part of Congress, was to invoke a dangerous
power now latent into a ata e of formidable activity Should
the large ¡states take fire at this attempt to control them, could
they not, by combining their votes in Congress, at any lime
change the law1* And what would be the consequence, should
they fix the general ticket system on all the States? If Congress
could impose the district system, it could impose the general
ticket system Was it wise to attempt the exercise of a power
like this?
His colleague [Mr. Barnard) had said that this Government
ever must be administered by party Admitting this to be
true, where was party influence most to be dreaded—in Con
gress, where it could trample on all things and strike down at
a blow the legislation of ad the States, or in the State Legisla-
tures, where the action of one portion of the Union could be
counterbalanced by that of another 1 In the General Govern
ment, pa ty might be omnipotent, m the States, us power was
neutralized aud tendered comparatively harmless
It was not pretended that any very serious evils had resulted
from the existing state of things Some of the smaller States
had, indeed, resorted to the geneial ticket mode of election,
but there the di net system was less uetdtj, because, their
territory being sm ill the mteiests of the inhabitants were more
nearly identical—the chief necessity and value of the district
j Ian resulting from a diversity of interests in the same com
ITU my If the roui-se of the*e States gave them a dispropor
tionate weight of power in Congress u was for the larger
^ ates to compain, but no complaints had been preieired
Why should Congress act before the people had given any ex
predion of their opinions 1

THE POSTMASTER AT ST. LOUIS
Mr MERRICK said that some remarks were addressed to
the Senate on yesteiday morning in reference to the paper 
connected with a nomination pending before the Senate He
had learned—font was his misfortune to be absent from his seat
at the time—that the Senator from Missouri, [Mr Benton,] mr
the course of his remarks, in speaking of that nomination, sup-
posed the individual nominated was a relative of the Postmas-
ter Genei ii
Mr BENT ON (interrupting him) remaiked that he had said
a connexion of the Postmastei General
Mr MERRICK íemarked, that he had been informed that
the gentleman who had been nominated for postmaster at St
Louis, Missoun, was not a relative, nor was he regarded
as a connexion ol the P  stmaster General So far, the
Senator from Missoun was mistaken He had no doubt
the honorable Senator would promptly acknowledge his ciror
bo far as the eulij-'ct matter—the hceuse proper to be taken
with papers comm* before standing committees irom the
depaitmeiits—was concerned, he had some remarks to make,
and the wle object of those lemaiks was, to suggest to the
Senate the propriety of devising some mode of defining
the duties, oi of arriving at some distinct understanding of the
duties of the committees with legard- to papers forwaided to
them from the .Executive Departments, aflrdinginfoimaion
to guide the action of the committees He thought that they
ought to have a fair understanding of their duties on this
point—whether the committees should have the liberty to
make known to the public, oi not, papers of a confiden-
tial chaiacter, trar smitted to them merely to guide them
in their action He did not know that the committees
] ad such libeiiy, but adiveisity of opinion puvailed on the
subject, not only with Senatoio, but some of tl e heads of De-
partments, and it was his sde wish row, on mtioJucmg the
subject to hivá ■¡ume iction or un ier*tandmg by the Senate, to
govern the conduct ot the committees in future There had
been heietofoie some action by the Senate on a subject of a
kindred nature—the publication of papers communicated to
the Senate as confidential He did not think it propei to make
any lemarlts as to (he course of the Sena oi from Missouri in
publishing the papers to which the Senator alluded on yester
d ly To show ho vv fai there might be impropi jety in it, he would
only sa/ that he made application to the War Department to
examine certain papéis i n record in that office, arid he was re-
fused and was informed that such a privilege was only extend-
ed to Senators or members ex gratia^ oi by resolution of either
branch of Congress Wheihei the interpretation of the law by
the Secretary was right or not, he did not know
He would state another fact Ten years ago a Senatof
from Massachusetts [Mr Pickering] saw fit to read, in debate*
the contents of a communication which was made to th? £ei
ate by the President, in secret session, and fm °o domg, he re*
ceived the censure of the Senate, on a resolution submitted by
Mr Clay, which was in the following words
"Resoiweds That Timothy Picketing, a Senatot fiom Massa
chuseus, having mis day, while th* Senate weic sitting with
upen doors,icai fromhH p'act ceitam documents com mum
cited from the Pre^i lent of the U ued S.ate->—the mjunetionof
secrecv not havn g been iemo\ed— commuted a violation of
the rules ni th¡=; bod>
The resolution, sill M> M , was debated at con«ideiabie
length and Gen ^amuel ^mith, from hw (Mr Merrick's)
own Mite said * that there could be no doubt that there were
ceitain things of a cinfidential nature which were extremely
advantageous to them in making up then opinions and
the President, when miking «ecret rommi mratiorib, acted
wuh a saotig reliance on ihose with whom he coriunj
mcated and theief>ra they ought not to ihvidee th?t which
was intended to be kept "ecret If they shouid do «iO,
the President would not place reliance on tí em and iflike
communications on subjects for wlich ilvy might cal! *
These were the v lews entertained by Mi Smith and other gen
tlemen who took pait 11 the deba'e It wa  neces-sary for the
Se mtoi* in thedischdiseofthen duties on all executive sub-*
jecfi that the> shoul' have free access to all mfoimation
touching the subject matter which might ba under investiga
tionin t-eciet se-sion, foi the puipo^e of guiding their ju^g*
moot tnd enabling them toainve at correct conclusions fhe
communications might be of a confidential nature, an,, not to
he known beyond the limits of the Senate, therefore, there
should exist an understanding between the Executive and the
Senate duprted to this end As the cha)rr>an of the Commit-
tee on the Po3t Office, it was proper f^t he sliomd ask the
Senate to consider the subject, in order, to ascerta-n whether
some mode should not b<* adopted, to pjact; the mattei on a clear
and distinct footing These remarks were in no way intended
to reproach the Senator from "Missouri He liad no right to 
censure him for what he had done That Seia'c* was the best,
ludge of the propriety of his own conduct
