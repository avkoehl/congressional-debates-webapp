HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND, Nashville, March 31, 1865-5.30 p. m. (Received April 11.)

Lieutenant General U. S. GRANT,City Point, Va.:

Have heard of General Stoneman's command at Watauga River on the 25th. He is moving his main force down the valley of New River, as I telegraphed you on the 18th, from Chattanooga. General Tillson, with his infantry support, will move in the direction of Asheville, thirty miles north of Carter's Station, sufficiently strong to cover Stoneman's rear and give him support, should he be forced back by superior forces. On the same day Wilson was on the Black Warrior, in the vicinity of Tuscaloosa. He had captured some prisoners, reports many desertions from the rebels, and also that he had learned that Forrest was moving so as to interpose between him (Wilson) and Selma. I found the citizens of West Tennessee very anxious to restore civil government.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General, U. S. Army, Commanding.
