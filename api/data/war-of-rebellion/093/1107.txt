substituted? I do not think we can prevent the crossing of even the enemy's cavalry, because the places are so numerous. I think the best we can do is to hold the crossings near us and watch the distant ones.

NASHVILLE, November 28, 1864 - 10 a. m.

(Via Franklin.)

Major-General SCHOFIELD, Columbia:

The following just received from Lieutenant-General Grant:

CITY POINT, November 27 - 9 p. m.

Savannah papers, just received, state that Forrest is expected in the rear of General Sherman, and that Breckinridge is already on his way to Georgia from East Tennessee.

If this proves true, General Grant wishes me to take the offensive against Hood, and destroy the railroad into Virginia with Stoneman's force, now beyond Knoxville. General Smith will certainly be here in three days, when I think we will be able to commence moving on Hood, whether Forrest goes to Georgia or remains with Hood.

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding.

NEAR COLUMBIA, November 28, 1864.

Major-General THOMAS, Nashville:

The enemy was crossing in force a short distance this side of the Lewisburg pike at noon to-day, and had driven our cavalry back across the river and the pike at the some time. The force is reported to be infantry, but I do not regard it as very probable. Wilson had gone with hid main force to learn the facts, and drive the enemy back, if practicable.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.

NEAR COLUMBIA, TENN., November 28, 1864 - 4 p. m.

Major-General THOMAS:

If Hood advances on the Lewisburg and Franklin pike, where do you propose to fight him? I have all the force that is necessary here, and A. J. Smith's troops should be placed with reference to the proposed point of concentration.

Major General GEORGE H. THOMAS, Nashville, Tenn.:

I am informed the wagon bridge at Franklin has been carried away. Would it not be well to replace it by a pontoon bridge during the rainy season?

Major-General.
