constantly going on, and wounded were brought into the hospitals every hour. In the mean time the following circular had been received:

CIRCULAR.] HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,

May 22, 1864 - 9.15 a. m.

Instructions have been given to return all empty wagons now at Fredericksburg and Belle Plain Landing loaded, after which, so soon as the wounded are removed from Fredericksburg, that place and Belle Plain will be abandoned, and the depot will be established at Port Royal, on the Rappahannock.

By command of Major-General Meade:

S. WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

This circular was immediately sent to Dr. Dalton, with directions to have the purveyor's boats and barges transferred at once to Port Royal, and to send hospital tents and furniture as fast as they could be spared by the removal of wounded from Fredericksburg. On the 24th of May a train was organized for the purpose of conveying wounded from the field hospitals to Port Royal, Surg. A. J. Phelps, U. S. Volunteers, being placed in charge, with orders to proceed to Port Royal and superintendent the operations of the medical department at that place until Dr. Dalton should arrive. The number sent was as follows:

Corps.	 Sick.	 Wounded.	 Ambulances	 Wagons.

Second a	 157	 286	 2	 53

Fifth	 66	 225	 21	 53

Sixth	 68	 10	 19	 2

Total	 291	 521	 42	 108

a Including those left at Milford on the 22nd.

Army wagons were used to as great an extent as possible in this train, as a great battle seemed imminent, and it was desirable to keep every ambulance at the front. The wagons were bedded with boughs and blankets in the usual manner, and the customary detail of medical officers and nurses, with three days' rations and a supply of dressings and hospital stores were furnished. The train rendezvoused at Milford, near which point the main trains of the army were parked. A cavalry escort of 400 men accompanied it, and it reached Port Royal without molestation by dusk on the 25th. On the 26th of May an issue of rations was made to the troops, and the empty wagons thus obtained were used to remove sick and wounded to the rear, the field hospitals being thus emptied and ready for the movement to the Pamunkey on the 27th. The number sent was as follows:

Corps.	 Sick.	 Wounded.	 Ambulances	 Wagons.

Second	 88	 232	 2	 56

Fifth	 24	 114	 2	 44

Sixth	 49	 ---	 6	 4

Ninth	 101	 131	 30	 8

Total	 262	 477	 40	 112

This train was loaded by daybreak on the 27th, and moved directly to Port Royal, arriving at that place without hinderance before dark.
