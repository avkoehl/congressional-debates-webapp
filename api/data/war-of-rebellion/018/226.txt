Colonel MILES, Harper's Ferry:

Can you not send forward some scouts to Winchester and ascertain what the truth is? We are left in extraordinary state of uncertainty as to the real state of affairs, and think some pains should be taken to ascertain the real condition of things at Winchester.

Secretary of War.

Honorable SALMON P. CHASE, Aquia Creek:

General Fremont replied promptly that he would execute his order at once. Nothing heard from Banks since you started.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

WASHINGTON, May 24, 1862-11 a. m.

Major-General BANKS, Front Royal:

Your dispatch received. Have made urgent appeals for re-enforcements. Have just been before the President, Secretary of War, and Adjutant-General. Your letter and telegrams read and discussed. Explained your position and difficulties, and am directed to attend again this afternoon.

If the enemy possess the turnpike bridges at Front Royal you cannot hold Strasburg. Regret exceedingly that matters are so unpleasant. Will do all I can here. Great indignation manifested.

Respectfully, yours,

JOHN S. CLARK,

Colonel, Aide-de-Camp.
