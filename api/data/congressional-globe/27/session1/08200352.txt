Fiscal Bank—Mr. Hives.
Senate.
doxy In 1814, when the effort to obtain a re establishment of
a National Bank was first, formally renewed, after the unsuc
cessful struggle of 1811, the sub|ect came befme Co igresb on
a petition oía number of the citizens of New Yoik It wa^ re
ferred to the Committer of Way*, and Means oí the House of
Represent.uves, of which Mr Eppes a distinguished Repubh
can Representative from Viigima, was the chairman As
chairman of the committee, Mr Eppes i eportcd against thecon
stuutionahty oí the proposed Bank, and embodied the grounds
of that report M the following resolution, which, as setting forth
distinctly the principle on which ihe objections of the Repulí
lican party of that day to the constitutionality of a National
Bank rested, deserves particulai notice
'•■Resolved, That the powei to creatt corpoiat ns wi hin the
territorial limits of the States, without'heirconsi-rtt, is neither
oneof the powers delegated by the Coiistitution of tho United
State , nor essentially necessatyior carrying into effect any
delegated power "
It cannot fait to attract attention, that the terms of this re
solution, by an obnousand necessary implication, admitted the
Sower to create such a corporation as proposed, within the
'¡strict of Columbia
But this conclusion was not left to inference only Thedis
Unguished Senator from £outh Caiolma, [Mi Calhoun,] then
a distinguished member of the Houaeof Representatives moved
a recommitment of the report to the committee which brought
it in, With the avowed purpose of obtaining their repoitm la
vor of a National Rank in the District of Columbia—a repoit
Which was aecoidmgly afterwaids made As the honorible
gentleman seems frequently to susoect us on this side of the
Hoi se of a design to misrepresent him, I will give hi3 own
woids, as taken from the records of the dr>
"Ml Calhoun then said it would be found that the Co nmit
tee of Wa>sand Means had decided against the proposmoi on
the ground of unconstitutionally of establishing such a Bank
as that asked foi in the petition He wished to instruct the com
mittee to inquire into the exnediercy of establishing a National
Bmk within the District oí Columbia, thepowfrto do win h,
it could nothe doubled, came witnm the constitutional pow
era of Congress Foraíl piai tica! purpos s he believed such
a bank would be as useful as that which was pi oponed lo
eomtat his object Mr C piopnsed the following motion
"Hesolved, That the Committee of Wavs and Means oe m
structed toinqune into the expediency of establishing a Natío i-
al Bank, to be lot ated in the District of Celumbia "
This occurred duung the first session of the 1 íth Congiof s
At the succeeding session of tin «ame Oonseiesi the subject
wis resumed Mr Dallas in the mt an. time had become ie

that Congress does possess tho powei oí mcoipoiation in this

rhe constitutional power of Congress, then, to ir corporate a
Bank in ihe Dib net, f r the conveui nee and u^es of (he Go
veinment if deemed expedient is a power which has been re
cogmsfdand admitted by ail j a ties from tl ebnth of the Con
stnution down to the present day It h is be^n, tn an especial
manner admitted, and in terms the most unequivocal, by lead
mg and distinguished men of the Republican and Democialic
p mies, who have been most signalized for the zeal and earnest
ness ag well as abih y with which they have denied the General
power of Congrega to establish a National Bank withm the
limits of the States After this steady andunbroiien current of
testimony and opinion flowing through the com se of ha f a
century, it \vould --eem tobe in vain to call m question a power
thus vouched andsustamed Tne plan of the Secietarv of the
Treasuiy, then, so lai as the question of constitutional power is
involved in theincoipor ition of a Fiseal Bank of the TJn ed
States in this Distuct, may be safely assumed to re&t on mcon
tcbtab'e ground t
