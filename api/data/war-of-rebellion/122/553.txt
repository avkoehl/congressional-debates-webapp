HARRISBURG, October 1, 1861.

Honorable SIMON CAMERON,

Secretary of War:

I would recommend that Colonel Chantry's regiment be broken up to fill Lujeane and Rippey. Patrick could be made lieutenant-colonel of Lujeane's regiment and Freeman major of Ripley's. I hope to fill up and forward McLean, Gosline, and Chorman this week. I sent Colonel Christ from here to-day with a full regiment, armed and equipped.

A. G. CURTIN,

Governor.

Use your own discretion in filling up the organizations, and this Department will be satisfied. Glad to hear you are succeeding so well.

SIMON CAMERON,
