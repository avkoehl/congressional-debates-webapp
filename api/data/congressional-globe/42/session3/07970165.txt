Credit Mobilier—Mr. Swann.
Ho. of Reps.
of this great work. A bold man, firm and
decided in his purpose, with large pecuniary
resources, and with an outside influence
among business men and associates, promising
the most useful results in the business of con-
struction, his presence seemed to inspire for
the moment the drooping spirits of those who
had preceded him and who had proved want-
ing. The Credit Mobilier with its complicated
machinery was artfully interposed to keep the
Union Pacific road at a respectful distance, at
the same time that by a shifting process it
could be brought into relations of the most
perfect unity and accord. Superadded to this
was the construction committee which relieved
Mr. Ames of the labor of building the road,
and left nothing apparently for him to do but
to sign receipts for his dividends. Standing
remote from the scene of the more active oper-
ations guided by his hand, he watched with
interest the practical working of bis novel
machinery kept in motion by a board who
were ready to register his orders. Nothing
could have been better contrived to absorb
without hinderance the whole assets of the
Union Pacific railroad and all the powers of
its charter.
It was not long before the plans which had
been so ingeniously contrived began to develop
their results. Quietly awaiting the effect of his
masterly contract, success at length dawned
upon the great founder of the Credit Mobilier.
The golden shower commenced falling in June,
1868, and continued with slight interruptions
until the profits amounted to at least seven
hundred and fifty per cent., and it is believed
much more. In a suit now pending, in which
J. W. Davies is plaint iff vs. The Union Pacific
Railroad Company, in the United States dis-
trict court of the first judicial district of the
Territory of Wyoming, within and for the
county of Laramie, the following is found
among other proceedings:
"Resolution of Mr. Suahnell.
"'That as soon as owners of full paid stook in
Union Pacific Railroad Company shall assent to
Oakes Ames's contract, in writing, a division shall bo
made to stockholders of CreditMobilier of America,
say sixty cents in first mortgage bonds of Union
Pacific Railroad Company and sixty cents in Onion
Pacific railroad stock.
"' Resolution adopted/
"Andyouroratorfurthershowetk unto your honor,
that thereafter from time to time other resolutions
of like import were passed by said defendants, the
precise terms and dates thereof being to your orator
unknown.
" That under and in pursuance of the said several
resolutions, dividends wero made amounting in the
aggregate to seven liundrcd and fifty por cottr. upon
the amount invested in such enterprise, as your ora-
tor is informed and believes. That on the 7th day
of June, 1868, a dividend or dividends were made,

"And your orator further showeth unto your honor
that the stockholders of the said Credit Mobilier of
America were persons in official and confidential re-
lations with said railroad company, and that when
the said seven defendants made said payments to
the other, the said stockholders, they exacted from
them a receipt," &c.
Of these enormous dividends Hon. Oakes
Ames received $366,562 ; Oliver Ames, his
brother, $877,500; and T. C. Durant $1,060,-
875.
These dividends were subsequently increased
from time to time, to what extent never can
be accurately known. Those who claim to
speak advisedly upon the subject, estimate the
individual profits of Mr. Ames at not less than
$1,000,000, which I should feel safe in placing
at more than double that amount; and others
associated with him in the same proportion.
When we take the assets which were known
to have come into the hands of this company,
the amount expended in the construction of
the roads, and the balance remaining on
hand, there must have been a large surplus to
be distributed.
I have labored in vaiu, Mr. Speaker, to ascer-
tain from some of the parties themselves, the
actual net profits growing out of the contract
with the Credit Mobilier, attaching to Mr.
Oakes Ames individually upon the interest
which lie claimed to have represented in that
concern ; but have been thwarted in the mass
of conflicting testimony which the committee
have had to deal with. It cannot be doubted,
how vor, that these profits have been greater
than ever attached to any similar railroad in
this or any other country ; and that they have
been brought about by a willful disregard of
the provisions of the charter under which
they acted, a reckless expenditure of the
public money, and a fraudulent sacrifice of
assets which belonged to this Government,
and which were specifically pledged for the
construction of the road.
In fact, Mr. Speaker, looking at the extra-
ordinary developments connected with the
origin and progress of this work, I have been
reluctantly brought to the conclusion that the
whole scheme from the beginning was con-
ceived in fraud, and has been so conducted,
without the remotest recognition of any con-
trolling power for good, or the existence of
any chartered rights on the part of the Gov-
ernment. This has been manifest in the loose
and unprecedented manner in which the work
has drifted along under the machinery which
these men have thought proper to inaugurate,
having no precedent in railroad construction
or management.
From the introduction of the Credit Mo-
bilier, and the contract with Mr. Oakes Ames
and those who have acted as his agents and
advisers, we date the series of frauds which
subsequently became a part of a grand system
in the management of the funds of the Gov-
ernment. The large subsidies held out in the
donation of lands and the liberal offers of its
credit by the Government, besides the favor-
able features of the Union Pacific railroad
charter, made it a temptation such as rarely
occurs, conceding all that may be claimed on
the score of patriotic service and the im-
pulses of an enlarged public spirit, involving
Tieavy risks at a time when the nation was
engaged in a perilous war, and was sorely
at fault in the facilities of transportation
both for the movements of troops and the
munitions of war. There is still enough left,
and more than enough, to satisfy me that the
novel and cunning manner in which this road
was managed, and the barefaced attempts at
concealment and indirection governing their
policy, carry with them the evidence of fraud,
which demand at the hands of this House the
enforcement of all the equities provided for
in the charter, and the reimbursement of the
Government for the losses, counting by mil-
lions, sustained by its violation, under which
these men profess to have acted, in the misdi-
rection of funds which were dedicated to the
exclusive purposes of this road, and the ulti-
mate protection of the Government against
loss by its substantia* and thorough construc-
tion.
It will appear by the record of evidence con-
tained in this report that this road was subject
to a management hitherto unknown in the past
experience of similar enterprises in this coun-
try or any other, and planned with a view to
conceal the abuses of its managers; and fur-
ther, as will appear by the record, large
sums of money were disbursed from time to
time without the knowledge or sanction of the
board, in many instances never satisfactorily
accounted for; that the Government charter
was made to conform to the interests of men
who were acting without reference to, and in
contempt of, the obligations under which it
was accepted ; that bribes were attempted on
frequent occasions to influence legislation and
for other similar purposes; that engineers were
commanded to modify estimates, deliberately
made up, with a view to increase the cost of
construction and mislead those who were par-
ties in interest; that subordinate officers, with-
out hinderance or protest, were permitted to
use the money of the corporation in large
amounts, to secure the favorable action of the
Government in accepting what were repre-
sented as finished contracts, but which were
known to have been passed upon false, incom-
plete, and distorted estimates; that largo
gratuities in the shape of stock or other avail-
able assets were voted by this board to secure
the good will and influene of retired officers
whose services were deemed to be useful, and
whose good will was important; that dividends
of what purported to be net profits were made
from time to time when the road was in debt,
and unable legitimately to meet even its float-
ing obligations.
There seems to have been no direct account-
ability and no recognized subordination among
the officers and agents who had charge of this
work at the time when the Ames dynasty com-
menced. Every one appeared to be acting on
his own responsibility and watching oppor-
tunities to enrich themselves or their friends
at the expense of the common Treasury. In-
stances will be found in this record where
important resolutions, involving large appro-
priations of money, have been passed, and the
results of such action left to be discovered by
the more quiet members of the board, who
assumed to justify their ignorance bya boasted
confidence in the general honesty of their col-
leagues and their desire not to know too much
about what was transpiring lest it should not
turn out as they desired.
Let me here, Mr. Speaker, for the informa-
tion of the House, go into a little more detail
of some of the acts embodied in the report,
showing the utter recklessness with which the
business of this road was conducted, and the
many instances of the most startling frauds
and abuse which were either winked at or per-
mitted to go unpunished.
Mr. Ames was backed by men of the most un-
doubted talent and shrewdness, upon whom
he implicitly pinned his faith. His brother,
and confidential partner and adviser, was an
intelligent, cool, and deliberate man, fully
equal to the mastery of the weighty complica-
