It is probable that for the four years it would average 50,000 per annum.

There are in captivity some 55,000 of our troops, and the permanently disabled probably amount to 50,000.

OUR AVAILABLE MEN.

The following calculations in reference to the available military strength of certain States of the Confederacy are based upon the census report of 1850. The States in regard to which statistics have been omitted are either wholly or chiefly within the enemy's power and can scarcely be considered open to the introduction of any conscription law or organized system or recruiting:

TABLE 1. -White males between the ages of fifteen and fifty in the year 1850.

States. 	 Whites. 	 Males between 15

 	 and 50.

Virginia	 894,800	 212,686

North Carolina	 553,028	 125,851

South Carolina	 274,563	 64,313

Georgia	 521,572	 120,262

Florida	 47,203	 12,750

Alabama	 426,514	 101,746

Mississippi	 295,718	 73,450

Total	 3,013,398	 711,058

It appears from this that the male population between the ages of fifteen and fifty in the above-named States comprised in 1850 seven-thirtieths of their entire population. Upon the supposition that this is a constant ratio is based the estimate of the number of males between the ages of fifteen and fifty in 1860, as contained in the following table.

The State populations in Table No. 2 are taken from newspaper extracts from the unpublished census in 1860, and are official.
