No changes observed on our front. About 9 or 9.30 p. m. sharp picket-firing, with some cannonading, was heard directly north of these headquarters. It must have been on the other side of Appomattox. General Willcox reports at that time no firing on his front.

The firing is almost due north of us. By the interval between the flash and report, I make it about twelve miles distant. I suppose at or near Dutch Gap.

Brigadier-General RAWLINS,

City Point:

The right of General Ferrero's picket-line, which rests on the James just below the Howlett House Battery, was attacked last night. The attack was repulsed. A deserter reported to General Ferrero that the object was to ascertain if the obstructions in the river been carried away. Small boats in readiness to co-operate in case the attack succeeded. The attempt was to have been made on Saturday night, but the small boats were not ready. Eight guns and ten hats were picked up this morning at the point were the attack was made. Every precaution has been taken to prevent a surprise.
