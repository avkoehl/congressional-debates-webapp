allowed to the ban' s ft t h" r ir ible and risk, bn'
as the committee haü no i ¡l  n.ation a  to ihe rat 
of commission which it would be bife for Congres*
to fix as a maximum, and not incur the danger of so
limiting this compensation as to induce the banks
to reiuse the deposite  altogether, they have reported
the bill in blank in this respect
These provisions, it would be seen, were verj
close, and it had been suggested, as well by some
oí the friends, as by the opponents of the bill, that
they were so close as to render it possible, if not
probable, that the banking institutions would reject
them on that account, upon the ground that they
earned upon their face a distrust ot the solvency
and itsponiibihty of the institutions, or of the inte-
grity ot iheir officers and managers, 01 both He
would detain the Senate a few moments to exa-
mine these objection";, and, fast, if he understood
the matter, and the law of the case, the idea of
distrust as to the «solvency and responsibility of the
banks, arising from these provisions, seemed to him
to be a forced and unnatural inference If such an
idea could glow out of any part ol them, it must
be that part giving to the Secretary of the Treasuiy
a d sorction to furnish safes for the exclusive keep-
ing of Ihe public money, to be under the joint
contiol of the bank and an ofticei ot the Govern
ment This would eonstitule the deposite entuely
special, and, as he understood the law, the bank
would not be responsible forsuüi a deposite bejond
the obligation ot ordinary care and vigilance in its
safe-keeping In the incidents of proptity, respon-
sibility and risk, tlieie \> as scarce!} a, resemblance
between a uiposite oi this character, and a general,
open deposite In the latter, the property is
changed the moment the deposite is made The
money becomes the absomte property of the built
as much as its onn capital, and the Government
receives its tied t, or promise to pay, in its certifi-
cate of denosite, in exchange fo. the money No
mattei, then, how ihe money be lost, if it be !o«t,
the indebtedness of the institution upon its certifi-
cate is not changed tberebj, nor can it be di&
charged by any act of the debtor other than pay-
ment In such deposites, therefore, the solvency
and responsibility of the bank becomes the first
subject of inquiry and examination for the deposi-
tor Not so in cisos of spa ill deposite Thei
the pre pel ly is lift changed, the specific thing depo-
sited temains l' e \ . iperi} ot the dep sitoi If it be
money,it vvo.ild be a vn I in n ol the 11« , and rules
o! the deposite, fir ihe trnk to exchange it, foi any
purpose, for the same amount of inoney ot an ex-
actly si miar character It is the identity of the
article, and the pi >perty in it, which gives it the
chancier of a special deposite, and if that article
be converted by the bank, although instantly re-
placed bj an exactly similar article m every respect,
th  identity and property are both gone, and the
option ot the depositor alone must determine
whether his indemnity shall be the responsibility of
the insulation m the article tendered in exchange
Hence the different I alilities of the bank jn the
two cas  In the fiisi, u purchases the money
with its i relit, an 1 thus contracts a debt vvhich it
3s unconditio iMIy 1 ible to pa\ in the second, it
derives no pr ¡ ertj tiom ihe deposite, and is a
simple bailee, w.'h or without compensation, as its
contract of demesne sh ill determine, but, m either
case, only Inble in case oi want of ordinary pare
and vigilance m the Hat-keeping or toe thing en-
tiosted to its keeping
In the provisions for the special deposites provi-
ded for, therefore, the Goveinmentonly proposes to
hire the secunty of the vaults and safes of the
banks, for the keeping of its money, and the ordi-
nal} care and vigilance of it0 officers, in guarding
ft while there Beyond these, it has nothing to do
with tne capital, solvency, or responsibility of the
institutions How, tren, cm it be supposed that
the pioyisions are intended to cairy distrust upon
t leir face against the solvency and responsibility
of the banks1 If the vaults be safe, and the inte-
grity of the officers, their vigilance and care, tnal
and known, an insolvent 1 >nk is as safe a place
for a special deposite as a solvent o íe, a banK un-
able to pay i's debt', as a bank abundant in its
means beyond its liabilities Either can k<=ep as
safely and faithfully the property of another, placed
I in in vaults, w hile the ceditois of neither can avul
themse.ves ot a sp cial deposite, whatever it ma/
be, w itho u thi «ixsenl and aid ol the officer  of the
instituí on Ho'i unnecessaiy, thereiote, to de-
cíate distrust njion the face ot a law, when almost
al1 interest in the just grounds for that feeling is
put at i est by the nature and charactei of Ihe depo-
site to be madei And how unnatural to infer such
distrust from language which does not necessarily
convey it, when the character of the contract pro-
posed to be made does not require the inference
It v as further alleged that the provisions conven-
ed imputation against the integrity of the officers
and managers of tne banks, and that, therefore,
they would not contract with the Secretary of the
rr<Msui> for the deposites proposed Was this a
fan construction ol the provisions of the bill'
Was it an improper or ungenerous distiust of the
integrity of those u ho had the management of these
institutions, and the caie and custody of the pro-
peity placed in 'heir chaige, to set guards over their
conduit' What did the bill propose in leferenceto
the oil cci s u ho w ere to be entrusted with the safc-
kup na ol the public money? They were requned,
not  oil\   to «no   bonds for the faithful perfor-
ii.uice ol ilien nusi, bin a bleach of that trust, in
the use of ihe mone), foi investments, loans, or in
ny nber minner whatsoever, was declared a
crime «huh should subject the peipetrator to in-
dictment xn{ niuunojs pjmslumnt, to protracted
personal impns mment, and to a fine equal to the
mi ney embez/kd, ind, consequently, to perpetual
dis race ami infamy Was thu a suggestion,
upon Ihe face of these provisions, of distiust of
fie lion siv an 1 integiity ol these officers? Was
even honest and nonviable citizen of the countiy
bound to leject these offices, when tendered to
them because the ¡aw under which they must net,
in prov idw,i penalties for their misconduct, or
guards against it, coiuejed to the public a distrust
of then integnl}? Had any statesman ever sup-
posed that, in n lining penalties and punishments in
a Jaw for violations ol ofiicial duty or official tiust,
he v as drawing out imputations against the inte-
grity and tiiistviorihmess of the ofiicers who weie
to hold plaus undei nt He could not so sup-
pose. He could nut subseiibe to this do< trine, and
he would ask i( mc rpoiations, incoiporeal ex-
istences, wer* to oi treated more delicately, in our
legisla n>n, ihan that class of citizens who would
b- selected by the President, and approved by the
Smite, fir high ind responsible public trusts'! All
must answer no, and, so answering, all mustconccde
that there «as no foundation fer this objection to
the piovisions Incorporitions conld not be sub-
jecled to indictment and punishment, as there was
no real person upon whom ihe punishment could
be mflic ted. This check cuuld not be imposed upon
then officers and agents, because it would be im-
possible to deterinu c who was guilt} in form only,
md who in fací, «hi n every act must be that of
an agent who mi) have io discretion If, then,
physicil risiuints arj inteiposed as to these msti
unions, to accomplish the ends which are reached
by pcail enacimints m ihe ca'e of natural per-
sons, is tne < ffinre io delicacy oi iirling, the af-
front to honor <r inreguty, greater in the fo ner
ca>.e than in tne latter' He could not see that it
wa and he must think that bothofthese objections
displaced a deg'ce of over-wi ought sensibility to-
wards i íe bankine ir titution-. of the country which
tlip r sagacious managers would see should not
govern their conduct.
There was a smslf other view of this subject
which lie must oresent, and he would pass on to
otliei provisions of Ihe bill It was the intention
ol the cornrnittf e, who crew and reported the bill,
to mike these deposites s icil} spe i il to prevem
the banks from any use ( f the money deposited,
and he believed th  provi ions to whirh he had rt-
feired, if faithfnl!> executed, would accomplisn
that intention If the banks should leceive the
morey, unde this unde standing, and with an in-
tention on ihe r part to car-y it out in go' d faith,
what would be Ineir true interest m tins matter'
Would .t not b to have their power to Use th"
money placed beyond question? To have physical
disabilities interposed between them and that po -
tion of the public treasure committed to their
Senate.
(liaigri Observation and experience must, al-
ready, have taught them that the distrustful eye of
public opinion follows the public treasure, and, un-
le s the most efficient guarcls are provided by the
Government, and assented to by the banks, will
not the most injurious suspicions of a breach of
their tiustbe likely to rest upon them'' Ought they
not, for their own indemnity, to desire that the use
of these moneys should be placed beyond their
power? And will they not have some just reason
to apprehend that objections on their part may give
use to suspicions as to their disposition faithfully
to execute the trust in conformity with its inten-
tions'!
The fifteenth and sixteenth spctioHS piovided
checks upon the various depositaries constituted bv
the bill The first authorized the Secietaiy of the
Treasuiy to appoint special agents, whenevei he
may find it necessary, to inspect the books, ac-
counts, money on hand, and other business of any
depositary. The principal object of this sect.on,
as he understood that object, was to enable the Se-
cretary, whenevei the returns of the officer, in-
formation communicated by third peisons, or any
other information, should authorize a suspicion
that all was not right with any one of the officers
entrusted with the safe-keeping of public monev,
to appoint some competent citizen, as a spec al
agent, to present himself, unexpectedly, with autho-
rity to examine the- official transact ons of the offi-
cei, to detect and correct error, if error should be
found to exist, to expose fraud and bung the offi-
cer to punishment, in case dishonesty should be de-
tected, md to justify innocence, if suspected with-
out foundation It was true, the section made
these eliminations compulsory, at long intervals
of one yen, in cases where the amounts collected
ustitlly exieededa just proportion to the amount
secured b} the boi d of the officer, but this part ot
the section he c nsidered of much less impoi tance
thin that he hail before noticed He considered
its principal unlit) to exist in the authority to ap-
point an agent unknown to the officsi, and who
might come upon him in an unprepared state If
the agent were to be one permanently appointed,
and publicly known, one whom the officer might
watch and guard himself against, he should con-
sidei it not worth retaining He was aware that,
in its present shape, it was objectionable to some of
Ihe fnends ol the bill, and, with this exposition, he
submitted its adoption oi rejection to the sense of
the Senate It was an exact transcript of a sec-
tion contained in the bid which passed the body at
th? extra session, and as it was inserted upon the
suggesium of the head oí the Treasurj Depart-
ment, he presumed the suggestion had proceeded
(r im a similar provision contained in the laws
which legulatp the Post Office Department, and
which had been of great use in detecting frauds
connected with the extended operations of that
Dipartment, but should it be thought that such a
provision would not be beneficial, as connected with
this bill, he shon'd not consider its removal as ma-
nually marine tne s> stem intended tobo consti-
tuted
Ihe sixteenth «section made it the duty of the
snrvpjors. of the customs, naval officers, registers
of the land offices, directors of the mints, anc«
some other o beers, at the expiration of each quar-
ter, to examine into, and icport to thf Secretaiy < f
the Treasury, the state of the accounts, and mone 
on hand, of the depositaries in their districts', oi
immediate e >nnc-tion These were checks ob-
tame 1 through the msirumentalily of existing offi-
cer , weie whollj wuhout expense to the public,
wou'd evide uly be of material service, as guar Is
upo i the iVpisitir.es, aid a> coiiinbutmg to a unt-
1 >rim'\ an J sj <tn m *h° k ep,n<r ot the accoun s
of tin sc officns, and he presumed wojld meet with
no objection fiom any quaitcr
He would pass now to the twentieth section
which required every officer, charged with the keep-
ing of public money, to keep an accurate account
of the kinds of money received and paid out, the
object of which was to prevent these officers, vv ab-
out detection, from receiving and pajmg out to the
public creditors a depreciated currency, and also
I rom making exchanges ot the currency received
m a manner which should be injurious to the pub-
