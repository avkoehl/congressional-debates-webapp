THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
June 12,
fleet'with "all the equipments of war, threatening
to strike upon the instant, while a formidable and
#ell-appowted army in the Canadas even now
keeps watch upon the long line of our lake front-
ier. We are living in an age when the political
elements oftheOldand New World are in commo-
tion. A conflict between the principles and policy
of the mysterious man who presides Over the
destinies of France—it may be said, of Europe—
and those of the British empire, threatens a crisis
by which the United States, as a commercial na-
tion, would be drawn into the vortex. With dis-
turbing causes at home,and threatening relations
abroad, are we to remain passive in regard to a
measure so essential to our protection*, nay, even
necessary to the preservation of our territory?
Senators, there is a serious responsibility rest-
ing at the door of inaction and delay. Should
foreign war come, our western ocean frontier of
nearly a thousand miles will be found walled out
by the.Rocky mountains, the Sierra Nevada, and
the Cascades. Months would be required before
an army could give relief overland. By sea, Pana-
ma, Nicaragua,and Tehuantepec would be closed
by hostile fleets, and feeble and ineffectual com-
munication could only be kept up, a distance of
seventeen thousand miles, around Cape Horn.
We ask not to be dealt with as a broken or dis-
membered part of this great empire, but that our
unity with the eastern half of tne American con-
tinent be maintained by the means which the na-
tion can so easily command. Our people are true
to the cause of the Union; every sympathy, re-
mote as we are from the central authority, is
linked to the Government of our fathers, under
which we hope to live, and in defense of which
we are prepared to die.
Such arc the imperious reasons which force me
to urge the favorable action of the Senate; and in
warntng you of the imminent necessity for instant
and efficient legislation, it is my duty to solemnly
protest that further delay is fraught with perils
to the integrity of our territory, and may end m
dismemberment and ruin!
Senators, we turn with pleasure from such an
eventuality, we hope impossibility, to the con-
templation of results, the guarantees for which
are to be found in your love of country and de-
votion to all her interests. In this season of do-
mestic turbulence we derive satisfaction from the
conviction that all attempts at disintegration must
necessarily be abortive; that the present is con-
sequently an unnatural state of tilings, from which
the deluded portion of our people will recover as
from the delirium of a fever; that our normal con-
dition isunity; that common language, laws.line-
age, blended interests, industrial, social, and polit-
ical, love of freedom, of representative Govern-
ment, are moving, controlling causes, in fact, the
great elements of order and power, which will
hush into silence the clashing discord of the hour,
and restore the reign of peace and prosperity.
Our domestic struggle has not been without its
benefits; it has developed new ideas in respect to
military and naval strength in the United States,
furnishing examples which tell upon the policy
and bearing of rival nations. In this struggle a
million of men at arms have entered the field, fully
equipped with all the modern improvements of
war, while capacity exists for the rally of a four-
fold number, should necessity require, for the pro-
tection of our firesides and altars.
It has further been demonstrated that the pre-
existing system of naval defense and attack is en-
tirely inadequate and unreliable. In one maritime
war the prowess and skill of our Navy appeared
in successful dispute for ocean supremacy. Now
we have launched upon the deep steel-clad war-
riors of such model and power as to mock and
'defy those " wooden walls" once the boast and
glory of proud maritime Powers. The ability of
our Government for the rapid construction and
multiplication of these new iron engines of naval
strength is such as to enable us to place invinci-
ble sentinels at the doors of our harbors in the
Atlantic, the Gulf, the great lakes, and in the
Pacific.
And when the reigri of peace comes, as soon it
must, lesults will demonstrate the entire compe-
tency of this Government to maintain and fur-
ther, m a spirit of justice, all the varied interests
committed to its charge, while the power shall be
established and conceded to maintain its extended
peaceful*&nd p&ient&l rule from ocean to ocean.
