CHARLESTON, S. C., July 31, 1863.

J. M. BROOKE,

Richmond, Va.:

Do not understand your telegram. President's letter to Governor Bonham seems to place the triple-banded gun at my disposal. The Charleston cannot be officered, manned, and commissioned for a long time to come. Your guns on her would, therefore, be of no more use in defense of this city than if retained in Richmond. Efficiency of gunboats here might be much increased if made to use their long-range guns with greater elevation, whereas now their maximum range is 1 1/2 miles; hence they have not yet been able to take part in defense of Charleston.

G. T. BEAUREGARD,

General, Commanding.
