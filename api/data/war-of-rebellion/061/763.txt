propose to move at daylight. I send with this orders to Colonel Ritter to move at daylight. The road is good; there are two small creeks to cross; bottoms narrow (a few yards wide), but may (probably will) require some work. The crossing here is covered with water, and promises to last well. Lieutenant Porter places but little confidence in the prisoner's statement, but I feel satisfied that a considerable part of the enemy's force has got between us and Camden. The remainder may be camped to-night on the upper crossing of the White Oak, in which case we will be before them at the junction in the morning.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

SIR: Colonel Ritter's brigade has just returned. It went 8 1/2 miles beyond Princeton; found and heard of no rebels except that people said at Princeton on the 19th that Marmaduke was crossing and coming upon our line of communications. Captain Bunner left the command on the 19th, with the dispatches and 9 men for Pine Bluff; expected to be obliged to swim the Saline. Colonel Ritter is sick, and his dismounted men are much fatigued, some of their feet being raw. He heard indefinite rumors of the train through the country people, but did not know it had come on. An old man, just through from Little Rock, said that there were no rebels on the road.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

E. A. CARR,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

HEADQUARTERS CAVALRY DIVISION, April 27, 1864-10 a.m.

SIR: I have stopped at a point about 13 miles from Princeton and 16 miles from the camp I left this morning. There are two or three small spring branches here; good spring half a mile back of me. There is said to be 1,500 bushels of corn 2 1/2 miles from here, off the road. I would be glad to be notified of the time the infantry will move and will try to get out of the way. I have not traveled so far as I expected on account of the slowness of the start and the slowness of the march during the darkness.

Very respectfully,E. A. CARR,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

Lieutenant G. O. SOKALSKI,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.

No enemy seen or heard of.
