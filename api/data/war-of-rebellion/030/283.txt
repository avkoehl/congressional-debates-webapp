MUNFORDVILLE, December 31, 1862.

Lieutenant-Colonel GARESCHE:

Information just in reports Forrest within 30 miles of Elizabethtown, with a force of 10,000. We have sent out to ascertain truth of report. If true, I should like to have another brigade of my command join me at Rolling Fork, leaving one brigade at Gallatin. Let me know immediately whether it can be. The troops in Kentucky are not sufficiently concentrated to operate efficiently against the force of the enemy supposed to be here.

SPEED S. FRY,

[Brigadier-General.]

MUNFORDVILLE, December 31, 1862.

Major-General ROSECRANS:

Reliable scouts report that Colonel [General] Forrest, with 5,000 cavalry, encamped at Stevensburg, 10 miles from Elizabethtown. From information gathered on the route, I believe this to be true. Forrest's friends report that Forrest is the advance of Breckinridge's division, 40,000 strong.
