Brigadier-General DENNIS,

Commanding Second Division:

GENERAL: The general commanding directs that you delay your departure until Colonel Sheldon and Lieutenant-Colonel Crebs have embarked their commands. It will also be necessary to await the arrival of the gun-boat which is to act as your convoy. If there is room on any of your boats for more horses, you will send them down to this landing without delay for the transportation of the animals of the Eighty-seventh Illinois Mounted Infantry.

Very respectfully,

B. WILSON,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

ASSISTANT ADJUTANT-GENERAL, SECOND DIV., 19TH ARMY CORPS:

CAPTAIN: This morning I received orders from Brigadier-General McGinnis, commanding Third Division, to embark three regiments of my command for the purpose of taking part in an impending expedition, and to report to Brigadier-General Dennis. So far as my command is concerned, it will soon be ready to move, but some cavalry are to go in my boats, and they seem not to be ready. I have been unable to find the commanding officer for the last two hours, and cannot push toward the loading of this things. My headquarters are on the transport Ohio Belle. I await the pleasure of the general.

I have the honor to be, your obedient servant,

L. A. SHELDON,

Colonel, Commanding.

Respectfully returned.

Not having received any orders in regard to your command accompanying the expedition, I have no orders to give in the matter. Perhaps it would be well to mention the matter to General Lawler.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

WM. E. KUHN,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
