Major General F. P. BLAIR,

Commanding Seventeenth Army Corps:

GENERAL: Our headquarters are at this point. The Fifteenth Crops, instead of being at the place indicated in the order of march, will be near Flat Rock. The general wishes you to get one division as far as Russell Place if possible; the other divisions as far as Liberty Hill, as in case a rain should come on it will be very difficult to get over the road. There is a good from Russell Place to Flat Rock Post-Office.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

A.m. VAN DYKE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HDQRS. DEPARTMENT AND ARMY OF THE TENNESSEE,Patterson's Cross-Roads, February 23, 1865.

Major General F. P. BLAIR,

Commanding Seventeenth Army Corps:

GENERAL: Your note by Colonel Hickenlooper is just received. I only wished you to get your head of column to Russells Place. You did have an independent road after getting to Liberty Hill, and your road is independent all the way to Young's Bridge. There was but one road that I could find between the bridge and Liberty Hill. To-morrow if you will make Williams' Cross-Roads, near Copelan's, I will be satisfied. Please take one section of the bridge train along with you and allow the other to come straight to Flat Rock. The roads are good after reaching the table-land; that is, good before the train. There is no haste, as I find it will take all day to-morrow for the Left Wing to get across the Wateree. Headquarters to-morrow night will be at lower Williams' Cross-Roads.

Respectfully,

O. O. HOWARD,

Major-General.

SPECIAL ORDERS, HDQRS. SEVENTEENTH ARMY CORPS, Numbers 50. Liberty Hill, S. C., February 23, 1865.

The movement to-morrow will be via Russell Place and Copeland's in the direction of Young's Bridge.
