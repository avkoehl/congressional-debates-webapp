THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

iVe franchise. If our adopted citizens are re-
quired to undergo a five years' probation before
they.can vote, 'with how much greater force may
the objection be applied to those who never read
or wrote a line, and perhaps were never off the
plantation on which they were born. The body
has been emancipated, but time alone can burst
the chains of mental bondage.
But, sir, I now turn to the other branch of
the subject. Let those who idolize the negro,-
care, for the object of their idolatry as best they
may. I intend here to look after the welfare
Of another race, commonly called white men.
Do not let us exhaust all our sympathy on an
inferior rac;e. There is legislation before us
that demands our earnest consideration and
frompt attention. How stands the account
etwixt us and the remnant of that noble band
tfeough whom the national life was preserved
and the negro emancipated? I answer, it is
largely against us on the score of justice and
humanity. What have we done for the mu-
tilated men who go about our streets upon
crutches, with empty sleeves, and entirely dis-
abled and unfit for active labor 1 Nothing, ab-
solutely nothing. Sir, four years ago, the men
who composed the Union Army sprang to their
arms upon the first intimation that the Repub-
lic was in danger, and generously imperiled
their lives, for, they loved their country. They
left comfortable and happy homes to endure the
pains and privations of the field. Time flew
on. The brave "boys in blue" fought man-
fully, and through their efforts, thank God, the
Union has been preserved. Sir, this is not all.
Awuy upon the many fields of strife countless
thousands of these brave and gallant men now
sleep the last sleep of death. Martyrs to lib-
erty, they died nobly in the cause of freedom,
and now rest from their labors in the sweet re-
pose of the, silent tomb.
" On fame's eternal camping ground
Their silent tents are spread,
And glory guards with solemn round
The bivouac of the dead.''
' Alas 1 we can only extend to them the tribute
of grMeful memories-. To those who yet sur-
vive, mangled and mutilated as they are, how
changed the scene 1 Those once happy homes
are cheerless and lonely; where once all was
peace and comfort and happiness, there now
only remain destitution, poverty, and want.
The stately mansion and the lowly cabin alike
share the common fate. The somber weed, the
blanched face, and the feeble gait, indicate too
surely the presence of " a stricken fold." This
is the melancholy picture ; let it be ours to sur-
round it With the framework of appropriate
legislation. I am sure that He who " tempers
the wind to the shorn lamb" now calls upon us
to cheer the lonely and the comfort less, and
with the outpourings of grateful hearts let us
extend to our brave defenders the fragrant in-
cense of a nation's praise. Sir, I' have done.

Whereas f.cvera.1 citizens of Dakota Territory have

currence; and whereas the hostile bands of Indians
known as the Sisscton, Wah-pa-ton, Medawakanton,
and Wah-pa-koota bands of Dakota Indians were,

railroad communication with the west.
Mr. WILLIAMS. I ask unanimous consent
to submit the following preamble and resolu-
tion, and to have them considered at this time:
Whereas it is the interest of this Government that
the means of communication between its metropolis
and the scat of its power in the great West should be
as direct and immediate as the topography of the in-
tervening country will allow; and whereas it is repre-
sented that tlio route indicated by the Father of his
Country as the most obvious and practicable for the
establishment of this connection between the eastern
sea-board and the great valley of the Mississippi, of
which the prospective necessity was present to bis far -
seeing eye, has been obstructed by hostile State legis-
lation in the interest of a rival corporation of the
State of Pennsylvania: Therefore,
Renohed, That it be referred to a special committee
of nine members, to be appointed by the Chair, to in-
quire whether the commercial, postal, or military ne-
cessities of the country require the construction of a
continuous line of railroad between the seat of Gov-
ernment and the great States and Territories of the
West and Northwest, so as to reach the head-waters
of the Ohio river by the most direct and practicable
route; how lunch still remains to be done to establish
and complete such connection: whether any obstacles
have been interposed by the Legislatures of the State
or States through which the same would pass, and what
means are within the powers of Congress to remove
such obstacles, if any, and to facilitate the construc-
tion of such a road as the wants of the Government or
the convenience of the traveling and trading public
may require, with leave to report by bill or otherwise.
Mr. BOYER objected.
^ And then, on motion of Mr. THAYER, (at
