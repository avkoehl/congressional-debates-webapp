side, but not from both. If you do not object, I would, therefore, suggest that the fire of your batteries be resumed on Sumter with full vigor to-morrow, as a proper precaution.

DAHLGREN,

Admiral.

MORRIS ISLAND, August 29, 1863-11.30 p.m.

Admiral DAHLGREN:

Can you spare me some 200-pounder shells? My supply is very low. A constant fire on Sumter is more than my guns can stand very long. I have lost three 200-pounders.

GILLMORE,

General.

OFF MORRIS ISLAND, August 29, 1863-11.35 p.m.

General GILLMORE:

Much obliged. All your fire on Sumter materially lessens the great risk I incur.

DAHLGREN,

Admiral.

OFF MORRIS ISLAND, August 29, 1863-11.50 p.m.

General GILLMORE:

I will let you have either guns or projectiles, as many as you wish, if you will inform me how much you require.

DAHLGREN,

Admiral.

MORRIS ISLAND, August 30, 1863-7.45 p.m.

Admiral DAHLGREN:

Your coal can be landed at Stono, or in Light-House Inlet, which you please. The water is better at Stono.

I will light up Cumming's Point to-night, if you have no objections.

GILLMORE,

General.

OFF MORRIS ISLAND, August 30, 1863-8.45 p.m.

General GILLMORE:

It is so rough that I shall not move up with the monitors to-night. Your lighting up Cumming's Point with your calcium lights will not interfere with my movements. Is it true that the enemy is strengthening Cumming's Point?

DAHLGREN,

Admiral.
