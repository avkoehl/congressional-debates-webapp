Remarks on the District of Georgia: I will be enabled shortly to give (as now being collected from actual inspection) the exact number of guns of all descriptions in the District of Georgia, with a statement of their precise location. The guns in Georgia as per information received April 27, 1864, far exceed the within (made on reports of old date, in which the " lines" then unfinished were not included). They amount in the aggregate to 210.
