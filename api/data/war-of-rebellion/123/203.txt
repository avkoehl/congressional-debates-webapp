pay, the State will make the advance, take an assignment from the volunteer, and look to the Government to reimburse the State when the regiment is mustered. This might occasion a little loss to the Government from a few who might enlist but fail to be mustered, but the facility it would give to mustering would more than compensate for such loss. I think the Secretary of War better write authorizing me to pay the month's pay when the volunteer is enlisted.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

CHS. S. OLDEN.

WAR DEPARTMENT,

Washington City, D. C., July 3, 1862.

Governor HOLBROOK,

Brattleborough, Vt.:

Please send your new regiment here immediately. We will give them on their arrival here the Springfield musket, which I understand they prefer.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

BRATTLEBOROUGH, July 3, 1862-6 p. m.

E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

Cannot send Ninth Regiment immediately as you request, because the delay introduced by change of mustering and disbursing office. Without the change regiment could have left next Monday. With it there will be delay of week or more. Before regiment leaves the officers of companies must be settled with for recruiting and subsisting of men, so they can settle and pay what they owe for assistance. When we undertook to raise you troops we did not expect this embarrassment.

FREDK. HOLBROOK.

MADISON, WIS., July 3, 1862.

Honorable A. LINCOLN,

President of the United States:

Governor Salomon has gone to Cleveland on call of Secretary Seward. We have been called upon for only one regiment, and are raising it as rapidly as possible.

W. H. WATSON,

Private Secretary.

CINCINNATI, OHIO, July 4, 1862.

Honorable EDWIN M. STANTON:

May not Kentucky raise a portion of the new call for twelve- months" men? Can get better men and more expeditious. Answer to Covington, Ky.

JNO. W. FINNELL,

Adjutant-General of Kentucky Volunteers.
