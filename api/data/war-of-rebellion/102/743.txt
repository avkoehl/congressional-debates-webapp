Major-General POPE:

It is the Cheyenne Indians that are in the Black Hills, and they want to fight. We are suffering greatly for want of paymaster. Some of the men have not been paid for over a year. All are without pay for six months.

General P. H. SHERIDAN:

It is probable a large force of cavalry will be required in Texas. If enough cannot be obtained in the West, let me know and I will send all that is required from here. I want Custer and Merritt left in Texas for the present. The whole State should be scoured to pick up Kirby Smith's men and the arms carried home by them.
