I was on the Seaboard road destroying the track. I drove them back on the cars and afterward fell back to this place by the way of Jackson. I will [recross] the Chowan to-morrow, returning to the vicinity of Suffolk, and await your orders. I have picked up and brought in thirty or forty bales of cotton. This country is full of it.

E. V. SUMNER,

BALTIMORE, MD., April 5, 1865. - 11.45 a.m.

Honorable GIDEON WELLES,

Secretary of the Navy, Washington, D. C.:

I am just informed that two vessels have been captured by the rebels, the Harriet De Ford last night in Herring Bay, and the St. Mary on the 1st of April at the mouth of Patuxent River. I have no small steamer to dispatch to look after them. Could you not dispatch two light-draught steamers, either from Potomac Flotilla or Hampton Roads, to put a stop to this business?

Respectfully,

THOS. A. DORNIN,

Commodore.

FORT MONROE, April 5, 1865.

Rear-Admiral PORTER:

It is reported that a rebel Captain Fitzhugh with twenty-seven men, captured a small propeller steamer at Fair Haven yesterday. She went toward the Rappahannock. Have telegraphed to commander of Potomac Flotilla, and will send Young America to cruise about there.

Respectfully,

E. T. NICHOLS,

Senior Officer.

[Indorsement.]

Admiral Porter is not at Varina.

SAINT INIGOES, April 5, 1865

Captain TOLE:

Steamer Harriet De Ford was captured by rebels last night about fifty miles down the river from Baltimore, or in Herring Bay. Go down to the Great Wicomico and warn all the vessels there of this and remain there. The Don will leave here immediately.

F. A. PARKER,

Commander.

Have you taken from Frederick the transportation of Grover's division? If so, where is it now, and is it necessary for your command?
