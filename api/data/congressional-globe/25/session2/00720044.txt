This presents a period of twelve years of ímpo-ts
and expo.is, and these twelve jears cover that pre-
cise portion of the existence of the Bank of the
United States which is celebrated by its friends, as
the ne plus ultra of perfection, and what was the
result' Why, that our exports of specie exceeded
our imports, that our exports amounted to the
enormous sum of ^85,280,368, while our imports
amounted to $83,356,662, and that the effect of
this excessive exportation was to leave the country
with no more than twenty or twentj-two millions
of specie to sustain all it  banking, and all its com-
mercial operations'
In the year 1832, the year of the veto message,
General Jackson and his friends first commenced
their efforts to improve the currency, and the i°sult
is 'how n in this table

Behold the difference, said Mr  E     Here in the
short spac  of five jeais, wenive an impoit of up-
wards of sixtj-two mi'lions, an export of almost
nothing Making an allowance for the gold coined
at the mint, the specie brought m by passengers,
and not registered at the eustr m hoiists ii d the
actual mci ease of specie for the last h/ejears,
averages twelve millions per annum, and this
great increase has been the salvation of the coun-
try, and enabled it to ride out the storm of the
present bank suspension, and to triumph over it,
for complete and proud will be the triumph of the
country over the diabolical design to impose upon
it a broken bank paper, and shin-plasler currency1
If there had been no more specie in the country
in May last, than there was at the time of the veto
message in 1832, the countrj would have been
crushed' but eightv m llions, instead of twentv,
has saved the country, ind show n that it is ible
to stand the shock of a universal suspension of
specie payments by the baks Sucn is the
strength of General Jackson's policy—so wisely
is it founded in coirect principles, that oven
m this year of bank suspensions, and in defiance
of all attempts to drive specie fiom tie counlrj,
there has been an importation of near eleven mil-
lions, and an export ot onlj six million? and three
quarters, and we are now ready to begin another
year, with the doublp advantage of tne fojeign
exchanges in our favoi, and tht. whole of the last
year's crop just ready to go to market The
imports of specie for this yeir must th°n be im-
mense, probably a  great as they were the \ear
after the panic, when they ami unied to neai
eighteen millions reported it the customs, besides
several millions brought by emigrants, ai d not
leported Such is the fruit of General Tickson's
policy, and if that policy can be continued a few
} ears longer, our stocit (f sold and silver will con
time to incoase until ever} part of the Union, like
Holland and France,is srturatedwith the precious
metals, and until the most undaunted advocate for
shin-plasters and broken bank notes w ill be forced
to admit that there is no necessity for such vile
and filthy substitutes foi spew 
Mi B contiasted the five }ears' re-ult ot Gene-
ral J?ckson's experiment with die preceding twehe
}ears' regulation of the curre c\ by the Bank ot
the United S lies The difference «as, a LOSS o
two millions of spec e in the twehe }ears of bank,
and A. G\IN rf si it} mill ons in the fne }ears of
of General Jackson's experiment This was the
difference, and this difference shows, that if the
experiment had only began a few years sooner, we
should bow have had as much gold and silver as
the business ef the whole Union cculd possibly
employ, and if it can now be continued a few
jears lunger, we shall soon have as much ás can
possibly be used Look at the imports' they are
alwa}S large The} are the natuial effect of the
exportation of our annual crop of one hundred
millions' worth of cotton, tobacco, rice, and other
articles These have brought, are bringing, and
will continue to bring, annually, eight, ten, fifteen,
eighteen millions of dollars, to --ay nothing of
whit is brought by emigiants If the experi-
ment continues, the mass of these annual im-
ports will remain in the country until the
country is saturated with specie, then the surplus
will overflow of itself But if the enemies of the
experiment succeed, and especially if they succeed
in changing the experiments, then the old policy of
the Bink of the Un ted States w ill prevail Expoi-
tation of specie will be the order of the da} ' lhe
States will again be drained of fort} two millions,
as they were from 1817 to 1832 The whole will
go to England Exports will be nade to exceed
imports, and at the end of some years we shall be
brought back to that vaunted period of 1832, wnh
fiom " twenty to twenty two millions of specie," and
the w hole business of the coun ry—crops, com-
merce, exchanges, rtal and personal propert ,
stocks, and every Government, State and Fede-
ral—the prey of the Bank of the United States
Having show i that fho specie m the country
wis increased from 1832 to 183/, from twenty
millions to eighiy millions, Mr B wished the
friends of the non-resumption banks to reconcile
an apparent contradiction It was this that^vith
only twenty millions of specie in 183°, they held
the currency to be soundest, safest, and finest upon
eirth ' and now, with eighty millions of specie in
the country, they hold the country to be utterly
ruined, and totally unable to raise mcayunes and
mnepeneps to oirr\ to the p st o^i^e or lo the
marie' Ihis was aooniradiction «1 ich he wished
to see reconciled, and until it was reconciled, he
must be permitted to believe that, as eighty mil-
lions is four times greater than twenty-millions, so
is the coantiy this day four times more able to pay
specie in 1837 than it was in 1832
Mr B besought gentlemen not to be distressed
at the thoughts of parting company with their dear
shin plasters It v. as quite possible to live w ithout
them, and to live well He hid experience on
this subject There were no shin plasters n Mis-
souri an i there w as no distress or misery there
All was flourishing and nppv real estate, personal
esUle p oduce, labor, all ueirin<* the highest prices
ever known beforp, and hard money in every man s
pocket He had a lettei from one of the principal
mechanics of St Louis, m answer to an inquiry
made of him, which stated the prices of labor in
St Louis, and which with the leave of the Señale
he would read     The leiter wis as follow s

Such are the prices of labor in St Louis,—such
the lewards of labor in that place ,—and this only
gives one view of the state of things in that city
Its commerce was still more striking, and certain
he was that he saw more commerce in the port,
and on the wharf of St Louis, the day he left there,
than he had seen from that place to Washington
city, including all that he saw in all the cities,
towns and villages on the Ohio nver put together.
And that without banks, for the one chartered last
winter was more in name than in substance, and
issued no notes except for specie deposited, dollar
for dollar Mr B expressed his belief that St.
Louis, in point of arriving and departing tonnage,
was now the third city of the Union, that New
York was first, New Orleans second, and St Louis
third, and that she had attained this eminence
without banks and without shm-plasters, and was
advancing at this moment with a degree of rapidity,
and enjoying at ttusmomen', a degree of CREDIT,
piospenty, and happiness which nobank-ndden
or shin-plastered city in America can boast of
Mr B said the polic} of General Jack ion would
succeed It was right in itself, and would succeed
It might be frustrated temporarily bv a combina-
tion of banks, and was now frustrated by them,
but there were good banks and bad banks in the
country, and a division would take place among
them, and in that division every bank and every
political party will take its own station Gold
and silver, now four times more abundant m the
United States than they were five }ears ago, will
continue to increase, the public determination to
have them will increase just in the propoition to
theeffoits to deprive the country of them, detesta-
tion of shin-plasteis and broken bank notes will
mereasp m proportion to the efforts to continue
them m circulation, and, eventually, the day of
recoil of revulsion, must come Shm-plasters
will be put down, no mat'er who defends them,
broken L- ik noes v ii1 >e put dran, no mat-
ter who cnenshes them, banks will have to
resume or die, no matter who opposes the re-
sumption, gold will come into circulation, no
matter who hates gold, hard money will be the
common currency of the country, no matter who
wishes the contrary, a pestiferous issue of small
bank notes under twenty dollars, will be suppres-
sed, no matter who is for small noies, banks will
be mide responsible foi their debts, no matter who
is for irresponsibility These things will come to
pass, not because this or that man says so, bat
because they are right in themselves, and what is
ruht in itself will even ually succeed in every
moial and intelligent ce m nunit} Yes' ' the ex-
periment" has increased our specie, in five years,
trom twenty millions to eight} millions, it is now
ii creasing it at the rat" of many mil ions per an-
num, it will continue to meieise until the whole
country 15 filled with goM and «liver, until the
quantity is sogieat that resistance can no longer be
made to its c rculation, and then broken bank pa-
per, shin-nlasters, and all their friends and sup-
poiters will sink together These things will hap-
pen, they w ill ro ne to pass, but not without
contest and arduous struffglmg Great will be the
effort to keep up the broken bank and shm-plaster
system—an effort doublv directed to force the circu-
lation of this tnsh, and to iesi«t all measures to re-
store the constitutional currencv We see this cir-
culation forced and pushed ev ery where, «e see all
attempts to check it un versallv and systematically
