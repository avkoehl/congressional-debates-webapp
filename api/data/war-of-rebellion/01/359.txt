for action. I will put up to-morrow three 10-inch light mortars. I have no others. The casemate embrasures are closed, some with brickwork and others with stone and pieces of wood. These will be strengthened as time permits. I am making canister for some of my barbette guns, there being none in the fort. An abatis of brush is being placed about the exposed points of attack. I have two 10-inch columbiads mounted if necessary. All work has been stopped on these batteries, according to the promise of Colonel Chase. I do not think there are more than four hundred State troops occupying the fort and barracks opposite. Fort McRee is occupied, but no guns mounted to my knowledge.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your most obedient servant,

A. J. SLEMMER,

First Lieutenant, First Artillery, Commanding Post.

FORT PICKENS, FLA., February 12, 1861.

Honorable J. HOLT, Secretary of War:

SIR: Since the departure of Lieutenant Gilman as special messenger for Washington nothing of special interest has transpired. I am continuing the defenses, mounting guns on the ramparts, and blocking up the casemate embrasures. Having observed a battery in course of erection upon which they were mounting heavy guns, 8-inch columbiads, and as this battery would rake two bastions and the connecting curtains of this fort, I addressed the following no to to Colonel Chase:

FORT PICKENS, FLA., February 11, 1861.

Colonel WM. H. CHASE, Commanding the Forces of Florida:

SIR: I observe you are erecting and arming a battery west of the light-house. I deem it my duty to protest against its further continuance, and also of all batteries which may bear on Fort Pickens.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your most obedient servant,

A. J. SLEMMER,

First Lieutenant, First Artillery, Commanding.
