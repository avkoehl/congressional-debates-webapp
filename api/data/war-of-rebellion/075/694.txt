General JOSEPH E. JOHNSTON:

I dispatched you by Captain Hardee, who has just left on the passenger train. I follow immediately after on the train which takes this. General French's first brigade (Sears') should have left Blue Mountain in time to have been within a day's march of Rome to-night. Ector and Cockrell's should have followed at intervals of twelve hours each. General Ferguson should be in Rome by Friday night, and the other two cavalry brigades within twenty-four hours after. Unless otherwise ordered I shall employ them on my left flank.

I am, general, very respectfully,

L. POLK,

Lieutenant-General.
