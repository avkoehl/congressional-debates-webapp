General S. WILLIAMS:

I expect there may by some difficulty in meeting the case presented by the Pennsylvania Reserves, and as it is important to have something done at once, cannot the responsibility be assumed to muster the officers selected subject to the approval of the War Department?

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.

BURNSIDE'S HEADQUARTERS,

June 5, 1864-4.20 p. m.

Major-General WARREN,

Commanding Fifth Corps:

Your dispatch has not been answered, because I have been out on the line which I have been ordered to take to-night, but had I been here it would have been impossible for me to have granted your request and fulfill my orders. I am directed to take up a new line some 3 1/2 miles in length. Besides, having relieved one of General Smith's brigades on his extreme right, I am now laying out the line. I shall put all the reserve troops on it before dark.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.

JUNE 5, 1864-5 p. m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

I have asked General Burnside to relieve my left brigade, but he says he cannot do it and carry out your orders. I am apprehensive that my line is too weak. There is heavy skirmishing all the time and cheering in my front and I have withdrawn that brigade, leaving only a skirmish line there. General Burnside's troops are near there if the enemy should make any demonstration on that point, which I do not think probable.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
