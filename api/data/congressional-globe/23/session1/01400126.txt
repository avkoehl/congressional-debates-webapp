THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
Jan. 24,
discussion, too, which was due to the House, the
character and private faith of the nation, and,
above all, due to the citizens of this entire com-
munity, who would thus have an opportunity of
seeing for themselves the existing state of things,
know the causes thereof, and what was the remedy
to be applied. He would ask the House to look
to the nature of the two propositions before them
One was that the public money was hereafter to
be lodged in the Bank of the United States, and
what sort of a bank was that? Why, it was
a bank, the control over which by the people,
through guardians appointed by themselves, was
greater than was permitted to any monarch in
Europe over such institutions, it was a bank whose
resources were ample to meet all the demands
that could be made upon it, and which was so
constituted as to be under every proper and neces-
sary check by the executive, the legislative, and
the judiciary, who could, in their respective ca-
pacities, if they saw fit, bring it before the tribu-
nals of the country, take away its corporate rights,
of examine into its condition This was the insti-
tution which was proposed by the resolution of
the gentleman from South Carolina, whilst they
should also ask themselves what was the condi-
tion, in all respects, of 'he State banks, which
was proposed by the honorable gentleman from
Georgia as a safe depositoi y for the public money
Were not these Siate banks altogether independ-
ent of the same control ' And what dependence
had they to enforce the performance of the duties
which must necessarily be required from them'
What had they but a simple contract, the very
enforcement of which depended on the will of the
party making it, upon the will of a Secretary who
will not allow that the House has any control in
removing the public money'
The subject now, therefore,at issue was,whether
that public money would be placed where it was
safe, and where it was subject to their control, or
have it in those places where the House could not
have any control but that which he had already
descnbed He disclaimed altogether her bem 
actuated by private or political motives in this dis-
cussion, for it was a subject he felt to be far above
such considerations, and he ti usted that the House,
in coming to a decision upon it, would not decide
it as a mere party question, but as one affecting all
the great interests of the country, which by then
oaths they had bound themselves to maintain The
honorable gentleman from Tennessee [Mr Polk]
had stated that this question was presented in the
shape of an issue between the Government and the
bank, he, however, would take leave to differ from
h,m in this opinion, as to who were the parties in
the contest If that gentleman meant by the term
Government, theTieasury, he might be conect,
but if he meant the Government, as it was undei-
Btood by freemen, to be composed of other tribu-
nals, the executive along with the legislative and
judicial departments, they could not be considered
as the parties, for so far as they could act they
ad decided by their vote that the public money
had been placed where it ought to be The gentle-
man was equally in error when he supposed the
bank was the other party No Their interest in
the qiestion dwindled into insignificance when
compared with the interest of the people, and the
contest was rather one between the Treasury De
partment and (he people of the country The bank
was 1 ut a mere cipher in the controversy, and the
lesult must fall upon the people He considered
ihat our condition for three years past, and up to
the removal of the deposites, was a period of un-
paralleled quiet, ease, and prosperity to the coun
try, in which every class had full employment
given them, the laborei, mechanic, farmer,as well
as the professional man, whilst the Bank of the
United States hod regulated the machinery by
which these vauous interests were upheld and
kept in order And this they were enabled to do
by preventing the State banks from over issues, by
keeping down the rates of foreign exchange, and
thus in preventing an exportation of specfe, they
had equalized the cmrency, giving health and
soundness to it to such a degree as never before
eysted in any country, and which called forth
thanksgiving to the beneficent Author of all meicies
for such a state of things What was it now, how-
ever, and how sad the contiast' What was the
condition of every large city   And this was a ques-
tion which came home to the humblest individual
So far as regarded the state of the cities, was it not
well known—for the sufferings of these communi-
ties could not be concealed—that the whole course
of mercantile operations was wholly suspended,
that every channel of industry was choked up,
that there appeared to be a perfect paralysis upon
all business No new contracts were now making,
for the currency was in so disordered a state,
money could not be obtained It had been said
by the member from New York that all this had
proceeded from a spirit of hostility displayed by
the bank to the Government, but this was not the
true cause, and he argued at length to show that
there had been a depression in foreign exchange
from four per cent premium, to a discount of a half
or one per cent for cash, that there was a complete
stoppage to the sale of all pioduce, and thatmoney
had become so scarce as to pioduce offers fir it in
New York, on good security, as high as 18 per
cent Stocks of all kinds had fallen Foreign
commerce was annihilated, and the domestic ex-
changes of the country, m which the Bank of the
United States done formerly so large a portion of
the business, was at so low an ebb that State bank
notes west of Albany were at a discount of a half
to two per cent , whilst bills of exchange on the
southern and western cities were wholly unsale-
able If this, then, was the true pictuie of their
condition, did it not follow that these evils must
increase, unless there was a timely remedy applied,
and that the local banks must be driven to one of
two alternatives, either to hazard their stock, by
further curtailments of loans, or to a suspension
of specie payments He contended that, from the
pressure, the local banks would not be enabled to
collect in their debts much longer, the result of
which must be to cieate a panic as to their own
stability, which, once raised, they mighF as well
attempt to resist, as to stem the torrent of Niagara
The cord had been tightened so long, and the pres-
sure so felt by the State banksatits ultimate pomt
of tension, that it must snap at last, and, in the
end, the Bank of the United States, whose resources
had been so underrated, would be found to ride
out the storm -He disclaimed the idea of repre-
senting the State banKs as unsound, but he could
not be blind to what he honestly believed must be
the result to those institutions, if there was not
some strong efforts made to íeplace the currency
as it was, and this could now be only effected by
the success of the motion submitted by the gentle-
man from South Carolina
Mr H. then adverted to the statement in the
Secretary's report, that the curtailments of the
Bank of the United States had been, in the months
of September and October, upwards of four m 1-
lions, whilst, m the same months, there had been
an increase of the public deposites of more than
two, which theSecietary had madeachargeagamst
the institution as having withdrawn six millions
from the business of the country But he would
show that the bank had not made any unusual cur-
tailment And, further, that the Secretary must
have known that they did not, nor had they evinced
any intention of contracting their loans This was
to be proved by referí ing to the bank's correspond-
ing statement in 1832, where it would appear that
the reduction of that time was $949,000 more than
thatof 1833 So he inferred the reduction wasmade
in the natural course of banking operation, and not
fiom a design, aschaiged upon the bank, of cre-
ating a pressuie for ultenorpurposes, and he asked,
could such a reduction, at this period, be fairly
considered as made with the intention of distress-
ing the community, when it appeared that in these
months the bank had been pieviou&ly accustomed
to make them  The bank, he said,regularly fur-
nished their accounts to the Treasury,and although
he would not impute motives, or act upon them,
except so far as they had been disclosed, yet he
could not help feeling some surprise that, with the
knowledge that this reduction was not unusual
on the part of the bank during these months, the
Secretary could have come to the conclusion that I
he wis warranted in taking the steps he did, with II
a view, as he alleged, to remedy the pressure com- '
plained of on thepait of the community                 I
Mr H went into some statements to show that I
the bank rad not made any great reduction of its J
discounts, m 1833, and that the amount of bills '
discounted and facilities afforded m 1832 did not ¡
much exceed the amount in 1833   The statement,
that the commeicial  facilities   afforded   by  the
b-anch bank at New Orleans had been diminibhed
was untrue     The purchase of bills on the north-
ern cities m preference to those on the western
cities by that branch had the effect, and was in
tended to have the effect, of benefiting the agricul-
tural intei eats of the Southwest.   From official
documents he attempted to show that the course
of the bank had not occasioned the distress, and
he would go on to show what was the cause.   It
was the unwise and unwai rantable hostility waged
against the Bank of the United States by the Gov-
ernment    A systematic attempt, as we all knew,
had (he said) been made to villify and slander the
directors of the bank, and impair the credit and
character of the institution.   The course of pro
ceeding had brought the country to its present state
of embarrassment and distress     Thecountry, he
believed, would have sustained the bank so long
as its administration was conducted faithfully in
regard to the interests of the stockholders and the
public    But the bank had to contend with the
hostility of the Government and the slanders of
the press   The time chosen for the removal of the
deposites was such as to render it necessary for
the bank to curtail its accommodations to the com-
munity to a greater extent than would have been
necessary at any other period     It had been often
said that the mere withdrawal of eight millions
could not produce the effect which had been expe-
rienced     If the bank had been  required to pay
that sum of money for the use of the United States
Bank, no such injurious consequences would have
been realized     He would tell us m what way the
removal of the deposites produced these results.
It was by breaking up the relations of amity and
confidence between the Government and the Bank
of the United States     We feel great distress, and
we apprehend greater     Can we apply a remedy'
He thought we could     A proper and adequate
remedy was, in his opinion, to restore the depos-
ites, to restore confidence, and to restore amity
between the bank and the Government.   Could
the local banks provide a safe, sound circulating
medium' Could they facilitate exchanges between
different parts of thrs widely-extended country'
Could they restore the country to its former healthy
and prosperous condition'  If they could, it must
be by their notes.   But we know that their notes
are not current beyond their own immediate vicin-
ity     He appealed to former experience to show
that the local bank paper could not afford a gen-
eral and uniform circulating medium     You can't
get the intelligent bank directors in New York to
take the paper of distant local banks     The Gov-
ernmentdeposites, instead ofstrengthemng, weak-
ened the local banks, because their notes were not
equivalent to com     He doubted whether even the
sound banks in the city of New York would afford
ary facilities to exchange    SuDpose those banks
authorize drafts upon   them from  the western
towns, who is to buy them'   Not the local west-
ern banks     But the branches of the United States
Bank purchased drafts to an immense amount m
those places upon New York     Fifty millions in
specie would not give to the western States the
facilities to exchange with the North which were
afforded to them by the United States Bank    He
had thus given a general view of the nature, cause,
and remedy of the present distress     It remained
to inquire whether this remedy should be applied
by Congress
Mi HUNTINGTON here yielded the floor,
without concluding, to
Mr GORHAM, on whose motion the House
adjourned
IN SENATE.
Friday, Janumy 24, 1834.
On motion of Mi WEBSTER, the Senate pro-
