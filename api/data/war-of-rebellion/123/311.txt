Governor's Secretary, Indianapolis:

How many enlisted men have been mustered into the U. S. service in each regiment of cavalry and infantry; and what is the number of each regiment now full?

The delay that has taken place enables the Department to send a larger proportion of the best arms than could have been sent two weeks since.

In drafting will not telegraphic operators be exempt in your orders to Governors of States? Allow me to suggest that in the quota furnished from counties and townships you should direct allowance to those which have furnished their quota. Some townships have done well, some nothing.
