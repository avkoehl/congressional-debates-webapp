Brigadier General M. BRAYMAN,

Commanding District of Cairo, Cairo, Ill.:

GENERAL: The major-general commanding corps requests that you will carefully collect the necessary data from which to make a full and circumstantial report of the late surrender at Union City, Tenn., as early as practicable.

The same will apply to the affair at Paducah, in which the general desires that the part the rebels took in the destruction and plundering of the town should be clearly shown.

I have the honor to be, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

T. H. HARRIS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
