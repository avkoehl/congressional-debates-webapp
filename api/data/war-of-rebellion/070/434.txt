NEW CREEK, May 11, 1864.

Brigadier General B. F. KELLEY:

I have the new troops which arrived this morning in the fort. It is raining continuously, and they are suffering severely, being without shelter and unused to such exposure.

N. WILKINSON,

Colonel.

NEW CREEK, May 11, 1864.

Brigadier General MAX WEBER:

The information you give was suspected yesterday and known here this morning.

I have been preparing to give the enemy a warm reception. Have received re-enforcements at this place. Don't know what General Kelley has below. Could use more men, especially cavalry, to advantage if they could be procured.

N. WILKINSON,

Colonel.

COLUMBUS, May 11, 1864. (Received 8.30 p. m.)

E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

Can you give me anything cheering or definite from either army to-day? I am very anxious as to both quarters. Will regard as confidential whatever you desire. Am hurrying troops as fast as I can get transportation. All departments are working cordially and promptly with me.

JNO. BROUGH.

WASHINGTON CITY, May 11, 1864-9 p. m.

Governor BROUGH,

Columbus:

Our latest date from the Army of the Potomac is at 6 o'clock last evening. The two armies were at Spotsylvania Court-House. There had been two days' hard fighting with no material advantage on either side. General Sedqwick was killed yesterday in one of the skirmishes. General Grant gives no indication of doubt as to his final success. The army is represented to be in excellent condition and spirits.

No general battle has yet taken place between Sherman and Johnston. McPherson holds Snake Creek Gap, and Sherman is waiting until all his force come up. There is nothing from General Butler to-day. His last report states that he can now hold his position against Lee's army.

EDWIN M. STANTON.
