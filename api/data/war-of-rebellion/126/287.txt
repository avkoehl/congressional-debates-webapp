Numbers 16. QUARTERMASTER-GENERAL'S OFFICE, Washington, D. C., August 31, 1865.

Bvt. Major General M. C. MEIGS,

Quartermaster-General U. S. Army, Washington, D. C.:

GENERAL: I have the honor to report for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1865, relative to the operations of the Third Division, in charge of the ocean and lake transportation of the War Department as follows:

During the first month of the year the office work of the division was nearly suspended by most of the employes being called into active service in the field to assist in repelling the rebel raid on Washington; nevertheless, sufficient steamers were promptly on hand at City Point for the transportation of the Sixth Army Corps to Washington and Baltimore, rendering efficient service in driving back the invading force.

Also, in this month, the army of General Canby was moved from New Orleans to Mobile Bay, co-operating with the navy in the reduction of the forts.

From August to December no large army movements requiring water transportation were made, but a great number of steamers were used to forward the supplies for the armies before Richmond.

In December the approach of General Sherman's army to the Atlantic Coast taxed the resources of the department to the utmost extent.
