the upper Minnesota River before the time heretofore fixed by us, to-wit, the 1st June, for last season I left Camp Pope on 16th June with the expedition under my lead, and we could barely subsist the animals on the grass to be found at that late period. But if the horses, equipments, arms, and accouterments for which requisitions have been made, and which are indispensable, shall arrive here in time, I will endeavor to anticipate the time fixed upon by a few days, and should that be practicable I will advise you at Sioux City, where I suppose you should hereafter be addressed. I cannot change my opinion relative to the expediency of a post at Devil's Lake, and cannot see how it can be established this year, but I will of course obey orders so far as it is possible. I have letters by way of Red River from several chiefs of the Yanktonais and Sissetons on the Missouri expressive of a desire for peace. Governor Dallas, of the Hudson Bay Company, has strongly advised them to that course. I write you again on that subject. Kind regards to the Messrs. Chouteau.

Respectfully and truly, yours,
