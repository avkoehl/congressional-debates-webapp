MAJOR: I have the honor to inform you that I brought up the 10-inch columbia from the northwest corner of Fort Sumter this morning and placed it on Commercial wharf. The 9-inch Dalhgren, over the postern at the southwest corner, unfortunately, struck the muzzle in its fall, and broke off about 1 foot of it.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,
