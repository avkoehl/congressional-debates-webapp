GENERAL APPROPRIATION HILL.
The House then l-sumed the consideration of
the bill making appropnations tui the civil and
diplomatic expenses ot Government foi the yeai
18J5
The question was on the amendment offered
by Mr VAjN'CC, propnsmg to ¡epeal the second
section of the law of 1834 (which gives to certain
subordinate oi'ker3 ot the eustor-is thesa 'ie emol-
uments as they received pnoi to the reduction of
dunes in 1833) to limit then compensation, mid
oblige them to report, am ually, the amout t of
compensation by tees, &c , received by 'hero,
together with an amendment thereto, securing to
them the same emoluments as they received m
1834, <lc
Mr WISE said his ol)°ct in rising wis meiely
to state some facts, as he was led to believe fiom
the lemarks he had^ heard yesteiday, that the
lioise did not ful v understand the manner m
which oui ¡evenuetffi eu we e paid. Theitpoit
upon the subject was calculated to mis'ead and
to decive The gentleman from North Ciro-
hna [Vir Wiliiams] had cited the enoimoua
sum ot six thousand dolíais as the amount received
by a single weighei org lugei The truth wis that
no such sum was paid Previous to the reduction
of the tariff, the weigheis received thirty-seven
and a half cents per ton, but since that reduction
then fees ware leduced to a low, bat adequate
compensation. In the year 1833 Congress passed
a law making their fees the same as it the du'ies
had not been reduced, and limiting their income
to $2,000 per annum You will find it stated
I in the report and m the B'ue Book that one
we'ghet recei'ed upwards of ^2 00l),wh'leanothei
received but $330, the truth was the one lecetved
precisely the sameas the other—aves aging £>133 80
He put it to the House to say whether tins amount
was suffii tent it they would have íes] e"til le and
responsible officeisj, The city ol New Yolk was
divided into thirteen districts—many of those e ffi
cers weie obliged to go fiom one to two mi'e  to
attend to their duties In thefiistplace,hi  house
lent should be estimated at least at ¡¡,450, his fuel
at $ 150, his clothing at fc!25 'l his amount might
be put to his individual expenses, to wineh should
be added ins food, wjiich he is compelled to pro-
cure at the eating houses near the scene of bis
duties, $125 O te dolla, way suiely a moderate
estimate ot his daily family expenses, msktt g
§ÚG5 pei annum, t>ie < lothmir of his family might
ue estima'ed at §125, and $,150 for purposes ot
education. Th'is we have foi his yearly expenses
the sum of §1,49 ),exc usue o variou-. othei uems
which it wt iilj be diffii u't to enumeiate
M' W said, he would go with the gentleman
to tes'nct ibe compeimtio'i of these ofíi ers to the
sum of $2 000 per annum They could ro ,c-
eeivemoie ui dei the present 1 iw lie lelicved
the pom an I pihugtrg system of pay it tr salaries,
which he was sorry io see have so mat y advo
cates on that floor tins yea>, was il e most unwise
aid coitupttng system in the woild. If you set
up these offices for the lowest b dder, you wou'd
have some very icspeotab'e looking men giving in
the figure naught, but lh"y won d find the vwjs
and means of pay.rg themselvi s a I gnei silary
than that now allowed. A weigher oi sugar, foi
ins anee, could make a cask weigh as iruen when
one half e.f its contents was taken out as u did
before So with wine, returned for a eltavvbai K
The cask might Le filled with watei A rus om
house oath ws consideied by many as the least of
all moral obligations He knew individuals wno
would smuggle, while lie believed them o herwi^e
to be men ot l ouesty and integrity lie loped
that Congress would do justice to these offneis,
ai d also do j islicetotheUoveinmetit, by secunng
an honest codec ion of the it venue, by t,ivj'ig them
an adequate compensa inn
Mi JAUVIS said he ha 1 an amerdmentto pio-
pose, to whit h >e believed the gentleman from
Ohio would not object     It was as fo'lowt
Provided, 1 hat the who'e uimbei  of cits nm
house officers in the United S ates, on tl e firs  e f
Pebruaiy, 1834, shall not oe incieased till other-
wise allowed by Congress
Mi J said, his object was to empowei the Sec-
retai y of the Trea-uiy, n conjunction with the
col'ectois of customs, to apportion to places wheie
thev might be reqjirtd, custom-house officeis at
pusent in the set vice, ilie amendme it of Ine
gentle ratn fiom Oh o, if rc'opted, v/ould i ot jiei-
mtt the Secretiry of the Tieasuiy, or the cot e.c
tois, howeve necessaiy it might be oi the public
set v ice, to set dan mspectoi t > any exposed ¡loint,
t nless there should be an excess in oi e district
What Mi J wanted, was to empowei these per-
sons to tians'er from one district to ano'nei wi en
lequisite, which they wou J be enabled to do undei
the piovision uni'e. consi leiation it, for m-
st nice, theie be too many ins|>cctots ii the dis-
tt ict of ^ew York, and too few in ihe (lis i ,o. of
New Haven, he wished to ^,ive ' le Secretary
of the Tieasury the powei of red no ig them in the
foinrr, and met easing them ir the httei At
piesent, he had th° power of decteismg in New
Yolk, but he, had rot the power, providcu the
amendmentofthegentleman fiomOiio be adopted,
of adding any inspectois in any ui&tnct, however
necessary it might be Mi J presumed the gen-
tlenun did not uesign so to curb and res',am the
powei of the Secietaiy of the Treasuty
Mi VANCE sjpposed the proviso was a
propel one, and he would adopt it
Mi J^RVIS wished to say a few words in r ply
to the gentleman from Vnginia, [Mr. Wise ] 1 he
aigument used by that gentleman hi repaid to
weigl eis and gauges, v ent far'her,peihaps, than
he intended, for it applied equally well, and indeed
bettei, to Ihe inspectors    1 lie latter received a pe-
dum dlovvance, which, by law, could not exceed
thice dolíais a day, making $1 095 per annum.
Now, if the weigher and gauger ccultl not live for
less tt an $3,000 a year, how weie the inspectors
to live for a little more than $1,000> They had
as many mouths to feed,and us many children to
educate, and the responsibility upon them was
giea'erihan upon ihe weighers and gaugers Mr
J agreed with the gent1 n an from Vngmia, that
it was m the powei of . last to de^iaud the Gov
ernment by making falsi eturris, end entering a
full hogshead of sugar wl en it was perhaps only
half lull, oi a pipe of wine when is eon.cn s
might be nothing but water, and procuring the
tliawoack upon the same Buttheinspectoi coulti,
it diS|josed, go a little further Bylaw the m-
s|nr'ii was compelle I to certify that the goods
specified hid been actually jiut on board, but he
muhtceinty wi hout anyhing being puto i board
at till lie might give his eei tifie ite, and the
exporung meicliant would ieceive,tlie whole
amount eif duties, when vane of the goods were
on board Tl is was no imaginary case, foi it
hud fallen und*-i Mr S 's own experience He
had known rases wheie tras were alleged to have
been on boaid, wheie ttieie was nothing but empty
chests, or with stoi es m them,and wine e\p> rted,
where not a single pint had gone out of the coun-
try
Mr J wuhed this m^tte' had come up m a
bettei shape, ard was soiry diet the necessity of
having sich an amendmenuntiouuced m an appro-
pmtnn bill shoulel esust, but he was satisfied tint
unless it was put into an approptiation bill ihere
was very little chance of any leform ever being
m> de in our custom hoive system It was when
officers in the latger pons fe-h a jiressure that we
were to look fir action in that House, and not
before, ai d although he was at no time disposed
'o encumber appiopna ion b'l s in this way, yet,
as there was never any difficulty of encumbeiing
them with extraneous matter whet theol ject was
to ttriw money out ot the Treasui} , he could not
ftel himself adveise to it when the object was to
íeíain roeiuey ihe-ein
Mr HARPER, of Pennsylvania, stated the
Picccrs in the port of Philadelphia, which was
usually perfoitned by the deputy weighers and
laborers, the puncipal weigher laiely bei"g in
attendance, foi títere was biit one foi that poit
Thertfoie, all idea about divid.rg the fees ainorg
i numbt i f j trsot s was imaginary, at least as
i ^í>t ected ti e city ol Phil it'elpnia 1 he principal
weigher had 1 tile discretion compired with the
'tispectois, \< \io tecetved a compensation of th^ee
lollatsaday As soon asa vessel arrived in ¡30tt,
at inspector was put on boaid,and it was his
dutv to pet mit nothing to be taken away without
his certificate The goods for drawback are put
on shoie, undei his conn ol, a id place 1 in custom-
house sti res or warenousts, and secured under
two locks, one ],ey to be kept by him, and the
othei by tne mei^hant, and the door could not
be opened wuhoi t the p esence of both If the
inspector was disiosed to c nnive at fraud, he
could do so, I ut 'he we ^her had no means of
doing it Then, if ^,1,33J oe ro! enough to keep
one honest, ho v would £,¡,000 be sufficient to
keep the otnei so?
Mi fi contondeJ fai ther, that the pentleman
from Vugtnii had made a very exaggerated state-
ment in regatd to the expe'se of living m those
places A house amply su'lcient for aman of this
dtbct'ption could be i en led at one half the sum
set dovvi , ami the expense of fuel was also too
mu n But his princip I oljection was the giving
one mina salary of ¡¡,1 000 to pel form as much or
mne laboi than anothti who was to leceive
t,2,0OJ Mi tl agreed that sjie 'eglsl uion on
fhi^ subject wa& necessary, snd thst tl eie might
be parti* tilar places wheie the ompensation would
be fcund too sm<JI, but ir officers themselves
thought so, we should soon have a multiplicity of
applications fiom them for a remedy.
Mr MeKIM said he had been to theTreasury
Depaitment ihit morning, ror the purpose of pro-
cuunga íetuin of what the compensation of the
custom house officers really was The fees re-
ceded in Bah more, Mr McK wa° unders'ood to
say, amounted last ye u to only §433, making the
whole compensation only $1,433, and this was the
exorbitant salaiy complained of by several gentle-
