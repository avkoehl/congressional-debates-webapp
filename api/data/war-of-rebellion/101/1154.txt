HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF NORTH MISSOURI,Macon, Mo., March 11, 1865.

Captain J. F . BENNETT,

Asst. Adjt. General, Department of the Missouri, Saint Louis:

CAPTAIN: In acknowledgment and reply to your favor of the 8th instant, I have the honor to state, for the information of the general commanding, that I am making every effort to complete the organizations of volunteer militia authorized in this district. Some other companies are doing very well, others only moderately so. I have in many instances procured from county courts a liberal bounty to these companies, and I discover a daily increasing deposition on the part of sympathizers to unite with the original Dr. Jacob Townsend loyalists in an effort to put down the bushwhacking thievers and outlaws. The enrollment of the Missouri Militia is going on vigorously.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

CLINTON B. FISK,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF NORTH MISSOURI,Macon, Mo., March 11, 1865.

Major J. W. BARNES,

Asst. Adjt. General, Department of the Missouri, Saint Louis, Mo.:

MAJOR: I have the honor to state, for the information of the general commanding, that the troops of the district have been and are now actively pursuing the bushwhacking enemy. We have not been able to find and fall upon any band of the villains during the week ending this day. I am well persuaded, however, that int he Perche Hills and what is termed the "Blackfoot country," in Boone County, there are quite a number of Jim Jackson's and Bill Anderson's old gang of murderous outlaws. The geography of the country is to them well known, and the topography of that section, as well as the topography of the hearts of the people is most admirably adapted to bushwhacking purposes. I have ordered the Ninth Cavalry Missouri State Militia detachments on duty at this post to move to Sturgeon and organize a most through and vigorous campaign throughout Boone, Howard, Randolph, and Audrain Counties. Sturgeon, you will discover, is an admirable point to operate from we shall doubtless stir up the snakes and drive them into Chariton and Carroll, where I am also preparing to meet and bang them out. The citizens of the district are generally fearful of a repetition of the troubles of last summer. It remains with them principally to prevent such a lamentable state of affairs. I am exerting all the influence I possess to unite the people in vigorous war against the outlaws. I think at no time have the sympathizing rascals been so determined to put down the guerrillas as now. They shall be encouraged in good works even at this eleventh hour. The people need assurance and confidence in each other. They truly honest, loyal, earnest men of the State must lay aside all petty differences and shoulder to shoulder unite in the extermination of all outlaws, and in securing protection, security, and peace for our waiting, suffering, struggling loyalists oft he rural district.

I have the honor to be, major, your respectful and obedient servant,

CLINTON B. FISK,

Brigadier-General.
