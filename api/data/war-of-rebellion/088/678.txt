OFFICE OF PROVOST-MARSHAL-GENERAL,

ARMIES OPERATING AGAINST RICHMOND, VA.,

September 3, 1864.

Major-General WARREN:

MY DEAR GENERAL: When the family of refugees sent in by you came in I found they had an abundance of Southern States money, but otherwise were destitute of pecuniary means. The young child had the whooping cough, and two of the children were without shoes. The papers I could have given them would probably have insured their being forwarded to Philadelphia, with sundry delays while waiting on officials at sundry points. Besides, I had no way of providing for their subsistence, and on deliberation I handed to Mrs. Flowers the sum of $100, as I gathered from your note that the boys had really rendered you service. It seemed to me that such people should not go forward as mendicants, and I thought you would approve it. If this be so, will you please sign the within and return them to me through adjutant-general's office?

Very respectfully,

GEORGE H. SHARPE,

Colonel. &amp;c.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,September 3, 1864.

Brigadier-General GRIFFIN,

Commanding Firth Division:

GENERAL: Will you have directions given to the brigade camped near the fort on our left to be prepared to occupy it at short notice, to clear the entrance through the camp, so that artillery can enter and throw any abatis that may be inside the fort outside of the ditch on the northwest and southwest fronts?

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

FRED. T. LOCKE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
