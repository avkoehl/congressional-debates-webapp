MAHLON D. MANSON,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

CINCINNATI, July 16, 1863.

General MANSON:

General MANSON, Portsmouth:

The force at Gallipolis is ample, I think, to keep Morgan from crossing there, and the report that Morgan is taking the back track is untrue.

Hobson's advance has passed Piketon. I trust the movement of your force to your good judgment.
