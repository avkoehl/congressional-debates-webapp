CHATTANOOGA, TENN., February 13, 1864-8 p.m.

Major General U. S. GRANT:

Your dispatch of 10 a.m. this day is received. I will start as soon as possible after the arrival of General Logan's troops. Have received a rebel paper of the 9th to-day, which says that Sherman occupied Jackson, Miss., on the evening of the 5th; enemy falling back across Pearl River. Cavalry under Lee and Fergunson on west side. Loring is moving from his position (not named) to concentrate his forces with theirs in front of Sherman. Cars running through to Loudon. Telegraphs will be finished to-morrow night.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General.

KNOXVILLE, TENN., February 13, 1864.

Major General U. S. GRANT:

Your dispatch of the 11th is received. I will make all possible haste. Can probably be ready by the time re-enforcements arrive.

Can you send me a light pontoon train? If the rivers rise it will be indispensable.

I will try to take some artillery; if the weather continues dry there will be no difficulty. If the rainy season sets in we may have to work slowly along the railroad.

I will have to use pack-mules from this place, at least for a time. Forage, as well as provisions, will have to be sent here by railroad. I will need fresh horses for nearly all the artillery.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.

NASHVILLE, TENN., February 13, 1864.

(Received 5 p.m.)

Major General H. W. HALLECK, General-in-Chief:

Dispatches just received from General Schofield and conversation with General Foster, who is now here, have determined me against moving immediately against Longstreet. I will write more fully. No danger whatever to be apprehended in East Tennessee.

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General.

KNOXVILLE, February 13, 1864-10 a.m.

Major-General THOMAS, Chattanooga:

General Grant decides that the advance shall be made, and that you are to send me 10,000 infantry besides Stanley's division. Please inform me when they can probably reach this place. If you can send me good artillery horses I will try to take some artillery. I will have to rely upon pack-mules to carry provisions and forage from this place, and upon the railroad to bring forage as well as provisions here. I would be glad if you would send me the Fourteenth Corps in preference to other troops.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.
