THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
March 30,
Mr. HOWARD. Is there more tir&a one
voting place in each ward ?
Mr. WILLEY. There are one or two wards
that have more than one voting- place.
Mr. HO WARD.* Is there any ward in which
there is no voting place ?
Mr. WILLEY. No, sir ; this bill simply
authorizes the judges of election, who are
appointed by the supreme court of the District
of Columbia, to designate and appoint a suffi-
cient number of voting places to enable all the
voters to cast their votes.
Mr. HOWARD. That is right.
_ Mr. BUCKALEW. I wish to ask a ques-
tion. Under the present law I should like_to
understand how the places of election are desig-
nated. What has been the authority?
Mr. HARLAN. I can say for the informa-
tion of the Senator from Pennsylvania that this
makes no change in the existing law, except
that it authorizes these officers to increase the
number of voting places.
Mr. BUCKALEW. The judges of election
are to make the change?
Mr. HARLAN. It authorizes the same offi-
cers who were previously authorized to con-
trol the subject.
Mr. BUtiKALEW. I never before hea.rd
that judges of election had anythingto do with
fixing the places of election.
Mr. HARLAN. That is the provision of
the charter of the city.
Mr. BUCKALEW. Then I have nothing
to say about it.
The bill was reported to the Senate without
amendment, ordered to be engrossed for a
third reading, read the third time, and passed.

HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
Saturday, Mareh 80, 1887.
The House met at ten o'clock a. m.
The Chaplain, Rev. C. B. Boynton, offered
prayer in the following language :
Almighty God, Creator and Preserver of all
things and Redeemer of men through Jesus
Christ Thy Son : once more before Thy throne
wo come to mingle our thanksgiving and our
prayers, offering our morning worship through
our High Priest and Mediator, Jesus Christ.
We thank Thee, 0 God, that on this last day
of the first session of this Congress we can
look back and see how much Thou hast enabled
men to do to promote human liberty, the
security of human rights, the establishment of
justice as the foundation of our national policy
and for the general benefit of our race. We
bless Thee, 0 God, that Thou hast enabled these
public men to do so much toward restoring
order and peace to this once distracted land,
and that, as the battle-cloud has passed away,
so the political battle, as we trust, is drawing
to a close, to be succeeded by a universal
calm. We thank Thee for the wisdom that has
guided these deliberations, for the courage
with which Thou hast inspired them, for the
steadfastness with which they have adhered to
the truth and to righteousness. God be praised
for it all.
And now, as these public servants are about
to separate, follow them, we beseech Thee,
individually with Thy blessing. May the peace
of God, that passeth all understanding, rest on
all their hearts. May they be guarded on their
homeward journey from the perils that beset
the traveler. May their dear households all be
safely kept, and they be permitted to meet
them all in peace. During the interval between
this time and the period of their reassem-
bling keep Thou them in health and strength.
Let not sickness lay any low, nor sudden
stroke of death. And when they come once
more together, then, 0 God, we pray that
they may be enabled to look forth upon a
country reunited in great part through their
own labors and the blessing of God. May
they behold a country American indeed, one
in which the principles of the Gospel of Jesus
Christ shall be the animating spirit of public
policy. 0 Lord, when all our earthly labors
are over, may we meet to labor in Thy heavenly
Kingdom for Jesus' sake. Amen.
The Journal of yesterday was read and
