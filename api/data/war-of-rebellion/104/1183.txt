date of the commencement of the twenty days should only be, say, of the date of your order. I write this after consultation with some of our best citizens, as a means of making the efforts of the militia and other troops now about to be sent to arrest deserters some effectual.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

CHAS. CLARK,

Governor of Mississippi.
HDQRS. EASTERN DIVISION, DISTRICT OF THE GULF,Blakely, April 1, 1865.

Colonel G. G. GARNER,

Chief of Staff:

The order for Captain Slocomb to be relieved was never received by me nor do I know who was to relieve him. All the troops were brought up last night that I have received orders to bring. If you send me the Gunnison she can go to the fort easily to-night. The following has just been received from Thomas, the operator at Tensas. From what he could learn the main body of the enemy is encamped along the old stage road from a point within seven miles of Carpenter's Station to within four miles of Perdido. A detachment of the enemy is at Hall's Cow-pens, half a mile from the railroad, a mile from Bay Minette. A party of cavalry crossed the road this morning at Bay Minette.

Please send over at once Company L, Vaiden Artillery, at Battery McIntosh. General Cockrell cannot do without them. Also send squad of the First Mississippi on steamer Virgin, two men at Colonel Winder's headquarters, and two at Battery Missouri.
