MAJOR: I have the honor to make the following report of the movements of my command this instant: I broke camp near Muddy Springs at 5. 30 a.m., and moved past Round Top across Twenty-five Mile Creek to the Camden road, striking it at a point about three miles distant from Ridgeway, and thence to the right along the Camden road to the intersectioin by the Rocky Mount road, down which I have moved my command two miles and placed it in position and bivouac on the south bank of Dutchman's Creek.

I have marched my division twenty-one miles, most of the route traversed being by private roads.

Very respectufully, your obedient servant,
