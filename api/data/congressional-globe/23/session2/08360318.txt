amendment of Mr Archer should be rejected
Some ounveisation ensued upon the question
before the House, and after an explanation fiom
Mr MASON, of Vugima, #ho was in the chair
in the Committee of the Whole on the state of the
Union on Saturday,
The SPEAKER informed the House that
the question would be on the amendment of Mr
Archer fiist, which is as follows
"Resolved, That in the just expectation that the
' Government of Fiance will have made provision,
' or will make provision for carry • g into effect
' the stipulations of the tieaty of indemnity with
' that Government of the 4 h of July, 1831, this
' House will foibearat the present time to adopt
' any measure in relation to that subject "
[The resolutions reported by Mi OambreleísG,
from the Committpe on Foreign Afiiirs, together
with the substitute proposed by Mr J Q. Aduis,
will be found on pege 309
Mr E EVERETT, who was entitled to the
floor, then addressed the House He said it was
not his intention originally to have said a word
on this subject, notwithstanding the situation he
occupied asa member of the Commit'ee on Foreign
Affairs He had had an opportunity of submit-
ting hi3 views to the House in a íeport, which it
had ordered to be printed, and, moreover, the state
of his health would not permit him to encounter
the fatigue necessary to make his voice heard in
that Hall In addition to this, theie was another
reason operating with greatei force upon his
mind, and that was, that it was almost impossible
to discuss this subject, whatever might be the
views of gentlemen on one side or tie other,
without saying that which, perhaps, lad better
not be said, for the public in'erest at home or
abioad He should be very bnef, for he felt how
pi eeious the time of the House v. as
When this question came before the Committee
on Fnieign Allans at the beginning of the session,
it v as on the recommendation of the Pi«sident of
the United States of an act of Congress oulenng
repii pis to Issue upon the comme ce of France
Mr E deemed that recommendation inexpedient
to be adopted !f the measure were expedient of
itself, what could be more inexpedient than to-
give the adveise paity timely notice of it,so as to
enable 1 mi to an icipate it? It was evident that
a n jjority of the committee thought with Ml E
on that pom', aid he considered it desirable that
a iepoit should be made theieon,m oidei that the
efiectof thit leeommendation might be counter
acted abroad The last despatches of Mr Liv
ingston showed the p opuety and justice of such
a course The mojonty of the committee, how-
ever, did not coincide, but tnought it expedient
not to report 1 hus the mattei stood till about a
week ago, when a leso'ution, substantially the
same as that now reported from the committee,
was pioposed in committee He understood the
cla'rman theieof [Mr Gavibreieng] to state the
other day that he had found it difficult to collect
the sense of the minority of the commu'ee on that
resolution Mi E had himself stated, over and
ovei again, that so far as the resolution went to
insist upon the obligation of the treaty, he fully
concurred in it, but he was distinctly opposed to
that part of it which went to shut'hedooi against
a'l negotiation In truth, he d.d not think it de-
suab'e that any resolut or atall should be adopted
by tie House, for he thought it exceedingly dif
ficult, if not nv >ossible, to frame any resolution
vh.cn the llou^e wou'd piss with ur auim.ty, and
v Inch it v ould 1 e J<_s i ib'e it should pass On
one occasion, vvl en tnc | en was piu into his hand
Jul   toe purpose of diafung suvh a icbolution as
he would be willing to have adopted, he declined
doing so, on the ground t'iat he telt himself inca-
pable of drafting such a resolution as l,e deemed
expedient, and tnat the House would adopt The
one presented to the House he i ever gave his
asseitto, nor had he concealed h.s opinions on
the subject m the committee There was then no
other course left to the minority but that which
they had adopted They set forth that the rec-
ommendation of reprisals was not concuired in
by the committee The same was the opinion of
Mr Livingston, who gaveitas his opinion that the
Tiench Chamber of Deputies would pass the bill
of appropuation, if Congress should not pass any
act of reprisals. This was the first point to which
the attention of the minority had been turned.
The next thing to be done was to show that, in
standing upon the treaty, we were not standing
upon a meie piece of paichment, but upon a bas a
of truth and justice, and that upon that ground we
would insist upon the stipulations of the treaty
The thud was the pioposmon embraced in the
President's last message, viz a recall of our Min-
ister from Fiance, and it was upon this that the
majority and minority of the committee mainly
differed. These views were fully set foith in the
report of the minority, which had been directed
to be pointed by the House
Thefouith point was, that at the present session
of Congress it was inexpedient to do any thing
further in legislation—leaving it to the considera-
tion and deliberation of the next Congiess Tt is
was his sentiment, his feeling, and judgment, but
■t was rot his resolution, nor did he submit ¡t as
such Mr E objected to the resolutions under
consideration for many reasons The words, "at
all hazards," he thought were supeifluous It
was always sufficient to use the woid " insist" till
theopoositeparty lefused He thought theformer
expiession rash, and uncalled for by the dignity
of the subject The resolution of the gentleman
fiom Virginia [Mr Archer] emoraced the senti-
ment of the minority. It was the serse of the
House, and ot the nation at lai¿e, that the treaty
should be insisted upon
The next question was a3 to the p dicy to be
pursued, and this was the most delicate question
of all lie was for moisting upon the treaty at all
hazards, but he was not foi enfoicing the tieaty at
all hazaids He was foi avoiding every thing of
an irritating character L was said ve could not
neonate iuithei, and thit far her negotiation
would not ensuie our insist.ng upon the treaty
He was at a loss to s*e the foice of this objection
In 1781 we negotia'cd, and in the negotiation in-
sisted upon our independence, and secured and
maintained it Supposingnegotiation failed Why
then h  would not go to war till ev- ry other ex-
pedient had been tued Commeicial restrictions
in favor ot Fiance might be removed If this
failed, we m ght go a step farther We might r.d
ouiseives of the contention of 16*22, and then we
might t ass i nor intercouiseact And if all filled
what shouid we tl en do' Still insist upon f>e ex-
ecution of i he treaty How, rfter every peaceful
lemedyhad fai'ed? There hf wot Id sop He
wou'd not look into the future The fortunes of
nat ons were subject to vicissitudes wh.ch no man
could foresee He would'eave that contingency
■ to a future Congress That was the last day but
one that his voice would, peihaps, be evei heaid
in that flail, and as a farewell sentiment, he would
tell 'hen, foi heaven's sake, to preserve peace
He was m the minority, but he appealed to the
majoi ty, as they puzed the esteem of their fe|.
'ow citizens, to preserve peace 11ns he would
say.to the President of the United States, if a
voice which 1 ad nevei ilatteied nor vilified could
reech his eais He respectfjlly abjured the Presi-
dent, whose J ower was greatei than that of any
Emperor or King in Chribtei do ), to pieseive
peace He admired, as did his íespected colleague,
th  spirit of the Pres dent, but moderation, pru-
dence, and discretion, veie qualities required in
such a crisis as this A prudent and temperate,
as well as a firm and decided course, was what
would best carry the country through, with honor
and glory, in a cusís hke the present
