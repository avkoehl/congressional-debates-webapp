CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
19
or common decency can the Secretary make this
discrimination i He had submit'ed the reso-
lution for the purpose of obtaining information for
his own guidance. If the offer made by the Se-
cretary of the Treasury is a mere matter of grace,
or a boon which he might give or withhold, he
would now =ay that he would not receive it, as he
had no idea of carrying home bags of gold derived
in this way He knew too well what his constitu-
ents suffered, and were suffering, and while they
v ere thus oppressed, he could not consent tobe
reaping a golden harvest through the cunning and
device of any executive ofhcer. He would entreat
the House to look at the position they occupied be-
fore the country Let us so conduct ourselves as
to rally around us the confidence of the people of
the country, an! pursue thatcour e which is calcu-
lated to lead to a speedy termination of the difficul-
ties under which the country is laboring Although
he could not oppose the amendment of the gentle-
man from Virginia, (Mi Robertson) still he de-
sired to have a vote taken on the simple proposition
he had submitted, as it was nothing more than a
plain question which he desired to have answered,
for the purpose of determining his own course in
relation to the matter
Mr. ROBERTSON submitted the amendment he
had before given notice of as follows
" Also, that he report, so far as ascertained, the
amount or specie received by the Government since
the first day of Mav last, the source from whence
denved, and th  amount from each, the regulations
under which the same, or any part thereof, has
been disbursed, the persons to vv horn paid, and the
sums paid to each, the amount now on hand, and
where deposited Also, whether since the date
above, the nublic dues, or any portion thereof,
have been íeceived in piotested drafts, or anj funds
oilier than thos  prescribed by the joint resolution
of 30th April, 1816"
Mr R expressed a hope that the honorable
mover of the resolution would accept the amend-
ment
Mr BIDDLE assented, and the resolution was
modified accordingly
Mr    HAMER said he believed  it was unusual
to debate a resolution of this character, which w as
merely proposing an inquiiy from one of the heads
of the department, but some of the remarks sub-
mitted by the gentlem-mfrom Pennsylvania seemed
to   require some slight notice       The lesolution
asked,   in    the  fust   phce,   whether   a   certim
letter said to be   wrmen to    the   Cli'rk of   this
House  he   or  be   not  genuine,   and,   secondly,
whether the Scerediy of the Treasury had made
other offers to   othei  claimants   of the Govern-
ment   similar  to    those   said   to    be   made   to
members   of Congress   in   that   communication
Now, Mr H. only meant then to say, that if the
House should adept this resolution, he had no
doubt the Secietarv would very promptly reply to
the inquiry, and ínlorrn them whether that letter be
genuine or not, and also what were his reasons for
making the offer    If the letter be genuine, he
would also respond to  the other inquiry embiaced
m the resolution     But it did seem to Mr H that it
would be but candid and fair, not only on the part
of the gei tieman from Pennsylvania, but of every
other gentleman there, to wait for the response ere
they undertook t"> condemn the Secretary    The
gentleman seemed to take it for granted, in the re-
marks submitted by him,  that this offer was a
boon held out  to members of Congress, an in-
ducement   held   out  to them,  to perpetuate the
present state of things    Now, so  far as he (Mr
H ) was concerned,  he had only to sa>, that he
had a much better opinion, a much higher opinion,
of the gentlemen who constituted that body, than
to beliei e, for a moment, that the poor, piltrj per
centage that might be made through a broker upon
the compensation they received there, would influ-
ence the course of any gentleman upon it at floor,
and he would add, that if he believed his consum-
en s entertained such an oomion of him, he would
re«ign before the going dovi n  of the sun    As to
the reso'utton, and the amendment now engiafted
upon it,  he  had no object on to the adoption of
both, and should vote for them.
Mr McKAY intended to vote for the adoption
of the resolution, but the gentleman from Pennsyl-
vania had thiown out some remarks that required
a brief explanation The gentleman had stated
that this offer was a mere matter of bounty, a
mere matter of grace, on the part of the Secretaiy
of the Treasury, and had even gone so far as to
say that its effect would be, if its design was not,
to perpetuate the present state of things in the
financial affairs of the country. Now, if the gen-
tleman had taken the trouble to look into the laws
of Congress, he would have seen that what the
Secretary had done was nothing more than a mere
matter of official duty, and did not pailake, m the
slightest degree, of either a grace or a bounty
The law passed in 1836—which was the rule of
the Government and all the Secretaries, the
Secretary of the Treasury in particular—expressly
providpd that the public creditors should be paid
either in gold or silver, or in that which was ib
equivalent and convertible into gold or silver on
the spot, etc This law applied as well to mem-
bers of Congress as to any other public creditors,
for they were onh a class of public creditors. If
the gentleman had also taken the trouble to look
into the report of the Secretary of the Treasury, he
would likewise have seen that in all the instructions
given to the dusbursmg officers, they had been
directed to pay out no funds except such as were
equivalent to specie, or which the public creditor
was willing to receive The gentleman had told ¡
the House that the States had been paid in depre-
ciated money The gentleman was also mistaken
in that for the Secretary of the Treasury, in his
instructions, had expressly stated what he would
read Mr M'K then read from the report the fol-
low tng passage from the Secretary's letter to the
Executives of the State*.
"PS It may be useful, in the present embar-
rassed condition of the pecuniary concerns of the
country and of the banks, to suggest that, for rea-
sons growing out of the deposite act, as well as the
existing, liabilities of the banks, and the obligations
requned from the States to the Tiea«tiry, no one
of thp latter is required to accept, on the within
transfers, any kind of money which is not avail-
ahle and at pai, and which it is not ready to ac-
count for in  the same way when required
" Should any of the banks, therefore, on which
the transfers are drawn, fail to deposite witn you
such money, they may be returned to this Depart-
ment, with a stitement of the fact, m order that the
case ma) be submitted to Congres at its approach-
ing session "
The same had been done with regard to all
other cases, of revolutionary «oldieis, the w i
do*s and orphans, and all other claimants of
the Government Tney were not bound,
unless they were willing to do so, to receive any
thing but gold oi silver, oi its equivalent That,
h  repeated, w as the law of 1836, and if the debtors
of the Government would do their duty it would
have been carried out in all cases That these
individuals had not done so was «ell known
Among other things, he had understood that some
of these very meichants who had been instrumental
in bringing about the suspension of «pecie pay-
ments, after having received indulgencies from the
Government, by an extension of their bonds, had,
m many instances, gone forward with their deben-
tures, drawn out the specie upon them, and then
gone and reviled that very Government, to which
they weie so much indebted At New Orleans, he
had understood, many of them had drawn the
specie from the custom-house on their debentures,
re-exported their goods, intending to reimport
them, and then get a credit on their bonds. How-
ever, he would not go further into this matter at
present
Those of them who had been there some time,
would recollect that, some vears ago, when the
Bank of the United States was struggling for a re-
chartei, one of thecharges preferied by a then gen-
tleman from Georgia, (Mr Clajton,) was, that it
afforded extraordmarj accomodations to members,
by furnishing them with drafts or bills of exchange
on teims different fiom those the} extended to
other creditors of the Gov eminent What was the
defence then made by the party to which the gentle-
man belonged?     Why, that it was all right then,
but now, when the Bank of the United States was\
not the Treasury, and Levi Woodbury, in his im-^
prudent letter, proposes nothing more than is war-
ranted and enjoyed by the plain and obvious spirit
and letter of the law, it is all wrong In the former
case, it was all right, now it was a matter merit-
ing the severest censure and reprobation.
Mr BIDDLE thought that the severest censure
which could be cast upon the Secretary of the
Treasury had been cast upon him by the gentleman
from North Carolina himself The gentleman had
told the House that the publication of that offer
was an "imprudent" thing, and therefore that the
members of the House should have been apprised
of the offer only as they went to receive their mo-
ney Now Mr B had cast no such censure upon
the Secretary On the contrary, he insisted that
the act of publication was a right and proper one.
The gentleman had leferred to the act of 1836
That act, however, was passed for the benefit of all
the public creditors, but no similar offer had been
made to any other class than members of Congress,
on the contrary, the Secretary had stated his inabi-
lity to pay them in specie What Mr. B. wanted
to know was, by what authority that officer took
upon himself the exercise of such tremendous
power as he had done in that offer
Mr. McKAY was not disposed to prolong this
discussion, though he could readily answer every
thing the gentleman had said. He would, however,
advert to one matter The gentleman had said
that no similar offer had been made to the States.
Now, one answer to that was, that there was  no
debt due to the States, for, by the terms of the depo-
site law, it was nothing more than a transfer of the
public money from one part of the Treasury, or
from one depository to another, in other words,
from the Federal Treasury to the Treasuries of the
several States, w Inch, for the time being, were con-
verted into a part or branch of the Federal Treasury.
It w as not necessary then to go further into that
part of the argument, but he would again refer the
gentleman to the letter before quoted by him, m
which it would be seen that the offer had been made
even to the States. fSee the "P S " quoted in
Mr M'K> foregoing remarks ]
With rpgard to the remark that Mr M'K con-
s dered the letter " imprudent," he only meant to
say that it w as so, so far a= regarded the Secretary's
reputation from its affording an opportunity to some
gentlemen to misinterpret his motives The letter
itself w as not imprudent in any other sense than its
being liable to misconstruction, for, he again re-
peated, it was in strict accoi dance with the law of
1836
Mi. BIDDLE again insisted that the letter re-
ferred to in his resolution was at variance with that
quoted by the gentleman from North Carolina, and
also that it gave an undue prefeience to the mem-
bers over othei claimants of the Government
The resolution, as modified, was then agreed to.
Mr BELL, on leave, then submitted the follow-
ing resolution
Réso'ved, That the Secretary of the Treasury be
directed, with as little delay as possible, to commu-
nicate to this House the amount of the appropria-
tions of the past and present vears remaining
unexpended the amount required to fulfil all
existing engagements contracted prior to the first
day of June last, and all existing engagements
contracted since that time, also, the amount of
money drawn from the Treasury and placed m the
hands of disbursing officers or agents on the first
day of May last and at the present time, and that
he also report what objects of public expenditure
can with the least injury to the public service be
either wholly dispensed with during the present
year, or bear any material reduction
The resolution having been read, and the Chair
remarking that, under the rule, it would have to lie
over one day,
Mr CAMBRELENG suggested to the honora-
ble mover, that as the information called for was
of a very important charaster, and ought to be in
possession of the House with as little delay as pos-
sible, to move a suspension of the rule, so as to
insure the immediate consideration of the reso-
lution.
Mr BELL said he w as about to ask that wdul-
