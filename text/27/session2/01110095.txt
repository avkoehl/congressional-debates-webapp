Committee of ihe Whole House on the state of the Union
Mr STÜVRT of Illinois moved to lay the bill on the table
Mr WISE calleJtfor the rea Imgof the bill
Mr ÍUshPH RwK\GERSOLC May I ask, also, that the

ble necessity of issuiug Treasury notes be read?
The bill and Setter were read accordingly
Mr FILLMORE asked the gentleman from Illinois to with
draw his motion to lay the bill on ihe table for a moment, to al
low him an oppormnuy for explanation
Mr STUART declined, on the ground that the necessities of
the Govemmentrequ¿red that «omethmg shouTd be done spee
dity, and that he wished to avoid the consumption of tine that
wou d be occasioned by the consideration of such a bill, as he
understood that most of the members of the House were com
muted against the issue ot Tieasury notes?
Mr FILLMORE said that there might be a majority opposed
to the issueof Ireasury notee but denied that all the members
were committed a^a nst it He hoped the Home would not <'e
cide against the bill without allowing an opportunity for ei.p'a
nation

CO^GRES^IONAt GJkOBE.
Mr SUMMERS, ofVirgmia, from the Committeeon the Ex-
penditures of the House of Representatives, made a report m
relation to the contingent expenditures of the House, which,
with the accompanying papers, was laid on the table and or
dered to be printed
Mr POWELL asked leave to present a petition, the object
of which was not heard
Mr ADAMS objec ed
Mr J C CLARK begged the mdulgenceof theHousetosend
to the Clerk's table a resolution on a subject in which they all
felt a common interest He held in his hand a document of
thirty two pages, some fifteen of which were perfectly useless
l bis evil ought to be corrected, otherwise the House would
have to increase its contingent fund There was hardly a
morning but they found papers on thpir tables which were of no
use at all It was time that charees of this sort should be ar
rested He therefore sent to the Clerk's table a resolution,
which was read, providing for the appointment of a select com
mittee on the subject of printing
Mr BRIGGS said, if the gentleman from New York had
wailed and «een the report uf the committee, jUbt Uidon the
table he would have discovered that the evil was therein pro
vided against
Mr CLARK then withdrew the resolution
Mr ARNOLt> said he believed his case now came up be
fore the Hou-e    [A laugh ]
Mr BOWNE demanded the yeas and nays on the question
of appeal, which were ordered by the House
The SPEAKER then stated the question He had under
stood the gentleman from New York [Mr Bowne] to call the
gentleman fiom Tennessee [Mr Arnold] to ordei ior nrele
vant remarks The Speaksr had overruled the point of or
der, deciding that although the remarks of the gentleman from
Tennessee w.ere, strictly, out of ordei, yet he could not arrest
them, after ttiedDbatr had been allowed such a latitude by the
Hnuse From this decision the gentleman from New York, had
taken an appeal to the Hou&e, and the question was now on
that appeal
Mi BOWNE observed that he would state to the House the
true question to be decided by the vote about to be taken, so
that it misht be perfectly understood The House would re
collect tbit a motion was made bv the chairman of the Com
mittee of Ways and Means [Mr Fillmoie] to reier so much
ofthe President's message asielates to the tariff to the Com
mittee on Manufactures, and that to that motion an amend
rrent was submitted by tne gentleman from New Hampshire
[Mr Atherton] to refer the subject to the Committee, of
Ways and Mean*! A discussion took place on the whole me
rits of the tariff question, the t,ubject of protecting duties, lis
cr minatng dunes, and in faetón almost every ques ion wh ch
had occupied the attention ofthe Hou^e, lasting some eight or
ten days Af ei this, the previous question wab moved and
sustained by the llou&e cutti g oft tht- deb ite, \nd lecidmat'ie
question Under the^-e circumstances, the gentkmm from
Tennessee vesteiday ino\ed a recoribideiationofthe voietaKen
on the genth.man iron New Hampshne's amendment, with
the avowed purpose, not of voting on it, but of makmga speech
irrelevart to that question, and then, in support of his motion,
wab proceeding wjth remarks personally insulting to two gen
tleman on that floor Oa this he, Mr B had called the gen
tleman to order, but the Speaker decided that though the gen
tieman's remaiks were not strictly m ordei, yet he mu&t be
permitted to proceed, because other gentlemen who preceded
him had spoken out of ordei From that decission he, Mr B
had appealed, and the question now was, whether the House
would sustain the decision of the Chair
A*ter some remarks from Mr STANLY,
Mr Ea¡sT\í AN said, that btfore the question was taken, he
deemed it his duty, as one of the delegation fiom the Mate of
New Hampshire, to state to the House he precise situation of
the case When the debate was going on upon the question of
reference his colleague [Mr Atherton] made a speech upon
his motion tu amend the resolution of the hnnoiable gent'eman
from New York [Mr Fillmore] In that speech no allusion
whatever was made to the State of Tennessee, to the district of
the gentleman from that state, [Mr Arnold ] nor to the gentle
min himself Afterhis colleague hadtaken bisseat, ind after
anothei gentleman had submitted some lemaiks, the gentle
man fiom Tennessee [Mr Arnold] obtained the /bor, an J
made a most violent and unpiovoked attack upon the State o(
NewHampsb re He (Mr E ) need not íepeatwhat the gen
tleman said, for it was fresh in the lecollection of all who heard
him The delegation from that State felt themselves cal ed
upon, by eveiy sense of íespect and regard !or heir state to
íepel at the very first opportunity the slanderous attack that
had been made upon hei Two or thiee attt rrpted to obtain
the floor, and his colleague [Mr Burke] having ben mo==t <mc
cessfu!,submittel the lemarks which he did ¡subsequently
when he (Mr E)hal the floor j pon the question ol rtieience
he took occasion to confiim the lemirks which had been made
by his col ea^n  , [Mr Blrke ] and ako added a few -.uo-ges ioi s
of hisowu With what success this unprovoked attack was
made upon the State of ISew Hampshire, and with what sue
cess it was repelled is for the House and the country to decido
But the Ilou&e will see that we were in no respect the aballan s,
but weie Inven to marie the defence which we did by the rude
assault of the gentleman from Tennessee And row «ir after
the ques ion of lefeience ha* been decided a d aftei the House
f has proceeded to the consideration of o her business the sen
i, tleman fiom Tennessee moves a reconsideration of the vote
upon the que lion of iereience, for the exprés and avowed
puip^se of answeung my co'league [Mr Blrke] and m> ell
Tor me, sn, lam willing that the gentleman shall have that
privilege to his heart s content, and I will vote to let him pto
ceed All I ask, «ir is, that the gentleman, after he has male
his remarks, will not withdraw his motion to reconsHei, but
give usan opportunity to reply to him, if we deem proper
Give us that chance, sir, and he may proceed as far as he
pleases
The Clerk then commenced calling the roll on tV question,
'Shall the decision of the Speakerstand as the judgment oí the
House? 'a id—
Mr Adams's name hating been called Mr A said he under
stood the question to be, whether thegent'eman from lennessee
TMr Arnold] ¡should be pern lttpfl to maVe a speech here m
duect defknee ol the rules o the House ind that the Speaker
had decided thai he should proceed in direct defiance ofthe
rule1*, because the Speaker had already peimitted oth is iu
speak m the same manner He could not vote to sustain the
Speaker m that position, because m doing ithe must vote in an
mhil&uon of th$ rules themselves. He held the Speaker respon
\
*
sible—the tule itself said he should be—for arresting any mem-
ber the moment he gets out of order, and the Speaker could not
justify a subsequent decision for violating the rules of tius ¡
House, because u had been done before It was intimately con-
nected with the existence of the rule itself, and therefore he
could not vote to sustain the Speaker's decision
The SPEAKER remarked that he had decided yesterday, in
the hurry ofthe moment, that this appeal was debatable, DAit
from further reference to the rules, he was satisfied that it was
not, appeals on questions of irrelevancy and personalty not be-
ing debatable And he would add that as the gentleman [Mr.
Adams] insisted on the rigid application of the rules, he would
call the gentleman to order
Mr ADAMS This is a new decision, is it? It stop 
me I say, ' No," then, to the support of the Speaker's de
cisión.
The question was then taken, and decided in the negative, as
follows Yeas 67, nays 89
Thus the appeal from the decision of the Speaker was sus.
tamed
Mr ARNOLD said he supposed he might now be allowed to
proceed in ordpr
Mr GENTRY moved that his colleague (Mr  Aenold] be
ermit'ed to proceed to the conclusion of his remarfes, unless
e should violate the rules of order to a greater degree than
the sewlemen from ISew Hampshire [Messrs  Eastman and
Burke] had done
The oPLAKER derided that the motion was not in order
After some conversation by Messrs GENTRY and WISE,
Mr W having made a motion that Mi A be allowed to pro-
ceed in order—which motion he did not pi ess, however—
The SPEAKERsaid that the gentleman fiom Tennessee [Mr.
Arnold] having been called to order only tor irrelevant re-
marks, would now be allowed to proceed in order.
Mi. Oil ARLES BROWN wished to make a suggestion to the
gentleman from Tennessee He thought the gentleman would
better effect his end, if he would let the vote on the reconsidera-
tionbe taken, and then, when they had reconsidered, the ¡sub-
ject would come up properly m dehate
Mr ARNOLD said he would endeavor to proceed in order
The SPEAKER «aid, to avoid furthei difficulty, he would
state to the gentleman that this was a meie question of reft,
rence, and bow afier the decision of the House, the debate
must be confined strictly to the limits of the rule
Mr ARNOLD bdul he had been afraid of that [Laughter ]
He wa^ of opinion that the motion mlfiiit be made to the House
that he snouldbe permitted to reply to the gentleman from New-
Ham pshne
Mr GILMER wished to make a suggestion to the gentleman
from Tennessee,
Mi ARNOLD said mat if he was not peimrtted to diaw a
prtidllLl between the wretchedness misery, and poveny ofNey
Hampshire and the pro^penty, buoyancy and hope of Tennes
*ee the oppcrtumty in discuss this question m the older now
allowed h m, woud avul him bu uttle If he could not do
thib, ho inHit os well die as gracefully as he could He might
not di  as Casar did, at the foot of Pompey's statue, but he
could say to the venetable gentleman fiom Massachusetts, "et
tu Btutri ' [Loud and continued laughter] In one respect,
however, he would follow the example ofthe gentleman from
New Hampshire in wilting outhis remarks, and he would reply
to a speech in wining that wab made in wilting He woule
theiefore withdraw his motion for recousifieiation, and he sup
po=ed they would adjourn and go home to their ihnneis
Mr HOPKIN S then moved that the House adjourn, but'with-
drew the motion foi a momenf at the request of—
Mi FILLMOAE, who ad íessedan i quny to the Speaker,
wl ich w t& no heaid, and m reply to which
The SPEAKER was understood to say that this was the
last of the thirty dajs of the session, when reports from com
mutees could be received in order
Mr MLLMOHE then «aid he hoped the committees would
be allowed to report before the House adjourned
The motion to adjourn was then lenewed and, prevailing,
The House adjourned
