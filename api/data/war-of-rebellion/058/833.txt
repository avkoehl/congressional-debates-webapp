the vicinity of Liverpool at once. Please say to General Jackson that I am very much in need of another section of artillery. I will not ask particularly for the other portion of King's battery, but if that cannot be given to me now I hope he will send some other.

I think I can prevent even gun-boats from coming up the river, unless they are accompanied by a very large land force of infantry.

I am, captain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

L. S. ROSS,

Brigadier-General.
