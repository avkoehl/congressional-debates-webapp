If these movements are successful, the enemy's fleet must retire from the harbor and inside the bar, the force at the lower end of the island and Black Island must surrender, and we can immediately throw over troops to re-enforce the party, secure the position and repair damages. This appears somewhat complicated as a measure of attack, but after a full consideration, I do not think any other promises so well. It depends upon secrecy and boldness of execution as well as careful judgment on such information as we can obtain. It ruins three steam-boats certainly, and if it fails, loses some 3,000 men. The advantages of success it is hardly necessary to speak of. We have often risked more on quite as hazardous expeditions, where less was to have been gained.

The above is the general outline. In arranging the details modifications may be made and ever step carefully considered. As an outline of the project it is respectfully submitted.
