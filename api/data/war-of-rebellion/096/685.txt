The Secretary of the Treasury has been informed that an attempt will be made to burn the Government cotton on State Island.

Lieutenant-General GRANT,

City Point, Va.:

General Sheridan's dispatch* to you of to-day, in which he says he "will be off on Monday," and that he" will leave behind about 2,000 men," causes the Secretary of War of War and myself considerable anxiety. Have you well considered whether you do not again leave open the Shenandoah Valley entrance to Maryland and Pennsylvania or at least to the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad?

A. LINCOLN.

WAR DEPARTMENT,

Washington City, February 25, 1865-12.30 p. m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT,

You were right in refusing a pass to the French consul through your lines. In the present condition of things the Department recognizes the right of no one to pass through our lines, unless in the service and by your direction.

E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.
