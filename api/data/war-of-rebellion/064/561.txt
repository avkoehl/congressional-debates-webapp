LITTLE ROCK, ARK., June 26, 1864.

Major General F. STEELE:

SIR: By the request of His Excellency Governor Murphy, allow me to inform you that the country in the vicinity of Dardanelle is infested with bushwhackers of the worst character, who are committing depredations upon the families of loyal men daily. On my return from Fort Smith I stopped at and in the vicinity of Dardanelle ten or twelve days, waiting for an opportunity to come through to my command. During the time I remained there concealed in the brush I learned the condition of the loyal people to some considerable extent.

They are robbing the people of everything necessary to sustain life and telling them to leave the country or they will burn their houses. There are a number of families at Dardanelle who were compelled to move there for protection while our troops were there (mostly soldiers' families), and are now without medical aid, and not enough of men in town to bury the dead. Without relief soon, unless bushwhackers cease to plunder and abuse them, they will be destitute of subsistence and compelled to suffer, and after bearing what I have, also having a family there among them, I am willing to use every exertion in my power to drive them from the country.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOEL BROWN,

Captain Company A, Fourth Arkansas Cavalry Volunteers.

Brigadier General E. A. CARR, Devall's Bluff:

The following dispatch received this morning from Colonel Clayton:

The information in regard to Dockery corresponds with news we have had from that quarter. I think there is a large force at Monticello. Should have recommended an advance from this post had we had sufficient to make it safe.
