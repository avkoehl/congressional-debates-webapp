First. The quotas of this District under the call of the President are as follows:

Quota under calls of 1861 ............................... 3,235

Quota under call of July, 1862 .......................... 1,771

Quota under call of 1862 (300,000 nine-months" volunteers) 1,771

Total ................................................... 6,777

Second. Had a quota been assigned to the District it would have been 6,777.

Third.

Fourth. There is no rule of the Enrolling Bureau that prevents the District from obtaining credit for the troops furnished.

Fifth. The District of Columbia is on the same footing with the States, and entitled to the same rights relative to furnishing troops under the calls of the President.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

HENRY E. MAYNADIER,

Captain, U. S. Army, in Charge of Enrollment Bureau.
