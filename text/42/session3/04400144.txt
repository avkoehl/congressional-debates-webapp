REDUCTION OF INTERNAL REVENUE EXPENSES.
Mr. SHERMAN. Is the morning business
through ?
The VICE PRESIDENT. It has concluded.
Mr. SHERMAN. 1 move, then, that the
Senate proceed to the consideration of House
bill No. 2994, the revenue bill which I reported
yesterday.
The motion was agreed to ; and the Senate,
as in the Committee of the Whole, proceeded
to consider the bill (H. R. No. 2994) for the
reduction of officers and expenses of the in-
ternal revenue.
The bill was read.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Secretary
will now report the amendments of the Com-
mittee on Finance. Unless objected to, these
smendtoentg will be regarded as agreed to as
they are read.
Mr. SHERMAN. Before the Secretary re-
ports those amendments, perhaps I had better
state briefly the purpose of this bill.
The object of the bill is to supersede section
forty-three of the act of last session. That
act provides that on the 1st of January of next
year the President shall reduce the number of
revenue districts to eighty. The Commis-
sioner of Internal Revenue in preparing to
earry into execution this provision of the law
found that it would create very serious em-
barrassment in the collection of the revenue ;
that the districts would be so enlarged as to
remove from the tax-payers at some distance
both the collector and assessor, and in the
western States especially it would make it
exceedingly difficult to have the special taxes
collected. Study and examination of the sub-
ject led him to the conclusion that it would be
far better to abolish one half of the officers of
internal revenue rather than to enlarge the
districts.
It was found upon examination that the vari-
ous changes in the revenue laws had abol-
ished nearly all the duties of assessors and
assistant assessors The objects of taxation
are now confined to whisky, tobacco, beer,
and a few stamp taxes which collect them
selves, leaving the duties to be performed by
assessors and assistant assessors very small
indeed in proportion to the amount of their
pay and compensation. The whole expense
of assessing the internal revenue last, year
amounted to two millions seven hundred and
