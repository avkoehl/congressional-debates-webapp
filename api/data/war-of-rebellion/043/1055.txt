PRESSED THE GREATEST SATISFACTION AT THE CONDUCT OF THE REGIMENT. TOWARD THE CLOSE OF THE ENGAGEMENT, COLONEL WYNDHAM RECEIVED A BULLET WOUND IN THE CALF OF THE LEG, BUT WE ARE THANKFUL TO KNOW THAT IT WILL NOT PROVE DANGEROUS. HE KEPT THE FIELD FOR SOME TIME AFTER BEING HIT, BUT WAS FINALLY OBLIGED TO GIVE UP. HE GOES TO WASHINGTON TO-DAY. WE HOPE HE WILL SOON RETURN, AS HE CAN ILL BE SPARED FROM HIS COMMAND. HE ALSO PAID THE REGIMENT THE HIGHEST COMPLIMENTS FOR ITS STEADY AND DASHING CHARGES. THE FIGHT WAS HAND TO HAND THROUGHOUT. WE HAD IN THE ENGAGEMENT 4 FIELD OFFICERS, 14 LINE OFFICERS, AND 281 ENLISTED MEN. OUR LOSS IN KILLED, WOUNDED, AND MISSING IS AT PRESENT 3 FIELD OFFICERS, 2 LINE OFFICERS, AND 52 ENLISTED MEN. THIS OF ITSELF SPEAKS VOLUMES FOR THE BRAVERY OF THE REGIMENT. THE MORALE OF THE REGIMENT HAS BEEN GREATLY BENEFITTED BY YESTERDAY'S WORK, AND I AM CONFIDENT THAT THE MEN WILL FIGHT BETTER NOW THAN EVER. MAJOR BEAUMONT WILL PROBABLY BE SOON RELIEVED FROM HIS PRESENT COMMAND TO ASSUME THAT OF THE REGIMENT, AND WILL BE ABLE TO COLLECT FULLER ACCOUNTS OF THE CAPTURE AND WOUNDS OF THE MISSING OFFICERS THAN I AM ABLE NOW TO DO.

I HAVE THE HONOR TO BE, GOVERNOR, VERY RESPECTFULLY, YOUR OBEDIENT SERVANT,

HUGH H. JANEWAY,

MAJOR, COMMANDING FIRST NEW JERSEY CAVALRY.

ON THE MORNING OF JUNE 17, 1863, THIS REGIMENT, OF ABOUT 275 MEN, COLONEL DUFFIE COMMANDING, MOVED FROM MANASSAS JUNCTION, WITH ORDERS FROM GENERAL KILPATRICK (IN WHOSE BRIGADE IT WAS THEN SERVING) TO PROCEED THROUGH THOROUGHFARE GAP TO MIDDLEBURG, AND COMMUNICATE WITH HIM BY MESSENGERS AT ALDIE, AT WHICH PLACE HE COULD BE FOUND WITH HIS BRIGADE, REMAINING AT MIDDLEBURG THE NIGHT OF THE 17TH, TO PROCEED THROUGH SNICKERSVILLE AND PURCELLVILLE AND REJOIN THE BRIGADE AT NOLAN'S FERRY.

AT THOROUGHFARE GAP A FORCE OF THE ENEMY'S CAVALRY WAS ENCOUNTERED, ESTIMATED AT 300, AND DRIVEN TOWARD SALEM. THE REGIMENT THEN TURNED TO THE RIGHT AND PASSED THROUGH HOPEWELL TO MIDDLEBURG.
