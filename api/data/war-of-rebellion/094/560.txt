Lieutenant-General GRANT,

City Point:

I will at once send Colonel Parsons to the West to take charge of the transportation of Schofield's corps. No doubt it will be best on move the whole body by boats from Eastport to Parkersburg, if the navigation allows, and thence by Baltimore and Ohio Railroad to Annapolis. When Hooker's force went to Tennessee all were moved over that road with great promptness and success. A capital advantage of that line is that it avoids all large towns. If the Ohio River should be frozen they can be moved by rail from Cairo, Evansville, or Jeffersonville to Parkersburg or Bellaire, according to circumstances. Your orders says nothing about artillery; I think that had better be left behind. If the men are need they can come and find new batteries and horses here.

C. A. DANA,

Assistant Secretary of War.
