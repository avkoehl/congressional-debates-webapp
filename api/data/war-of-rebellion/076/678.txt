Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: I have the honor to report that I have to-day assumed the command of the Twentieth Corps. The corps is in position as directed, at Pace's, Montgomery's, and Turner's Ferries, and intrenched. Yesterday afternoon Geary's division, at Pace's Ferry, had some sharp skirmishing with the enemy's cavalry, capturing a few prisoners. My headquarters are near the railroad bridge.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. W. SLOCUM,

[Indorsement.]

Respectfully forwarded as a partial answer to Captain Dayton's note of this evening.

No report has been received of any firing in that direction to-day.

WM. D. WHIPPLE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HDQRS. FIRST DIVISION, TWENTIETH ARMY CORPS,August 27, 1864.

Captain S. E. PITTMAN,

Acting Aide-de-Camp, Twentieth Army Corps:

I am directed by General Knipe to inform you that the picket-line of this division is continuous, and extends along the whole front of the division; that the picket-line does not connect with General Geary's, though a connection can be easily made by throwing forward the right of General Geary's picket-line, connecting with the line of this division near Howell's Mill road and in front of the hill now occupied by Colonel Pardee. The citizen spoken of came through our line at Moore's Mill.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JAMES FRANCIS,

Major and Acting Assistant Inspector-General.

His headquarters are in the vicinity of W. Holbrook's, fronting East Point and Atlanta. General Thomas desires daily reports from you while conforming to the movements of General Schofield.
