Captain NORTON:

To-day I see camps in woods back of Morton's house extending nearly a mile to our right and a half mile to our left of that point. The force at Raccoon Ford is not as large as appeared yesterday. I see cavalry camps between Raccoon and Morton's Fords. There is cavalry in the old camp at Somerville Ford. The old camps at Rapidan Station and along the railroad are again occupied. the enemy's cavalry can again be seen at the mouth of Robertson's and along the Locust Dale road. See no force of enemy on this side of Rapidan between Rapidan Station and Morton's Ford. Saw this p.m. a small body of enemy's cavalry, near Cedar Mountain.

Colonel C. ROSS SMITH,

The demonstration made by the enemy yesterday evening on the right of my line was merely to ascertain the strength of my pickets. They were driven back across the river after a brisk skirmish, without loss on either side. I will send you a sketch of my line soon. Everything is quiet along my front to-day.
