THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
March 21,
tion of the committee to the amendment directly
under discussion. I am opposed to this amend-
ment. I consider it wronj; m principle, and to
adopt it, is to sanction a precedent which leads to
the substitution of the will of an Executive officer
for law. The gentleman from Ohio [Mr. Crow-
ell] expresses great horror at the idea of usurp-
ation. He has rung all the changes on that word.
Well, Mr. Chairman, it is the very word which
defines the action of the Secretary of the Interior;
but 1 care nothing for words, or terms, but
ideas. The Secretary of the Interior is an Exec-
utive officer, and therefore bound to carry out the
will of Congress, as expressed in its proper form.
He has no power to appoint a clerk, without the
authority of Congress first had and obtained. In
this case, Congress not only did not authorize the
appointment of the clerks in question, but ex-
pressly declared no additional clerk should be
employed; yet the Secretary of the Interior—in
the teeth of that law—has appointed the additional
clerks in question. Is not this usurpation? Yes,
sir; usurpation of the powers of Congress, which
alone can create new officers. But this gentleman
from Ohio is rather behind the excitement, and
should have listened to the argument of his col-
league, [Mr. Vinton ] Ele does not pretend that
the Secretary has actcd by virtue of any law, but
he places his justification on the ground of neces-
sity—the indispensable necessity of discharging
the public business. A simple statement will
enable us to appreciate the force of this plea.
When this office was created, several different bu-
reaus were thrown together, with all the clerical
force connected with those departments. The
force was sufficient, under the old arrangement, to
do all the business. An additional Secretary, with
a chief clerk, is created by the law of 1849; yet
we are gravely told, that so stern is the necessity
for this increase of clerical force, that the busi-
ness the country cannot be performed without
it.
The CHAIR announced that the hoar had
arrived at which, under the resolution of the
House, all debate on the bill must terminate.
The rule of the House, however, provides that
the member reporting a measure, may close the
debate, under the limitation of the one hour rule.
Mr. BAYLY, (who had reported the bill from
the Committee of Ways and Means,) availing
himself of his right, under the rule, took the floor;
but yielded at the request of
Mr. THOMPSON, of Mississippi, who pro-
ceeded wnh his explanations.
Mr. HAMPTON asked leave to interrupt Mr.
Thompson.
Mi*. THOMPSON said: I anticipate the point
the gentleman intends to make, that all the clerks
anticipated had not been transferred.
Mr. HAMPTON. Not exactly. The eleventh
section of the law, creating the office of Secretary
of the Interior, only required the Secretary of the
Treasury to transfer the necessary clerks in the
office proper of the Secretary of the Interior, but
did not lequire the other secretaries to do the
same; while all the bureaus, except the General
_ Land Office, were transferred from the other Sec-
retaries.
Mr. I\ continued. The explanation is this:
there were clerks in the office of the Secretary of
the Treasury, who were employed partly on the
business transferred to the new Secretary, and
partly on other business. But when this business
was thus abstracted, there was no new organiza-
tion of the clerkships, except thiowing together
the remnants of business into the hands of a single
clerk, and thus dividing out the clerks suited to
the new arrangement. But it seems to have cre-
ated the necessity for new officers and new clerks,
leading all the while to an increase of patronage.
But suppose the gentleman from Ohio [Mr. Vin-
ton] is ri^ht, that unless we make an allowance,
as called for by the amendment, the public busi-
ness cannot be performed, I have a better remedy
than the one he proposes, and that is, repeal the
Department of the Interior as useless—as worse
than useless—being absolutely in the way of the
transaction of public business. There has been
no increase; and under the old arrangement, the
old clerical force kept up with the demands of the
public with as much correctness, fidelity, and
promptness, as they have done since. I hope he
will join me on his own principles and arguments
m 8tr,kwg down this Home Department. It is |
un necessary—it is consolidating—it is dangerous—
it is now admitted, inadvertently,as useless. But
I regret that I cannot now present at full length
my objections to this law of last session. It was
then passed as a relief to the Treasury Depart-
ment; but after all, only one bureau—that of the
-General Land Office—was transferred to this
Home Department. Previous to this transfer, the
public lands were regarded as a source of reve-
nue; since that transfer, they are regarded as
such no longer; but on the contrary, as a great
corruptive fraud, with which demagogues are at-
tempting to bid for the highest offices in the gift of
the people. The other Secretaries never com-
plained of the extent and oppressiveness of their
duties, from which they have been relieved by
this Home Department.
On yesterday I was drawn into some re-
marks as to the number of officers in the depart-
ments at Washington. I have not regarded this
as a matter of much consequence, unless it be
merely to prove the hollowness of the professions
of men seeking power, and the more especially,
the duplicity and deception of the present rickety
dynasty. 1 have but little doubt, that a majority
of those holding office in this city, during any
Administration, are profoundly supporters and
friends of that Administiation. Indeed, many of
the clerks, and those too efficient ones—to use the
common parlance of the day—have no politics
whatever; but by comparing the past with the
present, it will be perceived that no Administration
has gone further in removing opponents, and
rewarding friends, than the present one.
The gentleman from Ohio [Mr. Crowell] re-
marked this morning, his desire to correct the
truth of history. On the contrary, for the purpose
of vindicating and asserting the truth of history,
I desire to lay before the House a statement
which has been furnished by a reliable gentleman,
who was well acquainted with the incumbents in
office at the expiration of the last Administration.
Mr. TAYLOR inquired, by whom was the
statement made out?
Mr. THOMPSON replied: The gentleman who
furnished me this statement was formerly connected
with the Go\ ernment, but is so no longer. He is a
gentleman of intelligence and personal worth; and
though it is not altogether full, yet I consider it
reliable, so far as it goes. I give the statement as
showing the relative number of Whigs and Dem-
ocrats in office on the 3d of March, 1849; and I
wish I could add to it a statement of their relative
numbers, at present under an Administration
which obtained power with professions of neu-
trality between the parties. I have only one bu-
reau under the control of the Secretary of the In-
tenor, and that comes down only to the first of
August, 1849—1 mean the General Land Office.
The whole number of chief clerks employed in
the several offices when the present Administration
came into power, on the 4th of March, 1849, was
31; of which, 21, receiving an aggregate salary of
$36,500, were Whigs, and 10, receiving an aggre-
gate salary of $18,200, were Democrats. °

On the 1st of August, 1849, the force in the
General Land Office was so far changed as to stand
57 Federalists at $64,850, to 34 Democrats at an
aggregate of $40,500.
[During the reading of this statement, there were
various interruptions, Mr, T. having been several
times called to order, and once or twice stopped in
the reading.] rr
Mr. TAYLOR said, that if the gentleman from
Virginia, [Mr. Bayly,] would allow him a few mo-
ments to explain what he said yesterday on the
subject, and to repjy to the gentleman from Missis-
sippi , he should feel greatly obliged to him.
Mr. BAYLY said he would yield the floor, as he
had yielded to the gentleman from Mississippi.
Mr. TAYLOR. Mr. Chairman, I said yester-
day, in the course of the debate on the amendment
offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania, [Mr.
Hampton,] that I had been informed, and 1 be-
lieved, that notwithstanding the charges made
against the Administration, and especially against
the Secretary of tnc Interior, of making more ie-
movals for political purposes than any foimer Ad-
mistration, that there were now, at this day, more
Locofocos in office, in the general departments, in
the City of Washington, than Whigs. And now,
sir, since the gentleman from Mississippi [Mr.
Thompson] has produced, in ►confirmation of his
denial of what 1 said yesterday, on this subject, a
statement from some person, whose name he does
not give, I propose to give to the House the result
of my inquiries this morning, i have myself no
personal knowledge on this subject, but I have
before me a statement, furnished at my request by
one of the clerks of a department, and by another
gentleman, not in office, but intimately acquainted
with the public offices here, and in which state-
ment, I have reason to place entire confidence, and
from which I will read, and publish in full in the
report of our proceedings.
