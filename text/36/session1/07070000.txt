THE OFFICIAL PROCEEDINGS OF CONGRESS, PUBLISHED BY JOHN C. RIVES, WASHINGTON, D. C.
Tiiibty-Sixth Congress, 1st Session.
TUESDAY, JUNE 5, 1860.
New Series No. 163.
Their territory is more extensive, stretching over
851,448 square miles, while the Free States, in-
cluding California, embrace only 612,597 square
miles. Here is a difference of more than 238,000
square miles in favorof the Slave States,showing
that Freedom starts in this great controversy with
a field more than a quarter less than that of Sla-
very. In happiness of climate, adapted to pro-
ductions of spccial value; in exhaustless motive
power distributed throughout its space; in natural
highways, by more than fifty navigable rivers,
never closed by the rigors of winter, and in a stretch
of coast along ocean and gulf, indented by hos-
pitable harbors—the whole presenting incompar-
able'advantages for that true civilization where
agriculture, manufactures, and commerce, both
domestic and foreign, blend—in all these respects
the Slave States excel the Free States, whose cli-
mate is often churlish, whose motive powei is less
. various, whose navigable rivers are fewer, and
often sealed by ice, and whose coast, while less
in extent and with fewer harbors, is often perilous
from storm and cold.
But Slavery play* the part of a Harpy, and
defiles the choicest banquet. See what it does
with this territory, thus spacious and fair.
'An important indication of prosperity is to be
found in the growth of population. In this respect
the two regions started equal. In 1790, at the
first census under the Constitution, the popula-
tion of the present Slave States was 1,961,372,of
the present Free Slates 1,968,455, showing a dif-
ference of only 7,083 in favor of the Free States.
This difference, at first merely nominal, has been
constantly increasing since, showing itself more
strongly in each decennial census, until, in 1850,
the population of the Slave States, swollen by the
annexation of three foreign Territories, Louis-_
iana, Florida, and Texas, was only 9,612,769,"
while that of the Free States, without any such
annexations, reached 13,434,922, showing a dif-
ference of 3,822,153, in favor of Freedom. 'But
this difference becomes still more remarkable, if
we confine our inquiries to the white population,
which, at this period, was only 6,184,477 in the
Slave States, while it was 53,238,670 in the
Free States, showing a difference of more than
7,054,193 in favor of Freedom, and showing that
the white population of the Free States had not
only doubled, but commenced to triple that of the
Slave States, although occupying a smaller terri-
tory. The comparative sparseness of the two
populations furnishes another illustration. In the
Slave States the average number of inhabitants to
a square mile was 11.28, while in the Free States it
was 21.93, or almost two to one in favor of Free-
dom.
These results are general; but if we take any
particular Slave State, and compare it with a Free
State, we shall find the same constant evidence
for Freedom. Take Virginia, with a territory of
61,352 miles, and New York, with a territory of
47,000, or over 14,000 square miles less than her
sister State. New York has one sea-poi t, Vir-
ginia some three or four; New York has one
noble river, Virginia has several; New York for
400 miles runs along the frozen line of Canada;
Virginia basks in a climate of constant felicity.
But Freedom is better than climate, rivers, or sea-
port!
In 1790, the population of Virginia was 748-,308,
and in 1850, it was 1,421,661. In 1790, the pop-
ulation of New York was 340,120, and m 1850, it
was 3,097,394; that of Virginia had not doubled in
sixty years, while that of New York had multiplied
more than liine-foltk A similar comparison may
be made between Kentucky, with 37,680 square
miles, admitted into the Union as long ago as
1790, and Ohio, with 39,964 square miles, admit-
ted into the Union in 1802. In 1850, the Slave
State had a population of only 982,405, while
Ohio had a population of 1,980,329, showing a
difference of nearly a million in favorof Freedom.
As in population, so also in the value of prop-
erty, real anil personal, do the Free States excel
the Slave States. According to the census uf
1850, the value of property in the Free States
163
was $4,107,162,198, while in the Slave States-it
was §2,936,090,737; or, if we deduct the asserted
property in human flesh, only §1,655,945,137—
showing an enormous difference of billions in
favor of Freedom. In the Free States the valua-
tion per acre was $10 47, in the Slave States only
§3 04. This disproportion was still greater in
1855, according to the report of the Secretary of
the Treasury, when the valuation of the Free
States was $5,770,194,680; or $14 72 per acre;
and of the Slave States, $3,977,353,946; or, if
we deduct the asserted property in human flesh,
$2,505,186,346, or §4 59 per acre. Thus, in five
years from 1850, the valuation of property in the
Freo States received an increase of more than the
whole accumulated valuation of the Slave States
at that time.
Looking at details, we find the same dispropor-
tions. Arkansas and Michigan, equal ill terri-
tory, were admitted into the Union in the same
year; and yet, in 1855, the whole valuation of
Arkansas, including its asserted property in human
flesh, was only §64,240,726, while that of Michi-
gan, without a single Slave, was §116,593,580.
The whole accumulated valuation of all the Slave
States, deducting the asserted property in human
flesh, in 1850, was only $1,655,945,137; but the
valuation of New York alone, in 1855, reached
the nearly equal sum of $1,401,285,279. The val-
uation of Vngima, North and South Carolina,
Georgia, Florida, and Texas, all together, in
1850, deducting human flesh, was $573,332,860,
or simply $1 81 per acre, being less than that of
Massachusetts alone, which was §573,342,286, or
$114 85 per acre.
The Slave States boast of agriculture; but here
again, notwithstanding their superior natural ad-
vantages, they must yield to the Free States at
every point, in the number of farms and planta-
tions; m the number of acres of improved lands;
in the cash value of farms; ill the average value
per acre; and in the value of farming implements
and machinery. Here is a short table:
Free States.—Number of farms, 877,736; acres
of improved land, 57,688,040; cash value of farms,
$2,143,344,437; average value per acre, $19 83;
value of farming implements, $85,736,658.
Slave Stales.—Number of farms, 564,203; acres
of improved land, 54,970,427; cash value of (arms,
$1,117,649,649; average value per acre, §6 18; value
of farming implements, $65,345,625. .
Such is the mighty contrast. But it does not
stop here. Careiul tables place the agricultural
products of the Free States, for the year ending
June, 1850, at $858,634,3114, while those of the
Slave States were $631,277,417; the product per
acre in the Free States at $7 94, and the product
per acre in the Slave States at $3 49; and the av-
erage product of each agriculturist in the Free
States at $342, and in the Slave States at $171.
Thus, the Free States, with a smaller population
engaged in agriculture than the Slave State's, with
smaller territory, show an annual sum total of
agricultural products surpassing those of the Slave
States by two hundred twenty-seven millions of
dollars, while twice as much is produced on an
acre, and more than twice as much is produced
by each agriculturist. The monopoly of cotton,
nee, and cane sugar, with a climate granting two
and sometimes three crops m a year, are thus
impotent in the competition with Freedom.
In manufactures, the failme ot the Slave States
is greater still. It appears at all pokits, in the
capital employed, in the value of the raw mate-
rial, in the annual wages, and in the annual prod-
uct. A short table will show the contrast:
Free States.—Capital, §430,240,051; value of
raw material, $465,844,082; annual wages,
<195,976,453; annual product, $842,586,058.
" Slave States.—Capital, $95,029,879; value of
raw material, $86,190,639; annual wages,
$33,257,360; annual product, 0165,413,027.
This might be illustrated by details with regard
to different manufactures—whether of shoes, cot-
ton, woolen, pig iron, wrojght iron, and iron
castings—all showing the contrast. It might also
be illustrated by a comparison between different
States; showing, for instance, that the manufac-
tures of Massachusetts, during the last year, ex-
ceeded those of all the Slave States combined.
In commerce, the failure of the Slave States is
on yet a larger scale. Under this head, the census
does not supply proper statistics, and we are left,
therefore, to approximations from other quarters;
but these are enough for our purpose. It ap-
pears that, of the products which enter into com-
merce, the Free States had an amount valued at
$1,377,199,968; the Slave States an amount valued
only at $410,754,992; that of the persons engaged
in trade, the Free States had 136,856, and the
Slave States 52,622; and that of the tonnage em-
ployed, the Free States had 2,790,195 tons, and
the Slave States only 726,285 tons. This was in
1850. But in 1855 the disproportion was still
greater, the Free States having 4,252,015 tons, and
the Slave States 855,517 tons, being a difference
of five to one; and the tonnage of Massachusetts
alone being 970,727 tons, an amount larger than
that of all the Slave States. The tonnage built
during this year by the Free States was 528,844
tons, by the Slave States, 52,959 tons. Maine
alone built 215,905 tons, or more than four times
the whole built in the Slave States.
The foreign commerce, as indicated by the ex-
ports and imports in 1855, of the Free States, was
$404,368,503; of the Slave States, $132,067,216.
The exports of the Free States were $167,520,693;
of the Slave States, including the vaunted cotton
crop, $132,007,216. The imports of the Free
States were $236,847,810: of the Slave States,
$24,586,528. The foreign commerce of New York
alone was more than twice as large as that of all
the Slave Statts; her imports were larger, and
her exports were larger also. Add to this testi-
mony of figures the testimony of a Virginian, Mr.
Loudon, ni a letter written just before the sitting
of a Southern Commercial Convention. Thus he
complains, and testifies:
" Theie ate not half a dozen voxels engaged in our own
trade thru nio owned in Virginia; and I have, been unabie
to find a vessel at Liverpool loading Cor Virginia within
three year^, during the height ol our busy seabOll."
Raiiroads and canals are the avenues of com-
merce; and here again the Free States excel. Of
railroads in operation in 1854, there were 13,105
miles in the Free States, and 4,212 in the Slave
States. Of canals there were~3,682 miles in the
Free States, and 1,116 in the Slave States.
The Post Office, which is not only the agent of
commerce, but of civilization, joins in the uniform
testimony. According to the tables for 1859, the
postage collected in the Free States was $5,532,999,
and the expense of carrying the mails, $6,748,189;
leaving a deficit of $1,215,189. In the Slave States
the amount collected was only $1,988,050, and
the expense of carrying the mails$0,016,G12, leav-
ing the enormous deficit of $4,028,568; the differ-
ence between the two deficits being $2,813,372.
The Slave States did not pay one third of the
expense of transporting their mails, and not a
single Slave State paid for the transportation of
its mails—not even the small State of Delaware.
Massachusetts, besides paying for hers, had a
surplus; larger than the whole amount collected
in South Carolina.
According to the census of 1850, the value of
chutches in the Fiee States was $67,773,477; in
the Slave States, $21,674,581.
The voluntary charity contributed in 1855, for
certain leading purposes of Christian benevolence,
was- in the Free States, $953,813, for the same
purposes in the Slave States, $194,784. For the
Bible cause: the Free States contributed $319,667;
the Slave States, $68,125. For the missionary
cause: the first contributed $319,667; and the sec-
ond, $101,934. For the Tract Society: the first
contributed $131,972; and the second, $24,725.
The amount contributed in Massachusetts for the
support of missions was greater than that con-
tributed by all the Slave States, and more than
ei"ht times that contributed by South Carolina.
"Nor have the Free States been backward m
charity, when the Slave States have been smitten.
The records of Massachusetts show that as long
