HEADQUARTERS SIXTEENTH ARMY CORPS, Memphis, Tennessee, November 4, 1863.

S. A. HURLBUT,Major-General.

COLLIERVILLE, November 4, 1863.

Major-General HURLBUT:

I am directed by Colonel Hatch to report to you that he is in the vicinity of Quinn's Mill, on the Coldwater; that the enemy, about 3,000 strong, confront him from the opposite side of the river. Colonel H. has about 1,400 men. He does not think it wise to move his command far from the line of the railroad. I have couriers by which I can rapidly transmit any communication you may desire to make.

W. P. HEPBURN,

Lieutenant Colonel Second Iowa Cavalry, Comdg. U. S. Forces.
HEADQUARTERS CAVALRY DIVISION, South of Byhalia, November 4, 1863.

Major-General HURLBUT:

We find the enemy, consisting of Starke's, McCulloch's, McGuirk's, Slemons', and George's regiments, and Chalmers' battalion, all under command of General Chalmers, are fleeing for the Tallahatchie, and have so much the start that pursuit would be fruitless. Richardson is still north of this point, with, according to the best information obtained, about 1,000 men.

On arriving here this morning we found that Chalmers' whole command had passed during the night; the rear passed about 4 o'clock this a.m. Chalmers had six pieces of artillery with him, and two regiments not enumerated above, the numbers or names of commanding officers not being known.

Your obedient servant,EDWARD HATCH,

Colonel, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS SIXTEENTH ARMY CORPS, Memphis, Tennessee, November 4, 1863.

Lieutenant-Colonel HEPBURN, Second Iowa Volunteer Cavalry, Collierville, Tennessee:

Inform Colonel Hatch that Mizner is in rear of the enemy, and must find out if they have made a stand. McCrillis is somewhere on the left and will join Hatch or Mizner. Let him hold them until he finds they are shaken from either side and then attack and endeavor to open communication with Mizner and McCrillis.

S. A. HURLBUT,

Major-General.
