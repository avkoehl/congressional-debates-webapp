You will come on to Knoxville with all possible dispatch to meet Forrest, who is operating in Middle Tennessee. When you reach Knoxville you will be directed by Black [Sherman] or myself what course to take. You will hasten on rapidly as possible, as it is very important Forrest should be checked at once.
