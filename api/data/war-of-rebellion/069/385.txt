more than a skirmish line of the enemy. If there is any position across the stream which can be held by the main line securely, it will be taken up, but great care must be taken to clear the front as far as possible by strong skirmish lines before making the crossing with the main force. Corps headquarters will be for the present on the Richmond road, near the Shelton house.

COMMANDING OFFICERS OF DIVISIONS:

The orders issued this evening, directing the divisions of the corps to be withdrawn to the position on this side the creek, are hereby recalled. The troops will occupy their present lines until further ordered, except that General Birney will make such disposition as he shall think necessary to secure his right flank in the absence of the Sixth Corps.

Lieutenant Colonel F. A. WALKER,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

COLONEL: Colonel Miles thinks the enemy have only a skirmish line in their first line of works on the creek and that they are forming and entrenching a new line of battle some 200 or 300 yards in rear of the creek in the woods. They can be seen digging there and were digging and chopping there during the night. The guns seen yesterday in their gun covers are not visible this morning but are supposed to be in a new position in their new line. I shall try to develop them by an occasional cannon-shot. In front of my skirmish line, on the crest occupied by us in the advance of last night, the enemy are thick (their skirmishers), and vigilant on our front, and their whole skirmish line is active this morning.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

FRANCIS C. BARLOW,

Brigadier-General, Commanding Division.
