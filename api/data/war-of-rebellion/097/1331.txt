HDQRS. ARTILLERY, ARMY OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA, March 21, 1865.

Colonel A. H. COLE,Superintendent of Field Transportation, Richmond, Va.:

COLONEL: Major Mason, of General Fitz Lee's staff, has called to see me in reference to equipping the battalions of two batteries of horse artillery under Major Breathed to serve with General Fitz Lee's division of cavalry, and I have again to request that if you find it consistent with the general service of your department you authorize Major Mason to operate as among your agents in obtaining horses by purchase or impressment in such districts as may be agreed upon between him and yourself. While it is essential not unduly to reduce the working power of the farmers and not harshly to interfere with their rights, it is of the first importance to equip our artillery for an early campaign and especially to have our horse artillery ready for the conflict with the enemy's cavalry, which may be anticipated almost any day.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. N. PENDLETON,

Brigadier-General and Chief of Artillery.
HEADQUARTERS FIRST ARMY CORPS, March 21, 1865.

General R. E. LEE,Commanding:

The only information I have of Echols' brigade is that on the 12th instant it was at Farmville. It has never been under my command.

J. LONGSTREET,

Lieutenant-General.
