LITTLE ROCK, ARK., October 24, 1864.

Brigadier General C. C. ANDREWS,

Devall's Bluff:

There will be a review of the cavalry brigade at Brownsville to-morrow at 12 m. I would like to see you there if you can spare the time. I wish to consult with you in regard to movements. The Ninth Kansas, Fourth Kansas and Third Regulars, or rather detachments from those regiments, had a fight with Logan's cavalry twenty-one miles from here on the Benton road yesterday, and with complete success. They found 27 dead upon the field, captured 17-1 lieutenants. Our loss, 1 killed and 8 wounded.

F. STEELE,

Major-General.

DEVALL'S BLUFF, October 24, 1864-5 p. m.

Major General F. STEELE,

Little Rock:

It will afford me great pleasure to meet you at Brownsville. The whole of Colonel Slack's brigade (from Saint Charles) has arrived; but two boat-loads have not disembarked, having received orders from General Reynolds, as I learn, to that effect.

C. C. ANDREWS,

Brigadier-General.

DEVALL'S BLUFF, October 24, 1864-7 p. m.

Captain C. H. DYER,

Little Rock:

A scout of 100 men, Eleventh Missouri Cavalry, returned yesterday with 200 head of beef-cattle. It went within eight miles of Arkansas Post. Saw no enemy. Captain Wendell, assistant quartermaster, has asked for 300 axes; we need them very much. I wish you would order them sent.

C. C. ANDREWS,

Brigadier-General.
