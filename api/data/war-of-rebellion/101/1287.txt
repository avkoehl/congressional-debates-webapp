The Osage is bank full. They will try to cross at Benefee's Mill or College Ford, near Papinsville, but can only swim their best horses. I think you will find portions on Horse Creek and Cedar Creek who are waiting to cross. These men report to their friends the breaking up of Marmaduke's command and the immediate return of most of the men to Missouri.

JOHN McNEIL,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF SOUTHWEST MISSOURI,Springfield, Mo., March 28, 1865.

Major WICK MORGAN,

Fifteenth Missouri Cavalry, Commanding at Greenfield, Mo.:

The general commanding directs that you send out a scout of twenty-five good men, under a competent officer, into the Horse Creek country. Instruct them to scout that section thoroughly as far as the mouth of Horse Creek. The men will be taken from the garrisons of Greenfield and Melville and will take a sufficient supply of ammunition and rations. You will report the results of the scouts as early as possible.

Very respectfully,

Order the company of the Thirty-ninth Missouri Volunteers to Macon, as you suggested; or if you do not, then order them here. I do not want them in that county any longer.
