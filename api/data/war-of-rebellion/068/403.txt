HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC.

Old Wilderness Tavern, May 5, 1864.

(Received 7.30 a.m.)

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

The enemy have appeared in force on the Orange pike, and are now reported forming line of battle in front of Griffin's division Fifth Corps. I have directed General Warren to attack them at once with his whole force. Until this movement of the enemy is developed, the march of the corps must be suspended. I have, therefore, sent word to Hancock not to advance beyond Todd's Tavern for the present. I think the enemy is trying to delay our movement, and will not give battle, but of this we shall soon see. For the present I will stop here, and have stopped our trains.

GEO. G. MEADE.
HEADQUARTERS ARMIES OF THE UNITED STATES,Germanna Ford, May 5, 1864-8.24 a.m.

General MEADE:

Your note giving movement of enemy and your dispositions received. Burnside's advance is now crossing the river. I will have Ricketts' division relieved and advanced at once, and urge Burnside's crossing. As soon as I can see Burnside I will go forward. If any opportunity presents itself for pitching into a part of Lee's army, do so without giving time for disposition.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
