Mouth of Red River, April 27, 1865. (Received May 1.)

Colonel SPRAGUE,

Commanding, &amp;c., Cairo, Ill.:

Please dispatch the following to Major-General Pope, U. S. Army, commanding, Saint Louis, Mo., and oblige:

The rebel ram Webb, commanded by the infamous Read, of the Tacony infamy, ran by the fleet at the mouth of Red River on the 23rd instant. At New Orleans she passed with the U. S. flag at half-mast. twenty-five miles below New Orleans the U. S. steamer Hollyhock gave her a broadside. She was run ashore by the crew and burned; all escaped but three men. Two hundred and seventeen bales of cotton were destroyed. The Webb left Shreveport on the 17th instant. At that place she took on board 250 cords of pine wood; at Alexandria fifty tons of pine knots. To-day I sent a letter to General Smith by the rebel [commissioner] of exchange.

JOHN T. SPRAGUE,

Lieutenant-Colonel, U. S. Army.

HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF EASTERN ARKANSAS,Helena, Ark., April 27, 1865.

Colonel JOHN LEVERING,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Department of Arkansas:

COLONEL: Last night I received a letter from Major General John Pope, commanding Military division of the Missouri, to report in Saint Louis immediately; also directing me to turn over the command here to next in rank, which I will do to-day and leave for Saint Louis to-night. Affairs in this district are now so regulated that my absence will not be prejudicial to the public service. General Pope desires me to accompany a Congressional committee to the plains and New Mexico. My absence from this command may be but temporary, and will, of course, be decided when I report to General Pope. I have reduced the stores to a proper proportion for the troops on duty, and am, now loading the last boat with quartermaster's stores and grain. In regard to the future government of the district I have no suggestions to make. Colonel Bentzoni, Fifty-sixth U. S. Colored Infantry, will be instructed in all the details of command before I leave.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

A. McD. McCook,

Major-General, Commanding.
