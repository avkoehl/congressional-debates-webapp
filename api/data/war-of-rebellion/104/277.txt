FORT GAINES, April 7, 1865.

General P. J. OSTERHAUS,

Chief of Staff, Military Division of West Mississippi:

Your dispatch concerning ammunition for the mortar-boats just received. All the ammunition that has arrived in this harbor has been sent forward, except some 1,500 13 and 15 inch shells received a couple of days since and consigned to chief ordnance officer at Fort Morgan and unloaded there. These I presume to have been intended for the mortar-boats, although I cannot ascertain. I have ordered them sent forward to Starke's Landing at the earliest moment possible. The last ordnance schooner that arrived here is the Montezuma. She was sent to Starke's Landing on the 5th instant.
