the Twentieth Corps, Rousseau, Geary, Williams (A. S.), and Steinwehr, division commanders.

I have directed Garrard to report to you by letter. I presume he is already to Columbia.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,Nashville, Tenn., April 8, 1864.

General SCHOFIELD, Knoxville:

I have no four regiments subject to assignment at this time, and I know of none to come. Stoneman passed up into Kentucky to-day. He, too, will ask for cavalry, but horses and mounted men are scarce. Do the best you can.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.

LEXINGTON, KY.,

Major-General SCHOFIELD:

The Twelfth Kentucky Volunteers is at Burnside Point. The Forty-fifth Ohio, One hundred and twelfth Illinois, and Sixteenth Kentucky are at Camp Nelson, all with orders to proceed at once to Knoxville. The Eleventh Kentucky Infantry gives me some trouble; it is not as loyal as I wish. I would like for it to be ordered out of the state and some other regiment in the stead. The influence of the First, Eleventh, and Twelfth Kentucky Cavalry is very dangerous in Kentucky at this time. The quiet of the State demands that they be removed as soon as possible.

S. G. BURBRIDGE,

Brigadier-General.

HUNTSVILLE, April 8, 1864.

Major-General SHERMAN:

The following just received from Genera Dodge:

General Clanton is on Flint River. We skirmished with him last night and this morning. Scouts in from all points south. Johnston is evidently getting ready for a move. Morgan left Decatur, Ga., on 27th, and went to Longstreet's army, East Tennessee; said to be going on a big raid. Polk at Demopolis. Mobile and Ohio Railroad finished to Tibbee Creek bridge; say they will finish to Corinth.

Cannot Garrard relieve a portion of Dodge's command from Columbia and Pulaski, and let the troops thus relieved come to the front? General Veatch's command will join Dodge to-day.

JAS. B. MCPHERSON,

Major-General.

NASHVILLE, April 8, 1864.

General MCPHERSON, Huntsville:

Garrard's dismounted cavalry will guard the railroad from Columbia down to Lynnville. I don't understand General Dodge's
