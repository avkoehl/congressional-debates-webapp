MORTON, August 22, 1863.

General BRAGG,

Chattanooga:

On receiving your first dispatch of yesterday I immediately telegraphed to Richmond to inquire if I had authority to help you. Should I receive an affirmative reply, I will send you two divisions for a battle. The field transportation they will require you can furnish, I presume.

J. E. JOHNSTON.

MORTON, August 22, 1863.

General BRAGG,

Chattanooga:

Railroad transportation was ordered as soon as your dispatch was received to-day. It will be ready about 2 o'clock tomorrow, when the movement will commence. Please give orders at Atlanta and West Point.

J. E. JOHNSTON.

DEMOPOLIS, August 22, 1863.

General J. E. JOHNSTON:

The following just received, and is evidently intended for you:

RICHMOND, August 22, 1863.

General HARDEE:

Does your condition enable you to re-enforce Army of Tennessee, and to what extent, and at what time?

JEFFERSON DAVIS.

W. J. HARDEE,

Lieutenant-General.
HEADQUARTERS CAVALRY IN MISSISSIPPI,Canton, August 22, 1863.

Colonel B. S. EWELL,

Assistant Adjutant-General to General Johnston:

COLONEL: I have the honor to call the attention of General Johnston to the large number of dismounted men in Jackson's division of cavalry (about 600), and to request authority either to purchase horses for them or to have them pressed, as at the present high prices it is impossible for the men to provide themselves, particularly the Texans, who are so far from home. The recent raiding parties, as far as I can learn, have retreated to La Grange and Memphis. Those going to Memphis stated that they would return to Vicksburg by water.

I have directed General Jackson to place his cavalry as you indicated to prevent a repetition of the recent raid, and have established couriers connecting Jackson with Logan and Chalmers. I am going to Grenada to visit General Chalmers' command to-day, and it is my intention to strike across the country to Okolona from Grenada.
