THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
December 20,
The feeling that the oivil service of the United
States stands in absolute need of a thorough
reform is every day growing more universal.
I am aware that the problem is extremely diffi-
cult of solution. I certainly do not indulge in
the presumptuous belief that the scheme em-
bodied in this bill is the best that can be devised
or that it contains all that is desirable. There
are many Senators around me who are my
seniors and superiors in age, ability, public
service, and legislative experience. Perhaps
they will suggest valuable improvements, and
no pride of opinion will prevent me from accept-
ing them. Let this plan be commended to their
candid consideration.
I do not know whether a bill like this has in
this Congress any flattering chances of success.
The obstacles which such a reform will have to
encounter and overcome are not unknown to me.
In any event, the friends of this reform are re-
solved to try in good earnest, and we shall ask
in time of the Senate a faip hearing, which I
have no doubt will be granted with the respect
which so important a subject deserves.
I now move that the bill be printed, and re-
ferred to the joint select Committee on Retrench-
ment.
The motion was agreed to.

to provide for taking the ninth census of the

EXECUTIVE SESSION.
Several Senators addressed the Chair.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Chair rec-
ognizes the'Senator lrom Illinois.
Mr. 'J RUMBULL. 1 have sought the floor
for the purpose of moving that the Senate pro- '
ceed to the consideration of executive business. |
, -^r- SUMNER. I was about to move that
tno Senate resume the consideration of the bill i
relating to the telegraphic cables. I think it
will not, create any further debate. !
Mr. 1 I1UMBULL. I think it will. i
Mr. SUMNER. It is very important that
it should be acted on.
Mr. RAMSIii. I hope the Senator from
Massachusetts will allow us to go into execu-
tive session. There is a great deal of business
that has accumulated there that ought to be
disposed of. Perhaps we can come out in an
hour.
Mr. SUMNER. Is the Senator sure of that?
Mr. RAMSEY. I think so.
The VICE PRESIDENT. TheSenatorfrom
Illinois claimed the floor and the Chairawarded
it to him. Does lie yield to the Senator from
Massachusetts ?
Mr. TRUMBULL. 1 made the motion that
we go into executive session. I was willing to
hear a suggestion from the Senator from Mas-
sachusetts
The VI CE PRESIDENT. The Senator with-
draws his motion temporarily to hear a sug-
gestion.
Mr. TRUMBULL. The Senator has made
liis suggestion.
Mr. SUMNER. The simple suggestion I
make is that this bill has been already once
before tho Senate. The Senator from New
York made a suggestion the other day which
he is prepared to embody in an amendment
which I am ready to accept, and I am not
aware that there is a disposition to discuss it.
It is a practical measure which ought to be
acted on before the holidays.
Mr. TRUMBULL. Is there any probability
that it can go through the other House?
Mr. SUMNER. There is.
Mr. TRUMBULL. I think we had better
have an executive session.
Mr. RAMSEY. In executive session we
have business certainly as pressing and import-
ant as that of the Senator from Massachusetts.
Mr. SUMNER. If this bill shall be debated
I will not press it now. The Senator may then
make his motion for an executive session. I
hope the Senator will give mo an opportunity
to have a vote on the bill.
Mr. TRUMBULL. If there is to be no dis-
cussion on it I will withdraw my motion.
Mr. SUMNER. Very well.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator
from Massachusetts moves to proceed to the
consideration of Senate bill No. 115, in regard
to telegraph cables. Is that the bill?
Mr. SUMNER. It is.
The VICE PRESIDENT. That motion is
before the Senate.
Mr. CONKLING. I am quite in sympathy
with the bill which the Senator from Massachu-
setts proposes to take up. Do not let us, how-
ever, go into the consideration of it without an
understanding that we shall consider it deliber-
ately and make it right. I do not suppose it
will lead to much discussion, but there are some
suggestions to ho made about it, so that it will
not pass without consideration as it is now. I
think with the Senator it is an important bill
and ought to be considered, but I do not think
we had better take it up at this time with the
idea that it is to be passed in a moment.
Mr. SUMNER. 1 have already stated that
the Senator from New York has a proposition
which he has submitted to me to which I find
no objection.
Mr. CONKLING. That will dispose of one
feature of the bill. There is another feature,
however, upon which there will be some dis-
cussion, no doubt.
Mr. TRUMBULL. That being so, I renew
the motion that the Senate proceed to the con-
sideration of executive business.
_ The motion was agreed to; and after some
time spent in the consideration of executive
business the doors were reopened.
cuban affairs.
The VICE PRESIDENT laid before the
