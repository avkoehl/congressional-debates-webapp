list of the post offices in the United Slates, which was read, and
ordered to a second reading.
On motion of Mr BCRRIEN, the President pro Urn waa
empowered to fill the vacancy m the Judiciary Committee, oc-
casioned by the resignation of Mr Frsntiss, of Vermont.
Mr MERRICK, from the Commmee oa the Post Office and
Post Roads, moved that that committee be discharged from r! e
further consideration of the resolution instructing that commit
tee toinquire into the exped ency oí íixle nnifying Kmkle and
Carothers,the amountof certain drafts diawn m their favoE, and
which the deputy postmaster on whoai they were diawn faned

On motion of Mr KING, the question of discharging the
committee waa postponed
THE LOAN BILL
The bill to extend the time for the ioan of the txíra session
to twenty years, to authorize an additional loan of five millions
of dollars, and to provide for paying interest on the Treasury
notes, which was ordered to be engrossed on yesterday, came
up on its third reading
Mr CLAYTON remarked that some of his friends on that
side (the Whig side] had made a request of him to move a re-
consideration of the vote ordcung the bill to be engaged ior a
third reading, with a view to have the vote itnking out the 3d
section of the bilí ateo reconsidered He did this at the in
stance and request of his fuends, for whose opinions he had
gieatregard f hey feel that the vote on striding out the thud
¡section was not a fair expression of the opinion of the Pénate,
several of those who were opposed to stukmg that section out,
being absent His opinion had not changed as to the impro
prieüyíof that section, and it wag his determination to give his
vote as he had done on yesterday Those who were opposed to
striking out thatsection say it was not a fair expres&ion of the
opinion of the henate, and it waa no' his wish to deprive any
absentee of an opportunity to record his vote He moved to re-
consider the vote on ordering the bill to be engrossed
Mr KING had no objection to give the Senator from Pela
ware an opportunity to get rid of this odium occasioned by Ins
association with tho&e who had voted to strike out
the thud section, but he woudonly say, whether the senator
had changed his views of not—whether he was in favor of re
instating that section or not, the inevitable result of his mo
tion, if successful, would be to restore the third section, to
which he waa so much oppose1, and which bis judernent so
much condemned The Senator's motion would be virtually a
vote to restore the third section, for, if the motion is made, the
section will be restored The object in striking out chat section
was to protect the national Treasury, and to pievent those
bonds from being ísoued as a circulating medium, and if the
Senator from Delaware, and the paity t > which he belonged,
are not willing that the country should be made to uspeet
them of being willing to do indirectly what they date not do di
rectly, they wilt vote against the motion to reconsider Mr K
believed the principle m this section was a departure fi )rn all
past modesof negotiators loan-, it was novel in i's character su=;
picious m its appearance, and will be extiemely oannxiuus if
adopted He hoped the Senatoi wí¡  not piepaied to make ihe
motion, when he saw its effect would be to íestore this danger
ous section, to wh'ch he was opposed He hoped the mo.ion
would not pievail
Mr CLA.YT.ON reiterated his reasons for miking the motion
to reconsider Hisopmons, however, were hs own, and he
intended to adhere to them, and did not feel himself bound to
arcountto any one for them He did not wish, that the ad->ge
■nosciter a soens should be applied to him Though his opi
nions had not changed, yet he was willing to afford to those who
were absent an oppoitunny tr voteon theq íestion
The question was taken, on the motion to íeconsider the
vote on ordering the bill to be engrossed, and it was agreed to—
ayes 20, noes 18
Mr CLAY TON then moved to reconsidei the vote, by which
the third section of the biil was stricken out, which was nine
following words
Sec 3 And be it fuither enacted, That the certificates
hereafter to be issued forsaidloan may when required, hem
such form as shall be prest ribed by the Secretary oí the Trea
sury,so that the stock maybe tiansferable by deliveiy of ihe
certificate, instead of being assignable on the books of the
Treasury „
Mi EVANS demanded the yeas and nays, which weieor-
dered.
Mr E said he had taken some pam<?to irqmrethe provable
effect of this amendment since it passed yesteiday and learned
froui theSecieiary of the Tieasvny, that it wasa matte t of very
great importance He con¡s Jers it of the utmost consequence,
to facilitate the obtaining of ti e loan, that the thud ¡section
should be restored Ihis was the form m which their Ost mo
dern loans m Europe weie obtained I lie absence of thiss^c
tion was made an objection by those who weie desirous to take
a part of the late Joan They would not take it because it was
not m this form
Reconsidered the section as a matter of extreme importance
to the bill—that it would make a diflaencein the facility ofob
taming the loan, and would materially aPect heiate of inte
rest He hoped the section would be reinstated, and thus the
bill be made to confoim to the wishes of those who were de
sirous to take the other loan.
The question was then aken on the motion to leconMder the
vote stnkir g out the third section, and it was cai ried, by—yeas

The question lecuning on the motion to strikeout the third
section—
Mr SEVIER deemandulthc yeas and nays, which were or

Mr WRIGHT said if the chairman of the Tmance Commit

also find that u wat> the ¡>pecuíatoi m public stocks who desntd

sults would be more fearful, more alarum gto the mstitutions
of ihiscountry, than any man could comprehend He com 
pared the Government to a family with an income inadequate
to us expenditures, which, instead of giving up us luxu-
rious ^pursmt*, not only continued ífó extravagance, but wert

away a part of its estate
The gentlemen were enti]ed to credit for consistency in per-
tinaciously adhering to their system with a tenacity woi hy of a
bet'er cause So tenaciously are thev bent on adhering to their
system, that when the time comes for fulfilling the clause m
their land bill to res ore the land fuid, they will revoke that
clause, and rtpuuiate the very condi'ion, but for which they
ne\er could have carried the measure This is necessary to
bung pbowt the giand schemes of the whole system—Bank and
tariff When that ai n is attained, there will he no reductions:
retrenchment will never be heard of, then tht¡=y6iem will stand
on its own oper itioi b, without popular appeals
HeieMr C pointed out the d ííerentdepartmen'sm whicK
retrenchments might be effected to get ud of the difficulties of
the Government, and asked would this be done? JSo because
that would be wholly subversive of the system of measures on
which the gentlemen depended foi their political existence
He alluded to the declaration of the chairman of the Finance
Commit*ee, that the debt would piobaoly leath thirty mil
lions
Mr EVANS explained thiUViat he had said was, thatjf tha
laws remained as they aie, (hedeht might be thirty millions
Mi CALHOUN continued He was afraid the laws v/o«Id
not be mi roved He had in his desk a biil prepared m tha
other Hot sc—but it would not be in order to mention the name of
the gentleman who framed it—it was enough to say he was one
pledged to the gentlemen's system It showed the soit ofim-
provtmenis contempt i cd Here Mr C ieviewed m detail the
effirts of the sy&iem which he veiily believed would be pur-
sued—that of holding the land fund, mcreabing the tariff, and
com nuins, if not inctasm^, expenditures, and felt assured
the geitlemen would rome before Congress nextyear in still
moreembauassed circumscmus than at present, even fhough
this loan bil shou 1 now be passed lie could not sanction
auch a condition of things The proper cuipíc to be pursued
wis asstiaiiht as the road fiom this to the Presiden's House,

credu of thia Go%ernmentaoioa to the Euiopean market he had
not the heart to do it He valuded American cie 'it and honor too
highly to do so He believed there was money enough in this
