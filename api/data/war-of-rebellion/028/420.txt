WASHINGTON, October 13, 1862.

Captain J. D. KURTZ,

In Charge of Engineer Bureau:

CAPTAIN: By order, already known to the Engineer Department, I was relieved from duty with the Army of the Potomac, and placed in command of fortifications of Washington and troops assigned to their defense. When the different armies fell back upon Washington, and general command of troops and defenses was given to General McClellan, I relinquished all command (September 3), and by Special Orders, Numbers 4, Headquarters Defense of Washington, September 13, 1862, I was assigned to duty as chief engineer. As such, I have been engaged in completing the system of defensive works around Washington.

The inclosed extract of a letter to Colonel J. C. Kelton, assistant adjutant-general, will inform the department as to the condition of the works.*

Captain B. S. Alexander (lieutenant-colonel and aide-de-camp) has been, and is, assisting me-the only officer of the corps on duty with me.

Captain H. L. Abbot, Topographical Engineers, returned from sick leave and reported for duty to me on the 25th of September, and remains on duty with me, superintending the erection of exterior works about Fort Lyon.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. G. BARNARD,

Brigadier-General, Chief Engineer Defenses of Washington.
