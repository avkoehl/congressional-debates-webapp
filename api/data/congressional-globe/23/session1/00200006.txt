6                                      THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.                               Dec. 3,
debt of the United States, funded and unfunded, to
the sum of $4,760,082 08 And as provision has
already been made for the four and a-half per cent
above mentioned, and charged in the expenses of
the present year, the sum last stated is all that now
remains of the national debt, and the revenue of
the coming year, together with the balance now in
the Treasury, will be sufficient to discharge it,
after meeting the current expenses of the Gov-
ernment. Under the power given to the com-
missioners of the sinking fund, it will, I haveTio
doubt, be purchased on favorable terms within the
year
From this view of the state of the finances, and
the public engagements yet to be fulfilled, you will
perceive that, if Providence permits me to meet
you at another session, I shall have the high grati-
fication of announcing to you that the national debt
is extinguished. I cannot refrain from expressing
the pleasure I feel at the near approach of that
desirable event. The short penod of time within
which the public debt will have been discharged,
is strong evidence of the abundant íesourcesof the
country, and of the piudence and economy with
■which the Government has heretofore been admin-
istered We have waged two wars since we be-
came a nation with one of the most powerful
kingdoms in the world—both of them undertaken
in defence of our dearest rights, both successfully
prosecuted and honorably terminated, and many
of those who partook in the first struggle, as well
as the second, will have lived to see the last item
of the debt incurred in these necessary, but expen-
sive conflicts, faithfully and honestly discharged,
and we shall have the proud satisfaction of be-
queathing to the public servants who follow us in
the administration of the Government the rare
blessing of a revenue sufficiently abundant—raised
without injustice or oppression to our citizens, and
unencumbered with any burdens but what they
themselves shall think proper to impose upon it
The flourishing state of the finances ought not,
however, to encourage us to indulge in a lavish
expenditure of the public treasure. The receipts
of the present year do not furnish the test by which
we are to estimate the income of the next. The
changes made in our revenue system by the acts
of Congress of 1832 and 1833, and more especially
by the former, have swelled the receipts of the
present year far beyond the amount to be expected
in future years upon the reduced tariff of duties.
The shortened credits on revenue bonds, and the
cash duties on woolens, which were introduced
by the act of 1832, and took effect on the 4th of
March last, have bi ought large sumsintotheTreas-
ury in 1833, which, according to the credits for-
merly given, would not have been payable until
1834, and would have formed a part of the income
of that year These causes would of themselves
produce a great diminution of the receipts in the
year 1834, as compared with the present one, and
they will be still more diminished by the reduced
rates of duties, which take place on the first of Jan-
uary next, on some of the most important and pro-
ductive articles. Upon the best estimates that<can
be made, the receipts of the next year, with the
aid oftheunappropnated amountnow in theTreas-
ury, will not be much more than sufficient to meet
the expenses of the year, and pay the small rem-
nant of the national debt which yet remains unsat-
isfied 1 cannot, therefore, recommend to you any
alteration in the present tariff of duties The rate,
as now taxed by law on the various articles, was
adopted at the last session of Congress, as a matter
of compromise, with unusual unanimity, and un-
less it is found to produce more than the necessi-
ties of the Government call for, there would seem
to be no reason at this time to justify a change
But while I forbear to recommend any furttrer
reduction of the duties beyond that already pro
vided for by the exist.ng laws, 1 must earnestly
and respectfully press upon Congress the import-
ance of abstaining from all appropriations which
are notabsolutely required for the public interests,
and authorized by the powers clearly delegated to
the United States We aie beginning a new era
in our Government The national debt, which
has so long been a burden on the Treasury, will
be finally discharged m the course of the ensuing
year Ño more money will afterwards be needed
than what may be necessary to meet the ordinary
expenses of tne Government.   Now, then, is the
proper moment to fix our system of expenditure
on firm and durable principles, and 1 cannot too
strongly urge the necessity of a rigid economy,
and an inflexible determination not to enlarge the
income beyond the real necessities of the Govern-
ment, and not to increase the wants of the Gov-
ernment by unnecessary and profuse expenditures
If a contrary course should he pursued, it may
happen that the revenue of 1834 will fall short of
the demands upon if and after reducing the tariff
in order to lighten the burdens of the people, and
providing for a stiilfuuher reduction to take effect
hereafter, it would be much to be deplored if, at
the end of another year, we should find ourselves
obliged to retrace our steps and impose additional
taxes to meet unnecessary expenditures
It is my duty, on this occasion, to call your
attention to the destruction of the public building
occupied by the Treasury Department, which hap-
pened since the last adjournment of Congress A
thoiough inquiry into the causes of this loss was
directed and made at the time, the result of which
will be duly communicated to you I take pleas-
| ure, however, in stating here, that by the laudable
exertions of the officers of the Department, and
many of the c.tizens of the District, but few papers
were lost, and none that will materially affect the
public interest.
The public convenience requires that anothei
building should be erected as soon as practicable,
and in providing for it, it will be advisable to en
large, in some manner, the accommodations for
the public officers of the several depaitments, and
to authorize the erection of suitable depositories
for the safe-keeping of the public documents and
records
Since the last adjournment of Congress the
Secretary of the Tieasury has directed the money
of the United States to be deposited in certain State
banks designated by him, and he will immediately
lay before you his reasons for this direction I
concur with him entirely in the view he has taken
of the subject, and some months before the re
moval, I urged upon the Department the propriety
of taking that step The near approach of the day
on which the charter will expire, as well as the
conduct of the bank, appeared to me to call for
this measure, upon the high considerations of
public interest and public duty. The extent of its
misconduct, however, although known to be great,
was not at that time fully developed by proof. It
was not until late m the month of August that I
received ftom the Government directors an official
report, establishing beyond question, that this
great and powerful institution had been actively
engaged in attempting to influence the elections of
the public officers by means of its money, and
that, in violation of the express provisions of its
charter, it had, by a formal resolution, placed its
funds at the disposition of its President, to be em-
ployed m sustaining the political power of the
bank. A copy of this resolution is contained in
the report of the Government directors before
referred to, and however the object may be dis-
guised by cautious language, no one can doubt
that this money was in truth intended for election-
eering purposes, and the particular uses to which
it was proved to have been applied abundantly
show that it was so understood. Not only was
the evidence complete as to the past application of
the money and the power of the bank to election-
eering purposes, but that the resolution of the
Board of Directors authorized the same course to
be pursued in future.
It being thus established by unquestionable
proof that the Bank of the United States was con-
verted into a permanent electioneering engine, it
appeared to me that the path of duty which the
Executive Department of the Government ought
to pursue was not doubtful As by the terms of
the bank charter, no officer but the Secretary of
the Treasury could remove the deposits, it seemed
to me that this authority ought to be at once
exerted to deprive that great corporation of the
support and countenance of the Government m
such an use of its funds and such an exertion of
its power In this point of the case, the question
is distinctly presented, whether the people of the
United States are to govern through representatives
chosen by their unbiassed suffrages, or whether
the power and money of a great corporation are to
be secretly exerted to influence their judgment and
¡ control their decisions. It must now be determined
i whether the bank is to have its candidates for all
I offices in the country, from the highest to the low-
est, or whether candidates on both sides of politi-
cal questions shall be brought forward as hereto-
fore, and supported by the usual means.
At this time, the efforts of the bank to control
public opinion through the distresses of some and
the feais of others, are equally apparent, and, if
possible, more objectionable     By a curtailment of
its accommodations, more rapid than any emei-
j gency requires, and even while it retains specie to
an almost unprecedented amount in its vaults, it is
i attempting to produce great embarrassment in one
| portion of the community, while, through presses
I known to have been sustained by its money, it
attempts, by unfounded alarms, to create a panic
in all
These are the means by which it seems to ex-
pect that it can force a restoration of the deposites,
and,as anecessary consequence, extort from Con-
gress a renewal of its charter.    I am happy to
j know that, through the good sense of our people,
the effort to get up a panic has hitherto failed, and
that, through the increased accommodations which
I the State banks have been enabled to afford, no
, public distress has followed the exeitions of the
bank, and it cannot be doubted that the exercise
I of its power and the expenditure of its money, as
well as its efforts to spread groundless alarm, will
j be met and íebuked as they deserve.   In my own
í  spheie of duty I should feel myself called on by
the facts disclosed, to order a scire faaas against
the bank, with a view to put an end to the char-
1 teied rights it has so palpably violated, were it not
| that the charter itself will expire as soon as a de-
cision would probably be obtained from the court
of last resort.
I called the attention of Congress to this subiect
in my last annual message, and informed them that
such measures as were within the reach of the
Secretary of the Treasury had been taken to en-
able him to judge whether the public deposites in
the Bank of the United States were entirely safe;
but that as his single powers might be inadequate
to the object, 1 recommended the subject to Con-
gress as worthy of their serious investigation,
declaring it as my opinion that an inquiry into the
transactions of that institution, embracing the
i branches as well as the principal bank, was called
I for by the credit which was given throughout the
I country to many serious charges impeaching their
1 character, and wh ch, if true, might justly excite
the apprehension that they were no longer a safe
depository for the public money The extent to
which the examination thus recommended was
gone into, is spread upon your Journals, and is too
well known to require to be stated. Such as was
made, resulted in a report from a majority of the
Committee of Ways and Means touching certain
specified points only, concluding with a resolution
that the Government deposites might safely be
continued in the Bank of theUnned States. This
resolution was adopted at the dose of the session,
by the vote of a majority of the House of Repre-
sentatives
Although I may not always be able to concur in
the views of the public interest, or the duties of its
agents, which may be taken by the other depart-
ments of the Government, or either of its branches,
I am, notwithstanding, wholly incapable of receiv-
ing, otherwise than with the most sincere respect,
all opinions or suggestions proceeding from such a
source, and in respect to none am 1 more inclined
I to do so than the House of Representatives    But
i it will be seen from the brief views at this time
| taken of the subject by myself, as well as the more
( ampleones presented by the Secretory of theTreas-
ury, that the change m the deposites which has
i been ordered has been deemed to be called for by
j considerations which are not affected by the pro-
| ceedmgs referred to, and which, if correctly viewed
by that department, rendered its act a matter of
imperious duty
Coming as you do, for the most part, lmmediate-
I ly from the people and the States, by election, and
¡ possessing the fullest opportunity to know their
sentiments, the present Congress will be sincerely
I solicitous to cairy into full and fair effect the will
, of their constituents in regard to this institution.
It will be for those in whose behalf we all act to
I decide whether the Executive Depaitment of the
