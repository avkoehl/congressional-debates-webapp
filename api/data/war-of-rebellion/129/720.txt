[Sixth indorsement.]

Respectfully returned to the Honorable Secretary of War.

Money has been sent Major Allen, commissary of subsistence, Columbus, Ga., which would have arrived in time to meet Doctor Terry's requisition but for the fact that no warrants were issued from the Treasury from September 7 to October 7.

As long as this Bureau has, as has been the case for several months, upward of $30,000,000 of unhonored requisitions there must be a delay of at least two months in supplying furnds. The Honorable Secretary of war is urgently requested to remedy this evil if possible by enabling this Bureau to obtain more currency from the Treasury, the amount of non-taxable bonds and certificates of indebtendness issued to the Subsistence Bureau being [more] than that for all other bureaus of the Department combined. I had not been previously infomred of the improved condition of the Treasury intimated by the indorsement of the Honorable Secretary of War.

L. B. NORTHROP,

Commissary-General of Subsistence.

GENERAL ORDERS,
 ADJT. AND INSP. GENERAL'S OFFICE,

No. 78.
 Richmond, October 11, 1864.

I. The attention of officers and soldiers is specially directed to the thirty-fourth article of Army Regulations, and General Orders, No. 3, 1863. The rapidly increasing correspondence of the War Department demands that their rquirements shall hereafter be strictly observed. A violation of them will subject the offender to prompt trial by court-martial. The regulations respecting military correspondence were made after long experience, and are indpsensable to an intelligent and efficient discharge of business.

The remarks and opinions of intermediate commanders upon the subject-mater of each communication are important to the Department, and in all cases required. Opportunity must, therefore, be afforded for their expression; and all communications which are not forwarded through the prescribed channel will be invariably returned without other action than instructions to bring the party to trial for violation of orders.

Letter paper will be forlded in three, and foolsca in four equal folds, parallel with the writting and indorsed on the fold corresponding with the top of the sheet, thus:
