OFFICE ACTG. ASST. PROVOST-MARSHAL-GENERAL,

STATE OF NEW HAMPSHIRE,

Concord, October 23, 1863.

Colonel J. B. FRY,

Provost-Marshal-General, Washington, D. C.:

COLONEL: I have the honor to transmit herewith copies of the reports of Captain Godfrey, provost-marshal First District, and John Legro, deputy provost-marshal, relative to the expedition sent to the town of Jackson, by my orders, to arrest the parties concerned in the late riotous proceedings in said town.

It appears no arrests were made, the active parties in the resistance offered to the draft having fled. The remaining notices were served on the drafted men.

I confess I am disappointed in the results of this expedition. I shall, however, endeavor to secure the arrest of the ringleaders.

The evidence will be placed in the hands of the U. S. district attorney and all proper steps taken to bring the offenders to justice.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

O. A. MACK,

Major and Aide-de-Camp and Actg. Asst. Prov. March General
