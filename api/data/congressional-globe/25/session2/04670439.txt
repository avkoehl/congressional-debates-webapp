war, indiscriminately levelled agamst every age
and sex. Sir, if I fail to express my sympathy m
strains of equal eloquence with the Senator from
South Carolina for the sufferings of the deserving
portion of the native race, I will nut yield to the
gentleman my claims to feelings as refined, en-
larged, and sympathetic for suffering humanity,
even when a savage is the victim I avow my-
self the friend and defender of the just rights and
true interest of the native race. But I am far, very
far, from being the eulogist, or apologist of Oseóla.
I can but think of his name with horror and dis-
gust.
But, sir, my anxiety for the speedy passage of
this bill would have induced me to vote in silence,
after all the the remarks of the gentleman upon
the Florida part of the subject, if the gentleman
had stopped there JBut, sir, he has come nearer
home to me, and I feel bound to defend my own
premises The gentleman has given us a history
of hissupport and defence of the Chf íokee treaty of
1835, and has manifested marked zeal in the de-
fence of my Slate, and a portion of Us public func-
tionaries I thank him kindly tor all this volun-
tary service It is a tree will offering, which I
feel assured vvdl bedulv appreciated by the friends
of the treaty and of the State.
But, sir, wc find mingled with all this support of
. the treaty, and zeal to have it faithfully and speedi-
ly executed, a spirit and bearing m the remarks
of the gentleman, which, to m> mind, is calculated
to do great injustice to the Administration which
made and has sustained this tieaty, as well as the
friends of the Administration, who have born- the
heat and burdtn of the day, m bringing oui Indian
relations to their piesent attitude
The gentlemen reminds me of whit I hive oftm
seen in the course of a life not now a verv short
one, that is persons vociferous in a'cause after the
victory was achieved, and persons, too, who stood
aloof while the battle raged.
Sir, I will never permit the Senator from South
Carolina, uncontested, to sup in at this late day,
and carry off whatever meed of praise may be due
to those who have struggled so long to relieve my
beloved Stile from an Indian population 1 truly
thank him for all his kind feelings and services to
my State, and her citizi-ns, whether private 01 pub-
lic men But all this kindness and zeal for my
State and her distinguished citizens, shall not in-
duce me silently to asquiesce in direct or indued
censure, when improperly cast upon me, or the Ad-
ministration of the Federal Government which 1
support. My position in relation to this mattei shall
not be misunderstood or imsiepresented without
the proper correction I am fully appn/td of the
fact, that the late communication of the President
of the Unued States to Congress, embracing the let-
ter of the Secretary oí War to John Ross, is at
this time a most fruitful subject for excitement and
misrepresentation. I, theretoie, deem it my duty
to go into a history oí this transaction, sustained by
such facts as cannot be controverted, and as will
do justice to myself, and the Executive Govern-
ment.
The Cherokee treaty of 1835, after all that has
been said to disparage the Government and the
Indians who formed it, I repeat, as I have often
done before, it is a monument of the magnanimity
of the Government on one side, anda standing
recoid of the honesty an I pure patriotism of the
Cherokees who negotiated it, on the other side
I was invited, at an early day, to aid as a com-
missioner in the execution of this treaty, and have
been familiar with every important transaction
since, up to the present day. The Executive Go-
vernment has uniformly, and at all times, expressed
an unwavering determination to carry out and
execute the treaty, without infringement er change
of its provisions It has as uniformly, constantly,
and sincerely expressed a desire to discharge this
duty m a spirit of the utmost kindness and libeiahty
towards the Cherokee people. In all this I have
concurred and co opetated with the Government
But it is nevertheless true, that from the time I
entered upon the duties oí the appointment of com-
missioner until I took my seat m this Senate, yes,
sir, and up to the present day, some difference of
opinion between the Executive Government and
myself has existed, on some points touching the
best mod  of accomplishing the object which we
all had m view. I united m the views of the Go-
vernment, in using every effort within my official
range to reconcile the opposing part of the Chero-
kees to this treaty; and have, to a considerable ex-
tent, succeeded.
But I have uniformly dissented, as all my official
letters will show while acting as commissioner, to
that part of the policy of the Government which has
permitted John Ross and his followers, while con-
stantly protesting against the validity of the treaty,
receiving the countenance and courtesy which they
have done from the Government. I have uni-
formly believed, and still believe, that the best and
safest way te have executed this treaty would have
been, from the first, kindly, but firmly, to have
used the imperative language to Ross and his fol-
lowers—to have said the argument is exhausted in
regard to the treaty—It must be executed I believe
that no propositions from Ross should ever have
been entertained, without being accompanied by a
pledge to cease from all opposition to the removal
ot the Cherokees. But 1 believe this difference
of opinion originated fiom n® difference in object
It was the desire of all to execute the treaty in
that manner which might be best for all the parties
m interest. Piom my knowledge of the chaiacter
of Ross, I had no confidence that he csuld be con-
ciliated by concessions. Grant one demand, and
anoiher would immediately be made. The strong
desire of ihe Government to conciliate Ross and
his party has been constantly stiengthened by the
opinions of many of the officers and agents of the
Government, as well as by the opinions of highly
respectable citizens of various States, communi-
cated lo the Executive Government—that the trea'v
could never be executed peaceably, without the as-
sent and aid of the opposing party ol the Cheio-
kees, therefore, to a> oid the evils of an Indian
war, which must terminate in the destruction of the
Cherokees, as well as some loss of w hite inhabi-
tants The Government has, with a patience and
forbearance unparalleled, kept an open ear to the
untiring perseverance of Ross.
On lakmg my seat in the Senate, I found Ross
and his delegation still heie, memorializing Con-
gress, and making propositions to the Executive
Government, my mode and manner of meeting
which is. known to the Senate and to the country
In the month ol March, I found, from informa-
tion derived Irom different sources, tint the Execu-
tive Government here was still urged by gentle-
men m high official stations, to the policy oí con-
ciliating Ross by increased libeiahty in money.
Amongst others, I will read an extract from a
letter of Governor Gilmer of Georgia, to the Se-
cretary of War, dated March 5, 183S The
Govornor «ays "The best informed peisons re-
siding among the Cherokes expiess the opinion
that Ros-, can, if he will, temove his peo-
ple at once To avoid the great expense to the Go-
vernment, and to preset ve the lives and property
of oui citi/ens, and the Indians which may
be saci diced it the tieaty is executed by
force, the Government can well afford to
pay a very liberal price for the voluntary
and immediate ie noval ot the Indians. To enable
Ross and the chiefs to effect this object, T believe it
to be necessary for them first to return home see
their people, and let them be satisfied that meir
efforts to change the treaty have been honest though
unavailing. The Cheiok-et aie so suspicious ot
their chief's, that even Ross, as entirely as he has
their confidence, might lose all power to sf rve them
if he attempted to .make a eoutiact with the Go-
vernment, fo- their emigration, bef ire thfy were
consulted, and their approval of the measure ob-
tained If the Government should asceitam upon
Ross's return home, that he had the power, and was
willing to undeitake the removal of his people, the
terms ot contract could be agreed upon without
difficulty er delay " "If the pertinacity of Ross
should create any difficulty, it might be obviated in
making no íeference m his contract to the treaty."
Very many letters from other persons of high
respectability and official standing, to the same
purport of Governor Gilmei's, may be found on the
files of the War Department     Indeed I have al-
ways myself anticipated mischief growing out of
the execution of this treaty, unless the influence of
Ross was neutralized by force or purchase. Un-
der this aspect of the subject, and after both
branches of Congress had given sufficient evidence
of a determination to execute the treaty, regardless
of the remonstrances of Ross, and the silly peti-
tions of persons wholly ignorant of the subject up-
on which they were petitioning, I came to the con-
clusion, that Ross might possibly be m a situation
to yield to the true interest of his people, and let
them emigrate to the West in peace
And hence my assent was given to the views sug-
gested in the extract of Gov Gnmer's letter, which
I have read. And while I have uniformly pro-
tested against any movement which might in the
slightest degree retard the removal ot the Cherokees,
I have, nevertheless, uniformly and freely ex-
pressed the opinion, that the moment when all
opposition to the treaty by Ross and his party
should be yielded up, and a disposition manifested
to emigrate wi'h reasonable despatch, from that
moment the Indians would be secured from any
unreasonable pressure on the part of the people of
Georgia I repudiate the idea that my ci nslitu-
ents would, uadcr ^uch cucum^tanoes, act \uth
inhumanity towards the suffering Indians, or -e-
fuse to grant every indulgence wh ci in true i te-
rest of tne Indians and tumamty ma) íequire
No Senator on this floor is be'ter acquainted \uth
his consti'ucnls than 1 am with mine. 1 ney aie
generous, just, and liberal. Their magnanimity
cannot be appealed to m vain. But, sir, they never
can be foiced into slavish submission, or withdraw
from a pending controversy.
But, Mr President, I now come to the important
object which I had in view, in addressing the Se-
nate 1 am fully apprised of the great excitement
which has been produced in my own Stale, and
elsewhere, ansmg out of the propositions of the
Sxretary of War to John Ross, lately submitted to
Congress 1 am not only apprised ol the excitement,
but of the misapprehension which seems to exist on
this subject. I perceive from the newspapers of Geor-
gia and other States, as well as from the letters
which I receive from my constituents, that an im-
pression has been made upon the pablic mmd that
the Government was desirous, and had pioposed,
unnecessarily, to delay the emigration oi the Cheio-
kees for two years This I know to be an entire
misapprehension. The extension proposed to the
States by the Government, and that in the most de-
licate and respectful manner, was never intended
to embrace a longer period than that which might
bp required by a due regard to the common dictates
of humanity, it being expressly stated that the Che-
rokees «ere to be removed as speedily as was con
sistent with health and comfort General Scott is,
moreover, instructed to continue the prosecution of
the measures he has adopted to remove the Indians,
and whether their re noval is to be effected by com-
pulsion, or voluntary em gration under their own
agents, so to conduct his operations as to place the
piopnetors of the lands there m possession of then
property with as little delay as possible. These in-
structions certainly do not warrant the supposition
that the Government consents that Rosa and his
friends shall remain two years longer.
On the contrary, the orders of the Government
are most positive, that the Indians aie to be re-
moved fiom Georgia first, and from the other States
as speedily as practicable This is the plain mean-
ing of the letter of the Secretary of War to John
Ross, as intended, understood, and ínterpre'ed by
the author himself. I admit that the propositioi s
made to John Ross, by the Secretaiy of War, might
have been put in a form less liable to misappre-
hension But I am utterly at a loss to account for
the wide-spread misapprehension upon this subject,
except it be from the fact that it took its rise in
both houses of Congress, and thus rapidly spread
to the four quarters of the Union I know posi-
tively that tne exposition given by the Secretary of
War,  f his letter to Ross, is perfectly consistent
with the views which he expressed te me before
making his propositions to Ross. The Secretary
had ample grounds to believe that Congress enter-
tained the most liberal feelings towards the Chero-
kees, and would willingly soothe them, as far as
