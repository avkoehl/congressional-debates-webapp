Major General A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff, army of the Potomac:

GENERAL: I would like to have an engineer officer to direct the construction of a line of works in front of the enemy's old line, cutting off the Salient which we took, so that there can be no dispute about them again. An intelligent engineer officer, who could take proper advantage of the accidents of the ground and work in reference to the enemy's present line, would be very valuable.

Your obedient servant,
