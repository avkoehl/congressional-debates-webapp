HDQRS. FIRST DIVISION, FIFTEENTH ARMY CORPS,Antioch Church, N. C., March 10, 1865.

Major MAX. WOODHULL,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Fifteenth Army Corps:

MAJOR: I respectfully report that I began pulling out of my camp on Shoe Heel Creek at 5 o'clock this morning; the roads, however, wee such as to reuqire almost continuous corduroying, and my advance was consequently very slow. Reaching the old Stage road I found the Fourth Division passing. I here built a substantial bridge over the stream that crossed the road at this point, so as to expedite my crossing. Following on in the rear of General John E. Smith, I moved over Lumber River (which occupied two hours), going into camp on Raft Swamp, some two miles beyond Randalsville at 8 p. m., having mrched twelve miles, facing my troops south and southwest, covering the road on which I came in. My headquarters are at Antioch Church.

I am, major, very respectfully,

C. R. WOODS,

Brevet Major-General.
