THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
March 20,
children, who may be emigrating- to California or
Oregon, or with the arrow to pierce you, or in
stealth to creep upon and plunder you. War,
war, exists with the savage on every side. There
were in Florida, during the Florida war, it is be-
lieved, not over 1,100 Indians, with afew negroes.
'J'he appropriations for the army and for the
suppression of Indian hostilities, &c., including
all military operations, were:
fn 1836 $8,111,950
In 1837  9,308,521
In 1838 10,007,546
only $2,000,000; cut down largely by Mr. Polk
Total   $27,428,017
Besides these, there were subsequent appropria-
tions for arrears, and for paying the claims of
States for services of militia, &,e.
The regular force in service in the United States
during that period, averaged 7,500; the total mil-
itia force was about 36,000, averaging three months
service—that is, equal to 9,000 men for the year,
or 3,000 for three years; (hat force added to the
qrmy would give about 10,500 men, at an average
expense of §9,100,000, or £860 per man. The least
possible estimates that can be made of the cost of
the Florida war, was $11,000,000 or $13,000,000.
The average force of the army for the three years
succeeding the war with Mexico has been ten
thousand five hundred, with a few hundred volun-
teers. The estimates have been under £7,000,000
per annum, and the appropriation still less. The
actual expenses probably have not exceeded
$8,500,000 per annum, or not $800 per man. Now,
f know there was extravagance in the Florida war.
I know volunteers were called oat when they were
not needed. I know lire-wood was brought from
the levee of New Orleans to Florida, where fire-
wood abounded. I challenge no comparison with
such expenditures, justified even by a Democratic
Administration and a Democratic Congress; but
what 1 do challenge is a comparison of thegeogi aph-
ical position of Florida, in the heart of our settled
country almost, accessible by sea and by steam,
with comparatively little or no land transportation
within the reach of the great markets of New Or-
leans, and the northern cities—with the geograph-
ical position of New Mexico, of Utah, of Texas,
the Upper Rio Grande, and on her northern
boundary—with the costly, golden prices of Ore-
gon and California, remote fiom cities and abound-
ing in immigrating colonists, enhancing by their
numbers the value of everything enormously.
The naval expenses of the Florida war, the cost
of revenue cutters in service there—all such
charges I throw out of account—for the challenged
point of comparison is accessibility by water and
steam, and the-expenses of land transportation.
Now, we have over-land wagon routes across a
whole continent, from Fort Leavenworth, in Mis-
souri, to Puget's Sound on the Pacific ocean.
The Rille regiment made the march across a con-
tinent, and endured more, and suffered more, and
cost more, than if they had been in the campaign
in Mexico. Troops, flying srjuadions of dia-
goons, are all the while scouring and overrunning
what I may call the innermost part of the coun-
try. The service is with them ali a service of
war ; and yet they exhibit no such expenditures
as these incurred here at home, m subduing only
eleven hundred Indians in Florida.
quartermaster's expenditures.
The expenses of transportation, of forage, and
in fact everything in California, are often ten times
greater than m other parts of this country; but
California is not less a part of the United "States,
and it is not less our duty to protect her people,
in each and every quarter, from the Indians, as
much as if these Indians were m Tennessee, New
York , or Alabama. 1 have before me a paper, too
long to rend, containing all the expenditures of the
quartermaster's department for a larg-e number of
years. Those expenditures have been larger for
a long time, than they have shown upon their face, ;
m the estimates, especially during, ana in conse-
quence of, the Mexican war, from a system too i
complicated for me here to explain, because I have
not time to do so. But the actual expenditures of
the quartermaster's department, for the year end- '
ing 30th June, 1849—'the closing year of Mr.
Polk's Administration—were $6",090.976. Mr.
Polk estimated (peace estimates, June 30, 1848,)
$4,430,000. Congress (August 18, 1818) apr.ro-'
priated onlv §2,940,000. The next year, Decern- 1
ber, 1848, the estimates made by Mr. Polk were for >
|| again, from General Jesup'sestimate, as 1 am pre-
pared to substantiate, and as I fear, because there
was an incoming Whig Administration. The
estimates, December, 134^, were for $2,000,000,
and the expenditures were $5,338,969. Such
are the legacies of debt in the quartermaster's de-
partment, which have been left us by a preceding
Administration. The following table of actual ex-
penditures in the quartermaster's department will
explain itself:

The only complaint I make, Mr. Chairman,
against General Jesup is, that he has not had the
courage at all times to face the Executive and Con-
gress,and tell them both ofall these expenditures—
what and how indispensably necessary they were.
He should have let the country understand from the
; start what was the cost of the Mexican war, and
! the cost of the Mexican acquisitions. And though
j he has been a soldier, who has faced battle and
i war, yet in the Executive Chamber I fear that he
! has not had the courage to face Mr. Polk and his
| estimates at every hazard.
i responsibility of the quartermaster general.
^ 1 know it is said that the quartermaster is not
i responsible for all his expenditures. I understand
| that argument, and a11 the force there is in it.
i Here is a book containing the legulations of the
j quartermaster's department. It is the Army Reg-
j ulations; and it appears from this that he" has a
! complete administrative control of all the officers
1 belonging to his department: that it is his duty
j " to provide quarters, hospitals, and transporta-
; Uon for all military stores, provisions, camp and
I garrison equipage;" " good and sufficient store-
! houses for all military stores;" " to purchase all
fuel, forage, straw, and stationery;" •' to purchase
, all horses, oxen, mules, and harness, and all wag-
| ons, carts, and boats;" " to purchase dragoon and
! artillery horses;" " saddles, bridles, and other
: necessary equipments;" " to provide materials,
| and direct and superintend the constructing and
j repairing of quarters, barracks, hospitals, store-
houses, stables, and other necessary and author-
, lzed buildings for the army, and the security of
; public property, (Art. 77-927.) I quote the fol- '
lowing from the Army Regulations:
933. '• Tt shall be the duty of the quaitermaster ceneral
to make himself acquainted wirh the ft miners, both man-
time and interior; and with all the principal avenue lend-
ing to the contiguous Indian and foreign territories; with
trie nnlitaiy resources of the country; and the mean* and
facilities .of transportation, paihcularly of the di-tnct* on
tile frontiers; with the most eligible points for concentrating
tioops and collecting supplier, whether in relation to often-
sive oj defensive operations ; with the relative expense of
concentrating at particular position-, and the advantage* of
those positions; and he^hall he prepared at all times to give
detailed information on those subjects, when jequued to do
so, either by the Secretary of War or the General ni-<,'hief
9'M "Ho shall, under the order?, oi with the approba-
tion, of the Sen clary of War, oi the Geneial-m--Chiel, des-
ignate the routc< or communication between the different
po>t>and cuiim^; the course of military roads, and the Mtes

supplies required !oi Die service of his depaitment. and he
snail prepaie and Mibnnt, lor the sanction of the vSeeietary
ofWar, plans for barracks, quarters, and other improve-
ment?, and cause the plans, when approved, to be carried
into efiect, a-  far as thy mean* provided by Congiess shall
enable him."
I might go on through the 1078 sections of the
quartermaster's duties, to show his responsibilities. -
The most important branch of the army is his.
Without him nothing of importance can be done,
and, indeed, everything depends upon him. I
know there will be an attempt to evade for him,
1 and to avoid for him, these responsibilities, be-
cause the Administration cannot be struck at with-
out striking him down first; and in striking
him down, an army officer, not of our political
faith, will be struck at; but there he is; these are
his duties, these are his responsibilities; and no
petty quibbling, nor artful dodging, can relieve
him; and I am sure he himself does not wish to be
relieved from any duty the Army Regulations im-
pose upon him.
expenses increased by congress 3850-
It must be borne in mind, that Congress has
: largely increased the army since the ppnee estab-
) lishment of 1845. It has created the costly regi-
! ment of mounted riflemen. In 1845, January 1st,
< the organization of the army was 8,654; but Jan-
| uary 1st, 1852, it was 12,311. By the act of
| June J7th, 1850, all companies serving at the sev-
■ eral military posts on the Western frontier, and
| at remote and distant stations, are entitled to 70
| privates each, and at other stations the number of
. privates per company is:
| In the dragoons. . 55 Additional,

The additional cost of supporting a regiment of
cavalry over and above that of a regiment of in-
fantry is as follows:
On the frontier of Missouri or Iowa, $139,827
In Texas  213,331
In New Mexico  343,548
The act of June 17th, 1842, also raised the
bounty on enlistments, in lieu of transportation, to
sums ranging from $23 to $142.
Examination of such facts as these will show
why and how there have been increased the ex-
penses of the army.
! the expenses of the government.
: I hasten on from this dry and tedious detail; but
! I cannot flatter you, however, that I shall present
i any detailed statement less dry. It has been said
; that the expenditures of this Government have run
up to $50,000,000; and I am asked, I think I hear,
"How is it that you Whigs have thus run up the
: aggregate expenses of the Government, and that
now, when you got along, under John Gluincy
Adams, with only some $12,000.1)00, you esti-
mate some $42,892,299 to be necessary for the fis-
cal year ending July 1, 1853 ?" Indeed, an hon-
orable member from Indiana has already entered
into this sort of fiscal criticism, and I am prepared
to answer him, and all others with him.
In the iii st place, I ask his attention to the legacy
of debts and the legacy of appropriations bequeath-
ed to us by the Mexican war. War is a costly as
well as a bloody luxury, and it is always well to
comprehend its cost as well as its glories.
legacy of debt.
The Mexican war left upon the country an im-
mediate national debt of about $80,000,000, exclu-
sive of pensions, bounty lands, and the annual
additional, but incalculable, cost of governing and
keeping what we won from, or bought of, Mexico.
The ten million Texas indemnity bill may be
added to that, for all that is yet to be paid, with
interest for fourteen years. The Mexican war
bounty lands absorbed 6,036,960 acres of the pub-
lic lands, worth, at $1 25 per acre, $7,546,200;
and the bounty land bill of September 28th, 1850,
some, if not most of which, in some form or other,
is for soldiets serving in consequence of the Mex-
ican war, absorbs,it is estimated, 48,000,000 acres
more, worth $60,000,000. (See/Treasury report,
