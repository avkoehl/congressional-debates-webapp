Atlanta, bringing up the rear of the corps, without annoyance from the enemy. Passed through Atlanta, and encamped on the Decatur road, about three miles from the center of the city.

In the foregoing I have said but little of the artillery - Battery A, First Ohio, Captain Goodspeed, and Battery M, First Illinois, Captain Spencer. I cannot conclude this report without bearing testimony to the gallantry and efficiency with which these batteries have been served throughout this campaign. Placed in every position as occasion served, sometimes on the skirmish line, again in line of battle, and at other times replying to the enemy's guns at long range, I have never called upon them in vain to repel an attack, or to silence the enemy's batteries.

I have been ably and zealously seconded by the brigade commanders, Generals Kimball, Wagner, and the lamented Harker, General Bradley, Colonels Sherman and Opdycke.

I wish likewise to call the attention of the commanding general to the efficiency and gallantry of my staff: Captain Tinney, at one time assistant adjutant-general of the division; Captain J. S. Bliss, aide-de-camp, Sixty-seventh New York Volunteers, wounded; Lieutenant H. W. Jackson, aide-de-camp, Fourth New Jersey Volunteers, wounded at Kenesaw, June 27; Lieutenant E. Carrington, aide-de-camp; Captain Ransom, provost-marshal, Forty-fourth Illinois; Captain Morgan, acting assistant inspector-general, Seventy-third Illinois; and also to zeal and efficiency with which their respective duties were performed by Captain Mallory, commissary of subsistence; Lieutenant Van Pelt, acting assistant quartermaster; Captain Hill, assistant quartermaster; Lieutenant Douglass, ordnance officer; and by Doctors Bowman and Glick, chief surgeons of the division.

throughout this campaign of four months' duration, undertaken in the heats of summer, unprecedented in the fatigues and exposures it has caused, I have had more than reason to be proud of the officers and men of this division. In battles, in bloody skirmishes, in marches, they have more than realized my expectations.
