SAINT PAUL, MINN., August 25, 1862-2.30 p.m.

E. M. STANTON:

The Indian war is still progressing. I have sent up the Sixth Regiment and called out 1,000 horsemen. The panic among the people has depopulated whole counties, and in view of this I ask that there be one month added to the several dates of your previous orders for volunteers, draft, &amp;c.-22nd August be 22 September; 1st September be 1st October; 3rd September be 3rd October. In view of the distracted condition of the country this is absolutely necessary.

ALEX. RAMSEY.

I have a full knowledge of all the facts, and I urge a concurrence in this request.

WM. P. DOLE,

Commissioner Indian Affairs.

Washington, August 25, 1862.

Governor RAMSEY,

Saint Paul, Minn.:

The Secretary of War directs me to say that a regiment of mounted infantry for three-months' service will be received.

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.

FORT LARAMIE, WYO., August 25, 1862-5.10 p.m.

Major-General HALLECK:

Governor Harding, of Utah, in dispatch of to-day in relation to re-enlistment of Mormon troops, after saying he had interview with Brigham Young, closed dispatch as follows: "You need not expect anything for the present. Things are not right."

I am satisfied rebel agents have been at work among the Indians. Many regiments who passed through to Salmon River mines were from border slave States, and some had left home because it was too hot. I will try to raise company of mounted men, as authorized by Secretary of War.

JAS. CRAIG,

Brigadier-General.

SAINT LOUIS, MO., August 25, 1862.

General LOAN,

Lexington, Mo.:

You will take command of the Central Division. General Totten has gone to Springfield. Governor Hall has been appointed brigadier-general, and will command the Northwest. General Totten has taken with him 1,200 men, and some more must be sent. When will you be at Sedalia?

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Brigadier-General.
