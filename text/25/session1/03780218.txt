25th Cong....1st Sess.                                  Making public officers depositories—Mr, Bayard.                                                    Senate.
lew, that (he patronag  and political influences,
with which its use bv these corpora ions must b 
attended, together with the great incentive which it
ofFer3 to overdcaling, arc objections fai stronger
And from such inaction of the public money, I
should look lor another gre?t practical good It
would invite, in the most urgent manner, as a fixed
policy, a scale of revenue reduced to the lowest
standard of the most economical administration
And again by confining its receipts to gold and
silver, the collection of the revenue would exer-
cise a salutary control ovpr the issue of the State
banks It would do so, by presenting at their
doors, to the extent of that demand, always an in-
exorable creditoi , a curb sadly wanted bv thet
banks in their late career The receip* bj Gov-
ernment of gold and silver only, after the paper
medium becomes freely and immediately conveiti-
ble íato com, presents nothing inconsistent with the
position that Govpi nment must deal in the same
currency m which the peop'e deal, because coin,
and paper, immediately convertible, are substantially
the same
But I can see no advantage, and on the contrary,
a fruitful source ot mischief, in making Govern-
ment officers the keepers of the cash Place about
them what guards you may, in the shape of com-
missioneis, inspectors, or whatever else, peculation
will be endless There is no security m it, and it
will involve heavj and unnecessary expense The '>
chief and overruling objection, however, is the
endless source of patiomgc to which it would give
rise. Make the machinery as simple as 3 ou mij,
and open to Mew, wherever money is, temptat on
will creep in, and corruption m every form follow-
ing at its heels But the money can 1 e safely
kept, under the most ample seeunty, and freed
from every objecti n of pattonage < r political in-
fluence, by a simple system of special deposites in
the State banks—remaining always in specie, the
sépai ale pi op'i ty of th" Goveinmm ind paid out
in kind, upon drafts fiom the treasury
I have thus, sir, stated mv objections candid >
and fairly to this bill They go more to us pecu-
liar machinen, and to the time at which it is
biought forward, than to ns atneial scope, as a
measure of State policy m the snlject which it is
intended to affect There is no sufficient íeason,
as I have already declared, satisfactory to my mind
at least, why it shoul 1 be passed now, it the close
of a short and hurried session And I take leave
of it, therefore, in lh<s confident hope, that thisgrcat
subject of the relations between bank and State
will, at a future day, be presented in such foim is
will unite these counsels. «Inch >uc now so unhap-
pily divided
SPEECH OF MR. BAYARD,
Of  Dplawarc
In Senate, Oclobet 2, 1837—The bill imposing addi-
tional duties as depositim s of the public moneys,
on certain olhceis of the Government, bei g un-
der considcrmon—.
Mr BAYARD of Del i ware iddress >d the Senate
as follows
Mr President No one can he more deeply im-
pressed with a sense oí the imp írlance of the sub-
ject now undei consider ilion than nij elf, eons lei-
mg, as I do, that it uiv ol\ es in its eui s< qu-nce> the
welfare of the wht le community In the i ouise of
the debate which has taken place, m m) co" Ueral
matters have been introduced, whtcn hat > diverted
the attention of the Senate from 'he ip ' quesdo i,
to whitfh I wish again to diaw its j> ttnuo i
The b II now before us proposes tinte measures,
the first of w hu r s, to c' ssolv i> all connection w th
the banks, second y, to su isu ate t \< a^encv ol cer-
tain o/hceis, thine i i iou't en t oilman t inn ira-
ber, for mat of the i m, n 11,11,111? revenn s
of the G< eriraeit and tm c'H , to icouve a'iri
certain pellod, ii< img but°"Md andsmu ci in m
payment oí Government uies T e obj ch which
are said to be contemple t d is 1 e lesiilis of these
meantes, are, first, to secne th  G vernm°it
against loss m the keeping of (ic-sjie, and,
secondly, to provide a emiencv Oi gold and siher
coin, which is declared to be the constitutional cur
rene} The measures themselves have nothing to
recommend them beyond then suppeseel tendency
to accomplish these objects Before proceeding,
however, to the discussion of these matters, it is
necessaiy to have a just and precise conception of
the objects, the accomplishment of which is said to
be contemplated
The first, which respects the fact of secunty
against loss 111 keeping the public treasure, is easily
understooc, but the other, and favorite object, of
providing a currency of gold and siher com, re-
quires some explanation It has been supposed,
sir, and I confess I entertained the sime opinion,
that some oi those who advocate these measuies
were bent on procuring a purely metallic currency
fot the country, to the exclusion of all paper, while
others we-e aiming only at a laiger infusion of the
precious metals into the circulating medium, being
perfectly satisfied that a considerable part of it
si ould still consist of convertible paper I am
convinced, however, from a closer a tention to what
has heretolote passed on this subject, that the views
of all of us are diree'ed merely to the enlargement
of the metallic portion of thecuirency, bj changing
the ratio of the m xlure of paper and com, as it
existed before the suspension of specie payments
The case is not, dieicfore, rightly presented by the
Senator from Missouri (Mr Benton,) when he
states it to be a contest between opposi e systems
of paper and com, but, in fact, whatever difference
of opinion exists 111 íelation to the cuirency is
merely as to the relaliv e proportions in which paper
and coin should compose it.
No one, at least to my knowledge, Mr Presi-
dent, has professed to countenance, much less to
recommend, an inconvertible paper medium, ex-
cept, indeed, the Senatoi from South Carolina,
(Mr Calhoun,) who seems to think that a Govern-
ment paner is the only safe one I shall proceed-
therefore, to show vvh-it aie the different views en,
t named on this subj ct, and the probable cilect
which the different propositions heretcforemade for
the suppression of notes of a low denomination
would have upon the currency The Senator from
Mission, (Mr Benton,) «ho has taken the lead
upon this subject of metallic curreiuv, may very
fairl) be taken as the exponent of the views of
those who are most par ill to the precions 1 letals
His proposition is to suppuss all notes undei one
hundred dolíais, as appiars from the speech deli-
vered by him on the 27th January, 1837, on the
resolution to rescind the Treasury orde", in which
he ci'es h speech on the subject of the District
bmk 111 the piece ling sp^sj >, is containing his
vieus on the suhiect The following is an exiiact
torn that speech
"Mi   Benton «aid   that   the  piopo ed   hunt of
twenty do'lais fen the minimum size of bank n< tes
wis not an arbitiary assumpt on or a fanciful de-
signation,  but  was a limit  ascertained  by expe-
rience, and p-oven by resu ts to be the lowest that
would suffice to accomplish the ends intended, these
ends are   1st   To re-establish  the gold currcne)
2d   To make go'd and  silver the common cur-
lency for all the small dealings of the c mntry   'id

p per "
It t' os appear", Mr Picsidenf, fh.it the most zea-
lous a Ivocati s 01 a bard money cirrency do not
contend ior ih" entire expu'sion of paper, but de-
si-c a tarter inf tton of preciojs metals into the
ciiculating medium We a-e all agreed as to die
edit us and unconstitutional character of a meie
paper cunency, for a mixed currency of coin and
convertible paper can not be denominated a paper
cuirency The difluent views, hen, which are
entertained as to the ratio of this mixture of paper
and coin 111 the cnculatmg medium, may be re-
duced to three clashes first, of those who, with the
Senator from Missouri, (Mr Benton,) are 111 favor
of a suppiession of bank notes vmcler $100 Se-
condly, of those who, with the Senatoi from Vir-
ginia, (Mr Rives,) are in favoi of a suppression
of all notes under $20, and thirdly, of loose who
are of opinion that the suppression of all notes
under j,l0will be sufficient to ensure a due pro-
portion of com in the circulation Before pro-
ceeding to my argument, I think it important to
the perfect compiehension of the matter, that we
should fiist settle, as nearly as practicable, the
effect which would be produced upon th« actual
cunency of the country by tne adoption of either
of the above suggestions Fortunately, sir, we
aie m t without tne means of doing so The re-
port of the Secretary of tne Treasury upon the
condi'ion of the State banks, made at the last ses-
sion of Congress, in thit part of it which rebates
to the banks in the State of New York, furnishes
some data for that purpose I t ike the 1 istance
of the New \ ork currency, because it is the only
one, the component ] ans of which are stited, and
I presume that those facts which are found to be
trup in relation to the paper part of that currency,
will be found to be nearly so m relation to
the paper pait of the currency of the whole
country, although it ¡s very probable that a
difference, more or less considerable, may be
found to exist m the currency of some par-
ticular States But so far as my argument is
concerned, it is of no consequence whethei the
statement be preoissly accurate or not, die object
being to give some definite idea of the practical
effect of those views In that report the entire
piper cuirency,on the 1st of January, 183G, of the
¡slate of New York, is stited to bo ¿,21,123,089,
wmcii, with the sum of ¿,4,000,000, the probable
amount oí the coin in circulation, would make
the entire currency of paper and com about
f>3,000,000 It appears from that repi rt, that the
whole number of bank notes in circulation of the
denomination of ¿.100 and upwaids, amounted to
$5,230,200, which is about one-fifth of the whole
currency, that the whole number of no'es m cir-
culation of the denomination of $20 and npwards,
amounted to the sum of nearly $8,000,000, or
about one-third of the whole currency, and that
the w hole number of notes in circulation of the
d nomination ol §10 and upwaids, amounted to
the sum of $12,2(5,765, 01 about one-half of the
entile currency It will follow , then, that to sup-
press ah notes undei $,100 would give four parts of
com, and one of paper, of the whole cuirene),
while the suppression of all notes under ¿,20 would
give two parts of com and one of paper, and the
suppression of all notes under $10 wocld giie a
cuirency one half of coin, and the other of paper
It is of no ct nsequence to my argument whether
these latios be exactly (died , it is sutticient if
they be un appirximat on to the truth. Let u-s
then apply tí em to the w hole currency of the
United States, and obseive the result
The Secretary of the Treasury, in his annual
lep rt on the stite of the finances, made at the
c mmencenvmlof the hast session of Congress, esti-
mated the entire enncnev of die United Stales on
tne Is of December, 1836, to b- $148 000 000, of
which &12Ü,0O0O0O were piper, a! d ¿33,000,000
coin As it is ntcessary to take some specific
amount Í01 the purpose of calculation, «e will tike
that tr up the actual amount of the entire currency
of the conntiy The effect upon *hat currency, of
the propositi >n to suppr ss all notes unoer $100,
would, from '1 e ana pg, of the New Yene cur-
rency be, to gve us ¿,118 400 000 of coin, and
$20 600,0 '0 of piper, as the «-eUtiv • proportion*
The propesiiioi to suppress all notes under $20
would give nearly 5999,000,000 ot com, and
•«,49,000,0)0 of papei, uhile that to suppiess all
notes imder ¿.10 vumll give $74,000,000 of coin,
a id $74,000,000 of paper Tms view of the mat-
ter is entirely distinct from the question of how
much com it js p-oper for the banks to keep in
their \ aults as the bases of their paper Circulation,
