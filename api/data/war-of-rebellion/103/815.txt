LEVI T. GRIFFIN,

Captain and Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIRST DIVISION, CAVALRY CORPS,Waterloo, Ala., March 2, 1865.

Major E. B. BEAUMONT,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Cavalry Corps:

MAJOR: I saw General Hatch to-day relative to the Spencer arms. He is willing, and would rather let me have them than see us march off into the enemy's country armed as we are. While I am exceedingly anxious to have the armament of the command improved, and at the same time utterly despair of obtaining any arms from Louisville, and think every Spencer carbine here ought to go, still I regard the generosity of Colonel Coon and General Hatch in the matter altogether without precedent as well as undeserved.

I am, major, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JNO. T. CROXTON,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers.

P. S.-The Spencers they have will enable me to arm the whole division with arms requiring metallic cartridges. If any order is made I prefer it should be to turn them over to me instead of the division ordnance officer, who is now absent.
