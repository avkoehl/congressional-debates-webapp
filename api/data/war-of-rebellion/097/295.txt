HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,March 30, 1865 - 7.55 a. m.

General MILES:

General Warren telegraphs, dated 6 a. m., just received -

I do not think it best to advance any farther until General Miles gets into position on my right, which, as the woods are difficult, will take some time. A broad, open field is in my front, with the enemy in force on the opposite side also night.

General Humphreys directs that you keep moving forward, keeping your connection with General Warren. Report constantly. Nothing has been heard here since early this morning.

CHAS. A. WHITTIER,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,March 30, 1865 - 12 m.

Brevet Major-General MILES,

Commanding First Division:

General Warren has just sent word that -

I am about sending out a division from the plank road north-northwest from Mrs. Biater's [Butler's] to reconnoiter and drive back the enemy, and shall follow up any engagement that may take place outside of the enemy's line of works with nearly all the corps.

The general commanding directs that you conform your movements to those of General Warren, extending to the left, if necessary, and remembering to notify General Mott of any movements which may become necessary on his part to keep up his connection with you.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

C. J. MILLS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,March 30, 1865 - 1.50 p. m.

Brevet Major-General MILES,

Commanding First Division:

Have you moved enough forward to see the enemy's main line of works? General Mott is about to push out his skirmishers to try to see their works, and General Humphreys is very anxious to get to the run to see what, if anything, is between here and there. Please report all you see.

CHAS. A. WHITTIER,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,March 30, 1865 - 2.10 p. m.

Brevet Major-General MILES,

Commanding First Division:

GENERAL: The general commanding directs that you intrench your line strongly and report at once by bearer, if possible, the number of troops you can spare to be sent away and the number of pieces in your front.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

C. J. MILLS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
