HEADQUARTERS RIGHT WING,July 29, 1862.

Brigadier-General WILCOX,

Commanding Fourth Brigade:

GENERAL: The major-general commanding directs that you make preparations to move your camp to-morrow to a point near Atlee's farm, on the Darbytown road.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. M. SORREL,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF NORTH CAROLINA,July 29, 1862.

I cordially recommend the raising of guerrilla companies, and the arming of them by the Government, to operate in the counties of Nansemond and Gates, or wherever the infernal Yankees and their rascally Dutch allies can be found. The special duty of these guerrillas is to kill the murderers and plunderers wherever they show their villainous faces.

D. H. HILL,

Major-General, Commanding District.

To save delay I hope that the arms may be sent at once, without waiting on the organization of the companies. In fact, the arms would facilitate the forming of companies.

D. H. H.

[Indorsement.]

Authorize General D. H. Hill to issue authority for companies of partisan rangers in the counties of Gates, N. C., and Nansemond, Va. Rolls are to be returned to the Adjutant-General and the officer commissioned. No restrictions as to age.

G. W. R.
