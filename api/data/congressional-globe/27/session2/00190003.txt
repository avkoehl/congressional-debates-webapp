that House now governed by Parliamentary law,
wha* was that law, and under its application what
should be the form of the p" vions question. Tbrrp
must be, in his opinion, a Parliamentary law of
some kind, o'herwjse the House must be governed
by the arbitrary will of the Speaker—a state of
thiDgs which ne was sure the Speaker was anxious
to avoid. Without undertaking to «ay what the
Parliamentary law was, wheiher the decisions of
the B'itiah Parliament or the previous decisions of
this House or both tigelher, be would assume that
there was a Parliamentary Uw of some kind, and
wou'd, therefore, vote to sustain, the decision of the
Chair
Mr. CHARLES BROWN observed that, before
he would be willing to be governed by the Parlia-
mentary law, be wanted to know where a wa¡> to
be found The gentleman from Massachusetts
sate that, if there was no Parliamentary law, they
must be governed by the arbitrary will of the
Speaker. Wow, he would prefer being governed
by the arbitrary decisions qf that' House, If, ex
necessitate, there mast be a Parliamentary law, he
wou'd pre/er taking the laws of thetr predecessor
—those which prevailed at the Isst sesfion—to
being governed by tbe Jaws of the Bn.ish
Parliament. He was opposed to the previous ques-
tion. He was for free discussicn, and he would
remird ¡ne Hou e that it was the ¿emal of the right
of being heard that had occasioned th ir greatest
difficul íes it he was to be driven, forced gagged,
and compcl'ed to vot' on t'nsor nat quest en, with-
out tbe privilege i f being he ard, he tor erne would,
like all rbsntidtt* peeplp, pud back
Mr WIPE sa d he for s„w that if this debate
was continued, ir would cu' off ail the other busi-
ness of the Hou e. He hoped geniiemen woul',
by general conten', agree to appoint a committee,
in conjunction with th  commitice of the Senite,
to wan on. the President and inform bim that the
two Houses are organized and ready to receive
any commnmca i n he may make
Mr. BRiGGh suggested w the gen ¡eman from
Virginia to modify his motion, so a- to send a mes-
sage to the Sánate, íaform ng that body of the or-
gan za ion of tie Hou^e, and of the 8ppointmeent
of aJjmt Commit'ee to watt on the President.

A message was ¡eeeived from the fenafe by Mr.
Dickers, their Secuia^y, stating that that body
had concurred in the joint resolution of the Hou^e
for the appointment of a commd'ee to wait on the
President, and that they had appoirted Messrs
Bayard and Bates as the commit'ee on their part
Tne question th?n came up on Mr. Stanly's
amendment—when
Mr. ATHERTON observed that if the amend-
ment prevailed, it would, while in operation, pre-
clude alt petitions except those on the subjects
embraced in the P.estdenl's mes-age of the last
session In addition to what had been said bv tbe
Senator from Massachusetts, that it would deprive
ths people of the United States of the right of pe-
tition for fifteen days, he would observe that the
rule referred to was only to be con>idered m force
for ¡he last session. Mr. A called for fie reading
of the rule, and U was read as follow:
["Upon die presentation of petitions, and other
papers on subjects not specially refered to the con-
sideration of the House m the me sage of the Pre-
sident at the opening of the precent extra session, ;
objection to the reception ¡¡hall be con«idered as |
male, and the question of recepticn shall be laid
on the tab'e— his rule to te ron«'rler"d only m
force during the present se«si n. Petitions and
other papers for or against a bankrupt law, to be
excep'ed from the operai on of th s rule. The ac-
tion of fll c^rimittces on all subjec s not specially
referred to th  con^i lera'ion o' tt>e H u e in ,l e
mes*a_e of the President, sh >ll be si>ep=nc'ed during
the present ses^ oi—'h'a suspension not to apply to
business before the Comtmltees of Elections, of
Wa>s and Means, on Accounts and on Mileage,
nor, it the H'ni«e ^hatl so det°rmine, to the subject
of a general oankrupt law "]
Toe quest on was then taken on Mr Stanly's
amendm-n ; and it wasrej cted—jeas 83, najs fe6,
