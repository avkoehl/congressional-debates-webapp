HDQRS. FIRST CAVALRY, MISSOURI STATE MILITIA,Warrensburg, Mo., January 19, 1864.

GENERAL: I have the honor to state that Lieutenant Couch and the troops that went to his assistance have returned. Lieutenant Couch reports that he pursued the rebels until 10 o'clock at night of the 16th, and searched all day of the 17th for them. They scattered during the night of the 16th and could not be found on the 17th. It is reported by Lieutenant Couch that Blunt's band numbers about 50 men, and that is it rumored there is another band under Todd in the vicinity of Round Prairie, Jackson County, number unknown. Some of our men from Lexington, under Lieutenant Kessinger, found a camp near Pink Hill, in Jackson County, on the 15th; the campfires were burning, but the rebels could not be found. The camp discovered by Lieutenant Couch was in Jackson County, about 3 miles west of the La Fayette County line, near west of Chapel Hill. There are no indications of red legs on the western boundary of this sub-district as yet. There is no other news of interest.
