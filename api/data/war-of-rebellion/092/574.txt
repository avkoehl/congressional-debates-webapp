Major General W. T. SHERMAN,

General-in-Chief:

I have the honor to inform you that one division of the Fourteenth Corps is encamped near Louisville, on the Augusta road, and one division on the Waynesborough road; the other division - and one division of the Twentieth Corps, in charge of my entire trains - is between this point and Louisville. General Williams with two divisions has completed the destruction of the railroad to the river, and I have ordered him to join me here to-morrow, by marching up the west side of the orders at this point. I shall build a bridge over Big Creek to-night. I find all bridges destroyed and the crossings swampy and difficult. General Kilpatrick has returned to Louisville. He destroyed portions of the road between Millen and Augusta, and had some severe fighting with Wheeler. Captain Audenried is here, and will leave for your headquarters to-morrow morning.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. W. SLOCUM,

Major-General.
