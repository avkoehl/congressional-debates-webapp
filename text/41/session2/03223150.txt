THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
May 2,
Mr. CHANDLER. The Committee on Com*
roerce propose to amend the bill by adding the
following as a new section:
And be it further enacted, That the President of the
United States be, and he is hereby, authorized, by
and with the advice and consent of tho Senate, to
appoint a surveyor for the port of Eastport, in tho
district of Passamaquoddy, Maine, who shall have
the same power and be subject to the same duties as
other surveyors of the oustoins.
Mr. POMEROY. That does not belong on
this bill.
Mr. CHANDLER. Yes, sir; it is germane
to the bill.
Mr. POMEROY. To a bill to create a port
of delivery in California?
Mr. CHANDLER. It is establishing a port
of delivery, and is therefore germane. I was
authorized to pat it on the appropriation bill
by the committee.
Mr. POMEROY. This bill is to create a
port of delivery in California.
Mr. CHANDLER. The amendment restores
a port of delivery in Maine. I was directed to
put it in the general appropriation bill.
Mr. COLE. I hope the Senator from Mich-
igan will not put that on this bill. It does not
seem exactly germane.
Mr. CHANDLER. It is precisely germane.
Mr. COLE. Maine is very distant from
California.
Mr. CHANDLER. This reestablishes a
port of delivery which was dropped by acci-
dent.
Mr. COLE. I hare no objection; but the
Senator from Maine disputes the fact.
Mr. BUCKINGHAM. I notice that the
Senator from Oregon has presented a bill not
unlike the one, but having reference to Beni-
cia, which, if it shall pass, will render this
altogether unnecessary.
,. Mr. COLE. That Dill will not pass; no
one wants it passed, I apprehend, though it is
reported.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The question is
on the amendment of the Senator from Mich-
igan.
Mr. CHANDLER. I withdraw it at the
suggestion of Senators.
The bill was reported to the Senate, ordered
,to be engrossed for a third reading, read the
third time, and passed.
Mr. BUCKINGHAM. I move to reconsider
the vote on the passage of the bill.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The motion will
.be entered.
Mr. COLE. I hope the Senator will present
some reason why it should be reconsidered. I
do notthink it should be done withouta reason.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The motion to
reconsider will be entered.
AMERICAN REGISTERS.
_ The next business on the Calendar was the
joint resolution (H. R. No. 227) graqting an
American register to the British-built schooner
Venilia; which was considered as in Commit-
tee of the Whole. '
The Committee on Commerce reported an
amendment, to add to the bill the following:
^Provided, That the owner* of the said lohooner
Venxlia shall pay into tho Treasury of the United
States a tax or duty of twenty per cent., payable in
coin, on the cost or purchase-money of the wreck of
said schooner. .
Sic. 2, And be it further en/icted, That the Secretary
of tho Treasury be, and he is hereby, authorized and
â€¢directed to issue certificates of registry or enrollment
.and license U> the following Canadian-built vessels,
namely: to the bark Cambria, the bark Mary Jane,
the bark Niagara, and the bark Cecilia, said vessels
being owned by citizens of the United States, and
having been employed upon thewaters of the lakes:
Provided, That there shall be paid upon each of said
loreign-buiit vessels a tax or duty of twenty per
cent. on the present value of said vessels, payable in
c >in. the value of said vessels to be ascertained in
the same manner as upon im portations of goods fro in
foreign countries, according to rules and regulations
to bo prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury.
Mr. NYE. I object to that bill.
. The VICE PRESIDENT. The bill will be
passed over.
Mr. RAMSEY. I suggest to the Senator from
Missouri to renew his motion. 'It is time for
it. The Senate is doing no business.
Mr. HAMLIN. I want to appeal to the Sen-
ator from Nevada to let us take a vote on this
joint resolution. I want to make a statement.
Mr. NYE. Here are five others.
Mr. HAMLIN. I want to state the facts,
and to appeal to the Senator from Michigan to
withdraw his amendment.
Mr. NYE. I have had a light here over the
bark Cambria before, and I am not going to
permit a register to be issued to her if 1 can
help it.
Mr. HAMLIN. I am with you.
Mr. NYE. I withdraw the objection for the
present.
Mr. HAMLIN. Now I want to state in a
very few minutes this case. The bill is a House
bill, and it provides for granting a register to
a British-built schooner. It has been the prac-
tice of our Government always to grant a regis-
ter to a foreign-built vessel that has been wrecked
in our waters, when it has been repaired, and
the repairs are equal to three fourths of the
cost of tbe vessel. That is your law. The
parties in this case purchased the vessel Venilia
on the rock. When purchased she was sup-
Eosed to be valueless, good for nothing; but
y a streak of good fortune and a high tide
she got off, and was repaired for a little less
than the three fourths of her cost; the papers
say more than two thirds. The House of Rep-
resentatives, on a letter of the Secretary of
the Treasury* have passed a bill authorizing
the Secretary to give a register to that vessel;
and that vessel has been lying in dock for a
year. Now it has gone to our committee, and
they have put on it an amendment which pro-
vides for letting in foreign-built vessels, vio-
lating all the law and all the custom of the
country. I have seen riders put on to bills by
individuals 
Mr. CHANDLER. "Will the Senator allow
me a moment?
Mr. HAMLIN. Certainly.
Mr. CHANDLER; This was a rider put on
by his colleague on this identical bill. We have
returned the bill just as it passed the Senate
last year and is now before the House. There-
fore, I object to the bill, and move that it be
laid aside. On examination I find that the
bill, justasitstands, as the committee reported
it, passed the Senate before, and this, the Sen-
ator's vessel, was put on as a rider.
Mr. DRAKE. I move that the Senate do
now adjourn.
The motion was agreed to; and the Senate
adjourned.
