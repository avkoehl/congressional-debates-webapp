Lieutenant Colonel J. A. HARDIE,

Inspector-General:

I have the honor to request authority, through the War Department, of His Excellency the President of the United States to state to the honorable Secretary of War conversations, suggestions, and orders which took place and were given me confidentially, in order that I amy enable the honorable Secretary of War to judge correctly of action in regard to the churches and prayers place. Not having authority to divulge these things, I am convinced my action has been judged incorrectly. With regard to Mr. Dana's statement, it is a matter between him and my chief of staff, General Shepley.
