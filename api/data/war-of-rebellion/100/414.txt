Lieutenant Colonel MAX. WOODHULL,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Fifteenth Army Corps:

COLONEL: I have the honor to report that I moved my division from Nottoway River to Stony Creek, breaking camp at 6. 30 a. m. and going into bivouac on the left bank of Stony Creek at 3 p. m. I pursued the Gaston road to its intersection with the old stage road, thence upon the latter to the creek above referred to crossing Nottoway River en route. Owing to the severe march made by my troops on the 5th instant, and the reception of your order being at so late an hour, it was impracticable to move my command at the hour designated in your letter. I have marched a distance of seventeen miles this instant.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
