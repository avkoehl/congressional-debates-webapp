If you send to him, will you please ask him to give me duplicates of any dispatches which might need my immediate action.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

P. S. - Nearly all the trains are now in the vicinity of Rutherford's Creek on the Franklin pike. I have an outpost of sixty men at the creek; should there be a stronger detachment there?

Brigadier General J. C. COX,

Commanding Third Division, Twenty-third Army Corps:

GENERAL; Our whole force will be across the river to-night. General Stanley has sent his artillery across the ford at Columbia; some of the artillery from the fort was sent over at the same place. Please see that they are cared for; also watch well the ford, and meet any attempt the enemy may make to cross at that place. I will probably come around to see you pretty early in the morning. I shall want the benefit of your information in selecting a position for the enemy.

Very respectfully,

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.
