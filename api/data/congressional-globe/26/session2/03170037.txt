dian title shall be extinguished at any time during
the continuance of tha pre emptiun light.
This bill confers other benefits than those which
have "been mentioned It gives the sett er liberty
to make hi  improvement and settlement on dif-
ferent quarter sectior , and m such case allow 
him to "make choice of the quarter he will lake,
or take parts of each in legal subdivisions," if not
prejudicial to ihe lights of other1 What a power
is here given ' and what opportunity is iFoided to
gam pnonty in the purchase of the best of the
public lands ' The settler may, if he p'ease, erect
his dwelling on different quarter section  He
may select those wh ch are parlicu'arly valuable
in quality, or which possess important water pu-
vileges or other pdvantdgrs Trey may b conn-
guous to each other in i'iffeient quarter sections
And when ihe period arrives that Lis pre emp ion
right is to be penected, he may select an en ire
quarter section, or parts of each, shu out all < ther
during the ti ne alio ?< J him to make the parcha e«t,
and thus gain priority as to one entir° quaitei
section, or to portu ns of twp, at his election Can
any good reason be given for such a It nse as
this? Why should he be allowed to ettle on ad-
joining quarter section , and then avail It ms°lf of
the peculiar pnviltges cf both, to the exclus.on
of other equally meritorious settler"'
This bill al«o saves, m one event, the pre erup-
tion in   more lhan one hundiedani sixty acre0.
For although, in the fir^t seen n,  it pro /jdes that
the settler *hall be   limi ed to a  quantity  not ex
ceedmg "one   quarter section,  in lesal sibdivi-
sions," it  declares, m th  4th section,  that where
this quant ty ennot be had entire, the- en nes may
be ma 'e in tracts of eighty acre?, or forty acres, or
fractions,  and  when   the fracli n shall be mow
than the quantity required   to compute f-e  pre
eruption, the excels shall be paid for   and the pre
emption rw;htsh,.ll extend to the  vxhole fraction
It will be seen th t there is no piobibitton  to set-
tling <natr?ct, v here the qjirtity cannot be had
entire, and oí ce uise  "O h i g  to preven', in sii"h
case , an e Ary m fiac ons, an 1, ineasp of excess
a right to more il an a quarter  sfouou     It would
be difficu't to assign a sausfac   ry iea on for coi -
ferriug'uch a pnvi ege
Another nnusuai   unnec ssarj, and no t extra-
ordinary pa/ilí>£,e  i-, conferred by this tul  on  tho
settier¿oatue par he hud      B^ the lav of 1838
it was enacted i hat where tiore trun   ere  person
bad settled upon   any one qasrter  sectn n, each
should have an equal share in it, but shou d have
no claim to any oiher land by  virtue of that act
The policy of ih s piovision is quite obvious    Its
justice is equally apparent    By the present but, if
two or more persons shall have settled on the same
quarter section, it shall be divided between them,
and the deficiency made up to each out of the con
tiguous vacant ground, excluding, however, from
the benefit oí this provision, a wi'ful intruder on
the known claim cf another    It will be seen that
the pre emption right to what  is equivalent to a
whole quarter section attaches m favor of eactj set-
tler, where there is more  than one, on the same
quarter section, and it is to  be  remembered  that
there is no prohibition to an amic?b'e settlement
and improvement, by two c r more,  of the same
I now ask the attention of the Senate to the con e
quences wmch may follow  from   toe adoption of
this provision, e pecislly vhen taken in connection
with other  pro  i ions  to wh.ch I h^vr-  atverted
Any number of individuals n ay a soua e to m
prove the same quarter  section     Tne h ad of a
family who has several sins over eighteen yirs of
ags may put thejn m such a s euon, and oo aiu for
bi nself, through th-m   or   they   miy  obt-un   frr
themselves, e?ch,   one hundred an t  s xiy "rrr0
Combinad n o   perse ns, in any numbers, may be
formed, for the very purpose of acqu rin  th  prior
right of purchase of this quantity    Hundred may
associate from every nati n upen earib, entT upon
the same quarter section, erect a building just suf-
ficient to held their persons, improve the sma lest
portion oí the laid  and for th° short =t time, and
then each has a lawful claim to what i  equal to a
quarter section     This  would  indeed give ai in-
choate right to a very large quant.ty of   the public
lands.   It would spread ever laimense tracts of
the national domain the beneficial lien of pre-emp-
tion. It «ou dick it up fi >m the enterprise of
others It u oald secure it, for a limi'ed period, from
the claims of all others. It might, if earned to its
extreme hmils,bindmovt of the valuable lands of the
TJ States, which are subject to the operation of the
bi'I, witn the s'ioigcordof pre emption, and whi^h
no law could break And will the Senate adopt a
measure pr ducmg such resnl ? Will they open
the pub'ic lands, to pdventurers of any and every
character from every por ion of ihe world, and al-
low them to nmp in ma1 mg a fraudulent settle-
ment and obtain as th~ fiui s of it a quarter sec
t on for ejeh? Do cur Weskrn friends desire 'uch
privilege to bt given, lmhssritmnaely to those
who chco e to avail themselves of them'* Will this
give to the new St-tes a hcahhv, sound, industrious,
and perm-men* population Is this for the benefit
of the p or man who ceek¡> a home m the Far
West, bull's hslig cabin, improves the grourd
and in good f^itn in end to become a permanent
set'ler1!
This bill s open, 1 owever, to objections even of

of t le act f f 1838 provided against the mischief to

Th-it   act required of   (he person   claiming  the

on the land  uhiei he claimed in his ov n light
and  e\ciusiyjv   for h's   own use   ard   len-Ti',

cept hi   Eei, ir to <ori7ey Oi transfer  the land or
title to any o her paso i ci ¡ursors at any   uh e-
qu nt time, making false swearing in Ihe premises
perjury, and working a forfeiture of the money
paid for the land, and declaring all grants or con-
veyances made m pursuance of any such agree-
menl or contract void, ex ept m the hands of a
purchaser in good faith, for a valuable considera-
tion, without none Such was ihe guard thrown
around the Government and honest seMlers, to pro-
tect both against fraudulent settlemen's No such
protection, nor any other, is afforded by this bill.
If it should piss in its present form, settlements
may be made, not for the use and benefit of those
who make them, but for ihose who have no other
literest in the land than to make gamo by the sale
of it at an advanced pnce, and who are to be en-
couraged in such speculations by being invested by
the Govern nent cf the United Sates with the
privilege of pre emp'ion Surely such log cabin
settlers have no peculiar claims upon the bounty or
11 the favor of Corigress.
To these objections to the bill is to be adde"d
aiother Ev ry ques ion sr sing under this act,
bo h of law and oi fact, touching the construction
ef this law, ihe p oof of settlement and im-
p o ement, and all questions in relation to pre-
empt on claims, or between claimants to the
same quarter seclien, are to be settled, sum-
nauly and drfUnterj , by the regis er and receiver
of the distric , a«"-ceaUy to 'he rules which may be
pi-fsTn-ed bj and undei the direction of the Com-
missioner ol he General Lam1 Office No judicial
tribunal is to hear an 1 del rmme these quest oas
No court is to cons rue and declare the law,
and no juty is 'o pass upon the facts The register
and receiver arc to proeeed summarily, and decide
finally Ought such a powei as this to be vested
nhcretnsbll propeses to puce it? And ought
not the rules nh ch are to govern in the determma-
tioi of the m?ny and vano is poms which will

make so ne gereral regulations, uh ch wcul 1 reach

Thio bill aho provid s for a permanent pre-emp-
tn'i system It r, to continue until repealed or
modified bv furtrer legislation It is not, like the
act oí lb>38 limite'ti two yeais Itdoes not ex-
pire by i s own limita icn, bui. it íequiresthe action
of Congiess to íepeal it, if it should be ascertained
by exp< nence to be productive of mischief. "Why
should we abandon, in th s respect ihe path marked
out by our predect sors( Especiallj, why should
we maV'e sucn a bill as this, containing so many
novel p ovisions, and which is a new and untried
experiment m our land system, permanent as well
as prospective?
I have thus, Mr. Piefdent, referred briefly to
the provisions of the bill now under consideration.
It is a bill dealing a prospective pre emption sys-
tem, it encourages mtrus ons upon the public lands
in advanve, and ho'ds out inducements to persons
to becc me sett ers upon he public domain without
right and against law, u g vts the pre-emption
r ght to minors a? ve.l as adults, to aliens aj well as
ci iz n«, to the subjects of a foreign prince, owing

lised citizens u li-vitea all such, w> hout respect of
character "r country, to lecome proprietors of our

of a dvellin" to be eiectel, an improvement of a
small port on of th  laid, a residence of a few
hour" only, to ent tie fie settler to apriority of pm-
chase, and rt land other than the quarter section
en which he has s tded, and possibly of land to
wmch ihe Inuian title may not have been extin-
guí hed at the time of the settlement, it gives him
tbe impor ant privilege ot selecting portions of two
quarter sections under certain circumstances, and
of nore thai, one hundred and cixty acres in speci-
fied ca es, it co'ifers the right of pre-emption to
one mmired and sixty acre  on each one of any
