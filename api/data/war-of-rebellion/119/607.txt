General MEREDITH:

I received the following dispatch this morning:

WAR DEPARTMENT, Washington, November 30, 1863.

C. C. FULTON:

You are authorized to go to Richmond as a private citizens and look after provisions sent to our prisoners and to do what you can to alleviate their sufferings. The Government makes no objection to your doing so. You may proceed to Fort Monroe, and thence to City Point on flag-truce boat.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

Please communicate my proposition to Mr. Ould.

WASHINGTON, November 30, 1863.

Brigadier General S. A. MEREDITH,

E. A. HITCHCOCK,

Major-General.

WASHINGTON, November 30, 1863.

Brigadier General A. SCHOEPF,

Commanding Fort Delaware, Del:

GENERAL: The Secretary of War authorized the erection of a small-pox hospital of suitable extent on the New Jersey shore for the use of the prisoners of war at Fort Delaware. If sufficient ground for the purpose cannot be leased on reasonable terms, he directs that it be seized and occupied. The building should be fitted up with all the necessary conveniences, and should be sufficiently spacious to receive all patients having smallpox or other contagious diseases making it necessary to isolate them. The expense of he erection of the hospital will be paid out of the prison fund. Accurate accounts should be kept as if paid for by the quartermaster's department.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. HOFFMAN,

Colonel Third Infantry and Commissary-General of Prisoners.
