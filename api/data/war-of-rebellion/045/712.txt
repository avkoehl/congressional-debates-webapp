I excepted to be able to keep, if necessary, 15, 000 men at or near Hagerstown, but many are returning, having refused to cross the line. I will have 800 cavalry to assist McReynolds, and I hope a few thousand infantry that will do the fair thing. Three thousand of my infantry were at Hagerstown this morning.

ADJUTANT-GENERAL, U. S. ARMY:

General Scammon reports that he moved on the enemy at Raleigh Court-House, but was unable to cross the river in front with his main force. Two mounted regiments, sent to the rear, made demonstrations, and at midnight of the 14th instant the enemy evacuated his works, leaving a quantity of ammunition and some stores. The high water prevented his capture. General Scammon reports his other expedition as progressing satisfactorily.
