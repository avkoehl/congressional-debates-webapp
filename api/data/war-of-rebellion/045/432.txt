His Excellency ABRAHAM LINCOLN,

President of the United States:

I had 4, 000 able-bodied negroes at work on fortifications. Many of them seem to want to continue to work, or would fight for the Government. I sent paper ten days ago, urging and recommending a proposition to create from among them a regiment of sappers and miners. No notice was taken of the proposition. I believe one or two regiments for the war taken of the proposition. I believe one or two regiments for the war could be raised out of the good material, if you would authorize it, and have it done immediately, while the humor is on them.

ROBT. C. SCHENCK,

Major-General.
