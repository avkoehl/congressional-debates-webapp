Seventh Regiments Texas Mounted Volunteers (dismounted) crossing last. All were safely landed on the east bank of the Atchafalaya about 1 a. m. on the 29th. The rain commenced falling at dark on the evening of the 28th, and continued with only temporary cessation until the night of the 30th.

At daylight on the morning of the 29th, the troops were ready for the march. Colonel Henry Gray, commanding Mouton's brigade, was ordered to take up his line of march (Speight's brigade having been added to his command, together within 15 mounted men from Waller's battalion, under command of Lieutenant [R. N.] Weisiger) by a trail through the swamp, which intersected the Morganza State road some 4 miles from that place, and between the enemy's forces at Morganza and their advance at Mrs. Stirling's and the Fordoche Bridge. Colonel Gray was ordered to attack the enemy's advance at once on reaching the intersection of road, which he did by ordering Speight's brigade, under command of Lieutenant-Colonel [J. E.] Harrison, to the attack (see accompanying reports*). The balance of the troops, consisting of Waller's and Rountree's battalions of cavalry, Semmes' battery, the Fourth, Fifth, and Seventh Regiments Texas Mounted Volunteers (dismounted), took up their line of march by the main State road to Fordoche Bridge, which point was reached about 11 o'clock. An advance of cavalry was sent forward to the bridge, and were fired upon by the enemy's pickets at that place. Skirmishing continued here for half an hour, when the firing was heard from the rear at Mrs. Stirling's. With one section of the battery, under command of Lieutenant [J. A. A.] West, nd the Fourth and Fifth Regiments, I deployed through a plowed field, and opened with the artillery upon the quarters at Mr. Catlett's, where a portion of the enemy's cavalry were stationed, and at the same time ordered Major [H. H.] Boone, with the two sections of battery and the Seventh Regiment, to move rapidly down the road to the bridge, all of which was done, the dismounted men of the Fourth and Fifth moving at a double-quick across the plowed field to the quarters, but the enemy's advance of cavalry had fallen back to their headquarters, 1 mile farther on, at a Mr. Norwood's house. The sections of artillery united at the bridge, and the whole command proceeded with great rapidity toward the house. Majors Boone and Rountree made a dashing charge upon the enemy's cavalry, drawn up in line of battle near the house, and scattered them with such effect that they were not seen afterward, having retreated through a lane and turn rows to a road leading around the rear of plantations, which was unknown to me.

During these transactions, the firing from the rear had continued with slight interruption, and Major Boone was ordered to take his own command and Rountree's battalion and charge the enemy at Mrs. Stirling's, which he did most gallantly, charging the enemy's battery and receiving two severe wounds. This charge closed the fight, the enemy surrendering in detachments as they retreated and were overtaken by our troops.

The result of the victory consists of 433 non-commissioned officers and privates and 29 officers prisoners, two 10 pounder Parrott guns in fine order, with caissons complete, 2 new ambulances and 1 hospital wagon, new, filled with medical stores, and 2 stand of regimental colors belonging to the Nineteenth Iowa and Twenty-sixth Indiana Volunteers. Many small-arms and accouterments wee saved, and every man with an inferior weapon was supplied with a good and efficient one.
