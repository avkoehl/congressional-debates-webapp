TUSCUMBIA, ALA., November 16, 1864.

Lieutenant General R. TAYLOR,

Selma, Ala.:

Reports of General Wheeler indicate that Sherman is about to move with three corps from Atlanta to Augusta or Macon. In that event you will repair to point threatened with the available forces you can spare from your department and assume command of all troops in Georgia operating against Sherman. You will cut and block up all dirt roads in advance of him; remove or destroy supplies of all kinds in his front. Wheeler's cavalry will harass his flanks and rear. You will call on Governor's Brown and Bonham and General Hardee for assistance. I will join you should it become necessary. When you leave your department turn over the command to General Gardner.

G. T. BEAUREGARD,

General.
