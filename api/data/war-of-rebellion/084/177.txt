SAINT LOUIS, July 13, 1864.

General BROWN,

Warrensburg:

About what time ought Major Houts' command to join Ford?

O. D. GREENE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

WARRENSBURG, July 13, 1864.

Major O. D. GREENE

Assistant Adjutant-General, Saint Louis:

My express to Major Houts missed him, and Houts has just returned with his command to this post. Colonel Ford left Kansas City to join his forces with Generals Curtis' and Fisk's at 5 o'clock this morning. I have no troops in the western border to re-enforce Ford.

E. B. BROWN,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers.

SAINT LOUIS, July 13, 1864

General BROWN,

Warrensburg:

Instruct Colonel Ford that General Curtis, at Fort Leavenworth, has been instructed to seize the first boat at that point suitable for the duty and send to him (Ford) at Kansas City. The Fanny Ogden is the boat designated for this purpose.

O. D. GREENE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

WARRENSBURG, July 13, 1864.

Major O. D. GREENE,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

I have the honor to report that I have ordered no boats to leave Jefferson City up the river, or Kansas City down, until further orders.

E. B. BROWN,

Brigadier-General.

KANSAS CITY, July 13, 1864.

Brigadier General E. B. BROWN,

Warrensburg:

Nothing has been heard from Major Houts and his command. He has not passed Independence or Pleasant Hill. No news from Colonel Ford. Detachment of the Seventh [Missouri State Militia Cavalry] under Captain Peak and section of artillery arrived here at 11 p.m. yesterday. Horses are rested and men ready for any emergency. I think we ought to have a steam-boat here so that I could throw troops to any point down the river. I fear the rebels will pass toward Liberty and try to effect a crossing into La Fayette. If you will ask Major-General Curtis, some boat might easily be sent here.

HENRY SUESS,

Major, Commanding Post.
