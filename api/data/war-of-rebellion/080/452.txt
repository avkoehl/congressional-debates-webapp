HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,July 30, 1864-9.15 a.m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

Just before receiving your dispatch to assault the battery on the left on the crater occupied by General Burnside, the enemy drove his troops out of the place and I think now hold it. I can find no one who knows for certainty or seems willing to admit it, but I thing I saw a rebel battle-flag in it just now, and shots coming from it this way. I am, therefore, if this is true, no more able to take the battery than I was this time yesterday. All our advantages are lost. I await further instructions and am trying to get at the condition of affairs for certainty.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General of Volunteers.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,July 30, 1864-9.40 a.m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

GENERAL: I find that the flag I saw was the enemy's, and that they have reoccupied all the line we drove them from except a little around the crater, which a small force of ours still holds.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General of Volunteers.
