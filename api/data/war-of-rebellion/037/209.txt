HEADQUARTERS THIRTEENTH ARMY CORPS,June 24, 1863.

Colonel Bush, SECOND Illinois Cavalry, reports. "Our pickets report that the rebels were at work at Baldwin's Ferry last night. "I shall ascertain whether it is true or not. If they are preparing to cross, I will send notice.

ORD'S, July 1, 1863.

GENERAL: I have positive intelligence, from cavalry just in and from the report of Major Wilson, that the enemy have crossed at and near Hankinson's Ferry. I have ordered Lawler, with a brigade, to move down east of Warrenton, and occupy the ground between Warrenton and Hankinson's Ferry. He will be off in half an hour, if you do not direct otherwise.

E. O. C. ORD,

Major-General.

ORD'S, July 1, 1863.

Nothing further than the dispatch from Herron, which came from Logan and Major Wilson, via Warrenton. Wilson was stationed near Hankinson's Ferry. I think it is likely the enemy has shown some force there perhaps as a feint. I have two brigades ordered to be ready to march for the country between Warrenton and Hall's Ferry. Shall I send them off?

E. O. C. ORD.

General GRANT.

[Indorsement.]

A cavalry picket, to give notice if crossing is attempted, will be sufficient. Only move troops after it is known there in a force to oppose.

Number 13. Reports of Brigadier General Peter. J. Osterhaus, u. S. Army, commanding NINTH DIVISION. HEADQUARTERS NINTH DIVISION, Big Black River Railroad Bridge, May 25, 1863.

COLONEL: I arrived with the First Brigade (two sections of the SECOND Light Artillery) at this place yesterday morning, and relieved Colonel Slack, as per instructions. Of Colonel Wright's command I only found two companies, numbering to 50 men in the aggregate. Whether the colonel himself and the balance of his command will report here or not, I am unable to state; but from the fact that he sent yesterday night for the above 50 men only three day's rations, I am inclined to infer that the colonel will not join me soon, nor the balance of his command either.
