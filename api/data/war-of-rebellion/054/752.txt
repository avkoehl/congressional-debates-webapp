consin have been ordered to Chattanooga. They can be used as garrison artillery, if required. I fear General Thomas' plan of raising a veteran regiment of artillery is impracticable, as the men would be drawn from different States, and, therefore, in violation of law and General Orders. An infantry regiment or several batteries from the same State can be organized as a regiment of heavy artillery. Had not any additional troops we can obtain better be sent to Corinth and Eastport, to secure General Sherman's rear?

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

I have ordered McPherson to send one division of troops to Sherman. This will leave him a present effective force of at least 13,000 white troops. These will go by way of Corinth. I think it advisable to send all troops intended to join Sherman from the north up Tennessee River to Eastport.
