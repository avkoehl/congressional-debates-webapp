centrating a large force on his left, and contemplates a move in this direction very soon. This morning at sunrise I sent a man to see the road leading from Old Church to the White House; everything was quiet; only scouting parties pass that road. I shall start 2 couriers, as there are so many scouting parties out this morning. You will please excuse me for not signing my true name.

Yours, respectfully,

S. FRANKLIN [STRINGFELLOW].

I have a man on the Old Church and White House road.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA,May 30, 1864 - 11 a. m.

Major General R. H. ANDERSON:

GENERAL: As far as I can judge from the information I have received, I think the enemy will take a line for their right up Crump's Creek to Taliaferro's Mill, and thence along up to Smith's Store, and thence to the Totopotomoy Creek, embracing McKenzie's Corner, then down the north side of the Totopotomoy and cross over to the head waters of the Matadequin, near Bethesda Church. After fortifying this line they will probably make another move by their left flank over toward the Chickahominy. This is just a repetition of their former movements. It can only be arrested by striking at once at that part of their force which has crossed the Totopotomoy in General Early's front. I have desired him to do this if he thought it could be done advantageously, and have written to him that you will support him. Please communicate with him at once.

Whatever is determined on should be done as soon as practicable.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. E. LEE,

General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA,May 30, 1864.

Major General R. H. ANDERSON, Commanding:

GENERAL: I have heard through Lieutenant-Colonel Sorrel that Kershaw's old brigade is much in need of a good brigade commander, and I am anxious that a brigade that has always done so well should now be well commanded. I desire you to consult General Kershaw at once, so that a good commander may be recommended for the brigade as soon as practicable.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. E. LEE,

General.

MAY 30, 1864 - 2 p. m.

[General R. H. ANDERSON:]

GENERAL: I inclose you a note* from General Early. I approve what is therein suggested, and have authorized General Early to carry out what is proposed, if his judgment approves. I desire you, if circumstances permit, to carry out your part.

R. E. LEE,

General.
