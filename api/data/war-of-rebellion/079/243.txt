Colonel Raum with 350 men to try to communicate; loaded up all the abandoned commissaries and brought three trains down here that are now ready to carry troops if you desire. I also placed garrisons I the abandoned block-houses on the road. Watkins left his horses on this side and crossed his men. Could not get the Rome operator, suppose he is asleep, and have to send this through by courier. Will send anything else that comes. I have made arrangements for couriers to come through.

Resaca:

Major-General.
