emptions. These questions were now pending be-
fore the committee undecided, and he was unwilling
to prejudice the decision of these questions by any
action on this bill He hoped, when the question
came to be fully considered, should the State not
be entitled to these lauds under Ce caaal law, (the
law granting lands to the canal, to winch he had
adverted,) that the benefit of these lands will be
suffered, on moderate terms, under a pre-emption,
to go to the State to aid her in her works of mtei nal
improvement. The General Government, it is
very true, will not realize more than the minimum
price of $1 25 per acre for these lands should she
sell them in the ordinary way, while the State
might realize double or treble that sum, upon terms
to aid her in the paymeBt of her canal debt Thus,
while the General Government would lose nothing,
the State of Indiana would receive from $500,000
to §1,000,000, a clear benefit from the pre-emption,
to a*oist her in paying her internal improvement
debt, the benefit of which would mure alike to all
the citizens of the State, those who alaim these pre-
emptions as well as others
He (Mr. S.) would next inquire whether, under
the circumstances of this case, the persons who are
upon these lands have any special claim to the
favor of the Government, or rather whether they
have even the claims of ordinal y pre-emptors He
had already said that these lands lie in the heart of
the State, on the line of one of her puncipal public
works, that they are of the most valuable lands
in the State, that they aie not frontier lands, but
aie surrounded by a dense population and a highly
impioved country, that they were Indian reserva-
tions of lands, reserved in the original sales by the
Miamies, that the treaty was ratified by the Senate
in September last, and was only approved in Octo-
ber It íemained for him tosíate, further, that,
after the treaty was approved, he had leceived a
letter from a gentleman at Peru, nearly adjoining
some of these land', inquiring whether it was pro-
ble that pre-emptions would be granted to settlers
on them, that he had answered the letter, informing
the writer that he (Mr S ) was clearly of opinion
that the people ought not to locate on these lands
with the expectation ol obtaining pre emptions.
He felt fully justified, at the time, in giving his
opinion as he did But, if he had misled any by
that opinion, so as to induce them to loiego ad\an-
tages of location, which the Government shall
sanction by this bill, he regretted it, as all ought to
have had an equal chance to avail themselves of
the benefits oí 'he location. He thought then, and
h  still thin is, his opinion was founded m conect
policy. IIa had, however, understood that almost
the •whole of the best of these land  had been lo-
cated <is s urn as the settlers could remove from
their homes in lliPtr vicinity, and select the choice
tracts This bill will secuie them in these lo-
cations by pre emptions Does the claim come
sustained by the reasons that may be urged mfavor
of our pre emplion system'' The aiguments in
favor of that system were—that the pre-emptors
were pioneers, that they improved the public lands
in advance of the settlements, that they guarded the
frontiers, and risked their lives to deiend the settle-
ments against savage aggressions, that they caused
the surrounding public lands to become valua-
ble None of these reasons operate m favor of
the settlers whom he wished to exclude from the
operation ol the bill They are not pioneeis, they
are not frontier settlers, risking their lives m the
defence of the settlements, they are not adding to
the value of the surrounding public lands, for there
are but few lands there unsold They did not take
possession of those lands innocently and ígnornn'Iy,
believing m the implied faith of the Government
that they should have a pre-emption to them, but,
on the contrary, they weie advised, as he lully be-
1 eyed, that a pre-emption need not be expected
They must have known that the Stale claimed ad-
ditional lands, to construct the extension of the
Wabash and Ene Canal, and that these lands
would be a most desirable selection Under all
these circumstances, he had in vain looked for even
a plausible pretext for tins claim on the part of
these setfleis Hi0 colleague thought otherwise
the generosity of his nature, and the warm feel-
ings of his heart for his neighbors, seem to h&ye
satisfied his judgment that thsy ought to be includ-
ed, that the rights and interests of the State and the Go-
vernment ought tobe held subordinate to the claims
oí these settlers. He (Mr. S.) could not bring his
mind to that conclusion He was opposed to con-
cluding the interests of the State until she could
be heard m this matter The claims of the set-
tlers in the mean time will be only postponed, to
be decided whenever the whole matter can be fair-
ly examined, and should the State not be able to
substantiate her claim, and should Congress not
feel disposed to grant her the pre-emption right to
these lands, the claim of the cultivators will not be
at all weakened by the length ol time they have
occupied, or the extent of their improvements, and
a subsequent pre-emption Jaw will give them all
the benefits they anticipate from this bill. He
(Mr. S) had made up his mind to vote for the
bill, notwithstanding at this day he doubted the po-
licy of these pre-emptiuu laws to selected spots of
the public lands, he had ielt himself, however,
bound by what he believed to be the understand-
ing of these frontier settlers in the implied faith of
the Government, growing out oi previous laws On
the subject, and he should vole for this bill under
that view of the subject, if the amendment was
adopted, othera ise, howexet reluctantly he might
teel compelled to vote against the bill, his duty to
his State and her in terests. would induce him to do so
REMARKS OF MR. GLASCOCK,
Oi Gkou&iA.
In the House of Representatives, January 24, 1838—
On the bill making a partial appropriation Í01
the suppres 1011 ot Indian hostilities Í01 the yeas
1838
Mr GLA.SCOCK rose and said-
Mr Chairman Thegieatlatitudewhichthisdebate
has taken, the wide range of discussion m which
gentlemen have indulged, piompt me not only in
justice to myself, but to that section oí country
which I in part represent, to address the commit-
tee, and ask to be heaid in reply No one can
legret more than myself that so many questions
wholly unconnected with the one at issue, should
have been presented to us, but as they are so pre-
sente I, loi one, I am not disposed to evade them,
and shall pioceed to meet and to discuss them with
that calmness and deliberation which then im-
portant requues
This debate opened, as usual, with strong ob-
jections to the appropriations sought to be obtain-
ed by the bill, by the gentleman from "Virginia,
(Mr Wist,) who, in unqualified and unmeasured
terms, has made charges most serious in their
character against the Government, as to its policy
towards the Indians generally The object of these
charges, is to fix upon the Government the odium
of all the disasters and fatal consequences grow-
ing out of the Florida war, even to the extent of
charging upon it cruelty, inhumanity, perfidy,
and oppiesiion, with a violation of our treaties
themselves
Sir, need I tell the gentleman that these are
charges which can never be established, but, on
the contrary, a reference to the treaties, and to the
course and policy pursued by the Government un-
der them, furnish abundant evidence wholly to dis-
prove such charges If ihe gentleman had ex-
amined die treaties with the Florida Indians, and
given the subject that attention which he generally
gives to others, I am satisfied he would himself
have come to the conclusion that many of his re-
marks were uncalled for, and unwarianted by the
facts connected with, and growing out of, these
treaties
It is far from my w.sh, on the present occasion,
to dwell at large upon these treaties, but, sir, a
brief reference to them is made important, and
rendered necessary, m justice to the Government
and to the gentlemen who made them, if not to the
whole rountty, from the general allegation that
they weie obtained through fraud and injustice.
The fii,t tieaty to winch I beg leave to call
the attention oi the committee, is the treaty made
at Camp Moultrie m the year 1823 By this
treaty it will be seen that these I^djajis had the
right to purchase and obtain 5,000,000 acres of
land in the peninsula of Florida, and under it their
boundaries were fixed and eslabbshed. Let it also
be borne in mind that this treaty was entered into
with them even after they had been defeated, con-
quered and subdued by General Jackson, in his
Seminole campaign of 1818—a campaign remark-
able for the events which occmred, and which
forms an important era in the history of this Go-
vernment.
Some years after this, these Indians, from their
indolence and other causes, were reduced to almost
starvation. Appropriations weie promptly made
, for their support and maintenance. Yes, sir, and
from what I have heard and seen, I truly fear, with
more willingness and unanimity than appropria-
tions' will be made to reimburse ourown citizens for
losses sustained by the conflagiation of their dwel-
ling , and the destruction of their property by these
veiy Indians, for whom so much sympathy has
been enlisted, and who are said to be so cruelly op-
pressed and persecuted by our people Under this
treaty, and after these appropuations, they re-
mained for a while tranquil and composed, but
as the white population of the Territory rapidly
increased, many of their chiefs and warriors be
came discontented, and of their own free will
evinced and made known their disposition to treat
for a country west of the Mississippi, which ulti-
mately led to the tieaty at Payne's Landing m
May, 1832. Under one of the provisions of that
treaty, a condition precedent is inserted, by which
some of their confidential chiefs, accompanied by
their own agent, Major Pagan, and their interpre-
ter, Abraham, were to be permitted to visit the coun-
try allotted them, at the expense of the United
States, <uid if they should be pleased with it, and
could make satisfacloiy arrangements with the
Creek , the treaty was then to be ratified and car-
ried into eflecl Here the committee will at once
see, and it must carry conviction home to the minds
of all, tint it was not consummated and completed
for the action of the Senate until this condition pre-
cedent should have been performed So soon,
however, as these confidential chiefs visited the
country, «Inch they did early in 1833, and reported
most favorably, the treaty of Fort Gibson was en-
tered into on the 28th Maich, 1833, fully confirm-
atory o£ the tieaty at Payne's Landing, and which
was solemnly ratified by the Senate on the 12th day
of April, 1834, and, if I am informed correctly,
with little or no opposition.
The cause of the delay, therefore, between the
date of the treaties and their ratification, can but
prove satisfactory, and thus takes from the gentle-
men the ground assumed by them, that the delay in
the ratification vitiated and rendered them void.
Independent, however, of these treaties, thus rati-
fied and becoming the paramount law ol the land,
as late as April, 1835, by an agreement entered
into by the commanding general (Clinch) with six-
teen of their chiefs and sub-chiefs, the treaties were
fully recognised and acknowledged in all their pro-
visions and stipulations, and the time foi4 the re-
moval of the Indians extended
This, sir, is but a short though faithful sketch of
the principal provis ons of ihe tieaties, and is pre-
sented to the committee with the view of enablin 
them to form 1 proper estimate how far they have
been obtained thiough fraud and treachery, and
how far they have been, as is alleged, shamefully
violated by any act of the Government. Sir, if
the members ol this committee w ould but take the
trouble to examine for themselves the several trea-
ties with these Indians, and the whole history of
the proceedings connected with them, I hazard no-
thing in saying, that I believe the most violent par-
tisan would come to the irresistible conclusion, that
no tribe or nation of Indians has ever been treated
w ith more liberahtj, lemtv, or humanity, than these
located within the Territory of Florida, notwith-
standing they have caused so much effusion of
blood, and the exhaustion of so much of oui trea-
sure Still, with all these facts befoie us, with a
perfect knowledge that the Indians themselves com-
menced the war upon us, by the attack and massa-
cie of the gallant Dade and his whole command
with the simultaneous attack, and the basé
and cowardly murder of General Thompson, a
