HEADQUARTERS EIGHTEENTH CORPS,June 16, 1864-4 p.m.

Major-General MEADE:

I did not understand from the wording of your note* that it needed an answer. I have in the neighborhood of 8,000 men for an attack, in good fighting trim and good spirits, and will be ready to make an attack in my front at any hour which may be indicated by your order. The works in my immediate front I carried last night, but abandoned them because I deemed them untenable and of no great importance with reference to an attack on Petersburg. I think I can retake them at any time when it should be judged they are of importance.

Very respectfully,

WM. F. SMITH,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS EIGHTEENTH CORPS,June 16, 1864.

General BROOKS:

You will please mass immediately on the hill, at the house where the artillery was firing morning, the four batteries of this command, in battery, to best cover an advance on Petersburg.

Respectfully, &amp;c.,

N. BOWEN,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS EIGHTEENTH CORPS,June 16, 1864.

General MARTINDALE:

Commanding Second Division:

GENERAL: General Smith directs that you push a reconnaissance as far toward Petersburg as possible, to ascertain the practicability and nature of ground, &c., of an advance this evening. You will make all necessary dispositions for this advance. Report as soon as practicable.

Respectfully, &c.,

N. BOWEN,

Assistant Adjutant-General, &c.
HEADQUARTERS EIGHTEENTH CORPS,June 16, 1864.

General MARTINDALE,

Commanding Second Division:

GENERAL: General Smith desires me to say that you have mistaken his orders for this afternoon's operations. You were merely to make a demonstration of pretense to attack. You will, as soon as practicable, assume a line as nearly as possible on the bluffs, your right on the river and left connecting with General Hinks. Your pickets will connect.

Respectfully, &c.,

N. BOWEN,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
