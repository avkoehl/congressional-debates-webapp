AUGUSTA, September 3, 1864.

General BRAGG:

I have sent 1,000 volunteers and detailed men this day to General Hardee, and will send some 300 more to-night. This stops all the Government works here.

A. R. WRIGHT,

Brigadier-General.

LOVEJOY'S STATION, GA., September 4, 1864--1 p. m.

General BRAXTON BRAGG, Richmond, Va.:

Should the enemy move to the east or west I shall endeavor to strike him with my entire force on his flank and rear. I think his move will be down and west of Flint River.

J. B. HOOD.

LOVEJOY'S STATION, GA., September 4, 1864.

General B. BRAGG, Richmond, Va.:

Owing to the wanton neglect of the chief quartermaster of this army a large amount of ammunition and railroad stock had to be destroyed at Atlanta. He had more then ample time to remove the whole and had repeated instructions. I am reliably informed that he is too much addicted to drink of late to attend to his duties. Am greatly in want of an officer to take his place. Can you not send one?

J. B. HOOD.

LOVEJOY'S STATION, September 4, 1864.

General BRAXTON BRAGG:

I think the officers and men of this army feel that every effort was made to hold Atlanta to the last. I do not think the army is discouraged.

J. B. HOOD,

General.

LOVEJOY'S STATION, GA., September 4, 1864--11.30 a. m.

His Excellency President DAVIS, Richmond, Va.:

Unless this army is speedily and heavily re-enforced Georgia and Alabama will be overrun. I seen no other means to avert this calamity. Never in my opinion was our liberty in such danger. What can you do for us?

W. J. HARDEE,

Lieutenant-General.

SEPTEMBER 4, 1864.

Lieutenant-General LEE, Commanding Corps:

General Hood desires you to relieve Colonel Presstman's regiment engineer troops on the right. Please direct Colonel P. when relieved to report with his command to these headquarters. If you can spare him, please let Captain Coleman report to General Hood.

[F. A. SHOUP,

Chief of Staff.]
