HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,August 18, 1864-12.30 p. m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

I send the last report ++ just received from General Warren. Since its receipt quite sharp cannonading is heard in his direction, but no report of progress.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.

CITY POINT, VA., August 18, 1864.

Major-General MEADE,

Commanding, &amp;c.:

If Warren can do no better I would have him close up on Petersburg, with his left west of the Weldon road, and intrench and stay there. So long as the enemy is occupied north of the James he can spare no force to drive Warren away. When we withdraw from there Hancock can go to his support, and the Tenth Corps will relieve the Eighteenth from the trenches, giving us another corps foot loose. I do not mean this in any way to prevent Warren from taking advantage of any weakness of the enemy according to his judgment.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
