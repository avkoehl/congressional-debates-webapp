and endeavor to bring them to terms before another spring; and in instructions to all my officers I have directed that in fighting these Indians they must do it honorably, allow no atrocities, and practice no severities not sanctioned by the usage of war.

The column sent up the Republican was under Lieutenant-Colonel Kirwan, Twelfth Tennessee Cavalry and was about 350 strong. It kept that country clear of Indians during the entire summer, and protected the Government surveyors who were employed in completing the work they were driven from the year previous. The force sent up the Smoky Hill route under Major Pritchard was about 250 strong. While scouting that country it at the same time opened that route to Denver, which is now traveled with a daily stage, and is about 100 miles nearer to Denver from all points south of Saint Joseph than the Platte route. In July last I sent the companies of the Fifth U. S. Volunteers, with two howitzers, under Captain G. W. Williford, as escort for Colonel Sawyer's party, opening the route from Sioux City along the Niobrara, via Fort Connor and Big Horn Mountains, to Virginia City, Mont. Ter. They report that they suffered considerably; encountered many difficulties; were attacked three times by a large force of Cheyennes near Powder River, but succeeded in driving them off, and took through safely a large train of some 80 wagons, emigrants, &amp;c. Attention is respectfully called to the report of Captain G. W. Williford, forwarded herewith. * The wagon road expedition was a failure as far as making a road was concerned. It had a heavy train belonging to private parties, and while its ostensible object was to survey and make a road through a country comparatively unknown, its real purpose seems to have been to take the train through, and to that end its efforts were devoted, instead of making a road, building bridges, &c. Captain Williford went simply as an escort to the party, and had no control whatever over it, and exercised none until he was obliged to do so in order to save his command, in which, by his superior ability and skillful management, he succeeded. General Connor sent word to Colonel Sawyer, in charge of the wagon party, not to attempt to penetrate the country he was making for, as it was impracticable. No attention was paid, however; r's advice, or to that of all experienced guides who were consulted. The party pushed on, got into the Bad Lands on Powder River, and was there extricated and taken to Fort Connor by Captain Williford. Colonel Sawyer's guides were inexperienced and unacquainted with most of the country he had to pass over. A fine road can, however, be found from Sioux City to Montana, via Fort Laramie, as will hereafter appear in this report.

In July last a portion of the Third California Veteran Infantry, under Lieutenant-Colonel John, left Salt Lake to accompany the Overland Stage Company in opening the new route from Salt Lake, via the Uintah Valley, White River, Middle Park, and Berhoud (or Boulder) Pass, to Central City and Denver. This force reports the route practicable. They met no Indians except the Utes, who were friendly, and found no obstacles that could not be easily overcome, except the Berthoud (or Boulder) Pass, which will require considerable work before it can be used as a stage or emigrant route. This route, it is said, would save 200 miles in distance over any other route between Denver and Salt Lake. With reference to the overland routes I shall speak fully, and, I trust, clearly. The country over which they pass is, however, so marked and peculiar that they are all in many particulars much alike. After passing a belt
