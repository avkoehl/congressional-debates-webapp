THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

head on its population. The illustration that
these States furnish may be applied to nearly
all of the other western and eastern States with
the same result. This we claim to be unjust,
grossly unjust; and the only way to correct the
wrong is to withdraw, from States in excess
and give to those not having their pro rata.
The usual answer that is made to this argument
is that it is not the; population hut the business
that should command the capital.
I know of no better way of ascertaining the
business that is done in those States than by
the amount of taxes each of them pay to the
Federal Government. I have with some care
and trouble prepared atable showing the amount
of national currency issued to fifteen western
and southern States, and the taxes paid by them
respectively for the support of the Government
for the fiscal year ending the 80th of JUne,
I860, as follows:

This table shows that the people of those
fifteen States paid in one year nearly two mil-
lion dollars more in taxes than their entire
amount, of national bank note circulation. I
have also prepared a table showing the amount
of currency issued to six eastern States, and
the taxes paid by them respectively to tho sup-
port of the Government for the fiscal year end-
ing the 80th of J une, I860, which is as follows:

ft will be soon from these tables that the
entire bank note circulation in the fifteen States
I have enumerated is only $80,077,629, while
the business of the same States require the
payment of more than thirty-eight million dol-
lars taxes to the Government each year.
The six States of Maine, New Hampshire,
Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and
Connecticut have a national bank note circu-
lation of §104,509,919—a little more than one
third of tho authorized issue—while they pay
to the Government in the shape of taxes but
$14,486,130 97.

Total 13,548,784
have a bank circulation of but $86,077,629;
while six other States of the Union, with a
population as follows :
Massachusetts  1,231,066
Connecticut    460,147
Rhode Island  174,620
Maine  628,279
Vermont    315,098
.New Hampshire  326,073
Total  3,135,283
have $1014,509,919 of bank circulation, or
nearly three times as great as thfe fifteen States
I have named, and with but one fourth the
population.
The fifteen States rpaid into the Federal
Treasury last year the sum of $38,029,284 70;
while tie six States, with their hundred mil-
lions of currency, paid but$14,485,130 97 into
the public Treasury, making a difference of'
$23,544,153 73.
The western and southern States pay each
year more to the Government than their entire
authorized circulation, while the eastern States
I have named do not pay one seventh part of
theirs.
The report of the Secretary of the Treasury
shows that for the fiscal year ending the 30th
day of June, 1869, there was paid to the na-
tional banks $21,674,855 07 in gold for the
interest due on the bonds deposited by them
with the Treasurer to secure their circulation.
Of this vast amount of interest the States of
Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachu-
setts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut received
a little more than one third, (they having
more than one third of the circulation,) which
amounted to more than seven million dollars,
or about one half of the taxes paid to the Gov-
ernment for that year by those States. In
other words, tho six States I have named paid
to the Government $14,000,000 in currency,
and the Government paid to them $7,000,000
in gold. Gold being worth on an average fifteen
per cent, premium, would make the amount
paid by tho Government to those States in
interest equal to about eight million dollars in
currency. This would leavo the net amount
of taxes paid to the Government by those six
States about six million dollars. Tho fifteen
western and southern States I have named
have an entire circulation of but a little over
thirty-six million dollars, or say one eighth of
the entire amount authorized to be issued.
This would entitle them to the one eighth part
of tho interest paid to national banks, which
would be not quite three million dollars ; and
this, with the premium thereon deducted from
the amount of taxes paid to tho Government,
would leave about thirty-tivo million dollars
that these States have paid in the shape of
taxes, or about twenty-eight million dollars
more than the six eastern States have paid.
My own State has an authorized circulation
of a little more than four million dollars, or
about the one seventieth part of the entire cir-
culation, which would give her about three
hundred thousand dollars in interest, while
sho pays a tax of $5,287,100 34 ; and Rhode
Island, with about one twenty-fifth of the entire
circulation, collects from the Federal Govern-
ment in the shape of interest upon her bonds
deposited with the Treasurer the sum of about
eight hundred thousand dollars in gold, or
$900,000 in currency, while she paid tax to tho
Government for the last year to the amount
of $1,280,295 84 in currency, or about four
hundred thousand dollars over and above the
interest that was paid to her national banks by
the United States; while my own State, with
a circulation of but $4,000,000 national cur-
rency, paid to the Government $5,000,000
taxes.
Vermont has a circulation of $5,751,720,
while her banks received for the last year in-
terest from the Government in gold to the
amount of $850,000 upon their bonds depos-
ited with the Treasurer, while the State paid
to the Government but $314,578 27, or a clear
gain of more than thirty thousand dollars, in
interest alone, upon her Government bonds
belonging to national banks over and above tho
amount of taxes she pays to the support of the
Government. Our people are heavily taxed
to pay this interest upon the bonds; they feel
the leaden weight that hangs about them, but
are unable to extricate themselves from the
meshes that bind them. Tf in the press of our
business and obligations we have to borrow
money we must, do so from the States having
it, and we are again taxed to our utmost far-
thing to pay the interest to your eastern money-
lenders.
Not satisfied with this state of affairs and
this conBtant drain upon the industry, the
energy, and the muscle of the overburdened
people of the West and South, this bill seeks
to increase their burdens by increasing the
amount of bonded debt. It seeks to increase
the power and the wealth of the banks that are
now organized, under the guise of giving more
currency to the West and South. If it should
become a law (and men could be be found who
are fools enough to try to organize banks under
it) it would open up a new field for jobbers and
speculators. It would increase the value of
the three per cent, certificates now mostly held
by banks as a part of their " lawful money
reserve," and would decrease the volume of
circulating currency by putting '' greenbacks''
at a premium, and thereby driving them from
circulation, and would soon bring our people
face to face with financial distress. It makes
a most unjust discrimination against the banks
proposed to be organized, by imposing bur-
dens upon them that, were not nor are now
proposed to be imposed upon the old banks.
The machinery—modus operandi—of this bill
may bo stated in a very few words. A and B
desire to go into the business of banking under
the provisions of this bill. They apply to the
Secretary of the Treasury, who informs them
that by the third section of the bill he is
authorized to issue them the bonds of the Gov-
ernment, "payable in coin in twenty-five years
from date, and bearing interest not exceeding
four and a half per cent, per annum, payable
semi-annually in coin," upon the payment by
them to him of the par value of said bonds in
gold or its equivalent, or by the surrender by
them of au equal amount of six per cent, gold-
bearing bonds.
This is acceded to ; $100,000 in bonds, say
bearing four and a half per cent, interest, are
issued and delivered to them and they pay
into the Treasury the sum of $100,000 in coin.
From that hour forward tho Government pays
interest upon that $100,000 at the rate of four
and a half per cent, per annum in gold. A and
B, then and there, to secure the circula,tioii
desired, deposit these same bonds with the
Treasurer to obtain $90,000 of national bank
currency authorized to be issued.
By the same section of the bill the Secretary
of the Treasury is required to take the $100,000
in gold paid for the lour and a half per cent,
bonds by A and B, and use the same as follows:
First. For tho purchase or redemption of three
per cent, temporary loan certificates.
,Second. l!'or the purchase or redemption of such
amount of United States notes as the Secretary of
the Treasury may be required to cancel under the
provisions of this act; and
Third, for tho purchase or redemption of such
obligations bearing six per cent, interest in coin as
by tho terras of issue are or may becomc reueemablo
or payable.
Suppose that the entire amount of $95,000,-
000 authorized by this act be taken, it would be
but eighty per cent, of the amount paid into
the Treasury to obtain it, and for which the
Secretary of the Treasury issues tho bonds of
the Government bearing four and a half per
cent, interest, payable in coin; or, in other
words, to obtain the $95,000,000 in currency
it is necessary for the Government to issue its
bonds to the amount of $118,750,000, for which
it receives that amount in gold.
With this amount in gold the Secretary of the
Treasury is required to redeem, first, the three
per cent, certificates, now held as a reserve by
the banks, and then as many "notes of the
Government," "greenbacks," as be cun with
the remainder.
The three per cent, certificates, amounting to
$45,535,000, are mostly held, as 1 said before,
by the banks, as so much of their reserve, which,
when redeemed, would have to be supplied from
the " greenback" currency, which would take
from circulation that amount as a matter of
