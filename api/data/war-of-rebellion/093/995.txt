the cavalry are moving around my right to the railroad. The enemy's cavalry is not with this column of infantry. A lieutenant of the enemy, killed this morning in a skirmish, had the inclosed application on him, showing he is in Hood's advance guard. So satisfied am I that the enemy's cavalry is moving on the railroad I shall move my entire command toward Campbellsville or Lynnville to-morrow morning, which will bring a portion of my column within ten miles of Pulaski, on the Lawrenceburg and Pulaski road.

EDWARD HATCH,

Brigadier-General.

I have also received the annexted dispatches from Major-General Schofield:

PULASKI, November 23, 1864-8 a.m.

Major-General THOMAS:

I have Hatch's report of 8.30 [8.15] p.m. I will go to Lynnville this morning, and from there according to information. General Stanley will move his main force this p.m. as far as Lynnville, leaving a rear guard here. The trains are so slow I fear some property cannot be removed, but will try to get it all off.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.

LYNNVILLE, November 23, 1864-4 p.m.*

Major-General THOMAS:

I have not heard from Hatch to-day, and have heard nothing of the enemy. General Wilson is here, and will start for Campbellville, to join Hatch, in a few moments. Stanley will be here to-night, and Cox ten miles above.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.

Your dispatch of 4 p.m. this day is received. I had already taken the responsibility to direct General Granger to withdraw his command from Decatur, Huntsville, and Athens, and my dispatch to him has already been acknowledged. Trains are already at those places, prepared to move the troops, a portion of which will go to Stevenson, the balance to Murfreesborough, to strengthen the garrisons at those points. There are no troops in Kentucky that can be called upon or ordered to this place. I am patiently awaiting the arrival of General Smith's command, which was to have embarked at Saint Louis yesterday, but I have had no intelligence from them since the 20th.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding.

NASHVILLE, TENN., November 23, 1864-10 p.m.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Washington, D. C.:

It has occurred to me since my last dispatch was sent you that [it] might be advisable to call on the Governor of Indiana for some of the militia of that State, and I would like to know whether I am authorized to make the application. There are no available troops in Kentucky.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding.
