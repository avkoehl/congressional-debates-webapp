A portion of the arms at the arsenal had already been removed at the date of the report rendered. Of cartridges for small-arms, there are on hand at all the arsenals, number 3,200,000. Of musket and rifle power, there are now on hand, pounds, 168,000. (This amount of power will make 1,500,000 cartridges.) Of cannon-power, the supply is nearly all the forts, with a small quantity in reserve. Of fixed ammunition for field batteries, there is enough at Baton Rouge alone to supply ten batteries of six guns each. Of percussion-caps, there are here (750,000 belonging to this State) over 2,000,000, and there are a good many at the arsenals and bundled with the cartridges. It is understood that the State of Georgia has 150 tons of saltpeter, with proportionate quantity of sulphur, this will make quite 200 tons of power.

President of the Congress:

As soon, however, as it became evident that this resource could no longer be relied on, the attention of the Department was turned toward obtaining supplies of saltpeter, the only mineral constituent of powder which could be obtained from the soil of this country. Information having reached me that deposit of nitrous earth existed in
