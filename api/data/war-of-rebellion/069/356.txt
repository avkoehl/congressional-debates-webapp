HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS,May 30, 1864 - 6.30 a. m.

General WILLIAMS:

Your dispatch received, and your instructions will be observed. Our column is in motion, and will get in position soon as possible, after which I will inform you of the position of my headquarters; in the mean time I will be near headquarters of General Hancock, some 3 miles in advance of his headquarters last night. I shall not bring my camp to line until it is established, and any messages sent for me up to that time will be forwarded to the front to me by orderly. Please say to the general commanding that I fear I will be somewhat delayed by General Gibbon's ambulance and artillery trains, but will not be long, and is unavoidable, unless we can find a road across, which we are trying to do.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND CORPS,May 30, 1864 - 10.10 a. m.

General HUMPHREYS:

I have just come to General Hancock's headquarters to learn correctly the position of General Gibbon, on whose left we are to join. My column is advancing but slowly, in consequence of the necessity for cutting the roads through the woods, but I hope to join with Gibbon very soon, if we have not already done so. I will inform you very soon where our headquarters are to be.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

Major Lydig has just returned with your dispatch, and states that the general commanding thinks we have made a great mistake this morning when we went out to establish the line. General Warren's right rested on a certain ravine. We put our left there, and General Warren's right left it. As soon as I learned this I sent in another division, and before that was in position Warren's right had swung off at least a mile and was represented as being hard pressed, and I also learn now that his right division is moving off by the left flank, thus making a gap and leaving our left entirely exposed. If General Warren would fall back to our line and connect with our left we could, I think, hold the line, and I can send him 3,000 or 4,000 men. I will have them ready to move in five minutes, and have asked him where to send them, but if he moves off to the left we will be exposed.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.
