can Secretary to this insolent demand, couched m
insolent term's, and accompanied with a studied
and pompous threat
"The Government of the United States enteitains no doubt
after this avowal of the transaction aa a public transaction
authorized and undertakei by the British auth trities that the
individuals concerned in it ought not by the principles of pub
he law and the geneial usage of civilized States to be bollen
responsible in the ordinal y tribunals of law foi their participa
tion in it"
Has he not surrendered this point—tamely sur-
rendered the right over McLeod at the bidding of
British power' Has he not, passi ig by the ms >-
lent threat oi the British minister, given up the
r ghis oi New York1* In what a condi ion d >es
this place us before the world' A sovereign Stite
maintaining its right, ami the Executive of he
Sates, through Mr Webster, yicldng up every
principle for which we are conten hng S r, this
servile cringing to Brm h power has brought
sname and dishonoi on our country I is not the
language of freemen—i is no the language rf
conscious truth Sir, I would never—never make
the concesión, and lea*t of all v/ould I do it ¿hile
a threat was hanging above my henl
But, sir, m what condition has it placed us be-
fore the world? Has it not placed the United
States m a position where ihe must be disgiaeed m
the eyes of the civil zed world, or be driven to the
necessity of declaung wat against England'! In
the aspect ot affairs as they beice stood, tne
first blow mus have been sttuck by the British
power, and, sir, 1 tell you that England would
hate allowed fifty McLeods to be executed before
she would have declared war against the Amen-
can Republic Sne knjws tier ov/ i interests too
well, anu, above a't, she knows the brave), the
indomitable courage, the unooundeu love ot free-
dom, which fills eveiy American bráist, to p ung>
m batile for an executed felon Sir, her cours. of
conquest is now among nuny Chinamen, or poor
and helpless Hindoo , whoever hei powei can
strike terror, is felt her merciless course But, sir,
the time admonishes me to hasten to a ek e I
ask for the opportunity to w pe out ibis foul stain
upon our common country Sir, throughout the
length and breadth of th s land, id every valley,
and on every hill, wherever the banner of our
Union waves, we shall hear a hffertnt language
than that which ha? been spoken by our Secretary
I ask the represen atives o this co intry—1 implore
them to take measures to wipe oat this ioul blot
Let us not dwell a day under the imputa ion <f
crouching—basely crouching and c 'Bgmg at t ie
feet of British power, and, leasi of all, let not our
humiliation be the work of a kindred hand
And for mv own State, sir—tor New York, and
for her gallant sons, tor the Empire State, I say—
she never has, she never can, she never will s jb-
mit to such docinnes as those which have emanated
from the Secretary ot S ate, and have found sup
porters on this fiocr No, sir, no1 I end as I be-
gan, she never can, and she never will, yie d hei
honor, compromise her dignity, or   give up her
rights
Sir, this is the language -iot only of New York,
but of the Union—the language of every freeman,
and if it were not so, I should cease to feel proud
of my country Before these doctrines can find a
responsive echo in the bosoms of the American
people, herslory must have departed, h r ¡.pint
must be broken and decayed, her hop s prostrate
and disappointed That mighty bird must have
ceased its flight, the «tars of glory must be blotttd
fro n our banner, ere we shah submit to such in-

SPEECH OF MR. PIERCE,
OF NEW HAMPSHIRE
In, Senate, July 1st and id, 1841—Upon Mr Btj-
chinan's resolution calling upon the President
to furnish the names of persons removed from
office, and of those appointed, since the 4th of
March last
Mr President Alth agh I could not, witti my
convictions ot what bel mged to myself as an Ame-
rican Senator, and to the friends with whom i
usually act here, accept the offer to proceed in this
debate as a matter of favor, still I appreciate the
kind feelings of the Senator from North Carolina
[Mr MangdmI towards me personally, and thank
him 'or waiving his motion to lie upon the table,
and tbus having us to extrci e tne poor privilege
of di«eussmg tms interesting subject during the
morning hour
After the full and satisfactory exposition yester-
day and the day before by the Senator from Illi-
nois [Mr McRoeerts ] I should, probably, have
relinquished the design of taking a part in the de-
bate, e pecially in 'he present stage ot it, but for a
paragraph wmch I noticed m the National Intollt-
gencer yeste dav morning, in ihe following words
'The Opposition papers rontin lally accuse ti e Whigs of
violating their prote^iona, now that they have come into pow
er andyettre^ veiy sain, pa eis 1 udly prodded a year

N)M, nr, we will see who have rehed upon the
credulity of the people, and who are still peisevir-
mg n iheir attempts to ímnose on that aedultty
While removals are lakmg place t/ith unparalleled
rapidity, the names cl the  men removed and of
th ise appointed are not chronicled from  week to
week in the Government paper, as  was the case
during the late  Administration, but articles like
this aieeirculated i<tr and near, calculated  to  fix
the impression aKemptcdti be made uptn thepno
lie mind p° iding the late Pre idential election, tLat
our  arguments  were  fallactou-—our professions
insincere—our assertions bas°tes      What  aecu
sations did we bring asatnst you?    Wh it An   we
claim for ourselves?   Ianswei,lor one, sir   I de-
dal ed publicly, eveiy w ere, when I had occasioi
to address my countrymen in small orlaige assem-
blies, that yuu   had   but one  common  ground—
opp siiion to t"*e  then  41minist>-->*io),  th-it  your
a ay ct leaders  from  the ea tairs oi trfciit cs up
waris who cheered on m your unp   e dented dis
plays and your  boi leious movemert     were <*n -
mttedby ore com non impulse—host) ity   to   th--
Democratic party and Democratic prm-ip'es coa
pl'd  with ambit on for plac    and expectation  of
prefer íert   thMxruhad io comrpon platform of
principies—no le? hng mea ures ot naticnal impor-
tance, and involving  the gre3   national interests,
which you dared to prt«ent to the. American pei pie
either 11 addresses or íesolut uns fiom the conven
tion  at Harnsburg or Baltimore—none which vou
could present, without at once breaking up and dis
tnctmg   the heteiogenecus mitenals   of   wmch
your patty was compo ed
So far from saving that you "made no profes-
sions," we dtciared that    ou had them prepared,
by erne rt and arrangement, cl evtiy comp txion
and hue, of all scrts at 1 descriptions, suited for
every meridian—as ertion.and professions designed
to reacj  the pass ons and the prejudices of eve /
neighborhood where tney were to be promulgated
It was with \ou, we a sertcd, a contist in which
gre it pinciples were kept stuliously m tie back
ground, while polic/, expe ¡te cy, ad captandum ar-
nems, were don g then woik m each S pte accord
d rg to the peculi-u  interests  and  opinions <f its
people     Thete  were, 1   is  true, some assert ons
and professions «ui ed to ail   poitnna of tue ou
try, and  re ortect   to  on  all  occasions     Amov"
i   them, the standin  a-m/ humbuj—the chnrge that
we desired to reduce the wages ot the honest labo
r-r, and reduc the lab ret h mself to the condit on
of the «tris ot  Russia—hat  tne   A'mtnsratun
had alt°adv, by ltaimpnv tence,iu extravagance,
and it« pr fligacy, run the nation n debt mote than
thiryn llions o<"dolbrs     {list-tied to my hono-
rabl    colleague  vith unfe gted pleasure    when
he wrung from the A Imims ration  the other day
the unwilling admission thatth s last charge—mist
ot ad hatp-d upon during that canvass— ?as base-
less a m^re "phantom of the imagination " While
meeting these assaults and professions before the
people, we bore aloft, wherever we went, the Con
stitution, tho  resolutions of 1793 and the received
opinions of the iatheisof Democracy, nsaj plicabie
to the great questions wmch we k íevv mnst ag ta e,
and  whicn are now agitating Confess and Ihe
country.   We wre wo ulh , teartully b-aten, but
we were not routed, we   tood upon ihe field at the
close of the conflict, wt h 'hree hundred thousand
more Democratic legal voters than had ever be
fore, in any single election, exercised ths right of
freemen at the polls Routed ' No, sir, nrr dis-
heartened We are now here, upon this elevated
ground, as ihe representatives of eleven hundred
thou and intelligent, patriotic, Ugal voters, to re-
new ihe contest upon those great issues which we
strove, uut strode in vain, to bring distinctly before
the pepple m their popular meetinge—issue', upon
the determination of which we in our hearts believe
rest the liberties of this countrj The subject of
the resolution of tre Senator trom Pennsylvania
[ r Bughanan] had no slight influence in that
contest and I tbank the Sena or from South Caro-
lina [Mr. Preston] for h s interposition Let the
debate go on, he says, let it hive its fullest latitude,
and, as i understood him, he and his friends will
undertake to show that they have not departed
from the paucities which they have avowed in re-
lation to lemova's fiom office Sir, they shall re-
ceive no injustice at my hands It I shall be so
unfi rtunate as to etr in any matter of fact or de-
duct on, « hile I -ha'l regrt t the error, it will afford
me pleasure to give the prompt correction.
Inust, Mr   Pres dent, that we shall not be de-
nied the mformition sought by ta  resolution, and
thit it may not be embarrassed by another call that
must inevitably occupy much time at the Depart-
ment and can be oí no po«sib e weight, so far as
the profe'Hioas of thtv Administration and its prac
lice are concerned    Tne information will be mte-
restn ¿ tnd useiul, rot only here, hut to the whole
eountn,aud unless statements made to me upon
high authority are singula ly incorrect,  I shall be
abl , with the  contemplated r-port  before us,   to
impart some adtitional in oimation that cm hard
ly iail to be ot interest, parttculaily to the Senator
fromlNorh Carolina,  [VXr   Mahgum]—informa
tit n connecting 1 self wit*i rights and interests dear
to his eonsti uents, and at  the same time   with the
¿   i 11 oi tne Executive here, particularly with one
if ihe Departments     I deal in no mysteries, and
«1 1 s ate the nature of the information to which I
allude     In the Stale which I have the honor in
part to reorcsent,  there ate as appears by the re-
turn  ot the late elec, 1 n, about twelve hundred
Ab >l tion voters, m a poll ot between fifty and sixty

part/ is m point of numbers, thiy aie so peculiarly
the favorite  of this Administrat on, that when re-
movals  have tec irred, the va-aied places have
been filled by zaalous and prominent members of
ihat faction    What is  most remarkable, Demo
crats alone have no' been n moved to give place to
them    I give an instance—place and names—
with the view that if I have been led into error, and
do injustice to the Department, I may be readily
conected    At Hiveihill, one of the most conside-
r ble towns in that Slate, William Barstow, a wor-
