law, caused local mstitutioqs to spring up like
mushrooms under ihe fostering care oí an all pow-
erful hand here, dispensing distinction and patron-
age and wealth, until all society became, as it were,
dependent upon his will and movements Let no
man be induced to create the same state of things
again, when a bold and daring genius may be
tempted to run the same career, and bring the pro
perty and honest industry of the countiy under the
will and mercy of him who may give hie and soul
to this Federal Government
rtu  conflict produced a tremendous shock, and
even the banking system itself, the local insti-
tution';, created for the express purpose of sus-
taining the warfaie against that overshadowing
central institution, have been paral) 2ed, for a time
at least, under its desolating effects And here I
will say, that though I ever believed in the uncon-
stitutionality oí that institution, yet those who made
war upon it never could have succeeded without
laismg op poweiful local antagonist interests The
effect of that war was felt irom one end of the
countiy to the other, and the consequence was that
sagacious capitalists in stocks, ready lor any result,
began to look elsewhere for sate investments, and
hence it was that we find such extensive invest
meats in real estate, to the amount of iorty millions
oi dollars in two years alone, in the public lands,
besides upwards of one hundred millions m other
real estate speculations, such as town and village
piopeity, clc This conflict agamst ci edit, deeply
affecting currency, was anticipated by capitalists,
who preferred uskmg the loss of something m the
high puces of real estate, to a piobable loss of all
It was at least investing in something beyond total
destruction irom an arbitrary government
Sir, when this change began, and the capitalists
began to contiact their credit, the banking institu-
tions oí the countiy also felt it incumbent upon
them to contract too And what* was the íesulf!
Why, the result was exactly what we now expeli-
ente
Approaching this juncture, viz in 1836, the de-
posite act was passed, to be earned into effect m
1837 I was a suppoiter of that law, sir, but I un-
derstood it at that time, is I now undeistand it to
be, in the nituie of a bill for geneial account and
settlement with those i istitutions which had, up to
that time, leaned upon, and been sustained by, the
credit and fiscal action of this Government They
were therefore compelled by that distribution, or
deposite act, and particularly in the peculiar man-
ner in which it was executed, to come to a general
account Then paper was necessarily compelled
to be "convertible papei,oi they themselves com
pelled to suspend specie payments This ciicum-
stance, connected with our immense foreign debt,
<md the demand theieby produced for sp-cie, or its
i ^preventative abroad, hiought about this íesult
that is, brought us to the pi esent condition oí the
country, under a general suspension ol specie pay-
ments by the banks
But, Mr Chairman, I will say here, that the
great and radical difficulty, and, in fact, the pi i-
mary cause, that produced the present state ol
things, arises from tne peculiar currency which, in
modern times, has so much extended itself in
Great Britain and in this countn, and its peculiar
capacity for expansion and contiaction, in the
hands and under the control of banks and bank
els, and particularly irom the fact that there as
heie the system has depended upon and been so
deep'y identified w ith G wernment and its finan
(ial action for suppoi t and extensive ci edit Th s
is the leal md íadical cause which has pioduced
tnis great shock in oiu modern banking and credit
system
¡bir, under this suspension of specie payments,
the Government is found in a peculiar situation
Under fh<* law oí 1H16 it can receive, inpayment
oí its dues, nothing but gold andsilvei, oí con vert-
ióle paper or noies.oi the then Bank of the United
¡states the latter clause became however piactically
íepealed when these institutions suspended specie
payments thereby making their paper lncomern
ble Then, there w as, in. fact, under the provisions
of the law, an immediate separation of the Govern-
ment fiom the banking institutions of the country
Under the law, the Government could not take in
convertible paper, and convertible papel did not
exist frum one end oí the country to the other, with
the honorable exception, peihaps, oí one 01 two
banks in the State of Geoigia, and a single small
uis itution in [he State of Ohio And now, sir, the
giea qaesioa piesented to this committee i , not
whether you will separate the banks from the Gov-
ernment, because that is already done, but the great
question is, whether and how we shall reunite the
Government and the banks Under this view of
the case, we have three alternatives presented to us
The first is, to reunite ourselves, or rather the
Government, with the State institutions, in the man
ner in which they have been connected for the last
three or four years
The second is, the proposition creating a bank of
the United States, a national institution to conduct
the fiscal operations of this Government, and legu
late the exchanges and currency of the country
The third is, the proposition on your table, sir,
to separate the Government and its agents from all
banks whatever
Now, sir, as to the first pioposition if we do not
separate the Government from the banks in this pe-
culiar juncture of our affairs, we never can sepa
rate them The system will be fixed upon us for
evei, and we compelled to i un the same round we
have done for the last three or lour years m peno
dical terms, and then be in the same, or a worse eon
dition, distracted and embarrassed fro n one end of
the country to the other
Now, Mr Chanman, I have heard a great deal
as to the compai ison between the State bank sys
tem, as it is called, and the peculiar policy of sepa
rating the Government and its agents irom all banks
whatever I have heard, too, much declamation,
and no little denunciation of that system, that it is
the most outrageous proposition ever presented to
the American people, that it is, m fact, a treasury
bank Yes, sn, I have heard much declamation
upon that subject, both here and elsewheie (better
suited to newspaper politics than grave legislation,)
but I confess to you that that declamation only re
minds me very str mgly of the desci iption of a cer
tain gnndiloquen class of poets which a piofound
and polished ancient critic describes as swelling—
" Inceplisgi avibus plerumque et magna profesáis,
Purp ireus late qui splendeat, unus et altei
Assuitur pannus '
It is not pietended that this system is perfect, be
cause you cannot present any system to the people
that is so All questions upon which apiacticallcg-
íslatoi is called to act, involve more or less a com
parison of evils, and we must not adopt any mea
sire as perfect, but as embracing the lesser eal
We must go on to perfect details after the establish-
ment of great and vital principles It is neither
pretended sir, that this bill involves no patronage
it certainly does to a degree But the question is,
whethei this system or that of employing the local
banks as fiscal agents of the Government, contains
or involves the most patronage1 Now, upon that
point permit me hei c to say that I feel myself com
m tted from a deep and an anxious reflection upon
the question heretofore The question is between
the power and influence of an individual, and the
power and influence of an incorporated bank To
tell me that a bank which chooses to go into the
politic s of the country with its poner to extend dis-
counts and accommodations to its fnends, and re
fuse them to its. enemies, has no more influence
than an individual is to tell me what is conliadict-
ed by the dailv experience of every man even if
that individual have millions of the public money
in his possession for safe keeping Sir the one
svstem winds and spreads itself mío all the secret
and business recesses of society Hnndieds and
thousands of honoiable and high minded men have
been brought to degradation and sycophancy bv
this tiemen'ons and almost invisible power I
ha'e seen then around then domestic fiip sides,
with eveiythng apparently to bless and gladden
the heart of nan lull of sadness and gloom—while
even those who weie the confiding and devoted
pirtnets of then joys and their sorrow- weie in
doubt and ignorance as to the causes of their me]
aneholv and dejection
Si i, this system is as hidden as the air «e breathe
and penetrales unseen but alas not unfelt, into
the most retired scenes of society No man can
tell upon -what power he is depending when
he looks foi support aid and assistance from
this svstem No man can tell v\ hat the situation of
his neighbor may be—what his obligation'—his
all anees and contracts that swerve him from the
path of independence and rectitude Then how
can vou say that such a system as this, allied to,
and dependant upon Government has less pation
aere than thai which makes an individual respon-
sible for wha ever public funds he may have m
hii cti to ly   ' ithout the power oí loaning, vv ithout

the power of discounting, without the power of ac-
commodating a friend, or refusing an enemy, un-
less he choses openly to incur the odium and pen-
alty of cume and misdemeanor? It does seem to
me that the question admits of no argument so fai
as the question oi patronage is concerned
But I have said, sir, that I felt myseli somewhat
committed on this subject In 1835, a friend of
mine from Virginia, (Mt Gordon,) now not a
membei of this House, (and I will here take occa-
sion to say oi him, that he is a gentleman who
would have done honor to Virginia in her proudest
daysof gloiv and lame,) presented the very identi-
cal proposition to this House, which is embraced
in the bill on your table For that proposition, sir,
I then voted I acted from reflection, and from a
conscientious conviction of the effects of that mea-
sure to bring about honesty in the Government,
and secure the independence of the people True,
Í was then but a very voung man, and had but for
a lew weeks taken my seat in this House, yet, sir,
1 had made up my opinion fiom observation and
reflection And although young, yet, to use the
language applied to anothei, I was old enough—
" A( la parentum jam legerc, et quas sit potent cosnosccre
villus
Sir, I had foimed my judgment then, and I have
not yielded it since On the ccntrary, the expe
nence between then and now has only tended to
confirm my conviction
I desire the clerk to read the proposition, and the
vote upon it
The question recurred on the motion made by
Mr Gordon, to amend the said bill, to strike out
all thereof after the enacting words, and insert
" I hat, fiom and after the-----day of------in
the year-----, the collectors of the public revenue,
at places where the sums collected shall not ex
eeerjl the sum of-----dollars per annum, shall be
the agents oi the Treasurei to keep and disbuise
the same, and be subject to such rules and regu
lations, and give such bond and security as he sha'l
prescribe for the faithful execution of their office,
and shall receive, in addition to the compensation
now allowed by law — pel centum on the sum^
disbursed, so that it does not exceed the sum of
------dollars per annum
" Sec 2 And be it further enacted, That, at all
places wheie the amount of public revenue col-
lected shall exceed the sum of-----dollars per an-
num there shall be appointed by the President, bv
and with the consent of the Senate, receivers of the
public revenue to be agents of the Treasurer, who
shall give such bond and security to keep and dis
burse the public levenue, and be subject to such
rules and regulations as the Tieasurer shall pi e-
scribe, and shall leceive for their services------per
centum per annum on th  sums disbursed   pro
vided it does no! exceed the sum of------dollars
pei annum
' See 3  And ¥ it further enacted, That  from
and after ihe-----day of-----   the whole levenue
of the United States, dern ed from c ustoms of lands
or other souices shall be paid m the cunent coins
of the United States
This received 33 votes
Mr Chairman it was not mv desire, nor have
I caused the vote upon that proposition to be read,
to show the consistency or inconsistency of any
honoiable member of this body My sole and entir"
ohjectwas to piove that the pi esent bill was nonew
proposition and that as far as I am concerned, it is
the verv i tentical proposition upon which I the i
voted coo!)} and deliberate!) I have no desire,
sir 'o show that there has been any contradictioi
on the part t f any gentleman on this floor, or that
there has been any change in their opinions It
is with neithei of those views (hat I had the pro-
position lea' I w ill now quote a paragiaph from
the speech of the mover oí the pioposition made
at the time as illustia mg the views under which
we acted aid which teo tiu ^pouitiavs what has
leal y happened sirce, and what I fear we will
again see, if the sj stem he continúen Mr Gordon
said
" There is another consideration which has
induced me to offei th s amendment We may all
veiy plainly see that the contest for the Executive
office is the rock on which the permanency of this
republic is likely to be wrecked And the vehe
