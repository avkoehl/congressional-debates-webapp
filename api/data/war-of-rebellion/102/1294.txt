HDQRS. DIST. OF TEXAS, NEW MEXICO, AND ARIZONA,Houston, May 4, 1865.

To the People and Army of Texas:

CITIZENS AND SOLDIERS: The news which reaches us from the East, though wanting confirmation, and in my opinion entirely untrue, is such as to make even more sacred than ever the obligation which is on every soldier and every citizen to perform his whole duty.

Citizens, encourage by Your patriotic example Your noble Texan soldiers in performing their duty! Soldiers, stand by Your venerated and illustrious President in his misfortunes, and above all present to Your foe a united, firm, and defiant front, and to the world the spectacle of an army of citizen soldiers determined under any circumstances to be true to their duty, to be faithful to their beloved Confederacy, and ready at any moment to put down depredators on their innocent fellow-citizens and traitors to their country who seek by every means to undermine Your fidelity!

The path of duty and the path of interest is here, as it is everywhere, the same. Let all good soldiers exercise over their weaker comrades the moral influence which the good and noble always possess.

Soldiers, give to Your officers not only Your official obedience, but Your cordial, moral support.

We have immense power in our hands. Let us wield it as both honor and interest dictate, thus commanding the respect of our enemies, securing our own rights, and preserving public order and decorum. Come what may, we will thus be true to our colors and to the interests of the great State of Texas. We are not whipped, and no matter what events may transpire elsewhere, recollect that we never will be whipped.

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General:

LIEUTENANT: Learning from a staff officer of General Bagby that he probably left Natchitoches last evening or this morning, I inclose You copies of two communications addressed him yesterday. I regret to be compelled to report that the demoralization of the garrisons of the forts is still progressing. Last night there were nearly fifty desertions. They avoided the north bank, where I had cavalry patrols, and managed to
