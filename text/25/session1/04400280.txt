paper from circulation, and to give us a specie
currency, and no other, it must set lo v, 01 k ma
different manner The President must induce the
people to amend the Constitution oí the United
States, and take from the States tne po« er of creat-
ing banks, before his schemes of a metallic cur-
rency can be accomplished As long as the Stales
have the power to make banks, they wi'l exercise
it, and as long as they do, theit will be a nec^suj
for a national regulatoi in the foim oí a national
bank. I will not go mto the argument to prove
the constitutionality of a national bank as a neces-
sary fiscal agent of Government, and as an essen-
tial mean of regulating and conducting the com-
merce between the States, nor will I consume time,
by exposing the pretences that tho people hav e de-
cided, conclusively, that Congress had no cotisiitu
tional power to create such a bank, nor mil I stop
to notice the ridiculous declamation, imputing to
the stockholders of a national bank (composed, as
they are, oí a large number ot old men, old
women, and orphan children,) designs unfriendly
to public libertv Such a discussion would be
premature at this time
One of my principal objections to the sub-Trea-
sury scheme is, the increase of Executive power
and pationage, which would necessarily result irom
it. The Secretary of the Treasury says, " the
whole addition of principal officers ncd not ex-
ceed ten " He estimates the increased annual ex-
pense at fifty or sixty thousand dolíais only Ten
principal ofliceis' What salanes would yougive
tieach1 Not less, ! suppose, thin \ou give an
Auditor, p,000 a year, especially as thcvvoi'l
be located i,i the large cities What a scianible
among office-seekers this new batch ol offices would
produce' How many interview * and intrigues at
the White jaouse would grow out oi it, I leave to
those who are fund of such speculations Irmly
thousand dollars a yeai I set down as the least, for
ten " jiimcipal officers,'' unilei this scheme1 How
many to boj officers—clerks and agenis—will be
required, we aie not informal, nor are we told
what necessity there will be Au additional build-
ings, nor are wc told where they ate to be located
I will venture to predict that, instead oi $>GO,0(JO a
year, this sub-Tieasuiv scht me will cost the nation
double oi treble as much, should it ever go into
operation , and just m propomon .is the people
lose money, to sustain the establishment, so will tne
President gam power to n «aid his paitisins
But, sir, I look upon I u- new scheme is an en-
teung wedge merel} , th< beginning ol a new sys-
tem, uhic^i will ultimately jilace all the money oi
the nation trader Executive conttol The feecretai y
a'ready hints that he could imtnsh an excellent
general paper cunencv, m small bilh, based upon
an equal amount of --pecia deposited in his sub-
Treasuries I admit it cotiid be done, and that it
might be convenient to tne people. But the uansi-
l on is so easy from a sub-Treasury bank of depos-
ite to a sub-Treasurv btnk oj dacount, that 1 appie-
hend great dangei, m the progress of events, that
ih" President w ul deem it piupcr to c<ll on Con-
gress i<r power, through his Steictarj, to lend
money at least to the extent of the surplus levenue ,
and that Congress in obedience to Executive recom-
mendations, will sanction the project The Secre-
tary now sav-, m substance, m the mith page of
his late repoit, that "it is impossible to conduct
our fiscal operations an- lengih of tinv wita case,
vigor, and uniloimit), without «■( me Hiciiiegulaloi
as a power to issue and redeem Tieisii,\ noie^ or
to invest and sell the investment ol surpluses I
am appi< heriste that a power to lend the suiplus
would, in the S cr\-tar) '¡> estimation, b found a
better jc*ul<iloi ' and that the whole schemt nj
sub-Treasuries will e entuatc in a Government
bank, where the money cf th' nation will be loaned
outatthe will and pi<=ss neol the Pre idont Should
•«uch a state of things evei arme and if there is
no curtailment oí Executive pow ei is el um*d and
exercised by the late Piesident, I , m i"sdv to de
clare that American libertv exists no longer The
people will become the meie «dave - t nonet,
and nothing short of revolution it II Imist their
chains.
The Secretary now proposes thai ( tn   i s> u m d
«authorize him  to  vest "any unexp <-!"d paccss '
" in safe State stocks, at their market rate, subject
to be sold again whenever the prtceeds shall be
wanted to discharge existing appropriations"
President Jackson was horror-struck at the idea
that the National Government should become a
partner 11 a Stale corporation' Well do 1 remem-
ber his -v eto íelative to the appropriation for the Mays-
vil'e and Lexington load But now it seems that
a power to become a pai tner or stockholder, through
the instrumentality of the Secietarv of the Trea-
sui} , in a State stock concern, is a most harmless
anil desirab'e matter' The Secretary modestly asks
permission to do, at his d scretion, that which the
late President would not permit to be done by act
of Congress
I look upon this stock-jobbing project and the
sub Tieasury scheme in the sane hgnt, and I be-
lieve the} were both conceived in the spirit of that
policy which grasps at power, and which has for
us objec* the concentration ot all power in Fxecu-
tive hand 
But, Mr Chairmin, I niiut hasten to a close I
must trespass upon the time of the committee, how-
ever, with a lew additional remarks Suppose the
President's sub-Treasuries m full operation—sup-
pose all the good should lesitlt from them which
the President expects, then, I ask, will any cf the
blessiugs fall upon the heart of the nation 1 Will
Kentucky feel its genial influences, in reviving its
drooping commeice, and furnishing a sound cutren-
cv i JNone of the public revenue, arising from
taxation, is collected in the inteiioi States at pre-
sent, • or is theie an) prospect that such will be
the case in any short time Your sub-Treasuries
will therefoie be confined mo&tly,ifn itexclusivel ,
to the seiboard, wheie vout. public rnone} will be
hoarded, and where it is usually expended The
valley ot the Ohio will der ve no benefit fiom the
plan, and will be compelled to struggle through its
present difficulties unaided by the Go\ ernment,
which his been the author of its calamities
I can perceive no benefit to result from the
scheme to any cla^s, unless it be the office-holders
and office seekers Sub-treasuries may be mstru-
mi nts in the hands ot the first to enab'e them to re-
tain power , and by the multiplication of offices
and salaries, the chances of the lattei to obtain pro-
fitable situations will be incieased By receiving
nothing but specie for revenue, the Goc ernment will
beenabledtopavheroihceisinabpttei currency than
t lat which the people use, and the officers of Gov-
ernment may, if ihey please, employ then salaries
m shaomt; depieciated bink notes m the hands of
the people I am totally opposed, Mi Chairman,
to a good eiiirencj for the office holders, and a bad
currency for the people My ideas of republican
equality require that all of us should fare alike. I
ra inot consent to any establishment-which will
place the officeis of Government upon a better
footing than the people at large noi cm I ever
sanction such invidious distinctions as that recent-
ly made bv the Secretary of the Treasury betw een
the creditors ot the Government, preferring the
members oí Congiess to the war-wirn pensioner
and day-laboier , and pav ing gold and silver to us,
and irredeemable bank paper to them Sir, I was
astomsned to hear the other dav, at the delence
m ide foi the Secretaiy by the member (torn North
Ciulina, (Mr McKay) He lead the law to
piovo that all the creditor of the Government
vvtjt entitled to specie and then argued that as all
ci uld not get it, some must of m cessity take paper,
oi wail until the means of the Treasi ry would en-
an'e the aecretai} to pay in specie Why, sir, the
/aw provides that our army ball be fed vvitn whole-
some fjod , but sjppose, nndei peculiar circum-
stances, it canm t be procuied for all, what would
vou think of a commanding general who gave or-
ders to feed the se geants and corporals on the best
cured Kintucl y ba>ns, and is^ue out lations of
Unite 1 meat to the common soldiers'? Sn,such
conduct would piodnee a mUmy against that ge
ner 1 I he mle of jus-tic  in such a case would be
to di\i(lc i itabi} , and to give each his pottion of
the good and tne bad If the Secietaiy could not
execute the law fully because the means were not
provided, no censure attaches to him for that The
ground of complaint is, that he acts partially , that
he favors the stiong, those who stand in least need
of favor, at the expense of the weak, who cannot
protect themselves If he had paid us in depre-
ciated papei, it would have acted as a stimulus,
growing out of our own losses, to shape our legis-
lation in such manner as to improve the currency
for the benefit of all closes
I have expressed my opinions, and now, sir, it
only íemains for me to vote against the bill under
consideiation
SPEECH OF MR   GRAVES,
Of   KENTUCKY,
[As tepoited m iho national Intelligence! ]
In the I{oui" of Rcpiesentahves, Thursday, September OB,
1837 -On the bil! lo postpone the payment to tne States of
the iourth instalment of the Surplus Revenue
Mr GRWEi-aro^e and said   The House is fatigued with
this dice ibbion    The subject itself is exhausted, and I am fully
persuaded theie lb no desire to hav e the discussion protracted
by me    Of all situation* none is less enviable, or more man.
spiciou^ to a public speaker, than that in which he is com
pellet! to id lie*s an unwilling audience    And were I to consult
my own inclination or prudential considel itions f should not
obtrude a single remaik upon the House at this late period of
the discussion     But such ire the pecuhai lei uions which this
bill bears to my S ate, and particularly my disinct, that I do
not feel authonzedto allow my individual inclinations to pre
domínale over a sense of mipeiious duty
Tnis bill an I that which the other d ly came to this House
fiom the Senate, proposing to authorize the Secretary of the
lieasuiy to call in fiom the deposite banks all the public depo
sites in specie, in the shoit space of foui, -^iy, and nine months,
should h tve been embraced m one They are dependent upon
each other one i& useless without the other, and hence they
have been, and I hall continue to ti eat them m this debate, a«
one and the same
The ■-> ate of Kentucky, fremthe time it came into the Union
up to the piesent j ear has nevei had one dollai appropriated
m bet b miera, whlNt she haa conti ibuted hei full share to the
public Iieasury This I am appnzed, mainly giew out of
hei [jo nion and she was c intent, \v'i 1st the national debt
was in the iom=e of Jujuui Hon, to wait until it was discharged,
un 1 i the tpmon that then theie wou'd annually be a large
t-um in the Treasury, lo be appiopnated to works of internal
impiovemi nt, m which she e\peeted to ehaie But when that
1 ng and much l csuod day lolled round, when the public debt
was pailoff iorcnibes which it is not my purpose here to
notice, the Middle end Western States soon became satisfied
that lora while at least they must not hope to share in the
disb nsements of the pub'ic revenue for purposes of internal
i npiovement
They submitted to then fa e, loi they saw an urevocable
mandate had gone forth from one who was all powerful, and
never levoked what in wrath he once said Matsy of the na
tional íepublican^ whose favorite objects were disappointed
bv the position taken by General Jaekson in his veto of the bill
making apt lopiiauons lo the lexington and AlaysviIJe turn
pue and othei objects have changed their opinions upon the
subject of the policy of the General Government making appro
p ntionsfoi, and carr>ing on works ( fm'ernal improvement,
because they think the empeciente of the last eight years has
shown that the President, without the \ atronage and power
incident to can ying on, m the States n te ml improvements,
wields quite as much political influence as is consistent with
the perpetuity of oui fieeaud lepublican institutions And I
am free o ivow that I myself vei} much question the policy of
thcsjstm f in ernat improvements by the Federal Govern*
men of which I was once bo zeiious an a Ivocate I desue
now as much as I tvei did to see the condition of our counuy
ameliorated ana its iesoorce& developed by the formation of
roads and canals but as much as I desire the accomplish
mentof this gi md object I piefei to foieso it and let the ¡states
erect their own works, to s-emg the power ard patronage ef
the Preside it inciea«o<l to an exlet t which large appropriations
to this cbject. would n ce«san!v enlarge it
But, whilst these S'aies reluctantly weie driven fiom their
favoiiteotjcu by these paiamounuonsiderationsof patriotism,
they claimed tn have divided among tin Slates the proceeds of the
sales oí the ] ublic land wilh wh ch to enable them to prose
