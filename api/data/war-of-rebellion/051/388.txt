Report of Colonel Bushrod Jones, Fifty-eighth Alabama Infantry.
HDQRS. FIFTY-EIGHTH ALABAMA REGIMENT,Near Chattanooga, Tenn., September 29, 1863.

MAJOR:In obedience to General Orders, No.-, I respectfully submit the following report of the action of my command in the skirmish on the 18th instant and in the battle of Chickamauga on the 19th and 20th instant:

Turner, assistant surgeon, was seriously stunned and shocked by the explosion of a shell and slightly wounded in the head by splinters. He was borne insensible from the field, but has since recovered and returned to duty.

At 3 p.m. we were ordered forward to relieve the brigade, then
