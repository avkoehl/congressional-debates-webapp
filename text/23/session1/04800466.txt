IN SENATE
Satdtday, June 21, 1834
A message upon executive business was received
.   from the President of the United States by Mr
Donelson-, his Pnvite Secietary
Mr HENDRICKS submitted the following
resolution, which was considered nnd adopted
Resoloed, 1 hat the Committee on Pensions be
nisu ucted to inquire iruo the exped lency of placing
the name of William Warnei on the mva'id pen-
sion roll
CCNERAL  APPROPRIATION BILL.
On motion of Mr WEBSTER, the Senate re-
sumed the consideration of the appropriation bill
for the year 1834
Several immatenal amendments to the bill s>u<*- '
gested by Mr  KVIGHT, Mr  HENDRICKS,
and Mi   WEBS! CR, weie adopted
Mr FORSYTH then moved to strike out the
appiopnation of fc,35,Q00 to Claike and Force, for
punting the Documentary History of the Ameri-
can Revolution, autho-ized to be executed by a
contract made with them oy the late Sccrttaiv of
State, (Mr Livingston,) and insert an appropri-
ation ot $15,000, to remunerate those persons for
expenses mcuried in preparing to execute the
contract. The amendment also provided that the
further prosecution of the work should hencefortn
be suspended
Mr F. was induced to offer this proposition
from a sense of justice to the late Secretary of
State, (Mr Livingston,) who, it was clear, had
misconceived his authority under the act of Con-
gress. It seemed to him that there was no limita-
tion to it—that it might ran up to one or two mil-
lions of dollars, and even by the anangement of
the Finance Committee, it would be reduced to
not less than $400,000 His ooject was to make
an appropriation sufficient to cover all the ex-
penses which these gentlemen have been subjected
to, and if any damage should be done them, they
could be compensated for it at the next session of
Congress
Mr CHAMBERS was afraid the proposed
publication was not very well understood. These
gentlemen preferred their memorial to Congress,
proposing this publication After due considera-
tion, Congress passed anactauthonzmg the com-
pilation, and prescribed the tribunal to which the
work should be submitted. The Secietary of State
was selected as this tribunal, and the work was
directed to be executed under his exclusive super-
intendence The publishers were willing that
Congress should prescribe just what materials they
chose for the work, and they weie to publish no
other than useful documents íelative to the history
of this country, and they were to receive an equiv-
alent for it equal to the lowest scale of compensa-
tion known to the Government for such work
Mr. C.'s remaiks were here suspended, by the
introduction of the Clerk of the House of Repre-
sentatives, who communicated the following join,t
lesolution, passed by the House
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representa-
tives of the United States of Jlmenca in Congress
assemhled, That a committee be appointed, on the
part of this House, to join such committee as may
be appointed by the Senate, to consider and report
by what token of respect and affection it may be
proper for the Congress of the United States to
expiess the deep sensibility of the nation on the
event of the decease of General Lafayette
Mi CHAMBERS said, as he was disposed to
manifest the highest sense of respect for the
memory of General Lafayette, he moved that the
appropriation bill be laid on the table for the pres-
, ent, and that the Senate proceed to the considera-
tion of this joint resolution, which was agreed to.
|     Toe resolution was tnen read, when
Mi   WEBSTER moved that the Senate concur
theiem
j     The motion was immediately agreed to
|     Mr CHAMBERS suggested that the committee
consist of one Senator from each State
I     Mr WEBSTER thoughtthe number too large.
Mr POINDEXTER suggested nine members
f     Mr CHAMBERS hoped the President might
appoint the committee, whicn was assented to
I     Mr   FORSYTH   expressed  a hope that  the
committee might consist of thirteen, as there were
peculiar associations connected with that number
The committee was then ordered to consist of
thirteen
[The committee was not announced when the
Senate adjourned ]
The Senate then resumed the general appropria-
tion bill, when, at the request of
Mr CHAMBERS, a communication from
Messrs Clarke and Force, making some explana-
tions relative to this work, was read
Messrs SOUTHARD, FRELINGHUYSEN,
and CHAMBERS, made some further remarks,
in sjppoitof the appropriation, and against the
amendment                                                                   i
Messrs KING, of Georgia, and HILL spoke at
length in opposition to the'further prosecution of ,
the work, and in favor o^the amendment
Mi   MANGUM then moved an amendment to I
the amendment, to strike out "$15,000 to iemu-
nerate," and  insert in lieu  theieof "$20 000 to
enable theSetretaiy of State to settle with Messrs
Clarne an 1 Foi^*  "
Mr  FORSYTH accepted the proposition as a
modification of his amendment
After iome fin tner ismaiks from Messrs FOR-
SYTH, WEBSTER, PRESTON, WILKINS,
and MANGfUM,
Mr BIBB moved a proviso to the amendment,
" That nothing herein contained shall be taken as
' a sanction of the contract made under the act of
' Congress by the late Secretary of State, on the
'9th March, 1833 "
The pioceedings of the Senate were here sus-
pended by the introduction of Mr   Dokelson,
Private Secretary of the President, who piesented
the following message.
To the Senate and House of Representatives
The afflicting intelligence of the death of the
illustrious Lafayette has been received by me
this morning
I have issued the general order enclosed to cause
appropriate honors to be paid by the Army and
Navy to the memory of one so highly venerated
and beloved by my countrymen, and whom
Providence has been pleased to remove so unex-
pectedly from the agitating scenes of life
ANDREW JACKSON.
Washington, June 21, 1834
After the message had been read,
On motion of Mr FORSYTH, it was referred
to the joint committee appointed on this subject
The Senate then resumed the consideration of
the appropriation bill, when
Mr FORSYTH accepted Mr Bibb's proviso.
And after some further remarks from Messrs.
KING of Georgia, KING of Alabama, CLAY,
LEIGH, CLAYION, WEBSTER, EWING,
and CALHOUN,
Mr FORSYTH asked the yeas and nays on
the passage of the amendment, which were ordered,
and are as follows
YEAS—Messrs Bibb, Black, Brown, Calhoun,
Forsyth, Grundy, Hendricks, Hill, Kane, King
of Alabama, King of Georgia, Linn, McKean,
Mangum, Morns, Preston, Robinson, Shepley,
Tallmadge, Tipton, White, Wilkms, Wright—23
NAYS—Messrs Bell,Benton,Chambeis,Clay,
Clayton, Ewing, Frelinghuysen, Kent, Leigh,
Naudam, Pomdexter, Porter, Prentiss, Robbing,
Silabee, Smith, Southard, Sprague, Tomlmson,
Tyler, Waggaman, Webster—22.
So the amendment was adopted.
Mr   BIBB then offeied a further amendment,
appropriating four hundred doLars for the purpose
of recording the opinions of the Supieme Court;
to which
Mr FORSYTH objected, as being an useless
expense, although it was a small one Copies of
the opinions of the judges could at all times be
obtained from the clerk of the court, and the opin-
ions of the com t delivered, were ahead y published.
Mr CLAYTON made a few remarKs m favor,
and Mi SMITH against the proposition, when
it was negatived.
Mi BIBB then moved a further amendment to
insert " eight hundred dollars each to the Judges
' of the superior courts of the eastern and southern
' districts of the Honda Territory, for additional
1 compensation "
After some conversation between Messrs FOR-
SYTH, BIBB, and KING of Alabama, the amend-
ment was agreed to
Mr. POINDEXTER then offered an amend-
ment to the bill, " that no payment shall be made
' under this or any other act passed at the present
' session of Congress in any other bank notes
' than those which are at par value at the place
' where such payment is made "
Mr  FORSYTH lemamed that he thought it
a very fair pioposuion and a very just one, but he
, would suggest that some difficulty might arise in
l its operat on from the circumstance that the notes
of the Bank of the United States we weie bound
to receive in payment ot ¡hied to the Government,
but all the notes of that bank were not everywhere
at par. For instance, the notes of the New
Orleans branch weie not at par at Philadelphia
Mr POINDEXTER said that a large portion
of the revenue was collected in New York, and the
notes of many ot tne local banks there weie not ot
par everywhere, and if the paper of those banks
was sent to a distance for disbursement, it would
occasion a loss to the person to whom it was pa d
His object was, when payments were made, that
it should be dollar foi dollar
Mr. WILKINS observed, that no bank notes
