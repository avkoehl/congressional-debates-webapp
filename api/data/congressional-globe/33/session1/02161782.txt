THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
July 18,
through the States. It is said, that although the
expenses here given are chargeable to each State,
that yet there are expenditures which ought not to
be so charged, because they are for routes running
through the State, the benefits of which are else-
where. I presume that is eminently true in regard
to the State of Maryland. And so it is true that
there are many cross mail routes in Massachusetts
over which letters and packages are carried, the
expenses of which are chargeable, and are charged,
to that State, while no revenue is derived by her
on account of such routes?. This is true with re-
gard to Massachusetts, and I presume that it is
true, to a greater or less extent, in some other
States. You will find®, upon an examination of
this table, which I will furnish for publication,
that the expenses of the State of Maryland are
$152,000, while the expenses of transportation are
$191,000. Gentlemen will find that the difference
m some States is very great indeed. In New Jer-
sey the postages collected were $89,000, while the
expenses were $74,000.
Mr. OLDS. The statements of the gentleman
are inaccurate, inasmuch as they do not contain
the commissions of the postmasters. In New
Jersey the total amount of expenditure was
$109,913 91, while the postages collected were
$89,074 17.
Mr. ELIOT. I am surprised that wehavenot
had the means of obtaining information from the
Depaitmenl of the kind which has been pro-
duced by the gentleman from Ohio, and which
appears to correct the tabular statement upon ;
which we are to base our action. In the State of
Mississippi, the postages collected were $73,000, 1
while the expenses of the transportation were i
$115,900. I name that State because it is the .
State which the honorable gentleman represents !
[Mr. Harry] who contended the other day that .
those who use the post office should pay for it. i
1 do it for the purpose of saying that it would I
be altogether out of the question to make that
rule apply unless a different rate of postage should
be established in one part of the country from
that which prevails in another. Why should the
citiv.en of Rhode Island pay more than he pays !
now for post office accommodation, when the j
amount chargeable to his Slate for post office ex-
penses is not more than one third of the amount
which the State itself accounts for and pays over
to the General Government. Because the State
of Mississippi is so situated that the receipts from
the Post Office Depaitment do not pay the ex-i
penses, would it be equitable, would it be ri<*ht, 1
that the citizens of Rhode Island should be made :
to pay more than theyalreadydo, when now they ;
pay so hti«;e a proportionate amount > i
Mr BARRY, (intenupting.) Will the gentle- i
man allow me to ask him a question? if, as a '
matter of justice, the postage collected in one part
of the country should be expended there, why !
should not the tariff collected in a State be spent !
there? We will pay you the surplus of postage I
if you will make up the necessary deficit which 1
we pay upon the tariff. I
Mr. ELIOT, 1 am afraid it would be a bad ;
bargain for the State which the gentleman repre- j
sents. The gentleman from Mississippi says that !
the amount collected within a State should be ex- !
pended within the State. Is the difference be- j
tween the amount which Massachusetts expends '
for poet offices and mail mutes, and thesum which j
she receives from postages collected, expended
within the Commonwealth ? Certainly not. It is !
paid over to the General Government, and the !
sum so paid more than makes up the deficit m ;
the account of the State which the honorable gen- i
tleman represents. Massachusetts does some- j
thing more than pay for the deficit m Mississippi. |
In view of these facts I ask whether it is right to '
impose a heavier tan upon one part of the com- ,]
mon count)y for the benefit of the other, and to
sustain and justify such imposition by the argu-
ment that those who use the post office should
pay its expenses. f
I have a statement prepared for the purnose of >
showing the inteiest affected by this bill, 'in this i
discussion there has been no statement made by ;
which it would appear to what extent the people !
of the country will be affected. We legislate to !
give our friends from foreign countries * home-!
stead; and now the gentleman from Ohio wants 5
to offset that kind of legislation by imposing upon
his constituents, I cannot help saying, a double I
charge on all the newspapers they receive. Let
us take care of our friends at home as well as of
those who choose to make homes among us here
from foreign lands. The honorable member [Mr.
Olds] will find, by consulting the statistics, that his
own State, the State of Ohio, will be injured to as
great an extent as almost any Siate in the Com-
monwealth except that from which 1 come, and
perhaps the State of New York, by the passage
of the bill on the table. Why, there are in the
State of Ohio two hundred and sixty-one papers
and periodicals printed. There is a circulation of
four hundred and fifteen thousand one hundred
and nine copies, and there is an annual issue of
thirty million four hundred and seventy-three
thousand four hundred and seven. The effect of
the passage of this bill would be that every one of
these pubticationsthat goes through the Post Office
Department, would have to pay double the amount
now charged.
Mr. OLDS. Will the gentleman allow me to
correct him again ?
Mr. ELIOT. Certainly.
Mr. OLDS. I venture to say that not one in
twenty of these publications will be affected by the
passage of this bill, from the fact that a paper cir-
culates through the mails in the county wheieit is
published withoutexpense. It goes free. Itwould
be the same thing in regpect to the country press
in Massachusetts. But when we come to the
comineicial cities, we find that it is the large-circu-
lation papers of these cities that will be ulfected by
the passage of this bill, as it is only these papers
that circulate largely outside of the county where
they are published, *md even outside of the State.
13 ut it will not at all affect the county papeis
which circulate in the counties, and in the counties
alone, pretty generally.
Mr. ELIOT. I am rather inclined to think
that the truth lies between the two propositions.
That the country press will not be affected so much
as the city press, t have no doubt. But that the j!
country press will not be affected at all, is a proposi- ||
tion which 1 am by no means inclined to admit. I!
The honorable gentleman may speak of its effect
in Ohio, but 1 think I may say, so'far as Massa- l|
chusetts is concerned, that the fact would not be |!
found as he state* it. Undoubtedly the city press ;;
would be most affected, and that has given rise to j!
the argument that this is a bill to affect the city ij
press, as between the city and country. Now, the | j
! uns «ver to this is twofold. So far as the city press is i j
1 concerned, the probability is, that if the bill passes, jj
these papers would not go through the maiis. !>
Then the bill would do no good to the Depart-
ment. If the bill should pass, and if the papers
did go th rough the mails, then both city and
country would be affected. Do not the honorable
gentleman's constituents receive papers from New
York > And are they not, so far,as much affected
by the rates of postage on papeis issued at that
end of the country as they would be on papers
issued near them?
Mr. OLDS. Yes; and I am willing that the ;
people m my State who take the papers from New '
York shall pay the postage for them which they |
cost the Government to transport them. j
Mr. ELIOT. The gentleman will find, by ex- j
amination, (I will publish the tabular statement !
which I have prepared,) that throughout the coun- |
try there are two thousand five hundred and twen-
ty-six papers and periodicals printed. This I !
take from the statistical tables furnished by the I
census of 1850. 1 ought to say that jt goes back to
that time which is the last period at which I could
find reliable information. But, taking the informa-
tion therefurnished, it appears there are two thou-
sand five hundred and twenty-six papers and pe-
riodicals. There were issues amounting to five
million one hundred and eighty-three thousand j;
three hundred and seventy-seven. And the annual j!
and total issue, at that time, amounted to four hun- j:
dred and twenty seven million four hundred and 'j
eight thousand nine hundred and fifty-eight. I1

The in-
crease since that time I cannot estimate. I have
set out these facts for the purpose of showing the
extent of the interest which this bill prejudicially
affects, if it operates substantially, and according
to the expectation of the honorable chairman.*
Mi. DAVIS, of Indiana, (interrupting.) I
would ask the Chair if the morning hour has
expired ?
The SPEAKER. It has not, by one minute.
Mr. ELIOT. As the hour is so nearly out, I
will yield the floor.
Mr. DAVIS. Then I move that the House
proceed to the business upon the Speaker's table.
There is an immense amount of business there
winch we might as well dispose of.
The motion was agreed to
RECESS OF CONGRESS.
The first business in order was the consideration
of the concurrent resolution of the Senate, "pro-
viding for a recess from the first Monday of July
until the third Monday of October."
Mr. HOUSTON. We have disposed of this
matter, ftpd 1 move to lay the resolution upon the
table.
The motion was agreed to.
IRON MOUNTAIN RAILROAD.
The next busines in order on the Speaker's
table was the bill of the House "granting the
right of way to the St. Louis and Iron Mountain
railroad, through (he arsenal, magazine, and Jef-
ferson barracks tracts," returned from the Senate
with an amendment.
Mr. BENTON. I move that the House concur
in the Senate amendment.
Mr. ORR. I am opposed to concurring in the
amendment; and before I present my views to the
House, I ask that it may be read:
The amendment was read, as follows:
