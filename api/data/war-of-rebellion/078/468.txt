HUNTSVILLE, September 25, 1864.

Lieutenant SAMUEL M KNEELAND,

Decatur, Ala.:

The cavalry, 100 strong, are on the roads, and the Eleventh Indiana Cavalry, 400 strong, have just passed here en route to Decatur. A train is now starting form here to bring down the Thirteenth Wisconsin. We have been delayed for want of cars.

WM. P. LYON,

Colonel, Commanding.

DECATUR, ALA., September 25, 1864.

General ROUSSEAU:

I have telegraphed General Starkweather that if the enemy have not yet crossed Elk river he will destroy the bridge, as the Elk must be too high now to be crossed. Artillery firing is heard this a. m. from Sulphur trestle.

R. S. GRANGER,

Brigadier-General.

DECATUR, September 25, 1864.

Major B. H. POLK,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

Forrest was at Sulphur trestle early this a. m. ; is by this time undoubtedly at Elk River; will be at Pulaski probably to-morrow. If that is so, I have to march to Pulaski, and that will be thirty- six miles. I certainly can't overtake Forrest before he gets there, as the road is destroyed and we have to march. My force here when I telegraphed was but 300 infantry and 250 cavalry. I could not proceed with them at that time, and the general's order contemplated my going with re-enforcements from General Steedman, only 700 of which have arrived, and they only a few minutes since. That next detachment will not be here before 10 o'clock to-night, certainly. I will now have to march to Pulaski if I follow after Forrest. Unless I receive orders, I will the moment the forces arrive. I have had my command at the depot, two miles and a half from here, since yesterday afternoon, waiting re-enforcements to move up the road.

R. S. GRANGER,

Brigadier-General.
