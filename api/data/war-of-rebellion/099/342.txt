Major General J. WHEELER,

Commanding Cavalry Corps, Confederate Army:

GENERAL: Yours addressed to General Howard is received by me. * I hope you will burn all cotton and save us the trouble. We don't want it, and it has proven a curse to our country. All you don't burn I will. As to private houses occupied by peaceful families, my orders are not to molest or disturb them, and I think my orders are obeyed. Vacant hoses being of no use to anybody, I care little about, as the ownes have thought them of no use to themselves. I don't want them destroyed, but do not take much care to preserve them.

I am, with respect, yours, truly,

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
