SIR: I have the honor to report that I arrived here and assumed command about 3.15 p. m.-perhaps a little later than the major-general expected, but I was delayed a little by some business that could not well be turned over instantly. I find an order concerning a fatigue detail that failed to report promptly, and am informed that it has been attended to.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

I received the order about 2 p. m.
