may understand the difficulties I contend against in my efforts to keep you supplied. I informed you last night that 1,750 bushels of corn were here loaded on the cars for you, but the proximity of the cavalry of the enemy renders it unwise to risk either the cars or stores by running out as yet. We will wait to be advised by you as to the points to which you wish shipments to be made, as we are all in the dark as to your movements. Meanwhile I have ordered 1,000 bushels of corn to Gordonsville via Lynchburg.

General BRAXTON BRAGG,

Richmond:

The enemy fell back last night from their position of yesterday toward the James River, apparently in some haste. Their pickets have appeared in large numbers on James River in vicinity of Howlett's and Dutch Gap. I have heard nothing yet of General Beauregard.

General BRAGG,

Richmond:

Lieutenant-Colonel Haskell reports the turnpike open to Petersburg. Until I hear where General Beauregard is I think it imprudent to move from here. I am ready to move as soon as I hear from him. Inform the Secretary of War of this. Lieutenant-Colonel Haskell went to Port Walthall Junction. Major Branch, of my staff, has found the enemy's fortifications near Howlett's on the river.
