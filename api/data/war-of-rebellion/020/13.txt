Report of Brigadier General Nathan G. Evans, C. S. Army, commanding Third Military District of South Carolina.
HEADQUARTERS THIRD MILITARY DISTRICT,Adams Run, S. C., April 30, 1862.

CAPTAIN: I have the honor to report, for the information of the major-general, that the enemy came up the Dawho and attacked the battery at Pineberry, and after and engagement of four hours succeeded in landing and destroying the battery. I immediately repaired to the spot and made preparations to meet him. After going up the Pon Pon, near Willstown, I met him with two pieces of field artillery, when he commenced to retire. Watching his movements, I again intercepted him near White Point with four pieces of artillery and two companies of infantry and engaged him at 50 yards. The contest lasted an hour very hot, and no doubt many of the enemy were killed and wounded. He retired in a crippled condition. I am, expecting a renewed attack to-day.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

N. G. EVANS,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
