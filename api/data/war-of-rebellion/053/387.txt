animated his troops and watched the enemy's movements so that throughout the battle it is believed that the enemy never advanced on his division without being repulsed, nor did his division at any time advance on the enemy without driving them. He has earned, and I respectfully recommend, his promotion to a major-generally of volunteers for gallant and distinguished services at the battle of Chickamauga.

Brigadier General L. THOMAS,

Adjutant-General U. S. Army:

I respectfully beg leave to make a special mention of Brigadier General Thomas J. Wood, who has always distinguished himself for vigilance in the fight well. In that of the 20th, after the right was shattered, he, with two brigade of his division and one of Van Cleve's, maintained himself against attacks of the rebels with firmness, skill, and determination. I respectfully recommend him to the President for promotion.

Very respectfully,

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.

Brigadier General L. THOMAS,

Adjutant-General U. S. Army:

Special mention of Brigadier General J. M. Brannan, volunteers: On his assuming command of his division was viewed with jealousy inspired by the double consideration of his being a stranger in this army, and a "West Pointer." His magnificent fighting at Chickamauga won for him the admiration of his own troops and all his companions in arms. General Thomas awards his especial praise for his behavior on Sunday afternoon, the 20th, where with his division he stood like a rock. I respectfully recommend his promotion to be major-general for gallant and meritorious services at the battle of Chickamauga.

W. S. ROSECRANS,
