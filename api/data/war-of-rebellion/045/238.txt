(Received June 21, 12. 30 a. m.)

Major-General MILROY, Hopewell, Bedford County, Pa.:

Take your orders for the present and get your supplies from General Couch.

ROBT. C. SCHENCK,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE SUSQUEHANNA, Harrisburg, Pa.,June 20, 1863-5. 20 p. m.

General MILROY, Bloody Run:

Have scouts to find out the presence of the enemy. Have your force so as to concentrate on Bloody Run or vicinity, or move on McConnellsburg, as circumstances may determine. You must not be scrupulous about taking horses so as to move rapidly; put two men on one horse. Should they pass Bedford, force their rear guard, and compel them to stand. Your well-know activity will suggest a thousand means to harass and scatter them. Brooks said that he would look after the passes west of the county; he may not hurry.

D. N. COUCH,

Major-General.

BLOODY RUN, June 20, 1863.

Major-General COUCH:

Dispatch just received from General Kelley that enemy are reported falling back, via Paw Paw and Bloomery Gap, toward Winchester. Can I take my cavalry through Chambersburg to Harper's Ferry?

R. H. MILROY,

Major-General.

Baltimore, June 20, 1863.

Major-General MILROY, Bloody Run, Pa.:

Did not receive dispatches referred to. You must report to Major-General Couch, as you are now his department. I have forwarded your telegram to Major-General Couch, so that he may know your wants.

DONN PIATT,

Chief of Staff.

ALTOONA, June 20, 1863.

General COUCH:

We are concerned here by the statement that General Milroy has asked for transportation to Huntington for 2, 000 men. Don't mean to be officious, but should like to know if he will leave Higgins alone, with unorganized and unmustered men, at Bloody Run.

H. COPPIE.
