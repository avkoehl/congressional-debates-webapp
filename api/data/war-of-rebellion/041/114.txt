Admiral FARRAGUT:

Does the Arizona need the company of sharpshooters which we put on her? They have been set ashore at Saint Francisville. Steamer Locust Point is in from the north; dates to the 24th. No news. Gold, 144. Tow-boat Boston captured at Pass a l'Outre last [night] by 20 rebels, and run out to sea.

N. P. BANKS.

Major-General, Commanding.

Major-General BANKS:

The sharpshooters are not needed on the Arizona. News from Grant, to the 27th, good. Rebels gone to sea is another Fox case. Captain and few of the Fox have arrived in New Orleans, and should be arrested.

D. G. FARRAGUT,

Admiral.

Admiral FARRAGUT:

You can have as much ice as you can store by sending for it. The ice vessel has got to be lightened to be sent out of this place to Baton Rouge.

JOHN WATTERS

Lieutenant-Commander.

Admiral FARRAGUT:

Please send the sharpshooters not needed on the Arizona to these headquarters. Orders have been sent to General Bowen, and New Orleans, to arrest the captain and crew of the Fox.

N. P. BANKS,

Major-General, Commanding.

Admiral FARRAGUT:

Colonel Prince reports no raft being built at the mouth of Thompson's Creek, and no indications there of any effort on the part of the enemy to escape. The ground on the west side is very swampy and can only be traversed by men on foot. A reconnoitering party, sent down the east bank, went as far as the mouth of Sandy Creek, which is about 340 yards above the mouth of Thompson's Creek, but met no pickets. Colonel Prince saw our camp at Faussee Point, and thinks the commanding officer there would be able to observe everything transpiring at the mouth of Thompson's Creek. Please ask him to do so.

N. P. BANKS,

Major-General, Commanding.

W. S. SCHLEY, Executive Officer of the Richmond:

Send as many 5-second fuses as you can possibly spare to Springfield Landing, in care of Colonel Arnold, chief of artillery.

E. TERRY.

JUNE 11.

Admiral FARRAGUT:

Captain and engineer of the Fox have been arrested, and one discharged on $10,000 bail, at the request of his relative, the Honorable Mr. Flanders.

N. P. BANKS,

Major-General, Commanding.

JUNE 10.

Admiral FARRAGUT:

Colonel Benedict informs me that you had orders not to fire. It must have been a great mistake in some of my dispatches. Please continue the fire of your mortars the whole night. We shall fire, also.

N. P. BANKS,

Major-General, Commanding.

Admiral FARRAGUT:

The enemy's commissary store has been removed to the bank of the river near the railroad landing. Cannot the guns and mortars of the fleet be brought to bear upon it?

CHAS. P. STONE.

Brigadier-General.
