General Kilpatrick is about to start for your headquarters. He reports having torn up four miles connectedly of railroad between Rough and Ready and Jonesborough, and ten miles at intervals, and destroyed two trains, including the one destroyed by Klein. He virtually captured Ross and brigade, but could not bring the men away. He was attacked by Jackson's cavalry and a division of infantry but effected his escape before the enemy could surround him, and brought off his own artillery and one piece of the 4 captured. Two pieces and 9 caissons were destroyed by him. He brought in about 70 prisoners and 3 battle-flags; all his own wounded. Has 97 killed and missing, among the missing 4 officers. Brigadier-General Long was wounded slightly in two places. He speaks in high terms of the behavior of his whole command. Captured Barlett is well and on the road with him to your headquarters.
