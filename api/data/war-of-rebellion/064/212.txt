General E. R. S. CANBY,

Commanding Div.of West Mississippi, via Cairo.

Your dispatch of May 26 is received. I agree with you that you can attempt nothing offensive in West Louisiana this year. Prevent, however, any of Kirby Smith's force from coming across the Mississippi; and I would like a strong feint or real attack on Mobile via Pascagoula in connection with Admiral Farragut's fleet. General A. J. Smith's division, re-enforced by troops that I can spare from Vicksburg, in all 10,000, would be sufficient. I know from prisoners taken that all the troops in Alabama are here with Johnston, and he is calling for every man from the Southwest.

Major-General, Commanding.
