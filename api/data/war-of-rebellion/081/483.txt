HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, June 28, 1864-10.40 a. m.

Major-General BURNSIDE:

Last night a dispatch was received from General Parke stating in substance that your signal officer reported a large body of troops had been moving from General Smith's front to the town; that in General Smith's opinion these troops were moving in "from" across the river. It was thought possible that this last part was intended to read moving in "force" across the river. I telegraphed to ascertain, but as yet have not had a reply. Which reading is correct?

(Received 12.25 p. m.)

Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

The dispatch of last night was intended as yours now reads:

Our signal officer reported a body of troops moving from General Smith's front toward the town, and General Smith expressed the opinion that they were moving on the other side of the river toward the town.

Your dispatch of last night was not given us by the operator as a question, but simply stating General Smith's opinion as was given in our dispatch and therefore no answer seemed required.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS, June 28, 1864-11.15.

General HUMPHREYS,Chief of Staff:

The firing commenced on our left, and was evidently brought about by the noise of our working parties attracting the enemy's attention. No ground has been lost. All is now comparatively quiet, and the work will go on. The object of the work is to so strengthen the skirmish line as to really become the main line. The telegraph has been out of order; otherwise we should have reported earlier.

Major-General.

General HUNT,Chief of Artillery:

Have you heard anything of the heavy guns and blasting powder for us?

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.
