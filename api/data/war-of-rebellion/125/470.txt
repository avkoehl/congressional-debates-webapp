Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War, Washington, D. C.:

SIR: Major General D. W. Lindsey, inspector-general of Kentucky, has been deputed by me to see and confer with you upon some matters which we deem important to our general defenses, as well as for the defenses of the State. As General Lindsey's services in the Army have made him known to you, any further recommendation is deemed useless.

Respectfully,

THOS. E. BRAMLETTE.

WAR DEPT., PROVOST-MARSHAL-GENERAL'S OFFICE,

Washington, D. C., July 5, 1864.

His Excellency JOHN A. ANDREW,

Governor of Massachusetts:

SIR: Your letter of this date has been received, saying:

If it can be arranged that men who should volunteer for 100 days" service, as requested by you to-day, shall be exempted from any draft that may be ordered during such 100 days" service, I think that the men you want can be readily and rapidly raised. I do not, of course, mean that they be exempted from any future draft, but only from such as might be ordered during the term of 100 days for which they are asked. And I am disposed to believe that this would be a proper construction of the conscription law.*

*The remainder of Andrew's letter, not quoted, reads: "I make no request, but only a suggestion, which, it seems to me, would be useful, if objections do not exist of which you may be aware, though not perceived by me on first thought."
