LEXINGTON, KY., February 9, 1865. (Received 12 m. 10th.)

His Excellency A. LINCOLN,

President of United States:

We have been a true people to the Union cause. Are we to be sold to Governor Bramlette and the copperheads of Kentucky? If so, let the Union party know, so we can find a place of safety. General Burbridge is our leader, and we will not be led by Bramlette. The withholding of Burbridge's order in regard to State troops is a complete victory for copperheads and rebels over that party who spent their money for you re-election, and the success of our party now depends on you in Kentucky. If Burbridge be sustained, the Union party will be triumphant. If not, the copperheads will triumph, and Kentucky is gone forever, and who will be to blame?

C. T. WORLEY.

J. S. BUTLER,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

Guerrillas completely used up this morning in vicinity of Hustonville. Killed a number of them, captured thirty-five horses, nd scattered them barefooted through the woods. Troops hunting them down. Combinations worked well. Send this information to Captain Brownlee immediately.

E. H. HOBSON,

Brigadier-General.

LEBANON, KY., February 9, 1865.

Captain J. S. BUTLER,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

I want to be commandant of post or have nothing to do with it. As it is now, things conflict. I sent to Captain Horton to send a guard to fix wire between there and Lebanon. He would not do it. I have no men. I think it would be better to have these three companies of my command here. Then I could do something with them. They are too far apart to do anything.

MAHONEY,

Major.
