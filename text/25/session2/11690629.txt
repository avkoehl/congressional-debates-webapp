principles of equality, and should be paid by all in a medium
of equal value It is in conformity to this principle of equal
justice that youi Constitution requires your taxes tobe uniform
throughout the United Stales
But this docs not prove that you cannot receive bank notes in
payment of those taxes, it only proves that, if received, you
must see that such as you do receive in one place are equally
valuable with ihose received manothei, an equality of value
which I shall piesentiy attempt to show does not and will nor,
exist, even mvour gold and silver coin itself, at diffficnt pomis,
utiles you perfoini what I consider one of youi mostimpoi
tant duties, namely, to regulate the cunencyand exchanges of
'   the country    But the Senatoi argues that if bank notes are íe
ceived, the Government might, upon the same pnnciple, select
tobacco as a medium of payment   ta itself, and thence deduce
the light to regulate that staple in various ways     They could
not, undei that pretence, claim the right to íegulate the article

Uoi over, nov regulate, m any   way, that which the producéis
might see fit to dispose of o hetwise, and so fai from being
alai med at the suggestion that (¡.oveinment might make tobacco
the medium for the payment oi th«   public dues, I am disposed
to think the planters in Matyland (to whom the payment of
taxes in tobacco is not a new idea) would ha\ e no soi t of objec

that it is the impeidtive duty of this Go\ eminent to see that
the countiy is provided with a cuuency, sound, bire, anil well
legulated This obligation, 01 duty, on the paitof the Go\era

now easily be restored to the condition of convertibility into
com, at the pleasure of the holder, and a near approximation to
umlormity soon follows    To complete the woik, domestic ex-
changes must be regulated, and to this the local banks are not
and cannot be made fully competent   Again  it has been ar-
gued, and especially by the Senatoi from North Carolina, |Mr
SrRANGEj that taxes aie required by the Constitution to be uni-
form, and hence he draws conclusions m favor of the passage
of this biiland a putely metallic currency.   It is with this as
with several other of the constitutional positions assumed on the
other side    Far from furnishing an argument in their favor, it
fortifier oui Mews of the question, and illustrates the utter m
compatibility with the genius, power*, and duties of this Go-
vernment, of the measures now proposed, and the lesults to
which they inevitably lead   The bill contemplates the ultimate
íeceipt ofno'hing but gold and silver coin in payment of public
dues, and leaving the paper currency of the country to time,
chance, and accident    Thepapei of the banks, then, mav con
tinueto circulate, at variously depreciated rates, in dilTeient
quarters, as chance or accident may direct, s© long as it coflti
nups inconvertible, there will be no com in cnculation with it
Com, used 01 bousht and sold in the market, as bullion, will be,
hkeothei mercantile commodities, subject to the usual fluclua
tion= of puce, occasioned by the relations existing at the «me
and place,between demand and supply     Thtie being none in
circulation nsmoney, the Government debtoi will have to go
intothe maiketwhenevei a payment to Government is tobe
made to pinchare, atwhatpvei pnceit is tobe obtained, (most
probably ata price suddenly advanced in consequence, if his
payment is laige of the demand created by his own wanie )
the amount of dolíais he has to pay    And thus it may, and
will happen, that on the same day one debtor to Government
will be compelled to pay twpnty five percent more for a given
amount due to Government, in one quarter ofthecountiy, than
his fellow deb'oi wi!1 have to p?y for the same amount in ano
ther    This will be an admirable specimen of the uniformity of
taxation *                                                                      ,,1,1
But suppose the othei effect is produced by the bill, of which
I shall speak presently, namely, the destruction ©fall banks, and
that you have apurely metallic cuuency only will yourtaxes
then be collected in a medium of uniform value? Wiil not that
unifoimity be destioyed by the unsettled and ever varying rates
of exchange? and the inequality be exactly in proportion as the
rate of exchange with othei quarteis of thecountry is favorable
or othoi wise to the place where payment is made1? So, in neithei
e\ ent can this lequisition of tht Constitution be complied with,
if the measme p'opnqpd is adopted
Again it is made by th" Constitution the duty 01 this Go-
vernment "toieguUte commeice with ioieign rations, and

-trdmtnt*bi curving it on, the medium of exchange and pay-
ment, be of uniform value? Why we.e the tstues foibidden
by the Constitution to pa«s tender laws, or -ny !a*s impairing
the obligation ofcontiacts, butthatsuchacteon their part might
