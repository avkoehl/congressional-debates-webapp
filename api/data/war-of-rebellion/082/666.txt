HEADQUARTERS SECOND DIVISION, NINTH ARMY CORPS, July 30, 1864.

General A. E. BURNSIDE,Ninth Army Corps:

GENERAL: My division is about advancing again, but my opinion is that unless a very spirited attack is made to the right we shall not accomplish anything. I understand that a part of General Willcox's division will either support the attack or participate in it, which may insure success, but my opinion that the attack should be pressed to the right is concurred in by all the officers of experience who have been on the ground. The present position of our troops has nothing to do with an attack to the right, and in no way interferes with any other troops. General Griffin is 100 yards beyond the crater and not in it. Colonel Bliss is on his right. I have no regiments in any of our old line of pits or intrenchments except an engineer regiment in the edge of the woods.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

ROBERT B. POTTER,

Brigadier-General.

N. B.-Colonel Bliss' attack to the right was repulsed, his force being too light.
