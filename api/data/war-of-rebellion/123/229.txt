His Excellency CHARLES S. OLDEN,

Governor of New Jersey:

SIR: Your letter of July 3, 1862, to the President, making certain suggestions in reference to rasing volunteers, has been referred to this Department. The month's pay in advance could no doubt be paid at the time of enlistment with great advantage to the recruiting serve in many cases, but the law authorizing it requires it to be paid when the company is mustered into the service of the United States, leaving no discretion with the Department as to the time of payment. Your other suggestions will be carefully considered by the Department in its action on the subjects to which they refer.
