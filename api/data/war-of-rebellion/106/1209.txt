COLONEL: Your letter of the 20th has just been received. I agree with you fully as to the necessity of troops and have telegraphed to Major-General McDowell on the subject. Inclosed you will please find a copy of his reply, which I have just received. * I think he is as much in the dark as to the future as any of us. I hope you will be able to so arrange it that an expedition can be fitted out at Eugene City to go into the Indian country, via Diamond Peak. The opening and defense of that route is of vast importance to the citizens of Willamette Valley and Boise.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
