or for four years and a quarter nearly seven
hundred million dollars, for which we are pay-
ing gold and our securities. How long shall
this continue? Just so long as a system of
inflated and irredeemable currency continues.
When we reflect that our population is increas-
ing very rapidly while our gold circulating
medium is constantly decreasing, it is truly
alarming. Add to thisthe United States stocks,
being sent to Europe, and we may well be
startled and look to the ultimate result with
great anxiety and apprehension. Upon the
Pacific slope where the products of the coun-
try have been kept at a gold standard, they
have been enabled to ship a larger amount of
grain by half, according to their population,
than the Atlantic slope, thereby retaining to a
great extent their gold at home. Large amounts
of gold are now accumulating in their vaults.
This, in a great measure, would have been the
resulton the Atlantic.if you could have retained
your gold standard. True, the currency would
have gone up and down according to circum-
stances, whereas all the products of the coun-
try would have retained a fixed gold value and
been exported instead of the gold. You would
not have estimated your values upon an inflated
currency, thereby deceiving yourselves and
cheating yourselves out of this immense amount
of gold that has been flowing like the Gulf
stream, touching, like it, upon your shore, then
swept along in the resistless current until it is
deposited in a foreign land.
How, then, shall we guide the flow of the
golden current to our own country, so that it
will remain within the bosom of our Common-
wealth? Only by a fixed gold standard. We
regard ourselves as the greatest wheat-pro-
ducing country in the world, and yet Russia
exports to England forty per cent., Prussia
nineteen per cent., and America only ten per
cent.
The following comparative table shows the

ment of navigation to and including the 22d of

It will be observed from the above table that
our products are rather decreasing than in-
creasing at tide water, the great channel through
which our exports go to reach the sea, and our
exports must decrease while our imports are
nearly or quite as heavy as usual. Why should
this be_ the case? Our country certainly is
equal in its capacity for production to any
other; and therefore anything we can do to
cheapen our products will tend to greater ex-
portation and greater saving of gold and silver,
ll'.c samerulelikewiseapplies to cotton and also
the kind of heavy cotton goods exported to the
China market. \\ hatever will tend to cheapen
their production will tend to retain our gold
and silver in the country and cause it to flow
toward the Atlantic. Other examples and
statistics might be cited to show the import-
ance of bringing our currency back to a specie
basis. A continued inflation will only tend to
make our financial affairs still more uncertain
as time progresses, and when the crisis does
come it will be wide spread and ruinous. Let
us check ourselves while there is yet time.
The following table from the Bureau of Sta-
tistics will show the amount of cotton exported
since and including 1856:
Gold Value.
1856  $128,300,000
1S57   131,500,000
1858   131,300,000
1859   161,400,000
186 0  191,800,000
1S61  34,000,1100
1S02  1,000,000
186 3  4,800,000
186 4  6,300,000
1803  3,300,000
1866, (thirty cents per pound,)  199,500,000
1867, (twenty-one and three fourth cents
per pound  143,900,000
You will observe that the amount of mer-
chandise exported in 1806 was $329,908,8:30,
of which the cotton exported was $199,500,000,
leaving for all other products, aside from gold
and United States stocks, only $130,408,830.
For the year 18G7 we exported merchandise,
$279,357,732. Deduct cotton exportedâ€”
$143,900,000; leaving for all other products,
aside from gold and United States stocks,
$135,457,732. The price of cotton in 1806
averaged thirty cents per pound, gold; in 1807,
twenty-one and three fourth cents per pound,
gold. For the fiscal year 1808 I estimate
the price in gold to average twelve and a half
cents per pound. If we add one fourth to the
quantity exported last year, and estimate that
to be the export for the fiscal year ending June
30, 1868, it will yield us in gold $90,120,436.
Therefore I do not look to so large an export
as the honorable Senator from Vermont, [Mr.
Morrill.] I think as heretofore our balances
will be paid in gold and United States stocks,
leaving us further from specie payment at the
end of the fiscal year 1868 than we were at
the end of this fiscal year.
If we would build our foundation strong
and permanent we must commence to clear
away the rubbish, remove the shifting sands,
and dig until we strike the bed rock of specie.
Build upon that rock, issue your paper currency
upon that, let it be little or much, so that the
people can see that there is a paper currency
that will draw gold whenever presented. Thi3
will be something; it will be a commencement.
Putting off the day only makes our destruction
the more sure. How easy it is to quiet the
clamor of drunken men if you will only listen
to their intreaties for more poison! Is that
any reason why we should give it them, when
we know it is slowly but the more surely lead-
ing them on to destruction? Sir, the nation is
intoxicated 1 Shall we continue to give them
financial poison or say stop until they return
to reason?
In what do we pay the balance against us?
It is paid in gold or United States stocks.
What will be the result when the gold and
United States stocks are all exhausted? Can
we then resume specie payment? I think
not. As a war measure the Government had
a right to issue its notes, and make them tem-
porarily a legal tender for the purposes of car-
rying on the war; but it cannot be with truth
assumed that it was the intention of the Gov-
ernment to substitute this species of currency
so as to supersede entirely an international
currency, a currency so long recognized by our
own country, and the only kind of currency
regarded as money by the other great commer-
cial nations with whom we deal. If it had
been so contemplated Congress would not have
made a distinction in the currency by making
the duties on imports payable in gold. It was
only intended as a measure of temporary ne-
cessity, and it was undoubtedly the intention
of the Government to return to specie at
the earliest practicable moment. While the
present state of depreciated currency exists
none but unsound, unwise, and venturesome
traders will invest their money in the products
of the country for the purpose of export, with
the prospect of finding when they return to
our market that what they have brought in
return will not bring them as much in gold as
the cargo with which they started, in conse-
quence of the depreciation of our currency.
Therefore it is a great himlerance and draw-
back to the increase of our commercial and
shipping interests. This legal-tender currency
acts, with the consequent cost of exchanging
; gold for legal tenders and legal tenders for
gold, as a protective tariff to foreign countries.
It enhances the price of every kind of product
to such an extent as almost to preclude our
competition with them.
To expect a continued expansion until every
private speculator disposes of his stock, and
until every one disposes of his goods on hand
that have cost him too high in consequence of
a depreciated currency, would be simply ruin-
ous. Each imagines he is losing money. The
whole trouble lies in the fact that he has esti-
mated legal-tender notes as money, whereas
they are only a promise to pay at a convenient
: season, and when he sells those for real money,
gold, he finds the legal-tender stock on hand,
like his other notes and accounts, will not bring
dollar for dollar, and that he must look to his
large profits incidental to an inflated currency
to supply the deficiency, as lie does to his profits
on goods to meet his losses on bad accounts.
The stringency of the times compared with
the time when there was a much larger amount
of currency in circulation must be attributed
to some extent to a transition from an inflated
to a sound gold basis, and to a greater extent
- to the speculation and over-trading of the com-
I munity incident to the plethoric currency that
; has existed for the few years past. Previous
J to the war we were not able to prevent this over-
trading and the results that ensued; neither
can we do it now unless we continue to blow
up the bubble of our currency and expand it
to suit popular clamor, and if we do so it is
only a question of time how long it will float
or how soon it will burst and fall to the ground.
Therefore, I appeal to your good judgment
to look beyond the present, look to the future,
to the permanent and abiding prosperity of
this great and powerful nation. Let not other
; nations sap the foundation from beneath our
feet while we sleep in fancied security upon our
beds of greenbacks ; while they, with the cun-
ning of a Shylock, are giving us all the rope
' we ask, hoping that one day we shall hang
ourselves. For every seventy-five cents of gold
obtained we are giving one dollar, and one day
we or our descendants must pay the full amount
of them; and I say let them be paid in full,
but let us give as few more obligations as pos-
sible, unless dollar for dollar is paid us in gold.
The exact amouut of United States stocks
and gold coin together exported each year
cannot be less than $150,000,000 over and
above our imports.
I have had the honor to submit to the Sen-
ate a bill which I desire to hav.; referred with
the pending measure to the Committee on
Finance. It is Senate bill No. 154, to provide
for the issue of gold notes in place of legal-
tender notes and to facilitate resumption of
specie payment. It is intended as a first step,
to be followed indue time by others. The plan
proposed, if adopted, will act as a check upon
itself and upon the people. If they over-trade
and do not produce sufficient to pay the balance
of exchange in some other product than gold
and United States stocks they will feel the
stringency. If they do produce and export
sufficient to pay the balance of trade against
us, then gold will increase in our vaults, and
gold bills and bank bills will become more
abundant, and general prosperity and renewed
I confidence will be placed upon a firm and sub-
i stantial foundation.
| Upon the question of bank currency I have
to remark that the Government of the United
I States in time of peace has no right to take
I the interest-bearing bonds of the banks and
give in lieu therefor its notes irredeemable and
payable at no stated time and based upon no
system of international currency, and bearing
no interest. How did the men of capital, the
laborers, the manufacturers, the widows and
i orphans composing these bank associations
