FORT ANDERSON, April 11, 1862.

First Lieutenant JOHN HANNA, Jr.,

Actg. Asst. Adjt. General, Humboldt Military District:

SIR: I am informed that the Hoopa Indians are without doubt friendly and quiet toward the whites, so much so that they are anxiously inquiring whether or not they would be permitted to help the osldiers in bringing the Mad River [Indians] to punishment. There can be no doubt but they (the Hoopas) know well where to find the Mad River Indians. You will therefore lay this before the colonel commanding Humboldt Military District, as the object in view is to obtain his permision to bring five or six Hoopa Indians to this post for the purpose of hunting up the Mad River Indians. At present they have sent me word that any number I would wish or send for, for that purpose, would come here without delay. I would have to furnish them with rations; that would be all the expense. I desire an early answer to this.

I have the honor to be, your obedient servant,

C. D. DOUGLAS,

Captain, Second Infty. California Vols., Commanding at Anderson.
