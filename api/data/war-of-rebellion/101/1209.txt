recent removal of cavalry leaves some of the posts deficient in horses for proper defensive purposes, and I respectfully urge that there be no failure in re-supplying them. Every man leaves fully equipped ready for the field. The trains, ordnance, &amp;c., are also complete and ready for orders on landing from the transports.

Very respectfully, yours,

J. J. REYNOLDS,

Major-General, Commanding.
