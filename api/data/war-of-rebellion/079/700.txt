SMITH, Telegraph Manager, Atlanta, Ga.:

Programme has not changed. Shift the men you don't want to go along back by last train, whose time of leaving ask General Easton about, showing him this. After that leave the line for the enemy to break, as we want it until the last moment. The little amount of material you will thus abandon is of no consequence. Will want along four cipher operators, viz, Eddy, Howards; one with Slocum, and one with Kilpatrick.

TYLER, Louisville, Ky.:

Dispatch me to-morrow night and the next night a summary of all news, especially of elections, that I may report it to Governor Brown, at Milledgeville, where I expect a friendly interview in a few days. Keep this very secret, for the world will lose slight of me shortly, and you will hear worse store is than when I went to Meridian. Jeff. Davis' thirty days are up for wiping us out, and we are not wiped out yet by a good deal. Ewing reached here to-day. All well.
