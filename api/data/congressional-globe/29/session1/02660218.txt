THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
Jan. 17;
conventions of our Government. He knew nothing
of the precedents which had been alluded to; but
there seemed to him to be some principle of com-
mon justice, and some pimciple of the relations be-
tween the citizens of this G ovcriiment, that should
determine this question. He agreed with the gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. J. R- Ingebsoll]
that the Government was bound to yield plenary
protection. What was this protection in case of
spoliations ? It was to recover the money, and to
place the citizen, as nearly as could be, in the posi-
tion which he occupied before the loss was sustain-
ed. Ilencc, their ships having been taken by the
enemy, he argued that the recompense for them
should be placed in the hands of the claimants, ,
without expense to them. But more especially i!
should this be. done, as the indemnities received i|
were never ftilly equal to the losses sustained. It .j
was not the duty of the Attorney General to make j1
this adjudication and distribution; and if this addi- j j
tional duty was imposed upon him, common jus- I,
tice required that he should be paid for it. While 1
on this point, he would mention what he had just i
been informed by the chairman ot the Committee
on Foreign Affairs, that thete was a large amount .
of interest accruing upon this money,which u ould ij
be ail amount fully equal to the expenses of dish i- /
bution. In reference to the ease presented as analo- ,.
gous, of the payment or non-payment ot eosis by ||
parties litigant "in courts of justice, he said thai in i
his State, upon the unsuccessful party in the case
was devolved the payment of the costs; and he !,
urged the impropriety of these claimants, whose |j
claims were ascertained and found good to their |j
full extent, in e.ontiemersion of this principle, lie- ;
ing obliged to pay the costs. Ho further urged the j!
piopnety, the economy, and the justice of tile ad- |i
judication and distribution being made by the At-
t aney General, and of his being compensated from ;
the treasury, as proposed by the bill. ;
Mr. G. W. JOXKS, refetring to the statement ;
of his colleague, Mr. E\riNo,thar such motions as
the rjresent were generally made for "buncombe,
nit hough he acquitted him (Mr. J.) as well as the
grulleuni) from Alabama [Mr. HousroxJ of any ;
such motives, said, for himself he could sat, du- ;
n,v his whole public course lie had never made a t
inauoti, nor altempted to make a speech, for what ,
wis wncrally understood by the term " liiin-:
combe-." ami such a thing as this never had been,
aid he thought it never would be used by mm in
political canvasses, lie had made the motion be- .
c.mse lie believed it was naht—right on principle,
r>ht on economical grounds. Bui it would be tor-
timate for that " Puucombe," if all then; pimbc scr- j;
vmts were as much devoted to the iiitmrsts of ,
"Buncombe" after they had received the coiili-;,
den-e of "Buncombe," asthry professed to be tie-
fore that confidence hadbeenbestowod u].on them. j
Mr. J. further briefly sustained the amendment ,
he had made, in reply to AJr. C. J. lxuBHbOi.i.. Mr. i,
ittiETT, and other gentlemen, dissenting from the j
position that the Government was not entitled to
the time of the Attorney Oiieial, argt.mg that:;
tlic.se su vices should be performed by htm, m case >,
his other duties permuted, without speeibe com-
pensotion; that, if his compensation was not suiti- ^
cient, his regular salary should bo increased^ and ^
ridicuiins the idea that this officer w as autbow.ei , ;!
in account current with the (,'eneral Government ,
to charge for every individual act performed which .
V.MS not specifically mHwdtd in the pun tew ol ms
duties a\ben the uii.ee was created.
Mr HOUSTON said he had not intended to
trouble the committee with any additional obser-
vations but for the remarks which had iallen fiom
others, to which he would very bncfly reply. Uc
said his honorable tiiend from Pennsylvania [Mr.
J. R. Ixgersoli.] had indirectly chaiged upon ;
those who opposed this expenditure that they had ,
swallowed a camel, and were now straining at a .
gnat; he could say for his friend, oy way of conso-
lation to him, that such a charire would never be
brought no-ainst him. All who have made them- .
selves at aTl acquatntcd with his legislative history i
would agree very readily m the statement, Jiat he ,
r«r T 1 has never been known to strain at eithei ,
a gnat or a camel; nor would it ill the least strain ,
him to take down both at once. ■,
The gentleman from Tennessee [Mr. Eyra]
had called this a small business, '< too little to .
merit the notice of members. He had heard that ,
often from others; indeed it was the old and fami-
iar argument used by gentlemen when they desire 5
to evade the proper investigation of an expenditure
proposed to be made. It was known to all who
had been long in this House, and to no one better
than yourself, Mr. Chairman, [Mr. Chapman of
i i _ u — u  u« AI,n■  1 tliAt efulfV worn
umu j uui>>cu j « uwoiuuwM — 
Alabama, being in the chair,] that this stale, worn
out crv of " Utile business," was that which was
too often if not always resorted to by mem-
bers whose gigantic minds could not be brought
to see or contemplate a few thousand or ,a '' )v
hundred thousand dollars. This croaking of " ht-
tle bttsiness"—" trifling considerations," for the pur-
pose of ridicule, was the weapon generally used
against reforms proposed by a distinguished mom-
berof the lastCongress from Tennessee, [Mr. v.ave
Johnson,] than whom a more faithful or usetul
member had never had a seat in this Hall. It may
he intended as a sort of shield to those who em-
ploy it; he would tell them it was too shallow;
however efficient it may have been heretofore, it u
