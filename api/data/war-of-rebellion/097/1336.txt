WAR DEPARTMENT, March 25, 1865.

QUARTERMASTER-GENERAL:

For consideration.

The Secretary of War desires to see you to-day in regard to within telegrams. Please return them.

By order, &amp;c.

SAML. W. MELTON,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

[Honorable JOHN C. BRECKINRIDGE,

Secretary of War:]

DEAR SIR: Of course no subsistence should be sent off so long as we can hold the city, and I was not aware that Paymaster Semple contemplated doing so. I have directed him to keep them here. I regret that we cannot turn over further subsistence to the Commissary-General. Our mechanics, who are entitled to subsistence from the army, are receiving nothing and are nearly in astate of starvation, while our supplies do not admit of meeting their wants.

Very respectfully,

S. R. MALLORY,

Secretary of the Navy.
HDQRS. ARTILLERY, ARMY OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA, March 23, 1865.

Lieutenant Colonel R. P. CHEW,Commanding Horse Artillery, Richmond, Va.:

McClanahan must be found and gotten to his place at once. Thomson also must be made ready immediately. I cannot assign horses while the men are scattered. Johnston can have three howitzers in Lynchburg from Colonel Carter. You had better at present be nearer me than in Richmond.

W. N. PENDLETON,

Brigadier-General and Chief of Artillery.
HDQRS. ARTILLERY, ARMY OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA, March 23, 1865.

Captain GREEN,Assistant Quartermaster, late Owen's Artillery Battalion:

CAPTAIN: In reply to your note of this date I would say that if the two companies, Dickenson's and Waler's, going to another connection, can at all dispense with your services for a day or two, I wish you to remain and assist Captain Forbes, assistant quartermaster Braxton's battalion, in establishing his arrangements for his services in a locality new t him and familiar to yourself. Let him have, also, the forage you may have on hand.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. N. PENDLETON,

Brigadier-General and Chief of Artillery.

P. S.-By Monday next you can, if nothing unforeseen occurs to prevent, proceed to your command proper north of James River.

W. N. P.
