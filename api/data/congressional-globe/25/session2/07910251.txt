>IX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL
Making public officers depositaries—Mr. Mien.
Feb. 1838
25th  Co\&"--2nd SbhS.
the Government of their choice, should refuse to j
deliver their present, and to mortgate their future,
revenues to a league of private corporations—to
cerpoiahons -which have already betrayed them,
which have conspired together, seized the public
treasure, and still stand out in barefaced rebellion
against public law, that such should be the honest
obstinacy of the nation 11 resisting these demand*,
is a conduct "unaccountable, monstrous, criminal,"
in the judgment of the Senator from Massachusetts,
fMr. Wi.es ter ]
This Government shall be compelled to receive,
through all coming time, nothing for its revenues
but the due-bills of banks—of banks which have i
refused, in advance, to pay those bills It shall de-
liver the bills, when leceived, back to the verv
'ame banks, as a fund for their private tiaffic It
Uiall levy, for the use of these corporations, an
eveilasung tribute upon the country, and thus re
duce tne people to the mercenary dominion of
banka and bankers. These things must be done
in quiet, and under color of Ian, or, if not so done,
the Senator from Virginia, [Mr. Rives,] foresees
their future lulfillment threugh a breach m he
Constitution, and in the form of a National Bank
Such are the demands, such the forebodings,
such the substitute—a measure, the first principle
and inevitable tendency of which is essentially
revolutionary. It is nothing less than a demand
oí the public revenue, now and for ever, made by
the banks as a political right, and that demand is
pxpressly piedicated upon the assumption, that the
Constitution is theoietically and practically incom-
petent to cflect the ends of Government The
Mib^t tute assumes, and its mover declare5 that
the present cficers, though chosen by the people,
are, and tn^t all other citizens who hereafter may
be chosen by their countrymen to administer the
Government, necessarily must be, too ignorant or
too corrupt to take care of the public revenue.
We are, theretore, required to go beyond the Con-
stitution for agents not selected by, nor responsible
to, the people. And why is this to be done i Why
should not the people be ti jsted to appoint their
own agents to take care of their own money t For,
after all, this is the real, the only question The
question is, vvhj shall exeicise the elective poner
o, hs Go/eminent'2 Shill the pcop", or shall
the b< nk>, appoint the men to be chai sed with our
public affairs I Shall those who hold the public
mtney be ie->ponsible to the public ? To this ques-
tioi, the substitute answeis, that the banks sha'l,
that th« peop'e shall not, eT reisp this powei It
savs to the people, " the banks are mue \ nuous,
moie intelligent than v ou , they will appoint officers
to take care of your money more worthv of \ vur
confidence than any selected by } ourseh es You
raise the revenue by your taxes, but job have no
light to ¡egulate its custody, vou must trust
to the honor of banks-, in which, though they have
once betrayed jou, you must again confide , and
turn your susp'cions upon j our own officers, who,
though elected by j ourselves, and thus far faithful
to their trust, may yet deceive you " Such, sir, is
the language which this substitute speaks to the
people , such is the charge against their integrity,
their virtue and intelligence, such the attack thus
openly made upon the sovereignty of the people—
upon the representative principle, the only prm
ciple which can, for a single hour, sustain this
Government
Thus, sir, we have the grounds of this contest
distinctly marked out Let no man mistake his
position—let none waste his energies upon a delu-
sive issue—let none be beguiled by the deceitful
outside this controversy has assumed—let none
suppose it a mere question oi currency and finance
No it is a struggle, not between two systems of cur-
rency, but between two forms of Government.
Privilege, paper, and oppression, stand arrayed on
the one side, against liberty, labor, and property, on
the other The revolutionary struggle for separa-
tion from the throne of Great Britain, was not more
essentially a strife for independenco and freedom,
than is this to dissolve the connection which ren-
ders the Government basely subject, and the ptople
basely tributary, to the banks In this contest, (I
speak it with a sigh for the weakness of eur nature,)
the contending elements are but too fatally matched
Each power acts with the concentrated energy of
organization. One, the organized Government of
the people, prompted to defence by the love of
liberty, the other, an organized league of monopo-
lies, fired in the assault by the hope of conquest
and the prospect of plunder. Though apparently
temporary, the struggle will be long and arduous,
and, whatsoever may be the result, that result will
blast or confirm the happiness of the present, and
the hopea of many a succeeding, generation
Sir, the events of the last century have wrought
an amazing revolution in the social condition of
man. The sword had ever been the great oppres-
sor and plunderer of the world, but that sanguinary
agent of conquest and crime has now lost most of
its terrors, and physical force yielded to the ascen-
dancy of moral power Human liberty, neverthe-
less, still finds an antagonist, and it remains for
this generation and for this country to determine
whether organized fraud can be made to take the
place of the swoid in the oppression and plunder of
mankind
Our political institutions were framed with refe-
rence to this momentous question, and the maturest
wisdom was exerted to guard them against the in-
trusion of an enemy more dreadful than the sword,
because more subtle in its action, and more intense
m its grasp. The framers of the Constitution
knew that political power was neither more nor
less than the control of one man over another,
that, amidst the necessities of human lite, control
over the labor, the property, and the subsistence of
man, was control over the man himself. They
knew, too, that the natural disparity in the capaci-
ties, energies, and dispositions of men, unaided by
political disci donation , w as msufnc ent to destroy
that equality of condition so essential to the safety
of each, and to the common happiness of all
Upon these high elementary principles the Con-
stitution was based Throughout the w hole frame
of our system, embracing both the State and Fe-
deral Governments, the people are viewed as an
aggregate of individuals equal to each other, not
as an association of classes and orders. Property
is treated as an object of acquisition equally by all,
not as a subject of monopoly or exclusive appropri-
ation b}' any Rights, only, are recognised privi-
leges, discaided The coi ti nuances which in other
countries had been de\ised to c'assify the commu-
nity, and gi aduMe the scale of d pendent orders,
weie rejected as incompatible with civil hbertv
Titles of nobihtj, all the machinery of entails,
p-ipetmties, and pr mogemture, being thus reject-
ed, our ancestors put the Government in motion,
believing, as thev --mceiely did, that man, ard ti e >
proceeds of his toil, weie fore\er secured against
pillage and oppression                                              j
Such, m the beggmning, were our inst tutions— j
such then was the conditio, oí our countn But, '
sir, a power antagen st ¡ ti- sepimcipleswassoon
transp'anted fiom the Bn ish m-marchy into oui
system—apoweiwhieh has silentlv incoiporated
itself with our social econorm, inverted the natu-
ral action of the Government, and now threatens
its tot?lsuo\ersion
Bv common consent, the whole civilized work1
had set apart a particular species of propeitj as
the íepresentative standard of value for all other
propei ty Such were precious metals, gold and
silver, which, after receiving a fixed form and the
stamp of public authority, had, by wav of emi-
nence, beendenommated money When the Consti-
tution was adopted, commeicebad supplied our peo-
ple with an amount o! this money equal to their neces-
sities, and, in addition to this, they had enjoined it
as a duty upon their own Government, to adapt
these metals to the public use, by íeguiating then
form and value This was done and for a time
all was well But, from England, the banking sj s-
tem was transplanted upon our shoies By us
agency, individua'* were enabled to withdraw
from the public use the whole metallic medium,
and to retain it as a monopoly m their on n hands
The means, as well as the privilege, of accom-
plishing this object, were confened as gratuities
by aibitrarv legislation Under these legislative
acts, called charter*, they assumed the inms ot
banks, pioceeded to issue their private credit in
the form of due bills, which being thus made by

law nominally equal to money, went forth to fill
the void left m the community by are withdrawal
of the precious metals
Such was the fatal entrance of th« paper or
banking system upon our soil II came as a. tax-
gatherer from that country to which onr fathers
had refused to pay taxes. It came immediately
after our Rev olntionary war, and its advent was
the beginning of a counter revolution. It came
fraught with monopoly, privilege, and perpetuity—
principles m direct hostility te those upon which
this Government stands
And thus, sit, whilst the Constitution requires
Congress to coin metallic money for the u*-e of the
country, and to regulate its value, the banks are
authorized to annul the action of the Government,
by withdrawing that money from the people, and
substituting in its stead a paper medium, whose
value it is impossible to regulate Every citizen
has a constitutional right to demand gold and sil-
ver in payment of his debts, because the Govern-
ment is bound to com these meta's for the debtor,
yet the banks have made it impracticable for the
creditor to exact, or for the debtor to pay, any thing
but paper The Constitution seeks to secure the
people against taxation, except with their own con-
sent, for the use of Government, and in proportion
to their representative influence, but the paper sys-
tem levies an enormous tax upon them against
their will, in unequal pioportions, and for the ex-
clusive benefit of the banks All perpetuities are
forbidden, yet moneyed corporations have arisen
among us, with power to renew and perpetuate
themselves by the threat of public rum as ihe pe-
nalty of their discontinuance Privileged monopo-
lies, tending to enrich the few to the oppression of
in  man}, b> desirovmg ihe co-equal distribution
o* labor and its proceeds, ne'e carefully excluded
from our political 3 stem, but, notwithstanding this,
companies have been chartered with authority to
monopolize that species of property called metallic
money—th« only property which the Government
is required to prepare for the use of the people—
property with which they cannot dispense, and with
the monopoly of which th^se corporations are ena-
bled to control all other property, and the labor of
the whole people And thus, though the Constitu-
tion secures to the citizen his property inviolate, so
that its quantity cannot be diminished bnt for tre
public use, and upon the pav ment of an equiva-
lent, the banks are permitted to dimmish, at will,
the value of every man's lands and goods, by vary-
írg the amount of their discounts
These things, deeply and v-itallv affecting the
well being, the very subsistence, of every man m
th° Republ c, 'he banks aie permit ed to transact,
not m the v holesome presence of the peopie, not
n the light of da>, but m darkness and in secret,
between the walls ot subterraneous caverns. And
this ts allowed in a country whose constitution and
law scarry responsibility along with every act of
power that mav, in any degree, affect the public
interests, subject the conduct of the most suborci1-
nate officer to the general scrutm}, and inflict penal
justice upon everv delinquent.
Sir the pu  leges thus conferred upon these
combinations of men called banks—the privilege
of monopo! zmg the w hole traffic in the precious
metals—of withdrawing those metals from the use
of the public—01 issuing their die bills as the sole
currency ot the coumrv—bills which are but the
counterfeit of the monev tbey purport to represent—
b lis which, for the most part, constitute a species
oi credit founded, not like that of individuals, upon
actual property, but upon an arbitrar} credit, cre-
ated by acts of arbitrary legislation, and forced
upon the people as tne representative of things that
do rot exist—the privilege ot monopolizing the
faculty of Joamng monev—ot loaning their credit
as money—of compelling everv citizen to exchange
his for their credit, with a piemium for the ex-
ch?nge—of increasing and diminishing their leans
at pleasure, without nuttce to the community
These might) pn« ilegts concentrate a mass of
power, such as never existed m any other country,
and never can be concentiated m any other form
than that of th? papti system Such a system
must forever act with a tenfold force upon the peo-
ple of a fiee Government   because such a Govern-
