ment will be used by the generals present to operate against the enemy on or near Lawrenceburg. This is only temporary. The general wishers if you cannot enter and cross at Frankfort that you will find some ford above Frankfort and cross the river, recapture the enemy's train, and harass the enemy's rear. The general thinks you have a fine opportunity for cutting him up.

Brigadier General JONES M. WITHERS, Commanding, &amp;c.:

GENERAL: It is removed the enemy have left Frankfort. Colonel Taylor is ordered back to your support. It is highly important that you should hold Lawrenceburg, in order to cover the crossing of General Heth's and Stevenson's commands, which will reach Lawrenceburg to-night. Their forces will number 18,000 men.

By command of Major-General Smith:

JNumbers PEGRAM,

Chief of Staff.

P. S.-It is reported the enemy are at Lawrenceburg, but General Stevenson will still push on there even if he has to force the passage of the river. Therefore check the enemy as long as you can, and we may gain a very complete victory over him by our attacking him in flank or rear while you attack in front. Our guns will probably not be heard until to-morrow morning unless the passage is disputed this afternoon, but we will try to reach there this afternoon via Lawrenceburg.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,
