NASHVILLE, TENN., November 2, 1864-10 a. m.

Major-General STEEDMAN,

Chattanooga:

Major-General Schofield has just informed me that General Sherman has authorized him to leave the present garrison at Resaca, bringing all his command with him to Pulaski. I have directed General Schofield to leave one brigade of his escape of his corps to garrison Resaca. You must send to the Fourteenth, Twentieth, Fifteenth, and Seventeenth Corps at the front the drafted men and recruits assigned to those corps, under the officers belonging to the same, as soon as you possibly can, and if you are still required to make up the garrison of Resaca you might send a force from the organization of convalescents now being made up by General Cruft at Chattanooga.
