spirits of the gallant dead who now lie beneath the batteries of Corinth see and judge the motives of men they do not rebuke me, for there is no sting in my conscience, nor does retrospection admonish me of error or of a reckless disregard of their valued lives.

Very respectfully, sir, I am, your obedient servant,

EARL VAN DORN,
