RELIEF OF CITIZENS OF ARKANSAS.
The bill for the relief of citizens of Arkansas
who lost their improvements in consequence of a
treaty with the Choctaw Indians, was taken up
An amendment reported fiom the committee to
this bill, and also one offered by Mr HARDIN,
were adopted
Mr VINTON opposed the passage of the bill
He considered it tantamount to giving a reward
for the violation of the laws
Mr SEVIER (the Delegate from Arkansas)
defended the justice of the provisions of the bill
with great animation He contended that those
who remained upon their lands in defiance of the
orders of the Govei nment had been paid, while to
those who obeyed, and went off, this just remu-
neiation was denied The Government had taken
these improvements and transferred them for a
valuable consideration Its refusal to pay the
claims of those citizens, he could look upon as but
little better than highway robbery. If ever there
was a claim which appealed most strikingly to the
justice of the House, he conceived this to be the
one He dwelt on the ments of those individuals
who act as the pioneers in the settlement of our
frontiers, denominated squatters There were many
of them his particular friends 1 he bill was de-
signed to render them sheer justice, and he hoped
it would be passed
Mr BURGES said he knew the sportive feel-
ings of the gentleman from Arkansas, or he should
regret to hear any action of the Government com-
pared to highway robbery, but that gentleman
defended the system of " squatting"—(a by word,
by the way, which had obtained currency here,
but which he did not remember to have evei used
before)—as meritorious, and as having been re-
warded by the grant of lands fiom the early days
of the Government It was very true, when the
savages hung upon our fronueis like a cloud—
when the war whoop resounded, and the toma-
hawk and scalping knife were drinking the blood
of their victims, we did give the public lands to all
those who put their lives in their hands and acted
as pioneers in opening the wilderness to our citi-
zens But now, in profound peace, when the
danger fiom the savages was gone by, and the
settler had nothing to do but to take up the public
pioperty at the public expense, the case was widely
different He understood that some of these set-
tlers had made large improvements—large cotton
ilantations, &,<• , because there was no obstruction
to tneir settlement Would the gentleman pretend
to compare th^se men with the hardy pioneers of
the West, who planted and defended their habita-
tions in pei il> He considered the bill altogether
ti e most singular that had evei been presented.
He denied the justice of the claims which ltcoun-
tenanced
Messrs EWING and ASHLEY addressed the
House in favor of the b II
Mr  HARD1JN  proposed another amendment,
by adding to one of the piovisions of the bill the 
woidij, " which is, by law, subject to entry "
Mr MASON stated the views which influenced
thecommitlee to report the bill, and advocated, at
some length, Ks pa sfige
Mr V1N TON again rose, and seated the objec-
tions he entertained to the-bill The persons here
proposed to be indemnified had gone on to the
publ c lands without the sanction or color of law,
and in dnect violation of law The lands in ques-
t on had never been authorized to be sold or settled
If the principle sanctioned in the bill was to ootain,
the Government had better give up the public
domain entirely, as it was no longer sa'e in its
custody
Mr BURGES said he ag-eed with the gentle-
man from Ohio, [Mr Vinton ] thet if the princi-
ples of this bill were to be sanctioned, we had
better abandon the public lands altogether We
had subdued the natives who were its true and
original owners They had been driven across
the great river of the West They had gone to-
wards the setting sun, and would reach the happy
isles of the creed of then fathers before we could
render them justice It was high time, he thought,
for this Government to compel some respect for
the rules of moral honesty—that the nubhc lands
might be viewed as other rroperty, and depreda-
tions commuted on it punished in like manner
One of the gentlemen had told us that he repre-
