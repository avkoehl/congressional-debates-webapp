SUFFOLK, March 12, 1863.

Major-General DIX:

Certain letters have this moment reached me to the effect that an attack upon Suffolk is to be made. One is from the signal officer of Norfolk. In it he says that every preparation is being made at Franklin to render the affair successful. The information he regards as from good sources.

Some person who has run the blockade gives it as the current report in Richmond.

JOHN J. PECK,

Major-General.

SUFFOLK, March 12, 1863.

Major-General DIX:

The reported increase on Blackwater has resulted from the movement of troops into your department. My impression has been that they were watching our moves. Longstreet's position with supports near Petersburg wears a threatening appearance, and may form the basis of the reports from Norfolk.

JOHN J. PECK,

Major-General.

FORT MONROE, March 12, 1863.

Major-General PECK,

Commanding at Suffolk:

In view of reports you mention I shall send you 5,000 men, probably 2,000 to-morrow, from Newport News.

JOHN A. DIX,

Major-General.

SUFFOLK, March 12, 1863.

Colonel Stetzel is 9 miles below Gatesville. Reports an attack by guerrillas some days ago, who were driven off by the troops and gunboat.

FORT MONROE, VA.,

March 13, 1863-11 a. m.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief U. S. Army:

General Longstreet is in command of the forces at Richmond and on the Blackwater, in place of General Gustavus W. Smith, resigned. In view of the large re-enforcements on the Blackwater I have ordered Getty's division of the Ninth Army Corps to Suffolk. The rest are at Newport News.

JOHN A. DIX,

Major-General, Commanding.
