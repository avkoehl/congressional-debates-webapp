has refused in every instance, although greatly superior in numbers, to stand. This confirms my opinion that the rebel parties have been constantly hovering near us the last few days, and citizens and deserters say they were to concentrate near this on Saturday, but a rush against their parties in detail prevented them doing so in force. Shall Colonel Board's cavalry march to Murfreesborough os ordered?

TULLAHOMA, July 22, 1862.

Colonel J. B. FRY:

I have information this morning, which I consider reliable, as it comes form several independent sources and from our own scouts and several Union citizens, that Forrest started from the neighborhood of McMinnville for Lebanon on Friday with 1,000 men. He was to have been back on Saturday; has not returned. A train took the Twenty-first Kentucky to Murfreesborough. This finishes the movement of troops ordered form this to that point. One of the trains is ordered to carry through the telegraph party, making repairs as they go.

Brigadier-General.

TULLAHOMA, July 22, 1862.

Colonel J. B. FRY:

One of my scouting parties last night captured a morning report of a rebel force encamped near McMinnville; it is addressed to General Forrest, Chapel Hill, which you will perceive lies between Shelbyville and Franklin. The rebel has not had time to advise him of its capture. Cannot we catch him there of Shelbyville, where I think his army is.

Have 100,000 rations sent by rail to-morrow from Murfreesborough to Stevenson. Show this order to General Nelson. Be cautious in this.
