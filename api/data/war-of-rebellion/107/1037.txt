evinced entitle them to promotion. The vacancies made by the death of Major-General Berry and Brigadier-General Whipple should, I respectfully suggest, be filled by promotions from the troops of the same army corps, considering that promotions have been so nobly earned in this corps. I earnestly solicit for these recommendations the notice of the general-in-chief of this army, in order that the service may have all the advantage to be derived from judicious and discriminating promotions, and the value of these, it may be superfluous to add, is doubled when they are promptly conferred.

I am, general, your most obedient servant,

D. E. SICKLES,

Major-General, Commanding.

Brigadier-General ROBERTS,

Clarksburg:

Very little indeed. Perhaps the Fourteenth Pennsylvania Cavalry and a small re-enforcement of cavalry. But I doubt the enemy's design to return to Grafton or Clarksburg. He is perhaps maneuvering for the railroad beyond you, Parkersburg and the Kanawha. Hooker is understood to be going on gloriously.*

Brigadier-General STANNARD,

It is important to hold Rappahhanock Station. You will therefore order a regiment from Union Mills to hold that front and the railroad in its rear. You will apply immediately for transportation by railroad. Please acknowledge receit of this.

By order of General Abercrombie:

You will bring back your forces from Edenburg and Woodstock. A portion of your command must be sent to the relief of General Roberts. Let the Ninth and Tenth Regiments Virginia Infantry be held ready for immediate movement to Martinsburg.
