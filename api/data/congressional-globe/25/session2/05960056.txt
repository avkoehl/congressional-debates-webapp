bank' That would not be allowed, and must then
be stricken oft the roll' What must he do 2 What
sentiments must he hold] Must he go with the
member from South Carolina (Mr. Calhoun) m
every thing, and, if he did not submit, was he to
be considered an Abolitionist? Mr. C only made
these remarks to show to Mr Calhoun, if it were
possible, the extreme indiscretion of the tone and
line of argument upon which he had thrown him-
salf, the bigoted politics he laiddoun, that eveiy
one must follow him, implicitly, or els>e they were,
by necessity, Abolitionists To say the least, he
thought there was great indiscretion in such a
course, and it was (however it might appear
otherwise to the hasty and hot-headed) seriously
calculated to bring injury upon the cause of the
South, instead of benefit He (Mr C ) was no
more an Abolitionist than Mr Calhoun himself
there were thousands as sound as Mr Calhoun
could be, he might say sounder, who yet were calm
and temperate and quiet. And though he (Mi. C )
was far indeed, as was well enough known, Irom
being an Abolitionist, yet he could not concur in
the extravagant alarms which Mr. Calhoun was
repeatedly sounding in the ears of the Senate. He
could not agree with him in the extravagant ex-
pression of such mental terrors He did not think
the South rumed, the country ruined, all ruined,
every thing ruined, unless he (Mr Caihoun) was
implicitly followed' Fai from it He felt secure,
the country was secure, the South, the Union, all
was secure, behind the firm bamer ol the Constitu-
tion. "We are (said Mr C ) strong in. the Consti-
tution, strong in public opinion, which is on oui
side, strong in the votes which have alwa}¡, been
for our rights and for the Constitution, and, lastly,
we are strongei than all in the strength oí the
States, which are able to piotect themselves.
Mr C said he could see no good whatever as
likely to result from these resolutions He did not
think their language decorous enough as applied to
sovereign State  The States are the -,overeign
elements of this Union, and shall we talk to them
of "intermeddling1" If the States were entitled to
respect from any quarter of this Government, it
was here m the Senate that they ought to meet
with respect He therefore deprecated the use oí
language harsh, offensive, indecorous, and irri-
tating, especially when by such language the object
professed to be aimed at was to unite, to soothe,
and to allay excitement The means loi this were
in direct sontradiction to the end As to the Vt r-
mont resolutions, which these weie especially
framtd to meet, he (Mr C ) would laugh to scorn
the pettish language of -such documents, but he
would not officially treat a sovereign State with
indignity
It was declared (Mr C ) said) that peutions ioi
the abolition of slavery m the District of Columbia
were a direct attack on the institution of slaveij. 111
the States Mr C said this was an abuse ol Ian
guage. If it could be regaided at all as an attack,
it certainly was not an avowed or ducct attack
upon the institution ol slavery in the States, and
he saw no propriety of iv-ing terms of mere exagge-
ration and alarm It the question oí the power of
Congress to abolish slavery in the District was a
controverted one, had not a State a right to peti-
tion on the subject1 And should they undertake to
denounce the conduct ol a sovereign State1
Mr. CALHOUN followed in reply He said
that he was not at all surprised that he and the
Senatorfrom Kentucky should take such very dif-
ferent *views Of the subject We differ totally as
to thefacts^ aad it is not-wonderful that we should
differ as to the remedy 1 With such opinions as"
the Senai&r entertains, all attempts to resist a thing
so imtocerit and harmless is abolition mast appear
perfectly useless He sees no danger 111 the orga-
nization of 150,090 persons into societies, with a
powerful press and ample-funds, imbuing the rising
generation-at the North with the belief that the in-
stitutions of the Southern Stales were sitrful and
immoral-, and that it was- doing God service to-
abolish them, even if it should involve the destruc-
tion of half of thetr inhabitants, -nho are represent-
ed as murderers and pirates It would be in vara
for him to attempt to <hscuss the subject with the
Senator from Kentucky, while he continues to en-

tertain such opinions. But three years since, we
considered thres hundred societies to be a cause of
just apprehension, and now they number 1,500,
and are increasing at the rate of one a day, and the
Senater sees nothing to excite attention To what
extent must the disease progress before he can be
moved' If it should spread universally over the
non-slaveholdmg States, so that the two sections
should consider each other as the most odious of
the human race, could the Union exist? And if
not, he would be glad to know to what point it
must extend befoie it becomes dangerous, and
when we would be justified m resisting it? He
h ould be glad to heai the Senator's answer to this
question
The Senator next objects that these resolutions
are mere abstractions, and therefore worthless.
The Scnatoi could not be ignorant of the rise and
progre&s of the important political revolutions re-
corded in history, and he would appeal to him, it
what he calls abstractions did not lie at the bottom
of most of them Have not almost all of the
revolutions in our paienl country, from Magna
Chaita down to that which placed the piesent royal
family on the thionc, originated in abstract princi-
ples1 Did not 0111 own Revolution originate in ab-
sti actions of the highest order1 We did not wait
foi actual oppiesision to rouse us to resistance, but,
as Burke said, we snuffed the approach of tyranny
m the tainted breeze To come down still latei,
did not the abstract resolutions of his own State,
and that of hei honored mother, strike down at a
blow the alien and sedition acts to the ground, and
effect a levolution which will be felt so long as
up art a prople1 With these striking examples,
can the Senatoi consider abstractions so veiy
woithlcss' The fact is, that it is abstract truths
onij that deeply impress the understanding and the
heart, and effect great and durable revolutions, and
the higher the intelligence of a people, the greater
their influence It h only the ignorant and the
biute creation over whom they hive no control
The Senator next accuses him ol inconsistency
He rests his charge on the asseition that I despair,
and then infers that he (Mi Calhoun) acted incon-
sistently in introducing these resolutions It was
painful to be misrepresented as frequently as he
was in debate He had never uttered the language
of despin, though he had ollen said that the dark
and li II spirit now abroad in the non-slaveholdins
States \w uld end in a catastiophe, if no! anested
If it continued to advance without resistance, it
would teinnnate in disunion or civil commotion
It was unavoidable But he had never said that it
could not be anested, il timely met, and in the de-
cided manner it should be He had also said that
the battle must be fought m the North, or the South
must take the remedy into its on n hands Others
had said tin h,\me, and for using this language, the
Senatoi comes to the conclusion that he despaired,
and on this slendei foundation raises the charge ot
inconsistence In the same spirit, he charges him
a using anqry and violent language, because he
had thought proper to diaw up the íesoluuons m
itrong and decided tcims, and defend them in the
same terms m debate
The Senator next takes offence, because he re-
lied on the State rights parly to oppose the A boh
tionish in the non-slaveholding States, and asks if,
by the State ngnts party, was meant ihe small
party under a ta'tered and lorn banner1 He s,up-
p ised the Senator meant the Nullifying party, and,
if so, he feared it would be a very unequal contest
in the northern States
[Mi   Orittendln explained 1
Mr CALHOUN resumed He used the expres-
sion on another occasion, and in a more restricted
sense, than when he used it on the present
The Senator next inquired what was meant by
the State rights partj He did not expect the in-
quiry from that tjltartei, but, as it was made he
would reply to it He meant the party who be-
lieved that this, was a Federal Republic—a Repub-
lic, the constituent parts oí which «ere States, m
contend stmction to a national consolidated Repub-
lican which the constituent parts werr  die aggre-
gate mas-s- of the American people, taken collec-
tively, and in which the States bore "the same
relation to the whole as counties do to the States.

Senate.
I He is next accused by the Senator with charging
all who were not of the State rights party as being
Abolitionists This has as little foundation as the
other charges of the Senator. So far from making
snch a charge, he expressly stated, again and again,
that he acquitted the great mass of all parties of
abolition, and that he believed that we had the
good wishes of the great body of the national or
consolidated party, and who were ready to vote
that it was inexpedient to touch the subject of sla-
very. But he also stated, when he looked for a
constitutional remedy, he was compelled to turn to
the State rights party, m whose creed only it could
be found If, then, he looked to one party, instead
of both, it was simply because the political creed of
the one furnished a leniedy, and the other did not,
and has not this debate furnished incontestable
proof oí the truth of his assertion1 Others had
taken offence at the same declaiation, and he called
on them to refute what he had asserted, by laying
resolutions on the table framed m their view ot the
Constitution, which would oppose the slightest con-
stitutional barner against the encroachments of the
Abolitionists None had been, and he had a right tq^
infer that none could be But he would rejoice to
have his impressions corrected, if erroneous, and
to have the co-operation of both parties, and would
now call on the Senators who differed from htm on
the federative character of our system, to submit
resolutions, as substitutes for his, that would op-
pose an effectual constitutional barrier to the doc-
trines of the Abolitionists. He was not so much
attached to his own but that he would cheerfully
simender his foi others of equal force.
We are next told by the Senator, that the term
direct is not correctly applied, as an attack on sla-
veiy in this District or the Territories cannot be a
direct attack on slavery in the States He believ-
ed, notwithstanding the objection, that the epithet
could be iairly defended The avowed object of
the Abolitionists, m attacking slavery in this Dis-
trict and the Tt intones, was to attack and destroy
it in the States, and is as much a direct attack as
firing a tiam to blow up a magazine would be an
attack on the maga/ine itself. But as such discus-
sion would lead to metaphysical niceties, lie would,
to accommodate the Senator, agree to strike out
the void, and make it read a dangerous attack on
all the slaveholdmg States, which would not be
much less strong
It is finally objected by the Senator, that the ex-
pievsion ínjpimeddle was disrespectful, when ap
plied to the Slates He did not thimi so It was
used in the general, without designating any State,
and he thought the Senate had not only a i ght to
use it, but were called on by the ciicumstances m
which it was placed, to define its position and de-
clare its opinion, in reference to the interference of
one portion of the Confedeiacy wi'h the peculiar
institutions ot the other It had unquestionably the
light to say what is its conception ol such interfer-
ence, whether it was cons.atent with the Constitu-
tion, with the peace and harmony or existence of
the Union, or not, and no State had a right to con-
sider such declaration as an offence But he was
anxious to modify his r> solutions, as far as pnraae-
ology was cencerned, so as to suit others, and
«ould jield, without hesitation, the woid inter-
meddle, and substitute in its place an) attempt It
would not vaiy the sense, nor weaken the expres-
sion materially, while, he trusted, it would entirely
lemove the objection of the Senator to the resolu-
tion
Mr PRFSTON suggested to the mover to strike
out the words "on the g-i ound or under the pretext
that tí was unmoral e  sinful," and insert "on any
pretext whatever "
Mr C4LH0UN objected to striking out the
words referred to by his colleague, they met the
Abolitionists duectl>, but would accept as a modi-
fication the words he pioposed to add
Mr PRESTON moved further lo insert the
words "also a violation of the public tailh implied
m the cession of this. District by the States of Vir-
ginia and Maryland "       ,
Mr CALHOUN had always, been of the opinion
that any interference with slavery in this District
would not only be a violation of the publtc faith to
the States oí Virginia and Maryland, but would ali
