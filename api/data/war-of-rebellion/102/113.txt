and Matthew Aiken, below Current River, Ripley county, robbed my family in that neighborhood, and are living there at this time. From my own knowledge and the best information I can obtain I think there must be between 3,000 and 4,000 men belonging to the different brigades named above in that part of Arkansas north of Little Rock. These men say, as they said last year, that they will not go, but there can be no doubt but what they will again be forced in, as they were in 1864, and that they will again be forced in, as they were in 1864, and that the contemplated raid will be carried into effect in the month of May, 1865, unless timely checked by Federal troops. I also feel satisfied from what they say that one-half the people of Northeastern Arkansas would assist the Federal troops if sent there for their protection, as if things are allowed to go on as they now do the people must suffer. I would further say that in the estimate of forces as made above none of the troops now with Shelby are included.
