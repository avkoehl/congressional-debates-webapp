HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF WEST TENNESSEE,Memphis, Tenn., March 7, 1865.

Major General N. J. T. DANA,

Commanding Department of Mississippi:

GENERAL: As it is necessary for me to have the use of the spare cavalry there may be here, as I am about to put the railroad in order, I have ordered them to report to me. This, however, will make no difference in regard to their future disposition.

I am, general, your obedient servant,

C. C. WASHBURN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS POST AND DEFENSES OF VICKSBURG,Vicksburg, Miss., March 7, 1865.

Colonel C. T. CHRISTENSEN,

Asst. Adjt. General, Military Division of West Mississippi:

Inclosed please find some rebel papers. General Dana is expected here on next boat. Your bearer of dispatches to General Dana and Mound City passed up yesterday without detention. I suppose the commanding general is aware of the fact that deserters are crossing the river, going west, in large numbers. They are from all organizations, but principally from Hood's army. I advised naval officers to let them cross.

Your obedient servant,

M. L. SMITH,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers.

EXECUTIVE MANSION,

Washington, March 7, 1865-3 p. m.

Major-General POPE,

Saint Louis, Mo.:

Please state briefly by telegraph what you concluded about the assessments in Saint Louis County. Early in the war one Samuel B. Churchill was sent from Saint Louis to Louisville, where I have quite satisfactory evidence that he has not misbehaved; still I am told his property at Saint Louis is subjected to the assessment, which I think it ought not to be. Still, I wish to know what you think.

A. LINCOLN.

SAINT LOUIS, March 7, 1865.

(Received 1. 15 p. m.)

Honorable e. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War, Washington:

I respectfully ask that Major J. F. Meline, assistant adjutant-general at my headquarters, be breveted colonel for services in Virginia campaign and in Northwest. He deserves the promotion, and I would esteem it a great favor to have him promoted.

JOHN POPE,

Major-General.
