CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

with his peculiar potmen, on what vas nc already
exhausted The questions before us probably ap-
peared somewhat different to him, as a new mem-
ber, than to those who hat occupied a seat hrre in
February, and mingled in tie excitement and dis-
cussions which accompanied the election of the
present Printers To him some of these questions I
seemed extraordinary. He was summoned here to
a session of the Senate without the House of Re-
presentatives, and, of course, a sess on for the
transaction of Executive business merely This
body was a permanent one, and hence it was sup- i
posed that no new officers were to be elected, if no |
vacancies already existed But if they did exist,
he entertained no doubt we conld complete the
organization of the boly, and fill those vacancies,
if the officer? were believed to be necessary, or it
we had any business for them to do, and whether
such an election was conducted with open or closed
doors, was not very material, it being an organic
measure, or, m other words, an act of inhetsnt
power, or, as denominated by the Senator from
Delaware, [Mr. Bayard,] "absolute power"
It was neither legislative nor executive, strictly
speaking, but being ore of organization, it
seemed proper, either to precede any other busi-
siness, or to be taken up when the necessary ccca
sion demanded But what c id we see? Was the I
office, employmen , or contract of aFrmter vacant?
Nothing of the kind The resolution under con-
sideration was not ihen required to organize this
body, but tended directly to disorgamz' v It went
to create vacancies, instead of filling them It as- I
signsd no reason whatever for making them, and
did not even propose to fill them, when made On
its face, therefore, it seemed diso gam/mg, as well
as out of o.der, irregular and unnecessary
Most unfortunately, then, we commence our pro-
ceedings in disorganization Where they will end,
remains to be seen
But it has been observed that sometimes, it not
on tbts eccasion, itwasjust fiable to force vcarcies,
and then proceed to new elections In such ceses,
however, it would sepui a proper preliminary, that
in some report, resolution or motion, rei*ono lor it
should at least be assigned, if pot proved in order
that it might appear c n the record why action w s
proposed, and definir  notice given of what wa  to
be met If the last eiecaon of Printers was con
sidered unconstitutional or, <f the i"cumbenls had
since grossly misbeha/ed in their official capacity,
why arc not these grounds of removal regularly
set forth? If, considering the Prin'ers merely offi
cers, and m no respect contractors, it is admitted
that various grounds might be supposed which
could be considered sufficient, if duly stated, and
proved But unless these were done, the proceed-
ing looked extraordinary, and new members were
acting in the dark, ?n t our journal, he feared,
would appear discreditable But, aside from this,
what reason  have been assigned, orelly, in favor
of the resolutioní Nobody hw pretended, in th s
debate, as I understand it, ih't the election of BUir
and Rives was unconsti'u ional The movr him-
self [Mr Manoum] says he will not call it sc, and
if the opposite side, as a party, seriously assumed
such ground, their acts should correspond, and they
would at one- proceed to choose successors to the
present incumbents, instead of offenrg this re=oiu
tion lo remove them
The resolution itself, then, recognises them to be
m office constitutionally Indeed, the} were elect-
ed at the nsui>l time, m th  usual mamei, and on
the usual terms, which have prevailed for nearly
twenty years in this body What hould m peach
such an election'! The only argument aga nst its
validity that I have heard on this ccc% ion, hus
been that the other House had recently oVamed
their printing to be done at a less price th?n was
provided m the joint resolution ot 1819 But it
would be difficult to prove that the departure from
ihe law by one House vitiated its force witn the
other, which might prefer lo adhere to the law, or
that the members of the other House cou'd not
procure their printing to be done more economical
ly than the law required, if opportunity offered, and
still not be guilty of any illegality, nor the law I
jtself become void.
Considering these Pnnteis, therefore, as duly in
office, and, for argument, merely at this mom<>nt,
that no contract exists, but that the present resolution
proposes to dis mss them from office only, the
question—and, in my view, the first, if not the
most important question—recurs, Is it intended to
be done with or wuhout causei Which'! Its lan-
guage is s lent on that p mi, md hence the natural
inference may be, that the removal is contemplated
to be m?de without cause. Yetseveral gentlemen,
in debate, strongly disclaim any such design or
motive, and detail various reasons for the meas ire
But, m the threshold, all of us ought to form ex-
plicit opinions on th s point It is dup to justice,
frankness, manliness And if, m truto, any mem
ber votes for the removal witnout cause, then I pre
sume Ihe acf, in him, 13 admired to b* an arbi
trary act It is merely sic volo—sic jubeo It is an
act which I will not presume ever to eccur, as it
appears to me one utterly unworthy this dignified
assembly It would be sheer caprice and wan-
tonness, and if not rank injustice, it at least can
never be vindicated in the high forum of the Ame-
rican Senate
Whatever a collector might do to a tide-wai er,
in a moment of irritation and displeasure this
assembly of ambassadors from the sovereign States
of our great Union, can nevpr set an example of
removal without any cause whatever, because so
deioaatory to it, and at the same time so dangerous
to o her legislative assemblies Over our who'e
country, they look ur to us for decorum, gravity,
caution, and wisdom Beyond all this, if these
Primers be at the same time contractors, which I
shall endeavor to demonstrate hereafter, such a
removal, without any cause whatever, would not
only be arbitrary, and of evil example, but gro.sly
illegal
In either view therefore, whetrer as efheers oi
contiactors, I understand all the gentlemen on the
other si U who have spoken, admit Ihe existence of
a cause for th" removal, and thus admii thp impío
pnety of aclmg without one Then what is the
c ust2 «hat its vlidit)' and how is it ascertained
or tr ed?
The gentleman from North Carolina, who offer-
ed the resolution, «ajs it is a cause, not solely po
htical The member from Kentucky [\lr Clay]
avowed it wa a eau«e touching something infa-
mous m the mantnement of the pub'io pre«s
Others appeared to speak of meie political difference
of opinion as sufficient to justify th" lemovil
Others, who have not yet spekn are supro  ci to
be ready to vote for their dismis al, eithp<- foi that
reason alone, or for that, coup'ed with some mlefi-
nite undefined incompatibility of temper difference
of fashion and appearance, or want of harmony in
feeling and Me Now, let me caution gentlemen
who may, even in common cases, remove from of-
fice for a mere d fference ir poluical opinions,
though most on the other side, it isbelet°d, are
pledged not to remove at all for that cause, that
they stand on very slippery gro ind m removal of
printers for a mere diffeience m political views
In the first place, the sufficiency of bis cause in
ordit ary instances is v evsel not alike amorg all
gentlemen on either *ide But I do ne t pi opose to
discu s> that question now Br it iemrmber d,
however, that he vho vote-, for this íemoval tor
that cause alone, and has here ofcre censured
others for removals on Recount of it, must admit
tnat he has done a wrong to other , or is now doing
one himself
If h s course he nov right, so was ¡heirs But
much more than this It such acrurse wis rignt
in relation to officers net Printers, and pdopted by
ordimry tribunal it b, no means follows that it is
expedient or justifiable iti íespect to a class of cfn
cers connected with the publ c p-ess Nor sheuld
it ever, m my apprehension, be hastily pxerei e 1,
in the unusual form now proposed by si ch a p -
litical tribunal as the Senate, who   doings con be
communicated to their respective S ates oily to a
very limited extent, except through a fiee, b 1 and
vigilant press I say, then, in this view, that the
present s a new case in our annals Grant, then,
that some g-ntleman may freí justified els wh*re
in making, for such a cause, the removal of an
ordinary officer, it should require grave considera-
tion in them as Senators, members of a representa-
tive body, to drive away from around that body,
merely for a difference in opmion in politics, the
only watch dogs of their masters—the people and
tne States They are the sentinels who scrutinize
oar conduct, and daily repert it in behalf of oar
constituents—the public censors, to criticise it ful-
ly and featlessly—to expose errors or foibles, and
hang up vices, if any, to indignant reprobation.
Again, a-e we to claim to be above mistakes—
iramacula e? Are we alone to be screened and all
beside exposed' Are we more holy than other citi-
zens' In brief, the effect of such removals, if not
revolung fo public sentiment and causing a speedy
and scornful re-action, cannot but lend, however
well meant,to sap the whole foundations of the liberty
of the press It laysthe axe at th- rootof its índepea-
dence It tends to render it era' en and cowardly—
to silence its warnings—to make it fawn around
pouer, rather than expose its wrongs or rebuke its
usurpations It 1 the business and duty of politi-
cal edi ors to be vigilant, and indeed censorious,
where occasion appears to require it It is their
fearless vocation Shall we alteram to unnerve
then? Can error of opinion be tolerated at all,
unkss reason is left fiee to combat it? And will not
liberty of conscience become also in jeopardy by
such a course? But, gentlemen exclaim, at least
the Senator from Kentucky does, these Printers
are to be removed, net merely for diffe-
rence m polmcal opinion, but for harsh re-
flections on members of this body—for libellous
strictures—that require this kind of punishment, or
justify such retaliatory measuies. This opens a
new and wide field for reflection Real libels are
a crime, and punishable as such at common law
Are we to accuse others of crimes, and punish
them here in this «ummary form—without hear-
ing—without a specification—notice—a jury—
counsel, or witness? Are we to do all this, also,
¡n oar own ca ps, interested and ex parte1 to be
accusers, j .dges, an 4 executioner* This course
has been called milnarj, but is it not going beyond
even a drum hpad court martial' The humblest
cu z n, for the smallest offence, is by the Constitu-
tion entitled to the benefits of the 6 h amendment,
in the following word ' For all criminal prosecu-
tions, the accused shall enjoj the right to a speedy
anr> publ c trial, by an impartial jury of the State
and district wherein (he ciime shall have been com-
muted, which district shaH have been previously

other , and their conduct tnen, on complaint,
comes befoie us for examination But we should
not t^en remove ihem without specified charges
ard a hearing, and will we act differently when our
own ínteres s or feelings render us less safe and
proper to ]udgo? These "ircumstances illustrate
the imporUnce of asceitamipg, as I have attempt-
el, whether these Printers are tj be removed with
or vu bout can e, ind if with eau e, for what one?
Is it f r a crime, and a criiie against us, or for a
m#ie d flerence or 1 pinion1 The diffeient conse-
cjuences 10 the parties likewise show the impor-
tance of these distinctions If you had pro-
posed to remove them without any cause, then Ihe
act being meiely arbitrary, wou'd tend to affix, and
would affix, no st ?ma or reproach on them, but
rattier it w uld fix then on ourselves We should
