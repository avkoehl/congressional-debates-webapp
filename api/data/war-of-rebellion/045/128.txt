BALTIMORE, JUNE 15, 1863.

Major-General HALLECK,

General-in-Chief, Washington, D. C.:

Have not yet received report from Milroy. General Kelley, here on his way, via Harrisburg, to New Creek, says before he left Harper's Ferry, at 1 o'clock this p. m., about 2, 000 of Milroy's men had arrived. The rebels appeared before Winchester in four division, commanded by Ewell, Evans [?], Early, and Rodes, numbering 40, 000. Milroy fought until 2 o'clock this morning, when he determined to evacuate and cut his way out. Spiking his guns and destroying store, he marched some distance before his movement was discovered. He was then pursued, and attacked 6 miles from Winchester, and was shelled for several miles. His loss is probably 2, 000 men, but that may be exaggeration. Will send, as soon as received, fuller and more exact report.

Major-General, Commanding.

Major-General HALLECK,

General-in-Chief, Washington, D. C.:

An intercepted letter, written by a banker in Richmond to his wife in Baltimore, states that Lee has large re- enforcement from Charleston; has seized every horse, wagon, and mule in and around Richmond, and has three division of 30, 000 each; that the attack on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad is a mere diversion; that he intends to cut a point in the Baltimore and Washington road, and that he also intends to go to Bush River, to get into Pennsylvania. The bearer of the letter also stated that Lee would move on Aquia Creek.

Brigadier-General TYLER,

Harper's Ferry, W. Va.:

You will have to detail officers for the present for your staff. We have none to spare. Has General Kelley gone westward, as ordered this morning? The general commanding thinks that very important.

Lieutenant-Colonel, and Chief of Staff.
