The people of my district are greatly excited on this subject, but disposed to maintain law and order, as they should. We hope to be able to see you to-day, and ask respectfully that you do not decide the case adverse to the wishes of our constituents before receiving us.

Respectfully, yours,

J. K. MOORHEAD.

SIMON CAMERON.

WAR DEPARTMENT, Washington, January 3, 1861.

Honorable BENJAMIN STANTON,

Chairman Committee on Military Affairs, House of Representation:

SIR: In answer to your letter, asking for information on certain points specified in a resolution adopted by the Committee on Military Affairs of the House of Representatives on the 18th ultimo, I have the honor to state as follows:*

* * * * *

The other information asked for in regard to the number and description of arms "distributed since the 1st of January, 1860, and to whom and at what price," will be found in the accompanying statements (Nos. 2 and 3) from the Ordnance Bureau. It is deemed proper to state, in further explanation of statement Numbers 2, that where no distribution appears to have been made to the State or Territory, or where the amount of the distribution is small, it is because such State or Territory has not called for all the arms due on its quotas and remains a creditor for dues not distributed, which can be obtained at any time on requisition therefor.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. HOLT,

Secretary of War ad interim.

[Inclosure Numbers 2.]
