in landing supplies and material by heavy wind-storms, but are now sufficiently in advance to remove the danger of any further delays. Our casualties have been small, and are now trifling in number and character. From the lists published in the Mobile papers, those of the enemy have been much greater. Steele's column, after completing the work assigned to it, now invests Blakely on the north and east. His operations were entirely successful, resulting in the destruction of the Mobile and Montgomery road as far as Greenville, the capture and destruction of 2 locomotives and 30 cars, and the capture of between 300 and 400 prisoners.

(Care of Brigadier-General Bailey.)

I have the honor and pleasure to inform you that Selma has been captured by our forces with twenty-three pieces of artillery and all the valuable machinery, &amp;c. Sherman has defeated Johnston, who has fallen back on Raleigh, where our forces are now besieging him. The news comes from Mobile papers of this morning and is, therefore, reliable. We shall fire a salute of 100 shotted guns to-morrow at noon in honor of these victories.
