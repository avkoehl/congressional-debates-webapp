You have probably learned before this of the accident to the bridge at Bridgeport, which I presume you had not heard of when you wrote your note (without date) just received by your orderly. General Stanley has just received orders, which will be communicated to you this evening, to direct your movements to-morrow.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. A. GARFIELD,
