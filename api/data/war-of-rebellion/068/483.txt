All trains and wheeled vehicles with the troops will be immediately moved on the plank and pike roads south of Wilderness Run, and beyond the Brock road. Corps commanders will take measures to see that this order is carried into effect, to ascertain the new location of their trains, and see that their men are well supplied with ammunition before the trains are moved.

ORDERS.] HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,

May 7, 1864-11.10 a. m.

The wounded of the army will be sent to Washington via Rappahannock Station with as little delay as practicable, under the direction of the chief quartermaster and medical director. Major-General Sheridan, commanding Cavalry Corps, will furnish a sufficient escort for the train conveying the wounded, which it is estimated will embrace 400 ambulances and a like number of wagons. The cavalry escort will only go to Rappahannock Station, from which point the wounded can be transported by railroad.
