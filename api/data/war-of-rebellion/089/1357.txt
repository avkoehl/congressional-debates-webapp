HEADQUARTERS,Wilmington, December 30, 1864.

Lieutenant Colonel A. ANDERSON,

Asst. Adjt. and Insp. General, Hdqrs. Dept. of North Carolina:

COLONEL: The reserves having been ordered to Goldsborough, and the Governor having returned the home guards, I have to call the attention of the general commanding to the inadequacy of the garrison of Wilmington to perform even ordinary guard duty. There is but one company at present (Bass', unattached), for Hahr's small battalion of light-duty men cannot be considered permanent, and will probably soon be withdrawn. To-day we have men on guard who were on guard yesterday. The City Battalion, small as it is, must be returned to duty equally important. The post necessary to prevent improper ingress and egress has been reduced even below efficiency; the boarding of ships, the reception, guarding, and care of the large amount of public stores, magazines, and batteries require at all times a suitable and permanent force. I suggest an exchange for the reserves, that the remaining companies of the Tenth Regiment, being artillery, be sent here, together with the Sixty-eighth, for the purpose. The former are good artillerists and engineer troops, and are needed here.

Very respectfully,

W. H. C. WHITING,

Major-General.
