HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, March 5, 1865-12 m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

Fifteen deserters are reported as coming in last night. They report Mahone's and Grimes' divisions as under marching orders, and some think that two of Mahone's brigades have gone. They state it was reported in their camps that Sheridan occupied Staunton and Charlottesville, and had defeated Early's troops. This last report comes from deserters on the extreme right and left, showing the report existed all through the rebel army. The firing yesterday p.m. was on the Ninth Corps front, the enemy opening when were relieving a battery in one of the works.

The deserters from Davis' brigade, Heth's division, that came into our lines this morning state that they were ordered to be ready to move yesterday morning an hour before daylight, their pickets having reported that they heard our artillery moving to our left during the night. The deserter from Grimes' brigade [Rodes' old division] reports that their pickets [west side of Hatcher's Run] were under orders to be ready to move at daylight yesterday morning. He states that the division is encamped near Sutherland's Station, having recently moved from the north to the south side of the railroad.
