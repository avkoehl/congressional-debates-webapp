in order that full efficacy may be given to the military power for the repressin of the evil.

It may be proper here to add that afteer the expriation of the term for which the writ was suspended serious embarrassment was encountered, particularly at Mobile, Wilmington, and Richmond, on account of the inability of the military authorities to arrest and hold suspected prsons against whom the testimony was sufficient to gived full assurance that they were spies or holding treasonable communication with the enemy, though legal proof could not be adducd the secure thier commitment and conviction by the courts either becuase of the character of the evidence or of the necessity for concealing the sources of inforamtion, which were not infrequently within the enemy's lines.

JEFFERSON DAVIS.

MONTGOMERY, November 9, 1864.

Hon. J. A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War:

Unless you interfere there will be a conflict between the Confederate and State authorities. Officers of the State cannot be conscribed without the consent of the State. I learn that your enrolling officers have instructions to enroll officers of the State who have been elected since the 17th of February, 1864. I deny such right and will resist it with all the forces of the State. The policy officers of Selma have been enrolled by force. These officers are indispensable to the administration of the State government. General withers says he has no discretion. An early reply requested.

T. H. WATTS,

Governor of Alabama.

RICHMOND, VA., November 9, 1864.

His Excellency Governor WILLIAM SMITH:

GOVERNOR: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 24th ultimo, covering a copy of the resolutions passed at a meeting of the Governors of Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi, held at Augusta, Ga., October 17, 1864,* and am,

Very respectfully and truly, yours,

JEFFERSON DAVIS.

RICHMOND, VA., November 9, 1864.

Major THOMAS HUDSON,

Commandant of Conscripts, Enterprise, Miss.:

MY DEAR SIR: I have received your letter of September 29, and found pleasure in complying with the request which it conveyed by assigning you to duty as commandant of conscripts for the Stae of Mississippi as well as of the camp at Enterprise.

Very respectfully and truly, yours,
