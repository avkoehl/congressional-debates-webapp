create of course  the  cost of their  raanufectured

If, by the repeal of the corn laws, the price ot bread
should be reduced in England, and the price of
gram increased in this country, the cost of manu-
iactutmg wou d be inert a ed here, and leduced

our manujadurei$ to compete with those of Great

It therefore cannot be to the interest of the ma-

peal of the British corn laws How dee? the mat-
ter stand in regard to the gram growers of this
country'2 At pre.ent they have access to the mar

the Continent, b-tng much cheaper than ours,
would exclude it /rem the British market, and con-
sequently our agricultural ínteres s of the Middle
and Western S ates would no longer enjoy the

Ths SPEAKER m'erpesed, with tne remark that

memorial prayed fr r a protective tariff. Tho*c who
drew tlie memorial, and the gentleman who pre-
sented it, knew that to speak of a protective tariff
to me South was to open Pandora's box, and the
memorial was couched in language likely to be
most offe isive, and ca culated to affect the course
