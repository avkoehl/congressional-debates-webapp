[Indorsement.]

GOLDSBOROUGH, N. C., April 8, 1865.

Approved and respectfully forwarded.

I call attention to the services of Brigadier-General Morgan. He has now commanded a division since August, 1864, and has been in the capture of Atlanta and Jonesborough, and both on Savannah and Carolina campaigns, and he should be breveted major-general. I also cordially indorse General Davis' other recommendations.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
