From the best information you have where do you suppose General Pickett to be?

ORD,

Major-General.
HDQRS. DEPT. OF VIRGINIA AND NORTH CAROLINA,August 25, 1864-6.55 p. m.

General ORD:

I have no doubt he is on this near the left of our line.

J. W. SHAFFER,

Colonel and Chief of Staff.
HDQRS. DEPT. OF VIRGINIA AND NORTH CAROLINA,In the Field, August 25, 1864-7 p.m.

Major-General ORD:

Pickett's division and Thomas' brigade of Georgia troops are known to be on this front. I cannot, however, see where they could possibly have a mine on this front unless under one advanced redoubt we have.

Possibly the mine may be on south side Appomattox. General Birney will be fully prepared for them here.

J. W. SHAFFER,

Colonel and Chief of Staff.
