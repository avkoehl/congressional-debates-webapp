smaller subdivisions of your State, I would suggest that for harmonizing the subject of credits in drafts hereafter you regard the enrollment of the first-class made by this Bureau as the basis of assignment.

I have the honor to be, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Will the War Department consent that our State may raise one regiment of cavalry; also another company of heavy artillery for home use, the same as the last? Please answer by telegraph.

ALBANY, October 26, 1863.

Colonel J. B. FRY:

I have two statements from you about quota of New York under the proclamation. One says 38,268, the other 60,378. Which is correct?

His Excellency HORATIO SEYMOUR,

Governor of New York, Albany, N. Y.:

Sixty thousand three hundred and seventy-eight is the correct quota of New York under the proclamation of October 17. The quota was subdivided for different divisions, and perhaps the mistake originated in that way.
