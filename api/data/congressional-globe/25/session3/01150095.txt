1839.
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE,
05
the end of the present short session If these
gentlemen who asked for the accommodation were
íeally reporters, he would cheerfully vote for the
resolution, but as they weie not, he would leave
them to take their chance, with ottier citizens of
the United States, in the comfortable galleues of
the Senate
Mr PRESTON thought that the Senator from
Pennsylvania was mistaken as to the purport of
the resolution, it confeired the puvilege of admis-
sion on reporters alone, not on letter-wi iters, and,
therefore, if the resolution was adopted, letter-
writers would not be admitted under it But he
was not disposed to join with honoiable Senators
in the unmitigated condemnation they had dealt
out to this class of persons, he was of opinion
that these letter-wiiters piesented a more interest
ing sketch, a more faith/ul picture of the doings
of the Senate, than the mere join nal like records
of the official proceedings furnished by out city
papers, howevei correct they might be If, as
the Senator fiom Pennsvlvania seemed to think,
he had been dealt with more kindly t'ian the Sen
ator fiom Connecticut, it was because he was a
much more humble individual As the Senator
had related an instance in which his vanity was
guevously mortified, he would mention one in
which his was as highly excited He had seen
one of these letters, in which the wntei asset ted
there was a. strong peisonal resemblance between
the Senatoi from Connecticut and himself, only
that he (Mr. P ) was somewhat moie veneiablc
in appearance Now, this, to a person of his
humble pretensions to personal atti actions, was
highly flattoung, and might account foi his, pai-
tiality to this class of pei&ons, and to the aver-
sion with which they areiegaided by the Senatoi
from Connecticut But the Senatoi was amply
compensated for this single unpleasant compau-
soo by the many eulogiums whn.li weie passed
upon him Why, su, was it not said by one of
them that the Senatoi fiom Connecticut bpoke
extemporaneously in the sententious and foicible
language that Fiankhn, with all his plulosopnic
reseaich, elaborated in the clo= t? But (said Mi
P ) gentlemen seem to thn k that our side have
the ad\antage m the misreptesentations which
are sent from this city respecting our pioceed
mgs He thought they were mistaken, and that
their favors weie pietty equally distiibu^ed It
was said that these gentlemen wrote foi both
sides, for papers of both political paities Well,
then, the sameletter-wntei, to please hisemploy-
ei, in one papei serves up the gentlemen on that
side of the House, while in anothci papei he is
equally unceiemonious in his caneatuie3 of gen
tlemen on this side Now, heio was a stiikmg
evidence of the impaitiality of these gentlemen
In regard to caucatuie, though somewhat over-
charged and distoi ted, and calculated to make one
laugh, yet to ue efficient it wai alwaysntcessaiy
to pieserve a likeness, and he thought that a moie
vivid picture of the doings of the Senate had been
presented to the public in that mode than by any
other For his own pait, he tnought that the
misrepresentations ot this class could work in-
jury to no one, and that eiroi may be safely tol
eiated whtn reason was left free to combat it
Mi NILES observed that the honorable Sen-
ator fiom South Carolina was mistaken in one
particular He was sensible that he should be a
gainer by a change of constituent y, and it was
very probable the Senator also would be The
Senatoi had a wondeiful faculty of moving in a
circle, and of being at the extiemcs of po'i ics
He thought he knew the Senator fiom South
Carolina, and that some of hit, (Mi N 's) con-
stituents, the men of the Hartford convention
stamp, could not be better íepiesented than by
him, whilst he thought that he himself, with the
assistance of a gentleman near him, could get
alone very well in rcpiesenting the Nullifieis of
South Carolina He was veij son y that his
worthy and excellent friend had let fall some ob-
sei vations which might have the appearance of
being ironical He was sensible, however, that
the Senator was sincere, and was senous m all
that he said As to these newspaper scribblers,
he disregaided them altogether He was an old
campaigner, and what they wrote never affected
him He never lead any of their effusions but
one lettel, and that was done up m a handsome
style, and inclosed to him daected msuch a neat
hand wuting, that, supposing it to be from some
fair damsel, he took the trouble to read it
Mr PRESTON said he could not acquiesce in
the suggestion of the Senator that it might be
advantageous to them to change pobitions—that
he (Mr P ) might be the rtpiesentative of the
membeis of the Haitford convention, and the
Senator fiom Connecticut might represent the
Nullifiers of South Caí olma Ño, sn, (said Mr
P ,) I nevei could be a fit representative of the
old Hartford Convention Federalists, nor would
the Senatoi from Connecticut be an appropnate
representative of the bravery and magnanimity
of the chivalrous Nullifiei Noi would he change
States with the Senator He would not change
South Carolina, wrong as he thought she was at
present, foi Connecticut, howe\er right he might
deem her to be It was better to be wrong with
Cato, than right with anybody else
The question was then taken on the motion to
postpone the icsolution indefinitely, and it was
earned—yeas 90, nays 17, as follows

The PRESIDENT then i ose and asked the in-
dulgence of the Sen ite while he made a shoit state
mont     A remark  had been made in the course
of the debate   which, to say the least of it, was
calculated to throw upon the Piesidmg Officer of
the Senate the imputation of negligence in the dis-
charge of his duty     He alluded to the remark
made by the Senator from South Carolina, [Mi
Pkxstom,] in which heexpiessed his disappioba
Hon of an editor enjoying the privileges of coming
into that Chamber "  fiom rights unknown to
him," oi something to that  eifect     Piesummg
that the Senator intended to refei   to one of the
public puntéis, who was an   editor   of a daily
papei, (Mr   Blair,) and at ill times willing to ex-
plain tin motives which °-o\crned his conduct,
howevi i inadequate the Piesidmg Officer might
feel O the peifect dischaige of the high and re-
sponsible duties devolving on him, he would now,
with then  indulgence, proceed to   state   to the
Senate the giounds on which this gentleman had
been admitted within the Chamber   The Presid-
ing Officei intended that lns> conduct should be
such that neither pei&onal nor political consider
ations could be imputed to him by his admitting
any peison on this floor, or to any pi vilege, gieat
or small, in violation of his duty     If the Senator )
fiom South Carolina had thought piopei to have
honored the Piesidmg Officei with a knowledge of,
his disappiobation, it would  not have  been un
known to him by what rights th< editor he íeftued
to enteied the Chamber    A propositi >n was sub
muted to him in writing, soo i alter his taking the
chau, foi his decision uhethei, by a piopei con
stiuction, the line adopted at the close of the last
session excluded tht punters of the body     The
Chan had no hcsilition in giving it as  his eon
struction of the une, tha   the public printers, as
officeis of the bod\ , wrie not excluded      liny
weie sworn officeis, made so by the \otes of the
body,and as much en itled to come into the Cham
bei as the cleiks, messengeis, dooikeepeu,, and
othei officers, subject only to the obseiiance of
that decorum which was expec ed of every one
coming within their walls     In fact, the public
pnntetv, elected by the body, and sworn to the
faithful peiformanee of then duty, had been con
sidi ltd as officeis of the bodv, and admitted as
ever such, since the foundation of tne Govern-
ment
The Presiding Officer had thought it his duty,
in consequence of the remaiks of the Senator
from South Caiolina to make this explanation,
that the Senate might conect him if he had been I
in eiroi He would assure the benator tnat not
the affections of a biothei—no par'ialities, per
sonal or political—should over induce him to
swcive, for an instant, fiom the stuct line of his
duty
Mr PRESTON said tnat, with the permission
of the Senate, he would say, that in his rerruuK
in his allusion to the admission of an editor of
one of the city papéis, he had not intended the
slightest offensive allusion to the Presiding Officer
of the Senate He had taken the occasion of a
discussion as to the piopnety of admitting re-
porters on tnat floor, to say that he did not know
by what right a certain editor was admitted If
it was undei a general rule of the Senate, as a
member of the body he had a right to know what
that rule was He still said that he did not know
what right the Public Pnntor had on that floor,
more than the printer of any other paper, as he
was not mentioned in the mle of the Senate
The PRESIDENT said, m reply, that he did
not bring this matter to the notice of the Senate
to convey the idea that the Senator from South
Carolina had any personal object m view, or that
he intended to wound the feelings of the Presiding
Officer But the Senatoi must know that these
remaiks, whether expressed in kindness oi other-
wise, involved an imputation of neglect of duty
on the pait of the Presiding Officei, oi those who
executed the rules under his direction The Pre-
siding Officer did not feel so neglectful of his own
character as to heai remaiks calculated to throw
on him the imputation of a neglect of duty, with-
out making a prompt and suitable explanation.
As to the coirectness of his decision, it was for
the Senate to judge The rule did not say that
Senatois should be admitted, or that the Secre-
tary, oi cleiks, or Sergeant-at-Aims, or door-
keepers should be admitted, any more than the
Public Punter These were all admitted as sworn
officers of the Senate, and if they were not ad-
mitted as such, the rule, of course, excluded
them
PUBLIC  DEPOSITS.
The resolution submitted by Mr Rives, calling;
on the President for additional information íela-
tive to the tiansictions between the Government
and the Bank of the United States, growing out
of the sales of the bonds of said bank, was taken,
up as the unfinished business, when
Mi NlLEs addtes^od the Senate at great
length, with consideiable foice and ability, in re-
ply to Mi Riils's speech of yesteiday, after
which,
Mi CL AlY, of Alabama, moved that the whole
subject be postponed unt'l Tuesday, m ordei that
it might not mteifcre with the giaduation bill,
which the Senate was pledged to take up on Mon-
day
After some objections made by Mi CLAY, of
Kentucky, and a íeply by Mi WALKER, the
motion of Mr Clay, of Alabama, was agreed
to, and
The Senate adjourned
