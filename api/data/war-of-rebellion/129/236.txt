they chose to exercise it, to separate themselves from a political association and government of their former choice and institute a new government to suit themselves.

3d. That if Rhode Island, with her meager elements of nationality, was such a "people" in 1776, when her separation from the Government and people of Great Britain took place, much more was Georgia and each of the other seceding States, with their large territories, populations, and resources, such a "people," and entitled to exercise the same right in 1861, when they decreed their separation from the Government and people of the United States; and if the separation was rightful in the first case it was more clearly so in the last, the right depending, as it does in the case of every "people" for whom it is claimed, simply upon their fitness and their will to constitute an independent state.

4th. That this right was perfect in each of the State, to be exercised by her at her own pleasure, without challenge or resistance from any other power whatsoever; and while these Southern States had long had reason enough to justify its assertion against some of their faithless associates, yet, remembering the dictate of "prudence," that "governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes," they forbore a resort to its exercise, until numbers of the Northern States, State after State, through a series of years, and by studied legislation, had arrayed themselves in open hostility against an acknowledged provision of the Constitution, and had at last succeeded in the election of a President who was the avowed exponent and executioner of their faithless designs against the constitutional rights of their Southern sisters - rights which had been often adjudicated by the courts, and which were never denied by the Abolitionists themselves but upon the ground that the Constitution itself was void whenever it came in conflict with a "higher law," which they could not find among the laws of God, and which depended for its exposition solely upon the elastic consciences of rancorous partisans.

"

5th. That the reasons which justified the separation when it took place have been vindicated and enhanced in force by the subsequent course of the Government of Mr. Lincoln - by his contemptuous rejection of the Confederate commissioners who were sent to Washington before the war to settle all matters of difference without a resort to arms, thus evincing his determination to have war; by his armed occupation of the territory of the Confederate States, and especially by his treacherous attempt to re-enforce his garrisons in their midst, after they had, in pursuance right, withdrawn their people and territory from the jurisdiction of his Government, thus rendering war a necessity, and actually inaugurating the present lamentable war; by his official denunciation of the Confederate States as "rebel" and "disloyal" States for their rightful withdrawal from their faithless associate States, whilst no word of censure has ever fallen form him against those faithless States who were truly "disloyal" to the Union and the Constitution which was the only cement of the Union, and who were the true authors of all the wrong and all the mischief of the separation, thus insulting the innocent by charging upon them the crimes of his own guilty allies; and finally, by his monstrous usurpations of power and undisguised repudiation of the Constitution,
