ORDER OF BUSINESS.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. If there be
no further petitions or memorials to be presented,
reports from committees are in order.
Mr. LANE, of Kansas. 1 ask the Senate at
this time by unanimous consent to take up a res-
olution reported by me from the Committee on
Agriculture. It will excite no discussion, 1 am
sure.
Mr. CONNESS. We adjourned last evening
with some business pending, and 1 hope that the
regular order will go on this morning until we
can take up and finish that.
Mr. LANE, of Kansas. When the Senator
hears my statement he will consent to the pas-
sage of the resolution. It is for the printing of
two thousand copies of the agricultural part of
the Census Report of 1860, for the use of the Com-
missioner of Agriculture. Time is important, for
unless the resolution is soon acted upon, the type
will be distributed.
Mr. CONNESS. I have no objection to the
resolution, but 1 think it can wait yet a little
while. The type will not be distiibuted until
the morning hour is over, certainly.
Mr. LANE, of Kansas. â€¢ But when the morn-
ing hour is over I shall not be able to get it up.
The 1'llESlDEN1 r pro tempore. Is objection
made to the present consideiation of the resolu-
tion ?
^ Mr. LANE, of XOinsas. I withdraw the mo-
tion at present.

CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT.
Mr. TRUMBULL. I offer the followingcon-
curient resolution, and ask for its present con-
sideration:
A concurrent resolution requesting the President of the
United States to transmit to the Executives of the seveial
United States the amendment proposed by Congress-to
the Constitution respecting the extinction of slavery
therein.
Resolved, ^c., That the President of the United States
be jeque^ted to transmit to tin? Executives of the several
Slates copies of the article ol amendment proposed by Con-
t>rct-s to be added to the Constitution of the United States
ie>pecting the extinction of slavery in the United Slates,
to ih<! end that if either of the said States may not have al-
ready aeted upon the *aid proposed amendment they may
ptoeecd to do so; and that he leqnest the Hxeeutive of
rach State which ha*> ratified or shall hereafter ratify Midi
amendment to transmit to ihe Secretary of State a certified
copy of Mich ratification.
This is a concurrent resolution, requiring but
one reading, 1 think. I ask for its present con-
sideration. 1 presume there will be no objection
to it.
There being no objection, the Senate proceeded
to consider the resolution.
Mr. JOHNSON. I think the title of the reso-
lution should be amended. It says the " several
United States;" it should be the " several States."
Mr. TRUMBULL. This is a copy of the res-
olution that was adopted in regard to the other
amendments, and if the Senator from Maryland
will have the first part of it read again he will
see, 1 think, that there is no objection to the
phraseology of the resolution.
Mr. JOHNSON. I ask for the reading of the
title of the resolution again.
The Secretary read it.
Mr. JOHNSON. The words several United
States" are surely wrong; 1 suppose it means
" spvpffll SffttfXl "
Mr. TRUMBULL. It was copied by the Sec-
retary, and I think copied from a former resolu-
tion. I have no objection to that change in the
phraseology.
Mr. JOHNSON. It is right in the resolution;
but wrong in the title. There is but one United
States.
The PRESIDENT;}â„¢ tempore. The resolution
will be so modified.
The resolution, as modified, was adopted.
SOLOMON WADSWORTH.
Mr. HARLAN. I move that the Senate pro-
ceed to the consideration of House bill No. 431.
Mr. FOOT. I hope the ordinary morning
business will be gone through with before any
motion of this kind shall be entertained. Some four
or five mornings have pas-sed in which such mo-
tions have been made, cutting off the usual morn-
ing business before an opportunity for presenting
it was had. I desire to offer a resolution; and I
know there is a large quantity of business of the
usual character for the morning hour not yet pre-
sented.
