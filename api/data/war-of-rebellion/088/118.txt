Major B. F. FISHER,

The dust reported at 12.10 this p. m. I think must have arisen from teams moving from enemy's left and disappearing in woods at point about southwest, or near Dinwiddie road. A signal station in rear of city at a point south-southwest plainly visible. Enemy yet busy on works northwest and west-northwest of this station. Fire in Petersburg between 3 and 4 this a. m.
