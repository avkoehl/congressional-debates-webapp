CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
JffvDoty when he was before the Senate for confirmation. Ef-
forts-—diligent and unremitted efforts—had been made by gen-
tletnen  in the cénate and out of it, to sustain the charges by
proof, and to prevent the confirmation After a thorough in-
vestigation of those charges, aftor a strict examination of the
proofs furnished to the Senate when the nomination was be-
fore that body for confirmation, the Senate did not believe that
there weresufficientgroundsforrejectingthenomination They
had had an opportunity of investigation, this House had not.
Kotice was given of certain charges, the House had no evi-
dence of the truth of them, except & newspaper brought to the
"House, and purporting to be the proceedings of a Whig meet-
ing If such a meeting had been held, it would be at least
prvmafacie evidence, but he did not beheve that it was the
duty of the House to withhold the appropiiation m this bill
Intimation had now been given to the President of thf Tinned
States that charges had been made which, if true, should sub-
ject the Governor to removal He, Mr M hoped the appro
pnation wouidbe made, and that the President would investí
gate the charges, and that, if a tithe of them was true, a remo
Val would take place without a moment's delay     
¿Mr. ADAMS said he shouid be under the necessity of voting
against this motion Foi, admitting the facts stated by the gen
tlegrtan from Ohio [Mi Medí id to be true, of which he (Mr
A") had no other knowledge than that which had been produced
liy the gentleman, the vice or crime of this man il he was
guilty, did not at all affect his claim to the payment of his sa
iary so long as he continued m office He assumed this as a
«settled principle His claim for his salary as long as he re
jnained in office was an honest debton the Government His
obiection was, that the gentleman did not look to the proper re
medyj and in saying this m this particular case he applied it to
all similar cases Ii the facts stated in the papers the gentle-
man had produced were true, there were two remedies consist
ent with the Constitution of the United States, the one the mi
peachment of this officer It appeared to him veryciear that
íí the factsstated were true, this officer was impeachable and
disqualified for serving the United States in any capacity what
ever. Thus far the censorial power of this Congress existed.
U this course should be taken the officer would have, notwith
standing the recent decision of this House, that which he be
3ieved due to every accused man—the oppoitunity of being
heard in his own defence
"■ Ihere was another remedy which he believed to be perfectiy
constitutional, although he was not aware of any case in which
H had been resorted to under the Constitution of the United
Slates, and that was, an addiess by the two Houses of Congress
to the President oT the United ¡states demanding the removal of
this man This was a practice common in the country from
which we principally derived our political institutions He be-
lieved It to be a perfectly constitutional proceeding in this
country If this and the other House of Congress thought that
any public officer whatsoever, of those removable otherwise
than by impeachment, ought to be removed, he thought it a
petfectly proper proceeding—always to originate in this Hou^e
—to make an address to the President requesting that removal
And never would he give his name to any such paper without
allowing the person accused a pnvilege of defending himself
That was his gi eat objection now to the proceeding oí the gen
tieman from Ohio, proposing not only to make a man infamous
■without giving him an opportunity for his defence, but to de
prwo him of the ngbt of his pioperty If he were guilty of
alt the crimes of the decalogue it wouM not be sufficient torn
duce him (Mr A ) to deprive him of his reputation and pro
perty without giving him an opportunity of being heard m his
own defence
Mi C J INfirR^OIXsaid, that though any opinion of the
gentleman fiom Massachusetts was entitled to respect, he was
compelled to distentí rom both of that gentleman spiopositions,
andhethougbtihey wereof themostdaneerouscharacterto the

uves, who, pn his representative responsitiluy, had given thi<*
House to und"istand that an individual for whom itiey weie
about to vote a sum of public money, was an ln/amous amide
giaded man The gentleman liom Massachusetts had not
touched the question of the power of thw House, under any
circumstances, to withhold a salary He (Mr I) held that it
•was an extreme power, a radical power, which approached
very neaily to a revolutionary power, but, still it was a power
which he should be very son y to se** this House divest itself of
He held that they could not and should not denude themselvt q

purse as they did—that they would not untie its strings to a peí & >n

If ha owed the Government mone.,, it wa« the utuad cour&e
to deduct the amount from Government dehtors Instances
had been known of this having been done with respect to of
hcera of the army and the navy, and he had known an of
iter's pay to be stopped until the gallant rn¿n wasduven to
madness, and finally died after having gieatly distinguished
himself m the public service
iiut the gentleman from New Yoik [Mr Morgan] and the
gentleman fiom Massachusetts (Mr Auun] called lor proaf
What fuither proof would they have? VV>^ it not a well es>ta
hhshed principle of parliamentary Iw, that i umoi, if endorsed
by any ore, was sufficient ground to art upnn Here wis the
i imorandthtaccu«ei, but said the gentleman fiom Massa
chujetts, 'impeach him ' Tor what? Had he been guilty of
aiy high crimes and misdemeanors as Governor^ Unle-s he
had his impeachment was a larce If he (Mr Iisgersoll) tin
d^r^tood the charges, they weie for the moht part improprieties
o( conduct before he became Governoi and surely for tho^e
charges they could not imp°ach him And if he had changed
an attorney genpial andashenfTsmce bebecame Governor, he
(Mr Ing^rs il) was not sure that they wrrp such high crimes
an 1 rm^demeanore. a* would fall within the rli«s of im pracha
ble offences- they had fnerl in In« Stafe a jit I^e who had been
guilty oí the most iiasriin! ofienots, but he was acquitted,
thugh cftiilty beyoid a doubt, because he was not guríty of
"high crimen an 1 roisdemeanars Was the senflemm from
Massachusetts prepared tesay that an ofheei of a Tern ory was
impeachable at all?
Mr ADAMS (with great acrimony) sai 1 he did not deem an
answer requisite to any thing the gentleman had yet aid
Mr INGERbOLL continued He would pass the observa
tion of the gentleman from Massachusetts by without any no
tice, for he intended to treat both that gentleman and his argu
raent-with great respect. Was the gentleman from Massachu
setts prepared to say that an officer of a Territory was im-
peachable at allí He should very much doubt H. But if he
was, were they to be told, at this time of day, that for every im
propriety or misdeed of an officei, he was to be impeached?
Was there an instance of a man having been convicted who
had been tried under an impeachment? He should be glad to
be informed if theie was Theie had been removals, and, he
believed, compromises by the interpoeitiou of friends, and the
officershad been got rid of by hook or by crook, but in fifty
years, from what they knew of this doctrine of impeachment,
there had been no conviction
In the next place, the gentleman from Massachusetts said
theie was another, andhe (Mr Inqebsoh.) confessed itappear-
ed to him a still more objectionable course, that is to say,
that the two Houses by joint resoluion should cairy the
case up to the Executive,and when hesaidilup,"hemeantto
emphasize the word—to carry up to the Executive, ] the manner
in which these things were done in England or elsewhere, a re
monstance, or memorial, call it what they pleased, requiring or
requesting him to remove the ofheer Andsupposehe should
say,1 Gentlemen, I have considcied this matter,and I cannot, nor
will not remove him,' what was the remedy Í Was it possible
that they, the representatives of the people of the United State*,
were to be placed in thispiedicament, The course puisued
in England thecenilemanmu^t permit him tn «ay, was not ana
logousatall In England an omnipotent Parliament went up
to the monarch, and made asimple intimation a conversation
took place, the facts were ascertained, and the case was disposed
of But granting it to be done m England, was lttobedone
here? Were they to attempt to exercise autnonty which would
ensure then being laughed at? Were they to putthem&elveb
ma predicament in which the Pre&iJent might ted them that he
did not chose to act upon their petition9
This remedy would be still worse than the other, and however
contumeliously the gentleman from Massachusetts might be
disponed to treat his aigument, the gentleman's own sense of re
presentative dignity would induce him to pause before he went
to tre Executive with a recommendation which migh  be re-
jected if the President pleased The gentleman fiom Ma^a
chusetts had sard that the individual implicated would not be
heard Was the individual heard m similar proceedings m
England!   There w is no bearing there
But this mo ion, if adopted now, would havetohe reviewed
when they got the bill back into the House, and time, therefore,
would bQ affor led to the person to make his defence He (Mr
Ingersoll) had not foimed his opinion, but as at present ad-
vised he was very much inclined, when any memherofCon
gress made such chaiges as the gentleman fiom Ohio had made
onhisrepresentativeresponbibility and no member rose to say
a word rn vindication oi extenuation—though it might be a
choice of difficulty to condemn aman unheard— he <*hou d
pause before he felthim elf authorized to refu&e his stippoi*. to
such a mo ion
Mr EVEIlhlT said they were called on in a quest on of ap
propnation to examine mtograve chaises on the gentleman
1 >r whom the appropriation was to be made, and the gentleman
from Pennsylvania [Mr Ingmí&oll] had said he was very much
inclined to heed the accusation, because u came from a member
on his own representative responsibility Thechaige was not
made on the gentleman's own responsibility, but on certain ru
mors derived from the newspaper*
Mr MEDIIL explained The gentleman ficm New\ork
[Mr Morcan] had done him iniusttce when he said that he (Mr
Mkdill) had read from newspapeis these chaiges He has re
lied on the lepoitand it,&o!utions rn the Legislature of Wiscon
sin, which was amaitei oí public record, an I had only referred
to a handbill co itatning the pi oceedrngs of a Whig meeting, one
of the resolutions adopted by which was, that they would send
an account of then proceedings to every membei oí Cungrts*
He had read from n   newspapers
Mr EVERFTT did not think thpre was much more author 
ty rn a handbill than in a newspaper He said that these chaiges
derived no additional weight fiom the circumstance of a mem
ber presenting them to this Honse, because the gentleman had
not made them on his own knowledge The gentleman from
Pennsylvania had said "rumor" was sufficient ground to act
on Rumor was sufficient «i und to proceed in inquiry, but
n>t for the definite action of ih «.Hon^e This was a transaction
of an old date, it had been the subject of examination He
had understood from "rumoi' tint the nomma'ion of the gei
tieman, when befoie the Senate, was very severely at tac ke I
and every thing that could bp bioueht against it was brought
up Hi  conclusion was that theie was no foundation for this
rumor
He was not here to defend Mi Doty He knew nothing
of the facts of the case, but spoke of it meiely as presented
to him asa member of this House The motion was (o strike
out an. appn pnation for a salary authorized by law I he
gentleman had bar 1 they ha 1 the power to refuse it True,
they had the physical jower todo it, but would it not be vio
lating then moral obligations? Was notevery member of this
House bound hy the law of the land a<; much as any citizen? and
was not the law of the land authorizing this s laiy binding on
themi Here they were asked to do monstrous injustice to "n
individual on a member'*, ns ft$ and making heavy charges
against him witbouany pioofto sustain the chaige« He was
not new prepared to go with the gentleman fiom Massachusetts
in raying that it was competent fm this limítelo make an ad

Item i*io 110, for contingent expeises of the (Wisconsin')
Tes«itorv $350—
The CHAIRMAN det ded should be stucken out, under the
general ordet to strikeout all contingencies
Mr INGERSOI h referred to the provision of the law for the
appropriation of $350 annually for the contingent expenses of
this Territory, and contended that this, in relation to this Hou>e,
was a specific appropriation, although in its final expenditure
it was a contingent one, and therefore should be retained.
The CHAIRMAN reviewed his deci&ion, and pronounced the
Hem in order
Mr MOORE of Louisiana moved to strike out the word
"contingent"                              ,,.« «
Afterabnef conversation en this subject by Messrs   J   R.
IN GERSOLL, PR OFF1T and MOOR E—
The amendment of Mr Moore was rejected
The Clerk having arrived in the reading of the bill to the items
ofappropnation for Iowa Territory—
AtthesuggestronofMr LEVY, who stated that the Delegate
from Iowa [Mi Dodge] was detained from the House by
indisposition—by general consent, these items were passed in-
formally
Iiem No 151 having been read, as follows
For compensation and mileage oithe members of the Legis*
lative Council, (of Florida,) pay of officeie stationery, fuel,
printing, rent, furmtuie, and all other incidental and contingent
object*, S27,125—
Mr LEVY moved an amendment to strike out $27,125, and
insert 34,140
Mr L said his motion was to reinstate the appropriation
asked for by the Executive Department He had not been able
to leain on what ground the appropriation had been reduced
below the estimate by the Committee of "Ways and Means, ex'
cept that the amount proposed was what was appi opriated last
year He briefly urged that the wholeamount proposed by his
amendment was necessary
Mr J R INGERSOLL explained that the amount flxedby
law for this object was not definite, and that the Committee of
Ways and Means had inserted the same sum as was appropn
ated last year, knowing of no reason for its increase
Mr LEVY asked whether the amount was precisely stated in
the law or irof* He claimed that it was the duty of this com-
rrittee to makeadequate provision foi the Government oithe
Territory
Mr L «aid that the appropriation of the last year, not being
sufficient, there were arrearges, to the amounthe proposed to
add, now to be provided (or—and among o hers, instanced the
Speaker and member  of the Legislature, wl o had not been
able to get then pay in consequence of the money that waa ap
propnated falling short
After some remarks from'Mr STANLY, the amendment was
reiected.
Mr PROFFIT moved to amend the item by adding ®5,000,
and briefly advocated the motion He stated as a fact, that a
member from North Carol na, noíf in the House, had in his
possession the celt ificates o I the members ofthe Council of Flo
nda, for the pay due them lotheamount of $2000, andjustica
to them required that itshouid he piovidedf r
Mr AR1UNGTON said, m corroboration of the declaration
of the gentleman from Indi ma, [Mr Ppofiit] he would state
foi the information of the House, that he had in his possession
daims due to the memueisof the Legislative Council ofFJo.
nda and to one of the enrolling and engrossing clerks, for their
servneaat thp session ending 4thofMaich, 1&41, amounting to
upwards of S2 000, and that he had presented their claims at
the Tiea«uiy Department for payment and had receivedan an
swei which he would send to the CJerl^ e table tobe read for the
information ofthe House The reading having been completed,
Mr A m continuaron, observed that it would be perceived by
the House that the j ustne°s of these claims had been acknow-
ledged at the proper Department, and the only reason stated
why they could not then be paid, was that the appropriation
made at a foimer session was insufficient Should thisappropn-
ati in be now rejected, the individuals to whom the^e claims are
now due will have to eo before the Commit eeof Claims, and a
special act will have tobe parsed for their benefit before they
can be paid This wai a system of economy and retrenchment
to which he could not subscribe II therefore hoped that the
appropiiation would be increased $1 650, if no more, to pay for
services already due to members ol the Leeislam e Council of
Finn la
Mr STANLY inquired if this amount due could not be taken
out ofthe proposed apprnpnaiion?
Mr J R IN GERSOLL said the amount ofthe appropriation
had been made up hy the Committee of Ways and Means from
various Hems, exclusive of these arreaiages, which, however
just to be appiopnated for by Congie«s, the committee had
thought came mnre properly new m the shape of a claim on
Congress, or a pai ticular application to Congress
Mi C H WILLIAM  said he was sa'is,fied that this appro
pnation ought to be increased, and hoped the gentleman from
Indiana [Mr PnofriT] would lBciease the amount in his amend
mentto$7 015
Mr rilOI TIT asien ed to this, and accordmglv modified his
amendment so as to add 4? 015 in the amount of the item
