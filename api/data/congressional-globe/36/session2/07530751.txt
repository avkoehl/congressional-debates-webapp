SECESSION OF LOUISIANA.
The SPEAKER. The Chair asks the permis-

man from Louisiana, [Mr. Taylor,] who desires
to make a few observations.
No objection was made.
Mr. TAYLOR. Mr. Speaker, I send to the
Clerk's desk, in order that it may be read, a copy
of the ordinance of the State of Louisiana, by
which she declares her connection with the Union
now existing between the States to be dissolved.
That ordinance was, I am told, received by the
Senators from the State of Louisiana, on Satur-
day last. It was not communicated to me, nor
had I any knowledge of its having arrived in this
city, till it was casually mentioned by a gen tie-
man whom I motin the court-ioom ofthc Supreme
Court of the United States, yesterday morning.
I then went into the Senate Chamber, and there
the fact was announced that the ordinance had
been passed, and an official copy of it was sent to
the Secretary's desk and was read. I have taken
the liberty of obtaining from the Senate an exact
copy of that instrument, and I now ask permis-
sion of the House, that the copy which I have pro-
cured be read, and that when read, the House will
indulge me in saying something on this most ex-
traordinary and momentous occasion.
The Clerk read, as follows:
An.ordinancc to dissolve the union between the State of Lou-
isiana and other States united with her, under the compact
entitled " The Constitution of the United States of Amer-
ica.'*
We. the people of the State ofLouisiana, in convention
assembled, do declare and oidan^and it is hereby declared
and oidained, that the oidinance passed by u-; in convention
on the 22d day of November, in the year 1811. whereby the
Constitution of the United States of America, and the
amendments of said Constitution, were adopted, and all
laws and ordinances by winch the State of Louisiana be-
came a member of the Federal Union, be, and the same are
hereby, repealed and abrogated; and that the union now
subsisting between Louisiana and other States, under the
name of the " United States of America," is hereby dis-
solved.
We do further declare and ordain, that the State of Lou-
isiana hereby resumes all rights and powers heretofore del-
egated to the Government of the United States of Amenca;
that her citizens aie absolved from all allegiance to t^aid
Government; and that bhe is in full possession and exer-
cise of all tho e rights of sovereignty which appertain to a
free and independent Siate.
We do lurther deolaie and ordain, that all rights acquired
and vested under the Constitution of the United States, or
any act of Congress-, or treaty, or under any law ot this
State and not incompatible with this otdmunee, bhall re-
main m force and have tile same effect as if this ordinance
had not been passed.
The undersigned hereby ceitified that the above ordi-
nance is a true copy of the original ordinance adopted tbs
day by the convention of the State of Louisiana,
Given under iny hand and the great seal of Louisiana, at
Baton Rouge, this 26th day of the month Of January, in the
vear of our Lord, 1661. -
[l. s.] A. MOTJTON,
President of the Convention,
J. Thomas Wheat, Secretary of the Convention.
Mr. SPINNER. Has that paper been re-
ceived, Mr, Speaker? and does it go on the Jour-
nal ?
The SPEAKER. It does not. It is read as
part of the remarks of the gentleman from Lou-
isiana.
Mr. SPINNER. Well; I think it is high time
to put a stop to this countenancing of treason in
the Halls of legislation. If I can object to it, I
certainly do.
The SPEAKER. The gentleman from Lou-
isiana will proceed, by unanimous consent.
Mr. TAYLOR. Mr. Speaker, and gentlemen
of the House of Representatives, the act which
it is my purpose to perform, of withdrawingfrom
this assemblage of the. Representatives of the
American people,in obedience to the willof the
people of my State, is one of no ordinary occur-
rence, and it is one which impresses me with feel-
ings of the gravest and most profound anxiety.
With the permission of the House, I will take the
liberty of saying that which occurs to my mind
in regard to the condition in which we are now
placed as a people, and in regard to what is before
us in the future. I shall not cast any look back-
ward. I shall make no observations on the occur-
rences that have produced the results now before
us. 1 shall only speak of the present position of
this great country, and the future which is about
to open upon us.
We, the Representatives of the greatest Repub-
lic which the world has ever yet seen, the Repre-
sentatives of a people who, in the ordinary course
of Providence, were destined to become the great-
est the world has ever yet known, are now wit-
nessing the dissolution of a mighty frame of Gov-
ernment. Within the last few weeks, we have
seen State after State leaving this Union formed
by our fathers for the common good of all. We
know that that has been caused by differences of
opinion between the inhabitants of two portions
of this Confederacyâ€”differences of opinion that
have grown out of the change of sentiment aris-
ing out of a change in the situation of the people
of a portion of the States. Without speaking of
those circumstances, without speaking of the facts
that have led to the display of these differences,
it is enough for me to say that these differences
are of such a character that the people of a large
portion of the United States, the people of a num-
ber of the sovereign States, have arrived at the
conclusion that they can no longer remain mem-
bers of this Union with safety to themselves and
to their rights of property, unless changes are made
in the constitutional law of the land which will
meet the changes that have taken place in the sit-
uation of a portion of our peopleâ€”which will meet
the changes that have taken place in the feelings
and views of a portion of the States, and restore
the Union to the condition in which it was when
it was framed, by erecting positive barriers which
will restrain the action of the people, and of the
departments of the Federal Government, within
the boundaries set to that action by the public
sentiment of the country when the Government
went into operation.
There are now pending before this House a
variety of propositions reported from a committee
composed of members of all the States of which
this Union consisted when this Congress assem-
bled. Their passage has been urged on this House
by different individuals, under the influence, un-
doubtedly, of the most patriotic motjyves, in the
expectation that their passage would be attended
with public advantage, and would be likely to
compose the differences that now divide us. Mr.
Speaker, I was a member of that committee. I
was one of those who dissented from the minority
that reported these propositions to the House.
In a report which I presented as the organ of the
minority, I expressed the grounds of my dissent
from the views of those who supported them in
the committee, and now favor their adoption. My
belief to-day is what it was then; and, in my judg-
ment, standing in the position which I now oc-
cupy, I owe it to myself, I owe it to the people
of Louisiana, I owe it to you, and to the people of
