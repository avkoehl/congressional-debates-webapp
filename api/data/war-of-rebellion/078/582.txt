DUBLIN, May 6, 1864.

Major General John C. BRECKINRIDGE:

Brigadier General J. H. Morgan has been relieved from duty in Department of East Tennessee and ordered to report to you. Order just received by mail. Colonel King received the following order, viz:

Major-General Breckinridge will select two batteries from Thirteenth Virginia Battalion Artillery for duty in the department, after which Lieutenant-Colonel King will proceed by railroad with the two remaining batteries and report to General Lee for assignment with Brigadier-General Alexander's artillery corps.

Copy of this not yet sent to you direct. Colonel King very anxious to go. What are your orders in regard to him and Morgan? Dickenson's battery, and not Davidson's, will be here to-night? If order in regard to King's battalion is correct, and you must select one other battery, King desires to take Otey's and Lowry's batteries with him, and will wait your order here. Will inform General Jenkins of the order in regard to Morgan. Large fleet of transports reported at City Point. Seems nothing certain from General Lee.

Brigadier General J. C. VAUGHN, Commanding Cavalry:

GENERAL: I am directed by the brigadier-general commanding to say that you will establish your line of observation so as to cover the front and right flank of our advance position-Carter's, Zollicoffer, and Kingsport-so as to protect the depots at Bristol. If another line suggests itself to you, which can accomplish the same ends, adopt it and notify these headquarters. It is desired that your troops should be so disposed as to be foraged easily from the railroad. Although an expedition to the front is not desired just at this time yet scouting parties should observe the country toward Knoxville and Cumberland Gap. I deem it proper to add that there are strong indications of a heavy cavalry raid by the enemy from the direction of the mouth of Sandy and the Kanawha. Should this occur, have your command well in hand, so as to be put in motion without delay.

I am, general, your obedient servant,

J. N. GALLEHER,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

J. N. GALLEHER,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
