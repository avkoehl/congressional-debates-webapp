(Received 9 a. m.)

General WEBER:

The enemy is attacking our lines. Second some infantry with your cavalry forward in the direction of Charlestown to reconnoiter and try to find out by scouts whether the enemy comes in large force from Winchester. Until now we have only to do with his cavalry.

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS RESERVE DIVISION,Near Shepherdstown, July 3, 1864-10 p. m.

General WEBER:

The troops of Martinsburg and Leetown are here, and will cross the river to-night. The enemy took possession of Martinsburg at about 1 p. m. to-day. The rebels are now reported to be marching on Williamsport. Major-General Ransom's rebel cavalry is in Colonel Mulligan's immediate front near Shepherdstown. I shall march to Harper's Ferry at 2 a. m. to-morrow if the troops arrive promptly here so that I can move them. The enemy's forces outflanked us on every side. He was in the rear of Martinsburg before any troops had moved out. My force consists of two old regiments infantry, two and a half regiments Ohio National Guard, some dismounted cavalry used as infantry, ten pieces of artillery, and 1,500 cavalry. We had a strong force of the enemy against us. Colonel Mulligan fought the enemy all day, but was compelled to retire, necessitating our evacuation of Martinsburg. Our losses are not know, but great damage will be done to the railroad.

Respectfully,

F. SIGEL,

Major-General.
