CAMP PEMBERTON, March 2, 1863.

Lieutenant-General PEMBERTON:

The bearer of flag of truce to enemy, at [Yazoo] Pass, on 26th, reports: Saw six stern-wheel and one side-wheel gunboats near where Pass empties into Coldwater. No gunboat had yet been in Coldwater, and tug had passed into Coldwater and returned; intention to bring gunboats through evident. About 7,000 troops on Pass. Large number transports in Moon Lake. Enemy's gunboats have 24-pounder in bow, with iron plating to protect.
