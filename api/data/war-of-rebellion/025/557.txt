If the officer or soldier, camp-follower or steamboat hand, passenger, or any person with this army violate the laws of Congress and orders of the President it is the duty of everybody to seize him and deliver him forcibly and sternly to this provost guard.

That Colonel Hoge may execute this order thoroughly he will camp near these headquarters, and use some steamboat-hold or house in which to confine prisoners.

Prisoners found in possession of stolen, horses, mules, saddles, muskets, rifles, shot-guns, or any species of property by the United States forces will, while awaiting trial, be confined to bread and water, unless the chief surgeon of one or other of the divisions certifies that the health of the prisoner is endangered thereby.

The commanding general appeals to the good officers and soldiers, of whom he is proud to know his corps is mostly composed, to aid him in bringing to condign punishment the cowardly rascals who hang back when danger threatens, but are foremost in stealing, robbing, and plundering.

Twenty-four hours' notice is given that those in doubt may turn in property not their own; after that this order must be rigorously enforced.
