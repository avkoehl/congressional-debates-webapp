HDQRS. SIXTH ARMY CORPS, May 14, 1864-2.15 p. m.

General MEADE:

Dispatch of 1 p. m. received, and instructions will be promptly carried out. I advanced my skirmish line about 300 yards this morning, and about an hour ago ordered its advance in connection with Warren's left. I also ordered Neil to seize the bridge over the Ny to his front and left, where there are some rebel cavalry.

H. G. WRIGHT,Brigadier-General.

MAY 14, 1864.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

The enemy came on in strong force. I saw three lines, the last being a long one. I am disposing the corps so as to hold the Anderson house position. Possibly the enemy may attempt to turn my left, in which case I may need aid. It strikes me as the critical point.

H. G. WRIGHT,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

MAY 14, 1864.

Major-General WRIGHT:

Send word to your infantry now advancing, to be very careful not to fire into my men, who are going toward the house from here; you will lap over them.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.

General WRIGHT:

Can you not put some artillery on the high hill north of the Ny River, at the large house (Anderson's), commanding the position Colonel Upton was driven from?
