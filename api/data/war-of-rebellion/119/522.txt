CONFEDERATE STATES OF AMERICA, WAR DEPARTMENT,

Richmond, November 14, 1863.

Brigadier General S. A. MEREDITH, Agent of Exchange:

SIR: I have been informed by Lieutenant Colonel N. G. Watts, assistant agent of exchange, by letter bearing date November 1, 1863, that he had made application for the paroled prisoners who remained in Vicksburg to be sent within our lines, and was informed by Lieutenant-Colonel Strong, chief of Major-General McPherson's staff, that orders had been given for them to be sent North. The prisoners were left in Vicksburg because they were too sick to be removed at the time of the surrender. This refusal to deliver the prisoners is in direct violation of the terms of surrender. They number 118.

I will thank you to inform me at the very earliest day whether it is the intention of your Government to retain these men. If I do not receive a reply within a reasonable and proper time the Confederate Government will feel itself justified in consequence of the official nature of the communication in concluding that your authorities have determined not to release these prisoners on their parole.

Respectfully, &amp;c.,

RO. OULD,

Agent of Exchange.

RICHMOND, VA., November 14, 1863.

Brigadier General S. A. MEREDITH, Agent of Exchange:

SIR: The rations, including the candles, will be served to your men, the latter, of course, subject to such regulations as may be imposed by the prison authorities.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

RO. OULD,

Agent of Exchange.

RICHMOND, VA., November 14, 1863.

I do not know of a solitary case in which any officer or soldier is so held. That, however, will not long be the case unless our officers and soldiers in your custody are relieved from their close confinement. No other persons than Captains Flinn and Sawyer are held for the unjust execution of Corbin and McGraw.

Respectfully, &c.,

RO. OULD,

Agent of Exchange.

Brigadier General S. A. MEREDITH, Agent of Exchange:

SIR: Brigadier General Neal Dow proved himself to be an utterly inefficient agent of distribution of clothing. In addition he has shamefully broken his word of honor in not confining himself exclusively to that work in his intercourse with the prisoners. For these reasons our
