(Via train from Manassas 3d.)

Brigadier General J. W. GEARY,

Commanding, Rectortown, Va., near Piedmont:

The telegraph line between here and Winchester by the way of Harper's Ferry is down. It is therefore important that communication with Generals Banks and Shields should immediately be established by the way of Manassas and Strasburg. You will at once establish a line of mounted couriers between Front Royal and Strasburg to carry messages every four hours, leaving the respective places alternately every two hours. You will also establish at Front Royal a telegraph office, to be kept constantly open night and day until line is completed through to Strasburg.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

General W. B. FRANKLIN,Cheeseman's Landing:

Have your division ready to move to the front to-morrow. Come up in the morning with a staff officer to select a camp, probably near the Methodist Church. Dine with me at 3 o'clock to-morrow to meet Captain Smith of the Navy. Do not move your division until you see me, but have it ready to move when you so order it. Would you like Paterson for a brigadier?

Flag-Officer L. M. GOLDSBOROUGH,

Hampton Roads:

It is probable that I will be able to open a very heavy fire on Monday morning - certainly by Tuesday morning. I think the gun-boats can pass the batteries any dark night. They certainly can after a day's firing on our part. I have proposed to Captain Smith that he shall run by the night after we open. Rodgers will I suppose, be available for the same purpose. I think the effect of such a movement will be to enable me to gain possession of Yorktown on the second or third day. Can you spare for this decisive attack some more vessels? It is all-important to make this blow a sure one.
