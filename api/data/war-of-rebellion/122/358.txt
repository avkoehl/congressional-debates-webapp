Governor CURTIN,

Harrisburg, Pa.:

Send the troops to their different camps or to their homes, and let them be paid there. What is the meaning of all this trouble?

SIMON CAMERON,

Secretary of War.

HARRISBURG, July 27, 1861.

Honorable S. CAMERON:

The troops have no camp equipage or cooking utensils. The town is full, and Negley's brigade on the way. The paymasters are threatened with violence, and the people in the town much alarmed. We have offered to take a power of attorney to Judge Pearson to draw the money and send the men from here. The paymasters were unwilling yesterday, and are not here to-day. We have blanks and tickets and clerks all ready, and if you say the arrangements shall be carried out, we can settle the disturbance at once. Something must be done. We have not force to protect the town and property here. The money in Adams Express office is in danger. Answer immediately.

A. G. CURTIN,

Governor.

I have telegraphed to Colonel Rowley to get transportation from Pennsylvania Railroad Company and move his men to Pittsburg. Send all other disbanded troops to nearest point of their respective homes. Paymasters will settle with them as rapidly as possible.

We sent Rowley with sixteen companies off at 3 o'clock. The town is quiet now. I hope things will go on better to-morrow. We encamped the Fourteenth and Fifteenth at Carlisle.
