WASHINGTON, June 6, 1865-11. 30 a. m.

Major-General POPE, Saint Louis, Mo.:

Will your require more cavalry after distributing the cavalry horses in your command to dismounted men? Two brigade are under orders for the West, but the roads are now so much used that it may be several days before they start.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
HEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSOURI, Saint Louis, Mo., June 6, 1865.

Lieutenant General U. S. GRANT, Washington, D. C.:

I think one brigade more will answer the purpose in this division. One of the brigade you allude to as being under orders for the West will be enough. Nearly all the troops now in Missouri are mustered out by late orders. We shall require very few in the State for the future, probably none at all by October 1.

JOHN. POPE,Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSOURI, Saint Louis, Mo., June 6, 1865.

Lieutenant General U. S. GRANT, Washington, D. C.:

Does the amnesty proclamation of the 29th of May change or modify Special Orders, No. 215, paragraph 9, Headquarters of the Army? There are hundreds of men constantly arriving here from the late rebel armies who expect to avail themselves of Order 215, but who appear to be excepted by the tenth article of the amnesty proclamation of May 29. An immediate decision of this question is very necessary, as we are daily pressed by this class of men, and it is not known exactly what to do.

JOHN. POPE,

Major-General
HEADQUARTERS ARMIES OF THE UNITED STATES, Washington, June 6, 1865.

Major-General POPE, Saint Louis, Mo.:

Returning prisoners to be entitled to remain in any of the loyal States, Missouri, for instance, must become loyal men; that is, take the last oath prescribed.

U. S. GRANT,Lieutenant-General.

Please instruct me how to answer following telegram. You will see the necessity of an answer being given to-day. *
