Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief, U. S. Army, Washington, D. C.:

SIR: I have the honor to report my arrival here yesterday.

Major-General Hunter relinquished, and I assumed, command yesterday.

I have conversed freely with Major Duane and with several navy officers in reference to the recent attack on the forts in Charleston Harbor, and the present condition of affairs in that direction.

The concurrent testimony is that the defenses on Morris Island have undergone a material change within the last three weeks, much to the advantage of the enemy.

I shall visit that vicinity to-morrow, and make a full report by next steamer.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
