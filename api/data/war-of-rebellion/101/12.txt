reach Perryville on account of high water, Fourche la Fave bottom being overflowed. Lieutenant-Colonel Steele's command returned to Lewisburg on the evening of the 11th. On the night of the 12th instant I ordered Lieutenant Wylie, Third Arkansas Cavalry, to proceed with fifty dismounted men of the Third Arkansas Cavalry, and fifty infantry of the Eleventh U. S. Colored, on steamer Alamo, to land on west side of Petit Jean Creek; if the landing be effected safely, to send steamer, with flat-boats, to north side of river, to cross detachment of Third Arkansas Cavalry. The landing was effected safely, and cavalry crossed on morning of 13th. Same evening Major Jenks, First Iowa Cavalry, commanding detachment of dismounted men of Cavalry Division, Seventh Army Corps, namely, 276 men, reported for duty. They arrived on steamers Ad. Hines and Lotus. I ordered the major to proceed with steamers and his command up river till arriving at the Alamo, where he would learn from Lieutenant Wylie if it was safe for the steamers to push on to Fort Smith. At 10 p. m. the steamers Annie Jacobs and Chippewa arrived, with one section of the Second Kansas Battery,* Lieutenant Phillips commanding. I sent them forward immediately, with orders to report to Major Jenks, near Galla Rock. I had calculated that Lieutenant-Colonel Steele's movement toward Perryville would keep the enemy in that vicinity for a short time, and that before they would learn of his withdrawal and of the subsequent move up the river sufficient time would be gained to enable the boats to pass Dardanelle in safety. At the same time I felt assured the enemy would move onto the river at or above Dardanelle as soon as they learned of the boats passing Lewisburg, and unless checked at or near Dardanelle would overtake the boats before they could reach Spadra. The arrival of the section of artillery decided me in ordering Major Jenks to occupy Dardanelle with his command. He did so, landing his forces at 10 o'clock the morning of the 14th instant, the last of the fleet passing there at 12 m. At 2 o'clock same date the enemy, 1,500 strong, and one piece of artillery, under the command of Colonels Brooks, Stirman, and Newton, attacked the place. Major Jenks placed his men in the stockade, and after four hours' hard fighting the enemy withdrew, completely whipped. Our loss during the engagement was 1 killed, 15 wounded, and 2 missing. Enemy's loss, 1 commissioned officer killed, and about 80 men killed and wounded. Major Jenks speaks in the highest terms of the officers and men under his command, all doing gallant service. The artillery, under the direction of Lieutenant Phillips and Lieutenant Campbell, Third U. S. Cavalry (acting adjutant), being skillfully handled, firing 164 rounds. Expecting the attack to be renewed next morning, Major Jenks called for re-enforcements and supply of ammunition. I immediately ordered Major Mason, with sixty men, Third Arkansas Cavalry, with supply of ammunition, to report to Major Jenks as soon as practicable; also Lieutenant-Colonel Steele, with 100 men, of the Eleventh U. S. Colored Infantry, in wagons, to follow as rapidly as possible; and, placing everything at Lewisburg in proper position, proceeded to Dardanelle, arriving there the same day. The enemy did not renew the attack, but proceeded up the south side of the river after the boats; but they were too late, the boats being beyond their reach. On the morning of the 15th instant Lieutenant-Colonel Cooper, with Fortieth Iowa Infantry and one section of Fifth Ohio Battery, arrived on steamer
