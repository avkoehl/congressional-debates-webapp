HEADQUARTERS CAVALRY DIVISION,Farmer's, November 29, 1864-4. 20 p. m.

Lieutenant HUDSON,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General:

LIEUTENANT: My latest intelligence places the enemy marching toward Waynesborough in heavy force. Captain Humphreys states that a scout on the Pugeley's Bridge road failed to discover the enemy in twelve miles. I stopped Lewis' brigade at Walker's Bridge, with instructions to guard all the bridges from that down. Hannon is at Farmer's Bridge, covering the river above. I will have all General Wheeler's instructions carried out.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

ALFRED IVERSON,

Brigadier-General.

AUGUSTA, GA., November 29, 1864.

Major General SAM. JONES:

Have you any spare arms? Can send you near 1,000 Yankee prisoners, if you can arm and use them. Savannah River should be rigidly patrolled as high up as the mouth of Brier Creek. Pocotaligo will probably be the point aimed at.

BRAXTON BRAGG.

AUGUSTA, November 29, 1864-11. 40 a. m.

General SAMUEL JONES:

Make every disposition possible to prevent the enemy from ascending Broad River and cutting the Savannah railroad. All your movable force should assemble in that vicinity.

BRAXTON BRAGG.
