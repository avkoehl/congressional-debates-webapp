Major-General SCHOFIELD:

The telegraphic dispatch in the Republican of the 30th, from Leavenworth, stating that the "Moss men" are driving Union men out of Missouri, &amp;c., is totally and maliciously false.

HEADQUARTERS,Fayetteville, Ark., October 1, 1863-1.50 p.m.

Major-General SCHOFIELD:

I have just received advices that the force said to be Shelby's, of which I telegraphed General McNeil yesterday, camped last night year Huntsville. Women who are loyal say they counted 1,260 as they passed; that they marched four deep; that about 900 were armed, and that they had three pieces of artillery, one supposed to be a 12-pounder, the others smaller; that two guns were brass and one iron. They took the road toward Bentonville this morning, and reported themselves going into Missouri; that they were to be joined by 1,200 more on the way; that Cabell and others were crossing their men to the north side of the Arkansas River in small squads near Roseville and Ozark. I had expected an attack here, but think now they intend to cut me off and attack Cassville. Look out for them. The women report a large number of them in Federal uniform.

Major-General SCHOFIELD:

I have just seen your dispatch to Halleck about Major-General Blunt. If possible, you better allow me to get through with a certain matter here before adding to the difficulties of it. Meantime supply me the particulars of Major-General Blunt's case.

A. LINCOLN.
