marched, seventy-two miles. Remained in Fayetteville guarding the place until the evening of the 15th of March, when we took up the line of march of Goldsborough, this division being in charge of the entire train of the corps. The bad character of the roads and the unwieldiness of the trains rendered our progress necessarily slow. On the evening of the 19th of March, having crossed Great Cohera Creek, we heard cannonading in the direction of Bentonville; distance marched, thirty-two miles. March 20, at daylight trains in charge of Third Brigade, with that of Colonel Hunter, marched six miles to the scene of the battle of the 19th, near Bentonville; arriving on the field we took up our position, but did not become engaged. With the exception of two men of the Second Minnesota, who were wounded by the enemy's artillery, we sustained no loss. March 21 was spent in repairing roads, and on the 23rd moved on Goldsborough where we arrived on the 23rd; distance marched, twenty-five miles.

During the campaign our troops have subsisted themselves on the country through which we have passed with the exception of one-third ration of bread, sugar, and coffee, which they have marched nearly trains. During the whole campaign, wherein we have marched nearly 500 mils and overcome difficulties perhaps without a parallel, the officers and men of this command, with scarcely an exception, have exhibited the most admirable, and untiring patience, energy, and perseverance, and I am happy to tender them my most sincere thanks for the cheerful and hearty manner in which they have performed their whole duty on this long and laborious march.

Annexed is a condensed report of our losses in wounded and missing, and reported by regimental commanders.

I am, captain, very respectfully, your obedient servant.

THOS. DOAN,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding Brigade.
