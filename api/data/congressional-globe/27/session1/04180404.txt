•would do bis best to let him have it He would
not, however, dunn? h>s answer, object to the Se
nator's taking a pmeh of snuff, or turning t  a
friend to a^k atjnes'ion. If the Senator should do
these things; he (W r Buchanan) should not com-
plain. The Senator objects that he (Mr. Buchanan)
stands with the strong party. Hebeieved hedid, for
he st^od with the same party assise Senator, and he
hoped it would long continue the strong party
He advocated the placing of raihoad iron on the
same footing as other imported iron, not from any
sectional feeling towards his own 9*ate, but because
it would be for the benefit of all the Sta es of the
Union. If this Government had appropriated
$500,000 per annum, according o the official s a'e-
«neats given by the Senator frcm Connecticut [Mr
Huntington,] by exempting iron from duty, f r
the use of railroads was not tbos a direct appro-
priation for the benefi of the railroad corpora-
tions? If the Senator had this «.idi  of the ¡>r_u-
ntent he would íañke the Senate rewound with the
plea that all duties must be equ.il and uniforn,
and n<«ta duty of twenty per cent, levied on mo4
o( the imports, while the article was of all the test
exempted. The doctrine ot "ves ed rights,," al-
* \>st, had been brought forwaid by the Senators
from Georgia The very same argument would
.apply to any change whatever in the tariff, because
the whole community had made contracts, under
the existing rate oí tar.ff, which they supposed
would continue The que tton was withm a nut-
shell; what was if? We were blessed with a coun-
try abounding with coal and ore,?quailed by none.
The art of smelting iron with anthracite coal wSs
mjre understood, and the representatives of the
States having this coal and ore, vere asked to
agree to ha?e the foreign article cooae in free of
doty, while all other import  were taxed twenty
per cent, and th*.t because this was wanted for .rail-
roads. The domestic lailroad non could be ob-
tained as cheap, and of as gord a quality as the
foreign article. Why .hoold mis aitiole alcne be
exempted from duty?
Mr. CALHOUN obse-ied that one of hr argu-
ments against the c'istiibation bul was, tha> ii
■would take ,from the people more in taxes
tnan it gave to the Sutes m dtstubution In
reply to the argnm°r>t of the S^na'or from
Pennsylvania, he coa' , ctd that no rau^e
could justify the imp m ton of a duty of 20 I
per cent ad va'orem, on rail'oal tro i, w'mh I
would be ruinous to th* ínteres of the Southern
States. Raw hide-, by th b II, ha I b enixemoted
from daty, but what greater reism was thee for
the exemption oí this aitude lro n duty than oí rail-
road iron.
Mr. BUCHtNAN con ended than foreign hides
came in no competition wi h dome.tic, but were
required f r manufai ture in this to mtr>, it was for
our benefit that th*y should be imported, but this
was not the case with iron; there w rt most ample
supplies of that, and coal connected with it, in
* quantities sufficient tor the use of the country, and
as cheap as it could be imported He hoppd the

Mr. CUTH >ERT sat 1 ihe purpose of the law

Mr. HUNTINGTON said he was influenced by

offered it f r tne benefit of those corporations of the
Senator's and other States, which had sent their or-

Mr KING contended that this notice o irht in

of all goods a*- well as of rai road iron Thii

I Mc CLAY of Ktnl tcky said Penatois an th 
other side had expi-^id m ich hope that the °ev
ston shout I termínale, and yet three hours had
hern occupied on thu single amendment relating to
i on one article of the many in the bill. If they
wished t> rdj urn, let them act on these measures.
Until this bill was decided on, and the Bank bill,
they wonld fix no day for adjournment. If gentle-
men on the other side would let the measures be
disposed of, he would then unite with them in
fixing a time to adjourn.
As to this amendmr-n the law was passed free-
ing iron from duty, wb n the Treasury wss over-
flowing, this was not now the case, and all lhat
ought to be done wis to allow companies which
had undertaken their works undfr the consideia-
Uon of the law, to have equal benefits of the law,
and then to repeal the act. He shou'd vote for the
amendment to the amendment, and the amend-
ment uself.
H would make a prediction to the gentlemen
on the other «ide, and if it be fulfilled, as he was
perfectly satisfied it would, it will be an mdisputa
b'e demonstration of fh  wisdom of the principle
ot protection It was, that there being now nearly

Mr. CALHOUN rose simniy o s ate that t^p

He uses precisely the same language nosv that he
did twemy jear.s agí, and all knew the resj't of
his predictions of that diy He, Mr C could not
c jrsent to ta ie his predictions, and he was pretty
sure nobody el=e wou'd. The Senator has pro-
fessed his detrimmat on to continue this session,
