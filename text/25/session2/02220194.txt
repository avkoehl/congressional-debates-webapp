(Mr riAv>suü that he would pi efergwmg the pre-emption
to theae Jaudd to the ~*tate insvead of giving it to individuals,
and that, m consequence of the increased value given to them
by settlements around them, and a denso population, he would
ask three oi torn dollars an acre Now he (Mr K ) would not
bargain m that way with on  of the States of this Union If,
said ho, wo give the lands to the State, let us give them hbe
rally He had moie feeling towards the unfortunate settlors
on the public lands than the Senator from Kentucky He
appieciated the meiits of the pew States, whose works of
internal impiovcmcnt were giving value to the public domain,
yet he had stuma; feehngs foi the settlers They were the
men who hid pei formed thft laboi, whose hard liands had felled
the tiees and cleared the forest, and brought the wilderness
into cultivation, and he would hot hesitate to give them the
p\ efe-renco ovei a State
Mr K said, m conclusion, that he was for first discharging
the Committee on Public Lands iVom the furthei consideiation
ot the memorial, and then the question might subsequently be
taken on i oft lenee to another committee
Mi LINN suggested to the Senatoi fiom Indiana a further
modih>ation, to which he thought both pames might assent, to
wit that the said committee he instructed to repon a bill grant
mg to the States all the unsurveyed lands within their limits
uiveied by water it was will known that laige portions oí
land in some ol the States weie at times coveied with water to
an immense extent, which the Government ofhceis had tepoi ted
is not wouh the cost of emvey IT these lands weie ceded to
the States m which they he it might be attended with the most
bonthti t! le^ults Thobe inundated lands weie a curse to the
¡■HattH thev were the veiy hotbeds of disease, generating that
dreadtulmalanaso fatal m its influence upon the sunounding
lountty Ii all such were given to the States, at leastsuch as
were deemed unwoiihy the cost of suivey they might be re
claimed, so as to pievcut the ill efleets usually ausing from
them
Mi DAVIS said he thought that we were now in a fair way
of diivmg & bat gain m relation to public lands One State
wants tin; land** for puipoies of cairymg on internal impiove
meat while anuthei asks for them thatshemay be allowed to
i* claim suchas the Ooveinment deem worthless Befoie he
could vote lot teihng PHCh lands to the Statos where they lie,
he should like to have all the «ecessaiy information before
turn Mi I> said he had some cxpenence in these matters
vpars ago When In the other branch of the Legislatuie, he
had introduced a plan by wMch the States had given to them,
Mr canals and oihei Improv emente, each alternate section wheie
the improvements tfere The committee had judged, and he
thought widely, that if the improvements were what they
might to be, c it h alternate section would be worth the whole,
and hi was glad to find that hiseaily impiessions weie correct.
Whit he should like to know, howevei, was, whether the
Government or individuals had loceived the benefit Had we
not, b) c peleas leajisluion on this subject given individuals
iKtnso to go on and avail themselves of ill the benefits of
tlwso nnprovcttifnts? It no one else did, h*) would himself
iniiolme aifioliamn íeqmrmg the Committee on the Public
1 amis to hupiue into and íepoit on the matter The question
now was, whethei wo should give the State of Indiana the lands
oi tur improvement*  a the minimum price, and for that he
wis not piepnrcd to vote just now He wanted (urihei in
formation befoie he would it el justified m giving his vote He
mini tie allowed to* ay that he did not considei the leraaika of
the ^enatoi from Alabama aa at all applicable to kirn
Mi Ll AV of Kentucky said he would repeat what he had
«aid m íclation to those people who had gone on the public
lands, and tht y might make the most of it "He had denounced
all) or i ns who had gone on the public lands without the au
thontv of law as mtiudeia and ttespasseie on the public do
mun " That was whit he said, and what he «till maintained ,
and in relation to the Miami lesejve, he would go foi the State
against all those j ersons
Mi I INN expressed himself determined to battle for his
amendment there was no difficulty m ascertaining the Quantity
of Is rid AH had been returned oft the plots surveyed, and a
gentleman fiom Micsouvfhad made a most elaborate and eio
quent repoit on the very subject, one among the most able and
comprehensive document, he would say that had ever emana
ted iiom .my source If public officers had íepoited these
lands not wouh the cost ofsuivoymgjCongiesi, would be giving
very halo
