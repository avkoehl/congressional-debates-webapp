he opened fire from three points with batteries of heavy guns, and placed it under a concentrated fire for many minutes. It was a severe ordeal, and was followed by a charge of a heavy force of infantry; but our gallant troops met the advance with firmness, and, after a severely contested struggle, drove back the advancing column with slaughter and held possession of the coveted position.

In this battle we lost several men and officers, especially of the First Louisiana Regiment (Regulars). Among those who fell mortally wounded was Lieutenant-Colonel [F. H.] Farrar, [jr.] This young officer was one of the most promising of the army, intelligent, chivalrous, and brave. His loss will be felt by his country and lamented by his many friends.

This battle closed the operations of my corps in the field in front of Murfreesborough. By orders from the general commanding, after being eight days under arms, and in actual battle or heavy skirmishing, in the rain and cold without tents and much of the time without fires, my troops were retired from the field and ordered to take up a position near Shelbyville. This they did at their leisure, and in perfectly good order. In all the operations in which they were engaged no troops ever displayed greater gallantry or higher powers of endurance. They captured 1,500 prisoners and 26 guns.

For the details connected with these operations I beg leave to refer to the reports of division, brigade, and regimental commanders. To the same reports, also, I respectfully refer for instances of distinguished gallantry in the case of corps and individuals. I beg leave to refer also to the accompanying statement, marked A, containing a list of the number of men and officers of my corps engaged in the battle; also to B, containing the number of killed, wounded, and missing. I refer also to the accompanying map of the field of battle, marked Bb.* This map was prepared with care by Lieutenant [W. J.] Morris, of the engineers of my corps, from actual survey, and from the reports of the corps commanders of the Federal Army. From these sources he has been enabled to fix the relative positions of the corps, divisions, and brigades of both armies at different periods during the battle with great accuracy. The statements D and B I submit as parts of this report; also the accompanying map, marked Bb.*

To Major-Generals Cheatham and Withers, my division commanders, I am under obligations for their cordial support and active co-operation in conducting the operations of my command; also to the brigade commanders, who, without an exception, managed the parts assigned them in the general programme of the battle with great skill, energy, and judgment. Of the conduct of the regimental, battery, and subordinate commands their immediate commanders will speak in their reports, as they were more directly under their eyes. Our artillery also was well handled when it could be used, but the dense cedar brake into which the enemy was driven continuously prevented it from following our advancing columns. This made it necessary to have the work done chiefly with the musket and the bayonet.

To Major George Williamson, assistant adjutant-general, who was severely wounded in the shoulder; Major Thomas M. Jack, assistant adjutant-general; Lieutenant Colonel T. F. Sevier, inspector-general; Lieutenant P. B. Spence, of the same department; Lieutenant John Rawle, acting chief of ordnance; Captain Felix [H.] Robertson, acting chief of artillery; Captain E. B. Sayers and Lieutenant W. J. Morris, of engineers; Lieutenant W. N. M. Otey, chief of the signal corps; Dr. [W. C.] Cavanaugh, medical director;
