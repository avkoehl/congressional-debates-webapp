ROBERT P LETCHER, Esq , addressed the
House   by peinnssion, in defence of his claim to
Mr L proceeded till twelve o'clock in his re-
mai ks, when
The CHAIR announced that thib day, being
Friday, was setapait, by the rules, after the morn-
ing business, for despatch of private business,
but, with the unanimous consent of the House,
the gentleman could proceed
No objection being made—
Mr Letcher resumed, and continued his re-
marks till afier thiee o'clock He concluded by
expressing, his thanks to the House for the patient
attention which they had afforded him, and by
stating that he was peifectly well satisfied that
the committee, in making a report adverse to his
claim, were not governed by any feeling of un-
kindness to him He also wished to say, not
however with a view to influence the vote of any
member on this question, that he should íespect
fully decline the pay and mileage of a member,
proposed by the committee, in case the House
should determine that he was not entitled to the
contested seat
Mr HAMER rose (he said) merely to make a
motion, and there were too reasons why he made
it The first was, that the gentleman who had
just closed his íemarks had leferieu to, and lead,
a pait of the testimony which related to agieat
number of votéis, and that it seemed necessary
that the gentleman who was to follow him [Mi
Moore] should have some time allowed to him
"1 he other ieason was, that, as his health was in-
firm, he doubted whether he would have sufficient
strength to enable him to go thiough with his reply
this evening
Mr H therefore thought it proper to move an
adjournment.
The motion was agreed to, and

A sketch of the i emai k<¡ ojTMr Carr, upon
ojfei ing an amendment to the Hat ben and
liivet Bill.
May 17, 1834
Mi CARR pioposed an amendment to the bill
foi an appiopi latum of the sum of §25,000 to mi-
piove the navigUion m the lndun Chute thiough
the Palls of tht Ohio nvei.
Mr C in a vei y buef and explicit manner ear-
nestly urged the proparty and utility of impiovmg
the navigation in the falls liestated that a survey
had been made, that the Committee on Roads and
Canals had called on tht depaitment foi a copy of
the sui vev, and also foi an estimate of tne amount
necessaiy *o make the improvement asked foi
Mi C said he had been itiiormed that the depart-
ment had req íested Captain ¡shieve to make an
estimate of ihe probable amount which it would
cost to impiovt the navigation thiough the falls to
an advantage, but that he hud not been informed
whether this estimate had been made and foiward-
ed to the Comm ttee on Roads and Canals or not
Ml C said he had deemed it his bounden duty
to offer at this time the amendment which he had
pioposed if the estimate had not yet been made,
he piesumed that it would be done immediately
If so, it would be presented to the House for its
action previous to the engiossment of the bill
Mi C said, that, in fiequent conversations which
he had had with Captain S on this subject, (in
whosejudgmeiit he confided much,) he had given
it as his opinion, that with the sum of twenty-
five thousand dolíais, the obstiuction which now
impeded safe and easy navigation through the
falls could be, m a great degiee, removed It was
also the opinion of other gentlemen of expenence
in matteis of this sou, that with th  sum asked
for, the navigation might be so impioved as to
jvnder the pas age of fiat bottomed boats, and
other vesbels, of oidinaiy tonnage, safe thiough
the fills throughout the greater poition of the
yeai
Mr C adverted to the vast commerce which
was oairied on upon the Ohio river, and of the
deep inteiest which was felt by the agricultural
community and otneis, in relation to the contem-
plated impiovement—he spoke ofthelarge number
of flat-bottomed boats which annually descended
the Ohio, laden with the productions of the culf-
vatois of the soil, and of the enormous tax which
the owners of them were liable to pay foi a pas-
sage through the canal Mi C was of opinion,
that onehalfthe amount which the owners of boats
which descended the Ohio nver are liable to pay,
within the term of one year, in the way of toll0,
if they all passed thiough the canal, would so far
remove the obstruction, which now impedes the
navigation, as to make the navigation both safe
and easy through the falls, at least so far as the
flat-bottom-boat navigation, and boats of ordinary
tonnage ofother descuptions, are concerned Mr
C said, it was the opinion of many persons with
whom hehad conversed ,someof whom were gentle-
men of much experience, to improve the navigation
of the fal'3 in the mannei in which he undeistood
it was contemplated to be done, and depositing
the rock which would have necessarily to be
removed from the channel,so to be impioved in a
proper mannei, that so fai from injuring the canal
in the slightest degiee, it would have the contraiy
effect, that the condition of the canal would be
impioved by it
Mr C said, that as this was a matter of so
much irteiest, to so large a portion of the coun-
try, he hoped the small sum asked foi would be
granted                                    _______
HOUSE Or REPRESENTATIVES
April 26, 1834
Mi. Edward D White, fiom the select
committee   to which wan refened the
memorial of Benjamin Phillips, of Phil-
adelphia, made the following report
The object of the memorialist is to invite
the attention of Congiess, and of the pub-
lic  geneially,   to  certain   improvements
devised by him in the use and slruetuie
of the steam engine.    The model of his
apparatus, accompanied by drawings and
didgiam , illustiative of its punciples, have
been submitted and examined.    Whatever
othei advantages may be supposed to be
combined in the scheme, the committee
j have  considered   it chiefly, if not exclu-
sively,   in   refeience   to  its  comparative
safety,  or exemption from the danger of
explosion,
• It seems to be a point conceded by
scientific observers, tint among the pri-
mary causes of explosion in steam boileis,
one of the most piominent may be traced
to the want of a constant and íegular sup-
ply of water, while the engine is in action,
fhe usual means employed, as the com-
mittee are advised, both for supplying the
consumption of the boiler, and for ascei-
taining the quantum of water in that
receptacle, aie inadequate and uncertain.
The forcing pump is liable to derange-
ment, and when the vvatei has fallen so
low asto stipennduce the circumstances of
(danger, neither the common gauge cock,
noi the common safety valve, can be
relied on for an accurate indication of the
sttte of things so essential to be known.
By the pi in submitted, these defects
appear to be remedied. A constant and
uniform supply of water, and a test water
gauge, indicating to the eye, at any
moment, the precise level of the fluid in
the boiler, form a part of the melioration
suggested.
But what appeals to the committee to
be the distinguishing feature of the plan,
is, that it contemplates the employment of
the steam at any given piessuie, without
a corresponding stress on the boiler. This
result is obtained by generating the steam
at a veiy moderate pressuie on the boilei,
from whence it is conveyed for use, to one
or moie receivers, in which, before it is
applied as the momentum to the engine,
it may be raised, by flues heated from a
separate furnace, to any requned degree
of elasticity.
The committee aie of opinion, that if
the scheme be feasible, oí which they do
not doubt, it must, of itself, be an impor-
tant step towards the grand desideratum.
Confined in a separate reservoir, not in
immediate connexion with the boiler, the
steam, however ranfied, would not be
liable to be suddenly injected with water,
a process which all concuinng experience
proclaims to be the proximate cause of
many of the most dieadful accidents that
have occurred.
The foim and position of the contem-
plated receiver is believed to present an-
othei condition of security. Placed verti-
cally on the deck, with different chambers
or compartments, connected by valves, the
steim at its greatest tension, naturally
rushing through the valves into the upper
chambeis of the recipient, if ever explosion
should take place, it would be a mere
effusion of steam, and not of heated water ,
and the discharge would be upward, into
the open air, leaving untouched the pas-
sengeis and the property embarked in the
vessel.
There are other particulars in the mech-
anism, of the usefulness of which piactical
engineers alone aie competent to form an
accuiate estimate. It will suffice to say,
that, as a whole, the committee consider
the contrivance as reflecting credit on the
science and ingenuity of the propnetoi,
and that his plan is worthy of a full and
fair experiment.
On the question as to the power and
the expediency of aid and cooperation on
the pait of the Government in experiments
of the kind, the committee have come to
an «ffirmative conclusion. When it is
considered how intimately the subject-
matter connects itself wilh the general
welfare, looking to the piotection of the
lives and property of the whole people,
that it involves considerations of naval and
nalional defence, as well as the general
interests of commeice, it is not thought
that any valid opposing argument can be
drawn fiom the want of power, much less
< an objection be raised on the score of
policy.
The committee have thought pioper to
lecomtnend a small sum to be placed at
the disposal of the Secretary of the Navy,
to test the improvements in this branch.
It is believed that a reasonable expendi-
ture of the public mone) foi this subject
would coincide with the universal sense,
and meet the applause of the nation. The
knowledge of the mode of controlling and
dnecting with safety this powerful, but
hitherto dangerous agent in the affaiib of
men, would be cheaply purchased at the
cost of millions.
