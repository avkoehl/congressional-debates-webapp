FORT LEAVENWORTH, July 12, 1864.

Colonel JAMES H. FORD,

Kansas City:

COLONEL: I have not-supposed I was to campaign in Platte County, and am therefore not acquainted with the roads. To move from opposite points to the enemy's rear, as General Fisk's adjutant has proposed, would render your junction a little difficult and doubtful, as you might be attacked in detail. I think it safer to attempt the junction at Platte City, where as you near the objective point, I can also join you or help either detachment. I wish you had two boats so you could move quick and quiet. But take your own way, and let me know your plans and I will help you. My troops are impatient, but take your time for starting right. I do not believe they have any large force together, and they have no artillery.

S. R. CURTIS,

Major-General.

KANSAS CITY, July 12, 1864.

Major General S. R. CURTIS,

Commanding Department of Kansas:

I will be ready to move with 380 well mounted men by 1 p.m. I will be re-enforced from Warrensburg this evening by 130 mounted men and one section of artillery. Had I better move at once or await my re-enforcements? Advise me as to the movements of your troops; also as to the direction I had better move with my command. Do you know anything about General Fisk's command?

J. H. FORD,

Colonel, Commanding Fourth Sub-District.

FORT LEAVENWORTH, July 12, 1864.

Colonel JAMES H. FORD,

Kansas City:

I can move about 300 and strike Platte City in one hour. If you march all the way how long will it take you? Keep me informed by sending dispatches as long as you can. You can dispatch by sending express riders back; also from Wayndotte if you choose.

S. R. CURTIS.

Major-General.

FORT LEAVENWORTH, July 12, 1864.

Colonel J. H. FORD,

Kansas City:

You should have cooked rations in haversacks and all ready. How do you propose to move? Can you get all your force on a boat and move up to a near point, land and move out quickly to Platte City? Forces should unite at or near Platte City in daylight to prevent mistakes. I could move quickly from Weston and rout the rascals from Platte City, but they would run away, and any damage done would only be called Kansas jayhawking, whereas they deserve severe measures from you hands.

S. R. CURTIS.

Major-General.
