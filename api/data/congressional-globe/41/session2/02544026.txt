THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
June 2,
gethor, paid three quarters of one per cent, of the
income tax, while Rhode Island has paid nearly two
per cent. Theeastern States have been compared with
the. western States for the reason that the growth of
the latter in wealth oanpot bo questioned; but the
same groat differences will be found between the agri-
cultural anil manufacturing or commercial States of
the Bast, and as well between the agricultural and
manufacturing or commcreial distriot of the same
State East or West. Hence the Question is by no
means a sectional one. Ten districts, (including one
111 California, one in Illinois, one in Massachusetts,
one in Now Jersey, two in Pennsylvania, and four in
Now York,) out of about two hundred and forty, paid
more than one third of all the income tax collected
in I8GS, and twenty-four districts paid more than tho
remaining two hundred and sixteen districts.
" No one would suppose that one third of tho wealth
accumulated in 1807, or for tho preceding four years,
was amassed in ton collection districts, or the half
in twenty-four districts; yet, if tho incomo tax is an
equitable one, and it is enforced alike in all sections
of the country, we must believe such exhibit to be
correct. That the law has been evaded (here is no
question, but it will scarcely do to charge these great
discrepancies, these glaring inequalities in thoassess-
ment of tho tax upon the accumulated wealth, to
evasion and fraud on tho part of the people, ainco all
tho virtue is not confined to ten or twenty districts,
nor all the dishonesty to the districts paying little
tax. The great injustice is to bo found in the law
itself, though it be ever so strictly enforced, which
taxes as accumulated wealth tho wages, tho salary,
tho profits of the mechanic, the clerk, tho merchant,
or the>'manufacturer of tho cities, largely exhausted
in actual substance before tho tax is assessed, while
it utterly fails to reach the substantial millions which
are being annually added to the vast wealth of the
agricultural districts of the Union."
It is argued by some that the income tax is
paid by only 272,848 individuals, and therefore
ft is the most lair, just, and popular tax of all
levied. Most absurd reasoning. To my mind
it is one of the strongest arguments proving its
inequality, that it is Tjorne by the few; there-
fore a direct tax, and consequently is uncon-
stitutional. The following table will show by
whom the income tax is paid, and in what pro-
portion the tax is contributed per capita by the
people of the different States:

Mr. Speaker, it is unnecessary to argue this
question any further. Every candid mind can-
not but be convinced of the inequality of this
tax, and that it bears very unjustly on those
who have to pay it.
The citizens of New Jersey appreciate the
honor of having their little State standing among
the foremost in the proud position among the
States of sustaining the Government and help-
ing so largely to liquidate the public debt; but
tlicy do not wish to be selfish in this matter, and
would much prefer some of her sister States
to share in equal proportion the honor of pay-
ing off Ihe debt. It may not be so much her
wealth and riches, as the honest return of in-
comes rendered by her citizens, that has so
much increased her revenue to the United
States Treasury.
It is conteuded that the tax is a popular one
because the revenue it produces eomes from
the rich and wealthy. The gentlemen who use
such arguments forget that most of the. rich
and wealthy men who have incomes to return
receive them from the profits of their business ;
and in the end a greater portion of it comes
directly and indirectly from the workingmen,
mechanics, clerks, and others in their employ,
who in many instances are paid less wagesin
order that these taxes can be met and paid.
Therefore I hold that the income tax bears un-
justly and hard on this most worthy and indus-
trious class of citizens. I represent a large-
class of these people, and I am here to look
after and protect their interests; and I enter
ray protest against any effort on the part of this
House that -will tend directly or indirectly to
their injury. And I am here to look after the
interest of all my constituents, and also to plead
for the great body of the people of New Jefsey
who are interested in this matter, who during
the imposition of the internal revenue laws
have paid into the Federal Treasury over forty
million dollars; from ten to twelve million dol-
lars of which has been paid under this income
tax law. Let the tax law be so framed as not
to be a direct.tax on any one class of citizens,
and not so unequally levied as it is at present
and will be under the provisions of this bill now
before the House, if passed and carried out.
Mr. Speaker, I hope the voice of a large
body of the tax-paying citizens will be heard.
I have presented several petitions now on file
signed by a large number of people in the State
of New Jersey, one of which was fifty feet
long, with some thirteen hundred names, ask-
ing for the entire abrogation of the income
tax. I trust their wishes, with others through-
out the country,may be regarded and complied
with, and this tax be no longer continued after
it shall have expired by its own limitation at
the end of the present year.
I ask the gentlemen of this House to take a
broad view of this matter, looking over the
whole country, and the general bearing of the
income tax on all the people, and impose no
tax law the tendency of which would be to
create bad feeling against the Government be-
cause of its unequal and unjust provisions.
Mr. KELLOGG. I renew the motion to
exempt $2,000 from the income of each per-
son, instead of $1,500. 1 have not time in the
few minutes allowed me to say all I desire upon
this subject. Gentlemen upon the other side
cannot by any argument or sophistry, here or
before the people, make of this anything but
an odious and unpopular tax. As the gentle-
man from New York so ably argued yesterday,
the plighted faith of Congress demands this
tax should expire now ; and I thought it at
least questionable taste for the distinguished
chairman of the Ways and Means Committee
to speak so lightly of the pledges of his prede-
cessor at the head of the committee, ratified,
as it had been, by the action of both branches
of Congress, and approved as a law.
This tax was first imposed in a time of ex-
treme necessity, when the Government with
its hundred eyes was searching and with its
hundred hands was reaching in every direction
for the means to preserve its existence. And
nearly two years after the war was ended, when
the full measure of our debt was known and
understood, Congress, by the act of March 2,
1807, reduced this tax from a higher rate at
the close of the war and increased the exemp-
tion from $000 to $1,000; and by as solemn a
pledge as can be given by a law of Congress
it assured the people that this tax should ex-
pire in 1870, and the people have since paid
the tax upon the faith of that pledge without
a murmur. They will murmur, however, and
you will hear their murmurs when too late, if
you refuse to stand by tho pledge of your pre-
decessors.
I trust the House will strike out all these
provisions for the continuance of the income
tax, and end the obnoxious thing forever. The
people demand at our hands a reduction of
taxation, and they demand it now. They ask
that its burdens be lightened, and they ask that
it be done now. It is of vastly more import-
ance to the business of the country that taxa-
tion should be moderately reduced, than it is
to pay off large amounts of the public debt
speedily. Enough of taxation should be re-
tained for the expenses of the Government, the
payment of bounties and pensions, the interest
of the public debt, and enough of the prin-
cipal to strengthen the public credit, and give
assurance of the constant reduction and final
payment of the debt. But when the statement
of the public debt for June 1, as sent to us
yesterday by the Secretary of the Treasury,
shows that the reduction of the debt during the
month of May has been the enormous sum of
$14,301,962 57, or nearly half a million a day
drained from the channels of the business
of the country, and that the whole reduction
of the debt since March 1, 1870, has been
$31,766,105 39, I ask the distinguished chair-
man of the Ways and Means if he does not
think the business of the country deserves a
little more relief, than his proposed reduction
of taxation of only about thirty-three million
dollars annually?
The history of this tax in Great Britain was
given yesterday by my honorable friend from
New York. The statesmen of that country
had exhausted every other source of taxation
before Mr. Pitt ventured upon this measure, in
the struggle that was then going on for the
supremacy, if not for the existence of her
power. Every other species of taxation had
long before been exercised, and this was the
last devilish invention. She had had taxes
upon marriages, taxes upon births, and taxes
upon burials. A duke had formerly paid fifty
pounds tax on his marriage and thirty pounds
tax oil the birth of his eldest son. There had
been special taxes on bachelors over twenty-
five ; and I know my friend from Maine [Mr.
Hale] and others here would object to that
provision in our law. There had also been
special taxes on widowers who had no children.
They were taxed for having children and taxed
for not having children. The old story of her
all-pervading system of taxation is familiar;
it was like the plague of Egypt, that entered
even their dwellings, their bed-chambers, and
tbeir kneading-troughs. They taxed every-
thing but God's own sunshine, and they even
taxed that, for they had their "window tax
and according to the number of panes of gjass
was the light taxed that entered cottage or
palace. But yet this income tax of Mr. Pitt
was so unpopular that when it expired, in six
months after the close of the war, there was a
general cry of joy and relief all over the realm.
For more than twenty-five years after the
close of that war there was no income tax in
Great Britain. Why was it reenacted in 1842,
under the lead of Sir Bobert Peel? Simply
because the debt of Great Britain was increas-
ing instead of diminishing, and because it was
necessary to save the credit and the finances
of the country from utter and irretrievable
ruin. Senator Sherman-, in his speech at the
other end of the Capitol a few days since, in
which he seeks to justify the continuance of
the income tax at tho reduced rate of three per
cent., fully admits this as the reason why the
tax was restored in 1842. He says:
"I stated that after the close of tho war with
J!ranee the English income tax was repealed; and
it was not until 1842, when England had been drift-
in? always to leeward, with her debt always increas-
ing, when there was ail actual deficiency of some
£-,000,000, and it became ncce^sary to revise tho
whole system of taxation, that Sir Robert Peel haU
the courage, in two houses of Parliament winch
represented nothing but property, tor property i.s
enthroned in Parliament, to come forward and pro-
pose an income tax and stake hi3 political life 011 it."
Sir, we are paying off the principal of the
public debt at the rate of $125,000,000 a year,
in addition to all our other burdens, and it is
