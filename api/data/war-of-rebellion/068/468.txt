ordered Colonel Devin, with Heaton's battery, to report to General Custer, and then General Custer will attack General Longstreet, who is reported on the Brock road on Hancock's left and rear. Open communication with General Custer and tell him you will support him, and in that case you will take command of the whole. Please keep me advised constantly of your movements and what is going on. Captain Dana will make further explanations.

GENERAL: The general commanding directs me to say that he has just ordered Devin's brigade to join General Custer and to connect himself with General Hancock's left by a strong system of patrols. As soon as General Wilson gets his ammunition, forage, and provisions, he will relieve General Merritt's brigade, now at Alrich's, and Merritt's brigade will cover the road to the Furnaces and will be ready to be used wherever it may be wanted. I have not heard from Old Wilderness yet, but the fighting this morning has been very heavy. Your trains are not far from here. You can be supplied at any time you may think best.
