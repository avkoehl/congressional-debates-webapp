HDQRS. DEPARTMENT AND ARMY OF THE TENNESSEE, Orangeburg, S. C., February 12, 1865.

Major General JOHN A. LOGAN,

Commanding Fifteenth Army Corps:

GENERAL: I wish to move you corps to the point marked Sandy Run Post-Office (on some maps, Sandy Run Meeting House) by a two day's march. The direct road on the eastern bank of Caw Caw Swamp from Orangeburg is open to you, and I think you can find another road between Caw Caw Swamp and Ligingstone Creek, running into the other. You can use both roads if you wish. General Blair will break the railroad as far as the State road, and turning to the left will proceeded to Sandy Run Post-Office. Send one division at least by the most direct route you can find to the road above mentioned on the east side of Caw Caw Swamp. I wish to follow that division with my headquarters. I will send an officer to you to consult with you in order that my headquarters may start at the right time. I will issue a field order this evening, but do not wait for it. Base your order of march on this letter.

Very respectfully,

O. O. HOWARD,

Major-General.
