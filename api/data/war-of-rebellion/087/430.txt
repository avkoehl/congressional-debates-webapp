division, was captured. General Crawford was at one time quite surrounded by the enemy. General Willcox's division, of the Ninth Corps, about 1,200 strong, was immediately ordered up to attack the enemy, and the lines of Generals Ayres and Crawford, being reformed, moved forward at the same time, driving back the enemy, regaining the ground lost, and capturing prisoners. General Crawford's division captured a battle-flag, taken by G. W. Reed.* Eleventh Pennsylvania Volunteers, and in Colonel Hofmann's brigade J. T. Jennings,* Fifty sixth Pennsylvania Volunteers, also took one. About the same time the troops under General White, of the Ninth Corps, about 1,000 strong, on our right, were formed facing to the right to oppose any further flaking, and engaged Colquitt's brigade of the enemy, and drove it back, capturing about 40 prisoners. The enemy in great confusion rapidly fell back to his intrenchments, carrying with them the disorganized parts of the command, which had become so by the attack from the rear in the woods, and also a large portion of those on picket. An instance of brutality occurred on the part of a rebel officer which deserves execration. Finding he was took closely pressed to carry off Captain Newbury, Twelfth U. S. infantry, a prisoner, he deliberately put a pistol to his breast and shot him. This is the testimony of the dying man himself. Before this flank attack began, signal officers reported troops moving against my front on the railroad, and General Ayres reported their arrival in his front, These made repeated attempts to force him back after he regained his line but failed.

The enemy's loss must have been heavy in killed and wounded. Colonel Hofmann, commanding brigade in Fourth Division, and Colonel Wheelock, commanding brigade in Third Division, are particularly deserving for their conduct this day. The troops of the Ninth Corps fought excellently and the enemy made no stand against them. August 20, having become satisfied that our position here was one the enemy was determined to force us from, I posted my lines in position favorable for artillery defense, which gave me a considerable infantry reserve, and then awaited an attack. The day passed off without any. August 21, the enemy at 9 a. m. drove in my pickets on the north and west and opened with about thirty pieces of artillery, crossing his fire at right angels over my position. The timber, however, prevented his artillerymen from having any good view of our lines. At 10 a. m. he made position an assault all along the north and west of my position, but was everywhere repulsed. His intention to outflank us on the left was completely frustrated. Our artillery did excellent execution and broke the
