Major-General.

Major-General HOWARD,

Commanding Eleventh Corps:

GENERAL: The major-general commanding directs me to say that his orders do no to permit any interference with the crossing of General Sherman's column. You will give it the right of way and not interfere with it.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Major-General, Chief of Staff.
HDQRS. 2nd AND 3rd BRIGS., 1ST DIV., 4TH ARMY CORPS,Whiteside's, November 22, 1863-8.30 p.m.

Major J. S. FULLERTON,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

MAJOR:The rear of General Sherman's last division (General Osterhaus commanding) is now arriving here and going into bivouac until 12 o'clock midnight. The general informs me he will certainly move at that hour and promises to have the road clear shortly after daylight to the rear of this place. He proposes to accomplish this by parking the largest portion of his wagons at this point. General Whitaker has orders to move at daylight, and both brigades will follow closely after General Osterhaus. I telegraphed you from this point at 3.30 this afternoon, expressing a doubt of my ability to move before midday to-morrow from Shellmound, but am now inclined to believe that it may be accomplished at daylight. You may assure the general commanding that no time will be lost.

I am, major, most respectfully, your obedient servant,

CHARLES CRUFT,

Brigadier-General, Commanding Expedition.
