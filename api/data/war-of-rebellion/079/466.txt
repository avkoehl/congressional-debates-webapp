Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Chief of Staff:

If General Rosecrans can send me troops from his command, I would like to have them sent as soon as possible up the Tennessee to Eastport, or as near that point as can be. The indications to-day are that the enemy is moving in that direction from the vicinity of Decatur, where they appeared yesterday afternoon and drove in General Granger's pickets.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Chief of Staff:

Have not heard from General Hatch, at Clifton, to-day. General Croxton reports from Florence no unusual movement of the enemy, a dn that is scouts report that there are no troops at Eastport, and that the enemy is not operating the Memphis and Charleston Railroad from Corinth to Chickasaw. General Granger reports the enemy still in his front in force, but, as yet, no attack has been made. Five additional regiments should reach Decatur to-night, and Granger feels confident he can make a successful defense of that post. The Fourth Corps has started from General Sherman's army. I expect it to reach Bridgeport by Monday night, and will move it by railroad to Athens on its arrival. If General Rosecrans troops can reach Eastport early next week I shall have no further fears, and will set to work immediately to prepare for an advance, as General Sherman telegraphed me yesterday that Beauregard assumed command on the 17th, and promised his men to enter Tennessee, by the way of Guntersville. As yet he has made no show anywhere, except at Decatur. Gun-boats and strong pickets are watching all the fords.
