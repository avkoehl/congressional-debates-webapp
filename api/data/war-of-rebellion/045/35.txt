Station, and not to proceed to the places mentioned in your order of yesterday, as he expresses himself that I am of more service to him here than there. Major [Harvey] Baldwin, of my staff, has gone by train in to see you, and report to you personally. Besides the protection of the road, he requested me to send over scouting parties, and to send troops to the places from where he is removing his troops; sent all.

Awaiting your orders, I am, respectfully.

Captain MCENTEE,

Provost-Marshal, Catlett's Station:

Your information is very important, and agrees with ours. It is very evident that the enemy are about sending out a very heavy cavalry expedition. We do not expect too much of you, but try and give us notice of its movements. Can you get anything more of the two brigades spoken of as having come from North Carolina? I shall soon send you more men.

SHARPE,

Colonel.

BALTIMORE June 8, 1863.

Major-General MILROY,

Winchester, Va.:

A dispatch just received from General Halleck states- That the enemy is massing 12, 000 cavalry and artillery in Culpeper County for a raid. Deserters say that the men have been given to understand that it is to be a long and desperate one. We shall not probably know the direction or intention of this raid until it is actually in motion. Have a sharp lookout, and keep these headquarters well informed of any movements.

By order:

WM. H. CHESEBROUGH,

Lieutenant-Colonel, and Assistant Adjutant-General.

(Same to General Kelley, at Harper's Ferry, and general Averell, at Weston.)
