NASHVILLE, December 26, 1862-1.40 a.m.

Brigadier-General STANLEY,

Chief of Cavalry:

GENERAL: Your dispatch is just received. The general's directions are that your right wing shall move along the Franklin pike, your left along the Murfreesborough, the reserve along the Nolensville, with the exception of the Fourth [U. S.] Cavalry, which will accompany the general on the Murfreesborough pike. There are some 700 of the enemy in Franklin. The general wishes a dash made at them, and, when driven out, he wants the cavalry to sweep over in the direction of Nolensville, picketing the Wilson pike leading toward Petersburg with one two regiments, according as the enemy shall prove to be in greater or less force along our front.

From the reserve you will furnish General McCook with the means of keeping up communication with you and these headquarters, which, moving along the Murfreesborough road, will be established near La Vergne, on the railroad, near Concord church. Direct the commander of each of your cavalry detachments to keep up a regular communication with each other and with the leading divisions in their rear. Make arrangement also for courier line, through Captain Otis, across the country from one corps headquarters to another, the posts to be then near, each half a mile apart, patrolling the roads between their posts. Captain Otis can be directed to relieve their posts. Direct the commander of your right wing, if you please, to report to Major-General Thomas as he goes out; the commanders of the left wing to Major-General Crittenden; and the general desires you to see and arrange with General McCook the communication of intelligence between you. You will, of course, give orders to them to report frequently to you.

I have the honor to be, general,

J. P. GARESCHE,

It is 6 miles from Wilson pike to Nolensville; country open, rolling; road fair; 6 miles from Nolensville to La Vergne; 7 miles to Stewartsborough. Cavalry has been ordered to move on your right, and clear out Franklin; thence toward Nolensville, picketing Wilson pike. Walker's brigade had better be posted on Wilson pike in advance of Brentwood, near Franklin road. Negley and Rousseau well closed in.
