On motion of Mr. BENTON, the letter of the
Secretarv, and the table*, were ordered to be printed.
Mr. B then ro^e to make another mi tit n, and
that was, to print an extra number of these papers.
He proposed to give his reasons for  the  mo ion,
and for that purpose, v-ked that the paper-, should
be sent to him, (whuh was done,) and  Mr.  B.
went on to say  that his object  was to spread be-
fore the country, in  an   authentic form, the full
view of all the Government expenses for a «eries
of yeais past, gome back as far as Mr. Monroe's
administration, and  thereby enabling every  citi-
zen, in every part cf the country, to ste the actual,
the comparative, and ihe rlassihrd  expenditures of
the Government   for the whole period.   This pro-
ceeding had become necessary, Mr. B «aid, from
the systematic efforts made for some years paM, to
tmpre«s the country with the belief that the expen-
ditures bad increased threefold in the last twelve
years—that thev had risen from THIRTEEN to
THIRTY-NINE millions of dollars; and that this
enormcus increase was the effect of the extrava-
gance, of the corruption, and of ihe incompetency
of the Administrations which had succeeded that of
Mr. Adams and Mr. Monroe.   These two  latter
Administrations were held up as the models of eco-
nomy;   those of Mr. Van  Buren   and   General
Jackson   were   stigmatized as monsters   of  ex-
travaeance;   and   tablrs    of   figures    were   so
arrranged    as    to    give    color   to    ihe   cha-
racters   attributed   to   each.     These   systematic
efforts—this reiterated   assertion,  made   on   this
floor, of thirteen millions increased to thtriy-nine—
and the effect which such statements mu>t have
upon the minds ot those who cannot see the pur-
poses for which the money was expended, ap-
peared to him (Mr. B ) to rrqmre some more for-
mal and authentic refutation than any  one  indi-
vidual could give—something more imposing than
the   speech of a solitary member could afford.
Familiar with the action of the  Government for
twenty years past—coming into ihe Senate in the
time of Mr. Monro —remaining in it ever since—
a friend to economy in public a,'d in private life—
and closely scrutinizing the  expenditures  of the
Government during the whole lime—he (Mr. B )
felt himself to be very able at any  time to have
risen in   his   place,   and   to   have   exposed   the
delusion   of   thn   thirteen   and   thirty nine   mil-
lion   bugbear;   and,   if   he   did   not   do  so,   it
was   because,   in   the   first    place,    he    was
disinclined   to   bandy   contradictioas    on     the
floor of  the Senate;  and, in the second place,
because he relied upon the  intelligence rf  the
country to set a'l right whenever they obtain d
a view of the farts.   This  view he had made
himself the instrument of procuring, and the Se-
cretary of the Treasury  had now presented it.
It  was ready for ihe contemplation of the Ame-
rican  people; and he could wi^h every citizen to
have the picture in his own hands, that h  might
contemplate it at his own fireside, and at his full
leisure    He could wish every citizen to possess
'  a copy of ibis report, now received from the Se-
cretary of the Treasury, under the call of the Se-
nate, and printed   by its order;   he could wish
every citizen to possess one of these authentic co-
pies, tearing the imprimatur of the Amer can Se-
nate; but that was impossible; and, limiting his
action to what was possible, he would propose to
print such   number  of  exira copies   as  would
enable   some   to   reach   every   quarter   of   the
Union.   He knew that the report could easily go
through the newspapers, (for it wis very shoit,)
and he hoped that it would appear in every paper
that was a friend to truth and to fair dea'ing—lhat
wished to give correct information to it> readers.
He hoped it would appear in all such paper-; but
that was not sufficieni.   The newspaper publica-
tions were not  sufficiently   free   from   cavil to
answer his purpose; no publication could be suffi-
cient but the one made by the order of the Senate,
and, therefore, he wished the document itself to go
forth, with  the Sena'onal imprimatur upon it, in
sufficient numbers to reach  every quarter  of the
Union.    He wished a large number to be printed;
but would not   suggest  any particular   number
until he had first given to the Senate .some view of
the papers themselves, and thus febown tbem to be
worthy of the most ample multiplicwion, and of
lb.* most exiersive d rTusion.
Mi. B. then opened the tables, and explained
their character ami conunts. The first one
(marked A) consisted of three columns, and ex-
hibited the Bsgrcgnte, and the classified expendi-
tures of the Government from the year 1824 to
1839, inclusive; the second one (marked B) con-
tamed the detailed statement of the payments an-
nually made on accouni of all temporary or extra-
ordinary object*., including the public debt, for the
same period. The second table was explanatory
of the third column of the first one, and the two,
taken together, would enable every citizen to see
ihe actual expenditures, and the comparative ex-
penditures, of ihe Government for the whole pe-
riod which he had mentionid.
Mr B. then examined the actual and the com-
parative expenses of two of the years, taken from
the two contracted peruds referred to, and invoked
tne attention of the Senate to the results which the
comparison would exhibit He took the first and
the la^t of ihe years men íoned in the tables—the
years 1824 and 1839—and b gan with the first
item in the first column. This, showed the aggre-
gate expenditures for every object for the year
1824, lo have been J31,898,538 47—very near
thiriy-two millions of dollars, said Mr. B. and if
stated alone, and without explanation, very capab e
of astonishing the public, of imposing upon the ig-
norant, and of raumg a cry against the dreadful ex-
travagance, the corruption, and the wickedness ot
Mr. Monroe's administration. Taken by itself,
(and indisputab'y true it is in itself,) and this ag-
gregate of near thirty-lwo millions is very sufficient
to effect all this surprise and indignation in the
public mind; but, passing on to the second column
to see what were the expenditures, independent of
ihe public debt, and this lerge aggregate will be
found to be reduced more than one half; it sinks
t) $15,330,144 71. This is a heavy deduction, but
it is not all. Passing on to the third column, and
it is seen lhat the actual expenses of the Go-
vernment for permanent and ordinary objects, in-
dependent of the temporary and extraordinary
ones, for this seme yfar, were only $7,107,892 05;
being less than the one fourth part ot the aggregate
of nea' thirty-two millions. This looks quite rea-
sonable, and goes far towards relieving Mr. Mon-
roe's administration from the imputation to which
a view of the aggregate expenditure for the year
would have subjected it Bui, to mike u enti ely
satisfactory, and to enable evpry cit zen to under-
stand the important point of the Government ex-
penditures—a point on which the cit zens of a fiee
and repreientative Government should be alwav/i
well informed—to attain this full salisfact.on, let us
pas? on to the second labl (marked B) and fix our
eyes oa us first column, uncl«r the year 1824 We
shall there find every temporary and extraordinary
object, and the amount paid on account of it, the
deduciirn of which reduced an aggregate of near
thirty-two millions to a fraction over seven
millions. We shall there find the explana-
iton of the difference between the first and
third columns. The first item is ihe sum of
#16 5GS,393 76, paid on account of the piin-
cipal and interest of the public debt. The
second is the sum of $4,891,386 56, pad to mer-
chants lor indemnities under the treaty with Spain
of 1819, by which we acquired Florida. The third
is $5,510 27 paid to Stales for claims on account
of war dib's. The fourth is $47,714 53 for the
three per centum to the new States on the lands
^o'd within their limns. The fifth is $17,000 on
account of the two per centum to the Cumberland
road. The fifth is $4,373 19 for the survey of
the coast. The sixih is $423,342 46 for collecting
materials for the gradual increase of the nivy, and
the improvement of the navy yards. Thesev«nth
is $180,309 67 for durable public buildings. The
eighth is $429,972 04 for bnrlges and fortifica-
tions. The ninth is $56,955 99 for rosds, ca-
na's, and breakwaters, and improvements in
rivers and harbors, except the Cumberland
road, wh'ch was stated by itself. The tenth
is $171,155 43 for providing arras for themilitia of
the United States, and for aiming the fortifications.
The eleventh w $1,267,600 41, for all pensions,
