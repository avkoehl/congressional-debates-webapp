Mi JOlN'ES,of Geoigia, aiose and stated, that
having hid a conveis uion with the gintltuidn
fiom Kentucl y, [Mr Popf,] he did not feel dis
posed to piess the consideiation of his motion
until that gentleman should h ue an oppoitumty
to piesent his amendment Hi, howevei, must
be undci„tood to letain the opinion, that the well
being of the naval scitnc lequued the establish
ment of the highei lanks indicated in his own
pioposition lie was well awaie that this was
unpopulir in the Hous , but when he connected
with his own impu ssions tin lcmaiksand ar-
guments of gt nth men on that flooi in n laiion to
the suppoit of the dignity of the officii and of
the country abtoaj, he w is still mon convinced
of the pioprn ty of adding th schighii lanks to
those «Ik idy xistmg in the N ivy 1 hey won

liuction of tin motion of the gcutl mm from Ken
tucky,] Mr Puie,] whose amindmint wis then
read and ndopti d by Mi J as a modification of
lus motion
Mr WISE said he -was not disposed to offer
any peoul objections to this eouise, but h<
ft an d, th xigh he did no' entertain that belief
himself, that it would be eonsliued by many into
an act of hostility to (he bill
Mi   POPE disclairm d ill such hostility
Mi GÍELCI said he had undeistood the
tiue question bifoictht House, on the adjouin
mint last tv mug, to be on the punting of the
bill and um nilmi nt
Hit ( HAIR explained That motion had
leen withdiawn
Mi GILLLT then moved the postponement
of the consultation of the bill till to monow,
with the view to h ue it printed, loi hepiotcsted,
he could not himself undcistand the situation m
which it stood, and he believed i gie it uuinbei of
mi mbi rs were m the same condition
Mi W VI MOL Gil sud the bill was essen
tiallv the same with the amendments, as that
aheady punted fie d piecatcd delay The
friends of the bill liad shown a disposition to
make eveiy possibles icufice consistent with then
deep sense of light foi the puipose of facilitating
its passage
Mr JONES, of Georgia, expressed a hope
that the gentleman from New York [Mr Gil-
lei1 would waive his motion to print, in ordei
to go into the Committee of the Whole, and get
the bill in a condition to be engiossed it would
then be time enough to have it printed forfuithei
examination and amendment
Mi GILLET said the difficulty could not thus
be avoided A disagreement existed between
the chairmen of the s leet committee, [Mi W vt
mouch] and himself as to the constiuction of
some of the provisions alri ady passed upon —
paiticulaily m leiation to allowances to com-
manding officers at sea and on shoie He sud
lie also had amendments to prop >si as will is
the gentleman fiom Kentucky, [Mi Popr ] and
in the pu sent confused stttt of the bill hi was
not sure tint he cou'd piopeuy designate uhi re
they should come in, oi wl it should be then
exect puipoit
Mr   WATMOUGH  said the   amendment of
the amendment of the gentleman   who last ad
diessed  the Chair went to stuke out all allow
anees, so hi could see no difficulty in the way of
the gentleman which could icquiie the dehy in

The question was then taken on the motion of
Mi   Gil 11 t, and rejected
Mi   RECD next addressed the House in oppo
sition to the motion to íecomu it the bill   He s iw
no necessity for it     Tt wis aheady sufficiently
understood foi the action of the House, and foi
all putposes of amendment     The nipoi an e of,

After some tmthei re maiks, Mi R contendí d
