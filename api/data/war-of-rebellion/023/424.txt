[CHAP. XXVIII.

My troops are in high spirits and feel confident of their ability to whip any force which may be brought against them.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEORGE W. MORGAN,

Brigadier-General Vols., Commanding Seventh Division.
HEADQUARTERS,Decherd, August 26, 1862.

Colonel CHAPIN, Tenth Wisconsin, Huntsville:

The general is glad to hear of your success in taking your posts. He expects you will meet with constant difficulty in holding the line, but the vigilance and bravery of your regiment are relied upon for success. Rebuild the stockade at once. Huntsville is ordered to keep an engine and party ready to repair railroad and telegraph.

There is no danger to your small parties as long as they are vigilant and defend the stockades. The enemy is confessedly unwilling to make the sacrifice of men necessary to take one of them if properly defended.

JAMES B. FRY.

DECHERD, August 26, [1862.]

Colonel HAZEN:

Is your whole force intrenched and in a position to protect the stores? Endeavor to assure yourself whether Forrest has any infantry with him. I have no doubt of your ability to drive him off easily.

D. C. BUELL,

Major-General.
