and Falmouth were easily and promptly filled without hurry or confusion. From the 15th to the 26th of June the supplies for the army then marching to the north through Virginia were forwarded by the Orange and Alexandria Railroad. From the 26th to the 30th they were sent by the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. June 22, 1863, Captain E. M. Camp, assistant quartermaster, U. S. Voluntees, reported to me for duty. He had for some time previously, while a captain in the Thirty-fifth Regiment New York Volunteers, been in charge of what is known as the Soldiers' Rest, near the Baltimore and Ohior Railroad depot, and his services being particularly valuable at that point, I made no change in his position. Under the second section of the order calling for this report, I have the honor to present two tabular statements,* the first showing my individual property accountability for the fiscal year; the second being a consolidated statement of the leading articles of expenditure and issue in the whole depot during the same period.

General Elliott was with General Lyon at the battle of Springfield; he commanded a cavalry brigade of Iowas and Michigan troops on the first and successful raid of this war upon the Ohoi and Mobile Railroad at Boonville, Miss., and was engaged and wounded at the second battle of Bull Run, 1862, at the head of his command.
