I know nothing of the two regiments referred to in the inclosed letter. Shall I order anything to them?

Respectfully,

J. GORGAS,

Colonel, P. A. C. S.
HEADQUARTERS,Richmond, Va., May 21, 1862.

General JOSEPH E. JOHNSTON,

Commanding Army of Northern Virginia:

GENERAL: The President desires to know the number of troops around Richmond, how they are posted, and the organization of the divisions and brigades; also the programme of operations which you propose. The information relative to the composition and position of your army can readily be furnished, but your plan of operations, dependent upon circumstances perhaps yet to be developed, may not be so easily explained, nor may it be prudent to commit it to paper. I would therefore respectfully suggest that you communicate your views on this subject personally to the President, which perhaps would be more convenient to you and satisfactory to him.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. E. LEE,

General.
