Please deliver the following dispatch to Captain Fredberg, who left here this morning on the dispatch-boat Perry, and will stop at you post some time to-night or to-morrow:

Major General J. J. REYNOLDS,

Mouth of White River:

The attempt to cross will probably be made at Gaines' Landing or Point Chico, Ark. Please to advise the naval officer at the mouth of White River accordingly. Your troops now in Arkansas should be withdrawn at the earliest possible moment, an. Dana's troops returned at once, unless an absolute necessity should forbid it. Keep them well together with their transports in readiness. The troops at Morganza will also be held in constant readiness to move upon your orders.

Captain FREDBERG:

(Care of Brigadier General M. K. Lawler, Morganza, La.)

Please deliver following dispatch at mouth of White River:

Major General F. STEELE,

Little Rock:

A recently captured cipher dispatch from Jeff. Davis to Kirby Smith, dated Montgomery, September 30, discloses the fact that the main portion of the rebel force west of the Mississippi is under positive orders to cross. This evidently accounts for their retiring from your line. They will probably endeavor to cross in the neighborhood of Gaines' Landing. All gun-boats and military commanders on the Mississippi have been put on their guard, and General Reynolds' force and the troops from Vicksburg should be relieved as soon as possible to watch the probable attempts at crossing. Your dispatch of the 12th [13th] just received.* It is satisfactory.

ED. R. S. CANBY,

Major-General, Commanding.

C. T. CHRISTENSEN,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Assistant Adjutant-General.
