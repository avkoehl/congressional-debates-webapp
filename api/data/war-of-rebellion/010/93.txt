No. 5. Report of Major-General William J. Hardee, C. S. Army.

CAMP NEAR MICKEY'S, April 4, 1862.

GENERAL: The cavalry and infantry of the enemy attacked Colonel Clanton's regiment, which was posted, as I before informed you, about 500 or 600 yards in advance of my lines. Colonel Clanton retired, and the enemy's cavalry followed until they came near our infantry and artillery, when they were gallantly repulsed with slight loss.

Very respectfully,

W. J. HARDEE,

Major-General.
