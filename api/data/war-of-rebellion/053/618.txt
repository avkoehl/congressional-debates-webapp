EXECUTIVE OFFICE,

Richmond, September 7, 1863.

General JOSEPH E. JOHNSTON, C. S. Army:

GENERAL: Your letter of 8th August was received on the 28th, and has been duly considered. The greater portion of it has reference to matters entirely outside of the object of my letter to you of 15th July. That letter was written for the sole purpose of showing that your repeated statements of your belief that " your authority had been limited," or that any "new position" had been assigned to you by the Executive, were not justified either by fact or legitimate inference.
