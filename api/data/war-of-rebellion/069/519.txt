Lieutenant-Colonel SMITH,Assistant Adjutant-General:

COLONEL: I regret to report that they enemy have again broken into our picket-line near the angel of the woods. I have ordered 150 additional men and hope to retake the position. My force ice very weak for the great amount of duty which it is called upon to perform. The number of men required for the picket-line and redans is so great as the seriously waken the defense of the entrenchments. I therefore most earnestly request that the Sixth-second Ohio Volunteers, which has been absent from my command nearly a month, may be returned to me.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

ALF. H. TERRY,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
