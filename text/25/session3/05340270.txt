and their honor Meanwhile, alarm pervades the
countiy The Goveinment of the United States
has been invoked to the aid of Mame. Congress
and the Executive are absorbed m the considera-
tion of ihe question Irritations have been aroused
between the people of the United States and Great
Butiin A flame has been kindled, which, it
imy be, blood only can quench War—war be-
tween two nations allied in blood and interest,
which, if it should biealcfoith, would have many
of the features of civil war, may be the lamenta-
ble consequence. Whose fault is this ' To whom
is the immediate blame imputable' To SirJohn
IIii\ey,and Sit John Harvey alone If, as he
pietends, the cus'ody of the disputed terntory
belonged to him, he should have pi evented the
tttspasses, and the omission to do that is the
first fault. But he is, above all, to be blamed for
the n^ar approach of the country to war, because
of the airogant pieténsions and gasconading
thieats in his communication of the 13th of Feb
ruaiy It was the claim on his part to the ex-
clu"si\e possession and jurisdiction of the Aroos-
took, and his menace to invade the Stite of
Maine in the asset tion of tint claim, which sum

invasion, coupled with pi (.tensions the most
odiois and uubeariblc which can be addressed
to a Ate people If Great Butain undcitnkcs to
execute these threats, if she actually invades the
United States, then, but not olliei wise, the Pies-
ldent luis authouiy by the bill to anay the phys-
ical force of the countiy to íesist and repel such
mvnsion
Tins is the piinciplc of the bill, as set foith in
the fnstsection, which section, instead of enlaig
mg the power alieady possessed by the Ptesident
to repel invasion—to do which, he may, by the
act of 1795, call into the field any numbci of men
—in fact restricts that powti, by specifying the
particular assailants against which, and the píc-
ense circumstances under which, the said bill is
to have effect
Objections have been made to the second sec-
tion, becausa it proudes foi the enlistment of
regular troops m case of invasion before the next
Congress can be convened Whether this kind
of foice, or volunteers, should be authouzed, is
a question of economy and expediency, of which
it is for the House to judge
No objection seems to have been made to the
section which places the whole naval foice of the
countiy in commission, which is, indeed, small
enough for the pi esent exigencies of the country
jNToi cin the contingent appropuation proposed
in the bill be icfused,and meie resolutions ex
pressivt of the gcneial opinion of the House be
adopted as a substitute for the bill, in the man
ner proposed by the gentleman from Virginia,
[Mr Wise,] without rendering the whole meas-
ure futile and of no avail
But, independently of these questions, a gen-
eral objection has been taken to the measure by
the gentleman frim Pennsylvania, [Mr Biddle,]
■and more especially to the ground assumed by
the bill, of resistance to any attempt, on the pait
of Gieat Butain, to enforce by arms hei claim to
the exclusive possession and jurisdiction of the
disputed terntory in Maine
Tins, it is tiue, is an incidental issue—the claim
of Great Butain, or of Sir John Harvey, to the
exclusive possession of the disputed territory—
and so far differs fi om the main issue—that of the
ultimate light to the terntory. The gentleman
fiom Pennsylvania has done full justice to the
latter question, and has declared in decisive terms
his conviction of the immovable right of the "Uni
ted States, and of the futility of the claim of Gieat
Butain, to the terntory in dispute Such, in-
deed, is the declared opinion of every other gen-
tleman who has addressed the House on the sub-
ject, and if the question of peace or war stood on
that main point, theie could, I presume, be but
one sentiment in Congress and the country as to
the duty of the United States to defend, at all
iisks, the lights of Mame and Massachusetts
But is it safe or wise to tike issue on this lnci
dental point of the contioveited right of posses-
sion ad inlcnm, pending the negotiation as to the
ultimate n¿ht of soveieignty > That is the ques-
tion
In the fust place, it is to bo remembcied that,
when theie is a controversy of long standing be
tween two nations, the immediate ciusc of war is
vi ry likely to be some suboidinate fact, Inpptn
mg in the progitss of the controversy     That is
one of the evil consequences attending the pro
tncted  discussion   of  conflicting   international
claims     The parties become embittered on both
sides, they nre each prone to regard the acts of
the othci with jealousy and suspicion, then peace
d( ponds not so much on the original merits of the
diplomatic question between them as on the acci-
dents of daily collision
Anil this consideration affords an answerto the
su^/i stions madi outofdoois—not, I believe, in
tins debite—of the inconvenience of having the
pcici of tht whole United Staffs subject to be put
to h iraid by the excess of zeal of any one of the
StaK s whose interest is moic immediately afftcled
by some pending national controveisy I do not
admit that, thus fai, the State of Maine has done
wiong, oi exceeded its constitutional poweis, in
this matter And to the practical inconvenience
heie suggested, my íeply is, that it exists in all
such cases, and wheie two nations have a grave
question, of long duiation, between them, they
are always liable to be involved in war by the
acts of individuals, oi of inferior officeis, military
or civil, oi, as heie, of a single State, by reason
of incidental difficulties glowing up out of the
mam one, for winch the whole country is and
must be icsponsible, though its Government may
not have been the immediate party. This incon-
venience is not peculiar to the United States, or
imputable altogether to the separate action of
eithei of the States
Secondly, supposing this incidental i3suc to be
less favorable to us than the main one, that is our
misfortune, not our fault Who raised this issue '
The United States oi the State of Maine* By no
means The State of Maine did that which it had
a lawful right to do, it senta posse to the Aroostook
to duve away the tiespassers Thereupon, Su
John Haivey, in the spnit of airogance common
to military Governois of remote colonies, sets up
the claim of NewBiunswick to the exclusive pos
session of the terntory in dispute, and marches
his tioops to invade the United States The State
of Maine lesiststhiselaim of exclusne possession,
the United States íesist it They must do this,
they have no alternative left them but íesistance
to a false claim, or a tame acquiescence m it,
which \v ould be disgraceful to the United States,
and would but prompt the continued aggression
of Great Butain And if Sir John Haivey pio-
ceeds to execute his tin eat, and to mai ch his ti oops
into Maine, that State would be iecreant to herself
if she did not muster to the defense of bet soil,
and the Federal Government would be false to its
obvious an'd imperative constitutional duty, if it
did not prepare also to back the State of Maine
in the defense of her soil, which is at the same
time the soil of the United States
We do not propose by this bill any act of ag-
gression agamstGreat Britain upon this incidental
point Still less do we undeitake, by aggression
in regard to this point, to bring on a resort to
arms to enfoice a settlement of the main point
The bill is a purely defensive measure, and we
have no choice m this matter We must, of ne-
cessity, withstand aggiession in the thing, and
upon the issue presented to us by the aggressor
And if Sir John Harvey presumes to invade the
State of Mame in the assertion of this claim, and
he is upheld in this by his Government, the fact
that it is an incidental question, oi that the right
in it is less incontrovertibly with us than upon
the main question, will, in no sort, weaken the
strength of our cause in íegard to that which
after all, would be the tiue ground of hostilities,
namely: the unfounded and iniquitous claim on
the pait of Great Butain to the ultimate sovei-
eignty of one third of the State of Maine, a claim
which is denounced and repudiated by us on all
hands
But is this an issue unsafe or unwise to be
joined by the United State35 I cannot admit that
it is
To begin, the question of possession is one
which, fiom its nituic, is peculiarly intelligible
to cveiybody, while that is not the fact as to the
question of light To undeistand the question
of right fully, it needs to examine a vast body of
documentary matter, in which the proofs are con-
tained, it needs to read and study the treaties
and diplomatic coirespondence between the two
Governments, it needs to throw off the mass of
chicanery and of disingenuous pretensions and
of perveision of fact and aigument under which
the ministeis and agents of Great Britain have
succeeded m burying the simple merits of the
case, it needs to grasp a complex question, and
to bo mastei of it in all its parts and its general
whole Not so in regard to the question now
piesented—whether the United States will repel
invasion undertaken by Great Britain while the
right is in controversy That is the familiar case
of a trespass committed on my land by a grasp-
ing ncighboi Whether he can make out a good
title in law, and oust me by the judgment of a
competent tnbunal, is a thing requiring, perhaps,
mucli discussion, and by wise and learned men,
befoie it can be piopeily determined But if,
pending the suit, he enters my close, and under-
takes to drive me out and hold exclusive pos-
session of it regardless of all the presumptions
of light, that is an act of aggiession which every
one understands at a glance, and which would
justify me in repelling force with force And
that is the issue, plain, intelligible, practical,
which Sir John Hai vey has presented to the State
of Maine, and which the Executive has met in
the documents before us, and which Congress is
called upon to meet in the fiist section of the
bill repoited by the Committee on Foreign Af-
fans
That Great Butain has no such right of pos-
session, unless conferred upon her by express
agieement of the United States, is admitted by
every one, because the assumed ground of right
is the odious pretension which I had occasion to
comment upon a few days since, that, whenever
Great Butain chooses to lay claim to any part of
the United Stated, she is thereupon to be taken
and intended as being constructively in posses-
sion of the parts so claimed, in virtue of her be-
ing mother country, and former sovereign of the
country, and, as such, to enter upon the exclusive
jurisdiction of it until the claim be settled Such
a claim of right, arrogant and unbearable as it is,
no citizen of the United States will deign to listen
to or entertain for a moment
Has Great Britain ever, in fact, had the exclu-
sive possession and jurisdiction of the territory
in dispute' Never Whatever lights she may
have claimed, whatever acts she may have per-
formed, in the valley of the Aroostook, certain it
is that acts have been continually performed by
the States of Massachusetts and Maine wholly
incompatible with the Supposition of the practical
exercise of exclusive jurisdiction on the part of
Gieat Butain    It may be that McLaughlin, the
