HDQRS. DEPT. OF NORTH CAROLINA AND SOUTHERN VA.,June 14, 1864.

GENERAL: In forwarding my report of the battle of Drewry's Bluff, May 16, it seems necessary that it should be accompanied by an explanation of the apparent inconsistency of its conclusion with my Special Orders, Numbers 11, May 17, 1864, relieving the commander of the left wing and commending in high terms his conduct of his command in battle. A copy of that order is annexed.* When it was issued I still assumed that he had properly left and estimated the obstacles and hostile force reported by him in his immediate front, and that his reports were to be accepted as maturely considered and substantially accurate. Subsequent investigation, necessarily requiring time, has, I regret to say, brought me to a different conviction.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. T. BEAUREGARD,

General.

General S. COOPER,

Adjt. and Insp. General C. S. Army, Richmond, Va.
