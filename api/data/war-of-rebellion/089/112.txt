My corps is disposed as follows: Terry on right, holding Kautz's position of this morning, across the Darbytown road, with strong skirmish line; his brigades massed on Foster's right.

I have ordered General Kautz to move up from near Spring Hill, where he now is, and, reporting to Terry for this purpose, to take position to strengthen his right and flanks at daybreak. That may enable you to look a little more to your left. You can also order up your regiment from Deep Bottom.
