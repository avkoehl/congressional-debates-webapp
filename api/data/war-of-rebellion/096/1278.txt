HEADQUARTERS FIRST ARMY CORPS,March 2, 1865.

Lieutenant General R. S. EWELL,

Commanding Department of Richmond:

I have the honor to acknowledge receipt of your communication of this date. What number of local troops, in addition to Major General Custis Lee's division, could be relied on in an emergency, and how soon could they be turned out? Of course it is understood they are alone subject to the call of the Secretary of War. To-morrow will be time enough for this information.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

O. LATROBE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS DIVISION,March 2, 1865.

Major R. P. DUNCAN,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

MAJOR: I have nothing special to report this morning. One of Elliott's and four of Wise's brigades deserted to the enemy; those of Wise's occupied adjacent pits, and, favored by darkness, escaped attention at first; they were, however,discovered and fired at, but without effect before reaching the enemy.

Very respectfully, yours.

B. R. JOHNSON,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIRST ARMY CORPS,March 2, 1865.

Major General FITZ LEE,

Commanding, &amp;c.:

A telegram has just been received from General R. E. Lee, directing that you assemble your cavalry; that General Early has been defeated at Waynesborough, and there is no organized force in front of the enemy. You will therefore hold your command in readiness for what ever orders you may receive.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

O. LATROBE,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Assistant Adjutant-General.
