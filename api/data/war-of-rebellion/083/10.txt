COLONEL: A small detachment of the Ninth Cavalry, Missouri State Militia under Sergeant Koontze, fought Holtzclaw and his guerrillas yesterday morning six miles from Fayette, in Howard County. Two of the guerrillas were killed and one wounded. Our loss one killed and claw and his party were at breakfast at the residence of one Henry Miller, where they had been for several hours, but not one of the citizens of that loyal neighborhood reported the presence of the guerrillas to Major Leonard, who was in less than an hour's ride, with force sufficient to have destroyed the entire band.

GENERAL: Sergeant Koontze, of this command, with fifteen men, had a skirmish yesterday, six miles from Fayette, with Holtzclaw and twenty-five other guerrillas. Our loss one killed and one wounded. Holtzclaw's loss two killed and one wounded. The guerrillas scattered; they were getting their breakfast at the house of one Henry Miller; had been there all morning; no one reported the presence of these guerrillas, although there was ample opportunity. Colonel Williams is here; he reports 150 guerrillas in the Perche Hills,and I suppose he will start for there forthwith.
