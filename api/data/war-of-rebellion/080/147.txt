HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,July 31, 1864-9.30 p.m.

Major-General BURNSIDE, Commanding Ninth Corps:

Your dispatch explanatory of that in relation to the loss in your corps yesterday is received. The major-general commanding directs me to say that the order for withdrawal did not authorize or justify its being done in the manner in which, judging from your brief report, it appears to have been executed, and that the matter should be inquired into by a court. The major-general commanding notices that the time and manner of withdrawal were left to the brigade commanders on the spot. He desires to know why there was not a division commander present where several brigades were engaged, and by whom the withdrawal could have been conducted.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,July 29, 1864-9.45 p.m.

Major-General ORD, Commanding Eighteenth Corps:

Your dispatch of 9.25 p.m. is received. The commanding general does not consider it necessary for General Burnside to wait for your troops to relieve his in the trenches. General Burnside can form his troops for the assault without reference to yours, and your troops can file into the trenches at any time after they are vacated. General Burnside is telegraphed to that effect.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-general and Chief of Staff.

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,July 30, 1864-4.50 a.m.

Major-General ORD, Commanding Eighteenth Corps:

General Burnside is ordered if his mine has failed to open all his batteries and assault at once. You will consider the orders the same as if the mine had exploded, and the assault made in consequence.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.

Just before this was finished the mine exploded and the batteries opened. It was not sent.

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,July 30, 1864-6 a.m.

Major-General ORD, Commanding Eighteenth Corps:

The major-general commanding directs that you at once move forward your corps rapidly to the crest of the hill independently of General Burnside' troops and make a lodgment there, reporting the result as soon as attained.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
