CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
.¿etuated by an honorable motive? How could they tell whe
.Xiberthis motive was really agitation and mischief? They
^ could not tell, unless gifted with the spirit of Ommscence to
dive into the inmost recesses of his sou! and discover what mo
tive actuated him How could they tell that he was influenced
by base, improper, and treasonable motives'* Jn attempting to
decide it they were anogatmg to themselves the power of Om
mscence
He would close with a remark as to the consequence of this
proceeding, if itwaacained out The peopled this country,
in framing this glorious Constitutionjiad exempted them from
being broughtin question elsewhere than on this floor for any
thing they might say here Their object was to secure the
most unbounded liberty of speech and action, but they had im
posed on them a limit They had said Congress should pass
rules, and for a breach of those rules thev might expel a mem
ber by the consent of two thirds But this was for violating the
rules, and not for the mode of action which a man might con
scientously take here
What was their action? Was it to get at the gentleman from
Massachusetts lor violating the rules of order? lie simply rose
m his place and presented a petition Was it a disorderly pro
ceeding, within the meaning of the Constitution^ No What,
then, were they attempting? It was to punish the gentleman
under the declaration he had raftde, for the manner m which he
conceived himself bound, and m duty bound, to represent a por
non of the people of Massachusetts—en oneously as he (Mr U)
thought But could they punish him foi that motive? And sup
pose that they did it, they had already excited a coasi
derable spirit of hostility by the 21st rule, judging from
the petitions sent here Now, in addition to that, if
they inflicted punishment upon this man, who would go
home and tell his constituents that he had considered the
liberty of petition coextensive with that of speech, and
he had thrown in every thing that had been foi warded to him,
for which he had received this treatment at their hands what
would they say? "If he, then Representative, was compelled
to associate with such men, they would cut loose the bonds uf
the Union " He told them to beware how they put it into the
power of the gentleman from Massachusetts to go heme and
tell his constituents that he wasa martyrto the rightof petition
lie said to his Southern fnends, beware how you doit" It
seemed to him that no good could come out of it, and from
the bottom of his soul he believed great harm would result
He, therefore, appealed to them to abstain from it
Mr ARNOLD next obtained the floor, but, at the solicita
tionofMi Butts, yieidedit to that gentleman foi a few mo
ments
Mi BOTTSsaidhe hid listened with very great pleasure
to the warm and patriotic remarks of the gentleman from Ken
tucky, [Mr Underwood,] and should have been perfectly con-
tent to have submitted the question to the House at this time,
but that he differed so widely from the views ol the majority
of this Houhe, as indicated by the votes tt ken, and so widely
from a laigt. majority of his colleagues upon this fl ior, and the
¡Southern rl legation m general, that he did not feel himself it
liberty to have the question taken without submitting his views
on this important subject, and, m doing this, he did not mean
to become pledgtd to defend the general course of the gentle
man fiom Massachusetts The gtntleman had said and done
many things on this floor which did not meet his approbation,
and m saying this he meant no disrespect to the gentleman from
Massachusetts He must lose all íespect for himself before he
could bring himself to wound the feelings of that venerable
gentleman, and he meant no imputation on any other g ntle
man lie had givei#sotne evidence of these things When
ihe gentleman had asked on Satuiday last to defend himself
from the clurge oi monomanu, he had voted to grant permit
Bion When he thought the gentleman had trespassed on and
abused the courtesy of tha Hous,e he withlrew that leave, and
yethe wibpieparul to make many apologies foi his couise
From what he hadseerf of that gentleman on this floor, he wa->
inclined to believe that he c\pie-*sed very many sentiment  in
the in liability of the weight of yeai-, that hung on him, which
his own calm íeílection would condemn There was enough
ou this flooi passing under Jus immedu e observation to pro

The gentleman had presented to this Ho jsc \ petition, not aak
mg that Congress bhould dissolve this Union by an act of legis
latum, but that Congress should devise measuies by which the
peaceful di-ssolutinn m iy be effected The gentleman from
Massachusetts, standing here as one of the patnots of the land
after having been in the seivice of the country for half a ccn
tury, with one foot standing— he would sav ií the gentleman
would pardon him—on the veigeof the giavc, asked that the

Mr WM BUTLER here requested the gentleman from Vn>
giniato state to what member  from  South Carolina he re«
ferred to
Mr JBOTTS said he had referred to Mr Rhett
Mr  RHETT said, excepting this, [a laugh,] he had brought
to the House the document containing the fact, from which he
was about proceeding to read, when—
Mr ARNOLD said he hoped that this would be postponed.
Mr BOTTS said he yielded the floor only for an explana-
tion    [Cries of, no, no 3
Mr RHETT said he wanted no explanation, except that the
gentleman would allow the document to which he had refei
red to be read, or a short extract of it, to show the real charac-
ter of what he (Mr R ) at that time did and said The reso
lution  were intended as an amendment to a proposition to
abolish slavery in the District of Colombia submitted in the
form of msti uctions by the gentleman from Vermont
Ihe SPEAKER, (addressn g Mr Botts ) Does the gentle-
man yield the floorí
Mr BOTTS said he had no objection but other members
seemed to object If the gentleman had the resolution, and
would give it to him, he would read it
Mr RHETT íequested leave to explain, not by any upw
words of his, but by the wotds on which the gentleman relied
for his accusation He held m his hand a pamphlet fiom
which he requested leave to read a single page It was a
pamphlet containing an address to his constituents, contain
ing the resolutions alluded to, with a narration of the circum
stances under which they were prepared It recites that they
were written at his seat, but not offeied to the Hou^e, during a
speech delivered by thegentleman from Vermont, [Mi Slade,]
who was discussing the subject of slavery in Virginia It was
on that memorable occasion when the Southern members left
their seats and went down stairs to deliberate together on this
wanton aggression of their common interests lie then read
the following extiacts
"Befóte entering upon the merits nftheresolutions, however,
permit me to remark, (what I suppose might be apparent to
all ; that I had no expectation of passing them, or of even tak
mg a vote upon them They were intended as amendments to
a motion to refer with instructions to leport a bill abolishing
slavery m the District of Columbia I expected them to share
the fate which inevitably awaited the original motion, so soon
a5  the floor could have been obtained, viz tobe laid upon the
table My design in presenting them was, to place before
Congress and the people what, in my opinion, was the true
issue upon this great and vital question, and to point out the
course of policy by whieh it should be met by the Southern
States    The resol utions ai e as follows
------"and the Constitution of the United States having proved
inadequate t© protect the Southern States in the peaceable en
joy ment of their rights and pioperty, it is expedient that the said
Constitution should be amended, oi the Union of the States be
dissolved
"Resolved, That i committee of two membeis fiom each
State in the Union be appointed, to repoit upon the expediency
and practicability of amending the Constitution, or the best
means of peaceably dissolving the Union         *           *           '
' If, then, fellow citizens the South is no lonsrer in the peace
able enjoy merit of her lights and peculiar institution11, under
the Constitution of the United States, the question aiisesupon
the second pioposition in the resolution Is it expedient that
the Constitution should be amended, or the Union be dis
solved?
"Those, of course, who design using the Union and the Con
stitution foi the purpose of destroying the institution of slavery
in the South, will iecogni¡=e no such expediency With them
the bonds of the Union constitute the cords by which they pi o
pose to bind the victim to the altai With such designs, next
to the atrocity of holding slaves, will be the least resistance to
the means by which they expect to accomplish their purpose
Irutors themselves to the Constitution and every principle of
futh or honoL which brought u& together, they may imagine
that, by clamorously accusing others oi a wart of fidelity to
their constitutional engagements they may conceal their own
base perfidy towards theirs, and when they suppose that we can
be fnahtened into an abandonment of our rights by the cry of
'disunion,' they only prove how c>oon we despise those whom
we have w ronged With those, howevei, who have any regaid
foi their own nsrhtsor the Union, the expediency of one of these
alternatives will be easily undeistood The evil must be ai
tested It is vain, utterly vain, to suppose that the South will
submit to the present «tatt of things Peace wt, must have, in or
out of the Uoioi Our fust duty i<- to endeavoi to obtain it con

deiacy It has been through the Constitution, under the cover
of the Union, that our security has been threatened and our

the Abolitionists only but the Northei n people generally) affect

and adopted by the constitutional majoiitj, the South will have

Mr BOTTS con mued He was very willing to heat fiom
the gent'eman the arguments for the motion he had proposed to
make It ^as enough foi him to know that a member of the
House had piepared and was ready to offer a resolution to effect
a dissolution of the Union He did not understand him whethei
he asked leave to offei it
fMi Rhett    I did not ]
Mr B Yet the gentleman himself, who had prepared a reso
lut-ion, and was ready an 1 wa ting only the opportunity to pre-
sent it to the House, that tne House should proceed to dissolve
the Union, that gentleman voted against laying on the table the
proposition to censure or expel the gentleman from Massachu-
setts It was not only the doctrine of the gentleman from South
Carolina, but of his whole State, ora majority of that State
They held that they had a right to secede from the Union If
one State had a right to secede, thirteen had The separation
of one dissolved the Union. The barrel falls to pieces ihe mo-
ment one stave is taken from the hoop Gentlemen would ex
cuse him for saying, with his knowledge of * hat had transpired •*
m this House, that this had appeared to him a great farce from          \
the beginning—a perfect storm m a teapot    Talk aborft cen-        ^
suring the gentleman from Massachusetts'   Look at the other   ^ ,,
end of this avenue1?   There they found aman standing at the    X^
head of the right arm of the defence of this nation—he meant    "v>
the Secretary of the Navy—who, the last time he had hada     V/
conversation with him on the subject, was an open, avowed,
undisguised advocate of the  immediate dibsolutiou of the
Union
Mr Wise    I deny it
Mr  Botts    What authority have you**   Do you keep a re-
cord of the conversations of the Secretary of the Navy
[Cries of "oi der," ' order "
Mr WISE said he hoped his colleague would not fiy into a
flame He did not mean to offend him, but to say this, that he
did not believe any man as authority, from conversation, from
reading or any other source, for saying that the present Secre-
tary ol the Navy ever went for the unqualified dissolution of
the Union If he ever advanced this idea of dissolution, he
(Mr W ) undertook to say now in his place, and would mk it
on his authority, that, if he ever avowed such a doctrine, it was
on qualifications, conditions, and reasons which the Secretary
could defend
Mi BOTTS said he had been induced, foi some time, to re-
gard his colleague as the keeper of the concience of the King,
but had not considered him the keeper of the consciences of alt
connected with the King r-.or did he recognise the right to say
what wa& the opinion expiessed by one of the Secretaries of
Mr Tyler's admimstiation He (Mr B ) asserted on his own
responsibility that he had expressed such an idea He had talk
ed with him for hours, and when the Secietary of the Navy
denied it, he (Mr B) would prove his statement You (said
Mr B addressing himself to Mr ¿Wise) have no right to de-
ny it
The SPEAKER said the gentleman had no right to address
a member on this floor
Mr BOTTS legated that, when the Secretary of the Navy
denied it, he would undertake to prove his statement. He
challenged him to the pioof If there were to be any charges
for high treason, he demanded that the Secretary of the Navy
should beput on his tiial He was the man Do not talk
about expelling the venerable gentleman from this hall who
was discharging his duty He believed the gentleman would
present any petition He was but discharging what he regard
edasa constitutional and conscientious obligation by present-
ing the petition here Foi his part, if he were not afraid the
gentleman wouldabuse this couitesy,he should be most happy
to afford him the opportunity of presetting that paper to the
American people, to set forth in sfikmg lights the horrors
which would íesult from the dissolution of the Union, and he
had no doubt but it would operate as a corrective He (Mr.
B ) had bepn looking for thi-^ foi some yeais past He had been
pttdicung that it would result man application from the North-
ern States of this kind He believed that the fatal 21st rule had
been the entering wedge to that excitement which the gentie
man from Massachusetts had said was increasing When the
Noithem States got the power of denying the right to the
Southern btates of presenting any petition which they might
consider i grievance, he ventured to say they would have
such petitions from the South
He regarded that impiopet designs had been imputed to the
gentleman fiom Massachusetts on this floor His course had
been dictated fiom the puiest consideiations of patriotism He
íesaided the gentleman, as having been tieated with cruel seve-
l ity by the Repiesentatives in this body, and he hoped the ques
tion would have been taken without an angry debate If he
had not received the .floor from the gentleman lrom Tennessee,
he would himself have moved to lay the whole subject on the
table He hoped the gentleman would follow up his íemarks
with this motion
Mr ARNOLD of Tennessee said we had truly "fallen on evil
times" What a spectacle had that House piesented for the
last three or four days, he might say the last five days, and, in
deed, since its first assembling at the extia session' He might
even go further hack than that, for the last seven years seer es
of thib kind had been occurnng, and with increasing fiequency,
and giowingwoise and worse, till now a stranger could not
contemplate that House from the galleiy without being remind
ed of the bloody French revolution It wan impossible to íe
store or to preserve order, the Speakei had done every thug
in his power, but in vain What could the puny aim of any
¡speakei effect when gentlemen openly braved the authority
both of the Speaker and of the House"? Mr A went on to al
lude to somepaiticu ais of disoidei which had recentlvoccui
reí, during which 1 o w< s sevbial time  interrupted, ^nd expla-
nations passed, but Mr A | reclaimed himself as belonging to
thp peace party, and desired to avoid common to personal colli
sions wi h gentlemen lie appealed to gentlemen in behalf of
the order ol the Iiou^e, and in the name of that country for
which his and their fathers had fought and bled [A laugh ]
Could gentleman laugh at that? If they did, he asked if ban-
ditti could behave Y*orbei [Roars of laughter j He was en-
tirely sellout and nothing was iuither from his puipose than
to piovoke merriment, jokes weie now out of time as well as
out of plac*1
Mr A went on to aigue on the necessity of observing order.
If gentlemen were determined to resist the authority of the bo-
dy, they ought to leave it He alluded to a contest during the
called session m which his life had been m imminent peril
from personal violence, and during the present session, and
within a few days, he had been bullied, apparently by concert
and undersftnding Tor the offence he had committed m call
mg the gent'eman from North Caiolina [Mr Rayner] to or-
tlei, a membei ot this House—he was told he was a member of
this House—came to his seat and attempted to bully him Ano-
ther member, who came from Alabama, came to hi3 seat at the
same time, under very great excitement-
Mr PAÍ NE of Alabama presumed that the gentleman al-
luded to him    Didl said he, make any remark to you
Mt ARNOLD    No, you said nothing     It was not in or-
der to inleirogate the gentleman, but he wished to ask him—
The SPEAKER said the gentleman from Tennessee was not
in order.
