It appears from the foregoing that there have been declared exchanged-

Of rebel troops reduced to privates. . . . . . . . . . . . . . 46,269

Federal troops reduced to privates. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 23,056

--------

Leaving the rebels indebted to us in order to

adjust the informal declarations already made. . . . 23,213

The adjustment being supposed to be made, the state of the prisoners would be thus:

Rebel troops reduced to privates on parole, and

subject to be exchanged. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 19,814

Federal troops reduced to privates on parole,

and subject to be exchanged. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 8,223

--------

Excess of rebels. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 11,591

This number of 11,591 would be due to us after exchanging a sufficient number of the 19,814 to balance the 8,223 of Federal troops now on parole in the North, which would about balance the number of Federal prisoners held in the South.

This statement leaves us the undisputed possession of all of the rebel prisoners now in the North under Federal guards.

By a recent notice in the newspapers of an exchange declared by Mr. Ould it appears that besides rebel prisoners delivered at City Point to January 1, 1864, covered by this declaration, Mr. Ould
