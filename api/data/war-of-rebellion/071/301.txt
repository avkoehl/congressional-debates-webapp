has left Maryland, as I suppose he has, he should have upon his heels veterans, militiamen, men on horseback, and everything that can be got to follow to eat out Virginia clear and clean as far as they go, so that crows flying over it for the balance of this season will have to carry their provender with them.

CITY POINT, VA., July 14, 1864-2 p. m. (Received 6. 50 a. m. 15th.)

Major-General HALLECK,

Washington, D. C.:

For the last few days I have made every effort to ascertain whether the enemy have further detached to send north. He shows everywhere as strong a front as he has done from the start, and deserters constantly coming in locate every division of Longstreet's and Hill's corps and Beauregard's force. If any detachments have been made it has been brigades and not divisions, and I have no evidence of even this having been done. I received a communication from Lee, dated the 10th, showing his presence at that time, but I received one dated the 13th from Beauregard in answer to one directed to Lee. This I do not understand. It seems to me that by promptly pushing the enemy he can be driven from Maryland with great loss. Now, however, it will be necessary to hold force enough in the city to hold the enemy at bay, if he should attack, until re-enforcements can be got. I have sent Ord four batteries from here, and will direct him to push out, and, at least, develop the enemy in his front and drive him if he can. Not being able to communicate with all the commanders, it will be hard to get anything like unity of action, but if they will push boldly from all quarters the enemy will certainly be destroyed. If I find further detachments have been sent from here I will make a determined push to obtain a firm foothold that will ultimately secure Richmond and be easily held, and detach all I can.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

CITY POINT, VA., July 14, 1864-3 p. m. (Received 7. 30 a. m. 15th.)

Major-General HALLECK,

Washington, D. C.:

Dispatch from Mr. Dana, just received, indicated the enemy leaving Maryland. If so, instructions ought to be sent to Fortress Monroe directing the Nineteenth Corps as they ready there to be sent here. Ord telegraphs a rumor in Baltimore that the enemy have sent to Point Lookout to rescue prisoners there. This can hardly be possible in view of the narrow outlet though which they would have to go in passing Washington with them. I call attention to the rumor, however, that you may direct the proper steps, if such a thing should be possible. I think it well to notify the Navy Department of this, that they may prevent the possibility of an attempt to cross the Potomac in boats.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
