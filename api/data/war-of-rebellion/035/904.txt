Your telegram received. Do you understand the force that captured Caudillo as threatening the Salt Works/ I suppose it was only a marauding party. If any force is moving on the Satl-Works, General Williams, commanding at that point, has orders to co-operate with General Preston. Where is General Prestoin?
