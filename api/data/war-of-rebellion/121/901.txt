GENERAL: I have the honor to forward herewith the surgeon's report in reference to the health of state prisoner J. Davis. In seeing him every day I have been unable to discover the change.

[Inclosure.]

FORT MONROE, VA., April 25, 1866.

Major General N. A. MILES,

Commanding District of Fort Monroe, Fort Monroe, Va.:

SIR: I would respectfully report that the general health of state prisoner Jefferson Davis is not as good as at my last report. His appetite is failing and his muscular strength is diminishing. He shows an incipient tottering in his gait. I would recommend increased exercise in the open air. This will in all probability reinvigorate him and give increased tone to his muscular movements.

Your obedient servant,

GEO. E. COOPER,

Surgeon, U. S. Army.

Washington, April 26, 1866.

Major General N. A. MILES, U. S. Volunteers,

Commanding, &amp;c., Fort Monroe, Old Point Comfort, Va.:

SIR: The President directs that Mrs. Varina Davis be permitted to visit her husband, Jefferson Davis, now a prisoner at Fort Monroe under such restrictions as may be deemed proper. Mrs. Davis has offered to give such parole as may be required of her in consideration of the permission being given her. You will therefore require her parole in writing that she will engage in or assent to no measures which shall lead to any attempt to escape from confinement on the part of her husband, or to his being rescued or released from imprisonment without the sanction and order of the President of the United States. This parole being given you will permit Mrs. Davis to visit her husband as freely and as often as may be consistent with his safe-keeping, imposing only such restrictions upon him and upon her as may be requisite to that end. This order to continue so long as Mrs. Davis may desire to continue her visit or until you are otherwise directed.

By order of the President of the United States:

E. D. TOWNSEND,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

WAR DEPARTMENT, ADJUTANT-GENERAL'S OFFICE,

Mrs. VARINA DAVIS, Montreal, Canada East:

The President has granted you permission to visit your husband. You will find the order and conditions to be observed on arriving at Fort Monroe. Please acknowledge receipt.

E. D. TOWNSEND,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
