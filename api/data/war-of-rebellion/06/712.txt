Mississippi River, Head of Passes, April 8, 1862.

Brigadier General ARNOLD,

Commanding Fort Pickens, Fla.:

DEAR GENERAL: Nothing would give me more pleasure than to co-operate with you in your designs against Pensacola, but you must be aware that I am on the eve of attacking New Orleans, and my orders are such that I cannot look at any other place until I succeed or fail in this.

If I succeed, Pensacola comes in turn, but not the first; still I hope to be able to gratify your wishes soon.

Until then I remain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

D. G. FARRAGUT,

Flag-Officer Western Gulf Blockading Squadron.

Brigadier General LEWIS G. ARNOLD,

Commanding Department of Florida:

GENERAL: I regret that we are unable to co-operate with you at present in the capture of Pensacola, as the presence of my troops and transports is necessary, as soon as possible, in the Mississippi River.

Should you not have taken that place before my return hither I shall take pleasure in sending you any assistance that may be necessary, and I trust you will not fail to call upon me at all times for any aid I can render you.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

BENJ. F. BUTLER,

Commanding Department of the Gulf, Ship Island:

GENERAL: I have just received your note of the 10th instant. I regret that the "fortune of war" will not permit you to co-operate with me in the taking of Pensacola, &amp;c., at this time, for I am convinced that if the co-operation suggested by your assistant adjutant-general could have been entirely successful; and so hopeful was I, that my orders have been issued and arrangements made with that view.

I must thank you for the patriotic and soldierly tender of your aid and co-operation at any future time, as expressed in the closing paragraph of your note, and I take this occasion to reciprocate the same kind and delicate sentiments, by offering you anything that you may require within my limited command that will benefit the public service.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
