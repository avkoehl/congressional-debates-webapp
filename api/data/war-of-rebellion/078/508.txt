CHATTANOOGA, September 28, 1864.

Major-General THOMAS:

The following telegram has just been received from General Milroy:

Forrest left Pulaski last night, moving south. General Rousseau supposes he will turn east and strike road, so my cavalry scouts, twelve miles west, have not reported his approach, but I am expecting him within the next twelve hours. Railroad and telegraph lines all right.

R. H. MILROY,

Major-General.

I desire to know whether I am in command of troops in this district. I have assumed command of such. If not confirmed in this by the major-general commanding, I desire to leave for Key West, in obedience to the orders of the Secretary of War. I have made all dispositions and given all instructions in regard to the defense from Chattanooga to Bridgeport that I deem necessary, and I wish to be confirmed in my action. We positively need a brigade for Lookout Mountain. The major-general commanding is opposed [to my] desire to leave, but I cannot remain unless I am confirmed in the action which I have taken in order to carry out his own order.

JNO NEWTON,

Brigadier-General.
