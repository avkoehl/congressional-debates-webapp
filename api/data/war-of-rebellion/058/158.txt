Allen, it would give us the use of the two heavy locomotives now used on passenger trains. I am all the time in excess of the moving power furnished here. Have this change made and the thing will soon be over.

HDQRS. DETACHMENT SIXTH ILLINOIS CAVALRY,South Memphis, January 20, 1864.

Captain S. L. WOODWARD,

Asst. Adjt. General, Cavalry Division, Sixteenth Army Corps:

CAPTAIN: In obedience to the order of Brigadier-General Grierson, I arrive at the Macon crossing of Wolf River at daybreak this morning, and found that the boat I was sent to destroy had been destroyed last Thursday by some of our forces. I reconnoitered the river above and below the crossing,but found nothing.

Your obedient servant,

F. CHARLESWORTH,

Captain, Commanding Detachment.
HEADQUARTERS U. S. FORCES,Natchez, Miss., January 20, 1864.

Colonel B. G. FARRAR,

Commanding Post of Vidalia:

COLONEL: It has been represented that refugees and deserters from the Confederate army are held at Vidalia, an told they must enlist in the Thirtieth Missouri volunteers or be sent north as prisoners of war.

Three men have just reported to me that they were forced into the Thirtieth Missouri by false representations, made by some of the officers of that regiment.

It is right to recruit for the regiment, but you will see that men are not detained against their will, and that all men held by said regiment against their will are released - I mean men who have voluntarily left the rebel lines and sought the protection of the U. S. forces.

I am, colonel, very respectfully,

W. Q. GRESHAM,

Brigadier-General.
