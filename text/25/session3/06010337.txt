River and Harbor Improvements—Mr. Martin.
Ho. of Reps.
of arlifical harbors as places of íesort and refuge,
and that in the natuial condition of Lake Erie
theie are no harbois. All our harbors upon that
coast are aitificial, often, and I may say gener-
ally, made at a small expense, compared with
iheir impoitance. 1 read now, sir, the general
remaiks of Mr Smith, the general supeimtendent
of most of the public works on Lake Erie, con-
tained in his iepoit of last year, and which pre-
cede the particular descuption of each work under
ins charge*
" Until the commencement of the system of improve-
ment ot the lake harbois by the Government of the United
Slates, tlie immense extent oí country occupying the south
shore of Lake Erie, or dependent on it for commercial fa-
cilities wat, a wilderness i lie navigation of tne lake was
attended with the utmost delay, difficulty, and danger The
mouths of the several streams emptying themselves into
the lake were uniformly obstructed by sand and vegetable
matter, cieating stagnant bodies of water winch overflowed
the lowlands for miles, geiiera'mg an atmosphere winch
tendered the country nearly uninhabitable from disease , at
the same tune that the sire uns themselves were entirely
inaccesible as a lefuge for vessels, "md in all respects an
evil rather than a benefit to thesuriouiiding country it is
almost unnecessary to say that thcjudicious improvements
made under the acts of Congress have entirely changed all
this, and manv millions ot acres ol land of the most fertile
description, embracing the western portion of the State of
3\ew York, the northern part of Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indi-
ana, and Illinois, and the whole ot Michigan, owe their
present settlement and improvement, in a very great degree,
to this cause These improvements have also been the
direct c luse of the unexampled sales of the public lands m
the northwestern States and Territories, lving along or de
pendent on the great lakes tor their principal mems of
access and commeiee The mouths ol the Huron, Black
river, Cuvahoga Grand river, Ashtabula, and Conneaut—
across each of which the beach of the lake was continuous,
and the only diaiu for winch w is by filtration through the
sand—were op< ned, and kept open by p ers and other im
provements, beacon lighthouses have been erected, and
these streams, as vv ell as other works at the east end ot the
'ak>>, now afford secure harbors, accessible at all times to
vesstlsnavigatngthe lake The niiprovementat the mouth
of the Raisin, the only one on Lake Ene within the State
of Michigan, is of similar character, though from its gieater
difficulties it has been rather more expensive  '
This extiact furnishes much matter for reflec-
tion, it clearly sustains my position that the
commerce on the lake is dependent upon the har-
bors, and that without them, it could not be suc-
cessfully prosecuted. Observe thatmany of those
rivers in the mouths of which our vessels now
find safety from the storms, and upon which are
now located many of the finestand most flourish-
ing cities and villages of Ohio, formerly found
their way into the lake by filtration through the
sand thrown up by the action of the water In
times of freshet or high water, they would open
a passage for themselves into the lake, and the
improvement now consists simply in extend-
ing paiallel pieis oi jetties into the lake to a suffi-
cient depth of water, and beyond the action of the
beach or sand, and thus confining the current of
the river, and enabling it, at all times, to preserve
a cleat and open channel
Mr Smith stated further that
"These works, originally but experiments, though now
found so admirably to answer the purpose for which ttiey
were designed, were built of perishable materials, it is
generally to render them permanent, that the appropriations
are recommended on the estimates lor the coining year
The nat reof the pe manentiinpioveinciiiistoremove the
woodwork ol the pier ;already muchdtcaved, to tin depth
of two leet below low water mark, and erect on the old
foundation a superstructure of stone Unless this course
is adopted without del ty, the action of time and the ele
ments will speedily render useless all that has been found
of such vast benefit to the commerce of the West This has
been dour at Buffalo heietotore, and has since m> 1u>t re
port, been, iinderthe appropriation of last vear, fairlv com
meuced at Cleveland Bj using the old work as a ft unda-
tion, peimanent works may be erected at comparatively
small cost, suflicient to di fy the action of the clemerts for
ages, but I big leav° to uige again that the commencement
should not be delayed for a moment "
Other engineers take the same view of this
matter, and press; upon us the importance of ren-
dering these works permanent, and completing
them in a style which will insuie their durability,
and relieve them of the constant expenses which
are now necessarily mcuned in making repairs
to pievent then entire demolition Mr. Biown
says, speaking of Dunkuk haibor,
" That the timber woik above vi ater decays rapidlj, and
this cau«e has atreadv been productive ot great ttpense and
injury In the last three yi ars the sum ot $8 000 Ins been
laid out in repairs, which would have been unnecessary if
the material used above water had been stone r^ottiing
can show more ioic blj than tins fact the propnety of pro
ceedmg without delay to place on a p raiment looting
these Government works, winch experience has shown to i
be productive of such laamen&e benefits*3'                          I
No. 22
These works were originally but experiments.
And it was a matter of gieat doubt whether they
would succeed Their success is now fully tested;
they are built of cubs formed of timbers, which
are sunk in the lake and filled with stone; they
ad here firmly to the bottom, and there is nodano-er
of their being displaced or removed by the action
of the water, unless it makes a bleach over them
The timber partabove water is rapidly decaying,
and in some instances is now in a dilapidated
condition. It will leadily be perceived that if they
are suffered to remain in their present exposed
condition, there is imminent danger of the upper
part being washed away; and whenever this is
the case, it will be the work of but a few hours,
in a violent storm, to plow up and sweep away
the whole structure, thus destroying your harbor,
and wasting, by your ill-advised and unwise par-
simony, all which you had previously expended.
The plan now is to remove all the wood-work
which is exposed to the action of the wind and
water, or, in othei wo ds, to decay, and eiect
upon the present foundation, which is the best m
the world, a permanent superstiucture of stone
and masonry. It is believed that these works will
then be safe and permanent, and that but very
little, if anything, will thereafter be required to
keep them in repair If you enter upon this woik
at once, without delay, the expense will not be
great; the foundation, the most expensive part,
is there—is completed. But if you delay you
may lose this foundation entire'y Is it the pan
of wisdom, then, to piocrastinate, to stop here9
I think not, sir I think with the engineers, that
it is all important that not a moment be lost
Sir, true economy demands that the works be
prosecuted without intet mission Your engineers
and superintendents are now on the spot, with all
the infoimation they have acquired from past ex-
perience You have now the tools and imple-
ments necessary, you have dredging machines;
you have men, laborers who have acquired expe-
rience in this business Is it wise to dischatge
them5 But it is said that one half of the amount
appropriated last year is to be expended this
There aie nine harbors out of the twenty-five on
the lakes, for which appiopnations were made,
where the appiopnation was, in each case below
twelve thousand. And, in these cases, nothing
was reserved for the present year, and some of
them are now much exposed, and require imme-
diate appropriations
Mr LEGARE was understood to admit the
importance of these woiks, but asked why the
States did not make them -
Mr. MARVIN I will endeavorto answer the
question of the honorable gentleman Sir, I have
maintained all along that this Government should
construct those works which are national in their
character, which aie of general interest, in which
the commerce of States participated I do not
advocate the construction of woiks by this Gov-
ernment t  a State, such as roads, canals, and rail-
ways, which are peculiarly State woiks, and upon
which the State may charge tolls I would not
to-day vote an appropriation of a million dolíais
to aid my own State in the enlaigement of its Erie
canal, oi for the construction of a turnpike or i ail-
way These are works which can be much bettet
performed by State authonty. They may be
used for national purposes, and may partake, in
many instances, of a national chaiacter, but the
State can and should make them, and control their
use, and charge a reasonable toll upon them for
its own indemnification Buthow isitin i elation |
to these haibors along youi northern coast-
They aiefoi the piotection of commerce geneially
—the commerce of many States.                     ■*       ,
Why, sir, to illustrate, take the harbor of Dun-1
kn k, m my district, situated fortv five miles from j
Buffalo, steamboats leaving Buffalo daily, bound !
up the lake to Cleveland,Detioit, oi Chicago, mn
into Dunkirk for a supply of fuel, land and re-
ceive passengers, and pmsue their voyage. Ships
going up or coming down the lake, encounter a
storm, and run into Dunkirk as a place of lefup
and to avoid  shipwieok.    Now, does  not  the I
honorable gentleman perceive that Ohio, Mich-i
igai, and all the country beyond Dunkuk, are 1
moie directly interested in tins haiboi than the
State of New Yoik, although  it is situated in
New York ¡>   Which State, then, shall construct 1
it, and keep it m repair' Is this a local woik  
No, sir; Massachusetts and all the eastein States
are directly interested in it Indeed, sir, so far
as westei n New York is concerned, I might say,
if I could be actuated by so narrow and illiberal
views, that all these harbors on the upper lakes
aie piejudtcial The staple production of that
part of the State is wheat, which finds a maiket
in our eastern cities and the New England States.
Now, sir, break up the commerce of the lake by-
destroying the harbois and preventing Ohio from
coming into competition with our farmers, and
they will enjoy a monopoly to a great extent.
But I iepudic-te the argument, I go for the great
good of the whole, for facilities which will ena-
ble us to trade with all paits of the country,and
thus equalize the value of labor and the produc-
tions of the countiy And we maintain that
those harbors along the lake coast are a3 much,
national as those along the Atlantic coast, and
that this Government is as much bound to con-
struct them as it is to improve the harboi at
Charleston, or to erect and keep up the numerous
light-houses on the sea-coast. The gi eat differ-
ence is, that where one dollar is requned for the
protection of our trade on the lakes, hundreds
are lequired and expended for the same purpose
on the high seas.
Let this Government perform its duty and ita
part in these great enterprises, and the States of
the North and Northwest, at any rate, will per-
foim theirs.    Why, sn, they are now gieatly in
advance     There aie now over two thousand five
hundred miles of canals and railways already con-
structed, or in the piocess of construction,by the
States bordering on the upper lakes, wliose com-
mon cento is Lake Erie     Illinois is tapping, by
a gigantic woik, Lake Michigan, thus connect-
ing that lake with the Mississippi     Indiana is
engaged in some of the most noble enterprises of
the day, and the extent of her canals and rail-
ways will soon enable htr to take hei place by the
side of those States, which led the way in internal
improvements.    Ohio has connected her noble
river with the lake, and she is still pressing for-
ward  with othei important works calculated to
develop her great resouices     Michigan, though
a State of but yesterday, has boldly put forth her
strength, and is connecting by several lines one
great lake with another   Eligibly situated, nearly
surrounded by the lakes, possessing many valu-
able harbors, she is connecting the interior with
them     I need not mention generally the works
of Pennsylvania, but I will call the attention of
gentlemen to one which has been recently under-
taken, and its importance to the United Slates for
military purposes will readily be perceived     I
allude to the Sunbury and Ene railway, which
will open a direct communication between Phil-
adt Iphia and Erie, upper Lake Ene, and brin 
Pniladelplna within about four hundred miles of
the lake     Sir, suppose, during the last wer, that
Erie haibor had been improved as it now is, and
this communication by lailway between Phila-
¡ dclphiaand Erie had been completed, how many
million dolíais could have been saved tothisGov-
I eminent in carrying on the operations of the war'
I    As to my own State, it will not be denied that
í she has perfoimed, and is performing, hei duty to
herself, to the States west of her, and to the Uni-
ted States    She asks no aid from this Govern-
I ment, or any other, m  constructing her great
I woiks and completing her splendid and magnifi-
cent system of internal improvement     Sne has
decided, and is now prosecuting vigorously the
I enlargement of her Erie canal, at a cost which
< will piobably exceed fifteen million dollars   This
! is done for the accommodation of the tiade of the
¡ great West bordering on the upper lakes
I    Mr LEGARE inquired as to the tolls collected
I on the canal
I Mr. MARVIN It is true, sir, that the Staie
expects that the íevenue to be deiived from the
canal will, in time, reimburse the State, but, at
the same time, the enlaigement is for the benefit
of the West. Asyou inciease thevolume ofwater
in the canal, you will lessen the cost of transpor-
tation While upon this subject of the State im-
provements, I will lead an extract from Mr.
Smith's rcpoi t, to which I have alieady called the
attention of the House, showing the important
and intimate connection between the United State
