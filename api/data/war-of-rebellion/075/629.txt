WM. L. PORTER,

Lieutenant and Acting Assistant Adjutant- General.

WASHINGTON, June 28, 1864-3.30 p. m.

Major- General Sherman,

Georgia:

Lieutenant- General Grant directs me to say that the movements of your army may be made entirely independent of any desire to retain Johnston's forces where they are. He does not think that Lee will bring any additional troops to Richmond, on account of the difficulty of feeding them.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major- General and Chief of Staff.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, near Kenesaw, June 28, 1864.

General WEBSTER,

Nashville:

In our assaults made yesterday, General Harker, a very gallant young brigadier, was mortally wounded, and died last night. Tell Mrs. Brown. Colonel Dan. McCook is dangerously wounded. We have constant fighting along lines for ten miles, and either party that attacks gets the worst of it. I will persevere, and think I can find a soft place. At all events, we can stand it as long as they. Johnston will not come out of is parapets, and it is difficult to turn his position without abandoning our railroad.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major- General, Commanding.
