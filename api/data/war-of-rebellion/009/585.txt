HEADQUARTERS COLUMN FROM CALIFORNIA,Albuquerque, N. Mex., September 14, 1862.

Colonel JOSEPH R. WEST, Commanding Dist. Of Arizona, Mesilla, Ariz.:

COLONEL: It is presumed, from advices lately received from Major David Ferguson, First California Volunteer Cavalry, commanding District of Western Arizona, that about 1,000 head of cattle will shortly be at Tucson en route to the Rio Grande for the use of the Column from California. The general commanding directs that you give to the commanding officer at Tucson such detailed instructions as will insure the arrival in this valley of these cattle at an early day. After deducting a sufficient number for the use of the troops in the District of Western Arizona, the cattle should be sent forward in small herds, so that too many may not arrive at the watering places at any one time-say, one portion with Greene's company and another with Wellman's cavalry and so on.

The general commanding directs that you arrest one Manuel Barella, a brother of Anastacio Barella, of Mesilla, and send him up the country as far as Fort Craig.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

BEN. C. CUTLER,

First Lieutenant, First Cal. Vol. Infantry, A. A. A. G.
