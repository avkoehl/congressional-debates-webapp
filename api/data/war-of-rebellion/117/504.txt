engaged in it because many complaints were made in consequence of the restrictions placed on visitors to the camp. On the 2nd of May I directed that under no circumstances should prisoners be permitted to receive money; what was sent to them by their friends must be deposited with the commanding officer who was to disburse if for them. It is scarcely and excuse for Doctor Boone that he did not know of these orders, for it was his business before he undertook to relieve the wants of prisoners to learn what the regulations of the camp were. But from what he states and from what may be inferred from the report of Colonel Tucker it is probable that the restrictions which I had placed on the receipt of money by prisoners were as carelessly enforced or as willfully neglected by Colonel Mulligan as the prohibition of visitors to the camp, and so far Doctor Boone may be haled excusable. If the commanding officer of the camp was indifferent to the violation of its regulations there was little obligation on irresponsible persons to observe them.

This excuse, however, does not cover the $30 which was sent to the prisoner Green. Colonel Tucker was then in command and the regulations were strictly enforced, and the money could not have reached him if the rules of intercourse by letter had not been violated. Though the money was sent by Doctor Boone's agent he was responsible for the act, for according to his own statement his agent only carried out his instructions. There seems to be no reason to doubt Doctor Boone's loyalty; on the contrary he has displayed much zeal for the Union cause personally and by sending his son to the army, but in this act he committed a grave offense, most probably no designedly but through want of reflection on the consequences.

Under all the circumstances, especially considering the countenance given to his conduct by the course of Colonel Mulligan, and believing that Doctor Boone did no intentional wrong I should respectfully suggested that he be released.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

OFFICE COMMISSARY-GENERAL OF PRISONERS,

Detroit, Mich., September 10, 1862.

General L. THOMAS,

Adjutant-General U. S. Army, Washington, D. C.

GENERAL: At it is proposed to occupy the two small prisons at Camp Chase for temporary purposes and there will be always more or less prisoners there I respectfully suggest that two companies be specially detailed or organized under a major for the guard service independent of the others of the camp. The frequent changes in the commander of the camp leads to many irregularities and a proper responsibility can only be arrived at through a permanent commander and permanent guard. The prison at Alton must also be occupied for temporary purposes, and in place of the regiment now there (Seventy-seventh Ohio) I advise that three companies under an efficient major be detailed as the guard. The guards at Camp Bulter, Camp Douglas and Camp Morton will be immediately mustered out of service.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. HOFFMAN,

Colonel Third Infantry, Commissary-General of Prisoners.
