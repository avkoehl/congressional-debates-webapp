HDQRS. FORTY-EIGHTH REGIMENT VIRGINIA VOLS.,Camp near Port Republic, Va., June 15, 1862.

CAPTAIN: I have the honor to transmit to you, for the information of Colonel Patton, commanding the Second Brigade, a report of the operations of the Forty-eighth Regiment Virginia Volunteers during the recent engagement of the 8th near Port Republic:

At about 8 o'clock on Sunday morning we were marched to the hills overlooking Port Republic, and took up a line of battle, in which we remained during a heavy cannonade of some two or three hours. Orders were then received to march to the rear in the direction of the firing. The Forty-eighth Regiment, followed by the other portion of this brigade, moved rapidly to the scene of action. Colonel patton then detached the Forty-eighth Regiment and ordered me to move forward to the left of the road to support a battery, strongly threatened with being charged by the enemy. Here General Ewell placed the regiment in position, ordering to the front as skirmishers all the men with longrange guns. We remained at this place until about 8 o'clock at night, when we were ordered back to camp.

Casualties during the day were 3 men killed and 1 officer and 8 men wounded.*

Very respectfully,

THOS. S. GARNETT,

Lieutenant Colonel, Commanding Forty-eighth Regiment Virginia Vols.

Assistant Adjutant-General, Second Brigade.
