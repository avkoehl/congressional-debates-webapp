long to the creditors of the Government, and are,
of course, entirely useless for a supply to the Tiea-
sury Unless the operations of Government to-
tally stop, it must be obnous that there aw a} s
will be some few millions of dollars m the hands
of the disbursing officers of arm}, nav), Indian
department and other objects of expenditure,
awaiting the call ot creditors of th<  Government
He also thinks that it would be procer to sed the
bonds of the United States Bank oí Pennsylvania,
which are held by the Treasjry Dtpaitment It
adpears to me that tnere aie to this proposition se-
veral objection^ I am not ceitam that it vv onld be
exactly propei to put thos bunds m o maikít It
might, by possibility, have an injurious beating
upon the institution If so, it oug it not to be done,
as an act of justice It i  not like an ordinary
mercantile transaction. The directors of the bank
undoubtedly had some object in view, m fixing an-
nual payments, and I hope tne Government will
never give a cause of comp'aint to this institut on,
of the slightest character Where w ill these bonds
be sold1 My own opinion is, that the bank would
purchase its own bonds It appears to me it woul 1
be unwilling to multiply and vaiy i*s obligations in
the stock market It has already post notes on tne
London Exchange, and it appeals to me, it wo aid f
be unwilling to have thest bonds there If, then, '
these bonds shou'd now go into th  maiket, and
the bank should thmk propei to puichase them,
the debtors of the bank must necessarily be cabed
upon, and thus distress the commercial and ttad-
ing community to that amount If sold m Europe,
London most probably, it would, to the amount
of six millions of dollars, afford facilities lor again
over-tiading, instead of being emp oved to relieve
our own countrv I do not behave that at this
time there is a very laige unpaid amount of good
debts from American to Lng'r-h meichants The
fall m exchange and specie shows that it is very
much diminished, and it appears to me, we ought
to avoid any course which would tempt to ex-
cesses in our foreign importations in the slightest
degree But the objection of substituting the sale
of these bonds fof the Treasury notes is still greater
in another v lew It i- an object to make this issue
of Treasury notes incidentals beneficial to the
community, by furmshng a means of leimttance
and one ol a verv valuable character The Trea-
sury notes would flow fiom the disbur ing paints
to the commun ties wh i ma} wanf the i lor remit
tances The West and Sou h wt id icccne lh m
in payment of debts, or for the sale of ihtn cotton
and other great pioduct , as well as for lands held
by individuals and companies They would find
their way back to the Atlantic ci* cs, foitmng a
highly valuable circulating me hum perhaps until
he time arrives, which cannot be veiy tar distant,
of a resumption b} the local banks of specie pa\
ments
It has been aigued, thai it would be preferable
to authorize a loan m the fonrt of ce tif.eates of
stock This appears to be liable to exceeding1/
strong objections as any which would uppl} lo the
sale of the bonds of th° Umfeu States Bank So
far as it relates to the incidental beneit to tne
conimerrnl community, it would be a si i°-g sh
opera tun The st iek would be all taken in
the large cities, and the proceeds pass d reotry to
the Treasur}, where it would remun until
called foi by die Government cieUtors, and per
form none of the offices of a means of iem ttince

Mv coHeagoc objects to the bill   because no late
of interest is specified, and he cannot give it lis
vote unal he knons precisely what the oLhgptions
of the Government are to be It appears to me,
that this is one of the most valuable piovisions of
the bill, because the rate of interest can be so fixed
all the wa} from a verv low rate to the maximum of
six percent and that the Secietirv of the Treasur}
will put it at the most advantageous rate for the
Government and foi the community And, it ap-
pears to me, the rule would be a verv plain one,
to place the late so that they vould not be hoard-
ed by the capitalist, oi fall bckw par in 'he , iai-
Uet, hovvevei «mall ihe demand lor Government
dues And although as has oeen strongly uiged,
there is veiy «mah probabi'itv that, undei a'most
any circumstances, the} vv ould lie bi low par, v et
it i better, in ni} judgment, to leave the vvbolc
mater to the dscrcmn of t^c Seen tar} of the
Tieasurj, who will undeis and best what the wants
ol the case ma}  lequue
It is objec ed, that the issue o<" Treasui} notes is
unconstitutional, thit they are bill) of credit, <uid
proh bited by the Constitution of the United Stales,
that they weie never issued in but one instance,
and that during the war with Great Britain, when
it was difficult or almost impossible to obtain a
loan If it vv ere unconstitutional to issue Treasury
notes, the fact that vve were at wai,and it was
difficult to obtain a loan m arj other n annei,
would not have made it constitutional I come
to the conclusion m} self, that Treasury notes w ere
issued, at that time foi the same leason as now,
because they are the most convenient to the Go-
vernment and to tne people
I have not entertained the opinion, Mr Speaker,
that the present embairassmcnts o this nation
have arisen irom what may be ptopei¡v called
geneial disiicss I believe, and think I shall be
sustained in the opmicn b, the s n nvnts of many
men of business m the commercial cities, that ihe
stoppage of specie pa} ments wasowmgto theaiarm
excited m the community, which caused a rush
upon the banks for the precious metals, and thereby
materially lessened then means, and by the impru-
dence and extended speculation into which the
debtois of these institutions plunged Had it not
been for these circumstances, the suspension w ould
not have taken pl°ce and but foi them before
this tine, specie payments would have been re-
sumed It is true that the const malum wis uni-
versal — th  p uiiC was o cw'ie'mi >a, bu' that the
evil was not detp looted, and ttiat theie was ¡.ot m
realitv a scared} of the piecious me'al  in Ihe com-
mercial woild, is shown by "various facts Cot-
trary to the expectation of m st peisons in this
countr}, the Bat k of Englanl continued, and still
continues, specie payments, and mono} is abun
dant, and there is no want of com and bu'hon for all

Th° ordinary means of tne banks «ere probabl}
equal to their liabilities, out the nabihty o' the i

My colleague objects that the bil'is deceptive,
that undei the guise of authonztng an issue of
Treasuiy no'es, it effects a loan It undoubtedly
is an u e of the eredit of the country, to oblam
means of extinguishing sjtre of its h'abiht es, and
in that sense is a loan But there i no decep'ion
about it Notes payable arc never issued in money
transactions, excepting for the puipose ot substitu-
ting credit for monev, or promising it, and therefore
alnavs directl) or indirectly operate asa negotia-
tion for a li an What difference does it make as
to the matter of bot rowing, vvhfther ihe money be ob-
tained bv one person ol a third, and paid t > a seco id
cne, or th< ncte be given direct!} to the seconuper-
son' In boih cases, it i-, obtaining meansson loan,
in ene instance directlv, in the other indirectly.
Banks bonow contmualty, by their bills or notes,
monev of the community I'fow, sir, as Treasury
notes can be issued foi no other parjiose than to
pioi ure money or means on the cred t of the United
Slates, the bill cannot be deceptive, because, as it
can have no other object ev ery body understands
it
I am n iavor of the bill as it now stands, with'
tut anv oi ths proposed amendments, particularly
those wheh pre pise tne -die of the bonds oí the
Un ted States Bank of Peimsylvama, and to the
stiikmg out the provision, authorizing the Secreta-
ry to pay interest, when, in h s opinion, the good
ot the counirv ma} require it It certainly ap-
p ars to me, that th re ran be no possible objec-
ión to that provision It will guard against the
possibility, although I admit it is not a ktrong pro-
bability, that thty will be at any considerable dis-
count, undet ordinary circumstances But we a'l
know the nice calculations of dealeis in monej,
and I should be exceedmgl} «orr} to hear the ciy
whi-'i bos °o fi nuently sounded in our ears of
depreciated cmrnc), applied to any of tne issues
of the Government
I have confined myself strictly to the considera-
tion ei the bill now betore the House, which ap-
pears to me to be so absolutely necessary, that it
is almost a matter of surprise that so much time
should hav e been emDloyed in discussing it It is
called for by the Go\ eminent, to enable them to
comply with the requisitions of die public, and it
i  required bv ihe people, as being the bekt mode
by which thei1- interests can be subs  ved

granting additional ciedit, as well a gumgaere-
ilit on cash dunes, it is universally concedíd will
pa^s, and I trust with few dissenting voices Por
one, I feel strongly disposed to aflord every facility
and pi actice every forbearance, which the most
liberal legislation will warrant, and it would s em
lhat the administration, whose friends are so gene-
rally in favor of this forbearing course, and who
are so wi'lmg to grant every indulgence to those
