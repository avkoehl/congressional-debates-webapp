I have moved my whole command out on the road toward Lexington to cross-roads, on which I will observe both flanks by scouts. Rebels left Lexington at 6 o'clock.

Major General S. P. HEINTZELMAN,

Spencer House:

The following dispatch has just been received from General Carrington at Indianapolis:

INDIANAPOLIS, June 10, 1864.

Captain C. H. POTTER,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

Just returned from Louisville; find here a telegram that Morgan passed through Lexington westward. There are only 260 men at Munfordville. General Ewing informs me the Governor will move the Legion at once. I shall go right back to-night. No provision is made for defense at Louisville; not a gun there. Governor Morton will furnish artillery. Do you approve my spending Sunday at Louisville, where telegrams will reach me to assist in any movements in that direction? Everything there is unorganized. General Ewing's headquarters are at Munfordville. Shall I dispose of the Indiana militia? It seems best reporting regularly by telegraph.

H. B. CARRINGTON,

Brigadier-General.

C. H. POTTER,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HDQRS. CAVALRY DIVISION, SIXTEENTH ARMY CORPS,Brice's House, Ten Miles south of Stubbs', June 10, 1864--10 a. m.

Captain W. C. RAWOLLE,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General:

CAPTAIN: I have arrived at the intersection of the Baldwyn, Saltillo, and Pontotoc roads. It is six miles to Baldwyn, twelve miles to Saltillo, twenty-eight miles to Pontotoc, twenty miles to Tupelo, and six miles to Guntown. The road to Saltillo is said to be good. The road to Baldwyn is bad; has a bad creek on it. Forrest passed here on Tuesday, with his whole force, from Tupelo to Baldwyn. The command which we fought on Tuesday passed here yesterday on the railroad to Baldwyn. Just before reaching this point we struck a picket which attempted to destroy a bridge, but did not succeeded. I have halted and will await further orders. Chalmers' DIVISION is reported transferred to Georgia, and Roddey to Forrest. It is reported that they moved on Wednesday last from Baldwyn to Booneville, and that Roddey and Forrest were to form a junction. Courier from the advance on the Baldwyn road, just in, reports skirmishing.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

B. H. GRIERSON,

Brigadier-General.
