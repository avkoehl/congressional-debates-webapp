BROADWAY LANDING, VA., March 31, 1865.

CHIEF OPERATOR, HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE JAMES:

My telegraph office was established by special order of Lieutenant-General Grant after two serious interruptions of important business which resulted from your order before breaking it up. A special order for an operator was sent to Fort Monroe. He does not belong to the Army of the James any more than to the Army of the Potomac, and you will take no steps without at least showing this telegram to General Ord and getting his orders.

HENRY L. ABBOT,

Brevet Brigadier-General of Volunteers, Commanding Siege Artillery.

BROADWAY LANDING, VA., March 31, 1865.

Major-General PARKE,

Commanding Ninth Corps:

I have just received a rebel battle-flag belonging to the Twenty-sixth North Carolina Regiment, which was captured in Battery 12 on 25th instant by Private George E. McDonald, Company L, First Connecticut Artillery. This company followed up the assaulting column so rapidly to their battery as to capture several rebels, among the rest a commissioned officer, before they could escape. This flag was secured by Private McDonald, and I would request that his name be put down for a medal of honor. I will forward the flag to your headquarters.

HENRY L. ABBOT,

Brevet Brigadier-General of Volunteers, Commanding Siege Artillery.
HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS,March 31, 1863.

General HENRY L. ABBOT,

Broadway Landing:

I am delighted to receive your dispatch, and Private McDonald's name will be forwarded with the others for medals of honor. This flag puts us on a new track. I find from my register that the Twenty-sixth North Carolina is in MacRae's brigade, Heth's division. This is the first evidence I have had that any of A. P. Hill's troops were here. Do you know what became of the prisoners or to what regiment the commissioned officer belongs?

JNO. G. PARKE,

Major-General.

BROADWAY LANDING, VA., March 31, 1865.

Major-General PARKE,

Commanding Ninth Corps:

The prisoners were sent to the rear with the rest. I will make inquiries as to the regiment of the officer. The flag bears no mark of any regiment, being the usual square battle-flag with blue cross on red ground. McDonald gave me the name of the regiment to which it belonged as he got it from the prisoners.

HENRY L. ABBOT,

Bvt. Brigadier General of Vols., Commanding Siege Artillery.
