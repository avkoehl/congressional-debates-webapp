constantly filling up." The Conscript Department has labored under great difficulties, of which not the least was a want of military support. My orders to you directing the detail of troops for that service were not complied with. The failure to do so, though justified by military operations in your district, prevented the enforcement of the conscript act. A battalion of cavalry taken from the Northern Sub-District of Louisiana by my orders and placed under commandant of conscripts sent over 2,000 men to the army. The law is being administered faithfully, and the Conscript Department is unceasing in vigor and efficiency. Its commandant reports that he will this month add from the District of Texas alone near 3,000 to infantry regiments. The principal and almost the only new organization received into service by authority from department headquarters is Bush's regiment. It was given against my judgment, and only after it had been repeatedly urged from your headquarters. On consulting the department books I find that authority was given Major Battle to increase his battalion to a regiment from within the enemy's lines. Authority was also given five persons to raise companies from non-conscripts or within the enemy's lines. One only (Mr. Sewell) was allowed to receive conscripts from the Calcasieu district through its enrolling officer. I inclose you copies* of these authorities.

Third. "The troops are without shoes, &amp;c.; the Clothing Bureau is liberal in promise and utterly barren in performance, &c.; a radical change is imperatively demanded." Allowances should be made for the Clothing Bureau. It has worked under difficulties and disadvantages; crippled in its resources and cut off from its supplies by the loss of the Rio Grande and the action of the Governor of Texas and its State Legislature. The troops have generally been well supplied with clothing. I inclose you memorandum* of shoes, &c., lately sent to your command.

Fourth. "There are no horses for the artillery, &c. They will never be supplied under the present system." The character of the late campaign, its severity and the absence of forage has made the mortality of horses very great, both in Arkansas and Louisiana. The inspector of field transportation is using every exertion to supply deficiencies. He reports that several hundred have been sent to the army, and that the arrangements recently made by him will meet all its wants.

Fifth. "No campaign dependent on the present system of bureau-ocracy will succeed. The rage for what is termed 'organization' has proceeded so far that we are like a disproportionate garment-all ruffles and no shirt. The number of bureaus now existing in this department and the army of employed attached to them would do honor to St. Petersburg or Paris. Instead of making the general staff a mere adjunct to promote the efficiency of the little army in the field the very reverse is the case." The bureaus made by me at department headquarters were organized by the advice and instructions of the Secretary of War. They are but few in number and have but few employed. They are a commissary, quartermaster, ordnance, medical and conscript bureau. I inclose you a list+ of their employed, who are, with few exceptions, above conscript age, or with certificate of disability. The late conscript act is rigorously en-
