HEADQUARTERS RIGHT WING, December 24, 1862-12.50 p.m.

General ROSECRANS:

The continuation of the Edmondson pike intercepts the old Liberty road at Prim's blacksmith shot, from which there is a road direct to Nolensville. The old Liberty road goes to Concord church, and not to Nolensville. There will be no trouble in my column crossing Mill Creek, provided a column shows itself on the Edmondson road.

A. McD. McCOOK,Major-General, Commanding.

DECEMBER 24, 1862.

General ROSECRANS:

Triune is 7 miles beyond Nolensville and 3 miles this side of Patten's Hill, or Bole Jack's Hill-a strong position and good water. If I do not have to fight, I can reach Triune by dark, but would prefer getting there by day, if possible.

Colonel GARESCHE:

Portion of my command at Brentwood; scouts 1 mile to the front. Enemy reported falling back. Their force was estimated at 2,000; I think it was only a surprise party. They had about 300 in ambush on the right of Franklin pike. There is no indication of an attack on this point.

Would it not be advantageous to have some cavalry with me in the morning? If you think not, I would respectfully ask a company for couriers and messengers. I start promptly at 7 a.m.
