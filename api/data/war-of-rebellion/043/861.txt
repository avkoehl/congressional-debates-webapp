I ordered an advance of a portion of our regiment, who eagerly leaped the works and surrounded about 50 of the enemy, among whom were 2 officers, and took at the time two flags, one brigade color and the other a regimental banner. At the receipt of these flags, a quiet enthusiasm pervaded the men and officers of the regiment. After the opening of the infantry fire, an order was received from General Greene that I must hold the works under all circumstances. I sent frequently for ammunition, which was promptly furnished, the right being out of ammunition but one time, when, by my order, bayonets, were fixed, and thus remained until their boxes were replenished. All the commands were received by the men coolly, and instantly obeyed, more especially the orders "commence firing" and "cease firing. " During this time 9 men were killed and 16 wounded. There was occasional firing by our regimental line until the break of day, July 3, when, with the exception of a reply to rebel sharpshooters, the firing ceased. We could then see large numbers of the enemy's dead within less than 50 feet of our line. My men numbered 255 and 16 line officers, 1 adjutant, 1 field officer (Lieutenant-Colonel Redington on July 2 being brigade officer of the day, but after the picket and skirmishers came in did not report to me during the engagement, only being at the rear of the regiment late in the morning of the 3d). The light firing above mentioned continued until a repeated advance of the enemy's infantry at about 4 a. m. July 3, when heavy firing opened on both sides, and continued until 9. 30 a. m., the enemy being steadily held in check, at which time they retired, leaving only sharpshooters, who kept up interval firing until about 2 p. m., when my men being much exhausted, the Sixtieth were relieved for one hour, retiring from and returning to the intrenchments under a sharp fire of sharpshooters. During the morning we sustained a loss of 2 men killed and 19 wounded, in addition to 2 lieutenants, one slightly, the other severely, wounded. Our men resumed their places behind the works about one hour after being first relieved, and then remained until 2 a. m. July 4, meanwhile there being no firing. Too much praise cannot be awarded the regiment for its coolness and perfect obedience to orders. Officers and men are alike entitled to a proud reputation for efficient service in defending the hill on which they were situated, it being a most commanding position on the left of the Twelfth Corps. The Colors above named captured by the regiment have been forwarded to brigade headquarters, thence to be sent to the proper department. The proper record of capture is inscribed upon them. A full and complete list of killed, wounded, and missing has already been forwarded to brigade headquarters. *

This supplementary report is most respectfully submitted.

Colonel, Commanding Sixtieth New York Volunteers.
