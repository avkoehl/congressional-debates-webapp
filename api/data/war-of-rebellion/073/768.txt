Since reaching Cartersville the division has been much scattered; parts of some regiments have been mustered out, many men are dismounted, and those who have succeeded in obtaining horses have already seriously impaired their usefulness in a long pursuit after Wheeler. Its line extends from Cartersville, Ga., to Franklin, Tenn. The constant calls upon it for scouting parties preclude the idea of the recruiting its old horses, and the frequent forced gaps in its communication prevent anything like unity of action. It is my earnest hope that the interests of the service will soon permit the consolidation of, and thus restore its usefulness to, my command.

I am, captain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

E. M. McCOOK,

Brigadier-General, Commanding Division.

Report of Colonel Joseph B. Dorr, Eighth Iowa Cavalry, commanding First Brigade, of operations July 18.
HDQRS. FIRST BRIGADE, FIRST CAVALRY DIVISION, DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,In the Field, July 18, 1864.

The scouting party ordered to Turner's Ferry has just returned. I found a strong picket-line on opposite side of the Chattahoochee, evidently cavalry, which seem to have recently taken their present position. The earth-work about one mile and a half from Fort McCook is constructed for six guns. No guns visible. No boat of any
