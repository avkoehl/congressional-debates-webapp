Honorable E. M. STANTON:

Stimulated by bounties, by the efforts and zeal of local committees, by fear of a draft, and the apprehension of unfavorable intelligence at any moment, the reserve power of the State is fairly in motion. Reports from different sections last evening show that not less than 30,000 volunteers have been enrolled in new organizations in the last three weeks, independently of recruits for old regiments. An equal number can be enlisted in the next three weeks, and the whole force required from this State by both orders can be speedily raised by voluntary enlistment; but to do this the ardor must not be checked for one moment. I must accept companies and maximum regiments as circumstances shall determine. Is this satisfactory? The order for perfecting enrollment, under General Orders, Numbers 99, will be issued to-day.

Governor of New York.

(Received 5 p. m.)

General C. P. BUCKINGHAM:

I hope to have all the enrollment in by the 20th instant. I assume it will take ten days for the commissioner to purge the lists, and
