THE CONGRESSIONAL * GLOBE.
May 28,
Mr, HOLM AN. Then why strike out heirs?
Of course the money must go to the executor
or administrator of the estate.
Mr. FARNSWORTH. Isthis a Senate bill?
Mr. BUNNELL. No; it is a House bill.
Mr. FARNSWORTH, Then we had better
let it go over until next session.
Mr. BUNNELL. It is a unanimous report
of the Committee on the Public Lands. This
gentleman, Mr. Ely Moore, was once a mem-
ber of Congress. He.was appointed to this
^ office under the administration of Mr. Presi-
dent Pierce. I. ask for the reading of the
report.
The Clerk read the report as follows:
The Committee on the Public Lands, to whom was
referred the bill (H. R. No, 1298) for the relief of the
heirs of Ely Moore, respectfully report:
That they have had the same under consideration
and find that Ely Moore held the office of register
of the Lecompton land office,-in Kansas, Irorn the
2(jth day of November, A. D. 1855, to the 27th day of
January, A. D. 1860, the time of his death; that
from the early part of the year 1857 to the time of
Mr. Moore's death the duties of his office were ex-
ceedingly onerous by reason of the large number of
contested preemption cases, the great number of
applicants to enter lands with the bounty-laud
warrants issued under the act of March 3, 1855, and
preparing for and attending the public land sales
made m that district.
To discharge these duties promptly and in such
manner as to satisfy the people doing business there
it i-ecitme absolutely necessary for Mr. Moore to
employ the clerical assistance which he did employ
and pay from his own money, which his heirs
now as>k to have refunded to them. In reference to
this point Hon. S. C. Pomeroy, one of the Sen-
ators from Kansas, says aa follows:
To the Committee on the Public Lands,
House of liepresentative* !
My attention having been called to the case of
the heirs of the late Eiy Moore, register of the land
oflieeat Lecompton, Kansas, I beg leave respect-
fully to submit the following:
I am personally knowing to the fact that, owing
to the troubles occurring at the early settlement ot
Kansas between the free-State and pro-slavery par-
ties, the contests over preemption claims were more
numerous in that district than all other districts
combined since that period. I have been at the
office repeatedly and found scores of settlers wait-
ing and camping out in wagons lor their turn to
coine, and I urged Mr. Moore to employ extra clerks
and thus accommodate the largo numbers of settlers
who were waiting ; and I know he did employ extra
clerks, and that they were necessary to subserve the
public good. Mr. Moore died, leaving no assets,
save what the Government may deem justly due
upon this case, as it'is now presented. The family
aie now very poor, and I hope that a favorable
report may be made, as I believe the claim to be a
just one.
liespectfully, S. C. POMEROY.
XJ. S. Sexatr Chamber, March 27,1872.
The General Land Office recognized this condition
and the necessity for extra clerical force at this time,
and the Commissioner sent the following letter to
the Secretary of the Interior, im March 17, 1853,
namely:
General Land Office, March 17,1858.
Bin: I have the honor to submit the inclosed
letter of this date, from General Whitfield, register
at ivickapoo, from which it will be perceived that a
pressing exigency now exists for the employment of
clerks in the register's and receiver's officer, at that
place, in preparing for the anticipnted sales io be
held in thit Territory, and asking an allowance of
$4,000 to pay clerk hire tor mx mouths. In this con-
nection I beg leave to refer to my letter of Novem-
ber 16 last, submitting an estimate on one hereto*
tore presented by the Land Office, with a view to
appropriations by Congress to meet expenses of this
kind.
'ihe extraordinary exigency growing out of this
unusual number of preemptions, and the anticipated
public sales, renders it necessary for Congress to
provide the indispensable means for a prompt dis-
charge ot the public duties.
Xne next six months will be the period of very
great pressure, and being of opinion that the inter-
ests, both public and private, require the appropri-
ation desired, it is respectfully submitted and recom-
mended as of the utmost importance.
A like appropriation is recommended for the Le-
compton office, the state of business at that office
equally requiring it.
With great respect,
THOMAS A. HENDRICKS,
(Commissioner*
Hon. J. Thompson, Secretary of the Interior.
Congress took no action upon this letter, and we
presume for the reason that, in common with the
officers of all brauehes of the service, it entertained
the opinion that the fees received for locating
bounty-land warrants under the law ot March 3,
1855, belonged to the register* and receivers, and
that all expenses should be paid out of the fees thus
received.
Section six of that act reads as follows: " The regis-
ters and receivers of the several land offices shall
be severally authorized to charge and receive for
their services in locating all warrants under the pro-
visions of this act the same compensation or per-
centage to which they are entitled by law for sales
of the public lands for cash, at the rate of $1 25 per
acre; the said compensation to be paid by the
assignees or holders ofsuch warrants."
The United States district court of Iowa, in the
ease of the United States vs. Babbitt, decided that
the registers and receivers were entitled to hold
these fees as part compensation for their services
and the extra expenses of their offices ia locating
these warrants. _
This decision was overruled by the bupreme Court
of tbe United States at the December term. 1861,
and Congress, on the 19th day of February, 1861,
passed a law appropriating $10,533 to reimburse the
register at Kick<ipoo for similar services to those
rendered by Mr. Moore in the Lecompton office, and
paid for by him under the belief that he could so
dispose of and use the fees received by him for locat-
ing bounty-land warrants.
During the time that Mr. Moore held the office
of register at the Lecompton land office the cash
proceeds of the sales of public lands at this office,
including register's and receiver's fees, amounted
to $936,183 36. During the same time there were lo-
cated by bounty-land warrants one million eight
huhdred and ten thousand- eight hundred and
eighty-four acres of public land, the cash value of
which, at $1 25 per acre, is $2,263,605.
The amount of fees collected and paid over to the
General Land Office for locating these warrants
was   $42,997 28
Adding to this the fees collected and paid
over for the cash entries  18,723 66
Makes the aggregate of all fees received
and paid over at this office during the
time Mr. Moore was register, of. $61,720 94
The expenses of th|s office during the same time
were as follows:
Ely Moore, register, salary, fees, and commis-
sions...... ...  • $10,975 30
Receiver's salary, commissions, and fees.... 10,858 23
Expenses of depositing the public moneys, 2,204 77
Contingent expenses  840 77
Aggregate expenses of office $24,879 07
Aggregate amount of fees above salaries and ex-
penses of office during Mr. Moore'sterm...$36,841 87
One half of said last amount pertained to the office
of register, namely  $18,420 93
To discharge the duties of this office promptly and
to the satisfaction of the public, Mr. Moore em-
ployed clerks for the time, and paid them compen-
sation as follows:

For all which satisfactory vouchers are furnished
to the coujiuiUee, and which amount your commit-
tee find was necessarily expended by Mr. Moore in
the discharge of the duties of his office, and under
the belief at the time the fees receive4 by hiiu
for locating bounty-land warrants were subject to
his own disposal; and that he afteward accounted
for and paid over the same to the Government; and
that the same should, in justice and equity, be re-
funded to his heirs, who are in indigent circum-
stances; and therefore report back the bill with
the recommendation that it pass.
Mr. FARNSWQRTH, I see nothing in the
report which justifies this claim excepting
what the man makes out himself. Nobody
certifies to the facts, and it is certainly a very
significant fact that the claim is fourteen or
fiiteen years old.
Mr. HEREFORD. I object to debate.
Mr. BUNNELL. Congress last session
passed a bill like this, and the House has
already passed this bill. There are verified
sworn affidavits of all these expenditures of
money.
The question was put on the motion to sus-
pend the rules; and no quorum voted.
Tellers were ordered; and Mr. Dunnell
and Mr. Fatjnsworth were appointed.
The House again divided ; and the tellers
reported—ayes 93, noes 30.
So (two thirds voting in favor thereof) tbe
rules were susppnded, and the bill, with the
amendments, was passed.
POST ROUTE BILL.
Mr. HEREFORD, by unanimous consent,
introduced a bill (H. R. No. 2940) to estab-
lish certain post roads; which was read a first
and second time, ordered to be engrossed and
read a third time; and being engrossed, it was
accordingly read the third time, and passed.
REMOVAL OF POLITICAL DISABILITIES.
Mr. BECK obtained the floor.
Mr. HARRIS, of Virginia. Will the gen-
tleman yield to me for a moment?
Mr. BECK. 1 will yield to the gentleman.
Mr. HARRIS, of Virginia. Imovethatthe
rules be suspended and that the bill which I
send up to remove the legal and political dis-
abilities of the persons therein named be
The bill was read. It provides that all legal
and political disabilities imposed by the fourth
amendment of the Constitution of the United
States by reason of participation in the late
rebellion are removed from Alexander R.
Boteler, of West Virginia, and John Young
Brown, of Henderson, Kentucky.
Mr. IvILLlNGrER. I object.
The SPEAKER. The motion is to suspend
the rules.
Mr. KILLINGER. These two men are
especially excepted in the general amnesty bill.
Mr. HARRIS, of Virginia. By unanimous
consent I would like to say a word. Mr. Bote-
ler was a member of this House 
Mr. KILLINGER. I objeqt to debate.
Mr. HARRIS, of Virginia. I call for tell-
ers oo my motion, and 1 desire to say that my
friend from Pennsylvania served with Mr.
Boteler in the Thirty-Sixth Congress, and
knows that he was a Union man.
Tellers were ordered ,* and Mr. Killingek,
and Mr. Harris of Virginia, were appointed.
The House divided ; and the telleis report-
ed—ayes 89, noes 40.
So (two thirds voting iu favor thereof) the
rules were suspended, and the bill (H. R. No.
2939) was passed.
ORDER OF BUSINESS.
Mr. BECK. I am instructed by the Com-
mittee of Ways and Means to report a bill for
