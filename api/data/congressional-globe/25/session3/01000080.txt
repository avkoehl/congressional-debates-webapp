THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
December 31,
the excuse for ordering thepnnting of this docu
ment?   To enlighten  the public mind'    Then
why not punt woiks in every department of po-
litical economj to enlighten the people? Why not,
instead of giving the public printer this paltryjob
of $20,000, give him a job of half a million at once,
to put him beyond the leach of contingencies'
He knew, fiom personal experience, how apt we
are, when giving the public punter a job, to ím
agine a necessity for doing so    He himself had to
place a cheek of principle on his tendencies in this
matter    If we undeitake to enlighten the public
mind) the true way would be to enlighten the peo-
ple on all   subjects  of fiee tiade      He  knew
how easy uiiab to be economical in the abstract,
to make professions of retienchment of expendí
ture in the genei il, but wh( n it came to peuticu
lets, when it encroached upon some dailmgintei
estofoui own, how easy it was melted   Itwould
give way at once to a two per cent     u would
gi\e way toa question of printing     With the
stiong feeling he had to protect the Govcrnme nt
from exu ivagance, lie felt bound to oppose the
printing, and would vote in favor of lesunding
the oidei
Mr CLAY, of Alabama, said that he really was
notawaie when he spoke that lit, w is e xpiessnig
sentiments eihulatod to excite the Senatoi   iioin
South Caiohna [Mi    Pin ston]   to a dcgice  of
waimth s> unusual, and  to a couise of remaiks
not altogether w in ink d by the lulos of dohbeia
tive bodies     The pciiikman sat out with saying
thathc(Mi   C ) assumed tint the silttixwasa
bad ont    and that, then foil, they must piy Mi
Clan sixtee n oi cighte en thousand doll us   Was it
possible that the lb natoi wished to impute to him
the desue to punt documents merely tor tin pui
pose oí Mvitii; mom y to the printel of that body?
Mr PRFbTON disclaimed any such idei,and
said th it what In meant to convey was, that it
was a 1 igKaldedui tion from the position assumed
by the gcntli man from Alabama
Mi CLAY, of Alabama, said he had assumed
no such position lie took a piactical view of
the subject, and suppoited the punting of the doe
unicntson thegiound that tluir publication would
dissi mínate mlormaüon valuable to the country,
and eminently usi ful to the body as a basis for
1 gislivtivo action We have been assuicd (said
Mi ( ) by tht Senatoi from Missoun that his
intuition is to bung in a bill to abolish the salt
t ix Was it, then, extiaoidinary that he and
otheis wn > concniH d m opinion with him, that
polity as well isjustio ie quned the suppiesston
of tins gnev mee , should desne the publication of
iniounation th itwould be valu ible to themselves
as well as to then (onstitu nts? The gi nth m in
asked, why not publish documents in it latum to
tlu ta\ on co il and sug u I Ik inswei leadily
wis that it w mill be turn enough to do so win n
they should sic the piactical utility of such pub
lication, and that when there was a design on loot
to abolish these taxes, it would be time enough
to publish docuim nts connected with th >se sub

he come to the conclusion that that v ilumin >us
report, nevei lead by one man in a thousand,
could be printed with a view to econ >my, while
it would be extiavagancc to punt this? lie was
willing to hue his views as to economy tested
by his votes here, and he should not fear the jtulg
ment of the countiy, or a comparison with the
Senator fiom South Caiohna When the pioper
time came for testing his principles on this sub-
ject, he would nothesitetetoactashehad always
piofessed that he would, and he trusted that he
should have the eooi oration of the Senator fiom
South Carolina, in aecordance with the pleases
just give  by him
Phf gentleman asked whether the tax of six
cents a bushel had imposed on the people of Ala-
bami the cnoimous exto tion of eightdollars per
bushel foi salt? Su, 1 had reieience to what took
place many yeais ago, when I spoke of as high
a price as eight dolíais a bushel—twenty yeais
and upwards, when the tax was much higher than
now But, put it in the power of individuals to
monopolize the art.cle, and extort from the con-
suméis the price they want, and what is the con-
sequence ? Why, a few years ago, three or four
dollars pel bushel was extorted fiom the people
of the town where he resided He was awaie
that the tax had been reduced, but it was his
object, as it should be that of the people of this
country  to abolish it entnely
Mi C , after some fuithei remarks, said that
the only question with him was whether this m-
foimation was necessary for the legislation of the
Senate and for the inteiests of the people If
such was the fact, he would always gne it to the
public, whether it was contained in this or in any
other document He was not aware of the cost
of the publication, but fiom what had been stated
m the couise ot the debate, it would be very in
consideiablo in compauson with the amount of
the salt tax paid in one of the counties of Ala-
bama
Mi  CALHOUN said he was not present when
the Older to print this document was adopted,
and tht refore (lid not hcai the remaiks of the Sen
atoi  upon the occasion  of mtiodueing it     He
now undeistood the punting was to be followed
by a bill for the repeal of the duty on salt     As
a preliminary, it is neces&aiy to uiquiie, ought
the salt duty to be now lepealed      lie thought
theie was not a Son itor within the sound of his
voice who would say it should be     The Secre
taiy of the Pie asm y has told us theie is a noces
sity fn the most ugid economy, and he told us
tinly  for, with all out  resources, it would  be
difficult woik to get through the ne\t three yeais
if the duty on  salt was  not to be repealed at
picsent, but to come up in the geneial question
in 1842, where was the necessity of printing this
document so fai in advance, when itwould be lost
a id forgotten before the subject came up for con
sideiation ?    The duty on salt was going off giad-
ually, and as rapidly as the duty on other aiti
cles  and evei y person conveisant with the subject
knows that duties should be taken off, as well as
laid on, giadually     1 his was necessary on ac
count of ourmeicantileand manufactuung estab-
lishments     Mr p  legretted that the motion to
lesenid had bet n offered     He would piefei that
some gentleman present when the motion  was
i adopted should move a leconsideiation, and that
I the subjeet might be   iifened to the Committee
' on Tin in    , that they might report on it with ret-
iene   to a geneial system      He was uttetly op
| posed to  Ukmg up such  gieat questions one by
| one—piecemeal     He   thought  they should  be
i taken up and acted on as one entue system     He
I hit th it they wen  all questions of the highest
1 magnitude to the whole Union, but especially to
the southern sc tiouofit     He was averse to any
j couise of policy by which the South would lose
the advantages icce ived by ti e compiomise    Pie
was ol «pinion that some geneial and permanent
1 system should be adoptid, but that the present
was too caily to move m the mattei      He thought
th it  the   Administration, oi  its friends m  that
body at the next session, should take the lead in
this mittei   if they did not, he himself would be
piepaied with a pioposition on the subject, but
he would ehieifully lend his assistance to any
pioposition  which he  should  deem  right,   or
ne ally i ight
fie hope d that the Senator near him [Mr Mor-
ris] would idopt his suggestion, and that some
be natoi who was piesent at the adoption of the
oidei wouldmoveaieeonsideiation that the whole
subject should be sent to the Committee on fi-
nance
Mi DAVIS observed that he shoul 1 vote for
the motion 11 lescind and for a very obvious
leiion lie had no objection to g nflemen hav
ing light, but he was not foi purchasing it at so
d u i idte He understood the rcovei of this
p osmon to state that the printing of these doc-
uments w mid cost eighteen oi twenty thousand
dollirs Phat was a laisre sum of money to ap-
piopuatc to such an obj ct It ought to be \ery
valuable to cost so much money fie was not
present when the Senatoi fiom Missouri brought
forward his pioposition, and, therefore, had not
the s itisfaction of hoaung him the othei day It
was not until the Si natoi fiom South Carolina
addressed the Senate that he knew what was the
immediate object jn view     He understood now
that the Senatoi from Missouri had intimated the
intention of following up the publication of the
documents with a bill to íepial the duty on salt,
and the fishing bounties dependent upon it Isow,
when the Senator from South Caiohna [Mi Cil-
holn] said that this involves consideiations of
piofound inteiest to the country, he was entirely
rio-ht These fishing bounties weie coeval with
the existence of the Government, and were founded
on the soundest principles of national policy, and
when the occasion sei ved he would be found ready
to vindicate them When the question of lepeal-
mg the duty on salt came up, he for one was ready
to meet it openly, and whenevei that matter
should be deliberately examined into and the facts
comprehended, the result would be entirely dif
feient fiom what had been anticipated in to-day's
description What led them to believe ? why that
the high price of salt in the western country was
owing to the duty, though it was purchased
abioad at a nominal puce This low pi ice was
true with legard to some inferior kinds of salt
only The Senator fiom Alabama spoke of the
price of salt being $1 50 in his countiy, and of
the numeious oppressions practiced there in fore-
stalling the article Now weie they to understand
that the duty was the cause of all this Mr D
then went into an aigument to show that the duty
was not the cause of the high prices He under-
stood the Senator from Alabama to say that no
foieign salt reached his country How then could
the duty cause the high puces ?
Mr CLAY, of Alabama, said that where the
steamboat navigation extended, foieign salt was
earned It was biought to the foot of the Muscle
Shoals in considerable quantities but it was not
much carried beyond that He did notascube
the high prices to the amount of the duty He
spoke of the duty as being a pnncipal cause of
enabling individuals to monopolize the domestic
article
Mi DAVIS said he was happy to hear that
the Senator fiom Alabama did not attribute the
high prices to the duty He thought, if thecan-
doi of the gentleman had suffered him to go a
little further, he would have stated that the duty
had nothing at all to do with these puces
Mr CLAY, of Alabama, said that surely the
Senator must misundeistand him He did not
say that the duty caused the high prices, but that
the duty, operating with other causes, had pro-
duced the effects he spoke of
After some fuither íemarksfiom Mr DAVIS,
comending that the duty had nothing to do with
the high prices of salt in the western country,
Mr BENTON said that some observations
which had fallen from the Senatois fiom South
Carolina and Massachusetts would lequne a buef
answei on his part First, as to the condition of
the Treasuiy.and how far it could dispense with
this tax That was a matter of indiffeience Sup-
posing the importation to be about five million
bushels, the tax, at six cents, would pioduce
something like three bundled thousand dolíais
i Now, he did not exactly know what the fishing
bounties were, but when he looked at them last
I they were something like half a million, and then
I increasing Now, as thesefishing bounties and the
tax must stand or fad t ^ethei, there would be no
great difference to theTieasuiy in the repeal As
to the effect of suddenly taking oft a duty of six
cents a bushel, why that was done a few yeais
ago without any inconvenience bring felt The
gentleman said theie was no difference as to the
price in consequence of the diminution of duty
that had already taken place That was veiy
true Theie would be no difference as to the
price whether the tax was one cent or six cents
To bnns the price down, the article must be kept
out of the hands of the legrateis, and this could
not be done so long as there was a duty of one
cent With íespect to the effect of taking off the
tax by a single operation, that had been tiled in
England when the puce had risen to sixpence
sterling One half was stiuck off at six months,
and the other half at the end of six months thoie-
after, and the effect had been most beneficial The
Senatoi from Massachusetts spoke of the eh( ap
salt as that of an infenor quality Now, exactly
the contrary was the fact It was the puie sun-
made salt, bi ought from the Meditoi ranean, that
, was so cheap, and that which came from Lnghnd
was the poisonous, bittei stuff that they found not
I good enough foi home consumption, and so ex-
