HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS,February 28, 1865.

Brevet Major-General WEBB:

These three men belong to General B. Johnson's division. The troops are being massed on the extreme right of their army. They are expecting an attack from our side. The cars are loaded with heavy ammunition, and are sending away some cotton and burning some. The 8-inch columbiad is not taken away from Cemetery Hill.

The mortar battery, opened this evening, has been erected some time; it contains two large and two small mortars.

Major-General HALLECK,

Chief of Staff:

I do not think Winchester a suitable place for my headquarters for several reasons. It is an extreme outpost, and I am necessarily involved here with a multitude of details properly belonging to the post commander. Martinsburg seems to me to be a more suitable place, and of more importance than seems to be thought. I do not, in fact, see the importance of holding Winchester as an infantry post, if
