HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND, Crawfish Spring, September 16, 1863-5 p. m.

Major General G. GRANGER:

Russell brought the dispatches and telegrams about Carthage, Winchester, and so on. Granger and Lowe must be at Carthage. A larger garrison might have been spared from Gallatin and Clarksville. Give orders accordingly. Spare brigade must come to the mouth of Battle Creek to guard the pontoon-bridge to be placed there, order of to-day. They will also see to the road via Kelley's Ferry, where we shall be able to bring provisions. You must give orders to General Morgan to complete the bridge-head defense at Bridgeport, and post his troops to guard them. You hold our left with Minty on your front to the southeast, between you and Ringgold. Burnside will move down soon, I hope; he will allow you to come forward. The rebels seem disposed to make a stand in the valley, probably as near as La Fayette and Ringgold, probably farther off. Have ordered telegraph to you, and then this way; meanwhile use signal to Gordon's Mills, only 2 miles from here. I would have been glad to have seen you here.

Very respectfully,W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND, Crawfish Spring, September 16, 1863.

Major General GORDON GRANGER:

The general commanding directs you to send out a brigade to reconnoiter the road toward Ringgold, and direct it to bivouac for the night well out in that direction. Colonel Minty is at Peeler's Mill, and has been attacked by the enemy, who appears to be attempting to get in his rear.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. A. GARFIELD,

Brigadier-General and Chief of Staff.

Have the ridge put down at Battle Creek as soon as possible. Lieutenant Burroughs has been ordered to give the necessary directions to the pontoon train.
