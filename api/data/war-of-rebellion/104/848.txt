FORT MONROE, May 20, 1865-8.15 p. m.

(Received 11 p. m.)

Hon E. M. STANTON:

I would suggest that the Quartermaster-General send a transport here to take the women and children to some Southern port, or that the Clyde be use for that purpose, and the prisoners for Fort McHenry be sent there in a gun-boat. There is no army transport here and I have no suitable place for the women and children when the Clyde leaves for Baltimore. Perhaps a Government steamer from New York, bound to Hilton Head or New Orleans, could call for them.

Major-General THOMAS,

Nashville, Tenn.:

I think it will be well for you to send all your surplus cavalry that are returning, from Wilson's command particularly, into Kentucky and scatter them for the purpose of pasturing and recuperating their horses. It may also then to keep the peace about election time.

U. S. GRANT,
