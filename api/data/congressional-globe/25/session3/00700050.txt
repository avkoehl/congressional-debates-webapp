50                                       THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.                      December_20,
that information came, he would be able to form
a corieet opinion on the subject
He had heaid that, under the legislation of the
last winttsi, the Sccietary had sold  one of the
bonds given by the Bank of the Unitt d States, to
the hank itself    Ho presumed, theiefore, that the I
connection, as he had heard on repoit, grew ex
clusively outof that tiansaction     If this connec-
tion had gone fuithei, it had been without his [
knowledge, and should be without his appioba-
tion     He did not undertake to say that he ap-
proved of the  manner in which  the bond was
tiansfened, but he had heaid that no other pur-
chaser of the bond was to be found     He had
heard that means wcic found wanting to pay the
public debt, and foi   this purpose, the sale was
made in the mannei it Ind been      So fai he was
billing to rest until tht Sccietary gave them the
facts, and he should have bet ninuth better pleased '
if the Senttoi  fiom Vngima hid permitted the j
call to be answcitd, and the facts to be laid be
fore them, beioie he diew his inferences     He
was not so much surpuscd at that course of the
Senatoi, as at the ne^t step hi  took, and whit
was th-t'    Why , it was to interpret to the ben
ate and the counti y, not only thee mse of action,
but the views and opinions of the Piesident o^
the United States, and the Secre tai y of the Tieas
ury, togcthei with the policy of the Gove inmi nt, j
fiom the lettei of JNicholas Biddh , who lias not ,
hitheuo been the authoiity fiom which the action I
of these gentlemen has bet n accustomed  to be

He would only obstrve, that when the acts and

of by him, it should not be fiom the comments
of the Bütimuic ( hronicle

muntaining an aimed neutrality, standing be-
tween the two great contending parties in this
counti y     Now, he was compelled to admit that
if the gentleman's position was that of an armed
neutrality, that position had not piecisely been |
understood by him.  If it meant hostility to both
the gteat belligerents, that definition was not the I
one he had given to it, and he should heieafter
be compelled to understand it in a different light
fiom that in which he now did
Mr HIVES begged leave to say a few words
in reply He would as soon have believed that
the sun would have fallen fiom the firmament as
that the Piesident would have restored the con-
nei tion be tween the bank and the Government

gima [Ml   Eivls] toi  nitioducing tin se lebolu
tions, he desired, as much as the Senator, a full
investigation of the conduct of the officers of the
Tieasuiy in the management of the finances
Th inquiries were all veiy piopcr, at any late,
he had no objection toanv of them, oi any otheis
v> hich the Senatoi may choose to make If theie
has been any illegal oi impiopei connection be-
tween the Tieasury and the Bank of the United
States, or any other banks, he would be one of
the last to ]ustify it He wouid not, howevei,
imitate the Senatoi 'i example of condemning the
Secietary fiist, and then mquiung into his con-
duct This was not in accoidance with his no-
tions of justice andpropnety, although, peihaps,
it may be with those of this new school of politi-
cians, belonging to the " armed neutrality "
Mi ¡ST said he shou'd vote for the íesolutions,
and could assure the honorable Senator that ho
would tune voted for them without the eloquent
and veiy temperate speech by which they had
been sustained He thought well of the íesolu-
tions, and would not stop to inquire what the
motives oi object of the movei might be, it was
to be piesumed that they were purely patriotic,
and having lefeience solely to the public interest
A.nd he was sony he could not say as much of
the Senatoi s speech, but it did appear to him
tint that was not exactly in the right tone, it was
a httic too wai m for a neutral, and especially as
the occasion seems to have been sought by the
Senator
1 lie substance of it also appealed to him to be
somewhat obj ctionable Resolutions are offered
proposing ceitun inquines touching the conduct
of the Secietaiy of the 1 teasuiy, and on the con

i speech fill of ci iiniiiation, condemning tht bee
retary foi theveiy actabout which the íesolution
asks foi in'oimation It seemed to linn that it
, would have been quite as candid and fi i to h ivt

changed into a bill of ndictinent against the Ac?
ministration and a'l its supporteis And what is
the pi oof by whuh the chaiges preferud in this
bill of indictment aie attempted to be sustained >
Why, it is the declarations and accusations of
the avowed and swoin eneimi s oe the Admims-
tidtiou the statements and chaigf s of the most
reckless and depiaved of the Opposition piesscs,
whose vocation it is to falsify and misiepiesint

dabl may of witnesses is irtiodueed a very mi

Now, sn , although I heve no fault to fine! with
tins testimony, yet as the Senatoi boasted tint
this wi'ness stood so high in íeputation that he
could not be impeached, he was disposed to offer
a witness standing equally high to impeach him
Hie witness lie had to offer was this same N eh-
ohs Eiddle, who, in his telebiated manifesto, is-
sued on the 5th of April last, gave his testimony
itgaiding this wai He said that it was a war
