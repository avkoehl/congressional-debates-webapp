ACTG. ASST. PROVOST-MARSHAL-GENERAL'S OFFICE, Davenport, Iowa, September 1, 1864.

General JAMES B. FRY,

Provost-Marshal-General, Washington, D. C.:

Your dispatch of yesterday received. I have conferred with the Governor and adjutant-general and find it utterly impossible for them to have the schedules prepared for me by the 5th, probably not for some days thereafter. My work would only them commence.

The plan ordered in your dispatch is a good and just one; but I respectfully suggest that the best thing we can now do is this: After all credits, the delinquent sub-districts in this State are behind about 6,000, but other sub-districts have surplus over all calls, including that of July, 1864, of about 2,000, leaving only about 4,000 due from the State at large. This the people are willing to furnish. Let me assign, pro rata, to the delinquent sub-districts the number actually due from the State, leaving the balance to be adjusted thereafter. Meantime I can be carrying out your instructions regarding schedule of State authorities, so as to do justice to all localities hereafter. This will obviate necessity for postponing draft. The Governor is present and approves the foregoing.

THOMAS DUNCAN,

Acting Assistant Provost-Marshal-General.

WAR DEPT., PROVOST-MARSHAL-GENERAL'S OFFICE, Washington, D. C., September 1, 1864.

Major THOMAS DUNCAN,

Actg. Ast. Provost-Marshal-General, Davenport, Iowa:
