Brigadier General JOHN A. RAWLINS:

GENERAL: A messenger just in from General Merrit says that the reconnaissance sent out from near Boisseau's encountered the enemy in considerable force. They went to about two miles of the Five Forks, and found the enemy occupying the road. Those going north proceeded to about a mile of the White Oak road, and found the road also occupied by the enemy. Nearly all the forces met were cavalry. All the roads leading toward the White Oak road are covered by the enemy. No engagement reported.

Lieutenant-Colonel BOWERS,

City Point:

Warren and Humphreys have pushed forward until the enemy now occupy the same position about Burgess' Mill they did when General hancock had his battle last fall. There has been some pretty sharp fighting, but I do not know the result, further than the enemy were forced back. Merritt's division of cavalry met the enemy's cavalry at J. Boisseau's, and drove them back on both roads from that point. Merritt followed up his success, and now holds Five Forks, on the White Oak road, and also where the right-hand road from Boisseau's house intersects the same road.
