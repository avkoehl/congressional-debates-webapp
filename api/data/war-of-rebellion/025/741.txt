Major General STERLING PRICE,

Commanding Second Corps:

GENERAL: I have ordered the bridge across the Tallahatchie repaired to-night and well guarded, but had better send a discreet officer there to-night to see that it is in condition for your train to pass to-morrow morning. I desire that you will please move your train to-morrow morning across the Tallahatchie, but hold your troops where they are until further orders, of course with their three days' cooked rations.

Have your train parked just beyond the river, near Abbeville.

General Lovell will move his train back to where your camp now is and across the river, if possible. The enemy are moving from Corinth toward Saulsbury on the State Line road.

Respectfully,

EARL VAN DORN,

Major-General.
HDQRS. DEPT. OF THE MISSISSIPPI,Jackson, Miss., November 4, 1862.

Major General STERLING PRICE,

Commanding, &amp;c., near Holly Springs:

GENERAL: I am directed by the lieutenant-general commanding to say he does not desire that you should order more horses for that portion of your cavalry force which is now dismounted, the proportion of cavalry in relation to the infantry of the army being already too great. Such horses as you may have already obtained you will use in mounting additional men but it is not desired that you should increase your present cavalry force to any extent.

I am, respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. W. MEMMINGER,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
