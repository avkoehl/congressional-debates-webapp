General HOOKER:

Enemy advancing of Fredericksburg from hill behind Howison house. About one brigade in sight. Sedgwick, at 6.20 a. m., says he has had nothing from you.

BUTTERFIELD.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,May 4, 1863 - 7.15 a. m.

General HOOKER:

Forces engaging Gibbon in front of Fredericksburg seem to imperil our communication with Sedgwick. I fear the staff officer who left here with a copy of Warren's dispatch will not reach him. From the tenor of that officer's statement, I judge Sedgwick was waiting to hear from you. It is important that he should get Warren's dispatch. Gibbon just advised me that deserter reports Longstreet's forces in direction of Bowling Green.

DANL. BUTTERFIELD,

Major-General, Chief of Staff.

7.20 a. m. - The enemy have reached Orange Plank road, in front of Fredericksburg.

MAY 4, 1863 - 7.20 a. m.

Major-General SEDGWICK:

One of your staff just left with dispatch from General Warren to you. A brigade of the enemy are reported advancing on Fredericksburg.

DANL. BUTTERFIELD,

Major-General, Chief of Staff.

MAY 3, [4,] 1863 - 8 a. m.

General SEDGWICK:

The general directs me to day that, from information received from Generals Warren and Howard of the movements of the enemy, that it is their intention to make the attempt to pierce our center. He desires that if any portion of your force is available, and can be spared, they be moved in a central position, near where they can support Howard or be thrown to the right or left, as required. He is under the impression that you have three bridges in reserve, and thinks perhaps two of them might be disposed as above.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

DANL. BUTTERFIELD,

Major-General, Chief of Staff.
