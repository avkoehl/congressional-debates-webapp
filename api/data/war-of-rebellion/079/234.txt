It is reported that Hood is making a movement in the direction of Chattanooga and Bridgeport. The major-general commanding wishes you to send out cavalry scouts and ascertain the truth of the matter if possible, and advise him at once if you discover anything, and also advise the commanding officer of any post he may be attempting to demonstrate against. General Morgan, with his DIVISION, is on his way to Chattanooga, where he will stop to re-enforce the garrison of Chattanooga, if that be the point aimed at.
