HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,October 5, 1864. (Sent 3.08 p. m.)

Major-General HANCOCK,

Commanding Second Corps:

The commanding general wishes you to make such disposition of Mott's division as you consider best. A brigade of his division was ordered to relieve Ferrero's troops between Fort Davis and Fort Alexander Hays, because it was thought you had none at hand to relieve them, and Parke should have Ferrero's men as soon as possible. There will be no troops in the rifle-pits between Fort Alexander Hays and Fort Howard. Your picket-line and that of the Fifth Corps are expected to keep that part of the front.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,October 5, 1864-7.50 p. m.

General HUMPHREYS:

Major Falls, commanding cavalry at Prince George, says his pickets were fired at to-night along this whole line. He sent in a man he found on his line with a pass from General Patrick. I have sent him up for identification.

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,October 5, 1864-8.30 [p. m.].

General HUMPHREYS:

Has the regiment of cavalry to Old Court-House? Major Falls, commanding cavalry at Prince George, reports at 8 p. m., the enemy is evidently trying to force his left and rear from the direction of Sycamore Church, aiming, he thinks, for the trains. He says, however, that he has held his own thus far, but that his command is much scattered on account of the great number of roads being picketed, fifty being the largest number he has together at one place.

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,October 5, 1864. (Sent 9.44 p. m.)

Commanding Second Corps:

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
