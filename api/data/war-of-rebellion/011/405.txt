THOMAS JORDAN,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

CORINTH, April 9, 1862.

It was never intended to hold a position so near the river. I only regret, however, it could not be held long enough to secure all of the immense amount of artillery stores and supplies captured on the 6th instant.

G. T. BEAUREGARD.
