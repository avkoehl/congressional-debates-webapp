NASHVILLE, TENN., September 29, 1864-7. 30 p. m.

(Received 8. 30 p. m.)

Major T. T. ECKERT:

No news of Forrest to-day. Telegraph cut in three places between Duck and Elk Rivers last night. Got open to Chattanooga again at 2 p. m. Slight damage to railroad at the same time; now repaired. Looks as though could smash Forrest this time. General Thomas coming up to direct the operations from Stevenson.

Captain and Assistant Quartermaster.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, Atlanta, Ga., September 29, 1864.

Major General G. H. THOMAS,

Commanding Department of the Cumberland:

If Forrest is about the tunnel and Decherd you must look out for him coming down by the University and Battle Creek to Stevenson and Bridgeport. General Granger should open communication with Rousseau at Pulaski, even if he has to risk a fight, for Forrest will only leave a detachment at Elkton or Prospect.

Major-General.

Brigadier-General ELLIOTT,

Commanding Cavalry, Department of the Cumberland:

GENERAL: I am instructed by the general-in-chief to say that a man just in from Hood's [headquarters] reports Hardee's corps moving at 5 this a. m., and he desires the cavalry to reconnoiter down toward Carrollton for obtaining information as soon as possible, but not for fighting, and to report accordingly.

I am, general, respectfully, &amp;c.,

Aide-de-Camp.

Brigadier-General ELLIOTT,

Chief of Cavalry, Department of the Cumberland:

General Howard reported symptoms of Hood's crossing the Chattahoochee to the west. You may instruct Garrard to send down, say a brigade, to Kilpatrick to enable him to watch the movement, and also let him push his shoeing and be ready. Our cavalry must do more, for it is strange Forrest and Wheeler should circle around us thus. We should at least make ten miles to his hundred.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.
