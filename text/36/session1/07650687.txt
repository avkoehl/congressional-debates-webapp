VETO MESSAGE MOUTII OF THE MISSISSIPPI.
The following message was received from the
President of the United States:
To the Senate of the United States:
On the last day of the last session of Congress,
a resolution, which had passed both Houses, " in
relation to the removal of obstructions, to naviga-
tion in the mouth of the Mississippi river," was
presented to me for approval. I have retained this
resolution, because it was presented tome ata pe-
riod when it was impossible to give the subject
that examination to which it appeared to be enti-
tled. I need not repeat the views on this point,
presented in the introductory portion of my mes-
sage to the Senate, of the 2d instant.
In addition, I would merely observe, that, al-
though at different periods sums amounting in the
aggregateto $690,000, have been appropriated by
Congress for the purpose of removing the bar and
obstructions at the mouth of the Mississippi, yet
it is now acknowledged that this money has been
expended with but little if any practical benefit to
its navigation. JAMES BUCHANAN.
Washington:, 6th February, 1860.
On motion of Mr. SLIDELL, the message was
ordered to lie on the table, and be printed.

Mr. IVERSON. I barely wish to. present to
the Senate a word of explanation in respect to
these bills. They are bills which were reported
by the Court of Claims in favor of the claimants.
All the reports made by the Court of Claims to
the Senate, both those favorable and those ad-
verse to the claims, have been referred to the
Committee on Claims. That committee, afler
consultation, have come to the conclusion to re-
port all the cases back to the Senate; the bills in
favor of the claims to be put on the Calendar and
to be taken up and considered by the Senate at
the proper time,anchthc adverse reports to goon
the Calendar also, to be considered and decided
by the Senate. The committee have not investi-
gated any of these eases. They have expressed
no opinion as to whether the bills ought to pass
or not, or whether the adverse reports ought to
stand or not. The principles of these reports
from tho Court of Claims are all elaborately dis-
cussed m the decisions. The principles involved
are spread on the record, and of course each Sen-
ator can decide them for himself. The committee,
however, thought it unnecessary to express any
opinion on any of these cases, and the present
