CUMBERLAND FORD, May 22, 1862.

Major-General BUELL:

A reliable scout has just come in. The enemy has withdrawn from Big Creek Gap and will reach Cumberland Gap to-day. Reliable letter from Clinton also informs me that the road between Clinton and Knoxville is lined with troops coming this way. It is probable that the enemy is concentrating his entire force in East Tennessee upon my immediate front. The march of to-day will be executed as before ordered, but it may become imprudent to pass mountains unless a strong diversion be made upon Cleveland or Chattanooga by General Mitchel. Will the interests of the service permit such a diversion to be made?

GEORGE W. MORGAN,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

CUMBERLAND FORD, May 24, 1862.

Colonel J. B. FRY:

Colonel A. Jamison [?], Cumberland Gap, has been re-enforced by a brigade, of four regiments of infantry, one battery of artillery, and 400 cavalry, and a brigade has just arrived at Big Creek Gap from Knoxville. Kirby Smith is again at the former gap, the defense of which has been increased since our last-received reconnaissance. Two regiments from Virginia, probably forced back by the advance of Cox, have reached Knoxville, and the enemy has withdrawn the bulk of his force from the neighborhood of Chattanooga and Cleveland. I had taken steps to organize a partisan regiment, under Colonel Clift (commissioned by the Secretary of War), in Scott and Morgan Counties, Tennessee, in order to annoy the enemy's rear. During the last three weeks there have been rumors of the intended invasion of Kentucky by Smith. Some of our friends in East Tennessee attach consequence to these reports. Three of my brigades threaten the enemy's front.

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

CUMBERLAND FORD, June 8, 1862.

Major-General BUELL:

Baird's brigade marches this morning, and Carter's will close up the rear to-morrow. It has become necessary to station the Forty-ninth Indiana, with the two pieces of artillery, at Barboursville. On yesterday a spy, pretending to be a deserter, was brought into camp. He left Cumberland Gap on the day before yesterday at 2 o'clock a.m. He reports the enemy's force at Cumberland Gap at over 5,000. At Big
