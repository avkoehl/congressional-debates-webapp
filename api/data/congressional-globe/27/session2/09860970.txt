They afeo recommend that the Senate recede
from its second an endment, and that the words
" to show," ía the 15ta line, be stricken out, and
the words, ' as competent evidence for the pur-
pose of showing," be ln-ened in lieu thereof.
Mr. BERRIEN entered into an explanation to
show the diffeience between the recommendations
of the committee and the original amendments in
dispute.
Mr. WOODBURY made some remarks, showing
that the bib, if amended as agreed upon by the
committee of conference, would yet have the effect
to disfranchise the S a es in certain cases, and par
ticularly the Slates of New Hampshire and Ohio,
under th~ cireums arces m which hey are placed
The qaesa n was then taken on concurring in
the report of th  committee of conference, and it
was carried m the affirmative.
On motion <f Mr MERRICK, the prei ous
orders of the day were posip ned, and the Senate
took up the bill establishing additional post-'outes,
as in committee of the whole
Mr MERRICK read a communication from the
Post Office Department, snowing ibat the btI!, as
pa'sed by he House, created routes, the pggret;?te
length of which amounted to, at least, 10,440 mi'es,
that the c^st of putt ng th  same in opera ion would
(in connexion with such loutes in the bill, for
which no c rrect estímale was yet formed) be, at
leabt, $100 000, hat the additional income to the
department uould not exceed $20,000, which
would leave $80 000 of the expense to be provided
for oat of the present income of th° department
from o her sources, and wmch could not be done
without increasing its debt, or greatly reducing the
mail faeiln s to other sections of the countrv Mr
M said he lelt it his du'y, under theoircum lance ,
(though the committee had lecommended several
amendments ) to test the set se of the Senate on the
bill, before proceeding to consider those amend-
ments He therefore moved the indefinite post-
ponement of the bill.
Messrs KING WALKER LINN, BERRIEN,
and MOREHEAD opposed this motion, contend-
ing that many <f the routes in the bill were abso-
lutely necessary; ana that whiKt the old States m
the Eist had routts running parallel to each other,
and unnecessary, the South and Southwest were
deprived of facilities indispensably rece« ary.
They were in favor of ti e bill, tht egh the Pist-
master Gen r>l, in his di cretion, might fird it
necessary to discontinue si mc t f the o d routes
The qutsiion on the v dtfinite postponement was
put, and decided in th   negative.

tee on the P s.t Office ard Post Roads were ^en
considered That proponrg to diicentinue certain

REORGAN1ZVTIÓN   OP   THE  NAVY   DE-
" PARTMENT.
Mr BAYARD, from the Committee en Naval
Affairs, to which had been referred the bill reor-
ganizing the Navy Department, as amended by the
House, reported lhat the committee had instrue'ed
him to recommend that the Senate concur in all
the amendments of the Hou e, except the one
consolidating three of the bureaus into one, to be
cailed the "bureau of construction, of equipme t,
and repairs " He «aid that the committee was not
oppo ed to consolidating the bureaus, but thought
it unnecessary and improper to place at the hiai
of the bureau alluded to a naval constructor.
They, therefore, for the purpose of having the
words "a naval constructor" stricken íri m the
amendment of the House propose that the amend-
ment embracing tho<e word  be disagreed to, and
that a cc mmtttee ot conference be appointed to
eflect that cb] et
The amendments were agreed to, as recom-
mended by the commit er, and a committee of
conference, to coMist ot three, was appointed by
the Ch?ir

the pro vise in the 1st section cf the act of 1840,
the simple apphcat on of the Secre'ary of the Navy

transfer of any appropna'ion from the specific obj ct
