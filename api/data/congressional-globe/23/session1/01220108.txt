Of the amount of gold coined within the past
year, about $85,000 were derived from Mexico,
South America, and the West Indies; $12,000
from Africa; $868,000 from the gold region of the
United States; and about $13,000 from sources
not ascertained.
Of the amount of gold of the United States,
above mentioned, about $104,000 may be stated
to have been received from Virginia, $475,000
from North Carolina, $660,000 from South Caro-
lina, $216,000 from Georgia, and about $700 from
Tennessee.
The annexed statement exhibits the quantity
of gold received from the several districts of the
United States which have thus far produced it
in sufficient quantities to be an object of regard,
commencing with the year 1824. Previously to
that period gold had been received at the Mint
only from North Carolina, from which quarter it
was first transmitted for coinage in 1804. During
the interval, however, from that date to 1823,
inclusive, the average amount had not exceeded
$2,500.
In the report of 1st January, 1833, it was re-
marked that the quantity of gold of the United
States brought to the Mint in the year 1832 was
regarded, according to estimates entitled to great
respect, as not much exceeding one half the quan-
tity produced from the mines within that year;
nearly an equal amount being supposed to have
been exported uncoined, or consumed in the arts.
Nothing has since occurred to create a doubt of
the correctness of that conjecture. It is altogether ■
probable that the remark is equally true in regard
to the last year, and that the amount of gold derived
from the United States within that period has ex-
ceeded one million and a half of dollars. This sum,
it is believed, is not less than about one fifth of
the amount of gold produced within the same
period from all other sources in Europe and Amer-
ica, estimated according to the best authorities.
I have the honor to be, with great respect, your
obedient servant,         SAMUEL MOORE,
Director of the Mint of the United States.
To the President of the United States.
