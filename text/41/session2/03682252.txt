THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
March. 28,
agricultural advantages, with exhaustless sup-
plies of iron and coal in proximity, with gush-
ing fountains of oil, Pennsylvania is naturally
the richest region of the earth. Filled with an
industrious and energetic population, overflow-
ing with accumulated capital, in the center of
this great Republic, there is no part of God's
green earth comparable unto her. Bat her
distinguished Representative draws a strange
conclusion from these premises. He argues
.that because Pennsylvania is great and rich,
prosperous and powerful beyond all other
States and communities in the world, therefore
we must, give her bounty, and continue to give
her more and more, for ever and ever. I say
because she has so much she ought not to ask
for more.
I have done no injustice, Mr. Chairman, to
the State of Pennsylvania. I was careful not
to do her injustice. In the figures which I
quoted to show her productions of coal and
iron I took the reports of 1868 for iron and of
1800 for coal, which were far below the real
figures. If gentlemen will refer to the Miners'
Journal for 1870 they will find that Pennsyl-
vania produced in 1809 over 18,000,000 tons of
anthracite and at the lowest estimate 12,000,000
tons of bituminous coal; awl I submit a table
showing her production of coal and iron for
18(57, 186 8, and 1809, and the amount of the
premium of the tariff upon that production.
1 take low estimates of coal, and not having
the official figures of pig iron for 1807 or 1809,
I average the three years at 850,000 tons, the
production of 1808, as given in the Year Book
for 1869. These figures will show how far short
of the full amount my former estimates were:

1 do not assume that all this treasure was
actually paid to these interests, but it cannot
be denied that protective tariffs generally en-
hance the price of the foreign article and of
the domestic product to the consumer, and
prima facie they increase the price by the
amount of the duty. On page 108 of the re-
port of the New York Chamber of Commerce
for 1868-09 it is said:
"All the figures referring to imports represent only
their foreign gold cost, freight and duty unpaid. To
show the cost ia our currency to tho consumers the
total shuuld he doubled, and the whole then in-
creased about -10 per cent.; this would represent
about the selling rates in our market."
These merchants who deal in imported goods
may not know much of the science of political
economy,but they arc safe witnesses to the faet
ofthe cost of articles they buy and sell. They not
only add the duty, but interest, insurance, and
profit upon the duty, and generally, when the
commodity reaches the consumer it is burdened,
by reason ot the tariff, with double the tariff.
1 So that the consumer pays a tax on imports
amounting to twice the revenue, while only
half of what he pays goes to the Government.
These general propositions are clear, and who-
ever in any case as to any particular article
asserts an exception is bound to prove it. If
the price of the foreign article to the consumer
is increased the domestic article will rule at
the same rate; and I should be pleased to hear
when, where, and by whom the domestic article
is sold for less than the imported equivalent.
Mr. Chairman, this question ot protective
tariff for the encouragement of American indus-
try is one of equity. We have poured into the
capacious lap of Pennsylvania countless riches,
and now she comes into this high court, to the
bar of public opinion, and asks for more. Sup-
pose she be required to state her account with
the national bounty fund for the encourage-
ment of domestic production. How would it
stand ? I have given some items. Let me refer
to a few more. In the book of Baddow and
Barman on ''Coal, Iron, and Oil," pnblished at
Pottsville, 1866, pages 08-1 to 693, will be found
tables of the production of pig iron for 1864
and 1865; the name of (he furnace, capital
invested, and amount produced. Let us turn
for illustration to page 685, the " Lehigh Group
of Anthracite Furnaces." We find that this
group of furnaces had invested $4,860,500.
They produced pig iron as follows:
Tom,
180 4 214,098
180 5 267,110
Total   481,209
The average price for 1804 and 1805 may be
safely stated at $50 per ton,- during that
period it reached $71. The product of tho
Lehigh group for those two years was, there-
fore, worth $24,060,450; tho cost of mak-
ing could not exceed $30; which would bo
$14,430,270, leaving a net profit of $20 per
ton, amounting to $9,024,180; nearly double
the entire capital. The "Lehigh Crane Iron
Works" and the "Allentown Iron Works," with
a capital of $1,000,000, each produced in 1865,
50,000 tons, which at a profit of $20 per ton
w-ould leave to each of these corporations a
net gain of precisely the amount of the entire
capital in a single year. 1 will not now pursue
this inquiry; the people will one day demand
the account in lull. Enough is apparent
to justify judgment against those who would
continue and increase exorbitant bounties
to those who can well do without them at
the expense of those who can ill spare them.
Equity must send these parties out of court
with an admonition to wash their hands of their
enormous gains before they return to tho tem-
ple of justice to claim more public bour.ty.
Mr. Chairman, I have done no injustice to
Pennsylvania. I have but reminded her Rep-
resentatives and the country of some facts
material to the pending question. I would not
injure that State nor any of her people. My
plea is for a more liberal policy, an enlarged
free list, and cheaper raw material. Pennsyl-
vania can well afford to give us this policy.
She alone prevents its adoption. Would that
her spirit were equal to her fortune! But she
seems possessed ofthe spirit of monopoly, that
spiritwhieh hovers about the collieries and in-
spires consph'acies by sham strikes to raise the
price of coai; that spirit which gougesthe roofs
of the mines until the supports give way and a
village tumbles in ; that spirit which neglects
the opening of the shaft until the miners per-
ish ; that spirit which advises oil producers to
stop the flow of their wells in order to raise
the price ; that spirit which sells a cup of cold
water for money. Lot the noble State of Penn-
sylvania exorcise that fell spirit before it wholly
overmasters her and leads her to destruction.
Mr. DICKEY. If the gentleman will allow
me I should like to ask him a question.
Mr. STEVENSON. My time is limited and
I cannot yield for interruptions.
Mr. DICKEY. I only wish to ask whether
if you take the duty off coal you would make it
cheaper at Cincinnati ?
Mr. STEVENSON. I think we would. It
would prevent monopoly.
Mr. DICKEY. Nova Scotia coal would go
there, I suppose.
Mr. STEVENSON. No; but more Penn-
sylvania coal would go West.
The gentleman complains of me because I
ask for equal taxation, and compares me to
Calhoun. I suppose that was going as low a.s
his imagination could descend. What was it
that Calhoun wanted in his day ? It was to
apply the old constitutional rule of unequal,
direct taxation, that compromise with slavery
which gave to the South the advantage of two
fifths of her slaves. What is it that I propose ?
It is to enable the Government to raise revenue
by equal taxation on property according to
value. I do but propose that the nation may
do what Ohio does; and no party complains
of it there ; what Pennsylvania does in her
local taxation, for while, as I have shown, she
supports her State government by special taxes,
her county taxes are levied on property accord-
ing to value. I do but propose what is con-
sonant with the spirit of the Constitution itself,
which provides for a uniform rule of taxation
in all cases, excepting the anomalous provision
for the representative basis.
Gentlemen say this rule would oppress the
poor; but exemptions could be made, as they
are in Ohio and other States, in favor of pov-
erty, religion, charity, and education. All rea-
sonable exemptions could be made. Why does
the gentleman denounce this ideaof taxing prop-
erty. Is it not the only sound principle? The
reason is plain. It is part and parcel of his
peculiar policy. He would abolish all internal
faxes, so that a high protective tariff may be
indispensable to revenue. Tie proposes to
repeal the tax on whisky rather than touch the
tariff on coal or salt or lumber or iron. Nay,
he would make whisky free, in order to in-
crease the duties on those raw materials, neces-
saries of life. He would abolish all internal
taxes save "stamps" and "tobacco," in order
to build up tho walls around his local interests,
and raise the artificial rim of his cup so that it
may hold more of the people's treasures. And
what would be the effect of his policy? To
increase the profits of protected interests while
decreasing their burdens.
Pennsylvania now stands third on the tax
list, paying in 1869, $15,438,975 58 of internal
revenue, while Ohio paid $16,082,497 38.
Pennsylvania stands first on the roll of bene-
ficiaries. When bounties are distributed she
answers first, but when burdens are to be borne
she comes third, reluctant and slow ; and now
she seeks through her leading Representative
to abolish all burdens and retire from the com-
pany of tax-payers.
The gentleman objects to the system of in-
ternal taxes on account of the cost. This is to
be regretted, but it is light compared to the
cost of tariff duties to the people, in bounties
on domestic articles, and the increased cost
of imports over and above the duties.
Let us consider how equal taxation of prop-
erty would operate. Suppose we could levy
one mill on the dollar upon the grand dupli-
cate of the property of the country. It would
scarcely be felt, and yet it would raise for the
Treasury $30,000,000 to $40,000,000 a year.
Suppose that wc should levy one quarter of a
cent on the dollar, it would raise nearly
$100,000,000 a year; then we could strip off
all burdensome taxes, internal and external,
and have an equitable system to which nobody
could object. I warn gentlemen that the day
is coming-when the people will consider this
question. We have abolished slavery and es-
tablished liberty. We are now suppressing
violence and establishing security; and when
the land is at last free and secure, the people
will take up the question of equal taxation. I
congratulate gentlemen who in field and council
have battled and labored so bravely and well
for liberty and equality. They have not fought
or toiled in vain.
The American people are free, they are
omnipotent, and they will use their power
against their only remaining enemy—monop-
oly. They will confront it wherever it rears
