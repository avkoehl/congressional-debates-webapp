HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,Chattanooga, Tenn., October 9, 1863.

Ho. EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

Communication has been interrupted. I have not written since the 5th. Forage grows scarce. Many horses are unserviceable and some have died. Foragers must go far, and require heavy guards. I have advised sending for supplies all teams except the artillery and ammunition; to let these do the work of the post. Forage should be pushed forward from Nashville, where there is ample supply in depot. A little interchange of artillery fire yesterday afternoon' ineffective on both sides. Hooker has orders to forage below Stevenson. Rosecrans thinks he will thus obtain much. Forage from Nashville appears to me more important than men just now, as without it what we have may be unable to follow the enemy should he cross the river above in force. If the artillery and ammunition horses give out the army cannot move. A few days' rations for itself it could carry without wagons, and once on the march with these animals it could find forage. Chief quartermaster, Colonel Hodges, is at Nashville, fitting out trains for Hooker's troops. I have not lately been able to communicate with him.

M. C. MEIGS,

Quartermaster-General.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

I returned from Cleveland this a.m. I saw Mr. Stone, who has turned over to me the contract made by him. I think the arrangements made will secure the amount of stock required in the time named in my report to you. Railroad companies in the West have responded promptly to my call for equipments. I will go to Chicago on Monday to hurry the work in that neighborhood.

J. B. ANDERSON.

LOUISVILLE, October 9, 1863. (Received 5.40 p.m.)

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

Mr. Anderson returned from Cleveland this a.m., where he had an interview with Mr. Stone. Arrangements so far completed for equipment by Mr. Anderson will insure it being on the line more quickly than first expected. If General Rosecrans or Colonel Innes are sending agents east for equipments they should be notified that Mr. Anderson has arranged for the stock, and to countermand any order they have given.

THOS. A. SCOTT.
