Major: I would respectfully report but little sharpshooting on my line yesterday. The enemy's land batteries unusually quiet until evening, when they opened on my left. The enemy's water battery on the Peninsula threw a few shells on the left on my line, but the proximity of their own line has prevented them from shelling it to any extent.
