THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
M
Mr PLUMMERproposedtoaddthefollowmg,
as an amendment to the resolution
" And also into the expediency of reducing the
coniDensa'iSn of the memoers ot Congress. '
Mr CLAYTON said, if the resolution he pro-
posed was examined into, it would be found to
provide for reduction into all salaries derivable
under the Government, and which would include
the pay to members He would remark, that
what had been stated by the gentleman from Ohio
was stnctly correct He had not had any conver-
sation with him as to this proposition He had
been prompted to make it solely from having as-
certained, from many members, that if such a res-
olution should be proposed, they would support it
He believed the s°ns  of the House had been
sufficiently expressed, and «hat as the attempt of
thegent'eman tiomOmo to procure íetrenchment,
through the medium of the bills making appropri-
ations for the salaries of public officers, would
prove abortive, he desned to bring up ihe subject
ma shape unconnected with any nppropnaticn bill,
and if his proposition was ad opted, ho should desire
that the amendment proposed by the gentleman
from Ohio should cease The whole matter was,
in fact, unpremeditated on his part
Mr HARDIN hoped that the member from
Mississippi would modify his amendment so as to
include with the rJay of members that which was
paid them in the shape of "mileage "
Mr PLUMMER assented, and
Mr. CLAYTON agreed to modify his resolution
eo as to include these amendments
The resolution, as modified, was then agreed
to—yeas 183, nays 2
Mr WISE, ot Vnginia, then asked the unan-
imous consent of the House to offer the resolutions
presented by him yesterday, as follows

public moneys of the United States not appropria-
ted by law, and not disbursed under appropriations
by law, are, by the Constitution, placed under the
order and direction ofthe Congre&s of the United
States
Resolved, That no change of the Constitution
of the United States is necessary to authorize the
Congress of the United States to intrust the cus
tody of the public money, not appropriated by law,
and not disbursed under appiopriation by law, to
other agency than that of the executive denart-
ment, and that the custody of the public money
must not be necessarily, under the Constitution,
intrusted to the executive department
Resolved, That Congtess can take out of the
hands of the executive department the custody of
the public property, or money, without an assump-
tion of executive power, or a subversion of the
first principles of the Constitution, by the repeal
and enactment of such laws as may be necessary
to that end

IN SENATE
MoNDiY, Vt¡21, 1834
Tne following message, explanatory of the Pro-
' test sent oi the 17th instant, was loceived from
| the Tiesident of the United States by Mi   Donel-
| °on, his Pnvate Secietary
jfo the Senate of tne United Staler
Having leason to bel eve thtt certain passages
contained in my message and protest transmitted
to the Senate on the 17th instint may be misun-
dfibtood, I think it p oper to state that it was not
my intention jto deny in tne said message the powei
and ngnt of the legis'ative department to provide
by law for the custody, sife keeping, and dispo-
sition of the public money and propelty of the
1 United States
!     Although t am well sa'isfied that such a con-
struction is not warranted by anything contaii ed
in that message, yet aware, from esoenence, that
! detached passages of an argumentative document,
when disconnected fiom then context, and con-
I sidered without leference to previous limitations,
I and the paiucüar positions they weie mt-nded to
' lefute or to establish, may be made to bear a con-
struction varying altogether from the sentiment 
really entertained and intended to be expressed,
and deeply solicitous that my views on this point
should not, either now or hereafter, be misappre-
hended, I have deemed it due to the gravity of
the subject, to the great interest it involves, and
to the Senate, as well as to myself, to embrace the
earliest opportunity to make this communication.
1  admit, without reserve, as I have before done,
the constitutional power of the Legislature to pre-
scube, by law, the place or places in which the
public money or other property is to be deposited,
and to make such regulations concerning its cus-
tody, removal, oi disposition, as they may think
proper to enact Nor do I claim for the Executive
any right to the possession or disposition of the
public property or treasure, or any authority to
interfere with the same, except when such posses-
sion, disposition, or authority, is given to him by
law Nor do I claim the right in any manner to
supervise or interfere with the persons intrusted
wuh such property or treasure, unless he be an
officer whose appointment is, under the Constitu-
tion and laws, devolved upon the President, alone,
or in conjunction with the Senate, and foi whose
conduct he is constitutionally responsible
As the message and piotest referred to may
appear on the journals of the Senate, and remain
among the recorded documents of the nation, I am
unwilling that opinions should be imputed to me,
even thiough misconstruction, which I do not en-
tertain, and more partieulail, am I solicitous that
I may not be supposed to claim for myself, or my
successors, any power or authouty not clearly
granted to the President by the Constitution and
laws I have therefore_respectfully to request that
this communication may be considered a part of
that message, and that it may be entered therewith
on the Journals of the Senate
ANDREW JACKSON.
Atml 21„(, 1834
Aftei the message had been read—
Mr POINDEXTER rose and said, he desired
to make the same motion in regaid to this, that
he had made relative to the original message, he
moved to lay this on the table, and would sendto
the Chair certain resolutions whichlie offered as a
modification of his original motion, that the paper
be not received, and which he moved to print.
The resolutions were redd as follows*
1 Resolved, That the President,in transmitting
the paper which he did to the Senate on the 17th
instant, which he requested to be placed on its
Journals, as an executive protest, against a reso-
lution passed by the Senate, made a communica-
tion not authorized by the Constitution, nor war-
ranted by that mutual interchange of communica-
tions which the discharge of official duties renders
necessary and proper between the legislative and
executive departments
2    Resohed, That the Presidert, in the paper
aoove refened to, assumes powers in relation to
the Senate not authorized by the Constitution, and
calculated in us consequences to destroy that har-
mony which ought to exist between the coordi-
nate departments of theü-eneral Government, to
interfere with the Senate in the discharge of its
duties, to degrade it in the public opinion, and,
finally, to destroy lts^ndependence, by subjecting
its rights and duties to the determination and con-
trol of the Chief Magisti ate
3    Resohed, That the communication of a paper
of such a chaiactei, with the declaration that ac-
companied it, is a plain and open biPaeh of the con-
stitutional rights and privileges of the Senate, and
that it cannot he received by this body without a
surrender of the just powers confided to it by the
Constitution, in ti ust, to secui e the lioerty and pro-
mote the prosperity of these States, and which the
members aie bound to maintain,under the sacred
obligations of an oa h
4    Resolved, theiefoie, That the paper be not
received by the Senate
A debate of some length then ensued upon the
supplemental message of the Piesident and Mr
Poinoextfr'c mo'ion.in which Messrs PRES-
TON, FORSYTH EWING, POINDEXTER,
CLAYTON, WEBSTER, and CLAY, partici
pated.
1 he supplemental message was then laid on the
table, and the Senate proceeded to the
