July 14, 1864.

Colonel GOULD,Corps Officer of the Day, Ninth Army Corps:

SIR: I have the honor to report that in pursuance of instructions I visited the lines of the Third Division, both in the night and during the day. I found the men in the trenches and on picket watchful and attentive to the movements of the enemy. There was the usual picket-firing and some digging on the part of the enemy during the night. The latter, I concluded, was simply individual effort for the purpose of making a retreat against shot for the digger. I regret to say there is not as much attention paid to cleanliness in this division as could be desired. The fault arises from men committing nuisances in out of way places. There is not much offal lying about. In most cases the ground occupied by the troops is such that sinks can be dug in covered places without difficulty. I directed the attention of brigade officers of the day to the above facts, but would suggest that unless regimental commanders give some special attention to this neglect it cannot be wholly obviated.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JNumbers L. YOUNG,

Captain, 2nd Mich. Infty., Div. Officer of the Day, 3rd Div., 9th A. C.
