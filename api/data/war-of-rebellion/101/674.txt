do and will abound. Since my return I have issued an order on this subject, which I inclose, and the people must act in conformity with the order or suffer from constant depredations. If they continue to act the part of cravens and cowards, when fully assured that they have to support and aid them the strong arm of the law and the military power of the Federal Government, I can see no way no way to correct existing evils. Every soldier and man complained against for crime in that section has been at once arrested and speedily tried and punished. Complaint has been made of two soldiers killing the Bell boy, and both are arrested and will soon be tried. In a command so large, temporarily, it is utterly impossible for me to get at the individual cases of crime unless the people promptly report them. When the time comes that every citizen feels it his duty to and does report every case of crime that comes to his knowledge, then law and order be speedily restored, together with public confidence and a universal feeling of security.

Respectfully, yours,

JOHN B. SANBORN,
