If I have not been mi infoimed, your Government agents and
contraaoik on the Cumbe land road have attempted, and &ue
reeded m exeici«ing a ] olitieal ínflucnre over tl e laboréis in
their emplo) ment It has been an obiect asdear to then hearts
to cany an election as to construct the load, and they have eo
managed it as to connect the road with politics, and politics
with filling the r pockets ma manner equally degrading and
corrupt
It will not f illow as a  consequence  that we shall have no
good load   if we now abandon  the  scleme of having them
made hy the Geneial Government    Far 0 herwise      The ie
souioes of the Statfo have vastly increased since a system of
general internal impiovement   tobe can ed on by the nan n,
was first conceived    The States are now able to make loads
and  canals   for themselves      Some of them have already
completed  splendid   work       All   are   busily   engaged   up
on improven entismted to their respective situations and con
ditiont  and under the change of circumstances, the Geneial
Government will promote the merestsot the people ina moie
eminent degree by mcreabing the power and means of ihe
States, than can bedone b) leaving the fctatee unaided, and to
ingon asheietofore, with a partial and contracted svstem ofits
own     We can increase the ability, and stimulate the energy of
the St ites m a manner wor hy of statesmen    We ought to do
it, bedividinii among them nnually the nett proceeds ofthe <=ales
ol the public lands, and aligning to each a share m pi oportion to
itsfcdeial population   That, sir is my plan and which I hope to
see «substituted in the place of all farthei attempts to construct
loals by {'licit appiopnations    Dothat and you wiUfind that
toe ¡states, will ex( end the money more economically dnd ad
vatitageoiisly har you can    You will peleelve, likewise that,
i( it is done th- [ pople will lequne then repiesentatives to

fund instead of squandering it for the conupt puiposeofpui
eimmg the support of votéis in behalf of aspu'ng politicians,
who seek offices fiom the lushest to the lowebt, by flattenm*
and promoting selfish and sectional interests   instead tfmani
festing those high moral and intellectual qualities which ajone
can digmfyandadorn oihcial station, and make men capable of

support the General Goveinmentby a discriminating tariff, hav
mg m view the iai mgof no mor  ie venue than is neces?aiy to
sustain the Govemment, econom cally admmistered, and atthe
game tune, the protection cf those branches of domestic manu
factuie essential to our independence
I will now pioceed to notice the arguments advanced m the
course oí the debate in opposition to my proposition    The
gentleman fiom  \iigmia,  chairman of the   tommitbe on
Roads and Canals [Mi Mercer ] gave us abnef outline of the
system  by which he was, and the House ought to be governed
m making appropnatims foi ínterin! iiíipio\eiiPnt«    By his
system three thingb aie required    fii&t  a survey by a com
petent engineei , second, an estimate of the co f of thepioposed
work and a íppoií, and lastly the action of Congiess upon,
the informa ion thus aiquued through tie appropriate com
mutees     Now e^i   this i&  all  very well   but the gentleman
washimselt coi   i anted to ack lovvie ge that Congre^ would
