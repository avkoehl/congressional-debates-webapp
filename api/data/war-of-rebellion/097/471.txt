Bvt. Major General G. MOTT,

Commanding Third Division:

General Miles has been ordered to move down the White Oak road at once to General Sheridan. You will draw McAllister and De Trobiand at once into line held by you to-day, and extend De Trobiand in single rank along the line held by Miles to-day as far as possible. Miles will notify De Trobiand the moment the brigade connecting with De Trobiand begins to draw off. Miles' pickets and yours will remain as they now are until just before daylight, when they will both withdraw to the picket-line they held to-day. You will then hold all your command ready for the results of the assault at 4 this morning.
