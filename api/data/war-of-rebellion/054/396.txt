their movements. All is quiet at the ford above; One hundred and twenty-ninth in good position. While the One hundred and

twenty-ninth Ohio were taking their position, the enemy opened on them from opposite side of the river. They were answered by the One hundred and twenty-ninth and silenced. The enemy have one regiment and two pieces of artillery. The foregoing is from good authority.

Colonel Lemert, commanding Cumberland Gap, reports a handsome success by the Sixteenth Illinois Cavalry at Jonesville. The rebels were commanded by Colonel Slemp, 350 strong. The Sixteenth Illinois, with about 250 charged them at once' killed 20 and wounded a large number. Captured 26 prisoners and 100 stand of arms. Major Beeres pursued them 3 miles beyond Jonesville; completely whipped and scattered them in every direction, and destroyed their train.

Brigadier-General.

ONE AND A HALF MILES FROM WALKER'S FORD, December 3, 1863-8 a.m.

The North Carolina regiment that remained across the river last night, sent out scouts during the night who reported that the enemy were retiring toward Knoxville; none are visible in our front this morning. I hear nothing from them at the lower fords, and have ordered a regiment of cavalry across the river and will try and find out what has become of them. Patterson's battery of Napoleon guns, that did such good work yesterday, is reported immovable on account of the condition of the horses for want of forage. Two of the horses died yesterday. I don't know what we can do unless your order down then spans of horses from the First Tennessee Battery at the gap, which would give Patterson's battery 8 horses to a team. The harness must accompany the horses.

Very respectfully,

O. B. WILLCOX,

Brigadier-General.

GENERAL: I have just received the following dispatch from Colonel Graham:

Colonel Capron, 5 miles from the river, reports the enemy 5 miles in the advance still retreating.

He does not state the direction, but I suppose toward Knoxville.

Very respectfully, yours,
