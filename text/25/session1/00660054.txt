CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
sident is * nativ e of our State, he will lescmd that
circular, a 11 do s> d m his pow er to sustain its cre-
dit, they eSdia mul, when he w as sworn into office,
" Now is the \ nter ot our discontent made
glorious summer by the son of Yoik," but they
were disappointed He would not attach any
blame to the President, he might have had reasons,
satisfactory to himselt, for the part he acted, and
he would not condemn him.
Mr. T. adverted to the panic m 1834, which he
thought imaginary, but whether the dangers were
imaginary or real, the same evils would have
resulted, had not the Legislatuie of his State
loaned her credit to sustain confidence, and pre-
vent a suspension of specie payments Such was
the effect oí this loan, that it restored immediate
confidence, and it was ne\ er found necessary to
use a single dollar of the sit million proffered
It was his firm belief, that if confidence had
been preserved, the suspension would nev er have
taken place The banks had been charged with
stopping for sinister purposes, but he spoke from
his own knowledge, when he affirmed that they
held out as long as they could It was the alarm
of the depositers that had caused the suspension,
and not the run of bill holders He was far from
supposing that they had acted tieacherously If
conh Vnce were lestoied, he believed them as ca-
pable as ever of performing their duties to the
Government and the people.
He would say, in reierence to this divoice be-
tween the Banks and the State, that the phrase had
been gotten up by designing and wary politicians
He knew that it was a phrase calculated to find
favor with the mass of the people, but they had
adopted it without looking at its consequences,
without sufficient reflection and consideiation It
behooved wise and discreet statesmen, however, to
take care and look thoroughly into the scheme
before they adopted it. He contended that this
Sub-Treasury scheme struck at the very founda-
tion of om whole cicdit system, and the prosperity
of the country A separations of the concerns of
the Government ftom those of the people would be
fraught with more mischief than could be brought
about by the adoption of any other measure having
reference to the finances of the country and
all its most vital interests It was in vain
to tell him that if the bill under consideration
should become a law of the land, it would not
create two cunencies Ho would insist that the
effeet of it would be to establish one currency foi
the Government and another for the people, the
better one, however, for the servants of the people
and the worst foi the people There was no ts'
cape from this position The effect of the measmc
would be to prevent the people from having a bet-
ter currency than they now had, and to isolate
them from the Government Instead of makm 
the public officers a poition of the peop'e they
were made their masteis He considered that theie
was great force m the aigument of the gentleman
from Virginia, (Mr Rives,) that the consequence
oi a creation ot a better currency for the officers
would be to increase then salaries to the amount
of ten or twelve per cent, so that, m tact, thej
would be receiving that much more money than
they were by law entitled to
Mr. T. went on to argue that the amendment
offered by the gentleman fiom South Caiolina
would be productive of a great many evils and
which lit thought no man could well overlook
To say tint the. notes of specie paying banks shall
be received in the payment of the public dues
was the same thing as saj ing that nothing but gold
and silver shall be so received Why? Because
the very moicit 'h >se notes are thus received th<y
are presented at tno banks by the people, who'may
live in the neighborhood, for the specie, and the
consequence of which was, that it would be with-
drawn from the v aults of the banks and put into
the Sub-Treasurv He insisted, then, that it would
be better at on-e to say that nothing but gold and
silver should be. íeceiv ed, for (hat was really the
practical effeet ot the measure Let there be no
delusion on the subject, let it be understood by
every gentleman, and let it be understood by the
communitv, that it was better for (he banks better
for every one, that all the dues of the Government
should be paid m gold and silver    There w as no
half way about the matter, it was bettei to go on
thin to turn luck
He allied that one ot the consequent e  ot the
measure would be to cripple the banks, iO pi event
them from furmshi ^g that cunency which they
otherwise would do " Preseiveand legu'ate, hut
not destroy" was his motio The moment the
scheme should go into effect, lhat moment you
crippled the banks m such a mannei as to prevent
them from affoidmg these facilities to the busi-
ness portion of the community, which they had
been in the habit of receiving
Mr T noticed many of the remail s of the Sena-
tor from North Carolina, (Mr Strange,) and íe-
phed to them He said he could not agree with
that Senator that no warfare had been earned on
against the banks He bel e\ ed that the effect of
this measure was making war upon those institu-
tions He, how ever, knew that it was far from
the President's intention, and that of many distin-
guished gentlemen, to break down tne banking in-
terest of the country, though such was the effect of
the present bill He aigued that it was impossi-
ble to establ sh an entile specie cuirency m the
country, and even it it were not, commercially
connected as we now weie with Great Britain, the
adoption of such a currency would be greatly dis-
advantageous, inasmuch as w e ought to have an
eye to the kind of currency in England, and so act
as not to give her an oppoitumty of profiting hy
our financial arrangements
He conlcnded that the banks in New York and
elsewhere could not resume specie payments if the
bill should be passed,without bunging about the most
disastrous results The moment the banks resum-
ed payments their vaults would be diained, and
they would be compelled to stop again "With re-
gard to the exercise of Executive pationage in re-
ference to tins bill, he could apprehend no abuse of
it, he confessed, on the part of the present Chief
Magistiate, whom he had 1 nown fiom his car'iest
manhood to hive w ilUed with n the bounds of stuct
constitutional limits Cut, as we were now legis-
lating toi the futuie, it became us to be careful
that we did not tuist too much power to the pre-
siding officer, w ho might happen to be a man of
great ambition, and wno would not hesitate to use
the power vested m him m i manner pie|udic>al to
the best interests of the country, and which might
result in the complete overthrow of the Govern-
ment
Mr T having touched upon a gieat variety of
other topics, concluded by saying 1 look forward
to the adoption of th s measure with the most pain-
ful forebodings,< n , should it become a law, I shall
be happy if the conntr nd its instilntions aie not
involved in one general calamitv
Mr STfUNCrEI oileied a lev explanatory le-
marks m tefuence to unit he hid said yesterday,
for the purpose of confiding some unintentional
misrepresentations which the Senatoi from New
Yoik (Mr Tallmadge) had made
Mr TALLMADGE replied, that nothing was
f" ther from his intention than to misrepresent the
gentleman, and if he hod misapprehended him, he
legictted it, and stood conected
[At this point of ihc discussion a message was
received fr >m the Present of the Unite 1 States,
by Maj i Van Curen, his private sscietary, which
was laid on (he table ]
Mr C YLHOUN lo^e and made some observa-
tions in i elation to the two measi res now before
the Senate He conlcnded that it would have to
choose oeuv < en them If h« understood the plan
of the Senatoi ñon Vil,, na, (Mr Rives) he sail,
there appeared  to h m to be an insuperable objec-
tion to its adoptirn He piopo  d to receive the
notes o all b inks m dischuge of the pulmc d íes,
provided they shad re me specie p?v men ts bv a
given day in the ' cai 18„\? at 1 all tnose banks
which shall not resu Dy that period, shall be
excluded Now, a incst sc ous question was pre-
sented for the decision of this bod) We w ere
by this proportion, about to make a compact with
the banks It was an offei, an inducement held
out, to them to comp'y witn a certain requisition
and, if they should ac„ept it, it would constitute an
unlimited compact between them and the Govern-
ment. The effect of the proposition was, to en-
done the credit of me Government for evei upon
the notes of such banks as resumed specie pay-
ments by a certain time He would ask the gen-
tleman from Vugima, himself, whether he was
willing to enter into such a compact It could not
be misconstrued We were dealing with corpoia-
tions, some of which were great and pow crful, and
we must be on our guard What was the argu-
ment advanced here only the othei day Why,
that the deposite act constituted a compact between
us and the banks. He howevei, did not thmk
so But, even if it were, then how irresistible w as
the conclusion that ihe bill involved a perpetual
compact with the banks A consideration must be
given m order to make a compact, and m this in-
stance, a great sacrifice would have to be made
The Government was now holding it out, and w hen
once made, honor, justice, every thing, demanded
that it should be faithfully and religiously complied
with on our part Mr C proceeded to aigue that
the benefit of this compact would be enjoyed only
by the large banks, which would comb ne together
to obtain the prize held out to them, and to put
down the little banks In fact, the bill of the ho-
norable Senator was, in effect, nothing more nor
less than an offei to the Pennsylvania Bank of the
United Stales to come forward and fulfil the condi-
tion Now, lhat bank had the means of doing it,
and this would be an inducement to it In order
to comply with the offer, it would be worth w hile
for that institution to make a great sacrifice, ay, a
sacrifice of millions' It has strong and powerful
connections, not only m this country, but in
Europe also, who would rally to its aid, and
enable it to accomplish its objects, to resume
specie payments, and to put dovv n feebler insti-
tutions Supposing that the bank should com-
ply with the offer made by this bill, what would
be our condition? Why, in my opinion, it would
be the worst that could possibly be imagined We
should then have a bank of the United States, in
the most objectionable foim—in a local form, and
combined with other ban' s He would regard
such a consequence as going far to destroy the
hbeities of the country, and it would cieate great
discontent and heart burnings among the people
It seemed to him impossible that gentlemen would
prefer the Senatoi's proposition to his
He was averse to using coercion towards the
banks, to compel them to resume specie payments,
for the consequence would be, to pioduce difficul-
ties as great as those which had aheady taken
place The resumption of specie payments must
be the work of tune, and after the payment of our
debts
Mr C replied to the objections urged by Mi
Rives to his proposition, in reference to its having
the effect of creating two cunencies, one of papei
and the other of specie He then asked w hat sort
of a currency we had now'' Was not the whole
country flooded with cuirencies of all kinds, with
shin-plasters of allsoits, sizes, and •.'lapes1 Nothing
could pcssibly be woise He said laat the propo-
sition of the Senatoi from Vnguua involved a de-
parture from the pr nciples that gentleman con-
tended for, and argued as being lost sight of m his
(Mr CM own proposition The principle of
equality was not observed m it, and the conse-
quence w ould follow that tne people w ould be com-
pelled to receive one description of note , and the
Government anothei The large notes weie foi
the rich, and the small notes for the poor Vr C
adverted to his own scheme, and added that h" en-
tei tamed very great cioubt whether the Government
could receive in the pavment of its dues anv thing
but gold and silv er, and notes issued on its ow n
credit He remained that he had no confidence m
the scheme of the Senator from Virginia, because
he regarded it as inefficient He concluded by
ansivcrmg some of the objections mj;ed against the
Sub-Tieasmy scheme Ho maintained that the
notes which would be issued w ould not produce
an> thing like the evils ansmg from the existence
of so much paper as was now afloat, issued hy an
immense number of hanks
Mi RIVES said was it not extt? ordinary that
the honorable Senator should have made the obser-
vations he had in regard to the chaiacter of the
proposition which he (Mr H.) had brought foi -
ward, when he himself had introduced a plan
which was m direct opposition to, and m the veiy
