The question was then taken on Mr King's
motion, and the blank filled with 200 feet.
Mr LINN moved to amend the bill by extend-
ing its operations to the Territories, which was
agreed to, and
The bill was then ordered to be engrossed for a
third reading
NEOSHO TERRITORY
The Senate resumed the consideration of the
bill to i rovide for the security and protection of the
emigrant and other Indians, west of the Stales of
Missouri and Arkansas, the question being on the
amendment proposed by Mr Kino to set apart the
territory of the United States ruorth of the Missouri
and west of the Mississippi, to which the Indict
title has been extinguished, for the northern Indian!*
Mr LUMPKIN addiessed the Senate as fol-
lows
Air Pju.sidi.nt When I consider the magnitude
of this question, m all us various bearings, and
how deeply it concerns the honor and character of
this Government, I can but approach it under a
due sense of the responsibility which devolves on
mc. I regret that the consideration and progress
of this verj important measure should be embar-
rassed by the proposed amendment of (he honora-
ble Senator from Alabama—an appendage calcu-
lated, in my judgment, if sustained, to defeat the
original measure itself This amendment, in con-
nection with the remarks made in its support, which
have fallen from several honorable Senators, gives
to the proposition a sectional character, which can-
not fai', it the amendment be incorpoiated in the
bill, to defeat the whole measure. I represent a
poition of the Southern pcopie who have as deep
an interest m sectional questions as any other poi-
tion of this Union—a people who well understand
their political rights—a people who will never de-
mand mort, or be satisfied v. ith less, than their equal
andjustnghts M\ lift, my interest, and my feel-
ings, are ic'entificd vuth the people whom I repre-
sent My obligations to watch o\ e¡, protect, and
defend, that portion of their interest confided to my
care on this floor, can never be forgotten by me
foi a moment No, sir my obligations to the peo-
ple of Georgia ate peculiarly strong. But I am
not to be frightened or alarmed from the pathway
of duty by the cry of Southern rights, when there
i& no ground for that alarm, and when that sec-
tional interest is unnecessarily introduced in a «ay
calculated to defeat a favorite measure, which I
have tor many years past labored to consummate
The bill upon your table for the organization of
the IndianTti it ry and Government west, in its
first section, defines the Territory designed to be-
come the scene of Indian reform This Ternteiy
embiaces a country of about six hundred miles by
two hundred, and may be stated to embrace a sur-
face of 76,800,000 acres of land The population
now sealed, and intended to be settled, on this sui-
face, is estimated at 133 883, of which number
about 75,000 are already located in the country
The terutoiy embjaced in the bill is directly
west and noithwest ot the States of Aikansas and
Missouri, and from north to south extends over
eight or ten degrees of latitude, the highest north
ern point being 43° north
This, un, is an acevtate description of the coun-
try embraced in tnc bill, according to the map
which I now hold in my hand, and which is said to
be a near approach to accuracy
Thus it will be seen, from the evidence here pre-
sented, that more than two thirds of the Territory
designated in this bill is north of latitud  364—
the Compromise line agreed upon at the time
the agitation and discussion took place in Con-
gress upon the question cf the admission of the
State of Missouri into the Union It is true that I
never approved of that compromise, but so it is,
that it has heretofore been acquiesced m as a set-
tled compromise, and for one, I am averse to
disturbing and agtia'mg that question at this time,
and upon this occasion The South has no just ,
ciwe of complaint in regard to the location of the
Indians, from which she will be finally and forever
relieved by ihe provisions of this bill Thelndians
who have emigrated, and will emigrate from all the
Southern States, will be located something north of
their former places of abode, and from the provi-
CONGRESSIONAL GÍÓSÉ.
sions of this bill, it is not proposed to locate a soli-
tary tribe of the Indians from any one of the North
and Northwestern States south of 364 ot noith la-
titude
And what is the proposition of my honorable
friend from Alabama [Mr King ] Why, sir, he
proposes to add to the Territory designated m the
bill, all the Northwestern domain of the United
States, to which the Indian title has not heretofore
been extinguished, and which is not embraced in
any of the present States and Territories of the
United States. A countrv undefined in extent,
and thought by some gentlemen to embrace a
country containing a larger suiface than one-half
of the organized Mates ot this Union
Sir, my high respect for the intelligence, and my
confidence m the purity of the motives, of the
mover of this amendment, [Mr Kil>o,] would
leave me in surprise, but for the assuianee which I
feel that the enor into which my friend has fallen
on this subject, is chargeable alone to his not
having duly examined and considere 1 the measure
now under consideration. Who can seriously
expect to succetd m the oigamzation of a Territo-
rial Government for the emigrating and half civi-
lized Indians, when the territory embraced in that
Government spreads over a country so vast in
extent, and a great portion of it populated by
savage and wild men, who have had little
intercourse with civilized man ' More->ver,
sir, the Indians who inhabit the country pro-
posed to be added by the amendment, are wholly
incapable and unprepared to avail themselves of
the benefits extended to the more enlightened tribes
by the provisions of this bill The adoption of
the proposed amendment cannot fail to destroy
every reasonable prospect of accomplishing the
beneficent and kind objects designed by its friends
for the benefit of those tribes which have been
removed from the several States and located in the
West It would lender the bill an inefficient and
useless measure, and change the entile prospect of
benefiting those upon whom it is designed to operate
I regret found the honorable Senator from South
C irolina, [Mr Calhoun,] withholding his support
from this impoitant measure, and advocating the
pioposed amendment offered by the gentkman
from Alabama I feel assmed, that if the Senator
from South Caiolina had brought his gigantic
mind to bear upon this dpeply interesting subject,
he would have been prepaied to give it his support
I am justified in this conclusion, from the fact, that
Ihe veiy pian, in all its most important bearings,
embraced in this bill, was in the year 182j the fa-
vorite policy of that Senator He at that time, as
Secretary of War, made an able and lucid report
upon this subject, w hich to) be seen in the volume
of State papers now open befoie me, and which
substantially, to my mind, recommends every im-
portant itature embraced in this bill. The very
tribes embraced in the bill, as well as the territory,
together with an entire change of Indian policy ap-
pioaclung the provisions of this bill, are recom-
mended in the report of the honorable Senator to
which I reff r And yet, he now desires more time,
to reflect and make up his mind on this impoitant
measuic, and seems not to be even acquainted
with the provisions of the bill on your table
A slight examination of the bill must at once
remove most of the objections suggested by the Se-
nator The bill forces nothing upon the Indian
tribes who are intended to be benefited by its provi-
sions Each tribe will still be left free to make
its own laws and regulations, for the government
of its own people within its respective limits
Tne Confederacy proposed to the different tribes
may be enteied into or not, at their own pleasure
It is true that most of the tribes who have emigra-
ted to the West, have been consulted on the sub-
ject of the contemplated organization and foim of
Government which is the subject of our present
consideration, and have expiessed their opinions in
favor of the measure It is also true that several
of the largest and most enlightened tribes have not
jet expressed a formal opinion on the subject, and
it is known that many of their leading men have
expressed opinions adverse to this measure It is
therefore a subject still open for investigation and
consideration, and I indulge the belief that proper
§45
investigation cannot fail to counteract the opinions
of the few selfish and leading men amongst the In-
dian tribes, who have been disposed to create oppo-
sition to the policy of the Government in regard to
this matter.
I regret that this bill has not received a greater
share of the attention of honorable Senators, who
have manifested opposition to the measure. In the
opening discussion, it was ably supported by the
Senator from Indiana, [Mr. Tipton,] m a speech
chiefly composed of facts and figures In that
speech most of the material historical facts neces-
sary to the support of this measure, together with a
considerable collection of statistical information,
was laid before the Senate m a condensed form,
which placed within the i each of every Senator the
means of correct information, without the toil and
research which it must have cost the Senator who
had the honor to submit it for the information of
others
This bill advances one more step towards the
consummation of a most important object, which
has long engrossed the minds and exertions of som"
few individuals, scattered through a long course of
years, whose knowledge or ihe true character and
condition of the native American race had awa-
kened their sympathy to a sense of the necessity of
some vigorous effort to arrest the extermination,
and total extinction, of the aboriginal race
In a retrospect of the past, we m iy with grati-
tude to a kind Providence congratulate oursehes
at the unparalleled prosperity and advancement of
our beloved country, since the first settlement of
our European fathers on this continent. Our on-
ward progress as a people is justly the admiration
of the whole civilized world Our good form of
Government, our arts, our science, our towns, our
cities, our agriculture, our commerce, our internal
improvements, and every thing else, hare sprung
up m a few hundred years
And, sir, ne have wrested this delightful land
fiom the hands of its native lords, and vhetherit
has been done by force- or fraud, the obligation
which now devolves on us to rescue and save the
remaining remnants is not altered or changed.
The allusions made by honorable Senators to my
long and untiring efforts in support ol the policy
which is now the subject of consideration, and
my being called the parent of t>is measure, I should
consider, if supported by facts, highly complimen-
tary But, sir, I have no pretensu ns to the honor
of having originated this measure General Wash-
ington was the first public man from whom I
recollect to have seen evidence, to satisfy my
mind, that he looked forward to the plan which I
now have so much solicitude to see consummated.
Mr Jefferson, Mr Madison, Mr Monroe, Mr
Calhoun, and Mr Adams, with many other en-
lightened statesmen, had given official evidence of
their approbation of the policy now under con-
sideration, before I had the honor of a position
which authotized me to move m this matter.
But, sir, it is a suoject of the highest gratification
to me to have been the first member in eithei
House of Congress to make a direct move on this
subject, and thatgiatjfication is greatly increased
by the share of success, thoug small which has at-
tended my humble efforts My first year's labor
(some ten years ago,) resulted in gettingan appropri-
ation oi $15,000, to defray theexpense of an explor-
ing expedition to the West, by competent agents of
the Government, accompanied by delegations of se-
veral tribes of thelndians then residing in the States.
That duty was performed to the satisfaction of the
Government, and ¡he report made by these ex-
ploring agents tended to remove the idle impression
that a suitable country could not be found They
not only found a country, but a most delightful
country—one among the many delightful garden
spots of America—a country possessing all the na-
tural advantages to make a people prosperous and
happy
It is true, sir, I did not stop here, that was only
my first step, and my march has been onward ever
since
I have been inclined, and have done all that I
could, to pnduce a radical change m our Indian
policy I have long since been disgusted, and «'ith
shame and confusion of faee looked at the policy
