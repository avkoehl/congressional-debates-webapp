HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,March 25, 1865.

Colonel RUGGLES:

I understood that Crawword and Ayres were already halted by General Parke's order. Do you men by the dispatch of 9.45 a. m. that they have been again set in motion by General Meade to be halted by General Parke? I should think General Meade's instruction was sent before knowing that General Parke had already halted these troops.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General Fifth Corps.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,March 25, 1865-10.40 a. m.

Major-General WARREN,

Commanding Fifth Corps:

After Crawford and Ayres had been halted I received orders from General Meade to send them forwarded again till halted by Parke. I did so, and nitrified General Parke and General Web. General Parke then asked me to halt them. I did so, and notified Generals Parke,. Webb, and Wright. Crawford and Ayres are now opposite these headquarters.

GEO. D. RUGGLES,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,March 25, 1865-11.27 a. m.

Major-General WARREN:

The major-general commanding directs that General Griffin report to General Humphreys, to support him in his attack. Crawford and Ayres will remain here until matters developed themselves.

LEX. S. WEBB,

Brevet Major-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,March 25, 1865-11.40 a. m.

Major-General WEBB,

Chief of Staff:

I have directed General Griffin to report to General Humphreys. As I have nothing here now to command I propose at once to join General Crawford and Ayres. Colonel Locke will remain here, with a portion of the staff, to give any orders to the picket-line and wagons.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-general.

P. S.-The commander of my escort has just returned from the Perkins crossing of Rowanty Creek. Enemy's pickets are on other side; found no one on this side.
