Major-General STONEMAN:

A citizen who came through from Carter's Station, having left that place last Saturday, reports that the railroad trains are all loaded and crowded with troops en route for Virginia. He reports that the enemy's artillery was insipid from the cars at Carter's Station. He saw wagon trains going on toward Virginia beyond Greeneville. He saw a force of about 2,000 infantry at Bull's Gap last Sunday. A deserter who has just arrived from Bend of Chucky reports that the enemy at that place yesterday moved from there last night, going beyond Lick Creek. He confirms the report that Martin's cavalry has started to Georgia via Paint Rock.

ISRAEL GARRARD,
