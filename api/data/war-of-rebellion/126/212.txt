from necessity some organizations have to be retrained longer than others, as order for the discharge of all at the same time cannot be given.

The attention of the commanding general of the Department of the Missouri has been invited to the discharge of the Eleventh Ohio Cavalry, specially referred to in your letter of the 27th ultimo.

I have the honor to remain, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

THOMAS M. VINCENT,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

WASHINGTON, November 6, 1865.

Major General G. G. MEADE,

Commanding Military Division of the Atlantic:

In view of the peaceful condition of the South, I think now the number of interior posts held may be materially reduced in number, and where regular troops are used they can generally be one two company posts. In this way you may be enabled to discharge from service most of the white volunteers still remaining within your command.

I wish you would send one or more of your staff officers through the Southern States of the command with full instructions to designate the posts to be held [and] the garrisons to be put in them. Let all surplus troops then be mustered out of service. Instruct your inspectors to see that all previous orders for the reduction of transportation and expenses in every way be carried out. Let them also report all public property which in their judgment may be removed or sold with advantage to the public service.

Report is many times so scattered as to make a large force necessary for performing guard duty alone, where, but for the public property to be cared for, but few troops would be necessary. Let this subject received attention also.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
