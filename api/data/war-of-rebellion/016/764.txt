Numbers 1. Report of Colonel Diwon S. Miles, Second U. S. Infantry, commanding Railroad Brigade, &c.

HARPER'S FERRY, VA., August 25, 1862.

SIR: I have the honor to inclose a report of Lieutenant Milling, of Maryland Cavalry, of the loss of 17 of his men while on picket at Smithfield, Va., on the 23rd instant.

This officer was esteemed trustworthy and attentive, and he was particularly charged to be vigilant and on the alert against surprise. His report is unsatisfactory, and he deserves signal punishment. I would advise his name to be stricken from the rolls of the army.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

D. S. MILES,

Colonel Second Infantry, Commanding.

Lieutenant Colonel WILLIAM D. WHIPPLE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
