By command of Major General J. J. Reynolds:

JOHN LEVERING,Major and Assistant Adjutant-General.

HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF WEST MISSISSIPPI,

New Orleans, La., June 21, 1864.

Brigadier General W. H. EMORY,

Commanding at Morganza, La.:

General Banks is the legal commander of the Nineteenth Corps I have recommended that another (General Reynolds) be designated by the President. The decision of the question will probably reach here soon after the expedition commences its movement, and the answer to your application somewhat earlier.

I give you these reasons for your consideration. I appreciate your fellings fully, and if you desire it I will cancel the order of leave and assign you to a command when the change can be made with less embarrassment.
