Following dispatch received:

OXFORD, October 14, 1863.

Eleven regiments of cavalry with nine pieces of artillery pursued us. We skirmished with them all the way; fought them for four hours near Byhalia and again at the river, when they were repulsed, and retired after burning Wyatt. Our loss considerable; number not known on account of much straggling. Saved our train and captured property.
