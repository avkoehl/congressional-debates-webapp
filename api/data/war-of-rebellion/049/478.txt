HEADQUARTERS SECOND CORPS,Major-General HUMPHREYS:

My parties on the road between here and Brandy Station I find are too small to do all the work, and the road will still be in bad condition at sunset. If any troops are to move very soon over that road, there should be very heavy working parties on it at once.
