1835.                                 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.                                   107
* p lates ot open enemies, our shores from hostile
' aggiceeion, or oui flag fiora insult " And, sir,
such arguments as weie used by my colleague in
leluion to what the exponte of a Navy would
effect, if applied to other purposes, go oily to
st ike tne flag of the Navv itself What better
ob]tct of reasonableexpenditure, liberal expendí
ture, can there be, than a Navy, for a country
like this' Sir, there was a time when such argu
ments availed, and such a cpiestion was asked in
doubt, but it is too late at this time of day to
decry the Navy by magnifying its expenditure,
wl en it has fought its \va) to honor, respect, and
populaiity, has become its own piacfical aigu
ment, and when, too, we aie on the very'eve of a
threatened naval wai with one of the stiongest
mautime Powers of the woild One million of
dolíais is a gieat sum, indeed, foi a country as
ncli in ícsources as this, about celehiatii g the
payment of its national debt, too, to support your
entire list of supenoi and inferior naval officers,
to contend and cope with the Navy of Trince1
Sn, my colleague did hopo that this nation
would wake up from what he calls this dream of
militaiy gloiy For my pait, sir, I nevei was
in such a drtam But, if he has been in such a
trance, to what has he awakened5 A. gun boat
system * Paidon me for saying, if the country
is to be awakened to that dieam, I hope she may
sleep on But I hope, si, that the nation will
not go to sleep, and forget that golden i ule of
national safety, " m peace to picpaie for war "
And if we do not pass this bill, and a naval wai
with a stiong maritime Powei shdl come, as it
is imminently thieatened, I trust in God thatoui
seamen may not have to viake up in foreign dun
geons and puson ships, fioma dieam of national
glo-iy once won by youi Nwy, to scenes of naval
defeat and national moitification and humiliation,
caused by weakn ss in this ' light aim of oui
defense," foi the want of a oountiful nourish
ment, to be charged in pait to a false economy,
and in pait to a still existing enmity to oui
isavy, which I had thought was obsolete, and
which I pray may now be defeated and buneu
forevei
Sir, my colleague objects to the reason  as
signed   by the bccietary of the  INavy for this
ine ease of pay     Seeming to forget what  the
Secretary  says about   the   compensation  being
inadequate " foi an honorable dischaige of duty,"
the gentleman looics only to the íeason of ena
bling our captains to compete in extravagance
with the admirals of other nations while on foi
eign stations     No, sn, although the admirals of
foieign ships will not at piesent íeturn gun for gun
to your salutes—and if ever one of oui captains
returns an unequal salute, I will do all in my
power to have him bioke—all your Is avy asks of
the people is, as tar as is consistent with repub
hean simplicity and cconomv, to v due and puze
the 'aboi, gallantly, and blood of American offi
cera and seamen as high as that of jaercenaiy
hirelings  is  pnzed   by monaichs ana   despots
My colleague asks what effect this mciease of
pay  will  have  upon   oui   officeis   themselves?
buange question1    Why, sn, it will neive   it
will sticngthen, it wi'l biace,it will inspire them
with  new  couiage1    It  will assuie them  they

The nominal pay of the English navy is like that
of our Army, mucn less than the real, which is
right hard to get at     Besides fifty per cent  in
allowances, then  pay is enormous in piovisions

are now to be benefited by this muease of pay,

And I do not fear to pledge myself, that of

My colleag le lastly attacked, as he attacked
everything m this bill, the last—the thiee per
cent clause Sn, my othei colleague fiom Vn
gima, [Mi M\sox,] on aio'her occisión, the
other day, said every tin lg which could o, cm
be said 11 defense of this featuie of the bill and
I will only idd inv dccki ition to his, lesu'tmg
conc'usive'y fiom his explaiation and aigu ncnt,
tl at theie is not the semblance ot a pen ion s/s
ten in this piovision As the offictis themselves
desne it, and it will be a fund pioceeding fiom
their own pay, to which tne attnbute and sane
tion of law meuly wi 1 be aided, I do not ob]cct
to it, though I do as stiongly as any object to a
pension system
Having followed to the end of the chaptei the
objections of my colleague to this bill, I beg
leave to offel some li-comniuidatio is o it which
he did not touch and at the same time to ai sv ei
some objections made Ly the gentleman lion
Aevv York, [Mi   Mvw ]
This bill abolishes tl e sys'em of ex n paj for
special sei vices, and the system of ahowaices,
leaving a few, in ceitain cases necessary, but
heiem specific This at once dcpnves the "Navy
Dcpaittient of that odious power of imposition
m some cases, and of favont smin otheis, which,
1 am ciedibly informed, has been too often giesslv
and conuptly abused Thcie ,s i othmg moic
impoitant, in my estimation, Mi   Speaker, than
so to fix and establish bylaw the pay and the du-
t es of youi Army and Navy, as to effectually
deprive the Executive Departments of all unne-
cessary contiol over eithei Under the piesent
syHem. of allowances by i egulation, maintained in no
other w ay than by the shamefully large and neg-
ligent appropintions by Congress to contingen-
cia, the Executive contiol and power of patronage
ovei the Aimyand Navy is increased without
limit, and without lesponsibihty Both Army
and Navy aie perfectly at the will and mercy of
the Executive, uc made to feel constantly the
powei ot that branch of tht Government by the
pui se sti mgs and by i emov al, and have long since
ceased to feci any dependence whatever upon
Congiess                                   
Sn, I 1 aveo^ten heaid the truth,and perfectly
accoid with it, that the libfitics of no people
weie ovei dc tnyed by a militaiy leadei until
coiiuption had fiist cankered the vitals of the
State, and thus by debilitating the whole sys
torn, made it an easy piey foi nihtnry despotism
And I will aJd, with íespsct to the futuie des-
tinies of th s ccuntry, that its liberties will for-
ever be prtseived inviolate, as long as the íepie-
sen tali ves of llie people and the officii s ofthe Jlrmy
and J\aoy of tin United States aie kept puie,
enli^hl ned, vu uous, md patnotic, and they will
eiei be so, as Ion* as th°y aie kept tndcpendenl anil
jiee f om the i ijlucncc of the Tedcial Executive, and
no longei I do, theiefoio, feivently desne this
House to adopt the wise policy of making out
whole militaiy establishment feel that it is paid,
and hbenlly paid, by the i epi esentatwes of the peo-
ple and then I fiimly believe, if we ourselves are
true, and we continue tl is policy, theic never can
be dangci fiom a bnbed and conupt soldiery,
su tuned, as well as appointed bj executivefavoi
Nothing ctn be nunc dispniting to the biaveand
pioud com nandcrs of youi fleets and ainues,
than tne necessity of a * cling and "coinfíiig""
foi tic i lights but as suie as " man is man,"
wheie ' thuft follows fiwnmg," the spintofthe
p oudest aid biavest will fly to their necessities,
niid a couit le^eai veill
" f roo   t] e pieirnant binges of the knee"
to powei yielding places I consider that this
bill protects the service fiom abuses, and its
officeis from temptation and dependence, by
filing unequ vocally by law an adequ ite compen-
sation, fauly distubuted amongst the different
giades But 'h s, it s ems the gentleman fiom
New York would especially avoid He laid
down upon tins point the most licentious rule of
fa'se economy and fiaudulent ndicahsm I ever
heard " The mtciest of the agent,' he says,
" is always opposed to that of his pnncipil, and
there nevei will be dangei that our p iblic sen ants
mil noih foi nothing Then uants itill sharpen
their icils "
Now, sir, in the name of common honesty,
what does this m an? In pi un English, it is
nothing more oi less than that he would pay pooi ly
end ledie the íesí to pillaging This is his policy,
and Heaven toibid it' ihe allowance, the extia
pa) , "nil the poor "nd pillagingpty system, costs

wl ich tiovidcs that no money shall be diawn

Put the most intoltitb'c oí all positions yet
as unied by any one against this proposed ln-
ch tst of ¡Navy pay, is that by the gentleman
fiom New Yoik—tne pn e money which officers
