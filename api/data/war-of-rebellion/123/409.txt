THOMAS A. SCOTT, Esq.,

Philadelphia:

The urgent exigency requires that all the railroad power and brains should be devoted exclusively for the transportation of troops this week. Will you be so good as to give it your attention?

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

HARTFORD, CONN., August 19, 1862.

SECRETARY OF WAR:

General Buckingham's dispatch reached me at Norwich at 11 o"clock last evening. The five regiments Connecticut volunteers full, and they will be all mustered in this week. The Eighteenth Regiment will leave Norwich on Thursday night, and the others will follow as fast as transportation can be obtained. Governor Buckingham insists that the U. S. bounty shall be paid before the regiments leave. If the money can be remitted in New York checks this week I can get money for the mustering officer and go on paying to- morrow. The State, Government, and town bounties are creating unavoidable delay in getting off the regiments.
