 [CHAP. XLII.
IN THE FIELD, ONE-FOURTH MILE EAST OF TUNNEL,

August 17, 1863.

Major-General THOMAS:

The infantry, excepting train guard, reached this point at dark last evening. The train was halted and encamped at the foot of the mountain. Cowan side of the road is very rough and slippery. We anticipate delay and severe labor in getting trains over. Colonel Stanley leaves one regiment at Cowan and marches this morning with the other. Two of his regiments are at Tantalon and Anderson. If you start late your train cannot reach this point, which is the first small camping ground.

I have the honor to remain, yours, very truly,

JAS. S. NEGLEY,

Major-General.
HDQRS. THIRD DIVISION, FOURTEENTH ARMY CORPS,Featherston's Plantation, August 17, 1863.

Lieutenant Colonel GEORGE E. FLYNT,

Asst. Adjt. General and Chief of Staff, 14th Army Corps:

COLONEL: I have the honor to report that I am in camp with my division at the base of the mountain. It was impossible for me to proceed farther to-day, owing to the delay occasioned by the train of the Fourth Division in ascending.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. M. BRANNAN,

Brigadier-General, Commanding Division.

King's brigade, except one regiment with division headquarters and train, is close to him. I will move on to Sweeden's Cove early to-morrow morning. Brannan's division will to-morrow night occupy my present camp. Wilder's brigade has gone to Tracy City; will be there this evening. No train up this railroad yet.
