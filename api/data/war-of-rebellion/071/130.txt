Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

Imboden, with his command of 2,000 cavalry, entered Hagerstown this morning via Cherry Run, where it is said they crossed. I invite your attention to my dispatch of last evening in regard to mustering in by companies.

Major-General.

WAR DEPARTMENT, July 8, 1864. (Received 10. 05 a. m.)

Major-General COUCH,

Harrisburg:

The 100-days' men are called for immediate service. Until organized in regiments they are of no use whatever. When organized they can be mustered in an hour, whereas to muster in by companies only wastes time and increases expense, with no conceivable useful purpose. The Western Governors organized 60,000 men in two weeks, in accordance with the prescribed regulation. Governor Curtin has been considered to be as able and skillful as other Governors in organizing troops for efficient service, and unless his influence and efficiency are impaired, he will find no difficulty in accomplishing what Governors Brough, Morton, Yates, Stone, and Lewis accomplished. It is true they had the advantage of a good staff, and the aid of United States officers, who understood the importance of conforming to a regulation on which the good of the service depended, and preferred to conform to it rather than to break it down. It may be that Governor Curtin is not so well aided by his staff, but I think you can help him as much as Heitzelman and Pope did the Western Governors. If you do so it is believed that Governor, on reflection, will see that the only way in which the 100-days' men can be useful is to organize the regiments as fast as ten companies are organized, and have them mustered in, and that he will thus save himself trouble, and serve his State and the General Government better than in any other mode. If his staff is incompetent he can readily change it, and make it as good as Brough's or Morton's, and there will then be prompt accordance with all regulations.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.
