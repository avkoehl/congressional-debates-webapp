tuieof fifteen millions of dollars from unexpend-
ed balances of appropriations, and to require the
execution of the deposite lav/ of June, 1836.
Inasmuch as the report of the Secretary of the
Treasury, made to the House of Representatives
on the 14th day of September, 1837, states the fact,
that on that day there remained of unexpended ba-
lances of appropriations of the past anl present
years, the .sum of twenty-four millions seventy-Jive
thousand two hundred and thirty-nine dollars thirty-
seven cents, and that fifteen millions of dolían would
not be required during the present year of said sum
for public'uses:
1. Be it therefore enacted, That the Secretary of
the Treasury be, and he is hereby, required to sus-
pend the expenditure of fifteen millions of dollars
of the unexpended balances of appropriations of the
past and present years, and that said sum be placed
in the Treasury for the purpose and use of the Go-
vernment.
Sec. 8. And te itfurtker enacted, That the Secre-
tary of the Treasury be, and he is hereby authorized
to suspend the said sum of fifteen millions from such
of said unexpended appropriations which in his
judgment shall least aflect the public interest
Sec. 3. Jind be itfurlhtr enacted, That the Se-
cretary of the Treasury be, and he is hereby, re-
quired to carry fully into execution the deposite
ast of June, 1836; and that all laws contravening
the provisions of this act be repealed so far, and no
farther.
Mr. DAWSON withdrew his amendment.
Mr. BELL, who was entitled to the floor, ad-
dressed the committee at length in opposition to the
bill under consideration; and, in the course of his
remarks, alluded to the Sub-Treasury scheme,
which he pronounced m be, disguised as it might
be, nothing more nor less than a plan for a Trea-
sury bank. After another year, the plan would •
assume a more definite and palpable shape; but he
refrained from going at length into that subject
till the bill proposing to carry out thatschome came
up.
Mr. B. then took a review of the different ap-
propriations made at the last session, and from
them deduced an argument that there was money
enough remaining to pay the fourth instalment, by
showing that there might be, without any detriment
to the public interest, from five to eight millions
suspended from the public expenditures.
Mr. McKIM said he had prepared a statement
of the condition of the Treasury fiom  the official
report  of   the  Secretary   of   tin:  Treasury;   and
though the  mode he had adopted was somewhat
different from that adopted by die honorable chair-
man of the Committee of Ways and Means, still
they both arrived at the same result, from which
¡statement it would  b« t.een that  there would be a
deficit of upwards of five millions of dollars.
Whole amount of available money
in the Treasury on the 1st Janu-
ary, 1837, applicable  to public
purposes, was                             $42,468,859 97

mated that the whole amount of

Leaving no money in the  Mint or Treasury to
meet contingencies, on the 31st December, 1837.
Whatever expenditures shall arise within the
year, upon new appropriations which Congress
may think proper to make, will require a corre-
sponding addition to this amount; but without
them, it will constitute an excess of $5,363,322 33
of expenditures oyer both the receipts and the
balance at the commencement of the year; besides
not leaving, at the close of it, any thing in the
Mint or the Treasury, for future uses or to meet
contingencies.

Mr. WRIGHT suggested some modifications of
the amendment, which were accepted; so that it now
reads as follows;
Sec. And be it further enacted, That from and after
the first day of January, eighteen hundred and thirty-
eight, three-fourths of the amount due to the Gof em-
inent,forduties, taxes, sales of public land', or other

Mr. NILES rose and spoke at great length; his
speech embracing answers to the views of Mr.
Rives and others in relation to the causes of dis-
tress, the means of relief, &c. One party, he said,
and that a very respectable one, were of opinion
that a national bank was the only panacea, the
" sovereignest thing" on the earth for the wound,
while others supposed that by extending confidence
to the State institutions, we should derive the like
result; but in his humble opinion, neither were to
be trusted. Both had been weighed in the balance
and found wanting: they had abused their trusts,
and proved false to the Government and the peo-
ple.   Mr.  N. acknowledged himself a hard money
