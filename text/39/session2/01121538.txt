THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
February 25,
to deal with mighty problems in finance and
taxation, and with the practicalities incident to
the towering demands of a great indebtedness.
The nation must have money and it should get
it with as little distress to the people as possi-
ble. It should come from those sources least
likely to affect the comfort and happiness of
the people, who are called upon and must
respond to the requirements of the national
Treasury.
In executing this demand the Government
encounters the craft of the wary, the ingenuity
of the avaricious, and the duplicity and unfaith-
fulness of its ministers. Wearily it plods on,
no way discouraged at the difficulties that sur-
round its path, confident of its ability to enforce
its demands, and resting on the knowledge of
the boundless resources of the nation to collect
all its revenue and maintain unimpaired its
plighted faith.
The early laws of the United States com-
bined the capacity system and the measure-
ment of the product, and though the returns
are said to be far below the real amounts, we
find there were reported for the year 1791-92,
from foreign materials, 290 distilleries, with a
capacity of 204,9421 gallons ; from domestic
materials, 2,289 distilleries, with a capacity of
174,249J gallons; and 50 to which no capacity
is given, but the aggregate capacity amounts
to 385,834 gallons.
From these were returned, as distilled from
foreign materials, 4,207.572 gallons; from do-
mestic materials, 903,992 gallons : giving a
total of 5,171.504 gallons.
In 1795-90 there were distilled in cities,
towns, and villages from foreign materials,
2,211,134| gallons; from domestic materials,
85,214} gallons; in the country, 1,009,797J
gallons; giving an aggregate of 3,300,140.}
gallons. The tax collected upon this was
$424,189, being at the average rate of a frac-
tion over twelve and a half cents per gallon.
There was then, as now, a drawback al-
lowed for exportation, which for that year was
882,820; to which add for leakage $4,'641, and
for abatement in the county $1,249, for prompt
payment $114, and there was left of available
tax, $418,183.

pacity and upward in cities and villages re-

domestic materials for the year ending—

In 1800 the gallons produced were—

Upon which the tax was $142,779. Added
to this was the license tax, which was rated
according to capacity, and produced $372,561:
this giving the net tax from this source at
$415,340.
In 1801 the system of taxing capacity had
r j" so„affected improvements in the "mode
of distilling as to cause complaints of the ine-
quality of so much of the system as applied to
the capacity. It is reported of Doctor Jeffrey,
who was appointed by the English treasury
department to investigate this matter, that he
saw an improved still of about fifty-three gal-
lons capacity charged and discharged twenty- !
0?V'TieS Wltlnn an hour> and consequence i
of further improvements the same still was i
charged and run off four hundred and eighty- I
three times within twenty-four hours. '
In 1810 the census marshals returned 14 191
distilleries within the United States, and a total
product of 25,704,892 gallons.
From 1803 to 1812 the average annual import
?<v Unlted States was 7.612,415 gallons
. After deducting the export of domestic spirits
it was computed that in lsio there remained
31,929,142 gallons, this giving to each inhab-
itant about four and a half gallons.
The greatest amount of tax received into the
j Treasury previous to September 30, 1812, was
in the year 1801, when it amounted to 8989,553,
being forty-four per cent, of the whole internal
tax.
; In 1814 the whole internal revenue was
93.202,197, of which distilled spirits paid
SI,081,080, or fifty-one per cent.
In 1815 the whole internal revenue was
$0,242,503, of which spirits paid $3,049,800.

The consumption of spirits in Great Britain is
estimated atbutfifty-onemilliongallons. Their
revenue for the year 1865 from all sources was
j $354,000,000, of which distilled spirits paid
j $53,200,335, and licenses connected with its
sale paid $7,155,305. Add to this the receipt
from customs, $22,390,900, and we have a total
of $115,734,805, or thirty-three per cent, of
! their entire revenue. So admirable and per-
j feet is their system that this revenue is counted
upon with entire certainty. It consists in a
rigid inspection of the distillery at every stage
of manipulation from raw material to the re-
sulting spirit, and is supervised by men of
scientific attainments, who hold office during
good behavior and who receive a salary from
Government. At death a pension inures to

This Government holds the monopoly of
production, taxing it in varied forms in dif-
ferent Provinces, and farming out its production
in others, but in all cases exercising proprietary
control. For the year 1864 they received from
this source 127,000,000 roubles or $95,880,000,
or thirty-seven per cent, of the entire internal
tax. It is said that illicit distillation does not
abound there; and we may credit this in view
of the great share of burden it bears.

The duty here is equal to about sixty-six and
a halt cents per proof-gallon. The revenues
from it have steadily increased since 1859, in
which year it yielded about $54,000,000, until
1861, when it yielded $80,000,000.

The tax is estimated for the year 1862 at
13,858,388 florins; 1863 at 15,764,690 florins;
1864 at 14,283,754 florins. The rate is six
kreutzers per cent, of a Vienna eimer, and
twenty per cent, war tax; under which load
distillation is said to be on the decrease.

AA hat is known as the capacity system is
here applied, and has been for many years with
good results. It is a tax upon the capacity of

certain product from given materials. The
consumption is variously estimated from thirty
million to fifty million gallons.

The average consumption here is much greater
than in the other countries of Europe owing to
the rigor of the climate. I have imperfect
details, and therefore give an estimate for 1829.
It was computed that the product for that year
was thirty million gallons, yielding a tax of
$9,434,396. This, with a population of three
million, gives a liberal allowance to each.

The present tariff dates July 1, 1865—the
tax being reduced to six thalers. Although
there are thirteen thousand two hundred and
eight distilleries, their capacity is generally
small and the products used chiefly in the arts
or exported.

The revenue for spirits is more considerable.
Although the tax is about twenty-five and eight
tenths cents per gallon, the receipts for 1863
were 11,657,435 francs.
Let us see for a moment how whisky escapes
taxation. To produce it in the eastern States
from grain, allowing a yield of three and a
half gallons to the bushel, it is estimated to
: cost about thirty-live cents. Also, that the
cost of producing it from molasses yielding sixty
per cent, is about eighty-five cents per proof-
gallon, being fifty cents more than the cost
from grain. Notwithstanding this great differ-
ence, most of the spirits now produced in the
eastern cities is made from molasses. We can
| readily understand this when it is known that
the apparatus required for molasses distillation
1 is very simple ana very economical, occupying
but little space and easily concealed—'precisely
■ I the kind that villainy would employ; for by
li disposing of the spirits as fast as produced
■, (and such proves to be their course, as revenue
l! officers seldom find any quantity to seize,) there
: is but a worthless machinery left, of little use
to any one, and if sold by the marshal is bought
; in by some third party for the benefit of the
owner, who generally removes itto some other
place to try again his career of evasion. A law
requiring the destruction of these miserable
pretexts for distilleries could not but be salu-
tary. I shall have occasion to recur to this
again in describing what I saw on a visit of
inspection to what were duly licensed distill-
eries under the law.
The common methods resorted to by distill-
ers to evade the tax upon their production are
all based on the subserviency of the inspector
in charge of the establishment. This man,
although appointed by the Government and
clothed with all authority adequate to protect
the interests of the revenue, is made dependent
for his compensation upon the pittance of five
dollars per day, to be paid by the distiller for
every day the distillery is in operation ! This
in effect makes him but the hireling of his em-
ployer, who will give him work whenever and
only when such employment will return a profit.
If whisky could be sold freely in open market
at a fair profit overtax and cost of production,
there would be no need for the distiller to tam-
per with his inspector. If it cannot be sold,
and the distiller desires to run hi-s establish-
ment, he must make such terms with his in-
spector as will allow a portion of his product to
escape tax. Failing to make such arrangement,
both the employer and employ^ must remain
idle. But neither can afford this. The owner
or distiller cannot afford the loss of interest
upon his capital invested, and the inspector
cannot afford to wait long without receipt of
his five dollars per day. The result is soon
arrived at. A mutual understanding springs
up, resulting in loss to the revenue.
The modes usually resorted to for getting
whisky into market in fraud of the tax are by
putting brands and gauge-marks upon barrels
in apparent compliance with law. They then
pass freely provided they can be safely removed.
Some more timid than others do not rely upon
their adroitness in removing, but go through the
formality of entering a portion of their whisky
in bond, and then remove it under permit.
The branding and gauging of illicit whisky is
usually performed by the distiller in the absence
of the inspector, the tools and implements
being conveniently left within reach of his em-
ployer. Care is usually exercised by them to
