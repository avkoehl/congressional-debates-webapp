ing a field-work on the river near the mouth of Spirit Creek. Browne's command were ordered to that point. You had, I understood, directed him to send fifty men to Shell Bluff the day previous to relieve Captain Allen's company. That was all right. I wrote you an hour ago that General Beauregard had directed your whole command to march here at daylight to-morrow, leaving General Browne at mouth of Spirit Creek to fit up and defend the work there. If there has been any mistake about General B. please send a staff officer after him. Fifty of his men are to be left at Shell Bluff, and rest at mouth of Spirit Creek. General B. is to keep a messenger constantly at the courier station near Allen's

Colonel CUMMING:

Nothing has been heard from Wheeler or Colonel Crews to-day. The telegraph is not working beyiond Aiken. What it means I don't know, but hope that you will have your men well in hand, and that you will keep strong and vigilant pickets at the crossings. The Graniteville road should be well watched.

Respectfully,

D. H. HILL,

Major-General.

Colonel C. C. CREWS:

COLONEL: General Beauregard wishes me to direct you, unless you have specific orders from General Wheeler of another import, to fall back with your own brigade and the brigade with you (supposed to be Dibrell's) behind Upper Three Runs and connect on your left with General Wheeler. The Yankees now occupy Windsor. Hagan's brigade was stampeded and ran off. A column of infantry is reported to be marching from Barnwell Court-House to Aiken. Truth of the last report not known. Avoid being turned on your left. Have heard nothing from you to-day. Keep me constantly advised.

Respectfully,
