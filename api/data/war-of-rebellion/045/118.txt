Everything is quiet up to this time. I will send your message, just received, to Warren, to hold his point till further orders. I have not heard from that point yet. I am waiting here for orders. The weather is so hot that I would prefer marching in the night, if a choice is permitted. My rations are out to-morrow by the issues. I expect rations at Dumfries.
