CAMP ON CORINTH ROAD, MISS.,

Major-General BUELL, in Field:

Your not moving this morning, as agreed upon, has caused great embarrassment. General Thomas reports that his left has no support from you, and I have been obliged to draw back General Shermand on the right. Advise me as soon as possible of your position.

SHERMAN'S CAMP,

May 17, 1862.

Major-General HALLECK:

All very quiet with us to-day. Russell's house and farm in possession of a strong picket, with a full brigade in easy supporting distance. Our loss yesteday 8 killed and 31 wounded; 12 dead Confederates found on the field, and evidence of the removal of many wounded. I wish General Morgan L. Smith to have credit of the fight yesterday; he will be relieved from picket at 4 p. m., when I will have him report officially and forward it. I had the Purdy road broken last night for a temporary purpose. From Russell's we hear the drums of the enemy very distinctly, and cannot be more than 1 1/4 miles from camp.

HEADQUARTERS FIFTH DIVISION,May 17, 1862.

Major-General HALLECK:

We now hold Russell's by Brigadier General Morgan L. Smith's brigade and two regiments of General Denver's. The position is one of natural strength, but is entirely disconnected with our line, at least 2 miles of valley, all ambush, intervening between Russell's and nearest point of Hurlbut's line. Russell's is only 1 1/4 miles from the enemy's breatworks and 2 miles from here. I think Beauregard will attempt the capture of the brigade to-night, though in advancing we masked our forces as much as possible. We drove them entirely away, they leaving dead and wounded. We have lost 4 or 5 killed and a good many wounded. Shall I keep the brigade there? I fear it is too much exposed and separated from re-enforcements.

Brigadier-General.

Major-General HALLECK:

I dislike exceedingly to give up Russell's; it has cost us pretty hard fighting and some lives and will cost more the next time, but the force
