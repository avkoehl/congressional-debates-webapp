Numbers 59. Report of Colonel Levin Crandell, One hundred and twenty-fifth New York Infantry.
HDQRS. 125TH REGIMENT NEW YORK VOLUNTEERS,October 17, 1863.

SIR: I have the honor to make the following report of the part taken by the One hundred and twenty-fifth Regiment New York Volunteers, Third Brigade, Third Division, Second Army Corps, in the late engagements:

The regiment left camp near Auburn about daybreak on the morning of the 14th of October, being in advance of the brigade and division. On crossing a stream near Auburn we met the enemy, consisting of two pieces of artillery ad two regiments of cavalry, as near as I have been able to ascertain. Five companies of this regiment were immediately deployed as skirmishers, two companies upon the right of the road and three upon the left. The line of skirmishers were re-enforced by the one hundred and twenty-sixth Regiment New York Volunteers, they deploying upon the right of the road. The skirmishers were re-enforced by the One hundred and twenty-sixth Regiment New York Volunteers, they deploying upon the right of the road. The skirmishers then advanced, driving the enemy from their position; he retired skirmishing. * * *

The following named persons were killed, wounded, or are missing, or are supposed to be taken prisoners.*

The regiment then marched direct to Catlett's Station; from there took up the march toward Bristoe Station. When near Bristoe the column was attacked by the enemy in force upon the left flank. On the regiment arriving opposite the point of attack, it was immediately ordered to flank to the left and move to the railroad over an open field, a distance of near one-fourth of a mile, which was done under a heavy fire of musketry and artillery. On arriving at the railroad immediately opened fire on the enemy, who were drawn up in line of battle on a hill opposite our position, a distance of about 200 yards from the railroad. The enemy, soon after our arrival at the railroad, advanced to a house distant about 100 yards from the railroad, and were there repulsed and driven back.

Soon after I was ordered to deploy 40 men of my regiment under a commissioned officer as skirmishers in front of the brigade, which orders I immediately caused to be executed the skirmishers being under command of Lieutenant Harry L. Haskell. The skirmishers moved forward to the line and deployed to left of the house. Lieutenant Haskell went to the officer in charge of the skirmishers of the Nineteenth Massachusetts Volunteers, who were deployed on right, and asked him to co-operate with him in moving forward to the battery, which he refused to do, but advised him to wait until re-enforcements were obtained. Lieutenant Haskell then moved forward with a few men and ascertained that the guns were there in position. The cannoneers (6 or 8 in number) were lying under the pieces. He immediately advanced; they retreated. Lieutenant Haskell then mounted a gun and claimed the battery as his. He then brought off four guns with the assistance of his men and the men sent to him from the regiment, and a few of the Nineteenth Massachusetts Regiment, who had by this time come up. Two of the guns he turned over in person to a captain of a battery in rear of the brigade, and informed him that two more guns were at the railroad and that
