[JUNE 25, 1864.]

General FRENCH:

GENERAL: My vedettes have had to move back a little. Some of Cheatham's pickets have given back on the left, and even when they join me are not quite as far advanced as they have been. Gist's pickets still farther to the left, I am told, have been driven entirely in. From present indications, as Cheatham's pickets give way on my left, mine will have to retire to the right, down the branch. No force from my front can drive my main picket-line. I have sent Captain Todhunter to see General Cheatham. It would be well for Colonel Barry and myself to meet you to-night and confer. I will send for Colonel Barry to come to my headquarters, and if you desire it we can go to your headquarters or you could meet us here.

Very truly,

M. D. ECTOR,

Brigadier-General.
HDQRS. ROSS' BRIGADE, JACKSON'S CAVALRY DIVISION,Shaw's House, Ga., June 25, 1864-2.15 p.m.

Brigadier-General JACKSON,

Commanding Division:

GENERAL: Dispatch from General Johnston just received, asking for more definite information than was contained in my dispatch of 7.30 a.m. I was not satisfied as to the character of the force in my front this morning and was unwilling to send a dispatch to you, which might cause General Johnston to withdraw a part of his infantry from an important point, and hence could not be more definite. The enemy has appeared all the time to be infantry, but as they advanced on my position so very cautiously, I concluded that possibly it might be dismounted cavalry, and as I was in a position to discover any move they might make in the direction of Powder Springs, I thought it best to wait until I could state positively. They have infantry advancing on me, but it is impossible for me to tell the force. Their line of skirmishers is at least one mile in length. Everything indicates that they have at least a brigade or division in my front. They are not extending farther to the right than was mentioned in my last dispatch.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

L. S. ROSS,

Brigadier-General.
