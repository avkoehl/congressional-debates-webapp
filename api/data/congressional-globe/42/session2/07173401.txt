THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
3401
Mr. COX. I propose to amend that.
Mr. BROOKS. I rise to a question of
order. The order of the House was that de-
bate should close on that .portion of the bill
down to the end of the twenty-fifth line on the
third page. Under that order it was the in-
tention of the House that debate should be
continued upon subjects embraced in other
parts of the bill. Now, on the fourth page of
the bill 
Mr. PETERS. I object to debate.
Mr. BROOKS. This is not debate. I am
Btating my point of order.
Mr. PETERS. The gentleman is making
an argument, and I object to debate.
Mr. BROOKS. I must state my point of
order, that it may be decided upon; I have a
right to do so.
The CHAIRMAN. The Chair will hear the
gentleman from New York on the question of
order.
Mr. BROOKS. The gentleman from Maine
[Mr. Peters] need not be so sensitive in re-
gard to pine and spruce. [Laughter.] On
the fourth page of the bill, in lines forty-three
to forty-five, I find the following provision:
On boards, planks, staves, laths, scantling, spars,
hewn and sawed timber, and timber used in build-
ing wharves, ten per cent, ad valorem.
Now, my point of order is that the House,
by omitting that item from those upon which
there was to be no debate, intended, until fur-
ther order, that debate should run on upon
the subject of lumber ; and consequently it is
not in order for the gentleman trom Massa-
chusetts to move that proposition here.
Mr. DICKEY. The gentleman from New
York [Mr. Brooks] can debate the paragraph
he has just read when we reach it.
The CHAIRMAN. The Chair overrules the
point of order. Although thesauie subject-
matter inay be in another portion of the bill,
it may still be inserted here
Mr. FARN8WOKTH. I rise to another point
of order. I rose before to make the poiut. It
is that the amendment of the gentleman from
Massachusetts is not germane to the paragraph.
Lumber is in another section of the bill.
The CHAIRMAN. The Chair will sustain
the point of order made by the gentleman from
Illinois. The amendment would have to be
offered at the end of the sectiou.
Mr. DAWES. That is where I propose it
shall come in.
The CHAIRMAN. The Chair was informed
differently by the Clerk.
Mr. FARNS WORTH. I ask the Chair to
hear me. I understand the rule to be that in
Committee of the Whole, where a particular
subject is embraced in another section than the
one pending, it is not in order to move that
subject to the pending section ; that it is not
germane till the subject is reached. This has
been the ruling upon all appropriation bills.
The CHAIRMAN. The Chair is obliged to
overrule the point of order, because the prin-
ciple stated by the gentleman from Illinois
would make the Chair the judge of incon-
gruities.
Mr. KERR. I should like to make an in-
quiry of the Chair. Is it in order to offer the
part of this bill in reference to the internal
revenue law as an amendment at this place?
The CHAIRMAN. The Chair will rule on
that when it is offered.
Mr. KERR. That is all in this bill, and
would it be in order to offer it as an amend-
ment at this place?
The CHAIRMAN. If offered, the Chair
will rule on it. The amendment of the gen-
tleman from Massachusetts, [Mr. Dawes,] and
the amendment to the amendment of the gen-
tleman from New York, [Mr. Cox,] will be
read by the Clerk.
Mr. DAWES. My amendment is to come
in at the end of the twenty-tilth line, which is
the end of the second section.
Mr. COX. And my amendment to the
amendment is to come in at the end of the
amendment itself.
Mr. FARNS WORTH. Has the second sec-
tion been passed ?
The CHA1RMAN. It has not.
Mr. BURCHARD. I rise to a point of
order. Lumber is now in the third section,
page 4, ol this bill. The Chair ruled on me
in the first section that I could not offer an
amendment in regard to steel because steel
was in the second section. Now lumber is in
the third section, and is it in order to move an
amendment including it in the second, section?
The CHAIRMAN. That pointof order was
made by the gentleman from New York a few
moments ago, and overruled. The Clerk will
now read tiie pending amendment and amend-
ment to the amendment.
The Clerk read as follows:
Ameodment of Mr. Dawks :
Add at tho end of the twenty-fifth line, "on all
lumber and manufactures of lumber."
Mr. Cox's amendment to the amendment:
Add to the ainendmont, "Provided, Tho oxisting
duty thereon bo reduced at the rat© of fiftoen per
cent, ad valorem.*'
Mr. FARNSWORTH. Is it in order to put
in as an amendment the provisions in reference
to distilled spirits?
The CHAIRMAN. There is no such amend-
ment before the committee.
Mr. BROOKS. If this is in order there
will be many such amendments.
The question recurred on the amendment
of Mr. Cox to the amendment.
The committee divided; and there were—
ayes 43, noes 60 ; no quorum voting.
The CHAIRMAN" appointed Mr. Dickey
and Mr. Cox as tellers.
The committee again divided; and the tellers
reported—ayes G3, noes 72.
So the amendment to the amendment was
rejected.

Mr. BECK. I have moved this amendment
in order to have the question tested whether
such amendments are legitimate.
Mr. CONGER. This is taking articles from
the free list and taxing them.
Mr. DAWES. Unquestionably the gentle-
man lias the right to take them out of the free
list if he so desires.
Mr. BECK. I do not think it is in order;
