Captain E. M. Schell, Eighty-first Indiana, killed in the assault on the 15th, was a young officer known by all in the brigade and admired for his accomplishments and gentlemanly qualities, and honored for the remarkable gallantry he displayed in all actions in which he was engaged. All of my officers displayed that gallantry for which they are ever conspicuous, and on this occasion seemed determined, as did most of the men, that there should be no failure if human effort would avail. With such officers as Colonel John T. Smith, Thirty-first Indiana, Lieutenant-Colonel Yeoman, Ninetieth Ohio, and Lieutenant-Colonel McDonald, One hundred and first Ohio, to control and direct a line, a brigade commander need have no fear for the reputation of command. I would also call the attention of my superiors to Lieutenant Colonel James R. Hallowed, Thirty-first Indiana, who commanded the division skirmish line on the 15th of December. His personal gallantry on that day, and the ability with which he handled the skirmish line, is rarely equaled and I have never seen surpassed; he deserves great credit. I am again called upon the express my thanks to, nd my warmest admiration for, my staff officers.-Lieutenant William Felton, acting assistant adjutant-general; Lieutenant T. J. Stevens, acting inspector general; Captain William N. Beer, topographical engineer, and Lieutenant J . C. Smith, aide-de-camp-for their intelligent discharge of duties. They rendered great aid in the assault on the enemy's works by being mounted and continually on the front line. Lieutenant Felton distinguished himself by seizing the colors of the Ninetieth Ohio and bearing them on horseback through an embrasure in the works. My escort deserve my warmest thanks for their devoted attention, riding with me at all times and bearing my flag to the front in the assault till the works were carried.

For further particulars I have the honor to call your attention to the accompanying reports of regimental commanders.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

I. M. KIRBY,

Colonel, Commanding.

Captain E. D. MASON,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

In addition to the above report I would call special attention to the gallantry of Color-Sergt. Jesse H. Hall, One hundred and first Ohio. When about to cross the enemy's works he was met by a rebel officer with drawn saber and seemingly in command of that portion of the line. Sergeant Hall demanded the surrender of this officer and was refused. He (the sergeant) then brought into requisition the spear of his flag-staff and compelled an unconditional surrender.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

I. M. KIRBY,

Colonel, Commanding.
