HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF NORTH MISSOURI,Saint Joseph, Mo., June 12, 1864.

Lieutenant-Colonel DRAPER, Macon, Mo.:

H. T. and party are at Bucklin, with a large number of negroes and horses. I have ordered H. T. to come here by rail without delay and directed Sergeant Westely to move to Macon immediately with the entire party and plunder. I want both orders obeyed. You will go, or send a good officer with 25 men to Bucklin, forthwith, with instructions to see that the caravan goes to Macon without any delay and that H. T. comes this way. Get a full report of the campaign from Sergeant Westly and telegraph me the same with as little delay as possible. Avoid friction with H. T. if possible, but close the expedition anyhow.

Major CLARK,

Platte City, Mo.,

Major-General CURTIS,

Fort Leavenworth, Kans.:

I learn of a bushwhacking fight at Ridgeley yesterday morning, and have sent a small force in that direction. I also hear of bushwhackers near Weston. Let your troops be vigilant and active, and drive out and kill the villains. Fifty or even 100 bushwhackers ought not to be permitted to live so near troops. Concentrate your force and pursue the devils with determination and extermination. Telegraph me the condition of affairs in Platte County.
