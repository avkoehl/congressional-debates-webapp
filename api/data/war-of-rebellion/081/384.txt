Major-General.

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC.

June 24, 1864-8 a.m.

Major-General WARREN:

I send you a dispatch just received from Birney.* It confirms General Wright's opinion of yesterday. Should indications to-day confirm this, and the left wing of the army be heavily engaged, it will be imperative at all hazards to have assaults made in your immediate front.

GEO. G. MEADE.

(Same to General Burnside).

JUNE 24, 1864-9 a.m.

General MEADE:

I can turn back my left and occupy the line we held here on Saturday's battle, which would have the enemy's old intrenchments to cover it, and giving up the line to the left could probably send Griffin's and Crawford's divisions to help the left if attacked. If the enemy attacks the left by any design he will probably be prepared for any demonstration we can make against his intrenchments opposite to me. Of course this would leave a space between our left and right unprotected,but if he goes into that I think I might attack there with my other two divisions. We would thus be all the time tempting the enemy from his shelter if he would leave it, and the force I could send away would, I think, do more good at any point than an attack here could.

Respectfully,G. K. WARREN.

Major-General.
