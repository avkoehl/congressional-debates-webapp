Secretary of War.

HARRISBURG, PA., July 27, 1861.

Honorable SIMON CAMERON,

Secretary of War:

The Twelfth Regiment, Colonel Taggart, is ready to march to Harper's Ferry, but owing to condition of things it is necessary to retain them here at present for the preservation of life and public property in this place. General Keim has appointed a provost-marshal this morning.

A. G. CURTIN,

Governor.

HARRISBURG, July 27, 1861.

Honorable S. CAMERON:

The volunteers here are threatening to mob the paymasters. An attack was made on Brua a few minutes ago, and a regiment had to be called to put them down. The paymasters are doing everything in their power to hasten the business, but are delayed by the mob. We shall have an ugly time if the men are not sent away from here. Please telegraph the Governor to send them to their respective places of encampment and sent the paymasters after them. The banks refuse to allow the coin to be put in their vaults for fear of an attack. Please attend to this at once, or the money will be taken.

What is the cause of trouble among the soldiers?

SIMON CAMERON,

HARRISBURG, July 27, 1861.

Honorable SIMON CAMERON,

Secretary of War:

The trouble was caused by the officers of the Second Regiment, who told their men that they had all their rolls prepared, and when excited about not being paid, instead of trying to quiet them, urged them on to riot. The excitement delayed everything to-day. Paymaster Jolly is preparing the rolls of that regiment, and Brua up to time of the riot was paying the First and Twenty- fifth. The paymasters were doing their duty, and if the officers and had done theirs everything would have been well. All is quiet now. General Keim ordered out the regiment of three-years' men, who dispersed the mob. The Second is composed principally of men from Chambersburg.

J. D. CAMERON.
