Letter of Mr. Poston, Delegate from Arizona, asking that regiment of cavalry be sent as escort to himself and other Territorial officers from Leavenworth to Arizona via New Mexico, to be left in Arizona for service against the Indians, with your indorsement thereon, just received. There is no trouble about going as far as Santa Fe. and if additional escort is needed to that place General Dodge will furnish it. The Department of New Mexico is not in this command, and I know nothing of condition of thing there. Do you wish me to send a regiment of cavalry to that department? I have no authority otherwise to order troops out of this division.
