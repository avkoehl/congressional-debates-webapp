HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF KENTUCKY,Lexington, Ky., September 21, 1862-10 p. m.

General HUMHREY MARSHALL,

Commanding, near Mount Sterling, Ky.:

GENERAL: Information just received proves the enemy advancing in force from Covington by two roads. As Heth has been weakened by sending a part of his command westward it is of the highest importance that your forces should be at once concentrated and moved without delay to Paris. Send a few mounted men to Winchester to act as couriers between that point and Mount Sterling. If your command has arrived at Mount Sterling move at once to Paris, and then place these mounted men on the road between Paris and this place as a line of couriers.

I am, sir, most respectfully, your command at once to the front to report to General Heth until your arrival, as he is much in want of that arm.

Very respectfully,

E. K. S.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF KENTUCKY,Lexington, Ky., September 21, 1862.

COMMANDING OFFICER CLEBURNE'S DIVISION,

En route for Frankfort, Ky.:

SIR: The major-general commanding directs that you halt Major-General Cleburne's and General Preston Smith's brigades at the nearest good camping ground and await further orders. Report at once to General Heth that this order has been given you, and let me also know when your halt is made. Generals Cleburne and Smith will be at once notified of this change and ordered to join their commands.

I am, sir, most respectfully, your obedient servant,

JNumbers PEGRAM,

Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF KENTUCKY,Lexington, Ky., September 21, 1862.

Brigadier General HENRY HETH, Commanding, &amp;c.:

GENERAL: In view of the threatening movements of the enemy in your front the general commanding directs that you do not for the present send any of your force to Paris. General Marshall has been ordered to Paris as soon as he can concentrate at Mount Sterling. The brigades of Cleburne and P. Smith have been halted, and you are authorized to make use of their services in an emergency.

I am, sir, respectfully,

JNumbers PEGRAM,

Chief of Staff.
