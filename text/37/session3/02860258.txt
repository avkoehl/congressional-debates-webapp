THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
January 9,
: previous ques-
of an interpreter to the Legislature and translator of said
laws.
Tiie amendment was rejected.
Mr. KELLOGG, of Illinois. I desire to offer
an amendment iu regard to the Assistant Secretary
of State.
TheSPEAXCER. The gentleman would been-
titled to have a separate vote on that clause.
Mr. ICELLOGG, of Illinois. Yes, sir; but that
would not so well accomplish my object. I de-
sire to amend by striking out the words " the same
as the Secretary of the Navy, being $4,000," and
inserting the words " £3,000."
Mr. STEVENS. The amendment is notatall
necessary. The same tiling can be accomplished
by a vote on the clause as it stands.
Mr. KELLOGG, of Illinois. I pre fer my
amendment, and it amounts to just thu same.
_ Mr. STEVENS. I move the prevh
tion on the bill.
The previous question was seconded, and the
main question ordered.
Mr. TODD. I ask the consent of the House
to submit an amendment.
The SPEAKER. No further amendment is
now ifi order.
Mr. STEVENS. The gentleman from Dakota
omitted to offeivhis amendment in the proper place
in committee; and as his request is exceedingly
_ reasonable, I presume there wiU be no objection
to his omendment being offered now.
Mr. TODD. I will say that I sought to offer
the amendment in_ committee, but failed to catch
the ear of the chairman.
No objection being made,
Mr. TODD submitted the following amend-
ment:
Page 30, line seven hunched and thirtv-cight, add as fol-
lows ;

Tim amendment was agreed to.
The question next recurred upon the amend-
ment of Alt*. Kelj.ooo, of Illinois, to strike from
the second section the words " the same as the
Assistant Secretary of the Navy, bein<?^-i,0U0, t0
commence with the present fiscal year," and to
insert in place thereof the words " §3,000;" so as
to make the section read:

So the amendment was disagreed to.
During the call of the roll,
Mr, 1 RO^VHR1DGstated that his coJleo^ne, ■
Mr. Ijeajiax, v.*as aoscut in conhenrietjce of iiidis- '
posit.on.
The other amendments reported from the Cr>m- i
mittee of t'n^ ^Vhole on the state of the Unio'n 1
were then adopted in gross. !
The bill, as amended, was ordered to be en- 1
grossed and read a third time: and being engrossed :
was accordingly read the third Line, and passed!
Mr. STEVENS moved to reconsider the vote 1
by which the bill was passed, and also moved that
the motion tw reconsider bo laid on the table.
The fatter morion was agreed to.
ADJOURNMENT OVER.
Mr. "VVASIiBURNE moved that when the
House adjourns to-day, it adjourn meet on
Monday next.
The House divided on the motion; and there
were—ayes 75, noes 32.
Mr. BINGHAM demanded the yeas and nays.
The yeas and nays were not ordered.
Mr. ROSCOE CONKLING called for tellers
on the yeas and nays.
Tellers were not ordered.
So the motion to adjourn over was agreed to.
PRIVATE CALENDAR.
Mr. FENTON. I move that the rules be sus-
pended., and that the House resolve itself into a
Committee of the Whole House on the Private
Calendar. Before the vote is taken upon the mo-
tion, however, I ask the consent of the House that
this may be considered as objection day.
Mr. STEVENS. 1 must object to that.
Mr. FENTON. Then i will not press the mo-
tion to go into committee.
CONSULAR. AND DIPLOMATIC BILL.
Mr. STEVENS. I move that the rules be sus-
pended, and that the House resolve itself into the
Committee of the Whole on the state of the Union,
for the purpose of taking1 up and disposing of a
very shoit bill; and before the vote is taken on the
motion, I will move that the consular and diplo-
matic appropriation bill be made a special order
for to-day.
The motion was agreed to.
Mr. STEVENS. I now ask for a vote upon
my other motion.
The motion was agreed to.
So the rules were suspended, and the House re-
solved itself into the Committee of the Whole on
the state of the Union, (Mr. Wassiiislrke in the
chair,) and proceeded to consider, as a special
order, the bill of the House (No. 649) making
appropriations for the consular and diplomatic
expenses of the Government for the year ending
30th June, JSG4.
Mr. STEVENS. 1 ask the consent of the com-
mittee to d ispensc with the first reading of the bill.
Mr. liOLMAN. 1 object.
The bill was lead through.
The reading of the bill by paragraphs for
amendment was commenced.
Mr. HOLMAN nio\cd to amend in line forty-
eight, by striking out " $41,890,55 and inserting
in place thercot ^7,3'i0," so as to make the
paragraph read as follows:
For ofrioe i ojh tor tho-r con-n!.? srenotal, consuls, and com-
mercial a^en',^ who aio not allowcd to ttade, includingJo&s
In exeliaiiEo theu'On,
Mr. HOLMAN. I move this amendment for
the purpose of calling the attention of the chair-
^ man of the Committee of Ways and Means to this
| iact. I fmd m the appropriations of Inst year,
j that the sum I have named in my amendment,
' y?7,3?0, was the amount then appropriated. {
| have the act of the last session before me. The
Committee of Ways and Means now propose to 1
| increase that amount to >yU ,890. There mast be '
I some reason for ihis extraordinary increase, and i
j it is to be hoped that the chairman of the Com- J
miitee of Ways and Moans will give to the com- •
imttee some information upon that subject. It is
a \ c] y sUange fact that, with the exception of a
very lew items in this bill, there has been a steady l
iie^ease upon the corresponding appropriations '
ot (ho u\<jt year. U is a well-known fact that prior |
to the commencement of the pivsent, it was very
justly charged upon the firmer Administration
tjjat its expenses were enormously and unneces-
sarily high, "icl, strange enough, under the pies-
«'nt -Li-dannistration the expense of noaily every .
department connected with otn diplomatic service
has been largely increased. ;
31 oi ni'ji Jy, it very huge number of consuls weie
poid simply by h cs instead of salaries. Now. that s
class of < onsm's has in nearly every instance been 1
j-nporseded by salaiied Cunsuls, hugely increasing
f ] o rest to Hie Government of this branch of tiie ■
public service. In fact, I undertake to say that the '
bill now before us appropriates for the"consular ,
and diplomatic service of the Government not less I
than a quarter of a million beyond the appropri-
ations for any previous year in the history of the '
Government—certainly prior to the 4th of March,
1863. ' j.
Now,sir, the times tire not propitious for such I
an increase. There is certainly no necessity for it
in the present diminished commerce of the coun-
try. I should like to know of the chairman of
the Committee of Ways and Means, what is the
reason of this proposed very large increase in the
single item of consuls general and commercial
agents.
' Mr. STEVENS. I will say, in reply to the
question of the gentleman fiom Indiana, that it
will be recollected that, two years ago, Congress
gave to the Secretary of State power to increase
the number of consuls at his discretion. ^Vhether
the law was wise or not I will not undertake to
say. The expense has been considerably in-
creased, because the number of our consuls has
been increased.
Mr. THOMAS, of Massachusetts. I think the
gentleman does not state exactly the effect of the
law to which he refers. The law allows the Sec-
retary of State to give consuls salaries msiead of
fees, in certain cases where the public inteiests
seem to demand it.
Mr. STEVENS. I ought to have said that
authority was given to make them salaried offi-
cers. In a good many instances this authority
has been used. The truth is, the pay of our con-
suls is, I think, altogether too small. There are
many of them in foreign ports who are entirely
unable to support themselves 011 the salaries they
receive. Many of them have come home for this
reason. For instance, the consul at Batavia was
entirely unable to live on a salary of {,1,000 a year.
It,would not pay his expenses at all.
The loss of exchange lias also caused the ne-
cessity of consideiably increased appropriations.
This loss has increased in proportion to the in-
crease in the price of gold. These items go to
make up the appropriation of £41,890, the main
item of increase being upon the rate of exchange.
The amendment was disagreed to.

Mr. liOLMAN. I move to reduce that appro-
priation irom s414,OOG to ^351,550; winch was the
amount appropriated at the List session for the
■ same pus [lose for the present fiscal year. The
, committee will kcc that there is in tliix bill an in-
crease oi ^(jt),0G0 for tnis specific purpose. The
' gentleman lrorn P.mnsylvania, [Mr. Stf.ven^,!
the c'naunian of the. Committee of Wi>ys and
. Aiean^, says that these consular ofiiceis fre now
poorly paid. The ^ee.tleman from Marfsaclmsetts,
[^ir. Xiiomas,] to LXplatn the extraoiuinary in-
; crease in this item of approprin.tton, rt-ferred 10
the iact that n law had been passed to increase the
number of consuls to an unlimited extent. That
was the^ law of J8(U. [ believe, sir, that until
within the last two years, until the 4th of T1,[arch,
iSu], we never heard of these consuls being badly
paid. Accoruing to my recollection, there were
constant denunciations of the Administration of
Mr. Buchanan for proHi^acy and extravagance m
connection with our foreign relations* Since th^n,
