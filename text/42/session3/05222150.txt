So the amendment was rejected.
The next amendment of the Committee on
Appropriations was to insert after line seven
hundred and eighty-five the following:
To enable the Secretary of the Treasury to pay the
bearer of the contesting electoral vote of the State
of Louisiana, the sum of $638 is hereby appropriated
out of the appropriation heretofore made to pay the
regular messengers.
The amendment was agreed to.
Mr. WINDOM. I offer an amendment on
behalf of the Committee on Appropriations to
come in at the end of line seven hundred and
ninety-five.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The amend-
ments reported by the committee have not
been concluded.
Mr. WINDOM. I offer this amendment
from the committee.
Mr. EDMUNDS. We have not yet gone
through with those reported ia the bill, which
we were doing first.
Mr. WINDOM. I will withdraw it for the
present. •
The next amendment of the Committee on
Appropriations was on page 33, after line
seven hundred and ninety-five, to strike out
the following:
For the purchase of site, and to commence the con-
struction of a brick building at Evansville, Indiana,
to be used as a custom-house, court-house, post
office, and for other Government offices, $100,000.
Mr. PRATT. I wish to inquire of the com-
mittee the reason why they recommend that
this appropriation be stricken out?
Mr. COLE. A day or two ag.0 we passed a bill
in which were contained many appropriations
for public buildings in the various cities and
towns of the United States. That bill appropri-
ated for such purposes a much larger sum than
was ever appropriated in any one year before.
The total amount was something over $10,000,-
000. The Committee on Appropriations at-
tempted to strike out the propositions in
that bill for new buildings where they had
not already been commenced, but I believe
they were overruled by the Senate in nearly
all their amendments of that kind. Here in
this deficiency bill, as the committee thought
out of place, is a proposition for the purchase
of a site and to commence the construction of
another building. It ought to have been in
the sundry civil bill where there were other
provisions of this kind, if there was real
meritjn the proposition, and we attempted to
establish the rule of striking out all propo-
sitions of this kind where the building had not
been commenced, or where the appropriation
was for the purchase of a site and the com-
mencement of a building. Our action was
based mainly upon the recommendation of the
Secretary of the Treasury, whose recommend-
ation in his annual report was that appropria-
tions of this sort should be limited to the
completion of buildings begun or authorized
by law. That is all I have to say on the sub-
ject at present.
Mr. PRATT. I hope this amendment will
not be concurred in. At the present session
Congress has passed an act which I hold in my
hand, by which the Secretary of the Treasury
is directed ''to cause to be erected at Evans-
ville, in the State of Indiana, a suitable brick
building for the accommodation of the custom-
house, post office, United States courts, and
other ohices of the United States, the plans
to be determined by him, and at a cost, inclu-
ding the cost of the site thereof, of not ex-
ceeding $200,000."
Evansville ia one of the largest commercial
towns in the State of Indiana, Mr. President. It
is situated on the Ohio river below Louisville.
It contains a population, I believe, of about
twenty-five thousand people. It has a very
large trade with the South and Southwest.
It is one of the chief manufacturing cities of
Indiana. It has quite an import trade. The
Committee on Public Buildings recommended
at this present session the construction of this
building. It is, it will be perceived, a very
economical one. The ground and building
itself are not to exceed in cost the sum of
$200,000
In pursuance of this law, and for the pur-
pose of acquiring a suitable site for the con-
struction of this building, the citizens of
Evansville have contributed from their own
pockets the sum of $22,000 to be added to the
appropriation to be made by Congress for the
purpose of purchasing a suitable site ^or the
erection of this building. The Government
has no accommodations there at all at this
present time. This appropriation is emi-
nently demanded by the public necessities.
It is no fault certainly of Indiana that this
appropriation did not find its way into the
proper bill. It is here now, and it ought not
to have been stricken out by the committee,
and I hope it will not be.

Managers on the part of the House.
Mr. EDMUNDS. What is that bill ?
Mr. COLE. The sundry civil bill.
Mr. EDMUNDS. I wish to have that re-
port read again. I understand that several
millions of dollars are put in for public build-
ings that have not been estimated for at all. I
should like to have that part of the report
read which relates to public buildings par-
ticularly.
Mr. COLE. I do not know where the Sen-
ator from Vermont obtains Ms information,
but I think there is no appropriation of the
kind in the bill that has not been concurred in
by both Houses, and, therefore, which was not
quite beyond the competence of the confer-
ence committee. I do not remember anything
of the sort. I am quite certain that the case
is as I state. Indeed there was stricken out
an amendment put in by the Senate for a
building for the use of the printing and en-
graving of the Treasury Department and for
a depositary for the archives. That is striken
out. _ I think there is n.othing else of that na-
ture in the bill that the Senator is not perfectly
cognizant of, and which was not voted upon
by both Houses and approved.
Mr. STBVENSOlM. I wish the chairman
of the Committee on Appropriations would
give us briefly a statement of what is in this
conference report. If any Senater understands
it, he has been more fortunate than I have
been. It is voting just upon Greek. I do
not understand what the committee lias done
and it is impossible to ascertain what these
amendments are. If the chairman would just
give us briefly what the points that have been
yielded on both sides are, we should under-
stand how we are voting.
Mr. COLE. There are one hundred and
twenty or one hundred and thirty of these
amendments and it is impossible for me to go
over them all widioul huving the bill betore me.
If any Senator desires that it be laid a^ide
for the present that Senators may examine
it who desire to do so. I have no abjection.
Mr, SAWYEll. If the Senator from Ver-
mont will state the point to which he refers,
I can tell him what the conferees did about il.
