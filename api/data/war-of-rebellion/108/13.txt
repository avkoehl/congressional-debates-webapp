Arsenal, has to-day resigned. We are only waiting a letter from the Governor to occupy the arsenal. Fort Caswell was taken yesterday. Major Holmes says the guns there are not mounted, and it is absolutely necessary that an engineer officer should be there. It occurred to me that if you had such a person to spare he would be heartily welcome to the people of Wilmington. I wrote to the Governor to-day, informing him I would write to you, and suggested that he would telegraph you to the same effect. I have no doubt he will approve of the course I have taken. I awai myself of this opportinity to congratulate yourself and the South upon your election. Permit me to add, I know no other hands in which the honor and interest of the South could have been better confided.

With the heartiest wishes for your welfare, personal and political, I am, very truly and respectfully,

WARREN WINSLOW.
