* Serviceable horses, 15,036.

+ The monthly return of the army for April, 1864, reports a grand total of 4,737 officers and 99,048 men " present for duty." This difference between the two returns is not explainable. There are no tri-monthly returns on file for the month of May. In transmitting the return for June 30, 1864, General Meade says: " In consequence of the movements of the troops between the dates mentioned and the absence of all facilities for the preparation of the stated tri-monthly reports, it was found altogether impracticable to render such reports when due."
