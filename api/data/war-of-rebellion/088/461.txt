Captain J. JOHNSON,

Assistant Adjutant-General, First Division:

CAPTAIN: I have the honor to report that the lookout from our brigade reports the enemy as having re-enforced their line in front of our brigade. A number of troops, estimated by the lookout as a brigade, have stacked arms and laid down in rear of their front line, and one company double-quicked to the pits, which they entered about in front of the Fifty-eighth Pennsylvania, the third regiment from the right of our brigade. This force is thought to be a part of the troops reported a short time since, morning, as moving from Cemetery Hill toward Petersburg. The left of this line of stacks is about opposite the right of our brigade, and the right extends off toward the city.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. H. ROBERTS,

Colonel 139th New York, Commanding Brigade.
