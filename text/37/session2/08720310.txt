over seven hundred millions. I see no escape from the con-
clusiorfthat at tlie end of the year, taking the appropriations
and liabilities together, we certainly make no unreasonable
estimate if we call the amount of what h owing from us,
provided nothing has been paid, $700,000,000."— Congres-
sional Globe, 1861-432, p. 9606.
Such, sir, were the repeated and reiterated state-
ments of Senators and Representatives, all of them
of the Republican party—the chairman of the
Ways and Means in the House, the chairman of
the Finance Committee of the Senate, the organs in
this Capitol of the Treasury Department, the offi-
cial mouthpieces of the Secretary, men having
daily access to and in daily communication -with
him—statements not uttered once and at random,
but repeated over and over again and with all pos-
sible accuracy and minuteness of detail. Charily,
a little charity, I pray you, sir, towards those of
us who, having no cntyaYice within the inner courts
of the temple of the Treasury, and no right to
penetrate its hidden mysteries, are forced to con-
tent ourselves with standing in awe at its vesti-
bule, that we may catch the whispered echoes of
the oracle within.
And now, sir, I propose to prove beyond an hon-
est controversy, that the statements of the Repub-
lican Senators and Representatives, upon whose
authority we of the Democratic party repeated
them, were justified to the fullest extent, by the
estimates, by the appropriations, by the author-
ized indebtedness, and by the actual indebtedness,
as appears from official records, the authenticity
and verity of which cannot be impeached.
First, as to the "estimates." These, indeed,
are by no means reliable, because every two or
three months, and possibly every two or three
weeks, we have additional estimates from the
Treasury Department to supply the continually
recurring deficiencies. There is a discrepancy be-
tween the estimates for the present fiscal year,
made in July last and those submitted on the 1st
of December of $213,904,000. The eslimates of
the 1st of July were $318,519,000;and yet, during
a short session of five weeks, Congress appropri-
ated over and above these estimates the sum of
§47,985,000. Last December the Secretary of the
Treasury sent m supplementary estimates, ask-
ing additional appropriations to the extent of
$213,904,000. On the 15th page of his annual
report, of that date, he sums up the total of the
estimated expenditures for the fiscal year 1862 at
$543,406,000, or at the rate of $1,500,000"every
day m the year. Deducting the estimate of re-
ceipts, $36,809,000, you have as the amount of
debt to-tlay, estimated by the Secretary of the
Treasury himself seven months ago, the sum of
$500,596,000. To this add the debt up to July 1,
1861, of $90,867,000, and you have a sum total of
$597,464,519. And yet, with even this enormous
, amount, he has been forced since to confess errors
to the extent of two or three hundred million
dollars in his estimates for the year. And on the
28th of January the gentleman from New York
[Mi*. Spaulding] declaring Jhat the Secretary
" substantially agreed with nim as to what the
expenses would be," summed up the debt at
$650,000,000, or nearly $53,000,000 more than
the Secretary, in his report, had set it down only
seven weeks earlier.
I pass next to the "appropriations." What
further deficiencies aie to comem,or are now pend-
ing, I know not; but the amount of appropria-
tions already made by Congress for the fiscal year
ending to-day, is $608,126,496; and for the com-
ing fiscal year, 1B62-63, the appropriations pro-
vided for in bills now between the two Houses,
having passed one or the other, are for the Army
alone $521,980,445, or at the rate of $820 a man,
and for the naval service $42,427,771—an aggre-
gate of $564,408,000 for the Army and Navy alone.
Adding to that $1,818,000 for the Indian depart-
ment, you have $566,227,000. And to this must
be added $28,318,000 in bills already become laws,
in all, the sum of $594,543,000 for the next fiscal
year, making as the grand aggregate of the ap-
propriations already provided for by this Con-
gress since the 4th of July last, the enormous sum
of $1,104,976,881 66.
I proceed next to ascertain the amount of au-
thorized indebtedness, for which this House, the
Senate, and the President, have pledged the faith
pf the Government. In the fust piaco, the appro-
priations. a;; I have said, amount to $581,526,000.
Deducting from that the estimated receipts, adding
to them $9,000,000 for error, from customs, lands,
and all the other ordinary sources, $46,000,000,
we have $535,526,000. But this does not include
the $10,200,000proposed to be pledged by this bill
for the ship canal from Lake Michigan to the Mis-
sissippi river, nor the $64,860,000 for the Pacific
railroad, for which the faith of the Government is
now pledged, nor the $3,500,000 for the enlarge-
ment of the locks of the Oswego and Erie canal,
nor the §5,000,000 for the ship canal around the
falls of Niagara, nor the other one h undred projects
of disinterested patriots and philanthropic pro-
jectors in this House and outside of it for aug-
menting the number and extending still more
widely the circulation of the " legal tender" notes
of the United States.
There is yet another form of authorized indebt-
edness: loans and Treasury notes. By the act of
July 17,1861, we empowered the Secretary of the
Treasury to contract a debt of $250,000,000 in
bonds, at his discretion. By the act of the 25th of
February, 1862, $500,000,000 more in bonds were
authorized, and $100,000,000 in Treasury notes;
and by an act passed a day or two subsequently,
$10,000,000, in addition, of demand notes; and
by the act which has already passed this House,
is now pending in the Senate, and will probably
become a law in a few days, $150,000,000 more
of" legal tender;" making of authorized indebt-
edness in these two forms a grand aggregate of
$1,010,000,000.
And now, sir, for the purpose of arriving at a
fair estimate of the daily expenditures of the Gov-
ernment, I propose to take the Army as the test or
standard. Accordingto the statement of the Ad-
jutant General of May 21, 1862, furnished to the
chairman of the Military Committee of the Sen-
ate, and the report of the Secretary of War in
December last, the number of men in the regular
and volunteer forces on the 21st day of May was
637,988, divided thus—regulars, 20,334; volun-
teers, 617,654. On the 21st of May there were in
these two arms of the military service, 26 major
generals, 207 brigadier generals, 1,200 staffofficers",
including brigade surgeons and additional pay-
masters, one retired Lieutenant General drawing
whole pay, and a full quota of officers attached to
the department of the Adjutant General, quarter-
master, subsistence, pay, ordnance, Inspector
General, and medical departments, and the corps
of engineers and topographical engineers.
Now, from statements made at the pay officc,I
present here a sum total for pay and subsistence
alone,including forage and servants,of the regular
and volunteer Army .amounting to $17,290,916 72
a month, being at the rate of $207,491,000a year,
and $576,363 a day; and this, let it be remembered,
for pay and subsistence alone. What the actual
amount of other expenditures for the Army arein
full, it is utterly impossible to learn, in advance
of actual returns, which cannot be had for some
months to come; but I have ascertained the pro-
portion which pay and subsistence bear to the
other expenses in time of peace, by the actual ex-
penditure returned,.and in time of war, by esti-
mate for the present year, and I find it to be ex-
actly two fifths. Assuming that as a basis of
calculation, we have $518,745,500 a year as the
total expenses of the Army, $3,000,000 less, by
the way,than theappropriations already made for
the coming year; being at the rate of $43,228,000
a month, and $1,440,000 a day.
These other expenses, sir, include cost of cloth-
ing, camps and garrison equipage, ordnance and
medical stores, supplies, purchase of cavalry and
artillery horses, (to be replaced at least once in four
months,) medicalaml hospital department, (in time
of war enormously beyond anything in time of
peace,) the transportation and subsistence of pris-
oners of war, and the purchase of arms, ordnance
stores, gunpowder,and lead, amounting in the ap-
propriations already made for the current fiscal
year to $35,000,000, or not far from the sum for
which contracts were made by authority of the late
Secretary of War, Mr. Cameron. But above and
beyond all as to cost, is " transportation," (by
railroad, steamboats, sailing vessels, and wagon
trains,) including, in time of war as a very heavy
item, the transportation of the sick and wounded.
Now, sir, 1 submit to the candid judgment of the
House, that it is buta fair and reasonable estimate
to say, that at least twenty per cent, also should
be added to the aggregate of these and other ex-
penses, not including pay and subsistence of the
army, for additional cost and waste, and wear
and tear, or destruction or capture in time of
war. Adding this, you have a total expenditure of %
$580,996,400 a year; or $49,249,000 a month, and
$1,642,485 a day, for the Army alone.
To this I add now the expenditures for the
Navy. Having no means of actual knowledge of
the amount, 1 apply the only or at least the next
best test, the appropriations for the current fiscal
year, amounting, at the last three sessions of Con-
gress, to the sum of $101,778,762 30. Adding this
to the Army expenditure, you have, as the aggre-
gate, the sum of $682,775,162 30, being at the rate
of $56,897,930 per month, and $1,896,598 per day
for the entire year round. Sir, the gen tleman from
Massachusetts [Mr. Dawes] was right, except
that, tried by his own standard,his "disloyalty"
was a little more exaggerated than mine.
So much, sir, as to the cost of the Army and the
Navy.
But there is yet another army, the horde of
thieves and plunderers, less numerous, it may be,
but more formidable, more consuming far to the
Treasury than the legions of brave men who go
forth baring their bosoms to the storm of battle.
These are the cankers of troubled times and a
fierce strife—
" A pitchy cloud
Of locusts, warping on the eastern winds.}'
They are the " somebodies" who, with the aid
of their official allies in high places, have, in the
language of the gentleman from Massachusetts,
[Mr. Dawes,] on the 25th of April last, in the
days of his innocency and before his fall, "plun-
dered the Treasury well nigh in that single year,
the first year of a Republican Administration, as
much as the entire current yearly expenses of the
Governmentduringthatadministration (Mr. Buch-
anan's) which the people hurled from power be-
cause of its corruption."
And there is yet another army, sir, to be paid
and subsisted—an army more reputable certainly .
than your plunderers, but more in numbers also
and not less devastating in their march. I mean
the host of assessors ana tax gatherers whom you
are to-day enlisting to go forth into every dwell-
ing house, every business house, upon every
farm, into every city, every town, every village,
and every hamlet, into palace and hovel alike,
throughout the land, carrying anxiety and dis-
may at every step.
And these constitute the very priesthood of that
accursed Trinity of War,Taxation, and Eman-
cipation, before whose cruel shrine the gentle-
man from Maine [Mr. Pike] bows down in idol-
atrous worship; a Trinity compared with which
Juggernaut is merciful and the Ganges humane;
a Trinity upon whose bloody and consuming altar
the fairest country and the noblest structufe of
government the world ever saw is offered up day
by day as a sacrifice.*
I proceed now, sir, to the question of the actual
indebtedness and liabilities to-day. On the 4th of
March, 1861, the public debt was $72,289,278 68.
On the 28th of January, 1862, that debt, accord-
ing to the statement of the Treasury Department,
as produced here by the gentleman from New
York, [Mr. Spaulding,] amounted to the sum of
$306,764,613 34. On the 29th of May, 1862, ac-
cording to the letter of the Secretary of the Treas-
ury, the debt was $491,445,984 11. Deducting the
$90,867,828 68 of debt to July 1, 1861, there re-
mains the sum of $400,578,155 43 as the amount
of debt incurred during the present fiscal yearend-
mg to-day. Thus the increase from January 28,
1862, to May 29,1862—a period of three months
—is shown, not by conjecture, but by the record,
to have been $184,681,370 77, being at the rate^of
$61,560,456 a month, and $2,052,000 a day, or
very nearly the exact sum estimated in January

ated in Congress, or spring, like Minerva, full-grown fiom
the head of our Army, I carc not. Come he will, and his
name shall be Emancipation. And these three—Tax,
Fight, and Emancipate—shall be (he Trinity of our sal-
vation. In this sign we shall conquer."— SpcechofMr. Pikcy
