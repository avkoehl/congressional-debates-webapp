The CHAIRMAN. For what reason does
the gentleman raise the point of order on the
amendment?
Mr. KERR. That has just been acted on
by the committee.
The CHAIRMAN. It has not been acted
on ; it was proposed. The Chair thinks that it
is in order unless there is something in the bill
prior to it fixing the duty.

that.

sert at the end of the section the following:
