Brigadier General JOHN B. HOOD.

Commanding Division:

GENERAL: The commanding general desires that you will move your command over to the Brooke turnpike, taking position near Brooke River, having especial care for all standing crops and against damaging private property or depredating in any manner by men of your command. Throw forward a strong picket to the Chickahominy Bridge. A company of Critcher's cavalry battalion has been ordered to report to you, which can picket in front of your infantry. Major-General R. H. Anderson has been ordered to hold himself in readiness to cross the river if the necessity therefor should arise. This movement is ordered in consequence of reported movement of enemy in considerable force by the Telegraph road toward Richmond.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,[R. H. CHILTON.]
