COLONEL: I have the honor to state that I have to-day received assurances from General Couch that as soon as this place may be deemed secure and tranquility resorted I can obtain from him ready assistance to overcome the opposition to the enrollment in the mining districts. A copy of a letter from the provost-marshal of the Tenth district is hereby inclosed, which characterizes somewhat the nature of the difficulties to be contended against and expresses opinions often repeated by others.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. V. BOMFORD,

Lieutenant-Colonel Sixteenth U. S. Infantry,
