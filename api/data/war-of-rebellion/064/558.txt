C. T. CHRISTENSEN,

Major and Assistant Adjutant-General.

MORGANZA, LA., June 26, 1864-11.45 a. m.

General CANBY,

New Orleans, La.:

The arrangement proposed suits all parties best, and is, I think, preferable to any that can be made. It only requires General McGinnis to be excused from coming to the Nineteenth Army Corps.

General Emory considers his leave canceled.

J. J. REYNOLDS,

Major-General.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF WEST MISSISSIPPI, New Orleans, La., June 26, 1864.

Major General J. J. REYNOLDS,Commanding Nineteenth Army Corps, Mortanza, La.:

Your dispatch has been received. It will be arranged as you propose. The order will be published to-morrow.

ED. R. S. CANBY,

Major-General, Commanding.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF WEST MISSISSIPPI, New Orleans, La., June 26, 1864.

Major General J. J. REYNOLDS,Commanding Nineteenth Army corps, Morganza, La.:

Your telegram of 9 a. m. was not received until 9 p. m. General Emory's leave will be canceled. How would he like the La Fourche or Baton rouge District, both of which will be important? I will make the assignment you indicate if it is desired. My objection is the probable embarrassment that would arise from making changes after the expedition moves.

ED. R. S. CANBY,

Major-General, Commanding.
