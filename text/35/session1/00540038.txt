Prior to the passage of the act of 3d March,
1857, the adjustment of the swamp grant was
greatly retarded by applications filed on the part
of individuals, to contest the right of the Smto
to the lands selected. That act, by confirming
the selections with exceptions, put an end to the
individual contests, and the adjustment is now
rapidly progressing. The character and extent
of the contests then pending appear in the last
annual report.
The recommendation of the last report is re-
newed, that a limit be fixed to the time within
which swamp selections must be made.
During and since the year 1850, grants of lend
have been made to ten States and one Territory,
to aid them in the construction of fifty railroads,
of an extent (part estimated) of g,647 miles,
amounting (part estimated) to 34,247,335 an«'S,
The grants to the States of Illinois, Missouri.and
Arkansas, for eight roads, have been
The grantees have accepted the grants of 3856
and 3*857, except the States of Alabama and Lou-
isiana. The Legislature of Alabama has not b "m
in session since the date of her gran?. The Stat'*
of Louisiana has accepted the grant made to her
in part; the residue is rejected. The attention of
this office has been given to the adjustment ot
these grants, so far as the prerequisites have been
furnished by the authorities of the grantees. The
adjustment of these railroad grants involves an
amount of official labor at least equal to the sale of
that quantity of land, the suiface to be operated
on being a stiip of thirty mih s broad, along the
route of each road, within which previous sales,
locations, and preemptions, have to 1>p carefully
examined and adjudicated under new rules peculiar
to these grants, with a view to equal justice to the
grantees^ the settlers,and purchasers.
The mode of proceeding in this branch of busi-
ness is as follows : The lands falling within the
probable limits of the railroad grant are, upon
application, withdrawn from sale or location ;
the act of Congress is communicatee! to the Gov-
ernor of the State; plats of the road are called
for; and the general practice has been for the
State to accept the grant, and transfer the same
to incorporated railroad companies. Then the
maps of the road, duly certified by the Governor
under seal, and by the company, are returned to
this olnce, generally on a scale of an inch to a
mile, indicating the connections with the sectional
lines of the surveys; showing, also, the exacc
dates of the survey, and staking off the road on
the ground; because, from these dates, which must
be established by the affidavit of the engineer of
the road, the title to the State has legal inception,
according to the late Attorney General's opinion.
If there is a material deflection in the route uf
the road, an explanation is required; and unless
it satisfactorily appears that the line taken is the
! most practicable route between the termini, it is
| rejected. If the route does not deflect too much
i between the termini, the map is accepted as the
basis of adjustment. The line of the road is then
laid down upon our official township plats, with
the six and fifteen-mile limitsof the <i.i ant. The.i
proper diagrams are prepared for office use in the
adjudication of preemptions sales, bounty-land
location-*, swamp selections.
These diversified interests falling within the rail-
road belt are required to be examined, and the r
validity or invalidity tested in connection with
the State title under the State gran:. The ledgers,
or tract books, where all these interests are re-
quired to appear, must be posted up to date, and
then we begin the preparation of the lists descrip-
tive of the lands winch inure to, and are to be cer-
tified to, the State—tlie indemnity selections be-
| ing, under the decision of this office, limited to the
j State to which the railroad grantis made. When
i the granted lands for railroad purposes are ascer-
tained and reported, then the residue remaining
; to the Government are to be brought into market;
I and this it is the purpose of the Department to
i cii'ectwith all practicable speed.
! The particulars touching these grants are more
: fully presented in the following table:-

lands for railroads by Congress, from the ycai\
