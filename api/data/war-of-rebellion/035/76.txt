Washington, February 18, 1863.

Major-General ROSECRANS,

Murfreesborough, Tenn.:

There is only money enough to pay troops to the end of October. To pay your army to the end of December would leave others unpaid for September and October. I have written to you in regard to execution of sentence of death and arrest of deserters.

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.

MURFREESBOROUGH, February 18, 1863.

General DODGE, Corinth, Miss.:

Fitch, with four gunboats, starts up the Tennessee to-day. If you have any idea infantry will do any good, you had better send them to Hamburg to meet the boats.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.

XV. By virtue of the authority vested in the major-general commanding by the Secretary of War, Captain J. Hartley, Fourth Indiana Cavalry, for violating a safeguard and permitting his men to plunder, is dishonorably dismissed the service of the United States. The crime is by the laws of war punishable with death, and the general commanding regrets that he cannot inflict it.

By command of Major-General Rosecrans:

H. THRALL,

Captain and Assistant Adjutant-General.

WASHINGTON, D. C., February 19, 1863.

Major-General ROSECRANS,

Murfreesborough, Tenn.:

GENERAL: Your letter of the 13th, with inclosed General Orders, Numbers 19, have been received and submitted to the Secretary of War. So much of that order as contemplates the organization of light battalions by selection from different regiments cannot be approved, because it is a violation of law. Volunteer troops must be organized in the manner prescribed by Congress.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.
