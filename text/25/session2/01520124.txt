to the Cherokecs themselves, but to th« Go-
vernment As this treaty had been executed
almost entirely, with the exception only of so fai
as related to that small portion of the tribe y et ad-
hering to John Ross, he thought it highly desirable
that the doeuments should be published, that the
eountry might properly appreciate its beneficial
tendencies—that the pernicious counsels of lohn
Ros-, might be counteragted, and that it might be
shown to the u01 Id at large that the Government
was resolutely determined, mildly, but firmly, to
cairy out with this people its benevolent policy of
removing them fiom their pissent dangerous situa-
tion, without which it is impossible the race can be
preserved
The question then being taken on printing 500
extra copies of the communication lrom the War
Department, it was agreed to
Mr LUMPKIN then offered the following re-
solution, which was const'ered and adopted
Whereas, A memorial, acccompamed by va-
rious other documents, oi a delegation of the Chero-
kee nation of Indians, remonstrating against the
validity of the Cherokee treaty ol 183'i, has been
printed by order of the House of Representatives ,
and whereas said memonal and documents not
only call in question the validity of said tit itj , bin
greatly derogate from the charuto, and impugn
the motives, ot those individuals of iht, Cheiokee
nation who negotiated an 1 signid said titaty on

And whereas, Ehas Boudmot, la'e editoi of the

Mr SEVIER though1-the 11 h section relating
to the bghts, m ght be dispense! with also lie
was of opinion that the lights, as contemplated ' y
the bill, would have no other eñeci than to bind
and bewilder the pilot
Mr CLAYTON was opposed to strii n" out
the section He thoughts the 1 „ht as designated,
wiuld occasion no mconven e ct to the pilots aid
that little expense would be incjireJ in fmi ,
lights that would not m any manner inferiere ■ ah
the \ is on of those entrusted vv itb the navigation
Mr SrVIER evplaii ed that the necessan li°ht
were ail over the boat, and 'bai  li^-e was no   Idi
culty in descrying the  boat lion  the  files  o   t',t
furnaces, and lights from the ^ci s and b«rtn
Mr B4YARD bought if lights v ere rtquncc'
by taw, that there ought to be ¡wo at least
Mr STRANGE thought it better  to  leavi  Iht
matter to experienced men, who would, no doubt,
Uke all thi nece sary precautions ior the safety of
boat and passengeis He thought the last Sectior
covered all th<" giottnd necessary on the occasion,
whuii made misconduct, negligence, or mat'en
tion, on the pait of the captain, engmeei, or pilot,
penal.
Mr D4VI8 moved to amend the 11th section by
msei tmg lhat "boab running between sunset and
sunr se, should carry oae or more signal 1 ghts that
might bt seen b^ boats navigating the same routes,
which amendment was adopted
Mr SMITH of Indiana said he rose to inquire
of the chanman of the committee, wh-thei the
bill, with the modifications and amendments just
pioposed and accepted by the chairman,'contained
any provision against lacing with steamboats, or
any provision requiring an examination of the
pilots and engineers employed on the boats He
(Mi S ) had not b°en able to ascertain, owing, he
supposed, to his not having been able to hear the
amendments which had been accepted as modifica-
tions of the bill by the chairman, whether the bill
did or did not as amended, contain these pi ovi-
sions Fie thongnt it ought to contain the n HP
believed muen of its desued utility would be lost,
unless some piovisions on these points were incor-
porated in the bill He w ould not, however, anti-
cipate the íeply of the honoiable chauman to his
Hiten ogatones
Mi GRUNDY (the chairman) said 'he commit-
tee had considered the proposition to require an
examination of the engineers and pilots employed
on boats, and although ihev believed the obiect to
be desirable, they had foreseen so much difficulty
in carrying it into effect, that they had abandoned
it at this time, believing that it would retard the r
operations of th° bill, but that it might be resorted
to with advantage hereafter As to the othei in-
quiry of the Senator, he (Mr G ) thought it pro-
vided for in the fifteenth section of the bill, which
was the only provision on the subject
Mr SMITH stid he had seen the section of the
bill which the Senator supposes meet- 'he cas  to
which the lnjmv was directed The Senator was
certainly mist iken in the object and legal operati in
o<" that sectioa He (Mr S ) would lead it to «bow
that it did net emb ace the casp [VIr S then read
the 13th section of the bi'l ] It appears clear from
this section, said Mr S that it only punishes the,
offtnee m cases where life is lost bv the negligence
oi misconduc1 of the captain, pilot, engineer, or
other pel on employed in navigating the bo-it This
provision does not covei the off nice he wished to
punish He w ished to punish the offence of Sieam-
boat racing, whether h os aie lost or not On the
othei portion of his inqii rj, he still thought some
piovision of the 1 md important, as Iip was wed
satisfied tha stcimbopt disasters lrequently occur
from the absolute gnorance and want of skill of
those en^agt 1 as pilots and engineers 'Jp was
apprized that ther> night be sone difficulty n car

other b anch <f tne mamry ti which he had first
d'ndcd, he vv uld in -1 moment draw an <i nend
mt"l to come in at the c ose of the section he had
r a 1 to the Senate
Mr S then offt ed t'p fohowirg amen'ment
" And exerv such captai", engine i or othei per-
srii employed as af >'e d ir naviK ng any s e¿ m-
ooat or ves el propehet in whol" or m p -t by

guil'y of a h gh misdemeanor, and «hall upon

Mr BAYApD thought tiat the explos on shcii'd

Mr SEVIER «as of the opinion that it would
be impossible to carry out the amendment H«
thought the thuteenth section even went farther
than was necessary If life and pioperty were
tndangeied, that piovision contained the remedy.
It would be always difficult to determine what
r icing was Boats left for their destination by
dozens at a time, and that boat wfaica was the
fastest invanaoly got all the passengers Persons
wishing to travel on the western wafers mad« it
their business to inquire for the boat of the g-ealest
velocity. Every one, m travellings was anxious to
get on with the least possibly delay, and he had
been in boats where the passengers had entreated
the captain not to let th- otner boats pass them
Mr CLAYTON was opposed to the amendment
Tt would, in bis opinion, be difficult to determine
when boats were racing He had b en in boats
wrich were side by side, and, m other mstanses,
not fifty yards distant, the whole trip, and though
they might appear to be racing to casual observers,
yet they were going only at then ordinary rate.
He thought that it would be subjecting the masters
and pilots of these boats to malicious prosecutions.
Mi SMITH of Indiana begged the indulgence
of the S nate but for a few moments, while he at-
tempted to sustain his proposition, and to answer
the object ons of Senators who had spoken in oppo-
sition to it He (Mr S ) believed the amendment
absolutely necessary, to give effect to the bill. The
13th section, to which his amendment was offered,
provided only for cases where lives are destroyed.
It punishes the offence after it has occurred, accom-
panied with the loss of 1 fe Jjfter the inj ury is sus-
tained, aftei the boat and passengers are blown up
or sunk it locks the door aftei the horse is stolen.
There was sucha thing, as he understood, as pre-
ventive justice, as well as the punishment of crimes
after they had been* committed These distinctions
run Jnough the whole catalogue of offences known
to oui books We have the different degrees of
offences and crimes from the simple assault, to the
killing with malice afoiethought, in offences against
the person So in all othei cases, we have, and we
punish the different grades of criminal acts and mis-
demeanors, and it may well be said that justice is
m >re crtain in her aim and purpose in the punish-
ment of the incipient stages ol iiime, than she ii m
the more aggravated, tor *s the punishment rises m
the scale of consequences, the proofs become more
difficult, anl the punishment more uncertain
He (Mr S ) btlieved that racing was the inci-
pient stage of the awful calamities w ith which the
papers of lh  day are filled, occurring by steamboat
disasters, producá! by bursting of boilers, collaps-
ing, centusions and contacts with other boats,
snags, sawyers, and o^t solid substances The
papers were filled with these most awful calamities
daily The great dangers to which the travelling
public were sib|ected at eiery point called aloud
lor the most effic ent lemedy as a pteventive , and
hp hoped he would not be accused of hostility to
the bill, or the section to wh ch he had offeiea his
amend nent, when he said that he vvoiill rather be
thp neatly of saving the lives ol the crew an 1 pa1 -
stnge's t f one boat, then of punís ,mg, by incar-
ceration in the walls of a pnson, al1 tr-e surviving
ofn-p s ui boats that may be blo.vn up m the
wor'd His o'ljcu was to save 1 ves, not to punish
suivivors, and the surest way to do this w*s to
punish tne incipient offences before the final cata«-
tiopbe occuned—to meet the offender at the
threshold—io stop him at once—to sav to him, y u
shah not endanger the lives of your ciew and pas-
se i ge s—to meet hnnin hm ne—opiectni tneoom-
m iSion of the offence for w'nch h  mus, «iiffl-
under circu instances that could afford no cmso a-
tion to the dead or dying
Tii  Senator from Delaware (Mr Cattoi)
th' iks the tei n rac ng is too uncertain m t'ie
fiks* p'ace to be del led and prived and in tht se-
cond place he objects to the am°ndment, becaase
h  says it will «ive i se to malicious prosecutions
To t e tirst of these petitions he (Mi S ) would
"ay that the tu m was one of very gpn*ral, and lie
be'ievpd v,ell known, signification, and as to the
proof, it was like all o'hpr facts, it would be proved
n the oi dinary way, and the fact whether the de-
fendant be or be not guilty of racing, will be for
the jut y to determine Prom all the circumstances of
