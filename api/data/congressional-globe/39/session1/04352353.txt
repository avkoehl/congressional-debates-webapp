petitions and memorials.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Chair
has received, and been* requested to present to
the Senate, a memorial signed by many dress-
makers in different parts of the United States,
praying for a modification of the present tax
upon their business. They represent that so
far as taxing their labor is concerned; though
that would'be onerous at the present time in
view of their compensation, they would be
willing to submit to that; but a tax of six per
cent, upon the materials, costly trimmings, itc.,
that go through their hands purchased by their
employers, makes an amount of expenditure
on their part so large that their business, if the
tax is continued, will be absolutely destroyed,
and they beg that the tax on their manufac-
tures may be repealed. This petition will be
received, and referred to the Committee on
Finance.
Mr. GRIMES. I present a petition from
Admiral S. W. Godon, acting rear admiral in
charge of the Brazil squadron, and the other
line and staff officers of the Navy attached to
that squadron, who represent that the pay for
naval officers was established free from tax, at
a period when the currency of the country was
gold and silver ; that even at that time it was
not more than sufficient to meet their necessary
expenses, and. left them without the prospect
of providing for old age or misfortune; that
since that period the cost of the necessaries of
life has more than doubled in many instances;
that this increase of cost has boon provided
for in civil employment by a corresponding
increase of salaries, while the naval officers,
compelled by the discipline of the Navy to pre-
serve the appearance of officers at whatever
cost, have been forced, in many instances, to
incur debts and suffer family privations, which
they^ have endeavored to conceal from the
public during the rebellion, with the hope (hat
after its suppression either the cost of the
necessaries of life would be reduced to its for-
mer amount, or that Congress would, in their
sense of justice, make such an addition to (heir
pay as would enable them to maintain that
appearance before their fellow-citizens and
the representatives of foreign countries when
abroad which universal sentiment requires of
all officers. They therefore pray that Con-
gress will in its wisdom and justice provide for
an increase of the pay of the naval officers of
the United States. I move that it be referred to
the Committee o%Naval Affairs.
The motion was agreed to.
Mr. SHERMANpresented a communication
addressed to him from the Commissioner of
Agriculture, in relation to the subject of culti-
vating the China grass; which was ordered to

Agriculture.
kepoiits of committees.
Mr. RAMSEY, from (lie Committee on
Revolutionary Claims, to whom was referred
the memorial of Frederick Vincent, adminis-
trator of James LeCazc, late of the firm of
LeGano & Mallett, praying for the payment
of money advanced during the revolutionary
war, submitted an adverse report thereon;
.which was ordered to be printed.
Mr. POMEllOY, from the Committee on
Public Lands, to whom was referred a bill (H.
R. No. 249) to establish a land office in the
Territory of Idaho, reported it without amend-
ment.
Mr. WILSON, from the Committee on Mili-
tary Affairs and tht Militia, who were instruct-
ed by a resolution of the Senate of the 16th
ultimo to inquire whether the full Army Regis-
ter, now in course of publication, has been
compiled in accordance with the requirement
of the joint resolution approved March 2,1865,
and what will be the cost of such publication,
submitted a report accompanied by a joint res-
olution (S. R. No. 83) respecting the publica-
tion of the Volunteer Army Register. The
joint resolution was read and passed to a
second reading, and the report was ordered to
be printed.
Mr. STEWART. The Committee on Public
Lauds, to whom was referred a bill (S. No.
123) granting lands to aid in the construction '
of a railroad and telegraph line from the Cen-
tral Pacific railroad, in California, to Portland,
on the navigable waters of the Columbia river,
in Oregon, have instructed me to report an
amendment in the nature of a substitute: and
I will state that the substitute is the House bill
on the same subject, with some amendments.
Mr. HOWE. The Committee on Com-
merce, to whom were referred various peti-
tions of persons engaged in mining and run-
ning coal from the Monongahela coal-fields
to market on the Ohio and Mississippi rivers,
praying for such an amendment of the enroll-
ment act as to exempt from its provisions all
coal-boats, coal-barges, and coal-flats which ara
used exclusively for running coal to market^
and are not used for any other purpose, have
considered the subject, and have directed me to
ask to be discharged from the further consid*
eration of the petitions, and recommend that
they be referred to the Committee on Finance ;
and I will say, if the chairman of the Com-
mittee on Finance will give his attention, that
there is accompanying the papers a letter from
the Secretary of the Treasury recommending
that they be exempted from the enrollment'
and be required to take out a license instead,
and it was the opinion of the Committee on
Commerce that it should be referred to the-
Committee on Finance that they might see-
whether they would issue a license, and if so,
whether they would recommend or not that-
they be exempt from enrollment.
The report was agreed to.
