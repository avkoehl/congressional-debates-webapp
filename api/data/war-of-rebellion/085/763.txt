Smith and Mower will get between him and the Osage and hurt him. Colonel Blair reports Lamar burned last night, not a house left. It is about forty miles southeast of Fort Scott, and was done by a large force of bushwhackers.

PLEASANT HILL, October 10, 1864-9.30 p. m.

Major H. H. HEATH,

Provost-Marshal-General, Fort Leavenworth:

We have been scouting here in various directions for the past week. There are no guerrillas or bushwhackers between this and Warrensburg. There are a few small bands of five and ten, amounting to about forty-five altogether, in the Sni Hills, but keep so quiet that we can find but two or three together. Price has sent a force of 1,500 men to cross the river at Boonville. McNeil is following them closely with 2,000 of our cavalry. We can learn nothing from Jefferson City, the lines having been cut on all sides of us as well as all the railroads. All the men employed on the Pacific road have been compelled to quit and are moving for safety to Independence. Every man in this country has gone to join Price, and we found none at home while scouting, except old men unfit for duty.

HERMAN AND TOM,

Scouts.

FORT LEAVENWORTH, October 10, 1864.

Major-General SYKES,

Lawrence:

Rations will go forward immediately. The regular volunteers may now move forward except experts to take charge of guns and fort. The militia will guard the town. Blunt must take the field, as you are unable and I may break down.

Major-General.
