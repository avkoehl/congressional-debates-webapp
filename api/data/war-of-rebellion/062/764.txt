FORT SMITH, March 26, 1864.

General Thayer, with Eighteenth Iowa, Twelfth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Kansas, First and Second Colored, Rabb's battery, and all the Arkansas troops, have gone by General Steele's orders toward Little Rock. I turned over such transportation as he required to move with yesterday. In his march, 35 miles east of here, he overtook a train of ninety wagons I sent out for forage, and by a brilliant piece of strategy succeeded in capturing and taking it off. Your attention is called to the irregular the troops moved away are those were unquestionably in this department when the department was created, and the same that I requested you to have returned to my command.
