FRANKLIN, November 30, 1864-5.30 a.m.

Major-General THOMAS,

Nashville:

I hope to get my troops and material safely across the Harpeth this morning. We have suffered no material loss so far. I shall try and get Wilson on my flank this morning. Forrest was all around us yesterday, but we brushed him away during the evening, and came through. Hood attacked in front and flank, but did not hurt us.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.

FRANKLIN, November 30, 1864-9.50 a.m.

Major-General THOMAS,

Nashville:

My trains are coming in all right. Half the troops are here, and the other half about five miles out, coming on in good order, with light skirmishing. I will have all across the river this evening. Wilson is here, and has his cavalry on my flank. I do not know where Forrest is; he may have gone east, but, no doubt, will strike our flank and rear again soon. Wilson is entirely unable to cope with him. Of course I cannot prevent Hood from crossing the Harpeth whenever he may attempt it. Do you desire me to hold on here until compelled to fall back?

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.

NASHVILLE, November 30, 1864-10.25 a.m.

Major-General SCHOFIELD,

Franklin:

Your dispatches of 5.30, 5.50, and Wilson's dispatch, forwarded to you, have been received. It will take Smith quite all day to disembark, but if I find there is no immediate necessity to retain him here, will send him to Franklin or Brentwood, according to circumstances. If you can prevent Hood from turning your position at Franklin, it should be held; but I do not wish you to risk too much. I send you a map of the environs of Franklin.

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding.

Troops and trains in all right.

FRANKLIN, November 30, 1864-12 m.

Major-General THOMAS,

Nashville:

Your dispatch of 10,25 a.m. is received. I am satisfied that I have heretofore run too much risk in trying to hold Hood in check, while so
