HEADQUARTERS,Decherd, August 27, 1862.

Colonel HARRIS, Battle Creek:

It is of the very highest importance that we should be promptly apprised of the first step taken by the enemy to advance and what course he takes after reaching Sequatchie Valley. I rely on you to look to this. Use money as liberally as may be necessary, but see that the information is reliable. If your telegraph line fails send couriers to Stevenson and this place across the mountains daily. Write in the telegraph cipher.

D. C. BUELL.

Colonel HAZEN, Murfreesborough:

Has train of the Fourth Division come into or gone out of Murfreesborough lately or do you know anything of it? General Thomas at McMinnville has heard it was captured by Forrest yesterday.

General McCOOK:

Have your division and Crittenden's ready to march at 3 o'clock to-morrow morning (Thursday) for Altamont. The object is to observe the enemy and impede his progress across the mountain. With this in view, I propose to place the rear or main body of your force 9 miles beyond Altamont, near where the road turns to the left from the Therman road to go to the Dunlap road; from there to throw forward a detachment to the top of the mountain near Therman's to break up and obstruct the roads after the enemy begins to advance, and from positions naturally strong attack the enemy and drive him back.

There should also be a supporting force between the front and rear on each road. As the distance will be from 8 to 10 miles, each detachment should be furnished with signal rockets.

I will see you or send further instructions during the day or night. It is unnecessary for me to tell you that these the posts of judicious and determined officers and good troops, and none others should be sent.

We will try to get the Tracy City road open so as to give you about 12 miles of hauling; otherwise you will draw through McMinnville.

COMMANDING OFFICER, Manchester:

Forrest's cavalry is at Woodbury. You must be on the alert.
