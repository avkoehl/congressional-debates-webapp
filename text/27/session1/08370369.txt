Veto Message-—Mr. Fives.
Senate.

suned that bill thai that you Mi President, now occupy that
chair, or that I am addressing you
I rose nc' to say one woid winch shun' ' wound the feeling at
President Tyler 1 he Senator says that if placed in like cu
cumstanoes, 1 would hive been the last man to avoid putting i
direct veto upon the bill, had K net n y disapprobation and h

firmness—a't that concern^ a justappieciat on of the m«n?mfi
canceof hu nan I rt—v.hateverm3 ba attempted to threaten or
alarm a soul not easily swoyp 1 by opposition, or awed oi and
rmda'ed by menice—a stout hear' and a steady eye that can
survey, unmovel and uniaunled any i ¡ere personal perils that
assail this pooi transient, petishins fra ne—I may, wi bout dis
paragement compaiewith othe) men B¡ t thprp is a sortof
courage whith, I hankly confers it I do not possess—a boldness
to which I d re not aspire—a valoi which I cannot covet 1
cannot [ay myself down in the way of the welfare and happi
ness of my country Tha I cannot I have not the courage to
do I cannot interpose the powei witn which I may be invested
—a power confeircd notfoi my persona! benefit, notfoi my ag
grandizement, but for my country sgood—to check hei onward
march to greatness and glory I have not courage enough I am
too cowardly, for that I wouU not, ! dare not, m the e\eicse
of such a trust, lie dow t, and place my body across the patli
that leads my country to prospen y and happiness This is a
sort of courage widely different fiom that which amanmaydis
play in his pi i vate conduct ana personal relations Peisonal 01
private courage is totally distinct from that higher and nobler
courage, which pi ompts the patriot to offer himsell a voluntary
sacrifice to his country's good
Nordidls-iv a" the ^enatir,repieseiits, that the Piesident
should ha¿eresianed Í intimated no p rsonal wish or desne
that he should le«ig i Irefenedto the fact of a r emorable
resignation in his public lite And what I cud say was, that
there were otner alternatives be are htna besides veto ig the
bill, and that it was woitby of 1 is consi'eration whether con
sistency did not lequi.e that the example which hehalset
when he liad a constituency of one State, should not be iollovv-
edwhen ha had a constituency commenemate with the whole
Union Another alterna ive was to suffei the bill, without his
signature, to pass into a law undei the pi ovisions of the Con
stitution And I must confess I see, in tins, no such escaping
by the bark door, no such jumping out of the win low, as the
Senatoi talks about Apprehensions of the imputaron of the
want offmnness sometimes impel us to peiroim 1 i-h and in
considerate acts It is the gieate«t couiagp to be able to bear
the imputation of the w mt of caiag But pule, vanity,

Ymues'
Isaid nothing of any obligation on tl " put of the Piesident
to conform his julgmerat to the opinions of the Senate and
Houseof Representatives, a'hiugh the-^nator argued as if I
had, and persevered ,0 so arguing after repeated coirections
Isaidnosuch thing I know and inspect the perfect inde-

opinion of the people of the Tinned S' ttesin favoi of the esta
blishmentnfa Bank of the United States And I cantended
that according to the doctime of ms ruction which pi-nailed
m Virginia and of which the President is a d sciple, and in
pursiuo-cot the example already cited, he ough' not to have
rejected the bill

"I am 'Vice Pie idem of the Unlten Ma'es, and not of Vir

tisfactory reply believing as I most íeligioisly do that a
large maionty ofthe people of the United States are m favoi ol
a National Bank, (and gentlemen msy shut their eyes to the
fact, deny 0' dispute o íeasan it away as they please but
it is my coasciencious convic ion that two thuds if not
more, ofthe peop'e ofthe United States de,ire such an m«titu
t on ) I thouaht I beheld a sure an i certain guaranty for the
fulfllmentof the wishes of the peop'e of the United fttues I
thought it imp )3slb e that the wants and wishes of a gieat peo
pie who had  e to,-ved such unbounded and generous conn
ilence, aadcin'jia'on hina such exalted honors, should be
disregarded an 1 disar c.omte! It did no en er i no my imagi-
nation to conceive that one who h id shown so m ach deference
and respect to tne presumed sentí nents of a single iDtate,
should display less towar Is   h  sentiments of tie whole nation
I hope, Mr Pres'dent that in perfm ning the painful duty
which had devolved od me, I have not transcended the limits
«ilegitímate debate Trepea i,i ad truth and sincerity, the as
■ urance to the Senate md to the country, that nothing but a
stern, remctant, and indispensable s use oi honor an 1 duty
could have forced from me the response which I have made to
the President's objections But instead of yielding without re
straint to the feelings of disappointment and mort'fieation ex
cited by the peru al of his aiessage, I have anxiously endea-
vored to temper the notice ol it which I have b-en compelled-
to take by the inspect due to the office of Chief Magistrate, and
bv the personal regard and esteem which I have ever entci
tamed for its pieoetit incumbent

us I) i' a vlolatio i of mat engagement, or, in other words, a
breara oí fai li an actof perfidy tothe nation1* Again, did nov
the 1 o ith able tstuatorsay, if the course which the President has
now takdieui d have osen anticipated, either by the Harris
huigConven ii i ot 1 tne people at tie polls, he would not
bavericeivet aP nrhv d<ja! vote in the former or a smgleelec
toiol voteftom the 1 'teil Docs notth simply a disingenuous
stippiessioia «on cthmg like a Iradulent concealment of his
opinions by the Pi sident which, if true, would, under the cir
cumstancts ha * been grossly inconsistent with the principle 
ot ¡rood faith     ihvv   little foundation there is for any such im-
I  utation, I Haiti i myself I must have fully demonstrated to
thesa isfactionof he --enate in the remarks 1 had the honor to
make in   rt-ply ta the fust speech ofthe Senator from   Ken
tucky
I be honorable senator also insisted, with gaat earnestness
in t the veioof tl '3 lull, undei ino circumstances in which the
Piesident stood, w as so exceptionable a pioceedmg that, rather
than to have resorted to ii, it would have been b«,t er foi him to
have evaded the lesponsibihty oí hi  high station, by permit-
unatbeten davs toe apse withoutany aclion on the measures
oi otherwise to have íes sned Ins office, and left the Govern
ment without an elective heal' Could any thing convey a
stronger or more pointed i o idemnation of tht President's con->
duct ib in to hold up llheroi both of these extreme and mad
mis ible alterna ¡via, as picfeiable to the course he actually
adopted Bat thi Senatoi alkg's that he did not say the Pre
si lont ought to have icsgned Did he not, however, argue
mos'zeilously to show th it consistency with the President's
own conduct uid pnnci its on a former occasion,when he held
a seat in the Senate of the United ¡Slates, required that he should
have lesicned on ihe ptespntt Wh it was this but to uige tha
President's usienation by the stionecst appeal, peisonal to
himself and denved nom his own exjnaph / Is it not mere
sotcial pleading, then, for the Sen itor now lo allege that he did
not say the Pi tsi lent should have resigned? When the whole
tenor ofthe Señalo, ssptech waschnracleiued bysecll pointed
and significant repnhinsions of the Prcsideni s conduct, could
ihe lavish and ostentatious pioiessions of personal regaid and
respect, to which the Senator now appeals as evidence of the
spirit of his speet h, be viewed in any other light than as a bit-
tet  mockery?
The honoi able Senatoi still insists that the question of a Bank
was in issue solemnly decided in the Piesidential election I
thought 1 had shown, by niefiastable pioofs from the record,
w nen I ti i st ad 1ro sed the Ser ate that this issue was not mado
in the Piesidential election ar', from the well known and re-
coided oj lnions ul ihe can "¡dates selected both foi the Presl
