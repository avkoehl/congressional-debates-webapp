for it. Everybody knows that. What, then, are
we to do, sir? Are wetostand idly by, having,
as I have-shown, the power, the rightful power
to interfere, and see a wide and fair section of
our country go to ruin in, this way? I do not
think so ; and therefore I say that the only fault
Ihave to find with the bill now before us is that
it does not go far enough, because .while it does
make the Legislature of that State provisional
and subject still to the paramount-authority of
Congress, byimplication it makes the executive
government of that State and the judicial gov-
ernment of that State permanent, and that gov-
ernment can only punish crime and protect life
through the exercise of justice in the civil tribu-
nals; and that is mere mockery in these wide
sections of the State; whereas if you would
make the whole government provisional, while
it would not interfere at all with the exercise
of civil administration in those sections of the
State where civil administration was adequate
for the purpose of protecting life and doing jus-
tice, it would enable the military commander
of that district in aid of this provisional govern-
ment to organize his military commission in
those counties held by these regulators and
desperadoes and hang them, as they deserve.
So I say, Mr. President, having occupied
more time than I intended when I rose, that my
fault with this bill is found in the fact that it
does not reach far enough to redress the enor-
mous evils that exist in that State.
Mr. SAULSBURY. Mr. President, the bill
under consideration is entitled " A bill to per-
fect the reconstruction of the State of Georgia.''
The particular amendment now before the
Senate is that the Legislature of Georgia shall
be provisional until they ratify certain amend-
ments to the Constitution of the United States.
Mr. HOWARD. With the consent of the
Senator from Delaware, I propose to move an
adjournment.
Mr. SAULSBURY. I yield for that pur-
pose.
Mr. MORTON. I hope that question will
not be put till I can have the joint resolution in
regard to the admission of Virginia referred to
the Committee on the Judiciary.
_ The VICE PRESIDENT* Is there objec-
tion to the proposition of the Senator from
Indiana? ["No!" "No!"] TheChairhears
no objection; and the joint resolution in regard
to the restoration of Virginia will be referred
to the Committee on the Judiciary.
Mr. HOWARD. I move that the Senate do
now adjourn.
The motion was agreed to; and the Senate
