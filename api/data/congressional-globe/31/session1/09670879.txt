Mr. THOMPSON. As I said some time ago,
the gentleman is only likely to be more deeply en-
tangled the more he struggles. Not only were
statistics collected in 1810 and 1820, but the aggre-
gate of those statistics are to be found in books in
the State Department. Let us look at the law.
In the act to amend the act for taking the third
census, we find the second section of the act of
1st of May, 1810, as follows:
"Thatit shall be the duty of the several marsha.'Secre-
taries, and their assistants aforesaid, at the time forsaking
the census or enumeration aforesaid, to take, under"the
direction of the Secretary of the Treasury, and according
to such instructions as he shall give, an account of the sev-
eral manufacturing establishments and manufactures within
their several districts, territories, and divisions. The said
assistants shall make return of the same to the marshals or
secretaries of their respective districts or territories, and
the said marshals and secretaries shall transmit the said re-
turns, and abstracts thereof, to the Secretary of the Treas-
ury, at the same times at which they are by this act, and the
several acts to which this act is an additional, required re-
spectively to make their return of said enumeration to the
Secretary of State. For the performance of which additional
services they shall respectively receive such compensation
as shall hereafter be provided by law.
"Approved May 1, 1810."
Now I want to know if that is not the law, and
if the gentleman does not believe the statute books?
I invite him to go with me to the State Depart-
ment, and he will there find published and bound
volumes of the compendium of statistics of the
census of 1810.
Mr. STEPHENS, I am^perfectly aware, as I
said when I was up before, that a supplemental
act was passed in 1810, which did provide for
taking certain munufacturing statistics; but they
are not embraced in the schedules of the census
bill; whereas, the schedules of statistics here are
parts and parcels of the law.
Mr. THOMPSON. The fact is not as the
gentleman states. The statistics are part and parcel
of the census law of 1810, and schedules were pre-
pared and sent out at the same time as were those
for the enumeration of the inhabitants. Now let
us look at the law of 1820, and I will send it to
the Clerk, and ask him to read the tenth section.
I have an array of precedents here that the gen-
tleman dares not approach.
The section was read by the Clerk, as follows:
" That it shall be the duty of the several other assistants,
at the time ot taking the census, to take, under the di-
rection of the Secretary of State,according to such instruc-
tions as he shall give and such form as he shall prescribe,
< an account of the several manufacturing establishments and
their manufactures within their several districts,' and make
returns and abstracts to the Secretary of State, and ' they
shall tespectively receive as compensation tlierelor, 20 per
cent, in addition to tile sums allowed by this act.'51
Does not this authorize taking statistics ?
Mr. STEPHENS. That is exactly what I
stated when I was up before. And theactof 1810
authorized the Secretary of State to give directions
to the different marshals to take an account of the
various manufacturing establishments. But what
I stated in addition was, that no such statistical
schedules were made a part of the bill, or adopted
by Congress.
Mr. THOMPSON. I know the gentleman from
Georgia does not wish to be in error, but did not
he just now assert that such statistics were not au-
thorized by the acts of 1810 and 1820, nor by any
act until 1840? These statistics were authorized
by law, and were taken, and if he will take time
to step down to thy committee room I will show
him the schedules.
Mr. STEPHENS. Were they adopted by
Congress? Were the schedules incorporated in
the law ? I have referred to those in the statute
books.
Mr. THOMPSON. The statistical information
was collected under the authority of Congress, and
by law requiring: it.
Mr. STEPHENS. But the gentleman does not
confine himself to the point. These schedules are
not on the statute books, and Congiess is not re-
sponsible for them.
Mr. THOMPSON. The gentleman is to some
extent right—the form of schedules are not upon
the statute books. But my friend fiom Georgia
is high and dry ashore. He is altogether aground.
The controversy was whether such lavvs have been
passed. 1 cited them as precedents—he denied
their existence. Who is right ? But I am told that
precedents are of no consequence. Sir, legislative
precedents, 1 admit, are not binding, but should
never be disregarded; when they are disregarded
it should be with very great caution. 1 do not
mean to say that they are absolutely binding, be-
cause the decisions of Congress are not infallible;
but when legislative precedents have been scruti-
nized for years as coming fairly within constitu-
tional powers—when they have stood the test for
half a century, and have received the sanction of
such names as those of Madison, Monroe, Jack-
son, Van Buren, Polk, and also President Taylor,
as I have shown, it does appear to me they should
be entitled to some regard. A man must have a
stout heart who will venture to say that he is right
and they are all wrong.
Now I ask you, sir, and the committee, if, under
the act of 1790 and the act of 1800, there was not
just as palpable violations of the Constitution com-
mitted, if there be any, as there can possibly be
under the provisions of this bill? If this bill vio-
lates the Constitution, then did the laws to which
I have just referred. Those acts required the ages
and sexes of individuals to be given, and both re-
quired an enumeration of the deaf and dumb.
Where is the constitutional provision for this, any
more than for statistics? But I am tired of this
constitutional controversy. Scruples in certain
quarters have no end, and to illustrate to what ex-
tent constitutional scruples may lead, I cannot re-
frain fiom relating a story which I heard the other
day concerning a Virginia gentleman; and Virgin-
ians, you know, are never wrong, though some-
times peculiar. This gentleman became very sick,
and it was feared that he could not recover. An
intimate friend called d^o'n him to know if he had
any thing to comm unieate—any last request to make
before his departure to another world. "Yes,"
said the sick man, " there is one thing that I desire
—I do not wish to be buried at the public expense,
I wish my friends to provide for my burial."
"Why," said his friend, " what objection have
you to being buried at the public expense—that
honor has been conferred upon many, why not
upon you?" "Because," replied the other, "I
have reflected upon the subject, and have come to
the conclusion that it is unconstitutional." [A
laugh.]
This serves to show the ruling passion of a
strict constructionist, " strong in death." 1 love
old Virginia for many things, but I am not obliged
to be governed by Virginia or Georgia opinions
in everything
Now, a remark or two on another point, and it ia
a point that has been declaimed upon, and rea-
soned upon, a good deal. It has been said that
this bill is inquisitorial. Inquisitorial! Sir, these
questions in regard to agricultural pursuits are de-
nounced as inquisitorial. Never was a term more
misapplied. Is it inquisitorial to inquire of the
farmer what has been the produce of his well-
eultivated farm, upon which his labor has been
bestowed ? what he has realized from his beautiful
and luxuriant fields' or of what number his flour-
ishing and increasing flocks consist? or how much
in the aggregate, he has added to the means of
supporting and perpetuating life? Or will it be
inquisitorial to inquire of the manufacturer bow
much he has added to the great stock of .national
wealth? N^sir; they will be pleased and happy
to answer. I know they will in the North, and
so, 1 believe, will they be in the South. I defend
the latter against the imputation that they would
not be willing to answer. Sir, there is something
calculated to elevate the mind in contemplating the
additions industry makes to the material that feeds
and sustains a country. The producers will be
.gratified that you ask them for it; and its only
effect will be to increase the desire to advance
their production. But who is it that objects to
these inquiries? Not the farmer or manufacturer.
No, sir, it is not; it is the lawyer. The gentle-
man from Georgia and the gentleman from South
Carolina, are lawyeis, sir; and others objecting
are lawyers.
Here Mr. T. was interrupted by Mr Jones,
who said 1 am not a lawyer, and 1 object to it.
Mr. T. It is said, Mr. Chairman, ihat an ex-
ception proves the rule; and without the least dis-
respect to the honorable gentleman, [Mr. Jones,]
I have considered him generally an exception to
all rules. [Laughter.] I am a lawyer myself,
sir, but nevertheless the fact is so, that lawyers are
non-producers. Sir, if the marshal were to go
round and ask our ancient and venerable piofes-
sion what they have produced, what they have
brought forth and laid upon the shelf for use and
sustenance of life, they would make a sad exhibit. It
is instinctive with them, therefore, not to like such
inquiries. No one can ever speak truly of the
tastes and feelings of others without occupying
their positions. Hence, not being producers our-
selves, we do not like the inquiry, and mistakingly
suppose that our sentiments pervade the minds
of others. This is wrong. Those who do pro-
duce desire the inquiry. All these pursuits are
