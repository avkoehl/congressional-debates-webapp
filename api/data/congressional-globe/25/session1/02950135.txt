Making public officers drpoiifnie?—Mr. Hunter

community But I pass from th  consideration of
the means of immediate relief, real oi imaginary,
which are not within ourieach,to those v hich may
be And here I beg leave to pause upon out fiscal
policy, and its incidental effects upon turrency and
trade If it has introduced causes which distuib
the natural level of circulating capital, and fur-
nished a fal'e e\citement to currency and credit,
that policy ought to be changpd Public conve-
nience may requne that the change should be gra-
dual, but important interests demand that it shall
be ultimate!v made After much consideration, I
havp come to the conclusion that the present and
past commercial tiis, resses nave been mainly pro-
duced by the American banking system, a system,
sir, which, by the law of its creation, hurries to its
downfall as the neces<-aiy result of i*s own action,
and this catastrophe is only hastened by the excite-
ment of the connection between it and the Govern-
ment
It has been said, Mr Chairman, by McCulloch,
one of the ablest political economists of the present
day, that our system of banking is tneivoislin Ihe
world I will not stop now lo institute tt>at com-
parison, or lo examine his conclusion, but I shall
demonstiate that it« natuinal tendencies aie to pro-
duce a state of things like the present, if I succeed
in showing, first, that it causes a fa'se d stnbulion
ot capital, and secondl} , that it creates a d scascd
action in the credit and cmrency sj&ttms, by form-
ing an impioper connection between them
According to oui banking policy, these mstitu-
tutions have the exclusive right of making a paper
curienc}, and their paper only is received in. pay-
ment of public dues To these exclusive pnvileses
they unite the power of dianmg interest from an
amount greatly exceeding then capitals Take in
conrection with tins, the usuij laws, wrnch exist, I
believe, in all of the States ot the Union, a id \ou
have tne re uit that capital, loaned tluough bank
agency, will draw an interest greatly exceeding that
which any othei capitalist can denve from money
lent The loanable capital of the counlrj will of
course seek that investment, and fill those channels
of circulation before it leaches any other—the
consequences of the artificial direction thus given
to capital, is its fike distribution between the
different sections of that countiv, and th> different
classes of socety ir that coup n, in wh "a banks
have those exclusive privileges. The loanable
capital will seek the pitees in which these
institutions exist, until it has exhausted tit dema d
foi it there, before it reaches those portions of the
same country m wmch banks do not exist It will
do so, because througn bank agency it can denve
more than the legal interest wnhm thesphue of
its operauons, whilst beyond that sphere its profits
are confine 1 to that intei est The syste u esta-
blishes, in cflect, a bonntv ipon capital lent to the

sir, in which the system p slices a fa's  c' stubu-
tion ot capital The avai'al'c p cl -, ot lht.se in-
stitutions, within th- limits pte ent-d to the"i are
so great that they may Leerme credit nisi anee of-
fices The directors, unaer these extraordinary
advantages, may rim the i sk of insuring a favo-

reaching the limits of calculation pres„ued to them
The temptat on to run this risk is so s'rong that
they too often yield to it
Mr Chairman, it is no ansu er to these objec-
tions, to say that every section of the country may
be supplied wiih its due proportion of ba'nking
capital The country is <npph*d w th banks
through its Legislature, and no Government has
the means of ascertaining the reKive wants of
different sections m this respect But, sir, if the
Government could ascertain the íelative propor-
tions in which the diffeient sections shoul 1 be sup-
pled to make the distribution jus', it would be una-
ble to make that distribution A supply of all the
capital wanted foi loan in any countiv, through the
medium of banks like ou s, would expand the
credit system so rapi >ly, from e?uses which I 'hail
endeavor to sho v, as to pioduce levnlsions which
would piesent a scene of wide spie-d rum and dis-
aster A fact which is so iimie-scl upon the pub-
lic mind, that every Legislatuie not perfectly wild
in Jts movements, seems to have endeavored to re-
strain Ihe s\s em w ithin the sunposed wants of the
countiy, rather than mal-e the attempt to supply
the value demanded If I h^ve been successful
so far, Mi Chairman, I have shown that this sjs-
tcm is injurious ii giving a f i e direct n to capi-
tal, which, if left to itself, woih1 seek those invest-
ments which had most uaturil advantages, and
which therefore would have paid the highest profits
I cone n >w ihen to the false an<! artificial
laws of expansion and contraction, which are in-
troduced into our currency and credit, (as I main-
tain) by ihe banking system as it exist  here In-
stead of leaving currencv and ere lit to the leguli-
tion of the gieat laws ordained bv natuic for that pur-
pose, instead of having tnem to that self-iesuHUng

tion of society and harmonise them with each other,

And even if this should not be tie case, the trad 
i i our currency bece- nes more profitable 'han that

be convenible into specie, which is of uaifoim
value everywhere The Constitution op this conn

when the pipei cunencv is puichased wi'h com-
modities, the holder seeits a redemption of t le

Mr Chiiimai, I refer to that p"tiod m the Eng-
lish his*oiy, when its paper cuireacv was sun
flated as to furnish to a fore gn entm}, the means
ofadiect attack upon i's credit ^vse -> It is

secret cause (as minv be icve) of the sn-jeas oi
of p>.cie pavmen s by that bank 11 17° í, a mea
sure which is said to  have been advised  by the
mn'atry itself I am greatly mistaken, sir, if t.u~
veiv trade moor cenenev has not been one of toe
leading caus s of our present distress But 1 will
not enter in o an inquiry wich would lead through
so w de a Peld of speculation I have thus endca-
v ored to show, sir, how this artificial connection be-
tween credit and cunency causes them to perform
that perpetual evele of contraction and expansion
from which our country Ins sufFeied so much and
so o'ten It ought not to surprise us then if these
vortices in our credit system, like tho e of the wild
theonst of antiquity, should produce strange combi-
nations and unexpected results The epicu'ean
philosopher accounted for the existence of the
world, by supposing it to result from the fortuitous
concouise of atoms, m these not ces and we, not at
all wiser, have attemp'ed to buildup a fabric of
credit upon a revolving foundation.
I have said, Mr Chairman, that the process
which I have just described is the result of an un-
natural connection between the credit and currency
systems It may be asked, in what respect is this
connection unnatuial1 Why, «u, in this we
make the cunency expand with the credit of the
countr} , when in tiuth, although credit musí ex-
pand when currency is increased, yet it may in-
crease when currency remains the same For in-
stance, if w e were suddenly to double the amount
of money in the world, the same real value m
credit must be douM d also in its nominal amouDt
But if the cunency remained the "ame, new re-
srnrces discovered m one coun'ry, making the em-
ploy ment of capital moie pi-ofitable there, might
íeadily draw a greater propomon of cunencv, as
a measme of value, than circulated there '«efore
the discovery Instead, then, of making the
cuirency and ciedit sjstems th" m ans of mu-
tual cxpanson, th'y ought to be left sepa-
rate When each is true in ihe el scharge
of its own functions, they vary according to
different laws and upon different principles Let u 
look for a moment to the functions of each sepa-
rately, for the purpose of ascettaimng the Hue
laws of their vanat on And here I first inquire
what is cuirencv'? It is that nominal and floating
standard, by which mankind have consented to
measure the value of their commodities, and to re-
gulate then exchanges To discharge these func-
tn ns, it must first be durable, so as not to be con-
sun- d m ihe use, sec >ndlv, it must be portable, so
as lo le transtcrifd conveniently fiom place to
pi ice, as the uses of exc íange may require, and,
thirdly, it must be uniform as a measure—by which
I mean that the proportion between the currency
and the material wealth of all coumnes should be
the 'ame, and to be a perfect measure of \alue,
t is proportion should not only be invariable in all
pine s, but in ?11 time from age to age The last
de derttum,asto uniformity from tune to time, has
neiei bepn supplied m practice or even suggested
in theory, but the first requisites are to bo found
hut li one medium—I mean the precious metals.
The , sir, are h gh'y durable, are portable, and if
not ohsii noted in their flow by artificial regulations,
which d stuib their level, their prop 'rtion to mate-
rial wealth will le tne same in every country, be-
cause the supply would be in propoition to
the demand, a nd as there womd be most demand
f r them wheie there was most material wealth, so
the supply wi nM also be greatest in those places.
It is a'so a manifest requisite in. currency, that it
should exist m sUir,cleni quantities to be available
ti -11 wno have a use for it, and doubts hare been
expiessed as to ihe existence of enough of the pre-
cious n < a's f( i the uses of money But these I
havea'wais t h ught unfounded It is obvious,
that from tuntti tune, even it the quantity re-
man-ii the same, it would appreciate m value so
g-idnlj as not to affect the mass of contracts
w inch ai  for short dates, by its change as a mea-
sure of v alne And if the relat on of debtor and
rr-ditor y ere not senou«ly affected b the change
it wiull le as convenient to use a half ounce of
si v cr m the dollar a? one ounce I'his change
would if itsslf present the moans of d mbhng the
iiiiiencv But if w p ttisfti of the one tion.
