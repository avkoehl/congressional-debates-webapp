He tho \%i t tha ar explanation of the ni ar ng f íet^irn^of
that portion of the Picnuent's Message which had been referred
to the Committee en Manufactures had been mistaken for an
expression of the views of aent'ernen beyond what they in-
tended He had heard it said that every body declaimed lay
ing a duty for protec ion, as if tney disclaimed the risht of do-
mgit He wished not to be mit.urderstood, he would not in-
jure any interest in this country, but on the''ontiary, his opi
nion was, that the great ínteres s of the othei j ursuits m our
country required the cons itutional view to b taken of the
lights of Congre^ which he and others entertained He held
that Congress has the powei, by the Constitution, to lay duties
for protection, that it may expressly prohibit the introduction
of an article deleterious to the nation, or m¡unous to us im
portant interests, or may subiect the article to a duty to protect
thenationor any <f itsimpoi'aftt mteiests from the effects of
too large an importation that in exerci3ing the power to lay
duties, and the power over commerce it may legislate directly
for the pi o ectton of American labov and property manufac
turms or othei, against adverse foreign competition or adverse
foreign legislation, that in this wise tho^epoweis were under
stoo i and exeiu&tdby the Mites prior to the Constitution, that
thub t íey weie transferí ed from the States to the General Go
\einment, and thru  exeici^ed by the General Government fiom
the beginning
At present therp scemel to be no occasion to legislate for
any leading object, exceptfor revet ue with that discrimination
which the Pitsideni hid alluded to with approbation Al
though that was tiie ftrt, jet thcic might be occasion to exer
cioP the power mlvMuit it the Constitutor! transferred from
the Mates to Congiess Tintsre&oluuon involved no supposed
distinction between revenue and protection 1 he mode it pro
posted for ascei taming ftcte mi„ht piove equally servicea

Tie gentleman fiom Aíarylanl [Mr W C Johnson] had
objected to the lesolution a ' amonsc othei things, said b«_
would not trust to the committee to make the investigation
if he suppo ed the omra tee tr ter ained pie'*i>liceivpd opi
nioiis, wouldhe'vvis 1 he Ho report actorditg to those opinions'?
Ot that they should be a owed to conett them if erroneous
and compart them with the opinions of oth rs, tobe obtained
under such forms an 1 sanrtmns as should guaranty lhat they
were simple truth? It struck him that the argument was in
favor of the resolution instead of bang against it He held it a
li tie unkind that because gentlemen had been selected for the
Committee on Manufactures it should thereioie be consideied
that they had their eyescl)& d to all other interests Every
committee was bounl to look into alt the mteiests of the
eountry This íe^olutmn shonl 1 bt, adopted because this
