HEADQUARTERS FIELD'S DIVISION,June 11, 1864.

Respectfully forwarded.

I earnestly recommend that some Texas and Arkansas regiments be brought from the Trans-Mississippi Department and assigned to this brigade. This brigade has fought too long and gallantly to be permitted to disappear from pure exhaustion of men. If several regiments from Texas were brought here, they would serve as a nucleus about which the absentees from the brigade could be collected and returned.

Major-General.

Lieutenant-General.

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA,June 11, 1864.

Respectfully submitted to the honorable Secretary of War, with the request that any Texas regiments, that can be spared from the Trans-Mississippi Department, as well as all the men belonging to Gregg's brigade in that department fit for duty, be sent to this army as soon as practicable. General Gregg cannot be spared from this army at this time, when every man is wanted at his post.

R. E. LEE,

General.

Respectfully returned to Adjutant-General.

It seems to me an efficient inspector had better be sent to the trans-Mississippi, with complete list of absentees and authority to enforce former orders to send them back, if necessary, under guard.

BRAXTON BRAGG,

General.
