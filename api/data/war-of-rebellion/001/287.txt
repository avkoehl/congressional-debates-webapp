[APRIL 6, 1861.]

Honorable ROBERT TOOMBS, Secretary, &amp; c., Montgomery, Ala.:

No change in the activity of the warlike armaments mentioned yesterday. The rumor that they are destined against Pickens and perhaps Sumter is getting every day stronger. We know nothing positive on the subject, but advise equal activity on your part to receive them if they come. We have not yet been notified of the movement, but the notification may come when they are ready to start.

CRAWFORD.

FORSYTH.

WASHINGTON, April 6, 1861.

Honorable A. G. MAGRATH, Charleston, S. C.:

Positively determined not to withdraw Anderson. Supplies go immediately, supported by naval force under Stringham if their landing be resisted.

MONDAY, April 8. - Sent by James E. Harvey by telegraph last Saturday morning.

CHARLESTON, April 6, 1861.

L. P. WALKER:

The following telegraph I have just received from Washington:

Positively determined not to withdraw Anderson. Supplies go immediately, supported by a naval force under Stringham if their landing is resisted.

A FRIEND.

Governor and General Beauregard visiting the posts in the harbor, and will not be here for a few hours. In their absence I telegraphed to Washington to know who was the person signing himself "A Friend." The reply satisfies me that the person is high in the confidence of the Government at Washington. Mr. Wigfall, who is with me, concurs in the propriety of giving you notice of it without delay.

A. G. MAGRATH.

WASHINGTON, April 6, 1861.

To Honorable A. G. MAGRATH, JAMES L. PETIGRU,

B. F. DUNKIN, and Miss S. C. HARVEY, Charleston, S. C.:

Order issued for withdrawal of Anderson's command. Scott declares it military necessity. This is private.

JAMES E. HARVEY.

Honorable A. G. MAGRATH, Charleston, S. C.:

Great efforts making to reconsider withdrawal, but will fail. Final consultation to-morrow.

JAMES E. HARVEY.
