WAR DEPARTMENT, C. S. A., Richmond, April 21, 1863.

General SAMUEL JONES, Dublin, Va.:

If Marshall's command is considered safe, you will exercise your discretion as to the disposition and movements of your troops. I am pleased not to have caused a derangement of your concerted movement with General Imboden.

J. A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF WESTERN VIRGINIA, Dublin, April 21, 1863.

Brigadier General W. G. M. DAVIS,Commanding, &amp;c., Knoxville, Tenn.:

GENERAL: The salt-works on the borders of Smyth and Washington Counties, in this State, are partly in your and partly in my department.

The most practicable approaches to them for the enemy were through the part of Southwestern Virginia in your department. The destruction of these works and the part of the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad within your department is so much to be desired by the enemy that it is more than probable they will attempt it.

I desire to co-operate with you in defending them, and to that end it is desirable that I should know the number and position of your troops in that part of Southwestern Virginia within your department, and also the force at Cumberland Gap, and who commands them. I will be obliged if you will give me this information.

It will afford me pleasure to give you any information you desire concerning my troops on the extreme left of my line.

I am, very respectfully, &c.,

SAM. JONES,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF WESTERN VIRGINIA, Dublin, April 22, 1863.

General S. COOPER,Adjutant and Inspector General, C. S. Army, Richmond, Va.:

I can send Jenkins with two, perhaps three, of his regiments to General Lee as soon as the horses are collected, which will be done as soon as possible. I will send these regiments under the impression that it is more important at present that Lee should have them than I should, and therefore make my plans yield to his.

SAM. JONES,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF WESTERN VIRGINIA, Dublin, April 22, 1863.

Colonel L. B. NORTHROP,

Commissary-General, C. S. Army, Richmond, Va.:

COLONEL: Will you please instruct your chief commissary at Staunton to hold in readiness 15,000 or 20,000 rations subject to my orders, to be sent to Millborough, or such other point as I may direct?
