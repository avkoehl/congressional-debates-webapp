NASHVILLE, December 14, 1864-8.30 a. m.

Admiral S. P. LEE,

Clarksville:

Your two telegrams of 4.30 p. m. and 8.30 p. m. yesterday are received. I have no doubt that the presence of your iron-clad at Clarksville prevented Lyon from moving up opposite that place and destroying the transports. General Meredith telegraphed me of the reconnaissance of your gun-boat up the Tennessee River. As I hear from all direction that Lyon has gone to Hopkinsville, I think the transports now at Clarksville could be convoyed down the river with perfect safety. Although not so stated in your dispatch, I infer from what you have said that Lyon's means of crossing the Cumberland have either been taken possession of or destroyed, and as I have a force after Lyon I have great hopes of capturing him.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding.

CLARKSVILLE, December 14, 1864-11 a. m.

Major-General THOMAS:

I am ready to give convoy down. Please say if convoy is required up, when, whether of freight or troops.

S. P. LEE,

Acting Rear-Admiral, Commanding Mississippi Squadron.

CLARKSVILLE, December 14, 1864-1.30 p. m.

Major-General THOMAS:

Yours received since mine of 11 a. m. Yesterday Lieutenant Naile saw the burnt wrecks of four steam-boats near Cumberland City, and captured one large barge on right bank there. Lyon has no visible means of recrossing. I cannot pronounce transports perfectly safe on a long, shoal, crooked, and narrow river, with high banks and hills, where a mounted enemy with artillery occupying the country is ready to attack them suddenly in different localities. our rifle-proof river steam gunboats can generally protect transports, but here is unavoidable risk in places in such convoys, especially to troops and cavalry, which ought not to be encumbered unnecessarily by the transports. The best plan is to capture the batteries, and I am glad to hear you have the means of preventing Lyon's stay or escape inland. Quartermaster here will not be ready until to-morrow afternoon.

S. P. LEE,

Acting Rear-Admiral, Commanding Mississippi Squadron.

NASHVILLE, December 14, 1864-8 p. m.

Admiral S. P. LEE,

Clarksville:

Your dispatch of 11 a. m. and 1.30 p. m. are received. I am of opinion that it would be best for the transports now at Clarksville to go down the river as soon as unloaded. Perhaps it would be well not to bring up any convoy from Smithland for the present, but let all
