All boats with supplies which are not required for the transportation of General Granger's troops will be sent up to Blakely. The boat which is commanded by the most careful and courageous master will take the lead, and the whole fleet will move cautiously.

Brigadier General J. BAILEY:

You are heartily welcome to lead the fleet of transports in person. It meets the general's wish, but he did not desire to reexpress it until you offered your services yourself. The transports will not start till day-light-ordnance, dry docks, everything will come up. I shall be happy to shake you by the hand again and take a drink on the glorious news which we receive from all quarters.

Always, truly, your friend,

C. T. CHRISTENSEN.

Your dispatch allowing me the privilege of taking the transports up in person is received. I am under many obligations for the privilege. Your orders will be attended to.

Respectfully, &amp;c.,

J. BAILEY,

Brigadier-General.
