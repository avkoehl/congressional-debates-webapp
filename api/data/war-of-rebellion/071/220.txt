Major-General COUCH:

The wires of the Independent Telegraph Company were cut about 5 o'clock this morning between Conowingo and Baltimore. Our line runs through Dublin and Bel Air, thence by the old Harford road to Baltimore. This would indicate that the rebels are making for the Gunpowder or the Conowingo bridge, or both.

Mayor HENRY, Philadelphia:

In answer to your telegram of last night the President directs me to say that the Government will accept the services of any patriotic citizens for such term as they may be disposed to offer, but cannot undertake to organize them. That must be done by the local authorities, while the Government will render any assistance in its power for arming, supplying, and transporting them to such points as they can be useful.

EDWIN. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.
