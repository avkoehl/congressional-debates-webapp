being re-enforced repulsed the enemy three times. When I reached the vicinity of Frederick, General Johnson was sent with his brigade of cavalry to cut the Northern Central and the Philadelphia and Baltimore Railroads, which he succeeded in doing, destroying very important bridge; the bridges over the Gunpowder Creek, on the latter road (two miles in length), having been burned by Major Gilnor, who was detached for that purpose with the Maryland Battalion. He also upturned and destroyed two passenger trains, in one of which he found Major-General Franklin, but he subsequently escaped by reason of the carelessness of his guards. Johnson also burned a small bridge on the road between Washington and Baltimore, and was on his way to Point Lookout when my determination to retire made his recall necessary. An immense amount of damage has been done the enemy. Our cavalry has brought off a very large number of horses. Over 1,000 have been brought off and $220,000 in money was levied and collected in Hagerstown and Frederick, the assessment against the latter being $200,000, all of which was paid in Federal and Northern money. I shall rest here a day or two, and shall then move to the Valley and drive from Martinsburg a body of cavalry which has returned there, and then send the cavalry to destroy effectually the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad westward, and also to destroy the coal mines and furnaces around Cumberland unless I get different orders. I am sorry I did not succeed in capturing Washington and releasing our prisoners at Point Lookout, but the latter was impracticable after I determined to retire from before Washington. There was intense excitement and alarm in Washington and Baltimore and all over the North, and my force was very greatly exaggerated, it being reported that you were in command, having left Beauregard at Petersburg. Washington can never be taken by out troops unless surprised when without a force to defend it. Please send me orders by telegraph to Winchester.

P. S.-I was compelled to leave about 400 wounded men in Frederick because they could not be transported.

Since writing the above your letter of 11th received. A part of enemy's force has followed up to the other bank of the Potomac, but I am unable to find out whether any infantry has come up. There is no effort to cross. Hunter has entirely passed Williamsport two or three days ago. I will start for the Valley in the morning. The arrival of the Ninth Corps in Washington is again reported, and there is a report that a part of Banks' force has arrived, but I do not place much confidence in these reports. I think perhaps the heavy artillery from the Ninth Corps has come. I will retreat in forced marches by land toward Richmond.

J. A. EARLY,

Lieutenant-General.
