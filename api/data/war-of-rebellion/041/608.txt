SIR: I have the honor to report everything quiet in this vicinity. It is reported, and, I think, from good authority, that three days ago a force about 3,000 strong crossed the Atchafalaya River and moved toward Plaquemine.

HEADQUARTERS DEFENSES OF NEW ORLEANS, June 30, 1863.

Major-General DIX,Commanding Department of Virginia:

I have sent, under command of Colonel Davis, First Texas Cavalry, some 500 prisoners, who are not safe at this place, and who cannot be sent to Baton Rouge, where they would be less secure. The enemy are in considerable force between that place and this. Colonel Davis will give you the state of things here. The only guard I can afford is 100 convalescents taken from the hospital, commanded by Colonel Davis and several convalescent officers.
