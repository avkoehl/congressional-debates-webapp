CHARLESTON, S. C., May 13, 1863.

Major General D. H. HILL, Goldsborough, N. C.:

Evans reports two brigades of enemy on Folly Island; but I don't think they will attack unless we weaken ourselves too much. It would be well, however, to prepare for the event.

G. T. BEAUREGARD.

WAR DEPARTMENT, C. S. A.,

Richmond, May 13, 1863.

Honorable W. PORCHER MILES, Charleston, S. C.:

Your several telegrams have been anxiously considered. Controlling necessity compels me to persist. I believe you safe. You will have a larger force than the enemy. Still I urge the organization of all citizens capable of bearing arms in Charleston and its vicinity. I make arrangements to re-enforce, if necessary, from Wilmington.

J. A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War.
