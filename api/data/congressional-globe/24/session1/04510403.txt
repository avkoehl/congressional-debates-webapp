then negatived without a count.
Mr. HAWES then moved a proviso, that not
more than one half the commissioned officers of
said resriment should be taken from the commis-
sioned officer* of the army; which was disag reed
to.
Mr. CHAMBERS, of Kentucky, proposed the

was disagreed to:
Tu t the  listing regiment of dragoons shall be Increased
to £:o number of twelve hon<lr*d, aad that th< «ompanies
■ball consist of not more than one hundred men each.
Sir. WHITTLESEY moved to amend the
seventh section by adding,after the word " rifle-
men," the following words?
Tf. hi his opinion, the security of the Western frontier
««quires the organization of said regiment;
and after a few remarks from Messrs. WHIT.
TLESEY, MERCER, ASHLEY, HARRISON
of Missouri, and WHITE, at the suggestion «f
the latter getáreman—
Mr. WHITTLESEY modified his amendment
by extending it to the " western or southern frtsf-
tiers."
The amendment was negatived without a count. ;
Mr. MERCER moved to strike out the follow- !
ing words in the seventh section: " fbr the like ¡
term, and," on the ground that they were an in-
congruity with  Other parts of the bih*;.which,
after some  remarks from  Messrs. MERCER,
THOMSON of Ohio, ASHLEY, and THOMP- ¡
SON of South Carolina, was lost.     '                    !
The question recurrin* or  concurring with tÜe
Committee of the Whole in their proposed amend-
ment—
Mr. MERCER called for a division ofthe que**
lion on the two additional sections     '
The question was then taken «athe fast branch
of the amendment, being the seventh section of
bill-,and it was concurred ia by the House—ayes
144, noes 32.
The question recurring upon the second branch
 f the amendment, beinz the eighth section—      j
Mr.UNDERWOOD uuived to amend the same,
by inserting after the word " enacted," the fol-
iowingt" that the1 President of the United States
may disband said regiment whenever, m his
opinion, the public interest no longer requires its
services."                                                         > ■
Mr. H ANN6GAN asked forth* yeas and nays

arithout a division.
Mr, THOMPSON, of Sswih Carolina, nwred
to strike out from the first section of the bill the
following words: " in cases enumerated in the i
eighth section of the Constitution;" and insert: j
" in cases of Indian hostilities, or good cause to j
Apprehend the same."                              ....             j
The CHAIR decided the motion to be out of I
order, on the ground that toe passage proposed
to be stricken out had been voted in by the
"House.
Mr. CHAPÍN proposed an amendment to the
first section of the bill—(hat is, to restrict the clause
which continued the act in force for two years ,
from the end of the present session «/Congress,
and no longer, to so rrrucli of the set as rentes to
volunteers,   Mr. C. Supported the aifceidment <3íi
the ground that, as the bill now stood, there was
a manifest incongruity between the erst section,
rehttrtjg to volunteers, and the seventh section,
providing for the raising of a regiment of dra- I
goons, or mounted riflemen. That regim* t,w lion I
raised, was to be engaged for the same1 tens with !
the dragoons now m service, which wis «iree
years; but .the first section liiniteid lUeopéraüos !
«at «fee set to two-years.   The sections, tnarefsre,
contained an rtieowgruity, which it Was the object
of the amendment, to Temove.                               ,
