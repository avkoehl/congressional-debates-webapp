Colonel JOHN MCCAUSLAND,

Near Piney:

COLONEL: The major-general commanding has just received your note of the 22nd instant.

General Echols has been ordered to push forward a reconnaissance in the direction of Gauley, in the hope of thus relieving you. Should it not succeed, and should you be too hard pressed by the enemy, you must fall back.

Two companies of the Eighth Virginia Cavalry have been ordered to report to you immediately, and also Major Hammond's battalion.

Your supplies have been sent to Pack's Ferry.

Very respectfully, colonel, your obedient servant,

CHAS. S. STRINGFELLOW,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

SCHOCCO SPRINGS, N. C.,

May 25, 1863.

General R. E. LEE:

DEAR GENERAL: Your kind letter of the 20th received, in which you proposed to assign me to the command of the Valley of Virginia.

I hank you for the honor you would confer. I hesitate to incur so great a responsibility, after the brilliant achievements of General jackson in that district, but as I know the country well, having been in his command last year, I will hope, by diligence and zealous effort, and with the favor of Divine Providence, for success under such orders as I may receive.

Very truly, yours,

I. R. TRIMBLE.
