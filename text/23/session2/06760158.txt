THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
January 24,
' which shall be established by law, but the Con-
' giess may by law vest the appointment of such
' inferior officei s, as they think piopei, in thePresi
'dent alone, m the courts tf law, or in the heads
* of depaitments "
Here, then, the whole apoomting power was
vested in the Piesidont of the United States and
the S-nate, with ceitam except ons—those therein
otherwise pioviued for, and which shad be estab
li hed by law, &c 11Is, then, was all the control
that the Legislature, or rather this branch of it, had
over the appointing power, to " c hoose their own
officers, 'and to " vest the appointment of such
u ferior officers as they think proj. ei in the Pieb-
ldent alone, ¡n the courts uf law, c r in the heads
of departments " I hey might cieate such offices
as they should deem necessa y, or think proper,
but the moment the ( ffi e us It nas cieeliteel, the
powei of nominating to, or fi ling up that office,
became vested in the Piesidentot the United States
l«y and with the advice and cone nt of the Senau,
unless the? shall see fit to vest ihem in the oth r
way laid down in the clause, but they nad no
powei, no authority to vest the appointment in
themselves Mi F fuuhermore thought that ti e
distinction taken ill the Cons Hu ion between i fi
c rs of the body and * ffieers of tie na ion, wi5
f inly, clearly, and distinctly marked out i hey
h id, undei the Constitution, thepo^ ei ot app >mt
mg officers for that specific body, but none otherj
whatsoever
Mr F sipiosed that the fact would not be dis-
guised that the olject of tne present resolution
was, to reach what was said to be an officei of the
Hcusf—not the Speakei, Seigeant nt Arms or
nies°engeis, but the primer We rrny as well,
tor, ( aid, Mi F ,) come to it at once, and disruss
t ie mat er fun ly, and openly , and eat didly Now,
t le fiist question that urose on this sul ject would
be, (if the olject of the resolution be to nfle (t
t us ip| ointmet t in iny way ) lo n qme wnethei
lhe printer of that House was oí w is not, in the
Hue acceptation and meant! gof the e-ni, an ( ffi
c ei of that House lhiawas a very impoitaiit
inquiry The question was agitated, he believed,
during the last session of Congiess, and it his
lecolleuion seived him aright, there was a strong
party who thought he was not ai efficer, and
anothei who thought he was Tiom the best in
vesication he had been able to give, and he had
spared neithei diligence not reflet ion, he confessed
his own >ipiession was, that the printei of tie
I louse of Representatives was not mi ofiirer either
of the Go vein men t or of that body It might be
somewhat diTic It to di fine what was necessuy to
constitu e an e ill ti, and to draw a d t net on, 
give such t dtfinmon,as should in all cases de ei
mine what was an ohVei but he would endeavni
to give, as biitfly as possibl , the ieas ms why he
ouldnot regaiei the Individ nil < lint gel with the
( ongress punting as an ííi ei In the fust p! ice,
Mr F did i ot fi id thai he to k any oath of i ÍU e
win h was the practice with nil othei efiiceis ct
the G ivernment appointed in the usual manner j
'Ihere was nothing in the law authorizing the
House to employ a public printer which icqui'cd
an oath of office to be administered tothat mdiv d
ual when employed Oi the eoitiiiy, he did
find that, after th°y nad ties glinted a person to
i he employment, if he shoull tail in the peifoim
anee ot the work, they might employ any othei
person, who might enter into a <ontrict,and be
paid forsuch work as should be executed by him
Again the word " employ "wi  made use of ir the
law, and not " appoin*," as if therel v to ie aul
the printer ti a light different from the officers of
the House
Bat perhaps the best distinction drawn between
the contractor and the oft er of the Government
or of the House, and which showed that the dis
Unction was designed by the frameis of the law,
was this, that there was not a solitary case in any
depattment of the Government wherein an officei
had not the power of resignation, whereas a con-
tractor was bound to the perfit mince of his con
tract, as was the case with  the punter  of the
House     He had to give secuiity foi the due and
faithful perfoi manee of his contrae t, but could not
himself fix the term of hu services by resigna
Hon     If they employed a peison to build a caii
tol or any other work, it was lmnmteual how he
was designated, he was ipso farto a contractor
and nothing else The mode of his ree- gnation
would rot of it_elf constitute him an officer of the
House B cause the House had the puwer to de
sígnate the person with whom it won't! contract
for certain services, suiely no one would conte id
that that was sufficient to constitute in officei An
appointment to an office, as he said before, nevei
deprived an individual of the eight of tendeuug
his resignation, but would any one pieiend to say
that weie that ll< use to enter into a rontiact with
a perbon to punt, that that person could lesi'ii
the contract? Mi F thought not The individ-
ual in question would stmd in the relation and
capacitv of a contractor to that body, without
hiving had conferred upon him the particulai
character that created h in an officei We have
ontracttd with him to perfoim certain services,
and we nolo him to then peifoimanee by ceitain
stipulated ooligations wl ich may be enforced in
the oidmaiy courts of law
Cut suppose, ( aid Mr   F ,) that he w-s mis
take i, and that the f rn ter to ti t House of Rep
esentatives be in leahty an  r fiicei of the G  v
ernment or of th it bx'y, could  we  ippoint him
for the next Confess >   Most cleaily not     If we
ad   p.. the tule, they will act upon it, and as they
have the ¡ owei to el), wi'l elec   then own i fnce s
and make their own rculatitns     We cainotM >
it foi them, ind should be ti itiscendmg our povv

tution had taken it out of oui powe-i, for it say,
" the House of Repiesentat ves shall choose i! ei
Speaker and other ofkeis,"aiid if this House had
the powei to cnoo«e their puntei   legan  ru him
in the 1 ght of an ifiici.so would  the next, fui

The Constitution had vested in  each House ihe
power  of appointing lis own ofiicers, and if its
puntei   be an officei, it is out of oui   power to
adopt any rule, the cfiict of which  would be to
take the appointment oí eleeuon out of the hands
ot the next     It might be well, however, to adveit
to the power by wh oh we contiae'etl with t per
son to execute the public printing, and it would
be found that it waspiovided for by a joint rest lu
tion, of 1819, which received the sanction of both
Houses of Congress, and the appioval of the Pres
lelenl ot the United States     Now , if we intended
to altei the mode theiein laid down, n wni Id  be
necessaiy fust to revoke or to leped that resolu
tion, and entct a new one, in the usual foim and
manner, for nothing less than the whole legislative
power  of the  nation  could   effect   the   change
What were the piovisions  of   that  instrumen
Fust, it piovidedfoi the mannei in winch the print
ing should be executed     2J   for the prices, 31
for ihe manner of pel foi ni g the press woik, and
4 h    the mannei in which  the peison   *o   he em
ployed should be elected      The  last part of the
lesoiution  w s to the  following pirpoit—that as
soon as it should it ceive the approval of the Pres
ident of the United State , each  House  should
proceed to billot foi apnntei, to execute the woik
dm ing the next Congre s, and the person having
the gieatest numbei  of votes, shall be considered
elected, &c    Now, then, if the person thus to be
employed, he an rfficer of that H >u e, by vntue
of ihat resolution, then it was to Mi   F  incmtio
vertible, that they could not appoint him for the
next Congiess     If,  howe'Ver, he be iegard«d as
an officer of the nation, then had th,e Constiiutton
vested the power in  the President of the United
•Ütates, by and with the advice and consent of the
Senate    Take either horn of the dilemma, and the
d fficulty was lnsuimountalle     The only author
ity by and uider which one Congress could ap-
point for the ensuing one was to regaid the prmtei
as the contiactor fci   the perroi manee of reilam
services, and by legislative authority to enter into
a contract with him, and enfmce its observance in
a court of justice, shouhl he f«tl therein
With this view of the subject, (said Mi P in
conclusion,) and conceiving it a mattei in which we
have a right to exercise our own judgment and
discretion, so far as the election of our own offi
cers is concerne), and believing that the piactice
of almost all legislative bodies aie at variance with
the proposed mode, and that there is no íeason
for changing the i ule, I shall feel myself compelled
to vote asmn-t 'he sdoption of the resolution
Mr REYNOLbS said, the lesoiution which he
| had offered to the Hou.e some time since, was as
j follows
"Re ohed, That hereaf er in a'l elections made
' by the 11 iut,eof Rf| i°ser tallves foi officers, the
! ' votes shall be given i>« ivce, tttch memoermhis
' place naming a'oud the person foi whom he
' totes "
I     Mr R  observed that he had not the leas  m-
I tentionot producing any excitement when he had
the honoi to offer this proposition for the consider-
ation of 'h s House, and he sincerely hoped thit
none should be now cieated uy it He was not
himself considered at home i violei t party man,
and he condemned excessive party excitement,
either at home or abioad
lh" gent'ernan fio.n New York [Mr Fiil-
nopt] uiged in this discussion Mr It's motives
in piesennng thi3 resolution He stated them
to be to operate on the elect on of public puntei
In this allegation, Vlr R observed, tha'his fi lend
'rum New Yoik [Mi F ] was entnely mistaken
tie did not now entertain any great feeling or
interest about the election of a public printer, and
at the time be introduced the resolut on, he did
not even know there was one to be elected at tins
session oí Coi gress He had nothing to do with
the election ot a public punter, and did not care
on whom,oron whatpnuters, the reso'ution would
operate
M R observed that he* moved it because it
was the rule of action of the repiesentatives in
the State of Illinois, in whi"h he lived, and had
the ho lor to íeprescnt in [ art, t.nd it was adopted
w hen he had the honor to be in the Degislatuie ot
that S ate, and that it was the republican rule in
evety lepiesentative body This was the reason
he offtied it, and on these principles he hoped it
would be sustained by the Hou e, consequently,
the bur hen of the song't f*-the gentleman from
New York—the election of a puuhc pun er—was
out of the question It could not in fact be dis-
cussed on the proposition wh.eh is now befoie
the House " Sufficient unto the day is the. evil
theieof " Let the alstract pimciple be once
established, let the republican rule be adopted,
and then let it opeiate on preachers, speakers,
punters, and all ofiicers of the Elouse on whom
it ought to opeiate     Do right in all cases, and let
I the consequences piovide loi themselves
Mr R temarked that, as his motives and the
election of public puntei weie disposed of, he
would bring to the consideration of the Hou«e
pa t of the fifth «ee ion of the first a-ticle of the
Constitution of the United States, which he read
as follows
" Each House shall keep a Journal of its pro-
' ceedings, and from timeto time publish the same,
' excepting su h parts as may in the r judgment
' require secrecy and the yeas and navs of the
' membeis ot eithei House on any question shall,
' at the desire of one fifth of those present, be
' enteied on the Journal "
I his is the tule of action in all cases when it
is applicable It is the supreme law of the
hnd
The object of this part of the Constitution wt>s
to preserve a record of the proce-edings of Con
gress, and to give them publicity to the people
This i« expiessly reqjired on all questions in the
proceedings of Congress, where one fifi1 of the
members desne it No member of this House
will contend that an electirn is no question It
is the most lmportint question, frequently, to
members of Congress, of any that could be agi-
tated
Mi   R «aid, he recollected well !a st summer it
wosan impoitantquestion to your humbleservant
He appeared often on the "stump" before his
\ consti uents, and each patty, candidate and con
stituent, took it for granted that it was a quethon
Is not the election ot a public printer a question
al«o' There is too much discussion about it in
this Houseforitto be no question Some may say
thtt the rule of action under the provisions of the
i Constitution has been, for a long lime, different,
and ought not nemo to be changed fiom this mode
of balloting
I He considered the nnnciple to be just that,
whenever we found an enor to exist in our pro-
ceedings, if those proceedings were as old as
Jeiusa'em, we should change them
