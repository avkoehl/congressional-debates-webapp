Treasury Note Bill—Mr. Montgomery.
H. of Reps.
I have said, Mr. Chairman, that we wanted mo-
ney to pay our army, our navy, our civil and di-
plomatic expenses, as well as our laborers, many
of whom have been discharged  from  service in
consequence of the exigency of the times; which
I have clearly shown have been brought on us by
the conduct of the banks and their Whig allies.  In
this House, as well as elsewhere, I wish to see the
just and honest debts of the Government paid. We
must provide the means in some way, and   if
thess good Whigs, who voted for the creation of
these just debts, that now press us, are, as they de-
clare they are, determined that not a single dollar
shall be provided in this bill to pay them, but will
let bankruptcy and disgrace fall on our country,
which is daily threatened, let them vote against it,
and against their country; let the people see who
are willing to sustain and support the Government,
its honor and its credit, and who refuse to do so.
I am a Treasury note man, and always have been.
I have no constitutional scruples about their issue;
none whatever.   When we want money, and have
to borrow and pay interest, I am for paying that in-
terest to those to whom we owe the mon«y, if they
will take our paper in Treasury notes.   For in-
stance, we owe our farmers, our sailors, our sol-
diers, and laborers on our public works; and we
owe our mechanics for whatever they supply the
Government with.   We must pay all these public
creditors, and upon the amount necessary to pay
them, we must pay interest.   Now I greatly prefer
paying them this interest, to paying it to   your
banks, your brokers in Wall or Chestnut streets,
or to the rich capitalists in Europe, the Rothschilds,
the Barings, the Hottinguers, and others.   Yes,
sir, I like our own poor honest farme. s, soldiers,
sailers, laborers, mechanics, «fee. &c. vastly better
than bankers, or those money shavers on Pennsyl-
vania avenue, or in New York, Philadelphia,  Eu-
rope, or elsewhere, who feed like vampyres, on the
blood of the productive  classes.   When we are
compelled to give our paper on interest, the con-
stitutional principle is the same, whether you pay
it on % 160 to ten different men, or to one man, or
whether you pay it to ten farmers or laborers on
$1,000, or to a bank or one of these money shavers
on the same amount.   I know that this paper is
the best paper that the people «an hold, and I de-
sire to furnish the honest laborers with the very
best.   If a loan is made by a bank, or any of their
agents, and they agree (as they always do) to pay
the checks of the Secretary of the Treasury in spe-
cie, when  the holders present them, the  banks,
by some of their trickery and management, will
pay ont their own, or some other bank paper, and
thus put into circulation bad paper, without inte-
rest, in lieu of the good  United States Treasury
notes, with interest.   Therefore those who vote for
large bills, vote to promote the interest of banks
and capitalists, by throwing these good notes notes
with- interest into their hands, while their depie-
ciated bank paper, without interest, is thrown into
the hands of the honest and industrious laboring
elasses.   Is this   not as  clear  and as plain as
yonder sun at noonday?   I am well aware, Mr.
Chairman, that upon (his subject, I differ with many
of my best Democratic friends, but we cannot always
agree, and each must think and act for himself
without quarrelling with those who differ with htm.
1 am sorry to differ with my friends, but in this
matter I have greatly the advantage of all who do
not agree with me, by being right while they are
wrong.    My people want good paper, (if any
must circulate,)  that will   buy lands,   and   pay
tares in the West, without discount, or their sub-
scriptions in New York oi elsewhere  for   their
newspapers or other transactions, without being
subjected to a shave with a magnum bonum razor
by a New York or any other broker.   I am aware
that the Federal Bank Whigs will say. " why did
you put down the Bank of the United States?   I
answer that the people put it .down, because it was
the credit of the United States, and not its ability to
pay in specie, that passed the paper of that Bank,
for it always was a bankrupt concern, if stripped
of Government credit, which fact has been proved
by the withdrawal of that credit, and the sudden and
acknowledged total and permanent bankruptcy of
the corporation.   Do gentlemen want foreigners to
speculate on our credit? I, and my people, wish the
Government credit to be used through the medium
of Treasury notes, (when it must be used,) and not
by stock gamblers, for the speculating purposes of
an association of American and European capi-
talists, bankers, and money shavers. I wish it to
be used for the benefit of the honest and indus-
trious laboring people of the country, and there-
fore hope that my amendment for the issue of $10
notes will prevail.

The following is the account carrent as it stands
with the North Carolina delegation in the 25th
Congress, upon the appropriation bills. They stood
five Democrats and eight Opposition Whigs at that
time. The nays, as recorded on the journal, of
each, is given upon the final passage of the appro-
priation bills, with the number of the bill and the
page in the journal where they passed; where
the yeas and nays are not taken, it is a
unanimous vote; and at Raleigh, the seat
of Government in my district, I have de-
posited the bound journal, that reference may
be had to prove all that I have said and pub-
lished; for I regret to admit the fact that, in my
own State, modern Whigery not only denies re-
corded facts, but proclaims and vouches for that
which is precisely the very opposite of recorded
facts and truth; for on the eve of the last Congres-
sional election, a forgery, of the blackest dye, was
issued from a Federal press in Raleigh, sent
all over my district by expresses, with the certifi-
cate of five volunteer, or willing witnesses, as a
passport, and the name of one of them is now ene
of the Whig Harrison electors, (Charles Manly,
esq. of Raleigh, N. C.) and is canvassing the dis-
trict by speeches of the lowest abase against this
Administration.
