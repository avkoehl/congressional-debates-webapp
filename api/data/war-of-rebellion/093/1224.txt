General S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General, Richmond, Va.:

General Wheeler telegraphs from Griffin, on 17th, that enemy are turning their columns on shortest route to Macon, and scouts from enemy's rear report Fourteenth Corps crossed Chattahoochee to join Sherman, giving him four corps. This information has been communicated to General Hood. It is left optional with him to divide and re-enforce Cobb, or take the offensive immediately to relieve him.
