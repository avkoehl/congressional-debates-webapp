in the two statements referred to by the gentleman
from Massachusetts. The error is entirely in
himself, in confounding the products of one ot the
armories, with the aggregated products of both.

ry. I am looking: at the system as a whole, and
presenting its results. I say,then, taking the prod-
ucts of the two national armories, the aggregate
of guns fabricated during the ten years of civil
administration was 235,410, and during the ten
years at the military, 232,710; showing an excess
under the civil, of 2,701) guns.
But the gentleman from Massachusetts, who
looks with a fond and somewhat partial feeling
upon the Springfield armory, may say that by
these aggregated results, 1 do injustice to the north-
ern establishment, and that the result of a com-
parison of product during ten years of civil, and
ten years of military rule at Springfield, will show
an excess of product during the latter:
Product in ten years of military 137,794
Product in ten years of civil..   127,876
Excess in favor of military  9,918
This is all true, sir. But look at the enormous
difference of expenditure during the same periods
at Springfield:
Expenditures during ten years of
military 2,013,289 87
Expenditures during ten years of
civil 1,769,700 00

Thus exhibiting ail exeess of expenditure of
nearly one quarter of a million of dollars, and an
excess of product of less than ten thousand mus-
kets and musketoons! Does my friend from Mas-
sachusetts regard these results as furnishing any
ground for boasting of the operations of the Spring-
field armory ?
Mr. DAVIS. I ask the gentleman whether, out
of that nearly a quarter of a million of dollars,
there is not to be taken out the cost of altering a
hundred and sixteen thousand old muskets into
the new form ?
Mr. FAULKNER. Sir, it is impossible for
me to examine these expenditures, within the short
time allowed me, in all of their minute details. 1
can only look at general results. I am allowed
but a single hour to present the subject before this
House in its various statistical, economical, and
moral aspects, and 1 must be pardoned if 1 cannot
permit myself to be drawn from the course of ar-
gument which I think best calculated to enlighten
the committee.
Mr. DAVIS. I will only ask this simple ques-
tion, and I trust I shall not trespass upon the
gentleman's courtesy again. I desire to know
whether he undertakes to show, taking out the
cost of altering these one hundred and sixteen
thousand muskets, that the excess in the appro-
priations for the Springfield armory was what he
now states ?
Mr. FAULKNER. I repeat to the gentleman
that his inquiry would involve the necessity of an
examination of these expenditures in all their de-
tail—an examination from which 1 would not
shrink if I had time to pursue it, and do justice to
other views of this subject.
I have thus shown the general results of the two
! systems, in their expenditures and products. I will
1 now examine the cost of the musket under the two
systems. 1 have shown that there has been nearly
one million of dollars of special appropriations
1 within the last ten years. The main purpose
of this expenditure has been to cheapen the cost of
the production of the arms, and much of it has
been expended on new machinery fpr that pur-
pose. The standing vaunt of the present system
is, that it has reduced the cost of the production of
the musket, and upon this it boldly challenges a
continuance of public favor.
From the ordnance report, we learn that the aver-
age cost of the musket at the two armories during
the last year was: at Springfield $8 75, at Har-
per's Ferry $9 99J, making an average of $9 37.
This is the superintendent^ estimate of the cost
of the musket. Upon what principles and data
does he make his estimate? We do not know.
If we did, we might most materially differ from
him in opinion as to the elements entering into the
fair cost of the musket. Does he estimate the
cost to the Government upon the same principle
that a private capitalist would estimate the cost to
himself? Is there any allowance for wear and
tear of machinery?for capital invested? foT su-
perintendent's salary, &c., &c.? Sir, these sort of
estimates are no criterion for the judgment and
action of this body, as I shall hereafter endeavour
to show. But concede the fact that the average
price of a musket in 1852 costs the Government
but $9 37, is it fair to take the cost of one or two
years to test the relative merits of two systems?
Let us take the two systems for a series of years,
and see what has been the average cost of each.
In House document 207, page 23, Twenty-seventh
Congress, second session, we have the price of the
musket under the civil system, for a period of
eighteen years, from 1822, inclusive, to 1840.
We find that the musket in no year during this
time exceeded $11 84, and in 1829 was as low
as $10 02; making an average during those eigh-
teen years of $11 15. I have now before me a
statement of the cost of the musket from 1841 to
the present time, and the average cost I find to be
$11 14j. In this estimate I have excluded the
cost of 1840 from the civil, and of 1841 from the
military period, for reasons obvious to all ac-
quainted with the subject. Here, then, we have
the same average cost of the musket under the
civil and under the military system.
Mr. DAVIS. Now, I ask the gentleman, in all
fairness, whether he intends to draw any argument
from that? Is it not true that the new musket
costs five or six dollars more than the old one?
The gentleman knows that the cost of the new
muskets is twenty-eight per cent, more than the
old ones, and I ask in all fairness whether, if the
gentleman is to make this comparison, he should
not make a proper allowance for the difference of
the articles manufactered ?
Mr. FAULKNER. The gentleman is now
yielding his claim of greater cheapness, and is
falling back upon the indefinite pretension of a
superior manufactured article. Upon this latter
point there will be a variety of opinions; but if
" allowances" are to be claimed as entering into
this comparative estimate of costs, let the gentle-
man from Massachusetts reflect upon the following
elements of calculation in the price of the gun
under the present and former system:
1st. Under the civil system, the superintendent's
salary was charged to the price of the musket.
Now it is paid from your public Treasury,and no
account of it. •
2d. The substitution of the percussion for the
flint lock has alone reduced the cost twenty-five
cents on every musket.
3d. The diminished cost of coal, iron, and steel,
or certainly the diminished cost of freighton those
articles to the armories. Coal, under the civil
system, at Harper's Ferry, cost seven dollars per
ton. It can now be delivered there for three dol-
lars or three dollars and twenty-five cents.
Again: we are told by the gentleman from Mas-
sachusetts himself, and I cheerfully concede the
fact, that the reduced cost of labor upon each mus-
ket, in consequence of the extensive and costly
machinery introduced, is $3 87! Now make a
due "allowance " for all these considerations, and
then see how far the present system can claim any
advantages in cheapening the musket over the
former system. I think there is not a gentleman
who hears me who will not accord the meed of
greater cheapness and economy to the civil system,
when all things are justly weighed.
So far I have been considering the cost of the
musket upon the basis of the superintendent's esti-
mate of that cost; but will this House, in such an
inquiry as the present, be satisfied with any such
estimate ? You want to know the cost of the mus-
ket to the Government under the two respective
systems. How is this to be attained to your sat-
isfaction but by ascertaining the whole expendi-
ture at these armories for a given period—say ten
years—then ascertaining theproduct in arms, and
yeu thus see, not what a superintendent tells you
that a musket costs you, but what your Treasury
records tell you that it has cost you. When Cap-
tain Maynadier, a distinguished officer of the Ord-
nance Department, was examined as a witness on
the trial of Colonel Ripley, as to the cost of the
musket at the national armories, he said:
" In making this comparison, I have taken no superin-
tendent's estimate of the cost of muskets made under his
administration, but I have determined it for myself on the
basis of the money ipent and the arms made."
Now ] apprehend this is the basis upon which
this House will determine that question for itself—
the money spent and the arms made. Let us see
the results upon this principle of calculation. The
expenditures during the last ten years of the civil
system at Harper's Ferry was $1,990,697 03;
