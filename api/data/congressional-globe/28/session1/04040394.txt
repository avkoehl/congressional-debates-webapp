The Tariff—Mr. J. A.

fluences, the woollens of Germany sell readily for
twice their cost; and many cotton fabrics of Eng-
land, together with bar iron and hardware, in the
same proportion. And the farmer of the West
will find that, in buying his bolt of domestic cotton
afid other substantial articles, that they will cost him
from 25 to 50 per cent, more than they did twelve
irionths since. The effect has been, and will still
be, increased importations during the year, and sales
of foreign goods will take place at such a price as
will meet cost and the duty; but who will pay that
cost* and duty? I answer-—as all men must—the
consumer. Another effect of all this: that the price
of factory stock has raised to 100 per cent, above
What it was a year ago, and set thousands to build-
ing new factories. Well, let us follow the process
through: when the manufacturers strain every
nerve, and foreign goods come crowding in, what
will happen? Unless speedily checked by a modifi-
cation of {he tariff, I answer that prices will fall;
the importer must quit the market; the hotbed man-
ufacturing establishments must die xmder the un-
healthy action of a forced state of things; bankrupt-
cies will follow; an organized system of smuggling;
and if a few years should roll around before this ca-
tastrophe happen, and the time be sufficient for the
ball to gather largely, we may look for another re-
vulsion which would carry distress and misery
throughout the whole country. How are we to
avoid this state of things? is the question that all
m'en of reflection are willing to ask, and desire to
have answered.
Well, we have determined, that, so far as the cur-
rency of the country is connected with legislation,
from the past, the lesson we have learned has satis-
fied us that these institutions of banking by the gov-
ernment, in every way and manner, or by associ-
ations, that they are only calculated to give sud-
den expansions in business, causing inflation of
prices, and sudden depression of labor. In a
word, the American people have decided, and will
again, whenever the question is presented to them,
that they are the open enemies of their peace, com-
fort, aha happiness.
Mr. DICKINSON, of Tennessee, remarked that
they (the whigs) were still for a bank.
Mr. WRIGHT replied, we shall see what we
shall see at the Baltimore convention on that subject
by you.
Is this not the same principle of associated wealth
for evil,- thrown in another directioin—having the
same poioer under another name? And this name is
beautiful; it is called that endearing name, Amer-
ican system! But the question is still unanswered,
how "are we to avoid these things? these sudden
rises and expansions^ and those sweeping calamities
that follow—reduction of prices, prostration of all
credit, and the labor of the country being at the mercy
of the capitalists? I answer, in no other way but by a
moderate and settled system of revenue duties, which
would act equitably upon all parts of the country,
and leave every pursuit to be regulated by those
laws of trade and investment, that, m the freest action
of the American mind, under a just and impartial
system of legislation, finds its best condition.
Such a system will not astonish us at one time
with a rapid income into the treasury, and leave us
at other times wholly minus. One system will sup-
port the government and give no just cause of com-
plaint to any portion of our happy Union. The other,
irregular, fitful as the wind in its operation, will dis-
turb the tranquillity of the nation, and leave the
country encumbered with debts, to be paid probably
by a direct system of taxation!
I have said the tariff would have an effect to in-
crease the prices. I ask why such investments of
capital as are making in new manufacturing establish -
ments, and in. enlarging old ones? Do not the cap-
italists expect more than they did under the former
tariff? If so, how are they to get it? The answer
U obvious. If they have no such expectations, why
did they not make investments under the former
tafciffr or why do they, with one accord, oppose the
reduction of this? What I say on this subject is—
1st. Thatitis absurd to say that the manufacturers
will be benefited by a tariff which compels them to
sell at cheaper rates; that it is only equal to the sen-
timent of the coal merchant, who said "he lost on
every bushel of coal he sold, but made up his losses
by selling a very great quantity."
2d.. That the-tariff of 1842 is not the sole cause
of the importations of such amounts of specie.
3d, Whatever agency it may have had in the in-
flux-of specie, has been a consequence of its pre-
history character, 3
4th. The first effect will be to raise the price of
5th. This will excite both imports and manufac-
tures. The result will be a fall of prices, the bank-
ruptcy of manufacturers, and the distress of the
country.
6th. If the tariff continue as it is, after such a re-
vulsion, we might expect such a state of prices as
to amount to prohibition or a permanently fixed in-
crease of price at that point at which the foreigner
might come m, and supply part of the market, the
duty on which would go into the treasury, while
the country would pay a corresponding price for
all similar articles, domestic or foreign, which might
enter into our consumption.
7th. That it is foolish to say a high tariff, intend-
ed to exclude or diminish competition from abroad,
can increase competition; for this very simple reason,
that a part cannot be greater than the whole.
8th. If the duty reduces the price, the maufac-
turer must be in favor of abolishing all duties; be-
cause his goods would, according to this logic, ad-
vance in consequence; but these fellows take special
pains to be exclusively friendly to the manufac-
turers by high taxation laws, and not by reducing
the duties.
But let us locik at the operation of the bill of 1842,
and compare the same with the compromise act of
1832—the rate of duties collected since 1834. The
following table has been furnished me by the Treas-
ury Department:

ing duty imported, and the amount of duties which

*1843 includes the 4th quarter oi 1842, and the 1st and 'id
of 1843—all under the tanft act of 184-2.
It will be seen that there is quite a sudden rise of
the rates of duties from 26 per cent, ad valorem in
1842, to 36 per cent, in 1843, and yet but twenty-
nine millions of imports, and ten millions of revenue
realized in three-fourths of a year under this bill;
but this is not the question that I desire to approach.
Let us look to the articles that the duties are collected
on under this bill. Upon what class of our people
does it rest? Does it rest upon the wealth of the
country, the proper place for all systems of taxation
to rest? or does it rest upon the labor of the country?
I have had furnished me by the Treasury De-
partment, the duties collected on the following ar-
ticles, under the present bill, during the three quar-
ters of 1843, their value, &c.

Prom these facts before us, in an authentic shape,
it appears that $29,179,215 of dutiable goods import-
ed under this tariff, brought in revenue to the
amount of #10,544 13, and that $7,281,532 of the
necessaries of life, and used more or less by a11
classes of our people, paid $4,206,268, which is 58
per cent, ad valorem. If the whole dutiable goods
had paid the same duty, we should have realized
$16,923,944; consequently, the loss to the re-eenue
is 16,378,809, placing all the articles imported upon
the same principle, whether tlicy be those used by
the rich or by the poor; but this would be wrong.
But under the operations of this bill for the nine
months that we have before us, it will be seen that
the average rate of duties collected on silks, wines,
&c., are not exceeding 30 per cent.; while that on
the above articles is 58 per cent.; showing conclusive-
ly that the present tariff bill rests upon the labor of the
country. I repeat it, that it rests upon the labor of the
country, and that the wealth of the country does not
pay its proportion of the revenue : in other words,
the capital of the country is exempt from taxa-
tion; while the immense burdens of this govern-
ment are paid by the labor of the country.
An examination of the various tariff laws since
1816 will show that the tendency of all those
high duties that have been laid from time to time,
has oeen to throw the taxes upon the necessaries
of life; and consequently upon the labor of the
country. Under this very act, more than one-sixth
of the whole revenue collected in the nine months re-
ferred to, was colle'cted on the single article of sugar.
About one hundred thousand dollars was collected
in the month of February last, in New York city,
on this one article.
The policy of certain politicians appears to be,
to lay duties so that they shall extract the largest
amount of revenue from the smallest amount of
imports—a singular policy to be pursued to ad-
vance the interests of a commercial and agricultural
people. Take the four millions of revenue collect-
ed in New York in January and February last,
on twelve millions of imports. It appears plain to me
that it would be to the interest of the agriculturist,
that the four million of revenue should have been
collected from eighteen million of imports, for two
very simple reasons:
1. It would have added to the stock in market,
and consequently to the competition in trade.
2. There would be a greater market for the sale
of his farm productions.
But there is another question behind all this,
of still more importance, and that is this: if we con-
tinue the state of things we now have, we shall
engraft this principle upon our institutions, by
which we are to export the labor of this country
in manufactures, and not in agricultural productions
—for such must be the tendency of these high, and
to a great extent, prohibitory duties. We are now
exporting almost every variety of manufactures.
There were exported from Boston, during the week
ending the 13th of April, 951 bales of cotton, to va-
rious parts of the world. Our manufactures have
clothed a British army in India in American drills;
and I believe that the close of this year will show
the exportations of manufactures to be more than
the entire exportations of farm productions, leav-
ing out cotton, nee, and tobacco, notwithstanding
we have three times the capital engaged in agricul-
ture. During the administration of Mr. Jefferson,
when our duties did not exceed 15 per cent.—I al-
lude to 1803 and 1804—we exported, from our farm
productions, near twenty millions annnually, leav-
ing out cotton, rice, and tobacco; and, at the same
time, our'manufactures did not export two millions.
An examination of the exports from that time to
this will show the effect of high duties upon farm
productions.
It was only the other day that one of our manufac-
turers received an order for $200 worth of tailors'
shears, from Freyburg, in Germany.' We have
been competing successfully with the English m
South America, for some years past, in the sale of
that great article#of cotton goods, and are selling
the same in China, Africa, East Indies, and in all
. parts of the world. This is all well enough, when it
grows out of equal laws, and from the free exer-
cise of American skill and capital. But I enter my
- solemn protest against this government throwing its
restrictions and guards around any one interest, at
• the expense of another; the result of which will
be, to force the labor of this country into man-
ufactures; and thus we shall enter into competition
with the laborers of the old world. When we shall
do then the labor of this country -yyjll be
