SUPPLEMENT TO
landed me the original, and my impression is
that I noted on that original its receipt. It was
then lxanded to General Townsend, who made
the copy that I read here, and handed it to me.
I had it not until after the demand on the 22d
of February.
By Mr. Stanbery :
Question. Then, when you saw the President
on the afternoon of the 21st you had not yet
received that letter from Mr. Stanton?
Answer. I had not.
Question. You then stood upon the interview
which you referred to ?
Answer. I did. The next correction I want
to make is that I am made to say here that the
President told me "to take possession of the
office." His expression was " take charge of
the office."
Question. Are you certain that that was his
expression?
Answer. Positive. I was asked if I could
give the date of my brevet commission. I do
not know whether it is important or not, hut I
have it here.
' Question. What is the date?
Answer. The brevet of major general 13th of
March, 1865.
Question. Upon whose recommendation was
that? Who first suggested it?
Answer. Mr. Stanton gave it to me.
Question. Did you ask him for it or did he
volunteer it?
Mr. Manager BUTLER. That is not in the
nature of correction or of explanation.
Mr. STANBEIiY. He could not get it yes-
terday. It was an omitted fact, and he passed
it until he could get his commission.
Mr. Manager BUTLE11. Very good.
By Mr. Stanjieby :
Question. How was it—asked for or volun-
tarily tendered?
Answer. He had more than once said he
intended to give it to me, and on this occasion,
when I came from some important duty, 1 said
that the time had arrived when 1 ought to have
this commission. He said "certainly," and
gave it to me at once. I do not think ho over
intended to withhold it.
There is another point I want to state. When
I was before the committee, or the honorable
Managers, General Buti.mt asked the clerk, I
thinkitwas, for the testimony of Dr. Burucigii.
He said he had it not, that it was at his home.
I do not know whether I said or he said, " It
makes no difference." * He asked me a num-
ber of questions in reference to that. 1 as-
sented to them all. I never heard that testi-
mony read.
Question. You never heard Dr. Burleigh's
testimony read ? _
Answer. No, sir; nor do I recollect the par-
ticular questions, except that they were asked
me and I assented. I said that Dr. Burleigh,
no doubt, would recollect the conversation bet-
ter than I.
By Mr. Manager BcTi.nr.:
Question. General Thomas, how many times
yesterday did you answer that the President
told you each time to " take possession of the
office?"
Answer. I have not read over my testimony
particularly. I do not know how many times.
Question. Was that untrue each time you
said it?
Answer. If I said so it was. "Take charge"
were the words of the President.
Question. Have you any memorandum by
which you can correct that expression ? If
so, produce it.
Answer. I have no memorandum with me
here; I do not know that I have any.
Question. Have you looked at one since you
were on the stand ?
Answer. I have not.
Question. How can you tell better to-day
than you could yesterday ?
Answer. Because I read that evidence as
recorded.
Question. You gave it yesterday yourself?
Answer. I did.
Question. And you could know better what
it was by reading it than when you testified
to it?
Answer. Yes, sir.
Question. And you are sure the word was
" charge " each time ?
Answer. " Take charge of."
Question. And then the three times when
you reported to him that Stanton would not
go out, refused to go out, each time he said,
"Take charge of the office?"
Answer. He did.
Question. Was your attention called at the
time he said that to the difference between
taking ''charge" of the office and taking "pos-
session" of it?
Answer. My attention was not called to it.
Question. How, then, do you so carefully
make that distinction now in your mind?
Answer. Because I know that that was his
expression. I have thought the matter over.
Question. You have always known that that
was his expression, have you not?
Answer. Yes.
Question. And you have thought the matter
over ?
Answer. Yes. '
Question. Well, then, how could you make
such a mistake yesterday?
Answer. I think the words were put into my
month; I do not recollect distinctly.
Question. The same as Karsnerput in about
the "kicking out?"
Answer. Yes.
Question. And you are rather in the habit,
are you, when words are put into your mouth,
of using them?
Answer. I am not always in the habit.
Question. Why was yesterday an exception ?
Answer. I do not know why it was an ex-
ception.
Question. I want to ask you another ques-
tion on another subject which was omitted
yesterday ?
Answer. Certainly.
Question. After you and Karsnerwere sum-
moned here as witnesses, did you go and quar-
rel with him?
Answer. I had some words with him in the
room here adjoining.
Question. Did you call him a liar and a per-
jurer ?
Answer. I did.
Question. You called him a liar and perjurer,
did you?
Aimcer. I think I did both ; I certainly did
call him a liar.
Question. And a perjurer ?
Answer. I think it is probable I did; but
the '' liar," I know.
Question. You knew that he and you both
were in the witness-room waiting to be called?
A nswer. I was here.
Question. And you knew he was here for
that purpose?
Answer. I presume I did; yes.
Question. And while he was there you un-
dertook to talk with him about his testimony?
Answer. I stated to him in the two instances;
I will give them to you 
Question. Just answer my question, sir; I
have not asked you what you said. I only
ask you this question, whether you undertook
to talk with him about his testimony ?
Answer. I do not know who introduced the
conversation. It was certainly not I, I do not
think, for he was there some time before I
spoke to him.
Question. Did you speak first or he?
Answer. That I do not recollect.
Question. Now, then, did you tell him that
he was a liar and a perjurer at that time ?
Answer. I did tell him he was a liar, and I
may have said he was a perjurer.
Question. Did you offer violence to him?
Ansicer. I did not.
Question. Did you- speak violently to him?
Answer. I did not, except in that way.
Question. Were you then in full uniform
as now?
Answer. As I am now.
Question. There is another question I want
to ask you which was omitted. Do you still
intend to take charge or possession of the office
of Secretary of War?
Answer. I do.
Question. Have you said to any person within
a few days, "We'll have that fellow," mean-
ing Stanton, " out, if it sinks the ship?"
Answer. Never.
Question. Did you say so to Mr. Johnson ?
Answer. I did not.
Question. Anything to that effect ?
Answer. Not that 1 have any recollection of.
Question. Do you know whether you did or
not ?
Answer. What Mr. Johnson do you mean?
Question. Mr. B. B. Johnson.
Answer. There was a Mr. Johnson came to
see me at my house in reference to another
matter, and we may have had some conversa-
tion about this.
Question. When was it that that Mr. John-
son came to your house to see you about
another matter ?
Answer. That I hardly recollect.
Question. About how long ago ?
Answer. I am trying to recollect now. He
came to me about the business 
Question. Never mind what his business was.
When was it?
Answhr. But I want to call it to mind. I
have a right to do that, I think.
Question. But not to state it?
Answer. I took no note of the time, and I
can hardly tell. It was recently, not very long
ago.
Question. Within two or three days?
Answer. No, sir; before that time.
Question. Within a week?
Answer. I think it is more than a week.
Question. Let me give you the date—on Fri-
day, a week ago yesterday ?
Answer. I cannot give the date. I do not
know it.
Question. Was it longer than that?
Answer. Well, I did not charge my memory
with it.. It was a familiar conversation we had.
Question. Were you joking then?
Answer. Certainly.
Question. Oh, joking?
Answer. Yes.
Question. Did you, jokingly or otherwise,
say these words: "and we'll have Stanton
out of there if we have to sink the ship?"
Answer. I have no recollection of making
use of that expression.
Question. Did you make use of one equiva-
lent to that in substance?
Answer. I have no recollection of it.
Question. Have you such a recollection of
what you say as to know whether you did or
not?
Answer, I have not. I would rather he
would testify himself; he knows it better than I.
I cannot recollect all the conversation I had.
Question. Do you deny that you said so?
Answer. I cannot deny it, because I do not
know that I did.
Question. You sayyou would rather he would
testify; and I will try to oblige you in that re-
spect; but if you did say so, was it true or
merely more brag?
Ansicer. You may call it as you please;
brag, if you say so.
Question. I do not want to put words into
your mouth; what do you call it?
Answer. I do not call it "brag."
Question. What was it?
Answer. It was a mere conversation, what-
ever it may have been.

against Mr. Stanton to get him out of office.
