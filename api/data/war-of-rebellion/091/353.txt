RELAY HOUSE, MD., October 12, 1864-9 p.m.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

Your dispatch is received. In reply, have to say that in carrying out the order of General Halleck all of my available force was concentrated at Rockville to cover Washington Branch. The order was imperative. I was only relieved from it last evening, and immediately dispatched couriers to have the troops cover our entire river front again. The order could not reach them before 2 o'clock this morning. Another order followed to scout the country and arrest every man that could not satisfactorily account for himself. That order is being carried out, as far as I have troops to do it. Nearly one-half of my cavalry are without horses; so far, I have been unsuccessful in my efforts to obtain them. Give me two men to the mile, with a reasonable relief, and I will answer with my head that you shall be satisfied with my activity. I have not a man to the mile on the river-bank that I am trying to guard. Have done the best we could with what we had, supposing it was all that could be given us. We will increase our efforts, and certainly will accomplish much more if horses are given me to mount my cavalry. Dismounted men are of little service in hunting down guerrillas in that country, where two-thirds of the people are their bosom friends. I will send you detailed report by mail.

E. B. TYLER,

Brigadier-General.

RELAY HOUSE, October 12, 1864.

Lieutenant-Colonel LAWRENCE,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

Rebels reported in Poolesville last night robbing stores. My cavalry are after them. Are we to have horses for our dismounted men soon? It is all important at this time.

E. B. TYLER,

Brigadier-General.

RELAY HOUSE, October 12, 1864.

Colonel LAWRENCE:

The number of rebels at Poolesville not reported. I received the dispatch from General Halleck and gave orders accordingly. Copies will be forwarded you.

Captain Ferguson dispatches me that in a chase last night his men shot two guerrillas near Ridgeville, and that he has captured several deserters.
