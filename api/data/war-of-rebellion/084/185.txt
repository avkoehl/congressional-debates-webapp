KANSAS CITY, July 14, 1864.

Major-General ROSECRANS:

Lieutenant Manville, Second Colorado, commanding at Independence, telegraphs that the stage was robbed three miles west of that place this morning; horses and mail taken. Manville could not spare any men to pursue guerrillas. More troops are absolutely necessary in this sub-district. Nothing yet from Colonel Ford. Steam-boats with strong guards would do great service just now and for some days to come in patrolling the river between this and Rocheport.

J. TOTTEN,

Brigadier-General.

INDEPENDENCE, MO,. July 14, 1864.

General ROSECRANS:

The mails in this district are constantly robbed, and my horses taken by bushwhackers every week. They took four this morning out of the stage three miles from here. If I cannot get some protection in this country I will have to abandon my contracts with the Post-Office Department. Can I get it?
