having been brought into the harbor of
Charleston in a damaged condition, was
ordered by the French consul at that port to
be sold at public auction, and was purchased
by B. S. Rhett & Son, who have caused the
vessel to be repaired; but it shall be proved
to the satisfaction of the Secretary of the
Treasury that the cost of the repairs made in
the United States, after the purchase of the
vessel by the present owners, equals three
fourths of the entire cost of the vessel to B.
S. Rhett & Son, inclusive of amount paid
for the vessel at auction sale and the repairs
placed thereon.

merce was to strike out lines fourteen, fifteen,
and sixteen in the words "three fourths of the
entire cost of said vessel to said B. S. Rhett &
