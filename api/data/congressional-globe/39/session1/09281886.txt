THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
April 11,
The contracts for tbe doublc-turreted iron-clad
gunboats Winnebago and Milwaukee were made May
27,18U2, at 5.-U3.U00 each. The Winnebago cost $357,-
S22 GO; the loss claimed, after payment of extras and
sale of old iron, was ^29,174 20, and tlie same was
awarded. The Milwaukee cost, as claimed, $352,861 42,
making the loss, as claimed, ^30,438 84, and the award
was that sum. These ve^els were not completed and
delivered until the months o± May and August, 18(54,
and the contractor says the delay was occasioned as
follow^,(page 61 record of board:)
"He further states thattheWinnebago was delivered
to the United States during the month ot May, 1864,
and the Milwaukee in the month of August, 1864, and
that the delay in completing said vessels was from
circumstances entirely beyond his control. That the
work on them was prosecutcd with all the energy
which was in his power from the time of the signing
of the contract until their completion; and that for
the first six or seven months his entire force, num-
beiing ahoutnmc hundied workmen, were employed
at the work every d;iy, including Sundays, and about
two hundred every night, during each entire night,
at an extia expense ot fitty per cent, for their wages
each night and cach Sunday over the usual wages
paid them; and this extra expense, he states, was
incurred without expectation or hope of reimburse-
ment from the Government, but solel> to enable him
faithfully to perform his obligations to the Govern-
ment, although no clause existed in his contract
requiring tins incessant labor/'
The contract for the iron-clad Onondaga was made
May 26, lbt>2, and was completed February, 1864; the
contract price was ^62-),000, ihe cost claimed was
$71u,156 51, and the award $85,203 91. The delay in
the completion of the vessel was occasioned by "scar-
city of labor, difficulty of obtainingmaterials, strikes,
and having to close his shop for two months on ac-
count of mobs in thesammer ofl8G3." (See pages 18
and 19 of record of board.)
The contracts for the iron-clad monitors Maho-
pac, Tecumseh, and Manhattan were made Septem-
ber 1, 1862: the entire cost of the three vessels was
$2,270,447 63; the loss claimedto havebeensustained
was 8382,392 07. and the award made was $lly,020 57
upon each. These vessels were not completed or
delivered until the months of March, May, and Au-
gust, 18(31, and it was claimed that the delay "was
owing to alterations and additions to original speci-
fications required by the Department."
The contracts for the iron-clad monitors Catawba
and Oneoto were made in September and October,
1862, at $920,000 tor both vessels; the work required
by additions and alterations .>322,819; the entire cost
was si.470,808 88, and the loss claimed $228,019 88. and
the award was $>114,009 94 upon each. These vessels
were not completed and delivered until June, 1865,
and the contractors elaim that " this delay wascaused
by alterations being made by order of the Depart-
ment and the scarcity ot labor. The excess oi cost is
accounted for in being obliged to raise the vessels
eighteen inches, exte'nsive alterations in turrets, and
increased size of boilers over stipulations of con-
tract."
The contract for the monitor Manayunk was made
September 15,1862, but was not completed till Sep-
tember, 1865; the contract price was $460,000, addi-
tional work required by change in specifications,
€'166,582 24, and the entire cost of the vessel $700,890 06,
and the loss claimed $74,313 81, aud the award 871,-
569 42. The delay and costs are thus explained, (see
recoid of board, page 56 :)
" That the causes of delay in the completion of the
vessel arose from the fact of extensive alterations
from time to time oidered by the Government: and
also that, owing to the distance of our establishments
from New York, we were unable to procure tlie neces-
sary drawings and plans with the promptness and
dispatch that similar works in that city wore able to
do; and also, owing to the very low state ot water in
the Ohio river, it was not in our power to launch our
vessels in April, 1864, and we were compelled on that
account to deiur launching the vessel until Decem-
ber of the same year. That the reasons lor the excess
of cost over the contract price were owing to the great
advance in material and labor, and the alterations
ordeied from time to time, and to the great difficulty
in procuring labor, our mechanics and others em-
ployed by us having gone into the Army and Navy,
and we were compelled at great expense to obtain a
portion of the desired labor troin Europe. It was also
at the time a new thing to the mechanics of thatsec-
tion ol'the country, which was a potent difficulty we
had tocontendwith; and further, we were compelled,
owing to our isolated position, to do our work, as it
were, within ourselves, there being no similar estab-
lishments in that part of the country to which we
could apply for any aid or help. That there are no
charges m the bill (annexed to the record and marked
No. lor any condemned material or faulty work-
manship, and that it shows the actual cost of labor
and material."
The contraci for the light-draft monitor Naubuc
was made April 2,1863, but she was not completed and
delivered until February, l8o5. The contraet^vricew as
S36l,055 67; the additional work required by changes
madeduiing her construction,$143,973 05: thecostof
the entire work, $559,872 72. The lo.-s claimed was
$54,8-13 93. and the award was 2>86,333 41. The delay
m the completion of the work seems to have been
occasioned by repeated alterations in the work by
the diilerent inspectors, and a part of the loss caused
by pressing the work on Sundays and nights.
The contract for the monitor Camanche was made
June 20, 1S02, and the vessel was not completed and
delivered until January, 1865.
"The causes of delay were that tbe contractors were
obliged to give portions of the material of the Ca-
mancae to aid in the construction ot other iron-elads
then building in New York, and required bytheGov-
ernment for immediate use, as the rolling-mills of
I the country were not of sufficient capacity to roll the
i kinds of iron required for that class ol vessels as fast
as itwaswanted. When the Oainanchewas ready for
shipment to San Francisco, the Government took the
principal parts of her engine to replace similar parts
of the engine of the Weehawken, which had broken
down at Port Royal. Tho delay in replacing these
parts of the machinery caused the Camanche to arrive
in San Francisco in the winter instead of in the spring
of the year. The ship Aquilla, with the materials for
constructingthe Camanche on board, wassunk during
a violent gale in the harbor of San Francisco, caus-
ing a further delay in completing the vessel/'—Record
of Board, p. 34.
The contract price of the vessel was $565,000; addi-
tional work required by alterations as the work pro-
gressed was $48,164 98; the entire payments made by
tho Government were $613,161 98; and the entire cost
of the vessel was $802,314 79; the loss claimed was
$1S9,149 81, and the award was $179,993 SO.
The aggregate of contract prices was $9,S93,225 67;
of thecostof the vessels and machinery, $13,5S4,5S2 31;
of the losses claimed before the boasd, $2,835,520 20,
and of the awards, $2,267,627 78.
It will be observed that the Department made con-
tracts for tho fifteen double-ondors, the machinery
for twenty-two double-enders, for the six harbor and
river monitors, with their machinery, for one iron
double-cnder, and for the iron-clad Miantonomoh,
in the months of August, September, and October,
1862; for five iron double-enders in June, July, and
August, 1863; for three iron tug-boats in December,
1863; for the iron-clad Onondaga, the iron-clad pro-
pellers Milwaukee and Winnebago, in May, and the
monitor Camanche, in June, 1862, and for the monitor
Naubuc.in April,1863. Duringtheperiod appointed
for the construction of this work, the Department
had many other heavy jobs in its own yards, in the
shops of some of these contractors, and ot other par-
ties, so that the machinery, material, and skilled labor
of the country were taxed beyondtlieircapacity; and
the committee are satisfied that, with the means at
their command, it was not possible for these contract-
ors .to complete these vessels and this machinery
within the periods fixed in the contracts, even had
there been no delay occasioned by experiments and
modifications of the plans and specifications. The
committee are also of opinion that, could the work
have been completed within the times fixed in tho
contracts, and had there been no advance in the price
ot labor and material, tho contractor would have
sustained but little if any loss, though they would
not probably have realized any profit; but that a
delay in the completion of the work made losses inev-
itable. The vigorous prosecution of ihe war rendeied
it necessary for the Government to increase to a very
large extent, the currency, and, as a consequence, the
prices ol material andlaborrapidly advanced. Table
No. 2,''- annexed, furnished the committee by George
L. Quintard, of the Morgan Iron Works, in the city
