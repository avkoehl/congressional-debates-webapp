It will be seen from this table and Table 3, Document 6, of Appendix, that some of the Western States, with quotas under the calls of 1861 and 1862 (assigned on the basis of population) nearly the same as some of the Eastern States, furnished all required, and yet had a much larger proportion of men liable to military duty left than Eastern States which did not fill the quotas assigned under those calls, and were, in consequence, charged with a deficiency on subsequent calls. In some instances, therefore, where a deficiency existed it may be attributed somewhat to excessive quotas in 1861 and 1862, assigned on the basis of population, and the excess of troops furnished by some States may, on the same principle, be due in a measure to their surplus of men.

The States showing the larger ratios of enrollment to male population are-

First. Those to which the more recent immigration has been most considerable, meaning immigration both from foreign countries and that resulting from the movement from the Atlantic States westward. Under this head Indiana, Illinois, Missouri, Minnesota, and Kansas are examples.

Second. Those States having large cities, to which all able- bodied men resort for employment, especially those near the depots of foreign immigration, in which males from abroad remain upon landing, or to which males from abroad remain upon landing, or to Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Maryland. The State of New York is the most striking instance of the above, containing, as it does, the chief depot of foreign immigration and, as well, a metropolitan district
