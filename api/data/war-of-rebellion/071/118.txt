HDQRS. ACTG. ASST. PROVOST-MARSHAL-GENERAL, Harrisburg, July 7, 1864.

Respectfully forwarded to the Provost-Marshal-General.

I do not know what important to attack to this communication, as I do not perceive the motive of Lieutenant Shearer to give information injurious to the cause he supports, but presuming that he would give it only to deceive. As this communication, however, is on an important subject, and has ben addressed to me, I feel it my duty to forward it for consideration.
