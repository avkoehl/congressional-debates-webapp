CHARLESTON, S. C., June 24, 1862.

Honorable GEORGE W. RANDOLPH,

Secretary of War:

I have forbidden all sail vessels leaving the harbor, as I think they are liable to be caught and the cotton to fall into the hands of the enemy. I ask for instructions.

J. C. PEMBERTON,

Major-General, Commanding.

RICHMOND, VA., June 24, 1862.

Gov. FRANCIS W. PICKENS, Columbia, S. C.:

Delayed action for letter from General Cooper; none received. Your dispatch of yesterday received. Have sent for General Huger; expect him in a few hours.

JEFFERSON DAVIS.
HDQRS. DEPT. OF SOUTH CAROLINA AND GEORGIA,Charleston, S. C., June 25, 1862.

Brigadier-General SMITH, James Island, S. C.:

Should the enemy open another battery on the west of Secessionville you had better have a 24-pounder rifled gun brought down to be placed where the Parrott-gun battery is. It is reported that Colonel Benbow's regiment lands at Fort Johnson. The general wishes that regiment to occupy the position that Colonel Graham's regiment occupied on the island. If Colonel Benbow's has not arrived send another to that point.

J. R. WADDY,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HDQRS. DEPT. OF SOUTH CAROLINA AND GEORGIA,Charleston, S. C., June 25, 1862.

Brigadier General W. D. SMITH, James Island, S. C.:

GENERAL: The major-general commanding directs me to say he desires you should finish the battery at Secessionville as speedily as possible, and that you should endeavor to prevent the enemy from erecting their battery or batteries against that point.

R. W. MEMMINGER,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

SAVANNAH, GA., June 26, 1862.

Honorable GEORGE W. RANDOLPH, Secretary of War:

The floating battery Georgia is finished and in immediate want of a crew. Cannot furnish them from my command, and I ask authority to call upon Major Dunwody for as many conscripts as will be required. This matter is pressing, and the only mode of promptly supplying the battery with a crew, which the Navy officers find themselves entirely unable to enlist. I also ask authority to retain 3,000 of the rifles lately arrived. I have more than that number of men without arms.

H. W. MERCER,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
