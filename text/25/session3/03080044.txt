has not that title been quieted by compromise or
otherwise  Or why has not some new site been
selected > If the people of the South and West
submit to these things, they deserve no better
Mr T. did not hold the present head of the Navy
Department resnonsible for those things It would
be unjust to charge that gentleman with any want
of a just regard to the interests of the South
And, sir, am I to be taken up and lectured here,
not only by northern b^t by southern men, too,
as involving improperly sectional topics, beca ise
I allude to these things> I should be recreant to
the South and i*s interests if I foi bore to do so
from any sickly and mawkish sentimentality, or
the poor vanity of making fine sentences about
our glorious Union, and tha' broad patriotism
that looks to the mteiest of the whole country,
disregarding all sectional injustice, however gross
If this be narrow and sectional, be it so Let
gentlemen make the most of it, and pursue, if
they choose, a different course That they will
gam much reputation for a hrge and enlightened
patriotism elsewhere than at home, I do not doubt
Whether they will promote the interest"? of their
constituents or the country is anothei question
I know the generous and confiding nature of my
friend ft om Noith Carolina, [Mr Staniy] Con-
scious of a supeuonty to all narrow feelings, he
suspects none in others Let him stay here as
long as I have, and I rather think he will find these
notions going out at the palms of his hands
Eut my friend from New "Vork [Mr   Hofí-
mam] has first brought up this topic, and repeats
mdorsmgly some re narks at the last session by
the gentleman from Massachusetts [Mr Adavis ]
That distinguished gentleman, in ¡eply to some
remarks of mine made tv> o years before as to the
inequality of disbuisements, with the trick, or
rather I should bay the skill (as that is more íe
spectful) of a practiced dialectician, relied upon
the fact that the largest amount of the public
money on deposit was in the southern fetales
There was much moie of wit than tiuth m the
views which he presented    What was my posi-
tion*   That much the largest amount of appro-
priations went Nouh     How does he leply to it'
Why, by showing that whilst on deposit, be-
tween the time of collection and disbursement,
large sumí weie found in the South     Poi etwi
pie, Alabama paid to the G verrment, in 18J4,
about $1 250 000, and received back in appropn-
aüons$250 000, whilst Vermont, which paid $170,
received $185 000, Mississippi and Louisiana paid
P,000 000 each, and each leceived in appiopri
ations less than  $^50,000, whilst  New  Hamp
shiie paid $16,000, and received ! d34 000     but
while  tins  money  was  m transitu (lom   the e
southern States, which it dt| leted to skeletons,
to these northern States, which  it fed to reple
tlon  and  plethoin,  it did  stop a little while in j
southern banks until it could be removed to its |
ultimate and legitimate home in the Noith     Our |
own money abided with us thice months, "thiee
little months," and that is made an item of charge
against us
But,says the gentleman from New York, [Mr
Hon mis,] there is the I londa wai,and its laige
appropi¡ations    Indeed, and has it con e to that'
Are we to be charged, as for a sectional puipose,
with   money expended  in  defending our wives
andchildien from the savage tornihavvk      Most
beneficent Government( most geneious and mag
nammous people' who are ca¡ able of the unex
ampled generosity of appropriating  money  for
these purposes'   Why,sir, tint is tne single ben
«fit that we of the Sou hieceivefiom this connec
tion—and that is enjoyed in at leas' an  equal
degree by the North—united strength and mutual
aid in war, a great matter, it is true, but not to be
pu* down as of a sectional chaiaetei      Cut, s r, if
the gentleman s constituei ts have given us money
to carry on this war, I believe it is all the} have

attuned, beat fervently for the peace of the coun-
try, and prayed that the bitter cup might pass
from us, when good men and patriots sought
more the olive branch than the bayonet, when
that olive branch was magnanimously and gen-
erously tendered, and in the same spirit received,
this gallant regiment thought only of the spint-
stirrmg drum and the strife of battle What has
become of those gallant fellows? Dead, I sup-
pose, sir, all dead, or surely their trenchant blades
would have leaped from their scabbards at the
first note of this Florida wai, all dead, I sup-
pose—killed in foreign wars, no doubt, in Texas,
or perhaps in the civil wars of Spain, as it seems
to be a uvil bioil for which they have a special
fancy.
On motion of Mr EVANS, the committee then
rose, repoited progress, and the House adjourned
GRADUATION BILL.
DEBATE IN THE SENATE.
January 2, 1839
The Senate took up for consideration, as in
Committee of the Whole, the bill to provide for
the reduction and graduation of the price of the
Public Lands
Mr  Cliy, of Kentucky, had offered a resolu
tion to refer the bill back to the Committee on the
Public Lands, with instructions to that committee
so to amend it as to restnct its benefits to actual
settlers
Mr CLAY, of Alabama, deemed it only neces-
sary to remark, on this occasion, that the bill was
now in the same shape as that in which it passed
the Senate at the last session The bill had, in its
original shape, provided foi a further reduction to
fifty cents per acre, but that clause having been
stricken out, the lowest reduction was now sev
enty five cents, extending to lands that had been
offeied for fifteen years and upwards The bill
contained no new principle—it was well under
stood and was ie"-aided as a measure of justice
by the new States, who asked it of the National
Legislature, principally, on that ground With
these observations, he would content himself with
submitting the measuie to the judgment of the
Senate
Mr NILC3 offered an amendment to strike out
all after the provibo in the 12 h h íe, which was
agieed to
Mr  CLAY, of Kentucky, was sure that the
Senate would agree with him in thinking that this
bill was one of great importance, and that the
most delibeiate consideration should be bestowed
on it before taking the vote     He was aware that
the Senate, at the last session, passed a bill some
what like this, containing its essential provisions
But the Senate was thtn < onsti uted somewhat
dif eiently from what it now was    Many metnbeis
might have changed their opinions, and the coun
try itself, judging fiom an expiession of opinion
by a laige and respectable portion of it m one of
the southern States, was getting more alive to ti e
importance of this gieat poition of our national
wealth     He did hope, therefore, that this import
ant question wouH not be humedthiough without
a thoiough discussion     He had so recently ad
diessed the Senate on this subject, that he should,
with extreme reluctance, again engage m the dis
cussion, but the magnitude of the interests in
volved would not permit him to continue silent
The bi'l, as it now stands, opeiated on seventy
one millions of acres of public land, as large as
two of the States of this Union, and which, under
its pirvisions, were almost instantaneously to be
reduced  in  price from jjl 25 to 75 cents     The
diffeienee in point of value of these lands, between
the prices under the exi ting law and those they
would be i educed to under the operations of this
bill, was $35,000,000     Now, a sum of this mag
mtude, at any time, and especially at a moment
wi en  ti e  Government vas pressed for want of
re  e>-uc—when   gtntlemtn   o l   all   sides   of   the
Hr  "e seemed to t link it their duty to retrencl —
ought not to h  voted away without the most ira
pcrati e considerations     It was not his purpose
at this moment to offer all tbeconsiderations which
pressed upon him, he had risen only for the pur-
pose of making a motion, to which he invited the
serious attention of the Senate It was not ne-
cessary for him to repeat that he was radically
opposed to any change of the land system, and
the motion he was compelled to make was to limit
the waste of this public treasure The motion
was to confer the right to purchase public lands
ata reduced price upon actual settlers, to exclude
speculation, w'ich he believed would be the in-
evitable consequence of this immense reduction
At the very moment (said Mr C ) that we are
casting from us this valuable treasure, immense
fortunes are making by individuals, who are pur-
chasing these lands at the minimum price, and
selling them at a large profit to actual settlers
He believed that if the sales had been confined to
actual settlers, the population of the new States
would have increased much more rapidly than it
had done His object was to confine the boon to
actual settleis only, and with this view he offered
his present motion, and asked for the yeas and
nays on it.
Mr C then moved that the bill be recommitted
to the Committee on the Public Lands, with in-
structions to amend it so as to restrict the sales
at a reduced price to actual settlers only, and to
limit each sale in quantity to one hundred and
sixty acres
Mr WALKER said the Senatoi from Ken-
tucky [Mr Clay] has given us no reason to sup-
pose that if the bill were recommitted and amended,
as he proposes, by limiting the sales to actual set-
tlers at the reduced pnces, he would then support
the measure Mi W would now inquire, would
the Senator fiom Kentucky support the bill if his
amendment were adopted ' The Senator from
Kentucky would not and could not answer in the
affirmative, he had always opposed graduation in
eveiy form, and he (Mr W )had no doubt would
continue to oppose it The amendment, then,
was not offered to aid the passage of the bill, but
by one who would oppose the measure, however
amended or modified And, now, is it not most
extiaordinary that the Senator from Kentucky
should be found pioposing this limitation of the
sales at the reduced prices to actual settlers—a
measure which he had denounced as odious, unjust,
and unconstitutional Had the Senator forgotten
his course on this subject in 1836, 1837,and 1838?
Ble had forgotten that when, in the spring of 1836,
he (Mr W ) had first introduced a bill confining
the sales of the public lands to actual settlers, he
[Mi Clay] had risen to pi event even the second
reading of the bill He denounced the limitation
of the srles to actual settlers as a gross violation
of the Constitution, and declared that the bill ought
to be instantly rejected     At that session (Mr W
I said)hehad beendefeated,butthenextyear(1837)
he bought forward the samemeasure Again the
Senator from Kentucky was its ardent and per-
severing opponent, but, nevertheless, the measure
passed the Senate, but failed in the House And
now, is it not sui prising, is not the Senator him-
self astonished, is not the Senate and country as-
tounded to hear the Senatoi fiom Kentucky pio-
Í posing t i incorporate into this bill a principle
which he has «o recently and repeatedly denounced
as unjust and uncons'itutional ' Ou¿ht not the
Senator to have permitted a Utile mere tune to
have elapsed before he astonished his friends and
the count!y by this most extraoidmary change of
position    But, sir, it is a change of position only,
I  not of principle    The Senator fiom Kentucky
has not changed h s principles, he is still the un
compromising opponent of the actual settler, he
, is only assailing from behind a breastwork the
interest of the new States, and he will vote against
I   the bill, whether  his amendment is adopted or
! rejected If it is otherw se let the Senator from
Kentucky now say, that with the amendment be
will support the bill, and thus insure its passage
m both Houses, and he (Mr W ) would support
the amendment The bill,as it now stand", limits
the right of entry at the reduced price to one sec-
tion, thus preventing all di^ngei of monopoly or
specu'a ion The bi'l was confined to the lands
that hsd been long ,t> market, and which your
o^cial reoo-ts demonstrate, will not sell within
any reasonable time, if evet, at the piesent price
