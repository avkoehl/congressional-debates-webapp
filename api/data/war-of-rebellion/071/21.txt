CAMDEN STATION, July 3, 1864.

Brigadier-General WEBER:

Do you know the extent of force of the enemy reported about Martinsburg; and do you think the absence of the operator at Martinsburg indicates that military authorities have also left there?

W. P. SMITH.

P. S.-Do you know who is in command of enemy; and do you have any fears of their threatening you?

W. P. SMITH.
HEADQUARTERS,Harper's Ferry, W. Va., July 3, 1864-11.50 a. m.

W. P. SMITH,

Master of Transportation, Baltimore and Ohio R. R.:

The last news from Martinsburg was that the enemy, in a large force, supposed to be the same that fought with General Hunter, were two miles west of Martinsburg, and destroying track, &amp;c., and advancing on Martinsburg. There has been fighting since 5 o'clock. We have sent out a party to obtain information, which had not yet returned. We are preparing for an attack. I do not think the military have left Martinsburg. General Weber is now in front, attending to the movements of troops. You will be kept informed of all that transpires.

H. M. BURLEIGH,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

CAMDEN STATION, July 3, 1864.

Captain BURLEIGH:

Greatly obliged for your intelligent dispatch. It is valuable to us to understand the true situation. We shall try to get you re-enforced if necessary to hold your position and you should be attacked. Please advise me further. We would like to know if General Sigel got off his stores safely, and if all equipments of our road are safe. Are our forces yet in possession of Martinsburg?

W. P. SMITH.
HEADQUARTERS,Harper's Ferry, W. Va., July 3, 1864.

W. P. SMITH,

Master of Transportation:

There is no telegraphic communication with Martinsburg. The railroad stores were all saved, and trains are constantly passing this point. There is still hard fighting near Leetown. A station will be established at Kearneysville, and I will telegraph as soon as new information is received.

H. M. BURLEIGH,
