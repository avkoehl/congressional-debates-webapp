LOUISVILLE, KY., December 31, 1862.

Colonel STAGER:

Scouts just arrived say Morgan still in Bardstown. Pickets say will remain four of five days resting men. Evidently expects re-enforcements. Force said to be near Elizabethtown. Special from Nashville represents Rosecrans having advanced within 8 miles. One from Murfreesborough, dated 29th, says, "General battle expected 30th at Stone's River, front of Murfreesborough. Two scouts just in say Forrest, with 9,000 men, is at Elizabethtown." Special too long to copy.
