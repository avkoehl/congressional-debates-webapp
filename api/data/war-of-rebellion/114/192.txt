road is committed have been selected from those of property and respectability without regard to political opinions; and I think that as soon as they can be made to realize that any disturbances among them, any combinations against the Government and any attempt to destroy the lines of railroad will lead to immediate reprisals upon themselves they will take such measures as will be necessary to prevent them. It requires but little effort on the part of the citizens of this section of country to preserve peace and order among themselves, and the moment they are furnished with such reasons for active interference as I have given them I do not doubt that all trouble will be at an end north of the Missouri River. I have applied the same system to all parts of North Missouri and will go forward in the morning to see them put in operation over the whole district. I am aware that these measures may seem at first sight to be harsh; but when it is considered that those calling themselves Union men and good citizens will not only not resist these lawless acts of outrage and these infamous assassinations of persons employed in the public service, but will absolutely refuse to interpose or to give the names of persons in their very midst who are and have been engaged in such atrocious transactions, I think the course I have adopted will appear sufficiently mild for the case. I transmit also copies of orders issued from these headquarters for your information. As soon as I learn that you have reached Saint Louis I will report to you in person.

Respectfully, general, your obedient servant,

JNO POPE,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
