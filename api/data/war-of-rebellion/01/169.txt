No. 35.] FORT SUMTER, S. C., February 6, 1861. [Received A. G. O.,

February 9.]

Colonel S. COOPER,

Adjutant-General:

COLONEL: Nothing new. Still at work on Cummings Point, putting up iron shutters yesterday in the embrasures. They are, I suspect, pretty nearly ready over there. God grant that these people may not make the attack which they have so long threatened.

I am, colonel, your obedient servant,

ROBERT ANDERSON,

Major, First Artillery, Commanding.

No. 37.] FORT SUMTER, S. C., February 7, 1861. [Received A. G. O.,

February 11.]

Colonel S. COOPER,

Adjutant-General:

COLONEL: The guard-boats were rather more on the alert last night than they have been for three or four nights previous. Last night we heard them, the South Carolinians, either at work on or moving pieces of iron. This morning they are at work, apparently either extending the bomb-proof on the seaward side or commencing to form a parapet for guns or a blind on that flank. I observe in the Last English papers that a shipment of three rifled cannon has been made from England to Charleston. Such an addition to their battery would make our position much less secure that I have considered it; and if we are to have a collision, which God forbid, would render it necessary to send on re-enforcements in a few days after the commencement of hostilities.

I am, colonel, respectfully, your obedient servant,

ROBERT ANDERSON,

Major, First Artillery, Commanding.

No. 39.]	 FORT SUMTER, S. C., February 9, 1861. [Received A. G. O.,

February 12.]

Colonel S. COOPER,

Adjutant-General:

COLONEL: I have the honor to report that the South Carolina troops continued their work yesterday, and they are also at work to-day on Cummings Point. The bomb-proof battery appears nearly finished, and there are now three guns [apparently heavy ones] mounted, bearing upon us, in a barbette battery about three hundred yards eastward of the bomb-proof battery, with which it appears to be connected by a covered way. They are also making some additions to, or making some alterations in, the mortar battery at Fort Johnson.

I am, colonel, respectfully, your obedient servant,

ROBERT ANDERSON,

Major, First Artillery, Commanding.
