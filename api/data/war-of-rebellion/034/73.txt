MURFREESBOROUGH, TENN., March 6, 1863-11.20 a. m.

General Gilbert was ordered to send a brigade from Franklin, to reconnoiter toward Spring Hill, in connection with a movement via Eagleville. I have received the following from General Granger:

FRANKLIN, March 5, 1863.

The expedition ordered from this point on the 3rd was, I fear, drawn into a trap while passing a defile near Thompson's Station, and some 1,800 men, have fallen into the hands of the enemy, including killed, wounded, and prisoners. I have reason to believe that the enemy has suffered severely. Van Dorn commanded. General Sheridan made a reconnaissance on the 4th to Unionville, near Duck River, and the cavalry routed two rebel camps, capturing 70 prisoners, among whom were 5 commissioned officers, 21 wagons, and a considerable quantity of camp equipage and stores. Brigadier-General Steedman, on the same day, routed a rebel force at Chapel Hill, and captured 100 prisoners. The expedition has not yet returned.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General, Commanding.

Major General H. W. HALLECK, General-in-Chief.
