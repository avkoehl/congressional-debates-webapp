There is no provost guard nor has been at Bay Point by my orders. There were some men sent there by Colonel Littlefield, to whom I gave papers and instructions to the effect to arrest all men, deserters from the Second U. S. Colored Battery or any other deserters, that might be found belonging to colored troops.

OFFICE PROVOST-MARSHAL-General, DEPT. OF THE SOUTH,

Hilton Head, S. C., August 7, 1864.

Respectfully returned, with indorsement from Captain Hennessy, district provost-marshal.

The guard sent by Colonel Littlefield have either misunderstood or exceeded their instructions in exercising an authority within the jurisdiction of the naval department. I had no knowledge of this party going to Bay Point. I am very certain that no discourtesy was intended, and if I had been aware that the party was ordered on this duty, I would have given them such instructions as would have prevented the cause of the present complaint.

Lieutenant-Colonel and Provost-Marshal-General.
