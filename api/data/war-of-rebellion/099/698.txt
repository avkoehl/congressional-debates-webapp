not certain that the steamer can reach her destination, as I do not know what depth of water can be carried up James River, but the arrangement is the best that I could make for want of suitable sea-going transports.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

HDQRS. NORTHERN DISTRICT, DEPT. OF THE SOUTH,

Charleston, S. C., March 5, 1865.

Lieutenant Colonel S. L. WOODFORD,

Commanding Post of Charleston, S. C.:

COLONEL: I would suggest that two or three additional points be designated where the people can register their names and subscribe to the oath. I hear that the crowd is so large and the delay so great that many persons are obliged to spend time that they can hardly spare. I have also heard that it is proposed to get up a demonstration on Thursday next by the colored people. If it meet your approval it is very well, but the city being under martial law no assemblage should be allowed without your previous sanction. One thing more; I would suggest that an order prohibiting enlisted men being in the streets (except on duty) after retreat would at the present time assist in preventing the numerous robberies and irregularities. This need be only temporary.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOHN P. HATCH,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, near Cheraw, March 6, 1865.

Major General O. O. HOWARD,

Commanding Right Wing:

GENERAL: A copy of your order issued at Easterling's for to-morrow's movement inclosed to the general-in-chief has been received. *
