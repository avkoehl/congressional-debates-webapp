do so here i Will not such be the inevitable eon
sequence of the new scheme of one currency for
the Government and another for the people Pro
batty I had bettet avoid the d'scussion oí this mat
ter now, as it belongs jnoie properly to what is
called the reme ly lhat is before us in the sub trea
sury bill, at win h, however, it seemed not impro
per to glance
Having spoken of the difficulties under which
we labor, what aie the y tobe ascribed to1 And
here I take the i essage of the President of the
Unfted States and the rcpoií oí iho Secretary of the
Treasury I take them, neither admitting nor de
nymg them, but I take them both as they s and for
the present Over-trading is the cause —is it not
set forth m the message and report'! Over action
it is called 11 the menage overtrading, and espe
dally over production of cotton is stated by the
Secretary of the Treasury as the principal cause oí
our trouble
SATURDAY, Septmber 29, 1837
Mr Sergeant resumed
Mr Speaker This house has been so consta"iy
in session, and the attention of the members of it
occupied by so many speeches, that they must be a
good deal fatigued, and it is almost unreasonable, at
this time, to ask then a'tention to the subject of
this resolution I, su, certainly never could have
introduced it to the notice oí the ho ise, and I
regret very much, that it has been brought foi ward
m such a way as to oblige us to vote upon it, and,
as a matter oí necessity to those who vote to give
some reason for their vote With this view, and
under the necessity forced upon us, I will pursue
the course of remarks I was making when the sub-
ject was last under consideration
Mr Speaker, I will endeavor to condense w hat I
have to say in a small compass, and to place it
upon ground as little liable as possible to contro
versy and dispute, proceeding, chiefly, upon con
ceded facts When I last addressed the House,
I was adverting to that part ot the report of the
Secretary of the Tieasuiy m which he ascribes the
present embarrassed condition of tne countiy and
of the Government to everil causes 1 he first
that he mentions is that of tin ovci prod ut ¡ion ol
cotton, combined with the sudden fall m i s puce,
making i difference m the whole v ilue oí the eiop
of that year of forty millions of dollars He esti
mates the over produc ion eompai ed w ith the past,
at upwards of one hundred millions of pounds,
and, as he intimates, more than it ought to have
been, to that extent
Now, sir, supposing it to be accurate as he states
that half the crop has escaped (he effects of this
change, having got to maiket beiore it occurred  it
appear  that there is an actual loss on this article
of 820,000,000, ancij 0¡ course, whatever it mi; be
owing to, the loss to the cotton grov ing counti\
may  be  put down,  in icgard to lhat   nop   at
$20 000 000     T sa1(], thtrefoi r   this was an mu lest
pnmanlj afficted along with tin mercantile inte
rest, and the other interests Uimi-rnout the «hole
Country have also been all c ed consiquentiaily
And now what do the Secretar} oí the Tieasmy
and the President siy, is, as iar as their inquiries
have gone, the ultimate cause of tins'!   What has
namediately led to this ov er trading and over
purchasing of lands, this over cultivahon   to this
over action, as it is teimed in the Piesident s mes
sage, terminating in the present di older md dis
tress'!
Sir, as far as they have looked into the matter,
and I shall go no further for the present purpose,
they ascribe this over action and the evils ips íltmg
from it, mainly to the over multiplication ol hank
the utiaue increase oi bank capital and the excess
of circulation, that is, of bank papel Wh-i ti ese
things themselves were owing to what vvcie the
primary cause  these arc questions of gieit coi
sequence, altogether avoided bv the Piesid"nt ct d
the Seeretarv I am not now going into Dm I
will rest here for tne present purj ose and suppose
it to be cotrect that the exising disorder m the
countrv so unne'sallv felt is tne consequence,
not the cause, as jusl stated of o er banking Well,
sir, what is this ov el 1 inking it«e'f owing toí Sir,
it would be natural t> answer at once that it is
owing to the want oi «um  suitable r strain! And,
I presume this is a proposition so perfcctlv clear
that every one would agree to it Is it possible
then to devise any restraint ?
Now, sir, I mean by historial pi oofs to show} on,
I think eenelusively, that it is possible, that we
have had such a restraint, and that the absence or
removal oí this restraint, is the real canse, the very
source of so man} mischiefs     We will ai erwards
consider what that is     Sir, I will call the attention
of this house, in the first place, to two leading facts
in our history    For forty } ears of its existence this
Government had a national bank—I mean a bank
that was the fiscal agent of the nation    In tne same
period, that is, since the adoption of the constitu
«on, you have been forsix orseven yeaisonly wilh
out a national bank, and this at two different periods
Now sir, if it should be found upon the records of
the history of the country, that such disorders as
exist at present, have nev er occurred during the
period w hen you had a national bank, though that
period extended through the space of forty years,
and that each time when a national bank ceased to
exist, and as soon as it ceased to- exis  these dis
orders began and continued as they now do is it not
reasonable and natural to infer, that in this co exist
ence theie is a connexion as of cause and eff ctq I
believe it, as much as I beheí e any truth whatev er,
which I have been taught or been able to discover
Sir,  it is the business of a statesman, from every
event, good or bad toendeavoi to draw instruction
His pressing and immediate duty is to get through
exigencies existing, with as little mjuiy as possible,
but his next duty is out of the exigency itself to
extract lessons, which may be applicable m future
times, and prevent a recurrence of similar disas
ters    Now I invite the attention of the house to
three points m our history, for, short as our history
is, it furnishes three periods upon the subject in
question,  and   it is really astonishing when you
come to look at them, what an univeisal and un-
questionable testimony the}   bear in contradiction
to this resolution
Sir, the first bank evei established withm the
limits of the United States was a national bank
We are all familiar w ith the state of things which
immediately followed the last emission of paper
money, commonly called continental money, by the
old Congress The amount of that emission was I
think, two hundred millions of dollars It rapidlv
dcpieciated, ainving no doubt in its dtsec nt, at the
rate mentioned m the message oí five hundred ior
one and finall} was cried down as it was teimed
being of no value whatever This was a daik and
appalling mommt Our troops w ithout pay with
out clothing and without piovision the Treasury
was without monej, and Gongnss was without
credit Pnoi to that time no bank had existed in
these provinces oi colonies, or Slates aftei they
became States 1 he provinces, while provinces
had all been in the habit of issuing bills of credit,
and the Congiess of the Um cd States caused to be
( muted that paper, always since h.n >wn by the name
of continental money and which no man living,
if he has any recollection of it desires ever to see
icstored again  nor am thing in its likeness
When things weie m this condition and that
guat and goal man who was at the h< ad of the
armies oi the United Slates was pressing m evei}
way the indispensable neeessuv oí taismg means
a few patriotic citizens ot the city of Philadelphia
got together, united then funds and w ith them es
tablished the Bank ot Noith America This was
the fust dawn of light The m ans the money,
ana the credit afforded bv this establishment gav e
at once some aid and relief to the Goi ei nment In
the following year, that is to sa} in 1781 Congress
iound it necessaiy to have a regular system of fi
nance, to appoint a snnermtendent and that super-
intendent re omm«ndc1 to them the mcoiporation
oí this national bank the Bank oí Nonh 4 nenca,
the only one then exis mg And you will find or
w hotver v ill be at the trouble of sea-clung the
journals oí th""- Congrc s will find,^that in that
veil in i daik moment of tne levoluion ' hen
hov ever patriotism abourded as well as diffieu'ty
a 1 danger the resort of those who weie to Leir the
' untof the content ws to a national bank "rid the
national t<mk, upder Gol was among the gieat
means that enabled tnera to accomplish then \ te-
tones axl finally to a^h eve tie independence of
the United States Such v as tne fi- t nat onal
bank—the fust bank indeed, we evei had Its
foundation w as laid b   the 1 ar 1 of p-tnot sni
The n"Xt period, sir, is the establishment ol the
Government of the United States under u e present
constitution m 1789 at which time there were four
banks I think m the United States State banks all
of them At this time, owing to doub's being en-
tertained of the power of Congress, under the arh-
elss of confederation, to establish a national bank,
or whalevei it was owing to, it so happened that
the Bank oí ISoith America, located in the city of
Philadelphia, had accepted a charter from the State
of Pennsylvania, and become a State bank Banks
were by that time also established m Massachu-
setts, m New York, anl in one other State There
were four State banks
When the Government became oigamzed under
the constitution, a national bank was established
in 1791, with a charter fortwenty years Sir, twenty
yeai s of active commerce, twenty years of occasional
commercial revulsion, twenty years of speculation,
occasional, and at times, veiy active if you please,
ior never was there a period m the history of this
country perhaps, during which there was more
speculation in trade, more speculation m land—not
public lands—but lands of all sorts About the years,
1795 1796 and 1797 perhaps a little earlier, every
one who recollects that period w ell knows that fail-
ures were not less frequent, and not less gigantic
than they have been since There weie, besides
the ordinary fluctuations, the ebbs and flows of
business But the bank kept on for the twenty
}ears and during the whole of that period of
twenty vear-., your currency was maintained
throughout the United S ates, and y ou never had
exhibited the scene you now have of a suspension
of specie payments
Well sir that bank expned m 1811, in the
year 1814 specie payments were suspended, and
continued so up to 1817 In 1816 the Congress oí
the United States again resorted to this expedient
of establishing a national bank And here, sir,
allow me to say, and to say it as a matter ol his-
tor}, about w hich it is impossible there can be any
doubt, that this bank was established for the pur-
pose principally if not entire]} of raising the
country out of the state into w hich it had been
thiown for want of a legular cunency for the
circulation and exchanges ol the country Yes,
sir I remember well and if gentlemen will con-
sult the journals of that day, they will find that the
proposition to charter that bank was not reported
by the Committee of Way s and Means of this
house They will hardly discern, in the history
of its establishment a reference to the fiscal watíts
of the Government except so far as those fiscal
w ants weie connected with the ger eral business, and
eunency, and exchanges of the country—with the
business of the citizen But sir you will find that,
passing by the Committee of Way s and Means,
a special committee was raised on the currency—
on the cunency, and nothing else, and that com-
mittee, of which a gentleman, now a distinguished
Senator, was chairman, being appointed upon the
cunency, reported a national bank, and that was
the oank whose charter was passed in March, 1816.
Proceeding tl en sir, histoi ícally, let me say that
that bank full} answered its purpose fiom the pe-
liod of its establishment up to tne period of the
expiration of its chaiter or very near that time
You had a cunency the most uniform, the most
equal of any nation upon earth, beyond all com-
parison Sir, if any gentleman doubt, of this, I
refer him to a speech made by the late William
Lowndes of Sou h Carolina, in the year 1819, m
March A valuable speech it i sir, in all respects,
and worthy of all leliance Mr Lowndes was a
man who, taking his talents his acquirements, and
his unquestionaole integrity, has been excelled by
none/that I have met with n the course of my
public walk through hf<> His early death was a
loss to the country for b°fore that time the leg s-
latureof his S'ate had honored him by nominating
him for President ol the United Slates He was,
too an inquiring and careful man, and seldom
venluied himself without adequate preparation,
in regard to matteis of fact, patiently collecting
them une evei they could be learned JNow sir,
if yon will look at that speech of Mr Lowndes in
1S19 w nen the bank had been about two years m
opei ition y ou w ill find him there stating, as the
result of a eaieful examination that the currency
of the United States by the agency and inder
the auspices of that bank, was more uniiorm than
the currency oí Fiance It is there stated that
the exchange between the most distant points m
the United Sta es was not more than three quar-
ter of me percent whereas the exchange between
Pans and Marseilles was from two to three per
cent
Now this bank had its day but lis departure was
a little anticipated It was given to understand,
some six years before its charter would expire, that
it must then cease to exist; and from that period
