pretense. Frequent roll- calls should be prescribed and enforced. In gross cases of offense, not only the offender himself (the enlisted man) but his immediate commanding officer, should be punished. Especially stringent measures should betaken to force officers intrusted with foraging parties to keep their men together and control them. The safety of the men demands this. In particular, quartermasters and other officers in charge of trains and detailed men must be taught (what they seemed never to have earned) that they are just as responsible for the whereabouts and conduct of their men as the captain of a company is for his, and not only for the conduct of their own men, but for all men about their trains. Let it be instilled into all that the true soldier is chivalrous as well as brave.
