HEADQUARTERS THIRD BRIGADE, RESERVE CORPS, MILITARY DIVISION OF WEST MISSISSIPPI,Kenner, La., January 24, 1865.

Lieutenant Colonel C. T. CHRISTENSEN,

Assistant Adjutant-General, New Orleans:

COLONEL: I got here this morning at 7 o'clock in the Kate Dale. Sent her after the Adriatic and Cowles. She afterward had to haul the Corinthian from aground. The Thirty-fourth Iowa is now embarking on the Kate Dale. Am sorry that the Cowles has been sent up River after wood and will not return till night. This may delay me, for it is doubtful if the Kate Dale and Adriatic can take both regiments. The Twenty-fourth Indiana is ready to embark in the Corinthian, but has as yet no orders to do so.

Very respectfully,

C. C. ANDREWS,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF ARKANSAS,Little Rock, Ark., January 24, 1865.

Lieutenant-Colonel CHRISTENSEN,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

COLONEL: The expedition ordered to Helena, via Augusta, has been ordered to return to Brownsville, the recent rains having made the country almost impassable. While this force, about 1,000, under General Geiger, has been at Augusta it has collected nearly 400 beef-cattle, over 100 animals, and found part forage in the country.

Very respectfully yours, &amp;c.,

J. J. REYNOLDS,

Major-General.
