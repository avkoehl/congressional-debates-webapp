reference to politics, has protection from some general or other for his horses, mules, forage, stock, &amp;c.; without trespassing on these, it will puzzle any one to subsist his command. Please cal attention to this. General Wilson can probably get an order overriding the whole concern; should be done if possible. General Schofield's train is at Franklin, [Ky.]; I have sent to hurry it, and will do all I can to help it. I have detailed some good men to dress in citizens' clothes and scout on the other side of the Cumberland. Two skiffs for these will be kept; all other for forty miles up and ten down I will destroy. Main roads will picket. Will communicate when anything turn up. The force here-Eleventh Minnesota and some negroes, total, 500-should be at the tunnel, seven miles up the railroad. Forrest, if he does get up the [river], could render the railroad useless there in an hour or two for six months. Enough forage for us and the enemy all over the country. My force will be shod completely in two days. Please order every man fit for duty from Camp Webster to this place, and let me have about 400 carbines and enough ammunition to run my supplies to 200 rounds. This is a good location to put everything in trim for a campaign.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. H. HAMMOND,

Brevet Brigadier-General.

GALLANTIN, December 3, 1864.

Major E. B. BEAUMONT,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Cavalry Corps:

This town amounts to nothing, but the railroad tunnel, some seven miles north of this, should be defended. If Forrest crosses the river he could in two hours destroy communication for three months.

GALLATIN, TENN., December 3, 1864.

Major E. B. BEAUMONT,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Cavalry Corps:

Eight companies Twenty-eighth Michigan Infantry with the wagon train; have sent to hasten it, and will help it all I can. My command in camp one mile from Cumberland River on Gallatin road. There are plenty of crossings above and below there; principal ones at Huntsville, six miles by pike, Carthage, thirty-six. I will secure or destroy all boats on the river to these points and twenty miles below. I have detailed twenty men to act as scouts on the other side of the river, and will guard besides. Enough forage in the country. This is a better place to organize than Nashville; can get all I want here except ammunition and carbines. Blacksmiths at work, and have pressed and receipted for enough horses to complete the mounting of my command. About 2,000 convalescent horses feeding here, and the guerrillas stealing them as fast as they are good. Bodies of guerrillas (as many as seventy-five together) are through the country.

J. H. HAMMOND,

Brigadier-General.
