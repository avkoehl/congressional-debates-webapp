the enemy's right to discover his strength and position; drove in his skirmish line, and finding him strongly intrenched withdrew. About noon the enemy in front of Petersburg moved his Fifth Corps toward the Weldon railroad, when he was met by General Heth, who drove him a mile, capturing 150 prisoners.

DUNN'S HILL, August 21, 1864.

The enemy abandoned last evening his position north of James River and returned to the south side. This morning General Hill attacked his position on Weldon railroad. Drove him from his advanced lines to his main entrenchments, from which he was not dislodged. Over 300 prisoners, exclusive, of wounded, were captured. Our loss was principally in Hagood's brigade, which mounted enemy's entrenchments. Supports failing, many were captured.

HEADQUARTERS,August 26, 1864. (Via Petersburg.)

General A. P. Hill attacked the enemy in his entrenchments at Reams' Station yesterday evening, and at the second assault carried his entire line. Cooke's and MacRae's North Carolina brigades, under General Heth, and Lane's North Carolina brigade of Wilcox's division, under General Conner, with Pegram's artillery, composed the assaulting column. One line of breast-works was carried by the cavalry under General Hampton with great gallantry, who contributed largely to the success of the day. Seven stand of colors, 2,000 prisoners, and 9 pieces of artillery are in our possession. The loss of the enemy in killed and wounded is reported to be heavy, ours relatively small. Our profound gratitude is due to the Giver of all victory, and our thanks to the brave men and officers engaged.

Honorable JAMES A. SEDDON,
