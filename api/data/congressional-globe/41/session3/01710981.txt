The next amendment was in section two,
line nine, after the word "rights" to insert the
words '"if any," and in line ten, to strikeout
the word "granted" and insert the word
"guarantied;" so as to make the second sec-
tion read:
Sec. 2. And be it further enacted, That the President
Is hereby further authorized, whenever in his judg-
ment such a measure shall be expedient, to declare
the suspension, in the same manner^ ana with the
like effect as prescribed in the preceding section, of
all laws whereby the vessels of the Dominion of
Canada, or of any other British possession or posses-
sions in North America, to be named in theprocla-
mation. are permitted to enter the waters of the
United States, saving, however, to such vessels such
rights, if anv, as may be guarantied by treaty
between the United States and Great Britain.
The amendment was agreed to.
Mr. CASSERLY. I do not know that I
shall be opposed to this bill on further exam-
ination. It is, however, a most important bill,
and certainly has escaped my notice up to this
moment. 1 would much prefer that the chair-
man of the Committee on Commerce should
allow the bill to lie over.
Mr. CHANDLER. Very well; I will pro-
ceed to another.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The bill will lie
over informally.
Mr. CASSERLY. It touches the question
of our foreign relations very intimately.
SIIIP ROBERT L. LANE.
Mr. CHANDLER. I move that the Sen-
ate proceed to the consideration of the House
joint resolution No. 417.
The Senate, as in Committee of the Whole,
proceeded to consider the joint resolution (H.
U. No. 417) authorizing an American register
to the British ship Robert L. Lane. It directs
the Secretary to issue an American register to
the British ship Robert L. Lane, owned by
William C. N. Swift, of New Bedford, Massa-
chusetts.
Mr. HAMLIN. What are the facts in that
case ?
Mr. NYE. I should like to know what they
are, also. There should be some very good
reason why those cowardly persons who sold
their ships during the war and now want to get
back again under the flag should be allowed
to do so.
Mr. CHANDLER. There is a letter from
the Secretary of the Treasury accompanying
the joint resolution, which will explain it.
Mr. CORBETT. I will state my recollec-
tion of this matter. There wasa large amount of
repairs put upon this ship, being about twenty-
nine thousand dollars in value, I think, at
the Sandwich Islands. A bond was taken upon
the vessel to secure the payment of that
amount, and on its arrival in Boston it was
sold for $20,000. As that is more than three
fourths of the original cost of the vessel, it
comes within the rule prescribed by the com-
mittee ; and therefore we recommend the pas-
sage of the joint resolution.
Mr. HAMLIN, That does not meet the
case at all. I want to. hear the Secretary's
letter read.
The PRESIDING OFFICER, (Mr. Car-
penter in the chair.) The letter will be read.
The Chief Clerk read as follows:
Treasury Department^
January -A, 1ST1.
Sir: My views have been asked in regard to
joint resolution of the Iiouse of Representatives
!No.417,authonzmsran American register to be issued
to the British ship Robert L. Lane, which, itisstated,
was built in New York in 1854, was owned, enrolled,
ami employed as an American vessel until lbw, when
bhe was sold and conveyed to Messrs. Cook &, Co..
ol Glasgow, Scotland. ,
Subsequently, namely, in April, ISoS, the vessel
was repaired at Honolulu,Sandwich Islands, ^.t a
cost of $29 300 78, coin, which repairs were put upon
her by i>. Foster & Co., ship-carpenters doing busi-
ness thereat, but citizens of the United States. JN>
secure the payment of this amount a bottomry bond
was taken mi the vessel eoveringthe sum. The ves-
sel arrived at New Bedford. Massachusetts, in May,
1m, and the bond not being paid was put in suit,
judgment obtained, and the vessel sold by order of
the court for $2d,0U0, currency, to William C. N.
Swift, who now petition* tor an American regibtei.
I reply that the Hubert L. Line, seems to come
within the precedent established by Congress at its
last session in the eases of the Live Oak and Agra,
(joint resolution No. 70, page 379,) and I see no rea-
son why she is not entitled to similar consideration.
I am, very respectfully,
GEO. S. BOUTWELL,
Secretary.
Hon. NathamF.Dixon, Chairman Committee of Com-
merce, House of JCeprescntatives.
