With great respect,

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.

SAULSBURY, September 25, 1863.

Colonel MERSY,

Commanding;

Colonel Hawkins has just received a notice that Colonel Hurst sent a force to Ripley this morning. He is after the same force I mentioned this morning. I deem it prudent not to send a force from here for fear of a collision. Faulkner is 10 miles below Ripley, on the New Albany road.

Respectfully,

J. F. DRISH,

Lieutenant-Colonel [122nd Illinois], Commanding.
