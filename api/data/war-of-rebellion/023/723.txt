who left here for Kingston this morning, push on with the effective part of your regiment by the most expeditious route to McMinnville. On arriving at that point you will await orders from Colonel Forrest, who, with a brigade from Chattanooga, will command the whole expedition. You will subsist your command on the country until your junction with Colonel Forrest. He has funds for the subsistence of the whole expedition. You will attach to your command two companies of Colonel Spiller's battalion, provided two companies fit for service in the field can be found. You should at all events have with you some portion of Colonel Spiller's command, as the men are acquainted with the country and may render you valuable service.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

E. KIRBY SMITH,

Major-General, Commanding.

KNOXVILLE, TENN., July 6, 1862.

Brigadier General C. L. STEVENSON,

Commanding Division, Bean's Station:

GENERAL: I am instructed by the major-general commanding to say that difficulties in the organization of an expedition into Middle Tennessee from Chattanooga made it necessary for him to order Colonel Morrison from Kingston to that district. Colonel Scott's First Louisiana Cavalry has been ordered from Chattanooga to Kingston, and will remain there until the return of Colonel Morrison from the expedition.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. F. BELTON,

Aide-de-Camp.

KNOXVILLE, TENN., July 6, 1862.
