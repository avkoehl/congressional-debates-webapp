Abolition Petitions—Mr. Morris.
SENATE.
Malian, of Biown county, Ohio > Yes, it is so,
but this is but the beginning—a ease of equal out-
iage has lately occurred, if newspapers are to be
relied on, in the seizure of a citizen of Ohio,
without even the forms of law, and who was car
ned into Virginia and shamefully punished by
tar and feathers, and otner digraceful means, and
rode upon a rail, according to the order of Judge
Lynch, and th s only because m Ohio he was an
Abolitionist Would I could stop here—but I
cannot
This slave interest or power seizes upon per
sons of color in our State, carnes them into States
where men are property, and makes merchandise
of them, sometimes under sanction of law, but
more properly by Us abuse, and sometimes by
mere personal force, thus distuibing our quiet and
harassing our citizens     A case of this kind has
lately occurred, where a colored boy was seduced
fiom Ohio into Indiana, taken fiom thence into
Alabama and sold as a slave, and to the honoi
of the slave States, and gentlemen who administer
the laws theie, be it said, that many who havL
thus been taken and sold by the connivance, if
not downright corruption, of citizens in the flee
btites, have been liberated and ad pidged free in the
states wheie they have been sold, as was the enso
of the boy mentioned, who was sold in Alabann
blavo powerts seeking to establish itself in every
fetate, in defiance of the constitution and laws of
the States within which it is prohibited   In oidei
to secure its power beyond the mi h i f the States,
it claims its parentage from the Constitution of
the TJmtf d States    It dfmands of us total silence
as to its pioceeclings, denies to our citi/ ns the
liberty of speech and the press, and punishes
them by mobs and violence foi the exi rciso of
these lights     It has sent its agents into free
States for the purpose of influencing their Legis-
latures to pass laws for the sccunty of its powei
within such State, and for the enacting new of
fenses and now pumshmi nts for their own cm
ions, so as to give additional seeunty to its m-
tirest   It demands to be heaid m its own poison
in the Hall of our Legislative, and minóle in de
hate there    Sir, in every stage of these oppu s  I
«ions and abuses, permit me to say, in the hn
gunge of the Declaration ol Independence—and I
no language could be nion nppiopimtc—we have
petition! d for leduss in llie most humble t mis,
and our íepeited petitions  have l<in nnsuei  el
by icpintul inpiry     A powei, whose ihunctir '
is marked by every act which may define a tyiant, [
is unfit to nili over a fieo people     In oui sufl i   I
nigs and oiu wrongs we have besought oui lei
iow citizens to aid us in the pnseiiation of our I
innstitutiomil lights, but, influenced by the live
of gain or a i bin ai y powoi, they have som< times
disiegaided all the sacred lights of man, and an   i
bwi ri (1 in moIi nee, bin mugs, and minder
Afiei nil these tiansactions, which aic now of
public notoriety and matter of itcord, shall we
i f the fie     States tauntingly bo asked what we
have to do with slave ly *   We should it ]Oice, in
ilea!, if the evils of slaveiy weie lemoved fu
from us, that it could be said with tiuth that we
have nothing to do with sliveiy     Our citizens
have not entered its teriitones foi the puipose of
obstiuctiiig its laws, nor do we wish to do so,
nor would we justify any individual in sueh an j
act, y^t we have been bianded and stigmatized '
by its fuends and advocates, both in the fiee md
slave States, as incendiaries, fanatics, disorgan
izers, enemies to our rountiy, md as wishing to
dissolve the Union   We have borne all this with
out complaint or resistance, and only ask to be
secure m our persons, by our own firesides, anel
in the free exercise of our thoughts and opinions
in speaking, writing, printing, and publishing on
the subject of slavery that which appeals to us to
be just and right, because we all know the powei
of null), and that it will ultimately pievail in dc
spite of all opposition     But, in the exercise of
all llie«e nghts, we acknowledge subjection to the
laws of the State in which we aie, and oui habil
ny for their abuse   We wish peace with all men
md (lint the most amicable lelations and fiee in'
teuourst may exist b tueen the c tizens of our
«¡tit    iid  oui  n ig! boi in  slivi holding & ati s,
iKuill iiiteiiici then States,cithcrmoui pioper   '
pei -. )iis, oi by commissioners, legislative lesolu    I
lions, or otherwise, to mterfeie with their slave ,1
policy or slave laws, and we shall expect from
them and their citizens a like return, that they do
not enter our terntones foi the purpose of vio
hung our laws in the punishment of our people
for the exercise of their undoubted rights—the
liberty of speech and of the pi ess on the subject
or slavery We ask that no man shall be seized
and transported beyond our State in violation of
ourown laws, and that we shall notbe earned into
and imprisoned in another State for ac s done in
our own Wc contend that the slaveholdmgpower
is propeily chargeable with all the riots and dis
oideis which takp place on account of slavery
We can live in peace with all our sister States, if
that power will be controlled by law, each can
exercise and enjoy the full benefils secured by
their own laws, and this is all we ask If we hold
up slavery to the view of an impartial public as it
is, and if such view create astonishment and in
dignation, surely we aie not to be charged as
libeléis A State institution ought to be consid-
eied the pudo, not the shame, of the State and,
it we falsify such institutions, the disgiace is ouis,
not thens
If slaveiy, liowevei, is a blemish, a blot, an
eating earner in the body politic, it is not our
fault if, by holding it up, otheis should sei in the
mirroi of tiuth its defoimity, and shnnk back
fiom the view We have not, and we intend not,
to use any weapons against slaveiy but the mor il
I iwer of tiuth and the fuee of public opinion
If we entei the slave States, and tampei with the
sla\e contiaiy to law, punish us — we descive It,
and if the shveholtlci is found in a fiee State,
and is guilty of a bleach of the law theie, he also
ought to be punished These petitioners, as far
as 1 understand them, disclaim all light to enter
a slave State for the puipose of inteicourse with
the slave It is the m estei whom they wish to
adthess, and they ask and ought to icccivc pro
tection fiom the laws, as they aie willing to be
judged by the laws We invite into the aiena of
public discussion in our State the slaveholder we
aie willing to hear his nasons and facts in favor
of slivciy 01 ngunst Abolitionists we do not
f ar his eiiots while wi nie ouis< hes fiee to com

giee exist between the eitizens of the fiee and
shvi holding States on account of slaveiy an , m
ninny cas s, piopcily ohdigeible to those who
d f net an 1 suppoit slaveiy Attempts, aie almost
il nly making to foice tin execution of slave lews
in the fno States, at least, then powei and prin
ciphs anil no tenn is too íeproaihlul to be
applud to those who lesist such acts, and con
ti nil for the lights secured to every man under
then own laws We an often icminded that we
ought to take eoloi as evidence of piopeity in a
human being We do not believe in sueh tvi
(leiiee, noi <lo wc believe th it a man can justly
b m ide pi operty by human law s We acknow 1
edge, however, that a man, not a thing, may be
held to seivice oi labor undei tin laws of a State,
and if he esiape into anothei State, he ought to
be dclnercd up on claim of the party ti whom
such laboi oi seiviee may be due, that this de
hveiy ought to be m puisuance of the laws of the
State wheie such pcison is found, and not by
vutue of any act of Congress
This brings me, Mi Piesident, to the consider
ation of the petition presented by the Senator
fiom Kentucky, and to an examination of the
views he haspiesented to the Senate on this highly
impoitant subject Sir, I feel, sensibly feel, my
inadequaiyin entering into a contioversy with
that old and veteran Senator, but nothing high or
low shall pievent me fiom an honest discharge of
my duty heie If impeifcctly done, it may be
asenbed to the want of ability, not n tention If
the powei of my mind, and the stiength of my
body weie equal to the task, I would arouse every
man, yes, eveiy woman and child m thecountiy,
to the danger which besets them, if such doe trines
and views as are piesented by the Senatoi should
evei be can led into effect Iiis denunciations aie
against Abolitionists, and under that term aie
classed all those who petition Congies-s on the |i
subject of slaveiy Sueh I undeistand to be his I
argument, mil as such I shut tieat it I, in the
fust place, put in a bioad denial to all hisgencr il
facts, chaigmg this portion of my fellow citizens
with unpiopei  motives, or dangeious designs    |
That their acts are lawful, he does not pietend to
deny I call for proof to sustain his chaiges.
None such has been offered, and none such ex-
ists, or can be found I repel them as calumnies
double distilled in the alembic of slaveiy I deny
them, also, m the paiticulais and inferences, and
let us see upon what ground they test, or by what
pioces« of reasoning they are sustained
The veiy fust view of thee pctitioneis against
oui right of petition, strikes the mind that more
is intended than at first meets the eye Why was
the Committee on the District overlooked in this
case, and the Senator fiom Kentucky made the
organ of communication ' Is it undeistood that
anti abolitionism is a passpoit to populai favor,
and that the action of this Distnct shall piesent
for that favor to the publica gentleman upon this
hobby ' Is this petition piesented as a subject of
fair legislation > Was it solicited by membeis of
Congiess, from citizens heie, for political effect >
Let the country judge The petitioners state that
no persons but themselves are authorized to intci
feie with slaveiy in the District, that Congiess
arc their own Legislature and the question of
slavery m the Distnct is only between them and
then constitued legislators, and they piotest
against all inteiference of otheis But, sir, as if
ashamed of this open position m favoi of slaveiy,
they, in a veiy coy manner, say that some of
them aie not slaveholder, and might be forbid
den by conscience to hold slaves There is more
dictation, more political heresy, moie dangerous
doctrine contained in this petition than I have ever
befoie seen couched together in so many vvoids
We ' Congiess then own legislator in all that
concerns this District' Let those who may put
on the city hveiy, and legislate for them and not
for his constituents, do so, for myself, I came
here with a different view, and foi diffcient pur
poses I came a fiee man, to represent the peo-
ple of Ohio and I intend to leave this as such
i representative, without wealing any other livery
Why talk about Executive usuipation and in-
fluence oici the membeis of Congress' I have
always w wed this District influence as far moic
dang ions than that of any other power It has
be n alie to extoit, yes, extort from Congiess
millions to pay Distnct debts, make Distnct im-
j lovi ments, and in support of the civil and crnn
mat pnispiudcnce of the Distnct
Piay, su, what right has Congiess to pay
the corporate debts of the cities in the District
moi c th m the debts of the corporate cities in your
State anil mine' None, sir Yet this has been
done to a vast amount, and the next step is, that
we, who pay all this, shall not be permitted to
petition Congiess on the subject of their institu-
tions, foi, if we can be pievented in one case, we
can in all possible cases Maik, sir, how plain
a tale will silence these petitioneis Ifslaveivm
the Distnct concerns only the inhabitants and
Congiess, so does all municipal regulations
Should they extend to gianting lottery, gaming-
houses, tippling houses, and othei places calcu-
lated to piomote and encourage vice—should a
repiesentative in Congiess be instiucted by his
constituents to use his influence, and vote against
such establishments, and the people of the Dis
tnct should instruct him to vote for them, which
should lie obey' To state the question is to an-
swei it,otherwise the boasted right of instruction
by the constituent body is " mere sound," signi-
fying nothing Sn, the inhabitants of this Distnct
aie subject to state legislation and State policy,
they cannot complain of this, for their condition
isvoluntaiy,and as this city is the focus of power,
of influence, and considered also as that of fash
ion, if not folly, and as the streams which flow
fiom here ínadiate the whole countiy, it is light,
it is pioper, that it should be subject to State pol-
icy and State powei, and not used as a leaven to
ferment and corrupt the whole body politic
The honoiable Senator has said the petition,
though from a city, is the fiir expression of the
opinion of the Distnct As such I treated it, am
willing to acknowledge the lespectabiluy of the
petitioneis and then lights, and I claim for the
people ot my own Sta e equal lespectability and
equ tl rights that the people of the District are
entitled to any peeuhai rights and advantages I
cannot admit
I agiee with the Senator that the preceedmgs
