Making: public officers depositories.—Mr. Moore.
H. of Reps,
tic and benevolent spirit which pervades and v. aims
an 1 expands their benevolent bosoms
We have heard gentlemen from the East and the
We^t, from the North and the South, mingling
their notes oflamentation over the sufferings ot toe
unfortunate wheiever found Every fibre of their
heads and hearts, every feeling of their souls and
bodies, appears to be attuned to benevolence, and
o vibrate with deepest sympathy at the calamitas
which they assure us have befallen ojr common
countiy Sir, these are h'notab'e feelings, and
highly creditable to human tiatuie Patrrotrsm so
exalted, philanthropy so generous, sjropithy to
sincere, benevolence so pure, 'm'y, s-nddimileicsled,
cannc t fail to challenge our warmest admitation
When we hear r^en smcer \y deplore the misfoi-
tunes of their fellows, we can not but admire, honor
and respect them But how are these feelings of
respect and admiiation strengthened and aug-
mented when we behold them exerting their ut-
most energies m behalf of the unfoi tímate , when
we see tnem piornptly and eagerly i jshing to the
rescue'
And, sir, here I must be permitted to intimate to
my political opponents, that m order firmly to esta-
blish their characters loi snpeuor patriotism and
philanthropy, it will be necessary for them to act
as well as to feel If jon know the remed}, gen-
tlemen, and apply it not, the sincerity of your pro-
fes-ions may be doubted Ihe uncharitable may
surmise that party is your object, and public good
the scapegoat Su, what would we think oí the
patriotism of the man who was able, but unwil-
ling, to succour his countrv in the houi of hei ev-
trem ly' Or what would we say of the benevo-
lence of a phjsrcian, who icfustd to adrrun ster to
hs sick and djmg patient the i "medies which he
knew w ould restore hun tj b/e, helm, and vi&or'
And aie not gentlemen aw?re, tint ''V, ha-1 irg so
constant!), so earnestly, and so eloquently, bew ailed
the fallen fortunes of their country, they will natu-
rally be looked to by that country with anxious
shuddering solicitude for the remedies competent to
heal the deep disease, which, we are told, is prey-
ing upon its vitals'! Are they not aware mat their
benevolence will be questioned, and their sincerity
doubled, even by the confiding ind the faithful1?
But, sir, we have been tokl that th-> friends of
the administration have the power, and that the re-
sponsibility rests with them1 Sir, what are we to
Understand by tins' Is it meant to be rnsinuited
that the administration party in this Hoii'-e have
the powei to relrev e the distresses ot this country,
but that they have not the will to exercise rt' la it
meant to be affirmed that the dominant party are
so utterly destitute of feeling and of patriotism, as
wilLngly and m'entionally to withhold the aid
which they might nghtf illy and constitutionally ex-
tend to the people' Is it their intention to re-
present us to the American people in so odious and
offensive a light1 Sir, I am aware that the gentle-
men m the opposition have long claimed all the
wisdom, and all the worth, and all the decetic),
but I did not suppose, until now, that Ihey also
claimed all the patriotism, all the benevolence, and
all the sympathj
For one, sir, I protest against such unwarranta-
ble and unfounded pretensions I am clearly
against this additional monopoly if the gentlemen
really possess all the chanty and benevolence which
they claim, I trust that they will not be memorable
ton ards us, that they will not thrust us beyond the
pale of humanity, that they will net strip us of all
the common attributes of civili7ed men, nor pamt
us as savages or brut°s, by representing us to be
deaf or indifferent to the voice of dis ress Why
should we be thus treated as guilty of thegio«sest
injustice—of the moat flagrant inhumanity' If the
gentlemen of the opposition do not consider adequate
the means of relief proposed bv the Executive, let
them suggest such as wrll be effective, and, my
life on it, if these means shall be just, proper, and
constitutional, the friends of the admin stration will
cheerfully jreld them their most coidia! a id hearty
support We confess that we know no other re-
medies for the ills complained of than those we
have already suggested And if the gentlemen in
the opposition have it m their power, as they would
have us and the country believe, of proposing an
efhcacioi s and constitutional remedv, io. heaven's
sike let them tell us what it is' If there be a balm
in Chicad—if there be a pnysician theie—let him
administer the balm to our afflicted country Do
not, I beseecn you, gentlemen, do not any longer
keep seciet jour political citholicon, like quack
physicians, but, li'ce good and trae patnots, make it
publicly knov i, that it may be employed for the
healing ol the nation.
My colleague has pronounced (he Sub-Treasury
sj stem nncimslitutwnal, but did rot attempt to pruie
it s>> Now, sir, by way of a set-off, I piononnce
ttnconitUiiltonal the substitute of my coueague, a
national bii k, and so I «hall endeavor to prove it,
by calm and dispassionate irgument A natioml
bank being the principal antagonist mesure to the
bill under discussion, I -had confine my remarks
prmcipa'ly to that subject, and, as this is the only
point th?t has not been fully and thoioughly dis-
cussed in the progress of this debate, theie will be
the greatei propuetj m th s course I shall, there-
fore, a"empt to argue at length this part of the sub-
ject
I can find no authority m the Constitution foi
gianting charters of incorporation, of whatever
name, kind, or description, and no honorable gen-
tleman, I presume, will ha7ard the declaration that
such p iwer is dnectly given to Congress b> the
Constitution The most hardy and reckless advo-
cates of a national batik have never \ entured to
affirm that such power was specific and direct—that
the warrant was express They all resort to the
doctime of implication and construction Su, let
us examine th s doctrine, let us take up the Consti-
tution m a spirit of hones y and soberness, and see
what chnse of tnat instrument, if any,-vests in
Congress even an implied power to ncirpoi<it a
nam mil bank
S ', I iin an Hi- of the us'ii"ss of the subject
which I propose to examine lam aware that the
constitutionality of a national bank has been re-
peatedly discussed by the most eminent jurists and
statesmen of the nation. And I am also aware that an
attempt, on my part, to grapple with a subject of
such magnitude, and under such circumstances,
will be attributed by raanj to a want of discretion,
if not to a culpable vinity Be it so I conceive
it to be my duty—I know it to be my right—to
express my views fullv on this subject, and, al-
though I miv be unable to shed any additional
lighten th > Ung igitittl andvexitiois quesiion
jet I will, neverlne ess, state the arguments ail
considerations which exert a controlling influence
on my judgment. Permit mo then, sir, to call, for a
moment, the attention of the committee to the pe-
culiar character of onr Government It is con-
ceded by all parties, I believe, to be a Governmen
of hmi'ed and specified powers, which powers aie
expressly prescribed b} the Constitution To the
Constitution then,and to the Constitution alone, must
Ccngre^s look for all md every pown thev wojld
exercrs  Unless, therefoie, the power to grant
chaiteis of incorporation be "xpressly gtanted by
the Coi titulion, the exercise of such power, on
thepai iof Congress, would be a viola'.on ot that
instrument But, say gentlemen, al'hough we do
not pretend to assert, that the power to incorporate
is siven in direct terms to Congiess by the Const -
tution, we contend, nevertheless, that such power
is de>ived by fair and legitimate const-uction Bui,
when the advocates of this doctr ne have been
called upon to designate the clause of the Cons i-
tut on which confcis on Congress the power to
incorporate a ba in, they have been sadly pu77led
to comply wuh the requisition, but have wand°rej
and v an'ered from article to írtele, and from
c'ause to clause, seeking in vain for authority
When driven fiom one position Ihey flee 'o
aiother, o prvTeillating, never fixed in their vr vvs
never satisfied with the r own, noi with each
other's arguments No unrtv of op nun pie\ails
among them as to the partrcukr chu-e in the
Constitution, where this doctrine of constructioi
and implicado i, authori? ngac s of incorporation is
to be found, but, like cer am deluded ones of old,
one enes, lo' it is here, and another, !o' it is there,
when, as was the case with the asses of Kish, it
happens, to be "nowhere" But, sir, let us examine
those parts of the Constitution wheie this powei is
said to reside Some have attempted to locate it m
the first article of the eighth section of the Consti-
tution, which gives Congress the power " to Jay
and collect taxes, duties, impos's and excrses, to
pay the debts, and provide for the common defence
and general w erare, of the United States " The
power to " hy and collect taxes" and to "pay the
debts of the United States," m other words, the
power to íaseand appropriate money, and the
power to grant ci arters of incorporation, I believe
ncvei hive been, anl I presume never will be, re-
garded as sv non} mous, even by the most desperate
" co istruc'ro lists ' Those, tr erefore, who pretend
to find aulhonty to grant charters of incorporation,
in ihe article une'e- consideration, must look for it
in the woids ' common defence and general wel-
fare " And it is nomínese words that" some pre-
tend to deuve the power to incorporate a national
bank Can those who havt contended for
this construct on hi* e considered v ell of the
consequences which must mev itably follow from
an exTcise o<* such implied powers' Have
they reflected, thir, by giving to these words the
construction they contend for, they render the enu-
mertted powers of the Constitution nugatory' that
they virtually annul the powers reserved to the
State Governments'' break down all the constitu-
tional guards designed to protect the righ's oí the
Strtes, ^nd of the people, and make the Constitu-
tion itself, in the hands of Congress, what clay
would be m the hands of the potter' And, lastly,
hive they consideied that this doctn íe is flatly
contradicted bv the tenth amendment to the
Constitution, which expressly dediles that "the
powers not delegated to ihe United Slates by
•he Coi stitu ion nor prohibited oy it to tne
Si tes, are i --"rv ed to the States le'pectively, or to
the ptop e' Genual Hami * n, latí mimarían ai
he was on th^ street u con^tru ton h?d too
much regard for his reputation to give to the
words, " to provide for the common defence and
general welfare," a constiuction that would confer
on Congress pow ers not enumerated in the Consti-
tution By reference to his report on manufactures,
it Will be found that he confines, m every instance,
the „pphcition of ihese words to the power given
by the first sen eice of the clause, and m th's par-
ticulir Mr Jeffeison agrees vvitn him The lat-
ter in adverting to this subject, calls it "a gram-
matical quibble, wh o" has countenanced the Gene-
ral Gover ¡miiii'ir aclarmofumveisal power For,"
continues ne, ' in th" phrase to lay taxes, lv pay the
debts, and proiide foi the general uclfare, it is a
mere question of syntax, whether the two last
infinitives are governed by the fiist, or are distinct
and co-ord nate po vers, a question unequivocally
decided by the exact definition of powers imme-
diately following ' Su, I conceive that the clause
of the Constitution under consideration admits of
but two constructions the one limiting the pow-
ers cf Congress, as con'ended by General Hamil-
ton and Mr Jeffuson, the olhei, conferring
on Congress poweis rncomp rtible with the spirit,
and utter'v sublets ve oí all th  express pow-
e s of tie Con tilution—povveis independent o*,and
piiamourt i, the Constitution itseif—i wersmde-
fimt , bound ess, omnipotent It the latter con-
I struuioi be ad rutted, tne v.ill of Ctnapess, ind noi
I the CunitUution, is the law of the land Or if,
1 peradv enture, Congress shou'd think it expedient
' to revert to the Constitution at all, it would only
be neces-pry to refer to thit pi^t of it containing
ths cabalistic worIs "common defeace and gene-
ral welfare," and as ihese words, according to
certain commentators, convey a plenar^ poweronall
subjects, and aie spjijicable to all pases that come
wi'hin the jurisdict on of the national legislature,
it wculd be quite unnecessary to look further.
This would be economeal, withal—saving much
precious time to the people's repiesentatives, which
otherwise might be squandered in wander rg about
th  c institutional kingdom in seaich (asvve'lsearch
for the lost pleiad) of the enumerated powers,
which, nntortunately, have bee i swallowed up by
the nnolied powers dr«eovcied in the words "com-
mon de'enc  and general welfare " Let us sup-
pose 'he doctrine here combatte.il to be a tablished
and carried out into practical legislation Congress
is applied to by a number ol influential individuals
