SEPTEMBER 9, 1863.

General FRAZER,

Commanding Confederate Forces, Cumberland Gap:

SIR: It is now 12.30 [p.] m., and I shall not open fire until 2 p. m. unless before that time you shall have struck all your flags and hoisted in their stead the white flags in token of surrender. I deem this further hour and a half which I grant for a suspension of hostilities as sufficient time to enable you to have received General Burnside's decision.

I have the honor to be, sir, your obedient servant,

JOHN F. DE COURCY,

Colonel, Commanding U. S. Forces North of the Gap.
HEADQUARTERS U. S. FORCES,In front of Cumberland Gap, September 9, 1863.

Brigadier General JOHN W. FRAZER,

Commanding Confederate Forces, Cumberland Gap:

GENERAL: On last evening I agreed to suspend demonstrations until a flag of truce, then pending between Colonel De Courcy, on the Kentucky side of the mountain, and yourself had terminated. I supposed, of course, that I would received notice from you last night some time of the termination of the interview. Judging from your promptness in replying to my flags I apprehend that there has been some mistake in the matter, and send on for explanation of the delay. The troops you may have seen moving this morning are troops that have just arrived, and I have ordered them, in compliance with the agreement, to halt and remain until I hear from you.

I am, general, very respectfully,

J. M. SHACKELFORD,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
