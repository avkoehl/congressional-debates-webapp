The Committeeon Foreign Affairs had reported it back to the
House with the following proposed amendment  Insert, aftei the
word "whatsoever," near the end of the second section, the ful
lowing "other than ports or places within such conterminous
State or colony "
The question was on concun mg m this amendment
Mr HOWARD explained the principles of the bill andthe
amendment proposed by the Committee on Toreign Affairs,
which amendment he himself did not feel very solicitous about
When the Message of the Piesident was relened to the com
mittee, it took it up and examined the subject caiefully, and
went fully into an investigation of all the various topics con
nected with our neutral íelations with other Governments
The great object which the committee kept m view was to pi o
vide the means of executing our duties towards other eoun
tries, without interfering with what Had m this country always
been considered a legal and i ustifiable trade between the citizens
of this and of a foreign country, and it was the consideration oí
this point which had caused much delay and difficulty in tho
committee    When two nations are engaged m war, the light of
the meichants of this country to furnish either party with pro
visions and munitions had always been claimed and exercised,
and there was no disposition in the committee to mlurige this
right    The objectof thecommittoe wis to hive this light re
main upon thesame footing on which it foimeiiy ¡stood, but at
the same time om Government was bound to ¡nevent our cm
zens from interfering in Lhe affairs of a neighboung Govern
ment, for the purpose of stirring up insurrection—of keeping
up a civil war    If this was permitted to be done, the war
might be lolled back upon us, and we would suffei for the m
discretion of a few of our citizens
There is now a danger of our neutrality being violated, and
the wholepiotection of that neiHiality was thrown upon the"
military authority of the Unitod States, and theomtois who
havecharge of that duty ate executing ltuudtr the wt of Cm
gress which this act proposer* to anftnd A high military olh
cer now had charge of this dcln ate trust, and the object oJ this
bill was to give the uvil uuh-omy cognizance of the matin, 01
at least to bring it to the aid of the military power, which wt nld
make it much moie eflective With this view this bill hid been
rtported to the Hnu&e, an 1 he hoped it would be *<pt td ly acted
upon
Mi HOI SEY must confer that he was not altogetlui «satis
fled with the provisions of tin- lull    He thought we ou^ht to
pause before we made any fundament il altci mou in (how pun
ciples in relation to our export trad*, which had ousted <mut
the foundations of oui Government    He consult ltd that om
citizens had a perfect light to carry on i trido with either oí the
belligerent partios in a neighboung Government, whore i fo
reign war existed, without affecting the neutiahty of tho («o
vernment, and he would be son y tosco any rostru tions nn
posed upon this j net and piopei t utile, such a-*ne hand tin*' hilt
would impose    'Ihe proper j revision to make on this snhjirt
would be to prevent our cituens from mteilenng pcHonally m
a dispute m a neighboung Government, but this bill went lai
beyond thai, and put it in the power oí this Government, oi ihe
officers of the Government, to seize any vessels having on board
arms, or any other things which it was supposed u was convey-
ing into a neighboring ten mny, fot (ho pui pope of loin, used

ti guhisfiu in placing it in the hands of die (xomimum or
the ofheers of the Government, to uso itua disuutonny powtr
to the prejudice of tho cuizt n, or thrsei/me of the property of
the citizen    Our citizens, he maintained, hada putt ct u hi 10
trade with either of the contending pamt to awn which might
be going on on tho continent of Europe without í ompt< mming
the neutrality of the United Sítales and hi would not now con
sent, by his vote, lo havetsueh teetiu turns as were proposed by
this bill imposed on the cm/ens of this eoimuy     i hi frimrra
of oui Constitution had guarded our expoit tiade so that no it
stricuons should be imposed upon it in tho shape nl a tax  i nd
why should we in tins m tuner ¡uumpt  to place result uons
upon it, m contravention oí the spirit of the Constitution  if ml
of ihe letter of it    lie < onsidered tins bill oí a chaiacter cak u!a
ted to do great injustice to the people of this touniry  and Ik
called upon the House to pause and reflect, befoio it acted
upon it
Mi LOOMIS, of New Yoik, had íwcn lelm tanlly to propose
an amendment to the bill under coiifcidciation He wot Id pio
pose a substitute for the whole bill
The CHAIR remarked that it was rot at thai time m oider to
propose an amendment, as that repoitcd by the Committee on
Foreign Affam was now pending
Mr LOOMISsaid that he should offer it when in oidei In
the mean time he would briefly submit his view* upon the bill,
as it stood before the House lie was not opposed to the prion
pie which seemed to lie at the foundation.of the bill One of the
very highest duties of ihe Governmen* was to preveru the un
Uwf ul interference by our citizens with ihe quarrels of coumrit ■ 
with whom the Government is at peacp andu was equally the
duty of the citizens toiefram fiom such interference In tins
principie, and in its general application, therefoic he fully
agreed with the chairman of the Committee on 1 oret„o Affair
But he could not consent to go for the me isuie m the form in
which it had been proposed by that gentleman
Mr Looms reviewed the circumstance-* connected with ihe
recent disturbances opon the Canada frontier and contended
that they were of a peculiar chaiacter There wis a long h ¡e
of frontier, separating the two countries fiom each other, >u
niacins so narrow a. barrier between them as to icoder it mi
possible that local disturbances breaking out on on; side of
that Une should not spiead to the other The inn tbitatits of
the American side were peculiarly sensitive or. (hi- \ on t
Theirnative love of liberty, and <4eep rooted h itred ol t> ran ivy
were inflamed, very natuially, whenever an appeal   a*, made
to those noble principes Thus it happened that they weie
verr eastly led to take adeep interest, if not an active part in
those 8tru?2les Abstractedly taken, he would do nothing to
check or to discourage that holy principle, or to extinguish the
bright spark of liberty which burns in Che heart of every true
American citizen    Yet something, he must remember, was
due to national right and national obligation, and for the pre
servationof these, too, he would do every thing possible, but
he insisted upon it that that should he according to the well-
established principles of law
He deemed the bill inefficient to answer the end it professes
to reach What did it propose to do? To give to United
States marshals, deputy marshals, and other officers, power to
seiecj without process of law or any other limitation than then
owuMndividual discretion, any vessel or vehicle, suspected of
bemg used lor the purpose of bearing arms or munitions of
war into the conterniiBous country, to aid in its civil contests,
and to detain them until satisfactory surety should be £i ven
that they should not be used Suppose the ofhcei m whom
this extraordinary power was vested, to have exeicised his
discretion, and in excution of this power, to hive seized the
propei ty of a citizen wh \t does the latter uol 1 he bonds are
fivt-d, it may be assumed, fairly fixed, the burety is found, and
the party pioceeds on his way ovei the Une, into the adjoining
country, in tho very fate and eyes of the officen of Govern
ment Who is to prevent this? In o thing m this lav* gives
any power of prevention to any body What becomes of the
bond' It mn the hands of one ot these orneen* pei haps it may,
by good fortune, have been put into the hands of i distnct
attorney How is he to know whether Ihe obligation has been
violated—the bond bioken? How is he to prove that these
arms or munitions of war, or whatever else had been ¡.eized jnd
given up upon the b md, have been used m the manner desig
nated? Does, bis jurisdiction extend t^ithe only place wheie
ibe^e f icts c in be asccitanied—beVond the hnef
Iheie is another objection to the bill It vests dangeions
and unuauul powers in theofiiccis of Government This fea-
ture was one which stumped thtj bill au Knconsiituiionai, and
against the whole policy ol uui laws It give«t to tfio 1-xt.cu

posed before to be vested in that or am h of the Gov ci riment

metallic so important to j\i«s without of enng the views which
he 1 a 1 e vpit    ed
Mr feXHLI BS considered that it was impo^ib'e for the
Hou e to ai t upon this subject advised to day He theiefoie
moved to postpone the further consueiation of the bill until
Tuesday next, and make u the special order of the day foi that
day
Mr riLtMORK believed that this bill contained provisions
which ought tobe discussed deliberately m committee, and not
acted upon hastily    He therefore moved to commit? the bill to
the Committee of the Wholeon thestateoftheT5nion,and make
it the special order of the day for Tuesday next
Mr CAMBRELENG hoped that the House would make no
more special orders, as gentlemen mu^t have seen the had of
fects of special orders heretofore Prom the disposition mam
fested, he expected thisbill would be discussed pretiy generally,
and he should be sorry to see it thiowu in the way of the appro
pnation bills, by making it the special oidei for 1 uesday The
public service was now suffering in almost every branch for
the want of the parage of those bills, and he anticipated from
the rule, which prevented any now appioprmtion from going
into the regulai appropriation bills, that tho*e bills would be
pa^ed with but little discussion, when they were once
reached
Mt nil ATORE modified his motion, so as to commit the
hill to the Committee of the Whole on the state oí the Union
simply
Mi HOWARD was at a loss to conceive why this bill could
not undergo as fn e tn 1 as full a discu&bion m the House a3 m

He had hoped that oiher business might have been attended to

thissub¡ect that he could not but hope that the House would
