HDQRS. DEPT. MISS. AND E. La., Vicksburg, May 26, 1863.

Brigadier General John S. BOWEN, Commanding, &amp;c.:

GENERAL: In reply to your communication of this day's date,* I am directed by the lieutenant-general commanding to say he cannot inform you whether the position occupied by Colonel Cockrell's regiment will be permanent. They were ordered to this point of the line because it is threatened. Your command being in reserve, it becomes necessary to order the various regiments to different points. The wagon can be sent. In regard to digging trenches, General Stevenson has been advised to attend to this matter. It is expected of your command that they will do any work that may be necessary for the defense of the city at any point to which they may be ordered.

MAJOR: I have the honor to send you, by Captain [James W.] Mangum, of General Moore's staff, a battle-flag, brought in last night by Private Steward, SECOND Texas Regiment, and to inclose the accompanying notes from General Moore and Colonel Smith. I respectfully recommend that the request therein contained be granted.

I am, major, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JNO. H. FORNEY.

Captain [JAMES M.] LOUGHBOROUGH, A. A. G., Moore's Brigade:

CAPTAIN: I have the honor to send to the general commanding the brigade, another Yankee flag. These colors were brought in yesterday from the battle-field by Private [A. J.] Stewart, of Company C, SECOND Texas, where they were abandoned by the enemy when repulsed in the battle of the 22nd instant. It would be a high satisfaction to the members of the SECOND Texas Infantry if the lieutenant-general commanding shall be pleased to permit us to reclaim hereafter these colors, to be preserved by us as a memorial of the hard day's fight, in which the enemy were forced to abandon them on the field.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,ASHBEL SMITH,

Colonel, Commanding SECOND Texas Infantry.

I inclose also the note of Colonel Smith, Commanding SECOND Texas, and would respectfully request that, if consistent with the views of the lieutenant-general commanding, the flag may be given to the regiment.

I am, major, your obedient servant,

JNO. C. MOORE.
