Major General B. F. BUTLER, Fortress Monroe:

Start on the date given in my letter. * There will be no delay with their army. Answer, that I may know this is received and understood as regulars date.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

CULPEPER, May 2, 1864.

Major-General BUTLER, Fortress Monroe, Va.:

I have ordered Brigadier-General Carr to report to you. He is now commanding a division in this army, but the Senate refusing to confirm him with the date of his appointment will make him gainer to the brigade commanders who have been serving under [him]. If it embarrasses you to give him a brigade you need not give it. His reputation as an officer is good.

U. S. Grant,

Lieutenant-General.
