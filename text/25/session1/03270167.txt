25th i ong.....1st S?sb.                             Making; public officers depositories—Mr. Webster.                                                Senate.
mmd, the most alarming proposition that has ever
been piesemed io the American People In a am
did our rev)lutionary Mres shed their blood in the
ionlest for liberty, m vam did the sages and pat-
riots of thai, eventful epoch contend for the glorious
p íviieges which we enjoy, if, at this dat of the Re-
public, we are to surrendei up to the Executive,
aid to his immediate adviseis, the liberties of this
great Peop'e fei-, when the patriot dai!} sees the
immense povveis claime 1 ioi, and exercised bv, tne
Executive, ha^ he notjust cause for alarm' The
i cto powei is his, the csrmv is his, the navy is his,
ihe appointing and renovmg poner of all the infe-
nor olicis of Gnernment is his, the sworI is
hi'-, and ho now asks for the purse Shall vvegive
u t) him' Shall we surrender up the treasmes of
th" nation—ihe hard earnings of the People—into
lti« hinds, as is proposed by this bill'' Neiei, Mi
Pfsuleni, with mv consent—nevei, nevei I spe lk
not with lefetence to the piesent Chief Masistiate
T  m discussing this matter upon principle Su, I
hive reason for alarm w hen I see the other noweis
of th  Government surrendered up, one at a time,
eifhei before or after the exeicise of the ve o, f> the
w H of one man How can I forbear ti look \ ith
jealousy and alaim at i piwei so inordinate m its
decires, and so ii<ni!fing in its effects? rhis till,

this mattei upon tnem not presumí to i tot It is
not your paiuiment roll, called a Const tut on, that
holds this- People togethei, it is a supposed c immu-

mei   tney wdl lose all attach nent to the Constitu
tton, and either dissolve themselves from a Govern-
ment of requisitions and buidens, and not of bene-
fits, or they will seek redress m a change of rulers
And, sit, I am no prophet, yet, judging from the
vo ce you have heard from the West and the re-
sponsive echoes from ihe Eas*, if you carry these
measures, m ti e course of mv senatorial term of
six years ton will «ee these tables turned, and a
confident majoiity (educed to a harm'ess rmnouty
heie, and in that event, mark mj words to-aa\ —
ton will hear a voice long and loud coming fiom
that mmonfv cnirg for ano her divoice fiom the
evi's of this measure I hope in this I maj be
mis aken, but such are my opinions of theevilcon-
sequences which must íesu t íi m this measure,
that I hazard the opinion
Bit', sir, as the íepiesentative in pait of one of
flip western States, I protest against this measure
as being of tne most noxiouscharaclei toom inter-
est Does no eveiy western man see mat ifs
practical effec t must be to dram all oui specie from

A_gam I object to this bil' as b m^ whotlv illu-
sors and pitsentin, a filse issue to ti e People It
is not a question now, whether the People w id hate
specie or paper in their common bus np«s transac-

State banks thev are the eieatuie of ti e ligsla-
ttties of the diffeient States and whethei this, bill
passes or not, the People of tt e States will have a

I cannot go for the amerdmeit of the Senalor
fnm South Caiolma II assumes the same pin-
ciple of the bill that is, that the Government, 11
(he collection ot its elites, will, at gi en oe ioi , re-
fuse to take the paper of specie pat mg banks, and
w V collect all its revenue in specie I object to
the prmciplp, and cannot give any vote that can
be construed into a sanction of such doctrines
The amendment of the Senator from Missouri is
still worse in principle The amendment gives, a
premium, on the part of Government, of one per
cent for a1! the gold that may be paid by her
debtors i What does this mean'! What can be
the object"2 Is it to diaw all the gold of the countrv
into the Got ernment vaults for tne benefit of its fa-
t orites 1 For if the Government gives one per cent,
surely she will not pay it out m her ordinary busi-
ness transactions at par
I cannot close mj remarks, Mr President with-
out saving that I entertained s'rong hopes, when I
came here, (hat w e should be able to unite on «ome
measure (hat \ ould restore confielence, regulate the
curienc}, and give relief to the People But I am
now compelled to say that, in my opinion, w e shall
do nothing >o meet their just expectations and mv
ion lest hones will end m disappointment I shall
tote, as a choice oí evils, for the bnl ot the genlle-
iiiaii from Virginia, but I must sat I ha/e little or
no eoufidence in it Still I do not think it so objec-
tionable as the sub tieasurj scheme My op mon
has been, and «till continues to be, that experience
has pioven that a national bank, projierly guarded
in ifs piowers, is an i idisjiei sable fiscal agent to the
Government, as well as aosotutely necessarj as a
general regulatoi of the cuuency and of the ex-
changes, and of the issaes of the local banks A
maiontv heie, however, think otheiwi^c, and it will
be foi the People ultimate j to decide, the matter,
and in that rhosion let all acquiesce I am sure I
have no personal mttiest in sustaining anj bank
I nevei cw neo a elollai of stock m a bank in my
life, nor do I exoect to elo so but I hat e an interest
in sustaining those measmes that may benefit the
People Their interest is my inferes , and my in-
terest is their interest
Mr President, I know I have occupied too much
or the t me of the Senate, yet I offer no other apol-
0"/v thai the importance of the subject, and in re-
sum ig n v s"it I return to the Sen ite my unfeign-
