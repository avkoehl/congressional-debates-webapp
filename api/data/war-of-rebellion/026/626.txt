FORT MONROE, April 17, 1863.

Major-General PECK:

There are eight Navy gunboats on the Nansemond, six at and below West Branch. The enemy must cross if at all [high] up. The battery at West Branch was silenced after disabling the Teazer. Lieutenant Cushing is confident the railroad from Philadelphia* is reopened and the bridge rebuilt. If so, the enemy is at ease as to supplies.

JOHN A. DIX,

Major-General.

SUFFOLK, VA., April 17, 1863.

Major-General HALLECK,

Washington:

It gives me great pleasure to say that I hold everything. The enemy maneuvered to throw me off my guard on the river blow, which had the effect opposite to his wishes. Instead of withdrawing I re-enforced considerably. New troops have just arrived. Whether they arrived or not, no yielding or surrender would be permitted.

JOHN J. PECK,

Major-General.

SUFFOLK, VA., April 17, 1863.

Major-General DIX:

I have ordered Major Stratton with a force to South Mills to hold that outlet at all hazards and to watch General Hill's moves. He is directed to communicate with any troops at Elizabeth City. My line will be the Nansemond River, the Dismal Swamp to the Pasquotank River. General Viele will of course aid all he can with his men.

JOHN J. PECK,

Major-General.

SUFFOLK, April 17, 1863.

Major-General DIX:

Longstreet has not asked for the women and children. All communication is cut off for them, and they can get no supplies from without. In a short time they will have to be fed by us. I believe I shall call upon him to remove them or feed them.

PECK,

Major-General.

FORT MONROE, April 17, 1863.

Major-General PECK:

More troops have gone. I have now sent 7,400. Give me every morning a brief resume of the preceding twenty-four hours, and I will advise the General-in-Chief. I think of going up the Nansemond this morning to West Branch; perhaps higher up.

JOHN A. DIX,

Major-General.
