ADJUTANT-GENERAL U. S. ARMY,

Washington, D. C.:

SIR: Tranquillity prevails throughout the department, except in the District of Humboldt, where the Indian war is being prosecuted vigorously and successfully. Colonel H. M. Black, Sixth Infantry California Volunteers, has been zealous and indefatigable in pursuing the enemy, and his officers and men have endured the hardships and exposures of that inhospitable region amid the snows and rains with the greatest cheerfulness.
