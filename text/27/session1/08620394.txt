again What' had it come to this, that they were to be deem-
ed wanting m respect to the Preeident if they spoke their sentí

would notdo it, in order to shieid the Piesident fiom the wide

were told that we should be moderate, that we sho 3d speak in
leimsof mildnessand conciliation, and not evince the shsthieat
displeasure or disappiobation, at the mostextraordmary course
which he had taken Now, he (Mr h ) wou d tell gentlemen
that they might cry "peace," "peace," but there would be no
peace. This nation would instantly be convulsed toitsveiy
centie, a«d the usIow, unmoving finger of scorn," whether in
highpla es or low places, would be pointed ai the President

such terms as he andeveiy one else hada in; it to v-ak, undei

The gentleman from Vnginia. [Vlt Gilmdii] has told us (con
tinued Mr L) that if Mi Tylei ha'j at the commencement of
this session, given 11 his adhesion to Mr Clay, all would have
been wei —that we should have hdd no diflu ulty, ai d that the
qusis ion ofihe succession has had much to do with oui present
difficulties Mi Clay's friends so far as I know, have not ai t

tion. that thei e remains any question of ct nsti utiooal power m
regard to a Bank, to aigue abou*.
To argue lor the constitutional power of Congress to establish
a Bank, is to admit thai tt is an open question It 1^ to doubt
the powei ol the Supreme Couit to decide the question, it is to
doubt the authority of the Constitution, which tefeis the ques.
tion to that tribunal, it is to doubt the existence of the Court,
and the existence of the Constitution and the existence of this
Government Sn, it istieason— moral treason—atmn g at the
life of the faneat lot mol Government ever yet devised, and
whuh cannot be des-, iyedor paialjzed without moie mischief
to human rights, to human libeiiy, to human imf tovement and

speech of the honoiable member from Kentucky [Mr MAR*

t^manfion MassachufretosfMt Aduts] I cannot discover
that the act of a totaie Lesisla'tue expressing the dissent of

final Theie is, m my opinim, no ground 01 pretence for say*
