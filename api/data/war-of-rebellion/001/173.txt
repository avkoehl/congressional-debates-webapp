ning slowly past the fort at night with lights out, and close in to the fort, suddenly turned and headed directly in towards the fort. When very close our sentinel fired. The boat then sheered off and went out towards the bar. Loud voices and noises, as of riotous conduct, are reported as being heard on board.

If it should happen that supplies are sent to us by the Government, would it not be well to include cement and bricks enough to form some embrasures on the second tier?

I propose, if it meets your wishes, to write every day, if only a line, so that you may know if there is any interruption of the communication.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. G. FOSTER,

Captain, Engineers.

Colonel S. COOPER,

Adjutant-General:

COLONEL: I have the honor to report everything quiet, as far as we know, around us. Yesterday a few workmen were occupied apparently fitting the blinds in the embrasures of the bomb-proof battery on Cummings Point. A gun was fired yesterday in the direction of the channel from a point just eastward of the battery between the bomb-proof battery and the one which fired on the Star of the West, showing that vessels will be under fire from Morris Island after they pass the first battery.

I inclose another sketch* by Captain Seymour, showing the appearance of our area-battery of one 10-inch columbiad and four 8-inch sea-coast howitzers; also, a ground-plan indicating the positions and bearings of the guns in the area. These little memoranda, kindly and cheerfully prepared by the captain, give clearer views of the batteries than I could by my letters.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

ROBERT ANDERSON,

Major, First Artillery, Commanding.

No. 45.] FORT SUMTER, S. C., February 15, 1861.

Colonel S. COOPER,

Adjutant-General:

COLONEL: I find that the adjutant made a mistake yesterday in not sending the sketch mentioned in my letter. He thinks that there was something in the envelope when he put the letter in which he supposed was the sketch. I have add another sketch to-day exhibiting the direction of and giving the distances from the walls of our work to the surrounding batteries, &amp;c. I send also a copy of the reply of the Hon. D. F. Jamison to my communication in reference to the guard-boats. Like every other letter I have had from him, it is courteous and straightforward. I have the honor to report that for the last twenty-four hours nothing unusual has been noticed as having occurred around us. Yesterday afternoon there was loud and long-continued cheering at Cummings Point, but on what account we know not.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

ROBERT ANDERSON,

Major, First Artillery, Commanding.
