being done there, and what, in your judgment, it is advisable to do. This of course involves an estimate of the enemy's force and defenses, the condition of our army, whether active operations on our part are advisable, or whether it should limit itself to its defensive position, and, if so, what troops can be spared from that department to re-enforce the Army of the Potomac. You will report by telegraph the result of your observations, as directed in the telegram of General Grant. If troops can be spared form the James River the number will be telegraphed to the War Department for the proper orders, and the Quartermaster-General will prepare the transportation to Belle Plain or Port Royal, as may be directed.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.

Major-General BUTLER:

I will report the number of engineer tools as soon as I get reports from the officer in charge of them. General Walker is not dead, but doing well, and can be moved very well.

Major-General, Commanding.

GILLMORE'S, May 21, 1864. (Received 2.05 p. m.)

General BUTLER:

As the woods are now being cut in the ravine on my right, I would recommend not to build the parapet for the 30-pounders until we ascertain the best position for it. The slashing may open out our view considerably. I asked this morning for ten or twelve 8-inch siege mortars for my lines.

Q. A. GILLMORE,

Major-General.
