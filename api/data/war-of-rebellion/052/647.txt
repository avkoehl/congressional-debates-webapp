SEPTEMBER 15, 1863-1.30 p. m.

I sent it last night at dusk by a very intelligent corporal, with the plainest directions, and have not heard from him since he left my camp. I instructed him to see General Crittenden at the earliest moment possible, and after delivering him the dispatch to go to Chattanooga and bring my supply train up.

Most respectfully,

S. D. ATKINS,

Colonel Ninety-second Illinois.
HEADQUARTERS FOURTEENTH ARMY CORPS, Stevens' Gap, September 15, 1863.

General REYNOLDS,Commanding Fourth Division:

You report just received by messenger. The general suggests a second reconnaissance in the direction of Catlett's Gap; the reconnaissance to be made with care, avoiding any serious engagement. If, however, you find the road referred to in Colonel Jones' report in a condition to be held with safety, to hold it. All reports indicate that the enemy are retiring, but the fact is not fully established. General McCook arrived to-day. His troops will be here to-morrow.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEO. E. FLYNT,

Assistant Adjutant-General and Chief of Staff.
