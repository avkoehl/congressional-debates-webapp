June 6, 1864-9 a.m.

Division commanders of the Ninth Corps will, on the receipt of this order, place all their wagons, caissons, and artillery not in position in some sheltered place, near their commands and in such a position as to move readily when ordered. If necessary, roads will be cut through the woods on to the Cold Harbor road. Staff officers should examine and make themselves acquainted with the roads over which trains will pass.

By command of Major-General Burnside:

Captain and Assistant Adjutant-General.

General BURNSIDE,

Ninth Army Corps:

GENERAL: I did not send out the small reconnoitering party as ordered by Captain Van Vliet, as I found the enemy's skirmishers advancing. They are now along my whole front, except the extreme right, which is so much refused that they are not likely to come there except they attempt a flank movement. I think if we had held our old line, fortified the hill on my right, and run a short line back to the swamp, our position would have been much stronger than now. As it is, I am holding the hill with a strong force of skirmishers. It enfilades most of the position to the felt. The enemy took several prisoners, and seen pretty well. There is a small force of Second Pennsylvania Artillery (First Division) on the road over which the wagons came. If not already ordered, they had better be withdrawn, as I have a regiment in their front and they are not far enough from the main line to be of any use.

Your obedient servant,

ROBERT B. POTTER,

Brigadier-General.

[General BURNSIDE:]

GENERAL: Quite a heavy fire of artillery, as you perceive, is being opened to my right and rear. I can't tell where it comes from, but have sent to find out. It comes from where I supposed General Wilson to be, or about in that direction, making this vicinity pretty hot. It may fall over Wilson into Crittenden's line.
