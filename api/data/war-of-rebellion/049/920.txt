HEADQUARTERS FIRST BRIGADE,Harper's Ferry, Va., October 14, 1863.

Lieutenant S. B. McCULLOCH,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General:

LIEUTENANT: I have the honor to report that Colonel Simpson, commanding forces at Charlestown, informs me that all his available cavalry force is out with orders to proced to Berryville. He has pickets well out on the Smithfield and Summit Point roads. Will send immediately any information he may receive. He reports everything quiet and no news.

While writing the above, I received another dispatch from Colonel Simpson, which states that he learns from a reliable source 6 miles beyond Berryville that there is no force in the valley advncing, and there is no rumor there to that effect. Sunday last some of our cavalry passed through bound up the valley, supposed to be Cole's.

In Winchester it is rumored that the citizens were expecting a force there last night.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEO. D. WELLS,

Colonel, Commanding Brigade.

Lieutenant S. B. McCULLOCH,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General:

LIEUTENANT: I have the honor to report that I am informed by Colonel Simpson that the scout sent out by my orders have returned to Charlestown. They proceeded to within singt of Berryville, and drove in the enemy's pickets, supposed to be White's battalion. Some 80 or 90 of the enemy came out and attempted to flank them, and our scout fell back, their number being too small for attack. They could learn of no force approaching down the valley. The scout of 2 men sent to the Blue Ridge returned, being unable to proceed by that route. Colonel Simpson asks if it is desired that they should attempt any other.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEO. D. WELLS,

Colonel, Commanding Brigade.

COLONEL: The colonel commanding directs me to inquire of you the reason why the cavalry scout were unable to proceed along the Blue Ridge. He instructs me to direct that you will continue to scour the country in front of you with small parties of cavalry, and send in any information which may be obtained.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant.
