THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

tary m relation to the removal of the public de-
posites be taken up and considered
Mr C said that the chai ter of the Bank of the
United States pi ov ded for the deposite of the pub-
lic moneys in that bank and its branches It also
vests m the Secietary of the Tieasury the power
of removing them to oUic places of deposite when
he may think propei, but it Siso requires him to
give his reasons for so doing to the next Congress
fne removal of the deposites had taken place, and
the Secretaiy h id told ub it was by his order, and
he submitted his reasons for doing so When the
chartei of t n. bank authorized a removal of the
public moneys nom us vaults,, it intended and
expected that wnen the an was done some suffi-
cient reasons should be given for it, and that Con-
gress should look at them, and examine into their
sufficiency Those reasons are now before us,
and we aie to decide whethei the measuie was a
proper one, according to the Constitution and laws
of the count!y, and if there was- one question
of public consideration of more importance than
another, it was that which related to the custody
of the public treasure Now was the time to in
quire into the condition of the Treasury The
present Vice Pi esident had once said that we ought
to mquiie where the lost rights of the States were
Now he (Mr C ) wanted to inquire where the
Treasury of die United States was He conceived
it to be his duty as a Senator here to bring this
question up And as we were to judge whether
the Secretary of the 1 reaaury had acted wisely in
this matter, we ought to judge of his íeasons be
fore the who!  Senate, and not refer it to a com-
mittee In oider to do this, he hoped a day not
far distant would be appointed for its considera-
tion He would therefore propose that the report
of the Secretary be made the order for Monday
next
Mr BENTON said that the Secretary of the
Treasury had announced distinctly his reasons for
the removal to be on account of the miscorduct of
the Bank of the United States He has charged
the bank disanctly with interfering with the purity
of elections, with corrupting and subsidizing the
press, with dishonoring its own paper and that of
its branches Here were charges of great crimi-
nality on the part of the bank, and the question
was whether we ought to go into a trial of the case
here or refe it to some committee in the Senate
The House of Representatives, he contended, was
the proper body before which the subject ought
to be investigated, although he confessed the Sen-
ae could enteitain it He wanted to examine
these charges against the bank, and therefore he
thought the epoit ought to be referred to a com-
mittee
The postponement was agreed to
Mi CL4Y submitted the following resolution,
which was read and laid on the table
Resolved, That the President of the United States
be requested to inform the Senate whether a paper
under da e the------day of September, 1833, pur-
poi ting to have been read by him to the 1 eads of
the several Depaitments, relating to the deposites
of the public money in the Treasury of the United
S ates, and alleged to have been pub'ished by his
authority, be genuine or not, and if it be genuine,
that he be also requested to lay a copy of said
piper before the Senate
Mr WEBSTER, on leave given, presented a
bill to provide satisfaction for the claims of citi-
ze ib ol the United States for French spoliations,
which passed to a second leading
Mi WILKÍNS, on leave given, presented a
bill for the íelief of A G Ralston ani Girard
Ralston, which passed to a second reading
Mi KING submitted the following íesolution,
which was iead and laid on the talle
Resulted, That the Committee on Indian Affairs
be i istiucted to mq me into the expediency of au-
thonzing the Piesidert of the United States to
appoi it an agent to re< eive evidence of losses sus-
tained by the inhabitants of the now State of Ala
lann by a hostile eruption of a party of Creek
Indians m th ye.ii lb!4, by which Fort Mint,
was t ilcen, and those who had fled there for pro-
ttction massacred

Mr BENTON submitted the following resolu-
tion
| Resolved, That the Secretary of the Treasury be
! directed to communicate to the Senate any inform-
ation in his power or possession to show that the
Bank ot the United States or its branches, at any
time heretofore, have refused or delayed to receive
the notes of any of the branches in payment or
deposite
The Senate then proceeded to the order of
the day, and resumed the consideration of Mr
Sfrague's resolution to alter the mode of electing
then standing committees by the Senate, instead
of being, as formerty, appointed by the President
pro tern
i Mr WHITE (Presidentpro lem ) renewed the
request which he had previously made, to be ex-
cused from voting
Mr CLAY, believing that the President was
impelled to make this request from a sense of deli-
cacy, and disposed to feel the highest respect for
him and his motives, he presumed the Senate
would not hesitate to agree to it, and he submit-
ted a motion to that effect
Mr GRUNDY could not, from a sense of duty,
corsent to this motion,and trusted that on further
reflection the President himself would withdraw
it He (Mr G ) was opposed to it, because he
thought the right of voting belonged to the office,
and ought to be exercised by the occupant of the
l chair until the rule itself vas altered The re
quest, he knew, had proceeded from a nice sense
. of honor on the subject at issue, and he would have
been happy if he could*, consistent with his sense
j of duty, comply with it If he had asked to be
, excused, he saw little if any difference in the re
i spective situations of himself and the President if
he was excused In that case, if he (Mr G )
voted for the motion, he voted to give himself that
increase of power which he voted to take away
from the President, the only difference being that
the President might have it in his power to vote to
retain a greatei portion than he could have There
was another consideration which to him appeared
of some force the chair was occupied only tem-
porarily circumstances might arise by the follow-
ing day by which the Vice President appointed by
the Constitution to occupy the chair might arrive,
and m ti e meantime, by now declining to vote,
or the Senate by agreeing to excuse, a radical
change in the rule of then proceeding, and having
an important influence, might thereby be produced,
which he thought it desirable to avoid For these
reasons he regietted that he could not comply with .
the wishes of the President                                        |
Mr CLAY, in explanation, said that he was
influenced, in acceding to the wishes of the Presi-
dent to be excused, simply from the consideration
that it appeared that he continued to feel, after due
reflection upon the subject—after the intervention |
of a night since the request was first made—the
same delicacy as to voting on this question He
could not see any foice in the grounds upon which
the motion was to be opposed He denied that
the honorable Senator and the President were in
the same situation as to the relative power to be
acquired by them under the circumstances, the
relative power of the honorable Senator being only
in the propoition of rorty one to one, whilst on
the othei sid e it was a question whethei the cower
would devolve altogether upon one man He was
always disponed to applaud the motives by which
it appeared the honoiable Pi esident was actuated
He, i' appeared, wis not disposed to re'ain power
n the piesent ins'nnce Wi'h íespect to the sug
gestión that the Vice Piesident shou d am eon
the nionow, he would say he regretted his ab-
s°nce, for if he had been here, as he ought to have
been,at the post assigned him by the Constitution,
the Sen ite v/ould 1 ave been saved the necessity of
the present motion, as it would then follow, as
matter ot course, that the former practice of elect-
ing committees by ballot would of right devolve
upon them He repeated, that he was only influ-
enced by motives of delicacy and respect towards
the high minded gentleman wh,o occupied the chair
m submitting the motion in accordance with his
wishes, and he would willingly withdraw it, but
could not do so until he had an intimation to that
effect from him
Mr GRUNDY said, when the Vice President
would arrive here he was not informed He
would say, however, what he knew on the sub-
ject, and that was, that for the last three or four
sessions the Vice President never had arrived in
the Senate until the Presiding Officer had ap-
pointed the committees He did not argue upon
the propriety or impropriety of his absence, but
he would say that his predecessors had acted in the
same way It might be wrong, but if that gen-
tleman had acted in conformity to practice and
usages of his predecessors, which had not been
objected to, why ought it now to be complained
of As to avoiding or assuming responsibility,
he viewed that matter in this way when it was
the duty of an officer to act, let him act He ob-
jected to the Presiding Officer being excused from
voting on this question, because he could not con-
sent that the State of Tennessee should have but
one voice in determining it
Mr CALHOUN said that, as allusions had been
made to himself, he felt compelled to make a re-
mark, although he had intended not to have taken
part in the discussion He never knew that there
was an understanding that the Vice President
should absent himself to enable the Pi esiding Offi-
cer to appoint the committees He trusted that
no gentleman would charge him with having ab-
sented himself at the commencement of the ses-
sion to avoid the responsibility of appointing the
committees His absence had been solely caused
by domestic affliction, or some other unavoidable
cause He never had absented himself on that
account He concurred with the gentleman from
Mississippi [Mr Poindexter] that appointments
should be made by the Senate itself
Mr WHITE, the PresidmgOfficer,begged leave
of the Senate to make a few remarks (Leave was
granted ) Mr W then said that he felt very del-
icately situated on this subject If he voted aga nst
the proposition, it might be supposed he acted on
the principle that power is never so well exercised
as when it is m our own hands If he voted to
take the power away from the Presiding Officer, he
might be charged with having been governed by
the principle that he dreaded the responsibility.
There was no duty more unpleasant than the ap-
pointment of the standing committees, and he
thought no one had so performed that duty as to
give entire satisfaction to  eveiy member pf the
Senate, and it was difficult, if not impossible, for
any gentleman to perform it with satisfaction to
himself If it was the "pleasure of the Senate to
excuse him it would give him pleasure, but if he
were compelled to vote, he should do so to the best
of his judgment, and accoiding to the dictates of
his own conscience
On the question excusing Mr White from
voting, Mr GRUNDY called for a division, when
there were, yeas 21, nays 19
Mr FORSYTH said that the manner in which
the commit'ees were constituted was a matter of
perfect indifference to him But, from the manner
in which the conduct of a distinguished gentlerrjan,
(the Vice President,) then absent, had been tieat-
ed, he felt bound to make a few remarks in his
defence He had always understood that the rule
was an invitation to the Vice President to absent
himseif so as to give the Senate an oppoitumty of
appointing its committees by one of its own mem-
bet t. As to the absence of the Vice President, he
knew thit that gentleman remained away from
respect to the rule, from respect to himself, and
from respect to the members of the Senate He
knpw well, fiom the known ehaiacter of the gen-
tleman whose conduct is here impeached, as well
as from his past history, that he never shrunk
from any duty which the station to which he had
been called imposed upon him Committees were
appointed to collect facts and to stale them fairly,
they were not to oe understood as expressing the
voice of the Senate We speak by our laws and
resolutions God foibid that we should speak by
our committees, which very frequently leport and
say very strange things    The object of commit-
