When the committee rose on a former day, Mr G Davis
had moved an amendmentto the item JSo 15, m relation to the
contingent expenses of the State Department, winch amend-
ment i-s in the following woids
'And all other job printing, binding, and stationery, in any

And, the question being on the amerdment to he amend-
ment, and Mr Wise being entitled to the floor,
Mr riLLMORC raided the point of ordei that the amend
ment was out of ordei, on the clause to which it was offered and
which was merely an appropriation for the contingent and inci-
dental expenses of the State Depaitment, wheress this was a
different subject, prt posing to provide another plan for ihe
prn ting of Congress than that now established bylaw The
amendment was entirely out of order, and not relevant to the
subject of this clause
Mr WISE said it was an amendment to the amendment of
