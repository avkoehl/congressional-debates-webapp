FORT SUMTER, June 26, 1864 - 8.30 p. m.

The enemy's tents on Morris Island have considerably increased number; our flag-staff was cut down twice to-day within two minutes; the second time while being replaced, in the face of sharp fire, by Privates Walter Steele, of the Fist Guard Artillery, and D. E. Badger, Company I, Twentieth South Carolina Volunteers, to whose gallantry I beg leave to call attention. The last staff put up has since been splintered. The enemy's staff at Battery Gregg was shot down from Fort Johnson. Private Moses Davis, Gist Guard, has been severely wounded and his leg cut off.
