[CHAP. XLIII.

Harrison is somewhere in rear of Waterproof, on Saint Joseph.

Will write you as soon as I return from Fayette. I have written to General Ellet, at Rodney, and requested him to co-operate.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. Q. GRESHAM,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS U. S. FORCES,Natchez, Miss., December 21, 1863.

Brigadier-General ELLET,

Commanding Marine Brigade:

GENERAL: I will start to-day at 2 o'clock with three regiments of infantry, four pieces of artillery and 200 cavalry for Fayette. Will be at Fayette by 7 or 8 to-morrow morning, and attack Wirt Adams if he stands. Would be glad to have your co-operation from Rodney.

I am, general, very respectfully,

W. Q. GRESHAM,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

NASHVILLE, December 22, 1863-7.30 p.m.

Brigadier General W. D. WHIPPLE,

Chief of Staff:

A rebel on the river below Palmyra reported to Captain Abel, of steamer Piketon, that Forrest with 7,000 cavalry was on the Tennessee seeking a crossing to operate on the Cumberland, and that 500 guerrillas about 4 miles back of Palmyra had assembled to help him.

L. H. ROUSSEAU,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS CHIEF OF CAVALRY, MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,Nashville, December 22, 1863.

Colonel HICKS,

Fortieth Illinois Commanding Post, Paducah:

COLONEL: Captain Hudson, of General Grant's staff, accompanies ordnance stores designed for a cavalry command which I design throwing across the Tennessee River. Please let the boats ordered to be held subject to my orders report to him. There should be at least two large covered barges for ferrying purposes, if it is possible to procure them.

A gun-boat will have to convoy the steam-boat and perhaps, if practicable, it will be well to place the ammunition on board the gun-boat. Success to you. You will always have my best wishes.

W. SOOY SMITH,

Brigadier-General, Chief of Cavalry.
