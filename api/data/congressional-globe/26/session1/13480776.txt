cape without an abandonment of the leading motive of its crea-
tion Having stripped the States ol this poner, it is the bounden
duty of this Government to use it. I repudiate with scorn the
doctrine contained in the President's message, and repealed in
this debate, of a separ te interest between this Government and
the people, that the ptramou it duiy of this Government "is
to take care of itsell, and let the people take care of them-
selves "5 I hull with indignant con'enipt upon us authors the
sentiment lhat (his Government, at the immense cost of twenty
millions annual'y, was intende I to secure to the people the pri-
vilege, the glorious privilege, of taking «aie of themselves I
demand, in the name ol my constituents, (many of whom now,
alter a life of toil, industry, and frugality, are forced to surren-
der their firesides, then homes, by the ruthless policy of the past
and present AdmimstiationSj) an exercise of t e plain and be-
neficent powers of tti. Constitution, a fulfilment of its high and
impeiative duties; and in their name, I hold none more sacied,
none more obligatory, than that ol furnishing to this entire na-
tion a sound and umlorm currency, suited to its genius, its ha
bus, its pursuits, its trade, its diversified interests Cm it be
that Washington and all ihe sages of Uie Revolution wholly
misunderstood the powers and duties ol ihts Government?—men
who lived belore the Constuuuon, and lived under it—men who
were eye witnesses ol the necessities that caused its adoption—
men whose only aim "was their countr 's, God's, and truih's "
Can it be that a convention of sages, s ilemuly called together,
and alter el bol aie and u-ying investigation, consultation, aud
deliberation, framed a thar.er of powers, a Constitution, and
yet w re incapab'e of understanding or correctly construing the
woik of their own hands?—that Piovidence, m his inscrutable
ways, has reserved to our Cmef Magistrate the enviable privi-
lege of revealing the only tiue construction of this most myste
nous instrument! And that revela'ion, when reduced to plain
Eng'ish, is this, lhat this is a Government omnipotent for evil,
but impotent for good—a Government of individu il absolut-
ism, "of one man power"—a Government that can do nothing,
without corruption, but impose penables and restiaints, the same
act that confers discretion and defines duties, creates a prison
and defi nes the term of penitentiary service What a comn>*n-
tary upon the fonstiucuon of our rulers' what a disgraceful re-
flection upon this scheme, in the eyes of any candid, sober mind-
ed man. In the eloquent language of an enlightened states-
man,** "that whatever is positively beneficent, whatever is ac-
tively gtod, whatever spreads abroad blessirgs and benefits
which all can see and all can feel, must all this be reprobated as
dangerous aRd obnoxious polity, hurrying us to ihe double ruin
of a Government turned into despoti-m by the mere increase of
acts of beneficence, and a people corrupted beyond all hope of
rescue by the improvement of their condition "
Sir, gentlemen call upon us, an im| oient minority, powerless
in the Executive, powerless in the othei branch powerless in this
House,except in tempoi ary resistance—merely sufficientstrengih
to stay fora limited time the hand ol the execu loner—io givea
remedy. They tauntingly deman I ol us our plan, after having
re|ecud, by a negative vote in both branches of Congress, with
the repeated declaranon of the President, in his Slate papers,
hat he would veto the only measure we consider competent to
ie! eve the c iun'ry. Gentlemen still persist in demanding our
scheme of redress lor gnevanees, our measure ol relief Sir, I
have no concealment ol my opinions upon this momentous
question; I have already, I trust, made mjself perfectly intelli-
gible upon ihis point My cons'ituents want no more financial

Mr Chairman H gentlemen sincerely desire to know by what
means the public finances can be restored, a bankrupt Treasury
replenished, public and private credit mvignrat. d, prosperity,
public and private placed upon a permanent foundation, I will
tell them I propose to lead them in no untried paths; I point
to an old beaien trai k, a toad travelled successfully lor forty
years, a highway lhat history, cxpener.ee, analogy, that all re
semblance between our present and our past condition suegests;
a road marked out first by Wasliinüton in 1791, a road remarked
by Madison in 1816, alter double refined experience, afler every
experiment, every contrivance, evtry financial device, had been
res irted to and failed Sir, I now warn the Executive and the
country, that, after they have gone through the enure round of
financial shifts, experiments, and expedients, they will all ter
m nate as they always have terminated, in ufer discomfiture,
and destruction of public and private credit and prosperity, and
at last with an impoverished Treasury, a heavy national debt,
created in a time of profound peace, without calamity from
Heaven, wiih a people embarrassed in every pursuit of life,
(office holders and brokers excepted ) Before ihe finances are
tes'ortd, the business of ihe country placed in its wonted chan-
nels, ihe car of Sta'e will have again to be put on the "old beat
en track."
I cannot conclude, Mr. Chairman, without noticing briefly
sime of the examples of foreign Governments, offered
as models of imitation to the people of this couniry.
After authorities, this world is mostly governed by examples,
by precedents; falsely and deceptively used, they are the se-
cond mos potent weapon of error. Our Chief Magistrate, being
aware of this, has neglected no pains to ob nin garbled and im-
perlect information from other countries to deceive and mis-
lead The President in his last annual message represents that,
.n a pamphlet of correspondence to which he refer , it will be
ascertained that, out of twenty seven foreign Government ,
twenty six forbid the use of public money fey the agents of Go
vernroem, and that twemy one have adopted the Sub-Treasury
as their financial plan; a circumstance of high commendation in
¡lie estimation of the President in favor of this «cheme. It is a
little remarkable it did not strike bis mmd that there was ano-
f Mr. Au>rto , New Hamp biT .    * *Mr. Webrter.
ther feature in all these Governments in which there was per-
fect uniformity—that out of the enure twenty-seven, theie was
no republic, no democracy, no free government; that the ' one
man power" thai^seems to haunt his brain io madness, per-
vaded every Government of the tvvemy-seven examples referred
to, that il partial unanimity upon one point of administration
was a ground of imitation, undivided unanimity upen another
was surely a stronger argument in lavor of its adoption. Why
nut, if we embark in aping after monarchs,go the whole at
once? Why not, if it is intended under the delusive guise of
democracy to clothe the President with all the powers of a des-
pot, call him by his pi ope r name? Sir, I now propose to look
into a few ol these examples, so boa-tmgly paraded by the Pre-
sident and his hard money orators in this" and the other branch
ol Congress, dnd the first in the list of foieign nations is the Go-
vernment ol France Trance, it is sa d, is a hard money Go-
vernment, and praenses the Sub-Treasuiy in the management
of her finances. Now, sir, it is not true that the revenues or
commerce ol Franc are conducted exclusively in hard money.
Sir, fur the information of the committee, and for the better in-
formation of ihe country upon this point, I ask the attention of
tne House while I leada single paragraph from a very able
pamphlet, wiitten by the Vice Governor ol the Bank of Fi anee,"
upon currency and finance. Speakingof the Sub-Treasury, in
its practical opeiation, as connected with the banking system
of ihat country, this distinguished writer uses this language:
"The branches of the Bank of France are supplied with specie
by the surplus of the receiveis general, and by private depo-
sites of individuals, to be reimbursed at sight at Paris, and
when these resources fall, by remittances of com Irom the mo-
ther bank at Pans The receivers general, who are near the
branches, (mark ihis,) find it a convenience and a safety to
place their specie due the Tteasury with them, the amount be-
ing paid the Treaeuiy at Pans by the Bank. The banks thus
lessen the expenses of general business, and the amount of those
transportations of specie, which, crossing each other in every
direction, and often meeting each other on the way, occasion to
trade, to the collection of the public revenue, and to the coun-
try itself, very considerable cost of carriage and interest; trans-
portations which excite astonishment in men of business from
counines where a more advanced credit system provides more
economical methods of circulation " What a commentary up-
on the principles of this measure; what an explosion of the de-
claration that France used nothing but specie in Ihe transactions
of her finances, and that her depositaries were iron vaults and
safes, whar a-bitingciiticism upon the ridiculous folly ef the
practical operation of this scheme.
This same distinguished financier, speaking of the trade and
currency of Fiance, uses this language—"Paris has become-the
central point of general circulation; the chief instrument of cir-
culation is necessanly paper on Pans, which assumes every
p agible shape, bills of exchange, and all sorts of bills The
effluence of such paper, which may be called the general cur-
rency, contributes in a very large measure to nourish that large
discount business, which i« done in Pans by ihe private bank-
ers, the capitalists, and ultimately by ihe Bai k of France. H
would be impossible toascerlam, even Try approximation the
sum in circulation and paid annually; but an idea of its magni-
tude may be formed from one fací, tha- ihe Bank received in
1836 to the amount of fifteen hundred millions of francs,and in
1838 more than seventeen hundred millions " And yet Con
gress and the country art gravely referred, by ihe President
and the advocates of th's bill, tn France as a hard money Go-
vernment, practising the Sub Treasury system. I would re-
r 'irvneml our Chief Magistrate, before he communicates to
CongressanMber message, that he should consult higher autho-
rities than are to be found-in bis pamp let «f foreign corre-
spondence. If he can spare the time Irom bis indispensable
Executive dut es.such as revie - ing the standing army, prome
nailing the sal wins and splendid walks at the White Sulphur
in I «aratogi, and a (dressing theexclnsive demociacy at Castle
Garden npo- the coinfons and itlories of hard money, iron
sa'esand vaults; to read caiefully th s pamphlet, and other able
publications of like cliardcter, upon the«e o net absiruseof all
bne^'ions, currency and finance, the President would find
much useful infoi mation in some essays written, in this new
country of ours, upon the«e topics I know, sir, he h snot
been altogether remiss in this duty; any man who will critically
examine Ins various State pape-s will leadily perceive tt is.
He has studied most profoundly an American worrt on bank-
ing and currency; a rieh fountain for the Chief Magistrate o
sixteen millions of enlightened ireemen to draw lessons from
upon currency and finance II I did not fear I might be deemed
presumpiuous, I would advise the President to lay Gouge's
book as'de. and take up Gallatin's essay on currency, and works
ol simihr ability; works worihy the siudy uf ihe wisest and
ablet of statesmen, works from which he may draw deep and
rich draughts of financial learning; woiks worthy ihe study of
the chief i uler of a great anil enl ghtened people, I would par-
ticularly call his attention to this paragraph io Mr Gallatin's
pamphlet, 1830, touching the measure under discussion ' it
must at the same time be acknowledged that, inasmuch eg the
revenue may be collected,and the public moneys may be kept
inchests, and transferred to distant places without banks, it can-
not beasscrted that those instituí ions are absolutely necessary for
those purposes All this may be done, though with a greater
risk, and in a more inconvenient and expensive manner Pub-
lic ch sis might be established, and public receivers or sub-
tieasnrers might be appointed at the places where there ere
now offices of the Bank of the United Stales, and specie might
he transferred from place to place as the public service re-
quired, (I would especially call his at'ention to this sentence,)
with ihe exception of ihe power of receiving private depositee,
the object of which provision is not perceived This is pre-
cisely the species of National Bank which has been suggested
in ihe President's last message "Í This essay is pregnant with
information well worthy of a chief magistrate's calm and deli,
berate study But to return for a moment to the correspond-
ence with foreign nauons 5 Had the President been a candid,
impartial and patriotic inquirer after truth, he would have
found much Hselul knowledge in that pamphlet, bes'des the in-
formation communicated in his annual message; he would have
discovered information touching the interest and honor of this
nation, of this kind—"Another check, however, to ihe embezile-
ment of the public moneys by the receivers consists In the dif-
ficulty and danger of leaving the country clandestinely. Be-
