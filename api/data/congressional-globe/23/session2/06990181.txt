|     Mr SPEIGHT wished to .nqune of the gentle-
man fiom Georgia if it was his intention to press
the consideration of the reso'uuon at the present
session of Congress     If so, Mr  S would be glad
I  if it were postponed to a day certain     Mr   S
I  said he would take that occasion to remark, that
|   although the committee could come to no agree-
ment generally, they did agree, with one excep-
!   tion, to <hat part relative to the election of Presi-
dent and Vice Presid«nt of the United States
j      Mr GILMER said he should be gratified if the
House would consent to refer the sulject to a
Committee of the Whole, but ho could not, of
himself, have ventured to ask it     If the House
would suffei it to be read a first and second time,
he would ask that permission
Mr HUBBARD believed a majority of the
committee were decidedly opposed to both propo-
sitions Whether the gentleman intended the ac-
tion of Coneress upon them during the present
session, Mi H knew not, but he was opposed to
the course then adopted He had no objection
that they should be merely presented, and laid on
the table
