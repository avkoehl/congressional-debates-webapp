APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

40th Cong.... 2d Ssss.
Report of the Postmaster General.
Senate & Ho. of Reps.
The free delivery of letters by carriers lias
been in operation during the past year in forty-
seven of the principal cities. The number of
carriers employed was 943, at an aggregate
compensation of $099,034 34.
This mode of delivery continues to grow in^
public favor, as is shown by the increase of
postages on local matter, the reduction of the
number of post office boxes, and the large
decrease of advertised letters in several of the
cities where the system has been more efficiently
conducted. Experience, so far, justifies the
belief that it will supersede the present system
of box delivery, increase correspondence,
especially in large cities, and not only pay
its expenses, but yield a revenue to the Depart-
ment.
The postage on local matter in New York
amounted to £171,401, the total expenses
$131,320 92, showing an excess of $20,071 08
local postage over total expenses.
DEAD LETTERS.
The number of letters consigned to the dead-
letter office during the past fiscal year was
3,019,002 dead domestic letters, partly esti-
mated ; 443,780 unmailable letters, chiefly held
for non-payment of postage ; 179,406 dead let-
ters mailed in foreign countries, and 04,194
letters mailed in the United States, and returned
as " dead" from the foreign countries to which
they were originally addressed ; making a total
from all sources of 4,306,508—a decrease of
892,097 letters from the same total as estimated
for the previous year.
The whole numberof lead letters, of domestic
and foreign origin, and returned from the local
otlices of the United States, was 3,798,528, a
decrease of 789,514 as compared with the re-
turns of the previous year; the percentage
decrease of such as were of domestic origin
being about eighteen, while the decrease of
such as were of foreign origin was only four
and one half per cent.
The whole number of unmailable letters was
443,780, a decrease since last report of 94,337.
Of the number received, 7,901 letters were
directed to places having no mail service.
The letters received were disposed of accord-
ing to the regulations governing the classes to
which they belonged, as follows:
The number of money letters containing
sums of one dollar and upward was 21,305,
inclosing $138,305, of which 0G8, containing
$8,504 50, were registered. There were re-
stored to owners 18,577 letters, containing
$127,135 43. The remaining letters have been
filed, or are held for future disposition.
The number of money letters containing
sums less than one dollar was 13,770, inclos-
ing $3,809 24; of these 10,372, containing
$3,485 09, were restored to owners.
The amount of money taken from unclaimed
letters filed prior to July 1, 1807, was $19,-
914 07, which, together with $5.1-39 20 real-
ized from the sale of waste paper, amounting
to $25,073 87, was deposited in the Treasury.
The number of letters inclosing bills of
exchange, checks, deeds, and other papers,
classcd as "minor" letters, was 21.2G2, with
a nominal value of $5,109,554 48. Of this
class 19,991 letters were restored to owners.
The numberof letters enclosing photographs,
jewelry, and other articles, classed as "prop-
erty" letters, was 49,386, of which 34,S92
were restored to owners.
The public sale of property belonging to this
class realized a net amount of $835 05.
The number of Congressional and official
letters returned to the proper Departments was
17,304.
The number of letters containing stamps and
articles of small value was 97,059; returned to
owners, 88,679.
The number of foreign letters returned
unopened to the countries where they origin-
ated was 186.189, and the number received
from foreign countries was 64,194.
The number of ordinary letters remailed to
writers was 1,677,875; of these, 1,421,871, or
eighty-four per cent., were delivered—fully
sustaining the policy of the free return of dead
letters to their writers.
It thus appears that of the 4,306,508 letters
consigned to the dead-letter office during the
year there have been restored to owners
1.011,080; filed and held for future disposition
18,553; and returned to foreign countries
186,189, leaving a balance of 2,490,080 indica-
tive of the number that were property, or
unavoidably destroyed. Of these, about 1,500,-
000 were worthless, being mostly circulars and
gift or lottery advertisements; 250,004 were
sent out but not delivered, leaving about one
million without signatures, or so written as to
be unintelligible.
Further details of disposition, and compara-
tive statements of results for the fiscal years
I860 and 1807, are included in the appendix.
During the year, 5,409 written applications
for lost letters were received. The number
found and forwarded to applicants was 1,110,
or about twenty per cent. The registered let-
ters found reached the proportion of nearly
ninety per cent., while the proportion for
ordinary letters was but five per cent. These
results indicate the value of registration, on the
one part, and, on the other, that application
for letters having no inclosures are useless.
By a resolution of the United States Senate,
introduced by Hon. Jacob Collamer, of Ver-
mont, and adopted Alarch 9, 1859, the Post-
master General was requested to include in
his next annual report "the number of letters
consigned to the dead-letter office during the
next fiscal year, and what further legislation
is necessary to diminish the number of such
letters, or to provide for their return to the
writers thereof."' Attention was thus drawn
to a most interesting branch of the public ser-
vice, previously almost entirely neglected, while
a corresponding interest in the Post Office
Department developed in the dead-letter sys-
tem relations of benefit to all classes of the
people scarcely suspected, or at best but
poorly appreciated. The results have been
eminently satisfactory. The details of postal
service have been revised and carefully an-
alyzed in all their bearings upon the transmis-
sion and delivery of letters to their address,
and also upon the means employed for the
return of dead letters to the writters thereof.
The improvements which investigation and
experiment suggested are too numerous to be
included in this report.
Like improvements have been made in the
arrangements and labors of the dead-letter
office. Statistical records have been ampli-
fied, and now cover all important details.
The letters received, and their miscellaneous
inclosures, have been thoroughly classified.
The most approved safeguards of valuable
letters have been introduced, and all availa-
ble measures have been adopted to secure the
speedy return to proper owners of all mail
matter sent to the Department for final dispo-
sition.
Special and constant attention has been given
to the reduction of the numberof dead letters.
In large cities and thickly populated districts
improved modes of delivery have been attended
with beneficial results; but in general the
obstacles in the way of reduction, frequently
mentioned in the annual reports since 1859,
present difficulties which no official action can
remove. These are in substance the migratory
habits of our people, the great territorial area
over which our mail service extends, and the
pertinent fact that fully three fourths of the
letters returned as dead become so through
circumstances exclusively associated with the
parties immediately concerned. " Mistaken
direction," "illegible,1' "removed," "dead,"
are reasons found on three fourths of the let-
ters tested in this respect by repeated examin-
ations. It is evident that no efforts of the
Department can reach such difficulties; and
hence it follows that the dead letters from year
to year will retain a somewhat uniform pro-
portion to the whole number mailed.
Thus, in 18 j9 there were 381 dead letters
to every SI.000 of postage revenue; in 1861,
339; in 1802, 302; in 1863, 246; in 1864,
301; in 1865, 326 ; in 1866, 347; and in 1867,
278; showing as the result of eight years of
constant effort an improvement of 103 letters
to an amount of postage representative of
upward of 33,000 letters mailed.
It may be observed that the four years cov-
ered by the contests of the late rebellion pre-
sent smaller proportions of dead letters com-
pared with postage revenues than either the
previous or subsequent years of peace. This
is doubtless attributable, not to an actual de-
crease of dead letters, but to the large num-
ber of such addressed to soldiers which failed
to reach the dead-letter office. These aided
in the augmentation of the revenues, but could
not be included in the enumeration of dead
letters ; thus materially affecting proportions
based upon such data. But for these the pro-
portions above shown would have been still
more uniform.
It has been found impossible to ascertain
the statistical results of measures introduced
as improvements upon the postal service, be-
cause of the want of sufficient data to deter-
mine the aggregate of letter correspondence,
or the whole number of letters mailed for de-
livery in the United States from year to year.
Efforts arc now being made to satisfactorily
snpply this want. Such approximate estimates
as are available have developed agencies oper-
ating during the past year which are found to
be of prime importance in diminishing the
number of dead letters.
The estimated aggregates of letters con-
signed to the local offices for delivery are
438,840,007 for 1800, and 402,279,719 for 1807,
the proportions of dead letters to these aggre-
gates being about one per cent, for 1800, and
four filths of one per cent for 1807; a gain of
one fifth of one per cent., which is also one
fifth of the proportion for 1860. On the sup-
position that the ratio of 1806 was also that
of 1807, the letter correspondence of the latter
year would have produced 4,669,024 dead let-
ters, an excess of 870,490 over the actual re-
turns.
These results show the presence and effects
of agencies operating in 1807 which were not
operating in 1860. Unmistakably these agen-
cies are "request envelopes," introduced into
more general Hse during the past fiscal year,
and bearing directly upon dead letter returns.
It is estimated that fully fifty millions were
used during the year, the department supplying
about one third of that number, as before
stated.
A comparative view of the returns of dead
foreign and domestic letters for the same
periods sustains this conclusion:
In 1800 the proportion of dead foreign let-
ters to the whole number received for delivery
in the United States was three and six tenths
per cent. In 1807 the proportion was two and
seven tenths per cent., a gain of thirty-six
hundredths of one per cent., or one ninth of
the ratio of 1800. It thus appears while the
domestic element has gained one fifth part of
its ratio for the previous year, the foreign ele-
ment has gained only one ninth part of its
ratio for the same year, and hence it follows
that in the past fiscal year there were agencies
advantageously affecting the domestic reduc-
tions, and not affecting the foreign.
'The only agencies thus circumstanced are
"request envelopes," and in proportion as
these are introduced into general use there
may be confidently anticipated a like reduction
in the number of dead letters, fulfilling the
purpose of the laws on this subject, for which
! this Department and the public are indebted
i! to the foresight of Hon. Jacob Collamer, for-
tl mer Postmaster General.
