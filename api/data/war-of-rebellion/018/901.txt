(Via Bonsack's, May 25, 1862.)

General S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General:

I am in receipt of information from General Heth that he was compelled to fall back before the enemy at Lewisburg. Send the five regiments I have previously asked for; they are absolutely necessary to saved this railroad. I shall be at Bonsack's Depot to-night. Heth at last accounts was falling back in the direction of the Narrows.

Major-General, Commanding.

FINCASTLE, NEAR BANSACK'S,

May 25, 1862.

General S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General:

GENERAL: General Heth attacked the enemy at Lewisburg and was compelled to fall back. I wrote General Lee when I first arrived here that the force along the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad was entirely inadequate for its protection. It is now-necessary. The extent to guard from Buford Depot to Abingdon, including the salt-works, mines, manufactories, &amp;c., requires a strong re-enforcement. I said to him that I thought fiver regiments and a battery would be required at once. Unless this is done now, at the earliest possible moment, the railroad will be seriously threatened; its importance at this time is obvious. I have therefore written both yourself and General Lee.

General Heth at last accounts was falling back upon the Narrows. I have ordered an express to stop him if possible, so as to protect the road in this direction until he can be re-enforced.

I shall be at Bonsack's to-night and Dublin Depot to-morrow.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. W. LORING,

Major-General, Commanding.

MR. DAILEY'S,

Three and a half miles from Martinsburg, May 26, 1862.

[General EWELL:?]

GENERAL: We followed the enemy to within a half mile of Martinsburg. They made a stand and opened on us with artillery. As our horses, especially those of the Courtney Artillery, were broken down, i concluded to retire to this place, where I could get forage and rest till morning. I shall go there now. I hope you will send up the Baltimore Artillery and Maryland regiment. Our horses need rest greatly. There are various conflicting rumors about the Yankees. Some say they are making a stand half a mile beyond Martinsburg. I shall soon find out. After leaving Winchester several miles the country is much wooded, and there are no doubt many Yankees yet in the woods.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEO. H. STEUART,

Brigadier-General.
