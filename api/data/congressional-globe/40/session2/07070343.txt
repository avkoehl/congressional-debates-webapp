The PRESIDENT pro tempore laid before
the Senate a letter from the Secretary of the
Treasury, communicating the report of the
Special Commissioner of the Revenue.
Mr. SHERMAN. I move that the report
of the Special Commissioner of the Revenue
be referred to the Committee on Finance, and
that the usual number be printed, and as I
suppose it is a document that Senators desire
to distribute to some extent I will submit the
ordinary motion to print five thousand extra
copies, and let that go to the Committee on
Printing.
The PRESIDENTpro tempore. The motion
to print extra copies will go to the Committee
on Printing. The other order willl be entered
if there be no objection.

first presbyterian churcii.
Mr. TRUMBULL asked, and by unanimous
consent obtained, leave to introduce a bill (S.
No. 226) to incorporate the congregation of
the First Presbyterian Church of Washington;
which was read twice by its title.
Mr. TRUMBULL. I understand that this >
bill, which passed both Housesbeforetherecess, |
did not reach the President in time to be signed, i
and it will have, I suppose, to be passed again.
I moved its reference to the Committee on the
District of Columbia. I do not know that there
is any necessity for a reference, but I make the
motion.
Mr. SUMNER. I would inquire whether
in the opinion of the Senator tne number of
days required by the Constitution has passed.
Mr. TRUMBULL. The bill was passed
before the recess, but it did not reach the Presi-
dent until after we adjourned; and I understand
from one of the officers of the church who
called on me that the view which was taken by
the President was that he had no right to sign it,
it not having reached him until alter Congress
took the recess. There is no objection, I sup-
pose, to the bill. The Senator from New Hamp-
shire, [Mr. Patterson,] I think, had charge of
it when it pasted here before, but one of the
officers of the church called on me and asked
me to introduce it again. I had not thought
particularly on the course the President, had
adopted ; but if he takes that view of it I sup-
pose there will be no other way but to repass
it. It has been a question whether the Presi-
dent eould sign a bill that was handed, to him
after our adjournment. Mr. Lincoln, I think,
on one occasion did sign a bill after Congress
had adjourned. *.
Mr. SUMNER. But the Senator will bear
in mind that that raises the question of what
is the character of the recent recess taken by
Congress. Is it such an adjournment as the
Senator has in mind which causes the failure
of a bill, or is it merely a temporary recess as
when the Senate adjourns over from Thursday
to Monday during the course of the regular
session? My own impression is that it would
fall under the latter head, that it is not one of
those adjournments which would cause a bill
to lapse. I do not know there is any way in
which we can reach this question and decide
it satisfactorily. If the President chooses to
| act on his interpretation, perhaps it would be
i most convenient for us to take up these differ-
ent bills and pass them anew.
There is another important bill which is in
the same category, one which Congress has
already passed twiceâ€”the bill to secure equal
| rights in the District of Columbia. I have not
I introduced that as yet, because I was disposed
! to allow the lapse of the full constitutional
period in order to see whether the President
in that time would send it back to Congress.
I Mr. TRUMBULL. This involves a compli-
j cated question about which I confess I have
j not very definite opinions. It would seem to
\ be treated as a recess in one respect, for the
filling of offices, and in other respects it is re-
garded as a continued session. I would rather
not attempt to decide it upon this bill, which
is an unimportant one, and to which I suppose
there is no objection on the part of the Exec-
utive at.all, only his not having received it in
time. I will move that it be referred to the
Committee on the District of Columbia, and
let them inquire into it.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. It will be
so referred, no objection being made..
