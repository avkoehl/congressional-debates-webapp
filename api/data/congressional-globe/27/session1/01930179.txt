contest, not between capital and labor, not between numbers
and property, but whether the distribution oi taxes raised
should be left to the natural results of restive industry and en-
terprise, or whether it should be directed by the force of law
There always was and would be a division and a contrariety of
feeling between the tax paying anil the tas íeceivmg portions of
every community, becau&t, one portion paid more than they
received, while the other íeceived more than they paid Itwas
this division and mutual opposition which had brought down all
the ancient Republics, and had laid them beneatn the feet of ty
rants Mr H proceeded to trace this general result, as it ap
peared m Roman histoiy, to which he made some eloquent
allusions. He then proceeded to apply the geneial positions be
had laid down, by pretty intelligible allusions to matteis neaier
home
He supposed the caes, thattheie might exiet a tax consuming
paity in this country—not that he said any such party did now
exist—which had planned a conspiracy to plundei the tax pay
i ng many for the benefit of themselves what would be the fiist
measure to which they would natuially have recoui-.e'i   Their
design might, at first sight, appear hopeless    They were few
Those whom they sought to make a piey were many    They
must, therefore, resoit to art and management     Tht-y would,
as their first step, so to one portion of this multitude, andjom
themm some scheme to plunder the other portion    A fit mea
sure to effect such a puipose would be to propuse a piotecuve
tariff     Thus they would holl out at once a babe to those
protected,  and   woui I  associue   them   with   then seducers
and managers against the  non protected,  and in denouncing
them if they complained       Suppose,   I y tuib high tariff of
duties,   they   had   collected   a   laige revenue, which they
had at their disposal, but still they  did not   leel  their pio
lanx sufficiently strong to ventuie on  the   olds   opposed   to
them—what next would they doi   They would set on foot a
grand scheme for expending this tevenue 01 woikt, of internal
improvement—on the constiuctioii  of aitificial haibois—re
moving the obstructions m rivers, erecting piers and brcakwa
tersaudsea walls, and so contrive it, that the benefit from these
works should be distributed in as unequal a manner as possi
ble     This would do much    Bat they would   still   want  one
thing  They would desire to possess some instiument by which
they might raise the value of piopeuy to day, and depiess it
to moriow   take away then  occupations irom some Ua^es in
the community, and render the laboi of other clasps wholly un
profitable   relieve popuiai clamoi, by raising the pi ice of la
bor, and when it bettei suited their purpose, raise popular cía
mor by depressing prices     Wheie could such an a'mnable,
such an efficient instrument be founds   In a   ISational Bank
He cared not for the name he cared not whethei it was array
ed m the flaunting starlet of the Babylonian harlot   and   had
writfen on its forehea 1, "Rank of the Lmted Stares " or came
in the more modest aune of a sainted Magdalen, and called it
self a "Fiscal agent'
There was yet one other means that might be avaiHb'e in car
rymg forward the general design and that was a 'is ribuiion
bill a bill which went in its practical opetatton to distribute the
revenue laised in a manner must unequal, as between one mí*.
tion of the i,tum'iy and anothei and between one clarín the
community and another By this cítele, t^is «ybftm ot con
nected means, mutually dependent on each othei, this tax con-
suming paity might, by degiees, entiench itself fiiu Iv in the
possession ot powei He alluded t * the powei which queb
tionsof distribution had in agitating t ie p-t^ion.= of a ennmu
nity He adverted to the consequence  of these passions when
once deeply mused A multitude whi h believed themselves
defrauded, wronged, and haughtily oppKssed b} an uoju&t dis
tnbutionof the huits of labor, would 1 eed no ílaumbaí to take
them over the Alps, and to point out to them the outspread
riches below as the object oí then plunder
Mr   H   warned gentlemen to p c, aie for what might be
the  consequences of their action here      iso man would re
gret such results  more  than he   but if they cime  he meant
to preserve to himself at least this consolation, that he had
had no part or lot in bringing them upon the cotmtn.   Mi
H   now referred to the remain made  bj   Mi    Sergeant on
Friday, and invited him t&considu which course he would
take, should the attempt be male to tran^fei power fiom the
many to the few    Let him now come out and ¡showbiz co
lors, and not iepro«ch hi1* fuend ft ran South Carolina or him
self with a want of love Í01 the Constitution, when they ob
jected to measures which were directly against the letter of
the Constitution     As for himself,  he ¡oved what was in the
Constitution—not   like   the   gentleman   frorr  Pcnnsylv vma,
who seemed more to love that which wis out of th- Consti
tutton than what was in U    Mr   II   indignantly íepelled the
imputation or a want of affection foi hi-, \01thern biethren,
merely because he was the advocate of fiee trade and equal
rights    He was not to be moved by any argument addiess
ed to his fear*, the gentleman had held up a pictute of all
that was horrible as the consequence which was to ensue, it
the South refused to paiticipate in that system of measures
of which this bill   formed  a part     Such   arguments would
have no effect on him, bur to duve him to adhere the more
firmly to his punciples    He insisted that this was a measure
which raised a question between classes in the country, and
presented the issue,   whether   Government was to he in the
hands of the many, or in the hand*, of the few    Mr   ÍÍ be
lieved with his whole heart that m advocating the doctrine of

gentlemen who hadaidiess the committep, by °"omg into a  ie
trospect of the past He should take the estimates of the S«
cretaiy himself as he found them m the report, and make this
his starting point Fiom that report it appeared that the deficit
for 1841 amounied to $6,000,941 14, that oí 1842 u was 86,057,-
274 04, m all $12,088,215 18 He should take this fosgramed,
and should ba e his aigument on these premises. He efaould.
not stop to inquire as to the probability of Congress accethng to
the views oí the Secretary in relation to the two and a hal&aiil
lion wai appropuauon He would take the estimates as they
stood, (though he had no doubt the amount would be reduced,)
and the  proceed to inquire by what nuane this deficit was to
be supplied He would not go back to the details of the distn-
oution bill which pao3ed theHoa&e a few days eiuce, although
they were inseparably connected with the present bill, as this
was also with the revenue bill
If the proceeds of the public lands according to their pro
duct ¡or the last year, which was $3,292,285 58, were to come
into the Treasury, it was obvious that the actual deficit for
li>41 would be 1 educed to ©2,818,655 56 This would leave the
otal defi it loi the two years, 1841 and 1342, #8,795,929 60 ac
cot dina: to the Secretary's own reasoning The revenue bill
now befjie iht Committee of Ways and Means, and which had
boen lecommuided by the Secretary, would yield, according
to the estnt it eg of that officer, the gross amount of a25,140,000,
biK the net amount would be only ©20890,000, leaving a dif
terenceoí SM'OUÜüior lha cost ol collection an amount vast-
ly too grevt ai d which called loudly for reform He hoped it
would he lehtced betore the next session. Take this nett
amount of$20 90ÜOOO, and compave it with the actuaLrevenue
01 the lab >cat w uch was $13,499,502 17, and it would show
that the nett it venue would exceted ihe revenue of 1840 by
87,391,^02 17 and would exceed the revenue of 1841, taking it
at twelve millions, by $3,890,000. if we add to this the esti-
mated proceeds i! the public lands, which amounted to$2,600,-
000, theie will bean cxcbbs tor the next two years of $11,390,
000 Now di 1 not gentlemen see that even without the public
lands the whole existing debt ol the Government could be paid
offin one or two years'? Would any gentlemen insist that th«
debt must be continued foi eignt years, when in that period It
might be paid almost fourfold' Ihis calculation waa based on
the hypothesis that the expenditures were to be kept up at the
-ame standaidas heretofore, but Mr G sincerely hoped they
wo dd undeigo a large 1 eduction There was one unhappy

He would now pi01 eed with the ¡secretaty's estimates
If batd Mr  G the committee have Attended thus far to  the
