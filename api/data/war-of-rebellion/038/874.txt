HDQRS. DEPT. OF MISS. AND E. La., Bovina, May 13, 1863.

Major General W. W. LORING, Edwards Depot:

GENERAL: The lieutenant-general commanding directs that you make a reconnaissance of such a character as you may deem proper, to find out where the main force of the enemy is, and in what direction moving. If on Jackson, he thinks his move will be to fall on their rear and cut their communication, but he must have accurate information from you that he can rely on before making this move, which would leave Vicksburg, by way of Big Black Bridge and the ferries, in so critical a position. It is necessary that the lieutenant-general should be informed not only what force has moved on, but the strength of that which is left, and where.

Very respectfully, &amp;c., your obedient servant,J. C. TAYLOR,

Aide-de-Camp.

HDQRS. LORING'S DIV., near Edwards Depot, May 13, 1863.

Lieutenant-General PEMBERTON:

We are in line of battle, with the exception of Buford's brigade, which has not yet arrived. Depending upon the force of Stevenson to support our flank and center, of which Buford is to be our extreme right, on the road to Kidd's. Featherston is on the extreme left, extending half mile left of the road, and Bowen in the center, covering the road and the right of it for half a mile.

Respectfully,

W. W. LORING.

EDWARDS DEPOT, May 13, 1863-1. 30 p. m.

Lieutenant-General PEMBERTON:

Two heavy columns of the enemy moving down the valley on our left, in direction of Raymond road, near the position designed for two of Stevenson's brigades. I think Stevenson will get there in time. Have ordered Scott's Twelfth Louisiana and a battery there, to hold it till Stevenson arrives. This will complete our line, which I think a strong one. The THIRD brigade of Stevenson's will remain at Edwards Depot, equidistant from the different positions, and the fourth will remain near Smith's Station.

EDWARDS DEPOT, May 13, 1863-5 p. m.

Lieutenant-General PEMBERTON:

Latest information indicates the enemy have moved off from front, and have gone toward Raymond road. Have ordered reconnaissance some time since to ascertain the fact.
