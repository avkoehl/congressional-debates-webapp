WAR DEPARTMENT, Washington City, March 1, 1865.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

If you will make an order that no persons, male or female, not connected with the service will be admitted within your lines from and after this date, it will save you from an avalanche of visitors who will get down by hook or crook. I will, on such order being made, prohibit the giving of any passes. Send me a copy of your order.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

CITY POINT, VA., March 1, 1865-1.30 p. m.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War, Washington:

There are persons not connected with the army whom I have no objections to the visits of. Any general order on the subject would prohibit them. Would it not answer to publish an order that all permits to visit the armies must come from the commanders themselves?

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
