CORINTH, MISS.,

October 7, 1863.

Major General W. T. SHERMAN,

Memphis:

The Third Michigan Cavalry this morning reported a fight near Tupelo. Report having defeated the rear guard of the enemy, and all have gone in the direction of Okolona under Ferguson. It is reported from Booneville that Heath's cavalry were having a fight near Guntown. General J. E. Smith's division is at Glendale to-night. I have ordered him to occupy Burnsville with Matthies' brigade to-morrow morning and to push forward the repairs of the railroad as far as Bear Creek and protect the workmen. I have also given him instructions to ascertain about the fords at Eastport and beyond. Osterhaus' men have an excellent camp, and are in good condition. Forage is very short here, and we are losing many valuable horses for want of hay. When will my old division come up?

FRANK P. BLAIR, JR.,

Major-General.
