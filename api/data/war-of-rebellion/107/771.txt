Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War, Washington, D. C.:

SIR: I hae received your dispatch and have already taken measures to send you all the volunteer surgeons we can get. I congratulate you on the success of General Pope. He, however, committed an error which I cautioned him against, that is, of leaving his rear and supplies unprotected. I see you have precluded me from Washington without permission from the Adjutant-General.
