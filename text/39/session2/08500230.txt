Laivs of the United States.
any person residing within the jurisdiction of
the United States* owing debts provable under
this act exceeding the amount of three hundred
dollars, shall apply by petition addressed to
the judge of the judicial district in which such
debtor has resided or carried on business for
the six months next immediately preceding
the time of filing such petition, or for the
longest period, during such six months, setting
forth his place of residence, his inability to
pay all his debts in full, his willingness to sur-
render all his estate and effects for the benefit
of his creditors, and his desire to obtain the
benefit of this act, and shall annex to his peti-
tion a schedule, verified by oath before the
court or before a register in bankruptcy, or
before one of the commissioners of the circuit
court of the United States, containing a full
and true statement of all his debts, and, as far
as possible, to whom due, with the place of
residence of each creditor, if known to the
debtor, and if not known the fact to be so
stated, and the sum due to each creditor; also,
the nature of each debt or demand, whether
founded on written security, obligation, con-
tract, or otherwise, and also the true cause and
consideration of such indebtedness in each
case, and the place where such indebtedness
accrued, and a statement of any existing mort-
gage, pledge, lien, judgment, or collateral or
other security given for the payment of the
same ; and shall also annex to his petition an
accurate inventory, verified in like manner, of
all his estate, both real and personal, assign-
able under this act, describing the same and
stating where it is situated, and whether there
are any, and if so, what encumbrances thereon,
the filing of such petition shall be an act of
bankruptcy, and such petitioner shall be ad-
judged a bankrupt: Provided, That all citizens
of the United States petitioning to be declared
bankrupt shall on filing such petition, and be-
fore any proceedings thereon, take and sub-
scribe an oath of allegiance and fidelity to the
United States, which oath shall be filed and
recorded with the proceedings in bankruptcy.
And the judge of the district court, or, if
there be no opposing party, any register of
said court, to be designated by the judge, shall
forthwith, if he be satisfied that the debts due
from the petitioner exceed three hundred dol-
lars, issue a warrant, to be signed by such
judge or register, directed to the marshal of
said district, authorizing him forthwith, as
messenger, to publish notices in such newspa-
pers as the warrant specifies; to serve written
or printed notice, by mail or personally, on
all creditors upon the schedule filed with the
debtor's petition, or whose names may be
given to him in addition by the debtor, and to
give such personal or other notice to any per-
sons concerned as the warrant specifies, which
notice shall state:
First. That a warrant in bankruptcy has
been issued against the estate of the debtor.
Second. That the payment of any debts and
the delivery of any property belonging to such
debtor to him or for his use, and the transfer
of any property by him, are forbidden by law.
Third. That a meeting of the creditors of
the debtor, giving the names, residences, and
amounts, so far as known, to prove their debts
and choose one or more assignees of his estate,
will be held at a court of bankruptcy, to be
holden at a time and place designated in the
warrant, not less than ten nor more than ninety
days after the issuing of the same.
Of Assignments and Assignees.
Sec. 12. And be it further enacted, That at
the meeting held in pursuance of the notice
one of the registers of the court shall preside,
and the messenger shall make return of the
warrant and of his doings thereon; and if it
appears that the notice to the creditors has
not been given as required in the warrant the
meeting shall forthwith be adjourned, and a
new notice given as required. If the debtor
dies after the issuing of the warrant, the pro-
ceedings may be continued and concluded in
like manner as if he had lived.
Sec. 13. And be it further enacted, That the
creditors shall, at the first meeting held after
due notice from the messenger, in presence
of a register designated by the court, choose
one or more assignees of the estate of the
debtor; the choice to be made by the greater
part in value and in number of the creditors
who have proved their debts. If no choice is
made by the creditors at said meeting the
, judge, or if there be no opposing interest the
register, shall appoint one or more assignees.
If an assignee, so chosen or appointed, fails
within five days to express in writing his ac-
ceptance of the trust, the judge or register may
fill the vacancy. All elections or appointments
of assignees shall be subject to the approval
i of the judge; and when in his judgment it is
! for any cause needful or expedient he may
appoint additional assignees or order a new
'â–  election. The judge at any time may, and
! upon the request in writing of any creditor
who has proved his claim shall, require the
S assignee to give good and sufficient bond to
j the United States, with a condition for the
1 faithful performance and discharge of his du-
ties ; the bond shall be approved by the judge
or register by his indorsement thereon, shall
be filed with the record of the case, and inure
to the benefit of all creditors proving their
claims, and may be prosecuted in the name
and for the benefit of any injured party. If
the assignee fails to give the bond within such
time as the judge orders, not exceeding ten
days after notice to him of such order, the
judge shall remove him and appoint another
in his place.
Sec. 14. And be it further enacted, That as
soon as said assignee is appointed and quali-
fied the judge, or, where there is no opposing
interest, the register, shall, by an instrument
under his hand, assign and convey to the as-
signee all the estate, real and personal, of the
bankrupt, with all his deeds, books, and papers
relating thereto, and such assignment shall
relate back to the commencement of said pro-
ceedings in bankruptcy, and thereupon, by
| operation of law, the title to all such property
and estate", both real and personal, shall vest
in said assignee, although the same is then
attached on mesne process as the property of
the debtor, and shall dissolve any such attach-
ment made within four months next preceding
the commencement of said proceedings: Pro-
vided, however, That there shall be excepted
from the operation of the provisions of this
section the necessary household and kitchen
furniture, and such other articles and neces-
saries of such bankrupt as the said assignee
shall designate and set apart, having reference
in the amount to the family, condition, and
circumstances of the bankrupt, but altogether
not to exceed in value, in any case, the sum
of five hundred dollars; and also the wearing
apparel of such bankrupt, and that of his wife
and children, and the uniform, arms, and
equipments of any person who is or has been
a soldier in the militia, or in the service of the
United States; and such other property as now
is, or hereafter shall be, exempted from attach-
ment or seizure, or levy on execution by the
laws of the United States, and such other prop-
erty not included in the foregoing exceptions
as is exempted from levy and sale upon execu-
tion or other process or order of any court by
the laws of the State in which the bankrupt
has his domicile at the time of the commence-
ment of the proceedings in bankruptcy, to an
amount not exceeding that allowed by such
State exemption laws in force in the year
eighteen hundred and sixty-four: Provided,
That the foregoing exception shall operate as
a limitation upon the conveyance of the prop-
erty of the bankrupt to his assignees; and m
no case shall the property hereby excepted
pass to the assignees, or the title of the bank-
rupt thereto be impaired or affected by any of
the provisions of this act; and the determina-
tion of the assignee in the matter shall, on
exception taken, be subject to the final de-
cision of the said court: And provided further,
That no mortgage of any vessel or of any other
goods or chattels, made as security for any
debt or debts, in good faith and for present
considerations and otherwise valid, and duly
recorded, pursuant to any statute of the United
States or of any State, shall be invalidated or
affected hereby; and all the property conveyed
by the bankrupt in fraud of his creditors; all
rights in equity, choses in action, patents and
patent rights and copyrights; all debts due
him, or any person for his use, and all liens
and securities therefor; and all his rights of
action for property or estate, real or personal,
and for any cause of action which the bank-
rupt had against any person arising from con-
tract or from the unlawful taking or detention,
or of injury to the property of the bankrupt,
and all his rights of redeeming such property
or estate, with the like right, title, power, and
authority to sell, manage, dispose of, sue for,
and recover or defend the same, as the bank-
rupt might or could have had if no assignment
had been made, shall, in virtue of the adjudi-
cation of bankruptcy and the appointment of
his assignee, be at once vested in such assignee;
and he may sue for and recover the said estate
debts and effects, and may prosecute and de-
fend all suits at law or in equity, pending at
the time of the adjudication of bankruptcy, in
which such bankrupt is a party in his own
name, in the same manner and with the like
effect as they might have been presented or
defended by such bankrupt; and a copy, duly
certified by the clerk of the court, under the
seal thereof, of the assignment made by the
judge or register, as the case may be, to him
as assignee, shall be conclusive evidence of
his title as such assignee to take, hold, sue
for, and recover the property of the bankrupt,
as hereinbefore mentioned; but no property
held by the bankrupt in trust shall pass by
such assignment. No person shall be entitled
to maintain an action against an assignee in
bankruptcy for anything done by him as such
assignee, without previously giving him twenty
days' notice of such action, specifying the
cause thereof, to the end, that such assignee
may have an opportunity of tendering amends,
should he see fit to do so. No person shall be
entitled, as against the assignee, to withhold
from him possession of any books of account
of the bankrupt, or claim any lien thereon;
and no suit in which the assignee is a party
shall be abated by his death or removal from
office; but the same may be prosecuted and
defended bv his successor, or by the surviving
or remaining assignee, as the case may be.
The assignee shall have authority, under the
order and direction of the court, to redeem or
discharge any mortgage or conditional con-
tract, or pledge or deposit, or lien upon any
property, real or personal, whenever payable,
and to tender due performance of the condition
thereof, or to sell the same subject to such
mortgage, lien, or other encumbrances. The
debtor shall also, at the request of the assignee
and at the expense of the estate, make and
execute any instruments, deeds, and writings
which may be proper to enable the assignee to
possess himself fully of all the assets of the
bankrupt. The assignee shall immediately
give notice of his appointment, by publication
at least once a week for three successive weeks
in such newspapers as shall for that purpose
be designated by the court, due regard being
had to their general circulation in the district
or in that portion of the district in which the
bankrupt and his creditors shall reside, and
shall, within six months, cause the assignment
to him to be recorded in every registry of
deeds or other office within the United States
where a conveyance of any lands owned by the
bankrupt ought by law to be recorded; and
