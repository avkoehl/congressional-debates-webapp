Honorable C. A. DANA,

Assistant Adjutant-General of War, Washington, D. C.:

SIR: In accordance with your instructions I will leave here so as to connect with the first train from Baltimore to Wheeling. I should arrive at Wheeling about 5 o'clock to-morrow evening, and at Cincinnati via Colubmus early the next morning, and Louisville the next afternoon.

Would it not be well to advise General Allen of the contemplated movement, so that in case he learns General Thomas is in readiness to move, he could be gathering the necessary boats at Louisville, and also direct him to open any dispatches to me.

Very respectfully,

LEWIS B. PARSONS,

Colonel and Chief of Rail and River Transportation.

QUARTERMASTER-GENERAL'S OFFICE,

Colonel J. A. POTTER,

Assistant Quartermaster, Chicago, Ill.:

We may want 200 or 300 cars at Cairo within three or four days.

See the Illinois Central that they may have it in view, as we could not probably give more than twelve to twenty-four hours' notice. I go direct to Louisville; answer to Wheeling, care of Baltimore and Ohio Railroad.

By order of Quartermaster-General:

LEWIS B. PARSONS,

Colonel and Chief of Rail and River Transportation.

CHICAGO, January 12, 1865.

Colonel L. B. PARSONS,

Chief of Rail and River Transportation:

The Illinois Central says everything depends on the speedy unloading of the 150 cars already en route to Cairo, as they would have to be relied on to fill the requisitions.

J. A. POTTER,

Colonel and Quartermaster.

FAIRMONT, VA., January 12, 1865-3 p.m.

W. PRESCOTT SMITH,

Master Transpt. Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, Baltimore, Md.:

Cannot you consent that Mr. Coffran should come to Louisville to-morrow in case I telegraph back for him? He is willing to go if you think proper. I think it night be very useful to your road by giving you early and correct information.

Have you no reply from Gray or Lough?

LEWIS B. PARSONS,

Colonel and Chief of Rail and River Transportation.
