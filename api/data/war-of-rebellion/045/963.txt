inquires whether any further re-enforcements shall be sent. Unless the Secretary of Was has ordered more men to be sent to the Junction, General Elzey advises that no more be forwarded. What orders did the Secretary give on the subject?

Please answer by bearer.

Very respectfully,

T. O. CHESTNEY,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

P. S. - The ammunition was found to be all right-30 rounds per man.

[Indorsement.]

The Secretary of War orders that 500 men be sent to the Junction, in addition to the 700 already sent.

General D. H. HILL,

Commanding, &amp;c.:

GENERAL: I am pleased to hear your opinion that the enemy is not in force at the White House. It accords with the opinion I originally had of their movement.

I concur in your opinion of the advisability of stopping Colquitt, and have telegraphed accordingly.

As the train was sent down on the York River Railroad last evening, I had hoped you had sent re-enforcements to Colonel Hall; but not knowing certainly, I sent him this morning 500 more convalescent soldiers. They are not well organized, and may not avail much. If you can spare a regiment - there is not one here reliable - I think you had better send it up at once; and it would be well if General Cooke took command. Baffled in their leading object, the enemy may bend all their efforts to the secondary one. With prompt movements they might, I should hope, be at least intercepted and cut off.

Very truly, yours,

J. A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War.

Richmond, July 3, 1863.

Colonel C. T. ZACHRY, Weldon:

You need not come on. I have telegraphed General Colquitt, if he had not started, to remain, if he had to stop at Petersburg. He had better, in case he has started, stop at Weldon till further orders, as he will probably have to return.

J. A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War.
