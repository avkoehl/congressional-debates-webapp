Major WILLSON,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS LEFT WING,June 29, 1863.

MAJOR: I am greatly mortified and disappointed to report that about half of the Eighteenth Arkansas Regiment, 50 men, have refused to move to the right, as ordered, saying they have worked hard to fortify their present position, &c. The lieutenant-colonel commanding is willing to go with the willing ones. I have repeated the order, and directed him to leave those who are so lost to duty and State pride under command of a suitable officer, and proceed with the balance immediately, and report to Colonel Lyles. I have a hope that all may consent to go upon mature reflection. If you can say to them that they only go temporarily, and will be sent back as soon as the emergency is over, I think all will go. Replay soon.

I am, respectfully, &c.,

I. G. W. STEEDMAN,

Colonel, Commanding Left Wing.

Major WILLSON,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
