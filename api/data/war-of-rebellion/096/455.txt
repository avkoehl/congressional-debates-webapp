Since your dispatch of 9.40 the general commanding directs that your order General Gregg to take two of his brigades to Rowanty Post-Office, with their horses, &amp;c., and to prepare them there with supplies, to be ready to move either upon information received of the enemy's cavalry or upon requisition being made upon him for support from yourself or General Humphreys. A staff officer from General Gregg will remain at your telegraph station to carry to him the information or requisition.

ALEX. S. WEBB,

Brevet Major-General and Chief of Staff.

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,February 7, 1865-11.45 a. m. (Received 12.30 p. m.)

Major-General WARREN:

In view of the weather and of instructions from the lieutenant-general commanding, it is not advisable to make any attack to-day, unless you are satisfied that thereby great advantages will be gained. It is intended to withdraw you to-night or to-morrow this side of Hatcher's Run, and to permanently occupy the line to Armstrong's Mill.

Brevet Major-General and Chief of Staff.

The following are the casualties up to this hour: Ayres' division, 18 killed, 188 wounded, 123 missing; Wheaton's brigade, Sixth Army Corps, 17 wounded, 40 missing. Reports of the other divisions will be telegraphed as soon as received, and tabular statement of casualties and field report of strength present will be forwarded at the earliest moment practicable.

General WEBB:

General Crawford has again carried the enemy's rifle-pits near Armstrong's Mill and is pushing his skirmish line out toward Dabney's Mill. A prisoner reports the enemy's line of battle to be near Dabney's Mill, the place to which we drove them yesterday.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
