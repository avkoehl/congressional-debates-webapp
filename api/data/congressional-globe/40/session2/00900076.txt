SUPPLEMENT TO
Ansioer. I cannot recollect.
Question. Bat you do recollect that one day
being before the court-house you saw Thomas
standing on the pavement?
Ansioer. I was standing by the court-house.
Question. How near?
Answer. Within half the space of this room.
Question. How far was he from you ?
Answer. I think he was on the opposite side
of the street.
Question. On the other pavement?
A nswer. Yes; I think so. As regards the
time and whether I spolce to him or not I can-
not teil. I saw him there.
Question. That is what you recollect; seeing
him. there that day. Was he standing or walk-
ing?
Ansioer. I presume he was walking. I do
not recolleit.
Question. But you recollect seeing him
there ?
Answer. Yes.
Question. Can you not tell us whether he
was standing or walking?
Answer. Sometimes it is a little difficult for
a person's memory to run that well. That has
been several years ago, many years before the
war.
Question. When did you ever see him to
speak with him ?
Answer. I used to speak to him a great many
years ago when he would be at New Castle vis-
iting his people. He married his wife in New
Castlo.
Question. IIow many years and when ? That
is the question.
Answer, ft is very difficult for me to answer
how many years or when ; but I saw him there
and I saw him in the city of Washington.
Question. You now recollect that you saw
him in the city of Washington ; a little while
ago you could not recollect that?
Answer. I think now I do recollect seeing
him, but not to speak to him. He was an offi-
cer, I was a citizen.
Question. Whereabouts in Washington did
you see him before this time ?
Answer. I cannot tell that; but I have seen
him in Washington. I know him when I see
him.
Question. When, then, did you ever speak
to him before this time ? Name a time.
Answer. Every time I would come within
speaking distance of him I have spoken to
liim ; but to name a time I cannot.
Question. You cannot answer when it was
or where you ever spoke to him before?
Answer. No, sir; not particularly.
Question. On this occasion did you come
from Delaware to see General Thomas?
Answer. No, sir ; 1 had other business in
Washington.
Question. Did you expect to see him or
intend to see him ?
Answer. Well, I wished to see the President
of the United States, and I wished to see the
Cabinet. I saw them all except General Thomas
iti the reception room. I then walked into the
East Room and I saw hira there ; I went to him
in the East Iloora and spoke to liim.
Question. You wanted to see him as well as
the rest of the Cabinet?
Answer. Well, he was acting, the papers
stated, as a member of the Cabinet.
Question. Whereabouts in the East Room did
you encounter him ?
Answer. On the west side, I think, of the
East Jloom.
Question. Was it near the door of exit?
Answer. No, sir.
Quastion. Near the center of the room ?
Answer. I think it was. It was not the
center of the room exactly, but somewhere in
the center of the distance between that and the
place of going out.
Question. At that time was General Thomas
apparently going out?
Answer. No, sir. When I first saw him there
he was verv much engaged, speaking with a
gentleman very earnestly, and I waited until
he had leisure and then I approached him.
Question. Did you know the gentleman he
was speaking with ?
Answer. No, sir.
Question. But you had something to say to
him. What did you intend to say to him when
you found out that lie was there? You say you
went over to see him; what did you intend to
say to him ?
Answer. Well, his being a Delawarean and
I from the same State, I wanted to pass the
compliments with him. I was glad to see him.
I had no particular desire to see him on any
business; but I just said to him what I have
already stated.
Question. You did not go there especially to
say to liim that thing, then, but only to see him ?
Answer. I was drawn there for the purpose
of seeing Mr. Johnson, President of the United
States; I had never seen him.
Question. After you had seen Mr. Johnson,
and the other members of the Cabinet, I un-
derstand you to say you then wanted to see
General Thomas?
Answer. I asked a friend with me where
General Thomas was; said I, "I, do not see
him."
Question. Who was that friend that was with
you?
Answer. It was John B. Tanner.
Question. Where was he from?
Answer. Washington.
Question. Does he live here?
Answer. Yes, sir.
Question. Did you go with Tanner to that
levee?
Answer. Yes, sir.
Question. And after you had seen the Presi-
dent and Cabinet, you then asked him where
you would find Thomas?
Answer. No; that was not the manner.
Question. What was it?
Answer. Said I, "I see them all but Gen-
eral Thomas." 1 did not know the members
of the Cabinet personally, but they were pointed
out to me—Mr. Browning and ail the Cabinet
except Mr. Thomas. I think they were "all
present in the reception room.
Question. And all were pointed out to you ?
Answer. Yes, sir; they were pointed out
to me.
Question. Having seen the President and
having seen all the members of the Cabinet,
then you asked where you could find General
Thomas?
Answer. No, sir.
Question. What then?
Answer. I did not ask where I eould find
him. Said I, "I miss General Thomas here ;
he is not in this room." My friend said no,
ho was not in that room ; and when we left the
reception room and eame into the East Room
1 saw liim there.
Question. Did you go with your friend
Tanner from the reception room to the East
Room?
Answer. Yes, sir.
Question. Did he point out Thomas to you ?
Answer. No, sir; I pointed liim out myself.
Question. What was the first thing you said
to Thomas after he was through with his con-
versation with the gentleman he was speaking
to; how did you first address him ?
Answer. I have already stated that.
Question. State it again.
Answer. I addressed him as a Delawarean,
knowing him to be so. I told him I was from
Delaware. He said he was a Delaware boy
himself. I knew that very well, and knew his
family.
Question. Did you shake hands with him?
Answer. Yes, sir.
Question. What followed when you told him
that you were from Delaware ?
Answer. As I before stated, he asked me
how things were coming on in Delaware, how
we were all getting along or how we were
coming on ; that was about the amount he
asked me.
Question. What was your answer?
Answer. I do not recollect the answer I
gave.
Question. What was said next, if you do not
recollect that answer?
Answer. The next was, as I before stated,
that I told him the eyes of Delaware were on
him, and to stand firm: that was the language
I addressed to him.
Question. Was that all you said ?
Answer. Well, no; I repeated, perhaps, some
part of that or pretty much all. I repeated a
portion of it, at any rate.
Question. When you asked him to stand firm
what was his reply?
Answer. He said he was standing firm.
Question. What did you next say ?
Answer. I told him the people of Delaware
would expect it of him. He said they should
not be disappointed.
Question. What next ?
Answer. That he would stand firm ; and he
then remarked that he would kick that fellow
out in two or three days, or in a short time,
or in a few days ; I cannot remember what his
exact expression was.
Question. Now, I ask y.ou, Mr. Karsner, if
this idea of kicking out did not first come from
you ; whether you did not suggest it?
Answer. No, sir.
Question. You did not?
Answer. No, sir.
Question. You are sure of that?
Answer. I have taken an oath here.
Question. I ask you if you are sure of that ?
Answer. 1 am sure of that.
Question. When he said he would kick him
out did you reply ?
Answer. I do not know what I did reply
just to that, for it was a pretty severe expres-
sion.
Question. What did you reply, severe or
not; what did you say to him ?
Answer. I do not think I told him it would
be all right even ; I do not think I did.
Question. What did you tell him ?
Answer. I said " I think Delaware will ex-
pect something from you." [Great laughter.]
Question. Was that what you meant by the
severe remark you made to him?
The Witness. What do you mean?
Mr. STANBERY. Was that the severe
remark, " that Delaware expected he would do
something?"
The Witness. Delaware, T told him, would
expect him to stand firm, and his conduct
would be viewed by Delaware, or something to
that effect.
Question. Was that the severe remark which
you have said you made ?
Answer. I did not make any severe remark.
Mr. Manager BUTLER. I think you mis-
understood the witness, Mr. Stanbery. He
said simply that it was a severe remark that
General Thomas made.
The Witness. Yes, sir ; that is what I in-
tended to convey.
Mr. STANBERY, (to the witness.) Did the
conversation stop there ?
Ansioer. It was not a very long one. There
might have been some few words said after
that. Just before I left I renewed the desires
of Delaware. [Laughter.]
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Order! order!
By Mr. Stanbeby:
Question. How did you renew the desires
of Delaware? Did you feel yourself author-
ized to speak for Delaware?
Answer. Oh, well, you know, when wc get
away from home we think a good deal of home,
and are inclined to speak in behalf of our own
State.
Question. At that time were you in sympathy
with the wishes of Delaware that he should do
something in regard to the War Office?
Mr. Manager BUTLER. I object. ■
Mr. STANBERY. What is the ground of
the objection?
Mr. Manager BUTLER. I do not think this
is the proper mode of proving the sympathies
of Delaware on this occasion ; and, if it is, the
sympathies of Delaware are a matter wholly
immaterial to this issue.
Mr. STANBERY. We agree to that. The
