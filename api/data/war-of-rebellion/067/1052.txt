holding the enemy in check was relieved by Wilcox's division, and the enemy pressed a considerable distance, one of Pegram's batteries assisting in the operation. Line of battle being formed near the intersection of roads at this point, Pegram's and McIntosh's battalions were placed in position, but the enemy attempted no farther advance. On this day (June 13) Read's battalion, accompanying Hoke's division, marched from Cold Harbor directly toward Petersburg, then threatened by the enemy, and arriving there on the afternoon of the 15th, was immediately, in part, put in position not far from Hare's house to co-operate with other guns on the east of the city.

During the 14th and 15th the First and Third Corps remained observing the operations of the enemy toward Malvern Hill, and on the morning of the 16th, General Grant's movement to the south side of James River being sufficiently developed, our forces were also put in motion in that direction. Huger's, Haskell's, and Gibbes' battalions crossed James River on the pontoon bridge near Drewry's Bluff, accompanying Pickett's and Field's divisions, and marched toward Bermuda Hundred. Skirmishing with the enemy ensued near Port Walthall Junction. The enemy was driven back, and on the next day (17th) the line previously held by General Beauregard, and evacuated by him because of the demand for all his force in the immediate defense of Petersburg, was recovered and part of the artillery placed on it in position.*

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. N. PENDLETON,

Brigadier General and Chief of Arty., Army of Northern Virginia.
