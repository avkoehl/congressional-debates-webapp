[Indorsement.]
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION ON THE MISSISSIPPI,Atlanta, Ga., September 17, 1864.

I have examined the foregoing interesting report of General Barry, and confirm it an all respects. The large captured of artillery credited the Army of the Cumberland, if unexplained, might lead to misunderstanding. That army captured in fair battle 13 guns, viz, 4 by Hooker at Resaca, 8 by Davis at Jonesborough, and 1 by Kilpatrick. Of the remainder, 34 were found in Resaca, Rime, and Atlanta, and were the equal fruits of all the armies, but the Army of the Cumberland, having the center, first occupied these places, and got charge of the captures, whereas the other two armies on the flanks were always moved around, so as to operate on the flanks of the retreating enemy, but they are, of course, equally entitled to the credit of capturing the fortified places in which these guns were found.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
