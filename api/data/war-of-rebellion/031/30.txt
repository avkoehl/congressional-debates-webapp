only discredit to the service, but serious calamities. Of the 14 men, 8 have since reported [1 seriously wounded], all minus their horses and equipments.

I have the honor to remain, general, very respectfully,

[Indorsement.]
HEADQUARTERS LEFT WING, December 5, 1862.

Respectfully forwarded.

Although the style and matter of this report show that Colonel Karge himself is entirely unacquainted with his duty, so far as the duty of making reports of criminal neglect on the part of his subordinate officers is concerned, the report is, nevertheless, transmitted, with the recommendation that Lieutenant Hoffman be dishonorably discharged from the service of the United States, to date from the day of his capture.

W. B. FRANKLIN,Major-General, Commanding Left Wing.

No. 1. Reports of Major General Henry W. Slocum, U. S. Army, commanding Twelfth Army Corps.
HEADQUARTERS TWELFTH CORPS, Harper's Ferry, Va., December 4, 1862.

About 4,000 infantry and artillery, under General Geary, started on a reconnaissance Tuesday morning, with instructions to go to Winchester, if deemed prudent. I have not heard from General Geary since, but think he must have reached Winchester. I have no cavalry yet.

Four deserters from the enemy came in this morning at 12.40. They say the enemy left Winchester on Tuesday night; that the forces sent from here arrived at Winchester on Wednesday. I have heard nothing direct from General Geary, except this report.
