QUARTERMASTER-GENERAL:

SIR: I have just been informed that large frauds are being perpetrated at Louisville against the Government by the delivery of two-year-old mules instead of three-year-old, called for by the contract. You will take measures to investigate the matter promptly and to prevent the fraud, and bring the perpetrators to justice.

HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND, Trenton, Ga., September 9, 1863-12.30 a.m.

(Received 3.15 p.m.)

Major-General HALLECK,Commander-in-Chief, U. S. Army, Washington, D. C.:

Information to-night leads to the belief that the enemy have decided not to fight us at Chattanooga. Our reconnaissances to-day show he has withdrawn his pickets on Lookout Mountain opposite and below us. Our troops are moving into Stevens';Frick's, and Winston's Gaps. McCook and Stanley start to-morrow with advance to reconnoiter toward Broomtown Valley, and Crittenden to gain the summit of Lookout south of Chattanooga, with a reconnaissance in force, holding his corps ready to enter the place if practicable. Granger closed up to Stevenson and Bridgeport with four brigades.

CAMP NEAR TRENTON, GA., September 9, 1863-8.30 p.m.

(Received 6.40 p.m., 10th.)

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

Chattanooga is ours without a struggle, and East Tennessee is free. Our move on the enemy's flank and rear progresses, while the tail of his retreating column will not escape unmolested. Our troops from this side entered Chattanooga about noon. Those north of the river are crossing. Messengers go to Burnside to-night, urging him to push his cavalry down. No news from him or his cavalry.
