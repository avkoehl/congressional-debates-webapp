tain, if possible, the signification of the large fires mentioned in your dispatch. It is of the highest importance that the commanding general should have timely notice of every movement of the enemy on the flank of the army.

Lieutenant-Colonel and Chief of Staff.

Answer when received, and direct your dispatches to me, noting time they were sent.

HEADQUARTERS FIRST CAVALRY DIVISION,Culpeper, March 18, 1864.

HDQRS. CAVALRY CORPS, ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,March 18, 1864-5. 20 p. m.

Brigadier-General KILPATRICK,

Commanding Third Cavalry Division:

GENERAL: The major-general commanding direct that you hold your command in readiness to move at short notice, leaving sufficient force to hold your picket-line as now occupied, or rather leaving sufficient cavalry in front of the infantry to watch, and notify the latter of the approach of any force. Stuart is said to be collecting his cavalry at Fredericksburg and Charlottesville, with a view, it is presumed, of operating on both flanks. Direct Colonel Bryan to send a force toward Hartwood Church to watch any movement on our left flank.

If Colonel Bryan has not a sufficient force re-enforce him still more. Every effort must be made to learn as soon as possible in case any movement should be made, so that your command, if moved, may move in such direction as will be likely to check and defeat the enemy.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

C. ROSS SMITH,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Chief of Staff.

Your dispatch received. Direct Colonel Bryan to catch all the bushwhackers he can and hang them.
