lishments were effectually destroyed, as well as large quantities of salt, and some prisoners taken. Colonel Jourdan fully realized his expectations in this affair. His thanks are due to Colonel Ripley, of the Ninth Vermont Volunteers; Lieutenant-Colonel McNary, of the One hundred and fifty-eighth New York Volunteers, and their gallant commands, including the cannoneers of the Second Massachusetts Artillery, who suffered intensely from cold, in consequence of having been obliged to wade a long distance from the boats to the shore.

The general desires to add his acknowledgments to Colonel Jourdan's for the earnest and efficient naval co-operation of Commander Dove, and especially to Lieutenants MacDiarmid and Wells and the officers of the gunboats Howquah and Daylight.

By command of Major-General Peck:

E. T. PARKINSON,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

The enemy far outnumbered his force, but were diverted by demonstrations to Young's Mills and Cedar Point. The turpentine was carried off before he arrived the second time, but a large quantity of salt was destroyed.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOHN J. PECK,

Major-General.

DECEMBER 25-27, 1863 - SCOUT FROM VIENNA TO LEESBURG, VA., AND SKIRMISH.

Report of Colonel Charles r. Lowell, jr., Second Massachusetts Cavalry.

Vienna, Va., December 27, 1863.

COLONEL: I have the honor to report that a party of 10 mounted and 40 dismounted men of the Thirteenth New York Cavalry, under Major Coles, with Binns as guide, sent out night before last, scouted the country as far as Leesburg and carefully this side of Broad Run. They searched houses and brought in 8 prisoners, among whom was Pettingall (a notorious scout), Joe White, Bridges (one of Mosby's men), and Beavers, with other suspicious citizens pointed out by Binns.

They found no large force. Mosby had been at Guilford Station with 80 men the day before. A few shots were exchanged with a small mounted party, who scattered through the woods. Another party of 30 men sent out at the same time have not returned.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant.

C. R. LOWELL, JR.

Lieutenant Colonel J. H. Taylor,

Chief of Staff, and Assistant Adjutant-General.
