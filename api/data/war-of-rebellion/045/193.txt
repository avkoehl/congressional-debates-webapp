HEADQUARTERS CAVALRY CORPS, Aldie,June 18, 1863-1. 10 p. m.

Brig. General S. WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

GENERAL: I have sent out two reconnaissances, one toward Ashby's Gap, by way of Middleburg, and one toward Snicker's Gap, by way of Philomont. Each of these is sufficiently strong to take are of itself. A report has reached me that Colonel Duffie, who was sent on a reconnaissance through Thoroughfare Gap with the First Rhode Island Cavalry, permitted himself to be surrounded near Middleburg, and has met heavy loss-not more than 100 men escaping; this is report. I have not directly from Duffie, and shall await more definite information. I have a brigade of cavalry picketing Thoroughfare Gap. My reconnaissance to Middleburg will find out all about Duffie. All is quiet in that direction.

Very respectfully,

A. PLEASONTON,

Brigadier-General.

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, Fairfax Station,June 18, 1863- 3. 30 p. m.

Commanding Officer First Corps:

Nothing more new than Pleasonton' fight at Aldie last night. Slocum at Leesburg; cavalry at Aldie, and scouting through to Middleburg, Snicker's Gap, Winchester, down to Thoroughfare Gap, Warrenton, Rappahannock Station, Sulphur Springs, &amp;c. No infantry reported this side of the Blue Ridge. Couch's pickets, that he reported being driven in, seem to be composed, and they are quieting a little in Pennsylvania. Only 1, 500 heard of. White, Imboden &Co. in that county. White last night at Point of Rocks, marching careless of our cavalry. Two regiments of infantry and bridge train ought to have been at mouth of the Monocacy last night. We have not settled where Lee, with Longstreet and Ewell, are yet. I send Chronicle of to-day. Headquarters at Fairfax Court-House to-night.

Very respectfully, &c.,

DANL. BUTTERFIELD,

Major-General, Chief of Staff.
