B and F will be here to-morrow evening. I will start them off next day for Sullivan Station. Report of blanks, books, &amp;c., will be sent in to-day. The cause of this delay was that my adjutant was ordered to Saint Louis on a court-martial and I have been almost alone, and had more work than I could do. We were both on a scout when you first sent the order.

Colonel, Commanding.

PILOT KNOB, June 4, 1864.

Lieutenant H. HANNAHS,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General:

Yesterday I got a dispatch saying, "Send Company D of Third Missouri State Militia Cavalry to Patterson." It has gone to-day. I got one saying, "Send Companies B and F with D and E, under Major Bartlett, to Sullivan Station, Southwest Branch Pacific Railroad." Please tell me what is wrong that I may correct it.

J. F. TYLER,

Colonel, Commanding.

WARRENSBURG, MO., June 4, 1864.

Major O. D. GREENE,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

The evidence confirms the statement in my dispatch of last night, that there are about 600 guerrillas between this point and the Missouri River. The troops are hunting them, but they manage to avoid any engagement.

E. B. BROWN,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers.

WARRENSBURG, MO., June 4, 1864.

Major O. D. GREENE,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

I respectfully recommend that Major-General Curtis be advised that there are evidences of a concentration of several hundred guerrillas, evidently with the intention of making a raid upon some point in Missouri or Kansas.

E. B. BROWN,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers.
