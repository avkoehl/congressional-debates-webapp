Scouts sent out late this afternoon not yet returned. First Alabama ordered south at daylight in the morning, also 200 men from Germantown. Shall I hold the Second Iowa to move when the infantry starts?

Brigadier General B. H. GRIERSON,

Throw scouts of First Alabama down toward hernando, and from Germantown south to the Coldwater, and let them patrol along the line of the Colwater, covering that lien perfectly as far eastward as Olive Branch. We will throw scouts down to the Coldwater from this point, who will patrol westward as far as Olive Branch. Order these scouts to permit nobody to pass the line of the Coldwater going south unless they are in our employ as scouts and spies. Let every effort be made to capture the enemy's scouts now north of the Coldwater.
