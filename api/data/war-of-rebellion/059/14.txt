Brigadier General ROBERT ALLEN,

Chief Quartermaster, Louisville, Ky.:

KNOXVILLE, March 4, 1864.

Major General U. S. GRANT:

I have no additional information of a positive character about Longstreet's movements. His recent movements, if any, have been very slow, and do not indicate an intention to abandon East Tennessee. Possibly he may have sent away some of his infantry since the 28th; I am satisfied that he had not previous to that time. The possession of the crossing at Strawberry Plains removes to a great extent the difficulty of advancing at this season. If I had the necessary force I could advance as soon as the railroad bridge is completed, with a fair prospect of ending the campaign in East Tennessee in a short time.

Keep Thomas advised of the movements of the enemy during my absence.
