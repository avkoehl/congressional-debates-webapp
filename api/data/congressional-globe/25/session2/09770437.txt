The account was incurred by a corpa o. the Ala-
bama militia, who were called into the service of the
United Slates, and at the foot of the account, the
quartermaster ©f the corps certified that the above
account is true and correct, and that the artic'e 
were purchased agreeably to his order/or the service
of the United Stales, and then, at the foot of that,
the commanding general of tha division certifies
that "the above account is true and correct'
[Here a number of gentlemen asked, " Who is n
signed by' vv hrse name is to it1" and Mr B handed
it to them for examination ] It is not material to
the argumen' what particular person signed this
account, or for what corps the articles were pur-
chased, the account is open to the inspection of a.iy
gentleman who chooses to examine it The object
in exhibiting it is not to reflect upon the officers or
the corps who incurred it, but to show the laxity
that ptevails mong such kind of troops in the mat-
ter of economy, andas a sample of the kind of ex-
penditures incurred by them This account was
not paid, however, by the department
But, sir, should an/ gentleman entertain any
doubt on the subject «f die gtettly enhanced ex-
pense of mihtii or volunteer- over regular Hoops, 1
would refei him to ih<> document on thatsubjed,
(No 271) wnere the details are given, and the ex
penses of the efferent c rps minutely compared
In any light in \\h ch e cm view tins subjtct
the proposed ini rease c f the arinv, as recommend-
ed by the "Villi iry Committee of this House, and
which, with the additnnal íegimenl, wdl b'ing up
the army to about 12,500, is not only an mciease
which is ren lered necessary by every proper con-
sideration of expediency, policy, and economy, but,
in the present condition of the country, seems to
be unavoidar 1c, and is the lowest possible number
which can i e c msidered sufficient for the proper
protection of our frontiers, and the additionl regi-
ment ¡s parucjlirly necessary, at the present time,
in order to enar'° the Secretary of War to orgi-
n ze a force on the Northern frontier At present
the force on that frontier consists mainly of new
recruits, nut regularly attached to any regiment,
and the ske'eton companies to which they shoald
be attached arc mostly in the South or Southwest
I believe only one or two regular companies are
now on the northern lines, but, by authorizing a
new regiment to be raised, the Secretary can at
once cause it t > be organized on that frontier, and
fill it up, abnost immediately, with the men now
there, and without disturbing the present forces m
tie South and West, and this, among other rea-
sons, induce-  me to prefer the bill as amended by
the committee >f this House, to the one which
came from the Senate
Mr Chairman, 1 cannot imagine any reasonable
or plausible objections which can be urged against
this increase, unless it may be the old and oft-
repeated warning of the dangers of a standing
army—a warning, sir, to which I would give as
much heed as any o'her man, but that point is not
now involved in the question undci consideration,
and I do not propose to discuss it farther man to
say that the policy and propriety of keeping up
a small standing army has been long admitted and
settled, and the measure is one which has for a
long time icceiyed the sanction of the people, and
which is universally conceded to be necessary,and,
as to the dangers to be apprehended from such an
increase as the one now proposed, I have only to
remark, that I think gentlemen must be laboring
under a very unnecessary alarm, if they have the
slightest fears that the liberties of fifteen millions
of people—free, brave, and intelligent, as the peo-
ple of this Union are—can be endangered by a
standing army of less than 15,000 men, and that
army scattered along or around a frontier oi
upwards of 8,000 miles in extent
I had intended to ducu«s more at large he me-
rits of some of the details of the bill now before
us, but time pitsses, and I will only allude to t\u>
or three ef the most important and deseivmgoi
consideration.
This bill allows cavalry pay, which is the high-
est grade of pay. to all the staff officers of the army
who are not already entitled to it, and particularly
to all those who are to be appointed by this law;
and, if I correctly understand, every officer of the
staff depirtment will be entitled to cavalry pay if
this bill becomes a law, but no provision is made
for the officersof the line, their pay is to remain the
same Now, st, this is an invidious distinction
and one that ought never to be made, and, in my
opinion, extremely unjust towards the rfneer  ot
the lire. It any mere, se of pay takes place, it
should be to them first They, sir, are the work-
in  men, (if I may so term them,) at all events the
fighting men, of the army It is jour line officers
who are exposed to all the dangers of field seruce,
and to all the privations and hardships o^a military
hie, one year, perhaps, stationed on the Northern
boandarv of Maine, tne next, tr..nsfened to the
swamps and sickly climate of Tienda, then match-
ing the Indian on the W'-- ern frontier of Arl- an-
sas, and anon cooled off, perhaps, by a winters i"
sidence pt Green Bay Ai d it is your o fliers ot
the line, too, ■«ho, on manya ."ell-fe ught fie'd,have
borne th nr county 's flag to victor), and v ho have,
on all ocasión , exhioited a devotion and zeal for
the service of th"ir countiy, seldom equ ¡lied, and
never surpassed But they need no euloginm from
me They are known to be biave and merito-
rious, and it will be found, on examination, that
their ,1-esert pav (piiticuldriy f<r those who have
families) is hardly suffic ent for their oidmary sup-
po t It was fited as leg ago, I believe, as 1802
and, wit! some slight exception  rpnni is now as
(hen fixed, vhite in tne mean lime, the expenses
of In in" and the cost oí almost e>erj article
neces«aiy to their comfortable subsistence, have
nearly doubled It wou'd be mo t gross an t mani-
fest mjus'ice, then, to raise the pay of otner offi-
cers wnose duties are not so arduous or so danger-
ous, and omit the officers of the Une My colhap te
[Mr^íÍEMBiEJ has already laid upon the table an
amendment calculated to remedy this defect in the
bill, and It trust that it will receive the hearty con-
carrence of the House
The 15th section, Mr Chairman, provides tint
officers of the line shall not be detached from th ir
proper duties to serve in the Indian or pay depart-
ments, or on engineer duty In other words, that
they shall not be taken from the line for extra duty
This is, no doubt, an excellent provision, and w ill
tend to remedy o íe of the e\Js that has o' late
jear  very much weakened the effic ency ot the ar-
my, bull find a povisa tacked to the end of that
secnon, which, in myopin on,willdefeat the whole
object of the sec ion, and that proviso is, th?t
when officers of the line are now detached on tuch
extra duty, they may be continued in such emnloj-
ment until thev can conveniently be spared there
from, or until they can lea/e it without detriment
to the public sei vice Now, sir, } ou may depend
that the convenient time for these men to itturn to
their duties in the line will never arrive, under th s
proviso, and the íesult «ill be that, by one excuse
and another, they will remain as now employed,
and the real service of the army will continue to
suffer as it has done This pioviso should be
stricken out, or at least so modified as to state some
precise period beyond which th<>y should not be
continued on such extra duty.
There are also other details of this bal equal!}
inteiesting and important, which I had intended to
discuss, but I have already occupied much more of
the time of this committee than I had intended,
and the mass of other business yet befoie tie
House to be acted upon withm the very few days
that yet remain to us of the present session, ad-
monishes me that I ought not further to trespass
upon their patience at this time
REMARKS OF MR. feMlTH,
Of Con"i-ciicut,
In Senate, June —, 1838—On the bill to appropri-
ate al'ernate sections of land to the construction
ot  the New Albany and Mount Carmel Rail-
road, in the States oí Illinois and Indiana.
Mr SMITH of Connecticut said that largesums
oí the public money,  which belonged to all the
people of the Union   common, had been appró-
ptiated from time to time to construct and build
roads, and make improvemenis, in differeai States
in the Un on, which were of a local character, and
which belonged to the State in which the improve-
ment was made, though done at the sole expense
ot the General Government. Mr. S. said it was
difficult for him to see ''rom what source Congress
derived the power to make these appropriations.
He was confident the Constitution conferred no
such power, and if it did not, no such power existed.
So confident was he that no such authority was
vested in Congress, that he wai  very unwilling to
attempt to exercise it, and 1 id always refused to
support any such bill while he nad had the honor to
be a member of this body, and he felt cound, at nV
times, to vote against such ti'ls, though he w<is
quite friendly to the projects which were sought to
be sustained bv appropriations from the public
Treasury If tn-s bill was of that character, he
should feel himself bound to oppose it, but this he
ccrceived to be far different, m every aspect m
which it could be presented A compmv, by the
aid, and under the auspices, of the Sta'e in which
the work was to be done, proj oscd to build an ex-
pensive i a lro?d through thepnble l>no\ w'uch
have bren m maikei, and offered for ■-ale at tha
minimum pact, more fnan thirty years, ami no
purchasers have been found to take them up, or
settle upon them There must be some good rea-
son why these lands have not been sold, there -may
be different causes for it One may be, that the
lands are not of the first quality, but he was appre-
hensive that the principal reason was, that the
lands were too far fiom maikei to come m compe-
tition with those wl ch were much nearer market,
and at least equal in quality Be it either the
one or the other of the«e causes, or both, the
influence v Inch the proposed improvement wonH
have upon these lands would be very great
oeyond a doub' Tne facilit es that the railroad
would afford in transnortmg th*2 productions of
tne country would add greatiy to the value of
the land, and induce seülers to take them up,
and improve them, and withou* seme such im-
provement, which must be conducted by private
enterprise there would be, per.iaps, no more pios-
pect of a sale and settlement of the lands for thirty
>ears to come, than there had been for thirty j'ears
past If this is a just calculation, what (hen are
the lands, vuthout tne improvement, norh to the
Government* They are literally worth no'hii g
If individuals owned the land, and cou'd much
improve the value by giving a portion of them to
<=ome enterpMsng company to build the roctd,
wonld it nor be just to himself to do so1 No on-,
[Mi S. said] he apprehended, would doubt it
And is not t íe Government justifiable m taking the
same course to ruse thi- value of the land' If i-
was not, Mr S said he was not able to eti co\ -
the reason These lands belong to the people, and
whatever the Government doesm relation to thtm,
is in behalt o', and for 'ne benefit ef, the people, or
should be so Mr. S said he had no hesitation m
saying that i! the lanr-ad v ould raisp the lands to
the Government price, it would be an excellent
bargain to give one hall of the lands, for a mile m
width, as wa-i pr^p'-sfd by the bill, retaining the
other half The Government v, oul t then get the
rise on one half within that space, and on the whole
beyond that But is the Government werp to re-
ceive no other be: efit fiom the railroao. than the
rise of one halt or the land, the halt v onld be
vvcr'h infinitely more than the whole is in ms pie-
sent condition There is every reaso i to be'ieve
tnat the lands to be affected bv the improvement,
would rise m value to three times the amount of
the value of the land w hicn is prooosed to be given
to the railroad, or to the States, foi the improve-
ment The object of the bil is not to appropriate
money, or apply lands, in const!uctmg a road by
the Govarnment, but bv rece vmg a fair, full, and
adequate compensation for the lauds to be convey-
ed to the Stale, by the improvement and consequent
rise in the remaining land, which would be as well
for the Government as it wou'd be if the Govern-
ment «ere to convey te an individual or company
an equal moiety of land, in consideration that the
grantee would sell the other moiety for the same
pnce that the whole would produce on the sate of
