HEADQUARTERS FOURTEENTH ARMY CORPS,June 26, 1863.

Major-General ROSECRANS,

Commanding Department of the Cumberland:

GENERAL: I have sent a brigade of Negley's division to capture the regiment and battery seen by Colonel Ducat to the front and left. General Rousseau's advance was attacked 1 1\2 miles in advance of his headquarters. Strong picket in front of that. This position is a strong one. The country spreads out beyond him. As to position, he is much better posted than he would be farther advanced.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General U. S. Volunteers, Commanding.

Assistant Adjutant-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS FOURTEENTH ARMY CORPS,Hoover's Gap, June 26, 1863-2.05 p. m.

Major-General CRITTENDEN,

Commanding Twenty-first Army Corps:

I have received your dispatch of this morning. I have possession, with two divisions, of that portion of the road between Dug Hollow and McBrigade's Branch. Have not met with any serious resistance so far. General Reynolds is moving froward on the Manchester road, and I hope to get possession of Matt's Hollow, to-night, so as to secure the road from here to Manchester.

Very respectfully,

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General U. S. Volunteers, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS FOURTEENTH ARMY CORPS,Beech Grove, June 26, 1863-8 p. m.

Major-General ROSECRANS,

Commanding Department:

I have posted General Brannan in a very strong position, and have directed General Reynolds to picket the Noah's Fork road, and do not see how they can gain in information or time. Should the troops move forward to-night, with the enemy knowledge of the broken country, they will damage us very much.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General U. S. Volunteers, Commanding.
