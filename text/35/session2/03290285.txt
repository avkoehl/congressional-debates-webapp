These were justifiable reasons. They were not
requited to ur^e the claims of private citizens to
a point that would involve their own Government
in a perpetual war. Neither does our Government
become responsible, because it may not choose to
wage,pr having commenced, to continue, a war
with any foreign country.
I will not argue this question; but I have some
further authority, being-a statement of the facts
of the case made befoie the donate on a Former
occasion, by a Senator now deceased, Mr. Denton;
a decision of Judge Washington", and a decision
of Judsje C^ase. With the permission of the Sen-
ate, I will ask my friend from Alabama to read
these cxtiacts.

Again, Judge Washington says:

prize, i - fiirhnna wiih an un^mv.accurately and technicaliy

Let us read what Judge Chase says-.
" What, then, is the natuie of the contest subsisting be-
tween Amei iea and Fiance ? In my judgment, it is a hm-
I ited, partial war. Congress haft not deciaied war m gen-

Mr. DAVIS. These ore some of the authoiities ;l
which I present to the Senate as answering the ;j
! position taken bv the Senator from Kentucky. I |
11 do not doubt, tli.it, if I viewed the facts os he d'o^s, '
I1 I mi^ht reach his conclusion; or, if ho viewed the ;
! facts i.g \ do. In-1 niig'lit reach my conclusion. I
■ admit everything he says about the obligation of *i
!j the Government to protect its citizens; and I would !'
|i measure it neither by time nor by money. 1 said >
!j before 1 plead no statute of limitation, and I plead
! no incapacity to pay.
1 Neither, sir, can I agree with the Senator fi om
; Kentucky that it has been the poverty of our
j| 00111111-7 that has kept us from paying this debt,
[i as he terms it. There has been a time when our
■i Treasury was gorged to such an extent as to re-
quire depletion by an act of distribution. When
'| tiie last veto mossa^e was sent to Congress, the
I; Treasury was full; the country was prosperous;
there was no icason to dread the inability to bear
J this one payment; and if this were .the end of it,
| it mi<z;ht have been cheaply purchased by saving
j the time it has occupied. But this constitutes a
■i precedent; it establishes a pledge of the Govern-
]l inent, whenevei it attempts to advocate the claims
! of one of its citizens, and to vindicate their rights
;• against a foreign country, that it must succeed, or
simply to state, that during th% discussionto-day
upon the French spoliation bill, I was called from
my seat to the door upon a matter of business.
I had designed not only to*vote for that bill, but
to have spoken upon it; but when I returned to.
my seat I found that the vote had been taken. I
desire simply to say, that if I had been here I
should have voted in favor of the bill as well as
spoken for it. x
MILITARY ACADEMY BILL.
Mr. GWIN. I move to proceed to the con-
sideration of the unfinished business.
Mr, HUNTER. I would suggest that we had
better, perhaps, take up the West Point appro-
priation bill. There is but part of the day left.
Mr. GWIN. If the Senate will let the Pacific
raihoad bill come up so as to be the unfinished
j business for one o'clock to-morrow morning, it
| can be laid aside informally, to take up the Sen-
! ator's bill.
Mr HUNTER. It can be taken up after we
get through with the West Point bill.
Mr. GWIN. If the Senator from Massachu-
setts [Mr. Wilson] would prefer addressing the
Senate on the railroad bill to-morrow, instead of
to-day, I shall not object.
Mr. HUNTER. 1 move to take up the Mili-
tary Academy appropriation bill;
The motion was agreed to; and the Senate, as
in Committee of the Whole, proceeded to con-
sider the bill (II. R. 663) making appropriations
for the support of the Military Academy, for the
year ending June 30, 1860.
The bill was reported to the Senate without
amendment; ordered to a third reading; read the
third time, and passed.
ADMISSIONS ON THE FLOOR.
Mr. PEARCE. It seems to me that it would
be well for us to take up at this time the resolu-
tion reported from the Committee on the Library
to-day, in relation to privileged -seats. L make
that motion.
The VICE PRESIDENT. It is the duty of
the Chair to call up the special order, which is the
unfinished business. Docs the Senator move to
; postpone it ?
! Mr. PEARCE. I do.
! Mr. GWIN. I hope this will be taken up in-
formally, without postponing the special order.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Chair has been
in the habit ot postponing bills, informally, by
unanimous consent; but objection was made the
i other day by a Senator, and since that time the
i Chair has been in the habit of putting the ques-
tion in each case.
; Mr. STUART. I objected atthattime because
I I did not want this bill to stand nil the time in
: the way of other business; but at this time of the
1 day I have no objection to the other question
; coming up.
! The VICE PRUDENT. Then, if there be
; no objection, the special order will be informally
     *. ?>■—; K?stt«xss sasssr "*—
There being no objection, the Senate proceeded
to consider the following resolution:
Resoh'cH, That the following be substituted for the 48th
uile of the Senate :

while in session, except a-. tollow  :
The officois oi the Senate; membeis of the IJou'e of

of the case that i consider it of public importance, i:
It is this which has urged nie to make my opposi- >j
tion on tins occasion. h

Mr. HUNTER. I move to amend by inserting

ment bv adding, " and the heads ot bureaus."
ilr. HUNTER. I think there is a great deal
of difference between the heads of bureaus and
the mayoi s of the two District cities. it is v/eU
known that the people of this Dm net have no
delegate in Congn'Ss—in one to represent them,
except that sort of infui'inal represenmlion which
tliey'enjoy through these maynrs. They appear
here, particularly on days when we have up Dis-
