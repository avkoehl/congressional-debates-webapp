L. L. Lomax will command the Valley District and Brigadier General John Echols the District of Southwestern Virginia and East Tennessee, each making their reports directly to these headquarters.

By command of General R. E. Lee:

W. H. TAYLOR,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIRST ARMY CORPS,March 29, 1865.

General R. E. LEE:

Would it not be well to keep the vessels that we have to use as obstruction until it becomes apparent that the enemy's fleet is moving up the river? Otherwise another freshest may come and take them off. A battery of ten or twelve rifled field guns at Howlett's would be more effective against the enemy's gun-boats than other kind of guns. The parapet might be so constructed as to protect the guns against all fire except that of the gun-boats; these guns to be kept out of all fire until the gun-boats approach by taking the wheels off and letting them down on the ground. The iron-clads, I hink, cannot do us any great harm if they do pass, but the heavy guns will engage them and do them all the damage possible, and the field pieces ought to be able to sink or drive back all of the wooden boats.

J. LONGSTREET,

Lieutenant-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIRST ARMY CORPS,March 29, 1865.

General R. E. LEE,

Commanding, &amp;c.:

The usual force is in our front, so far as we can learn. Our scouts are in from enemy's line this morning, and report affairs as usual. If Field's division is taken away from this side all of the Locals must be put in his place as will be the Cadets. When you call for him please call at the same time upon the Secretary of War for the Locals, the governor for the Cadets, and General Ewell for his forces. Shall the other of General Pickett's brigades move at once?

General R. E. LEE,

Commanding, &c.:

Would it be same to send Hunton's brigade off by itself? It seems to me that it might be in danger of being captured by a large cavalry force. I should think that Pickett's division had better be together if it is to join our cavalry in pursuit of that of the enemy.

J. LONGSTREET,

Lieutenant-General.
