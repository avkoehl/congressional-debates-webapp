Colonel C. R. BRAYTON,

Third Rhode Island Artillery, Chief of Artillery:

COLONEL: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your communication of the 17th instant, giving a report of a tour of inspection through the Northern District, Department of the South, and to state that it was referred to Brigadier-General Schimmelfennig with your recommendation approved, and returned to these headquarters with the following indorsement:
HDQRS. NORTHERN DISTRICT, DEPARTMENT OF THE SOUTH,Morris Island, S. C., August 23, 1864.

Respectfully forwarded to department headquarters.

Orders had already been given by me (General Orders, Numbers 48, August 16) that no garrison of a fort or battery should be changed without special authority from these headquarters, unless the troops composing it were ordered away from the district. The garrison at Fort Greene was changed through a mistake. The outposts near the fort were ordered to be relieved, and the garrison of the fort was relieved instead. On discovering the mistake, Colonel Gurney promptly sent back the artillerists of the garrison. Some changes n the garrisons have recently taken place owing to troops being ordered away from the district.

A. SCHIMMELFENNIG,

Brigadier-General, Commanding District.

I have the honor to be, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

THOMAS J. ROBINSON,
