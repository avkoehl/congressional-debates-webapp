25th Cong......1st Sess.
Making public officers depositories—Mr. Wright.
Senate.
jnent should nev er he so directed as to promote these
excesses, while, so fai as that can be ^itelj a id con-
stitutionally done, it should be so directed as to
have an equal 'endency, in all parts of our extend-
ed confederacy, to check them
6 That the powers of Congiess, to pievent the
evil of excessive banking by the State institutions,
are, in no vense, direct and positive, but are, in
■whatever form thej may be exercised, incidental
md consequential, growing out of the expiessly
granted powers
So far he thought all could agree and walk to-
gether in thi*. trying crisis He was not aware that
any one would controvert either of these positions,
■while he was sure that most of those who had ad-
dressed the Senate, in the course of this debate, up-
on whatever side of the house, had substantially
assumed diem
The difference seemed to arise as ve passed the
last proposition, and came to inquire how this inci-
dental power of Congress should be exprcised The
late catastrophe to the banks and business of the
country, had satisfied all that something w as w rong
m the working of our monetary sv stem, but the
seat of the disease, and the appropnate lemedy,
■were questions uron which opinions dnltred
The President was bound, in recomm nding to
thecons'deiauon of Congtess such mensures is he
judged necessary and exped °nt, to no nt out his
view of the evil, so lar as he should considei it
connected with and t mediable by iederal legisla-
tion, and to present his plan of remedy He has
don so franUy and full), and as the nnjontv of
the Committee on Frnan-e have agreed with hm,
and have reported the bill un ler consideration to
cairvoutlus rec nnmendation upon this point, it
would be his duty, Mi W said, to examine tint
bill in its favorable end unfavoiable influences up
on the Treasury, upon the Goverrment, upon the
banks,and upon ine currency gene aii> Tie -ife
keeping of 'he public moneys became stpai ited
from the St"te banks, in May last, bj the volun-
tary suspensión of specie pavments by the banks,
and the opeiation of the existing laws upon that
act, and the bill proposes to continue the separa-
tion
Sefore he could proceed with his argument, he
must here notice a position taken by the Senator
from South Carolina, who addressed the Senate
yesterday, (Mi Preston,) and which position, he
must lay, he heard assumed with some surprise
It was, that tin? exis'ing law hi 1 not pioduced a
separa ion b f v <-en th  pul 1 c Treasury ind tie
State banls, that th^j were nol legally stpiuted,
and that th" on'j sepaiat on v inch d d exist was
one foicccl bv the Secretar/ o'the Trea^u v, with-
out the requirement of law and a *unst th° nublic
interests If he conectly understood the Senator,
this was a fair statement of \ s argument and he
would repeat, he hid heard it with surprise The
answer to it should be an extract from the law it-
self, and it would be found a triumphant answnr
Thatpait of the eight1- section of the deposite act of
the 23d of June, 1836, which prescribed toe rule
for the action of the Secretary upon this subject,
w as in the following words
"Sto 8 find be it fmlhet enacted, That no bank
which shall be selected or employ ed as the place
of íepos te of the public money, shall be discon-
tinued as such depository, or the public money
withdrawn therefrom, except for thctauscs herein-
after mentioned, that is to say, if at any tune any
one of said bml s shall fail or lef'ise to perform
any of said duties as prescinW bj this act, and
stipulated to be performed by its contract, or ij any
of said ban\t <,hall a* any time refute to pay its own notes
in specie if demanded, or shaH fail to keep in its
vaults such an amount of specie as shall be re
quired by the Secretary of the Treasury, ind shall
be, m his opinion, necessaiy to render the said
bank a safe depository of the public money s, hav
mg due regard to the nature of the b jsmess trans-
acted by the bank , m any and eveiy such case it
shall be the duty of the Seci eta y of the Ti easw y to
discontinue an y rich bank as a depository, anduithdrc i
from it the public moneys winch it may hold on depo
stle at the time of stick discontinuance "
This was the law What had the Secretary
done1    He had discontinued the defaulting banl s
as puohc depositories Had he obeyed the law in
donig this, o  had he forced the separan >n' ¡t
was true, as the gentleman had stated, th it there
were yet six specie paying banks, and consequently
six deposi'e banks upon the list, but where viere
they located' What were the collections of the
revenue at those points' What was the rmpoi-
tance of any one of them as a fiscal agent of the
Treasury' The gentleman had not seen fit to give
to the Senate these facts m connection w ith his
claim on behalf of this íemnant of the deposite
banks, and ceitamly he did not intend to detain the
Senate to do it It was enough for his purpose that
the connection was, for all practical and useful
purposes, eithei to the Government or the people,
wholly dissolved , and if it again existed, must
exist by a re union, not as a continuance of any
present existence
The conduct of the Secretary of the Tieasury
wa  complained of by the Senator Had the Secre-
tan attempted to force a separation between the
public deposites and the six remaining deposite
banks'? This was not alleged They were plioed
uoon the list of depositories m the report of the
Secretary, laid before Congress at the commence-
ment of the present ses«ior, and in the same state-
ment the location of each, and the amount of pub-
lic monpy on deposite in each, .i enable the Senate
and the countiy to judge of the importance of a
contmued conneetioa with these banks as fiscal
agents of the Treasury, w ere plainly giv en Prom
this statement the asset lion bad been made, and
w as now repeated, that, for all practical and useful
pi rposes *o the Tieasuiv or the people, thp connec-
tion between the deposite banks and the public
monevs was atan end Nor was the Secreiarv ol
the Tieasury in any sense chargeable for the disso-
lution of tms connection So far from it, his ovn
statements to Congress show that he has fallen shost
of thp execution of the law It commanded him,
upon the lailu e of an, bank to pay specie for its
notes, when (lema íóVd, not only to discontinue
such bank as a depository, but to " withdi aw from
U the public moneys which it mty hold on deposite at
the time of such discontinuance " Hashe done this'
No for he tells us> that the largei poition of the
means in the Treasury, at this moment, exist in
balances due from these banks as poitions of the
deposites they have recivcd foi safe keeping Pías
the Secretary brought suits to recover these balan-
ces, when the banl s have filled to make legal pay-
ment' He tens us not, except in a few cases where
it was considered n"cesc~rv, fo" the even'ual secu-
rity of the pul' c property He then is the 'a t
person in the wul l who sh< nld be charged with
pciseeutim against the banks, or with an attempt to
forcea separation between thf m and th" public
Treasure If ft? is culpabl  at all, it is m not
having obeyed the law, bv v ithdnwrng fiom them
the miners they held in deposite at the tune they
discontinued the payment of their notes in spec <,
when c'cunndul Tf he has violated ti e law ne
his violated it fiom lenity to thr banks, «nd a 1
know that tms lenity i s been wholly co npu'sot ,
growing out of the situation in which the banks
have placed themselves So much for the chai ge
that the Secretary of the Tieisury has foiced the
sepaiation between the banks and the Government
He would now proceed to inqune what influ-
ences favorable, or unfavorable, th  bill to make
this separation between all banks and the public
money permanent, would exert upon the public
Treasury It would give to the freasury d reel
possession, and i perfect know edge, of its means,
at a'l times, and under all circumstances Tl e 
wou'd consist no  of bank credits, but of mune ,
arl would, there'bip, i ot be subject toan} of t e
fluctuations to w hich b ink credits must be alw i s
liable Trie mea is of the Ti asuiy won d be t e
value íeeeived 'dint the meie repiesaitition or
that value m picount
It wou'd give to he Tteast \ the perfect com-
mand if its me ins It would no longer be troubled
w ith tinavailab e funds, a description of funds well
known to it for the last twenty vears, which have
always gnwn exclusively out of its connectun
with banks, which now constitute almost i*s oi lv
íes urce for the payn cnt of the public cr ditors,
I and the consequence of which charac ei  given to
the means of the Treasury, so far as he was infi rme 1,
had, mo.e than any otha single canse, compelí d
the con/ention ol Cong! ess at th s inconvenient,
and he thought he might safely say, dangeroui sea-
son of the >tar It might be well here to define
this teim " unavailable funds," as applied to the
means in the public Treasurv He understood
them to consist, now and upon all former occasions,
either of bank notes, wh ch ihe bilks issuing tbem
could not ledeem in spec•*, or any thing else
which would p3v the deb's of the Government, or
of moneys íeeeived bv the banks for safe keeping,
and which they cou'd i ot pay, upon demand, in
the legal curiency of the country, or in any cur-
rency, wn ch thecied tors of the Government would
consent to íeceive as money in entire separation
frora banks would, of couise, relieve the public
Tieasury from this embarrassment for 0,e future
It would, at all tures, enable the Treasury to pay
the demands upon it, when the money of the peo-
ple had been collected and plactd in its keeping
for that pu'pose, whereas, under the connection,
these money s were liable to become unavailable in
the h mds oi tne b ink's, and the people again to be <
called upon to ri sc, e ther fiom thpir pockets, or
upon their cruut, th" means to pay those very debis
for th°payment o' which they ! id once provided,
b} depc ltmg the money in bank.
\ connnumce of the sepaiation would fuilhei
releve the Treasury fr m the recessr'y of using
l's meaiii to sustain tne credi' of banks, wnen re-
vulsions in trade, and gent ral shocks 'o credit,
should bring th" ban1 s in jeopard\ These icul-
sions must V always more or less fiejue i, in eveiv
commcicial countrj «nd most frequtiit, and mo«t
severo, in those when mt st extensively adopta
sys em of prp-r or credit ei c ilatio-1 and cturency
If, then, tbe means i r !e National Tieasary are
confided to i'l safe keep ng of the banks w Inch
furn sfi lh it pip r or credit cuculitron and cur-
rency, f ej must be always suLjecl to thp fluctua-
tions, rev iihio"i, anl mciuei t , ts which trie credit
of the banks are subject Tney become meve
credits w ith the banks, and cannot be exempted
from the influences w hich affect its other credits
Can the fi cal officers of the Government, then,
neglect to put fo'th thnr exertions, and the means
at the r command, to s sum the credit o' those
banl s, when occasion sna't call, whose credits con-
stitute the means oi tl e public Treasury itself
He w is not ignorant of the fact, that loud and
stait'mg complaints had been made in tms hall,
against a late Secretar of th" Treasury, upon the
mere stspieion that he hi 1 '< ed tne means of the
Tr"snrj to susti n 'he cicd i of 'he denos te banks,
but would an.> gentleman d nj I t, t n<ter this

then, might o ten be unf<tvoi«.ble, tnd even mju-

as nuch as ai } o her, t' e col ection and prompt
palmen* of the public revenues, but which should
not on the d->j * fronl le, be sa'fe keepers of anv
