First Lieutenant, Second Cavalry, and Actg. Asst. Adjt. General
HEADQUARTERS POST OF PINE BLUFF, ARK.,February 13, 1864.

Major-General STEELE:

By Colonel Clayton's request, I send you a letter written by Colonel J. O. Shelby and taken from Lieutenant A. C. McCoy, of his command. I captured Lieutenant McCoy and 1 man February 10, about 40 miles down the river. Lieutenant McCoy had on a blue overcoat, and his men were all dressed in Federal uniform. They were on their way to Batesville to pick up deserters.

I am, very respectfully, your most obedient servant,

M. W. BENJAMIN,

Lieutenant and Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.

HEADQUARTERS SHELBY'S BRIGADE,Camp John Moore, February 6, 1864.

Mrs. BYERS, Batesville, Ark.:

DEAR MADAM: After considerable sailing on the waves and ties of a military life, I am at last settled temporarily on the Washita River, where we shall remain, perhaps, until the thunder of impatient drums and the rattle of musketry breaks the dull lethargy of a camp life. The feedings will naturally contrast our position now and last winter, and sigh for the pleasant associations and fond recollections of the past. I should like very much to visit your quiet home and talk over the pleasures of other days, but the gratification is denied me, and I can only think on the joys that are gone with the wealth of their first embrace.

I have seen your daughter frequently in the last week. She is quite well and boarding in Camden with her husband. There is no news of any character around our quiet headquarters, and we are as effectually cut off from the world as if an angel had drawn a wide and deep gulf round the State. All your acquaintances of my brigade desire to be particularly remember to you. I would write longer, but McCoy is just about starting and is impatient at delay.

Hoping that the dark waves of anarchy and desolation, now sweeping over Arkansas with too much rapidity, may spare your bright oasis, I remain, your true friend,

JO. O. SHELBY.
