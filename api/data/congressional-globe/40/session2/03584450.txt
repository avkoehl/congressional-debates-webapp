THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
July 25,
Mr. SHERMAN. Tiiere are others equally
pressing.
Mr. SUMNER. The little bill I have got
liere will take but a moment.
Mr. SHERMAN. Every Senator has a bill
that lie wants passed. I insist upon my motion
for an executive session.
The motion was agreed to.
LIGHTING OF WASHINGTON.
Mr. HENDRICKS. "While the doors are
being closed, 1 move to take up the bill i'orthe
relief of Mrs. Hackleman.
Mr. HARLAN. I understand that there is
a proposition here from the House in rela-
tion lo lighting the avenue. The House have
amended a Senate joint resolution on that sub-
ject, and I hope it will be acted on at once.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Will the
Senate take up the bill mentioned by the Sen-
ator from Indiana? Is there any objection ?
Mr. EESSENDKN. I object to taking up
any bill of any kind whatever.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection
being made, it cannot be considered.
Mr. FESSENDEN. I did not make the
objection with reference to the particular bill
of the Senator from Indiana, but to any busi-
ness except that which was executive business
according to the direction of the Senate.
Mr. IIAHDAN. I will state to the Senator
from Maine that Congress has refused to pay
for lighting the avenues this year, and the
House has amended an old Senate resolution
so as to authorize a tax to be levied on the
property to pay for the lighting. That ought
to be acted on at once.
Mr. EESSEMDEN. I cannot consent, be-
cause it would appear to be invidious toward
my friend from Indiana. My objection was
not to taking up his bill, but any bill.
Mr. HAHLA'N. I move, then, that the doors
be considered open for the purpose of consid-
ering the amendment of the House to Senate
joint resolution No. 57.
Mr. SHERMAN. I hope not.
ill-. HARLAN. I am sure Senators do not
want to leave this city in darkness.
Mr. I'ESSENDEN. The House chose to
leave it in darkness.
Mr. HARLAN. We may not choose to
agree with them.
Air. I'ESSENDEN. We have done so.
Mr. HARLAN. But they have sent us an
amendment to a Senate resolution on the sub-
ject.
Mr. EESSENDEN. They struck out of an
appropriation bill the appropriation for this
purpose. They have decided it.
Mr. HARLAN. It seems to me to be a
hardship if the United States will neither light
the streets in this city nor allow the people
to light them out of their own pockets.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The ques-
tion is on the motion of the Senator from Iowa.
The motion was agreed to; and the Senate
proceeded to consider the amendment of the
House of Representatives to the joint resolu-
tion (S. II. No. 57) relative to lighting the
streets of Washington, District of Columbia.
Mr. HARLAN. I move to amend the amend-
ment by striking out all of the second section
of the amendment after the enacting clause
and inserting:
That tbc mayor nnrl eity councils of the city of
Washington ho, and they uro hereby, authorized to
eontrset with the Y/ashmgtou Uafe-Lig-ht Company
lor the teiiii oi' one year, and ko from ycjir to year
until otherwise provided by law, at  uch rates as
may Ih' agreed upon not exceeding the maximum now
fixed by law, lor all the illuminating gab required
lor the avenue and street lamps and public offices of
the city and public grounds under the control of said
city.
The amendment was agreed to.
The amendment of the House, as amended,
was concurred in.
EXECUTIVE SESSION.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senate
will now proceed to the consideration of ex-
ecutive business.
The doors were closed, and after some time
spent iu executive session, the doors were re-
opened.
