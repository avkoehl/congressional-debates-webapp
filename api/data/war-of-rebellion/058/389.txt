CHATTANOOGA, February 14, 1864-3 p.m.

Major-General GRANT:

As I am desirous of using a portion of Logan's force in the movement on Dalton, I think it will be better for his whole train to come here. As yet no one knows of the direction of the movement. I therefore have great hopes of its success.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General.

KNOXVILLE, February 14, 1864-2 p.m.

Major-General THOMAS:

I have reliable information that Longstreet has advanced to Strawberry Plains and has brought a pontoon bridge to the river near that place. I apprehend he intends to make a demonstration upon my front and send his cavalry around my left to cut the railroad between this place and Loudon. Possibly he may make a real attack on this place. I think the re-enforcements from your army should come forward as rapidly as practicable.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.
