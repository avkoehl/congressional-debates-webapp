HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE SOUTH,Hilton Head, S. C., June 22, 1864.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Chief of Staff, Armies of the United States, Washington, D. C.:

GENERAL: I beg leave again to refer to the want of light-draught vessels for the operations that I contemplate in this department. With several light-draught steamers, such as we had at Fortress Monroe and in North Carolina, I could at any time make incursions through the creeks and inland waters of this department that would result in the destruction of much rebel property, bridges trestle-work, cotton, &amp;c. If I could have the four light-draught steamers Burnside, Reno, Parke, and Foster, with the two new ones now built in New York, the Savannah and Augusta, with the Thirteenth New Your Volunteers (heavy artillery), Colonel Howard, to man them, I could keep up a small force in constant motion harassing the enemy. For this advantage I would be willing to exchange to or three regiments of the best infantry.

I inclose you a drawing* of these boats. Each of them has six launches, and is armed with six boat howitzers.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. G. FOSTER,

Major-General, Commanding.
