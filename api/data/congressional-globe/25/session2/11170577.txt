Independent Treasury—Mu Thompson.
H. of Reps.
President— as pa ronage acquisition ol teuituiy; peace an 1
war, more largely even than m Uip-í ase of our relations with m
dependent foreign power , because the dependent reía ion of
the Indians, asiegaids he united folates, makes him in effect
their master Reflect on the gieat masses of termo yacquned '.
by, or opened to, the people of the United totales, by treaties '
with the Indians, as m the c«se of the Choc aw% the Chicka
saws, the Creeks, and the Cheiokecs
And see how it works with reference to the Indians them
selves Take the case of the Cherokee treaty of Ntw Echoi?
Some hundí ed petsons, out oí ainbe of near twenty thousand,
make a treaty m behalf of the tribe who, by their written re
monstrance, protes* against and deny the validity of the ti ansae
tion Still the Executive brings it here as a treaty, it is con
firmed as buch by the Senate, and. this House appropriates six
or sev en millions to cany it into effect and d«es it almost with
outdebate, no, not withoutdebate, lor I recall to mi id the zeal
with which you, Mi Chairman, jind the gentleman fiom Vir
(Einia before me [Mr Wise] plead fin the rights of the Chero
fcees
In proport on asthe pacific rela ions of the United States with
the Indians have extended themselves, and es lecially un lei the
system of removing them to the west of the Mississippi, adop ed
by the last Admmistiation in the same propoi uon has the rowei

Execuuve'' Ihe Con ti ution -.eenrs hai My to have conceived
oí the magmtndi of the powei which w s esjine 1 to grow up
in this unconsideied qu«uei
But it is when we cometo in-pect the relations of the Exccu
ttve to thepjapeity of the United ^tate the national treasure,
the public lands, the edifices and other pubic works of corr
merce and internal communication, that w e enter a field of usur
pation, by construction, of incalculable dimensions and ca
pacily
The abuses of which this, the rnone) powei of the Executive,
is susceptible, are iearfui y shown by that long series of agita
non, which com me r ced with thelhnkauestion, indh is brought
usto the present deplorable state of publicando It isi tojic
too extensive to be fully discussed by me on this occasion I
shall only touch on some of the eadmg pom & of Jt
Itembiaces the col e ti >n of the a\ r ms and all the tram of
public officers connected therewith the cu touy of the public
treasure and the question of the re 1 itiou o the Gov ei n nent to
banks, the disbursement of the publ ctrea^uie, and the abu es
admissible theiem, he public Inds anl the n flu^nce of the
Government in the receip and d at u semei tof the money they
yield, and a^ the gieatest Ian led iiopueto, i  well as thegrc«,t
est moneyed capitalist in the countrv the patronage an 1 i a
dental power of the Government in the const) uction and ma
nagement of light houses, harboi impiovements roads, cus om
houses, mints, aisenals, and numerous other public works all
which things must be considered if we desire to comprehend
the full extent of the powei of the Execuive as connected with
the moveable and fixed   ropcity ot thelYdeiai Goveinment
If there were no question as to the mode m wh ch the late
Administration has wielded this tiemendous ericire of powei
the mere fact of the augmentation oí the amount of pub ic pro
pertywould clearly exhib i the dan^eiois tociease ( f Execu

Lax constructionists, do you undertake to raí e this power by
implication? To imply a power far greater than mon of the
expie^sedonep, and qui'e equal to any of them1 Will you
buildup this: lolly superstructure of power upon the word
"Executive" in the Constitution? Itcannot be You might as
well think to reverse the position of the pyramids, and plant
them on the ipex instead of the base Grant that the " Execu
five power" is vested in the President, grant that he is tonomi
nate and commission, and may remove public officers, stnl,
the details of that Executive power, the acts to bp performed
in rirtue of it the officers by and through whom the power js
to be executed and the disti ibution and limitation of the furc
tions atnon0 them "respectively, are tobe prescribed by act of
the Congress in the fvims of law otherwise the Pi evident of
th<  United States is but another name for a despot, an autociat
acting by some limitless motuproprio and able, when he will,
to abo irb into his own pe son all the effective powers of the Fc
dent Government
I denounce these acts of'he Administration and the pretences
of powei by which they are sought to be defended, at. the
ciowi irg evi lence of the means of coiruption, and the scope
for usmtation which the functions of the Executive afford
This theielationo the Executive to the public property aiu
the pnvate propeity of thenation, is the greit question of the
day And it bungs me to the general conclusions which I de
duce fiom ill I have &aid,arid the piactica] result which I de
s i e to reach
fust I cunclude as the general inference that the poweisof
the Executive aie as corr pired with those of Con£xes=, or any
other depaum°nt of the Government, particularly susceptible
of abuse that ü ey have been abu ed and that they have a
persevering tendency continuously o mere ^e
This I m well await, w is not the opinion of the IYderi ibt
it itnne when the practical working of the Constitution was a
matte) of speculation meiely, nor wa« it, I may add of the
Federalists^ oi, at any rate, the ultraFedei ahsts, if we take
\lnxander Hamihon, one oí the grpate^t men of his time, a3
the exponent of their opnions He, we ->11 know, proposed, n
iheconvention which fiamed the Constitution, to confer on the
Executive powers much greatet than the convention was wi'
ling to sanction Liu the conclusions to winch, by careful ana
ljsis of the Const tutun, md stu ly of its actuil working Ihdve
ai uved—and I put this" to the consideiation of those gentlemen
who claim to be the Democracy of the country—was the sen
ti nei t al o, oí the original Democracy of the early years of the
Consti ution
In the second 11 ice, I conclude a& the othei general inference
that the   emecly f >r the abu&es to which I have íefened  i*- u
el mm   itliepuwui d influence of the Execntivp     Ihe si v^t

incisures and a lethcss of grievances, I am, nc\tuneless, wil
hwg to vote the necessary supplies to theGoversmerij Xm¡¿-~
however le allowed to ehoose the mode of raising the ia«ds
I cannot vote foi a measure like that proposed, which is, lemy
dehberatejudgment, a violation of the Constitution, aad oí evil
an 1 dangerous tendency Howsoever and by whomsoevei ad
n mistered, I cannot forget that it is still the Government of
my country, andentitledtoalljustaiifs from me of money and
oí eveiy thing else But I will notallowattyexig^ncyjhoweVf r
great, any pressure, however severe, to íhdiícem^ífí the^líghlest
particular, to>iolate the Constitution The section fro*  which
I come is the weaker interest m the Confederacy, the Consta uuon
is theteforeto us hteiaily the "ark of our covenant,,? and should
be as sacredly kept Every consideration of interest is super
adi'ed to the highest sanctions under which men can act, so to
watch over and protect it As a matter of conscience, a«d ot
swoindmy I cannot, as one of prudence and of policy I
would not, if I could, in the slightest particular, violate that
saciedinstiument
He looks but narrowly at this measure who regards it simply
as a question of raising money for a present emeigeney No,
sir, it is a patt, a most important part—the very foundation—
of a new fiscal, financial and commercial system, which it is
m ended to erect upon the rums ofali th"1 salutary usages to
which we have been accustomed* of the Constitution itself, and
of the property, prospenty and happiness of the people, a
purpose, now no longei doubtful, to suppress bank notes as a
currency and to substitute in their place this Government cur
rency We hav e been told from a high quarter, one entitled
to all consideration that a mortal conflict was now waging be
tween bank paper and me allic cui rency and that one or the
other must pensh," that the business of discount and issuing
currency are incompatible, and explicitly that banks ought tot
to issue their pappr as currency These annunciations, are dis-
tinct enough and I trust thatit will not again be denied that
the purpose (no doubt most honestly and patriotically enter
tamed) is gradually to suppress bank notes as a currency , yet
we are told at the same time thatit isrot contemplated to bring
the country toacu íency exclusively metallic Thecurrency,
then^is to be in no part bank pap ei, and not entirely metallic
What then? Nothing has been piopo^ed but this Government
currency I am ho indiscriminate advocate of the banking
system I know the faults and vices of that system and would
redice to «ee them reformed, yet I prefer it with all the*e faults
to the teirihlt agony and suffering of passing through the tran-
sition fiom that system to a meta'lic currency I also prefer
bank currency to this Goverement currency «Inch you now
propose to issue

tutioual
2   It is not so "ooda curiency as convertible bank paper
