eral Logan bore the burnt of the battle, and his command acquitted itself nobly. Generals Blair and Dodge weakened their lines to the lowest limits on order to extend his flank and re-enforce him at any point. Our casualties are small, owing to the fact that we had just covered ourselves with rough barricades. Some of Polk's command was engaged in the last assaults. I will make a more specific report as soon as I can get the requisite returns from the different commands.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

O. O. HOWARD,

Major-General.

THOMAS' HEADQUARTERS,

July 28, 1864.

Major-General SCHOFIELD:

General Howard is being hard pressed on our right and I desire that you press the enemy with vigor in your front, and, if practicable, break their lines, which must be light held. Howard has been attacked, first in flank, then on his whole front, but at last report had repulsed the enemy.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE OHIO,Before Atlanta, Ga., July 28, 1864.

Major-General SHERMAN:

Your dispatch is received. I have a brigade on the railroad pressed close to the enemy's works, which appear to be held in sufficient force to resist an assault. They have a heavy cross-fire of artillery. It seems to me impossible to carry any point of the enemy's line without going beyond the defenses of the town, which would take me far from the rest of the army. I will reconnoiter carefully and will endeavor to gain a point of the enemy's line, if I can see any chance of success.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE OHIO,Before Atlanta, Ga., July 28, 1864.

Colonel WARNER,

Acting Inspector-General, Thomas' Headquarters:

My demonstration in front of my left shows the enemy apparently in force in his works. No change appears along my front.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, near Atlanta, Ga., July 28, 1864.

General SCHOFIELD:

I am starting off to the right again. I want to watch the effect on that flank. Keep things lively in your front, and let that cavalry regiment feel out eastward and south, as far as they can venture.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
