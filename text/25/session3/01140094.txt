THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
January 5,
sented the petition of the reporters, whose accom-
modation was proposed to be provided for in the
report now under consideration     Having done
so, he felt bound to say that he viewed the prop-
osition made by the Committee on the Contingent
Fund to be proper and correct     If the reportéis
for distant papers could be placed in positions
from v. hteh they could take notes of what passed
in the Senate, without any great inconvenience to
other citizens, he  thought that this privilege
ought to be extended to them     It would enable
them to perform with gi eater facility and accu-
racy, their engagements to the newspaper piess
and the reading public     He should exceedingly
regret that because membeis of the Senate had
suffered under the calumnies of some of the Ietter-
wiiters, perhaps some of these veiy  reporters,
they should be excluded fiom the accommoda-
tion within the gallery which they had solicited
Their exclusion fiom the hall of the Senate ren-
dered it difficult, if not impossible, for them to
take notes of our proceedings and debates     Per-
haps much ofthe misreprest ntation of which com
plaint had been so fethngly madi , occuiied in
consequence of this vol vtxclusion     He was not
ofthe opinion that newspaper abuse lnfhotid my
gieat dogicc of injuiy upon any publit  man    lie
ltpeated whit he had fnt|uemly tlsewheie said,
that so far as ho had been the humble object of
attack, these newspipn   slmdtis hid done him

conupt public Sentimtnt      He did not say that
theyshouiu do anything to stop them, but he
would not do anything that could be construed
into sanctioning then vile piactiees    Mr N did
not wish to take up the time ot the Senate fur-
ther, and, therefore, concluded by asking for
the yeas and nays; which were accordingly or-
dered
Mr STRANGE said he would vote for the
indefinite postponement, but for a different reason
than the one indicated by the Senator from Con-
necticut   We are all aware of the extent to which
misrepresentation and abuse has attained as íe-
gards the public men of oui  country,  but he
thought it would be as impossible to stop it as to
arrest the current of the Potomac    He acknowl-
edged that the piespnt system of admitting re-
poiters was a monopoly, but it must be a monop-
oly from the nature of the case   If we extend the
privilege, where are we to stop'   Must every
editoi  who publishes a papei  in this country,
amounting to upwards of a thousand, have ad-
mittance here, to the exclusion of respectable citi-
zens, who aie equally entitled  to the pnvilege
with themsehes     And if you pass this resolu-
tion to admit eight oi ten additional íepoiteis,
why not eighty oi a hundied, as they all have the
same ught to demand admission heie   He thought
that a sufficient numbei weie alieatly admitted
| heie for all necessary puiposes, and though they
could not airtst misrtpresentation and calumny,
[ he was opposed to opening the dooi any wider

state that they are lenoitt is of the pioceedmgs of

I place assigned them in the gilltiy, or any other

It is not presumed that these peisons will give
long and dt tailed lepoits of the debatís of Sena-
tois, but they will give a synopsis of the trans
actions of tht St nato in a mannei as acceptable |
to the public an tne icpoits of whole sp eches,

of leading column aftei column of a newspaper
to find it They will, no doubt, icport facts as
tuilyas the presi nt icpoiteis Although they
ni íy gn e only a synopsis, yet it wi'l contain much
of the doino-t. of the Sen ite, and in a mode Sinn

Inti Ihgeucei We all see in a small coinei of
ti i naper, in a condensed foim, much of the in-
foimat on we should get by rt adng a yaid square
newspapei all tne piincipal events aie related
thatoeeui, and these lepoits will be similai ,and
will bi diffused sooner than the ordmaiy repoits
published heie If these reporters have places
assigned them, they will feel their icsponsibility,
and they will not be those vile slandeiers and
venal lettei wnters that gentlemen suppose, nor
weie they so considered by the committee
Mi    BUCHANAN obseived that he should I
vote foi the motion of the Senator from Connec- I
ticut; and he would, with the permission of the
Senate,briefly state the reasons which had brought
him to this conclusion For his own pait, he
could not say that he had any personal feelings
in relation to these letter writers He bore, with
as much philosophic patience as any other gen-
tleman, that portion of infliction with which they
had thought piopei to visit him, and he could
not say that they had abused him more than he
had reason to expect He never was mortified
but hy one letter, and that had been written, he
believed, to a Maine newspaper, in which he was
íepresented to be a venerable old gentleman, ap-
parently between sixty and seventy yeats of age.
This, he acknowledged, had touched him upon a
tender point
If it were proposed to furnish seats to as many
reporters for the different newspapers of the Uni-
ted States as could be accommodated in the whole
of the front seat of the front galleiy, he would
vote for the proposition with all his heait But,
he would ask, who was a reporter' A íeporter
was a person who gave a faithful h'stouoal ac
count of the piocet dings of the body, with full
lepoits or fair abstiacts ofthe speeches of its dif-
feient members, fiom which the public could be
made acquainted with the natuie of the business
tiansacted Were the lettei-writers leporteis in
this sense' Would any Senator contend that
they were ' No, they did not themselves pretend
to be so They gave partial and piquant accounts
of such pioceedmgs and debates as struck their
own fancy, and having the same paity feelings
with the membeis of the body, they repiesented
us in the light which would be most agreeable to
the toados of the journals for which they were
employed Whilst the letter writer of one paity
was in nptuies with the speech of a favonte Sen-
ator, and repiesented it as the very perfection of
eloquence and aigument, another lettei writer of
the opposite party denounced the veiy same
speech as a poor, flimsy, frothy affan, which had
bten scatteicd to the winds by the breath of some
Aja-c Telamón on the other side Now it was
notonous that these weie the gentlemen, under
the name of rcpoiteis, foi whom seats weie to be
piovided under the íesolution then before the
Senate He thought they wire not entitled to any
such privilege, nor weie then labors worthy of
such a sanction by the Senate He had nothing
to say against them Let them mingle with our
respectable folio w-citizeiis who daily frequent the
galleues, and let them write what they thought
piopei Peisonally, he did not regard their cen-
suie In the long run, the people always came
to a conect conclusion in regaid to the merits of
public men, no mattei how much they were mis-
lepitsented The case ofthe Senator fiom Con-
necticut [Mi Nills] vv is a sinking example of
the justice ofthisitmark The lettei wntcisliad
uone him no injuiy, ilthough he had been can-
catuied to a groiter degrte than any member of
the body Indeed, he believed that these canea-
tuies, instead of injuring, had elevated him in the
public esteem He thought he could appeal with
confidence to all sides of the House, whether
Whigs, Conservatives, oi Demociats, for the
truth ot the asseition that the Senator fiom Con-
necticut now stood higher, much higher, in the
body itself, than he lied done two yeais ago
Mr B had on several former occasions stated
tint, if the Senate expected to have full and faith-
ful íepoils of thoirpioceedmgsand debates, theie
was but one mode of accomplishing this puipose
They could not expect the editors of the Globe
and intelligeneu to employ a sulhcient number
of skillful and experienced leporteis to present to
the public eveí y thing of importance that was said
and dont in the body The pationage of these
journals would not justify the expense, and m
this icspect they diffued from the leading jour-
nals of London, in which you might lead the next
morning the whole debate ofthe pieeeding even-
ing in both Houses of Parlnment The few re
powers employed by the Globe and Intelligencer
had done then duty as well and even better than
could have been expected, but, if tho Senate
thought it desirable to communicate to the public
a full and accuiate account of then debates and
proceedings, they must employ and pay a suffi-
cient number of their own reporters and make
them lesponsible to the body itself
Under all the cneumstances, he was in favor
of leaving the mle as it now was, at least until
