HEADQUARTERS TWENTY-FIRST ARMY CORPS,Jasper, Tenn., September 3, 1863.

Brigadier-General GARFIELD,

Chief of Staff,&amp;c.:

GENERAL: I have the honor of making the following extracts from the reports of the divisions of this corps, showing the amount of supplies on hand at their respective dates:
HEADQUARTERS FIRST DIVISION, TWENTY-FIRST ARMY CORPS,Jasper, Tenn., September 2, 1863.

I will have rations on hand to the 23rd instant, inclusive, which could be made to do to the 30th; perhaps longer if we meet with no loss.

TH. J. WOOD,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND DIVISION, TWENTY-FIRST ARMY CORPS,Camp on Little Sequatchie River, September 2, 1863.

Respectfully,

JOHN M. PALMER,

Major-General, Commanding.

Respectfully submitted.

SHELLMOUND, September 3, 1863-3.20 p.m.

Captain P. P. OLDERSHAW,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

CAPTAIN: So far from General Reynolds' division being all over at 3 p.m. yesterday, the last of his train got over at 2 p.m. to-day. As I had informed you this morning, Colonel Buell seized an opportunity when General Reynolds was doing nothing last night and threw his brigade over. I trust to be able to get over all that I have
