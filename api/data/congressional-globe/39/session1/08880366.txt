resentatives of the United States of America in
Congress assembled, That the act to establish
a Bureau for the Relief of Freedmen and Refu-
gees, approved March third, eighteen hundred
and sixty-five, shall continue in force for the
term of two years from and after the passage
of this act.
Sec. 2. Andbe it farther enacted, That the
supervision and care of said bureau shall ex-
tend to all loyal refugees and freedmen, so
far as the same shall be necessary to enable
them as speedily as practicable to become
self-supporting citizens of the United States,
and to aid them in making the freedom con-
ferred by proclamation of the Commander-in-
Chief, by emancipation under the laws of States,
and by constitutional amendment, available to
them and beneficial to the Republic.
Seo. 3. And be it further enacted, That the
President shall, by and with the advice and
consent of the Senate, appoint two assistant
commissioners, in addition to those authorized
by the act to which this is an amendment, who
shall give like bonds and receive the same
annual salaries provided in said act, and each
of the assistant commissioners of the bureau
shall have charge of one district containing
such refugees or freedmen, to be assigned him
by the Commissioner with the approval of the
President. And the Commissioner shall, un-
der the direction of the President, and so far
as the same shall be, in his judgment, neces-
sary for the efficient and economical adminis-
tration of the affairs of the bureau, appoint
such agents, clerks, and assistants as may be
required for the proper conduct of the bureau.
Military officers or enlisted men may be de-
tailed for service and assigned to duty under
this act; and the President may, if in his
judgment safe and judicious so to do, detail
from the Army all the officers and agents of
this bureau; but no officer so assigned shall
have increase of pay or allowances. Each
agent or clerk, not heretofore authorized by
law, not being a military officer, shall have an
annual salary of not less than five hundred
dollars, nor more than twelve hundred dollars,
according to the service required of him. And
it shall be the duty of the Commissioner, when
it can be done consistently with public interest,
to appoint, as assistant commissioners, agents,
and clerks, such men as have proved their
loyalty by faithful service in the armies of the
Union during the rebellion. And all persons
appointed to service under this act and the act
to which this is an amendment, shall be so far
deemed in the military service of the United
States as to be under the military jurisdiction,
and entitled to the' military protection of the
Government while in discharge of the duties
of their office.
Sec. 4. Andbe it further enacted, That offi-
cers of the Veteran Reserve corps or of the
volunteer service, now on duty in the Freed-
men's Bureau as assistant commissioners,
agents, medical officers, or in other capacities,
whose regiments or corps have been or may
hereafter be mustered out of service, may be
retained upon such duty as officers of paid
bureau, with the same compensation as is now
provided by law for their respective grades ;
and the Secretary of War shall have power to
fill vacancies until other officers can be de-
tailed in their places without detriment to the
public service.
Sec. 5. And be it further enacted, That the
second section of the act to which this is an
amendment shall be deemed to authorize the
Secretary of War to issue such medicitl stores
or other supplies and transportation, and af-
ford such medical or other aid as here may
be needful for the purposes named in said
section: Provided, That no person shall be
deemed "destitute," "suffering," or "depend-
ent upon the Government for support," within
the meaning of this act, who is able to find
employment, and could, by proper industry or
exertion, avoid such destitution, suffering, or
dependence.
Sec. 6. Whereas, by the provisions of an
act approved February sixth, eighteen hun-
dred and sixty-three, entitled "An act to
amend an act entitled ' An act for the collec-
tion of direct taxes in insurrectionary districts
within the United States, and for other pur-
poses,' approved June seventh, eighteen hun-
dred and sixty-two," certain lands in the
parishes of St. Helena and Saint Luke,
South Carolina, were bid in by the United
States at public tax sales, and by the limita-
tion of said act the time of redemption of said
lands has expired; and whereas, in accord-
ance with instructions issued by President
Lincoln on the sixteenth day of September,
eighteen hundred and sixty-three, to the Uni-
ted States direct tax commissioners for South
Carolina, certain lands bid in by the United
States in the parish of Saint Helena, in said
State, were in part sold bj' the said tax com-
missioners to "heads of families of the Afri-
can race," iu parcels of not more than twenty
acres to each purchaser ; and .whereas, under
said instructions, the said tax commissioners
did also set apart as "school farms" certain
parcels of land in said parish, numbered on
their plats from one to thirty-three, inclusive,
making an aggregate of six thousand acres,
more or less: Therefore, be it further enacted,
That the sales made to "heads of families of
the African race," under the instructions of
President Lincoln to the United States direct
tax commissioners for South Carolina, of date
of September sixteenth, eighteen hundred and
sixty-three, are hereby confirmed and estab-
lished ; and all leases which have been made
to such "heads of families," by said direct
tax commissioners, shall be changed into cer-
tificates of sale in all cases wherein the lease
provides for such substitution; and all the
lands now remaining unsold, which come
within the same designation, being eight thou-
sand acres, more or less, shall be disposed of
according to said instructions.
Sec. 7. Andbe it further enacted, That all
other lands bid in by the United States at tax
sales, being thirty-eight thousand acres more or
less, and now in the hands of the said tax com-
missioners as the property of the United States,
in the parishes of Saint Helena and Saint Luke,
excepting the " school farms," as specified in
the preceding section, and so much as may be
necessary for military and naval purposes at
Hilton Head, Bay Point, and Land's End, tu d
excepting also the city of Port Royal, on Saiut
Helena Island, and the town of Beaufort, shall
be disposed of in parcels of twenty acres, atone
dollar and fifty cents per acre, to such persons
and to such only as have acquired and are now
occupying lands under and agreeably to the
provisions of General Sherman's special field
order, dated at Savannah, Georgia, January six-
teenth, eighteen hundred and sixty-five; and
the remainiug lands, if any, shall be disposed
