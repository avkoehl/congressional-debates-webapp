tery, in concert with the Fourth Brigade, which they did under a hot fire from the enemy; they pressed forward with courage and determination. The battery was hastily drawn off by the enemy, who fell back in disorder. I held my position with the brigade until dark, then fell back to connect with the troops on my left. During the four days following I moved forward, driving the enemy, and on the 10th instant took position south side of Utoy Creek, where we have remained in the same position since.

During the time embraced in this report, the officers and men have performed a large amount of labor and suffered from exposure, yet there has been little complaint, and I award to them much credit for their good conduct as officer and soldiers.

The casualties during this time have been light, considering the number of skirmishers and engagements they have passed through.

CAPTAIN: I have the honor to submit the following report of operations of this brigade since the 12th day of August, 1864:

At that time we were encamped upon the south side of Utoy Creek, this brigade, occupying a position upon the extreme right of the army. 13th, 14th, 15th, 16th, 17th, and 18th, remained in camp. ON the 19th accompanied the division upon a reconnaissance to the right about four miles, but discovered no enemy.

20th, again moved to the right to support the Fourteenth Army Corps while making a raid upon the Atlanta and West Point Railroad; remained in our old camp until the morning of the 28th instant, when we marched with other troops to the south and east toward the Macon railroad, our division operating upon the left flank of the army. On the 1st of September crossed the railroad.

2d, took up position in front of the enemy near Jonesborough, Ga., with considerable skirmishing, when they opened upon us with their artillery. Remained in this position until the evening of the 5th instant, when we recommenced falling back with the rest of the army upon Atlanta, arriving at this place on the afternoon of the 8th instant.
