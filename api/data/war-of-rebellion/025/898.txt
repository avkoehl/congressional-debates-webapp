GENERAL ORDERS, HDQRS. BRECKINRIDGE'S DIVISION, Numbers 8. Jackson, September 7, 1862.

The remaining brigades of this division will be ready to move as soon as possible northward by rail. The transportation will be left to follow after, by a suitable number of quartermasters, wagon-masters, and teamsters will be left to attend to them. In moving, there must be perfect order, and especially no straggling or wandering from the cars, and a commissioned officer will go in each car to enforce discipline and order. Canteens will be filled with water before starting and, as far as possible, buckets of warter will be provided for each car. Each brigade commander will report to these headquarters the earliest moment at which his brigade will be ready to move; also about the number of men, horses, and guns to be transported; and as soon as an order to move is received, two days' cooked rations will be prepared to be taken with the troops. Everything necessary to a movement in the field will be taken with the troops, except the wagons and teams and one-half of the tents. A portion of the tents will be taken to shelter the sick and feeble until the transportation reaches to command.
