colored men in the United States of the arms-bearing age amounts to less than 91,000, and they are nearly equally divided between the free and slave-holding States. If, however, we concede the probability of this class of persons enlisting for military duty in numbers proportionate to the white population, they would in all the States and Territories supply 18 regiment of 1,000 men each while the non-slaveholding States and the District of Columbia supply nearly 10 regiments. The State of Maine would furnish 50 men, New Hampshire 20, Massachusetts 400, Rhode Island 160, Vermont 30, New York and Pennsylvania could supply 4,000, while in any other State but Ohio it would be impossible to raise a full regiment. I send you also a table giving the number of slaves inthe United States of the arms-bearing age, which reaches nearly the figure of 750,000 the condition and circumstances of whom preclude all calculations as to what proportion could be made available as men at arms.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOS. C. G. KENNEDY,

Superintendent.
