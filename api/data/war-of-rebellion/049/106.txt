The force on the peninsula between the Potomac and Rappahannock consists of three regiments of infantry and one of cavalry, with four guns, near King George Court-House. They have a picket line from Lamb's Creek Church to the Potomac, and are taking large quantities of forage to the opposite side of the river from Port Conway.

Colonel Gregg reports all quiet and no change in his front. Jenkins' and Jones' brigades of cavalry are near Sperryville. General Buford reports no changes in his front.

It is rumored that Hampton with 5,000 cavalry has started from Culpeper Court-House to make a raid into Maryland.

The major-general commanding directs that you will send out and see if they are moving any force in that direction, and in what strength, and send in all the information you can gain. Send out scouts through the country to obtain all information; send word what force there is at Sperryville.
