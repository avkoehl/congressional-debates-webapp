cated, but learn this evening my instructions were not received. I will try again immediately.

FORT HENRY, March 15, 1862.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Saint Louis:

An expedition under General Wallace has cut one-half mile of trestle work north of Purdy. Cheatham, with a force estimated at about 18,000 (probably will not exceed 12,000), is to the left of Wallace. The whole estimated strength of the enemy from the point referred to to Eastport and near the east is estimated at 50,000 to 60,000. I am much exercised to know if it will be prudent to leave the garrison intended for this place mostly at Fort Heiman. The latter point commands the river effectually, even with light artillery, and is accessible by good roads from the interior. A small garrison would be perfectly secure at Henry, and might not be at the other.

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General.

FORT HENRY, March 15, 1862.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Saint Louis, Mo.:

In my telegram yesterday I stated that Clarksville was abandoned by our forces. I ordered the abandonment four days ago, but have not yet heard from the troops there. Mules and harness are arriving fast from Cincinnati, but as yet no wagons. It is now raining, and has been continuously for forty-eight hours. Weather cold and roads impassable. General Wallace has destroyed a long piece of trestle work between Eastport and Corinth. Rebel force at Corinth, Eastport, and points east represented at from 50,000 to 60,000.

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF WEST TENNESSEE,Fort Henry, March 15, 1862.

Colonel RICHARD J. OGLESBY,

Commanding First Brigade, First Division:

You will immediately embark your command on board steamer Belle Memphis, ordered to report to you at Metal Landing. See that as many are put on board as she can carry, having regard for health, and when embarked proceed up the Tennessee until you overtake the expedition commanded by Major General C. F. Smith, to whom you will report. You will also see that no negroes are permitted to be carried off by any of your command, if there are any with you, who were captured at Fort Donelson. The orders are that they be turned over to the quartermaster's department. If not so captured, leave them on the shore.

This order must be strictly complied with.

By order of Major General U. S. Grant:

JNumbers A. RAWLINS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
