1863.
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
every sea. This bill is to call on the patriotism
and energy and activity of the merchant service,
and see if they cannot do something; and see if
the supremacy of the sea is to be abandoned to
these confederates. This bill relates to that ob-
ject. If there is anything of more consequence
than that, I should like the Senator from Massa-
chusetts to state what it is.
Mr. FESSENDEN. All I have to say about
the matter is this. I have no objection to this bill
coming up at any time the Senator can get it up;
but I do object to making special assignments at
this period of the session.
Mr. SUMNER. It is proposed to take it up
and adjourn, so that it may be the order for to-
morrow, and I object to that.
Mr. TRUMBULL. I shall certainly object to
the bill coming up either now or to-morrow. The
bill giving aid to the State of Missouri for the pur-
pose of securing the abolishment of slavery there-
in, in my judgment is altogether a more important
measure than the fitting out of privateers against
the rebels, who have got no commerce for our pri-
vateers to plunder at all; and I renew the motion
that we now proceed to the consideration of exec-
utive business, giving notice that I shall insist, so
far as I can, on bringing up House bill No. 632
to-morrow.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is moved by
the Senator from Illinois that the Senate proceed
to the consideration of executive business.
The question being put, there wcie, on a divis-
ion—ayes 25, noes 4; 110 quorum voting.
Mr. DOOLITTLE called for the yeas and nays,
and they were ordered.
Mr. McDOUCrALL. I wish the Senate to un-
derstand how the question now stands. The prop-
osition of the Senator from New Hampshire is 
Mr. TRUMBULL. Discussion is not m order
on a motion to go into executive session.
Mr. SUMNER. There being no quorum, I take
it nothing is in order.
Mr. McDOUGALL. If nothing isinorder,very
well; let disorder reign.
The question being taken by yeas and nays, re-
sulted—yeas 38, nay 1; as follows:
YEAS—Messrs. Anthony, Arnold, tSiowninL'. Carlile,
Chandler, Ciarlc,Collamer, Cowan, Davis, Dixon, Pooiit-
tle, Fessenden, Foot, Foster, Haulm;;, Harlan, Hams,

Sumner, Ten Eyek, Trumbull, Turpie, Wade, Wall, Wil-
kinson, Willey, Wilson of Massachusetts, and Wilson of
Mivsouu—38.
NAY—Mr. Hale—1.
So the motion was agreed to; and after some
time spent in the consideration of executive busi-
ness, the doors were reopened, and the Senate
adjoui ned.
