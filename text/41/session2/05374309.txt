havingbeen acted upon by the Senate in another
shape, the bill will be indefinitely postponed.
Mr. HARLAN. I believe the subject-mat-
ter has been incorporated in another bill; but
it should be passed over, remaining on the Cal-
endar, until we see if the House agree to it as
an amendment to the Indian appropriation bill.
' The PRESIDING- OFFICER. It will be
passed over.
william chinn,
The next bill on the Calendar was the bill
(S. No. 545) for the relief of William Chinn;
which was read the second time. It provides
for the payment of Â£723 to William Chinn, a
colored man, of Prince William county, in the
State of Virginia, in his own right, and as the
lawful assignee of Mrs. Frances B. Gibson, his
late mistress, in lull compensation of all losses
sustained by him and her, severally and jointly,
on account of live stock, provisions, and forage
of every kind, furnished to and taken by the
troops of the United States from the farm of
Mrs. Gibson, in that county, during the late
civil war, and in full compensation for all losses
sustained by either and by both, for pasturage,
damage to fences on the farm, and for any
other losses not enumerated.
Mr. SUMNER. What is the sum total?
Mr. PRATT. I will state to the Senator
from Massachusetts 
Mr. HOWARD. I believe there is a report
accompanying that bill. 1 wrote one myself
formerly, when I was in the Committee on
Claims.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be
no objection, the report will be read.
The Secretary proceeded to read the report
submitted by Mr. Pratt, from the Committee
on Claims, on the 10th of February, 1870 ; but
alter reading a few sentences  
Mr. TRUMBULL. I think we need spend
no more time upon that. It involves a ques-
tion that we have very often debated here.
Mr. HOWARD. Nob at all.
Mr. TRUMBULL. The only distinction is
here that this is the case of a colored man ;
and I do not think that makes any difference.
Mr. HOWARD. There is a marked dis-
tinction.
Mr. TRUMBULL. I object to the consid-
eration of the bill.
Mr. HOWARD. Will the Senator allow me
to make an explanation'/
Mr. SHERMAN. It is hardly worth while
to go into it.
Mr. HOWARD. Just one word of explana-
tion. This property was all protected by a
solemn safeguard issued by the officer in com-
mand of that region of country, by which the
person and the property of the owner were
sacredly protected ; bat notwithstanding that
safeguard, the property was taken by our
troops. Now, if there is any validity and ]
sacredness in a safeguard this property ought
to be paid for : if there be not, it (alls within
the category of other similar claims.
The PRESIDING OFFICER.. The Chair
will again put the question. Is there objection
to proceeding with tins bill?
Mr. SHERMAN. The Senator who objects
is sitting in his place engaged. Certainly the
rule requires that when objection is made, a
bill shall not be proceeded with further.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair
understood the Senator 
Mr. SHERMAN. Well, I object.
ThePRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator
from Ohio objects, and the bill will be passed
over.

Mr. HARLAN. I object to the bill.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Being ob-
jected to, the bill cannot be proceeded with.
Mr. NYE. It is quite evident that we are
not going to do anything. We spend half an
hour in reading a bill, and then after it is read
objection is made to it. We make no sort of
headway. I move that the Senate adjourn.
Mr. RAMSES'. Letussit until ten o'clock.
Mr. NYE. What do we gain by sitting here
reading bills, and then having objection made?
The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is moved
that the Senate do now adjourn.

Mr. ANTHONY. I beg to make one sug-
gestion: that if Senators intend to object to
bills they will do it when the title is read, and
not at the end of the reading of the bill, and it
will save us a great deal of time.
Mr. WILLIAMS. How can a man object
until he knows what is in the bill?
Mr. FOWLER. I object to this bill being
proceeded with.
The PRESIDING OFFICER, It will be
passed over.
