No. 90. Report of Brigadier General Henry W. Birge, U. S. Army, commanding First Brigade, of operations September 19-23.
HDQRS. FIRST BRIGADIER, SECOND DIV, 19TH ARMY CORPS,Harrisonburg, September 27, 1864.

SIR: I have the honor to report that this brigade moved from camp near Berryville at 2 a. m. September 19; marched through Berryville to within two miles of Winchester, and at 11 a. m. was assigned position by Brigadier-General Grover, commanding division. The line was formed from right to left as follows: Fourteenth New Hampshire Volunteers, Colonel Gardiner; Twenty-sixth Massachusetts, Colonel Farr; Twelfth Maine, Lieutenant-Colonel Ilsley; Fourteenth Maine, Colonel Porter, and Seventy-fifth New York, Lieutenant-Colonel Babcock. A strong skirmish line was advanced through and to the edge of a piece of woods in front of the position, and the Ninth Connecticut, Colonel Cahill, deployed 400 yards on the right on a line perpendicular to the line of battle, with skirmishers in advance. Colonel Cahill was instructed to connect the left of his skirmish line with the right of the advanced skirmishers, and to conform to the movements of the brigade and maintain his relative position by moving by a flank as the line advanced. The Third Brigade was in position on my left, and two regiments of Fourth Brigade on the right. At 11.45 a. m. received orders to move on the enemy, and immediately advanced through the woods before mentioned and into an open field about 500 yards in width; crossed this field under an artillery and infantry fire from the enemy in position in a belt of woods in front and extending to the right, and when within 200 yards charged with fixed bayonets at double-quick. Broke his line on the entire front of the brigade and drove him through and out of the woods. As the troops entered the woods I was ordered by Genera Grover to haled and hold that position and not to go farther into the woods, but the charge was so rapid and impetuous and the men so much excited by the sight of the enemy in full retreat before them that it was impossible to execute the order, and the whole line pressed forward to the extreme edge of the timber, some 300 yards
