fice her great agricultural advantages, and rush forward to sus.
tairr the country.
We have been told, said Mr T of the great power and re-
sources of England, and warned to be prepared for a conflict
With her. He believed that one of theeauses that induced us
to incur such heavy debts, was the great dread of England.
But remember the war of 1812, ana how weak we were
then1 m comparison to what we are now, and yet we feared not
to engage her What was our strength now, compared to
what it was then? Mr T here took a vh w of the increased po
pu'ation, and resources of thecountiy, the great advantages
we derive from the improvevement of steam navigation, and of
railroads, andadverfed to the ease with which large forces could
almost instantaneously be concentrated at New Orleans 01 New
York And yet, sai 1 he, with all these advantages we are told
that We must increase our army and navy Without a dollar
in the Treasury, they were called upon to make heavy appro
pnatrons for the army, the navy, and the Post OffieeD part
ment He could not conceive howgentlemen could reconcile it
to-themselves to be willing to add to the embarrassments of the
countiy for such purposes Fur none of these expenditures
would he go, nor would he give his consent to the issue of these
notes, unless a fund was provided for then redemption If, said
he, your revenue is not sufficient for the support of Govern-
ment lay taxes to increase it, but do not fall into the error
commuted by several of the States of creating a debt without
setting apart a fund to secure its payment After some further
remarks, Mr T yielded the floor, and
Sir  J   G FLOYD moved that the committee rise    Lost
Mr. T proceeded with and concluded his remarks—with-
drawing the motion to strike out the enacting clause of the
bill
The question was then taken on "Mr Arnold's amendment,
and it was rejected
And the question was taken on Mr Underwood s amend-
ment; and it was rejected
Mr GILMER moved a substitute for the proviso of the bill,
providing that the notes to be issued undei thisbilUhould be
in lieu of so much of the twelve, million loan    Agreed to
Mr ¿EVERETT offered hisamendmen limiting the timedur
ing which these notes should be issued to tne piesent cession
Lost.
Mr FILLMORE offered a veibal amendment    Agieed to
Mr GORDON moved that the committee use    Lo&t
Mr. G then went into a political speech
After which the committee rose, and repoite 1 the bill and
amendments to the House
