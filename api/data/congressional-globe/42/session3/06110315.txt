mittee on Foreign Affairs will not take its

CHANGE OF NAME OF NATIONAL BANK.
Mr. HOOPER, of Massachusetts. I ask
that by unanimous consent the bill (S. No.
1272) authorizing the East Chester National
Bank of Mount Vernon to change its location
and name be taken from the Speaker's table
and put upon its passage now. It is a bill
simply to change the name and location of a
bank. It is in the form in which we have passed
two or three other similar bills this session,
and I think there can be no possible objection
to it.
Mr. NIBLACK. The bill called up by the
gentleman from Massachusetts is one which
affects my district somewhat. I have looked
into it, therefore, and I consider it is unexcep-
tionable. It is recommended by the Comptrol-
ler of the Currency.
There being no objection, the bill was taken
from the Speaker's table, and read a first and
Becond time.
The bill was read. It authorizes, under the
usual conditions, the East Chester National
Bank of Mount Vernon, now located in the
village of Mount Vernon, county of West-
chester, State of New York, to change its
location to the city of Evansville. county of
Vanderberg, State of Indiana, and its title
to that of the Evansville National Bank of the
State of Indiana.
The bill was ordered to be read a third time ;
and it was accordingly read the third time,
and passed.
Mr. HOOPER, of Massachusetts, moved
to reconsider the vote by which the bill was
passed ; and also moved that the motion to
reconsider be laid on the table.
The latter motion was agreed to.
POSTAL TELEGRAPH.
Mr. PALMER, by unanimous consent, from
the Committee on Appropriations, reported a
bill (H. R. No. 3261) to connect the telegraph
â– with the postal service, and to reduce the rates
of correspondence by telegraph; which was
read a first and second time, and, with the
accompanying report, recommitted to the
Committee on Appropriations, and ordered to
be printed.
Mr. HOLMAN moved to reconsider the
vote by which the bill was recommitted; and
also moved that the motion to reconsider be
laid on the table.
The latter motion was agreed to.
ELEVATOR IN NORTH WING OF CAPITOL
Mr. GARFIELD, of Ohio. I ask in cour-
tesy to the Senate that we pass a bill which
comes over to us from that body providing for
the construction of an elevator in the north
wing of the Capitol. There are four men in
the Senate who are not able to reach its Halls
without some assistance such as this, and fur-
thermore, I am satisfied that if an improve-
ment of this kind is introduced successfully
into the other wing of this buildiDg, we shall
have it here.
Mr. FARNSWORTH. I am inclined to
think that members of Congress get suffi-
ciently elevated without any machinery.
[Laughter.]
Mr. GARFIELD, of Ohio. I ask, sir, that
the bill to authorize the construction of a
steam passenger and freight elevator in the
northern wing of the Capitol be taken up and
passed.
The bill was read. It appropriates the sum
of $8,500 for the construction of a steam pas-
senger and freight elevator in the north end
of "the Capitol, under the direction of the
architect of the Capitol.
Mr. FARNSWORTH. I move to amend
by adding after the word "north " the words
"and south."
Mr. GARFIELD, of Ohio. There is no
objection to that amendmentifyou will double
the amount of the appropriation.^
Mr. DAWES. There is no objection to that
experiment as an experiment.
Mr. GARFIELD, of Ohio. Let it be tried at
the other end of the building, and we will adopt
it here. They say that this amendment will
dispense with the services of four employes
who are now carrying documents, &c., up
j stairs and down stairs. I hope there will be
no objection to the passage of the bill.
Mr. COX. I object.
The bill therefore remained upon the
Speaker's table.
