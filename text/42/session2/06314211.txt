It will bo seen by the following table that we have
compared Jhe expenditures of the War Department
for 1871 with the smallest expenditures of any
year of Mr. Buchanan's administration, that of
1860, and there is such a disparity between the
expenditures of that year as they appear, and
former years, as to lead to the inquiry whether all
the debts and liabilities incurred for that year
were paid within the year, or allowed to go over
to be met by the incoming administration of Mr.
Lincoln, and to be lost sight of through the other
expenses of the great rebellion. History places the
transactions of the head of that Department in so
questionable a light during the year preceding the
war that comment upon such a miraculous econ-
omy of expenditures is unnoccsary :

The following items which are included in the ag-
gregate as expenditures both for the years i860 and
1871 are deducted from eacn, for the reason that they
are not expenditures in the true meaning of the
word, as they involve no outlay of money by the
Treasury, and are no burden upon the tax-payers,
they being merely entrieson both the debit and credit
side of tho. books (made necessary by the system of
book-keeping in practice) of moneys received from
persons and subsequently returned to them or ex-
pended in their behalf, namely:
