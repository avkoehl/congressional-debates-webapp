A. SCHOEPF,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

[First indorsement.]

OFFICE COMMISSARY-GENERAL OF PRISONERS,

Washington, D. C., September 15, 1864.

Respectfully submitted to the Secretary of War.

The within orders of General Schoepf countermand the orders of the War Department, which authorize and limit the correspondence of prisoners. If there is occasion to restrict still more this privilege it is proper that General Schoepf should report the necessity for the consideration of the Secretary of War. Frequent appeals have been made to me for permission to write to prisoners, and it was only in this way that I learned that General Schoepf had published new regulations.

W. HOFFMAN,

Colonel Third Infantry and Commissary-General of Prisoners.
