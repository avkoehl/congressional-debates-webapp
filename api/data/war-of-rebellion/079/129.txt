The major - general commanding directs me to send you the inclosed copy of letter* from Major - General Sherman (dated 6th instant), with direction to literally carry out the instructions therein, and to report to these headquarters the manner in which they are executed. A DIVISION from Seventeenth Corps will be sent out to support your reconnaissance.

October 7, 1864 - 8 p. m.

Colonel W. T. CLARK, Assistant Adjutant - General:

COLONEL: I have forced two brigades of Jackson's cavalry DIVISION beyond this point, and now hold the bridge over the right branch of Sweet Water and the Dallas and Campbellton road and within three miles of the Dallas and Villa Rica road. Rebel cavalry have all left the lower Sweet Water and country south of this point and have gathered in about Dallas, covering the movements of Hood's army, which is not marching on any of the rebel roads south from Dallas. I have read Major - General Sherman's dispatch to General Howard. I shall here await further orders from him (General Howard), ready to move in any direction. General Belknap's infantry is encamped two miles and a half in my rear, covering the Dallas road.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. KILPATRICK,

Brigadier - General.

[First indorsement.]
HDQRS. DEPARTMENT AND ARMY OF THE TENNESSEE,October 8, 1864 - 1 a. m.

GENERAL: General Kilpatrick has received my order to return, and will start back at 3 a. m. A citizen (lady) says that she crossed Hood's bridge day before yesterday, and that she saw his cavalry afterward set it on fire. I do not regard this as reliable information, but it may be true.

Respectfully,

O. O. HOWARD,

Major - General.
