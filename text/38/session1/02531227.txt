1864.
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE,
that the preamble and resolutions may be referred
to the Committee on Commerce.
The motion was agreed to.
Mr. SUMNER. I offcra memorial from a com-
mitteeappointed by the German Radical National
Club of Philadelphia, in relation to military con-
scription, the conclusion of which is as follows:
" That they appeal to the wisdom of Congress by the Jaws
providing that instead of conscription hereafter we shall
have a military system properly classifying all able-bodied
men without nubbtitution, and with only few exemptions
of a strictly determined character; which system, if faith-
fully executed beyond the reach of favor and discrimina-
tion, political or medical, would, in our opinion, male? this
nation unconquerable by any enemy, foreign or domestic.,}
This is signed by a committee several in num-
ber. I ask its reference to the Committee on Mil-
itary Affairs and the Militia.
The motion was agreed to.

MESSA.C1E FROM TIIE HOUSE.
A message from the House of Representatives,
by Mr. Li.oyd, its Ciiief Clerk, announced that
the House of Representatives had passed a bill
(No. 198) making appropriations for the support
of the Army for the year ending; the 30th June,
18G5; in which the concuirencc of the Senate was
tequested.
CENT AND TWO CENT COINS.
Mr. CLARK. If there is nothing before the
Senate I will ask the Senate now to take up the
bill (S. No. 183) in amendment of an act entitled
"An act relating to foreign coins and the coin-
age of cents at the Mint of the United States,"
approved Febmary 21, 1857. It is a matter of
some importance that it should be immediately
passed.
The motion was agreed to; and the Senate, as
ill Committee of the Whole, proceeded to con-
sider the bill. The standard weight of the cent
'coined at the Mint of the United States is pro-
posed to be forty-eight grains, or one tenth of one
ounce troy, and the cent is to' be composed of â– 
ninety-five per cent, of copper and five per cent,
of tin and zinc, m such proportions as shall be
determined by the Dircctorof the Mint: and fiom
time lo time there is to be struck and coined at the
mint a two cent piece, of the same composition,
of the standard weight of ninety-six grains or one
fifth of one ounce troy, with no greater deviation
than four grains to each piece of the cent and
cent coins; and the shape,'njottoe's, and.deyic? ~
of these coins are to be fixed by the Director of
the Mint, with the approval of the Secretary of
the Treasury. The laws now in force relating to
the coinage of cents and providing for theptfr-
chase of material, and prescribing'theappropriate,
duties of the officers of the Mintand the Secretary
of the Treasury, are to be extended to the coinage-
thus provided for. All laws now iaforce irei&tjffg,
to the coins of the United States.and their striking:
and coining are, so far as applicable, to be ex-
tended to the coinage thus authorized, whether1
these laws are penal or otherwise, for the security
of the coin, regulating and guarding the process
of striking and coining, for preventing debasement
or counterfeiting, or for any other purpose. ThS
Director of the Mint is to prescribe suitable regu-
lations to insure a due conformity to the required
weights and. proportions of alloy in these coins,
and he is to order trials thereof to be made frottl
time to time by the assayer of the Mint, whereof
a report shall be made in writing to the Director.
These coins are to be a legal tender in any pay-
ment, the one cent coin to the amount of ten cents
and the two cent coin totheamountoftwentyeents}
and these coins may be paid out in exchange for
the lawful currency of the United States, except
cents or half cents issued under former acts of
Congress,in suitable sums, by the treasurer of the
Mint and by such otherdepositaries as th"eSecre-
tary of the Treasury may designate, under gen-
eral regulations proposed by the Director of the
Mintand approved by the Secretary of theTreao-
ury; and the expenses incident to such exchange,
distribution, and transmission may be paid out of
the profits of the coinage, and the net profits of
the coinage, ascertained in like manner as' is pre-
scribed in the second section of the act to which this
is a supplement, are to be transferred to the Treas-
ury of the United States. It is further provided
that if any person or persons shall make, issue,
or pass, or cause to be made, issued, or passed,
any coin, card, token, or devicc whatsoever, in
metal or its compounds, intended to pass or be
passed as money for a one cent piece or a two
cent piece, such person or persons shali be deemed
guilty of a misdemeanor, and shall on conviction
be punished by a fine not exceeding $1,000, and
by imprisonment for a term not exceeding live
years.
Mr. CLARK. The bill simply provides for
the making of a cent with a different alloy from
that which we now useâ€”a bronze cent alloyed
with tin and zinc, instead of nickel, on account of
the difficulty of obtaining the alloy of the cent
now used; and also provides for the coinage of a
two cent piece of the same kind. I have in my
hand a communication from the Secretary of the
Treasury, recommending this to be done for the
reason that I have suggested, and also a com-
munication from the Director of the Mint. I will
not take the trouble to have them read, unless
some Senator desires it. The bill was carefully
prepared at the Department, and the Committee
on Finance recommend its passage.
Mr. TRUMBULL. I should like to inquire
whether this provision for the coinage of a new
cent, and the introduction of atwo cent piece, de-
teriorates the intrinsic value of the cent. The
cent as a general thing does not circulate in the
country now, I think. We see some few of them
here, but m my travels I very seldom see a cent.
I do not know how it maybe ill other portions of â€¢
the country.
Mr. CLARK. There is a very large demand
for them, and we are coining a great many of
them. I think that on account of the rise in the
price of nickel the cent cannot now be made for
a cent, and it is also found to be an inconvenient
alloy. Perhaps I had better send the communi-
cation of the Secretary of the Treasury to the
Clerk, and have it read.
The Secretary read, as follows:
Treasury Department, March 5,1864.
Silt: I have the lionni to transmit herewith a copy of a
communication fiom the Director ot the Mint at Philadel-
phia, under date of die 2(1 instant, recoinmenrtin? tile dis-
use of nickel in the cent coinage of the United States, ana
liic substitution of bronze, on account of the scarcity and
inciea-ied expense of the former and the superiority of
the hitter for purposes of coinage; also, the coinage of a
two cent piece of bronze. I tiansmittliedraftorabiHpro-
vidins for the above changes, which I concur with the Di-
rector of the Mint in believing to be to the advantage or
tile public interests, as well as for the convemcncc of the
