(Received June 3, 8.45 a. m.)

Our advance troops are near Winchester and several regiments near Martinsburg. It is with great difficulty that they are got ready for marching orders. I hope to-morrow they will all be on the move. Several officers captured at Winchester returned to-night. They represent that the rebels evacuated the town Friday last.

N. P. BANKS.

Honorable E. M. STANTON.

MARTINSBURG, June 3, 1862.

General Sigel, with 6,000, and Crawford's brigade, Williams' division, 3,000, will be in Winchester to-morrow. There is [no?] positive news of Jackson. Message received from McDowell at Front Royal says he believes Fremont is at Strasburg. The river is very high at Williamsport, and crossing is very slow.

N. P. BANKS,

Major-General, Commanding.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.
