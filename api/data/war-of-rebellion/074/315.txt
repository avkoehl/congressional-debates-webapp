DeGress' battery, and the Forty-sixth [Ohio] near our old line. During the night the enemy evacuated his position, thus ending our operations before Resaca. There had been no brilliant general engagement; nothing done to put the test to the men, but in all my campaigns I never saw men in such excellent condition or exhibit a greater eagerness to do anything required of them.

Much credit is due the regimental commanders, Colonels Dickerman, Catterson, and Miller, and Major Giesy, for the promptness in obeying all demands and the good example set to their men. Lieutenant E. Bickett, Forty-sixth Ohio, was severely wounded, while leading his skirmishers to the front, on the 14th.

The members of my staff, Captain Upton, Lieutenants Grimes, Johnson, and Parsons, deserve much credit for their efficient assistance rendered during this campaign.
