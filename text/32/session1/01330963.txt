Mr. HARRIS, of Tennessee. Would it be in
order for the gentleman from Virginia, [Mr. Av-
erett,] who objected to the bill No. 170, to with-
draw his objection, and to lay the bill aside?
The CHAIRMAN. It can only be done by
general consent.
Mr. SWEETSER. I object to the withdrawal
of the objection.

Dwelly, came up as next m order.
The bill provides that the Secretary of the In-

posted as a sentinel on the parapet of Fort Scammel.
Mr. SWEETSER. I rise for explanation.
When 1 made objection to the withdrawal by the
gentleman from Virginia [Mr Averett] of his
objection to bill No. 170, pressed forward by the
gentleman from Tennessee, [Mr. Harris,] he
[Mr. Averett] understood my objection as made
to the bill itself. I do not wish to have it so un-
derstood. I gave notice, that after an objection
had been made to a bill, and that bill was passed
by and another taken up, I should object to the
objection being withdrawn. And if the Chair is
of opinion that I have no right to control that
matter, and rules the point against me, then I shall
take my objection directly to the bill. But I wish
the committee to understand that the point I make
is this: that if a bill is read through, and objection
is made, I will not permit the objection to be with-
drawn after the next number on the calendar is
called.
Mr. AVERETT. I objected to that bill ori-
ginally, but, after further investigation, I became
satisfied that the report was correct, and that the
bill ought to pass. I ask leave to withdraw the
objection, and I claim the right.
The CHAIRMAN. The right hasalways been
exercised, and the gentleman from Ohio [Mr.
Sweetser] has a cfear right to object to the bill.
Mr. AVERETT. Have 1 the right to with-
draw my objection ?
The CHAIRMAN. The gentleman has that
right, according to the custom of the committee
heretofore. .
Mr. SWEETSER. Then I make my objection
to the bill. â–  , i -
Mr. KING, of New York. Another rule is,
you shall not go back upon the calendar, except
by unanimous consent.
The CHAIRMAN. Debate is not ill order.
Mr. SWEETSER. Does the Chair decide that
my objection is not debatable.'
The CHAIRMAN. The Chair must so decide,
as he understands the practice of the House.
Mr. MARSHALL, of Kentucky. Senate bill
No. 67, was heretofore stopped upon my objection,
and I desire to -withdraw it.
upon my objection. Having since examined the
papers, I am satisfied that my objections were not
well founded, and I now withdraw the objection.
It was unanimously reported by the Committee on
Commerce, and I hope it will now be passed.
Mr. SACKETT. I understand that the practice
of the House, so far as the last Congress is con-
cerned, was this: that you could not go back during
the same day, to withdraw an objection interposed
to the passage of a bill in committee. The very
object of this objection is, to allow members time
to examine the case; but you can go back,-in case
objection was made upon a previous day. There-
fore, I think the gentleman has a right to with-
I draw it.
I Mr. HARRIS, of Tennessee. In relation to
bill No. 170, upon which this whole discussion has
j sprung up, there is now no objection, and the bill
i will be laid aside.
I The CHAIRMAN. There is no objection,
except to discussion. [Laughter.]
Mr. SWEETSER. I objected.
Mr. HARRIS. You objected to the gentle-
! man's withdrawing his objection, and the Chair
| decides that you have no right to make that ob-
jection.
| Mr. SWEETSER. Do I understand the Chair
i to decide that, where an objection is made to" a
1 bill, and it is laid aside, and the committee pass
j to the next case, if the objection is subsequently
! withdrawn, we can go back '
I The CHAIRMAN. The Chair determines
that such was the practice of the last Congress,
I and that, where there is no positive rule, theprac-
! tice of the committee, or the House, obtains, of
course, as a rule.
Mr. SWEETSER. If the Chair makes that
decision, I appeal from it.
Mr. MARSHALL, of Kentucky. I rise to a
: question of order. I understand that the subject
' upon which thegentleman from Ohio [Mr. SwisET-
! see] proposes to take an appeal, had passed from
I before the committee when I made a motion to
[ have an objection to another bill withdrawn. I
I object to the gentleman's overslaughing my mo-
! tion in that sort of style.
i The CHAIRMAN. The gentleman from Ohio
[Mr. Sweetser] appeals from the decision of the
Chair.
' Mr. KING, of New York. As this is a sub-
ject of some importance, 1 desire to understand
I clearly what the decision is.
! The CHAIRMAN. The Chair has decided,
'â–  upon the practice of the last Congress, that if a
i gentleman withdraws his objection to a bill, that
! then that bill may proceed, if there is no other
person objecting to it.
; Mr. KING. But where there is an objection
I to going back, then it is not in order.
The CHAIRMAN. The decision of the Chair
i is confined to the objection of the day.
! Mr. HOUSTON. Is it in order to say any-
1 thing upon the appeal ?
' The CHAIRMAN. It is not in order to dis-
i cusw any question before the commiuee.
i The question was then taken, Shall the decision
i of the Chair stand as the judgment of the com-
! miltee? and there were, upon a divisionâ€”ayes 77,
I noes not counted. .
So the decision of the Chair was sustained,
i Mr. MARSHALL. Do I understand that the
I Chair has decided that I cannot withdraw my ob-
! jection now to the bill? _ .
| The CHAIRMAN. If there is any objection
I to it, the Chair decides that the gentleman cannot
I withdraw it.
! Mr SWEETSER. I do not understand how
' the Chair decides that. That is what I have been
' at'Mr. JONES, of Tennessee. It must be within
' the recollection of the gentleman from Kentucky,
! [Mr Marshall,] and of the members of this
i committee, who were here during the last Con-
i o-ress, that a bill having been objected to, and
! passed over, a gentleman could Â«ot go back to it
i and withdraw an objection, for the very reason, as
! it was ur^ed upon one or two occasions, that the
! friends of the bill might make an objection to it,
I and then, when those who were really opposed to
! lt were absent, might withdraw their objection to
â–  the bill and pass it.
Mr. MARSHALL. I understand that case to
Mr "SRYMOUR. of New York. I merely wish ji ml. â€” - - - .
to  ii fhe attention of the. Chair to the fact, that |j be^totally different from Aeon^^ed. ^
Senate bill No. 67, was laid aside some time since ;
The CHAIRMAN.
