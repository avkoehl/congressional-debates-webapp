Interference in Elections—Mr. Rottne.
Senate.
the version of his remarks given by his friend in
me Baltimore Patriot BaltimoieOppositionjour-
nals have, of late, become good authority with
the honorable Senator.   The reporter says
"Mr Wall, witlHhe genuine spirit of a demagogue had
sneered it the legislation of England affording a pr< cedent
for thin hil!, and said, < «uch a plant may be indigenous m
such a soil' Mr Rives noticed tins remark, and repelled
the sneer and the argument in one of the most glowinc nn
passioned, and effective parages I ever listen* d to * What
soil 'heevclaimed ' theEnglishsoil, the Anglo Sixonsoil?
In what soil would we expect to find such a plant indige-
nous? In what soil has the tree oí liberty flouiiohed moie
than in England? Is it not the land of our glorious anees
tors, whence they brought the most valued principles of our
Constitution, their love ofliherty and hatred of tjianny md
denance of oppressors, and, above all, that sturdy spirit,
which, if now revived, would be the salvation ot our pres
ent institutions ? Whence did your fathers imbibe tin pnn
ciples of the Declaration of independence, ot our bills of
rights, an¿l of the great charter of our liberties? Win nee
bat from England ?   Is that land to be thus di&honeied?' "
Sir, the honorable Senator from South Caro
lina [Mi Preston] was even more extiavagant
than this in his rapturous plaudits upon the Bnt-
lsh constitution He distinctly intimated that
hbeity was not a native of our soil We brought
it with us fiom England It was written m our
hearts by our lllustnous Anglo Saxon ancestois.
Their institutions,, says the honorable Senatot,
constitute the most magnificent fabnc of libeity
evet erected under the wide circle of the sun
This onental language of admiration is not 011-
ginal with the Senator It was uttered fifty years
ago by the father of ultia Federalism In his
tieatise upon the American constitutions, he pro-
nounced the Butish constitution to be " the most
stupendous fabnc of human invention " These
gentlemen are taking us back to the d lys of
Adams and Hamilton, when admiration of Great
Butain was the predominant feeling of theirpaity
They dispaiage our people and our institutions
We are not indebted to Englind for our liberty
That tree is indigenous to every soil It springs
up spontaneously in the heait of every man
Libeity is the gift of God to every human being
We are indebted to ourselves, and to our own
mtiepid revolutionary ancestors, for the fieedom
we enjoy, and the Democratic institutions which
secure that liberty The swoid won those glori-
ous trophies against all the valoi and all the in-
solence of Butish mercenaries, Butish tyranny,
and British oppression
Sir, the authoi of the " History of Party in
England" has this passage in reftience to the co-
alition between Mr Fox and Loid North I
íecommend it to the attention of the honoiable
Senator fiom Virginia
' The oecunence of this coalition [sajs CooKe] is
greatlj to be d plortd, as m ( xmi] le to nn u who uithoub
any of the poner, may nevertheless le I inclined ioimtlite
ike error* of ¿ox It is to he deploied as a blot upon the
character of a gr< at man, as i preei dent uhith sli il es ut the
founlation oj political morality and as iweipon in the
hand of tho e who would destioy all confidence in the
honi stv of public men "
Mr President, let me console the honoiable
Senator in his new position, which he has suffi-
ciently defined to render it quite intelligible, with
a quotation from the defense made for himself by
Mi  Pox
" If [said that statesman] men of honor can meet on
points of general national concein I see no reason for call
ing such a meeting an unnatural junction It is neither
wise nor nohle to kpep up animosities forever It is neither
just nor condid to keep up animosity when the cause of it
is no more It is not my nature to bear malice, or to live
in ill will My friendships are perpetual, my enmities are
not "
The honorable Senator has sufficiently dem-
onstrated that his enmities are not peipetual
Whether his friendships are so, I leave to the de-
cision of those who have so long and so painfully
listened to his denunciations of the measures of
his foimcr party friends, witnessed hisgiadual
change of principle in important respects, and
seen las adoption of the very language of the Op
position in íelation to the exercise of the Exec
utive veto by President Jackson
Sir, the animation and perseverance of the Sen-
atoi in his hostility to his cailyfi lends aie worthy
of a bettei cause The Senatoi fiom NewYoik,
two days ago, cal'ed up Ins bill to piotect the
public moneys in the hands of receiving and dis-
buis ng ofhceis In the face of the prophetic
declaration of the Senator from Pennsylvania, as-
sented to  by the Senator from Massachusetts,
that another bank explosion must soon take place,
thegentleman, quick as thought, rose in his place,
and offered a substitute to the bill, requiring the
public money to be deposited in banks The
second failure of the Mobile Branch Bank, with
more than half a million of the funds of the Gov-
ernment in its custody, is disregarded by the Sen-
ator, and he seems determined again to place us
at the mercy of banks
The Senator tells us that he has not changed
his principles, nor deserted his party They
have abandoned their principles He stands
where he has always stood Sir, how often have
you and I heard excuses of this sort urged in
justification of apostacy ' Why, sir, the Sena-
tor has become the leader of the party on the
othei side of the Senate He has put himself
into thefiont íanks of the Opposition He is
then child and their champion But he denies
that he has entered into any coalition with them.
I know not that he has made written stipulations
with them, but we mustjudgethe tree by itsfiuit,
his beais that only which is palatable to them
The Senator from South Caiolina [Mr Pres-
ton] alleges that the punciple of this bill is " to
pi event the interference of cei tain Tederal ofliceis
in elections," and that the report of the commit
tee ought to have lecommendcd a bill to enforce
that principle Sn , all this sophistry to blind the
people to the real character of the bill can be of
no avail The punciple of the bill is to detei
certain public officeis from speaking, wilting, 01
publishing their sentiments on any subject hav-
ing a beaiing upon elections, under the penalty
of $500 fine, and perpetual disability to hold any
place or station under this Government The
character of the bill is that of an invidious, odious,
unconstitutional piohibition of thousands of the
fieemen of this nation from the exercise of those
rights which belong to all oui citizens The bill
is a direct attack upon the free and independent
exeicise of the elective fianclnse
The Senator íepeats a tute íemaik, that the
young man who is not a Demociat is a fool, and
that the old man who is a Democrat is a knave
Well, sir, the honoiable Scnatoris neither young^
noi old What, then, is he in politics ? I should
like to heai him define his position
Sn, the Senator ftom Kentucky closed his re-
malles by an appeal to the patriotism and pride
of this body     lie implored us to sanction this
bill, that it might stand among the recorded hon
ors of the Senate, as a monument to Us wisdom
and vntue, m all time to come     He desired that
this Hall might become the honoied place where
this great sacrifice should be made     Mr  Piesi
dent, this Senate 13 composed of the embassadors
of the several States, specially sent hue- as the
guardians of their leserved rights and sovereignty
j If they were to sanction this bill, they would be
' faithless to their trust, they would authoiize the
| infiaction of the exclusive powers of the States,
the libei ties of the people, and the independence
I of the citizen     They would, indeed, render this
I Hall the dishonored place, where that monstrous
' saciifice would be made     And the extinction of
individual fieedom, the obliteration of the traces
of State so\ereignty, and the humiliation of the
chaiacter of this Senate, would constitute a mon
ument of its contempt for the Constitution of its
country, and of its degrading subserviency to the
domineering will of a party minority, in all ages
to come.          ______________________
INTERFERENCE IV ELECTIONS
SPEECH OF HON. W. H. ROANE,
OF VIRGINIA,
In the Senate, rebiuary 15, 1S39,
On the bill to present the interference of certain Federal
officers with elections.
Mr ROANE said
Mr Prfsidest I desire to address the Senate
this evening I have purposely left my own seat,
come round to this side of the Chamber, and oc-
cupied the vacant chau of the Senatoi from Mis-
sissippi, [Mi WiLKLr,] now absent, in oidei to
beneai my fiiendfioniMichigan, [Mr Norvell,]
whom I wished to pvsuadc to yield to me his just
title to the floor    He had, on one or two previ-
ous occasions, yielded it to others, and but for
peculiar circumstances, I would not have now
appealed to his liberality. I most sincerely thank
him for generously yielding to the peculiar con-
siderations I have presented to him    I am aware,
sir, that at this late hour of the evening------[Here
propositions were made to adjourn, if Mr Roané
desired it ] He said no, he hoped that the Sen-
ate would not adjourn, but would peimit him to
pioceed this evening Yes, sir, this 15ift day of
rebructry, of all the days m the year, is that on
which I desire to be heard This day emanci-
pates me from those considerations of delicacy
which, foi some time past, have restrained me
fiom saying what I now consider myself free to
say, however painful it may be to say it.
Mi President, a stern sense of that duty which
I owe to myself, to those who sent me here, and
to those with whom I am here associated in po-
litical feelings and punciples so congenial to my
own, will not permit me longer to maintain that
silence which, at all times, I so anxiously desire
to observe in this august assembly My situa-
tion here has been, for a long time past, one of
pain and delicacy of pain, because, on the great
momentous questions of national policy which
have been agitated in this Chamber from the first
moment I took my seat in it, I have been con-
strained", by every dictate of my judgment, every
feeling of my heart, and every consideration of
patriotism to differ totally from my colleague,
with whom I had so fondly and sangumely, and,
I think, justly expected to coopeiate on all na-
tional, political, and paity questions Finding,
to my pam and sorrow, that such cooperation has
not existed, I have heretofore, for reasons which
will be obvious to the Senate, to the country,
and to my colleague, contented myself with giv-
ing a silent vote Tnose reasons no longer exist.
That delicacy, giowing out of the peculiar rela-
tion which my colleague has for some time past
boine towaids our mutual constituents, has been
this day removed by the action of the General
Assembly of Virginia, and I feel that malignity
itself cannot now chaige me with an effort to m-
teimeddle in that íelation
Besides, sit, my colleague has but very recently
fi llij " defined his position " The couise which
he has recently hastened to take, the time which he
has selected, and the zeal, to say nothing of the
temper, which he has manifested in defining his
position, would render a longer silence on my part
obnoxious to the suspicion that I assented to hia
views, or was incompetent or afiaid to utter a dis-
sent Sir, I differ fiom him as wide as the poles,
and, in expiessing that dissent, I take leave, m
his own stiong language, to say that J too am an
et unteinfied Senator of the untenlfied Common-
wealth of Virginia," and mean this evening, with
the blessing of God, to " define my position" in
ch traders which" he thatiuns may lead " There
shall be no doubt about it, no e</uit!ocaiion, no
mental i eservatwn, no non commií/a/ism, shall, with
my consent, clíseme it 1 define it, sir, not be-
cause I believe that a human being who knows
me well can doubt it, but because those w ho nevci
knew me, and those who ue to come afte me,
when adveitmg to this memoiable chapter in oui
national history, in which it has been my destiny
to bear a part, might, peiadventure, diaw im-
proper inferences fiom my total silence I do not
object, sn, to the time my colleague has selected
to define his position The Geneial Assembly of
Virginia, my immediate constituents, and whose
servant I am, are now in session, and watching
with a scrutinizing eye our deliberations in tins
Chamber To that Legislature—to a Whig Legis-
latuie, as it has been leputed to be—I boldly de-
fine my position
In these days, when novelty and change are
all the íage, 1 can have no hope thattht definition
/shall give can cany with it the pleasuie which
that given by my colleague will convey to those for
whom it was intended Of this 1 am certain, that
it will lack one of the best ingredients of e\eiy
,i pleasure—surprise I daie say that my position
< will be found to be the same plain, old fashioned,
and, I -would fain believe, straightforward one
which I have held from the fiist moment that I
enteied into the service of the people 1 have no
highland fling to throw off, no ground and lofly
tumbling with which to amuse, and no brilliant
