CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
FILLMORE, was referred to the Committee on
Roads and Canals, and ordered to be printed
Several bills from the Senate were read a first
and second time, and referí ed to appropriate com
mittees
The bill ceding to the State of Ohio the interest
of the United States to a certain road within that
State, was read a third time, and passed
A bill from the Senate to allow two cituens of
Georgia to import iron steamboats suitable to the
navigation of livers, having been twice read,
Mr ADAMS moved that the bill be reterred to
the Committee on Manufacture 
Mr DAWSON, that it be sent to the Committee
on Commerce
Mr GRAHAM, that it go to the Committee of
"Ways and Means
Mr ADAMS said that he was not peculiarly fa-
vorable to the interests which might be supposed lo
be injuied by the bill, but he considered it as vir-
tually an attack on the compromise which had been
agreed to respecting the tariff
Mr DAWSON said that a similar bill had come
from the Senate last year, and been lefened to Ihe
Committee on Manufactures, who had reported
against it, he apprehended a like result now, and
therefore moved the Committee on Commerce,
since the bill might appropriately be sent to eahei
Mr ADAMS rejoiced to hear the principle ad-
vocated by the gentleman fiom Georgia, that a bill
ought not be sent to a committee which w-u sup
posed to be adverse to its object He had himselt
been preaching that doctrine for these thiee years
past, but the more he pleached one way, the more
determined the Speakei had been in deciding the
other He hoped that when he objected to sending
a measure er a memorial to the Committee on Fo-
reign Affairs, because he knew that committee to
be opposed to that measure or to the object of the
memorial, the principle of the gentleman from
Georgia'  objection would be held in lemembrance
The bill was sent to the Committee on Manufao
tuies    The House then went mto Committee of
the Whole on the state of the Union, (Mr Case?
in the chan,) and resumed the c msideration of the
CIVIL LIST BILL
The House then resolved itself mto Committee
of the Whole, Mr CASEY m the Chair, and took
up the bill making appropnations for the civil and
diplomatic expenditures of the Government
The question pending was on in amendment sub-
mitted by Mr Bí.ll, to stnke out the appiupnauon
of $3,600 for clerk hire, under the act of 23d June,
1836
Mr CAMBRELENG sent to the Chair a com-
munication from the Treasury Depaitment, show-
ing the necessity for the continuance of those
clerks, which communication was read by eth
Clerk
Mr McKAY called the attention of the gentle-
man from Tennessee to the fact, that even if this
item was struck out, theseclerks would be continued
under the act of 1836, because it was there pro-
vided that these cierks should be employed, and
that they should be paid out of any money m the
Treasury not otherwise appropriated He himself
thought there was not the sa ne necessity for these
clerks which there was before the suspension of
specie payments, but the law was that they were to
be continued, and until that was repealed, it was
useless to make this amendment
Alter a few remarks by Messrs BELL, and Mr
CAMBRELENG, Mr BELL withdiew his amend-
ment
Mr CAMBRELENG moved an amendment, to
apply the iund raised from sale of old to the pur-
chase of new furniture for the President's House ,
which was agieed to
Mr M MORRIS of Penns}hama moved an
amendment m the 423d line, so as to have " thirty"
to read twenty, reducing the item for contingent
expense  for missions abroad from thirty to twenty
thousand dollars He wished to submit a few
words, m the nature of a statement, relating to one
or two other parts ot the bill, and explanatory of
his object m making the motion
He said that, in consequence of being placed
upon the Committee on the Expenditures of the
Department of Slate, it became Ins duty to make
some inquiries upon the subject appertaining to
lho e expenditures One portion of his inquiry
related to the appropriations and contingent ex-
pendituies for a few years past, and he had received
a statement embracing the amount from the year
1829 to 1837, inclusive, of the appropriations for
incidental and contingent expenses of the Depart-
ment of State and for payments    It is as follows
Year*                  Appropnations               Payments
1829    -       -     $22,850    -       -   $24,691 44
1830    -       -       27,100    -       -    21,040 99
1831    -       -       20,000    -       -    90,213 93
1832    -       -       25,000    -       -    31,543 39

Making a difference in this length of time, in
the aggregate, between the appropriations and the
pa> nients, of a little more than five hundred dol-
lar . He undeistood that the amount of payments
made in a year does not necessanly show the
amount of the expéndame  of th it >eai, as theie
are accounts outstanding from year to year, and
sometimes for sewial years, which, when paid, aic
included in, th  amount foi the yeai in which the
payment is made
Auothei point of his inquiry was to ascertain
■what might be the danger or probability of mis-
applying or losing to ihe Governmen the excess of
this appropriation beyond the actual expenditure
To this question he had received the following
«plj
'That the balance so unexpended, except that
part of it which may be in the hands of disbursing
agents, remains in the Treasuiy, forming a pait ot
the balance lemiinmg therein at the end of the year,
and for the portion of it that may be in the hand 
of disbursing igents, (u th which they stand de-
bited on the books of the Treasury,) they hive to
render accounts and vouchers, approved by the
head of the Depaitment, to the accounting officers
ot theTri isury for examination, so that the ba-
lance remaining from one year to the next cannot
be misapplied >r lost to the Government, being
eithei in the Treasury or the hands of disbursing
agents, and can be applied only to tht object for
which it was originally appropriated "
In connection with this examination, his atten-
tion had been tliawn to the opinion expressed by
the Secretary of State to the President, m a letter
dated December 2, 1837 The Secretary w as asked
whether there was any necessity for lurther legis-
lation, to secure the faithful application of the pub-
lic mone)S to the objects to which Jthey were ap-
propriated, to prevent then misapplication or em-
be?elemenl, and to increase the security of the |
Government against losses in the disbursement
thereof He replied that, in hi  opinion, a stricter
accountability could not be attained by further le
gislation that the best security was to be derived
from the character of the officers to whom the mo-
neys were entrusted
In relation, then, to this item for the contingent
expenses of the Department of State, considering
how near a con espondenci there has been be-
tween the appropriations and the payments, and
that, according to the opinion of the Secretarv,
theie can be no misapplication or loss of the sur-
plus appropriation, and that it must depend upon
the fidehtj and character of the disbursing officers
and agents, he did not see sufficient reason to make
any motion, or to insist upon a reduction of it, from
that reported m the bill
He apprehended this the chief reliance for a pro-
per and economical u«e of the funds of the Go
vernment was to be had upon the honesty and
energy of the officer , in that particular, he agreed
in opinion with the Secretary of Slate There may
have been too much money expended for specific
purposes, the payments heretofore made may have
been extravagant, and some of the items of contin-
gent expense m the Departmem, mentioned in the
last report, he thought might have been dispensed
with, still he was not prepared to take exception to
them, they appeared lo be sanctioned by usage,
and if they were necessary, he would no* object to
the appropriation for the payment.   '' '   '  ,,-,
But, although he would agree to an^propfia-
tion adequate to the wants of the Governrherit, yet
that appropriation should be somewhat in propor-
tion to the previous expenditures, and hence he
made the motion to reduce the sum for missions
abioad from thirty to twenty thousand dollars
A reduction had been proposed by the commit-
tee reporting the bill, by the advice of the Scretary,
as he understood, frum thirty thousand to fifteen
thousand dollars, for contingent expenses of foreign,
inteicourse The expenses for that purpose have
heretofore exceeded that amount, but it is now
thought that the sum of fifieen thousand dollars will
be sufficient, so that, in that particular, a diminu-
tion is admitted to be proper by the committee
The contingent expenses foi the missions abroad
for the year 1836, according to the report of the
receipts and expenditures, was but $15,920 10.
On the 31st of December, 1836, there was a balance
of appropriation unexpended for that year of
#24,587 90, and for the year 1837, there was
another appropriation for this purpose of $30,000.
Out of this unexpended balance, and the additional
appropnation of $30,000, theie was expended for
and during the year 1837, a sum short of $25,000,
leaving a large amount in the Treasury He pro-
posed this reduction to $20,000, as a medium sum,
which, he appiehended, would be quite sufficient to
meet all the proper demands which would be made
for this purpose
He was aware that in a bill of this description,
proposing to appropriate between three and four
millions of dollars, containing about a hundred
and eighty items, with the power of prodigality and
extravagance which disbursing agents have, if they
choose to exercise it, in despite of limitation, it
seems to be a matter of small importance to at-
tempt to curtail but ten thousand dollars, but he
conceived it to be pioper to do so to any amount,
however small, unless it appeared reasonably clear
that the larger sum would be wanted for service.
As an advocate for a limited and economical ex-
penditure of the public money, and considering that
the members of the House were but the agents and
trustees of those who send them here, he held it to
be their duty to lake care of the small appropria-
tions Although he was not disposed at piesent to
enter into the question of retienchment and reform,
for general purpose , nevertheless he maintained
that m small matters, as well as greater, it was the
duty of Congress to guard the finances of the
country, and to remember that the rights of control
over the public treasure -were only commensurate
with the wants and necessities of the public service.
He had nothing further to add, but lo submit his
amendment to reduce the contingent expenses for
missions abroad from thirty to twenty thousand
dollars, which he did with a strong conviction of its
propriety
Mr CAMBRELENG explained that he had
made application to the department m relation to
this appropriation, and has ascertained that there was
a balance of only $18,000 on hand on the 1st of
Jinuary, 1838, and $15,000 of that sum would be
needed for the expenditure of the year 1837, not
yet paid In consequence of this, he thought this
appropriation could not be reduced with safety
The amendment was then disagreed to
Mr CAMBRELENG moved an additional item
of $20,000 for the expenses of the Supreme and
district courts of the United States
Mr C explained the object of this amendment
to be to defray the additional expenses, which
would be mcreosed on account of prosecutions in-
stituted in those courts on the frontiers, and sent to
the table a, communication on the subject
The amendment was then agreed to
Mr CAMBRELENG moved an additional
item of $2 000 to renew the roof on the branch
Mint at Charlotte, North Carolina , which was
agreed to
Mr McKAY then moved to strike out the item
of $4,000 foi salaries of Cousuls of the United
States at London and Pans
Mr McK explained that he made this motion,
because he considered that, by the rule which the
House had adopted, this item was not properly mtro-
