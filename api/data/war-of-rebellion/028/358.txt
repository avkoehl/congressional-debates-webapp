HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,September 25, 1862-10 a.m. (Received 3 p.m.)

Major-General HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

My scouts, which have been out yesterday and this morning, report the enemy in force behind Shepherdstown, and every person who comes across the Potomac gives the same account of the position of the rebels in large force upon the Opequon Creek, some 3 mils above its mouth. A young man who arrived here this morning from Winchester states that there were but few troops in the vicinity of that place on Monday. The young man saw no troops moving to or from Winchester. I am keeping out my scouts in every direction.

Major-General.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

In view of operating from Harper's Ferry, or from any point thins side, I would prefer that Sigel's corps should move to a point on the Frederick and Knoxville turnpike, to encamp as near Knoxville as the ground will permit. This is the first good camping place below Harper's Ferry, and the troops can be supplied by rail. The pontoon bridge is laid at Harper's Ferry.

Nothing new since my dispatch of this morning, except that the wife of a Confederate officer, who arrived in Sharpsburg to-day from Virginia, told her father-a Union man-that the entire rebel army which was left from the battle of the 17th instant was still opposite us, awaiting re-enforcements from Gordonsville; that the rebels expected to give us another battle between here and Winchester, and were anxious for us to cross their river.
