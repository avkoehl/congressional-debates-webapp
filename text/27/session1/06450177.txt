to this time.    Fiefore me establishment of He first
Bank ot the United fetate , the revenues of the Go-
vernment were pro aptly collec'ed and paid out in
gold and silver.    We had no difficulties at all to
contend with m relation to our fiscal operations.
But recently we have had a more substantial ex-
perience oí the benefits resulting  from  colleeung
and keeping our own money.   The administration
of Mr. Van Baren has established the fact that the
public revenues can  be collected and   disbursed
without the aid oi banks, State or National     Th s

came into power to the present day, and he trusted

somewhat irom me strict line of debate    Mr Van
Buren came into power on the 4th  March, 1837,

three mill   ns of public money in the Treasury".   Í

was estimated, how vei, that theie were forty three
millions oi  ¡luolic money somewhere, and during
the short session    í Congress, which  termina ed

gress passed appropiiatuns amounting 10 thirty-
seven rniluoas, *xceed,ng the estimates ot the De-

passed th * distribution bill.    The Solons of toat pe

that the banks should be allowed to p-sy the amounts

liberal credit. Fanner he recommended the issue
of the much-abused Treasury notes tn anticipation
of the future resources of the Government, and to
supply its immediate necessities. The^eTrea0!"
notes operated in favor of the banks leaving them
