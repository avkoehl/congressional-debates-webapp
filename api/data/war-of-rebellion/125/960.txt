My men on the Nashville and Clarksville Railroad and the Nashville, Decatur and Stevenson Railroad have worked under the orders of the general superintendent, and, having been very much scattered and employed on different kinds of work at various places, I am unable to give the results of their labor. The Construction Corps has cut about 500,000 cross-ties, the most of which they have put in the track; a considerable number, however, have been burned by the enemy. We have used the following amount of bridge timber on the roads specified:

Feet, B. M.

Chattanooga and Knoxville Railroad........................1,400,000

Chattanooga and Atlanta and branches......................1,800,000

This does not include the lumber in the permanent bridges which were built by contract. In addition to the above amount of bridge timber we had taken out and delivered along the line of the Chattanooga and Atlanta Railroad about 2,000,000 feet, B. M.,of bridge timber, a large portion of which was burned and destroyed by the enemy in his late attack on that railroad. A good many thousand cords of wood have been cut from time to time for use of the transportation department, and we have had to keep a considerable force of men all the time on repairs of track, and at this date we have about 1,500 men on the Chattanooga and Atlanta Railroad alone employed at this kind of work. It gives me great pleasure to bear testimony to the industry, faithfulness, and efficiency of my division and assistant engineers. They and the supervisors have worked day and night when necessary, and done everything in their power to make military railroads a success. I must mention particularly the services of Mr. Eicholtz and Mr. Smeed, division engineers, and Mr. McDonald assistant engineer on the Chattanooga of buildings, &amp;c., at Chattanooga.
