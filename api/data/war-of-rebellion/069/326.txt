HEADQUARTERS SECOND CORPS,May 30, 1864 - 9 a. m.

General WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Army of the Potomac:

The firing about 7 a. m. was from the enemy opening on my working parties. My guns replied very little. I am waiting to complete my epaulements and the rifle-pits for the infantry supports, when i shall open on their works. This is an advance work, and requires some protection for infantry in case it should be assaulted. The ground is open around, but could be assaulted if the enemy pleased. My rifle-pits will be completed very soon. Barlow is pushing his skirmishers along the Cold harbor road, and is somewhat engaged. Gibbon will do the same.

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General, Commanding.

I wish to develop positively the enemy's positions along that road. They have a strong line of skirmishers.

MAY 30, 1864 - 9.25 a. m.

General WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Army of the Potomac:

I have not yet positively determined the enemy's position in front of Barlow's left and Gibbon. The enemy have been driven from their first heavy skirmish line behind detached rifle-pits, which we now occupy with a brigade of each division. There is now a ravine between the enemy's forces and ours, but I do not think it is the creek. I think the creek is still behind that point.

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND CORPS, May 30, 1864 - 9.40 a. m.

[General WILLIAMS:]

GENERAL: I send in a prisoner taken from a North Carolina regiment, Hoke's brigade, on the skirmish line of the enemy, on General Barlow's front, to our left of the Cold Harbor road. Their skirmish line is on this side of the swamp. He says their line of battle is on the other side of the swamp, probably a mile from where we first encountered the skirmish line. He says they came there Saturday night and commenced entrenching; he thinks they are pretty strong by this time. He thinks Lee's army is pretty generally up here. I send him back on horseback. The Sixth Corps have connected with our reconnaissance and are marching down. I have recommended General Burnside to cut a road through the swamp behind Warren's pickets, to connect with Warren in case if difficulty, which appears likely.

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,Major-General, Commanding.
