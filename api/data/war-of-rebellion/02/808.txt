HEADQUARTERS VIRGINIA FORCES,Richmond, Va., May 6, 1861.

Lieutenant Colonel D. A. LANGHORNE, Lynchburg, Va.:

COLONEL: In my letter to you of this date you were directed to muster the volunteer companies from the counties of Campbell, Bedford, Roanoke, Botetourt, and Craig distinct from the troops coming from the other counties named in my letter. The reason of this is, that Colonel P. St. G. Cocke had already been ordered to muster the troops from these five counties into the service of the State, and to send an officer to Lynchburg for that purpose, and they are designed to serve in his division. The order to Colonel Cocke to send an officer to Lynchburg to muster the troops from these counties will be considered as a part of the troops intended for Colonel Cocke's line, who will order them to some point on his line, after you notify him that they have been mustered into service.

Respectfully, &amp;c.,

R. E. LEE,

Major-General, Commanding.

Lieutenant Colonel JOHN ECHOLS, Union, Monroe County, Va.:

COLONEL: Under the authority of the governor of Virginia, by his proclamation of the 3rd instant, you are hereby authorized to call out and muster into the service of the State volunteer companies from the counties of Pendleton, Augusta, Pocahontas, Monroe, Highland, Bath, Rockbridge, Greenbrier, and Alleghany, to rendezvous at Staunton, in Augusta County. The whole number of companies thus called into service will no exceed two regiments of infantry and riflemen. You will organize them into regiments, associating together, as far as possible, troops from the same region. Place them under such officers as are available, until their proper field officers can be appointed by the governor. It is hoped that you will be able rapidly to organize the whole force, and you are requested to report as soon as possible the number of companies mustered into the service of the State, their arms, condition, &c.

I am, respectfully, &c.,

R. E. LEE,

Major-General, Commanding.
