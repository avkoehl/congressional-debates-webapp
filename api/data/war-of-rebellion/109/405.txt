Your message him my aide is received. All my men are with you. Hughes, I hear, is marching to this place; may be here in an hour. Can you get cars for all the force? Agent at Saymour telegraphs me he would send 150 cars in half an hour. Did your order them?

Morgan has been at Osgood and carried off the operator. I have sent to Seymour for a train for my command to run down there, but I am not strong enough to fight him alone. Have some help for me as I pass here. Come along and take command. We can catch him.
