JiemmtrurMm.—Mr. Harris.
. He, OF Ijteg,
spoke; and of every thing connected therewith save
the character of the President, it would, ns he
said afterward," seem strange" that "hedid not
say that he was in favor of anything, in it,"«spe- .
cially ashe andhis radical friends claio) that it was
original with liira, and as but for such expres-
sions and known devotion thereto lie, would prob-
ably netfer have received that or a presidential
nomination. And yet, to those well acquainted
with the assumed author, or .who have read the
speeches to which I have adverted, would not so.
seem. While the President, in his speech at
Chicago, advised tViat quibbling about one man
or race being inferior to another, and should there-
fore be put in an inferior position, should'be dis-
carded, and that we should unite as one people
throughout the land to discard the standard we
have left us, and all these things, until we once
more stand up declaring that all are equal. In
that at Charleston he disclaimed being, or ever
having been, in favor of affecting in any way the
social and political equality of the white and black
races, or of making voters or jurors of the latter,
or qualifying them to hold office, or intermarry
with white people; and declared that there was a
physical difference between such races that he
believed would forever forbid the two races living
together on terms of social and political equality;
anu that as .they could not so live, and as long
as they did together,'he was as much as any other
man in favor of having .the superior position as-
signed to the white race.
He in such canvass,did,in the northern section
of the State, say that he hated slavery'and in-
sisted on its abolishment, while in other sections
of it he would proclaim that " each State had the
right to doexactly asitpleased aboutalltheir do-
mestic relations', including that of slavery," and
after admitting himself bound by constitutional ob-
ligations to allow the people of each of the States,
without interference direct or indirect, to do ex-
actly as they pleased, and denying that he had
any impatience with such rights or inclination to
interfere with them if there was no such constitu-
tional provision; thus in one portion of the State
not'only denying any impatience.with the insti-
tution of slavery, but any desire in any way to
interfere with it even were it without constitu-
tional sanctiori, thereby expiessing more indiffer-
ence to its existenqe; than to have said he did not
care whether slavery was voted up or voted down,
for the saying of which Judge Douglas was by the
political adherents of the Administration traduced
as a tyrant, monster, and being unworthy the name
of an American citizen; and in another section
of the State advising the abolition of the institu-
tion. And because of many such contradictory
and astounding statements, before and previous to
his first nomination as a candidate for President,
made, and probably as often through design, at-
tempted to be reconciled with conservatism, or
qualified and explained for an emergency without
in the least affecting his social or political rela-
tions with the most radical of the Abolitionists,
to whom he became known, and a favorite can-
didate for the Presidency, in consequence of de-
votion to their heresies,and supposed availability
on account of his remarkable faculty for success-
fully disguising them when expedient, and of his
having received unprecedented majorities in each
of the twelve States that had so nullified laws
passed under such constitutional provision, and
some of them the provision directly, and in every
other northern State, New Jersey excepted, while
he had no electoral vote in any slave State. Did
time admit, I would state fully the bill and com-
ment upon every provision thereof; but as it will
not, nor of any satisfactory elaboration of any of
those to which I Shall, I will speak of the great
and vital political principles involved in and vio-
lated by it, and not in detail of its enormities, as
any one of its provisions characterizesall.
It provides, among other things, for the appoint-
ment by the President, with the advice and con-
sent of the Senate, of a provisional Governor for
each of the States in rebellion; who is, until.the
United States shall have recognized a republican
form of State government, to see that this act, the
laws of the United States, and those of the State
in force when, as it says, the State government
was overthrown by the rebellion, are faithfully
executed in the State, except that no law or usage
whereby any one was held in involuntary servi-
tude should be recognized or enforced by any
court or officer in such State,and that.the.Qresident
shall p.ppoi,nt such officers provided for by the
lstws of the State, when, as it is said, ^ govern-
ment was overthrown, as he may find necessary
to the civil administration of the State.
'I'llat all persons declared free by any proclar
mation of,the President,and their posterity,shall
be forever free, and if restrained ofliberty under
pretense ,of claim to their, service or labor, the
courts of the United States shall, on habeas corpus,
discharge them. That so soon as the military
resistance to the United States shall have been
suppressed in any State, and the people thereof
shall have sufficiently returned to their obedience
to the Constitution and laws of the United States,
the Governor shall cause, as speedily as may be,
an enrollment to be taken preparatory to the elec-
tion of delegates to a constitutional convention.
That the convention shall declare on behalf of the
people of the State their submission to the Con-
stitution and lows of the United States, and adopt
and incorporate into the constitution of the State
three provisions in the act stated and thereby
prescribed by the United States, in the execution
of the constitutional duty to guaranty a repub-
lican form of government to every State, and
thatwhen it^hall have adopted such provisions it
shall proceed to reestablish a republican form of
government and ordain a constitution containing
them, one of which is that involuntary servitude
is forever prohibited, and that freedom.andequal-
ity of civil rights before the law is guarantied to
all persons in the State; and that if it shall refuse
to establish the State government on such condi-
tions the Governor shall declare it dissolved. But
that it shall be the duty of the President, when-
ever he shall have reason to believe that a suffi-
cient number of the people of the State entitled
to vote under the act prescribed, and not less than
a majority of those enrolled, as required by .the
bill, are willing to reestablish a State government
on such conditions, to direct the Governor to order
another election of delegates to a convention, for
the purpose and in the manner prescribed in the
act, and proceed in all respects astherein provided
tq dissolve the convention orcertify the State gov-
ernment reestablished by it to the President.
The powers of this body, though of more ex-
tensive operation than those of Representative
Houses of the States, are in their nature and
quality much inferior, being conferred by delega-
tion over special and expressly specified though
general matters, enumerated in the Constitution,
which so clearly defines and limits them as to ex-
clude. any whatever not so specified, and are,
therefore, permissive; while those of such bodies
of the States are inherent and consequently not
prescribed, and though limited by constitutional
prohibitions, are supreme,over all matters not
so prohibited. The question that the introduc-
tion of a bill here should first present for our con-
sideration is, are its provisions within the powers
so enumerated? and not whether they are prohib-
ited by the Constitution; and if not, we should,
without regard to what they are, oppose the pas-
sage of such a bill, and especially if it professes
to guaranty to States republican forms of govern-
ment, when they have such, and while its provis-
ions, if enforced, would cement such governments
into monarchical ones, and would, though such
provisions were in themselves, and unconnected
with the relations of the States to theUnited States,
as republican and perfect as those of this bill are
infamous and intolerably usurping, for ihe reason
thatany alteration made in such governments,or
restriction imposed upon their reserved rights by
any-other administration than their own, is not
only despotic but a usurpation, against which
the United States, under the provision of the
Constitution on which it is claimed this bill is
framed, is bound 10 protect each State, though
perpetrated by Congress and the Executive, or
either, or any power, because each of such States
is.a commonwealth, and the people of each there-
of have the normal and exclusive prerogative
expressly admitted, I will not say conferred, by
the Constitution of the United States, ns they
were never delegated by the States to the United
States, of retaining or altering their respective
governments, however immoral, sinful, degrad-
ing, or obnoxious such governments may be, or
might be made.by such alteration, in the estima-
tion of the people, or the administration of each
other State of the. Union, or of that of tbe fetter, if
they remain.republican, never having surrendered
the power to politically. (Jft with regard ,tberetp
and to all other of their reserved rights, which

Union, longer tlian they retain such prerogative,
the exercise of .which, by, any other power than
that of their respective' adrninistrations is syb-
versive of such governments, and consequent-
ly a usurpation of such prerogative. EachState
having republican forms of government, if they
ever had, n,i[ie of them having each a government
established by the people thereof, formed that of
wliifh we are the Representatives, Virginia,
Georgia, and South Carolina, included in. this
bill, being threejt,hereof,and four more having be-
come members .of th? .Union, by signing and
ratifying the Consti.tju.tion, and in.accordance with
its provisions, of which North Carolina, so in-
cluded .in this bill, is ope. And the remainder
of them, by admission under a clause of itauthor-
ijing Congress to adijait others, the governments
of which are republican in form, is evidence .so
conclusive that, they had, that to (sontrovei? it, ja

It is unnecessary for the proper consideration
of this bjl(,.further to investigate its provisions
than to ascertain whether it proposes to alter any
such governments, which is an ,atternpt to over-
throw them, or which, if possible, with any ad-
ministration of this Government, the Government
could no more survive than could man the act of
suicide. That it does not will not be denied,by
any, having regard for their reputation, who bay-9
examined it; and although it does, can any wis®
favor its passage.consistently disclaim the power
of Congress so to legislate for any other State of
the Union withput first establishing superior ain}

Constitution of the United States or forfeiture of

Yet il.s advocates, knowing that this Union was
organized on the principle of the equality of each
of t,he,States, and that such equality,is not only
tlie most sublime of their rights, but of the att-
ributes of our Government; and that in such subr
iimity pf rights and,attributes there is no inher*-
ent conflict; and that the masses of the peopljB
whose minds are unperverted by the fanaticisna
inculcated by most of the leaders of this Adtpinr
istrat|on, who alone hold and teach otherwise,
and that,clandestinely so believe they neither as-
sume such superiority nor claim such forfeiture
of rights of any of the States; nor witho.ut .sslf-
stultification .could they, as in the bill they.are re-
garded as States. Such equality is proclaimed by
the authority of each House of Congress when in
session through its respective flags unfilled to sig-
nalize our deliberations, on which the equality of
each of theStates is represented by a similar star,
as it is by national devices of peac,e and war, and
over all which in patriotic contemplation the
American eagle, with intense anxiety, has pye.r
hovered, and now lingers with awful and de-
sponding suspense; and as an admonitor of our
duty as prescribed by the Constitution, and a wit-
ness of our fidelity or recreancy thereto, wings
you, Mr. Speaker, to and from that stand to in
front of the images of Washington and La Payette
sanction the opening, continuing, and closing of
all our proceedings over which you preside.
The bill proposes to establish for each of such
States a provisional government, for the adminis-
tration of which there is to be but one officer, a
Governor, to be appointed by the President, with
the advice and consent of the Senate, unless ihj
President, in the exercise of a discretion conferred
on him, should appoint others; during which tha
people to be so governed are disfranchised so far
as regards not only the administration .of such
governments, but as to the time and manner of,
under the dictation of this bill, establishing ft.per-
manent, so-called State government; and as tq
the qualifications of those who are to cornpose the
; convention therefore and of. the voters bjr whom
