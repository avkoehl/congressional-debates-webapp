JACKSON, January 23, 1863.

Major-General LORING, Grenada:

Have Price's entire command and [T. N.] Waul's Legion in readiness to move here at a moment's notice. I shall order up transportation immediately, but no movement will be made until you receive further orders.

J. C. PEMBERTON.

JACKSON, January 23, 1863.

Major-General EARL VAN DORN:

You must not take the cavalry of Waul's Legion. They must be left, in addition to the 800 or 1,000 heretofore directed. I shall need them at Vicksburg most probably.

J. C. PEMBERTON.

RICHMOND, January 23, 1863.

Colonel W. M. WADLEY, Raleigh, N. C.:

General Pemberton telegraphs from Jackson, MISS., that if he cannot control the railroad in his department, the business of the department and subsistence of the troops will fail. He begs you may be sent there at once, and the Secretary of War concurs, and desires you to proceed at once to Mississippi.

S. COOPER.

Vicksburg, January 23, 1863.

Major THEO. Johnston, Commissary of Subsistence, Jackson, MISS.:

How many beeves on hand at Edwards Depot, and how many more will arrive from Rodney, and how soon?

T. B. REED.

OFFICE CHIEF OF SUBSISTENCE, SECOND DIST.,

DEPT. OF Mississippi AND EASTERN LOUISIANA,

Vicksburg, January 23, 1863.

Major JNO. J. REEVE, Assistant Adjutant-GENERAL:

I am informed by Mr. F. F. Kerr, who has charge of Government cattle at Edwards Depot for Mr. M. N. Yocum, Government contract butcher for the department, that the stock at that place is getting very low, and that unless the 7,000 head, which Major T. Johnston says are crossing at Rodney, arrive very soon, they will be out of beeves entirely. I fear, from what I learn in regard to the cattle reported crossing at Rodney, that the number to arrive at Edwards will not be sufficient for the demand, and would respectfully urge that means be adopted to secure as many beeves as possible from private sources.

Very respectfully,

T. B. REED,

Major and Commissary of Subsistence.

I have also received, in addition to above 2,296 pounds bulk pork, 1,487 pounds bacon, 2,295 pounds lard, 29,965 pounds flour, 104,293 pounds salt, and 90,000 pounds pork on foot.
