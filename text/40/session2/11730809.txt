the Government of the United States sinoe—the trans-
portation ut its troops anil munitions of war.
" State whether that service was rendered
voluntarily or was compulsory.
It was rendered voluntarily at the be-
ginning of the war; subsequently it was compulsory
ami \oluntarily. There was no discretion. When-
over an order came it was obeyed. They had a sys-
tem of impressment. The government appointed a
superintendent prior to my administration. The
requisitions for transportation wero issued by the
quartermasters, and it was sriven on these requi-
sition!'. In other words, the old Army rules were
adopted by the confederates.''
On page 115 we find the testimony of John R.
Branner, president of the East Tennessee and
Virginia railroad, from which I quote:
" Qiiextion. Under what authority was your road
operated during the rebellion ?
".-irt* rer. The rebels.
" (jtuttlon. In what way was their authority man-
ifested or made known to you?
"Annrrr. By an order trom the quartermaster gen-
eral. Mr. Myers, X think it was.
" Question. Did you consider the servioe rendered
by your road compulsory ?
"Anricer. Yes; made upon a positive order to us.
" Qnentxon. Was there at anytime opposition man-
ifested by the officers of the road to the then existing I
rebel government ?
"Ajwriccr. I cannotsaythat any outward opposition
i was manifested, because itwould have done no good.
'• They seized my road onee and took it from me, and
charged me with being disloyal and being a Union
man, and they hadanothermanto takecharge of it."
Such, upon a cursory view of the testimony
in this DocumentNo. 3, are the facts presented
by the different railroad presidents throughout
the South, as gathered in the late tour of the
Committee on Southern Railroads through that
section.
Now, sir, there is another point in connec-
tion with these land grants that I think it well
to present to the House, and that is the indebt-
edness of these roads to the Government of
the United States. I shall not anticipate the
report of the able chairman of the Commit-
tee on Southern Railroads [Mr. McClurq] in
reference to this point, but that report will be
. laid before the House before very long, and I
shall be sustained in what I now say, that
these roads are largely indebted to the United
States on their bonds given when their rolling
stock was handed over to them to enable them
to keep their roads in operation to the great
benefit of that section of country. As a matter
of economy, as a matter of wise legislation, is it
expedient for us to take away from these roads
by forfeiture these large land grants and leave
thetn more impoverished than they now are,
having been made so by the usages of war?
Had we not better leave them in possession
of these lands until a balance shall be struck
between the companies and the Government
of the United States? If they then fail to
meet their liabilities to the Government these
lands can with perfect justice be resumed by
the Government in payment of that indebted-
ness. The amount of this indebtedness to the
Government will be seen from the following
table, which is to be found on pages 89 and
90 of Document No. 3:
Statement of the Indebtedness of Railroad Companies for Purchases of Railway Material of the United States, under Executive Orders of
August 8 and October 14, 1865, showing the Appraised Value of Property Purchased, Amounts of Payments Made, and Total Balance due,

Quartermaster General's Office, November 26,1867.
I cite this table as proof of the assertion
I have made and as the basis of the argument
which I have advanced, that it would be unwise
and bad economy to impoverish these debtors
to the Government by forfeiting the lands held
by them.
Mr. PRUYN. Will my colleague yield to
me for an inquiry?
Mr. CHAisLER. Certainly.
Mr. PRUYN. I would inquire if the testi-
timony upon this subject taken by the commit-
tee is before the House now? Has it been
printed?
Mr. CHANLER. Taken by which com-
mittee?
Mr. PKUYN. By the Committee on Public
Lands;
Mr. CHANLER. I do not know anything
about the testimony taken by the Committee
on Public Lands.
Mr. PRUYN. It seems to me that in refer-
ence to so important a measure as this we
should have the report of the committee before
us in print; we should know upon what ground
the committee has proceeded in reporting this
bill. I hope this bill will be passed over until
such time as we can have full information upon
the subject.
Mr. CHANLER. Before taking my seat I
1 desire to call the attention of the House to
what appears to be the object of this bill. It
appears to be aucillary to the bill relating to
homesteads in the northern States, of which
the following is the first section :
That from and after the passage of this act all the
Eublic lands in the States of Alabama, Mississippi,
louisiana, Arkansas, and Florida shall be disposed
of according to the stipulations of the homestead law
of 20th May, 1862, entitled "An act to secure home-
steads to actual settlers on the public domain." and
tho act supplemental thereto, approved 21st March,
1864: Provided, That no distinction or discrimination
shall be made in the construction or execution of
this act on account of race or color.
Now, I have no objection to furnishing home-
steads to everybody who can pay for them;
but the policy of legislating land to the house-
