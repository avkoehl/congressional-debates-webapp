STEVENSON, August 26, 1863.

Major BOND,

Aide-de-Camp:

The rebels dismantled the mill and engine at Bridgeport. Colonel Hodges has sent for men to examine so that parts can be replaced. I will give general instructions to General Lytle to put it in condition otherwise.

P. H. SHERIDAN,

Major-General.

STEVENSON, August 26, 1863-8.20 p. m.

Brigadier General J. A. GARFIELD:

I send you the following telegram for what it is worth. It has just been received from Colonel E. M. McCook, at Larkinsville:

Major General P. H. SHERIDAN:

Deserter from First Louisiana Regiment, arrived to-night, states that he saw Cheatham's division cross at Chattanooga on the 7th of August, and that Cheatham's division was in Sequatchie Valley last Thursday when he left. I send the man to you tomorrow. Is this news?

E. M. McCOOK,

Colonel, Commanding.

P. H. SHERIDAN,

Major-General.

STEVENSON, August 26, 1863.

Brigadier-General LYTLE,

Bridgeport:

Do you know where the artillery firing is?

J. A. GARFIELD,

Brigadier-General, Chief of Staff.

BRIDGEPORT, August 26, 1863-9 a. m.

Brigadier General J. A. GARFIELD,

Chief of Staff:

The cannonading seems to be in direction of Shellmound. I threw some companies on to island before daylight this morning, just after General Rosecrans left. Lieutenant Turnbull, of my staff, reports no rebel pickets on opposite bank.

W. H. LYTLE,

Brigadier-General.

STEVENSON, August 26, 1863.

Brigadier-General LYTLE,

Bridgeport, Ala.

A bright light is seen on the hills across the river, opposite here. If you can see it from your camp, have the signal officers watch it. It is evidently a signal of some kind.

C. GODDARD,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
