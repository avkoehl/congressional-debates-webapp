THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
Febraarj 7,
aot then, for he did not suppose anything had
occurred since to change <\ en judgment,and how-
ever contrary it might be to his own convictions
of what ought to be done, he yielded as it became
him to do, wi'h proper deference, to what seemed
to be the judgment of this llouie Many gentle-
men still thought that further delay ought to be
allowed, and havirg every disposition to do all in
his power to produce the most happy result, and
being, with the gentleman fiom New York, [Mr
Cambrelevg,] desnous to elicit a unanimous
vote on this subject, he would, before he sat down,
mou that the íesolution beso referred to the com-
mittee that they should íeport on 01 before Mon-
day week next This proposition, he thought,
would answer the views of all of those who
thought furthei delay necessary, and he did not
think the House should postpone it beyond that
time, and it not pi esented to the House by that
day, there would not be time to deliberate, but
that day would still leave time for a patient, tem
perate, and judicious judgment upon it Whether
it should be necessary foi tne committee to recom
mend any legislative action or not, or what should
be the particulai tone of the report or the íesolu-
tions, depended on thecommutee, for the proposi-
tion of the gentleman from«Massachuseits left the
subject perfectly open to the cofnmittee Having
indicated his own opinions, Mi P had not the
«lightest disposition tc interfeie in any way what-
ever with the judgment of the committee Ail he
asked was that they should lepoi t, and he thought
the diy he had mentioned was the latest period
they should be u'lowcd Mi P concluded by
moving to modily the mo on of Mr AniMs.soas
to make it read lha  the committee should íeport
on Monday week
Mi .TOHNQ, ADAMSaccepted the modifica-
tion
Mr ED WAR.D EVCP.C FT observed that th s
did not appear to him to be a question of so much
impoitance as seemed to have been given it in
the present discussion Whether the committee
should be instructed to report on Monday week or
Monday fortnight, or forthwith, could not, he con-
ceived, be a matter of great moment There are
but a little more than thiee weeks remaining of the
Bession. What has fallen from the chai man of
the committee wnl, of course, be íegaided by the
House as an assurance that the committee will
report befoie the close of the session Such is my
own understn.idmg (,aid Mi C ) of the purpose
of the committee i hat iepoit cannot well be
delayed many days beyond the time now fixed in
the lesomtion as modified, and wheihet the iepoit
camea fewdays earici 01 later, cannot be, 1 should
think, of gieat consequence While, therefoie, 1
am willing to concur in the pas age of the íesolu |
tion of my distinguished colleague, 1 should also I
have voted foi it as first moved by mm I should
have been willing that the oumittee should be
mstiucted to report fnlhuttk 1 have been in
favor of the committee.'  reporting fntvuth, fiom
the beginning of the session I thought it very
impoitant—highly desuable—to d > so So much
time has since elapsed, and thed (Terence between
repoitirg forthwith and reporting at as late per od
as it can well be dore, is so inconsiderable, that I
attach less consequence to it than I did At the
commencement of the sessio", I thought an imme-
diate renor' from the commmee would have done
great good 1 diffei, on this pom , from the ger-
tleman fiom 3New York, [Mr Ca ibrdli nc,] at
the head of the Committee on foreign All ma I
think it would have been much better if we had
repoited long ago, if xa iiud tak-n a ground like
that assumed unai imously by the Senate of the
United States, and which 1 understand the gentle-
man from New Yoik to censure------
Mr CAMBRILrNG explained He said it
would !ia\e been propei to have had prompt and
bold action at the com->i°ncement of the session
Mi EVEItC ÍT continued i was for acting as
promptly i "id boluly as the gentleman It was
precisely a [ rompt and bold course which I de-
sired 1 was not for war, mrf< i repnsals,m the
state of affurs then existing, and we are now told
that neither of these measuies was contemplated
by any member of the House What, then, could
we have done promptly at d boldly' We could i
have ¿one thib    W  could have taken  up  the I
subject as one of imminent impoitance, admitting
no delay in the consideration of the House We
could have shown the justice of the American
side of the question in the strongest terms We
could have utteied the feelings and views of this
House in the strongest and most emphatic lan-
guage. Having shown the justice of ou claims,
we could have expressed our resolute determina-
tion to stand upon our rights under the treaty,
our firm purpose not to relax one tittle, nor recede
one inch,and we could have adduced the reasons
—and such reasons there were—which might be
urged in supportof the opimonthat France would
yet do us justice I Woul 1 have had a íeport of
this character, bold, firm, and pacific, and would
have hoped for it the unanimous concurrence of
the House And heie, sir, 1 should have been
inclined to stop I would have had the rights of
the country maintained, and our purpose never to
recede from them asserted But what Congress
would do in the contingency—somewhat distant
of necessity—never pel heps to arrive—1 think I
should not then hive said I would reseive my
action on the contingency till it ceased to be one,
and when that should be the case, then I would
act promptly and Vigorously, under the state of
circumstances which should piesent itself But
1 should have been indisposed to anticipate that
event, and would not, the efoie, undertake to say
what measures 1 would adopt, should it happen
But I would have asserted our lights so broadly
and distinctly, as to leave me at full liberty to
adopt any meaiune of redtess, which circumstan-
ces, unfoilunately, might lender necessary The
same couise 1 would pursue now, though from
the lapse of time, 1 do not think all the good would
lesult (ram it which ought have been hoped from
the earl er action of the committee 1 agree with
the chanman of the committee as to the character
whichthe íeport mubttuke He says the commit-
tee are not piepa ed to recommend any measure
1 so undeistand it Ii the present state of our
information, nothing of the kind alluded to, under
the name of a > letmn-e, can be recommended And
for this reason 1 would still refiain fiom recom
mending any tmng hypothetically to bedoneupon
the happening of a contingency, because the vane-
ties of circumstances, the shades of human action,
public ao well as ptivate,are infinitely too numer-
ous to be foreseen
I own, sir, my anticipations are not so cheerful
as they weie 1 entei tamed a strong hope, at the
commencement of the session, of the speedy ad-
justment of this painful controversy In the in-
terval little, I muuown, hasoccuned tostrergthen,
and more than I could wish, to discourage that
hope, 1 begin to contemplate, as a possible event,
that things will go to extremes But 1 am not
ieady,and I think tne Hou3e, though it may share
this apprehension, cannot be íeady to act on this
anticipation Evenif the*FienchChambei should
refuse again to mike an appropriation to execute
the treaty, we cannot be suie that it may not be
in form and with qualifications that will justify us
in furthei delay We cannot know this, as we
cannot know that the very reverse may not, by
some deplorable fatality, happen If, foi instance,
the suggest on of the gentleman fiom Ohio [Mr
Lytle] should he realized—if the French Gov-
ernment should accompany the refusal by acts of
affront and violence-—by a hostile attempt on the
squadron of the United Stiles in the Mediteira-
nean, an attempt wnich, every one knows, would
beiesisted to the last drop of blood of officers and
men—then, su, there would Le no delay, there
would be no need of instructing the committee to
iepoit for hwitl , theie would be no longdebates
in this House or the oth-r House, but the two
Houses, and the country, using as one man, would
take the i posui n and sustain it But 1 would
not anticipate any such event as this I wou'd
not take any step whatever on the presumption
that Fiance, to che long; denial of jus'ice—to the
signal injustice—of which she has given us cause
already to comphiB, ecu'd add a procedure of
such outrageous madness 1 will not say such a
thing is beyond the -ange of possioility, nothing
is impossible, but no gentleman, 1 think, on re-
flectior, can considei it in any degree probable
I have said a'ready, sir,that my anticipations of
the satisfactory adjustment of the business are less
sanguine than they were There aie, however,
some reasons for hope that the Trench Chambers
wi 1 teach the appropriation this winter One of
the chief reasons is, that the Chamber of Depu-
ties, of last year contained some members, by no
means entitled to the compliment paid to them by
the gentleman from Kentucky, [Mr Johnson,]
of having understood the question thoroughly,
and rot having rejected the appiopnation through
ignorance On the contrary, sir, there was ex
hibited, in my opinion, an entire ignorance of
some of the most important facts of the case, and
in reference to the most impoyant of them all, a
g-oss, not to say a discreditable ignorance, which
1 believe proved fatal to the passage of the appro-
pnation bill,and which, snould the two countries
most unhappily be brought into collision, will
throw a tiemendous responsibility on those mem-
bers You aie aware, sir, that on all sides it was
admitted that something was due to the citizens
of the United States, and that it was merely on
a question of how much, that the great issue of
annulling or executing a tieaty was made to
depend In this stateof the controveisy,and just
as the question was about to be taken, members
arose in the French Chambers, and stated, that
of the five millions of indemnity, provided by the
treaty under discussion, two ni'hons, covering the
St Sebastian's case, had already been paid under
the Flonda tieaty between the United States and
Spam1 The assertion was immediately contra-
dic'ed by the Minister of Foreign Affairs, whose
exposition of the whole question was one of the
most rmsteily parliamentary effoits I have ever
seen His contradiction was direct and positive,
as to its purport, but if one mav judge from the
report of the debates, (very likely imperfect,) it
was less decided and authoritative in manner than
could have been desired At all events, I have
been told by an intelligent Amencan gentleman,
who was piesent on the ocasión, that thee state-
ments weie evidently fatal to the bill The ques-
tion was taken immediately after It was lost by
only eight votes We know, sir, that deliberative
bodies may be taken by surprise, by plausible
statements Were we ourselves about to appro-
priate five millions of dollars in payment of an
acknowledged debt, and should member after
member rise, with a treaty m their hands, main-
taining that two of the five millions had been
already paid, and íeid us passages of the docu-
ment to prove it, and if anything short of the
most positive contradiction, accompanied with
the most satisfactory explanation, weie given, it
would very likely prove fatal to the bill, certainly
so, if the House were almost equally divided
before For these reasons, as 1 said, I rely
somethirg on the fact that the bill was i ejected
last winter, not in a full understanding of the
facts, as the gentleman from Kentucky seemed
to think, but in an en'ue ignorance of the most
important of them all And when the memo ,
which has been mentioned in Mi Livingston's
despatches to day, shall have proved to the
French Chambei (as I presume it will do, fiom
thechaiactri of some of the documents, which,
dunng the recess of Congress, have been furnished
to the Fiench Government, at its request, by
ouis) that the statements I have, alluded to were
utteily destitute of foundation, that the St Sebas-
tian's cases were all i ejected by the commissioners
under the Flonda treaty, as not included" in its
provisions, and that they have been all admitted
by the commissioners now sitting under the
presert *reaty, as notoriously provided for by that
treaty, I trust it will not be without its effect
But I do not build with entire confidence on this,
or any otl er giound of encouragement 1 see
something ominous in the character and composi-
tion of the opposition to the King and his Ministry
] on th s question What did the King tell Mr
Livingston>   That he might rely upon his honor
I as a King, and his promise as a man, that the
treaty should be executed For myself, I place
the most unqualified dependence on this assurance.
I believe that, as far as his influence extends, it
will be strenuously exeited, that his constitutional
powers will be strained to the utmost to procure
tne execution of the treaty But what, sir, is the
melancholy truth as to ll e condition of the King's
Government?    I  would not in  wantonness, say
