WAR DEPARTMENT, July 8, 1864-11 p. m.

Major-General DIX,

New York:

Please report immediately what is doing in respect to sending State troops from New York. General Wallace reports the enemy about 20,000 strong moving by Urbana, about thirty miles from here, toward Washington. This is confirmed by General Howe, who is now in command at Harper's Ferry. General Halleck reports that he had no troops here fit for field service.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

NEW YORK, July 8, 1864. (Received 1. 10 p. m.)

Major-General HALLECK:

The Tenth Veteran Reserves leave for Washington in the 6 o'clock train this afternoon.

JOHN A. DIX,

Major-General.

WASHINGTON, July 89, 1864-1 p. m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT,

City Point, Va.:

If General Canby's troops arrive in time, I respectfully suggest that they be sent here without disembarking at Fort Monroe. Only one division of Hunter's army has passed Cumberland. His advance is at Cherry Run. Low water in the Ohio River is given as the cause of delay. Rodes' division is said to be with Breckinridge. No important change reported since my telegram of last evening.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.

CITY POINT, VA., July 9, 1864. (Received 7. 30 p. m.)

Major-General HALLECK,

Washington, D. C.:

If you think it necessary, order the Nineteenth Corps as it arrives at Fortress Monroe to Washington. About the 18th or 20th is the time I should like to have a large force here; but if the rebel force now north can be captured or destroyed I would willingly postpone aggressive operations to destroy them, and could send in addition to the Nineteenth Corps, the balance of the Sixth Corps.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
