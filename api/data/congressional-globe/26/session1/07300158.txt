pursue it with manly firmness The workshops of Europe

But the bill will suppress credit—suppress bloated credit'
What, mi, is credit! One would think it some new invention
to detraud the public, by ihe manner in which it is spoken ot
but it is co-existent with business, and wherever there is ot
ha* been business, there ciedit has always cxi-tcd, and ha 
been and will be abused to a greater or less extent 1 cannot
comprehend how commerce or iradc can bo tairicd on success
lully without ii' Abolish crtdit, and l«r what' Because the
lalse policy ol the xdministiation in I'vVV -.56 stimulated it to
excess' Because, like the freedom o! speech and of the press,
It mat he abused' I know ol no other period aeainst which
any general ami iust charge can be brought \V hit wool 1 he
the condition o I the country if men wire denied credit! No
thins more deplorable The young man born to no inheritance
now goes into the world with his chaiucici lor honesty and in
tegnfv, this is lus great and only resource, and by tht tanh
placed in this he commands the funds necessary to go forwaid
in business. And, Mr President, it is one ol th" glorious cha
racteristics of jour institutions that tins path is optn to his en
lerprise, and the way to wealth, as well as to honor an 1 I inie,
is clear of obstructions for the most obscure and humble indi
vidual Shall we deny to such the onl} chance they have of
success? Shall we trample onthem,and grind them to dust
with the iron lieelof power' No, sir, I will e-pou-c no such
anti Republican doctrines. I will vote for nolavvthat declare-
to the poor that they shall remain in hopele s povt rtv, .mil to the
rich that they alone shall haye the enjoy nientol proper!}
But speculation is to be put down I the ¡senator means by
speculation, unwse and hazardous traffic, it has alwajs ex
lsted, and always will exist, where enterpn-e exi- *, utile - he
can uproot the desire in the human mind for the uddtn acqui
ration oí wealth. He might as well undertake to stop the emo
none and passions ot the human heart The only nay to make
men prudent and sagacious in business—and it is very desira
ble they should be so—is to make them see far enough into the
future to avoid ruinous hazards, but the rash, who often have
a passion lor wealth, will indulge illusive hopes and make iu
inous bargains, unless the Senator can enlarge their under
standings and increase their saga- i>v
There is hut one process by which credit and speculation
can be suppressed, and that is, by denying the means and fact
hues of business, not to speculators alone, but to all, and that
is exactly what the argument of the Senator tends to    He pro-
poses to dimmish the circulation, declaring that there is an in
flauon, when we are crippled down by the scarcity ot m nty
He would dimmish to a yast extent the resources and ability of
lenders, when the public is id despair for want of circulation
He assumes that diminishing the curiency will dimmish wages
and the value of property, and so it may be, but the first great
and abiding result will be a diminution of bu-iness   His theory
abolishes credit, and leaves nothing but a reduced eurrei cy to
do business with, and no one can deny that a reduction of busi
ness must follow.   Is the country prepared tor this'   Do we
grow too fast?   Is our enterpnee too great1   Do  we lalor too
much? Have we too much to eat, drink, or v. ear1 Are our com
forts and enjoyments so multiplied that a sound policy requires
they should be curtailed!   What re^poiue will the people give
to these inquiries'   Let him who is wil'mgto be p-ereddown
first stand forth and proclaim it      Wages are to be dimim-hed
by cuitadme the demand for them, for that is the tffect of re
ducing business
The Senator, in his argument, seemed to forget that the eviJs.
of a contracting and contracted currency bear as oppressively
upon the public, and more so, than those of expansion Ihe
difference is this in expansion, the weight of loss falls on the
creditor portion—in contraction, upon the deb or portion but
in either case it is a grievous calamity He cannot reduce the
currency below what is necessarj, without even mjjc suffer
lug than arises from toon uch
The Senator from Mississippi [Mr W alker] goes for the
abolition of paper The quantity of specie in the country is
not supposed to exceed anout SjOUOOOOO the Pie-ident put it
at $^,000,000 Tn she argues would insure a great reduction
of wages and of the value of property, wh ch he insists will be
beneficial The Senator from Missouri [Mr Benton] ¡s a'so
for metal alone, and these gentlemen have bestov/ed the highest
encomiums upon the policy of the hard money countries The
latter is enchanted with the fact that the Hollanders have grown
rich and become great lenders ol money, while we aie borrow
ers, and I will solve for him this enigma upon his own pnnci
pies He imputes it to gold, and infers that we should be len
ders if we hada metallic currency oniy Who, Mr President,
are the lenders of Hollandl Those individuals who have
amassed millions who at one time owned most of this cuy, and
who can buy up empires with their boundless wealth, having
profited by a state of things which made the privileged few
rich, whilethe many are left poor—while the laborer, as I can
prove, gets but his Id and 4d a day This i- the last jjolicy
we desire, the last that would be in harmony with the genius ol
our people or in unison with their true interests It is diffusive
wealth that we desire, a general prosperity amonfo all, proper
ty scattered every where, attainable by all that deserve it, and
thus invigorating a successful business, in which all may par
ucipate, instead of amassing it in the pockets of a few We are
borrowers, be it so It is beaer, infinitely better, to borrow,
and thus diffuse capital to excite industry and enterprise, than
to amass it in heaps and become lenders to nations, with a na
lion of paupers at home
But, sir, I fear I have dwelt too long on these matters, and
will hasten to notice that for which 1 chiefly rose Much has
teen said of labor, and what is it7 I may bay, without offence,
it is a commodity bongnt and sold like merchandise in the mar
ket A man has his skill and service to sell to whomsoever
will bay them, and his anxious desire is to obtain the most libe
ral remuneration.   Th  Senator says the value of it is regu
lated by bank paper Not so, Mr President, not so, butchefly
by the amount in market, and the demand which exists for it
currency may,however, at times, have its influence If the
supply is great and the demand small, then wages are necessa
nlv low, but it the supply be small and demaud great, they are
hieh W hen business is flourishing, the demand is uigent, and
wages rise, when it isdepiessed, thedemand diminishes, and
wages fall Hence, too, m countries densely populated, the
suppl) is necessarily gieater, in proportion to the business, than
in countries thinly peopled Thus we see why wages in i
great country, new and full of resources, like ours, are in quick
demand, while in China, where theie is a vast surplus popula
Hon, the market is overstocked, and they are low Hence,
too, it is, that insuih conditions ot society «e always find ihe
greatest poverty, suffering, and degradation Bank paper
is obviously not thesole or cinel canst which fixes the value ol
wages

b", fir t, how much is necessary a^ a circulating medium that
we may know whethei theie is an excess and, second does pa
per necessarily create an expansion, or unnecessary enlarge
ment of ihe currency that we mavjudgewhether u ought tobe
abandoned These matters, which are assumed, aie precisely
what ought to be piored The Senators assume as evident
truth what is not apparent They affirm that paper becomes
redundant, excessive, inflated But they do not attempt to esta
blish the fact by any proof Since the first of January, 1833,
our circulation has not much exceeded one hundred millions, it
may, at some periods, have reached one hundred and twenty,
inclusive of metal and paper Is this excessive! Has it reached
a point above the urgent necessities of business for two years
past'' If it has, how much is enoughi Some days ago I put
this inquiry distinctly to the Senate, and it lemains, ana will re
main, unanswered If it can be prov ed that we have too much,
it is not difficult to ascertain, with sufficient exactness, what
amount is necessary I desire Senators to make known the pro
cess by which they arrive at their corclusions in so vitally an
important matter They seem to take it for granted that there
is no evil but expansion to fear, while nothing is more certain
than that too small a circulating medium woi ks out as great, if
not greater, injuries, than one too large
We have heaid much declamation about bloated credit,
gambling and speculation, but if the e^is ence of all these were
established at this moment by unquestionable proof, it would
have lit le tendency to establish the fact of excess ve circula
tion, for they have no necessary conrection buteach may exist
independent of the other
Will the Senat ir maintain the proposition that papi r cannot
and has not circulated without inflation or excessive credits m
trade gererally!   I go further, and ask him if excesa is any i
thing more than an occasional occurrence, growing out of mar   I
kets quickened into activity by evtnts rather casual than per   I
manent1   I-there any excess of paper in the usual course of |
bus ness from sound banks who redeem and are able to redeem
their paper at sight, dollar for dollar, in metali   It is not easy
to see how excess ever exists under such circumstances    I can
go to day into any bank in Boston er New York, and draw out
a dollar with the same amount of paper and that dollar is as
5rod, and willbuv as much, in France or Germany a  any dol
lar there     The paper   then, is clearly worth as much as the
silver foritbujsit     If the paper of ban's is niaintainpd at
this value, and so lrdeemed at all times it is not easy to com
prebend how it is infHted, or that more is in circulan n than is
needed foi use    1 he idea of inflation presupposes some un
soundness     All money, metallic as well as paper does and
wilt fluctuate in value and, if this be inflation, then gold and
silver is no more exempt trom it than piper    It is by no means
easy to data mine which fluctuates oftentimes—money or pro
perty    Cotton is forty dollars a bale to day, to morrow it is
thirty five,.and next day folly five, it does not follow that Ihe |
cotton alone has fluctuated, or that it has fluctuated at all, foi
gold and silver may be so abundant as to depress the value of
property, oi so scarce as to raise it    It is every day's occur   i
rence to find gold and silvei fluctuating in value, commanding
at one time a premium, and then none, nay, under some cir
cumstanc s,   falling below good paper    No matter what we
have for curiency, there will be fluctuations m its value greatly
affecting trade, a<a ciri ulating medium ofuniform amount can
not be mainta nedany more than you can limit business to an
exact amount
J lus all proves what seems not to be well understood, or
Senators would reaason differently—that there is but one way
to determine how much circulation is necessary    Kisimpos
sible to ascertain how much money may be necessary for each
member of the Senate for the current year, and it is equally |
impossible to anticipate the wants of the great public    The
question is left, therefore, to be settled by the laws of trade, as '
ail other matters of business    We learn how much flour and
corn are required annually by the demand for them    Just so
we learn how much money is require 1 to carry forward bust
ness, by the ability of men to buy it    So much is necessary, he
the amount great or small, and, in a growing country, it would
be just as wise to limit the amount of produce as the amount of
monetary capital    Surely nothing can be more absurd than to
at'empt to determine the amount, without refeience to the ex
jgenuesofthe country—to say that eighty millions, or any othti
aibinaiy amount, a enough There is no advantage to be
gained by lowering the value of piopeity, un'ess the same
amount of laboi, oi the same amount of piopeity, enables us
to obtain moie of the necessaries of life fins fact should
theielore, be first clearly established, lor the process is neceas ('

the measure of which would be the amount if rtduction ol
wagbsaud ol propeity, a  he would thus be able to pioduce so
much cheaper To make mytcll uiideistool, I will procec 1
with the same supposition that wage- and property are to te
reduced one half Then his theory is, that the cotton plai ter
for example would produce his crop at half the present chst
by the saving in labor and the cupport of it, and consequently
derive double profit That he would produic cheaper is ui
demably trup and if he should sell for the same price he now
does, and bring home specie, he would realize double profits,
provided his laboieis are supported wholly on the products
of the United States This, however, is not the course of trade
or of business But from whence would the profits come''
Not from foreign countries, foi no change is to occur there, but
from the pockets of eveiv consumer of foieign goods in this
country, for the change is wholly in the wages and produce of
our own country The idea is, that, if wages and ptoperty
sink together one half, the lelative positions of the laborer and
the owner of property are the same, for the laborer can pur
chase as much with one half the money, and the same amount
of properly will purchase as much labor as before But the
laborer will, at the end of any given period, have but half as
much money, and thesame amount of property will be woith
but half ao much, consequently, all the surplus gains of the
farmer mechanic, manufacturer, and laborei, will be but half
what they now are, in nominal amount If property in foreign
countries should descend in the same ratio, the most that could
be said ol oui tonilitton is that it is no worse, for it is obvious
lynobetter But if we descend while they remain stationary,
and a profit is thence gained to the exporter, nothing is plainer
than that such profit is drawn from the consumer of foreign
merchandise, as it will take twice asmuch of our labor or pro
ducts t&bu) it as is now reqtfiied If the theory establishes
the fact that the exporter is to reap double profits for cotton, it
establishe- bejord controversy, the fact also that that piofit
will be a tax upon every man that consumes a foreign aiticle,
and that it will be wholly drawn from then pockets
The "senator has led himself info an error by supposing that
forcfn (.reductions aie to come to us rhtaper, while our ex
pons are to keep up where they are He thinks the importer
sell  in a market u Hated by paper, and realizes an extraortli
nary pitfit Bu1 he mu t perceive that the low and depressed
stat ot the working classes in Europe is piool enough that no
ex es lie profit is obtained here upon goods—none th t can
beai essential rtduction and that while law cottun maintains
its pi ite, foreign diodsmust dl<5C, maintain theirs In the great
competition of trade, this idea of excessive profit to the mi
porter is fallacious, and ab the notion of a reduction is founded
on it, that is also fallacious
To follow out the case I have supposed The income of every
man, except the exporter, is to be reduced one half in the value
of wages and property, while all foreign merchandise will cost
the saine, which will obviously, in effect, double the price, as it
will take twice the amount ol labor, or twice the amount of the
products of labor, to pui chase it
I do not ascribe this p wer to the bill, but it is enough for
me that its friends do What response will the farmers, me-
chanics, manufacturers, and laborers make to such a flagitious
proposition' Can they be leconciled to such a measure of op
pression' one that extoris fiom them the fruits of theirjindut
try to profts-edly enrich Ihe plantel who now enjoys a prospe
nt/ unequalled in thi íest ot ihe country' No, sir, such plans
of sectional aggrandizement, and such a disregard of the inte
rests of the greatest and most powerful class of people in the
country.can only excite their disgust and indignation Thus,sir,I
have traced the benefits of this bill,if it have any as interpreted by
itsfnends, to the rich and powerful I have, if I mistake not,de
monstrated that they are tobe made richer by a tax upon their
less fortunate, but more industrious and more necessitous fel
lew citizens—a tax that they never can and never will sabmit
to, so long as their power can be felt through the ballot box.
But, sir, this is not all W rule we are thus to haveintolera
ble burdens loaded upon u-, to add to the we ght of our embar
rassments, and to increase out sufferings, and while the debtor
portion of the public are to be crushed and ground to dust be-
tween the upper and nether millstone of this process, the man
ofmoneyisnotonly to escape unharmed, but to have his pr.
