Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. I present a peti-
tion from a number of capitalists, stating that
they understand that a proposition is pending
before Congress to endow the Northern Pacific
Railroad Company and the eastern division of
the Union Pacific Railroad Company with a
Government subsidy of $16,000, $32,000, and
$48,000 per mile, according to the nature of
the territory; and they are further informed
that these companies have already had granted
to them forty sections, or twenty-five thousand
acres of land per mile, and that it is proposed
to give them the privilege of mortgaging the
road for an amount equal to the Government
subsidy; that in addition to the grant of lands
these subsidies, at the rate named, will, for both
roads, amount to the enormous aggregate of
$125,000,000, and veryprobably $130,000,000 ;
that the memorialists will undertake the con-
struction of either or both of these roads, with
the same land grafts, and with a Government
subsidy of $15,0p0 per mile for the entire line,
with the right ctf.mortgage-to the same amount;
thus making a saving to the Treasury of the
United States of $75j000,000; that they will
give bonds equal to the amount of the subsidy
for the completion of both roads in ten years,
the bonds fp be indorsed by capitalists repre-
senting $100,000,000, I offer this memorial
because one of the capitalists -who signs it is
a constituent of mine.
Mr. CONKLING. Who are thÂ«# memo-
rialists ?
Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Franklin Haven,
George B. Upton, John T. Coolidge,S. S.
Dana, Henry J. Gardner, George Baty Blake,
Glidden A. .Williams, Joseph Nickleson & Co.,
John J. Blair, and W. S. Williams. In offer-
ing this memorial I desire, however, to say
that I am opposed to the granting of any sub-
sides for railroads excepting where the faith
of the nation is pledged. I believe that the
present rate at which railroads are being built
across the continent by the aid of the Govern-
ment shows that they can be built at a suffi-
ciently rapid rate without that aid, and with it
that they are more likely to be well constructed
when they are not unreasonably hastened in
order to get the subsidy. But if we are to
grant subsidies, I am in favor of granting the
smallest amount. I move the relerenee of this
memorial to the Committee on the Pacific Rail-
road.
The motion was agreed to..
