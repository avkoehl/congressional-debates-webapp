that the Legtslatme has any such right, feel bound,
both, by conscience and their oath, to act according
to their best judgment for the interest of their
State and country, and do not m conscience be-
lieve that the Legislature of the State can nterpose
and take from them their responsibility to the
people, whom they regard as their real consti-
trents
The object intended to be effected by the prin-
ciple of instruction cannot, to any considerable
e/teut, he accomplished, its efficacy must be limit-
ed to tho-,e uh> recognise the docirme, and to
such ot that numbei a  ate honest enough to
conform to u in their own practice Many
aic sirong believers m it, so lar as legareis its
application to others, bit, when applied to thtm-
sel /ts, they find no ditbcultj m discovering some
subterfuge to avoid Us ioice As the consciences
of men aie very different, a principle which is
npplicible o.ily to the conscience must be a very
iw-ife and variable role ot action.
Ou-iht a body, who,* dt liberations are so impor-
ta u as the Si nntf of tho United States, to be liable
to be controlled m its action by a principle so un-
certain and unequal as this'
Let us suppose the ountry is divided into two
great political parties, one oí which holds this doc-
trine to the ex'ent we have explained it, and the
other totally deny it 4t a particular time, the lat-
ter <m a nwjuniy in the Senate, but a minority in
the States The Legislatures of some of the States,
rtptfsented lij Senators opposed to them, instruct
ihen Sciiatoi , who fttl, mcoiiM lrnee, bound not to
ill j h, .ucha s ate ot things, the paily which
ha-- bxome a minority, and is the case may be—a
'•mall minority in the Si ucs—still remains a ma-
je nly in the Senate, and can control the action of
(.'ongrc-s
But suppose the pjrty which recognises the prin-
ciple oi institution are in a imjonty m the Senate,
but, by >orat temporary change m public opinion,
they fall into a minority in the States Some of
the States instruct their Senators, who feel bound
to obey or resign, and m either case, the majority
Jn the Senate is destroyed. It wou Id, therefore, re-
mit, that one party cyitki not maintain a majority
in the Senate unless they were a majority m
the State , whilst the other party, tes scrupu-
lous, oi hiildinj; ditkrent pnnoiplis, although a mi-
nim y in the States, maj Mili continue, for jtars, a
m<ijoritv in the Senate—the most imp ant branch

This is not supposing «n t xticme t ast, b'H only

injustice and inequality allmust admi' It m,iy be
satdthala patty wbuh does not recognise the sound-
ness of the principle, will never attempt to instruct
Senators who m?y be opposed to them, and wlu in
they may Mtpposa respect the principle Cons's-
teiwy might tequtre this, but expeneace teaches us
otherwise, and proves that it has been, and will be
done The very case which has led to this eom-
muiiicatioti, a-, you must be await , is an instruc-
tion fiom a Legislature, a large majoitty ol whom
disavow the right, as we have already shown And
m anv Slate, where parties are nearly equal in
numners, as is the case now in Connecticut, inseasy
to «te, i hat by the obseiva-ce ot ihM punnple by
one, and the disregard and abuse of it by the other,
the latter miy secure the representation m the Se-
nate at all times If they acquire the maj< nty in
the Legislature, when the Senators are «saiiv-r
them, thev have nothing to do but to insfuct them
out, and fill their places wuhme'i of thi u own
pr ni iples, and 1!, the very next year, teev tall into
a minority in the Legislature, ihey will stilt retain
their powei in the Senate, as then Senator1-, 1/ in-
structed, will THlher obey or resign It is contra-
ry to th ir consciences to do either; but it is per
fectly cinsi lent with the conscience  of such a
party to attempt to use against oíheis a principie
which Ihey will not observe themselves, and which
the} deelve, to be odious Can any doctrine be just
which leads to such results? Can any principle be ;
sound which is liable to be used by those who deny
1 s authority to ovei throw the power o\ those who ,
rtftclüi Whether the votes of a State m the Se- |
nate, on any important measure, are to be given
according to the judgment of the Senators, or the
v H of the Legislature, must always depend on 'ne
fact of the Legislature being in session, and hav"
ing an opportunity to give instructions, circum"
stances altogether contingent and aceidentat. 0tte
objection to this "obey or resign" principle is, that
it annihilates the rights of the minority in a State 
who are as much a part of the constituency as the
majority, and makes the Senators the mere agents
or instruments of a temporary majority in the Le-
gislature. .
Whilst the doctrine of instruction is designed to
give greater effect to the public will, its tendency,
in piactice, will commonly be to impair it, by tak-
ing away the j csponsiJnlity oi the Senators The
true American doctrine is, to impose upon legisla-
tors, as upon all other functionaries, the; necessary
and proper limitations and restrictions on their
powei, by the constitutional or organic law, and to
subject them, within their prescribed sphere oi ac-
tion, to the highest degree of responsibility This
depends mainly on two principles first, to secure
publicity to their action, and thus subject them to
the scrutiny and censorship of public opinion and
the press, and secondly, by a suitable limitation ot
the term of the office, so that the representative
will at all times act under a consciousness that his
trust is soon to return to the constituent body, who
will not be likely to restore it to a faithless repre-
sen ative, who has once ¡ibused it. Thes* two
principles come only in aid of another, still more
important, which is, the right and the duty of the
constituent body to select representatives whose
principles correspond with their own, and whose
known personal and political integrity afford a
guaranty that tlity will honestly adhere to those
pnncipcs, and faithfullj carry out the popular
will It this important privilege of selecting for
repiesertativts men who«e principles are known
to be in conformity with those of the majority of
tlit ir constituents, and who possess a high charac-
ter lor integrity, is disreganled, the right of in-
struction will be of little avail in securing a faith-
ful representation of the principles and opinions of
the constituent body.
The trite doctrine of instruction results from
the theory of the Government, and we consider it
to be this That any direct and positive expression
of the opinion, will, or desire, of the Legislature
111 respect to the action of its Senators on any par-
tícula measure, is to be regarded as an instruc-
tion, as much as though a ptrticular prescribed
form ot words was used , and that in no case is a
legislative tnstiuction, whatever may be the form
01 language, to be regarded as absolutely m«n-
daionj The Legislature ot a Sta e has no right to
command its Senators to resign m any form If they
can dw it conditional!}, they can absolutely The
instruction should be considered not as mandatory,
but as advisoiy, and is entitled to th  greatest re-
spect !rom the Senators, who ought not to disre-
gaid it without the most weighty and substantial
reasons
Th U there are such reasons in the present case,
we have abundantly shown, as the General Assem-
bly not only acted without authority, but m the
face of an express cb elatmer ol the right to m-
sliuel, besides, it appeals to us evident, from the
pie.imbie to the resolution, that the majority must
have entirely misapprehended the principles and
provit'ons of the bill to which their resolution
lifers
We are sensible that the right of legislative in-
struction is generally respected by that portpon of
the cituens of the State, with whom we are politi-
cally associated, jet -we believe, that there are few
evtn oí this poitionofourconsutuents.now supposed
to be a minority, who hold instructions as abso-
lutely mandatory They regard this doctrine as a
piit ot their general creed, which recognises and
cherishes all the populai principles of our political
institutions. They respect the principle as an ele-
ment of popular rights, and as a means of givmg
efficacy to the popular «ill, within the prescribed
: limits of the Constitution. They desire the legiti-
mate and proper ««of the principle, not its flagrant
. and palpable abuse, to effect selfish party purposes
Í They believe that a Legislature, which disavows
the right of instruction, cannot honestly nor right-
fully exercise a power whitjh they declare ihey do
not possess Such a proceeding, we are persuaded,
they must regard, not only as without authority
but as derogatory to the Legislature—1 eing a pros-
titution of its h gh functions to the m serable pap-
pose of attempting to accomplish a selfish end by
dishonest means, and at the same time, calculated
to bring into con'empt a popular principle, which,
when fairly understood, and properly applied, they
sincerely respect.
It is evicfent, therefore, that to obey your instruc-
tions, gtven under the circumstances to which we
have referred, would be disregarding the sentiments
of one portion of our constituents and a direct
violation of the known principles of the other, now
supposed to be the majjrily, neither of which can
we consent to do, consistently with the respect which
wo feel for both
This, gentlemen, is a fruitful subject, on which
much more might be said, but we fear we have al-
ready exhausted your pauence, and will conclude
with the expression of our regret that we cannot
eomply with the wishes of the General Assembly,
consistently with our sense of duty to the people of
the State who have honored us wi*h the responsible
station we hold, and this regret is the more sincere,
as we have seen abundant evidence of the enlight-
ened and patriotic purposes of the present Legisla-
ture, the important results of whose wisdom, in-
telligence and firmness, we doubt not, -will be duly
appreciated, and not soon forgotten by our com-
mon constituents.
With sentiments of great respect,
We are, gentlemen, yours, &c

Mr. Nixes said he had intended to submit some
additional observations, but feared he should con-
sume too much of the time of the Senate The pa-
per he had read contained three distinct grounds,
each of which he considered a complete justifica-
tion of the course he and his colleague proposed to
pursue. The first is, that the resolution is not, m
its terms, or in substance, upon any fair construc-
tion, an instruction which could be regarded as
obligatory upon the Senators. If the principle of
instruction was admitted to the utmost extent it had
been carried any where, the resolution does not
come within it It instructs us what is the wtllvi
the Legislature, but studiously avoids a mandatory
form of expression. By avoiding this, it appears
that the General Assembly was not willing to as-
sume the responsibility of our votes, or did not feel
authorized to do so. As the responsibihty is left
upon us, that imposes upon us the duty et acting
iccordmg to our own judgment Ot, at most, we
can only consider the resolution as an expression
of the opinion of the General Assembly
The second ground i--, that if the resolution had
bsen mandatory in its terms, the General Assem-
bly, in us passage, voted down an amendment
which expressly asserted the light ol instruction
They first deny the right, and then proceed to in-
struct, if the resolution is so to be regarded This
must necessarily take from it all mandatory au-
thority, even if it  tei nib had imported it The resolu-
tion of 1835, to which he had referred, «at, noi only
direct and explicit m in its terms, importing ¿com-
mand, but contains an express asset turn of the 1 i¿ht,
derived fiom popular sentiment Had there been, m
the case under consideration, only an omission to
assert the right, it might perhaps have been claim-
ed, with some prepnety, that ihe passage of the re-
solution carried with it an implied assertion o' the
principle The performance of an act, it might
be said, was in itself a declaration of the ngh  and
power to perform it.
But no such deduction can be made in this case,
beeause the majority expressly disavow the right,
and speak of it as an odious doctrine This objec-
tion, therefore, takes from the resolution all autho-
rity, and leaves it only as an expression of the opi-
nion of the General Assembly, and had it as-
sumed tobe nothing mor?, it would have been ea-
tnled to the highest respect But on its fdee it
bears the stamp of intentional ambiguity, and
double-dealing. The whole proceeding wears tre
appearance of an attempt to practise a decep ;on
upon all parties—upon the Senators and representa-
tives, by inducing them to believe that ihey were
