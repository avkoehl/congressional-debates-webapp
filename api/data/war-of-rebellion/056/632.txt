Colonel GEORGE W. BRENT,Asst. Adjt. General, Army of Tennessee, near Chattanooga:

COLONEL: I wrote you a communication this evening, since which time on of my best scouts has come in, bringing a prisoner from the Fourth Regulars (cavalry) captured near Rogersville. The scout reports the enemy to the number of about 10,000 men had arrived at Rogersville up to last night; that they were encamped in the vicinity of Rogersville awaiting the construction of a raft or bridge, and the falling of Elk River, which is very high. The prisoner reports (and I think he tells the truth, as he is much alarmed, and has been repeatedly questioned) that two companies of his regiment were sent from Maysville to carry dispatches to General Sherman at Waterloo. General Sherman was escorted by the two companies and two from the Third Regulars to Florence on the 1st, and yesterday he was to go to Athens, escorted by the Third Regulars. The prisoner reports four brigades of cavalry, all that pursued General Wheeler, still encamped in the vicinity of Maysville. The brigades are commanded by Wilder, Lowe, Long, and Minty. The prisoner gave the names of many of the regiments. He states that the cavalry has been at Maysville and vicinity every since General Wheeler crossed, recruiting. Minty is under arrest for not coming up in time at Farmington. The supplies, from what I can learn, were hauled about 12 miles. The road from Stevenson to Huntsville is being repaired. My scouts are over the river and up in Tennessee. I hope if the general desires me still to cross the river, it may be in co-operation with some other move, as with the present arrangements of the forces of the enemy and high water, it will be risking much to cross with my command.

I am, colonel, yours, respectfully,

S. D. LEE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF TENNESSEE, November 4, 1863.
