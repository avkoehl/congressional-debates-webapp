General G. K. WARREN,Commanding Fifth Corps:

Your memorandum reports,&amp;c., during the campaign are on file at my office at City Point. You can have copies of them taken at such time as my suit your convenience. The original of those sent by telegraph, I presume, are in the hands of your telegraph operator, and if so, perhaps you can more readily refer to the originals than to the copies we have.

S. WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

(Received 12 m.)

Major-General WARREN,Commanding Fifth Corps:

General Kautz, with upward of 3,000 men of Wilson's command, came in last evening on the plank road south of Reams' Station. General Wilson intended to move south and cross the Nottoway west of the Weldon railroad, pass by Jarratt's Station and recross the Nottoway by Allen's or Peters' Bridge, and come in east of the Nottoway. They met the whole of the enemy's cavalry with two brigades of infantry at a cross-road about two miles west of Reams' Station,

and where about retiring by the route indicated as that of General Wilson, when a part of their line was broken, which separated the two parts of the command. Wilson has not yet been communicated with so far as reported to these headquarters.
