1865.
THE CONGRESSIONAL, GLOBÂ®.
to prescribe for Georgia a change in her organic
law from what it has hitherto been, you have the
right to say to my State what debts, if any, we
shall pay, and what school of politicians shall
hold office. Such power does not exist in the
Federal Government, and it is well for the liber-
ties of the people and the sovereignty of the States
'that it does not.
There is no mistaking the tendency of legisla-
tion under the present rule, it is centralization.
Gentlemen upon this floor do not hesitate dis-
crediting the popular ideas of Thomas Jefferson
and applauding those of Alexander Hamilton.
The theory of the one was the power of the peo-
ple for self-government and the retention of that
power in their hands, while that of the other was
the incapacity of the people to govern themselves
and the centralization of that power in the hands
of the few; in short, to create such a govern-
ment as my colleague [Mr. Garfield] rejoices
we are approximating. He says:
" I am surprised that both the gentleman from Vermont
[Mr. Morrill] and the gentleman from Ohio [Mr. Cox]
declare that this measure would aggrandize the executive
authority. I must say that, to me, it is one objection to
this plan that it may have exactly the opposite effect. I
believe, Mr. Speaker, that the fame of Jefferson is waning,
and the fame of Hamilton waxing, in the estimation of the
American people, and that we are gravitating toward a
stronger Government."
Sir, while my colleague rejoices that such is
the tendency of the times, the people regret that
such is the downward course of freedom. It is
a warning to the people to be more chary of their
liberties in time of a great national convulsion
than at any other. It is a warning to them to
thunder at the prison doors till they fly from their
fastenings and free the innocent captives; to de-
mand the reestablishment of that ancient writ
of liberty, and to upturn your courts-martial for
the trial of private citizens.
Mr. Speaker, in the better days of the Republic
such men as Clay, Calhoun, Benton, Webster,
Cass, and Douglas, would debate months upon
the power of Congress to even prohibit slavery
in Territories of the United States; but now gen-
tlemen find not the least objection to prescribe a
form of government for the people of a State.
If gentlemen wish to preserve the Union, the
right of States and citizens, you must shut your
eyes to slavery and make this war a war for the
Union of the States and the supremacy of the
laws. You must close this bloody carnival. You
must treat in perfect good faith for peace upon
the basis of the Constitution and the Union. You
must carry out the ideas of General Sherman,
making the prerequisite to peace the laying down
pf their arms and the acquiescence in our laws,
to him the thanks of the people are due, notonly
for his military genius, but for the humane and
statesmanlike view he lias taken of the duty of a
rebellious people. Theie is but one way of dis-
posing of this question so as not to do violence
to our political system. Cease this vicious and
partisan legislation; treat the States in rebellion
as in the Union, and not out; the citizens in
arms as rebels, not alien enemies, and when you
have done this you have swept away the cob-
webs of seeming complication, and the way is
comparatively clear to a bright future.
I hope, sir, this bill may not pass.
Mr. ARNOLD asked and obtained permission

Mr. BLOW and Mr. EDGERTON then ad-
dressed the House. [Their speeches will be pub-

Mr. JOHNSON. I beg leave to present joint
resolutions of the Legislature of Maryland passed
a few days since, remonstrating against Congress
grantinga charter to make a railroad in that State.
There is a preamble accompanying the jointres-
olution, which I beg Jjeave, to state for the infor-
mation of the Senate. It sets forth that a char-
ter was granted by Maryland to. build a railroad
from the city of Baltimore to the borough of York,
Pennsylvania, a point on the dividing-line be-
tween the two States of Maryland and Pennsyl-
vania; that the State and the citizens of the State
of Maryland contiibuted nearly all the means
for the construction of that road; and that the
State, with a view to encourage the road, upon
which it had an incumbrance of over a million and
a half of dollars, surrendered that incumbrance
for the benefit of the company. The Legislature
states also that there is now between Washing-
ton and Baltimore a double track amply sufficient
to answer all the purposes which the Govern-
ment or the citizens of the country may require
either to transport merchandise or passengers be-
tween the two termini, Washington and Balti-
more. It also states that the Legislature of Mary-
land have been in session for some time, and of
course weie in session when these resolutions
were passed, and no application has been made
to that Legislature to construct another road be-
tween Baltimore and the District of Columbia;
that they were always willing to do so, provided
they should be satisfied that the necessities of the
country or the convenience of the country re-
quired a different road. They then representthat
they understand that a bill is about to bo submitted
to Congress to authorize the NorthernCentral rail-
road, built, as far as it runs in Maryland, with Ma-
ryland credit and Maryland funds, and encour-
aged, as I have stated, by a surrender of$1,500,000
to the company by the Slate, to construct a road
from Washington to some point on the line of their
railroad; and the Legislature protests in very re-
spectful terms against the passage of any such
act, and asks that if it should come either before
the Senate or the House of Representatives the
Legislature may by its agents be permitted to
be heard. I move that the resolutions lie on the
table, as there is nothing before the Senate at this
time on the subject.
The motion was agreed to.
