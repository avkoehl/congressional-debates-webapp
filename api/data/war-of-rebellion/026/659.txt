WASHINGTON, D. C., April 27, 1863.

Major-General FOSTER,

Commanding, &c., New Berne, N. C.:

GENERAL: The Navy Department has requested that your attention be called to the importance of the military occupation of Smith's Island at the mouth of Cape Fear River. It is said that by the occupation of this island both channels may be closed, and thus prevent the entrance of contraband goods to Wilmington.

I informed Mr. Fox that no additional forces could be given to you at the present time, but that possibly you might accomplish this object, which he deems most important. He says that at this season, while the water is smooth, there will be no difficulty in landing.

If you should be able to occupy this island as many contrabands as possible should be used in fortifying and holding the position. I understand from the Secretary of War that a Colonel Wild, of Boston, has been directed to report to you to organize one or more negro regiments. If this should be done it is suggested that they can be used to the best advantage on Smith's Island.

It is regretted that we cannot give you more troops for active operations in the field, but at this time it is impossible to do so.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.
