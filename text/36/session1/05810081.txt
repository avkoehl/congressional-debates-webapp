SPEECH QF HON. T. C. HINDMAN,
OF ARKANSAS,
In the House of Representatives,
January 19 and 20, I860,
[REVISED BY HIMSELF",f]
On the organization of the {louse, and in lepiy to Mr.
Sherman', of Ohio.
Mr. HINDMAN said: .
Mr. Clerk: 1 sought the floor yesterday with
no purpose of making what is called a set speech;
nor do I intend to make one now. As the House
did not then seem disposed to proceed to a ballot,
I supposed I might, with some propriety, occupy
a few moments m showing where the responsi-
bility of the failure to organize rests. That was
ray object yesterday, and it is my object now.
To carry it out, it may be necessary to allude to
general issues; but it will not be necessary, I im-
agine, to discuss them at any length. Confining
myself as closely as possible to my original de-
sign, I shall consume but a small part of the day.
When we met here on the 5th of December, it
was hoped that an organization jvould be effected
at once, and the business of the country taken up
and promptly dispatched. But in that we have
failed. Six weeks of fruitless ballotings leave the
House still unorganized, and with no apparent
prospect of organizing. Under such circum-
stances, it is not to be thought that all of us will
escape public censure. The hope of the people,
so bitterly disappointed, already turns to indig-
nation. Their own common sense tells them there
is culpability somewhere; and that same common
sense will single out the men who are blamable.
When that is done, and the real authors of the
existing condition of*things are known; when all
their flimsy disguises are torn from them, and
they are exposed as guilty of stopping the wheels
