FORT LEAVENWORTH, May 23, 1865.

Lieutenant Colonel D. J. HYNES,

Kansas City, Mo.:

General Mitchell has been absent for some days; returns to-night, and, as he has been in direct communication with General Dodge while he was away, I am unable to answer your inquiries until to-morrow. The company of your regiment at Macon has been ordered to report to General Mitchell.

General JOHN POPE:

Your dispatch relating to movement on hostile Indians near Devil's Lake received. Have sent orders to General Sully accordingly.

Major-General CURTIS, Milwaukee, Wis.:

Your letter of May 11 just received. I have sent orders to Sully to stop his movement to Black Hills. He awaits your orders. In moving against Devil's Lake the best point to start from is Fort Rice. Sully can take twelve companies of cavalry and some small guns with him. He no doubt has transportation enough for the expedition to Devil's Lake. Send him orders immediately to Sioux City. I have again applied for authority to pursue Indians into British territory. Without it I fear we can't accomplish much. Use all the troops in your department as you think best. Will write.

Major-General.

I have sent a small steamer to Fort Rice with rations for Sully's expedition to Devil's Lake.

GENERAL: Yours of the 20th instant, complaining of an article of recent date in the Milwaukee Sentinel, which attempts to give details of Indian views and some details of proposed Indian movements [received].
