LEXINGTON, November 16, 1864.

Lieutenant-Colonel BASCOM,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Louisville:

I can concentrate five regiments-Eleventh Michigan Cavalry, Twelfth Ohio Cavalry, Eleventh Kentucky Cavalry, and Thirtieth and Thirty-ninth Kentucky Mounted Infantry-in three days. They number in all about 1,850 effective mounted men; they are now scattered after guerrillas. If horses and equipments can be had, I can mount 2,000 more men in ten days. If my troops are wanted at the front, I am ready to command them.

S. G. BURBRIDGE,

Brevet Major-General, Commanding.

I have directed General Burbridge to concentrate his available mounted force at some point on the road leading from Lexington to Cumberland Gap, so that either it can be pushed into East Tennessee or be used to repel any attempt to penetrate into Kentucky from that direction. There are about 800 men at Cumberland Gap, all dismounted.

GEO. STONEMAN,

Major-General.
