25th CoNG....lst Sess.               _________Making public officers depositories—Mr. Moore.________________________H. of Reps.
nly assume that the frainers of the Constitution
intended to vest in Congiess a power which they
omitted to specify, for surelyit could not be pretended
by an intelligent body of men, such as compose
our judiciary, that Congress possessed the con-
stitutional power to do an act which the Con-
stitution no where expressly authorizes, and
which the framers of that instrument evidently
intended to interdict. This doctrine of construc-
tion, therefore, rests entirely upon the known or
supposed intentions of the convention which framed
the Constitution. It is incumbent, therefore, on
those who allege, in the absence of all direct au-
thority, that Congress possess an implied powu*
to incorporate a national bank, to show, at /east,
that the convention did not intentionally withhold
the said power from Congress Now, sir, if this
can not be done, but, on tne contrary, if it can be
proved that the subject m question was agitated
in the convention wh ch framed tae Constitution,
thrt propositions were theie made to invent Con-
gic^ with power to craiter a bank, and that all
propositions having that object in view were re-
jected by the coinention, it necessarily follows,
that Con^r^ss posse s no such power, whether ex-
press or implied—the decision of the Supreme
Court to the contrary notwithstanding I then
take this ground that, inasmuch as there is no ex-
press constitutional authority given to Congress to
charter a bank, and as the earners of the Consti-
tution repeatedly and deliberately rejected all pro-
positions to vest in Congress pouei to grant acts of
incorporation of whatevei description, that Con-
gress, therefore, are as virtual'y and morally pío-
hibited from granting a bank char er(imts national
capacity) as if the Constitution contained an ex-
press prohibitory clause with repaid to it. I lepeat,
that this is mvgiound, and if Í car show that the
framers of the ( on>uintion ¿hi net intend to \e-4
in Congress power to grant nets of incc i pom t ion of
any Kind, but designed y withheld siuh power, then
the constitutional light to chiitei a bark, does not,
and can not, belong to Cuigre^s In oidu 10 show
what were the vieus enteitaincdon the subject of a
national bank, as well as of every other spec e& of
interpolation, ky the framcis of the Constitution,
it will be necessary to consult the journal oí the con-
vention, as well as the statements of several of the
delegates aüer the convention rose But previous
tt introducing these authorities, I will st'tc—what
is already known to the committee—that thereuere
two paities in the convention, uho held opposing
views relative to the form and dnractei of the Go-
vernment proposed to be established Thf one,
advocated a supreme national or consolidated, the
0 hei, a federal foim of Go\ eminent The latter
eventually UHimphed The friends of a snpren e
Government, after 1 cm"- defeated in all their dnut
efToits, endeavored to accomplish thou puipose ly
indirect means, «s fully appears by the lo'lo/uin*

tutton considered the condition of public gojd, as an enlarae-
ment and pot a restriction of power, and that it would defeat
¿I! the limitations of the Constitution, by whieh <t Federal
Government could be formed or sustained It was a pretext
which would fit eveiv encroachment or usmpauon, and no
powers could be moro indefinite and sovereign than th ose of
granting exclusive privileges, bestowing rewards indimmun

It appears that the mduoct and in*; djous means
(which wore intended to be exercised thioneh the
medium of mcoiporahons and exclmi\e privi-
leges) of the con^ohdationists, to o^tablt^h a stn-
p eme national Government, shared the ^ame fate
in tie convention, as did then more open and di-
leet efforts. Dut, ^r, let us proeeed to examine the
evidvnee on thf point m question, in the order in
which it «tands on the jomnal of the convention.
On the 59th of May, the third day a fur the conven-
tion had formed a quorum, Mr PjnHney, dele-
gate from South Carnlun, submitted the plan of a
constitution, in which he pi oponed to bestow on
Oonsries-s the^ power ('to borrow money," Ac de.

On the 24th of Julv, tl e committee, consiitirg of
ñ\e, weie cho-en, and on the 6th of August, the
committee lepcned the "diaft of a Constitution,"
and amonir other pow eis proposed to he pi ven to
Core;ress were the foliov ms "To lay and collect
taxes to boirow mone> , and emit bills on the credit
of the United States "
On the Ifith of August, wb^r this " draft of a
Constitution" wra* un 'er discussion, and particu-
Jiily the power last above mentioned
" Tt was mo\ed ^nd seconded to stnke o'U the word? 'and

Ceoign, 9    Nays, New Jeisey, Mdi\lani],2"
The convention, after having denied to Congress
the power to emit hills of credit—which power had
been possessed by the confederation—deemed pro-
per to extend a like prohibition to the State Go-
vernments, this subject was decided on the 28th
day of August, when the 12th article was under
consideration
" It was moved and seconded to insert the words (nor emit
bills of ciedit,1 after the word 'money,' which passed in the af*
firmati\ e "
On the 18th of August, as has already been
shown, two different propositions were made to au-
thorize Congrebi to grant acts of incorporation, and
were both rejected. On the 14th of September, the
power to create corporations wras again proposed
to be vested in Congress, but was again, and for
the third and last time, rejected, (bee journal ) Thus
far the journal of the convention I uould now
ask the attention of the committee to the state-
ments made by the members of the convention.
Luther Martin, a delegate from the State of
Maryland, in his disclosures to the Legislature of
that State, makes the following remarks:
"Ily our original articles ofconfedeialion, the Congress have*
power to bonovv money and emit bil!*? of credit on the cridit
of the United States, agreeable to which was the report on this
system a<5 made by the committee of detul When we can  -
to this part of the lepoit, a motion was made to stnke out the
wonte to emit bills of credit,' against the motion we nged,
that it v- ould be mipioprr to dept n e the Congress of that power,
thit it woul 1 be a novelty unprecedented to establish a Go
vernment which should not have such authonty That it was
impossible to lookforwaid into futurity t>o fai a- to decide, thac
e\ent«i might not happen that should rendei the exerascof
such a powu absolutely nece^aiy, and that we dorbied,
whe'heril a war should take place it would be possible foi thi<*
coin try to defend itfceli, without having recourse to paptr
credit, m which cibethert would be a nec^s^ity of becoming a
pteytoour encime" ot Molatnv tl e OoiWitmion of our Go
vetnment, and h it, corwdeimg the administration of (he Go-
vcrnn ent would be puncipiüy in tie hands of the wealthy,
then could be lutl*- leason to feai an abuse of the powei iy
