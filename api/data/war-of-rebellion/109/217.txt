SAINT LOUIS, MO., February 27, 1862.

Major General GEORGE B. McCLELLAN,

Washington, D. C.:

Numerous reports have been received that Buell occupied Nashville without opposition, but reports brought down the Cumberland of enemy's movements are conflicting. Some say they are concentrated at Murfreesborough, others Columbia, others Decatur. No movements will be made until facts are positively ascertained. Tennessee willprobably be navigable yet for some weeks. Two gun-boats at Clarksville and two above Fort Henry; others being repaired. Comodore Foote says he cannot be ready to protect mortar-boats for the bombardment in much less than ten days. The Essex will not be fit for service in less than four weeks. Nelson's division sent to relieve Smith's at Clarksville and to follow gun-boats toward Nashville. They will go up as far as Buell wants them. They should return, however, as soon as possible, as they are wanted at Columbus. Randolph is said to be very strongly fortified. I cannot ascertain its armament. General Pope with 10,000 men is advancing on New Madrid. His advance guard will reach Sykesville [Sikeston] to-night. From there the movement will be slow, as the roads are terrible. There is no return yet from Grant.
