Making public officers depositaries—Mr. Hubbard.
the establishment oí a Government bank**   A bank
of issues, a bank of cv culation"1
The public funds, which may, m the pursuance
of ihese provisions, be placed for safe-keeping in
some or all of the depositories is, I suppose, to be
understood as constituting the capital of this great
Go\ crnment bank
Cut, unlike all othei banking institutions, it pos-
sesses no powt r to tiade upon this capital The
same has been deposited, and is m the safe custody
of the public officers, but not a dollar of this capi-
tal, at any tunc, oi under any pretence, can be
withdraw n, except by tht authority of law The
Tieasurer of the United States, in tht capacity
of acting president of the new discovered bank,
in conjunction with the w hole board of directors,
in the chaiacter of Mint treasurers, collectors and
i ccei er , cannot discount one dollar of this capí
ta , except it be through the acts of the Legislature
and Executive blanches of the Government
The cipital then of tms Government bank is
placed beyond the reach of any cashier, teller,
direc*oi, or any o her officer connected with the
institution
The Senatol from Virginia must have imposed
a severe ta\ upon his ingenuity, to have conceived
the lemotest similitude between the provisions of
these nmp sections, and the provisions of a Nation-
al Bank charter, between this measure and a Go-
vernment bank
It must be undei the tenth secaon of this bill
that the Senator liom Vngmia imagines that any
banking power is conferred upon the executive offi-
cers of the Go\ eminent The Treasuiy Depart-
ment has, by virtue of tins section, authority to
transfer the iro^ej s in the hands of one depositary
to the cnarge of another A power which has, of
nece^su), been exercised by that Department since
the fojrdat on of the Government. The Secretary
oí the Treasury has no more power under this bill,
with re erence to the transfei of the public money,
than ne possessed during the existence of the Batik
of the UniU-d States than he possessed before and
since the existence of that institution That officer,
from the character of the public appropriations,
must know <it v. hat particular poim"s expenditures
will be required, and he would be a most faithless
offcer to permit the deposites of the public money
*o accumulate m New York, when the wants of
the Go\ ernment will demand their use at New Or-
leans
This powei must be vested in some one of
the Executive Departments It has been vested
and exercised, from the commencement ot the Go
vemment, by the Treasury Department, to which
has oeen committed ihe overs ght and general man-
-^ement of the public revenues The discharge of
this high, necessary, and responsible duty has
alarmed the fears ot th° Senator from Virginia
He has exhibited to our \iew, as the offspring of
this power, the hideous spectre of a Government
Bank
There i? no po u- given to the Secretary, in
transfemng the pnbhc funds "at his discretion, and
a« the safety o> the pjblic monejs and the con-
\ enience of the pu he sen ice shall seem to him to
regime," to iiiejt those funds, to give to them any
dittoent d i ecu in Ans such order of transfer
would at once be dishmo-ed but,if regais¡eá,would
sul j ct the Secretar) himself, and all concerned, to
the se e e bui just, penalty piescnbed by the act
Such i purpose nevei could be peifected It is
then, sir to my mtnd, strange indeed that the bank-
ing powe , nh ih the feenatoi from Virgnia says
is conk in lb) fh s. bil1, can povubly be inferred
from ti i   tenth sect on
l?ul thi "p is -mo i,oi clause of this section nhich
?sci o he ircasu ei Oi the Uni ed States, for the
purpose oi pumtnts on public aceo mt, power to
draw upon the depositories, as the public irtciests
and the convenience of the public cieditors shall
require, a power coeval with the existence of the
Government, and without the exercise of which I
am unable to discover how its fiscal affans could
safely be conducted It should, however, be boine
constantly m mmd, that this same Treasurer of the
United States cannot issue his drafts, evcept to dis-
charge appropriations made by law This is all
the cont! >1, ajl the power, which this or any other
public officer has over the disbursements of the
public money, and yet the Senator says there is
established by this bill a power to bank upon the
public funds. How, when or where, I cannot see.
The importer^ must pay their duties, and the pur-
chasers must pay for their lands, the receivers must
deposite the avails, the officers charged with the
custody must safely keep, and must disburse the
same, to satisfy the public creditors, upon the
drafts of the Treasurer of the United States, issued
in pursuance of legal appropriations This is the
whole power given by this bill to the public officers
over the public funds The best individual bend
or commercial paper in the community cannot
draw from the safes and vaults of the Treasury a
solitary dollar on loan The capital of the Amen-
cati people cannot be touched by their agents, ex-
cept for the support of their Government, and then,
not without the consent of their representatives.
The committee, in preparing this bill, intended
to steer clear of any such objection The bill of
the extra session, embracing the same general prin-
ciple, was assailed on this ground. It will be
found, m further pursuing the details of this bill,
that the eleventh section contains the very impor-
tant provision that all the public moneys, no matter
where held in deposite, shall be credited " to me
Treasurer of the United States, and shall be at all
times subject to his draft," and I have before
shown whence this same officer derived his autho-
rity to disburse the public money, and what was
the extent of that authority
This section, then, puts the matter to rest, makes
confirmation strong as " holy writ," that no other
officer, be he whom he may, " whetfeer president,
director, cashier, or teller of this Government bank"
can, by any power he may possess, withdraw any
portion of the capital, for any purpose It follow s,
then, that this Government bank cannot issue any
paper for circulation as money, and has no other
power over its capital than to discount the Trea-
surer's drafts, for the payment of public creditors.
The thirteenth section gives authority to the Secre-
tary of the Treasury, under certain circumstances,
to direct the public moneys to be specially deposited
m some selected bank, and prescribes the condi-
tions and terms upon which deposites shall thus be
made The first is, " that ihe banks holding them
shall bepiohibitedfiommakmganyuseofthe moneys
deposited by way of loans, discounts, or in any other
manner, or for any othei purpose whatsoever And this
essential provision is most faithfully secured by the
subsequent terms of this section.
The fifteenth and sixteenth sections of this bill
impose additional and impoitant guards for the
safe-keeping of the public moneys thus deposited,
to meet the wants of the Treasury But it has
been said that this bill gives authority to indivi-
duals to make deposites, and to receive certificates
of sueh deposites from the Treasury Department,
and these certificates will pass as the paper money
of this Government bank
I am bound to suppose every gentleman sincere
in the objections which he urges to this measure.
But, sir, I have looked through and through this
bill, I have examined it with all the care and atten-
tion which I can bestow upon it, and I must say
that this objection is utterly groundless, without
any foundation upon which it can rest
The nineteenth section, it is true, gives autho-
rity to a certain descnption of public officers,
' hating public money to pay to the United States, and
all patentees uishmg to make payment for patents
issued, to pay all such moneys at the Treasury of the
United Stales," or at the other places of public
deposite, and the officers are to give ceitificates of
all such payments, and the twenty-seventh section
also provides that the Treasurer of the United
States may receive payments in advance for the
public lands, and give a certificate therefor, which
shall be received at the land offices, but, so far from
this constituting a paper cuirencv, their transfer or
assignment is, in terms, expressly prohibited
From these sections is inferred the dangerous
power given to the Executive to issue a Govern-
ment bank paper to pass as currency Alt the
power which the Executive has, m relation to this
matter, is conferred by these two sections I leave
for others to show wheie the danger lies.   It must
occur to every practical man, that the ja#jteges
granted by the twenty-seventh section witt greatly
promote individual convenience, without making
the Government ohnoxjotts to the charge of receiv-
ing money on individual deposite. In both sec-
tions, all that is done is to provide a convenient
mode for receiving the pubic dues, and not for
creating Government liabilities.
If any thing further were necessary to relieve
the public mmd from the suspicion that this mil
looks to the establishment of a Government Bank,
I would refer to the important provisions of die
twentieth section, not only prohibiting any pubke
officer, under any pretence, from using the public
money, but imposing the severe penalty of fine and
imprisonment, should any such officer transgress.
The public press, also, since this bill was first
brought forward, has exerted its power to preju-
dice the public mmd against this measure, by pub-
lications without even the shadow of truth to sus-
tain them It is said that "the plan is drawn up
with exceeding skill, and apparently with the prin-
cipal object of ensuring safety to the public mo-
ney. But, in reality, it proposes a vast Govern-
ment bank ,wholly and without any cfcesifc, under the con-
trol of the Executive It would possess all the pow-
ers of a National Bank, but without any of the
cheeks or guards which should surround such an
institution. To show that I do not deal in mere
assertion, I propose to point out the true features
of this abominable plan, and to prove that it is
nothing more or less than a Government Bank,
under the unchecked control of the President, or
his instrument, the Secretary of the Treasury.
" What are the principal powers op a bank' They
are, 1 The power of issuing bills, to be used as a
currency 2 The receiving and holding deposites
of money And 3d The loaning of money, and
the buying and selling of exchange,
"I presume it wfil be admitted, that the above
are all the essential powers or PRIVILEGES OP
A BANK"> The proposed law expressly confers
all these privileges upon the Treasury Department,
and gives it the whole revenue of the country, and
all the money which individuals may deposite with
it, as o capital to work upon'"
Have I not already shown that this measure
confers no power to issue a paper currency, to re-
ceive private deposites, or to loan money? This,
however, is sent forth to the American people m
one of the journals m the city of Boston as the
true character of this public measure
In what part of this bill are to be found provi-
sions tending to the establishment of a Government
bank, without check, and under the control of the
Executive? Where is to be found the grant of ex-
excutive power to issue paper to be used as a cur-
rency? Does any part of the bill give authority
to receive, and hold as deposites, the money of
othersi Is there any power conferred to loan mo-
ney, or trade in exchange1 No, sir and if the
writer of this article had examined this measure
with a spirit of candor, and free from prejudice, he
could never have given to the public sentiments so
much at war with the spirit and letter of this bill.
One of the provisions of this much abused mea-
sure, which must r Gommend it more than any
other, is, that it takes from every officer of the Go-
vernment the power of employing the public fund 
"as a capital to work upon."
The Senator from Virginia says, as between a
Government Bank, such as this bill seeks to esta-
blish, and a Bank of the United States, such as
has recently existed, he should pause long before he
should go for a Government Bank.
In such an alternative he should pause long be-
fore he could git e to this measure his preference
I have read, sir, the speech of the honorable Sena-
tor, delivered on this floor m 1834, and it seems to
me inconceivable that any alternative could be pre-
sented to his mmd which could induce him, under
any circumstances, to give his support to the re-
establishment of a National Bank.
On the occasion to which I have referred, tb*
Senator remarked
"I am not less sensible, I trust, sir, than other
gentlemen to the sufferings of any portion of my
fellow-citizens, but I must say that the present cri-
sis, whatever be its seventy, c*m s alleviated by
