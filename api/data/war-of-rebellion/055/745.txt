HEADQUARTERS CLEBURNE'S DIVISION.

COLONEL: On the morning of the 23rd November, 1863, I was with my division at Chickamauga Station, on the Western and Atlantic Railroad, attending to the transportation, of Buckner's and my own division by rail to Loudon, E. Tennessee, where, with both divisions, I was ordered to report to Lieutenant-General Longstreet, then besieging Knoxville.
