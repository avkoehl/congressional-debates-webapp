COMMANDING OFFICER,

Fort Laramie:

I have just received the following dispatch from department headquarters:

Brigadier-General R. B. MITCHELL:

Information has reached here that the Indians have stolen 175 head of stock from near Denver, in your district. I telegraphed Colonel Chivington to co-operate with your troops. Have you any information of it? Answer.

S. R. CURTIS.

You will take the necessary measures to recapture the stock and, if possible, the Indians. Handle the scoundrels without gloves if it becomes necessary. Communicate with Colonel Chivington and report anything that may occur.

ROBT. B. MITCHELL,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

Major-General CURTIS,

As soon as I learn what forces can be sent to General Steele from the States west of the Ohio I will order them. Have your ordered General Banks to come away with his troops, or does he leave any subject to General Steele's orders, and how many? General Steele reported that he had only about 7,000 to take with him from the Arkansas, and that his cavalry and artillery were very bad.
