HEADQUARTERS,Fort Williams, Baton Rouge, May 1, 1864.

Brigadier General RICHARD ARNOLD,

Chief of Artillery, Department of the Gulf:

SIR: I have the honor to state that I arrived at this point April 12, 1864, with my command, where I disembarked, by order of Brigadier-General Cooke. My command musters, present and absent, 1, 654. There are some recruits not included, say 75, at Indianapolis. Company L, as you know, is in Texas. I have at this post an aggregate of 1, 178. I would request of you that Companies A and G be sent to Alexandria to take charge of guns there and return the men belonging to Companies H, I, and K, now here. It is of the greatest importance that these detachments be returned to their companies in order to perfect our regimental organization. Company A numbers 5 officers and 121 men; Company G, 5 officers and 144 men.
