CUMBERLAND, August 12, 1864.

Brevet Major-General CROOK:

The term of service of all the troops I have between Piedmont and Sleepy Creek expires in a few days, except small detachment of the Sixth and Eleventh West Virginia Infantry. Governor Brough is extremely anxious the 100-days' men be promptly sent home. Will you send troops to relieve them? I would prefer Virginia troops, because of their acquaintance with the people and the geography of the country. The people here are anxious to have the Second Maryland sent back.

B. F. KELLEY,

Brigadier-General.
