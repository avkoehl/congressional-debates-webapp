spviuto an enemy's camp, by which happy ¿j alcsirs we nave
had it illustrated It was an enterprise of war undeit-ken
under the iron it-spotisibihttcs, impounded Ly the iron right, of
war     is exact legal denomination is ' in/braai,  z7isolemn
hosiihly "   Let u^ cailthmgs by their right uarne-^ <md hold
England and hold ouvselves up consistently to this view of the
transaction    Look at It.   There was a ioicible temporary oc-
cupation of our territory by an ajrmed foreign body, acting in
organization, eent across by a foreign Goveinmerit, as a Go-
vernment, rot for plunder, but as an alleged grave measare of
state policy—for the alleged defence of its own sod and its
own law against revolutionary invaders from without.   What
sort of act is that, sir? The mover is a Government; the induce-
ment a high íeason of state; the instruments and the effects
suchasotdinanly do the w or if, and mark the eiant tread of
wat    Armed men violently assail a vessel moored on our wa-
ters, owned by oui citizens, reposing, as we aHege, beneath
the protection, not forfeited, of the folds of our flag    It is the
ciy of brief, bat actual battle, which rises above the murmui
ofthatonwaid, unreturnmg stream    The peace of nur tefrito
ry was disturoed, its sanctity wa& violated, the charmed Ule OÍ
an Ameiican citizen was taken in fight, the property of an
American cmzen, iteelf part of the general wealth ol the com-
munity, was de^trojed    This, su, in the language of the pub-
licists, is "mfoimal hostility" against the United States,  and
the responsibility of England, who oideied it to be committed,
and the immunity of the soldiers who enforced the order with
the bayonet and cutlass, result, of course, according to the prin-
ciple on winch, as I have said, we all take oui stand, and jo
which ail publicists agree    I do not say that by this act Eng
land intended to begin a war on the United States or to impair
om strength diminish our ueasure ounsuHour flag as a na-
tion,   Ceitainly not    Buahe act which she does is to invade
oui territory forcibly and unlawfully, for the purpose of reach-
nig and destroying the propel ty oí one of oui  citizens, which
she had no i ight so to reach and so to desti oy, and to effect that
purpose by military violence and by shedding innocent blooti
in battle    And this act is hostility against us, because  our
lights die outraged, and they aie outraged by thewethode^nd
the ptoetsb^b, and according to the forms oí war, and because
eveiy natiot and every man must be hofden to intend the acts
which he docs, and then necessary consequences    How do
you distinguish this proceeding from the attack on Cofenha
gen, in 180S, t  which the Senator from  \ uginia alluded  last
evening   What was that transaction?   England, cherishm*
ro hostile feeling against Denmark, (ior Denmai k, like herseif
wa&actually in dims, agam&tthe Enipeioi ofthe Tienoh,) ron-
eeived a tear that that ancient, gallant, but not very powerfn*
nation might iall before him, in which case hei sixteen ships of
war would become hi&—a formidable accession to the strength
by which he was urging forwaid his aim of umveisal dorm
nion    Thereupon she sent Admiral Gambiei to Copenhagen,
bombauled it, killed and wounded above a thousand peisone
and earned off the whole Danish fleet     That is, she forcibly
invades tlic Danish territory for the purpose of poscts-ing hej
beliofdivei   bhips, of which, as against fc)enmaik, -^he had no
riET'it to take possesion, not for the puipose of weakening oi
insulting her, butto prevent their becoming, m other hands, the
mstrumentsof aunovance against hen>elf    So here    She m
vades out temtoiy with military foice, foi the purpose of pos-
fceshin0* heroell of a vessel, of whieh, a*; against us, she  h d no
naht thus to take possession, not to weaken oi insult its, but
topieventi s being, m othei hands, the instrument of annoy-
ance against herself   The cases are alike cases of informal
waraeamst the nation whose national rights are mvadeft    In
thealair oí Copenhagen, the object ofthe invasion was the
capture of Danish Government ships    If, instead of that, it had
been Danish merchant ships, lest their cargoes might go to
fill the cofleisof Fiance, oi to transport Trench munitions of
war, Troiild the act have been at all the less an act of hostility
asaina Denmark1   Nay, if Denmark hat) been neutra!, and
the object had been to cut out a Trench «hip which Ind fled
to Copenhagen fo\ ^helteijit would still have been a hostile ag-
gression against Denmaik lie^elf    The attack upon Copenha-
gen was upon a giandct  scile than that  upon the  Carohm,
more ships, moje men gieaei parnés a more pictinescjiii. ar-
rangement oi the spectac e of wai     lint the essential ch< rac
