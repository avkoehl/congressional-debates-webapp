Which way was that column moving? State from what point, toward what point, [and] the hour the last of their column passed the nearest point to us.

Colonel SHAFFER, Chief of Staff:

Here is all I can get in answer to the general's questions. Lookout at Crow's Nest says:

The column crossed near Fort Darling. They passed Chaffin's Bluff. The last I saw of them was about 11.30. Shortly after crossing the river they went into the woods; did not see them again.

Lookout at battery:

The column was nearest to us at Chaffin's Bluff, where the last of the column moving from east to west passed about 2 p. m.

W. T. H. BROOKS,Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS TENTH CORPS, June 26, 1864.

General BUTLER:

The signal officer at water battery reported at 10.45 a. m.: Cavalry and wagons have been crossing at Cox's Ferry for an hour, and still crossing from east to west. He afterward reported that he judged it was Cox's Ferry from the map. Crossing continued up to 2 o'clock.

The lookout at Crow's Nest:

This morning about 11 o'clock I saw a large body of mounted men cross the river above Fort Darling. They crossed to the west side of the river. I should think about 3,000 men; also a wagon train.

General Foster reports:

Up to yesterday morning the movement of troops was toward Malvern Hill. This morning the movement is back toward Richmond.

I have sent to the different lookouts for answers to your last inquiry.

W. T. H. BROOKS,

Brigadier-General.
