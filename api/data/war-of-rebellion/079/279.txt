Brigadier-General WAGNER,

Chattanooga:

If it is not known to a certainty that the enemy are at Dalton or in that vicinity I wish you to let the troops at Ringgold, Tunnel Hill, and other points on the road remain at their posts, unless their safety depends upon their withdrawal. You will show this dispatch to Major-General Schofield when he arrives, as he was directed by me last evening to assume command in Chattanooga. If possible ascertain definitely where the enemy is and report his movements promptly.
