skirmishing, but are all the time gaining, and hope to have the line all right very soon. The position we occupy is entirely on the south side of the creek. We are now seeking positions for artillery. The line is so short that we will have a good reserve.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.

My headquarters are on the road leading from Harris' Store [Haw's Shop] to the Jones house. It is the same road taken by Colonel Humphrey yesterday.

Major-General BURNSIDE,

Commanding Ninth Corps:

The commanding general requests me to say that the mistake he referred to was taking Warren's skirmish line for his line of battle. General Warren was directed to act in concert in advancing, and should have given you notice each time of his intention to move his connecting flank. His attention is called to this point.
