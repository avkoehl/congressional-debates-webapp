THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
February 10,
months, that we are admonished far more strongly
than by any language I can use of the necessity
there is for some action upon the part of Congress
upon this subject. Sir, the recent terrible dis-
aster to the steamer Central America, which has
wrung so many hearts, and carried sorrow and
desolation into nearly every family in the country,
calls to us in the loudest tones to act in this mat-
ter, and endeavor, if we possibly can, to provide
some regulations of law by which a recurrence of
these terrible disasters may be prevented hereafter.
Now, sir, I propose to explain briefly the prin-
cipal provisions of the bill. The bill itself, with
a report of some eighteen pages, which have been
printed, will prevent the necessity for explaining
all the provisions in detail. I trust, if the House
will give me their attention for a few moments,
they will be satisfied that the bill ought to pass
into a law. We have brought within the pro-
visions of this bill steam ferry-boats, tug-boats,
freight-boats, and other craft which were not in-
cluded in the act of 1852, and upon which some
of the most terrible accidents have, happened in
consequence of their not having been included
under the provisions of the law of 1852, and of
their not being subject to the inspection of the
supervisors under that law. In this bill we bring
within the law these boats, and place additional
restrictions upon their carrying oil of turpentine,
spirits ofturpentine, vitriol,gunpowder, and other
combustible and dangerous articles, and inflict
additional penalties for carrying them.
We provide penal ties for inscribing upon steam-
ers false names. There is a law requiring the
names of all vessels to be painted upon their sterns;
but it has been the habit, in some of the large
cities, while the regular name is painted upon the
stern, to paint upon the wheel-houses, or In some
other conspicuous place, some other name, by
which the public are deceived. We inflict aheavy
penalty for this offense. We provide further for
the more complete and thorough inspection of
steamboat boilers, and for carrying lights on sail-
ing vessels. And there is another very important
provision to which I wish to call the attention of
the House. We provide that all these ocean-going
passenger steamers shall be divided into water-
tight compartments and bulkheads. We provide
for the proper number of boats, and determine
how they shall be used. We also limit the num-
ber of passengers whichshall be carried upon
these ocean-going steamers. It has been found
necessary to interpose the strong arm of the law
against the cupidity of steamboat owners who
have loaded their vessels going from this country
to such an extent as to make a passage in them
worse than the middle passage.
We provide for the removal of planlcs after the
vessel shall have been built a certain length of
time, so that it shall be determined whether the
rot has gotten into her. We provide, also, that
station bills shall be posted up in all the passen-
ger steamers, in which shall be entered the names
of all the passengers, and of the officers and crew
of the boat, designating the station or part of the
steamer assigned to each passenger and person on
board, to prevent confusion in case of accident.
We provide, further, against granting certifi-
cates to any vessel or boat in which the inspector
shall be directly or indirectly interested, and in-
flict a large penalty on them for doing so. We
provide foran additional supervisor and inspector
on the Pacific coast. At the time of the passage
of the act of 1852, it was not considered neces-
sary; but at the present time it is conceded that
the appointment of a supervisor and inspector
on that coast is necessary. We provide further.
We provide for the performance of the duties of
inspector in certain specified cases—as where the
regular inspector is sick, provided that m such
cases where inspection is necessary, other par-
ties may be called in, under certain restrictions,
to make the inspection. We then regulate the
salaries of local inspectors, and provide for the
summoning of witnesses before the inspectors,
and compelling their attendance.
We provide, further, that when an accident
whall occur, there shall be made a full and com-
plete report by the officer or person in charge, or,
in his absence, by some licensed officer, to the
first custom-house officer that can be reached.
This report shall contain everything connected
with the accident, shall be made under oath, and
shall be made a matter of record, to which refer-
ence can be had for authentic information in re-
gard to the accident.
There is another section, which is not in the
printed substitute, but which is in the substitute
which I shall offer, which provides against con-
spiracies or combinations on the part of pilots and
other persons, the tendency of which is to obstruct
commerce on the different rivers.
I will say, and it will conclude all I have to say,
that the steamboat law of 1852 is nearly self-sus-
taining. I understand, from the parties who are
engaged in its execution, that the fees of inspect-
ors and other officers amount to what it costs the
Government; and, sir, the additional salaries of
additional boards of inspectors will be more than
paid by the additional amount of fees to be paid
by steamboats to be brought within the operation
of this act.
The gentleman from Louisiana [Mr. Taylor]
has submitted d bill which would change the entire
system. One of the provisions of that bill wc have
incorporated into the pending measure. The other
provision we did not incorporate. We thought
it would he unsafe to adopt the principle which it
embraced, at this time. Although we concede to
the gentleman great ability and great legal acu-
men, yet, as his proposition changes the entire
principle of the law, we felt constrained to object
to it. The gentleman, however, can have an op-
portunity of taking the sense of the House on the
question, by moving it ns an amendment to my
substitute. I understand that the gentleman de-
sires to submit some remarks on the subject. The
gentleman from California [Mr. Scott] also de-
sires to he heard. After these gentlemen have
been heard, unless there shall be a strong desire
on the part of other gentlemen to address the
House, I hope the House will second the call for
the previous question, that we may come to a vote
upon the bill to-day.
Let me say, in anticipation of a motion to refer
the bill to the Committee of the Whole on the
state of the Union, on the plea of perfecting it, as
it is called, that I would much rather that the
House would lay the bill upon the table, and at
once kill it.
Mr. SMITH, of Virginia. What is the gen-
tleman's particular objection to a reference to the
Committee of the Whole on the state of the
Union ?
Mr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois. Because, to
make that reference is to give the bill a lingering
death.
Mr. SCOTT. Mr. Speaker, I propose making
some remarks in relation to the bill which is now
before the consideration of this House, and shall
confine myself more particularly to that portion
of it which has reference to our ocean steamers.
On the 20th of January I introduced a bill " to
provide for the better security of the lives of pas-
sengers on board of steamers navigating the ocean
propelled wholly or in part by steam." That bill
was read twice, referred to the Committee on Com-
merce, and ordered to be printed. The commit-
tee, after due deliberation, and after a thorough
consultation with persons who were considered
experts in such matters, have reported favorably,
and incorporated my bill in the one which is now
before this House.
I know that many high and important ques-
tions, of a national character, are now absorbing
not only the attention of this House, but the en-
tire country. Already the great eye of the people
is turned with a painful anxiety, and with a deep
solicitude to our future course—to that vexed and
threatening question, Kansas; and scarcely will
the wild, fierce, and turbulent waves of section-
alism be settled by a proper adjustment, before
another will again be presented, to agitate and
distract this body, in the imposing form of the
Utah and Niearaguan difficulties. While I am
free to confess, that, in each and all of these ques-
tions are involved great principles, requiring the
combined wisdom of this distinguished body to
fairly and justly reconcile, I nevertheless believe
that the bill which is now before us is only second-
ary in importance to any measure, saving those
which I have already alluded to.
It is true, sir, that no partisan press has her-
alded forth its advent. It is true that no popular
tumult has given it a noted and a wide-spread rep-
utation; its object and its purport have only been
advocated periodically, when some sad, afflicting,
and dire steamboat calamity was visited upon us.
Then there would be a spasmodic action on the
part of the public sentiment and the public press
to prevent these steamboat abuses, which would
scarcely last longer than the dying groans of those
who had fallen victims either to the avarice,cupid-
ity, or criminal negligence of the steamboat mo-
nopolies that are now looming up in our midst,
and who, by their ill-gotten gains, have finally
brcome so wealthy, so powerful,as to deal with
impunity in the safety and life of all who may,
by force "of circumstances or by chance, commit
themselves to their care.
Now, sir, whilst this whole Union is mourning
over those who have fallen upon the battle-field of
Kansas in the advocacy of their respective doc-
trines, whilst morality and decency are crying
aloud and calling forredressagainst the polygamy
of Mormonism, whilst the avowed advocates of
law and order are fiercely denouncing fillibuster-
ism, and lamenting over the sad fate of those who
have fallen bravely and gallantly upon Nicaragua's
soil, where has been the tear yet shed, the sym-
pathy yet manifested by this body, for those who
have been consigned to the watery caverns of the
sullen deep ?
Coming from a constituency that is immedi-
ately and directly interested in this subject, who
are "compelled alone to confine themselves to an
oceanic route for the want of a better, I conceive
it to be a duty which I owe them as their Repre-
sentative, to place the object and intent of this
bill m a true and proper light before you. I shall,
therefore, briefly review those provisions which
have reference to ocean steamers, and endeavor
to show the effects and consequences that have
already ensued for the want of proper congres-
sional legislation on this subject,and the benefits
and advantages that will inevitably follow by the
passage of the bill. In doing this, I will have to
ask your kind indulgence, as these matters are
not surrounded with the fascinating charms of a
political or constitutional question, but arc merely
statistical and dry in their character.
I will go back as far as the year 1851, and will
enumerate a number of steam vessels that have
been wrecked, lives thathave been sacrificed, and
treasures that have been lost, all attributable,as I
sincerely believe, to the want of such a bill as is
now before you.
