my heartfelt thanks for their noble behavior, and pray that God and their country may add to the rewards which flow from the consciousness of duty performed, and that the time may speedily come when under the flag of a nation one and indivisible benign peace may again smile on us amid the endearments of home and family.

But our victory has cost us the lives of 315 brave officers and soldiers, besides the wounded. Words of praise cannot reach those who died for their country in this battle, but they console and encourage the living. The memory of the brave Hackleman, the chivalrous Kirby Smith,* the true and noble Colonels Thrush, Baker,* and Mills,* and Captain Guy C. Ward, with many others, live with us and in the memory of a free people, while history will inscribe their names among its heroes.
