Ho, ojjv fl^ye.
sachusetta, which will lend us to believe that she
will not abide by that result? I say there is
nothing ia the history of the State of Missis-
sippi, or of South Carolina, early or recent, which
makes Massachusetts desirous of emulating their
example. I. sir, agree with the South Carolina
authority I have quoted here ia regard to the
legislation of Massachusetts.
Sir, my time is passing 9.way, and I must has-
ten on. The State of Massachusetts is the guard-
ian of the rights of her citizens and of the in-
habitants within her border line. If her citi-
zens go beyond the line, into distant lands or
upon the ocean, then they look to the Federal
arm for protection. But old Massachusetts is the
State which is to secure to her citizens the ines-
timable blessing of trial by jury, and the writ of
habeas corpus. All these things must come from
her, and not from the Federal Government. I
believe, with her great statesmen and with her
people, that the fugitive slave law is unconstitu-
tional. Mr. Webster, as an original question,
thought it was not constitutional; Mr. Rantoul,
& brilliant statesman of Massachusetts, said the
same thing; they both thought that the clause of
the Constitution was addressed to the States.
Mr. Webster bowed to the decision of the Su-
preme Court in the Prigg case ; Mr. Rantoul did
not. Massachusetts believes it to be unconstitu-
tional; but whether it be constitutional or not, she
means, so long as the Federal Government un-
dertakes to execute that law, that the. Federal
government shall do it with its own instruments,
vile or otherwise. She s,avs that no one clothed
with her authority shall do anything tp help ia
it so long as the Federal Government undertakes,;
to do it. But, sir, I pass from this. I
I did intend to reply seriatim to all the attacks,!
which have heen made upon the State, but,Lhave
ijot half time enough. The gentleman from Mia- j
eissippi, [Mr. Bsnkptt,] after enumerating a
treat many things he desired. Massachusetts.to '
0, said, amongst, other things, that aihe mu&t,
tear out. of hep, sta^ute-boolf this personal liberty
law. yy,hen die fed, done that, and a. variety of-
other things, too numerous to mention, then he
said " the South, would; forgive Massachusetts. 'J i
The South forgive Massachusetts,! Sir, forgive-
ness is. attribute of Pivinitv. The South, has,
it not. Sir, forgiveness is a higher quality than
justice, even. The South—I mean the sla,ve.
power—cannot comprehend, it. Sir, Massachu-
setts has. already forgiven the South too. many,
debts, and too many insults. If w;e should, do,
all the things the gentleman flrpm Mississippi,
desired, us to do, then the gentlemap from Ala-
bama, [Mr. SftORTEB,] comes in, and insists, that.
Massachusetts shall dp a gre^t, variety of ot^erl
things before the South probably will.forgive her.
Among other things, he desired, that M^sachu.-
sptts should, blot out the fact that. General Hull.,
who surrendered, Detroit, had his, home! in .Mas-
sachusetts,. Why, no, sir-; slje dpest. not, desire,
even to do that, for then she would, hayq to blot
Wt. the., fact that hi#. gpjj&flt s^pp tad, his, home
%rs—tha,t gaPfint sop, wha. fell fighting fo.r Ms,

The gentleman, degires, also, thaf we should,
blot out. the. history of the.connection, of, Mas s*-

do that. S,he cannot, so. dim 'he, lustre of. the,
American, arms, She cannot, so. wrong the, R&-
tublic. Where, then, w.ould be your, great sea-
 hts ? Wliere, then, would he the glory of " Old

swarmed, from all her, bays, and aft h,er, ports,

P<?nses, an,d( lias, nof.y^t, befin p.aj^efltjrely from
tfte Irea^ury, of the. The, enei^vy hove^d
as the stars. He looked on that warlike land,
and the memory of the old§n time came Back
upon him. He remembered how, more than forty
years before, he had trod on that soi],; he remem-
bered how vauntingly he. invaded it, ajid how
speedily lie left it. He turned his glasses towards
it, and beheld it§ people rushing from 'he mount-
ains to the sea to defend it; aijd he dared not
atta,ck it. Its capital stood ip the? salt sea spray,
yet he could not take it. He sailed south, where
there was another capita,!, not far from where we
now; stand, forty miles from the sea. A, few stag-
gering, worn-out sailors and, soldiers came here.
They took it. How it was"defended let the heroes
of Jjladepsburg answer! [Laughter.]
Sir, the genTlemafl from Sout£'Carolina [Mr.,
?kit;t] m&de a speech.;, and, if,I may be allowed
to coin a word, I will say it had, more canJar\Jceri
osity in it than any speech. I ever' hea^a on. this,
flpor. [Renewed laughter.] It was^certainly very
eloquent in some portions—very ^oaueni, inr
deed, foe the gentleman has indisgytajjly an elo-
quent utterance, and an eloquent temperament.
I do. not wish to criticise it much^but it opens in.
the most extraordinary manner,'vyi'th a "weird
torchlight," andt then he introduces a deafl man, ,
apd.then he galvanizes, him/and puts liiijri in t^ai
chair, and. then, he makejs him, "point his, cold'
finger" ground this £(all. why, it ai.most fright-
en snje. to. allude to, it. Arjd then, he turns it into,
a. thea,ter, and then he changes or transmogrir
pnies the gentleman, from, Indiana, [Ajlr. C^lpax,].
who h^s just sgoi$ei), into a,' snakie, apd, maizes,
him " wriggle tip tp.tjie footlightsi'* and then he.

about rotting pn dead! seas. He calls, our party
atone time a ''toad,"and thenhe callsjta " liz-
ard;," " and more, which q'en to mention, yould
be unlawful." Sir. l^is rhetoric se'eina tp have

Let him go. there, and, even after, all he said, he.
may speak to those men, and, convince them, if
he can, of their starving cpnditipn. I will guar-
antee his perspnal safety. I believe, the people,
of Massachusetts woulq pour forth their; heart's,
blopd to protect eyen him in the right pf freedom
of speech.; a,nd that is. saying a great deal aftei;
aH that has happened.' Let him go to, the great
county of Worcester—that beehive of operatives,
apd. Abolitionists, as it has been, called, and he,
will find the annual product of that county greater
in proportion, to the popujation than that of any
other equal population in the world, as will, be.
found by reference, to a recent speech of ex-Gov.-.-
ernor Boutwell, of our State. The next county,.
I. believe, it), respect tq the amount of prpducts
in proportion to population, is aWay, up in Ver-
mont. Sir, let him go. and took at these men-^-
these Abolitionists who, we are told, meddle with,
everybody's business but their own. They cer-
tainly take time enough to attend to their own
business, to accomplish these results/which. I haye
named.
The gentleman broke out in an exceedingly
explosive question, something like this: 1 do not,
know if my mempry can do justice to the lan-
guage of| the gentleman, but it; wan something
like this: " Did, not the South equally with the,
North bare her forehead to the god of battles?'*
f answer plainly, No, sir, she did not; she did,
not. Sir, Massachusetts furnished more men in
the Revolution than the whole South together,'
and rnor,e.by ten-fold than South Carolina. I am!
not including, of course, the militia—the con-
jectured militia furnished' by that State. There
is no proof that they were ever engaged in any'
battle. I mean the regulars; and I say that Mas-
sachusetts furnished, more' than ten times as.
many men as South Carolina. I say, on the'
authority of a, standard historian, once a mem-
ber of this House, (Mr. Sabine, in his History of
the Loyalists,) that more New Englandmen now
lip buried in the soil of South Carolina than there
were of South. Carolinians, wljo. left their State
to fight, the battles of the country. I, say, wherv
General Lincoln was defending Charleston, he
was compellfid to give up its defense because the,
people of'that, city wonljd not fight. WJlien Gen-
eral Grpepe, that R^iode.IsJand blacksmith, took ■
command of the southern.army, South Carolina!
had not a Federal soldier in t)ie field: and the peo-
ple of that. State' would' not furnish supplies to
his tguqy; \sjhil£ the British army in the State!
w,ere furftished with.supplies almpst exclusively
from the people of South Carolina. While the
American army could not be'recruited, the,ranks.
of, the British army, were rapidly fillpd ^from" that
Sfate. The British post of;Ninety.-Six was gar-,
risojicd'.almbst exclusiyely from South' Carolina.'
IJawdon.'s reserve corps was made up almost en-
tirely by.South Carolinians! Of the eigh t hundred}
prisoners who were taken at the battje of Kijig's
Mountain—of-which we have heard, so, much—.'
seven hundred of theip, were southern Tories,
The Maryland mengalned the laurels of the Cow-
, pens. Kehtuckians, Yirginiaag,and'North Car-
olinians, gained the Wtle of Kinff.'s Mountain.
Few South Carolinians fought in "the battles, of
Eutaw, Guilford, &c. They'were chiefly fought
by, men out of South Carolina; and they would1
have won greater fame and brighter laurels, if
they had not been opposed.chiefly by-the citizens
of the soil. Well might the British commander
boast that he had. reduced South Carolina into
allegiance.
But, sir, I will not- proceed further with this
history, out of regard for the fame of our common
country; out of regard for the patriots—the Sump-
ters, the Marions, the Rutledges, the Finckneys,
the Haynea—truer patriots, if possible, than-those
ofany other.Stfttft. Out.Qfregardifacthese.iaen,
