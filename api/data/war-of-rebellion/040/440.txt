HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,May 7, 1863 - 10.30 p. m.

General HERMAN HAUPT,

Superintendent Military Railroads:

General Stoneman is approaching Rappahannock Station, after having performed most splendid service. He will arrive there to-morrow and is much exhausted. His command must have subsistence and forage at once. I have ordered Captain Ferguson to call on you for trains to run out to the river with supplies. General Hooker requests that extraordinary exertions be made to have them meet him there to-morrow. He knows he can rely on you. I beg you to cause the trains to be in motion early. Stoneman has cut the rebel communication in every direction.
