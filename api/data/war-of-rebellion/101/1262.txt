HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF WEST MISSISSIPPI,New Orleans, La., March 26, 1865.

Major General C. C. WASHBURN,

Commanding District of West Tennessee:

GENERAL: In a letter from these headquarters of March 4 Major-General Dana was requested to send several cavalry regiments to this place. Among that number was the First Wisconsin Cavalry. This was a mistake; it should have been the First Iowa Cavalry. In the absence of the major-general commanding, I have the honor to request that you now send the First Iowa Cavalry to report to Major-General Grierson at this place.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

C. H. DYER,

Captain and Assistant Adjutant-General.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF WEST MISSISSIPPI,New Orleans, La., March 26, 1865.

Major General J. J. REYNOLDS,

Commanding Department of Arkansas:

GENERAL: General Grierson, who is now organizing a cavalry corps for this military division, requires a battery for one of the divisions. General West reports that Captain Hadley's battery is fully equipped to operate with cavalry. If you can spare this battery, will you please order it to this city to report to General Grierson. General Canby is now absent, somewhere near Mobile. There has been some little skirmishing up to the 23rd instant, but no heavy fighting.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

C. H. DYER,

Captain and Assistant Adjutant-General.

BONNET CARRE, March 26, 1865.
