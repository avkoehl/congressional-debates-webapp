CIVIL APPROPRIATION BILL.
Mr. SHERMAN. I am directed by the Com-
mittee on Finance, to whom was referred the bill
(H. R. No. 527) making appropriations for sundry
civil expenses of Government for the year end-
ing the 30th of June, 1865, to report it back with
amendments. As these amendments are compara-
tively few and simple, and this is the last of the
appropriation bills, I ask that without printing the
amendments the bill be set down as the special
order for one o'clock to-day.
Mr. SUMNER. Does the Senator think it ad-
visable to proceed with that bill so soon? Is it
not customary to keep it till the very close of the
session ?
Mr. SEIERMAN. It is the lastofehe regular
appropriation bills.
Mr. SUMNER, t understand that, and on
that very account it should be kept to the last.
We do not know but during the last week it may
be desirable to add to the bill.
Mr. SHERMAN. The session has ap-
proached such apeiiod that I think the bill ought
to be considered in the Senate and sent back to
tly House of Repivsentatives;itcan be kept there,
and they can propose amendments to ouramend-
ments; so that the matter v. ill be open. As it is a
regular appropriation bill, I think if better to act
upon it before the revenue bill is reported hack.
The PRESIDENT j)ro tempore. It requires
unanimous consent to consider the bill to-day.
The Chair hears no objection.
Mr. SHERMAN. 1 now move that the bill be
made the special order for one o'clock to-day.
The motion was agreed to, two thirds concur-
ring thcrem.
