with the banks It is easy to perceive that this
fiaud could goon some time without detection 1
believe near $300,000 of the fraud occurred in this
way.
2 Owing to the peculiar manner in which cer-
tain funds came into the hands ot the collector at
New York, (and perhaps other ports,) and to the
right which ne had to ietain a portion of those
funds in his hanJs, they were kept out of sight,
and indeed out of tne knowledge of the Treasuiy
Department This occurs in this way When
an importing merehan' receives from his vessel a
cargo of goods, upon which the duties have to be
paid in cash, in advance, the duty on which may
be known, that is, the class oí goods and the
amount of duty on that particular class may be
known, but it may take some time to calculate and
make up the amount of duty that may be due on
the whole The merchant, desirous to have the
use of his goods, agiees with the collector to pay
what the duties, when made up, will probably
amount to The collector, in this case, generally
receives a sum amounting to more than the duties
when made up In thi  he is justifiable, as he is
bound to look to the security and interest of the
Government He retains m his hands what he
supposes may be the overplus between what he
has received and what may really be found to be
due when the account is made up Transactions
of this character are of every day's occurrence
The sum thus retained is not reported (or may
not be, and was not in Swartwout's case) to the
Treasuiy, but was kept (as pietended) for the pur
pose of paying back to the meichant what was due
him I his surplus—if it may be so called—m
Swartwout's case, has constituted, at all times, a
large standing fund, a part of which, it is easy to
peiceive, might be abstracted without the knowl-
edge of any person but the collector himself, with-
out the knowledge of the Secietaiy of the Treas-
ury, or any officer of his immediate Department
Ihi  fund, I believe, is called " cash deposited to
meet unasceitamed duties " Fiom tbi3 iund
Swartwout abstracted about $150,000
3   " Duties paid under protects " This const!
tutes a fund which puts it in the power of the col-
lector to defraud the Government out of almost any
sum It is as follows An impelling meichant
has received a caigo oí goods (on which cash is
payable or demand) of a particulai class, and,
consequently, the subjects of higher duties, so
supposes the collectoi The meichant contends
that his goods arenot of such atlass, thecollector
contends they are, and demands the duty due on
such goods The men hant, in order to avail him-
self of the use and piaetical benefit of his goods,
pays the collector the amount he demands, but, at
the same time, enters his protest, and commences
suit for what he supposeb he has overpaid The
collector, not knowing what the result of the suit
may be, and not knowing whether or not he would
recover the amount in controversy from the Gov
eminent should he pay it over to the credit oí the
Uieasurer ot the United States, retains it in his
hands for his own safety—and I believe the Uni-
ted States district couit has decided that he has a
right so to do, until a legal decision is had Should
he pay the money in protest ovei to the Govern-
ment on its reception, and the suit should termin-
ate in favor of the merchant, it has been doubted if
he could get relief in any other way than through
Congress—a slow method, and somewhat uncer-
tain—before which an execution might sweep from
under him his whole property 1 rom this fund
ir is supposed that Swartwout abstracted about
$150,000 or$200,000, which he had it in his power
to do without the knowledge of the Treasuiy De-
partment, or the means of detection
4    When the banks suspended payments, there
were in number of merchant's bonds ten thousand
due for duties, and the amount due on these was
upwards of five millions of dollars The bonds
were withdrawn from the banks, and an extension
given by the Secretary of the Treasury, in conse
quence of the pecuniary embarrassments conse-
quent upon the suspension by the banks At the
extra session Congress gave an additional exten-
sion oí nine months, as well upon tho e bonds on
which suit had been commenced as those on which
it had not The w thdiawal of the oonds from the
banks, the extension of credit given on them, the
vast amount due, and the great numoer of bonds
thrown into the collector's office, gave a new di-
rection and threw all the business into such con-
fusion, that it seems by the letter of Mr Fleming,
impossible to know, for a time, in what situation
the bonds and the business of the office were, and
if the officers themselves of the custom house
could not tell in what situation things were re-
lating to the duties and bonds, how was it possible
for the Treasury Department to know anything
about it, or to know so much as to enable it to
detect the frauds which Swartwout was then daily
and hourly committing' Tne act of the with-
drawal of the bonds, and their extension, and the
confusion thereupon, not only put it in the power
of Swartwout to commitfrauds, but obstructed the
channels through which the information would
have flown to the Secretary, of the fact of frauds
being committed, and consequently of the power
of detecting them
5 The collector is bound to render quarterly
accounts to the Treasury, but he has three months
after the expiration of each quarter, to make up
his accounts, and three months after the expira-
tion of his term of office before he can be consid-
ered published or prosecuted as a publicdefaulter
Let us see to what extent ihis legal privilege may
have operated to the fraudulent purposes of Swart-
wout, and to the embarrassment of the Secretary
of the Treasury to detect his frauds The banks
suspended payment on May 11, 1837 Swart-
wout's time expired on the 28th of March, 1838
Then it is found that he had the advantage of
the possession of the bonds to the amount of
$5 000,000 The advantage of the extension
given, (advantage, because the Secietary of the
iieasury was thereby prevented from detecting
him,) and all the confusion and embarrassment
thereupon 1 say he had the advantage of all
these for upwards of ten months next from the
28ih of March He had three months before he
could be called to a settlement, at the expiration
of which time he was called upon for a settlement
by the First Auditoi of the Tieasury, but no set-
tlement was obtained Immediately notice was
given to his bondsmen, about which time Swart-
wout sailed foi England, having abstracted of the
public money upwaids of fiveoi six hundied thou-
sand dollar  by these last advantages winch the
law afforded him Three months to make up his
accounts, the suspension of specie payments by
the banks, and the confusion and embanassment
produced by that, and the withdrawal of the bonds,
and the actual possession of the bonds gave him
Now, sn , 1 ask, what vigilance, other than that
which has nevei been thought of since the begin
mug of this Government, could have been piac
ticed by the Secretaiy of the Treasury, to have
delected Swaitwout's frauds, or to have saved the
Government fiom those which were practiced by
the advantages which the policy of the Govern-
ment and the laws gave the collector, and over
which the Secretary had no control' Sir, to cen
sine the Secretaiy of the Treasury for a ladies in
Swartwout's frauds istocensuie him for the want
of a vigilance which no one ever dreamed of to this
time lo censure him for a neglect of duty in this
case is doing him the base injustice of censuring
him for the neglect of that which the law, and
the policy of this Government, and frauds of the
ban ks with which its Treasury has been connected,
put it out of his power to perform So soon as
the time arrived for the Secretary to act, every
vigilance was used to bring Swartwout to settle-
ment, and after he had absconded, every vig.lance
was used, and is using, to detect the extent of his
frauds and to secure the Government Sir, to
charge the Secretary with conniving at Swart-
wout's frauds, or any other defaulter's frauds, or
even with culpable neglect of official vigilance, is
charging him with that of which he is not guilty
] It is chaiging mm with that which his high char-
1 acter as an honorable man, his vigilance and capa-
| city as a public officer, and his reputation as a
I patriot and friend to his country,ought to exempt
\ him And fuither, I look upon such charges as a
1 slander from which the laws of our country ought
' to protect him, a  well in his individual as in his
official chaiacter Sir, this wai upon the Secretary
of the Treasury is but one of the thousand means
used to break uown the Administration All that
can be made out of the Swartwout defalcation will
be used to the greatest possible extent to prostrate
the Administration, and to blight the popular con-
fidence in it
It seems, it and other defalcations are to be used
as a two edged sword, that is to destroy the con-
fidence of the people in the Administration by the
cry of corruption and fraud, and to bankrupt the
Tieasury for the same pmpose, by extravagance
and profligacy in punting tons of worthless, and
worse than useless document , relatirg to those
defalcations Sir, in character with this effort we
saw a resolution introduced the other dav , and
carried, authorizing and requiring the printing of
twenty thousand copies of a document purporting
to be a report of defalcations and defaulters, with
the correspondence of the Secretary of the Treas-
ury with the supposed defaulters Sir, I have
stated before that this document purports to be
what it is not It contains the correspondence of
the Secretary of the Treasury, but it does not
contain many of the answers and final settlements
of and with those that are represented to be de-
faulters Many persons, living and dead, are
represented in that document to be defaulters who
do not owe the Government a dollar, and some
of them,I am told, have just, butunsettled,claims
against the Government Sir, to publish it to the
extent of the resolution, was promulgating, in
many instances, a falsehood upon the living and
slanders upon the memory of the dead
But, sir, I have another objection to printing
this document It will involve a criminal profli-
gacy m expenditure of fifteen or twenty thousand
dollars, which can answer no other purpose than
to put so much money into the pocket of the
printer It will, sir, be putting so much money
into the hands of those whom I consider more
worthless, if possible, than the purpose for which
the expenditure would be made I mean the mort-
gagor and pliant vassal of the bank, the editor of the
National Intelligencer, and his cat's paw and tool,
the editor of the Madisonian, the Conservative '
But, sir, these profligate expenditures and worth-
less appropuations can go on so far as resolu-
tions of this House can authorize them There
is no check here The Democracy are in the
minority The united strength of the Whiis and
Conservatives make a majority They diffpr in
name, but not in principle Conservatism is but
another name for Whiggery, and both but other
names for Fedeia'ism They are like man and
wife They are joined in the holy bands of po
litical wedlock They are flesh of one flesh, blood
of one blood, and bone of one bone They will
live togethei until separated by death Those
whom the banks have joined together, let no man
put asunder
These evils are with the people They can
remedy them, all I can do is to protest against
them, which I will do while I have a tongue to
speak and a hand to write
Cach of these leasons constituted a sufficient
objection with me for voting against the resolution
to print that document, and I repeat, that I look
upon such efforts to squander the public treasure,
and to bankrupt the nation, as done with a view
to break down the Administration, and destroy
the Democratic party
But, sn, what could induce the Secretary to
connive at the frauds of Swartwout' He was no
friend to the Administration or to the Democracy
He was a Conservative in theory and practice,
and, consequently, like all other Conservatives,
opposed to both I repeat, what ground is there
to suppose that the Secretary of the Treasury, or
any other individual of the Democracy concerned
in the administration of the Government, would
connive at the frauds of Swartwout, oi any other *
Conservative' Why, sir, above all isms on the
face of the earth, Conservatism is the last and tail-
I end ism Yes, sir, in the estimation of this Ad-
ministration, Conservatism is sunk deeper in base
I iniquity, foul corruption, and black hypocrisy,
than even modern Whiggery itself But, in addi-
tion to this, Swartwout was conceived in em,
brought forth m iniquity, and reared in fraud
His father was a base defaulter in Mr Monroe's
administration
It may be asked why General Jackson would
nominate such a man, with such native suspicions
surrounding him'   I answer, why did a Whig
Senate confirm the nomination of a man who had
I such native suspicions surrounding him'   Why,
