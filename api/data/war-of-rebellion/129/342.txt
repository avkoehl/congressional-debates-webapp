know that with the resources in men and means and the advantages for defense of their extensive department, employed with energy and skill, the attempt to subdue a people as brave and determined as themselves is one of folly and madness. They endure with fortitude their temporary ills, await with patience the hour of approaching retribution, and anticipate with confidence the overthrow of their hateful enemies and their final disgraceful expulsion or destruction. In view of the means at command, the invincible spirit of the people, rs, and the approved prowess of their soldiers, the Trans-Mississippi Department may be regarded as, no less than the States of the Confederacy east, prepared against the utmost efforts of their malignant enemies for successful defense, and assured of ultimate triumph.

Attention is invited to the accompanying report of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs. * Credit is due to that officer for the dangers and privations he has endured in twice visiting the distant abodes of the Indian tribes. His presence and influence among them have proved salutary in affording encouragement and maintaining fidelity. It is important they should be dealt with in a spirit of consideration and liberality. They should not suffer from the changes which have been made in our financial system, the necessity and wisdom of which they cannot be expected to have foreseen or now to understand. The recommendation, therefore, by the Commissioner of timely legislation to authorize substitution of the new currency for the old, without loss to them, is approved and seconded. The great body of the Indians, notwithstanding their losses, are attached to the Confederacy and confident in its fortunes, and with reasonable consideration for their peculiar wants and feelings may easily be retained in amity and fidelity.

We have now entered upon the fourth year of the war, and the end is not yet. Originating in the wrong and perfidy of our enemies, it is continued through their rage and hate. We have asked and seek only peace and separation from them. They profess to enforce a detested union, and wage really a war of conquest and extermination. Prostrating their own Constitution and surrendering their liberties, they are intent only to crush ours. A campaign of momentous events is impending on us. For it our people stand prepared and resolute. Nor have their representatives proved unworthy exponents of their indomitable purpose and self-sacrificing patriotism. The measures of the late Congress, considered as a combined system, are characterized by high resolve and enlarged statesmanship. They concentrate the energies and resources and command the men and property of the Confederacy in larger measure than have ever been done by any government. The whole male population capable of arms, from seventeen to fifty, are either marshaled to the field or organized in reserves, ready to be summoned. One-third of the currency of the Confederacy has been annulled, and taxation of unprecedented amount has been exacted from all values. One-tenth of productions in kind has been claimed without pay, and besides, the residue and all property has been subjected to seizure and conversion for public use at moderate rates of just compensation. The railroads, the great means of internal trade and communication, are made primarily sub-servient to the necessities of Government. Even the great writ of personal liberty is suspended in cases requisite to preclude evasion
