HEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSOURI, June 3, 1865-10. 05 p. m.

Major-General DODGE, Fort Leavenworth:

Apprehensions are expressed by citizens of Mexico, on the North Missouri Railroad, that the company of Missouri State Militia stationed there will interfere in the election on Tuesday next. It is reported to me that the soldiers have threatened to do so. Please give such orders as will prevent the possibility of the interference of any troops in your department with any such matters either by word or deed.

JOHN. POPE,Major-General.

FORT LEAVENWORTH, KANS., June 3, 1865.

Major-General POPE:

Dispatch about Mexico received. Have instructed General Spalding, and also all the district commanders in Missouri, not to allow officers or soldiers to interfere in the election in any way, and referred them to the laws of Congress relating to it.

G. M. DODGE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSOURI, Saint Louis, Mo., June 3, 1865.

Major General G. M. DODGE, Fort Leavenworth, Kans.:

GENERAL: I transmit inclosed copy of a letter just received from Judge Hubbard, of Iowa. * Sully's cavalry, in consequence of stampede in Minnesota, is obliged to go to Devil's Lake. You must deal with these Indians in the Black Hills and establish the post of Powder River. I have sent up Michigan brigade, and will send one and perhaps two more cavalry regiments to you. It is absolutely essential, for reasons that will suggest themselves to you, that this Indian force in Black Hills be routed as soon as possible. The wagon road parties along the Niobrara and Little Cheyenne Rivers will not otherwise be able to carry on their work. You know how important these roads are and how deep the interest in Iowa in their completion. I have assured Judge Hubbard that you will clear out those Indians. Do not, therefore, fail to do it.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,JOHN. POPE,

Major-General, Commanding.

[Indorsement.]
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE MISSOURI, Fort Leavenworth, June 6, 1865.

Respectfully referred to Brigadier General P. E. Conner, commanding District of the Plains.

It is very important that we should get after these Indians in Black Hills and whip them. I do not consider the wagon route safe, now that Sully has gone, until these Indians are used up. If necessary, an expedition could go there and return before the main expedition is made.

G. M. DODGE,Major-General.
