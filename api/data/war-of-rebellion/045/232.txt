and Major-General COUCH, Harrisburg:

Following just received from New Creek: A German, formerly my groom, left Williamsport Thursday, and reports that General Rodes was encamped on the Virginia side, opposite that place, with 20, 000 troops; that General Jenkins with his forces was at Hagerstown, and that large numbers of horses were being brought in from Pennsylvania. This is unquestionably reliable excepting as to the number of Rodes' force.

Lieutenant Colonel DONN PIATT,

Chief of Staff, Baltimore:

Colonel Thoburn reports his arrival at Cumberland Enemy retreated via Paw Paw and Bloomery Gap. Cavalry scouts report from Rommey; no enemy there. Could hear of no advance by way of Winchester. General Averell reports that, owing to scarcity of horseshoes and workmen, he will not be able to move for a day or two. Had he been here, we would not have allowed Imboden to escape. I am strengthening my position, and putting my troops in the best possible condition. Sent off all of Milroy's stragglers to Bedford this morning.

B. F. KELLEY,

Brigadier-General.
