of War having instructed me to give them different orders. If nothing occurs to prevent it, I will probably be at Lewisburg Monday night, the 18th instant.

The flour I ordered forward to you, and which now must be nearly half-way to Lewisburg, together with the bread captured at Summerville, ought to be enough for all the troops until additional rations can be forwarded. Employ all the wagons I have sent forward in bringing up rations, if necessary.

Very respectfully and truly,

SAM. JONES,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF WESTERN VIRGINIA,Dublin, May 16, 1863.

Colonel JOHN MCCAUSLAND,

Commanding Fourth Brigade, Princeton:

COLONEL: In consequence of orders just received from the Secretary of War, Brigadier Gens. W. E. Jones and Imboden will not be able to make the move to the Kanawha, as I informed you they would in my letter of the 14th instant. I may, however, send other troops to that point to co-operate with you. You will, therefore, continue your movement to Fayetteville, and take advantage of any move the enemy may make in the way of detachments from that point. But it will be necessary that you use increased precaution in your movements about Fayetteville, in consequence of the diversion of W. E. Jones' and Imboden's troops. The enemy evacuated Summerville on or about the 13th instant, on the approach of Jones and Imboden, and retreated down the Kanawha. It is not at all improbable that all or a part of the enemy's troops will be drawn in from Fayetteville. I will keep you informed, and give you such instructions as future developments may render necessary.

Call on the commissary at the Narrows for such supplies as you need. Additional transportation has been sent to the front, and the quartermaster at the Narrows will be able, with the aid of your own wagons, to keep you supplied.

Establish a line of couriers by detail from your cavalry company, to enable you to communicate with me every day.

Very respectfully, &amp;c.,

SAM. JONES,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF WESTERN VIRGINIA,Dublin, May 16, 1863.

Honorable JAMES A. SEDDON:

Your telegram received. Brigadier Gens. W. E. Jones and Imboden will be ordered as you direct. They are expected to reach Lewisburg with their commands to-morrow.

The enemy had re-enforced Summerville to intercept them, but evacuated the place on the approach of our men.

I have unofficial, but what I regard as reliable, information that they have brought out nearly 5,000 head of cattle. Between 1,100 and 1,200 had arrived in Greenbrier.

SAM. JONES,

Major-General.
