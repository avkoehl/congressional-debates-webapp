while our own massed batteries were belching out their contents in front of and over it. The roar of artillery was terrific. The smoke from our own pieces and the bursting shell of the enemy at times obscured the line from view. By some wonderful Providence but three men of the brigade were killed here by the enemy's shells.

About dark, and when the enemy were driven upon our left, the brigade was advanced by General Palmer, he gallantly leading two regiments, the Thirty-first Indiana and Ninetieth Ohio, to the point of woods, a half mile to the front and left of our artillery position,and in line with our advance on the left, across the creek. I followed rapidly with the residue of the brigade across the open field to the general's right, and on line with him. Knowing nearly the position of a masked battery of the enemy hid by a crest in the field, I ordered the men to cheer loudly as we approached the latter. It had now become dark. As the noise of the last cheer died away, the enemy opened a fire of shrapnel from four small guns. The line immediately laid down under shelter of the crest, and for some thirty minutes the enemy continued to play at us. His shot passed just over our heads and struck the ground not to exceed 100 feet to the rear of our line.

Only a single casualty occurred here-the death of one man, struck by a shell. He was a straggler, not connected with my command, who was attempting to get to the rear. A strong picket, from my brigade was posted in the wood and across the field, and the residue brought back to camp near the artillery. The latter position was maintained by the brigade until the evacuation of the enemy.

The following statement, condensed from the report of the medical officer of my staff, and the returns of the regimental commanders, exhibits the casualties of the brigade and battery, to wit:

It may be observed that the above statement includes as wounded only those disabled from duty; slight hurts and trivial injuries are not included. Of those rated as missing, about one-half the number are stated by their officers to have been captured by the enemy in the battle of the 31st ultimo. The number of casualties, it will be noted, reaches nearly one-third of my effective strength.

Herewith are inclosed the reports of Colonel Enyart, Sedgewick, Osborn, and Ross, commanding the various regiments of the brigade,
