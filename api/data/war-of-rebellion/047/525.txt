HDQRS. DEPT. CAROLINA, GEORGIA, AND FLORIDA,Charleston, S. C., November 25, 1863.

Mr. THEODORE STONEY,

Sec. and Treas. Southern Torpedo Co., Charleston, S. C.:

SIR: Your letter of the 23rd instant, announcing the formation of a Southern Torpedo Company, and asking my "official sanction and aid in pressing the undertaking to rapid completion," has been received. Allow me to express my gratification at the organization of such a company, which I trust will meet with ample success in driving from our coast the enemy's blockaders. Believe me, it is a step in the right direction. For over one year I have endeavored in vain to induce our Government to undertake the construction of a shot-proof sea-going steamer, armed with Captain F. D. Lee's repeating torpedo apparatus.

By the decision of the so-called Earl Russell, there can be difficulty in having vessels built in England as shot-proof blockade runners, which can be armed, as desired at sea or in Charleston Harbor. The gallant attempt of the David against the New Ironside shows what can be accomplished by such a method of naval warfare. There can be no doubt now that she has been so seriously injured as to be unable to participate further in the enemy's bombardment of Sumter.

In conclusion, I will be most happy to afford the company all the facilities in my power for carrying into effect their proposed planks and operations, and any fortune smile on their patriotic efforts.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. T. BEAUREGARD,

General, Commanding.

C. S. ENGINEER'S OFFICE,

Colonel D. B. HARRIS,

Chief Engineer:

COLONEL: In compliance with your directions, I have to report there are now only three impressing agents of the department, viz, Colonel A. F. Browning, Charleston and Colleton districts; Mr. Lewis Simons, district bordering on Cooper River; Mr. R. Ragin Briggs, Clarendon district. They have had definite and urgent instructions repeated to the. Two others have recently been discharged. The commanding general directed or requested the officer in charge of conscripts at Columbia to order impressment, through his enrolling officers, throughout the State. These latter have received their instructions through that source, but have several times communicated with me, for instruction, which have been given in accordance with the order of the commanding general. Some of the agents have done their duty. I inclose the statement of receipt of negroes by regular call and agents.
