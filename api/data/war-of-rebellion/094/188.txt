HDQRS. CAVALRY CORPS, MIL. DIV. OF THE MISSISSIPPI,Nashville, December 14, 1864-11.40 p. m.

Captain RAMSEY,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

CAPTAIN: The two telegrams* from Gallatin are received, but as the second is strongly confirmatory of the first, and there seems to be no doubt of the presence of the enemy on the road, i hesitate to collect the Fourth Ohio and the squadron at Gallatin unless the major-general commanding still wishes it. It seems to me the force under General McCook must be able to drive off Lyon, and that he will be after him before the troops scattered between here and Gallatin can do any good. Be good enough to inform me by return messenger whether I shall send any orders to the latter.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. H. WILSON,

Brevet Major-General.

[Indorsement.]
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,Nashville, December 14, 1864.

Respectfully returned to Major-General Wilson, commanding Cavalry Corps.

The major-general commanding is of the opinion that the force alluded to as on the railroad is not Lyon at all, but a party of guerrillas, which can be driven off by he squadron of cavalry now at Gallatin, with the troops ordered to be sent from Gallatin.

By command of Major-General Thomas:

ROBT. H. RAMSEY,
