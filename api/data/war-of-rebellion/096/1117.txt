Colonel ANDERSON,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

The officer sent down to examine vessels inside reports as follows: Seventeen steamer inside the Rip-five of them side-wheel, the others propellers; one only seems to be an iron-clad. On account of the weather, the officer could see but what was near Battery Lamb and to New Inlet; what is below toward Smithville is not ascertained. I will inform you further when possible. Up to this time all quite with me.

HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF NORTH CAROLINA, Wilmington, January 20, 1865.

Brigadier-General HEBERT,Commanding, &amp;c., Fort Anderson:

GENERAL: The commanding general directs me to communicate to you confidentially his views upon the position you now hold and the possible movements of the enemy. If the enemy's gun-boats should pass Fort Anderson there will be no necessity for its immediate evacuation; but you will have to be vigilant and take care, by means of your scouts nd cavalry, that their infantry does not move around or land above you. In case, however, the passage by Fort Anderson should be affected, and a serious infantry movement compromising your position be attempted, it is the design of the general that your troops should retire attempted, it is the design of the general that your troops should retire to the line of Town Creek corresponding with the line of Barnard's Creek, which it is intended ultimately to adopt on this side of the river. but unless telegraphic communication is interrupted, or the necessity is immediate to save your command, you will not give up your present position without further orders from these headquarters.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

ARCHER ANDERSON,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
