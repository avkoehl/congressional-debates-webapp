MONTGOMERY, May 18, 1865.

Major-General CANBY:

I am informed by General Beauregard, who left here at 4 p. m. this day for Mobile, that Generals Hardee and Cheatham are approaching this place with all the troops from Johnston's army paroled belonging to the Gulf States west, and including his, and may be expected in four or five days. Will you please order up some steamers to carry them to Mobile, as I cannot supply them rations over one issue. I have more paroled prisoners here than I can send to Mobile on the three steamers reported on the way to this place with rations. General Beauregard should reach Mobile by 9 a. m. to-morrow, and will inform you fully.
