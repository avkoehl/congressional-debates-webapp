. Tfifi' CONCESSIONAL
m
time, referred to the Committee of the Whole
on the state of the Union, and ordered to be
printed.
Mr. WASFIBURNE, of Illinois. I now
move that it be made the special order in the
Committee of the Whole on the state of the
Union to-morrow after the morning hour.
Mr. MOORHEAD. I object to making it
the special order.
The SPEAKER. It can be done by a
majority vote.
Mr. MOORHEAD. If this is not made a
special order the tariff bill will then come up.
Mr. WASIIBURNE, of Illinois. That makes
no difference. The House can, when the time
comes, determine on what bill they will go into
the committee upon. If it is his bill, then that
will be the special order. If not, then it will
not be the special order.
The SPEAKER. The parliamentary rule
is somewhat ditferent. The committee must
act on the special order unless it is set aside.
The tariff bill is not the special order in the
committee, but it is the unfinished business
when there are no special orders.
Mr. MOORHEAD. Let the tariff bill be
made the special order, and after that the bill
just reported.
The SPEAKER. The tariff bill cannot be
made the special order except by unanimous
consent, but a majority can make a general
appropriation bill the special order.
The House divided on Mr. Washburne's
motion ; and there were—ayes 61, noes 26 ; no
quorum voting.
The SPEAKER ordered tellers; and ap-
pointed Mr. Warhbtjrxe, of Illinois, and Mr.
Moorhead.
The House again divided; and the tellers
reported—ayes 78, noes 88.
So the motion was agreed to.
Mr. MAYNARD. I give notice that I
reserve all points of order.

equalization of bounties.
The House proceeded to the considerate,,
of the special order, being the bill (H. 11. No.
940) to equalize the bounties of soldiers, sailors,
and marines who served in the late war forthe
Union, on which Mr. Washburn, of Indiana,
was entiled to the floor for one hour.
The bill was read at length.
Mr. WASHBURN, of Indiana. Mr. Speaker,
the bill before the House has for its object the
equalization of bounties to soldiers and sailors
upon the basis of eight and one third dollars
per month for each month of actual service to
every soldierand sailor honorably discharged,
deducting from this all bounties, national,
State, and local, and well known in the House
as Schexck's bounty bill. My own individual
preference was to only deduct the national
bounty, but believing that the bill in that shape
would not meet with favor I have consented
to take what I believe will meet the approba-
tion 'of the House.
The distinctive feature of this bill, and m
which it differs from all others heretofore re-
ported, is that while the basis of settlement is
established at a certain fixed rate per month,
the actual bounty is paid in land. And yet it
does not contemplate a system of land war-
rants, which must of necessity be unequal.
'The committee have endeavored in this bill
to combine the benefits of a cash settlement
and a land payment.
The bill provides that the Second Auditor,
under direction of the Secretary of the Treas-
ury, shall audit the claims arising under this
bill, and for the balance, after making the proper
deductions, issue to the soldier or sailor a cer-
tificate showing the amount due said soldier or
sailor, this certificate to bear six per cent, in-
terest until paid, but is to be paid only as pro-
vided for in this bill; that is, these certificates
are to be receivable as cash at any of the land
offices of the United States in payment for land
purchased by the original claimant or his heirs.
This clause, it is believed, will prevent the as-
signment of these certificates and their accu-
mulation in the hands of speculators, as they
can only be used by the soldier or his heirs,
but at the same time, if the soldier prefers to
hold the certificate, it is daily increasing in
value by the accumulation of interest. I shall
not urge the passage of this bill upon the
ground that the soldiersdemand it, for I believe
the large majority are too proud to demand
what right and justice should give without.
Nor do I propose to weigh the mother s tears
and the wife's anguish against com, and find
how much-is yetdue. Norwould I throw into
the scale the long, weary marches, the dreary
night watches, too often disturbed by the sharp
crack of the rifle announcing anofh'et picket
one. the'days of scorching fever, and tbe suffer-
ing anguish of the hospital, or the terrible ex-
citement of such battle-fields as Gettysburg and
Stone river, Pea Ridge and Antietam, Vicks-
burg and the Wilderness. This task I shall
leave for some future historian, who, writing
by the bright blaze of our nation's coming great-
ness, shall see and feel what they were worth;
Nor would I make an invidious comparisoa
between the soldier and the civilian. Ballots
were as necessary as bullets, and it is hard to
tell to whom the greatest meed of praise should
be given: to the old men and the young men
who detained at home cast the ballots that
reelected Abraham Lincoln, or the Boys in
Blue, who carried the muskets and scattered
the hosts of the rebellion. We are and should
be joint heirs of that glorious reward, an undi-
vided, indivisible country.
This bill only proposes to remove an inequal-
ity between soldiers themselves. A portion,
and a very deserving portion, have not received
from the Government" the same generous ac-
knowledgment^atfeorded to others fighting on
the same battlefields and sharing mutual hard-
ships. Tpohe soldiers of the early part of the
war we/<fesire to give a small token that we
appreciate the patriotism that called them from
the/plow and the workshop to our nation's
Ccue. That this inequality exists is admitted
y all. Can we, in justice to the country, rem-
edy it? Perhaps it may be well to inquire wliat
we have al ready done in the way of paying boun-
ties. The following table shows the amounts
paid by the General Government;
