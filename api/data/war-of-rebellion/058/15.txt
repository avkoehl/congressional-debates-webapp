LA GRANGE, TENN., January 2, 1864.

Captain S. L. WOODWARD,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

Tri-monthly was made out and sent to Memphis on 28th ultimo. Monthly will be sent as soon as as possible. First Alabama Cavalry left for Corinth by rail at 2 p.m. Transportation will be required for our wagons and garrison equipage in the morning. Can tents be provided for Seventh Kansas?

J. K. MIZNER,

Colonel, Commanding.

LA GRANGE, TENN., January 2, 1864.

General GRIERSON:

Quite a number of my men have been frost-bitten and are suffering from the intense cold. The Seventh Kansas Cavalry are without a single tent and have been unable to get any. Until the weather moderates, I must at least have all the dismounted men and sick in their quarters at Corinth, quartering the others the best I can until tents can be furnished. The change will be attended with great difficulties at the present time.

J. K. MIZNER,

Colonel, Commanding Brigade.

MEMPHIS, TENN., January 2, 1864.

Major COON,

Collierville:

Send a good battalion of the Second Iowa Cavalry with camp equipage in wagons, to start early in the morning, for this place. Send the rest of the regiment as soon as after as possible by road; the camp equipage to be sent by rail. You had best come in by rail to-day and select a camp.
