HEADQUARTERS, Middleton, March 10, 1863.

Colonel JAMES HAGAN,Commanding First Brigade:

COLONEL: I have the honor, as well as pleasure, of sending you another Federal deserter (Private George Addis, Second Kentucky Cavalry). I have retained his arms and send you his horse. He was brought in by the First Alabama, and I would request that his horse be turned over to the quartermaster of said regiment, that it may have the benefit of the horse.

He states that three divisions, viz, Davis', Rousseaus', and Sheridan's, left Murfreesborough yesterday and came out on the pike leading to Eagleville. Davis went in the direction of Eagleville, and Rousseau's and Sheridan's divisions he thinks are now at Versailles; they were there this morning. He does not know the object of the expedition. They left camp with three days' rations; no cooking utensils. There are two small regiments dissatisfaction among the Federal soldiers in consequence of Lincoln's negro proclamation, and that many desertions will occur.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOHN S. PRATHER,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding Post.
