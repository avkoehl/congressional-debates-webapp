COMMUNICATION FUOM SECRETARY OF "WAR.
Mr. NICHOLSON asked leave to take up
•from the table a communication from the Sec-
retary of War, which was laid on the table yes-
terday and ordered to be printed, and to have
the same referred to the Committee on Mili-
tary Affairs.
No objection being made, the communica-
tion was so referred.
The SPEAKER proceeded, as the regular
order of business, to call the committees for
reports, commencing with the Committee on
Public Lands.
PUBLIC LANDS IN SOUTHERN STATES.
Mr. JULIAN, from the Committee on Public
Lands, reported back House bill No. 85, for the
disposal of the public lands for homesteads to
actual settlers in the Slates of Alabama, Mis-
sissippi, Louisiana, Arkansas, and Florida, and
asked its present consideration.
The Clerk read the bill. It provides that all
the public lands in the States aforesaid shall be
disposed of according to tho stipulations of the
homestead law of 18(32, no entry to be made for
more than eighty acres; provided that, no dis-
crimination shall be made on account of race or
color, and that mineral lands shall be reserved.
Mr. TABER. As one of.the members of that
committee, I do not assent to this majority re-
port, and 1 desire at the propter time to offer an
amendment.
Mr. JULIAN. I am willing that the gentle-
man from New York [Mr. Taiser] should have
an opportunity to submit his amendment to this
bill if he desires it.
Mr. TABER. 1 offer the following amend-
ment :
And provided uho, Thatnothing in thisacsthallbo
BO construed as to urccliulesuch persons us have been
or shall be pardoned by the President of tile United
States for their participation in the recent rebellion
from the benefit of tins act.
Mr. THAYER. I would like to ask the gen-
tleman from New York [Mr. Taber] what there
is in the bill which gives rise to the necessity
of the amendment he lias offered.
Mr. TA 13E11. By the pro\isions of the home-
stead law all per.^ons that are not able to take
an oath that they have at no time taken part
against Ihe Government in the rebellion have
no right to participate in the benefits of the
homestead act. The consequence is that all
those who have served in the rebel army, no
matter whether voluntarily or otherwise, arc
precluded from the benefit of the act. My
amendment proposes that those who have been
pardoned, and those that may be pardoned,
may be permitted to enter upon these lands,
the same as others.
Mr. J ULIAN. I ask to have read a commu-
nication from the Department of the Interior
as part of my remarks.
The Clerk read, as follows:

1 [s it, not clear from these fa--ts that to the extent to
which it maybe legally done the (to\erninent should
j>romptly put a stop to lurther land monopoly in those
States? In inv judgment, su'di action i^ demanded j
by the be.-l inteic>ts", not only of the non-landhold- .
er-=, but of all the people of those States and of the j
nation. . . , .
It m:ty he said that the circumstances which have
hcretolovc tended to land nionopolv in those States
have so changed that no further danger ot it exists.
It is admitted that the institution of slaver\, now
abolished, promoted land monopolv. But it 1<* coti-
! tended that the high price of the products of tnose
1 States which doc-, and for some time to come m\x>t,
\ prevail, i< not les< an inducement to such monopoly
1 than was the institution of slavery. 'Phis, acting upon
the whole ea pital and enterprise of the country, can-
not fail to produce greater results in the direction
of monopoly than did the institution of slavery act-
ing only upon a section, and that the leastcnterpris-
ing one.
Besides, the knowledge that these valuable lands
■ nje now nearly all in private hands; that but fifty
million acre* remain at the low (government maxi-
, mum pri -e. and t hat t he purchase perhaps of one half
of this quruiTit.N, i-eloiting the mo?t desirable, would
eomph'te t bi> gigantie monopoly, are inducements
i whiei) Will hftrdiy be re>isted.
, Immediately upon the opening of theLmtecl btates
land offices in those States the public land will become
' eyWoct to location with all the various kinds of Gov-
ernment scrip and warrants, mueh of which can now
be purchased at from sixty to seventy cents per acre,
and it is known that combinations of capital already
exist for operations in this direction. That some of
theso would carry business and enterprise with them
is no doubt true, but many, and tho largest portion,
would not. In either evont the two million non-land-
holders in those States must so remain, or seek new
homes in the distant States or Territories. The,sim-
ple question is. do .vou prefer many or few landed
proprietors in tbeseution of country under considera-
tion? If the former, sell under the homestead only.
If the latter, no action is necessary.
Very respectfully, your obedient servant^

Chairman Committee on Public Lands.

Mr. STEVENS.
The SPEAKER.
"Who wrote that letter?
The Commissioner of the
Who is ho?
J. M. Edmunds.
Mr. STEVENS. God help him! [Laughter.]
Mr. TABEli. I move now that the bill as
amended be printed, and laid before the House.
It is a very important matter. There is a large
amount of land to be disposed of, and the pro-
visions of the hill ought to be thoroughly un-
derstood before it is acted upon. T move that
tho consideration of the bill be postponed, and
that the bill be printed.
Mr. JULIAN. I hope a different course will
be pursued. Tyielded to the gentleman for the
purpose of offering his amendment. 1 cannot
yield for a motion to postpone.
Mr. RICE, of Maine. T move to amend as
follows : in line twelve, after the word '' acres,''
insert "and in lieu of the sum of ten dollars
required to be paid by the second section of
said act there shall be paid the sum of five dol-
lars at the time of the issue of each patent."
The SPEAKER. That is not in order at
this time. The motion of the gentleman from
New York was to amend by adding to the bill
a proviso at tho end.
Mr. ill CI5, of Maine. T hope the gentleman
from Indiana [Mr. Ju.ux] will accept it, so
that I can make my amendment. .
Mr. JULIAN. I accept it, if there is no
objection.
Mr. LE BLOND. I object.
Mr. K1CE, of Maine. I will withdraw it,
then, and offer it at another time.
The SPEAKER. The gentleman can only
arrive at his object by offering it as a substitute.
Mr. ltir.E, of Maine. I will withdraw it,
and offer it again after the pending amendment
is disposed of.
The SPEAKER. If the previous question
is moved on the bill and the pending amend-
ments. Ihe gentleman may not have an oppor-
tunity to oiler it. because'the previous question
will not, exhaust ilself until the third reading
of the bill. If the gentleman from Indiana
moves the previous question only on the pend-
ing amendment, there will be an opportunity
for the gentleman from Maine to offer his
amendment.
j^Ir. RICE, of Maine. . I understand the
Speaker to say that I can offer a substitute for
tho bill?
The SPEAKER. The gentleman can offer
a substitute embracing all the original bill and
what he proposes to add to it.
Mr. RICE, of Maine. I offer that substitute.
Mr. JULIAN resumed the floor.
Mr. LE BLOND. I would like the gentle-
man to yield to me for a moment, that I may
s'ate the reasons v/hj7 I think this bill ought to
be recommitted and printed together with the
report of the Commissioner of the General
Land Office.
Mr. JULIAN. I must decline to do so. I
prefer to submit what I have to say, and then I
will yield for any questions. The bill reported
by the Committee on Public Lands propels to
extend the homestead law of 1802 over the five
land States specified in the bill. Those States
contain of surveyed public lands which have
been offered for sale fortyix million acres.
The proposition is simply to extend the home-
stead law over the whole of that immense do-
main, and to that, I take it, no objection will be,
urged from any quarter in this House, it we
