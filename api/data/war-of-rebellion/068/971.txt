William H. F. Lee would be more equitable than the reverse of that arrangement. Gordon's men will fight none the worse for being with their old comrades and in their old command, and we certainly need cavalry here.

I am, very respectfully,

WADE HAMPTON,

Major-General.

NAVY DEPARTMENT, C. S. A., Richmond, May 7, 1864.

Honorable SECRETARY OF WAR:

SIR: Permit me to call your attention to the fact that the obstructions in the river near Drewry's Bluff are not yet opened to admit the passage of the navel vessels now ready for service below them, and that the work of removing them seems to have ceased. I deem it proper to urge that the passage through them be completed without delay.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. R. MALLORY,

Secretary.

[First indorsement.]

MAY 7, 1864.

ENGINEER BUREAU:

I understood some days since that there was a distinct understanding with the honorable Secretary of the Navy that the obstructions would be removed at any time that he would name when his vessels would be ready, and that he was to give a few days' notice. Is not this so? Since he now desires the obstructions to be moved so as to allow the desired passage let it be done.

J. A. SEDDON,

Secretary.

[Second indorsement.]

The work has never been discontinued in removing the obstructions since the order for doing so was first given, except during freshest, when it was impossible to work. Every effort has been made to get them out, and I believe there is now and has been enough water to pass them since they have been ready to move.

W. H. STEVENS,

Colonel of Engineers.
