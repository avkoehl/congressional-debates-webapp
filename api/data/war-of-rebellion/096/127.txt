I have ever found you faithful, patriotic, and brave. The bones of your dead and the mained forms of your wounded comrades testify to your gallantry on many hard-fought fields. Your reputation as a division will always be dear to me. Continue to exercise and cherish those sound doctrines of military discipline which it has been my highest ambition to instill, and you will be sure to add glory to your colors in the struggle through which our dear country is now passing.
