CINCINNATI, July 16, 1863.

General MANSON:

General Judah left here this afternoon before 5 o'clock, with over 1,000 cavalry and some artillery. He ought to be at Maysville now. If I order him to Portsmouth, to turn back and check Morgan, can you keep Morgan from crossing?

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.

(Same to Colonel Runkle.)

Colonel BENJAMIN P. RUNKLE, Hamden:

The rebels are not more than 3,000. Hobson is close in his rear. Judah can't be far to the south of you.

Colonel RUNKLE, Hamden:

It is said that Morgan will make for Buffington Island. Can you get troops from Marietta and from there down?

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.

JULY 16, 1863.

Colonel RUNKLE, Hamden:

I have ordered a force from Marietta, under Colonel Putnam, to Buffington Island. Enemy threaten to cross there. Have force on cars, so as to be at Athens or Marrieta, as occasion may require, in case the enemy are turned back from the river. The following is the dispatch I sent Colonel Putnam. [See inclosure.] I trust the movement to your good judgment, to impede Morgan as much as possible.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.

JULY 16, 1863.

Colonel PUTNAM, Marietta:

If you cannot be at buffington before noon to-morrow, I fear you will be too late. You can embark them on the boat, and move down rapidly but carefully, and if you find that the enemy has been turned back from the ford, you must hasten up the river to Parkersburg or Marietta. Under no circumstances must you allow your boat to fall into the hands of the enemy. Have all the means of crossing the river destroyed that you find ont he banks. I leave your movements to your good judgment. The object is to prevent the crossing at Buffington, and then, if the enemy is turned up toward Marietta, to move up quickly and assist that place. A gunboat will be at Buffington in four or five hours. Colonel Runkle will send troops to Marietta. Lose no time.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.
