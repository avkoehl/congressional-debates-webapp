Major General J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Goldsborough:

The Neuse River bridge will be completed to-morrow, as I informed you when at Kinston. I will go up tot he construction party to-morrow and remain with them till we get the road completed to Goldsborough. I think I can get a section through by rail as soon as I could move them by wagons, and I don't know that I could get wagons for that purpose.
