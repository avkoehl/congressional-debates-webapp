CAPTAIN: Some of the diplomatic agents of foreign powers accredited to the United States have informed the Stete Department that their domestics have been placed by the enrolling officers on the lists of persons liable to military service. The Honorable Secretary of State, in a letter of the 6th instant to the Honorable Secretary of War, represent that such a proceeding is contrary to public law in the country due to the representatives of State in amity with the United States, to the spirit and perhaps to the letter of the act of Congress approved 30th of April, 1790, enlisted "An act for the punishment of certain enemies against the United States, "and asks that such orders may be given as will lead to a discontinuance of the complaint referred to. You will therefore at once instruct your enrolling officers not to enroll any of the domestics of foreign agents accredited to the United States and to remove from the enrollment lists the names of all such persons as may have been enrolled by them. You will see that such order is promptly and faithfully executed.

I am, captain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JAS. B. FRY,

Provost-Marshal-General.
