ADDENDA.+
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,Chattanooga, Tenn., October 3, 1863.

Major-General McCOOK:

I have received your letter +inclosing and calling my attention to a newspaper paragraph which says that in my official dispatches I attribute our failure to overthrow the enemy in the battle of Chickamauga to your disobedience of my orders. I take pleasure in saying to you that no official or other dispatches of mine have warranted a charge of disobedience of orders by you on either of the days of the battle of Chickamauga.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.
