A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,August 20, 1864.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

I think the man who cam into General Butler's lines must have meant Kershaw's brigade instead of Corse's.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,August 20, 1864 - 6 p. m.

Major-General WARREN,

Commanding Fifth Corps:

Kershaw's old brigade is believed to be in the Shenandoah Valley with Kershaw's division. Why do you suppose the deserter to Butler's lines referred to Kershaw's brigade?

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,August 20, 1864 - 6.30 p. m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

Colonel Locke wrote the dispatch for me. I meant him to say that the man Crowley that I took to-day might have meant Keershaw. He did not know exactly how to pronounce the name, and it might have been Corse or Kershaw.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
