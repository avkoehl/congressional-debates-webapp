treville roads each night, but have not undertaken to push a scouting party to Fredericktown. A scouting party of 130 men left at midnight last night for Farmington, with instructions to go as much south in the direction of the enemy as they could. I am just starting a good officer with seventy men, being all I can get, to Fredericktown, and will to-night find out the real condition of things there. I think the cavalry force in the sub-district is but 250 available. The remainder of the 450 force on the rolls I dismounted, having sold private horses because no appraiser could be got to appraise them. I have had citizen and soldier scouts out from De Soto, Mineral Point, Irondale scouting southeastward, and from Potosi southwestward beyond Webster. I am certain the rebels are higher up than Fredericktown.

Major-General ROSECRANS:

Ironton is now being attacked by at least 100 rebels; perhaps a much larger force.

IRONTON, THREE MILES BELOW PILOT KNOB,

[September 26,] 1864-3.30 p. m.

Major-General ROSECRANS:

Our pickets and scouts driven in here one hour ago on the Fredericktown road by a rebel force certainly 200 or 300 strong. I have re-enforced with one piece of artillery, and a desultory firing is going on a mile east of this and two and a half miles from the fort. I do not wish to bring on a general engagement out there if the whole rebel force is really at hand, because it is certainly 3,000 to 5,000 strong. I am satisfied of this fully, because of reports entirely authentic that there was a column went up east of Patterson nearly as large as that which passed there, and because reliable officers give reports of citizens as to length of column and as to degree road was cut up. The scout to Farmington returned an hour ago, having reached there at 8 o'clock. There was but a small party there. They killed 3 and wounded 8, captured 1. The wounded rebel I have examined, and his manner gives me great confidence in his statement. He says he left Fredericktown last night. Shelby's command was then there, and it was said they would go to Farmington to-day. He says Shelby has about 4,000 men, with four pieces of artillery. He only knows positively that Shelby is there, but thinks Price, Marmaduke, Cabell, and Fagan are also there with 15,000 men. He had not seen Price, but heard he got there Saturday night. He heard a brass band Saturday night which did not belong to Shelby's command, and was said to belong to Price. Two paroled prisoners in from Greenville road repeat the assertions of the others you examined. They left the command which went up Cedar Creek, and say it was Price's. I think I can hold the fort against 5,000 cavalry, and shall stand fast until I learn more as to Price.
