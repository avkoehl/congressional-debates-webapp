Major-General HALLECK:

GENERAL: I shall regret very much if the promotion which I recommend after the battle of October 19 are not made before the departure of the Sixth Corps.

Major-General.

CAMDEN STATION, Baltimore, Md., November 28, 1864.

Hon E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

We are reliably informed that Rosser and McCausland, with a large cavalry force, attack and captured New Creek Station this morning, with the garrison and public property. It is apprehended that Piedmond, six miles distant, with all the valuable railroad property, machinery, &amp;c., will be again burned. General Kelley is concentrating his forces to protect Cumberland and the brigade east. It is most important that the he shall be rapidly re-enforced. Can any troops be sent from Ohio or Wheeling or eastward? A relatively small force of the enemy can accomplish very extensive mischief upon the line of the Baltimore Pennsylvania unless attacked by forces from the west.

JNO. W. GARRETT,

President.

KERNSTOWN, VA., November 28, 1864-11 p. m.

JOHN W. GARRETT,

Baltimore, Md.:

A large division of cavalry marched this afternoon from Fawcett's Gap on Moorefield. A large infantry force was sent to Cumberland. General Kelley is very cautious about that which is in little danger, and not remarkably so about that which is. I will advise you when to commence running.

P. H. SHERIDAN,

Major-General.
