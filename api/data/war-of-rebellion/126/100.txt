eighteen miles of track, in addition to the labor of troops, was as follows:

Cost of bridge, as per settlement of General Winslow with Grant &amp; Co., builders, and approved by General Wilson:

725 feet (lineal) of bridging, at $11 per foot........... $7,975

Amount due for track laying, as per check rolls,

approved as above......................................... 7,167

Amount of work done at culvert near Vining's, approved

as above.................................................. 528

Total amount..............................................15,670

The above amount ($15,670) I think is justly chargeable to construction, and would therefore respectfully recommend its payment. The work was done by order of Major-General Wilson, commanding Cavalry Corps in Georgia, and at a cost less perhaps than we could have done it ourselves, besides very materially expediting the completion of the road.

At Atlanta we have put down extensive side-tracks, amounting in the aggregate to over three miles,and have erected a large freight platform 400 feet in length by 30 in width, with a shed roof over part of it. Upon the completion of the road to Atlanta, and after having put the track in a thorough condition, I again commenced a reduction of the corps, which at this date amounts to but little over 200 men. With the small bridge force retained, I am putting the Howe truss bridge, ordered for Allatoona Creek a year ago, and stored at Chattanooga, across the chasm in the bank, near Vining's produced by the destruction of the culvert before alluded to. The break is upward of 100 feet in width and gradually increasing, and the trestle around it on so insecure a foundation I have thought it advisable to substitute it with a bridge. The balance of my track force are gathering up the crooked iron the Chattanooga and Atlanta road. Below please find a recapitulation of work done in June and July, expenditure of material, amount of iron manufactured at rolling-mill, and amount of pay-rolls for June and July, exclusive of wages paid at rolling-mill.
