reduction of expenditure; that is, provided no
deficiency bills hereafter are to be presented
to this House to make up deficiencies in. the
Army for the present fiscal year.
Mr. MAYNAIiD. When the gentleman
comes to revise his speech* 1 hope he will state
how the aggregate duties on these articles he
lias named have been increased*®
Mr. BROOKS, of New York. We have the
actual returns for three quarters of the fiscal
year, made to the Treasury Department, and,
therefore, from that we have the means of esti-
mating the expenditures for the coming quar-
ter. Exclusive of the public debt, the actual
expenditure for three quarters of the fiscal
year and the estimated expenditure for the
fourth quarter are, together, $156,524,999,
while the interest on the public debt, to be
added to that expenditure, will scarcely be
$115,000,000, in consequence of large pay-
ments by the Treasury from the enormous sur-
plus income, the payment on April 1 amount-
ing to $11,000,000. This $115,000,000 of
interest makes the expenditures for the year
$271,524,999. On that exhibit, then, there
will be of surplus revenue $97,867,296; that

is, supposing the internal revenue to yield only
$134,231,682, in lieu of $145,000,000, which
the Commissioper of Internal Revenue expects
to get. This also exhibits a fact of great
importance to the country and to the tax-
payers of the country, and to the members of
this House as the Representatives of those
tax-payers, and that is, in order to protect
special interests, the people are called upon
to pay heavier taxes than are needed for the
expenditures of the Government.
I submit the following table as illustrative
and demonstrative of these facts :

I now hold in my hand, Mr. Speaker, a state-
ment of the expenditures of this Government
in 1860:
For civil and miscellaneous $27,976.434
War Department  16,409,767
Havy Department  11,514,964
Total 855,901,165
But it would not be fair to hold the Admin-
istration to an appropriation or an expenditure
like that now, because the country has largely
increased in population, and because that was
the expenditure on a specie basis, while we
now have a paper currency. In order, there-
fore, to do justice to the Administration and" to
the party who support it—if there is any party
in this matter of revenue and taxation, which
I sometimes doubt when I see votes in this
House—I add thirty per cent, for the in-
crease of population; that is, $16,770,349,
and that would make the annual expenses
of the Government in 1870, $72,661,514.
Bat, as I have intimated, this would not be
a just calculation if I did not also give the
Administration the benefit of the increase of
nominal value between paper money and gold,
.vhieh is now ten per cent., and not likely to be
higher. This increase is'$7,267,251; so that
the annual appropriations for carrying on this
Government, exclusive of the public debt and
exclusive of pensions, the necessary result of
the war, should not be over $79,938,764.
Adding for pensions, as expended in 1870,
$28,344,202, and for Indian expenses, accord-
ing to the expenditure in 1870, $3,407,938, and
for the interest on the public debt, $115,000,000,
there should be appropriated in 1871 only
$226,690,905. That, with an economical ad-
ministration of this Government, and with
economical appropriations on the part of this
House, ought to be all the appropriation that
should be made, necessarily made, for the
expenditures of the Government and to make
all just provisions for the public debt.
These statements will be better understood
when thus tabulated :

Mr. Speaker, I now hold in my hand bills
of two characters. One is for reducing the
taxation through the customs, and another for
reducing the internal revenue. My tariff bill
brings down the proceeds of the customs within
$130,000,000, and my internal revenue bill
collects taxes only from spirits", tobacco, and
fermented liquors and stamps, a little less than
$90,000,000, estimating oil the collection as
returned in 1870. I have also in my hand a
third bill, one, perhaps, of far more import-
ant practical purpose; that is, a bill to pro-
vide for an early resumption of specie pay-
ments. These three bills I would take much
pleasure in presenting to this House if its com-
mittees were organized, and if there were any
probability that there could be any action in
any Committee of Ways and Means on such
bills during the session.
Mr. KBLLEY. I would suggest that the
gentleman should give us the benefit of his
bills by letting them be printed, that gentlemen
may have an opportunity of considering them
during the recess.
Mr. BROOKS, of New York. I prefer sub-
mitting them to a regular organized commit-
tee—to the Committee of Ways and Means
which may be appointed. I have submitted
the facts. The bills themselves it is of no
use to submit when there is no possibility of
legislating upon them.
Mr. KELLEY. The country would study
the bills with advantage if they were now
printed, even though not referred to a coramit-
Mr. BROOKS, of New York. Gentlemen
have hardly an idea of the way the expendi-
tures of this Government are constantly run-
ning up. Without entering with any great
particularity upon that subject, I call the atten-
tion of the House to its own expenditures in
order to bring the thing right home to the
members of this House. I hold in my hand a
statement from the Treasury Department, just
issued, showing the expenses of Congress in
the two years from March 1, 1807, to March
1, 1869, to be §6,476,971 40. And the ex-
penditures of Congress for the two past years
for running this little mill here in this Capitol,
for running a body of some three hundred
members with their surroundings, have been
$7,475,460 74; an average each year of
$-3,737,734 87 for running this Capiiol, its
concomitants and its surroundings; while the
expenditures on Congress in 1860, which were
then supposed to be enormous, were only
$2,038,052; showing in tea years an increase
in running this Capitol alone ofover $1,700,000.
Under this exhibit of facts, in which I have
tried to be as calm as possible, there arises the
great question, what is it our duty to do ?
The great aim of the Secretary ofthe Treasury
seems to be the reduction of the public debt.
I appreciate his ambition ; I acknowledge the
importance of reducing the public debt. The
Secretary of thel'reasury tells us that in the two
years ending March 1, 1871, the public debt
has been reduced $204,754,413: an average
annually of $102,372,206. But it should be
borne in mind, while I make this acknowledge-
ment, an enormous taxation is imposed upon
the country therefor, and that it costs through
the machinery of the revenue, in part, but
more by the additional prices of everything,
resulting from this high taxation, fully three
dollars to raise one whereby the public debt is
reduced. Therefore, in point of fact, to reduce
the public debt $1,000,000, we levy, by direct
and indirect taxation upon the people of the
United States, a burden of $3,000,000 therefor.
Sir, this may not strike every one at the first
glance ; but if it is borne in mind that wherever
we lay a prohibitory tariff, or wherever we lay
a tariff approximating prohibition, for the pur-
pose of raising revenue ; or wherever we levy
a very high tariff upon anything, we impose
an additional price upon almost every article
raised and consumed in our own country, I
shall not be deemed so blind when I estimate
the cost under our enormous system of taxa-
tion, of public debt $100,000,000 per annum,
to be at least $300,000,000 of burden upon the
whole people.
And now, Mr. Speaker, I beseech this
House, if the Treasury will not take these facts
into consideration, to stand by the action of
Congress during the civil war, pending these
prodigious outfits or outlays of expenditure,
when we were raising what then seemed fright-
ful loans and levying far higher taxes than
exist at present—the pledge which the country
then made as a debtor to the public creditor,
and to the people ; that is, a sinking fund, now
only about twenty-four million dollars per an-
num. If the Secretary of the Treasury will
not be content with that pledge, bat will persist
in being run away with a mad ambition for
saddling upon this day and generation a burden
which belongs more to our children than to
us, and then to ride us booted and spurred, if
not to death, to poverty, and sometimes to
starvation; if he will not, I say, becontent with
the revolutionary pledge, if I may so express
myself, made during the war, the pledge then
made to the public creditors amid all the hor-
rors of that war, that a certain sinking fund
annually should bo applied for the redemp-
tion of the public debt, then it is quite time
for this House to step in and compel him.
Sir, the next thing we ought to do, in my
estimation, is a great reduction upon many
of the dutiable articles in the tariff, with an
