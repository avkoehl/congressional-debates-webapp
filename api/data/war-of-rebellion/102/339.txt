Major JACKSON,

Acting Signal Officer, Military Division of West Mississippi:

It is reported that Jeff. Davis is in Mississippi, and has been at Summit. General Hood is said to be with him. I get the report from a paroled prisoner who goes to New Orleans to-day.

Respectfully,

GEO. WEBSTER,

Major Seventy-seventh U. S. Colored Infantry, Commanding.

GENERAL ORDERS, HDQRS. CARROLLTON DISTRICT, Numbers 9. Carrollton, La., May 7, 1865.

I. The undersigned having been assigned to duty within the limits of this military district by virtue of rank, hereby assumes command.

II. Captain T. J. Whiteman, Ninety-third U. S. Colored Infantry, is announced as acting assistant adjutant-general, relieving First Lieutenant George W. H. Allen, Eleventh U. S. Colored Heavy Artillery, who will immediately report to the commanding officer of his battalion for duty.

HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF MISSISSIPPI,Vicksburg, May 7, 1865.

Major General P. J. OSTERHAUS,

Chief of Staff, Military Division of West Mississippi:

Your telegraphic dispatch of the 4th instant received by me through the rebel lines, and ordering me to prepare a cavalry garrison for Gallatin, compels me to retain the battalion of Fourth Missouri Cavalry which you had previously ordered me to send you at New Orleans. I take it for granted the new state of affairs has rendered this force unnecessary for you, and I therefore postpone sending it, as previously directed, till I hear from you again.

Very respectfully,

N. J. T. DANA,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF MISSISSIPPI,Vicksburg, Miss., May 7, 1865.

COMMANDING OFFICER U. S. FORCES AT BIG BLACK RIVER:

SIR: The major-general commanding directs me to notify you that he has information that the Texas troops in your front may refuse to comply with the terms of General Taylor's surrender, and that you are to be on your guard against surprise or annoyance by them.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. WARREN MILLER,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
