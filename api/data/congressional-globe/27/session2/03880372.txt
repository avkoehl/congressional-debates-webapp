Hadsdunn? the four years of ¡Mr Van Buren's Administra
tion, were five millions of dollars How, then, could it be said,
that a Mod fund, which, during three years of bank suspension
and ¿epi eciation, in Mr Van Buren's Administration, yielded
fifteen-millions of dollars, would be no security to those in-
clined to advance a loan to the Government of the sum now
required? There are eighteen millions of acres now ready for
sale, and if thty be brought into market properly, so great is the
desire for fresh lands, that sales wilt be effected sufhcient to
place in the Treasury an amount that must instantly raise the
credit of the Government,
Mr CLaV rose merely to explain the circumstances under
Which his bill was introduced m 1832, there were several
amendments made in the Senate, and that named by the Sena
tor was one The amendments were general—including the
■whole system Ihe proposition with legard to the grant of
lands to the new States, could not be carried alone, and
had to be introduced in the distribution bil , to insure us
suecess
Mr BENTON hoped as it was now late, the subject would be
-postponed till to morrow
Mr. CLAY was very anxious, under his peculiar circumstan-
ces, to have the vote taken now
Mr CALHOUN thought it best, as many Senators wcreab
sent who wished tfr record their votes, to pass the subject over
and go into Executivesession
Mr ARCHER, al&o proposed that the Senate should go into
■Executive session
Mr CLAY observed that it was his desire the whole matter
should be closed this evening He wit-hed to have nothing of
his on hand to morrow, when he would hare to surrender up
his seat to his successor. But if the Senate should determine to
make a postponement, lie could, should that decision be appa-
rent, move to lay the resolutions on the table
Mr WALKLR wished a delay till four o'clock, as a Senator
absent would be here then who wished to record his vote
Mr MANGÜM would, when the proper occasion occurred,
move to reler the 2d, 3d, and 5th resolution to the Committee
on Finance We objected to committing himself as to whether
the wants of the Government require twenty five or twenty six
millions Before the adjustment of the tariff question by the
compromise act, he was opposed to, and voted against chstri
hution Smee that, he had voted for it He now did not choose
to commit himself on the question of repealing the distnbu
tioo act He wanted to reserve himself till the whole subject is
Wore the Senate
Mi WOODBURY observed that he had not intended to
speak on this amendment, nor should he now travel over for
raer considerations m us fa for, arising Irom the impropriety of
the donation of the hwls to the Stairs at any time, much less
in the straitened condition of theTioasury at thie time, and <tt
the last exti a session
But a momentary cessation of hostilities in debate between
gentlemon on the opposite side had occurred, and a final vote
tí night beng desired by the Senator fiom Kentucky, he (Mr
Woodbury) would present in support of the leeall of the
lands, a lew reasons which had as yet been scarcely alluded to,
hut which had a moat material beai mg They weie the difl
culty, if not impossibility, of laising thirty millions, or even
twenty six millions* m the present state of the country, and un
derthe hmkmpt system and cash duties, by any increase what
ever of the existing tariff If you insist on spending so large
an amount, you must get a part of it from lands, or direct taxes
There must be an end to delusion on this point ere long, and if
an attempt ismade to keep up expense to twentj six or Unity
millions, and the lands aie not íecalled, but the tauff raised
nominally to thuty percent let the Senate and the country take
warning that all the anticipated increase of revenue from that
source will not bereali7ed
New dein its and pro tents will then follow—new acts of in
solvency be b azoned to the world, and the national credit be
forever blasted Thu«you have on the one haid aiesorttoyour
own lands and retrenchment, on the other, to dnect taxes and
internal duties ihese ire the only alternatives a fuither

Wiut docs ail experionce,as well asreaeon,show m this point?
"Why, sir, that a tariff is not adapted to raise íevenue beyond
a certain point For when that point is transcended, either smug"
ghng begins or diminished consumption, and in enher case a di-
minished revenue In your present tariff some articles pay now
not twenty but twelve and a, half per cent impost Why? Be-
cause the mover of these very resolutions, as well as the pie

But gentlemen may arsrue that thirty per cent duties will not

of thirty per cen would be a real duty, under the existing
laws, of quite for y five pei cent to the corteumei How/

Bjut, beside tms, we are to have a fcone va uatiori at- r June,
which, if it means any thins, must mean fo raise the valuej on

Here, then, is ten per cent more charged on the price of ihe
goods—making, in all, by a nominal duty of thirty per cent
what ts equivalent to a real duty, under the old system, of
forty five per cent
C&1 any body pretend that this will not enhance the price
near one half, and thus tempt much to smuggling? Will it not
also compel the poor and middling classes to buy loss, to con

The experience of all otherjcoimtnesis, that a tariff cannot be
employed for purposes of revenue to any high amount whatever
SomeSenatorsin this debate seem tohavesuppo-ed differently,
but their views must arise from want of careful examination
Does England raise all her íevenue by a tariff? No, sir, m ich
of it by a land tax—much by infernal duties—much by stamps,
and some even by the Post Office
Does notFrancepursueaaimilarcourse? and numerous other
counti íes But to shorten this inquiry, what has been our own
course in 1793 and m 1812' Did we obtain by a tauft all the
revenue we then needed? feo far from it, en, you were obliged
to go to eight per cent loans, stamp acts, excise duties, and on

Why, ¡sir-gentlemen danotbcemto have icca led to mind,
that never, in thp palmiest days of commercial prosperity—of
unlimited credit and the highest taiiff—have we ever collected
under ittwent) six million* ayeai, except on two occ «ions of
two years e?ch, and tho^e were under cucum^tances very pe
culiar, and the very íeverse of what now exist At the close of
the late war, when the country had been drained of foreign mer
chandise, and the duties were doubled at a war standard and the
tide of peace flowed mhke an avalanche, twenty six millions
were collected by a tariff But it lasted only two years, and
was followed by contractions and disasters most overwhelming
Tbeother period was under 'he veiy high tariff of 1828—at
fifty eighty, one hundredand moie per cent on many articles—
and the country not left toa natural and diminished import un
der it, but by the debt  incurred abroad, and the goods broueht
hence inpayment of the loans abioad in 1832 and 1S.33 the re
venue was artificially swollen over twenty six millions
But never, undei anv othei circumstances or at any other
epochs than those two, in our whole history, has the revenue
fiom the tariff eqna'led twenty six millions, and never undei
anycircumstanceshasit reached thuty, except the single year
succeeding the wai

Mi i ALHOUXsai 1 if he were an enemy tof^eUmoPjor if he
desired to pcc the Government diociehed he woidd take lie
course which was puisned by the Senator from Kentucky and
his friends It was not, perhapa, the propei ¡me for enteiin**
into an argurrem upon tbi*  point, but he would confess that he
had been utter y astonished at the declarations which he had
beard from those gentlemen He (Mr C/ lhoí'n) held it to
belmpossihle tha* a restoration of ti e publ c credit could he
effected until the land fund was brought b-^ck into the public
Treasury This was the veiy first step to betaken audit was
not for ihe puipose of increasing thefinarcesoi the Government
merely, that he'd it incumbent upon them to take this step.
There weie other considerations which iifluenced his mind
The very fact of giving away one or two bianche-sof the public
íevenue, and placing them beyord the control oí Government,
presented to the eyesof the country and the world evidence of a
moralwtong—an actofmfatuation—an unheardof foliy, suchas
nevsi before entered into the heaH of any people 1 his act would

source Could any r> an c* nceiveof any thn gmoieabsurhi It
was certainly a stiangecourse to be pursued at the veiy time
when they were forced to go into the market to procure a
loan to supply the wants of ihe fieamiy Capitalists
could not be unobseivant of so high a degree of
folly on the part of the Government of thh> coun
try, and thty woull be proportionally icluctant it would
be found, to become the creáitor& of a G >vci umeni which waa
capable of acting in &o preposterous a nannei But this was
not all they weie about to make the tempta ions foi smuggling
mesistible, ata time when themoials o* the counti y were pros-
trated, in the pei suns of taoi^ai ds who had fallen fiom affiu

And while genflemen weie thus going on  airestirg every
measure which could  give a chance   for  the restoratu n
of the credit of the country, they appealed to those on the oppo-
