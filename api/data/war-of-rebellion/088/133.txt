The headquarters' spring-wagon, ambulances, medical, and other wagons usually allowed to move with the troops, will not move with the troops, but will be parked under the direction of Captain McEntee, assistant quartermaster, and will move under his direction. The general train will move under direction of Captain Shallenberger, assistant quartermaster. The details now absent on fatigue will be ordered to join their commands at once. The artillery and trains will not hitch up until so directed. If not already supplied, the troops will at once be supplied with rations of the required amount.
