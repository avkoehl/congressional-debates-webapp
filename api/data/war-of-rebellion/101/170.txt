THIBODEAUX, April 5, 1865.

(Received 12. 10 p. m.)

The party sent in pursuit of Whitaker yesterday from Donaldsonville have returned. Colonel Fiske reports that Whitaker ran into our party which had started the day previous, under command of Major Hildreth, Sixteenth Indiana. Major Hildreth recaptured all the mules and horses and a number of prisoners. The remainder threw away their arms and scattered into the swamps in every direction. it is said, though not yet official, that Whitaker was so hard pressed that he threw away his clothing and swam a Bayou to escape, and that one of our men holds his uniform as a trophy. Major Hildreth also captured one of the larger boats which Whitaker came in with in Bayou Corn. I anticipate that my other detachments will catch some of the stragglers.

Very happily, yours,

R. A. CAMERON,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers, Commanding District.

Major Hildreth has returned to Donaldsonville, bringing 8 prisoners, 60 mules, a quantity of arms, &amp;c. The overseer of the McCall plantation claims all the mules. I have directed Colonel Fiske to return the mules to their legal owners on satisfactory proof of ownership. If this course is not approved by General Sherman, please let me know immediately, that I may countermand it.

Truly, yours,
