been taken by suipnse by the motion, and he
hoped the honorable mover would consent to let

tion submitted at the end of three weeks which
ought to have been made on every occasion that
offeied He could assuie the gentleman that he
had no intention to take anybody by surprise,
and, consistent with  the sense of duty he felt
I upon this sub]ect, he could not accede to the gen-
tleman 's piopoMtion
