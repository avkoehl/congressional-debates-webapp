call notice to the fact that if this mass of duty had not been accomplished by invalids it would have occupied at least an equal number of able-bodied men, who would thus have been withdrawn from the lines of battle, and in those days it was not easy to obtain all the able-bodied men that were needed for fighting purposes alone.

CHANGES IN ORGANIZATION.

The primary organization of the regiments was a union of six First Battalion with four Second Battalion companies. This arrangement worked imperfectly; the First Battalion men were on garrison duty, and the Second Battalion men scattered through hospitals, reporting to surgeons. The diversity of service and command rendered unity of discipline impossible. During March, April, and May of this official year the regiments were reorganized in such a manner as to consist entirely of First Battalion companies, while the companies of the Second Battalion reassumed their former numbers and returned to their original status as detached organizations.
