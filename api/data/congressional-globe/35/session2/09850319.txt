35th Cong....2d Sess. Reports of Select Committee on Naval Contracts and Expenditures.
Ho. ot Reps.
matter, he issued a circular to each navy agent,
requiring him to inquire of the contractor for arti-
cles in that line, his prices, and also that*he ask
the prices of two other parties dealing rn the same
line, and then" take the lowest bid.
These instructions were disregarded by'San-
dors', and many of the open purchases were, and
are still, made in the same manner of-Secor&
Co. Mr. Sanders denfed, under oath, that he'had
received, or expected to receive, any benefit from
this arrangement. But it is dangerous to allow
a practice under which collusion between the
agent and the " provider" is so, difficulty?detec-
tion.
A still more dangerous custom has been allowed
by Mr. Sanders within the past year. Latterly,
when lequis'icions Were made by the master work-
men, Mr. Sandeis-Vhas allowed them to indicate
from whom they wish the purchases made; and
in many cases he has allowed master workmen
to make the purchases themselves. In some cases
where requisitions have come to his office, and
he has had them filled by Seeor& Co. in his usual
way, it was found that men in the yard had riiade
the purchases already, and expected the navy agen t
to sign the requisite certificate and pay the money.
He testifies himself that he has too readily yielded
to that manner of making purchases* and that
mostof the open purchases latterly have been made
in this way. Why should the master workmen
seek to indicate the vendor? Why desire to make
the purchase himself? The danger of collusion
between the'seller and the rfiaster workman isin-
creased'as the number of master workmen in-
creases.'' Each becomes interested in increasing
{ the amount of open purchases in his department,
i either to favor a friend oifc-to share the profit. He
; judges of the necessity of the article; makes the
■ requisition; purchases the article; agrees upon the
: price; inspects it, receives it, and uses it; and yet
; the formal certificates are signed by others, and
| the navy agent pays the money.
| THE NAVAL STOREKEEPER.
This office is not created bylaw, and the duties
| of the office are prescribed entirely by the regu-
j lations of the Navy Department. The salary
, does not seem to be fixed by law, but the amount
' paid is $1,700 per annum. The duty of this offi-
i cer is to receive and take charge of the naval stores
| in the yard and deliver them upon proper requi-
l sitions for the use of the service. The following
I statement shows the amount of stores on hand at
[ the different navy yards, July 1, 1858:

It appears that, by the books of the Department,
there should have been in the yard at Brooklyn
stores of the value of $1,414,152 68 on th6 1st of
July last; but whether that amount is on hand or
not has not been ascertained. No inventory has
been taken for years. Anson'Herrick, the pres-
ent storekeeper, was appointed in March, 1857;
and during that year an attempt to make an in-,
ventory was commenced, but after some months'
trial was abandoned.
From the manner in which the books were pre-
viously kept, as shown by Herrick, it is utterly
impossible to ascertain the condition of the public ■
stores,from the accounts of the ^Department, until :
a detailed inventory is completed. Mr. Herrick 1
testifies that previous to his time, when a vessel j
was fitted out for service, all her stores of every ,
kind furnished were charged as expended. If J
the ship returned with a part of the stores On j
board, they were passed over to the storekeeper, J
and not charged to him. Thus the books of the ]
storekeeper showed that but. two comparing |
watches, furnished the forward officers on going ;
to sea, were charged to the storekeeper as on j
hand; yet there hfcd been fifteen or sixteen in the •
drawer. Of these, about seven were stolen; and,;
the storekeeper couU deliver over to the Govern- '
ment the two watches called for by the books, ;
and have several left. !
They also find that the present storekeeper neg- j
lects his official duties He is an active editor j
in the city of New Yoik; has no experience as a ;!
storekeeper except that, as a boy, he used to at- j'
tend a grocery store. He is seldom in his office, ij
and considered his duties well done when he jj
signed his name to receipts and returns prepared
by his c!ei ks,and carried to his office m New York ;
for signatuie. lie testifies that ins clenca) force j
was too small, and that the returns are behind, and |
cannot be written up for several mouths; that lie j
has two clerks, two wiiteis, one foreman, who
si^ns Mr. Hernck's name to receipts to contract-
or^, and seventeen iaboimg men; and yet he tes-
tified that lie did'not know that he spent one sev
enth of his time in the duties of storekeeper. To
use his own language:'
" I do not spend but veiy little time in the navy yard, for
tins lea-on : the-e papeisand document* aie brought tome
bv my i im-f clerk, who i* my .-on. whom I see every d iv,
or I'V tin; me^er.ger--one ot the laborer.- being employed as
aim'-i-<jn{ret. J appointed my own.son fir&tcleik, beoau>e
I could i[ave confidence in him. All the papeis tlnujue
neee^ary lor m^ to sign, when I am not at the yard, are
brought to me, and an account of all the business that is
done in the yard is brought to my house, and reported to
me."
Commander Rootes testifies that the force in
the storekeeper's department has always been tdo
large, and that this fact, and Mi*. Herrick's neg-
lect of duty, have been reported to the Depart-
ment. Without further detail, and referring to
the testimony, the undersigned report that the
civil officers of the yard have not,and do not, as
a general rule, attend properly to their official du-
ties; that their appointment has been controlled
by political reasons, and not by their fitness or
qualifications for their respective offices.
PHILADELPHIA NAVY-YARD.
The attention of the committee was directed to
one transaction at this yard. In August hist, a
requisition was made upon the naval constructor
for eighty oakum spinners. There were then em-
ployed ten to fifteen spinners, who were generally
" old salts" disabled for active duty, and yet com-
petent to spin oakum; the work is nothing but
rubbing oakum upon the knee. The naval con-
structor did not deem a greater force necessary,
and refused to sign the requisition. The master
calker brought it to Captain Carr, the commander
in the yard, who also refused to sign the requi-
sition. Thereupon, Hon. Thomas B. Florence,
a member of this House, came to Washington,
and a.-sked the Secretary to direct the eighty opium
spinners to be employed. It was referred to the
bureau of yards and docks. Commodore Smith
declined at first, bur he received a slip of paper
signed by Mr. Welsh, the chief clerk, on which
was written in pencil as follows:
"The master woikmen havm? made a requisition for
nighty additional picket, you will see that it is complied
with."
This was inclosed in the written application of
Mr. Florence. The order was then issued to the
commander of the yard, and the " oakum spin-
neis" were set to work. Commodore Carr testi-
fies that when the men came in he went down and
took a look at them:
" They were the lame, the halt, and the blind; but they
did the wot k. i made a placc lot them until they worked
the oakum up."
They were then discharged.
Ail the oakum spinning for a year was crowded
into a few weeks. The undersigned refer to the
testimony of Mr. Florence for the motive ot this
transaction.
- REMEDY FOR ABUSES.
Your committee have directed their attention,
as far as time would permit, to fhe best rriode'of
correcting existing abuses in the management of
navy-yards. They have CQn^dered <hpt;lx^r  ist,
all or<some of the'navy-yaws coafd; not^ dis-
pensed with with advantage to the public service*
and the construction and repair t>f ves&els $e do-rre
by private enterprise; " " ,1 .v .• >„ , *
2. Whether work in all or .some of the navy-
yards could not properly be suspended; strxd tfiey
be placed in ordinary uritil existing" abuses tire
corrected,"or the state of the'Treasury will allow
further improvements. Your committee have hot
fully considered these propositions and do not re-
port upon them. ' *
. All work in the navy-yards or upon -vessels of
the United States depends upon the annual ap-*
propriations of Congress; so that Congress, by
granting or withholding appropriations, may de-
termine these questions without changing exist-
ing laws.
In concluding their report upon this branch of
the investigation, the undersigned call the atten-
tion of Congress to the necessity of a general Jaw
prescribing the manner of making Government
contracts The existing Ja\ys consist of detached
sections of various laws, in most cases attached
to appropriation bills, and often unconnected with
each other. It is difficult to ascertain- frotfHhe
law the powers and duties of officers authorized
to make contracts. Abuses, therefore, 'naturally
occur. The undersigned at this late period of the
session have not time to mature a bill', but deem
it their duty to call the attention of Congress to
the subject.
CONTRACTS FOR MACHINERY.
The inquiry of your committee info the con-
tracts for machinery for the vessels of the United
States has been mainly confined to the contracts
made for the machinery of the vessels now-build-
ing under the act of June, 1858.
On the 26th of July sealed proposals, were in-
vited by the Secretary of the Navy for the steam
machinery, &c;, for the seven sloops-of-war au-
thorized by that act. The specifications did* not
prescribe the form, plan, or details of the ma-
chinery, but promised a drawing of the section
of the vcssel-to any one making application there-
for. It required the bidder to guaranty certain re-
sults, such.as power, speed,-economy of fuel, and
the like, but left the design and the arrangement
of the machinery with the party'whose proposi-
tion should be accepted. CJnder these specifica-
tions proposals were made by most of the lead-
ing marine engine builders in the United States,
accompanied in each case by plans and drawings.
