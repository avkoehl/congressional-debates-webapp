General S. COOPER,

There are ten war vessels and seventy-eight transports at Hilton Head, and a larger number than is usual at that point.

HEADQUARTERS, Savannah, November 11, 1864.

Lieutenant General WILLIAM J. HARDEE,Commanding, &amp;c.:

GENERAL: Captain Hatch informed me confidentially to-day that he was told by undoubted authority, General Foster, in conversation with an officer of rank, remarked on yesterday that "He was now satisfied he could take either Charleston or Savannah whenever he thought proper, or the time came to do so." Captain Hatch was further informed that General Foster's forces had been considerably increased of late. Because of the source from which the information is derived, Captain Hatch does not wish it known that it came from the flag-of-truce boat.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

L. McLAWS,

Major-General, Commanding.

Respectfully forwarded to General Cooper.

I attach but little importance to the assertion made by Major-General Foster that he can take Charleston or Savannah whenever he chooses. I have no information further than what is contained herein, that Foster's forces have been considerably increased of late. A transport with men left Morris Island a few nights ago, going south.

W. J. HARDEE,

Lieutenant-General.
