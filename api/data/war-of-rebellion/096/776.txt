HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF VIRGINIA, &amp;c., March 1, 1865.

Colonel Washburn's regiment I consider one of the best I have, if not the best; and as it has been much scattered I am anxious to bring it together for the spring campaign. The return of the four absent companies is very important to this end.

E. O. C. ORD,Major-General of Volunteers, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS TWENTY-FOURTH ARMY CORPS, Before Richmond, Va., March 1, 1865.

Colonel E. W. SMITH,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Army of the James:

COLONEL: There is a great want in the command of a corps badge. Considering the advantages of such a designation, I think all parties, both of the old Tenth and Eighteenth Corps, would cheerfully acquiesce in the adoption of a new badge. I therefore respectfully request the authority of the major-general commanding to issue an order making the Heart the badge of the Twenty-fourth Corps.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOHN GIBBON,

Major-General of Volunteers, Commanding Corps.
HDQRS. CAVALRY DIVISION, ARMY OF THE JAMES, Before Richmond, Va., March 1, 1865.

Send out the party immediately.

I am, respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. C. WHIPPLE,
