GENERAL: I attacked Wheeler's whole cavalry force at 4.30 this afternoon, inflicting severe loss upon him and taking 52 prisoners. On being attacked he retreated with a train toward Acworth. I have lost Lieutenant-Colonel Stewart, commanding Second Brigade, who is missing, and about 25 men and officers killed and wounded. I propose pushing him still farther to-night. After breaking their cavalry line I struck their infantry. I have turned their cavalry force toward Acworth. General Stoneman has arrived with one brigade.

I have just received your note dated 7.45. It was my command that cut the enemy's column on Dallas and Acworth road, not General Stoneman's. He knew nothing of it until after it was over. I captured 52 prisoners (2 officers), and killed and wounded a number, about 80. I am on the Marietta road at the junction of the Dallas and Acworth road, east of General Stoneman and in his front. I will not move in the morning until both men and horses are fed. I have had no forage for two days. The force I attacked was the whole of Wheeler's. Stoneman ought to pass to my front and relieve me.

Colonel, Commanding.
