Brigadier General A. L. LEE,

Commanding Cavalry Division, Baton Rouge:

GENERAL: Your report of the operations at Greensburg, Osyka, and Camp Moore, has been received, as also the rebel garrison, flag captured at the latter place. I am directed by General Canby, commanding this military division, to thank you and the brave officers and soldiers under your command, in his name, for the handsome manner in which your movement was executed, and the successful results obtained. This enterprise, contemporaneous with those from Vicksburg and Bayou Sara, destroyed many supplies destined for the rebel troops ordered to cross the Mississippi, and seriously injured their movement.

I am, general, your obedient servant,
