Colonel SAWTELLE:

Please have any obstacles on the railroads, such as indifferent or careless agents, at once removed. They are under military authority. Report such matters to General Haupt or Colonel McCallum. There have been no delays at Harper's Ferry beyond a most necessary one. Captain Wilson's complaint is trifling. If his department were alone concerned, or its accommodation of paramount importance, there might then be reason. Neither have there been delays at Frederick. I refer to this as true, so that you may say so to those interested. Hurry up lumber to Harper's Ferry. Stuart has just completed another circuit, but has not damaged the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, so far as heard from. It was a profitless raid to the rebels, and one we could not well prevent.

RUFUS INGALLS,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Aide-de-Camp, and Chief Quartermaster.

OCTOBER 12, 1862.

WILLIAM P. SMITH,

Superintendent Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, Baltimore:

W. W. Wright, my assistant at Harrisburg, telegraphs for cars to aid in the movement of troops. Northern Central and Pennsylvania Railroad being pressed to their capacity, can you help them? I suppose the movement will be of very short duration. The rebels will not stay long. Please communicate directly with W. W. Wright, and inform me of your action. I will probably see you again to-morrow.

H. HAUPT.
