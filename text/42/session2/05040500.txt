relief from import duties.
The SPEAKER. The States and Territo-
ries having now been called through for bills
and joint resolutions on leave, the next busi-
ness in order during the morning hour is the
consideration of the bill introduced by the
gentleman from Maine, [Mr. Hale,] and com-
ing over from the morning hour of Monday
last as unfinished business, being the bill (H.
R. No; 878) to relieve American-built steamers
and vessels from import duties laid -upon ma-
terials and articles entering into their construc-
tion, repair, and use. The pending question
is on the motion of the gentleman from Mas-
sachusetts, [Mr. Dawes,] to refer the bill to
the Committee of Ways and Means, and upon
that question the gentleman from Maine [Mr.
Hale] is entitled to the floor.
Mr. HALE then resumed and concluded his
remarks commenced last Monday. [See Ap-
pendix.]
Mr. COX. Will the gentleman allow me
just one moment?
Mr. HALE. I cannot yield for any debate.
Mr. COX. I would like to ask the gentle-
man from Maine how he facilitates the passage
of this bill by a short speech every Monday
which postpones action from week to week
and threatens to delay the bill to the end of
the session? If he is in real earnest in thi3
matter, let us have a vote on the proposition
he offers and on the amendment which I pro-
pose. I am for this bill; but I am for some-
thing that will really revive shipping as well
as allow ship-building, which will revive navi-
gation as well as help commerce. Under per-
mission of the gentleman from Maine, I ask
for the reading of my amendment.
Mr. HALE. One word in reply to the gen-
tleman from New York, [Mr. Cox.] I think
the House will bear me out in saying that I
have certainty been very forbearing in regard
to occupying its time. I prefer to have a vote
rather than take up time by more speech-mak-
ing. I understand the gentleman to be for my
bill, but he would like it better with his amend-
ment. I should like it a great deal worse.
The SPEAKER. Of course while the mo-
tion to refer is pending no amendment can be
entertained. The Chair will explain the par-
liamentary attitude of the bill." The motion
of the chairman of the Committee of Ways
and Means [Mr. Dawes] is to refer the bill to
his committee. If the previous question be
called and seconded, the first question will be
upon the reference ofthe bill. If it be referred,
of course that ends the matter in the House
for the present. If the bill be not referred,
then the previous question will operate until
the engrossment and third reading.
Mr. COX. If the previous question is voted
down can I not offer my amendment?
The SPEAKER. Not while the motion to
refer is pending.
Mr. COX. 1 mean after the motion to refer
has been disposed of.
The SPEAKER. By that time the morning
hour would probably be exhausted, and the
previous question not operating, the bill would
