render. I think I will succeed. Will know to-morrow. Say nothing to any one. Fifteenth Kansas will receive the ponies, and glad to get them. I want the company at Olathe to be furnished first. Horses are much needed on this part of the line. See that fifty ponies are sent to them immediately. Lieutenant Hadley will be in command of that company.

FORT SCOTT, May 19, 1865.

Captain JOHN PRATT,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Fort Leavenworth, Kans.:

Direct the troops on their arrival at Kansas City to procure thirty days' rations and forage for the same, and hold themselves ready to march at a moment's warning. If transportation is scarce then have the remainder of the men prepared with thirty days' rations and forage, with sufficient transportation, for active work. I will leave here to-morrow for home. Will go up the same line and will not strike a telegraph office until I arrive at Paola.

Brigadier-General.

LEAVENWORTH, May 19, 1865-10. 35 p. m.

Major-General DODGE:

I am in receipt of the following from Kearny. Send me all the horses you can:

KEARNY.

Brigadier General P. E. CONNOR,

Leavenworth:

Orders received and obeyed. All quiet west. Troops returning from pursuit. Our horses cannot run an Indian down; too poor. With average stock we can overtake them. Eastern coach due at 8 a. m. not arrived yet, 6. 30 p. m. Since above, coach arrived from east, reporting every station attacked by Indians between Buffalo Station and Elm Creek, on the Blue. Detachment Third U. S. Volunteers sent without arms from Leavenworth were attacked, train captured, seven killed and missing, and rest all dangerously wounded. They were repulsed from every station. I sent troops down, but have little hope of overtaking them with such unserviceable stock as we have.

Colonel, Commanding.

Brigadier-General.

FORT LEAVENWORTH, May 19, 1865-12. 15 p. m.

Major-General DODGE:

Have not received Order 86. How many officers will it require? Have you heard from Washington in reference to Captain Turnley? I understand Eleventh Kansas is ordered here to be mustered out. If so, that and the number to be discharged from other regiments will leave me short of cavalry.

P. E. CONNOR,

Brigadier-General.
