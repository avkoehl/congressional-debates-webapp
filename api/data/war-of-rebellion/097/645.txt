HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,April 8, 1865-6.55 p. m.

Brevet Major-General WEBB,

Chief of Staff:

I have received your dispatch of 5.45, and have ordered the troops forward again. Perhaps my previous dispatch conveyed an erroneous impression. I did not mean that the enemy were camped some four miles ahead. If we are to make a night march the rations which are up should be issued. The men are somewhat exhausted for the want of them.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General, Commanding.

General Miles has just reported that the enemy are encamped on the first high ground in front of him. I have ordered him to push forward his skirmishers and feel them.

A. A. H.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,April 8, 1865-8.35 p. m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

In my dispatch I should have ordered you to encamp, since Major-General Meade did not intend to require a night march. You have done all in getting up to the enemy.

ALEX. S. WEBB,

Brevet Major-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,April 8, 1865-9 p. m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

The Second and Sixth Corps will move at 5 a. m. to-morrow, and the Second Corps will attack the enemy (now in its front) at once, the Sixth Corps supporting.

By command of Major-General Meade:

ALEX. S. WEBB,

Brevet Major-General and Chief of Staff.
