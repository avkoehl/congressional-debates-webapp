These institutions, it is true, have recently, in common with
every othvi interest in the countiy, and with the whole commei
eial world, been subjected to serious embaí raímenla All
agree, however, though differing as to the particular causes
which produced them, that those embarrassments have beent|ie
result of very pecuhir and extraordinaiy circumstances The
banks, too which weic employed as the depositories and fiscal
agents of the Government, have, foi the most part, amid cir
cumstances of the gieatest difhculty, actually ditchaiged all
their engagements t) the Government, enoimously heavy aa
they were, inconsequence of the laige surplus levcnue 01 the
few who n«ive not yet done so, ha\e sausi ictonly secured the
comparatively small bal mees due from them, to be paid at short

sede the stionge&t arguments now urged m fa\or of such an in
sutution
In íegaidto the kinds of money in which tie public revenue
is to be collected, the substitute adopts, with slight modifica
tions, the provision of the currency bill of the last session of
Congress Itdeclaies that the public dues, of every descup
tiOTh for lands as well as customs, shall beieceivedm gold or
sdver, or Treasury notes, or such notes of specie paying banks
(under c rtainjestnctions, intended to promote the suppressien
of small notes) as the deposite banks subject to the supervision
and control of the Secretary of the Tt easury, shall agree to ere
dit to the United States as cash It will be perceived thit in the
proposition now submitted, I have postponed foi one year the
exelusion of the notes of banks which i=sue bills 01 notes undei
five dollar* It is known that many of the States authorize
notes under that denomination, and some who have heretofore
prohibited them will, it ig supposed, authorize the issuing of
them under existing ctrcumst&r ees andior a limited period It
is evident that the use of this description of notes, in supplying
the place of and consequently limiting the demand lor, specie
in small dealings, would (end materially to laci lítate the re
sumption of specie payments by the banks 1 his consideration
has induced me, under the peculiar circumstances of the times,
to adjourn for one year, the peno I of excluding the notes of
banks issuing bilis or notes undei five dolíais, and the sanie
consignation has prevailed with me, for the pnst nt, to hunt the
fnthei exclusion of bmk note^i to the issues ni «uch b mksas
shall, altei the expiration of twoyeirs, continue to issue bills or
notes utidtr ten dollars Jn doiu^tim, under the exigencies oi

I think tht re foi e Mr Piesideit, th it, unlet the provisions
of the substitute I h ive pi oponed foi the coii^uleratum of the
Senate, there woul 1 be no danger oí any unreasonibie e-iten
sion of discounts on the pubiu deposites I know, howevei,
there are gentlemen ot gieat intelligence and patriotism \\ ho
aie for an abbOlutepiohibifion of the bmks discounting, to my
extent however modeiate, on the public depositee, and who
favoi as the means ofcairving out that prohibition, a -^stem «f
sp^Cí-íKlepo ites The hightesnect I enteitain foi the opinions
oí those gentlemen has induced me to consider their sngges
tion, with moie than 9idiaary anxiety to cometo the same eon
elusions, but after thorough examination and reflection, ac"
coiding-. o the best lights of my undei standing, I am tatt&fied
that no system of special deposite?, however specious mtheoiy,
could be worked out in praetice, without involving con&e
quences which they themselves (oratleasta largemajonty of
them) would promptly icpudiate In the first place, it is de
monatrable, I humbly conceive, that any system of special do
posites, to be pi acticai and efficient, must lead to a collection of
the revenue, directly or induectly, in specie, and the they
oppose as earnestly as Ido The Government must always
hold itself ready to pay its creditors in the lawful cun ency of
the country, it demanded This the banks are bound to do, on
behalf of the Government, under the g-enerai deposite system
But if you adopt the special svsteni, and collect the revenue, at
the same time, in banic notes, the banks would be hound to pay
out to the public creditoi only the identical notes deposited
with them, for this is the fundamental and immutable idea of
a special deposite How, then, would such a system tcoiU
The public creditor would pie*enthis warrant to a deposite
bank, the bmk wouldoifer him, in payment, first this note, and
then that, which had been specially "deposited with it, but none
of these notes faulting the convenience ol the creditoi, and the
bank being bound to pay no other, the public claimant would
go unpaid, and the engagements of the Government dishonored.
To avoid the danger oí such a rehuir, the Government, if it
adopted a system t f xpeciul deptisites would be tinven, of ne-
ress'Kyjto acnllection of the revenue in gold ard silver, or,
otherwis" receiving the notes of specie paying banks pro forma9
collect the specie ior them Irom the banks by which they
were issued, and jilace that specie on special depofite But
where would be the diííeience, m the piacticai eiLeta on lhe
