Senate.
Defense of President Grant—Mr. Logan.

latterly. I find in it many of his speeches.
If ho were here now I would, as one who has
been his steadfast friend, beg of him to ex-
clude from that history of himself this last
speoch. It is a pleasant history to read so far
as it has been written, but I say to him its
pages will be marred by this malignant phil-
lipic against President Grant, filled as it is
with venom and gall from one end to the
other.
Let us compare the tanner President with
the magnificently educated Senator from Mas-
sachusetts, who has accomplished so much,
and see liow he will stand the comparison.
The Senator from Massachusetts has lived his
life without putting upon the records of his
country a solitary act of his own origination
without amendment by other men having more
understanding than himself in reference to men
and things. General Grant, the President
of the United States, a tanner from Galena,
has done what? He has written his history
in deeds which will live. So long as pens
are dipped in ink, so long as men read and
so long as history is written, the history of
that man is worth something. It is valuable ;
it is not a history of glittering generalities and
declamation in speeches, but it is a history
of great deeds and groat things accomplished
for his country.
In 1861, soon after the breaking out of the
war, we found this President of the United
States the commander of a small force on the
banks of the Mississippi river. On the banks
of the Potomac was a large and well-organ-
ized army, and the sounds were heard through-
out the land of battle from day.to day. When
the battle was over there was but one thing
that trembled along the wires, and that was
the Army of the United States had again been
defeated. Defeat upon defeat followed ; and
never did you find your armies successful until
the fame of this little man was heralded (rom
one end of the land to the other. Every bat-
tle that he engaged in he won. I was with
him in his first battle on the banks of the
Mississippi river, the battle of Belmont, and
traveled through with the western armies in
the western campaign. If you will allow me—
and I refer to myself only to show the facts
within my knowledge—I hesitate not to say
that the man who says he is ungenerous does
not know him. The man who says he is nota
uian of ability does not know him. The man
who says he ever depreciated the character or
reputation of anotherdoes not know Ijiin. In
all his acts he was generous to a fault with
his comradcs, and no report did he ever make
in which he did not give full credit to every
man in the Army who had done his duty, as
can be testified to by every man who served
under him.
1 have seen him time and again in the hot-
test and thickest of battle, sitting coolly and
calmly, without parting his lips or lisping a
word, watching the different maneuvers of the
troops and the management on either side to
see how the battle was going. He was not a
man of many words. He gave his orders
quietly and saw that they were executed.
He was brought to the army of the Poto-
mac. He made a success; he won the battle ;
victory perched upon our banners; we suc-
ceeded ; slavery was abolished, and our coun-
try saved. After four years passed the people
of the United States made him President.
He is now assaulted because of his ignorance,
because he was a soldier, and charged with
having done nothing during his life to be
remembered. Look at his administration
and see if he shows no ability. How does it
eompare with others? I have not indorsed
everything he has done; nor do I believe a
friend is required to indorse everything that
anotherdoes in order to be his friend; but
take his administration generally, so far as the
material part is concerned, and so far as that
which does substantial good to the country,
and I say it has been a great success.
The Senator from Massachusetts said he did
not pay the debt, Congress did it. That is
perhaps partially true. Congress and the
executive department together do it. One
passes the laws; the other executes them.
But you may take the President's messages
and read them from the first to the last, and
no man has presented better State papers
to the country than has President Grant during
his administration. And in order to see
whether it is a success or not I will state right
here that the expenses of his administration
per capita axe to-day as low as the expenses of
any administration since the days of Washing-
ton, save four. . When you make an average
the expense of this administration per capita
is less than the administration of Washington ;
it is less than under the administration of
Buchanan in 1860. With the permission of the
Senate I will present tabular statements of
the expenses showing the facts to be as I have
stated them:

Tho expenditures per capita are shown to be, for I860, the population being 31,443,321, $1 95; and for
1871, the population being 38,555,983, $1 76.
Included in the expenditures as here given for 1871 is the sum of $10,733,759 05, or twenty-eight
hundredths per capita for the erection of public buildings, the improvement of rivers and harbors, and
other public works distributed throughout the country ; while for the same purposes in 1860 the expendi-
tures were only $2,913,371 48, or nine hundredths per capita. Taking these expenditures on account of
public buildings and works into consideration, tho expenses of the fiscal year 1871 of President Grant's
administration, notwithstanding the increased area of the country, the interest on Paeifio railroad bonds,
the organization of new Territories, &c., are shown by the following table to be as low and economical
as those of any Administration whioh has governed the country.
