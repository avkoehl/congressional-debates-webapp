with the Seventeenth in rear, to the foot of the mountains, and rested for the night.
On July 3 and 4, my brigade continued in rear of the troops (Hardee's corps), marching on the road which passes by University Place. The Seventeenth moved in rear of the brigade on the 3rd, and the Twentieth on the 4th of July, quietly and without being threatened by the enemy. The Twenty-sixth Tennessee Regiment rejoined General Brown's brigade on July 3.

On the night of July 4, we bivouacked on Battle Creek. On July 5 and 6, the brigades of Generals Clayton and Liddell occupied in succession the position of rear guard.

On July 6, the infantry, artillery, ambulance, and ambulance train of my brigade passed the Tennessee River on the pontoon bridge at Kelly's Ferry in three-quarters of an hour, and bivouacked in the afternoon at Wauhatchie Station, on the Nashville and Chattanooga Railroad. Here the movement, which will probably be known as the Evacuation of Middle Tennessee, terminated.

As I have not communicated with the officers commanding the Twentieth and Twenty-sixth Tennessee Regiments, or with those commanding the sections of the Eufaula, Maney's, or Dawson's battery since they left my command, I can only report from observation and unofficial information the part they took in the movement while connected with my command. I may make omissions in regard to them, which will not doubt be supplied by the commanders of the brigades to which they were attached.

The list of casualties in my brigade was forwarded on the 10th instant.

I submit the following recapitulation:
