MOSCOW, February 27, 1862.

Major-General POLK:

My scouts just in from Baltimore, and report 500 Federal cavalry at sunset this evening advancing from Baltimore towards Clinton. I have about 150 men here for duty after guarding bridges. If you will send a full force to meet at Clinton soon, on to-morrow morning I can capture them. Please sent me all the cavalry you can spare. Please answer.

T. H. LOGWOOD.

JACKSON, TENN., February 28, 1862.

General S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General, Richmond, Va.:

I am in despair about my health-nervous affection of throat. Bragg ought to be sent here at once. I will, when well enough, serve under him rather than not have him here. Re-enforcements are arriving.

G. T. BEAUREGARD.

CIRCULAR.] HEADQUARTERS WESTERN DEPARTMENT, Murfreesborough, February 28, 1862.

The columns will resume the march to-morrow morning in the same order, and continue it from day to day by Shelbyville and Fayetteville to Decatur.

The marches will be so arranged as to make about 15 miles a day so long as the roads permit.

By command of General Johnston:
