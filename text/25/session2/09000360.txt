uul «Q'n he expre, ed those sertiments to his con-
stituent^ Was be sincere m his professions to
them' And it so, I would inquire what new ray of
light has burs' upon his vision, to convince him all at
once that his own political course for years
has been not only in violation of the Constitution,
but one of supporting frauds and corruptions of the
deepest dj e1 Why these contradictory sentiments
at t e two placed "Was it the eflect of climate,
aimosphere, or the political sentiments of the au-
dience to v. hicli thsy were expressed1 In Tennes-
see 1 e was addressing a Democratic audience, at
Hartford, a high-toned Federal audience By the
Nashville speech I can prove General Jackson to
be one of the mo-t devoted, pure, and wise, patriots
that ever lived, by the one at Hartford, the most
corrupt and vile demagogue that ever disgiaced
any nation I could, sir, were it necessaiy, suc-
cessfully defend the conduct and character of Gen
Jackson against the foul charges which my col-
league has imputed to him, and, were I called on to
do so, I would need no other evidence than his own.
I would use his Nashville speech to his ímme-
diaie constituents which disproves all these charges
1 v. ould next use his evidence, given on oath, before
a celebrated select committee ot the House, when
and where he was, after being first sworn lo tell
the whole truth, minutely interrogated as to his
knowledge of Executive frauds, corruptions, or
usuipations, and in answer thereto fully acquitted
not only «he Executive himself, but all of the
Heads of Deparlmcnts,of any such charge or impu-
taron If, then, these loul charges had the least
foundation in fact, my colleague did not, as he was
bound to do by the solemnity of his oath, tell the
whole ti ulli But, sir, the conduct and character of
General Ja< kson needs no defence, his great pub-
lic st rvices, both in the field and m the cabinet,
constitute the brightest page in the history of his
countrj. He, sir, who is now in the evening of his
da) s, who has one foot m the grave, and the other
on the threshold, has served his country in various
stations, from that of a private in the Revolutiona-
ry war to that of Major General in the late war,
and Chief Magistrate of this nation, and against
w hose public or official acts, his vilest enemies can-
not point to the first act of corruption, or of inten-
tional error, needs no defence from me
Mr Chairman, I do not object to my colleague's
leaung his old Democratic party and friends, and
going o\er to ¡i" Opposition Let him go It he
has chingcl his opinions, and is now satisfied that
the course oí policy which he has heretofore pur-
sued is destructive ol the best interests and pros-
penty oí the country, I would sa-, he has done
right But, sir, 1 complain of his assigning reasons
foi his change ol party and principles which haie
no foundation in fact It is the charging of his
forroei party and political friends with corruptions,
and designing to undeimine and subvert this Go-
vernment, that I complain I would inquire, was
my ci llea^ie honest m his pnncpUs and course
v, nen he acted with this patt)1 If so, he should
hi\ charily to believe that the party are still
governed by the same honest motives whiUi
then governed him One thing is certain, and
tin' is, the reasons he assigns for his sudden
political summerset are not the true reasons for his
chanpn Men act fiom motive The motive which
piod k «d this «udden and unaccountable conversion
if his ippaipnt d votion to both men and princi-
ples to bitter haded, is a question for him and the
(ountij to determine Was it produced by the
powei an 1 influence of the Uni'ed States Bank?
Did he leceive pccommodations fiom this tnstitu-
t in to such an extent as to produce this, or was it
& thirst lor office and self-iagrandisement that
causei1 him to alienate and abandon his former par-
ty anl friends, and to throw himself into the arms
and embraces of his former pol tical adversaries1
These are questions which I leave the gentleman
and the con iti' to determine
TO Tlir PUBUSHFRS OF THE CT OBE
GrmtrMt n I herewith send >on for publication
the speech which I delivered 11 Committee of the
Whole on the state of the Union on the Indian
appropriation h II I desir% a^, that you will
publish the subjoined  co impendence,   which it is
intended shall accompany the speech. When Ine
charge was made on the floor, that my remarks on
that occasion were concocted or prompted at the in-
stance of others, I promptly pronounced the charge
to be "false—basely false " This I did from my
own knowledge of th? fact that the charge was
"false " I took an early occasion after the occur-
rence in the House, as an act of justice, to address
a note to the gentlemen who, I supposed, were
alluded to My note and their answers are here-
with enclosed I had another reason for address-
ing them Not intending that the responsibility
which I might have incurred by the course of my
remarks, should be divided or shifted upon the
shoulders of others, it was my object to show the
giatuitous character of the charge, and where the
responsibility rested It is a fixed rule of my life
to think and lo act for myself, and always to be re-
sponsible for what I say or do, and I take this occa-
sion to say, that the remarks which I made upon
that occasion were deliberately prompted by my
own views of propriety, uttered and applied as I
intended, upon a full knowledge of the lesponsibi-
Lty which I incurred in doing so, a responsibility
which then, as now, and at all times and upon all
occasions, I am ready to meet.
I am, gentlemen, veiy respectfully, youis, &o

Sir In íeply to your note of this day, I have to
say that your speech on. the bill to suppress Indian
hostilities, was not concocted or prepaie'l by me,
in wholeor in part, nor was it prepaitdby my
procurement, counsel, or advice, nor did I know
what couise of arguments jou intended to pursue,
or what you intended to say So far from it, I
did not even know you intended to make a speech,
until I was told you were on the floor I was then
busily engaged, and did not go to hear ¡on, vhich
I should, have done, had I been at leisure at the
time For the last five or six weeks, we have lived
at wnie distance from each other, we have had no
intercourse, except casual meetings on the streets
and m the Capitol You have at no time had anj
suggestions from me, )e=peclmgmatter lobe used by
you in a speech or in debate

Dfar Sir In answer to your letter of this date,
I slate, that jour speech made in Committee of the
Whole on th«> stite of the Union, on the Indian
apmopnation bill, was not " concocted or pie-
pared" by me, and was made by von xtithoul my
procurement, counsel, or idvice I did not know
that you intended to speak on that occasion, until
the day you obtained the floor, and after vou had
made an unsuccessful attempt to do so, and much
less did I know what you intended to say If by
the charge to which you refei, I was meant to be
embraced, as one of those at whose instance you
acted, I have to «av that the charge r- without
founda'ion in f let This I would have piomptly
said in Committee of the Whole, had it not been
manifestly improper foi- the Speaker of the House
to engage in debates of a partizan or personal
character, which might hazaid the violation of the
order and decorum of the House, which he of all
others is, bound to preserve and maintain. I can-
not so far forget my duty to the public and to the
House itself, while acting as its presiding officer,
as to permit myself voluntarily to be engaged m
personal altercation on the floor with any of its
members
I am, very respectfully,
Your obedient servant,

SUPPRESSION OF INDIAN HOSTILITIES.
SPEECH OF^R. TOWNS,
Of Georgia,
In the House of Representatives, May 23a, 1838—In
Committee of the Whole on the state of the
Union, the subject under consideration being the
bill making appropnations for preventing and
suppressing Indian hostilities.
Mr. TOWNS proceeded as follows
Mr Chairman From what has just passed
between the honoiable member from Virginia
[Mr Wisl] and from New York [Mr Fillmore]
I should feel encouraged at the prospect that the
venue will be changed from Georgia to New
Yoik, and that hereafter the latter will come in
for h«i poition of whatever infamy there may be
in Indian tteaties Sir, I shall not object to this.
In ordei to impart interest to the old and stale
story of Indian wrongs, and Indian frauds, I doubt
not the contemplated change will be wise and pru-
dent, my State, sir, has long borne in com-
parative silence the torrent of calumny that has
pouied in from the North and East upon her people
and her institutions She has looked on with
feelings of regret and indignation at the repeated
iflorts made here and elsewhere to disparage her
in the estimation of her sister States But, Mr
Chairman, she has never yet felt, because she had
never cause to feel, remorse for the past, or alarm
for the future. Honest in her principles, just in
her pretensions, humane m her policy, she could
but rely with confidence m the judgment of a
virtuous, and impartial public. From igno-
rance, fanaticism, or malice, she had nothing
to hope, nor had she any thing to fear. Her
course lias been onward, and if she has not
stooped to meet all the foul charges that have been
levelled at her institutions, it was because her own
self-respect and love of justice would not permit
her to mingle in an inglorious and unworthy con-
test
Mr Chairman, allow me to a?k what is the
immediate object of the bill now before the com-
mittee'' To furnish means of prosecuting the
Florida wi', and to prevent an Indian war with
the Cherokees To this bill amendments have
been offered by the honorable gentleman from Vir-
ginia [Mr. Wisf] and others, proposing important
changes in our present relation with the Cherokee
people To each and all of these amendments I
am opposed I can see in them nothing to autho-
rize my support, but much to require my oppo-
sition In the original bul aie provided the effi-
cient means of enforcing your own laws, preserving
peace and harmony on the fiontier of Georgia,
and enabling this Government, without the shed-
ding of blood, to administer justice with humanity
to those people, who«e welfare and happiness have
engaged so much of the time of this Government
and the nation. I would have been glad that a
subject of so much impoitance could have received
the calm con-ideration of this committee, free from
all the irritating topics that have been diawn into
the discussion But, sir, since it is otherwise, I
feel myself called upon, by every consideration of
duty, to ans\ er some of the arguments introduced
m this debate
It was t,a d by the honorable membei from Vir-
ginia, [Mr Wise,] "that he presumed the treaty of
New Echota would not be executed, as he could per-
ceive in the late communication of tne President
on this subject inuch to encourage the hope that,
in the end, justice would be done the Cherokees "
Sir, it is seldom we hear the voice of the honorable
member in support of any measure ol the Presi-
