GREAT CACAPON, July 31, 1864.

General B. F. KELLEY:

We left Hancock about 10 o'clock; rebels there in force; fought them some time, when they opened out with 10 or 12 pounder Parrott guns, and struck our smoke-stack the second shot. Fearing also our being cut off we came to this place; made narrow escape; one-half hour longer we would have been cut off. The company at Hancock and Sir John's Run coming along. The line of rebels as seen appear to be near a mile long with their trains. Any orders?
