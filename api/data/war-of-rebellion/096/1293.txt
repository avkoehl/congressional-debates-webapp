Brigadier-General ALEXANDER,

Chief of Artillery, First Corps:

General Longstreet wishes you to have some sensitive shells placed among the abatis in front of our lines, especially opposite Fort Harrison. He prefers that they be placed among the abatis covering the picket-line, so that should the enemy advance and endeavor to pull it away, they would explode and destroy any further attack.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

O. LATROBE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
