Captain SAMUEL CALDWELL,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General, Thirteenth Corps:

Your dispatch relating to the construction of the defensive works is just received. I had supposed that, owing to the stormy weather which has intervened since the abandonment of Indianola, it was necessary to give time to the troops, to include to-day, to place themselves comfortably in camp and to collect wood and water.
