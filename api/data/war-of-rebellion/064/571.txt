HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF EASTERN ARKANSAS, Helena. Ark., June 27, 1864.

Major General C. C. WASHBURN,Commanding District of West Tennessee:

GENERAL: I have just received, under flag of truce from Colonel Dobbin, a communication requesting the exchange of prisoners in my hands for some of the officers and men of the gun-boat Queen City (Numbers 26.), which was captured by General Shelby, C. S. Army, on Friday last, whit her officers and crew, at or near Clarendon, on White River. By the same source I learn that the boat has been burned after the removal of her nine guns, ammunition, stores, &amp;c., to this side of White River. General, I earnestly request that if it is in your power you send me a battery of light artillery, of which I have none at all, one regiment of cavalry, and at least 1,000 good infantry. General Shelby is in force, and if you can possibly loan me the troops mentioned, I will move on him instantly, and not without hope of recapturing the guns, &c., taken from the Queen City. The movement should be made without delay. It will readily occur to you that the 100-days' men are not fit for the service required. the Forty-seventh Iowa which you sent me are, many of them, youths from sixteen to eighteen years old, and also that the light artillery is indispensable. The rebel pickets to-night are within 18 miles of this place.

I have the honor to be, your obedient servant,

N. B. BUFORD,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
