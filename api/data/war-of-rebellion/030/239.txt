perhaps, take re-enforcements of 500 men from Gallatin. Report what force Harlan has, and what force will be left at Gallatin after his departure.

By order:

J. P. GARESCHE,

Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE OHIO,Cincinnati, Ohio, December 25, 1862-2.30 a.m.

Brigadier-General BOYLE:

Detention of steamers has been attended to. Don't think the raid as formidable as represented. Be ready to move such force as you can spare down to Bowling Green or Glasgow as soon as force from Danville joins at Lebanon, and order Bruce to Bowling Green.

H. G. WRIGHT,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE OHIO,Cincinnati, Ohio, December 25, 1862.

Brigadier-General BOYLE,

Louisville, Ky.:

If Morgan has no more force than you represent, you are strong enough to meet him at important points. Danville, Lexington, and Frankfort must be covered, and I have ordered Baird back to Danville. Call on Governor Morton for force you want.

H. G. WRIGHT.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE OHIO,Cincinnati, Ohio, December 25, 1862.

Brigadier-General BOYLE,

Louisville, Ky.:

We can't catch Morgan with infantry, if he is shrewd. Can't you mass the cavalry in your district in time to intercept him? With what you have and the Fifth Indiana, you will have more than he. I can't send any from Granger's command. Rosecrans tells me that Reynolds is to mount his infantry and try to intercept Morgan. Keep me advised of any movements of his. Morton will send you two regiments. Cyrus, Cassius, and Horace means Lexington, Frankfort, and Danville.

Very truly,

H. G. WRIGHT.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE OHIO,Cincinnati, Ohio, December 25, 1862.

Major-General ROSECRANS,

Nashville, Tenn.:

Morgan is 5 miles in front of Munfordville, with three regiments and eight guns. Some skirmishing to-day. I have instructed Boyle to mass his cavalry, if he can, and follow him up. Will keep you advised, so that you may cut him off on his return. Think Boyle has cavalry enough to whip him if he can catch him.

H. G. WRIGHT.
