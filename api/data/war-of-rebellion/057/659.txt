APRIL 11, 1864.-Scout from Stevenson to Caperton's Ferry, Ala., and vicinity.

Report of Major Lewis R. Stegman, One hundred and second New York Infantry.
HDQRS. 102nd NEW YORK VETERAN VOLUNTEERS,Stevenson, Ala., April 12, 1864.

CAPTAIN: I have the honor to report that in conformity with the orders and instructions received from your headquarters, dated April 10, 1864, I proceeded with a detachment of 60 men and 3 commissioned officers to arrest several prominent citizens residing on the south bank of the Tennessee River, near Caperton's Ferry.

The detachment commenced its march at 4 a. m. on the morning of the 11th, and proceeded directly to the north bank of the river. There, with the aid and assistance of Lieutenants Merriam and Brown, One hundred and forty-ninth New York Volunteers, we were quickly embarked in scow, dug-outs, and pontoon-boats, and, after much difficulty, succeed in effecting a crossing. Immediately upon reaching the south bank I deployed a strong line of skirmishers, under command of Lieutenant Kelsey, and marched swiftly up the road to our first point of destination. In the mean time, however, I had captured two young men lounging near the river bank, and impressing one to act as a guide I forwarded the other to the north bank under guard, to be held as hostage for the good behavior of his brother. We reached the residence of Mr. Hugh Caperton, and, discovering said person in an adjacent field, I immediately arrested him. Following the lower mountain road, under the direction of our guide, I filled to the right, halting for a movement at the house of a Mr. Marshall, a citizens desirous of taking the oath, and, after some conversation, gaining information, I proceeded onward, arresting Mr. Adam Caperton, and discovering by search and inquiry that Mr. Thomas Caperton, one of the parties noticed for arrest, was a soldier in the rebel service, and had not been at home or seen in his immediately neighborhood for several months past. Retracing our steps, throwing our another line of skirmishers to our then front and holding our former first line as rear guard, I advanced to the left of Mr. Hugh Caperton's (as noted on appended diagram*) and advanced to the residence of Mr. John E. Caperton. This person I discovered to be absent from home, having gone to the top of the mountain. From searching inquiry I became convinced that this man has been endeavoring for more than a week to reach Stevenson for the purpose of taking the oath of allegiance. We then proceeded to the late residence of Mr. Sam. Norwood, finding, however, that he had long since vacated, removing to some inner county, his present place of residence. I arrested the man who at present occupies the premises first named, a person named John Loweree. The house noticed on the map as Norwood's house, near the coal bank, on the mountain top, has been utterly destroyed by fire. In each case i made thorough investigation, searching the premisses for all articles contraband of war, but discovered nothing. Houses and outhouses, pens for animals, everything bearing the look of a depository for guns or Government property were diligently scrutinized, without effect.
