31st Cong 2d Sess.
Finances of the Government—Mr. Jones.
Ho. or Reps.
were, previously to that date, deducted
from the revenue before the latter was paid I
inlo the Treasury, leaving only the net re- '
eeipts to figure in tile annual statements,)
the aggregate expenditures for the first pe-
riod (per statement H) will be seen to
have been  76,230,541 83
Averaging 25,410,180 61
For the second period  137,189,666 97
Averaging  45,729,838 99
And for the third period 134,106,755 18
Averaging *. 41,702^31 39
It thus appears that these largely-increased expenditures
commenced in the year 1845-M6, and in consequence of the
war with Mexico ; and it will be shown that bv reason of
our new acquisitions of territory, and the fulfillment of the
obligations of the Government resulting from that war, a
•cntinuanpe of these expenditures will be required for an
indefinite period."
From this extract from the Secretary's report
it will be seen that he says " these largely-increased
expenditures commenced in the year 1845-'46, and
in consequence of the war with Mexico;" which he
seems to hope, and labors to prove, "will be re-
quired for an indefinite period."
The Secretary selects three periods of three
years each, for which he gives the gross expendi-
tures, exclusive of trust funds, publicdebt, and ex-
penses of collecting the revenue from customs,lands,
&c. The expenditures of the first period, inclu-
ding the years ending June 30,1843-'44-'45, or im-
mediately preceding the war, were $63,833,704 93,
being an annual average of $21,277,901 64. This
statement I presume is correct. I have not deemed
it necessary to investigate it further, satisfied that
it is full large, and equally well satisfied that this
Government should now be administered for an
amount not exceeding the annual average of the
first period selected by the Secretary.
The second period includes the several fiscal
years ending June 30, 1846-7—'8, being the first
three years under the Administration of Mr. Polk,
and also " embracing the period of the war" with
Mexico. The aggregate expenses of this period,
exclusive of trust funds, public debt, and expenses
of collecting the revenue from customs, lands, &c.,
as given by the Secretary, were $125,201,017 11,
averaging $41,733,672 37. This, it will be rec-
ollected, was in time of war, when we had to sup-
port in the enemy's country our army of from forty-
four to forty-five thousand men. The third and
last period selected by the Secretary includes the
several fiscal years ending June 30, 1849-'50-'51;
or, as he says, " the three years subsequent to the
treaty of peace." The aggregate expenditures for
this period, actual and estimated, is given in the
report, exclusive of trust funds, public debt, and
expenses of collecting the revenue from customs,
lands, dcc., at $116,922,178 82; averaging annually
$38,974,059 61. The Secretary should not, in my
opinion, have included in this last period the year
ending June 30, 1849. For notwithstanding the
treaty was ratified and peace restored between this
country and Mexico prior to the commencement
of that year, many of the troops were not dis-
charged and paid until after the commencement of
the year, ana consequently contained many of the
actual war expenditures. But it should not be
included in the third period, mainly for the reason
that the expenditures of that year were estimated
for and appropriated under the administration of
Mr. Pollc. And eight months of that year the ||
Government was actually administered by Mr. :j
Polk, and only four months by General Taylor. ]1
i I propose to institute a comparison of the i
i receipts and expenditures under the Democratic
| and under the Whig Administrations of the Gov-
; ernment.
I For this purpose I shall select the three years
j ending June 30, 1846-'7-'8, as the period during
which the administration was in Democratic
hands. In the second period I shall include the
years ending June 30, 1850-'l-'2, during which
the Whigs are charged with the administration of ,
the Government; leaving the year ending June
30, 1849, to be considered and commented upon
\ separately and independently of either of the
above periods, because it does not properly belong
to either. It was the year immediately succeed- ;
ing the termination of the war; was estimated for
end the appropriations made under the Democratic
Administration; and two thirds or eight months :
of the year, the Government remained in Demo-
cratic hands. And during the remainder of the
year, while the Government was being adminis-
tered by the Whigs, no session of Congress inter- i
vened, and consequently they could get no addi-
tional appropriations until some time after the ;
expiration of the fiscal year; but were mainly, if I
not entirely, limited to the simple expenditures of I
the money appropriated and applicable to the
service of that year.
For a more comprehensive view and better un-
derstanding of this subject, I will refer to and.ex-
amine separately the expenditures of the respect-
ive years included in the two periods I have
selected, as well as of that ending with June,
1849. j

accuracy, I suppose, in the accounts, such sur-
rendered Treasury notes wqre charged as receipts
into the Treasury, and the bonds issued in lieu
thereof were credited as payments by that De-
partment. Deduct this sum of $7,080,378 Treas-

of the year—$58,241,167 24—and there will re-
