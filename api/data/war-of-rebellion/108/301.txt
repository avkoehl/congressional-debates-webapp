be made in this direction. An attempt will probably not be made with a less force than 10, 000, with a strong artillery force. To drive that force in I shall have two available pieces of artillery and probably 1, 500 of infantry. Though I think this force would drive the enemy in, it is hardly enough to count upon. I would prefer to have at least 5, 000 men and four other pieces of artillery; some heavier pieces than we have here. I hope the general will let me have his views upon the subject as early as possible. On my arrival here on the night of the 15th I found that Colonel George H. Steuart's regiment had at his request been allowed to remain here for another tour. This gives me six regiments here instead of five, as I understood the arrangements. It is none too many, and as they are quite comfortable here, mostly housed, I have kept them. This is the weak point of the advance line, and should therefore be better guarded. This point guarded will protect the flank and enable the forces from all the other points to make an easy retreat via Annandale and to make a strong fight on the other side of the Accotink, if necessary or expedient. I hope the general will make us another visit as soon as he can.

I remain, sir, very respectfully, your most obedient servant,

JAMES LONGSTREET,

Brigadier - General, Commanding.
