Among the many who deserve special mention are First Lieutenant Thomas J Hyatt, acting adjutant, and Sgt. Major James W. Moffat, for their bravery and gallant conduct on the field of battle, both of whom have since been promoted; also First Sergt. John M. Russell, Company D, killed; Private Alvin V. Brashier, Company C, killed; and here I cannot refrain from special mention of the gallant color bearers of this regiment, Corpl. D. W. Welch, Company C, killed; Sergt. J. J. Bricker, Company H, Captured, and Sergt. Abram Colgrove, Company K, wounded, while gallantly standing by their colors in line of battle.

Corpl. James Love, Company H, at the battle of Monocacy, seeing the color bearer of another regiment fall, seized the colors and waved them defiantly two or three times, but was shot down seriously wounded and has since died.
