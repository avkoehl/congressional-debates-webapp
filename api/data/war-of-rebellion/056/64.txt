CHATTANOOGA, November 6, 1863-7 p.m. [Received 9th.]

Major-General HURLBUT:

Retain Tuttle's division, if necessary, at Corinth or east of there until re-enforcements from Steele reach you. Send him forward, however, as soon as possible. Discontinue railroad and telegraph toward Columbus. Urge McPherson to send Tuttle forward, if he has not already done so.

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General.

CHATTANOOGA, November 6, 1863.

Admiral D. D. PORTER,

Mound City, I'll.:

Can you not send one or two more light-draught gun-boats to Nashville? I want to send some steamers with rations to Big South Fork of the Cumberland. They cannot go without convoy. There is an absolute necessity that rations should be sent by this route.

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General.

CHATTANOOGA, November 6, 1863-11.30 a.m.

Colonel T. S. BOWERS,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

I have telegraphed Commodore Porter asking for light-draught gun-boats to be sent to Nashville. Let Rowley and Sid. Stockdale make it a specialty to see quartermasters and commissaries and get off as soon as possible rations to Big South Fork. Make any order necessary to secure this result in the promptest manner. As soon as it can be known when they will leave, telegraph Burnside, and me also. Boats going up should remain at Big South Fork until troops from Burnside arrive to take charge of stores.

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General.

NASHVILLE, November 6, 1863-6 p.m.

Major-General GRANT, Chattanooga:

The most reliable pilot says that the narrowness of the river and sharp turns make it impossible for steam-boats to tow barges up it. Above Burkesville it is barely wide enough for small class steamboats. I think there is no doubt steam-boats can get to Big South Fork. By morning there will be nine boats here suitable for the service. Low water prevents supplies from getting here from Cincinnati. Large shipments are on the way from Saint Louis.

T. S. BOWERS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
