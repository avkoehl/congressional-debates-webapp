ON THE FRONT, NEAR CHATTANOOGA,

October 6, 1863.

Brigadier-General WRIGHT:

Having learned that Colonel S. S. Stanton has been called on for a report of the part taken by the Twenty-eighth Tennessee Regiment in the action of September 19 upon the banks of the Chickamauga, and believing that he through modesty will omit an act of the most daring gallantry o his part, which contributes not only to his own fame, but adds luster to the conduct of the regiment, we beg leave to mention the same.

After the terrible onslaught made upon the enemy by your brigade, the Twenty-eighth Regiment, occupying the left center of the same, slightly wavered as if being pressed back by the weight of the immense volume of lead that was poured against it. Our colonel seeing this rushed to the front of the line on horseback, seized the standard of the colors, and bearing them to the front, shouted for his men to follow, which they did in the most gallant manner, regaining the ground they had lost. While thus bearing the colors they were riddled with balls, being pierced not less than thirty times. We respectfully ask that this incident be incorporated in and made a part of said report.

Yours, &amp;c.,

D. C. CROOK,

Lieutenant-Colonel.
