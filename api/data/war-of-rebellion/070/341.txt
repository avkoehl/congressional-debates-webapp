HAGERSTOWN, July 10, 1864.

I have just sent a scout to General Hunter requesting what you desired, and on receipt of your communication I sent an intelligent and reliable man of my own company to go also and carry your communication. Lieutenant Torrence, whom I reported captured was not, but while gallantly endeavoring to cut his way out his horse was shot and he wounded in three places, but he made his escape. I send him to Greencastle this morning to go on to Chambersburg.

A reliable citizen, just in from Boonsborough, reports no force at Boonsborough. Enemy left yesterday evening in direction of Frederick.
