efficient The clear powers given by the Consti-
tution ate wise and ample, they only requne
to be employed and executed with due energy
when the. occasion for their exercise arises. But,
sir, will any man undertake to maintain that the
civil authority and influence of the Federal Gov-
ernment is frit or duly respected upon any of
your exposed and excited frontiers > Yoo have
in feet no Government, no law, in those very
emergencies where Government and law are mpst
required'
What has been the history of the country in
this respect forseveral years past' What is its
actual condition now > A general spmt of disor-
der and insubordination has notoriously prevailed
for years, m consequence, m part, no doubt, of
the general diffusion of the feeling which dictated
thoaentiment embraced in the celebrated saying,
" I take the responsibility " The moral power of
Government and of law has ceased to have the
slightest effect, and the wishes or recommenda-
tions of the Chief Magistrate of the countiy have
no weight where they do not happen to accord
with the passions and interests of those to whom
they are addressed Witness the actual prepaia
Hon for war between the State of Ohio anil the
Territory of Michigan, a few years ago Theie
was an instance in which the President had only
to speak his fiat, and all would have been peace
and order instead of those hostile movunents on
both sides which were, undci the encumstances,
n great disparagement to our system I íepcnt,
that the Piesident had only 10 command his own
ministerial functional íes, and Hit country Would
have been spared the mortification of such occur
rencos; foi the Executive functional íes of Micln
pan were but the ministers at will of ihe Picsi
dent, and the entire government oi Michigan was
then but an emanation of Ftdtial powei, yet the
President, prompt! d by those inteeeats and tul
inga of m< re parly which arc lapidly supplanting
eveiy higher motive of action m the publieeoun-
ciis, dispatched a special mission, an embassy, to
negotiate with those whom he hud the authonly
to command, those whom his own adhertnls ad-
mit and asseit lie had a right to remove lioni tin u
stations toi a nitre dilkimte in political pun

We had ihstuibnncos, also, upon the Mi xnan

plcte then came tht disoideily movt nit nttt ujmn
the Canadian bordir,bul in ncithei cast win tin
laws at all respecied, or the authority of the eivil
magistrate eitherseen or felt Not only the pub
lie faith and honoi wert openly infundid and vi-
olated, but the peace of the country was abso
lutely endangered by the absence of all itstiamt
on the part of the Government It is tiue thai,
after the excitement on the Canada boundaiy
seemed to threatenan immediate lupture between
the United Slates and Great Bi nam, and after the
Governors of the adjoining States had been pie
vailed upon to issue their feeble pioclamations in
vain, the President did come foith with a procla
matton, which conveyed tin first authentic intel-
ligence to our citizens that the Administration at
Washington did not intend to connive at then
irregularities in giving aid to the insurgents in
Canada contiary to the obligations of existing
treaties and the law of nations From the same
time serving and electioneering timidity, on the
part of the Executtve bianch ot the Government,
we are every day exposed to the danger of being
involved in war with the numerousand poweiful
tribes of Indians on our western frontiei To
show in what little respect and consideiation the
authority of the Government is held on the fron-
tier, 1 ask theattenlion of the House to an extract,
which I propose to read, from a recent message
of the Governor of Wisconsin to the Territorial
Legislature
" 1" would suggest the propnetv of inemnmllrin j the \\ ar
pep imneiit re q,iestms th ,t a thous-in 1 stnnd of -inn  oi e
hall rifles and the other muskeis, with fixed ammunition
prepared for thein should bo lorwirdid It) Fort Crwlorei
as early m the siast n is the mvi,auon of the Mississippi
will permit, the arms to be suljci I to my orders tn cose of
emergency
' These precautionary measures I deem of the rust mi
porUnce to assure the reinov ti oí YV iiinelM^o Iiidnns early
in the spring to prevent intrusions on the property ol the '
ironuer settlers, .met to preserve peace «an the Indians, on |
our borders    arte unlesi the  Got eminent takes the proper I
ttcps to effect their removal early in the spring, 7 will as  '
sume the responsibility of rawing a mounted volunteer corps
of riflemen (and head them in person) sufficient to effect their
remooal fromthis Terrjiori/," %c
No doubt the object the Governor has in view,
in taking this course, is praiseworthy, his motive
is doubtless good, and the expediency of remov-
ing the Wmnebagoes may be unquestionable, but
I refer to the message to show with how little cer-
emony the authority and influence of the Fed
eral Government is set aside bv its subordinate
functionaries. Here, sir, it is manifest that the
country is in danger of having a warkmdled upon
its northwestern border, m which, besides the
sacrifice of lives, the blood and carnage necessa-
rily incident to a contest with the fierce tribes of
that region, millions of the public treasure must
be expended, and all in consequence of the gen-
eral prevalence of the opinion that public officers
as well as puvate citizensaie justifiable in assum-
ing " the responsibility" with or without proper
authority, whenever great interests and great risk
to the actors are involved in the issue VVe shall
see how this business will terminate, whether the
Pit sident of the United States or the Govemorof
Wisconsin will beai sway
But there is another evil consequence growing
out of the conduct and policy of the Government
in Ibis itspect which Í wish 10 bring to tin notite
of ihe House      1 speak of an Administiatton of
the Gov* i nment which acts with so much prompt
itude and energy in everything that lelatts to the
acquisition anti distnbutionof pationage,or when
thes   high and commanding qualities ait culled

and poweiless in whatevti  concerns the public

without peiccivmg it, we aie lapidly appi oximat
in^ a cusís, which will have asttong tendency to
settle fort ver the  pioblem of fice Government
Can a popular representative  system  be main-
tained '   is a due degree of ciltciency and energy
in such a Government compatible with the con
stantdt pendence of the Administiation upon pop-
ular influence and support'
How it has happened that so much debility
should be manifest in the extieise of eonstitu
Iioual  authority and   influence   by   the  Ftdeial
Govei nment at this peiiod, and how this state of
things should succeed, or rather accompany, the
highest, most arbitrary, and uoquestion ible ex
ereise of power by the Executive, in matters con-
nected with the public treasure and public patron
agt, ever successfully daied by a Piesident of the
United States, should excite inquiiy m the mind
of evei y patriot in the land    ¡such a combination
of debility and energy is not the result of acci
dental circumstances, nor is it a result without a
cause     There is, there must be, some existing
and operative cause at the foundation of all this—
one which is either new in the operation of our
system, or which is only now fully developed
There is, Mr Speaker, a cause existing, and
flagiant in its opeiaton, fully adtquate, in mj
judgment, to produce such a itsult—fully ade-
quate to generate the whole amount of evil which
now afflicts the country The Piesident, the head
of the executive branch of the Government, is
elected by a compact between men who are associ
ated upon principles which have no manner of
reference to any particular political system—no
one set of political principles more than another;
and hence they are men who are more apt to be
totally indifferent to the public welfare, or the
stability of our form of Government, than other
portions of thecommunity The political agitators
and leaders throughout the States combine to make
a President upon the principle of mutual favor,
patronage and Support They give their influence,
and entrap the people into his support, by ascrib-
ing just such principles and intentions to him,
from time to time, as suit the exigencies of the
case, and he, on his part, is to provide for all his
active followers
To consider the public offices, and all the favors
of the Government, as public spoil, to be thus
distributed, was first a stipulation in the com-
pact between the parties, and thence, of neces-
sity, it became an atticle in their political creed;
proscription is only the necessary counterpart of
this stipulation, and is not practiced, in general,
from any bad feeling towards the proscribed
The obligation on the part of the President to
provide for his active supporters is binding equally
upon his honor as upon his interests and pros-
pects If he should (ail to perform his part of
the contract in this respect, he would, for that
cause, be instantly deseited the obligation, like
the oath of allegiance, is mutual—each pailtj is
bound to give piotecticn and support to the other
When all the most impoi tant official stations are
filled upon such principles—when eveiy branch
of the civil administration of the Government
is committed to the management of men thus
selected, what ground of hope does or can exist,
ot a better state of things than now unhappily
prevails' Is it not clear that no one of these
e lanioious or efficient paitisans will or can evei
foiget thatihe Prt sident is the woi k of his own
oieation' Or can the President himself safely
fotget that he owes his station to the sei vices of
the men, good or bad, who now fill the public
offices } And is it not equally clear that a Presi-
dent elected upon such pnnciples can nevei safely
vt nture to turn one of his followers out of office,
except loi lomrbieach of bust ot otltet misdemeanor
looifioss tobe disguised oi concealed fi om ttie public ?
IVleie negligt net, howevei gloss, or imbecility in
oflict, cnti ne\ei be a cause of íemoval \{ a re-
moval foi any other cause than I have supposed
is ever made by such a Piesident, it will be of
some pool fellow who has lost his power to be
sei vice able to the paity, and who will then be
told that he is to go out upon the principle of ro-
tation in office, in Older to let in some follower
who has not itcetved his piomised reward Un-
dei the administiation of a Piesident elected upon
the pnnciples I have stated, the power of appoint-
ment and íemoval can only be exercised to ad-
vance parly objects and individual aggrandize-
ment, sucb is the inevitable result of the nature
and object of the compact upon which he was
elevaled to power
1 had selected the case of the charge d'affaires
at the Court of Naples, as a sinking illustration
of these views Mi Thioop, a devoted paitisan
of the Piesident, filled the station of naval officer
of the port of New York fiom 1829 to Maich,
1838, a place of consideiable profit and high re-
sponsibility It appeals ftom the information
which has been laid on oui tables, and by the
conclusive aigument of my fuend fiom Ohio,
[Mr Bond ] that the defalcation of the late col-
lectoi of New Yoi k could not have occuired but
by his connivance, or a total neglect of the du,ties
ol his office Next to the collector himself, this
man, then, stands before the public as the most
culpable of all the suboidmate officers of the Gov-
ernment, yet, it seems, he had interest enough
at court to escape the storm which he must have
known would soon break over his head in Amer-
ica, by getting a high official station abroad He
was either privy to the defalcation of the late
collector, or he must be regarded as one of the
most lucicv men of the age, to get so well-timed
a tiansfer bom New York to Naples Theie, it
appeais, he is deemed woithy to remain, afier all
the late disclosuies of his misconduct He is an
existing and striking example of the way in which
the spoils system operatts A faithless, or, at
all events, a most woi thless and negligent public
servant, ongijially appointed to a responsible and
profitable station, without any particular mentor
