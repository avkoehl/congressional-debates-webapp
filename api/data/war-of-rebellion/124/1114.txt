It will be observed that the foregoing figures disagree somewhat with the statement hereunto attached. This arises from the fact that muster-in rolls of troops known to have been mustered have not been received, and that I have as far as, possible given credit to States, for troops known to have been mustered in. The statement herewith gives their numbers as they now stand, after some months service in the field, in which they have in some instances been much reduced by disease and losses in battle.

The examining boards instituted in connection with this branch of the service, for the examination of candidates for appointment, present too, important a feature to be passed over without remark. Silas Casey, U. S. Volunteers, is president; one at Cincinnati, Ohio, of which Colonel Henry Van Rensselaer is president; and a third at Saint Louis, Mo., of which Colonel Daniel Huston, Seventh Missouri Cavalry, is president. Fifteen hundred and thirty-four persons have been authorized to appear for examination. Of this number 918 have been examined. Five hundred and seventeen are reported qualified for command, as follows, viz:

Qualified for colonels..................................... 13

Qualified for lieutenant-colonels.......................... 12

Qualified for majors....................................... 36

Qualified for captains..................................... 98

Qualified for first lieutenants............................ 137

Qualified for second lieutenants........................... 221

----

Total...................................................... 517

Four hundred and one have been rejected by the boards on account of mental or physical, disqualifications. Of the number favorably reported by the boards, 323 have been appointed; the appointments being confined, with few exceptions, to those regiments designated as "U. S. Colored Troops" in the tabular statement appended hereto.

It is possible that some meritorious candidates have been rejected by the boards, but the examinations have without doubt been conducted impartially and have resulted in giving to this branch of the service a class of efficient and well-instructed officers.

The colored troops have already established for themselves a commendable reputation. Their conduct in camp on the march, in siege, and in battle attests their discipline, their endurance, and their valor.

Soon after entering upon my duties in connection with this Bureau there was transferred to me, by your order, the sum of $10,000 from the fund for "collecting, drilling and organizing volunteers." Nine thousand dollars of this amount have been transferred to Major George L. Stearns, assistant adjutant- general of volunteers and recruiting commissioner for colored troops, and the remainder to His Excellency the Governor of Ohio, to be expended in accordance with the law making the appropriation.

My accounts, with the necessarily vouchers, have been duly rendered to the proper officers of the Treasury Department, and Provost-Marshal-General's Bureau.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

C. W. FOSTER,

Assistant Adjutant-General of Volunteers.
