KNOXVILLE, TENN., June 29, 1862.

Colonel THOMAS H. TAYLOR,

Commanding First Brigade:

COLONEL: I am directed by the major-general commanding to forward for your information a copy of a dispatch,* now inclosed, which has just been received from Major Harper at Maynardville. He desires that you will keep a vigilant lookout for any advance of the enemy and advise Colonel Reynolds of their approach. If necessary you will fall back toward Blain's Cross-Roads until you can form a junction with Colonel Reynolds of their approach. If necessary you will fall back toward Blain's Cross-Roads until you can form a junction with Colonel Reynolds, who will move up to your support. You will also give General Barton like information of the enemy's advance, and if it be in force he will move his command to support you. With these the enemy can be held in check until Brigadier-General Stevenson, upon being informed by you, can bring up his command to co-operate with you, if this co-operation be requisite. It is probable this may be a foraging party, in small force, of the enemy, and, if so, it may give you an opportunity of engaging them.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. L. CLAY,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

KNOXVILLE, TENN., June 29, 1862.

Brigadier General S. M. BARTON,

Commanding Fourth Brigade:

GENERAL: I am directed by the major-general commanding to forward for your information a copy of a dispatch, now inclose, which has been received from Major Harper at Maynardville. This is probably but a small foraging party of the enemy. If, however, it be an advance in force Colonel Taylor has been ordered to fall back in the direction of Blain's Cross-Roads and effect a junction with Colonel Reynolds. Upon receiving information from Colonel Taylor or Colonel Reynolds of such an advance in force you will promptly move your command to their support, and with them hold the enemy in check until the arrival of General Stevenson.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. L. CLAY,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

Colonel A. W. REYNOLDS,

Commanding Third Brigade, Blain's Cross-Roads, Tenn.:

COLONEL: I am directed by the major-general commanding to forward for your information a copy of a dispatch, now inclosed, which has just been received from Major Harper at Maynardville. It is probable the troops referred to by Major Harper are a foraging party, which may not require your co-operation with Colonel Taylor. In the event, however, it be an advance in force, you will move up to his support and, with him, hold the enemy in check until the arrival of Generals
