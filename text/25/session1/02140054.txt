Apart of th° ineara&r's had betu discharged in
bills two thirds on credit, payable to the bearer, but
which, in fact, the Treasury was not able to pay
when due. The remaining thud had been inscribed
m the Great Book, uader the name of consolidated
third For the payment of the forced requisitions
to which they had been obliged to have recourse,
there had been issued bills íeceivable m payment
of the revenues Finally, the Government, m order
to satisfy the most imperious wants, gave orders
upon the Receivers General, delivered in advance
to contractors, which t1. ey negotiated before they
began to furnish the supplies foi which they were
the payment"
This, resumed Mr B. was the condiüoi of the
French finances when Bouapaile became first
consul at the close of the year 1799 The cuirency
was m the same condition, no specie, a degraded
currency of assignals, ruinously depreciated, and
issued as low as ten sou" That great nan imme
diately began to restore order to the flinnces, and
«olidity to the currency Happily a peace of three
years enabled him to complete the great work, be-
fore he was called to celebrate the immortal cam-
paigns ending at Austeriitz, Jena, and Fnedland
At the end of three years—before the rupture of
the pence of Amiens—the finances and the cur-
re cy were restored to order and to solidity, and, at
the end of six years, when the vast establishments,
and the internal ameliorations of the impenal Go
veinment, had carried the annual expenses to eight
hundred millions of francs—about one hundred and
sixty millions of dollars—the same historian, copy-
ing the words of the minister of finance, thus
speaks of the Treasury, and the currency
"The resources of the State have increased be-
yond its wants, the public chests are full, all pay-
ments are made at the day named, the orders upon
the public Treasury have become the most ap-
proved bills of exchange #-***#* Tne
finance1- are m the most happy condition , France
alone, among all the States of Europe, having no
paper money "
What a picture' how simply, how powerfully
drawn ' and what a change m six years' Public
chests full—payments made to the day—orders on
the Treasury the best bills of exchange—France
alone, of all Europe, having no paper money ,
meaning no Government paper money, for theie
were banl notes of five hundred francs, and one
thousand francs A Government revenue oí one
hundred and sixty millions of dolíais wis pai 1 in
gold and silver , a haul money curiency, of fue
hundred and lifty millions of dolíais, saturated all
pirts o[ France with specie, and made gold and
silver the every day currency of eveiy man, w o-
man and child, in the empire These great results
were the work of six years, and were accomplished
by the simple process of gradually requiring hard
money payments—gradually calling in the assig-
nats—increasing the branch mints to fouiteen, and
limiting the Bank of France to an issue of large
notes—five hundred fiancs and upwards This sim-
ple process produced these results, and thus stands
th French currency at this day, for the nation has
had the wisdom to leave untouched the financia
system of Buonaparte
I have repeatedly given it as my opinion—many
of my speeches declare it—that the French curren-
cy is the best m the world. It has hard money for
th Government, hard money for the common deal-
in 'S of the people, and large notes for large tians
actions This currency has enabled Fnnce to
s'and two invasions, the ravaging of 300,000 men,
two changes of dynasty, and the payment of a mil-
liurd of contribution's, and all without any commo-
tu n or revulsion in trade It has saved her {mm
th" revulsions which have afilicted England and our
A.i ieitca for so many years It has saved her
from expansions, contractions, and ruinous fluctu-
at o is of price It has saved her, foi near foity
yeirs, from a debate on currency It has saved
her even ftom the 1 now ledge Oi our sweet-scented
phrases ' sound currenc.,—unsound currency, ple-
thoric, dopsic-d, mfla'ed, bloated, the money mai-
ket tig'it to-diy—a little easier this morning," and
all sucn verbiage, which the haberdashers'boys re-
peat    It has saved France fiom even a discussion
on currencv, while in England, and with us, it is
banks' banks' banks'—morning, noon, and night,
b eakfast, dinner, and supper, levant, and couchant,
sitting, or standing, at home, or abroad, steamboat,
or railroad car, in Congress, or out of Congress, it
is all the same thing banks—banks—banks,
currency—curiency—currency, meaning, all the
while, paper money and shm-plastei , until cur
very brains seem as if they would be converted
into lampblack and rags
The Senator from New York, (Mr Tallmadge,)
in his very able speech, has referred to the over-
throw of Bonaparte, effected by the paper system
of England Without going into the question of
the causes of that oveithrow—without looking to
the ice of Russia and the non-arrival ol Grouchy
on the field of Waterloo, and without consideimg
the numerous incidents, often trivial in themselves,
on which the fate (f battles and of empties de-
pend—it will be sufficient to cons de- what would
have been the fate of this paper system of England,
if, like the system of France, it had been exposed
to the 'hocks of invasions, conquest, and changes
of dynasty, and, leaving out this supposed view,
it will still be sufficient to look at it under its real
aspect, and to see its present effects on the condi-
tion of the British empire What are those effects'2
They are, in brief, an ncrease of taxes fiom 1694,
when the Bank of England was chartered, from
foui millions sterling (twenty millions of dollars)
to forty-five millions sterling, (two hundred and
twenty-five millions of d illars,) an increase of the
public debt from twenty-one millions five hundred
and fifteen thousand seven hundted and forty-two
pounds, thirteen shillings, eight pence, and two far-
things, (to be precise,) in roundnumbeis about one
hundred millions of dollars, to nearmnehundred mil-
lions sterling, or four thousand five hundred rr ithoni
of dollars, and the mci ease of pauperism, until three;
millions ol people gi?ce the list These are some,
for I omit, as too well known, the average septen-
nial convulsions of that system these are some of
the evils of the paper system m England But take
another view—take some pomts of comparison
between the national expenditures of France and
England, when contending together, and see how
the account, in point of economy between papet
money and hard money will stand Let us take
the year 1806, when England was subsidizing
Russia and other poweis against France, and when
the Great Emperor frustiated the effect of all these
subsidies, and consolidated his power by the victoiy
of Fnedland, and the peace of Tilsit What were
the expenses of the two contending empires for that
yeai? They were these For England one thousand
seven hundred and seventy-two millions of fiancs,
(about three hundred and sixty millions of dolhr ,)
tor France, «even hundred and seventy-eight mil
lions ol fiancs, (about one hundred aim sixty mil-
lions of dollars ) m other words, the expenses of
Eng and exceeded those of France by about one
thousand millions of irancs, or two hundred mil-
lions of dollars Such was the diffeience between
the economy of papei money and hard monej, and
•he same proportion holds good m every station m
hie, from the Emperor and his empire, to the wash-
erwoman and net household
The amendment now depending, on the motion
of the Senftc from South Carolina, (Mi Calhoun)
is tne same m substance with the bill winch I
brought m upwards of a j eai ago, to re-establish
the cuirency of the Constitution for the i ederal Go-
vernment     That bill was m these words
" That bank notes and paper currency of eveiy
dcscuption shall ceiseto be received, or oifered m
pa>ment,on account of the United Stales, oi of the
Post Office, or in fees m the cou ts of the United
States, as follows of less dene mmation than tw enty
dollars, none shall be so offered after the third day
of March, eighteei hundred and thirty-seven , of
less denomination than fifty dollar--, none after'the
third day of March, eighteen hundred and thirty -
eight, of less denomination than one hundred dol-
íais, none after the third day of March, eighteen
hundred and thirty-nine, of less denomination than
five hundred dollars, none after the third day of
March, eighteen hundred and foi ty, of less denomi-
nation than one thousand dollars, none after the
third day of March, eighteen hundred and forty-
one , and none of any denomination from and
aftei the thud day of March, eighteen hundred and
forty-two
" Sec 2 And he xtfmllur enacted, That any per-
son holding an appointment undei the laws of the
United States, and any bank employed to keep
pubuc moneys, which person or bank shall neglect,
evade, violate, contravene, or m any way elude,
or attempt to «elude, the provisions of this act,
shall be guilty of an offence against the laws , and
the person so offending shall be liable to be dis-
missed from the service, and the bank so offending
shall, on satisfactory information, be discontinued
as a depository of public moneys "
The only dnect action of this bill would have
been on the receipts of the Federal Treasury It
has been extensively lepresented as a bill to im-
pose hard money upon the States, but such is not its
chaiacter, but the reverse, it was to prevent the
local paper of the States from being imposed on the
Federal Government Its indirect and consequen-
tial action have been to increase the speice circu-
lation of the whole Union, by creating a demand
for it ' The present amendment will operate the
same way it will increase the iuantity of hard
money every where Yet two objections, neither
of them well founded, and each inconsistent with
the other, hav e been taken to it one is, that it
proposes to take the better currency for the Go-
vernment, and leave tie baser to the people, the
other is, that it is going to impose this better cur-
rency upon the people alsc, and so destroy all pa-
per money at once, reduce every thing to the specie
standard, and rum all debtors Each of these objec-
tion  are equally unfounded Taken singly, they are
each erroneous, taken together, as we often find them
in the same speech, and they belong that class of
arguments which the logicians call the argumentum
ad tgnoiantiam, that is to say, an argument ad-
diessed to the supposed ignorance of the hearers
This class of arguments has been freely used by
gentlemen of the opposition for a long time , with
what effect the issue of the elections has often told
It is time to quit a, and to address the intelligence
of the community Take the better currency to
ilself' Why, the Government does not eat the
mjnej, but pays it back again the next day to the
people Impose hard money upon the States'
The mere reading of the amendment, or my bill,
which is the same in sulstance, disproves the asser-
tion No, the effect of the measure will be to in-
crease the gold and silver circulation for the whole
country Thus it has been aireadv Five years
ago, we began our system of measures to revive
the gold currency, and to increase the specie circu-
lation There was then twenty millions of silver
in the country, and no gold ; there is now upwards
of eighty millions, of which fifteen is in gold
True, the hanks have suppressed all this circulation
for the prtsent, they have shut down the hatches
upon the whole of it but this suppression cannot
continue mucV longei Tne law of the land, or
of public opinion, will soon prevail, and these in-
stitutions will have to submit
The bill before the Senate dispenses with the
further use of banks as depositories of the public
moneys In that it has my hearty concurrence
Four times heretofore, and on four diffeient occa-
sions, I have trade propositions to accomplish a
part of the swi  purpose Fast, in proposing an
amendment to the deposite bill of 1836, by which
the mint, and the braich mints, were to be included
in the h t of depositones, secondly, m proposing that
the public moneys here, at the seat of Government,
should be kept and paid out by the Treasurer,
tlmdhj, by proposing that a preference, in receiving
the deposnes, should be given to such banks as
s íould cease to be banks of circulation, fourthly, in
opposing the es abhshment of a bank agency in
Missouri, and proposing that tne moneys there
should be drawn dnect from the hands of the re
ceivers Three of these pi opositions aienow in-
cluded m the bill before the Senate, and the whole
object at whioh they partially aimed is fully em
braced I am foi ti¡e measure—fully, cordially,
earnestly for it
Some Senators suppose that it will be a great in-
jury to the local banks to refuse their notes m re-
venue payments, I think otherwise, and that it will
