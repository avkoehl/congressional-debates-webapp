stream of water. Already much work has
been done, and a grand park will be the re-
salt, every way worthy of our enterprising
citizens.
Mr. Speaker, the citizens of Albany are a
philanthropic people. We have two large hos-
pitals, where the unfortunate are cared for;
where the sick, the lame, the blind, are admitted
free of charge; where medical aid and sus-
tenance are administered; a medical faculty
in attendance to relieve their wants in that
hour "when the good Samaritan is needed to
bind up their wounds and heal their diseases,
with all the care and attention that any member
here would administer to one of his own beloved
family, and this done gratuitously, sustained
mostly by donations and bequests left by those
of goodness of heart at their departure, in
remembrance of the poor and afflicted in time
of need.
We have, Mr. Speaker, two large and com-
modious orphan asylums, where hundreds of
orphans find protection and a home. The
children are received in charge from the age
of six months, and there remain under the
fostering care of capable teachers adapted to
the education of the youth, and when they
arrive at a proper age for usefulness, the
board of managers under the law sanction
their dismissal to places of business or trade,
as the case may require.
We have a medical college under the juris-
diction of the medical faculty of Albany.
Over one hundred students receive their first
diploma in medical study in this institution.
Also a law school where are taught the first
rudiments of law by prominent lawyers of the
city.
There is one more important subject, Mr.
Speaker, that 1 would mention before I close,
and that is the deep interest we should all take
in the education of the children, in all places,
irrespective of color or national birth. I will
be very brief in stating some facts respecting
our academies and public schools. We have
in our city a State normal school which has
done much to elevate the standard of educa-
tion in our common-school system. We have
a male academy, laigely attended, under the
management of a board of trustees selected
from our most prominent citizens, where the
modern languages, and natural science, mathe-
matics, penmanship, and military tactics are
taught. Also a female academy, largely at-
tended, and most admirably managed. The
young ladies who attend this academy are
mostly those residing in aud belonging to the
families of citizens. Here their education is
finished, and they are prepared, many of them,
to be suitable teachers in our district schools.
We have also a free academy, and from the
last report, in April last, there were one hun-
dred and fifty-six students passed an examina-
tion and were promoted to classified studies.
These pupils are selected from the public
schools by a select committee, and those who
rank the highest in the different studies in
the schools are promoted to all the benefits
derived, to enter the free academy. We have
also twenty-two district schools in our city
under the management of a board of public
instruction. The daily average attendance is
7,699 scholars. The expenditures in detail,
for the support of those schools during the
last year, including the free academy, were
$125,309 44. The estimated value of the
school lots is $100,000. The estimated value of
buildings is $362,000, making a total amount
of $462,000 appropriated for school purposes.
And here I may add that those children who
attend the public schools are under religious
instruction in Sunday schools. We have in
the city forty-nine churches and sixteen mis-
sion chapels of different denominations well
attended, and a Sabbath school attached to
each church and mission chapel; and from a
careful investigation by the superintendents of
the different schools, there are eight thousand
children who regularly attend the different
schools on the Sabbath.
I will not p Along my remarks, Mr. Speaker,
any further, believing that the many reasons
I have endeavored to give show that Albany is
a growing, thriving business city, and is in
every way entitled to a public building.
I hold in my hand, Mr. Speaker, petitions
by hundreds from the merchants, mechanics,
and laboring men ; I hold in my hand a peti
tion of the common council of our city; also
a petition authorized by a public meeting of
the Board of Trade; I hold in my hand a peti-
tion of all the presidents and cashiers of every
bank in the city of Albany, which control a
bank capital of $4,500,000; I hold in my hand
the petition of the present comptroller of the
State of New York, and the secretary of State,
the State treasurer, State engineer, and the
State senator from Albany district; also every
Government official in our city. Mr. Speaker,
is not the language of Scripture explicit and
sufficient to*demonstrate that point? "One
thing thou lackest;" and that is a United
States Government building, so urgently rec-
ommended and needed here. And lastly,
Albany has paid so much money into the
United States Treasury that she is justly and
fairly entitled to the appropriation asked for
in the bill before the House for a public build-
ing in the city of Albany.
Naval Appropriations.
SPEECH OF HON. G. W. MORGAN,
of oiiio,
Is the House of Representatives,
February 13, 1872.
The House being in Committee of the Whole on
the state oftheUnion, and havingunder considera-
tion the bill (H. B. No. 1191) making appropriations
for the naval service for the year ending June 30,
1873, and for other purposes-
Mr. MORGAN said :
Mr. Chairman : l am glad that the bill be-
fore this committee is under the charge of the
able and eloquent gentleman from Maine,
[Mr. Hale.] I am gratified that it has
received the best defense which could have
been made under the circumstances. And
before I proceed, I cannot but express the
gratification I feel at seeing in their seats
the honorable gentleman from Massachusetts,
[Mr. Dawes,] the recognized leader of the
forces of President Grant upon this floor, and
my honorable colleague, the chairman of the
Committee on Appropriations, [Mr. Gar-
field.] _ I have certain charges to make, and
to sustain by proof, which I will be happy to
hear either of those gentlemen explain, and
if they can successfully do so, I will, as every
other good citizen should do, feel gratified.
The bill under discussion asks for a naval
appropriation of $18,000,000 for one year. To
show how modest is this demand the gentle-
man from Maine [Mr. Hale] institutes a com-
parison between the naval expenditures since
the civil war and during the six or seven years
preceding that calamity. He gives the fol-
lowing statement as prepared in
THE NAVY DEPARTMENT.
" I have taken from the books of the Navy Depart-
ment a statement of the expenditures for the Navy
from the year 1855 to 1861. Let us see what they gay.
Here is the table:
185 5 $14,518,833 16
185 6  15,974,254 31
185'  14,480,431 30
185 8  15,689,103 53
185 9  15,347,656 79
106?  14,077,644 62
1861  14,856,801 71
That statement was made out the other day.
Let us compare it with the statement made in
the last report of Secretary Boutweli:
Naval
Years. expenditures.
185 5 514,074,834
185 6  12,651,694
185 7  14,053,264

185 9  11,514,649
186 0  12,387,156
Total S80,072.524
The discrepancy between the statements
of the Navy and Treasury Departments is as
follows:
Years. Discrepancy.
185 5 !  $433,999
185 6     3,322,500
185 7  427,167
1858   998,176
1859   3,833,007
186 0  1,690,448
Total discrepancy •. .$10,705,307
I have thus compared these official state-
ments of the naval expenditures during a
period of only six years, and find that they
disagree by nearly eleven millions; that the
Navy Department makes those expenditures
$10,700,000 greater than they are made in the
financial report of the Secretary of the Treas-
ury for 1871. Which of these statements is
the true one, I do not know, and hence the
figures of my friend [Mr. Hale] amount to
nothing, for the statement of the Navy Depart-
ment is roundly contradicted by the statement
from the Treasury.
The civil war commenced in April, 1861;
the fiscal year ended on the 30th of June.
To show how wild and unreliable this state-
ment from the Navy Department is, it is only
necessary to glance at the naval expendi-
tures as stated by the gentleman from Maine
[Mr. Hale] for the year 1861. He gives the
naval expenditures for that year at $14,850,
861; while the Treasury report gives them at
$42,640,353; showing a discrepancy between
the two statements-amounting to nearly twenty-
eight millions.
Is it necessary to say another word to show
the utter confusion which exists in these
Departments, and their unreliability upon all
questions coming within their respective
spheres ?
Mr. GARFIELD, of Ohio. Will the gen-
tleman allow me to call his attention to
another matter? If he will pursue that line
of investigation he will find that the statement
of the public debt and of the expenditures
of the Government in any given year, given
by the Register of the Treasury, always differs
from the statement given by the Secretary of
the Treasury.
Mr. MORGAN. My friend will hear enough
of that before I get through.
Mr. GARFIELD, of Ohio. The simple
explanation of that is that the one officer
makes up his statement at one stage and the
other at another, and there is no discrepancy.
Mr. MORGAN. I am happy to hear the
statement of my friend, but I will show him, I
will prove to this committee, I will demon-
strate to the country that the explanation he
has given is not correct. I charge that there
is chaos in your Treasury Department, chaos
in your Navy Department, chaos in every
branch of every Department of this mal-
administered Government, and I will make
my charges good by proof.
One word upon this question of extrava-
gance. A comparison has been instituted
between the naval expenditures during the
years of peace immediately preceding the war
with the years of peace following the war.
What is the result? On page 367 of the
financial report for 1871, it will be found
that the total naval expenditures from 1835
till 1860, a period of six years, amounted to
