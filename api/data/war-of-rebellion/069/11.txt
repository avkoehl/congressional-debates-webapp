HEADQUARTERS SECOND CORPS,May 20, 1864-10.20 a. m.

Major-General BIRNEY,

Commanding Division:

GENERAL: The major-general commanding directs me to say that he gave this morning specific instructions that your troops should be brought back to their camps by marching in rear of the woods, out of sight. At daylight it was observed that General Mott's brigade was passing in front of the woods. A staff officer was at once sent from these headquarters to conduct his brigade, but owing to the fog it is not supposed that it was seen by the enemy. Another brigade or more of your command has come in an hour or so since, passing plainly in sight, in front of the woods. This Parker, my aide-de-camp, to pass behind the woods to a point opposite the place where it now is, not to come in sight again to-day. You will please send a staff officer with this column.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

FRANCIS A. WALKER,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
