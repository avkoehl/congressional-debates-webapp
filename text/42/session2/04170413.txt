Mr. MAYNARD. During last Congress I
insisted that all such applications should go
to the Committee on Military Affairs, and I
desire that that course shall be now taken. I
object to the present consideration of the joint
resolution.
Mr. DUELL. A similar bill has already
been passed this session. I hope my friend
from Tennessee [Mr. Matnard] will not per-
sist in his objection.
Mr. MAYJSTARD. There are so many of
such applications, that I must insist on my
objection.
Mr. STOUGHTON. There is so large a
number of these bills being constantly intro-
duced that I also must object to their being
passed without going to the appropriate com-
mittee.
Mr. DUELL. Then I move that the joint
resolution be referred to the Committee on
Military Affairs.

periods and at such compensation as the Secre-
tary of the Treasury may deem reasonable,
not to exceed forty dollars per month for each
person employed.

ize the Secretary of the Treasury to expend
the sum of $10,080, appropriated by an act

experienced surfmen to man each of the boats
at alternate life-saving stations on the New
Jersey coast from December 15 to March 15,"
in employing crews of experienced surfmen at
such stations and for such periods as he may
deem necessary and proper, and at such com-
pensation as he may deem reasonable, not to
cxceed forty dollars per month for each person
to be employed.
The SPEAKER. Is there objection to the
consideration of this bill now? The Chair
hears none, and the hill is before the House.
Mr. GARFIELD, of Ohio. The Secretary
of the Treasury has sent to the House a letter
in reference to tiiis bill, which is as follows:
treasury depaetment,
Washington, D. C., December 11,1871.
Sir : If the accompanying joint resolution author-
izing the amount appropriated for the employment
of surfmen on tho New Jersey coast by act of March
3,1871, (see Statutcs-at-Large. volarao 1(3. page 490,)
to be expended in accordance with tho provisions
of section twenty-seven of the act of A.prit 20, 1871,
(see Statutes-at-Largo, first session Forty-Second
Congress, pagel2, Littlo&Brown'sedition.jcould be
passed beiore thelSth instant.it would greatly facil-
itate the reorganization of the life-saving service
now in progress.
I am, very respectfully,
GEO. S. BOUTWEIiIi, Secretary.
Hon. J. A. Garfield, Chairman Committee on Appro-
priations Mouse of Representatives.
I will statethat theobjectof the bill is merely
this: the appropriation made for this purpose
for the last fiscal year restricted the pay of surf
men at life-saving stations to forty dollars a
month The Secretary of the Trc-asurv reports
that if we allow him to pay a less sum during
some months of the year, he can discriminate
in the use of the fund during the whole year,
and use it more economically. The bill does
not propose a new appropriation, but merely
to distribute tho appropriation already made
somewhat differently. The same disposition
has bee-i made in the law m regard to the ap-
propriation for the current fiscal year. It was
provided for at the last short session of Con-
gress. I apprehend that there can be no ques-
tion about the propriety of this bill, and I ask
for a vote upon it.
Mr. N1BLACK. I desire to say, for theben-
efit of gentlemen on this side of the House who
may not have heard the remarks of the gentle-
man from Ohio, that the bill makes no addi-
tional appropriation, but only provides an
