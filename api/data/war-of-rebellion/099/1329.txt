RALEIGH, March 5, 1865.

[General JOHNSTON:]

In a dispatch just received from General Hardee he says he received a dispatch form me saying Schofield was moving up west band of Cape Fear. I sent no such dispatch. On the contrary, on learning Colonel Childs had given such inforamtion, it was promptly contradicted by Colonel Anderson, and General Hardee corectly advised.

HEADQUARTERS CAVALRY DIVISION,Rockingam, March 5, 1865-5,30 p. m.

General BRAGG:

GENERAL: I have forwarded you dispatch to General Hardee. The rear of his column left place at 11 a. m. I will remain here to-night with one brigade cavalry. The enemy crossed at Cheraw yesterday morning and drove in my pictest at dayligh, two miles from the river, on the road to Fayetteville. From the columns of smoke the seen below, they appear to be marching toward Fayetteville. The Fifteenth Corps was at Society Hill day before yesterday, and my, impresion is that the Seventeenth and Fifteenth will cross there, and the Twentieth and Fourteenth at Cheraw. General Hardee is on the road to Ashgorough. Brigadier-General Robertson was cut off on the other side the Pedee with a cavalry brigade and will cross on the Wilmington and Manchester Railroad bridge, from which point he has been ordered to Fayeteville. If you can communicate with him is would be well to hurry him up. He has, I think, a battery of artillery, also. Sherman, I have no doubt, is making for FAyetteville.
