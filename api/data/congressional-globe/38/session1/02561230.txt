THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
March 22,
low-snfic-rcis: in the calamity that it vvil! bring upon us?
What icaseus can jou give to the nations of the earth to
justify it r 'i hey will he caim arid deliberate judges, m the
ca«<e; and to wii.xt cause oi on'* overt act can you name or
point on which to rest the pleaof justification} What right
has the North assailed ? What interest ot' the South has
been invaded? What justice ha? hern denied, and what
claim iouwh'd injustice and right has been withheld? Can
cither ofyouto-dd) name oncgovermnental act of wrong de-
liberately and purposely done bvthe Government of Wash-
ington or' which the South ha-> a right to complain? T chal-
lenge the answer. While, on the othei hand, let meshow the
facts (and believe me, gentlemen, I am not here the advocate
ot the Notth, but 1 am lieie the friend, tlie firm friend and
loverot the South aiidliei institutions, and for this reason f
speak thus plainly and faithfully, I or yours, mine, and every
othei man's mteitst, the words of truth and soberness) ot
which Ivvi.sh you to jud c,and T \v ill only Mate facts which
me clear and undeniable, and which now stand as iccords
authentic m the histoiy of our countij. When we of the
South demanded the slave tiade. oi Hie impoitation ot Af-
ricans iortho cultivation ol our lands, did they not ymld
the right hn twenty jeais? Whan we asked a three-tilths
representation in (Jongiest. for oui slaves was n uoigranted?
When vve a->ked and demanded the ictuin oi any tn^itive
lrom justice, or the lecovety of tlnwe peisoies owing labor
or allegiance, was it not meoipoiated m the Constitution,
and again ratified and siiengthpueit m the fugitive slave
law ot ls50 ? But do jou leply that in manv m-taiices thev
have violated tins compact, and have not "been iaiihlul to
then engagements? As individual and local communities
the} have done so, lint not In the sanction oi Govei nun nt,
loi that has ahvajs been tiue to southern intcic-fs.
"Again, gentlemen, look atanothei lact. When we have
asked that moie terntoiy should be added that we might
spicnd the institution ot slavery, have thev not welded to
oui demands m giving us Louisiana, Florida. and Texas,
outot which lout States have been carved, and ample tei-
litory fur tour more to he added in due time, if you, by tin*
unwise and impolitic act, do not d''*trov this hope, rind
perhaps by It iose all, and have jour last'slave wrenched
lrom you hy stem military rule, as South America and
Mexico were, oi b> the vindictive decree of ,i universal
emancipation, which may reasonably be expected to tol-
lOYV.
'• But again. gentlemen, what have we to gain by this
propped cli'ume ot oui n-i.ition to the c;<jnernl Govern
inent? U'e have nhv.ij s had the eonnol ol it, and can \ et.

If further ornv>ie ooiiclusive proof is required,
we have itovcr tin- si^nnturfs of WiHiani L. Vuii-
eoy, P. A. Rest, and A. Dudley Mann, in their
joint letter addressed to the London Times:
" Itwa«s from no fear that the slave would he liberated
that secession look place. The very party in power has
proposed to guaranty slavery forcvei jn the States, if the
South would but iemam in the Union. Mr. Lincoln'? mes-
sage proposes no freedom to the slave, but announces sub-
jection of the owner to the North. Even after the battle of
Bud ltun both branches of the Congress at Washington
parsed resolutions that the war is only waged to uphold
that (pro-slavery) Constitution and to'enfmee the laws,
(many ot them pro-slaverv,) und out of one bundled and
seventy-two vote* in the lower House they reecived all but
twos and m the Senate all but one vote."
I will read additional authority. Senator Ham-
mond, of South Carolina, in a speech made in that
State October 24, 1858, said:
"The lock of Gibraltar docs not stand so firm on its basis
as oui hlave system. In tins veiy quarter of a century our
slaves have doubled in minibus and each slave has moie
than doubled in value. The veiv noiio whoas a prune
laborer would have brought.•s'lOU in lfc>43. would now, with
thist> years upon lam. sell lor^bUU/'
Mr. A. ii. Stephens, ni a speech delivered by
him jn 1851), said:
*' 1 do not believe that sdavoty h:t^ MiMamed any injury
fiom those agitations*. On the contrary it had been greatly
Mrcnet.hened and lortiiied bv the action of the Govern-
ment.'1
And we all know the oft-quoted expression of
Mr. llhett, of South Carolina, in the convention
of that State:
"The secession of .South Carolina in- not the event of a
day. It is not anything pioduced bv Mi. Lincoln, or by the
non-execution of the fugitive slave law. It is a matter
which has been gathering head lor tvvrnt) vcais."
We must, therefore, look for the motives of the
insurrectionists elsewheic than in their feais for
the security of slavery; and, sir, I am greatfy
mistaken if, in the prosecution of this mquiiy, we
fdmll not discover a design looking beyond the
dissolution of the Union and the establishment
of an independent southern confederacy. Their
(iis.satisfacdon wentfuither timn hostility to the
Un ion; it consihted, in f<u t, in hostility to the fun-
damental pi me,iples of republican ^ovei n me lit. it
way a lovolt against popular institutions—a repu-
diation of democracy. The ultimate icsult con-
templated was and is ihe establishment 0f an oli-
K.uehy, if not a monarchy. Their piesent form
of political oignuizaiion isatenipoiaryexpedient
devised to covet up the fundamental purpose of the
eons|>HaloiH,and to he usud as the deceptive agency
by which they wili accomplish the destruction of
lIn* etptal rights and libei ties of the soul iiei n i>•■<>-
pie. This puipohc, at first faintly rfluulowed
forth, is beetunin^ every day more und mill more
appai ent. 11 is wondei ful tlui t 11 has not nth act-
ed moie <if tin- public attention. It seems to be
belter undeiytomi and better appieeiaied abroad
than at home, it luini^hes ihe explanation of the
sympathy and favor with u Inch foreign monarch-
ists n^aid the ^rent lebellioii. They rrce^iazo
the true design of il, and see in ils slice: ss not
only the destuicthm of the unity of the Ctcpublic,
buf that it will be a. N'-rious jf not fatal blow
against icpublicati institutioua, here and else-
where, now and forever.
PeihapH the pul)he nidilien-nce in this respect
may anxe from incredulity as to the reality of
such a pui pose, ft may not, iheieforc, be amiss
to advei t to some of the evidences indicating such
a design. I need hardly remind Senatois of the
at biliary provisions existing tn the fundamental
law of many of the southern States, such as the
qualifications ofmembeis of the Geuewil Assem-
bly of South Carolina, requiring that they should
own slaves und hind, and Hn; a ppoi tiomnen t of
ivpioKoiitauon upon the basis of property, as m
Viigmm, Nor is it neeessaiy to do more than
allude to the indisputable fact that free labor in j
the South is everywhere esteemed as degrading. !
Tin- ti aciiings of Mi. Calhoun against the jus ma- i
joris found a wide-spiead lodgment m the minds j
of southern statesmen. An anstoemtic sentiment, I
carefully and sedulously inculcated, had become I
eveiyvvliere pievuieut, (Specially m the Gulf j
States, pnoi to then ordinance of secession. j
I r< member well with what vdiemenee j\Ir. |
Preston, of South Carolina, one of the commis- |
sionots «ent by those States to the Virginia con- |!
vention in the spi mg of 1361, and oncofthe most
ehuptent men I ever heard, in an addiess to that ;■
body, forey'nadowt d the aristocratic designs of the ,;
revolutionists; and I lemember, too, with what
sadness and dismay I saw the manifest favor with •!
which the promulgation of his imperial utter- il
ances was received. Among them was the fol-
lowing:
tkin the free States the simple, isolated, exclusive, sole
political principle is a pure democracy of mere numbers,
save a scaieely discernible modification by a vague and
undefined form ot representation, in these States theie
can be no dephrture from this principle in its? extremestin-
tonsity.' The admission of the sh^hte^t advene element
is fotbidden by the whole genius of the people and their
institutions. It is as delicate In us sensitiveness as per-
sonal right in England, or slavery in Carolina; it is the
vitalizing piinciple, the breath of the life of northern so-
cialism. The almighty power of numbers is the basis of
all social tigieement in the northern States. A fearful
illmtrau'on of this is at thN moment exhibiting its results
tn the Govet nuicntundei which youaie consenting to live.
That Government was 'instituted and appointed' to pioteet
and secure equally tin; interest-* ot tliepart-<. By the agency
ot mere nnmbei-s one section has been restricted ami an-
other expanded in terntoiy ; one section has be<'n unduly
and oppressively taxed, rj.nd one section has been hroupht
to imminent peri!, and in this hour the peoply ot the North
are consulting whether they can subjugate the people of
the South by the right of numbers..
'"The government by the people' is equally the rule of
the South, but the modification of* the rule of number' is
so essential in the slave States that it cannot coexist with
the same principle m its unrestricted form. In the South
it is controlled, peihap^ made absolutely subject, by tiie
fact tli.it the lecoL'iution ol a <poeilie pioperty is osentiaJ
to the vitahzation of the social and political oigani&in*?. if,
then, you attempt to institute the rule of either loim into
the organism ot the other, you instantly destroy the sec-
tion you mv.ule. To proclaim to the Noith that numbers
shall not be absolute would be as offensive as to proclaim
the extinction of slavery in the South The element of
property would neutialize the entire political systematthe
North ; its exclusion would subveit the whole organism of
the South." #
He continued by saying:
Southern civilization cannot exist without slavery.
None but .in equal race can Liboi nt the South. Dostioy
involuntaiy laboi, and the Anglo-Saxon civilization must
be remitted to the latitudes from which it sprung.'5
This same convention appointed a committee
toieporttoan adjourned session what amend-
ments ought to be niade in the constitution of
Virginia. Tl** chairman of this committee was
Mr. Stuart, formei ly Secretary of the Interior.
The repoit made by him recommended veiy fun-
damental restrictions upon the right of suffrage,
took from the people the right of electing most of
the public ofKcers whom they had hitherto chosen,
and among other enunciations declared'.
" Governments are instituted for the protection of the
rights of pei-on and propetty; and any system mu-t be
radically deh eitve which does not give ample seeuntv to
both. The great interests of eveiy community may be
classed under the heads of laboi and capital, ami if is es-
sential to the well-beinc of society that the pioper equi-
librium should be (stabh'shed between thive nnpoitant
elements' The undue predominance ol either must event-
ually ptove de tti'.etive of the social sjstem. Capital be-
longs to the lew , i.ibor to the mnm . In those systems in

"This tendency to a conflict bet\v< en labor and capital
has already manifested it-elf in manv fotm^, compara-
tively harmless, it is true, but nevertheless cleaiJy indica-
tive ol a spirit of licentiousness which must, in the end,
ripen into agiaruuiu-,m. it may be see*, })l the f-yatan of

When our fleet was menacing Port Royal, Gov-
ernor Pickens, of South Caiohnrijiu his message
to the Legislatuie, made this recommendation:
" As far as the northern States arc concerned their Gov-
ernment lshopch^-iv gone, and if we fail, with all oiu
couseivritive element- to save us, then, indeed, there wii)
be no hope foi an independent and lice republic on tin?
continent, and the public mind will despominurly turn to
the stionjrer and moie fixed hums of the Old Woild
" In this pomt of view i most re-pconull) uigc that you
inciease the power and dignitv ot theState through all In-r
administrative ofines, and adhen* fiimly to all the con-
seivattve principles of our constitution."
So palpable were these manifestations of hos-
tility to republican government then becoming
that Governor Brown of Georgia, not then, I sup-
pose, fully initiated into the secret purposes of the
leaders of the rebellion, (if he be yot, judging from
his late message,) indignantly denounced them.
His language was that some of these men desired
to establish
'* A snong etnna! Government, probably, preferma, if
they d'd t'eai to ri^k an avnuni ot thefi HoiinuiciiU, a lim-
ited monarchy, similar to that of Gie;i.t Bntain. m other
hum oi Government that will accomplish the same thing
under a diffeient name."
