THE CONGRESSIONAL 'GLOBE.
February 22,
done to these parties and the transportation
interests involved be relieved, of an uncon-
scionable burden. . The railroads had made a
contract which you.straek down without a
hearing. No interests of commerce, no addi-
tional burden on the people in extra charges,
for transportation to pay interest) could be con-
sidered. It was a job I Oh, yes ; a job to
these virtuous men now piling a million extra
on this bill for their local interestsj-
In the case under consideration these bond-
holders never made a contract witli the Gov-
ernment. TbeGovernment is not an indotser
of their bonds ; it is not liable for a dollar of in-
terest on them. And I can see no reason why
a canal should differ in principle from a rail-
road. The only difference that guides these
excellent gentlemen is that this canal skirts
the State of Indiana, while in1 the ease I sup-
ported the railroad traverses the Territories
of the United States and my own State. And
I defy any gentleman who assailed the propo-
sition which I made, so fair in all its parts,
who assailed me almost with foul language, to
stand up here and upon principle say;if that
was a job that this is not a job also.
Sir, the lime comes early in the session and
soon after the debate of yesterday for me to
point the moral then made, and to point gen-
tlemen to the fact that these things which they
characterized as jobs they themselves advocate
and excuse and insist upon when it affects their
own interests.
Mr. SHELLABARGER. Mr. Speaker-
Mr. SARGENT. I do not refer to my friend
from Ohio.
Mr. SHELLABARGER. I desire to say
that the gentleman has made a good speech,
and I am glad that it is not against the propo-
sition before the House.
Mr. SARGENT. I want to show these
gentlemen that they cannot on any cdnBtitu-
tional principles about which they talk, or
upon any principle of right or justice they
have heretofore pretended to follow, deplete
the Treasury of $1,000,000 for this purpose.
You have determined by a majority vote of
this House, acting under what I believe to be
a scare unworthy of men in full possession of
their manhood to be governed by in their legis-
lative actions, that these railroad companies
shall not be allowed to go into the courts and
have their rights there determined ; you would
not consent that they should not be deprived
of them until the courts, should determine
what their rights were. You yourselves have
placed them at a disadvantage, and decide the
case against them. You have insisted that
they should not have such a measure of relief,
even in a slight degree, which yon now ask
for your own locality.
Now let those gentlemen who talk about
jobs, in light of these considerations, get up
here and justify the taking of $1,000,000 out
of the Treasury in order to pay bondhold-
ers, these bloated bondholders—for that is a
term gentlemen use—who hold this canal as
security for their debt. They contend that the
Government should take this' canal, with this
debt hanging over it, while according to their
own former declarations it is only just that
the commerce shmild pay off thjs debt. I ask
that they mete out the same justice to these
which they insisted should be exercised to-
ward us. But they will not do it. They will
push their scheme through and virtuously vote
against similar relief for any other locality or
interest.
Mr. NEGLEY. Permit me to ask the gen-
tleman if he knows anything of what he is
talking about?
Mr. SARGENT. I think I know fully all
about it. We will see if-we can get a record
of votes on this proposition.
Mr. STEVENSON. I hope this question
will not be complicated by differences among
gentlemen about what has occurred in refer-
ence to other matters. The doctrine and
opinions of the gentleman from California
seem to lead him in the direction of this meas-
ure of justice.
• Mr.SARGENT. Doesitleadyouagainstit?
Mr. STEVENSON. Not at all. I trust he
will not oppose it on account of any pique he
may shave against anybody else about some
action taken on some other propositions.
Under coercion, under the immense coercive
weight of the gentleman from Wisconsin, we
submit to a continued exaction of twenty-five
cents a ton. We do so because we cannot help
ourselves. I hope the House will agree to
this compromise.
The tolls levied on the commerce of the
Ohio river for passage through this canal are
onerous and unjust. Under their operation
enormous taxes have been collected, amount-
ing to more than $5,000,000. Here is an
official statement of sums collected:

The rates of toll are enormous, being fifty
cents per ton on the capacity of steamers with-
out regard to the actual freight, and on other
craft in proportion; so that the tax on the
passage of a single steamer ranges from two
hundred to one thousand dollars; and in
one instance a steamer with coal tows has
paid $1,763 additional expenses and charges,
making the total amount of expense of passage
$2,468 The United States owns this work.
The question is whether the Government will
continue to levy these monstrous taxes on com-
merce. If they be continued at the present
rate it will bleed the internal trade of the coun-
try at the rate of nearly half a million a year.
Unless some provision be now made for the
payment or assumption of the debt, this taxation
on commerce must continue. Justice Davis, of
the Supreme Court, has decided that we can
make no deduction of these exactions without
some such measure as is proposed.
Mr. HOLMAN. I believe, Mr. Speaker,
the question is now well understood. I ask
that the joint resolution on this subject, passed
in March, 1872, by the Legislature of Ken-
tucky, may be published in the Globe,
The SPEAKER. If there be no objection,
leave will be granted.
There was no objection.
The joint resolution is as follows :
" "Whereas all thestock in the Louisville and Port-
land canal belongs to the United States Government,
except five shares owned by the directors of the
Louisville and Portland Canal Company, and aaid
directors, under the authority of the legislation of
Kentucky and the United States, executed a mort-
gage to Isaac Caldwell and Dean Richmond to secure
bonds named in said mortgage, some of which are
out and unpaid, and said canal company may owe
other debts; and whereas it is right and proper that
the Government of theUnited States should assume
the control and management of said canal: There-
fore,
" Beit resolved by the General Assembly of Kentucky,
That the president and directors of the Louisville
and Portland Canal Company are hereby authorized
and directed to surrender the said canal, and all the
property connected therewith, to the Government
of the United States, upon the following terms-and
conditions: , .
"1. That the Government of the United States
shall not levy tolls on said canal, except such as
shall be necessary to keep the same in repair, pay
all necessary superintendence, custody, and ex-
penses, and make all necessary improvements.
" 2. That the city of Louisville shall have the
right to throw-bridges over the canal at-suoh points
as said city may deem proper: Provided always,
That said bridged shall be so located as not to inter-
fere with the use of the canal, and so constructed
as not to interfere with its navigation.
"3. That the title and possession of the United
States of said canal shall not interfere with the
right of the State to serve civil and criminal pro-
cesses, or with the State's general police power ure/
the territory covered by the said canal and its ap-
pendages.
"4. And further, that the city of Louisville shall
at all times have the right of drainage into said
canal: Provided, That the connections between the
drains and the canal shall be made upon the plan to
keep out mud and garbage.
"5. That the use of the water-power of the canal
shall be guaranteed forever to the aetual owners of
the property contiguous to said canal; its branches
and dams subject to such restrictions and regula-
tions as may be made by the Secretary of the
Department of the United States Government which
may have charge of the said canal.
"6. That the Government of the United States
shall, before such surrender, discharge all the
debts due by said canal company, and purchase
the stock ofsaid directors."
Mr. DODDS. I ask leave to have printed
in the Globe some remarks on this question.
There being no objection, leave was granted.
[See Appendix.]
Mr. HOLMAN. In the form in which this
amendment now stands, all the members of
the Committee on Commerce think it ought to
be adopted. I accept the modification to fix
twenty-five cents per ton as the rate of tolls;
and upon the amendment thus modified I call
the previous question.
Mr. PLATT, I desire to ask the gentleman
from Wisconsin [Mr. Sawyer] a question.
Mr. SAWYER. I will hear it. -
Mr. PLATT. I understand it is proposed
to compromise this matter by fixing the rate
of tolls at twenty-five cents per ton. Now,
the original proposition of the gentleman from
Indiana [Mr. Holman] proposed to take
$1,200,000 out of the Treasury to pay these
bonds. I want to understand whether this
compromise will take from the Treasury only
$600,000.
Mr. HOLMAN. Oh, no.
Mr. PLATT. I desire that gentlemen who
have voted down an appropriation of $50,000
for West Virginia, and are now loading down
this bill so . that it cannot possibly become a
law, shall understand whether this amendment
adds $1,200,000 or $600,000 to the aggregate.
Mr. BURCHARD. I wish to make a par-
liamentary inquiry.
Mr. SAWYER. I should like to answer
the question of the gentleman from Virginia,
[Mr. Platt.]
Mr. HOLMAN. I must insist on the call
for the previous question.
The previous question was seconded and the
main question ordered.
Mr. SAWYER. I desire to say that I have
fought this amendment in committee, but 
Mr. SARGENT. I object to debate.
The question being taken on agreeing to the
amendment of Mr. Holman as modified, there
were—ayes 94, noes 27,
Mr. SARGENT called for the yeas and
nays.
The yeas and nays were not ordered.
So the amendment was agreed to.
Mr. HOLMAN moved to reconsider the vote
by which the amendment was adopted; and
also moved tbat the motion to reconsider be
laid on the table.
The latter motion was agreed to.
