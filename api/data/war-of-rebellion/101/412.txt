LEWISBURG, January 4, 1865.

Lieutenant Colonel W. D. GREEN,

Little Rock:

Arrived here las evening at 9,30. Left steamer at Van's Bar. Yesterday noon put off fifty bales of hay and fifty-five barrels of pork. Have sent the Alamo down to bring them here, also to assist the Lotus if necessary. River falling. I do not think the enemy intends crossing to north side of River. They are under command of Colonels Newton and Brooks. They are gathering cattle and making preparations to move families south. I shall keep the River patrolled to Norristown to prevent their crossing, and trust to Geiger keeping of any force approaching from White River. I have sent person to remain with the rebels till they move to report what road they take, &amp;c. If 500 men with section of artillery from Little Rock move up on the south side of the River I think they could bag the whole of them. I can amuse them on the River and send scout to Perryville to prevent messengers going to them with information of the movement from the Rock. I do not think we can cross a force up here without their knowledge. I think this a good time a movement from the Rock, as they will be watching us here and at Norristown, also Thayer's command.

Roads good.

A. H. RYAN,

Colonel.
