General JOHNSTON:

Enemy have a battery on eastern base of Lost Mountain, and firing occasionally on our cavalry.

P. B. LEE.

General JOHNSTON:

Jackson's artillery are near Lost Mountain and southeast of it, and are firing rapidly.

P. B. LEE.

General JOHNSTON:

Another large body of enemy little farther to our left, on the road from Lost Mountain to Marietta, and near where General Hardee was on the road and moving toward Marietta. Enemy is forming line of battle perpendicular to our left, and are now in rear of our left and driving back our cavalry.

P. B. LEE.

General JOHNSTON:

Enemy is still moving in force toward our left in the direction of Marietta from Lost Mountain, at least one division strong.

General H:

From our center to our right everything remarkably quiet. No demonstrations; considerable fighting going on to our extreme right.

P. B. LEE.

General JOHNSTON:

The fighting was by our infantry and artillery, on or near the main road as well as could be located. It has subsided.

P. B. LEE.

General JOHNSTON:

Enemy passing, I think at least one brigade, to our extreme left. Very active firing of artillery immediately in front of us.

G. A. HENRY.

General JOHNSTON:

Very active firing east of railroad; enemy seem to be preparing for an advance; enemy making demonstrations on our extreme left.

G. A. HENRY.

General MACKALL:

There has been very heavy firing of artillery and infantry east and west of Big Shanty. My opinion is it is a feint of enemy to cover some movement on our extreme left. I have apprised General Hood of the movements.

G. A. HENRY.

General H.:

The line that was advancing [on] General Hardee have halted and are fortifying.

G. A. HENRY.

General JOHNSTON:

Quite a column moving to our extreme left; I think at least a division. I will inform you very soon.

G. A. HENRY.
