General Banks has made a requisition on the Quartermaster's Department for 600 wagons and teams. The wagons and harness will be sent from Philadelphia. Send all the teams you can spare, and General Allen will replace them as soon as possible.

WAR DEPARTMENT,

Washington, September 29, 1863-11 a.m.

Major-General GRANT,

Vicksburg, Miss.:

The enemy seems to have concentrated upon General Rosecrans all his available forces from every direction. To meet him it is necessary that all the forces that can be spared in your department be sent to General Rosecrans' assistance. He wishes them sent by Tuscumbia, Decatur, and Athens. As this requires the opening and running of the Memphis and Charleston Railroad east of Corinth, an able commander, like Sherman or McPherson, should be selected. As soon as your health will permit, I think you should go to Memphis and take the direction of this movement. Should Bragg move by Rome into Northern Alabama to turn Rosecrans' right, your forces on that line may require all your assistance. Longstreet's corps, I believe, is the only one withdrawn from Lee's army, but almost everything has been taken from other places.
