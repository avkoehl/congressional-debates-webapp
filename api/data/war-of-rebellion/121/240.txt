to his own Government, a deserter, and desertion from an enemy is always to be encouraged.

Second. The President's proclamation encourages rebel soldiers to leave their ranks and resume their allegiance to the United States. To compel prisoners of war who are willing to abandon the rebel cause and take the oath of allegiance to return to the rebel ranks would not only be violation of the usages of war, but an abandonment of the policy of the President's proclamation.

Third. The enemy has no claim whatever upon us to return such of his men as voluntarily choose to remain with us.

Fourth. No rebel prisoner has during this war been returned to the enemy against his will. To force such to return now would expose them to punishment by their own authorities for having offered to desert their cause.

Fifth. Most of the prisoners who have expressed an unwillingness to be exchanged are from Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas, and Louisiana, States now in or about to return to the Union. To force back into the rebel such of their citizens as wish to be loyal would be unjust to these States as well as to the individuals themselves. I think that on a full consideration of this matter General Grant would be disposed to change his recommendation. It is much cheaper to feed an enemy in prison than to fight him in the field.

Very respectfully,

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
