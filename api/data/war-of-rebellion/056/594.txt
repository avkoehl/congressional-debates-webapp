Rappahannock, a part of his infantry might be employed greatly to the interest of the service in East Tennessee at this time. The cavalry I have will not, I am afraid, accomplish much unless well suported by infantry. I need not bring to your notice the importance of driving the enemy from East Tennessee. You know as well as I do, not only the importance to us of that country from its geographical position, but from the supplies of subsistence it can furnish the Government.

Whilst I do not pretend to know what number of troops General Lee can spare, or if he can with safety spare any, for this service, I think it proper to bring the matter again to your notice, that you may take such action on it as you may think proper.

With great respect, your obedient servant,

SAM. JONES,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF TENNESSEE,Missionary Ridge, October 26, 1863.

Major General S. D. LEE,

Commanding Cavalry:

GENERAL: The general commanding instructs me to say that he desires you to watch the enemy in North Alabama, and retard his movements as much as possible by skirmishing and destroying roads ahead of him.

Should you be compelled to fall back, you will do so south, so as to be on the flank and rear of the enemy, harassing him as much as possible, preserving as far as practicable your communications with your own department and these headquarters.

The general desires you will keep him constantly advised of your progress, strength, and the movements of the enemy.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEORGE WM. BRENT,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF TENNESSEE,Missionary Ridge, October 26, 1863.

Major General JOSEPH WHEELER,

Commanding Cavalry:

GENERAL: I send you a duplicate copy of instructions sent to you on the 24th instant. I am instructed by the general commanding to modify them as follows: You will bring with you to the right of this army the command of Brigadier-General Roddey, leaving General Lee to watch the enemy in North Alabama.

Be good enough to forward the inclosed communication to General Lee after sealing it. I leave it open for your information.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEORGE WM. BRENT,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
