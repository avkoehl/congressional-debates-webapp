HDQRS. CHIEF OF CAVALRY, DEPT. OF THE CUMBERLAND,Hardshell Church, October 5, 1864-3 p. m.

General SHERMAN:

GENERAL: I have scouted all the roads in my front, right and left. The Allatoona road appeared to be open; I sent the Fourth U. S. [Cavalry] to go as far as possible toward Allatoona. Captain McIntyre reports having corssed the creek beyond (I think Kemp's Mill), drove pickets back to their camp, fresh earth breast-works, and felled trees; appearance of large camps in the direction of Lost Mountain, and the tracks of wagons and footmen, showing that a large force passed this morning toward Allatoona. I find parties of the enemy occupying our old line of works and on every road.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. L. ELLIOTT,

Brigadier-General, &amp;c.

I will cover the Dallas road toward Pine Hill., unless othewise ordered.

W. L. ELLIOTT,

Brigadier-General.

Have just rececived ordered for General Garrard to go to Allatoona, and have him ready, but await for you to get report; he will have to pass to the right of Pine Hill, according to the information we get from my present front.

W. L. ELLIOTT,

Brigadier-General, &c.,

OCTOBER 5, 1864.

General ELLIOTT:

Send General Garrard immediately to Allatoona, by the right, to ascertain the state of affairs there. Answer.

General ELLIOTT:

I have heard from Allatoona. All right. Corse is there, but wounded. You need not send all of Garrard's cavalry, but send a squadron. Let them make a circuit and they will find nothing there.

DEAR GENERAL: I have been up on Kenesaw all day watching the attack. Since it ceased we have a signal O. K. Corse wounded. Our infantry can now present a strong front, and if fight we must, so be it. I want to establish communication with Allatoona, and have
