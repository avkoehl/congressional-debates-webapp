General MORGAN,

A scout just in reports that Mosby with one battalion crossed the Blue Ridge to Shenandoah Valley April 8, to prey upon trains. An affair between another portion of Mosby's force and detachment of Eight Illinois Cavalry occurred April 10 near Burke's Station. Five of Mosby's men killed. Our loss two slightly wounded.

Colonel THOMPSON,Commanding, Darnestown, Md.:

I have information that a company of Mosby's command left Upperville on Saturday last, intending to cross into Maryland. I cannot learn where they intend to cross. Have your command informed, and let them he vigilant. It is likely they will cross the river in small parties.

C. C. AUGUR,

Major-General .

FARIFAX COURT-HOUSE, April 11, 1865-9 a. m.

Major-General AUGUR,

Commanding, &amp;c.:

GENERAL: The captured prisoners state that they do not belong to Chapman's command, but were sent by Mosby to capture the quartermaster's animals at Burke's Station, and that Chapman himself is expected in this vicinity every day. From the conflicting accounts that have reached me I am led to believe that Mosby's entire command consists of two battalions of four companies each, and two additional companies newly organized, ten companies in all, numbering between 800 and 1,000 men. That four companies under Mosby himself crossed the Blue Ridge on Saturday to plunder weak-guarded trains south of Winchester. One company sent to Maryland to plunder banks; one company sent to Maryland to plunder banks; one company sent to steal horses from my lines, besides the battalion from the Northern Neck.

W. GAMBLE,

Colonel, Commanding Brigade.

Brevet Brigadier-General GAMBLE,Fairfax Court-House:

You report one company of Mosby's having crossed into Maryland to rob banks. Where did they cross? When and in what force? Answer.

Respectfully,

J. H. TAYLOR,

Chief of Staff and Assistant Adjutant-General.
