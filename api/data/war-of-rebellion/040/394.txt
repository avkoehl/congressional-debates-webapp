At 3.30 p.m., as near as I can get at it, Sedgwick's advance was about 3 1/2 miles distant from Fredericksburg,near Guest's house -see photographic map.

MAY 3, 1863-5.30 p.m.

Major-General HOOKER:

The signal telescope discovers about several thousand troops due west from this point, about 8 miles. Counts seven colors - rebel battle-flags. This would locate them at 5 p.m. near Tabernacle Church by the photograph map. Is not this a column marching to meet Sedgwick and away from your front? Will get further information it I can.

General HOOKER:

Sedgwick's column reported at 4.15 p.m. advanced three-quarters of a mile beyond Guest's house. Sedgwick tells my staff officer he is getting along very well. He is moving in two columns on either side of the Plank road, a line of a half mile deployed. Warren thinks the enemy will make a stand half a mile beyond their then position.
