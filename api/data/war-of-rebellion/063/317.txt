P. S.-I am unable to suggest the number of boats or their draught; they should, however, be of sufficient strength to vindicate our possession of the river.

Honorable B. F. FLANDERS,

Agent Treasury Department, New Orleans:

SIR: I have the honor to acknowledge receipt of your letter, delieved to me yesterday by Mr. Hutchins, dated New Orleans, April 22, and to express my high gratification at the desire it manifests to place the commerce of he department upon some general basis in which we can all unite. I am reluctant to undertake to designate any individuals as agents or managers of the general trade. There are various reasons against such a course, but that which weighs most strongly against me is that I am disinclined to it. I believe our affairs are now in such condition that the additional trade regulations of the 22th of January can be officially promulgated, and hade issued orders to the effect, intending that they shall take effect from this date. For that purpose they will be posted here at once. The quartermaster will be instructed to assist in its execution as far as consistent with the public service on the line of the Red River, and to adapt his business to this code as far as it is possible.

I have the honor to be, with much respect, your obedient servant,

N. P. BANKS,

Major-General, Commanding.

With much respect, your obedient servant,
