THE CONGBESSIONAL GLOBE.
February 21,
by the Committee on Public Buildings and
Grounds, to whom was referred a resolution
instructing the committee to consider the pro-
priety of providing that whatever new library
may be built should be called the Washington
Library Building and be a fitting tribute to the
Father of his Country, to report it back and to
say that the subject is not before the Commit-
tee on Public Buildings and Grounds and
probably has been incidentally or otherwise
considered by the Committee on the Library ;
and we therefore ask to have the resolution
referred to the Committee on the Library.
The YICB PRESIDENT. It will be so
referred.
Mr. HARLAN, from the Committee on
Indian Affairs, to whom was referred the bill
(H. R. No. 3953) relative to private contracts
or agreements made with Indians, reported it
without amendment.
Mr. PRATT, from the Committee on Claims,
to whom was referred the bill (H. R. No.
3941) for the relief of Joseph B. Rothchild, of
Findlay, Ohio, submitted an adverse report
thereon, which was ordered to be printed ; and
the' bill was postponed indefinitely.
Mr. PRATT. The Committee on Pensions,
to whom was referred the bill (S. No. 1612)
for the relief of Theodore S. Comparet, have
directed me to report it back and to state that
the committee discover on an examination of
the bill that they have no jurisdiction over the
subject-matter. It was referred to that com-
mittee upon the motion of my colleague, and
X suggest to him that it should go either to the
Committee on Claims or to the Committee on
Military Affairs. The Committee on Pensions
has no jurisdiction over the subject-matter.
Itshould go either to the Committee on Mili-
tary "Affairs or the Committee on Claims, and
I report it back with a recommendation that
it be referred to one of those committees.
Mr. MORTON. Then I ask that it be
referred to the Committee on Military Affairs.

SOLDIERS7 BOUNTY LANDS.
Mr. STEWART submitted the following
resolution; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on Printing :
Revolved, That five thousand extra copies of the
report of the Committee on Public Lands on House
bill No. 1605 be printed for the use of the Senate.
PUBLICATION OF DEBATES.
Mr. ANTHONY. I do not wish to inter-
rupt the order of business ; but there is a mat-
ter in mv charge in which every Senator is
interested; and I wish I could have unanimous
consent to bring up the joint resolution for
printing the debates of Congress after the 4th
of March. Senators are aware that after the
4th of March there is no law for printing the
debates. It is so near that time now that if
the contract is to be given into other hands,
as the resolution proposes, there is very little
time for the new contractor to get ready.
Mr. SAWYER. I do not wish to antag-
onize the motion of the Senator from Rhode
Island; but I wish he would allow me to have
the resolution I offered yesterday morning
considered at this time.
Mr. ANTHONY. I have no objection to
that
Mr, FERRY, of Connecticut. I shall feel
it my duty to oppose the resolution of the
Senator from South Carolina.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The pending
question is on the motion of the Senator from
Rhode Island that the Senate proceed to the
consideration of what is known as the print-
ing joint resolution from the House of Repre-
sentatives, postponing the Calendar for that
purpose.
The question being put, there were on a
divisionâ€”ayes 23, noes 21.
Mr. BLAIR called for the yeas and nays;
and they were ordered.
Mr. EDMUNDS. I wish to say one word,
if it is not out of order. I am very much op-
posed to doing anything except go on with
the unobjected cases on the Calendar, in order
that people who have a clear right to relief
may have it; but from what the Senator from
Rhode Island has said as to the importance
of having this matter settled as it is so near
the 4th of March, in order that if new people
are to have this work they may have time to
get ready and if the old people are to have
it that they may know it and be able to con-
tinue their business, I am inclined to think
this is an exception, and we ought to take
it up and dispose of it, if it does not take too
long.
Mr. HOWE. I want to add one word to
what the Senator from Vermont has said,
though I do not think it would carry any addi-
tional weight. The Senator from Rhode Island,
the chairman of the committee, has already
informed so many as listened to him that in a
very few days you will have no provision made
for priming the Globe, and if that time should
arrive when the Globe should cease to be
issued,_ it would be an unfortunate day for
humanity, everybody will concede. I suppose,
however, the Globe will be printed at some
rate or at some cost, whether or no, even if
this bill should fail; but we all know that if
no other provision is made it will be printed at
a very great cost and many believe at a very
unnecessary cost after the 3d of March. I
think if Senators care anything about either
having the Globe printed or about the terms
on which it is to be printed, they would at least
consider the bill which has been reported from
the Committee on Printing and consider it
very early. I hope they will agree to tak<;
it up.
