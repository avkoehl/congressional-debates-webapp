of settling, as can the Howe bridge, the difficulty may be obviated to a great degree by building it with a slight camber. A the Keysville terminus there are ten miles of the line graded and ready to receive the track, of which three miles and one-quarter have already been laid with 50-pound rail. The masonry and work on the line generally seem to have been well executed, although one box culvert laid dry about a mile from Keysville has given and a breach has been made in the embankment.

In annexing prices to the foregoing quantities I have endeavored not to underestimate the cost of the work. The great uncertainty existing in our midst about the cost of provisions and all the implements necessary for executing work on railroads tend greatly to increase the prices of various items of railroad construction, and that, too, when ordinary slave laborers may he had for little more than half the prices which they formerly commanded.

The estimate as made above is on the line as now located. I am quite satisfied that changes can be made in the alignment of the road which will greatly reduce its cost. I am satisfied of this not only from my own observations but from the fact that where the work has already been constructed the line has been adjusted more carefully to the ground than elsewhere, as if the engineer in charge on more careful examination, had been able to effect important economical changes. It may not transcend the limits of my instructions and my duty to report that the railroad in connection with which this is to run, viz, the Roanoke Valley Railroad, is in very bad condition, and that repairs on it should commence quite as soon as the construction of this work. I would also offer for your consideration the fact that the rails have been laid on the two roads with different gauges.

Very respectfully,

A. M. DUPUY.
