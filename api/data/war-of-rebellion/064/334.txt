Off Bayou Sara, La., June 13, 1864.

General EMORY,

Commanding U. S. Forces, Morganza, La.:

GENERAL: From a reliable source I learn that Colonel Scott, commanding rebel forces near here, was in Bayou Sara last night; also the officer recently ordered to command the rebel army in Mississippi. They left this morning with a force for Tunica. I could not learn how great the force was. There is a move of some kind determined upon, for no one has been permitted to visit the place for the past four-days. Should I learn anything more definite, will inform you.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

CHARLES A. WRIGHT,

Commanding.
