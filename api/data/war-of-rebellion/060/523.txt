HEADQUARTERS SUB- DISTRICT OF BEAUFORT, N. C.,February 5, 1864- 11 a. m.

Major R. S. DAVIS,

Assistant Adjutant- General:

MAJOR: I have been attacked in force. Communications with New Berne severed. My loss is light. I am strong in my position at Morehead, Beaufort, ad Fort Macon. The Spaulding has arrived. Am re- enforced by the Twenty- first Connecticut. I will detain the Spalding for the result of my intended movement. I march at once to attack the enemy where I can find him. My command consists of the Ninth Vermont, Twenty- first Connecticut, and 60 cavalry, detachments of Second Massachusetts Heavy Artillery armed as infantry. Had a dispatch from General Palmer per steamer; he is all right. I will hold my present position, and think I can retake my old line and hod it. Will try and open communication with General Palmer by rail. Be assured that all that can be done will be done. Have no field artillery; the enemy has six pieces; will put 24 pounder howitzer on railroad car. I send this by the New Berne. One hundred and fifty- eighth New York at New Berne.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
