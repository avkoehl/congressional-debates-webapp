1856.
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
upon the walls of Mexico, but undoubtedly by
the direction of General Quitman at the time; and
therein there is no controversy between the par-
ties in respect to the exactness of the transaction
as it occurred, in my judgment; but, if there are
any points of controversy between these or other
parties, claimants to this honor, it is preemi-
nently proper that the matter should undergo the
proposed examination bythe Committee on Mil-
itary Affairs.
It is proper that I should add further, that if
there be any implied or inferential injustice done
to General Quitman in the report of Colonel
Roberts, by the omission of the mention of his
name in these transactions, it is, in my judgment,
altogether unintentional and accidental on his
part; for I say what I know when I declare that
no man in this country entertains for the personal
and public charactcr of General Quitman as a
citizen, as a general, and as a hero, higher esteem
than Colonel Roberts himself. His claim to the
honor of having, by his own hand, first raised the
national flag upon the palace walls of Mexico,
rests mainly upon the testimony of General Quit-
man himself.
The motion to refer the resolution to the Com-
mittee on Military Affairs was agreed to.
ADJOURNMENT OVER.

Ordered, That when the Senate adjourns to-day, it be to
