CAMP near BIRDSONG FERRY, July 3, 1863.

Lieutenant-General PEMBERTON:

Your dispatches of June 28 were destroyed by messenger. He states that General Smith's troops were driven back to Monroe. This statement and his account of your condition make me think it necessary to create a diversion, and thus enable you to cut your way out, if the time has come for you to do this. Of that time I cannot judge; you must, as it depends upon your condition. I hope to attack the enemy in your front about the 7th, and your co-operation will be necessary. The manner and the proper point for you to bring the garrison out must be determined by you from your superior knowledge of the ground and distribution of the enemy's forces. Our firing will show you where we are engaged. If Vicksburg cannot be saved, the garrison must.

The bacon and salt pork had been held in reserve for some days (mule meat issued in lieu thereof), to be used in the event of a forward movement. The rice, peas, and sugar were taken return without allowance for wastage, and the statement is probably too great.

HEADQUARTERS ADAMS' REGIMENT,Two miles east of Edwards, July 4, 1863-6 p. m.

Major-General BRECKINRIDGE, Bolton:

GENERAL: I was directed by Brigadier-General Jackson, commanding cavalry DIVISION, to move my command to this point, and, as soon as practicable, put myself in communication with the general commanding infantry DIVISION in my rear. Having just been informed that your headquarters are at Bolton, I embrace the earliest moment to apprise you of my arrival here at 1 p. m. to-day, and I am picketing the approaches from the direction of Big Black, and should be pleased to received any orders or instructions you may give.

From an intelligent and reliable scout I sent over to examine the enemy's line from Warrenton to Bovina, and who returned this afternoon, I learn that the enemy has sent a re-enforcement of 5,000 to Baldwin's Ferry, and that he continues his strongest force from Bovina to Snyder's, or on our right. From Warrenton to Baldwin's he reports his line comparatively weak. From conversation with citizens within the enemy's lines, he ascertained that the Yankee army is suffering greatly from disease, and is quite discouraged by their heavy losses from this cause and in their unsuccessful assaults.
