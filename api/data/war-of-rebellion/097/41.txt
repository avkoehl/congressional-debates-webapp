some of these vagons in the ranks; the result was a stampede of them by every outlet. I have ordered the same remedy at Norfolk, approved by General Grant, but the provost-marshal-general may not understand it and think I am interfering with his prerogatives, or Governor Peirpoint may interpose to appease the population. I do not propose to draft outside of infested localities, such as Norfolk, Portmouth, and Hampton.

Major-General.

CITY POINT, VA., March 19, 1865.

Major-General ORD:

General Sheridan has brought with him some 2,000 or 3,000 negroes. I have directed him to send them to the provost-marshal at Fort Monroe. The chief quartermaster (General Ingalls) will give you directions for the distribution and employment of the able-bodied men. The balance may direct to be sent to such settlement as you may think can best employ them.

Brigadier-General RAWLINS,

Chief of Staff, City Point:

I have the honor to report the safe return of my cavalry division to camp. When I receive a report from it I will telegraph results. A prisoner reports that Pickett's division returned to Richmond yesterday afternoon and encamped below Richmond.

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE JAMES,March 19, 1865-12 m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT,

City Point:

Summer is at Fort Monroe. Has orders from Sheridan to send his transports back from Norfolk as soon as possible. I think I can make him useful with other cavalry in a raid to Winton from Suffolk, and thence to Halifax or Weldon, if there is a crossing at Winton; or I can send pontoons. Shall I try it?

E. O. C. ORD,

Major-General.

CITY POINT, VA., March 19, 1865-2 p. m.

Major-General ORD:

I think it will be advisable to start Summer from Suffolk to go to Weldon when Sheridan starts from our left flank. It will be well to leave him in Norfolk, Portsmount, or Newport News until time to start. About next Saturday will be the time for him to leave Suffolk.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
