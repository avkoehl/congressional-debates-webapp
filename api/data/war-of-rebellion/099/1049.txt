Captain R. W. B. ELLIOTT,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

CAPTAIN: The enemy advanced a force about three miles up this road yesterday, which we checked and held back all day. From information received it appears that this force was sent to protect their flank on this side while their [main] body went into the swamp opposite Mrs. McTier's with pontoons to try and cross the river. They bogged down and were compelled to give it up and retire. My scouts report that they have all gone back to Pocotaligo. Their force was reported to be 7,000 infantry and 250 cavalry.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

C. J. COLCOCK,

Colonel, Commanding.

I am now reporting to General Wheeler, but will keep General McLaws posted as to the enemy's movements in his front. I understand the general ordered Lowry's company to report to me a week since. They have not done so.
