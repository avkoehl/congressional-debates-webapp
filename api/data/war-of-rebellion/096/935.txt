Commanding District of Eastern Shore, Salisbury, Md.:

The steamer Washington Irving will leave here to-morrow morning with detachment of infantry, and should arrive at Centerville on Monday very early. Try and be there to take command of the troops. Let the detachment of cavalry follow, if you think necessary. Perhaps the infantry will be sufficient.

Washington City, March 12, 1865.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

General Hartsuff is ordered to report to you immediately. What credit do you give Bragg's report that he had captured, 1,500 prisoners?

Secretary of War.

CITY POINT, VA., March 12, 1865-8.30 p.m.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

The scouts who brought General Sheridan's dispatch represent having found forage and provisions in great abundance. He also found plenty of horses to remount his men when their horses failed. They say the command is better mounted now than when they left. I start supplies and forage for Sheridan to-night. I have also sent for the command that is now on the Potomac to run up to White House, and to remain there until they meet Sheridan.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
