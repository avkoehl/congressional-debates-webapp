Went in the fight yesterday with an aggregate of 5,600. I have not over 3,000 effective men, including Imboden's cavalry, 800. I don't know where General Elzey is; think he has gone toward Charlottesville. Enemy occupied Staunton this morning Crook will from junction to-night or to-morrow with Hunter.
