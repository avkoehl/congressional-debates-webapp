HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE TENNESSEE,Waterloo, Ala., October 30, 1863.

Major-General GRANT,

Chattanooga:

The Tennessee is impassable, except by ferrying. Anticipating this, I ordered a ferry-boat before I left Corinth, and I am officially informed that one was ordered out from Paducah on the 24th instant, but it has not yet come. There is plenty of water in the Tennessee. Two gunboats have come up, and one has returned to see what causes delay to the others. I have but one gunboat and one coal barge to pass my troops, and, heavy rains having set in, our progress is slow. We work day and night. One division is forward at Florence, another is crossing, and I will do all that man can to hasten forward. I have received your dispatch by way of Cairo and through General Crook.

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE TENNESSEE,Eastport, Miss., October 30, 1863.

Major-General GRANT,

Chattanooga:

I have your dispatch of the 24th, sent through General Crook. I had two divisions at Tuscumbia driving out all the cavalry, and, finding Muscle Shoals impracticable, I had to fall back to Eastport and Chickasaw, where I had crossed one division, which is now at Florence. Another is nearly over and will go forward at once, and I will start with these two divisions for Athens, the effect of which will be to make the enemy believe all my army is there. I have been working in foul weather; had one gunboat and a coal barge decked over, which, with the muddy, slippery banks, made very slow and awkward work, but this moment have arrived three transports, one small ferry-boat, and two more gunboats, so that our progress will be better. I think I can have all the Fifteenth Army Corps over tomorrow. I can only carry ten days' rations, and will draw liberally of meats and corn of the country. The country is full of cavalry and guerrillas. We have had numerous skirmishes, but thus far we have the advantage.

Major-General.

IUKA, MISS., October 30, 1863-2.15 p. m.

Major-General SHERMAN,

Chickasaw:

GENERAL: The rebels came close up to our pickets, apparently following the wagon train of engineer regiment, and then went back. They have torn up the railroad ties and set fire to them in several places 5 miles east of us, and the cavalry officer feels satisfied that they burned the railroad bridge over Bear Creek, though he did not get near enough to see that himself.
