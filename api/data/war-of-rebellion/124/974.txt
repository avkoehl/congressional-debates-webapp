Colonel ANSON STAGER,

General Supt. Military Telegraph, Cleveland, Ohio:

COLONEL: In compliance with your order and with General Orders, Numbers 13, I respectfully submit the following report:

My commission as assistant quartermaster was accepted July 31, 1862, when I was ordered to "report to the general superintendent of military telegraph lines for duty," and received orders to "proceed at once to Saint Louis and reorganize the military telegraph in the Department of the Mississippi." Having been connected with the military telegraph from its adoption, a sojourn of six weeks in that department enabled me to learn the evils the management had fallen into, and how best to overcome them at the least expense to the Government. A lack of system was the may trouble. The plan adopted was designed to lessen the expense, to facilities operations, systematize accounts, and make the telegraph of the greatest possible service for military operations. In this I believe I was successful. The system adopted continues in operation as far as is practicable at the present time. On the completion of the reorganization a division of the department was recommended, and on its adoption I was ordered to assume control of telegraph lines in the Department of Western Vir
