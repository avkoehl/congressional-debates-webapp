THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
January 29,
At present, we have nothing to do but to com-
mit the petition The subject-matter of it does '
not paiticularly or exclusively refer itself to any
one of our standing committi es, but as the main
application is for a giant of land, and as similar
petitions heretofoie fiom Europeans, exiled for
political opinions, have been lefeired to the Com
mittee on Public Lands, I shall move a similar
refeiencc in this case, and that the petition be
printed in French and English          *
Mi CLAY, of Alabama, suggested that theie
was one pait of the petition which refeired itself
to another committee than that on the public
lands, and that was the part praying for the rights
of citizenship He would suggest, therefore, that
that pan of the petition be íeferred to the Com
mittee on the Judiciary
Mr BENTON accepted the modification sug-
gested by Mi C , and the first pait of the peti
tion, asking for a grant of land, was leferred to
the Committee on Public Lands , while the part
asking for the lights of citizenship was refeired
to the Committee on the Judicial y

REPORTS FROM A COMMITTEE.
Mr CAMBRELENG, from the committee of
"Ways and Means, lepoited a bill making appi o
priations foi pieventmg and suppressing Indian
hostilities for the year 183!)
Also, with an amendment, Senate bill supple
nicntary to the act establishing the Mint of the
United States
Also, a bill to lepeal the pioviso of the serond
section of an act appioved the 3d of Maich, 1837,
winch authorizes the Secietary of the Tieasury
to compromise the claim of the United States
against certain banks [It relates, to the Alleghany
Bank of Pennsylvania ]
The bill, on Mr C 'amotion, was ordeied to be
engrossed for a third leading to-moriow
CHEROKEE  QUESTION
Mi CAMBRELENG stated that, in the report
he submitted a few days ago on the state of the
finances, thete was contained a document fuin
ished by the Indian depai tment, containing astate-
ment which was coitect, but theie was a note
appended to it which was incorrect, and did injus-
tice to two members of the House, [Messrs Ever
ett and Bfu,,] and he was instructed by the
Committee of Ways and Means to move that that
part of the report be corrected, by striking there-
fiom the passage referred to
Mr MERCER moved to lay the motion on the
table, but subsequently withdiew It
Mr EVERETT explained his coarse on the
Cherokee question, to show that the note referred
to had done him two fold injustice, though he
was not very solicitous about it
Mi BIDDLE moved to commit the motion, so
that the report might be amended m other partic-
ulars, especially m íefeience to that part of it
which íeviewed the pension system, and went on
to reply to the argument of the report on this and
other subjects
Mi CAMBRELENG made a brief explana-
tion in reply
Mr PICKENS expressed his giatification that
the gentleman from Pennsylvania had come out
thus early in opposition to the principles of this
íepoit—a document to which Mr P gave his
most coidial and hearty support He rejoiced
that the Committee of Ways and Means had
thrown out such a document, and would to God
that an issue could be made upon it befoie the
people of this country, and he took that occasion
to say, that let any party act upon the pnnciples
of this íeport, and they may always rely upon
his open and unqualified support, no matter
where they came fiom, whether fiom the North,
the South, or the middle section of this country
Itisarepoit congenial to the spirit and genius
of our institutions, and puiely republican in all
its sentiments and piopositions, and he desired
to see the test vote upon the motion of the gen-
tleman fiom Pennsylvania, and hoped that vote
would be understood as a vote which was to
range paities upon the questions touched upon
m that report
The gentleman from Pennsylvania had con-
demned the leference to the tanfTm the íeport
In this, Mr P thought the committee had acted
wisely, foi was there a gentleman upon tnat Moot,
was there a tyio in politics, who did not know
that, at this very moment, parties were otgamz-
mg in this country with a view to meet the crisis
which would come on in 1842, when the compio-
mise act would expne' They all knew it, and
the committee acteei honestly and judiciously m
meeting the question in advance Why, the
measures of this very Congress, remote as they
would seem to be, will have an important bearing
on it Exhaust yourTreasuiy, vote away all the
public money upon profligate schemes of appio
piiation, and you will be compelled eithei to issue
Tieasury notes oi to borrow money And what
must inevitably follow' You must inciease yoiu
taxes on impoits, you must raise the tanft The
gentleman from Pennsylvania has attacked the
principles of the report upon these points, he has;
indicated his course, he has even quoted the title
to the fiist act passed under the Tedeial Consti-
tution, to prove that pi otection to manufactures
was coeval with our Government, &c , but yet,
foisoothjthe gentleman protests against his com-
mitting himself upon this poirt He may quote
the titles to ail your first acts, to pro^e the con-
stitutionality of your tanffs, but such quotations
would fail to convince him. (Mi P ) Thty would
fail to show that they weie congenial with the
first pi inciples of the Constitution Yet he would
not discuss these points at present, he would only
say that he should lejoice to shiver a lance with
the gentleman, on these subjects, at the piopei
time, and he was proud to say that he should
, have to meet m this conflict the shield of even a
Kniqht Tcmjilm
The pnnciples of this íeport (added Mr P )
aie the pnnciples of refoim  and   retrenchment,
j which seem to be the populai  doctnnes of the
I day     Now he wanted to see w ho are the gentle-
, men prenaied to do then lip sei vice to the goddess
of refoim, and to bow down  and worship, in
then hearts, profligacy and recklessness of ex-
penditure     Vote appropnations, as you  have
done heretofoie, with an utter disregaid to the
condition of the Treasury, and you will be com-
pelled to issue Treasuiy notes oi boiiow money.
He repeated, in conclusion, that he desired to see
arties ranged under the principles of that report
t was a noble document, and the party which
took its stand upon it would risk much atfiist,
but would triumph m the end Wt weie now
about to take a new latitude and departure, and
