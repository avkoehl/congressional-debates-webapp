old camp. Our proposed entrenched line ought to strike Hatcher's Run where the banks are the highest, on the north side. This is not the case at Armstrong's Mills, and unless we occupy the south bank the enemy will be able to enfilade all of General Smuth's present line and freely observe the location and strength of our forces in that vicinity. This is not the case at the crossing of the Vaughan road, the left bank being the higher.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
