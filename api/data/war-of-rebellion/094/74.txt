CAPTAIN: I have the honor to inform you that the quartermaster's department is engaged to-day in laying a pontoon bridge across the Cumberland, from near the end of Church street to the opposite bank of the river, for the purpose of accommodating the cavalry trains and for other purposes. It will be a double-track bridge, and the regulation will be for trains coming this way to use one track, and those going the other way, the other.
