1871.
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
I was this morning unwittingly drawn into this
debate, and I desire to say a word or two. I
propose, however, to occupy but a very few
minutes of the time of the House.
I am willing, Mr. Speaker, to leave to the
gentleman from Tennessee [Mr, Smith] the
undivided honor of defending this eleventh
section of the registry law of the State of
Arkansas. What, sir, are the provisions of
this act? Under the laws of our country all
men charged with crime are presumed to be
innocent until proven guilty. But in this
eleventh section of this law it is required of
the person challenged or charged, to prove
himself innocent, in other words, to establish
a negative, which in law is almost an impos-
sibility. It is to reverse the whole order of
evidence in our courts. Yet, gentlemen here
upon the floor of Congress this day defend it.
1 hold, Mr. Speaker, that, by no use of language
can this law be construed into anything else
than that it does disfranchise men for not
having voted for the reconstruction measures
of the Congress of the United States and the
constitution of the State of Arkansas.
Mr. MAYNARD. Will the gentleman allow
me to ask him a question?
Mr. McCORMICK, of Missouri. Certainly.
Mr. MAYNARD. The question I wish to
put to the gentleman from Missouri is, whether
lie considers that in requiring to prove his loy-
alty we require him, or that anybody requires
him, to prove a negative?
Mr. McCORMICK, of Missouri. I say you
must establish a man's disloyalty, if he is
charged with disloyalty, before you can con-
demn him for disloyalty. If a man is arraigned
before a tribunal on any charge he is not re-
quired by our laws, or by the Constitution, or
by the principles which govern the judiciary
of our country, to prove himself innocent.
Mr. MAYNARD. I would suggest to the
gentleman from Missouri, [Mr. MoCorjiick,]
who, I understand, is a lawyer, like myself,
that when a man applies to be registered, in
order to show that he is entitled to be regis-
tered he must bring himself within the rules,
by showing liis citizenship, his residence, his
age, and his loyalty. None of these things are
presumed ; they are always proved.
Mr. McCORMICK, of Missouri. I say that
if a man, presumed to be entitled to vote
under the laws of a State, is challenged before
the registering oflicers, there is then a case
for investigation. Cut I contend that he must
be proven guilty of the charges brought against
him before he shall be disfranchised and de-
prived of the rights of a citizen, and that it
does not and should not devolve upon him
to prove himself innocent. Sir, I have seen
this again and again in the State of Missouri,
under a registry law which was passed in
almost exact accordance with this law of the
State of Aikansas. 1 have seen men who were
arraigned before the supervisors of registra-
tion, charged with having been in sympathy
with those engaged in the rebellion, and they
were required to prove their innocence. _ ^Sir,
it was an impossibility. No one can testily to
what are tl'â€že sympathies of any living man,
except himself and his Creator; and such a
law, therefore, puts it beyond the power of
the accused to prove himself innocent. _ This
law is exactly in keeping with that law in the
State of Missouri. And if gentlemen here
wish to defend the existence of such laws in
our country, I am willing to allow them to
claim what credit they may for taking such a
course.
Mr. MAYNARD. If the gentleman will
allow me, I would remark that this law is sub-
stantially the same as the laws of Tennessee
and of other States where there, have been any
requirements as conditions-precedent to regis-
tration. The party seeking registration must
show that he is qualified under the laws gov-
erning the right to vote.
Mr. McCORMICK, of Missouri. Under tins
law, Mr. Speaker, a man who has been re-
quired to talce an oath of allegiance to the
Government of the United States or to give
bonds for good behavior is disfranchised upon
either of three conditions: first, if he violated
his oath; second, if he refused to cooperate in
favor of the reconstruction policy of Congress;
and third, if he did not vote in favor of the
adoption of the constitution of the State of
Arkansas.
Now, Mr. Speaker, it is clear that those
men are disfranchised for the simple fact that
they did not vote for the constitution. They
may have taken the oath of allegiance, and
they may not be able to prove before the regis-
trar that they have kept that oath ; they may
have violated the oath; but if they can prove
that they have voted for the constitution of
the State of Arkansas they are entitled to vote.
It is therefore one of the qualifications of voters
in Arkansas that the voter must have supported
the reconstruction measures of Congress and
must have voted for the adoption of the con-
stitution of the State of Arkansas. If they have
voted against it they are disfranchised under
this law by the very act of having exercised
the right of American freemen. And yet, gen-
tlemen are to-day defending this law and de-
fending Governor Clayton, who, as the Execu-
tive ot the State, must have approved the law
before it could have gone upon the statute-
book of the State.
Now, Mr. Speaker, Ishallnot takeup further
time of the House in the discussion of this
subject. I repeat what I said a few moments
ago, that this law is a legislative monstrosity;
that it is ail outrage upon the liberties and
rights of the people, and a disgrace to tliu
age in which we live.
