APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
it
27th Con©....1st Sess. -
Repeal of Independent Treasury—Mr. Benton.
Senate.
therefore, I get rid of (he confusion of ideas which
seem to me to have embarrassed the former debate,
by coupling the collectors of the easterns, receiver 
of money for lands, treasurers ot  tne  mints, and
the l.ke, who hold other offices, have other duties
to perform, and give  other  official bonds, under
other and diffi rent laws.    I ask, then, what will
be the conduion of the money in the hands of these
four "Rec ivers Gerier«l," the moment aftcr this
bill shall have re-eived ihe signature of the Presi-
dent and become th" Hw cf tne land?    There can
be neither doabt nor auesuon, dipt the moment the
law creating their offices is res ealed,  the  offices
they hold will drop from them, and  they   \v,U be-
com , in fact and in law, pmate citizens, en'nelj
discharged from all future officcal responsibility.
What, then, I repeat, will be the condition of tha
money m men nantS, or wrtich shall come into
them, beroi^ ro'ice oí this hw can leach them'    I
■will tal e the Recei/i r Geneial at New York, tti
nearest   point, for an lllus'tation.     Tn, t cüic i
must be aaily receiving very '¿rgc sures, siy twen-
ty, thirty, fifty tl ou^and do! ais, and on some oays
vastly more than the highest sum mentioned.  The
persons re", urecl 10 pay over to him are numerous,
and the collec'ions of some of them immense.  The
balance in the bands oí that cfiiee -, too, most a!
■ways be considerate.   1 have made inquiry upon
this point, and find there is seldom less thai one
or two hundred thousand dollars, and sometimes
half ami'1,0".   Twob"Siress dajs,  at the leasf,
must elapse, after tris bid shall become a hw,  be-
fore notice of the fact can reach him, and tbi e
who e du v it now is to pay morey to him.   For
those two days he continues io reccwe and pay
money, ignorant of the íact tha' he is a mere pri-
vate citize , v l'houi lights or obhgations as a pub-
lic officer.    Tne nut>ce ot  the repeal ot the law
reaches h"a  t.'-d finds h.m in the   pis e'sion and
occupancy of ai. cihee rcn'td by the Gineiiimcm
for the aeota public officer who has not, and has
not had for two days, any existence.    He, therefore,
has no further right there.   His stron* box is m the
vault and the keys in his pocket.    He makes an
examination, and finds that the balance of money
in his charge at the moment his office ceased was, if
you please, one hundred thousand dollars; tbat he
has received, «mee that period,   and before the no-
tice of the repeal reached him one hundred thou-
sand  dollars'more; an ' that he has pi'd upon  the
drafts of the Treasurer of the ürnted Sute , with-
in the t*o davs of his pction wiihout   ottuo, fifty
thousand dollars, leading a nett balance ot   mot'ey
in his keepu e. of one hundred and   fifty thou and
dollars.    What is he to dt?   No man is now, or
has been for two days, re<ponsib"e,  as h's su^ty,
for bis conduct; his oflUe is gone; his salary gone,
and this mo^ey is in his hands as a private citizen,

on the subject,
Mr. CALHOUN wished, before the"vote should
be taken, to offer a few words on this bill. One
fact was estab ished during this discussion, and that
an important on : that tbote was a large majority
in the Senate who were utterly averse to leaving
the Treasury under an unregulated S'ate bank
system. He need not refei o the m'nidual gen-
tlemen who h?d exmessed thisorni'io^- the fact wts

ine v'iote of this p oc emrj; «a-.. ost pxirsordi-
naty. GeUlemen s¿id tnat ti vcice ot the Ame-
rican people demanded the com-e they vyere pur-
suing. Now Mr G. would admit, for the sake of
argument, that the voice of the majority wa
agam.t the Independent Treasury—though he held
it ve'y doubtfu'—but there could be no doubt that
their vo ce had be3n uttered m an infinitely louder
key against leavi.g tne pub'ie money unregulated
by law. Under the pietence, then, of carrying out
the pub'ic will, they were about to do an act which
was infinitely more m oppositioi to the will of the
country than any ether.
We had been told that this was to bs a reform
Administration. Now he held that no act which
viohted the law and the Constitution was worthy
of the name of reform; and yet the only two acts
of this reform party was to leave the printing of the
Senat  unreg dated bylaw, and to place the Treasu-
ry m a condition still wors', thaHs, one in which
it could only b, ie u ated by violating law. No:
tbeie ii, another . Who was the Printer to the Se-
nate' Did any gentleman know? What were
the prices fiipj for tne printing' Could gen-
tlemen teli? Who fixed these priced Did any one
know? Could an) gentleman reply? All this was
abe left to the di cretu n ot the Se-retary, and this
by rescinding pn exis ,ng contract  nh the former
Prmter, which regulated by la y ad that appertain-
ed to the printing of the Sena'e. These facts
would snortly go to the American people. This

But we are to'd tha' this postare of things was
to be lempjiaty only. Was this «o certa n? Were
gentkm* n ^o pcrfttily united among themselves as

not many start a'lde on consul ufonal ground and
oppo-e a Bank of the CJntl d Statf ? If tbat

Coi.ll tbeie be founu an intermediate ground be-
tween a bank, the independent Tieasury, and the
¡state bank =y-.tem? Th«ie rright possibly be, but
re as' cd vnat it Vras"2 lie was no enemy to the
baiking system, bu* he acsnowiedged that he had
no iaith m o?nks ot circulation and issue. He had
long said that the banks must fall by their own
hand. Did gentlemen think that they acted as
friends to the banks by repealing the Independent
Treasury í According fo his belief, whether
they cuate a Bank ot the United States or not, it
was indispensable th"t the conntiy t-hould collect
its dues in gold and silver and its own credit.
Wi'hout it, t.ie Uuikd States Bank ltielf must run
