National Defense-—Mr. Johnson,
Ho. of Reps.
that the individual here alluded to was Fitch,
and that his interview gave rise to this admon-
itory letter, and took place not long before its
slate
The January number of the New York Re-
view, just published, contains a well-written ar-
ticle on "steam navigation," and Iiegret that
the writer was not in possession of all the facts
touching its early history It theiein appears
that Mr O^den, claiming certain rights as repie-
«entative of Pitch, asserted them by petition be-
fore the Legislature of New York Among other
•estimony before the committee raised on this
petition, was that of Geneial Bloomfield, fixing
the peuod of Fitch's experiment to 1787 or 1788
On the authority of De Warville, the correspond
ent of Jefferson, and an eminent French wntei of
that period, I feel warranted m saying that it was
the latter year.
In his work, published in 1789, which will be
found in your library, he states that, being in
Philadelphia in September, 1788, he attended by
invitation, and witnessed Pitch's experiment In
a note, wutten in the February following, m Lon-
don, he says-
" I hive just become acquainted with Mr Rumsey, of
Vireimi, a gentleman of gieat ingenuity, who proposes
ouildmg a vessel in which, withou sails, and by steam
alone, lie wai cross the Atlantic in fifteen days "
This subhmeconception, this bold undertaking
of Rumsey, the accomplishment of which in the
last year has created so vasta sensation, was not
unknown to meand othersofhisfamily,but, with-
out the high authoiity of Do Warville, I would
not have ventured to have named it The Eng-
lish article in the Encyclopedia manifests much
ignorance and carelessness in itspieparation, as,
for instance, without the shadow of truth or evi-
dence, it ascribes to Mr Symington the honor of
introducir  the steamboat into America, and at
the same time states that Symington's first exper-
iments were on the Forth and Clyde, in 1801
Cold Stanhope, Symington, the Abbe Arnel of
Fiance, Fulton, and others, seem to have been
uiged to reflection and action on this subject, in
consequence of Rumsey's operations in London
The American supplemental article in the Ency
clopedia is also, in many respects, unfui, disin-
genuous, and untiue The compilei, who is the
paitial eulogist of Fulton, aware that ho cannot
ascnbe to his favorite the glory of onginality,
endeavors to mystify and becloud, rathet than to |
lllustiate, the truehistorv of the invtntion of the !
steamboat He gives to Fitch, whose claims |
weie untenable, precedence of Rumsey, and I
think Í ha\p shown thit ho succeeded him al-
trough I have dwelt on but part of the evidence 1
that evidence, taken togethei, most cleaily pi oves
that Fitch was but a borrower The compilei
goes fuither, and, as if to do away with all claim |
which Rumsey, oi even Fitch, might have upon
the good opinion of their countiymen, says that
the idea of steam navigation had been entertained I
at a still earlier peí lod by Hulls, of England, and I
that theiefore he is better entitled to the honor of
originality than Rumsey, although he admits that
he made no attempt to leduce it to practice, and
Rumsey, under the most adverse circumstances,
actually succeeded in running a boat against the
current of a river foui or five miles an houi The
compiler further alleges that Rumsey, with unlim-
ited patronage, andafterfull tual, abandoned the
project as liopeless Indisputable testimony
shows that the assertion is as unfounded and false
as it is illiberal and cruel I judge that it is fiom
this woik that the Secietary ot the Treasury de-
duces what he calls his " miscellaneous facts" in
the report upon the steam engine, laid upon oui
tables a few days ago And from the misquota-
tion of names and confusion of dates—caused, no
doubt, by hasty reference—he has not improved
the accuracy t>f the onginal article
From the ignorance and carelessness, willful
or otherwise, displayed m this treatise in the En-
cyclopedia, I have no confidence in the statement
that Hulls, of England, obtained apatentfoi steam
navigation one hundred years ago I am led to
this conclusion bv various íeflections The steam-
engine at that early day, and, indeed, down to the
time of Wait, in the Ktter pait of the eighteenth
century, was very inefficient, and veiy little used
even for the simplest purposes.   It is not stated,
So far as my examination has gone, what agent
Hulls contemplated using, whether steam oi an-
imal power And, further, Rumsey obtained a
patent from the British Government for the same
object (steam navigation) long afterwards, (in
1788,) which was then considered by all the in-
telligent and scientific men of London as new and
original
But even if the idea of steam navigation had
been entertained in Eut ope at this anterior peuod,
Rumsey was not the less original Theie was no
knowledge m America that such a design had
ever been presented in Europe Rumsey, imper-
fectly educated as he was, with a slight acquaint-
ance with books, relying, as he did, on his own
íesources, on his own inventive genius, had nevei
heard of it, and even if he had heaid that such a
suggestion had been made, it can operate nothing
in diminution of his merit I, sir, can declare that
I have invented a plan for aerial navigation—that
I have devised a machine by which I will soar
aloft above the dull atmosphere encompassing the
earth, where clouds and storms prevail, into the
pure regions of ether, where, manufacturing an
air suitable to the sustentatton of life, I will tra-
verse thousands of miles in an hour. But if I
stop here—if I exhibit no plan—if I devise no
machinery—if I in no way prove its feasibility—
surely I am entitled to no credit for this suggestion
ofa wandering fancy, common, no doubt, to thou-
sands Ifyouafterwaids,whetheryou haveheoid
my suggestion or not, devise a plan, construct
machmeiy, and actually succeed in navigating the
air, the honor of ouginahty is exclusively your
own 1 cinnot paiticipate—it would be prepos-
terous for me to anogate any portion of the credit
If, fiom the infant state of the mechanic aits, or
yourpoveity, or your eaily death, you left it in
complete, a'though you had doneenough to prove
its practicability, and to attiact to it the attention
of ingenious and scientific men, and mother after
wards, improving upon your plan, biought it into
successful and genetal operation, would it not be
unfair that your claims, although you had found
the diamond, although you had put the ball in
motion, should be entirely superseded and disre-
gaided' Should not the woild, in the rendition
ofa just judgment, place you at least on teims of
equality >
Mi Speakei, I will not detain the House longer,
I have already occupied too much tune, I will
only add that, while many of the reptesentatives
of Jame3 Rumsey are poor, veiy poor—for, in
consequence of his early death, they never de-
rived any benefits fiom the numeious inventions
of their ancestor, except such as have been en-
joyed by the whole countiy—there is yet one of
them whose claims address themselves to the best
sympathies of our nature The one to whom I
allude is the only son, the only hung child, of
James Rumsey While lus fathei was in Eng-
land, devoting himself with fatal intensity to the
completion of the steamboat, that son, by a ma
hgnant disease—scailet fever—was, in early in-
fancy, deprived of the faculties of speech and
heaung Talented, ingenious, ready, and dexter-
ous at vauous mechanical employments, he is
now earning a scanty subsistence by daily labor,
but, with the improvidence common to persons in
his condition, making no preparation for ap-
proaching old age To the support and comfort
of the evening ot his life I have thought his coun-
try might contribute something, without violating
any principle of wise policy
Mr Speaker, I have stood upon the bank of
the beautiful river which washes the broad border
of my own beloved State, and contemplated the
majestic steam-palace in her proud career, ex-
changing with rapidity and cheapness the produc-
tions of different climes, conveying with comfort
and expedition the traveling public, giving new
life and energy to commerce, to agncultuie, to
national industry and enteipnse I say, Mr
Speaker, I have stood in muung mood upon the
shore of the fair Ohio, and viewed the noble
steamer moving victonous against wind and cur-
rent,
" Walking the waters like a thing of life"—
and then reflected that the only son of the man
who fiist seriously attracted the attention of the
skillful and ingenious to the subject, the only son
of the man who first yoked the power of steam
to the car of commerce, the only son of the ma 
who first, byactual trial,proved its practicability;
the only son of the man who, in his arduous
struggles to perfect and present to the woild the
steamboat, expended his little fortune, banished
himself from his home and his country, and in,
spite of all obstacles was pushing onwatds to
success, when arrested by sudden death—when
I have reflected that the only son of this man
was toiling for his daily bread, smitten by his
God, and neglected by his country, wh"n I have
contemplated that and this spectacle, the steam-
boat and the unfortunate son of its inventor,
feelings, emotions, reflections, have crowded upon
me of a character which, as a patriot, a philan-
thropist, and a Christian, 1 acknowledge  t was
improper and sinful to entertain To the support
of that stricken one, I have thought his countiy,
abounding in resources, with moie hundreds of
millions of public domain than she can squander
in ages, might contribute something mote sub-
stantial than a medal, without any extraordinary
stietch of liberality But it is not for me to so-
licit it, even for him I shall be gratified, deeply
gratified, if the Government of his countiy shall
honor the memoiy of his father for all his sacri-
fices and all his services by the adoption of this
resolution
Mr Speaker, I could have wished that the task
which I have endeavored to discharge had been
undertaken by another But while I knew that
on eveiy subject of a political oi paity nature
there would be, on this aiena, a host of intel-
lectual champions, armed cap-a pie, panting for
the conflict, and struggling foi the floor, I appre-
hended that, in a cause of this kind, which is
rathei of private concernment, there would be
out little interest felt, and but few, if any, pre-
pared to couch a ftiuidty or defensive lance
Hence, I have been constiaincd to tiespass on
the House
Mr Speaker, I have said that I had no pecu-
niary interest in this matter, yet, occupying the
pecuhai position which I do, if any vote should
be taken, I will of couise be excused fiom par-
ticipating in it
Notf —When Mr Rumsey concluded, and without fur-
ther debate, the resolution passed the House by a unani-
mous vote
national DcrENsr;

OF MARYLAND,
In the House or Representatives,
March 2, 1839
The bill entitled " A bill giving to the President
of the United States additional powers foi the
defense of the United States, in ceitain cases,
against invasion, and foi other purposes," being
under consideiation m the Committee of the
Whole on the state of the Union, Mi Johnson,
of Maryland, offered the following amendment
to the first section of the bill
" And that the sum of--------be, and the same is hereby,

Mr JOHNSON said that, before the chairman
decided upon the division of the vote just taken
on the amendment, he feltimpelled, by a sense of
justice to the subject matter of the amendment,
to claim the attention of the House for a few
minutes * At that late hour of the session he
could not so far forget his respect to the feelings
of the committee as to inflict a long set speech,
nor would the state of his health allow him to de
