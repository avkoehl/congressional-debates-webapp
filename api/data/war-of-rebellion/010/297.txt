GENERAL ORDERS, HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE OHIO,

Numbers 6. Field of Shiloh, Tenn., April 8, 1862

The general congratulates the army under his command on the imperishable honor which they won yesterday on the battle-field of Shiloh, near Pittsburg Landing. The alacrity and zeal with which they pressed forward by forced by forced marches to the succor of their comrades of a sister army imperiled by the attack of an overwhelming force; the gallantry with which they assaulted the enemy, and the persevering courage with which they maintained an incessant conflict against superior numbers from 6 o'clock in the morning until evening, when the enemy was driven from the field, are incidents which point to a great service nobly performed.

The general reminds his troops again that such results are not attained by individual prowess alone; that subordination and careful training are essential to the efficiency of every army, and that the success which has given them a brilliant page in history is greatly due to the readiness with which they have seconded the labors of their division, brigade, and regimental commanders, who first disciplined them in camp and then led them judiciously and gallantly in battle.

By command of Major-General Buell:

JAMES B. FRY

Assistant Adjutant-General, Chief of Staff.

Numbers 88. Report of Surg. Robert Murray, U. S. Army, Medical Director, with return of casualties.
