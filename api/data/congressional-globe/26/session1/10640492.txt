more or less severely from time to time. Austria,
Sweden, Denmark, Russia, France, England,
and the United States, all, all have suffered more
or less the evils of this unwise, unstable, and dan-
gerous currency.
The famous Mississippi bank paper establish-
ment of John Law, in 1718, spread consternation
and distress throughout the kingdom of France.
The South sea act in England, the next year, en-
acted through the influence of Sir James Blunt,
became equally celebrated for the mischief, infatua-
tion and ruin which it produced. These schemes,
so productive of idleness, extravagance, immorality,
and crimes, have become a part of the history uf
those countries.
But the former has so far profited by experience,
that she has made reformations in her currency
until it has become probably one of the safest and
the best in the world. At the close of the year
1838, no bills were allowed, by law, to be issued,
of a less denomination than 500 francs or 93 3-10
dollars. The circulation of all her banks which
issue notes payable on demand and to bearer,
was at the time, 248,968,500 francs. Cash on
hand, 165,325,000 francs. Discounts, 1,235,777,000
francs.
The establishment of the Bank of England in
1694, may be regarded as the foundation aivl origin
of the present system of paper currency, which pre-
vails in England and in the United States.
That Bank was established on credit; and has
been sustained by acts of legislation, and by its
connection and identity with the Government. Yet
it suspended specie payments from 1797 to 1823;
and it is said, was recently saved from another sus-
pension by a loan from the Bank of France of
many millions of francs.
This bank being located in London, the great
cenire of the commercial world, has, in the nature
of things, a commanding and controlling influence
over the currency and trade of other countries, un-
less they are established and regulated on such
pnnciples as to guard against the influence which
a great emporium naturally exercises over those
countries whose business concentrates at that point.
Hence its expansions and contractions are felt in
all parts of the world—lets, perhaps, in France
than any other country, because she has taken
measures to secure her people and her currency
from such a dangerous influence; and more in the
United States than any other, because we are so
intimately connected by commercial relations—
have adopted her paper system, and have contri-
buted, by our bank policy, to expand the amount
of paper circulation, and to involve our citizens
and our States in a vast debt to the merchants and
bankers of London.
In imitation of the Mississippi scheme of France,
the South Sea bubble of England, and the Bank of
England, various banking institutions have been
established m this country, which have increased
their numbers, influence, and extent of their paper
. operations, until the ancient laws of trade and
commerce are entirely overthrown, and the coun-
try covered with a flood of paper.
The following table, from Blodget's Económica,
is perhaps sufficiently accurate to give a correct
idea of the number of banks, their amount of ca-
pital stock, bills in circulation, and metallic medi-
um, from 1784, soon after they were established in
this country, until the year 1804, a period of twen-
ty-one years; by which it will be seen that up to
that period, the amount of specie in circulation
was very great—sufficiently so, perhaps, to answer
the purposes of a sound currency, there being, at
the last of those dates, a metallic medium of
$17,500,000, while the bank bills had reached only
o $14,000,000.

Thus we see that, from 1811 to 1815, a period
of four years, the bank bills in circulation were
increased from twenty-eight millions to forty-five
millions, while the specie on hand increased but
one million and six hundred thousand dollars;
from 1815 to 1816, one year, the circulation was
increased frond forty-five millions to sixty-eight
millions, while the specie on hand increased but
two millions; from 1816 to 1820, four year3, the
circulation was diminished from sixty-eight mil-
lions to less than forty-five millions, and the specie
on hand in that time increased near a million;
from 1820 to 1830, ten years, the circulation was
again increased to sixty-one millions, and the spe-
cie to twenty-two millions; from 1830 to 183S, a
period of five years, the circulation was increased
from sixty-one to one hundred and three millions,
and the specie from twenty-two to forty-three
millions; from 1835 to 1836, one year, there was a
further increase of the circulation to one hun-
dred and forty millions, with a decrease of speoie
to forty millions; from 1836 to 1837, one year,
there was a further increase of circulation to one
hundred and forty-nine millions, with a further de-
crease of specie of more than two millions; from
1837  to 1838 there was a contraction of the circu-
lation of more than thirty-three millions, and a
decrease of specie of near three  millions; from
1838  to 1839, they expanded the circulation abont
nineteen millions, and increased their specie about
ten millions; from 1839 to 1840, the year last pa«t,
they again contracted their circulatton more than
twenty-eight million^, and their specie more than
twelve millions.
From 1830 to 1834, they swelled their loans and
discounts from two hundred millions to three hun-
dred and twenty-four millions; from 1834 to 1835,
one year, they increased their loans and discounts
to three hundred and sixty-five millions; from 1835
to 1836 to four hundred and fifty-seven millions;
and from 1836 to 1837 to five hundred and twenty-
five millions. At this point they reversed the
screws, and commenced contracting their loans and
discounts, which, in two years, from 1837 to 1839,
they contracted about thirty-three millions; and
within the la*t year they have made a still fur-
ther contraction of near thirty millions.
This plain statement of facts will enable us to
judge of the causes of the plenty and scarcity of
the circulating medium, which has been experi-
enced in this country at various periods of time
within the last thirty years, and the part which the
late Bank of the United States and the present
United States Bank of Pennsylvania performed in
this work of expansion and contraction will ap-
pear by the follow ing tables:

From Janury, 1832, to January, J833, that bank
contracted its loans and discounts from sixty-six to
sixt-yone millions, and its circulation from twenty-
one to seventeen millions. During the first quarter
of 1833, it increased its loans and discounts from
sixty-one to sixty-four million*, and its circulation
from seventeen millions to eighteen millions. Dor- <
ing the second quarter of that year, it contracted
its loans and discounts to sixty-three millions, and
increased its bills in circulation to nineteen millions.
During the third quarter of that year, it made* fur-,
ther contraction of loans and discounts to sixty miff
lions. During the last quarter of that year, it made*
further contraction of loans and discoacts to fifty-
four millions. In the first two quarters ot 1834, its
loans and discounts were contracted to fifiy-one
millions, and its circulation diminished near three
millions. In the third quarter of that year, the
loans and discounts were reduced to forty-six mil-
lions, and its circulation diminished about one
millón. In the last quaiter of that year, the loans
and discounts were still further reduced to about
forty-five and a half millions; making in all, from
April, 1833, to December, 1834, a period of one
year and eight months, a {contraction of loans and
discounts of near nineteen millions; and of bills m
circulation about two and a half million*. From
D«cember, 1834, to July, 1835, seven months,
it expanded its loans and discounts near twenty
millions, and its bills in circulation near ten mil-
lions. Within the next following five months, to #*
December, 1835, it contracted its loans and dis-
counts more than eight millions, and its circula
