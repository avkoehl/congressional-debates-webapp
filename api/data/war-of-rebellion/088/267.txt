HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,PROVOST-MARSHAL-GENERAL'S DEPARTMENT,

August 18, 1864.

Major-General HUMPHREYS, Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: A deserter from Ninth Florida, Finegan's brigade, mahone's division, who came into our lines on night of the 16th instant, has just been received from Ninth Corps. He reports that he went on picket on night of 16th; that just before leaving the trenches Mahone's old brigade was relieved by Harris' brigade. Wright's and Perrin's brigades went away from here on Sunday, and the balance of the division were in our front when he left. The informant is quite a youth, and knows very little of enemy's organization or position. A negro who came in last night was also sent in with above. He states that just before leaving enemy's lines (about dark) saw them moving artillery to their right, and he understood they intended opening on a camp of our troops, which they could see from their right flank. He has been at work in a gang of 1,500 negroes repairing and constructing fortifications about Petersburg. He is not intelligent and gives no information.
