Enemy are reported by our watchmen on Lookout Mountain as having lighted extensive camp-fires on hither side of Shields' Gap, as well as beyond. Our troops are now being drawn toward our left, and concentrated as much as possible. Rosecrans has not yet determined whether to make a night march and fall on them at daylight or to await their onset.

CRAWFISH SPRING, September 19-10.30 a.m.

Battle opened at 9 this morning on our right. Bragg in command of rebels. His force not yet ascertained. Engagement not yet general. His effort is to push into Chattanooga. In anticipation of this movement Thomas marched last night to our left. Crittenden pushed up behind him and McCook brought here as reserve.

As I write enemy are making diversion on our right, where Negley was left to hold fords. Negley is supported by Sheridan. An orderly of Bragg's just captured says there are reports in rebel army of Longstreet's arrival, but he does not know that they are true. Rosecrans has everything ready to grind up Bragg's flank.

NEAR CRAWFISH SPRING, September 19, 1863-1 p.m.

In my dispatch of this morning where it is said battle has begun on our right it should have been left. There is the fighting. Everything is going well, but the full proportions of the conflict are not yet developed. The engagement is now between here and Rossville, where Thomas has his headquarters.

WIDOW GLENN'S, September 19, 1863-2.30 p.m.

Fight continues to rage. Enemy, repulsed on left by Thomas, has suddenly fallen on right of our line of battle, held by Van Cleve; musketry and artillery there fierce and obstinate. Crittenden with remainder of his corps is just going in. Negley's and Sheridan's divisions and cavalry alone remain unengaged and Sheridan is ordered here, leaving Negley to hold the fords beyond Crawfish Spring. The mass of cavalry guards the gaps beyond it. Thomas loses pretty heavily in men; also lost one battery of Brannan. Decisive victory seems assured to us.
