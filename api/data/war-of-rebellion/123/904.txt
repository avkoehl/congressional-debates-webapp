parties - some of whom have held respectable stations in society - before a proper civil or military tribunal as soon as the necessary preliminary investigations by the judge-advocate can be completed. The same course is being pursued in respect to fraudulent contractors and disbursing officers.

The expenditure for enlistments, recruiting, drilling, and subsitence of volunteers, regulars, and militia, amounts to the sum of $ 20,692,282.99.

In some States the whole quota of volunteers and militia called for was entirely filled up by volunteers without draft. In some the whole number of volunteers was raised and a part of the militia. Other States are deficient in volunteers and have not yet made their draft, but have taken measures for that purpose. Illinois and Iowa have furnished more volunteers than their quota under both calls. The general acquiescence of all the loyal States in the measures deemed necessary to strengthen the armies and prosecute the war, at every hazard, to final success, proves the fidelity of the people to their Government, and their determination to maintain its unity and uphold its authority over the whole territory of the United States. Wherever any forcible opposition to the draft has appeared it was confined to narrow limits, and was suppressed by the action of the State authorities, through the provost-marshal, without the intervention of any armed force of the General Government.

The advantage of filling up the old regiments is shown by many considerations. Various expedients have been adopted to accomplish that object. The official returns show that since the call for volunteers 449,990 recruits have been added to the old regiments. By the aid of some legislation it is hoped that this important object may be effectually attained.

The Adjutant-General's Office has also had charge of the exchange of prisoners. In the month of July a cartel of exchange was arranged by General John A. Dix, on the part of the United States, and General Hill, of the rebel army, under which large numbers of prisoners of war have been exchanged. There still remain some paroled prisoners belonging to the U. S. Army, whose exchange will be effected at the earliest opportunity.

Experience has shown that serious defects exist in the militia law, which should be promptly remedied, and that the laws in relation to volunteers also need amendment. The views of the Department on these subjects will be communicated to the appropriate committees of Congress. The patriotic zeal and efficient aid cordially rendered by the respective Governors of the loyal States in the laborious and complicated duties pertaining to raising the volunteers and making the draft are thankfully acknowledged by this Department.

One of the principal bureaus of this Department, in respect to the amount of expenditure and the magnitude of operations, as well as their influence upon military movements, is that of the Quartermaster-General. His able and elaborate report will be found worthy of your special observation.* It presents a general statement of the operations of the department under his charge during the fiscal year. The clothing and equipage of the Army; all the relates to its shelter in camp, in barracks, or on the march; the organization, equipment, and care of the baggage and supply t rains; the purchase and charter of transports; the transportation of troops and supplies of all kinds;
