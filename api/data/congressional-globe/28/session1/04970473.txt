Mr. HOLMES moved that the committee rise:
rejected. ^ ,
Mr. TIBBATTS called the attention of the chair-
man of the committee to the reduction proposed
in the pay of the lieutenants, which he thought too
much for this grade. By the 15th section of the act
of 1835 these ..officers were allowed an additional
ration for five years' service. He proposed an amend-
ment to retain this allowance.
Mr. BLACK, of South Carolina, referred to the:
table of reductions in the report, which he explained,
and contended that the proportionate reduction was
not greater for this class of officers than for the
others. The extra ration for every five years' service
had been given to all the officers; and the chief ben-
efits of ihe section of the act to which the gentle-
man referred had enured to tlje officers of the higher
grades. â€ž
The amendment was was rejected.
Mr. PARMENTER offered an amendment to
continue the same extra allowance to marines, as
is granted by existing laws to seamen on foreign
service] for detention in service, Rafter the expira-
tion of the terms of their enlistment. This amend-
ment was agreed to.
Mr. HALE moved to amend, the twenty-second
section, so as to abolish corporal punishment for
desertion.
Mr. HOLMES asked if the infliction of punish-
ment by stripes and lashes was not already abol-
ished.
Mr. BLACK said that it was, except for the
crime of desertion, which was now punishable by
stripes and lashes. The section of the bill they
were now on, provided for the abolishment of that
kind of punishment for desertion, and to substitute
imprisonment and hard labor for it.
Mr. HALE said he understood that corporal
punishment of some kind now existed in the army.
[A member said: "yes, by paddling or cobbing."]
His object was to abolish corporal punishment alto-
gether. He would agree to leave in the punishment
of confinement and hard labor for the crime of de-
sertion as it now was in the section.
Mr. RATHBUN moved a further amendment, to
make the term of punishment not less than one, nor
more than five years, instead of not less than three,
nor moie than six, as in the bill.
Mr. SEMPLE moved to strike out six years, and
insert three.
This motion was rejected; and then
The amendment of Mr. Rathbun and the amend-
ment of Mr. Half, were agreed to.
Mr. COLES moved to strike out the whole sec-
tion: rejected.
On the motion of Mr. VANCE, the committee
rose, and reported progress.
Mr. C. JOHNSON submitted a statement, show-
ing the changes made by law in the pay, subsistence,
forage, &c., of the officers, non-commissioned of-
ficers, and piivates of the army, from the year 1791
to the present period, and moved that it be printed.
The motion was agreed to.
