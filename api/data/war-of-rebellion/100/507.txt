SIR: I propose to receive the surrender of the forces under your command, together with the arms and public property in your possession, and for this purpose would respectfully suggest that you send an officer to Jacksonville with the necessary invoices of property and rolls of your troops, to meet an officer designated by me, when the rolls and certificates of parole can be copied and the invoices prepared before an officer is sent out to receive the transfer of property and parole the troops. Lieutenant Denny, aide-de-camp, of my staff, will explain to you the necessity of having the papers prepared here and will bring me your reply. I have written heretofore to General Jones, but learn from General McCook, who arrived last night, that General Jones had already surrendered to him at Tallahassee.

I am, sir, very respectfully,
