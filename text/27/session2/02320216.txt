bine, and sift out the real connection oí the bankrupt with the
property that suriounds him It is the only chance of the ere
cUtors, against whom the law is arrayed, to protect their rights
"Under the lata banking sys em, the credits created by trusting
th°se people were called propeity Banks and individuals that
held their paper considered it as good property The amount
of that property represented by those who applied fordischarge
yesterday w this city, is estimated at 86,000 000 This, by the
operaron ol the law, will be annihilated The hope heretofore
«meitamed of being able to realize something from tfeese debts
has kept alive the hope of being able to pay of her debts That
chance lsnowdestioyed, and the probability of creating many
other bankrupts is increased, who, in their turn, will apply fui
a discharge, and contribute to pulldown some others in their
turn The avalanche is now hanging over the heads of thou
sands who little dream that they are in danger of being ciushed

Mr fALLMADGS presented several remonstrances on the
subject of the Bankrupt law, and whilst he was up, took occa
sion to make some lemark", winch he said had been sugges ed
by the remarks of the Senator fiom Missouri [Mr Benton j
That Senator, m his course on the Bankrupt bill pioceededon
the old maxim which had always governed his coui^e upon ad
questions of legislative action to which he was opposed—that
perseverance conquers always Theie was no anion
of Congrass against which he set his face, that he
did not peisevere in to the last to have undone lie
had hoped, atei the action of the Senate oo the repealing
bill, and after the Bankiupt law had gone into operation, tint
that tne question would not be aeam revived There vvas no
agitation m the country except that produced by the action of
theSenatoi Irom Mtssoun himself who would not permit the
question to remain settled It is he who has agitated and con
tributed to produce the stalp uf things of whick he now com
plains fhis measure hid been denounced by that Senator as
a party measure, that the law and the petitions fui the law were
concerted There was no paity about it The friend* oí the bUl
had striven to divest the question of all party considerations or
character, and deorecated the course of the Senatois on the
o her side who had made the effort to give it that cha
racter We now see the eííects of the Senator's not permitting
the question to be settled The apprehensions of the country
upon the subject had caused a great íushon the pait ol loose
who wished to embrace the law, for (ear th&titwouk be ie
pealed If it was permitted to become a permanent hw of the
land and amended as experience suggested was necehsary, it
would be one of the most palutary measuies for the countiy
ever passed since the founation of the Government If the
gentleman's Democratic principles w mid ,ermit Ima to st b

Mr PRFSTON was anxious that order might be maintained,
but, not being conversant with questions of this kind, was
somewt at at a lObS how best to effect that object According to
hisi •'collection of what had occuired the Chair had called to
order the moment the interruption had occurred A member
of the Senate had also called to order What should be done, he
was not prepared to say, but that something must be done, he
thought, was appaient It was a case evidently calling for
some decision Mr P then referred to some ca<=es which he
conceived in point, and thought the Senate ousht to pioceedto
the consideration with clo=ed d ors
Mr LINN hoped no* In all the difficulties which had arisen
during the time he was a member of the Senate and they had
been many, there never was but cne considered with closed
(loois-—tint which occunea between the Senator fram Ken-
tucky and the Senator from Alabama He considered the ac
tion of the toenafe on such d meulties, afrer the call to order bad
alla> ed tbem, uncalled for it was always better to let them be
settled by the parties themselves out of doors
Mi PRESTON withdrew hi- proposition to con ider the
matter with clo&ed doors.
Mr LINN thought It woull be wt 3 to make a rule but not
like the Bankrupt law, to act retiospectivelv Admost every
day the Senate was m ^es^ion foi the time which had fallen un

Mr  1 ALLMADGh.    There was no personality abo jt it
The CHAIR called to ord*r
Mr I INN regretted the difference which had occurred very
much, but he could not consent that one special case should be
^elected for the condemnation of the body, unless the Senate
should first establish definite rules and presenbe the appro
priate punishment, and then app'y those rules al ke and rigidly,
m all cases Mr L remembered many analogous cases, of
great heat an 1 violence, which had been po.=¡0ed over without
he Senate's having taken any notice of thrm whatever one,
especially, which had occurred not many months «mee, yet no
su pi had been tal en by the bodv, and it pa« od off He hoped
the same would be the case now md that the debate would
proreel as if no luteirnp  on bad occuned
Mi PRESTON thought th t aftei all that had occuned or

great ardor of his ieelinc* in favor of this bill, in which, a* they
all knew, he took a very likely interest, could not have been
aware how far those feelings had hurried him on He certainly
had been personal towards the Senator from Missouri, as &e-
paiated from the party with whom he acted, both on this bill
as well as onothei occasion^ Mr W certainly understood
him as having spoken of the public distress as being the fruit
of the doctrines and measures of that gentleman—not of his
party.
Mi TALLMADGEsaidhehadnotspokenof the gentleman
personally, but had stated his honest conviction that his couise
bad Iargelv contributed to produce the n.sh of which he com-
plained, as well as the distress which had led to u Mr r did
in his conscience believe so, and could not help it
Mr WALKER sail the gentlemaB had reasserted the same
sentiment in various forros and shapes
Mr TALLMAHGE said he had lea^seited now what he had
often assei ted before He had reiterated that sentiment on all
occasions, for he did in his heart believe that the course and
doctrines of the Senator from Missouri had produced, more than
any other cause the tx feting sta e of things
Mr WaI KER resumed S ch was no doubt the convic-
tion of tbehonoiable Senator but, as to how hehadexpie^sed
it, he was him olf, peihaps, fiot «0 good a íudge as those who
heard him The gentleman had pone further than he nowsup-

wa=! a lawful act of the Chair in order to supprebs disorder
The present debate was wholly out of oider No question was

Mr KING said that he was not 111 the Senate when the disor
