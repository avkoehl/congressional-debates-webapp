For specific accounts of the operations of each regiment, I respectfully refer to the accompanying reports. Where all vied with wach other in the performance of their respective duties, it is impossible to single out officers for special mention. I desire, however, to express my entire satisfaction at the conduct of the regimental commanders - Lieutenant Colonel R. Long, of the Seventy-third Ohio Volunteers; Colonel C. B. Gambee, of the fifty-third Massaachusetts Volunteers, and Colonel James Wood, jr., of the One hundred and thirty-sixth New York Volunteers - all of whom, by their vigilance and watchfulness, contributed to lighten my own cares and resposibilities. I cannot forbear mentioning with commendation the members of my staff - Captain Benjamin F. Stone, jr., acting assistant adjutant-general; Captain J. D. Maderia, acting assistant inspector-general; Captain E. H. Pratt, and Lieutenant H. E. Van Zandt, acting aides-de-camp, whose constant attention and ready response to all calls in seasons of the greatest danger entitle them to the greatest praise. In closing, I venture to express the opinion that the arrival of this brigade upon Cemetery Hill at a critical moment, in good order and with full ranks, contributed much toward checking the enemy's advancing forces, and resulted in holding the hill, which, in my own opinion, was of the most vital importance, as was demonstrated by the subsequent actions.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

ORLAND SMITH,

Colonel, Commanding Second Brigade.

Lieutenant R. E. BEECHER, Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
