Settlement of Florida—Mr. Benton.
Senate.
lb occupied by armed settlers These are the effi-
cient means to terminate the war, and they are
the cheapest means—cheapest in a mere moneyed
point of view, to say nothing of being cheapest in
lives
It is objected to the bill by the Senator from
Massachusetts [Mi Davis] that these ten thou-
band settlers are to be without military oigamza-
tion, and possibly he might have found a still
stionger objection to them if they had been or
gamzed If they had been organized, then we
should have encountered objections to an army
of ten thousand men, over and above our íegular
Army of twelve thousand This was well fore
seen, it was foreseen that we should have aery
against a new army, and, therefore, the settleis
go under then real characters of cultivators, and
when assembled m their stations, they can
form themselves into companies and battalions,
if they please, under the laws of Honda, or
they may remain in their stations and choose
a leader from among themselves, if they wish
to make expeditions, and pursue the Indians
They can make such expeditions if they please,
it will beat their own option, the bill does not
require it, itrequires but three things, first, to live
at the station, secondly, to defend it if attacked,
thndly, to cultivate the ground for their own ben-
efit This is all that the bill requires, and to do
these things requires no mihtaiy organization
Doubtless the settlers will defend themselves, and
they can choose their own leadeis for that pur-
pose United States troops will always be at
hand to aid them, ami such disposition of the
troops can be made that ovei y station will be with
in protecting distance of a body of r< ^ulai s
The Senatoi from Massachusetts [Mi   Davis]
fuither objects to the bill because it contemplates
a settlement of the Terntory of Florida     He
says it is a bill to piomote settlement, to cause
the countiy to be settled, to induce people to go
to the countiy and settle there     Sn, it is rather
a bill to  resettle the country, to íeoccupy it, to
lepeople it     Often has it been stated m this dc
bate that the inhabitants of four counties and a
half of this poition of Florida have been duven
from their homes for three years   that about one
bundled miles squaie of the  teintoiy between
the Suwannee and the St  Johns, and  between
the Georgia line and the Withlacoochee nvei, all '

bill to restóle those exiled families to then homes
It is an object of the bill, al o, to restoie the set
tlement and to rebuild tin light house at the point
of the peninsula, wheieso much commeice passes,
wheie the contricted gorge of the gulf, the vio

dangei to ships and mariners, the supplies which
the hostile Indians íeceived theie from wrecked

Having read this letter, Mr. B appealed to
the Senator fiom Massachusetts [Mi Davis] as
a friend to commerce, and as representing a com-
mercial State, to aid m restoung the exiled in-
habitants to their homes at the point of the pen
insula, that the light house which the Indians
had burnt down might be rebuilt, and a popula-
tion established theie,notonlyto succor manners
and ships after they were wiecked, but before it,
to relieve them while in distress, and to save lives,
vessels, and property, from the dangers which
they now encountered In the name of commeice,
Mr B invoked the Senator from Massachusetts
to cease his opposition, and to give his aid to the
settlement of Florida, to its occupation and re-
occupation by our own citizens, to the exclusion
of the marauding and murdenng Indians which
now roamed over it, íavaging where they went
Forty-one thousand squaie miles of territory,
a legion fiom the Suwannee liver to the Atlantic
ocean, from the State of Georgia to Cape Sable,
a region of country above foui hundred miles in
length and moie than one hundred in breadth—
this vast region, capable of sustaining a laige
population, rich in the production of the most
valuable tropical crops and fruits, the proper re-
gion of the mulbeny, where thiee gtneiations
of the silk woim, and consequently three suc-
cessive supplies of their nch pioducts, may be
annually expected, where fisheues of great value
await oui industry, and wheie, fiom its geo-
giaplucal position, commerce demands aid and
succot This large and rich region now demands
the motection of this Government, and certainly
piotection is the fust duty which the Govern-
ment owes to its citizens
The Senator from Massachusetts, in the uni-
versality of his objections to the bill, deprecates
it as a new measme—as a new mode of pioceed
ing, never before thought of Sir, it is new, I
admit, but new only in the sense of the French
proveíb, which says "nothing is new but what
has been forgotten " In this sense the plan of
the bill is new for the Senator seems to have for-
gotten that every inch of tcmtoiy on this conti-
nent, now occupied by white people, was taken
from the Indians by armed settleis.and that pre-
emptions and donations of 1 end have foiever íe
warded the bold settlers who tendered this ser-
vice to the civilization of the world The savages
have given way before the aimed settler from the
day that the New World was discoveied up to the
piesent time The blockhouse, the stockade, the
¡lile, have taken the country, and have held it,
from the shoies of the Atlanticto the farWest.and
in every instance grants of land have rewarded the
couiage and enterpuse of the bold pioneer The
bill, then, instead of proposing something never
heaid of before, proposes, in fact, to go back to
the old and tried mode of pioceedmg—to go back
to the ancient and wise practice of our forefa-
thers, and to follow the course which has been
always followed in the settlement of new coun-
tries
SETTLEMENT OF ÍLOIÍIDA
SPEECH   OF HON. T. H. BENTON,
OF MISSOURI,
In the Sevate, Tthuarxj 5, 1839
The bill for the armed occupation and settle-
ment of that part of Florida which is now over-
run and infested by hostile bands of Indians, was
taken up and read
[The bill proposes to grant three hundred and
twenty acres of land to each white settler ovei
the age of eighteen, able to bear arms, not ex-
ceeding ten thousand men, who shall settle in
such parts of Florida as shall be indicated by the
Government, and to remain there as cultivators
■a ltd the Indians are expelled from the country
The settlers to live in stations of fiom foi y to
one hundred men, to have a special protection
from the Umted States tioops while putting up
their blockhouses, and a geneial piotection after-
wards The United States to supply them with
piovisions for one yeai,and with seed grains and
seed vegetables for the first ciop, with ammuni-
tion until peace is iestored,and tiansportation to
distant stations, each settler to choose his own
land, according to the date of settlement, so that
first settlers shall have first choices within their
i espective districts, with several minor pi ovisio ns
for the benefit of the health, comfort, and safety
of tho settler ]
The bill having been read through,
Mr BENTON said that it was a new measure,
proposing a radical change m the mode of ex-
pelling the Indians from Florida, and that an ex-
position of its principles, and of the reasons for
proposing it, would naturally be expected by the
Senate
It is a new measure It proposes to carry set-
tlers, instead of militia and volunteers, to Flori-
da , it proposes settlement and cultivation, instead
of campaigns and battles, it proposes to substitute
the ax, the plow, and the hoe, for the gun, the
sword, and the bayonet This is a radical change
in our mode of operating in Florida, and the rea
sons for it are clear and decisive Troops have
been tried, and have failed in accomplishing the
object Every species of troops have been tried,
regulars, militia, and volunteers, horse and foot.
They hate made campaigns and fought battles
for three years, and have done all that men could
do under such cncumstances, and they have suf-
fered more than men ought to be required to suffer
in such a wai, and all without accomplishing the
object Three years have been consumed m mili-
tary operations, and at what cost and with what
results' At the cost in money of near $20,000,000;
in lives, of neai forty offictrs killed, or died of
their wounds, or of the climate, of many wounded,
ofneaily fourhundled soldieiskilled and wounded
of the íeguhr Army, besidesheavy losses among
the militia and % olunteers This is the cost' and
what are the results > The results are four coun-
tits of Floinla depopulated—the Indians íavag-
mg the countiy fiom Cape Sable to the Okefmo-
kee swamp—the frontiers of Geoigia attacked—
depredations carried to the suburbs of St Augus-
tine and Tallahassee—the light house at Florida
Point burnt and destioyed—shipwrecked man-
ners on the coast of Florida massacred—and all
cultivation suspended over a large district of
countiy, part of which was settled and cultivated
undei the dominion of Spam, when Florida was
a province of that kingdom These are the re-
sults after three years of military operations—
aftei this great cost in money and in lives.
The inefficacy of campaigns and battles is
proved, and the question is, what shall we do
nevt' Shall we continue to call out thousands of
voiunteeis to cooperate with the regular Army m
the further prosecution of the war' Shall we con-
tinue to cill upon the surrounding States for their
annua! supply of men and horses for this fruitless
sei vice ' Snail we still project campaigns and bat-
tles > Our opinion is, that we shall cease with
that mode of canying on the contest, that wo
shall give up the idea of campaigns and battles,
that we  shall open our eyes to the tiuth of the
Eroblem that this is not a sei vice for an army to
e employed upon * that it is an unfit and im-
practicable service for an army, and that an armed
occupation and settlement of the territory is the
true way of expelling the Indians and pacifying
the country
This is the mode recommended and sanctioned
by the Administiation,and approved bv the most
experienced officers The Secietiry of War, in
h s report at the commencement of the scss.on,
suggests the plan General Jesup,who has been
so much emoloyed, and rendered so much leal
service in Florida, fully appi oves it The Surgeon
General, Dr Lawson, who has done double duty
in Flouda—commanding a corps and healing the
sick and the wounded—also fully approves it.
Governor Call, m a message to the Territorial
Legislature, does the same Geneial Hernandez,
a native of St Augustine, engaged m several of
the expeditions against the Indians, and a great
los«r by their depiedations, also is full and ex-
plicit in favor of the new pian The sentiments
of all these gentlemen have be<m made known to
the Senate, in written communications, addressed
