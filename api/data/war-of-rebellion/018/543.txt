WASHINGTON, D. C., August 7, 1862.

Major-General POPE, Sperryville, Va.:

The only cavalry here is the "Scott's Nine Hundred," only 622 men. I understand that the Twelfth Pennsylvania Regiment is at Manassas. Can you not send that to General Burnside? He must have some till I can get a regiment or two from McClellan.

WASHINGTON, D. C., August 7, 1862.

Major-General POPE, Sperryville, Va.:

I am of opinion that the route from Covington to Harrisonburg is more safe than that by Staunton. The latter seems to me very hazardous.

Order as you deem best, but with caution.

Baltimore, Md., August 7, 1862-3.40 p. m.

Major-General HALLECK:

I would be much pleased to have Winchester under my command, because of its direct communication with Harper's Ferry and Martinsburg, but I have not troops sufficient to occupy it without the troops now there. Seven regiments of my command (three-months' men) will be discharged in about three weeks.
