HEADQUARTERS FOURTH ARMY CORPS, Franklin, Tenn., December 17, 1864-8 p. m.

Brigadier-General WHIPPLE,Chief of Staff:

Colonel Suman, in charge of building or rather repairing the bridge across the river, reports that it will be impossible to accomplish the work, owing to the rapid rise in the river, the swiftness of the current, and the amount of driftwood coming down the stream. One of the bents that he straightened up has been pushed down again, and he has one bent yet to put in, which he cannot do, as the men cannot work in the river and they have no boats to assist them. I see no other way than to wait for the pontoon train. This should be hurried forward, for I am confident we cannot cross until it comes up. If you will hurry that forward we will put it down and cross immediately.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

TH. J. WOOD,

Brigadier-General, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS FOURTH ARMY CORPS, Franklin, Tenn., December 17, 1864-8 p. m.

Colonel SUMAN,Ninth Indiana:

If the prospects for completing the bridge are no better than when I was there with you and you are still of the opinion you were when I left you, you many suspend work and go to camp. You had better draw your rations to-night.

By order of Brigadier-General Wood:

W. H. SINCLAIR,
