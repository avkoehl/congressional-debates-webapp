You will make the following dispassion of your troops this evening: Leave one brigade of your division in the valley, near the base of the western slope of Rocky Face Ridge. Your picket-line should hold its present position and must keep up connection with General Stanely on the right and General Newton on the left. Your remaining two brigades will take a good defensible position on Tunnel Hill, near the point where the road from Tunnel Station to Dalton crosses it.

Brigadier-General WHIPPLE,

GENERAL: I recommend that the Fourteenth Corps advance by the way of Villanow. The road will be found to be a mile or two longer, but is not blocked nor so badly cut up as the road by Geary's headquarters or that by Thornton's. Butterfield's troops reached here at 8 o'clock. Please inform me what time General Geary will be relieved.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

COLONEL: I am just in receipt of marching orders for Snake Creek Gap. I would respectfully ask more explicit instructions. Am I do put the road from here to Sanke [Creek] Gap in good condition for double track or merely the road through the gap? Which route does the major-general commanding advise me to march, via Doctor Millbanks and Griffin's, or via Babb's Mill, near Dug Gap? (See official map.) Will a guide be sent me? My division will be under way in three-quarters of an hour from this time.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

DANL. BUTTERFIELD,
