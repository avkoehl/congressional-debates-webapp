THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
1539
Sec. 7. Jind be it further enacted, That alt the land
granted (by any other act) during the present session of
Congress, to any Statu to aid m the construction of any rail-
road therein, «h«ii ho deducted fiom the amount granted by
this act to said State.
Mr. BENNETT. Mr. Speaker, T do not desire
to debate this bill, but to explain its provisions. It
is intended as a general bill, in lieu of the various
railroad bills urged upon the consideration of Con-
gress; and to grant to each of the land States an
amount of public lands sufficient for railroad pur-
poses, placing them all under the provisions of a
general law, and upon as nearly an equal footing as
possible, taking into the account the situation and
extent of each State, their condition as to navigable
rivers, &c., and the amount of grants already
made to each State—some having had more and
some less. It has been carefully examined by
members from the different States, and we have
endeavored to get it as near what will be equally
just to the several land States, all things consid-
ered, as it is possible to do.
It is one recommendation to this bill that it pre-
vents partial and special legislation, and grants to
all the land States land for railroads by a single
act, and upon the same terms, and upon princi-
ples of fairness and equality. But it bears a still
stronger claim to support, from its granting to the
other States also a share of the public lands for
the support of schools. Thus giving to all the
States some benefit of the public lands, and not
bestowing these grants exclusively upon only a
part.
The second section provides the manner in
which the land shall be taken, which is the same
as those contained in the Iowa railroad bill, which
was prepared with great care in the Senate. This
is applied to all the lands granted for railroads.
I wish to call the attention of Western gentle-
men to two important advantages to them which
this bill has over their special bills even, if they
could pass them. The first is, all these separate
bills double the price of the alternate sections, to
make up to the Government the loss of the land
given to these roads. And this bill grants for
roads to the land States over thirty millions of
acres in all, which at the Government price would
amount to some $40,000,000. This bill does not
double the price, and will save that amount to the
land States;—enough to pay for all the land grant-
ed by this bill to the old States, and about
$7,000,000 more! The other is, that their bills
all limit the land to be taken within fifteen miles
of the road. This only limits it to six sections
for each mile of the road. In both these respects
this bill is decidedly more favorable to the land
States than their own bills, which they urge so
strenuously.
Mr. RICHARDSON. I desiie to inquire if
the morning hour has not expired ?
The SPEAKER. It has not.
Mr. BENNETT. Now, in order to show with
how much liberality I mean to treat the land States,
I will say that there has been already granted to
those States every sixteenth section for schools. ,
This bill proposes to grant to the old States, land to
the amount of 150,000 acres to each Senator and
Representative, for school purposes; yet it will not
give to them so much m proportion to population
as has been already granted to the land States;
and it proposes to give to the land States, for
roads, about five million acrcs more than is
granted to the old States for schools, although the
latter are double in population,and should have—
according to population—double the amount of
land, yet by this bill, they will receive less than
the land States do. Upon the score of liberality,
the land States stand in this position: They have
lands granted them both for schools and roads,
■while the old States have lands granted them for
schools only. And gentlemen ought not to be so
illiberal as to refuse to vote an appropriation, un-
der these circumstances, for schools to the old
States, when they get both, for schools and for
roods also.
Mr. COBB. I wish to make one inquiry. The
gentleman from New York knows my feeling in
relation to the objects of this bill. He is aware
that I voted against it in committee. I am the ex-
ception he alludes to, who voted against reporting
this bill to the House. I never agree to report
what I cannot vote for afterwards. But suppos-
ing there was a probability the bill might pass, I
had a conference with the gentleman from New
"\ork, and he agreed that the bill should be so
amended, as to allow the various land States to
locate their lands in a solid body, and not requir-
ing them to locate them in alternate sections. In-
asmuch as I contended that the old States, m lo-
cating their lands, would take them in a solid
body, I asked, if the bill passed, that the new ones
should be allowed to take theirs in a solid body,
contiguous to the line of the railroad, and not be
required to take alternate sections. The gentle-
man from New York acceded to the proposition,
and I suppose he is willing still to have the bill so
amended.
Mr. BENNETT. I could not do so without
the consent of the committee that authorized it to
be reported. And beside, I tlunk such an amend-
ment would render the bill much less acceptable
on all hands. This bill gives them a larger grant
of land than is given to the old States, for this
very reason. By the present system, they were
limited to take the land within fifteen miles of the
road. In this they are not. They are required
to take it,as near as they can conveniently, to the
line of the road; but they are allowed to take six
sections to each mile of the road. So this bill is
better than gentlemen's individual propositions.
Mr. COBB. In Alabama, if you take alternate
sections, you cannot get land enough within forty
miles of the road to make the six sections to the
mile.
Mr. BENNETT. I ask the Clerk to read
what I send to his desk. But, in the first place, I
will move to recommit this bill to the Committee
on Public Lands. I ask the Clerk to read this
statement, showing how much land by this hill
would be granted to the land States, and how
much to the other States.

by this bill to the land States for railroad purposes,

Mr. BENNETT. I have had these tables
read for the purpose of showing the amount of
lands granted by this bill. By these tables every
one can see how much is granted by it to each
State precisely.
This bill will grant some five millions of acres
more to the land States than to the other States,
including the Central Railroad, and there had been
before granted to them for railroads and canals
about twelve millions of acres. The land States,
if they do not double the price of the alternate
sections, will be the gainer by several millions of
dollars by this bill. It is better for the country if
these railroad bills are to pass one or two at a
session, and it is right and just that this public
property should be used for school purposes in the
old Stales, as well as for road purposes in the new.
There is no other purpose in the world which
benefits the entire community as much as these
grants for schools. The increasing population of
the old States, and the increasing number of chil-
dren, require an increased school fund, and I do
not know where we can ask for it better than to
have it taken out of the public lands, when they
are being so liberally disposed of for every other
purpose. The following resolutions on this sub-
ject, from the Legislature of New York, weie
presented and read on a previous day:
