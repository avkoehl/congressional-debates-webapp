THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

Mr. WHEELER. I will explain it fully, if
the gentleman desires.
Mr. DEAN, it is always in the power of the
Hou~e to determine when debate should close
uoon any subject—a power that has always been
exercised since the adoption of the present rules,
and which is absolutely necessary in so numer-
ous a body as this. I have full confidence that
that power will not be impropeily exercised.
I have explained this matter so that gentlemen
may vote understandingly, and not send this
resolution to the Committee of the Whole, where
it must inevitably be lost. We have long since
taken our position in reference to European colo-
nization on this continent. President Pierce has
reiterated the doctiine in his inaugural, and ex-
tended it. This continent—this whole continent—
and the adjacent islands, are safe to us and our
institutions.
We are now called upon to take our position in
reference to another matter, and that is the right
of our citizens abroad. And those who favor the
passage of this resolution mean to send word to
all, thofc it is the deliberate voice of the American
Congress that the rights of an American citizen
abroad shall be guarded as vigilantly as if he were
upon our own soil; and if necessary, that the
whole force of the Government shall be invoked
to afford him protection—that the deck of an
American ship is sacred,and the spot on which a
person entitled to the protection of our Govern-
ment stands, whether At home or abroad, is as
inviolable as the sanctuary of the gods.
The SPEAKER. The question first in order
is the motion made by the gentleman from Vir-
ginia [Mr. Mii.lson] to commit the resolutions
to the Committee of the Whole on the state of the
"Union.
Mr. BAYLY, of Virginia. I ask for the yeas
and nays upon that motion.
The yeas and nays were ordered. [

Mr. STANTON, of Kentucky. I beg leave to
present the follow ing report fiom the Committee
on Printing:
Th'j membf!- of the llou-'o r u the CnmmiUee on Printing,
to whom we.e refetieil the le-ohiaon of Mr. STK\m, j>io
1 po-in<r the publication oi five thou-and additional eopi-^ of
' iheiepoitoi the S ip( liiitendent of the S"v-«-nth Ci n-u-,
I and thirty thou-and toaie- of the Ab^tiact; the te-o!uiion
ofMi. Fkntos, propo-muito p.ibh-h tntfiu thou-and addi-
' tional copie- of the report ol the Seventh (."en-n-; ami the
re-oluUon o; Mr. Wutctit, propo^iujr to publish thirty
thousand copie- oS the Sevuut'i Cen-n-, report:
That there were published, byord.-i of the la?-1 Con^ie-^,
1 for the u-e ol' the Suoate, f-evtm tbou-and, and lor the u-c
of the House oi Iti pie-entatixe.-j. ten thou-arid copies of
1 the letuni- oi tin: tfevimi Cen-n-; which, together u.tii
| the u-ual mmib-i-. made an aatrregaie ot about twenty
thou-and eopio. Th" woi k i- eompj i-cd in one Inrye
ito volume or elevn handled ami -i\'y p.if/e-, end was
punted by the public pnoter at a co-t. ineiudin^ paper and
binding, ol about two dollai- and ^ev« litv-tive eeat.-< per
• copy, oi thousand dollars for the whole number.
From its size and minute statistical details, the work is
more designed for jelerenee than popular u^e. It if, in
thcopmlon of the committee, better adapted tor the public
bhrane*, institution* of Iparriinjj, and learned sociene^of
the eountiv, than for general distribution. The number
already pulih^lied h more than suflicitnu to supply each
public binary, collect, learned society, and county in the
United State*?, with one copy, and will aflbid an excels of
several thousand for distribution to snch other public ni-
Mituuons and individuals as it may be desirable to supply.
In view of the-se fact-*, the committee see no reason why a
fuither edition ot so expensive a publication should be
issued, and tlieiefore decline recommending it.
They are, however, of the opinion that a woik embracing
all the material result? of the census, as shown bv the
volume already published, of smaller form, and suitable for
popular distribution, would prove highly acceptable and
u-e(ul to thatolass of rentiers who cannot neeessardy be '•up
idied with the lamer volume. A compendium, from which
would be excluded the most mmeces-aiy of tbe mmnie de-
tails and presenting only such comparative and aggieyate
tables a< would exhibit the important results, and be valu-
able and interesting to the general reader, may be pubh-hed
in loval octavo form, not exceeding at the utmost tour bun -
died p: £ es at compaiutively inconsiderable cost If the
woik should embrace as many as four hundred pages, the
eo<t, includuiir paper, and binding, will only be thirty seven
ami a half cents per copy; but, it i-. believed bv the com-
mittee, that the niattet they propose to republish will not
reach that number of pages ; and if s>o, the cost will be pro-
portionally diminished.
ror one tinid of tbo <um it has cost the Government to
publish twentv thousand copies of the large volume, may
be pubh-hed fiitv thousand copies of a compendium, .suita-
ble lor gencial th-ti ibmion, and pos.vCf>-i i,r to that cla-^s of
tlie people into whose hands it would fall, all the value of
the nunc compieheusne work A book like thj«, suited
to th > popufai u ant, of convenient -ize, and capable of

known to the connniliee h> winch can be secured th"

Mr. PERKINS, of Louisiana. Will the gentle-
man from Kentucky permit me to ofTei an amend-
ment before he proceeds with hi^ remarks ?
Mr. STANTON. I will hear the gentleman's
amendment.
Mr. PERKINS. I have a resolution which (
propose fo oH'er as an amendment. It is, in sub-
stance, that the Committee on Printing be author-
ized and insttucted to cause to he published the
statistics of industry a.uthoi i/.ed to be collet.ted in
the act foi taking the census, hut which has not
appeared in the volume published by order of
Con^rews
Mr. STANTON. I presume the gentleman':?
resolution i.s not in order as an amendment; and
if it were m ordei, I shouhl be compelled to ob-
ject to it for this reason: The statistics to which
the gentleman alludes, nre now, or will be, under
under consideration by the jomt Committee on
Psinline, from which a full report in due season
may he expected. This hems: a question of some
inteiesf, and several members havmjr manifested
sc<me anxiety in reference to the republication of
the larger volume, and three or four resolutions
upon the subject having been refened to us, we
thought proper to commit the Senate committee on
the subject and learn their views, that the action
of the two Houses might be umrotm. A joint
meeting was held, and both committees concurred
in the opinion that it was unnecessary to repub-
lish the large book, containing, as it did, a great
many detail^ uninteresting to the general reader,
and which would be useful only to learned gen-
. tiernen who micrht have occasion to consult it.
I Mr OLTNGVl AN. Before the gentleman from
; K'-fucky takes l.i<* seat, I would like to mqun e liow
i many copies of the Census Repoitin thedilTerent
! forms have already been published by older of
| Congress ? I believe 100,000 copies of a shot t ah-
1 stroct, published in the Congressional Globe, were
first published. After that, we published a great
many copies of another abstract. I merely want
to know,for information,how mnnv copies oi that
renort, in all the different forms, ha\e been pub-
lished >
Mr, STANTON. We published one hurdred
thousand copies of some of the tables which hail
appeared in the Congressional Globe, and which
cost the Government, I believe, only one cent a
