E. CASSERLY,
Managers on the part of the Senate.
Mr. BROOKS. That is a very long report,
and the amendments are numerous, aud it is
so long since we passed the bill that I almost
forget what are its provisions. I wish to ask
the chairman of the Post Office Committee, the
gentleman from Illinois, [Mr. Farnsworth,]
whether, under this revision of the law, it is
possible to send a letter across the river from
New York to Brooklyn, or from Washington
to Georgetown across Rock creek, without a
three-cent stamp upon it ?
Mr. FARNSWORTH. The Senate amend-
ment, which is agreed to by this conference
report, provides that in certain cases such as
those mentioned By the gentleman from New
York, where post offices are within three miles
of each other, and by inadvertence a two-cent
stamp, or anything less than the full rate is put
upon it, the letter shall be sent to its destina-
tion, and the remaining postage collected
there. I believe it is provided that double
the remaining postage shall be charged.
Mr. BROOKS. Heretofore, I understand,
such letters were not sent at all, and the post-
age on them was lost.
Mr. FARNSWORTH. Heretofore they
have been sent to the dead-letter office.
Mr. BROOKS. I should like to have read
the provision in the conference report relating
to that matter if the Clerk can find it con-
veniently.
Mr. FARNSWORTH. In a bill so long as
this it is impossible and unnecessary that I
should give an explanation of all the amend-
ments in detail; The Senate made a great
many amendments. Nearly all of them, how-
ever, or most of them, were merely verbal
changes, correcting the phraseology; there
were very few comparatively that affected the
substance of the bill. When they passed the
bill with their amendments the Senate at the
same time appointed a committee of confer-
ence and asked a conference on the part of
the House on those amendments; and when
the bill with that message from the Senate
came here, the House, without acting at all on
the amendments, ordered that a conference be
appointed.
Mr. DAWES. I did not think the gentle-
man from Illinois [Mr. Farnsworth] would
have done that without having the amendments
considered by the House.
Mr. FARNSWORTH. The gentleman from
Massachusetts [Mr. Dawes] did not object.
Mr. DAWES. But the wonder is that the
gentleman considered it consistent with his
duty to do this, even although objection was
not made.
Mr. FARNSWORTH. The action of the
House, in granting a committee of confer-
ence, without considering the amendments,
explains why it is that the committee recom-
mends concurrence in so many of the amend-
ments. If they had been considered in the
House, most of them, being merely verbal
amendments, would have been agreed to here.
It is proper that I should state to the House
that this conference created an additional
officer—I believe but one. Some additional
clerks have been provided for in the appro-
priation bills which have passed Congress this
session. In codifying the law those additional
clerks have been provided for. But the only
additional officer, so far as I am aware, who
is created by this bill, is an Assistant Attor-
ney General for the Post Office Department,
with a salary of $4,000. I mention this to
the House, that if any gentleman has any |
objection to it he may make that objection
now. At the same time it is proper that I
should state that it was the unanimous opin-
ion of the committee of conference that it
was necessary that the Department should
have a law officer. None has ever hitherto
been provided for that Department. There
is a law providing such an officer for every
other Department, I believe, save this one.
Under this very bill which codifies all the
postal laws down to the hour of its passage
a great many legal questions will arise, requir-
ing the careful examination and opinion of a
man learned in the law. The Postmaster
General has desired it. He has often asked
for it before, and the conference on the part
both of the Senate and of the House have
unanimously, I believe, agreed to it.
Mr. SARGENT. I heard the word " min-
eral " in the reading of the report, but have
not had time to trace its connection. I wish
to inquire of the chairman of the committee
whether any of the Senate amendments as-
sented to by us, if this report should be
adopted, will prevent the transportation of
coin in the mails, as is now done ?
Mr. FARNSWORTH. Not at all. There
is no such change. The Senate made no such
amendment.
The report of the committee of conference
was adopted.
Mr. FARNSWORTH moved to reconsider
the vote by which the report was adopted;
and also moved that the motion to reconsider
be laid 011 the table.
The latter motion was agreed to.
order oj business.
Mr. GARFIELD, of Ohio. I now insist
on my motion that the rules be suspended,
that the House proceed to the consideration
of business on the Speaker's table, and that
the debate be limited to five minutes for, and
five minutes against, on each bill.
Mr. HOLMAN. I desire to make a par-
liamentary inquiry. If the House should go
to the Speaker's table under a suspension of
the rules, could any bill on the table which
was reached be passed by a majority vote?
The SPEAKER. Certainly.
Mr. HOLMAN. I still trust the gentleman
from Ohio will adhere to his original propo-
sition to take up the bills 011 the Speaker's
table to which no objection is made.
Mr. GARFIELD, of Ohio. I am afraid
that if we take up only those to which no
objection is made nothing will be done. If
gentlemen 011 the other side of the House
desire to except two or three bills from the
operation of this motion, let them name the
bills and I will make my motion so as to
exclude those bills.
Mr. BINGHAM. I hope no bargain of that
sort will be made.
Mr. KERR. I hope the gentleman will
except the three political bills.
Mr. HOLMAN. And all bills making
grants to railroad corporations.
Mr. GARFIELD, of Ohio. For the sake
of getting at. the business on the Speaker's
table, which everybody wants to go at, I will
except from the operation of my motion the
three political bills to which gentlemen on the
other side object.
_Mr. STEVENSON. I hope the gentleman
will except land-grant bills also.
Mr. BINGHAM. I object to the motion
of my colleague from Ohio. As to the rail-
road land-grant bills I care nothing about
them, but 1 do care about what gentlemen on
the other side call political bills.
Mr. GARFIELD, of Ohio. I would like
to pass some of them myself, but I will make
my motion so as to except those three bills.
Mr. STEVENSON. Why does the gentle-
man discriminate against justice, and in favor
of robbery ?
Mr. BINGHAM. I rise toa point of order.
