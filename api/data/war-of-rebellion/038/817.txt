You see the necessity of assisting me in defending the Mobile and Ohio Railroad. I have to send all troops to General Bowen.

J. C. PEMBERTON.

MOBILE, May 2, 1863.

Lieutenant-General PEMBERTON:

I telegraphed you five days ago that all my infantry had been sent to Tennessee; and a few companies of cavalry and an artillery regiment are my only troops to cover Mobile. I will send most of my cavalry to aid Buford. Mobile is now exposed. Should an enemy appear, my orders are to look to you for re-enforcements. I am asking troops from Beauregard to guard this point and re-enforce Loring.

S. B. BUCKNER.

Vicksburg, May 2, 1863.

General BUFORD, Meridian:

Retain a regiment at Chunkey's Bridge. Urge the citizens to arm themselves.

J. C. PEMBERTON.

J. C. PEMBERTON.

MERIDIAN, May 2, 1863.

General PEMBERTON:

Have just received a dispatch from commanding officer of NINTH Arkansas, stating that he is ordered by General Ruggles to move down the road from Okolona, as the enemy were moving forward in overwhelming numbers. I must have re-enforcements. I have no artillery. General Buckner sends me 300 cavalry, the only disposable force at command. Have called on citizens to arm themselves.

A. BUFORD.

Vicksburg, May 2, 1863.

Brigadier General W. S. FEATHERSTON, Grenada, MISS.:

It is reported 4,000 of enemy camped at New Albany night before last. If you find they are proceeding south, you will immediately come to Canton. Telegraph me at once what information you have.

Vicksburg, May 2, 1863.
