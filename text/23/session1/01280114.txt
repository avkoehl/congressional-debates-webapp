THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
Jan. 17,
private wars' Does he call that a petty private
war which raged unceasingly for more than twenty
years, which called forth all the savage tribes from
Georgia to Canada' Yes, sir, bands united into
armies of painted warriors, counting thousands.
If that gentleman had been in Buchanan's station
when it was surrounded by more than seven hun-
dred Creeks and Shawnees, with only nineteen
men and a few resolute women to defend the fort,
I question whether it would have struck him as a
petty feud, or inglorious defence Sir,Tecumseh,
since the most celebrated wainor of the red men,
then but a boy, was there. This fact I learned
fiom the granddaughter of General Robinson, a
lady who unites the spirit of her ancestor with
taste and learning Why is it that the gentleman's
sympathies aie all with the red men' Sir, at that
time they were as a hundí ed to one when compared
with thewhites Theyusedtheirsupenorstrength
most barbarously, at all their camps were to be
seen stakes with human skeletons hanging around
«them—some small and short—infants which had
perished with then mothers The gentleman spoke
of íetaliation, did he ever hear of a white man's
torturing a female or infant Indian' If he has, I
beg the gentleman to set it down as false, cowards
and barbarians only are capable of misusing those
whom it is the duty of man to protect Sir, no
coward ever showed his face there He spoke of
retaliation, and seems to think it the duty of the
Government to discourage it as practised in the
West. Was not the gentleman in favor of priva-
teering during the late war' Did he not think it
right in his own State to fit out privateers of war
to capture merchant vessels, not that those ves-
sels had done them any wrong, but because their
nation was at war with ours' Yet the gentleman's
patriotic blood curdles in his veins at the thought
that a rude backwoodsman, with a cabin just suf-
ficient to shelter his family, and a poney to pack
in meat for their support, when robbed of all by
the harassing allies of a powerful nation at war
with his country, should retake his hoise 01 take
another, not by attacking a defenceless neutral,
but at the hazard of his lite. Retaliation, indeed'
How could Boon retaliate in 1776, when his
daughter and the Miss Calloways were carried
pnsoneis, by the savages, far, far into the deep
cane-tangled wilderness' What, catch and kill
an Indian girl1 Could Boon do that' No, no
more than he could give up his Gertrude—not of
Wyoming, but of Boonsborough. They must be
saved from the stake and flame1 He raised his
friends and resolutely followed on, he fought and
won a battle, and brought the trembling captives
home to their mothers He talked of pmate wars
and petty piracy The lives of a few soldiers were
prized at that day in the West, and when they fell
were greatly missed The West was weak, and
faint, and bleeding, and scarce of soldiers Let us
examine and see it those wars were so private as
the gentleman seems to think From 1783 to 1790
the loss of property was immense There were
killed and wounded and taken prisoners 1500 men,
women, and children This is the estimate made
of the loss in seven years of that war, which raged
with unceasing fury for more than twenty years
upon that harassed people, which the gentleman
may learn if he everieadsa book published on the
other side of the Aiiegliames
But, sn, as to the services performed by these
hunters At the most gloomy period of the Revo
lution, when, despair clouded the brow of the
patriot, and hundreds were flocking to the British
standard, giving up their liberty and their coun-
try's independence as gone foiever, when Corn-
waliis was in the centre, and Ferguson had taken
his position near the mountains in Carolina, en-
couraging the Tories and dispiriting the Whigs,
who drove that British general fiom his post',
Twas the hunteis of Wataga They pursued
him with the impetuosity of a mountain tonent
for thirty-six hours, stopping only one hour for
refreshmentat theCowpens At King's Mountain
they overtook the royal army, diawn up upon its
summit who climbed that steep and dragged down
the tyiant power, and by the bold exploit not only
ch°eied the drooping spirits of the Whigs and car-
ried terror to theTones, but made Coinwallis quail
and retreat' Sir, when that conflict began, the
mountain appealed volcanic, there Hashed along
its summit, and around Us base, and up us sides*
one light sulphureous blaze That [pointing to the
eagle and flag of the House] eagle's eye shone
bright in victory—that banner floated proudly out
Historians give this as the most patriotic and illus-
trious achievement of the Revolution And, sir,
need I tell that gentleman, who has at least noticed
Marshall's Historv, that it was achieved by the
hunters of the West, without the aid, or even the
knowledge of Government And upon that pioud
mount still let them stand' Who would drag them
do  a to the low estate of savages' Who would
tear one laurel from theirbrow' If yon can't spare
for those who live the means of living, be it so—
the West will feed her patriarchal soldiers, they
aie old and few, when they are gone, may their
mantles fall, to warm the patriot's bosom and nerve
the soldier's arm But you dare not reproach
them, their honor and patriotic worth are our
richest inheritance, and, sir, we will hug and de-
fend it as our country's honor Let the war-worn
soldier, when piessed to live, and disappointed in
his expectations here, look to the West—it is
what his country has done in the hour of her peril
and day of her distress

THE REMOVAL OF THE DEPOSITES.
Mr RIVES expressed the reluctance with which
he obtruded himself upon the attention of the Sen-
ate, as it better became him to be a listener than
a speaker But the importance of the question,
and the occasion, left him no other alternative
The subject was admitted to be of the highest mo-
ment, on account of the distress which prevailed
in the community, but which was much exagger-
ated by panic, and which, such as it was, he
hoped would be of transient existence And in
providing the remedy care should be taken not to
mistake the symptom for the disease He be-
lieved the disease more deeply seated than the gen-
tleman from Kentucky supposed, a disease which
would require the cautery and the knife to eradi-
cate But the distress came to him with the alle-
viating reflection that it would pass over with the
destiuction of its great cause In vain dul the
patriots of '91 warn us that the Bank of the Uni
ted States was most dangerous to the institutions
and Government of the country, in vain did the
voice of the gentleman from Kentucky, on aformer
occasion, warn us that the institution was danger-
ous to our liberties, if we were now to close our
eyes against itsconduct But he trusted gentlemen
would open their eyes to its character It was in
vain to say the panic was caused by the removal
of the deposites It could not be That was no
novelty It had been done before We had been
told by the bank that when the protested bill
came back from Fiance there was less than $2 000
of public money in the bank, and was not this in
effect a removal of the deposites' Yet there was
no piessureat thattime Some other cause, then,
must be found for it, and that had been assigned
by a gentleman in the other House, [Mr Bin-
ney ] He asci ibed it to the doctrine on which the
act was done, by which the people were to be sep-
arated from the bank, and it was said that the
people were so connected with the bank that the
separation could not be effected without inextri-
cably involving one and the other
Mr RIVES then briefly recapitulated state-
ments showing the annual operations of the bank,
the domestic exchanges amounting to two hundred
and foity one millions, the foreign to thirteen mil-
lions , w hich, added to the discounts and deposites,
make an aggregate of three hundred and forty-one
millions, the annual operations of the bank. Could
any one look at that exhibit without having a
seise of the danger of the institution to the coun-
try from the manner in which it had mixed itself
uo with the affairs of the country' It was impos-
sible but that it must exert an influence hostile to
the best interests of the country He conceived
the true danger and the real cause of its distress
to be in the existence of this institution, with its
overpowering monopoly What, then, was the
remedy ' Was it by increasing its means ' Could
any man fail to see that this would be the effect of
restoring the deposites' And how then could its
effects on the country be resis'ed when it wound
up i s concerns' It must cease to exist, and how
was the nation to get rid of this immense power
without producing a piessure upon the country '
Did gentlemen forget the non renewal of the char-
ter of the old United States Bank, and the report
of the Secretary of the Treasury to Congress, that
such wou'd be the consequence' It would be sin-
gular if any one could suppose we could get rid of
this msutu'ion without some distress and panic in
the community
But the gentleman from South Carolina said
the question was not bank or no bank, but wheth-
er there should be a league of State banks, sub-
ject to the absolute control of the Executive
Could he suppose that the State banks, under
the direction of the governments of the States,
totally unconnected with each other, could possi-
bly be made the instruments of an influence so
