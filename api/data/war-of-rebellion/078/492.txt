COMMANDING OFFICER,

Larkinsville:

Send couriers to Claysville with the following dispatch. Notify me by telegraph when they leave, and order them to remain there twenty-four hours, unless sooner sent back by the commanding officer:

Lieutenant John T. FISH,

Commanding at Claysville:

General Granger informs me that Wheeler was at Somerville to-day, moving toward Guntersville, and directs you to keep a good lookout, and if the enemy appears on the other side in any force, to send messengers with all speed to Larkinsville. In case of emergency I rely on your discretion to keep us fully advised and save your command.

PULASKI, September 27, 1864.

Colonel MORGAN:

Stop your troops where they are, and let them refresh themselves. Remain there until otherwise ordered, unless communication is cut between us. You will then move promptly to this place. The opinion is that the enemy has passed over to the other road. All trains with troops can be stopped where they reach you.
