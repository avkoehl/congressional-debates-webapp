A most unaccountable transformation into a mob of a finely-appointed and admirably-led army. Five regiments have been ordered to join you from Ohio. Brigadier-General Reynolds has been commissioned and ordered to report to you. Remain in your present command instead of going to the Valley of the Shenandoah.

ADJUTANT-GENERAL'S OFFICE,

Washington, D. C., July 22, 1861.

General GEORGE B. McCLELLAN, Beverly, Va.:

Circumstances make your presence here necessary. Charge Rosecrans or some other general with your present department and come hither without delay.

L. THOMAS,

Adjutant-General.

FAIRFAX STATION, July 22, 1861-12.15 a. m.

General SCOTT:

I have my own regiment, 700; Colonel Taylor's New Jersey, 825; Colonel Johnson's New Jersey, 550.

I have heard no firing so far as I can hear. Panic is unabated.

I have sent an aide to General McDowell two hours and a half since; he has not returned.

I will dispatch another, and inform you at once.

One has returned.

Consult engineers, and strengthen the garrisons of Forts Ellsworth, Runyon, and Albany. Similar instructions are given* in respect to Fort Corcoran.
