tne vi %s of the Senator the crelitor wou'd have
no chance of redress. !f his coll asue would ac-
cept a modification, and de'er the motion  o strike
out, he thought the aifiicul'y m git be obviated.
Ths modification was to insert "that on prior rea-
sonable notice, specifying; in writing that such
fraud or concealment," &s.
Mr HENDERSON accep'ed the modification,
and wi'hdrew the mi non to strike out.
Mr HUNTINGTON thought there was no ne-
cessity for the amendment. The court would pre-
vent any fraadulent bankrupts from participating
m the benefits of ihe b II, and it was therefore un-
nere-iary to embarrass it wt'h rules
The mi d fi an 11 was adopted
Mr NICHOLSON--aid, if no one else meant to
offer an amendment, he desired to offer one which
should go to include all kinds of bank=, whether
lnoorparated or not
Mr. BERRIEN suggested that the amendment
be «ent 10 the Chair
Mr NICHOLSON had not prepared it, not ex-
pecting tt-e bill tocóme up
Mr SMITH of Indiana, with a view to give
tim< for the preparation of amendments, would
move to go mto Executive session; which motion
was adopted.

operation of the eKi^tinet system and latei of duties on imports
upon tleminufietuime, ajucul mal and commercial interests
oí the country, and of prot unng ¡.enerallj such info mation -is
may be useful to Conoress in any revision of the revenue laws
which may be attempted at the next session
The moining hoiu was devoted to Hie consideration of this
resolution
Mr (.1LMER a'lre-'-ed the Hotse in remaik* of great
Ien  h in «hiohhethiew out the suspicion lhat these inquines
were design das piepaiatory ti the imposition of a tar ft for
protection if thp infot mation was needed for a revisit n of the
tanff at the regular seioion, it wai no less i ee leed before pass
mgthe levenue bi 1 which had been reponed at the pre ent sei
sion by the Committee of Ways and Means He wa- ready for
a tariff which should be for revenue alone and which should
conform to the punciplesof the compromise act, but utterly
against any tariff for protection
Mi G concluded by moving that the furthei on&idenitionof
the suotect be postpo led ur til Monday week
And theq íes i n bem° on the postponement—

Mi 1JROWN said he had consented that the leport should be

ever met without irtpndm  by that consent to intimate what
would be hh final vote on theie olut i,n that would dependup
on the position lit v, htch l stood when he came to vote upoi it
Hewasln fivir of inquiry and tho ightthat we ought ti I ave
all the factsb-fore us we coull set before we revised the tariff He
ha 1 been opposed to the old tariff sy tem, and was oj poced alike
to the new free ti ad system or indiscriminate* duties but was
for laying =o much duties as would be necessaiy to support the
Governmeo on such articles as would best promote American
interests He would hold out to all the nations of the earth lu
ducementsfnr frcp ttadp but so far as it componed with the m
teiestsof the Ameiican peop'e he wouldlmpoi-e tilines on the
artirlps received from anyeountij that imposed a duty on the
artice  they received from Us The free trade he deelted was
one that would be mutual and not one free on one «ice only
Mr B went on at con«ldei able length to show the tfftctof du
ties on the general interests of the country, and on Pennsylva
main partirnlai and the advantage that would arise from a
full statement of fac's in relation to the efloct of the tariffs
heretofore laid on the nen tat interests oí the country If it
was in ende 1 to get a partial report to favor any particular m
erest, he woull eertamly oppose it
The morning hour having expired, a motion was made by
Mr  HLLMORE that the Hourse resolve itself into Commit
lee of the Whole on the state of the Union, for the purpoo*
of taking up tbeievemie bill
Mr r said he had mads this motion merely as a matter
°t form, and expíame 1 that, owing to the absence of a certain
document not yet lumtrhed, the committee might not be in
possession ol all the infoi m ition which was desirable
fío the motion was not pressed
And the House lebumed the consideration of the report aiaa
resolution above stated
Mr W C JOilN-sON submitted a few remarks in favor 0
the resolution—suegesung at the outset of his remaika th 
only diihct 1 y which, he «aid, presented itself to his mind,
and that was" one of lime Did the gentleman who reported
this lesolntinn till Vvinthrop] think that the requisitemfor
mation could be acquued in time tobe ol use in the action of
the House at the nextses&ion of Congressl
Mr WINTHKOP was undeistood to say that the question
was lather a difficult one to answer and one which, to answer
siti-'factoiily, would íequire mote time than was allowed him.
lie did not suppose that the thiee months *• hich would elapse,
before the athournmei and the meamg of Congress in De.
cuiioer would be s fhcient to enai «tne committee to pro*
cuie all the info! mation which mi^ht be desired, but still if.
would be wfllto make trobest useofthe time that we had, and
II obtain such a deyee of useful information as was practica-
ble
Mr W C JOHNSON beliemi that all that was wanted was
information—facts, and for that purpose he was ready to vote
in favor of this lesolution It was for the want ot reliable
(acts upon which to lound his judgment that he was most per
plexei He wasnotveiy ultia on this question, he said, but
declared himsell favorable to such a system of revenue ae
would be ad-qnate to all the proper and legitimate wants of
the Government
