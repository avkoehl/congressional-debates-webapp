HEADQUARTERS EIGHTEENTH ARMY CORPS, June 15, 1864-1.30 p.m.

General BUTLER:

The fight at Baylor's house broke up my arrangements, so that I have not been able to straighten my line; but this, however, will be done at once. Have the cars I have heard all day been bringing re-enforcements? There are some Georgia troops in my front.

W. F. SMITH,Major-General.

JUNE 15, 1864-7.20 p.m.

General SMITH:

I grieve for the delays. Time is the essence of this movement. I doubt not the delays were necessary, but now push and get the Appomattox between you and Lee. Nothing has passed down the railroad to harm you yet.

BENJ. F. BUTLER,

Major-General, Commanding.

JUNE 15, 1864-9 p.m.

General BUTLER:

I must have the Army of the Potomac re-enforcements immediately.

SMITH,

General.

Hancock has been ordered up by General Grant's and my orders. Another army corps will reach you by 10 a.m. to-morrow. It is crossing. They have not got 10,000 men down yet. Push on to the Appomattox.

B. F. BUTLER,

Major-General, Commanding.

GENERAL BUTLER'S HEADQUARTERS, [June 15, 1864]-9.40.

Did you make the attack contemplated? What was the result? Please answer by telegram.

BENJ. F. BUTLER,

Major-General.

JUNE 15, 1864-12 midnight.

General BUTLER:

It is impossible for me to go farther to-night, but, unless I misapprehend the topography, I hold the key to Petersburg. General Hancock not yet up. General Ames not here. General Brooks has three batteries, General Martindale one, and General Hinks ten light guns.

W. F. SMITH,

Major-General.
