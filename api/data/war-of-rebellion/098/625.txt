and crossing pontoon on Neuse River at Cox's Bridge moved down the north bank to within six miles of the town and encamped. March 24, we entered Goldsborough, and marching through the principal streets passed in review before General Sherman, and moving out two miles and a half went into camp near Scottsville, a station an Wilmington and Weldon Railroad. At this place, acting upon the cheering intelligence that our campaign is successfully ended, we have arranged a comfortable camp and are now prepared to rest and refit.

From the time of leaving Sister's Ferry until it arrived at Goldsborough the regiment drew the following Government rations only, viz: Six and a half days' rations hard bread, nine days' rations coffee, and five days' rations of sugar; all the rest of its subsistence it gathered from the country through which it passed, by means of a regular organized foraging party sent out daily in charge of an officer. When passing through a rich and cultivated region great quantities of provision were readily obtained; at other times, especially in Lexington District, S. C., and in the most part of North Carolina through which we passed, the country being thinly settled, uncultivated, and poor, great exertions were necessary to procure sufficient supplies to keep the command from suffering. A detail on foot was first employed, but this soon proving inefficient on account of the distance to be traveled and the competition of so many xington Court-House ten men were mounted on horses taken from the neighborhood, and this number was afterward increased to thirty men, at which point it was maintained, this force being found to be amply sufficient to supply abundantly the whole command. This party, starting each morning at daylight, under command alternately of Lieutenants Rogers and Hall, galloped over the country from plantation to plantation, often traveling fifty miles, and returning to the regiment at night loaded with all manner of provisions. Parties of the enemy's cavalry were frequently met by them; and when few, driven, when too strong, avoided. Meat was at all times abundant, large quantities of fine hams and bacon being often found buried. Flour and breadstuffs was more difficult and frequently impossible to obtain. At such times the party would gather a quantity of corn, and hunting up a mill on some one of the numerous streams that lay along our route, put it in operation and grind several days' supply while our route, put it in operation and grind several days' supply while our column was passing.

The negroes of the country were always friendly and often rendered great assistance. A large number followed the regiment to Fayetteville and this place.
