SIR: New York regiments are going home because their time is out-two were ordered by General Smith, after consultation with General Meade, by way of Frederick. Those in my command are marching to Shippensburg, thence by rail. The [order] can still be countermanded, if desired.

WAR DEPARTMENT,

Washington, July 15, 1863-11. 45 p. m.

Honorable THURLOW WEED.

Astor House, New York:

SIR: We have this evening official report by General Banks of the unconditional surrender of Port Hudson. The agreement for surrender was made on the 8th, and possession taken on the 9th. Prisoners estimated at 12, 000. Four great victories-Gettysburg, Helena, Vicksburg, Port Hudson-in eight days. We have taken over 55, 000 prisoners, and the rebel loss in killed, wounded, and prisoners is about 84, 000 men. Every rebel army has been captured or is in flight; every rebel stronghold is beleaguered. Gillmore`s official report, received to-night, shows thus far unexpected success against Charleston, and Banks` dispatches come by the Mississippi, now free to New Orleans. Our success within so brief a period since the first of this month is unexampled in military history. The rebel disasters are greater than ever befell a belligerent-the command of the Mississippi! Has New York no sympathy for these achievements won by the valor of her own sons? Shall their glory be dimmed by the bloody riots of a street mob?

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.
