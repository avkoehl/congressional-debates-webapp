JEFFERSON CITY, October 6, 1864.

Colonel J. V. DU BOIS:

The enemy are crossing the Osage above and below Castle Rock. Our advance is skirmishing with them.

E. B. BROWN,

Brigadier-General.

SAINT LOUIS, MO., October 6, 1864- 3 p. m.

Brigadier General E. B. BROWN,

Jefferson City;

Tell you raw men not to shame the Union cause by doing less than was done by Fletcher's men at Pilot Knob. There 1,000 whipped Price's whole fore, except Shelby, killing and wounding about 1,000. They then marched upward of eighty miles, pursued and attacked by Shelby and Marmaduke, whom they beat off. If they will only keep cool, let the enemy come within deadly range, and then fire low, you will cover the enemy wit blood and confusion and secure to yourselves safety and glory.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.

JEFFERSON CITY, October 6, 1864- 3.20 p. m.

Major-General ROSECRANS:

Do you intend that Brigadier- General Fisk shall relieve men from his command!

E. B. BROWN,

Brigadier-General.

SAINT LOUIS, MO., October 6, 1864- 9.30 p. m.

Brigadier-General BROWN:

The senior officer must assume command always. The general commanding does not doubt that perfect harmony will always prevail. Each general will command his own troops, but the senior commands all. If the enemy assault you you can hurt him more than in [any] other way. Tell Thurber to do me credit.

J. V . DU BOIS,

Colonel, &amp;c.

SAINT LOUIS, MO., October 6, 1864- 12 p. m.

General Brown:

Be as economical as you can with ammunition. W may not be able to communicate with you long. Be particularly careful of your artillery ammunition. Everything is satisfactory. I am afraid to use the cipher since you lost the kay.

J. V. DU BOIS,

Colonel and Chief of Staff.
