35th Cqvo""2nd Sess.__________                     The late duel—Mr Elmore.                                                                       H. of Réps.
consolation that flows from the conscientious dis-
charge of his duty to his country, and no gentleman
can discharge his duty who, in the present condi-
tion of our finances, will vote for unnecessary ap-
propriations. No one need implicate himself upon
the constitutional question of appropriations by the
General Government for objects of internal im-
provement, by voting for the motion to recommit
the bill, with the proposed instructions. The con-
dition of the Treasury is surely more than a suffi-
cient excuse
In 1830, when General Jackson placed his veto
on the Maysville road bill, it was said in this hall
that he had raised to his memory a more imperish-
able monument than when he won the glorious
victor) that preserved tae queen of our Southern
cities from the pollution of a conquering foe, and,
with her safety, the honor of the country And
yet, if he was not mistaken, he heard an honorable
gentleman irom Virginia [Mr. Mercer] congra-
tulate the House a few dajs since that more exten-
sive appiopnations by the Government for objects
of internal improvement had been made since that
time than during any other equal period in our
history '    Let gentlemen look to this.
As he had before remarked, Mr C. did not in-
tend to discuss the constitutional po« er of Congress
to make appropriations tor objects of internal im-
provement, turther than to say that the great va-
riety of opinion that existed in relation to it should,
if there were no other objection, make gentlemen
hesiiate to pass this bill Leaving, however, the
subject of constitutionality out of the question, it
must be admitted that appropriations by the Gene-
ral Government for objects of internal improve-
ment are partial in their operation, tending to the
beneht of particular sections at the expense of the
whole, and therefoie inconsistent with that equality
upon which our institutions are founded. To re-
move this objection—to make appropriations suffi-
ciently extensive to embrace every section of the
country having, or claiming to have, objects wor-
thy of Governmental patronage, would create a
vortex ©t expenditure that would engulf the dia-
monds of Golconda and the gold of Peru—
would require a revenue, the collection of which
would produce a wide spread rum, and, after ex-
hausting the resources of me country, would be
msuificient to accoiripl sh the object
To advocate app opri<,aons for the Cui"ieiland
road, upon the giouud that it will enhance the
value of the public lands in. those States through
which itpasses, is almost equally inadmissible foi
the same argument will apply in favor of the con-
struction oí roads into every wilderness where the
Government owns land Who can suppose that
the opening ot loads by the Government is neces
sary to attract the farmer to the virgin soil ot the
West"! Who has not observed the t>de of emigra-
tion, sweeping in its progress the p~pu!ation ot tne
old States, to this land of promise' Tiie tempta-
tions ate already strong enough in induce thousands
to bieak thiough those local attachments, ong'iia-
tmg in childhood, increased by the associations of
their maturer 3 ears, -'growing with our growth, and
strengthening with our strength," until at last the>
entwine themselves abound ¡he affections w.th a
power that nothing but that lo>e of wealth that
springs eternal in the human breast could sevei A
human tide has for \ eais been pouring into the nt w
States and Terntcues with a rapidity unequal! >d
m the annals of the world, since, perhaps, those
immense migrations recorded n irstoiy, w hen whole
tribes of barbarians pouied in upon and settled the
territories of their less wailike neighbors, some-
times bringing with them their own institutions,
sometimes adopt ng tiose oi the conquered race
Whole distucts of countrj m the old ¿tales have
declined in population, attracted fiom a «oil that m
an) other coun.ry would be cons r'ered as j lelamg
abouatiful rewaid to the cultivator, to encounter
the hardship  and piivatioas preparator) to con-
verting the wilderness into a garden Can any one,
with these facts before us, contend that additional
inducements to emigration are even, des rab'e?
Our western brethren labor under no peculiar
disadvantages in relation to the means of inter-
communication They hold constant mtercouise
with the rest of the world, not by those majestic
rivers only which, uniting their waters in the Mis-
sissippi, together pay tribute to the Gulf of Mexico,
bu' by numerous other channels of communica-
tion which owe their existence to individual and
State enterprise
He hoped the motion to recommit would succeed
now was the time by its adoption to relieve cur-
sives of a work whose constitutionality is doubt-
ful, whose benefit is partial, and appropriations for
continuing which, m the present sondition of the
Treasury, must bring oa u* the reproach of reck-
less extravagance. Let us surrender it to the
States through which it passes, it worthy of patro-
nage, it will be continued under their auspices,
sanctioned by the enlightened liberality of their
citizens, and paid for by those who enjoy the ad-
vantage.
If an additional argument was necessary to show
that the General Government should abandon, not
omy th'S, but all other objects of internal improve-
ment not immediately connected with the fore'gn
commerce or military defences of the country, that
argument could be found in the large surplus
recently deposited with or paid to the States.

REMARKS OF MR ELMORE,
Of South Cakoun ,
In the House of Representatives, Jipnl 24. 1838—The
Hoase having resumed the consideration of the
motion of Mr TouctT, made under the unani-
mous direction of the committee appointed to
investigate the causes which led to the death of
the late Mr Cillft, to print the report of that
committee, and postpone it all next Monday
weeV—
Mr ELMORE of Sout i Carolina addressed the
House as follows
Mi Spfaker Tne debate which has arisen on
tne repott in this case was unexpected to me It
began on Saturday, by a censure on the committee
by the gentleman from Virginia, [Mr Robertson,}
wno objected to the printing of the reports and pro-
ceedings of the committee, and censured the com-
mittee for having transcended their powers The
precise extent or manner m which the committee
had gone beyond their powers was not stated
[Mr Robertson disclaimed any opinion that the
committee had intentionally tianscenued their pow-
ers, they were irregular He did not censure them
m any other sense than that they had merely tran-
scended ]
Mr E. had understood the gentleman as acquit-
ting the committee of any intentional violation of
duty—ascensuiing them f>chmc?llv, not morallj.
The gen 'email from Virgin a did no', when he
spoke on Saturday, define the grounds on which h°
censured the conduct of the committee, but had
subsequent!} been more explic t, and inore limited
Other gentlemen had ¡oHo.ved trom various parts
of the Hoase, and "«sumed much the same posi-
tions, enlarging oa th m, and eiunding their re-
main-, indiscriminate} on "11 the«e points of objee
lion to the whole committee. It is not a little
lemaikable, sir, that no investigating; committee
h"s been appointed b> this House, in late jcais,
without itsell becoming the subject of attack the
instant it comes to report the discharge of the dutj
imposed on it by the House I do not complain ot
th's, >t may be a1! right, and the House may be fully
sensible of the justice and piopnet of thus repay-
ing the set vices of their comm ttee Bat, mi, what
I do complain of is, thnt Jus c "isure snoti'd be in-
discriminate, and upon gpiieiahties, and not that
meiei), but genera'.ues groamg out oi a s'at> Oi
things imagined b> so ne gentlemen to h->*.e ev-
is'ed, and taken for gran.ed by others -<p in no bet
tei foundation than this vague ia""} Tie cen-
sures ot those who have t.ius t 'amea he c mmi'tee
as having uanscended t¡vrauthcnt>,do su without
hmng read their reports, the ewience, or their
journal, and upon the rrroneous assu upturn that
tilt committee examined witnesses without autho-
n<), implicated members, and put men. on ihe r
trial without the peun ssion oí the Hi use) and re-
ported resolutions for ihtu punishmem This
mode of ídenti'jing'tht majonty aud ininout} in
an indisorimiaate censure for all the proceedings of
the committee, where they agreed as well as where
they disagreed, piaees me in the awkward position
of receiving reproof, although differing from the
majority in that part of their proceedings which
seems to create the greatest dissatisfaction, and to
have called oat the strongest reproof. As; the
House had not ordered the papers laid on yotir ta-
ble by the committee to be read, I did not feel at
liberty, m the few remarks I made yesterday, to go
into particulars which would explain the fact an-
nounced m general terms, when I presented a pa-
per to the House on the coming in of the report of
the majority, stating my dissent from that report. I
trust I may be indulged by the House, under these
circumstances, in gomg somewhat farther into de-
tail than will be strictly regular, as, under the ac-
tion of the House, all the papers which would give
the proper explanations of the part and opinions I
have sus'amed are kept upon your table and from
the knowledge of the House, and I can in no other
way make my position known
I do not feel mj self called upon to vindicate any
part of the conduct of this committee beyond that
point to which it had my concurrence. There was
a point to which all agreed, and beyond that, there
was such difference of opinion, as each division of
the committee has indicated in. the reports upon
your table. I feel myself called on to defend no-
thing beyond what had my assent. The majority
must take care of its own conduct, andaré, I pre-
sume, prepared to do so to the best of their ability,
and to them I leave that task
It is objected that the conduct of the committee
was irregular, unparliamentary, because they pro-
ceeded to examine witnesses, by wh.eh members
proved to be implicated, and then proceeded to try
them, without permission of the House or hearing
the parties implicated, making it an ear parte pro-
ceeding
If it was irregular and unparliamentary to ex-
amine witnesses m this investiga1 ion, and report
the facts proved by them, then the House alone is
responsible for it, as, by its resolutiens of the 23th
February, this committee was expressly ordered
"to inquire into the causes that led to the death of
Mr. Cillet, and the circumstances connected
therewith." But xt is said that the committee
should not have proceeded after "a member proved
to be involved," without reporting to the House,
and having its order to proceed, because the privi-
leges of the House and the member would be vio-
lated by doing so A role laid do  n m the Maauat
of Mr. Jefferson is ths authority relied on for this
that rule is as follows.
"W hen a committee is charged with an inquiry, if a raem
ber prove to be involved, tl ey cannot pioceed against hint, but
must make a special report to the House, whereupon tlie
membei is heard in his place or at the bar, or aspecial autho
my is siten to the committee te mqune concerning h'm *
The Manual refers to 9 Giey's Debates of Par-
liament, for the case establishing this point of Par-
liamentarj law. It is coatended that this is the
law of this House, adopted by the lldth rule. Sir,
the question is not whether this is the law of the
House, for of (licit there is no doubt, bat what ts the
meaning of thai law'1 How are you to construe if?
Are you to put an arbitrary interpretation oa ¡t,
or, bv referring to the case out of which it sprung,
to ga>her its true meaning and intent"* Can any
man donb' that it was adopted only m that sense,
wh'ch every just and reasonable rule ot interpreta-
tion gives it m the 1 ook from which vou take if*
Well, sir, before we aoply that test to it, let us ask
what is that interpretation which we would mon
naturally put upon it* It is this, bir that it a
committee, charged with some inquiry of anothei
cnaracter, finds a member implicated, say m a
traud, as m ihe case oi R'dge, 2 Hat Free. 257,"
they shall not proceed against hira till tneyTiave
mlorrned the House and had instructions, tor this
obvious reasm, that thr House never allows lis
privileges o be acted on wiihoutauthority from it-
be í to take cognizance ot its privileges, a case en-
tirely diSerent from the present, as I will show pre
stntlv \nd, sir, ra exact accordance with this con-
struction are the tacis in the case from 9th GfevS
