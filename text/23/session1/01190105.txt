paid, whi'e those of another do not receive a soli
tary cent Nor can he see either the propriety or
justice of abolishing or repealing the pension law ,
as suggested in the amendment of his colleague
fromVirginia The law will, in the lapse of time,
repeal itself by the deaths of the soldiers pen-
sioned, many of whom are now on the verge of
eternity, and many having aheady passed the
bounds of time There is, therefore, a reduction
of at least twenty per cent on the original grants,
and a further reduction may still be expected,
few, if any, of the pensioners being under seventy
years of age. Why, then, gravely deliberate on
the repeal of laws which have their own period of
existence assigned them in the lives of veterans'
It is true that many soldiers are patriots, and
from their love of country and opinions of civil
and religious liberty would enter into the military
service m case of absolute necessity Yet, where
is the soldier devoid of the hope of remuneration,
who will cortinue in the forces of his country to
figftt her battles, if his objects of reward are thus
frustrated by prohibiting all ideas of th's hope'
Take it away, and the musket will fall nerveless
from his grasp, the bayonet will fall pointless, and
few will ardently oppose the enemy If troubles
originate again the soldier will find that he can
obtain nothing but empty honors, and who will
covet honors that will but beggar him' He will
point to the resolution of the House that the
Government will take no care of him, that his
father had fought at periods of our revolutionary
history, and had his petition for assistance in his
old age shghted, rejected, and this at a time when
the funds of the Treasury weie locked up, when
(like the river Nile) it oveiflowed 4s banks, and
was hoarded as a sinking fund to make Presidents
out of.
He sees no difference between the soldiers who
fought at a time when their fight was equivalent
to treason, and their punishment death by hanging,
and thosevvho foughtwith the Indians, when then
deaths would be by the scalping knife or toma-
hawk. He thinks none have such an aversion to
being hung as voluntarily to enrank themselves
among the opponents of the Indians by whom
they will have their heads skinned, their brains
knocked out, and then subjected to enduring ex-
cruciation till death becomes aiehef Those who
fought against the Indians in the West were sub
jected to equal privations and difficulties as the
pensioners who fought in the Revolution They
had volunteered their sei vices in defence of their
country, had spent for her the energies of their
youth—and are their claims to be rejected now
that the frosts of seventy years have rendered
them wretched and helpless'
Mr SPEIGHT thought that some teim of ser-
vice should be ascerta'ned whereby a soldiei
should be entitled to the provision of the pension
system This should be regulated by a commit
tee rather than have abrogated the whole laws
It would prevent the con upturn insinuated in the
amendment
Mr DICKINSON, of Tennessee, said, I hope
the House wnl not think me intrusive in offering
a few remaiks upon this question A small íem-
nant of a race of men now nearly extinct yet lin-
gers in the section of country fiom which I come,
and if others who have never seen them, and who
have never heaid from their own lips the stoiy of
the privations and perils through which the,reaily
life was past, may be permitted to speak doubt
mgly or slightly of their claims upon the gratitude
of then country, I, who have both seen them and
heaid them, cannot be silent
A militiaman of the revolutionary war, who was
in camp or upon a march foi the penod of six
months, receives a pension from the bounty of the
Government. Sn,the first settleis of the West
may be said to have passed fifteen or twenty years
in a cam] , or upon the scout,or in battle Every
private dwelling, every piece of enc'osed grout d,
was an encampment, a id so contirued for nearly
a third of the oidinary penod of the life of man
Sir, the fields were cultivated ai periods of t.me
snatched from the pursuit of an enemy, and then
under sentinel guaids But how often did it hap-
pen in the h,stoiy of the se'tlement of the western
country that the cultivatoi wa- shot down in the
furrow his plough had made' Su, m many of our
fields may th  spot be pointed out whivh d>snk
toe blood thus shed of the primest stock that ever
trod its surface Aye, the primest, in the true
and natural sense of tne woid Por who shall
stand in a higher rank, ev en among the benefactors
of mankind, than that hardy, brave, and devoted
class of men who plunged into the wilderness, a
handfui in numbers only, drove out the savages
after a twenty years' war, and gave to the people
of the eastern States—to the people of the world,
I may say—at the end of tnat time a safe and
peaceful entry into such a region as the valley of
the Mississippi' Whether we look at the perils
encountered and oveicome, the value and magnifi-
cence of the object achieved, or the actual suffer-
ings endured, it has no parallel in history, that I
know of, save only the first planting of this conti-
nent itself by the adventurers from Europe But
even this great enterprise was not attended with
more real suffering
It has been said during the debate upon this res-
olution, that the practice of pensioning h*as not
gone beyond the Revolution, and that it would be a
dangerous precedent to extend the system this side
of that period I suppose, sir—for I have not heard
it stated in debate—that it was thought by our pre-
decessors that the precedent of granting pensions
to persons who rendered services to the country
during the Revolution could not be drawn into
precedent, and very plausibly, too, for I agree that
the war of the Revolution and of Independence can
never occur again any more than it can happen to
man to be twice born But I will go furthei, and
agree that no military service evei has done, or
evercan do so much for liberty—for human rights
and human happiness, as the military service of the
Revolution I agi ee that none can be more glorious,
both to those who achieved it, and to those, their
descendants, who enjoy the prize But, sir, what
argument is there in all this against the proposition
now befoie the House' Togo back to the founda-
tion of this claim of some of the sui vivmg pioneers
of the West to receive a pension, they were in rea-
son and truth soldiers of the Revolution, though
never so long as six months upon any one tour of
service which was recognized by the public author-
ities of the countiy as belonging to any regular
national foice. But,sir,fiomthe veiy commence-
ment of theievolutionary war, and fiomthatperiod
onwards to its close, some of the early settlers stood
firmly upon the western frontier, or deep in the for-
est far beyond the general line of frontier settle-
ments, breasted the savage charge, and often broke
its fury before it reached the regular frontier settle-
ments They furnished employment, and furnished
victims, too, to the savage knife and tomahawk,
nearer to their haunts than the more dense settle-
ments of the inteiioi Such men as these const 
tuted a wall of defence throughout the whole period
of the Revolution, which was of immense service, I
though ¡t was not always sufficient, for want oí
11 the common muni'ions of war, to resist or drive
back the numerous hoi des of savages who pressel
heavily upon the western fron'ier during the war
I call upon gentlemen to say what principle, oi
reason, or sound policy forbids that these men
shouiu share the bounty and the honors of the Re-
public with the regular soldier of the Revolution .
Sir, they who shared the perils and dangers of tne
Republic should share us bounty, too I plead
the cause of a class of men who, with the mosf
scanty means, almost without powder and 1'ad,.
resisted the Indians for a period moie than twre I
as long as the Revolution lasted What men of
I the Revolution risked more or suffered more se-
' verely than these' There is no regulai history of
I the exploits and suffeiings of these brave men,
their stoiy is only to be fourd in their own ie^ol
lection, or m that of then children and countiy men, i
with whom it is tiaditionary But many memo
na's of their actions and their fate are scattered
over the State that I have the honor in part to
' repiesent upon tins fiooi A mountain has given
immortality to the name of the brave Spencer of
tl e Yadkin TheBkck Pox's Camp is associa ed
1 with the name of John Peyton and o'hers, who
signalized themselves against an Indian chief of
that name and his party—a valoi and enteipnse |
suipassed by few wamors of any age This
cla^s of worth es are represented by but few surviv-
oii, they aie rapidly pessmg away Vv.ry soon
and not one of them wnl íemain, and if there was
bat one survivor on'y, I would vote to cheer Uis
declining life and rouse his drooping spirits by the
peneious notice and bounty of the Government
The largest class of those men who periled every-
thing in the early settlement of (he western coun-
try (and they are now but afeeble band) are those
who emigrated about the close of the revolutionary
war Many of them had been soldiers in that war,
and after having established with their swords the
liberty and independence of the country, sought
in the wilderness and in the midst of savage hos-
tility the means of personal independence for them-
selves and their posterity. 1 hose of this class
that remain are already provided for, and I have
nothing further to say of them than to express
my gratitude for their noble daring, and a fervent
desire that they may enjoy a protracted and happy
old age But, sir, with the soldiers of the Revo-
lution there went to the West many more—their
filends and kmdied, just grown up, and who gave
all the vigor of their manhood, and too many of
them their lives, to the defence of the early settle-
ments in the West. The Indian hostilities, com-
mencing with the revolutionary war, never ceased
upon the western frontier foi ten or twelve years
after the Revolution ceased It was rot until 1795
that the Indian wars growing out of the revolu-
tionary struggle closed It lasted more than twice
as long as the revolutionai y war, and was waged
throughout that time, on the part of the Indians,
upon women and infants in the cradle, on the part
of the settlers, by a courage, hardihood, and per-
severing fortitude, beyond any example to be
found in the Revolution proper Sn, so long, so
fteice, and indiscriminate was the war, that the
very brute creation sympathized with man in his
fears and sufferings, and learned to snuff the ap-
proach of the Indian, and give the alarm Such
is a well attested fact in that country Sir, who
here does not sympathize with the survivors of
such a war-bied race' Who would not cheer
them with the bounty of the Goveinment equally
with the soldier of the Revolution himself
I know that we ought tó act here upon other
punciples than those of mere sympathy and feel-
ing Policy and State expediency must be con-
sulted Well, sir, let us examine for a moment
the objection that it is a most dangerous prece-
dent Bnngthecaseof these men to the same test
that was applied to the men of the Revolution.
When again will it happen in the history of this
country that such a valley as that of the Missis-
sippi will be thrown open to the safe and comfort-
able dwelling of man by an enteipnse so daring'
There is no such country remaining upon the globe
to be íescued from the dominion of savages, that
we know of, and as for the race of men who
achieved that gieat object, I do not know that it
will ever be renewed. It is just as possible that
the revolutionary war can occur again, and bring
with it its public debt, as that the conquest of the
va'l y of the Mississippi can evr be leaded The
pensioning of the sat vivors of the first settlers and
wamors of the West ill danger of being drawn
into precedent' Who can seriously indulge in
such a fear' Sn , this country m ly have many
wars, the late war may often be renewed in type
ana effect in the future history of this country.
But the fifteen or twenty years' war waged by
the early sekleis of the West against its savage
inhabitants can never be acted over again.
An argument .vas suggested by the gentleman
fiom Ivcntu ky [Mi IIii>dik] when this subject
was before the House which I thought had great
foice in it This protiacted Indian war was buta
continuation of the revolutionary war, and the
claims of these men to receive a pe-ision should
be placed upon the same giound with the soldiers
who rendeied services to the country during the
filst six or seven yeais of the Revolution If I
have read the histuiy of tint period aright Great
Bn an did not relinquish the idea of hrm mg the
boundary of the United States in the West and
noithwast by the Ohio river until Ihe treaty of
1795, when she finally agreed to deliver up the posts
withntne 'units of the ter-itiry ceded to the Uni-
ted Stites by the treaty of 17S3 The Spaniards,
soon after the treaty of 17^3, adopted (he policy
of limiting the new Repullic in the southwest
