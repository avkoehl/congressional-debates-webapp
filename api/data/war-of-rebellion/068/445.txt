enemy leave you undisturbed, I would let the men rest till 6 p.m., at which time a vigorous attack made by you, in conjunction with Burnside, will, I think, overthrow the enemy. I wish this done.

Yours,

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.

I send you a dispatch just received from Burnside. Help him if you can.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND CORPS.

Major-General MEADE,Headquarters Army of the Potomac:

GENERAL: The present partially disorganized condition of this command renders it extremely difficult to obtain a sufficiently reliable body to make a really powerful attack. I will, however, do my best and make an attack at that hour in conjunction with General Burnside. What development of the attack do you desire? Will you indicate a front?

Your obedient servant,

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General, Commanding.

Brigadier General S. WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

GENERAL: I find the enemy or accident has set fire to the woods on my left front. I will examine how far it extends. I will assist Burnside, in case he attacks, in some shape, at 6 o'clock, anywhere. Where the woods are burning the troops could not go in. I have no connection with General Burnside as yet.

WINF'D S. HANCOCK.

Major-General MEADE,

Headquarters Army of the Potomac:

GENERAL: I cannot get to General Hancock and am on the cross-road. General Stevenson says he has had no orders to move down to General Hancock. He is on the plank road close to the head of the cross-road. I hear musketry as if Burnside were attacking, but not heavy.
