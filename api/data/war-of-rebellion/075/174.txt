HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,May 14, 1864-12 m.

General THOMAS:

I am very anxious for the left flank of your line to be pushed across to the railroad. If the enemy hold all the line of Camp Creek, they could be occupied, and a force sent around the head or smaller spur of Camp Creek. Howard is, I suppose, quite down to Tilton and the line of Swamp Creek. I will order Stoneman to make a complete raid around the enemy from Holly Creek Post-Officer, by Old Town and Adairsville, to the Oostenaula below, as soon as we have a good lodgment across Lay's Ferry. But we should also completely invest Johnston on the north. Please act accordingly. Schofield will follow the movements of north left wing, and Howard and Colonel McCook are subject to your orders.

Yours,

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.

The shortening of our line will enable me to give more weight to McPhersons' movement below Calhoun.

General THOMAS:

Is not Palmer's corps engaged with Schofield? It should be, as also Howard's. Please see to it. McPherson is firing by my order, and making all the demonstrations of an assault directly up the road.

SHERMAN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,In the Field, May 14, 1864-2.30 p.m.

Major-General SHERMAN,

Commanding Military Division of the Mississippi:

GENERAL: General Palmer's corps has been engaged with General Schofield's. The position in front of Palmer's corps and General Schofield's right Schofield reports cannot be carried, as they have to advance across wide, clear fields against the enemy's breast-works, against the upper edge of the fields. They hold their own, however, but Schofield's ammunition is nearly exhausted. I have sent for more and expect it up in a few moments. General Howard is moving in on Schofield's
