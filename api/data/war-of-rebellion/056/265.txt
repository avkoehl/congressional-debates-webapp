them. Bragg has been whipped by Grant, and is in full retreat, our forces closely following. Pick up all the negroes (able-bodied males) you can. The telegraph is being built to Athens.

By direction of Brig. General G. M. Dodge:

J. W. BARNES,

Lieutenant and Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.

WASHINGTON, November 28, 1863-10.20 a.m.

Brigadier-General WILLCOX,

Cumberland Gap, Tennessee:

You are in communication with Generals Grant and Foster, and it is proper that you apply to them for instructions if you have none from General Burnside. In the mean time I would suggest the propriety of attempting to assist Burnside instead of distant operations. General Grant is moving on Kingston, and it may be practicable for you to open communication with him.

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.

CUMBERLAND GAP, November 28, 1863-4.30 p.m. (Received 12.45, 29th.)

Maj. General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

Colonel Crawford has just reached here from Knoxville, sent through by General Burnside. He says that he left Knoxville Wednesday night. Burnside is almost entirely surrounded by the rebels, who are in heavy force, and are busy intrenching themselves around him. He can defend himself against any assault, but for want of supplies may have to surrender. Burnside thought he could hold it six or eight days from the time Crawford left.

O. B. WILLCOX,

Brigadier-General.

(Same to General Grant.)

CUMBERLAND GAP, November 28, 1863-4.30p.m.(Received 12.40 p.m.,29th.)

Maj. General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

Some of the prisoners taken at Knoxville say that Ewell's corps is coming up to re-enforce Longstreet. From the systematic and deliberate manner in which the siege is conducted, General Burnside thinks that re-enforcements are expected by the rebels. Has there been any reduction of Lee's army lately?

O. B. WILLCOX,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
