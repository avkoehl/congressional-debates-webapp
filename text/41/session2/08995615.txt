II. L. DAWES,
A. A. SARGENT,
JAMES B. J3KCK,
Managers on the part of tka House.
h. M. MORRILL,
i\ A. SAWYER,
T. l'\ BAYARD,
Managers on the part ot the Senate.
Mr. DAWES. I do not want to take up
the time of the House in discussing this re-
port, and will therefore content myself with
answering such inquiries in reference to it as
gentlemen may desire to make. If there is no
such desire, I will call the previous question.
Mr. FARNSWORTH. 1 ask the gentleman
to yield to me for a few minutes.
Mr. DAWES. Certainly.
Mr. FAHNSWORTH. If I understand cor-
rectly the report of this committee of confer-
ence, I desire to say a few words with refer-
ence to one or two points of the report. I
understand that the committee of conference
report in favor of a modification of the aet of
April last, with reference to the post-office
buildings in New York and Boston. It will
be recollected that in the deficiency appropri-
ation bill which passed in April last, Congress
limited the amount which these buildings
should cost, and provided, after the expendi-
ture of several hundred thousand dollars
in the construction of the basement stories
of those buildings, that no further amount
should be expended upon the construction of
those buildings until complete plans and esti-
mates should be made, and contracts made
for the completion of those buildings with the
lowest bidders upon a fair advertisement for
competitive offers.
It will be recollected that the Committee on
the Post Office and Post Roads of this House
investigated the subject of the contracts made
for these buildings; that that committee made
a report in which it was shown that contracts
had been made very largely in excess of the
amount which had been appropriated by Con-
gress, and in direct violation of the law of the
United States, in direct violation of a statute
which made any officer of the Government who
should make suet a contract guilty of a misde-
meanor, and liable to be proceeded against by
indictment.
I despair of getting any attention to what I
say. This is a fitting commentary on this
method of passing bills by the Congress of the
United States, that at nearly midnight of the
last night of the session, a bill of this import-
ance is expected to be rushed through the
House of Representatives with scarcely a bak-
er's dozen of members attending to the numer-
ous changes proposed to be made in the bill
by this committee of conference.
I desire to call the attention of the House
to this matter. If it is a matter of any sort
of consequence whatever that officers charged
with the disbursement of the moneys of the
United States shall disburse those moneys in
accordance with the law of the land, then I
here enter my protest against relinquishing to
those officers the expenditure of the Govern-
ment money without being bound by any pro-
visions of law.
The Committee on the Post Office and Post
Roads, after investigation, recommended that
those contracts be annulled; and the Com-
mittee on Appropriations, following that rec-
ommendation, in the bill to which 1 have
referred, reported a provision which Congress
passed, limiting the expenditure of the money
upon those buildings, and providing also that
contracts to complete those buildings should
be made as I have indicated. Now, if I un-
derstand correctly the report of the committee
of conference, they propose, so far as any con-
tract is concerned winch was entered into prior
to the passage of the act of April last, that the
Secretary of the Treasury may continue it, if
he pleases. Am I right?
