FORT LEAVENWORTH, May 12, 1865.

Colonel C. W. BLAIR,

Fort Scott:

You must be on the alert and use every means at your disposal to insure the safety of the border as far up as the Kansas River. The country in Jackson, Baker, and Cass Counties is reported full of guerrillas, who committed depredations yesterday within four miles of Westport. No attention will be paid to State and district lines. Make immediate requisition for a remount of all your cavalry and forward to there headquarters. General Mitchell will be at Olathe in a few days and will advise you from there.

By order of Brigadier-General Mitchell:

JOHN PRATT,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

FORT LEAVENWORTH, May 12, 1865.

Captain S. P. THOMPSON,

Lawrence:

You can hold both the fort and the town. Of course, in emergency the former would be sacrificed to the latter. If you have reason at any time to apprehend that the town will be endangered by attempting to hold the fort you can abandon the latter and remove the stores therefrom. There is no authority here to order its abandonment otherwise.

By order of Brigadier General Robert B. Mitchell:

JOHN PRATT,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

FORT LEAVENWORTH, May 12, 1865.

Have your men in readiness to answer a call for them at a moment's notice if necessary. Do this quickly, without any display.

By order of Brigadier General Robert B. Mitchell:

Assistant Adjutant-General.
