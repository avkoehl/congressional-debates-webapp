like to have the statement read.

the letter of the Secretary. !
Mr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois. I think it

The SPEAKER. The Chair has been re-

Clerk will read the communication if there be
no objection.
The Clerk read the communication, as fol-
lows :
Washington, D. C., December 4, 1867.
Sib: As the publication of the President's message
in many of the papers ol tiio country, in advanoe of
its presentation to Congress, has been made the sub-
ject of comment and discussion in the House, and as
it is regarded as disrespectiul both to the Congress
and the President, we, the undersigned, special cor-
respondents, resident in Washington, rcspectiully
ask that the matter be referred to some appropriate
standing committee tor investigation, in order that
the responsibility of any breach of honor or good
faith may be fixed, -and that it may likewise be
known who acted Irom mercenary motives, which
are charged as being the cause of such alleged vio-
lation ot honor and good faith.
We have the honor to be, very respectfully, your
obedient servants,

Mr. WILSON, of Iowa. That request being
in tone respectful to the House, I suppose it
may as well be referred to a committee with
instructions to report whether the request
should be complied with. I therefore move
that it be referred to the Committee on the
Judiciary with such instructions.
The motion to refer was agreed to.
joint committee on retrenchment.
The SPEAKER, by unanimous consent,
laid before the House the following message
from the Senate:
In Senate of the United States,
December 3,1867.
Resolved, That the joint Committee on Retrench-
ment on the part of the Senate appointed at the last
session, and consisting of Mr. Edmunds, Mr. avil-
liams, Mr. Patterson of New Hampshire, and Mr.
Buckalew, be, and they are hereby, reappointed.
Mr. AVASHBURNE, of Illinois. I move
the reference of this resolution to the Com-
mittee on appropriations.
The SPEAKER. This matter properly
needs no reference. By reference to the Jour-
nal of the House of the 7th of March last it
will be seen that the Senate sent a message to
the House requesting concurrence in their
action continuing the joint Committee on
Retrenchment during the Fortieth Congress,
which request was complied with. That was
probably overlooked by the Senate. The mes-
sage will therefore lie on the table if there be
no objection.
Mr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois. I can see
no objection to making the reference I have
indicated.
Mr. RANDALL. I Vould like to ask the
gentleman from Illinois [Mr. Washburne]
what object he has in view in asking for this
reference. It is merely information of the
action of the Senate in reappointing this
committee. [After a pause.] In the absence
of any answer from the gentleman I would say
to him 
Mr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois. I can
explain to the gentleman if he will yield.
Mr. RANDALL. Certainly.
Mr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois. I suppose
it may be proper to refer the resolution to some
committee in order that they may inquire
whether it is best or not to continue this com-
mittee. If the matter has been passed upon
and is beyond the action of the House, then
perhaps there can be no use in sending the
resolution of the Senate to any committee.
The SPEAKER. The action of the two
Houses in continuing this committee can only
be rescinded by a concurrent resolution of both
Houses.
Mr. RANDALL. I see the dilemma the
gentleman has placed himself in by endeavor-
ing to cast an insinuation upon this committee
that they will ask for some appropriation. I
would inform him that their action lies in an
entirely different direction. They are endeav-
oring to save money, and in no event will they
ask for any appropriation.
Mr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois. I do notsee
why the gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mr.
Randall] should understand me as implying
any such thing by the motion I have made. _ 1
am very certain that any committee of which
he is a member will do all in its power to save
appropriations and effect retrenchment. I only
desired that the subject might be examined by
some committee. If the matter has passed
beyond the jurisdiction of the House the con-
current resolution had better be laid on the
table.
The SPEAKER. It will be laid on the table,
if there is no objection.
There was no objection. -
joint committee on ordnance.
The SPEAKER also laid before the House a
message from the Senate, transmitting the fol-
lowing extract from its Journal:
In the Senate op the United States,

on the part of the Senate, appointed at the Inst ses-
sion, and consisting of Mr. Howard, Mr. Cameron,
and Mr. Drake,bo, and they arehereby, reappointed.

curring with the Senate in this resolution.

34.
Mr. BOYER. I call for the yeas and nays.
The yeas and nays were ordered.
Mr. ROBINSON. Mr. Speaker, is it in
order to move that the House adjourn?
Mr. SPEAKER. It is.
Mr. ROBINSON. I make that motion.
Mr. MAYNA11D. I desire to inquire what
would be the effect of adopting now the motion
to adjourn.
The SPEAKER. The calling of the yeas
and nays would be the unfinished business to-
morrow morning.
Mr. MAYNARD. I think we may as well
dispose of this question now.
Mr. ROBINSON. I insist on the motion to
adjourn.
The motion was agreed to ; and accordingly
(at three o'clock and forty-five minutes p. m.)
the House adjourned.
