HDQRS. DEPARTMENT AND ARMY OF THE TENNESSEE,Smyrna Camp-Ground, November 6, 1864.

Major General E. R. S. CANBY,

Commanding Military DIVISION of WEST Mississippi:

I have just received a dispatch from General Dana informing me that you had ordered him to keep his headquarters at Vicksburg; also a dispatch from the War Department stating that you have transferred General Dennis' DIVISION to the Nineteenth Army Corps. Now undoubtedly, general, your purposes and mine are coincident, but a conflict of orders produces confusion. Colonel Howard, of my staff, said that you expressly stated that the transfer of troops was for a temporary emergency. As you gave me General Dana, and as he was senior officer to all my officers, and I believed was well fitted for the position, I first had him appointed to the SIXTEENTH Corps and then as my second in command during my separation. I regard Memphis as the best position for his headquarters in order that he may be better enabled to control the department and communicate more readily with Major-General Thomas at Nashville. It may be, however, that you cannot so readily communicate with him at Memphis. From the inclosed letter of General Sherman to General Dana, you will see what General Dana is expected to do. * If a permanent transfer of my troops is already effected please send me copy of the order from the War Department to that effect that I may drop them from the rolls. I shall depend on you to assist Major- General Dana in the collection of his legitimate troops from the Departments of Missouri, Arkansas, and the Gulf, in order to enable him to dented his posts or act offensively against the enemy's communications as set forth in General Sherman's letter to him.

With high regard, I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

O. O. HOWARD,

Major-General.

Lieutenant Colonel WILLIAM T. CLARK,

Asst. Adjt. General, Department and Army of the Tennessee:

General Field Orders, Numbers 19,+ from these headquarters, will now be executed. Colonel Garber will now be denominated senior chief quartermaster, and will supervise the storage of all quartermaster's property belonging to this army that has been or may be sent to the rear. He will select such places for storage as Major-General Thomas may designate, that is for everything within the limits of Department of the Cumberland, and at such places as Major-General Dana may designate in our own department. After supervising the storage and procuring a sufficient record to facilitate the recovery of the property, he will proceed to Memphis and report to Major-General Dana for further instructions. Similar instructions with reference to artillery have already been given Major Powell, assistant chief of artillery. I have written to Major-Generals Canby and Dana each a letter, copies of which I herewith inclose to you. ++

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

O. O. HOWARD,

Major-General.
