undertake to say, upon a careful examination
of this proviso, that it amounts simply to this,
sir that out of this appropriation of $100,000
no judgment whatever rendered in the Court of
Claims exceeding $5,000 shall be paid until
there shall be a special appropriation to pay it
by Congress; but the last words of that proviso
say and imply a limitation, and save, as the
committee think it important to do, the right
of appeal as it exists now under the law to
either party. It is an imputation not only
upon the Court of Claims, Dut upon the Su-
preme Court, in saying we will trust neither
one of theui under existing laws to pronounce
judgment and pay it out of this $100,000,
unless the case is less than $-5,000; and if you
take an appeal we will not trust you; but we
will revise the proceedings in order to see
whether the Supreme Court or the Court of
Claims did not tumble into some blunder.
I agree with the honorable gentleman from
Vermont [Mr. Poland] that it was a wise
thing for the Government of the United States
to establish this Court of Exchequer, and
changing these gentlemen from mere referees,
to make reports to this House, into a Court
of Exchequer between the claimants and the
nation. Having done so, I pray the House to
let it remain a court, and not revive the old
scramble that I saw before this tribunal was
established, which always resulted, in my
judgment, in giving strength to a claim, how-
ever fraudulent it was, in proportion to its
magnitude.
I will make one remark, Mr. Chairman, in
this connection in vindication of this court,
and in justification of making an appropria-
tion of $100,000 to meet whatever judgment
it may render and whatever judgment may be
sustained by the Supreme Court on appeal,
and that is that in my judgment in proportion
to the amount of claims presented there has
been a saving already to the Treasury, by rea-
son of the establishment of this tribunal, of
millions of dollars to the people of the United
States. I am ready for that investigation
whenever gentlemen choose to enter on it;
and I say it in vindication alike of the Court
of Claims and the Supreme Court, which has
appellate jurisdiction, and of the Attorney Gen-
eral, who has supervision over the claims in
behalf of the United States in the Court of
Claims, as well as in the Supreme Court of
the United States.
[Here the hammer fell.]
Mr. DAWES. I move that the committee

The motion was agreed to.

To the House of Representative .*
In compliance with the resolution of the House of

ernment in relation to the recent assault upon and
reported murder of one or more American citizens
in Cuba, I communicate a report from the Secretary

U. S. GRANT.
washington, February 11, 1870.
Mr. RANDALL. I ask for the reading of
the report. If American citizens are murdered
I think we ought to know the facts.
The SPEAKER. The Clerk will read the
! report.
! Mr. ELDRIDGE. I insist on my motion
1 that the House do now adjourn.
I . Mr. RANDALL. I desire to make an in-
quiry of the Chair. If the House adjourns on
tnis when will it come up again?
The SPEAKER. It will be the first thing
up in the morning as unfinished business, and
by that time it will be printed, if the order is
now given. The report embraces some five
pages of manuscript.
Mr. RANDALL. I understand, if the mes-
sage and report are referrred to the Committee
on Foreign Affairs and ordered to be printed,
this would prevent any immediate action being
taken by the House. I would prefer that the
papers be reserved to be read to-morrow, and
then, if the House is so disposed, they may be
taken into immediate consideration instead of
being referred to a committee.
The SPEAKER. The Chair, with the con-
sent of the House, will withdraw the papers
till to-morrow morning.
