Major-General HUMPHREYS,Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: The following was the substance of the report this morning: A column of cavalry moved southward upon the road about half a mile west of the Weldon railroad. I am unable to give the numbers, as I did not see the head of the column. I saw about 1,000. They were accompanied by four or five ambulances and six or seven wagons, there being eleven in all. They passed a point about half a mile to the southwest of the lead-works, the rear of the column passing about fifteen minutes after 7 a. m. No change apparent in the enemy's line. Few men seen moving about the intrenchments. I have just returned from the vicinity of Doctor Gurley's house. The cavalry pickets were fired upon and came in at that point.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

B. F. FISHER,

Captain and Chief Signal Officer.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: I have the honor to forward the following report:

At 9 a. m. a locomotive and tender passed southward on Weldon and Petersburg Railroad. Did not return during the day. At same hour a regiment of infantry passed to the right on road near railroad. At 1.30 p. m. a regiment of cavalry, about 500 strong, passed to the (our) left on road west of railroad, followed by one ambulance and eight wagons. During the day four other wagons passed to the left and three to the right. No movements elsewhere.

J. B. DUFF,

Lieutenant.

The cars are running at regular intervals upon the Petersburg and Richmond Railroad. Judging from the dust rising on the roads between Petersburg and Richmond there was considerable movement upon them, but of what character could not be distinguished.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

B. F. FISHER,

Captain and Chief Signal Officer.
