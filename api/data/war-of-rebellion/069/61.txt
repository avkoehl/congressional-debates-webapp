Third Division is protected by works of such heights that they have shelter-tents behind them almost concealed, and they have as strong a line in men as I have. About 400 yards in rear of them are some works with two embankments that look as if intended for guns. Between their picket-line and these works is a perfectly clear field. I have suspended the advance until the relieving of the pickets, which is now commencing, is completed.

Major-General WRIGHT,Commanding Sixth Corps:

Major-General Warren is directed to withdraw at 10 o'clock, if not attacked before that time. If practicable he will return to you the portion of your corps serving with him before he withdraws. He will direct Major Forsyth, commanding cavalry detachment, picketing on our right, to report to you. Upon the withdrawal of General Warren you will occupy the line selected yesterday.

SIXTH CORPS, May 21, 1864-7.45 a. m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

I shall be ready to occupy my new line on the withdrawal of General Warren. I have made on arrangements for occupying position at Anderson's house, understanding from the major-general commanding that it was not important to hold it. Is this right? If desired, I could occupy it with a couple of brigades and a battery, bout doubt the propriety of doing so.

If you can spare an engineer officer to remain with me, I shall be glad to have him. Lieutenant Benyaurd, who has been with me all night, but who has gone back to camp, has been of great service.
