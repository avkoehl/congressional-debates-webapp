WAR DEPARTMENT,

Washington City, June 30, 1863.

Major-General COUCH,

Harrisburg:

The views stated in your telegram of last night in respect to recruiting are correct and your order entirely proper. The complaint made required information as to the exact state of the matter to enable me to judge whether there was any misunderstanding of the law or of instructions. As there seems to be none., there is no occasion for any action by the Department in the matter except to notify the Union League that they must conform to your orders. This notice I shall give immediately.*

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.
