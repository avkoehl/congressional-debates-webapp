The amendment was agreed to.
The next amendment was to insert at the
commencement of line sixty-nine the word
and;" inline seventy-two to strikeout "two"
and insert useven.n and in line seventy-three
to strike out u $530,000;" so as to read:
And for pay of the petty officers, seamen, ordinary
seamen, landsmen, and boys, including- men for the
engineers' force, eight thousand five hundred men,
at an average payoi $300each per annum, $7,000,000.
Mr. TRUMBULL. I think that amendment,
changing the appropriation from $2,000,000 to
$7,000,000, ought to be explained.
Mr. MORRILL, of Vermont. I will explain
it. The appropriation is on the basis of the
law, for a force of eighty-five hundred men,
and is precisely what it was last year. The
estimates are on tho basis of twelve thousand
men, which is a good deal larger, of course.
Now, it will be seen that the bill has just been
amended by striking out what purports to be a
pay-roll for the Navy. It was a proposition made
by the House ; but as it was but a proposition,
the Committee on Appropriations did not feel
authorized to adopt it, and tliey recommended
that it be stricken out and an appropriation
made in accordance with the established law,
on the basis of eighty-five hundred men.
It is fair to say that the Committee on
Appropriations were notified of the intention
of the Committee on Naval Affairs to move
an amendment establishing a pay-roll for the
Navy. The Committee on Appropriations were
advised of that intent on tho part of the
Committee on Naval Affairs of the Senate: and
perceiving that it was different altogether,
or in many respects, from that proposed by the
House, there did not seem to be anything
left in the way of duty for the Committee on
Appropriations but to appropriate according
to the established law, leaving the Senate to
follow either the action of the Committee
on Appropriations, and adhere to the pres-
ent lav/, or"take the House proposition, or that
which will be proposed by the Committee on
Naval Affairs of this body. Iunderstand it
is the intention of the Committee on Naval
Affairs at the proper time to move an amend-
ment for the pay of the Navy, which, of course,
will alter this proposition in the law as it now
stands.
Mr. TRUMBULL. I should like to inquire
if the amendment of tho House in regard to
the pay of the Navy were to be adopted would
it reduce the expenses from §7,000,000 to
$2,000,000? Docs the proposed amendment
of the House changing the pay of ^ the officers
of the Navy make such a reduction as that,
some four or five millions ?
Mr. MORRILL, of Maine. No, sir. The
Senator will see that on the first page of the
bill an appropriation of $4,000,000 is stricken
out by the committee.
. Mr. TRUMBULL. And the two items are
merely put together here in this clause?
Mr. MORRILL, of Maine._ That is it. In at
is what makes this apparent discrepancy, h ith
this explanation, perhaps, the Senate wiii be
satisfied to allow the bill to progress, ana hear
the Committee on Naval Affairs on their prop-
osition to change the pay of the Navy. As it
now stands, the bill appropriates in accordance
with the established law.

Mr. MORRILL, of Maine. I desire to move
an amendment at this point to make the bill
conform to the fact. I observe that in several
places in the bill the "navy-yard at Ports-
mouth, New Hampshire," is spoken of. There
is no such vard at Portsmouth. It is at Ivit-
tery, Maine". I therefore move that wherever
the words "Portsmouth, New Hampshire,"
occur in the bill they be changed to "Kittery,
Maine." I move that verbal amendment so
as to make the bill conform to the fact.
