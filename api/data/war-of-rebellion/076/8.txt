let him take position across Sweet Water Creek, below Powder Springs, and put a regiment in observation near Salt Springs, on the road between Villa Rica and Sweet Water Town. The enemy's cavalry force will then be divided, and that is what I want.

General SCHOFIELD:

I have ordered the telegraph wire to follow. To what point do you want it? Leave some person to show the road to the repair party. Is there a practicable road from Clark's across by Byrd's position to that of Reilly? I want Stoneman, if necessary, to fight hard for that position at Sweet Water. Did you get a fair proportion of the stores yesterday?

SCHOFIELD'S HEADQUARTERS,

July 1, 1864

Major-General SHERMAN:

I shall want the telegraph line to Cheney's or some point beyond. I will have a man show the way. There is a good road from Clark's to Byrd's position, and from there to Reilly's. I think Stoneman will get the position. He was here last evening and understands the importance of it. My trains were loaded last night. I have not heard what amount the got, but presume a fair share. My troops are moving. I am about starting to the front, and will keep you advised of our progress.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE OHIO,In the Field, July 1, 1864-3 p.m.

Major-General SHERMAN:

We have advanced as far as the cross-roads, meeting with a stubborn resistance all the way. The enemy's force seems to be increasing. I am now trying to get the point where the Marietta and Ruff's Mill roads intersect, which is about half a mile to the left of the Sandtown road. My position will be very extended.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, near Kenesaw Mountain, July 1, 1864.

General SCHOFIELD:

According to my maps, the position at Wade's was as far as I expected you to take. I intended to put McPherson at Ruff's and Daniels' Mills and at Widow Mitchell's; but hold fast all you make, and intrench. Let me be fully advised to-night.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
