SAINT JOSEPH, July 20, 1864.

GEORGE SMITH,

Cameron:

My force is all out in lower part of this county. If they get in during the night, shall re-enforce you from this point. If not, you must make the best possible fight you can with force you have. I am utterly powerless for want of troops. I hope to receive aid direct from the loyal people forthwith. I have asked 5,000 of such to join me in a bushwacking hunt. If they respond somebody will get hurt. Please keep in communication with my headquarters until we learn more of the movements of the villains.

CLINTON B. FISK,

Brigadier-General.

Our forces here is very small, the greater part of my company and about fifteen of Company C. All the rest are sick. I would like to have all information at your disposition concerning the matter.

I have no forces that I can send you. Thornton I understand is moving eastward. Can't you re-enforce the Utica party and go out after the villains? Colonel Swain, of Chillicothe, is organizing a force for the chase.
