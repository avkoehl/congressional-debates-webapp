COMMANDING OFFICER GUN-BOAT FLEET,

SIR: My army is here, the enemy having fled easteard across the river, burning his bridge, but I will have pontoons down to-day. I will be here probably till Wednesday, and would like some of your boats to come up for effect, and, if agreeable, can give you a load of "refugees or cotton at pleasure. " I would like to produce the "effect" of a design to establish a "base," which, of course, I do not propose to do. Water will continue high some time.

Yours, truly,

WISE'S FORKS, March 12, 1865.

Major-General SCHOFIELD, New Berne:

I was not confident enough in the accuracy of the report from the cavalry scout yesterday to send it. An infantry sergeant with a few men went to the river. The planks are taken off the bridge and piled up. An infantry picket is at this end of the bridge, which ran back across the river on the approach of our reconnoitering party. The rebels opened with artillery from works on the other side of the Neuse, where a considerable line of rifle-pits and some embrasures for artillery were seen. Such is the sergeant's report, and 1 think it true. Hoke signs himself in command of the forces, indicating that the rest are gone.

Very respectfully, &amp;c.,

J. D. COX,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF BEAUFORT,March 12, 1865.

Major-General SCHOFIELD, New Berne:

Hoke sent in a request to exchange what prisoners we have, both here and at New Berne. What answer shall I make?

J. D. COX,

Major-General.
