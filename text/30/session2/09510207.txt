the work, and the whole proceeds accoiding to a regular
plan, caretully arranged, and having in view a definite ie-
«ult. Tiie temp^ratj' chaiacl«*i ofilie work is recognized as
a Cdidmal principle, no permanent corps being organized to
conduct u—a feature which has proved important m other
works, and which, I doubt nor, has its influence in tins.

"As soon as the atrangements ot the army in its new
positions peimit, L hope again to have the services upon the
woik of such of the staff* and line officers* as can be hUitably
employed, and can be spared from their regular dune*."
That is his application of the law—such his de-
sire to have officers of the army and navy seeking
for more than he is able to obtain.
The Senator has referred to an article in the plan
of organization of the coast survey of 1843, which
requires that chiefs of parties detailed from the
army and navy should not be relieved from the
-work without, notice to the department having
charge of it, and this, he says, puts the enure
at my and navy under the SeereUuy of the Tieas>-
ury. The Senator surely must be aware that the
Secretary of the Treasuiy has no power to detail
an officer of the army or navy for the survey, but
that is done by the head of their respective depart-
ments. Nor can it follow, as a legitimate construc-
tion of the article, that the department having
charge of the work coutd refuse to allow an offi-
cer of the army or navy to be withdrawn by the
head of the department to which he belongs, but
only that notice shall be given, that the Secretary
may not be cmbairassed by the withdiawal of the
chief of a party, without an opportunity having
been given to supply his place and to provide for
the prosecution of the particular work of which
he may have had charge. Still more strange is ihe
construction which would place the44 entire" army
and navy under the control of the Secretary of the
Treasury, from the employment of a portion of it
in the survey of the coast.
The investigations involved in the coast survey
are of the most abstruse science, requiting com-
putations of the highest order of mathematics and
physics, such forexample as the problem indicated
by La Place in the Chambei of Deputies in 1817,
_ and which has received its first solution, for the
pride of American science be it remembered, by
the present superintendent of the coast survey.
To determine the curvature of the earth, its exte-
rior form, by the deflection of thS plumb line, in-
dicating the internal sti uctui£ of the earth. This
knowledge is essential to the exact determination
of latitude, and therefore coupled most usefully and
directly with the establishment of stations and with
the accuracy of the survey. If there be officers of
the navy, then, competent to this high reach of
science, and, therefore, to superintend a geodetic
survey, why do we not employ them to teach in
the naval school? Why do we employ civil pro-
fessors to teach midshipmen the-elements of sci-
ence? That seems to me far more professional
than to undertake a work where the observations
are astronomical or terrestrial—and the computa-
tions are for trigonometrical or topographical sur-
veys, which can have no connection with their
profession.
I do not know how far the navy complain of
not having their fuil share of this work. You will
always find persons in the nav.y, as in other pur-
suits of life, complaining of their lot as compared
with that of their neighbors. Many are no doubt
anxious to go to the Mediterranean—anxious to go
to the Pacific, and to take command of mail steam-
ers. Two of them have left the coast survey for
this purpose very recently. Ail desire the most
eligible positions, and but very few in any voca-
tion are ever content. My acquaintance js very
limited with officers of the navy  My conclusions
are derived from the few, but are very decided that
in this, as on more memoiabie occasions, they are
ready to cooperate with the" army and share with
them the good and evil. One of them—at this time
an assistant in the coast survey—who is anjionor
to his profession, and who, if there be an officer m
the navy competent to take charge of it, is, I doubt
not, the very one—always commends in the high-
est terms the present organization of the coast sur-
vey. He takes every proper occasion to place in
bold relief the successful labors of the superintend-
ent, and would most deeply regiet to see him
driven from his position, even for the benefit of an
officer of the navy.
1 am anxious, Mr. President, to pass over these
points as rapidly as possible; but I cannot neglect
the statement which has been made of the exist-
ence of a bureau of ordnance and hydrography in
connection with the surveys of Great Britain.
The surveys made by the ordnance corps of Great
Britain correspond very nearly to those made by
our topographical corps. Their ordnance surveys
are like our topographical surveys. Their hydro-
graphical bureau is for hydrographical surveys j
and by not having the two connected, it follows
that the oidnance corps establish their stations,
make their topographical survey, and then the
hydrographical party must establish their stations
also, upon which their hydrographical survey is
based. The stations being independent one of the
other, each must take independent observations,
which perhaps never correspond, and produce
disagreeing maps of the same localities. The
Senator says we have a buieau of ordnance and
hydrogiaphy; but it is for very different purposes
from those winch he. seems to attribute to it. it
is to supply naval ordnance and munitions, to keep
and issue nautical charts and instruments for vessels
of war.
I have referred already to th$ expenditure of the
ordnance survey of Great Britain; I will refer very
briefly to their hydrographical surveys. 1 find for
I84tj, coupled with the hydrographical surveys,
there are reported eighteen vessels, and these ves-
sels of large tonnage—a large number of officers
on board—agieat many of them steamers—making
the total tonnage upwards of 6,276. On the coast
of England they have nine vessels, amounting to
3,201 tons, with sixty officers.

wholly unsuited to the service, and after the most
expensive, fruitless experiments, they have been
turned over to the coast survey, and running at
low rates of speed, they have been found Jo an-
swer a very good purpose.
The great expense of these steamers, their inap-
plicability to revenue purposes, and the expensive
repairs constantly required, rendered it desirable
to the treasury to get rid of them. In the coast
survey they require few repairs. The consump-
tion of fuel is very small, and a saving by trans-
ferring these vessels from the revenue marine,
and substituting sailing vessels, as stated by Gap-
tain Alexander V. Fraser, will be from three to
four hundred thousand dollars, so that the treas-
ury has lost nothing by tiansferring these vessels
to the coast survey.
The Senator from Missouri [Mr. Benton] used
a table. I do not know where it was obtained.
It makes an exhibit of the annual expense to the
navy of the hydrographical department of the coast
survey, and of the number of vessels employed
therein by Professor Bache. In this table, it ap-
pears, there are two hundred and nine thousand
dollais annual expense to be charged to the coaSt
suivey, which was dtawn from the navy. Now,
sir, I do not find that the vessels here stated are
used in the hydrography of the coast survey. It
does not appear that some of them have e\er been
there. The officers, stated to be ninety-four in
number, are actually forty-nine. The " JefFeisoii"
has never been used in the coast survey The
" Gallatin" has been transferred from* the coast
survey to the revenue service temporarily in ex-
change for the " Ewing." Several of the vessels,
viz: the Phoenix, Wave, Vanderbilt, and Walker?
[Gerdes] are employed by the triangulationand top-
ographical parties, and are sailed and manned ex-"
ciusivelyat the cost of the coast survey. The cost
of fuel and oil and contingencies is paid from the
coast survey appropriation. It is not too much
to say of this table that not one of the ten columns
which it contains is correct. Its erroneous char-
acter will appear from the following tables:

This is the great establishment upon which their
surveys rest, extending far beyond their own
coast, at an expense such as is always to be found
wherever the work is turned over to a corps or a
profession not dependent for either its reputation
or support upon the achievement of the work.
In relation to the amount which has been stated
of the expenditure made by the navy for the ben-
efit ot' the survey, I have taken the trouble to col-
lect some facts. 1 find that the Secretary ot' the j
Navv, ill reply to an >nq«iry growing out of the
cill of the Senate as to the expenditure made from ■
the navy for the benefit of the coast survey, stated
it to be <il92,000 since 1844. This does not in-
clude the pay of the officers of the navy, which
thev would be entitled to if on leave ot absence,
but the difference between the leave of absence and
sea pay, as the only amount which can properly
be chargeable to the coast suivey. If it be sup-
posed that they would not be on leave, but waiting
orders, the amount would be less. 1 he case there-
fore piesents it in a most unfavorable iorm.
We find that the vessels employed were lour
schooners belonging to the navy; the rest either |
belong to the coast survey, or have been turned
over from the revenue marine. The whole chaige,
therefore, which can be represented as an unseen
contribution"from the navy to the coast survey, is
the use of four schooners. It will be recollected,
Mr. President, that for the revenue service we
built some steam vessels, and they v/ere lound
