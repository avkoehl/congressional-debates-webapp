RICHMOND, March 12, 1863.

Lieutenant-General PEMBERTON:

You are hereby authorized to order Brigadier-General [A.]. Buford to report to Major-General [S.] Price for duty in the Trans-Mississippi Department at such time as you may deem proper.

S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General.

WAR DEPARTMENT, Richmond, March 12, 1863.

General J. C. PEMBERTON, Jackson, MISS.:

The Department requires the removal of the stores of sugar and molasses at Vicksburg, except so far as may be positively necessary for your army. Retain full supply for a month or six weeks in case of possible investment, and send the residue back.

J. A. SEDDON.

JACKSON, March 12, 1863.

Captain I. N. BROWN, Greenwood, MISS., via Grenada:

[J. C.] Moore's brigade ordered to Yazoo City. All the heavy guns that can be spared sent forward; also the ammunition. The steamer May, presumed to be cotton-clad, should not be sent down, and, with her and the Magenta, any flank movement near by can be prevented.

J. C. PEMBERTON.

Vicksburg, March 12, 1863.

Lieutenant-General PEMBERTON:

Shall the Yazoo be obstructed above or below Yazoo City? If by a raft, shall it be placed at once, shutting off communication?

C. L. STEVENSON.

Vicksburg, March 12, 1863.

Lieutenant-General PEMBERTON:

If the Big Black is obstructed by raft, the supply boats cannot get to railroad. Shall it be made?

C. L. STEVENSON.

Lieutenant-General PEMBERTON:

Most of the transports, and apparently many troops, have gone up the river; how far I cannot learn. There are but two camps in sight. The dredging-boats are outside of the levee, and have not advanced to-day. By close observation from opposite the entrance, it is ascertained that their progress so far is about one-FIFTH the length of canal, which part is now overflowed on both sides. It is probable that if the State levee is cut by them, it will flood their camp.

C. L. STEVENSON.
