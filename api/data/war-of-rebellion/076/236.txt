who is watching the Chattahoochee below Turner's Ferry. He will describe to you the country and what is needed. I want him relieved as soon as possible, that he may over here. I hope to see you in a few days.

I am, &amp;c.,

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE CUMBERLAND,July 23, 1864.

Major-General SHERMAN,

Commanding Military Division of the Mississippi:

GENERAL: Your order of last night is being carried out by my troops to-day. The enemy appears to be feeling my right and rear, but in what force I cannot ascertain, as General McCook cannot ascertain on account of the difficulties of the ground. General Rousseau has received the order to move his force to Turner's Ferry, though the movement will be somewhat delayed by his having left Marietta to visit you before the order reached him. It was sent by telegraph also, but as he had left Marietta at daylight this morning he did not receive the order before reaching my headquarters.

Very respectfully,

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,Near Atlanta, July 23, 1864.

Major General O. O. HOWARD,

Commanding Fourth Army Corps:

GENERAL: Your note of 8 p. m. was received last night. The major-general commanding says that it will not be necessary for you to send two regiments to intercept the rebel cavalry.

Yours, very respectfully,

WM. D. WHIPPLE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, near Atlanta, Ga., July 23, 1864.

General STONEMAN,

Turner's Ferry:

I sent an order for you to send a brigade of cavalry at once. I have just learned that General Rousseau has arrived at Marietta from Opelika and have ordered him to relieve you. Have all your men ready to start the moment General Rousseau comes. Turn over to him your instructions and the use of your pontoon that he may cross over at Turner's the moment his horses are rested and General Thomas orders him.

I am, &c.,

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
