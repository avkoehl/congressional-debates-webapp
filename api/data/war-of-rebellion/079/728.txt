General L. C. EASTON,

Atlanta:

To-night General Corse will abandon Rome and to-morrow will move to this point. The next day, the 12th, General Davis will uncover Kingston and move to the Etowah; therefore you can use the railroad below this point till about daylight of the 12th. See Colonel Beckwith and make your calculations close, and it would be prudent to have a surplus both of forage and provisions, and after loading the wagons men will fill their haversacks. I think there are now cars enough here and below to clean out Atlanta of everything of value. It would be a Godsend to the quartermaster's department if we could burn up a few thousand of your wagons and tents.

Colonel BECKWITH,

Atlanta, Ga.:

When I start I propose to move with great rapidity, faster than cattle can possibly gain on us. They are now five days behind and could not possibly catch up, as I will break the Etowah and Chattanooga bridges in passing, and those streams are now too high to cross without bridges. We can safety rely on the country for half rations of meat. Where a million of people live, I have no fear of getting a share.
