HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,Peebles' Farm, September 30, 1864-4.15 p. m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

In accordance with your instructions, I have directed General Gregg to send a brigade of cavalry on the left of the infantry and endeavor to turn the enemy's left, the other brigade to support it, if necessary, and to keep a lookout on our immediate rear, where from all indications, the enemy's cavalry withdrew. General Parke is advancing toward the Boydton road in a northwest direction. I should have mentioned in my last dispatch that General Ayres had taken a small work in advance and on the right of the one taken by Griffin, and also that General Griffin had secured one piece of artillery. Warren's casualties will be about 100 killed and wounded, among the former Colonel Welch, of Michigan. The number of prisoners not known, but not so large as at first supposed.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.

CITY POINT, VA., September 30, 1864.

Major-General MEADE:

Whilst the enemy are concentrating all their strength at two points to resist attacks, did you not deem it safe to take one division of the Second Corps out of the line to aid you? I would not do this, however, until just before and advance is going to be made.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
