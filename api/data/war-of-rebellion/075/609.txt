of Davis' division, captured one line of rebel breast- works, which they still hold. McCook's brigade was also very severely handled, nearly every colonel being killed or wounded. Colonel McCook wounded. It is compelled to fall back and reorganize. The troops are all too much exhausted to advance, but we hold all we have gained.

General THOMAS:

McPherson's column reached near the top of the hill through very tangled brush, but was repulsed. It is found almost impossible to deploy, but they still hold the ground. I wish you to study well the position, and if it be possible to break the line do it; it is easier now than it will be hereafter. Hold fast all you make. I hear Leggett's guns well behind the mountain.

General THOMAS:

McPherson and Schofield are at a dead- lock. Do you think you can carry any part of the enemy's line to- day! McPherson's men are up to the abatis and can't move without the direct assault. I will order the assault if you think you can succeed at any point. Schofield has one division close up on the Powder Springs road, and the other across Olley's Creek, about two miles to his right and rear.

HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,June 27, 1864- 1.40 p. m.

Major- General SHERMAN:

Davis' two brigades are now within sixty yards of the enemy's intrenchments. Davis reports that he does not think he can cary the works by assault on account of the steepness of the hill, but he can hold his position, put in one or two batteries to- night, and probably drive them out to- morrow morning. General Howard reports the same. Their works are from six to seven feet high and nine feet thick. In front of Howard they have a very strong abatis. Davis' loss in officers has been very heavy. Nearly all the field officers in McCook's brigade, with McCook, have been killed or wounded. From what the officers tell me I do not think we can carry the works by assault at this point to- day, but they can be approached by saps and the enemy driven out.

Very respectfully,

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major- General, Commanding.
