Davy    Heac'ed as he bad done with  a View t>
tbe payment of the debts of the  na'ion.    About a
monih ago, when the bill was under discusión in
the Committee of the Whole, he  had made some
remark*, in answer to tbs charge  that  Massachu-
setts had an undue proportion of hei oitize is m the
navy.    He then showed thit it  was unfounded,
and that, {or «me years p^t, Massachusetts bad
not bad its due proportion of tha office's  of our
navy.   In furnishing proof of this a- -ertton, lie
was led t«i exagune the Navy Register, fro on which
he discovered  that,  although Massachus-tts had
not her due propo tiOn, Virginia  had, pes- centra,
five or six times as many a> she  was entitled to,
both now and here ofore     He bal fiim rly  slid

By a statement which I have furnished to the
chairman of the Committee of Ways and Means,
[Mr Fillmoue,] it is bown that this amendment
even will not meet the amount required for the
whole service of the year, by a sum little short of
1200,000 And thus the real is ue was and is,
■.halt ihe navy b* paid for h- s-r/ice Jt ha- acta
ally rendered' Or, will t^is ration repudiate its
own debt to the officers -nd s>amen of it* own
navy, already mcarred? Wh l*-t th's questu n was
under debate, lbs mo-t potential argument, or
ra her that which feerp«d to have most weight and
influence against pavmg our efficers and sesmen,
was the f i lleobjec lont iat there wasgrepfee lonal
inequality m the appointment of the officerb of tbe
navy.
It was rephel, with reason and j 's'iee, that
though thin fact might ke so, tet i> \ a, no argu-
ment as-a nit paying ofli-e1-*. who were ?ppoJ)ted

j'O ¡on prevailed, ihe anp'opna ioa wa  reduced,
and since it has been re tored b> the Senate, the
same objection was urged m this House again and
by lone more «fenuoasly than h/ the member
from Ma"sachu"ett^, [Mr. Adams ] Trne, he sup-
porttd the amendment of the Senate by his vote,
bj , as usual with his perveroe "ird ino insistent
na'ure and cnur-e, he voted oneway and a'ghed
the other. He vo'cd for the proportion, a id op-
posed it with elstorate statistics to show this very
inequality of captains, commanders, iieutenan s,
andm d'nipmentrom the St>tes of Ma'/tand, Vir-
ginia, and the Distnrt of Columbia, which ?e e?ted
