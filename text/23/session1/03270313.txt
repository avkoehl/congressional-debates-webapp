Whether or not an imoeachment was to be ex-
pected from the House of Repiesentatives, was a
point on which the Senate had no constitutional
light to specu'ate, and in respect to which, even
bad it possessed 'he spirit of prophecy, its antici

impeach any to themselves, nor ]om m the accu-
sation, because they are judges " Independently of
the general reasons on which this rule is founded,
its propriety and importance are greatly increased
by the nature of the impeaching power. The power
oí arraigning the high officers of Government, be-
fore a tribunal whose sentence may expel them
fiom their seats, and brand them as infamous, is
eminently a popular remedy—a íemedy designed
to be employed for the protection of private right
and public liberty, against t^e abuses of injustice
and the encroachments of arbitiary power But
the framers of the Go.istitu'ion vere also undoubt-
edly aware, that this formidable instrument had
been, and might be abused, and that from its very
nature, an impeachment for high crimes and mis-
demeanors, whatever might be its result, would in
mosteases be accompanied by so much of dishonor
and repioach, solicitude and suffering,as to make
the power of prefernng it one of the highest so-
lemnity and impoitance It was due to both these
considerations, tnat the impeacning power shou'd
be lodged in the hands of those who, from the
mode of their election and tne tenure of then offices,
would most accuiately express the popular will,
and at the same time be most directly and speedily
amenable to the people. The theory of these wise
and benignant intentions is, in the present case,
effectually defeated by the proceedings of the Sen-
pations would have furnished no just giounds for I ate. The members of that body represent, not the
this procedure. Admitting that there was reason
to believe that a*\iclation of the Constitution and
luws had been actually committed by the Presi-
dent, still it was the duty of the Senate, as his
sole constitutional judges, to wait for an impeach-
ment until the othei House should think propei to
prefer it The members of the Senate cou'd have
no right to infer that no impeachment wa3 intend
ed °Oa the contrary, every lege! and rational
presumption on their part ought to have been, that,
if there was good íeason to believe him guilty of
an lmpeacbaole offence, the House of Representa-
tives would perform its constitutional duty, by
arraigning the offendei before the justice of his
country The contraiy presumption would in-
volve an implication derogatory to the integrity
and honor of the representatives of the people
But suppose the suspicion thus implied were
actually entertained, and forgood cause,how can
it justify the assumption by the Senate of poweis
not conferred by the Constitution'
It is only necessary to look at the condition in
wh.ch the Senate and the President have been
placed by this proceeding, to perceive its utter in-
compatibility with the provisions and the spirit of
the Constitution, and with the plainest dictates of
humanity and justice
If the House of Representatives shall be of
opinion that there is just ground for the censure
pronounced upon the President, then will it be the
solemn duty of that House to prefer the proper
accusation, and to cause him to be brought to trial
by tne constitutional tribunal. But in what con-
dition would he find that tribunal' A majority
of its members have already considered the case,
nd have not only formed, but expressed, a delib
people, but the States, and though they are un
doubtedly responsible to the States, yet, from their
extended tei m of service, the effect of that respon-
s'bihty duimg the whole period of that term must
vei y much depend upon their own impressions of
its obligatory force     When a body thus consti-
tuted, expresses, beforehand, its opinion in a pai- j
tieular case, and thus mdnertly invites a prosecu-1
tion.it not only assumes a power intended forw.se .
reasons to be confined to omers, but it shields the
latter from that exclusi.e and personal responsibil !
lty under which it was intended to be exercised,
and íeveises the whole scheme of this part of the
Constitution
Such would be some of the objections to this
procedure, even if it were adm tted that theie
is just ground for imputing to the President the
offences cnaiged in the resolution But if, on the
other hand, the House of Representatives shall be
of opinion that there is no reason for charging
them upon him, and shall, therefore, deem it im-
proper to piefer an impeachment, then will the
violation of privilege as it respects that House, of
justice as it regards the President, and of the Con-
stitution, as it relates to both, be only the more
conspicuous and impressive.
The constitutional mode of procedure on an im-
peachment has not only been wholly disregarded,
but some of the fii st principles of natural right and
enhghtened jurisprudence have been violated in the
very form ot the resolution It carefully abstains
from averring m which of "the late proceedings in
' relation to the public revenue, the Pres'dent has
'assumed upon himself authority and power not
' conferred by the Constitution and laws " It care-
fully abstains from specifying what laws or vJiat
erate ludgment upon its merits.    It is the policy ¡parts of the Constitutton have been violated   Why

in ah criminal proceedings, and even in the most
trivial ligations, a fair, unprejudiced, and impar-
tial trial And surely it cannot be less important
that such a trial should be secured to the highest
officer of the Government.
The Constitution makes the House of Kepre-
eentatives the exclusivejudges^n the first instance,
of the question whether the President has commit-
ted an impeachable offence. A majority of the
Senate, whose nterference with this preliminary
question has, for the best of all reasons, been
studiously excluded, anticipate the action of the
IIoui>e of Repiesentatives, assume not only the
function whnh belongs exclusively to that body,
but convert themselves into accuseis, witnesses,
counsel, and judges, and prejudge the whole case
-thus presenting the appalling spectacle, in a free
State, of ludges going through a labored prepara-
tion for an impartial hearing and decision, by a
previous ex park investigation and sentence against
the supposed offender.                                /->„„„-,
There is no more settled axiom in that Govern.
cause of the accusation "—set out m the manner re-
quired in the Constitution, before even the humblest
individual, for the smallest crime, can be exposed
to condemnation ' Such a specification was due to
the accused, that he might direct his defence to the
real points of attack—to the people, that they might
clearly understand in what particulars their insti-
tutions had been violated, and to the truth and
certainty of our public annals As the record now
stands, whilst the resolufon plainly charges upon
the President at least one act of usurpation in ' the
late execu'ive pioceedmgs in relation to tne public
revenue,"and is so flamed that those Senators who
believed that one such act, and only one, had been
committed, could assent to it, its language is yet
broad enough to include several such acts, and so
it may have been regarded by some of those who
voted for it But though the accusation is thus
comprehensive m the censures it implies, there is
no such certainty of time, place, or circumstance,
as to exhibit the particular conclusion of tact or
law which induced any one Senator to vote for it
e is no more settled axiom in tnat «ovei.i-   ¡ X„/,"mav well have happened, that whilst one
m the resolution, was anarbitrary and unconstitu-
tional assumption of power, others of the majority
may have deemed that very act both constitutional
and expedient; or if not expedient, yet still within
the pale of fheConstitution. And thus a majority
of the Senators may have been enabled to concui,
in a vague and undefined accusation, that the Pres 
ident, in the course of " the late executive proceed-
ings in relation to thepubhc ievenue,"had violated
the Constitution and laws, whilst, if a separate
vote had been taken in respect to each particular
act, included v.ithin the general terms, the accusers
of the President might, on any such vote, have
been found m the minority.
Still further to exemplify this feature of the pro-
ceeding, it is important to be remarked, that the
resolution as onginally offeied to the Senate, spe-
cified, with adequate piecision, certain acts of the
President which it denounced as a violation of the
Constitution and laws, and that it was not until
the very close of the debatefand when, perhaps, it
was apprehended that a majority migh' not sustain
the specific accusation contained m it, that the res-
olution was so modified as to assume its present
form. A more striking illustration of the sound-
ness and necessity of the rules which forbid vague
and indefinite generalities, and require a reasonable
certainty in all judicial allegations, and a more
glaring instance of the violation of those rules, has
seldom been exhibited.
In this view of the resolution it must certainly
be íegarded, notas a vindication of any particular
provision of the law or the Constitution, but sim-
ply asan official rebuke or condemnatory sentence,
too general and indefinite to be easily repelled, but
yet sufficiently precise to bring into discredit the
conduct and motives of the Executive. But what-
ever it may have been intended to accomplish, it is
obvious that me vague, general, and abstract form
of the resolution, is m perfect keeping with those
other departures from first principles and settled
improvements in jurisprudence, so properly the
boast of free countries in modern times And it is
not too much to say, of the whole of these proceed-
ings, that if they shall be approved and sustained
by an intelligent people, then will that great con-
test with arbitrary power, which had established
■n statutes, in bills of rights, in sacred charters,
I and in constitutions of Government, the right of
every citizen, to a notice before trial, to a hearing
before conviction, and to an impartial tribunal
for deciding on the charge, have been waged in
vain.
If the resolution had been leftm its original form
it is not to be presumed that it could ever have re-
ceived the assent of a majority of the Senate, for
the acts therein specified as violations of the Con-
stitution and laws were clearly within the limits of
the Executive authority. They are the " dismis-
' sing the late Secretary of the Treasury, because
' he would not, contrary to his sense of his own
' duty, remove the money of the United States in
' deposite with the Bank of the United States and
' its branches, in conformity with the President's
' opinion, and appointing his successor to effect
1 such removal, which has been done " But as no
other spec.fication has been substituted, and as
these were the " Executive proceedings in relation
to the public revenue," principally íeferred to in
the course of the discussion, they will doubtless
be generally regarded as the acts intended to be
denounced as "an assumption of authonty and
' power not conferred by the Constitution or laws,
' but in derogation of both." It is therefore due
to the occasion that a condensed summary of the
views of the Executive in respect to them, should
be here exhibited.
By the Constitution, "the executive power is
vested in a President of the United States '
Among the duties imposed upon him, and which
he is swoin to perform, is that of "taking care
that the laws be faithfully executed." Being thus
made responsible for the entire action of the Exec-
utive Department, it was but reasonable that the
power of appointing, overseeing, and controlling
those who execute the laws—a power in its nature
executive—should remain in his hands It is,
theiefore, not only his right, but the Constitution
makes it his duty, to "nominate, and by and with
the advice and consent of the Senate appoint, all
" officers of the United States whose appointments
