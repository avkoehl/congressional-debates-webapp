which Butterfield will take in flank, while artillery engage it in front. All will be in motion soon. I had these in motion too late to move on the Warrenton road.

Very respectfully,

F. J. PORTER,

Major-Genera.

General PORTER:

Twenty-fifth [New York], skirmishing on our right, report that King's skirmishers do not move up, and whenever they advance they get a cross-fire. They have lost several. The following diagram will show what I mean:

BUTTERFIELD,

Brigadier-General, Commanding Division.

[Indorsement.]

I understood Ricketts was to come up on my right, which is the cause of this impression of Butterfield. I will soon have a battery in the road referred to. The resistance is pretty strong, and the batteries on the hill will sweep our men so that they will not advance directly over the slopes.

F. J. PORTER,

Major-General.

[AUGUST 30, 1862.]

General McDOWELL:

My right is invested with skirmishers, and I see skirmishers running from them. The officer in command says that he was driven in by a heavy force of skirmishers. I would respectfully suggest that some force be put in there. I send another note from Butterfield. You can see how matters stand.

[F. J. PORTER.]
