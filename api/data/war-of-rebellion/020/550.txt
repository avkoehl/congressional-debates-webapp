CHARLESTON, S. C., June 5, 1862.

General W. D. SMITH, Secessionville, S. C.:

I will order Colonel Harrison's regiment to take post on the lines near your present headquarters. I have received a supply of ammunition for small-arms. The gunboat, with two 8-inch Dahlgren guns and two Blakely guns, small, will go to Secessionville to-night. An 8-inch columbiad is also ordered.

I will give $200 to any man that will succeed in burning the bridge to Cole's Island.

You will cause the enemy's pickets to be annoyed as much as possible to-night. I suggest this plan: Deploy some 50 or 100 men at ten to fifteen paces intervals, to advance if possible within good range, musket or rifle, as they may be, and if musket use ball and buck. At a concerted signal fire into their groups of four, and fall back without collecting in groups themselves; have a sufficient force lying down; resist an advance at a point which your skirmishers shall be made acquainted with and toward which they shall move.

J. C. PEMBERTON,

Major-General, Commanding.
