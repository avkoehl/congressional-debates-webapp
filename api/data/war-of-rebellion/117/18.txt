prisoners belonged were Texas regiments and I believe all cavalry. I sent General Blunt copies of all written documents placed in my hands.

Respectfully,

OWEN A. BASSETT,

Lieutenant-Colonel Second Kansas Volunteers.

WASHINGTON, June 14, 1862.

Governor TOD, Columbus:

The question in relation to prisoners is now under consideration. If they are paroled great complaint is made by the friends of our prisoners in the South. No trust can be placed in their parole. I think it is cheaper to keep them where are than to send them back as recruits, for the rebel Government will release them by law from their parole and force all into the ranks who do not go voluntarily, so that we shall only have to fight and take them again.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

CORINTH, MISS., June 14, 1862.

ABRAHAM LINCOLN, President of the United State:

Colonel Owen, who has so efficient commanded at the camp for prisoners, is under orders to take the field with his regiment. I have organized a military force for their place. I desire to place the camp under the supervision of Colonel D. G. Rose, U. S. marshal, as commander if it can be done without vacating or interfering with his office as marshal. He is the man for the position. Please arrange this. Advise me by telegraph.

O. P. MORTHON,

Governor of Indiana.
