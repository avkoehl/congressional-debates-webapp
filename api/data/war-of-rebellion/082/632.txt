cock comes? Shall I direct Mott with his limited force to assault? I think he runs some risk in doing so, especially as the enemy's entanglements and our deep trenches would cause delay in the execution.

E. O. C. ORD,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, July 29, 1864 - 2.30 p. m.

Major-General ORD:

Let Mott relieve your corps, but let him await orders for assaulting from Hancock, who will be up in time to give them, even if all his corps is not. Hancock will be ordered to move up in rear of Mott, and hold his corps in readiness for immediate action.

GEO. G. MEADE,Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS EIGHTEENTH ARMY CORPS, July 29, 1864 - 9.25 p. m.

General MEADE:

General Mott and division have just passed my headquarters going to the front. At this rate it will be midnight, perhaps, before my troop can march to Burnside's, and it will take some three hours to relieve his men from the trenches and form them. I gave my orders as fast as received.

E. O. C. ORD,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, July 29, 1864 - 9.45 p. m.

Major-General ORD,Commanding Eighteenth Corps:

Your dispatch of 9.25 p.m. is received. The commanding general does not consider ot necessary for General Burnside to wait for your troops to relieve his in the trenches. General Burnside can form his troops for the assault without reference to yours, and your troops can file into the trenches at any time after they are vacated. General Burnside is telegraphed to that effect.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.

HEADQUARTERS EIGHTEENTH CORPS, July 29, 1864.

General BURNSIDE:

I am afraid there will be some delay in getting my division into your trenches. Mott has to relieve Carr, a new general. Carr has to get his people together and find his place, and then your people get their positions, all after dark. I will try to have Carr report as he nears you, but one of your officers ought to be with Carr.

E. O. C. ORD.
