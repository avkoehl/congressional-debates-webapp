number of banks from about thirty-seven to
eighty seven' Here is a discrepancy between
profession mid practice which a just sense ot pro-
priety w ul not t nl to condemn ns a cunning strat-
agem to deceive the ptoplt and practice on the
credulity ot the country Notwithstanding this
alarming state of things, Mr Woodbury savs
" thegt tier il currency of the country isimproved,
instead ot deti norated "
In connection with this branch of the sub)ect,
Mr B said he would briefly i<-fi r to the state
of our domestic exi'innge Tabular statements
showing the rute of exchange were often ap-
pended to the returns ot the Bank ot the United
States, and may be sien, if gentlemen will take
the trouble to lefer to them By these it appears*
(and my own lecoliection confirms the fact) that
th« whole exchange system was, for a series of
years, and at the time of the removal of the de-
posits, conducted at just and uniform rates, and
certainly with signal advantage to the country
In Mr Tanev's report, as already quoted, lie
says the State banks *' will afford facilities to com-
merce, and in the business of domestic exchange
equal to any which the community have hereto-
fore en|oyid " And Mr Woodbury, in his last
annual report, sa>s:
' The facilities that have be«-n furnished to the commer
cial coinmunit) in domestic exchange were probably never
greater, or at  o moderate rates '
After this declaration, it is strange that he did
not furnish tables showing the rate of exchange
throughout the country, as we might then have
instituted a comparison of the rates under the two
systems     I am compelled to question the fact
thus stated, because the commercial experience
of the last year is at variance with it, and the
daily accounts show the domestic exchange to
have risen     But the Secretary, being willing, I
suppose, to afford some light on the subject, term-
inates his annual report with what was probably
the only exchange table he had    And what, sir,
do you suppose it contains'    Why, instead of
exhibiting the rates of  purchasing and selling
exchange at the principal cities and towns in all
the States, we have an account of some petty
operations at Portsmouth, ¡New Hampshire.   By
this we hear that this bank purchased domestic
exchange, in the space ot lorty-two days, to the
amount of §19,251, and sold checks for $36,645 '
How marvelously important'   And the Secretary
also informs us that this Commercial Bank pur-
chases and collects exchange on New Bedford,
Nantucket, Bangor, Dover, and  Concord, and
that the Merchants' Bank of Boston purchases
exihange on Taunton, Beverly, and Marblehead'
But in this table, so imposingly exhibited, an
«nine silence is observed as to the rates on which
these banks sell checks or drafts on other places
I have compared this meager exchange table
with that of the Bank of the United States in
1833, when the new system commenced, and it
• will be apparent to any person vv ho will make the
examination that the advantages in the rate of
exchange were decidedly greater then than they
are shown to be by the imposing operations in this
New Hampshire bank
Mr. B. said he would next turn his attention to
the circular of the Clinton Bank, as he thought
it was nearly allied to this branch of the inquiry
By this paper it appears that that bank, on the
6th of this month, (Apnl,) directed such of the
receivers of public moneys as deposited with it,
not to receive, after the 20th, the notes of any of
the banks in the State of Ohio, other than the
deposit banks, unless thereafter instructed to that
effect by that institution.
In 1833, the notes of the Ohio State banks, with
few, if any exceptions, were received without
condition in payment of all debts or revenue in
that State. This, it seems, is no longer the case
A n abrupt and extraordinary change is made, and
I will presently speak of the oppressive influence
of the change both on the people and the banks
of Ohio. At present, I allude to it for the pur-
pose of showing the derangement of dom* stic
exchange, and the erroneous calculations of
Messrs Taney and Woodbury. I here again
invite the House to call to mind the particular
passages which have been already quoted from
the íeports of the two Secretaries.
The first reason assigned in the circular for this
measure is, that it " is difficult and expensive to
convert the notes of these banks into funds re-
ceivable by the Treasury Department in the east-
ern cities Why is this s > This objection did
not exist in former years What kind of funds
can the Secretary require in the eastern cities?
Nothing, surely, beyond gold or silver Do not
all the banks in Ohio pay gold or silver for their
notes on demand' Ceitainly Are not many of
them of old and well-established credit, and pos-
sessed of large capital? \es; and in all these
particulars, several of them stand highoi than the
one which is now dictating terms In saying this
I do not mean to impeach the credit of the Clin-
ton Bank; but I think it right to call the attention
of the House to the fact, that this institution,
now exercising the power derived from the Tieas-
ury Department, is among the youngest banks in
the State, having been incorporated in 1833-34,
and its capital, as reported by the Secretary, being
only §289,000.
It will be observed that this bank does not de-
cline taking the notes of the othei institutions in
payment ot Us own debts Then why are they
rejected foi those of the Government? The
answer may be gathered from the cnculat The
banks are uifoimed that their piper shall not be
taken for the public debts, unless they will con
sent to redeem it by drafts on New York, Phila-
delphia, or Biltimoie, payable thirty dajs after
date at par' The leason for dictating these terms
is thus given-
" Instances occur d-uh of eastern funds being convertid
at a profit into the paper of the local bank , which is paid
into the land office* , and the burden of converting the
paper again into eastern funds is thrown upon the institu
tions receiving the public money "
Now, sir, on whom should the burden rest (if
it be such) but on the deposit banks?   They
have the great and extraordinary advantage and
profit incident to the enormous amount of public
deposits on which they are operating; and the
only consideration which they give for this  is
the engagement to transfer the public money as
the necessities of the Government requne.    But
it seems they begin already, in an indirect way, ,
to demand new teims     If their contracts  are j
onerous, they are afraid to avow it, and seek to
defer the evil day by an attempt to ca-.t the loss
or inconvenience on the other institutions who
have no portion of the profits     But believing, as
1 do, that these deposit banks are deriving great
advantages fiom the use of the public money,
for which they make no adequate return, then
present movement creates a just fear that they
design still to increase these advantages by seem-
ing the circulation of their own notes and a like
contiol over the exchange of the country     They
begin this by discrediting the Ohio notes, and
finding this tolerated, and that they have  the
power to " create and destroy," they will soon,
in turn, discredit the notes of the banks of othei
States, which they are now introducing among
us    If,asMr Woodbury says, " the facilities in
domestic exchange were probably nevei greater
or at so moderate rates," whence originates the
state of things disclosed by this circular?   " East-
ern funds bung converted daily ata profit into
the paper of the local banks'"    But mark the
balance of the sentence• the deposit bank does not
complain of the buiden of converting the paper
I  of the Ohio banks into gold and silvei, (which
|| the Government is bound to íeceive,) but of the
burden of converting it into  "eastern funds1"
Here lies the rub '    This is the unwelcome truth
which the Secretary must at last acknowledge.
But in order to stifle and conceal it from public
view as long as possible, the independent Ohio
banks are to be forced to incur the loss and ex-
pense of furnishing eastern funds for the Treas-
ury, under the   penalty of having their notes
discredited.    I hold, subject to the use of all who
wish to refer to it, a tabular statement of the
condition of all the Ohio banks; and I aver that
they are as sound, and possessed of as ample
means to answei  all demands against them, as
the  banks  of any other State in this Union
Their proportion of specie to paper circulation is
probably greater than that of the banks of most
of the States
This measure is unjust and oppressive; the
terms are dictated—not proposed as matters of
negotiation—but absolutely dictated as a sine qua
non The banks aie required to íedeem their
notes, not in gold and silver, but by drafts on
New Yoik, Philadelphia, or Baltimore, at thirty
days from date, at pai ' This, sn , is but insult
and mockery' In the present stale of exchange
between Ohio and those cities, it is far bettei to
have their notes returned home upon them, than
to redeem them on the terms thus offi red The
deposit bank complains of the buiden of collecting
the public money; and yet Mr. Woodbuiy says-
" I his Department tikes pleasure in stating ll it the
public inon v continue!, to be collect'd ind deposited,
umk r the pre em system ot selected binks, with gre it oa>-e
iml economy in all cases, and with greater, in some, than
at my former period "
The Secretaiy or the bank is wrong, both can-
not be coriect, foi their statements are totally
inconsistent
But this power over the domestic exchange of
the country has been frequently pronounced a
dangerous one, which requires to be constantly
and vigilantly guarded Mr Woodbury ex-
pressed and urged this opinion in his first annual
repoit as Secretary of the Treasury, and there
quotes, with appiobation, the following passage
fiom the lite Secretary Crawford
" It is the e-tablishment of the principle, and not the
imnunt of the exaction, which will exhibit the poner of
the bank to lay contnbu'ions on the commerce of the
nation ad libitum "
And having used this argument against the
Bank of the United States, Mr Woodbury finds
his new system subject to the same objection,
but attempts to impaii its foice, and says that—
"Under a system of only detached and independent
State banks, the community "ill be relieved from the dan-
ger and injuues to nhich it would be exposed under a
¡; e iteombinedsohtaiv power ofaimjleinMitution seeking
olten to control and monopolize, it is ftarcd solely for ita
own enhanced emoluments, the whole business of ex-
change, both foreign and domestic
I agree, sir, that this power over the exchange
of the countiy is an important and dangerous
one, no matter wheie it is held It is a fallacious
distinction, a meie subterfuge, to say it is not
susceptible of abuse when held by a combination
of State banks It is in vain to call them " de-
I tached and independent" after they have formed
a league If thebe deposit banks cannot exercise
this oppressive and dangerous power—if no one
of them can seek and monopolize the exchange
business solely for its own enhanced emoluments,
wherefore has the Clinton Bank the power to
prescribe terms, in regard to debts due the Gov-
ernment, which secuie the exclusive control over
i the circulation and exchange of the State? The
terms prescubed are onerous, unjust, and op-
pressive. But, for a moment, concede them to
I be fan, they are dictated, and assume the power
of imposition1 What then becomes of the prin-
ciple laid down by Mi Ciawfoid, and quoted
with so much appiobation by Mr Woodbury?
Suppose these terms are met and complied with,
what prevents another and another imposition,
until the o'her banks shall be hteially persecuted
and oppressed out of existence, and the entne
and exclusive control is obtained by the deposit
banks ovei the en dilation and exchange ? Ihen,
su, "this community" will discover, "it is
feared," that it was not " íeheved from the dan-
ger and in]uiies to which it was exposed lindera
great and combined power," (not, however, of
a sin°le institution with numerous blanches,
but) of about foi ty "detached and independent
banks," extended into eveiy section of the coun-
try, acting in concerted system under a great
central viceroy at Washington, who at this mo-
ment is shrouded in greater mystery than the
secret mover of Maelzel's chess-player. But this
viceroy has a viceroy over him, and the enor-
mous money power of this nation is now con-
trolled by a single hand ' Were the liberties of
the nation in danger under the former system,
they are now doubly so'
The capital of the Bank of the United States
was «35,000,000, and this was divided and used
bv the bank and its twenty-three branches The
public deposits rarely exceeded five million dol-
lars, and were soon called for in the discharge of
the public debt and expenditures. Thus it rarely
happened that the money powei, admitting the
danger of its abuse, exceeded forty millions. But
behold the contrast'   The combined capital of
