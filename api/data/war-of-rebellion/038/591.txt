OFFICE OF CHIEF OF SUBSISTENCE, SECOND DISTRICT,

Vicksburg, MISS., January 20, 1863.

Captain D. H. THOMAS, Post Quartermaster:

DEAR SIR: I must again call your attention to the necessity of constructing the commissary warehouses without longer delay. Large quantities of corn and other stores will be arriving, and it is absolutely necessary to have protection for them as soon as landed, to prevent loss and damage. About twenty-five kegs nails are required, and as a portion of the lumber is now here, and the balance will be here in a few days, I hope you will attend to having it carried to the place where the houses are to be erected at once. I will give you carpenters, and render any and all assistance in my power; but as I cannot control transportation, I must call on you to do so.

T. B. REED,

Major and Chief of Subsistence.

[Major J. G. DEVEREUX:]

I have purchased about 40,000 bushels of corn, now on the bank of the river, a great deal of which, however, owing to a want of steamboat transportation, will be lost from rot by exposure to recent rains. I have contracted for 100,000 pounds bacon, 100,000 pounds flour, and 1,000 bushels of salt. Government salt will be shipped to this point in large quantities if transportation from the mines in Iberia to the Mississippi River can be obtained, but this is doubtful.

Very respectfully,

T. B. REED,

Major and Chief of Subsistence.

P. S. -I have just received per steamboat T. D. Hine, now at the landing, 107,467 pounds of salt, 40,166 pounds of flour, 2,738 pounds lard, 6,556 pounds bacon, and 460 hogs, averaging 200 pounds.
