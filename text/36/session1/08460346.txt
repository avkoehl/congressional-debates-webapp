The Tariff—Mr, Longnecker.
Ho. or Reps.
State, and almost the entire North, are without
remunerative employment. The farmer has no
longer the high price for his produce that a local,
labor-paid, consuming population would give him.
To the repeal of the tariff of 1842, and the inaugu-
ration of a new revenue system, based upon a
revenue standard alone, and assessed in such
form as to enable the importer to defraud the Gov-
ernment of its duties, and flood the country with
foreign merchandise at little cost, is to be ascribed
the present evils of the country—thus destroying
our own manfactories, the home market for our
agricultural products, and loading our people with
a foreign debt.
If wc cease to purchase from abroad to a greater
amount than we sell, manufacture ourselves what
we consume, (thereby furnishing a home market
for agricultural productions, instead of subjecting
them to heavy costs of transportation, and steady
and remunerative employment for our laboring
men, mechanics, and artisans,) our difficulties and
embarrassments, it seems to me, would speedily
be removed.
I assert it as a fact, which is proved by the his-
tory of the past, that we have always been more
prosperous as a people; business interests never
flourished more; a greater demand for labor has
always existed under a high than under alow scale
of duties upon foreign imports.
Under the operation of the protective tariff of
1812, during the war with Great Britain and the
continuance of the embargo and non-intercourse
acts, we imported nothing. We were compelled
to manufacture our own goods, and the farmer to
rely upon a home market for his produce, e^ept
those who were venturesome enough to have their
products run the gauntlet of the enemy's cruisers;
What was the result? Notwithstanding our coun-
try was encircled by enemies, and parts of it swept
by fire and sword, it gradually accommodated
itself to the change, and our people increased in
prosperity as, apparently, our national difficulties
augmented. The blow fell heavily at lirst upon
the shipping interests, owing to the danger of
capture; out they, too, in time, recovered; and the
capital invested in the carrying trade was grad-
ually transferred to manufacturing. And amid the
dm of arms and the rattle of spindles, we struggled
along till our enemies were driven from ourshores.
The commencement of the war showed us the evil
of our revenue system, and how utterly incapa-
ble we were, without manufactures, to rely upon
ourselves amid such unfortuitous circumstances.
We had no goods to clothe and keep our people
warm; no powder nor iron to cool our enemies.
The closc of the war found us with supplies of
all, and in better condition in every way to con-
tinue the contest, than at the commencement of
the struggle. True, it did not leave our men
clothed in broadcloth, nor our women in silks.
These luxuries had to give place to a homelier,
but no less serviceable, attire, in the form of lin-
sey woolscy coats and gowns, while wool hats
became thick as blackberries in June. Yet, with
all these inconveniences, in all the essential ele-
ments of prosperity and strength as a people we
had attained a much higher standard. We had
demonstrated to the world that we were able to
rely upon ourselves, requiring 110 material from
abroad either to answer the purpose of defense
in a military or civil point; that we could manu-
facture all our material of war, as well as that
which we required for our use and comfort as a
people in time of peace.
The tariff of 181G, which repealed that of 1812,
was one which rather favored free trade, and had
few of the essential elements of protection in it.
Under it the country was flooded with foreign
goods; and the manufactures that had sprung up
under that of 1812, and during the war, were de-
stroyed almost at a blow. Universal distress and
desolation followed it. Real estate, which had
ripen in value during the prosperous days of man-
ufacturing, fell to less than half its value; and
thousands were made bankrupt who had invested
their means either in this or in manufactures.
But under the benign and salutary influences of
the tariffs of 1824 and 1828, which were protective
in their features, and the duties in a great degree
specific, prosperity agairpsmiled upon our beloved
country. The spindles again began to play; prop-
erty advanced m value; the farmer found a mar-
ket, and the laborer employment. The tariff of
1832 followed, but continued so short a time that
its cffccts upon the country and its interests were
not so apparent. Then followed the tariff of 1833,
generally denominated the compromise act, which
was a free-trade act, although many of the duties
were specific, yet so low as to afford no adequate
protection. The history of that tariff, its effects
and consequences, is probably in the recollection
of almost every member of this body. Under it
4he business of the country gradually languished;
the manufacturing interests of the country were
again destroyed, and the countiy was drained of
spccie to pay foreign indebtedness. By the ex-
pansion of the banking system, paper money sup-
plied its place; and finally the crash of 1837 came; I
the banks suspended specie payments, and uni- '
versal bankruptcy followed. Most of the active,
enterprising business men of the country suc-
cumbed to this storm, and could only be relieved
by a bankrupt law, which Congress shortly after
passed.
Then came the tariff of 1842, a wholesome, sub-
stantial protective act, under which the prostrated
business of the country not only revived in the
short spacc of the four years of its existence, but
attained a prosperity which it never knew be-
fore, and has never known since. The specie,
which, under the act of 1833, had been gradually
exported from the country to pay for goods im-
ported,-commenced flowing back like a lava tide,
and the hum of universal prosperity was all around
us. Manufactures of every kind sprung up, fur-
nishing a home market for the produce of the
farmer, and employment for the laborer at remu-
nerative wages. Wc were again sailing on under
prosperous and balmy gales, and smiling plenty
had supplied the place of misery and want; but.
the time was short. In an evil hour the genius
of destruction was again at work, and the hun-
gry manufacturers of our old enemy across the
water, through their emissaries, were poisoning
the fountains of our political fabric. The cry of
Polk, Dallas, and the tariff of 1842 was but the
voice of the siren that lulled the good people of
the Keystone State into a fatal sleep. She cast
her vote for Polk and Dallas, and they were
elevated to the highest offices in the gift of the
people; but the pledges made were never re-
deemed. Almost one of the first acts of that Ad- ]
ministration, that was elevated to powerupon the [
faith of the pledge that the tariff should remain |
intact, was to rept/al it and supplant it with that
of 3846, m which the duties were much lower,
and were to be levied, by a certain percentage,
according to the value of the goods in the ports
from whence they were shipped. The effects of
this tariff were not at first so apparently disas-
trous; and for that reason the more destructive,
because of its continued undeveloped mischief.
Under that act, from the stimulus given to manu-
factures under that of 1842, there was at first
but little change; but gradually our difficulties in-
creased, and could be likened to the strong horse
breasting the current of the swift stream—main-
tains Ins position for awhile, but, as his strength
fails, gradually yields and floats with the tide.
So with the country in 184G; she breasted the
tide of that tariff for a while, but gradually
yielded, and was washed into the whirlpool of
1857, and went down.
Some attribute this crisis to the effects of the
tariff of 1857; but no candid mind, who will ex-
amine the matter with reference to the workings
of our revenue system, can fail to discover that it
was owing to the workings of the tariff of 1846.
This crisis would have come much sooner had it
not been for the $60,000,000 of gold annually that
we were enabled to dig from the mines of Califor-
nia, to pay for our over imports of foreign goods.
Besides, the tariff of 1857 had not time to com-
plete this wholesale havoc in this short space of
time. Next in order came the tariff of 1857, re-
ducing the schedules of that of 1846 still lower,
and that under the recommendation of a Demo-
cratic Administration and a Democratic majority
in the Senate. This act, now in turn, we pro-
pose to repeal, and substitute for it the bill before
the House. This, I think, is a true record of th j
workings of these different tariff acts; and no one
can fail to acknowledge the position I assumed, in
stating that we were more prosperous under a
high protective rate of duties than we ever were
under a lower scale, and that the same is also
true of the workings of specificduties,in compar-
ison with ad valorem ones. Again, under specific
and fairly protective duties, the revenue is not sub-
ject to such constant fluctuations as it is under
the ad valorem and low duty policy. Under the
latter, the Treasury is at one time gorged to re-
pletion with a surplus, and at another, depleted
so much as to be unable to meet the current ex-
penses of Government. When the latter state of
things exists, the whole financial system of the
country will be out of balance. To preserve an
equable state is a universally acknowledged desid-
eratum.
The following table will show the state of the
revenue, under the different tariff acts, and estab-
lishes what has just been said in regard to its fluc-
tuations:
