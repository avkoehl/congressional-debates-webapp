to be permitted to visit them. Every comfort compatible with their condition shall be given them, and most surely every protection extended to them. This having been the course of the Confederate States adopted toward its prisoners since the commencement of the present war, I could not if I wished act otherwise.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

General S. COOPER, Adjutant and Inspector General.

SIR: * * * By direction of the Secretary of War I have already offered Lieutenant William G. Jones, Tenth Infantry, of Flag-Officer Goldsborough for Lieutenant Sayre of the Marine Corps, now on parole. General Wood also agrees to receive 147 wounded prisoners, via James River, at such time as may be agreed upon. I notify General Winder.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

BENJ. HUGER,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF NORFOLK,Norfolk, Va., January 17, 1862.

General S. COOPER, Adjutant and Inspector General.

SIR: * * * A late letter from General Wool states he had requested that Colonel Hoffman should be given for Colonel Bradford, of North Carolina, whereas we shall offered Brevet Colonel Chandler, Third Infantry. What reply shall I give?

B. H[UGER].

[Indorsement.]

Inform General Huger that Colonel Hoffman is of higher rank than Colonel Bradford, who was merely a brevet or temporary colonel of twelve-months' volunteers, not even equal in rank to Brevet Colonel Chandler who was given in exchange. We can only give a full colonel like Hoffman for an officer of equal grade.

Adjutant-G[eneral].

SIR: I inclose herewith copy of a letter receive form Major General John E. Wool, on the evening of January 20.
