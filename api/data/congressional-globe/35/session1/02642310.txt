May 22,
ADMISSION OF THE MINNESOTA MEMBERS.
Mr. H-lRitIS, of Illinois. I now call for the
regular order of business.
The SPEAKER. The pending question is upon
the motion of Mr. Kelsey to be excuscd from
voting upon the motion of Air. Morgan to be ex-
cused from voting on the motion of Mr. Grow
to lay the whoiu subject on the table.
Mr. GROW. As these reports have been
printed now, I withdraw my motion to lay on the
table. I suppose that will carry with it the motions
tp be excused from voting.
The SPEAKER.. The gentleman has the right
to withdraw hia motion.
The motion was accordingly withdrawn.
The SPEAKER. The question recurs upon
the motion of the gentleman from Indiana to lay
upon the table the motion of the gentleman from
Ohio, to reconsider the vote by which the main
question was ordered.
Mr. CLEMENS. I hope all these dilatory mo-
tions will bo withdrawn.
Mr. SHERMAN, of Ohio. I withdraw the
motion to reconsider.
The question then recurred upon the resolution
reported by the majonty of the committee.

Tue election was held throughout tne Mate, u? oe.e (hs- ■
tiiet, in eouloiiouv with ilie loieuom^ piovi-ion. j
Tins, it 15 contended; is in contravesu:on ot the second 1
i" section of the act of June 25,1842. and the election is there-
i'ose void. That section is as follows :
" That in every case when a rfuite is entitled to more
than aw Representative, tlie number to which each fckate
shall be entitled undei this apportionment shall he elected
by uiotrict;..composed of contiguous terntory. equal in num-
ber to the number of ilepre^entatives to which said State
may be entitled, no one di&tuet electing more than one Rcp-
ie>entative."
It will be observed that, by the tetms of this law, it was
to apply only to " this apportionment," to wit, that of I84'2;
but should it be held othei vvi-^e, it is conceived that its effect
has been already settled. The obligation of this act was
brought in q notion by the next Cot>gre&s alter it was passed,
m a contest of the seats and the members returned fioin the
States of New llampshne, Georgia, Mississippi, arid Mis-
souri ; anil the Committee of Elections-, to whom the sub-
ject was icfened, reported a ievolution, as follows :
'• Resolved, That the section of4 An act for the apportion-
ment ot Representatives among; the seveial States according
to the sixth census,1 appiovcd June 1812, is not a law
made in puisuancc of the Constitution of the United States,
and valid, opeiativc, arid binding upon the States.3'
Upon the question ot the admission of the members of the
Btato? named, which had ^o elected their Representatives
bv general ticket, and not in aecoidance with the law, it
wa- decided in the afrhm.itive by — a\ es 127, noes 57. This
disposition of the question ha  oevei been di.-tuibed, al-
though members elected und(r the general ticket sy.-tem
have been upon this floor (with the exception, it is believed,
ol thiee CoiigiehScs) ever since, and without objection. It
seems now too late to leopen tin' question.
Theie seems to be but one question of any impoitanee re- j
maimug. and tins grows outof the fact thatthe constitution i
01 iMmne.sOt.i pio\;di.s for the election of'tliiee ineuibei.s to i
the House of Repie.-,cntaiives, while, by the act for the ad- i
mis.-iou ot the State,if is entitled to but two. Tue neht of j
Minnesota to hold an election puoi to the admi>-aon of the ,
State ha;, alieady been considered,audits leaahty,uj>on the j
admins-ion of tlx; State, has been shown. Uo'js the act of j
Congte-s cutting down the number poipo.ed in t!ie coijsii- |

The ptovi-iou <>f the constitution of Minnesota for the
e'ettion of mi nibet-, to the llou-e of Ue[He^entatives wa-
appio\ed by the act of admission, but the mimbei \.as in

The claimant is forbidden to taJse his seat under that cer-
tificate—
1. By a gieat eonstmitional principle; and
2. Bv a plain rule ot election law.
The Territory or Minne&ofa was organized in 1849, and in
1857 the people weie authorized to form a constitution pre-
paratory to admission into the Union, and it was declared
they should be entitled to one Reprc tentative, and as many
more as then population might show them entitled to ac-
coidmg to the pie ent uitio.
The ceitificate show#the election to have been held on
the 13th of October, 1857.
No census had then been taken and returned , but one
bad been partially taken and returned, showing a popula-
tion of about oa*; hundied and Thirty-four thousand.
On the 13th oi October—(the same day the people of Min-
nesota voted on and adopted their constitution)—there was
no law of the United States assigning to Minnesota any
number of Repiesentatives; on that day there was no State
of Minnesota in existence known to the laws,; the people
'of the Tomtoiy were then engaged in voting, undei a law
of Congtess, (or the government of the Territory, on a con-
stitution which that iaw declaied to be, m terms, prepara-
toiy to admission into the Union. Tiie United States mar-
shal still kept the peace of the Teiritorv, and still executed
the process of the Teiritoty. The courts of the Teiritoiy
still adiium-ueied the laws of the United States m the Terri-
to'y ; the Governor appointed by the President still held the
only executive power ;eco<;ntzed m the Territory ; the L e-
gi-ialuie of iMmne>ota still was the only legal Legislature.
These things so continued until the llth day of May, 1858,
when, by law of that date, Minne-ota becmne a State.
The Supieme Comt have a.ded our reasoning by their
rulings, and they have rc-olved that under the Constitution
the teintoiial hiw<j and authouties continue exclusively in
foice m the Teiiuorv untd the passage ot the act of admis-
sion. and then cc a-e— (McMilly rs. P^uly, 10 Howard, 77.)
It i < theieioie clear that the certificate ib decisive against
the claim of \V. XV Phelps ; for it shows the claim To icst
on an election in a Teuitoiy of tiie United States, which
was an act of u-uipation. m its nature punishable, and ab-
roluteh void. Tt was, and could be, by no law of the State,
I foi it was befote the State exu-ted at all. It could not be
: valid by u tei titonal law, lor a Terntoiy cannot elect inem-
1 beis of Congiess. It is nonsense io talk of unification by
! the subsequent admission of the State, (or, till admis<ion,
i the State was nothing. It war- created at fhe moment of ad-
I mr^ion ; and it is a universal principle that, if an election
be without legal authority when made, it is absolutely void,
and cannot be made valid by an\ subsequent law ; for that
is equivalent to naming the people's lepiesentatives by iaw,
without an election at all.
In the absence of law, the claimant ha< no light, and the
electors have paited with some of their lights.
If one oi t w o siippo-ed pi coed cut:- be cited, it is sufficient
to -a\- tb.it pieet,iJcills (oi such a tlasrant usuipanon as the
nam ng the iJep'Oscnranves of a State by a vote of the
