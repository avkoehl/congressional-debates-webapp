Gentlemen on the opposite side vem to think
that then, wa no efficient capital, or efficient u*e of
it, before the introduction of banks of discount and
circulation, as it lands, houses, specie, cattK, mer-
chandise, and produce, did not exist, constitute so-
lid capital, and lead to prosperity in Assyria,
Egypt, and Carih*ge, not to name Rome or
Greece, as gready and gloriously before banks ej-
tsted as since—is if England, before William lit,
(the era when modern banking there began,) or
France before 1805, had nei her capital, i or pros
penty, nor grandeur—as if tne United States them
selves were nothing betore 1791 or 1783—and a
if, without the introduction cf bank here during
the last half ce itury, the iace ot Wasrm gt in, ¿n 1
Franklin, and Hancock, which had betc^e dr.ven
bacs the batoanan, subdued the lore t, and con-
quere! mdt perdence fiom tne migiuest n ou^rchy
on tne globe, woul 1 have degeneia'ed, without the
introduction or. banks—as u their glorious country
would not hate continued to n.¡sh for.vatd m its
career of splendor without much (ii any) less rapid
strides in ei her wealth, population, intelligence,
virtue, or power, without banks, than it had done
before without th- i.
The idea is preposterous No. Our b s' capi-
tal—beyond our abundant arid fertue soil with
Us rich crops, our gigauic lakes, and long navi-
gable streams, with all our vast  'g<-icu,fural,
manufacturing, and commercial resources—etn-
sists ot a free and intelligent and moral peo-
ple, with their liberal constitutions and equal
laws
If, with all these, we have cont nued to advance
by large strides, it is nut easy to say whether they
have been more or less rap d in con eqaence of
banks But some, not very unphilrs phical in
th<"ir reseaichesor views, Lave supposed that our
progress hiis been rapid in spite of banks as well
as in spi'eof jellow fevers, choleras, conftagIations,
and inundations, and that on a broad view, banks,
no more than these, beciu e a'ttndant on oui
career, have been the eauve of its brilliancy and
grandeur.
Making then, at this moment, sog at an addi-
tion to the pie entlarge bank cam'al is likely, in-
stead of becoming a bWing to the country as a
who e, to prove ,■• mmsilfd web ot «eal and wo,
and to turn ihe scales in tie end decidedly against
the measure
Look a moment at tne lessonaof experience, on
the blessings of tms kind oí banks ot teige capital
and laige i ,sueo Have they prevenid, or rather
did they no* cause the expansions ot 1795, aid tne
contractions and disasters ¡h¿t followed'! 0 a they
prevent th> distress ot 1807 and 1809, rarer tne
first United States Bank? Did they pi event 'be

per-sel slate of the\alue of almost evety iescuption of the
whole massof propel y ot the hado t which has o i an avtiage,
sunk not less than 11 fly por cent within a lewyeais
Indeed, tit t to uwell on these vario is p ctures of
\vr tthtdne sand rum tha lolloped in tne tr^m of
the secoud Ban , libit cordeu tact, in the report
to the other House in 1832, that quite five and a
half millions ot iht capital itself of the Bank was
irretrievably lost, ot v% hi"h we owned one-seventh ,
and all toe dividends for two or three years, soon
alter it commenced business
Did the second Bank again, in 1825, avert al-
most unexa-npted bankruptcies' Or, in 1834, did
it mitigate, or ratt.ei not produce, the panic and
suffering which were represented to agonize the
country' Or, in 1836, did it check, or rather not
stimulate, the expans ons and overtrading which
led to an "\ccss of sixty millions imports over the
prior year, and tms oíoducd the revulsion in cre-
dit, and the export of specie, thn cau ed mest o'
the bank  in 1837 to 'u-peud, and the whole com-
munity to be overwhelmed wi h debt and insol-
vency'
Now the de'uion seem, to be, tnat, by making
another Bank—tbjugh on the ba is of th->t, yet in
■T-any  i spec s   more exposed to abuse—we art- to
|  ^et rid ot ail the  evi1    n  us  tram—evils   which
¡i   'iai>   so   recen'y  clos "t Us   turbid  care r,   ,t is
feared, m hopeless barkrupc), maned Amencin
i   credit abroad, and covered numerous firesid s wiih
desolation
Of «hat use is it to denounce the officers of
that mstitut on as charldtans, or to exult that the
connection between them and the Government had
been severed befo,e its final explosion when we
hasten now to reinstate their \ictous svstem of
banking, with seme additional peiils, and proclaim
it not only as the great guide in forming this, but
have repeated m its favor here all the boastful but
exploded pretensions— as to M equalizing ex
chang-s restoring a uniform currency over the
whole country, aid bringing immediate relief to all
classes—which emanated so constantly from the
vanity, the pertness, ihe rashne s, that low; pre
sided over its destinies, and eventually sowed the
seeds of iv ruin'
Another proud claim in behalf of the former
National Banks, as well as this one, is their influ-
ence to prevent defaults and lo'se* of the public
money Bu , in pc in of I cf, our own records
siow that the last Bank, and the former one, so

proport'on to he T-oncy collected and disbur'ed,than

of the Government Beride i' i , more losses have
happened by 'ingle offi ers in baoKS,to 'heir lock-
hikltls, in numerous c?ses, the fast few yew ,
than by all the deposit - Stat  banks combined as
depositories >inc 1789 There i=-, liso, another
misapprehepsion on this subject, common to many
gentlemen on th<- other side of the house.   It is,
that the losses of unavailable unds in the Trea-
sury, to the extrnt of more than a million, hap-
pened urid' r the old pet bank system, from 1811 to
1816 or under the more recent one from 1833 to
1840 But cur íecords show that not a dollar of
the oublic depotites was probably lost under ei'her
of them, though some delay and inconvenience
hJve b en caused by the suspension of several of
the State bank depo itoru The old failures of
the"i, that have ended in ascertained losses, were
after 1816, and between that and 18¿7, m the full
tide oí the Umte 1 States Bank
An ther lautased dangt r, lather than relief, by
the power to 'oan in the present bill this large ca-
pital . nd the deposites, will arise from lending out
at hazard, not tnlj the $10,000,000 or $16,000,000
oí United States capital, but its daily means—the
caneni deposites ot the revenue How can this
be justified by genilemen on the other side, who in
1834 denounced even the accommodations recom-
mended to merchants ¿lone, in conformity to eariy
practice They now urge loans to all, restricting
none, howevei gambling, or speculating, or politi-
cal, except members of Congress, excluded on our
motion, and in all amounts, except to directors
and officers, and they now bcenoe, if not sanction,
even donations of the public funds to every favo-
nio except these officers.
However great were their horror at the partiali-
ty which might be connected, at. they supposed,
with the loans of the public money in 1834 and
1835, and huwever they may have joined in 1840
m rendering; it penal for any public officer to loan
a dollar of that money, and have repeated the p'o-
hibitinn at this very =essnn, in another bill; yet,
by tne present one, they encourage directly the re-
ver  , and p'ace the leturn of the public means in
p-nl of the vunds and waves, wherever the mer-
chant may have hazarded them in any quarter of
the globe, and in the various speculations in town
or city lob on mere paper, in new manufactures,
and countless other enterprises, where the most
hungry adventurers may, under the new credit
system, choose to expose them.
This is a specimen of the care which we exer-
cise in protectmg me people's own money, an 1
that current revenue on which depends our ability
to fa,hi promptly thepub'ic contracts and preserve
unbroken the public faith Would it not be much
more likely to bring relief to the people and the Go-
vernment, if se were cut loose from all banks, and
continue our present divoiceirom them unchanged,
except ss the Government, like individuals, might
find it useful or convenient in any particular case,
ir for any soecial object, to employ any of them
temporaril)'
Much less ought the Government <o encourage
banks of cite ila ion connected with large capital
and trading, as they have led to those expansions
and contractions in the cu.rcncy for halt acentu-
i},v>hic'\  t times, have desJated not only this
