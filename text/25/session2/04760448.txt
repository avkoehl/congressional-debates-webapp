CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
gress Hp had done nothing more, he could have done nothing
less So much for that part oí the cnculai which piolabas col
lectois and receiver from taking the bills of hanks issuing notes
ofa less denomination than fivedollars
The other part of the circulai which prohibits the receipt
of any bank notos of a less denomination than twenty
dollars, he thought was equally defensible It had been ad
muted, if not, it would not be denied, that no notes of a less
denomination than twenty dolíais could now be offered in pay
ment by the Government to itscieditors And not even that
denomination of papei, unless it were equivalent to specie at
the pld.ee wheii! disbuibed, and could be then converted into
specie at the will of the holdei This was the law of the land
It was no contuvance of the Secretaiy of the Treasury, but a
distinct andexplicitstatntory requisition He remaiked that the
deposite act of 1836 was a dead letter so fai as itielated to most
of the banks of the country
In Massachusetts, andm the State he in pait represented,
theie was not ¿single bank which could be selected as a public
depository consistently with the provisions ol the deposite act
oí July, 1836 They had i neap ici tat ed themselves iiom being
employed as places of deposite of the public money There
was not one of them but what had paid out bilh> of a less de
nomination than five dolíais since the «suspension of specie pay
ment They had done this, he was fiee to admit, fiom neces
sity, and with íegard to the public convenience But m doing
this, it could not be denied that they could not thereafter be se
iected as depo^itontb of the public rnonev The deposite act,
therefoic must have been íegarded by the SeciKary at the
time ol the issuing this new cnculai as, to a greit extent, in
opciative—certainly in his own State as, well as in every other
State of New E igland—as if it had nevei been passed, so
iai as it related to the employment of the local banks as public
t'cpositones Ihis, he piesumed., could hot be controverted
lie would then ask. what was the Secretaiy to do to prevent
bank paper to be taken of a less denomination than the law
authouzed tobe disbursed? Would he have been justified in
directing the collectors and íeceivers to take notes of a less de
nomination than twenty dollars? He would abk if such had
been theoidei, what would the íeceivers have done with this
descnption of paper? it could not have been disburse 1 con
ststently with the cxi&ting piovisionc of law1 If a papei of
a less denomination than twenty dollars should be oftlred m
payment by the agents of the Government to its public credi
tors the practice could not fail to have rrrtived, as it ha*? al
i ady receiv ed dining the piesent session, the marked condem
nation of tho&e who oppo e ih" Admimstiation Suchade
eruption of paper could not be placed on gepeial deposite to
the ciedit if theTreisurei because under the deposite act of
1836 no ¡state bank could be selected as a placo of deposite
The only course left for the receivers would have been to have
converted such a description of pappr at once into specie and
he was sure that no friend of the banks would say that such a
practice would operate to their advantage, oi would tend to pro
mote-their benefit
Ihe Secretary then m requiring of collector and receivers
not to take bank paper of a less denomination than twenty dol
iars, had acted with reference to the existing state of things, and
with reference to the existing law of the land He had autho
ri7cd the receipt of that descnption of paper money, which
alone could bedisbmsed He w11 knew that the bank*? weie
no longer the fiscal agents of the Government That the col
lectois of the customs, and the receivers at the land ofhees,
were chaiged with the duty of receiving and disbursing the
public money and it seemed to him t'iat there would be a most
claung absurdity in lequmng these public officers to take what
they could not disbuise—to receive notes ol a less denomina
tion than twenty dolíais, when, by the express tcims of the
statute, rn such paper money could be paid to any of die pub
1 c cieditors
This then was the head and the fiont of the Secietary s of
fence That by reason of the recent legislation of Congress, and
to secuie to the community the bench s of the joint íesolution of
1816 he had issued a geneial order to collectors andrcceirers
to takethat descnption ol papei,andthatonly,]Ubtifiedby exist
ting law, and the notes of those banks and of those
hanks only which the deposite act of 1836 permitted He
had done what the law authorized, and what it seemed the
law requiredhim todo, he had done nothing moie andif there
was cause of offence nwasnotto be traced to that act of the
Secietary of the Treasury, but to the positive enactments of
Congress
lit, wished to siy a word or two upon the proposition of the
Senator fiom Massachusetts He couid not believe that a ma
jonty ofeithei House of Congress would be found to legalize
theieceiptni bills of a less denomination than five dollars foi
the public clues touch a piopodition could find no fa/or with
him and he should be slow to believe that ( ongiess would by
its own legislation, exj e! fiom eiieuldtion the specie which the
existing p hey af the- Government ft as well calculated to keep
in circulation He believed that the Legislatuie of his own
¡state and theLegislitmesof dllthejNew Ln^Hml fetales,would
tee long piolubit the banks from, issuing bills of aiess dcnomi
n ition than five dolíais It was in his judgment greatly to be
■losnul The dtiectFeffect of such legislation would be to in
tioluceat once bpecie into luc-j latum for that desciqtnn of
pa ei The consequence of puchan improvement in the circu
latmg medium wouid be most sensibly felt by the laboring
clacses oí the community—a portion of our citizens moie likely
to bo mturcd than, any othci and much less able to beai lo s
th many other by a depreciated paper currency He hoped
theiefore asa maltei oí gteat public convenience, that Con
jUf'S as well as the State LegisUluies would, by their public
acts increase Üip specie and dimmish the paper cncnlation In
no way could this be done moi e effectually than to carry out the
policy of the deposite act ol 1836 The papei presented this
mornin" by the ¡senator fiom Massachusetts look to a departure
hem that policy All he would say was that he was wholly
opposed to the object avowed Nor was he of the opinion that
there wai any great inconvenience expenenced oi felt in Boston
by the importing merchants as things now existed lie had
read in one of the public journals of that city—¿journal not in
favor of the present Admimstiation—and he had received letters
from that city and he could not behove, íelywg on these
sources of information, that theie was much practical
cmbaitassment produced imong the mercantile commu
inly in consequence of the dtt of Tuly 1836, and of the
lecent Tieasury Order piohibiting the receipt for customs
of the notes of banks which had issued bil g of a le s de
nomination than five dolíais The Merchants Banks had
long since rebumed ppecie payments    He behoved that two ot
three other banks had, also, by a vote of their boai ds oí directors,
resumed specie payments for their liabilities, and, although the
Mei charts' Bank could not, under the deporte act of 1836, be
selected as a depository of the public money, having paid out
the notes of other corporations of a less denomination than five
dollars, yet that bank had not issued, since the passage of the
deposite act of 1836, its own bills of a less denomination thanfive
dolíais The notes, therefore, of that bank were receivable for
public dues, and, since its resumption of specie payments, he
believed that more than two hundred thousand dolíais had ac
tually been paid into the Custom House for duties of the bills ef
that institution He was advised, and veuly believed, that eve
ry possible accommodation was afforded to the mercantile coin
munity by that institution He, therefore, was not aware of&ny
special inconvenience that was felt by the mercantile commu
nity by reason of the prohibitions mentioned in the act of July,
1836, and he certainly eould not agree to any change of the poli
cy as manifested by that statute In his own State there were
twenty seven banks—all, with the exception: of two, had issued,
and still continued to ísssue, their own notes ol a less denomina
tion than five dollars, and those two had paid, m the course of
then business, other bank paper of a less denomination than
five dollars The two banks to which he referred—one
at Portsmouth the other at Concord—had not issued
their own paper of a less denomination than five dolíais,
and theie could be ho doubt that the bills of the Commercial
Bank at Poi temouth, and of the Mechanics Bank atConcoid,
if he was not mistaken as to their course, would be received ior
the Government dues, ard it was equally clear that the bills of
all the other banks could not be íeceived, without an entire de
paituie from the act of July 1836 They had not been le
ceived at any time since the passage of that act and they w ould
not be hereafter received, because they would not desist from
issuing bills of a small denominauon It was more for then
interest to pursue this course than to have then paper received
for Government dues Andpoit was with a gieat proportion
of the hanks of Massachusetts lint while he was wholly
opposed to any material change of the pro\ isions of the act of
183b, he would have no objection to placing all the banks upon
the same gtound He would say to them all, if hereafter
you will cease to issue oi to pay out bills of a less denomina
tion than five dollars, he would agree to receive their paper
for customs and foi lands Beyond this he would not go Be
yond this, with a view" to the practical convenience of the
importing merchants, he did not believe it was necessary to go
He hoped, therefore, that the future legislation of Congress, in
i elation to this matter, would be so directed,'as to add to, not di
mimsh, the specie circulation of the countiy,
Mr BUCHANAN observed that it could not be denied that,
under the operation of existing laws, there was now a total
disconnection between the Government and the banks, even if
they resumed specie payments The separation was complete
and entire so far as that the Government could not employ
any banking institutions which have issued notes under five
dolíais, and this fact ought tobe known to the country and to
Congress because the banks themselves had produced the
separation, even in case they resume There might be a few
solitary exceptions, but he had heard of no bank in the coun
try with the exception of these of Missoun and Arkansas,
which had not either isshed small notes of its own, or paid out
those lfssued by other banks or corporations None of the
banks of Pennsylvania had issued notes of less than five
dollars, but they had geneially paid out notes issued by other
corporations, and therefore, by the deposite act, they became
disqualified as public depositories
[Mr PRESTON here interrupted Mr B to say that none of
the bankb of South Carolina had issued or paid out notes under
five dollars j
Mr BLCHANAN resumed The question now was as to
renewii g the connection between the Government and the
banks He did not think he should vote foi a bill to renew the
connection Theie was another question íait-ed by the Senator
from Massachusetts, and that was relative to the difference
between banks which have issued notes undei five dollars, and
those which have only paid out such notes issued by others
He did not thmk there was any difference in point ot morality
oi propriety Mi B said he never would agree to repeal the
provision referred to entirely, but, for the sake of giving the
banks time to resume, he would be willing to suspend its
openit in for a time—say to the 6th of Octobei next
Mi WEBtolER believed that the interdiction after the bth
October next would be the most pernicious measure that couid
be adopted in the event of a resumption
Mr feMITH of Indiana said he rose simply to coi íect a state
ment of the Senator from Pennsylvania, that the banks ofall the
btates, except Missoun and Arkansas, íeceived oi paid out
notes, of a less denomination than fivedollars He believed the
lemaik was incorrect, go far as the banks of the State of Indi
ana were concei ned Those banks ai e not authorized by their
chaiteis to issue notes of a less denomination than five dolíais
and the law of the State prohibits the issue or circulation of
small notes under a penalty He had heard of no instance m
which the banks of Indiana had laid themselves liable to be
placed under the icstriction of the recent circular whenever
they shall resume specie payments, noi did he believe such to
be the fact So far therefore as Indiana was concerned, the
repeal of the late circular would operate most favorably ho
had no doubt But still he was satisfird that the new ciicular
had manifested that justice to the other States required that the
restriction should be íepealetf, at least so far as to authorize
the receipt of the notes of all specie paying bankb that shall
not, after a given time, issue notes of a less denomination than
five dolían He felt, as at piesentadvised deposed to go that
fai but he had yet to be satisfied that it would be good policy
to encourage the l^sue of notes of a less denomination than five
doliat he would, however, not anticipate the argument on
that question
Mi BUf HANAN was glad to hear what the Senator from
Indiana had stated in regard to the banks of his State Then
there were three States m the Union Indiana Missouri, and
Aikansss where the banks had not taken the advantage of the
suspension to give out sm ill netes
Mi STRANGE hoped the Senator from Pennsylvania would
allow him to correct him so far as the banks of Noith Carolina
were concerned The banks of his State had rever issued shin
plasters at all and their lowest issues were in notes of three
doUarb
Mr BUCHANAN said the Senator fiom Noith Carolina need
not have risen to correct hurí as the issue of notes of three dol
lais by (he banks of his State, disqualified them, under the de
posite law    Mr   B   believed that the banks weie generally
able to resume, and dispense with the issue of small notes,
and that all they wanted was a httle time There might be
some who would prefer the profits and advantages derived
from the issue of small notes to the reeeivabihty of their notes
by the Government, but he believed that the large and respec
table institutions would find it to their interest to dispense with
the issue of such notes He would not say any more on
this subject, till the bill of the Senaloi from Massachusetts
came in
Mr BENTON said he might be mistaken, but he was
strongly undei the impression that the hanks of Massachusetts
had lost no privilege by the restriction in the deposite law of
1836 Ifhe was right, these bankshad never earned thepnvi
lege of having 'heir notes taken by the Government, fey sup
pressing their small notes, with the exception, perhaps, of one
or two hanks in Boston If this was the fact, what right had
these banks to come forward now, and ask of Congress, not only
a remission of the penalty, but to encourago them m issuing
small notes Why, ifthere never had been a suspension ot
specie payments, their condition would be the same 1 he Se
nate and country must observe the change of issue now made
The suspension began in New York, and the reason given by
these banks was, that they had been run upon What was the
reason given by the rest of the banks of the country? Why,
they suspended solely hecause the banks of New Vork had set
them the example, declaring that they would resume as soon as
New York did, and one of them superadded the declaration,
u that tf it had consulted its oton etrengtfi," it would have
gone on    That was the state of the case
Now the banks of New York resume, but a new set of
banks had sprung up, presenting a change of issue, bottomed
on an afterthought, which was that they could not resume
until the Fedei al Government would take their notes It is
nonsense, said Mr B far us to talk as if we did not understand
that there is a class of banks which is political, contradistin
guished from the class which is commercial The political
class inclines to take every opportunity to make mischief,
while the commercial class is endeavoring in good faith to
cany oat the objects for which they were created Thesubject
must be treated as it is, and they must call things by their
light names He repeated, that the banks petitioning had lost
no privilege, they had nothing to complain of, nothing to ask
for The movement now was, and they should not disguise it
to join the banks and the Government together again, after the
separation had been madebytheactionof thebanks It wagjan
attempt to join Bank and ¡state together, and why should they
not say so Mr B here referred to the report of the Finance
Committee, which, he said, had fully gone into and explained
the whole subject When the proper time came, Mr B said
he should endeavor to give some reasons for the part he should
take and the vote he should give, at present he would not go
further into the subject                                      ~
After some further remarks from Mr WEBSTER, the me
moríais were laid on the table, and ordered to he printed
