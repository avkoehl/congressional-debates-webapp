and Colonel Fyffe, Forrest was handled pretty roughly yesterday, the day before, and Thursday. He returned to Sparta. He lost over 100 men in killed, wounded, and taken prisoners.

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers.
HDQRS. FIRST DIVISION, ARMY OF THE OHIO,McMinnville, August 31, 1862.

General BUELL, Tullahoma:

Dispatch received. All that I know of the enemy's forces number about 500 on the Chattanooga road, about the same number near Sparta, a small force near Pikeville, and Forrest's cavalry, said to number about 1,500 strong. The general impression is that the enemy is advancing, but I have yet to see the person who has seen any of the Chattanooga forces proper.

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers.
HDQRS. FIRST DIVISION, ARMY OF THE OHIO,McMinnville, Tenn., August 31, 1862.

General BUELL, Decherd:

Were these the orders for me, viz:

5th. The Fourth and Sixth Divisions, under General Thomas, will march to Clermont on the 3d; to Readyville on the 4th, and Murfreesborough on the 5th.

McCook has not sent copy yet, nor has Crittenden.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers.
HEADQUARTERS,Decherd, August 31, 1862.

General THOMAS, McMinnville:

The general purpose of the order is to concentrate at Murfreesborough; the rearmost detachment cannot get there until the 5th. Your movement would be to clermont on the 3d, to Readyville on the 4th, and Murfreesborough on the 5th.

It is of course highly important that you should conform to the movements of the other columns, but it is also important that you should not risk a battle.

You should, if possible, keep a day's march between you and the enemy.

It will not do to trust details to a courier. All must be left to your judgment.

D. C. BUELL.
