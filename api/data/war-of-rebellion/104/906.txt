losses of the war combined. But for these distressing disturbances in districts, our country was never more quiet nor Union men more safe. Can you not give us immediate relief by orders to the authorities here, or otherwise? Full particulars by mail.

Lieutenant-Colonel CHRISTENSEN,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

Major Putnam left for New Orleans at 12 o'clock. He has in charge a couple of the cipher dispatches from General Grant transmitted to you this a.m. As the lines have been down since yesterday and no telling when they would be in working order, and the dispatch too important to be delayed, I thought it proper to send him. He has also a copy of the following dispatch:

CORINTH, May 24, 1865.

Major-General CANBY:

I have been ordered by General Thomas to cover as much territory as my troops can control. I will garrison the Mobile and Ohio Railroad as far south as Okolona, east on the Memphis and Charleston Railroad as far as Tuscumbia, and small posts south of Tuscumbia and Iuka, from fifty to sixty miles. The mountains of Northern Alabama hold guerrilla bands that will give us considerable trouble. They will probably raid the valleys toward Montgomery and Tuscaloosa.

EDWARD HATCH,

Brevet Major-General.

Very respectfully,

ALFRED FREDBERG,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
