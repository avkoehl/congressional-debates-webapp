Honorable GEORGE W. RANDOLPH,

Secretary of war:

(Through Brigadier-General Martin, commanding First Brigade.)

SIR: Pardon me for troubling you once more and for the last time about the troops I have been endeavoring to raise. Several companies are now in camp, and others are drilling at home, and some have been taken from me, and put into another regiment. I learn that both General Holmes and the State authorities have advised the War Department to disband my troops on the ground that when our present regiments are filled to the maximum, North Carolina will have more than her quota in the field, and I find it impossible to raise and organize troops with both State and Confederate authorities against me, and hae therefore quit trying to get my companies together. I hope that you will issue an order in the matter at once, that I may know what to do with those in camp. Supporing of course that General Holmes and Governor Clark's advice will be followed, I have been waiting some ten days for your orders.

Very respectfully,

Z. B. VANCE,

Colonel Twenty-sixth North Carolina Troops.
