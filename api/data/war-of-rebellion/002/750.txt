Governor CURTIN,

Harrisburg:

Forward all you can to-night. Transportation will be provided by Northern Central Company.

Press forward all available forces.

THOMAS A. SCOTT.

Governor CURTIN:

Do not lose a moment in sending Wisconsin and your own regiments.

Start them before daylight in the morning.

THOMAS A. SCOTT.

HARRISBURG, July 21, 1861.

T. A. S. [Colonel T. A. SCOTT]:

One regiment left for Washington noon; one from Pittsburgh and one from West Cheser have just arrived; one from Pittsburg and two from Easton will arrive to-morrow; the others as rapidly as can be transported to and from this place.

The three-months' regiments are arriving here without being announced or any preparation for them.

Du Barry seems hardly to know what to do.

Our men justly complain of their arms-those that came and those we send here. They complain the more, as a Wisconsin regiment refused to take the same kind of arms, and the colonel went to Washington, and was given the best modern arms.

Will you not use your influence to get better arms for these three-years' men?

A. G. CURTIN,

Governor.

General McDOWELL:

Do you want re-enforcements at Fairfax Court-House? There are three regiments at Fairfax Station on the railroad, within three miles of you; and we have another regiment loaded on cars at Springfield Station, which can reach you in three hours, if you say send them.

We also have a regiment at the railroad station in Alexandria, which can reach Fairfax Court-House in four hours.

Give instructions immediately.

THOMAS A. SCOTT.

SAM. D. YOUNG:

If any troops or regiments are on the Cumberland Valley on their way to Hagerstown, tell Lull to stop them at first station, and return them
