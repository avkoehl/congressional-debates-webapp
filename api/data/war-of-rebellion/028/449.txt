division is at Clarksburg, and Milroy's brigade should be there by this time. I have heard nothing of the new regiments that were to go to Parkersburg. I will give Kelley and Milroy the caution to be watchful. The troops under Lightburn will move up the Kanawha on Monday morning, without waiting longer for General Morgan. It now looks as if the country as high as the Gauley would be occupied without a contest, though we may be deceived. If I had a few new regiments here to garrison the lower part of the valley and cover our communications, I would say that Morgan's command might be used elsewhere. Still, it is impossible to be sure what the rebels may do till we are actually in possession of the passes of the upper country.

Major-General, Commanding District.

GALLIPOLIS, October 18, 1862.

General KELLEY, Cumberland:

The reports are that the rebels are already retiring from the Upper Kanawha Valley, and it is rumored that they may try to concentrate between you and Milroy. Watch the country and the passes closely. I have ordered a new battery at Parkersburg to report to General Milroy, at Clarksburg.

J. D. COX,

Major-General, Commanding.

GALLIPOLIS, October 18, 1862.

General MILROY, Clarksburg:

Concentrate your force as rapidly as you can. The reports of the retreat of the rebels from Upper Kanawha are confirmed, and rumor says they talked of visiting your region. I authorize you to order up the battery at Parkersburg. Watch the country beyond Buckhannon closely, and prepare to meet vigorously any attempt to enter that part of the State. The rumor is probably groundless, but I desire you to act as if it were true.

J. D. COX,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE OHIO,Cincinnati, October 18, 1862.

Major General JACOB D. COX,

Commanding, &amp;c., Gallipolis, Ohio:

Getting new regiments is so uncertain that it would be unsafe to attempt substituting them for General Morgan's command. He must, therefore, join you, to be recalled as soon as he can be dispensed with. I can hardly believe the rebels are moving in the direction of Clarksburg, but it may be so. Have telegraphed the Governor in regard to your new regiments, which ought to have been in Parkersburg by to-night, at latest.

H. G. WRIGHT,

Major-General, Commanding.
