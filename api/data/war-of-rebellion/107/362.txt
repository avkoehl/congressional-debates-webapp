[Major BELGER:]

A battery from the West. Do you know whose?

[PORTER.]

ASHLAND, April 22.

Major PORTER:

I was told in Washington Major Sherman's. The reason I ask is the chief of police is here and returns to the mayor to know if there will be any opposition to its passing, and that he will send me answer. I will then telegraph you.

JAMES BELGER,

Major.

[Major BELGER:]

Are the volunteers at Ashland to return here to say?

[PORTER.]

[Major PORTER:]

In answer to your message I will say it is not contemplated the regiments will remain long in Harrisburg. See instructions which I have forwarded to you by Mr. Palmer. Meet me to-night at the depot.

JAMES BELGER,

Major.

[APRIL 22, 1861.]

Major BELGER:

Have you any orders for Major P.?

[PORTER.]

[Major PORTER:]

I have no orders. I am instructed to return with the troops to Washington.

[BELGER.]

Colonel McDOWELL,

Bridgeport:

Return here with your command.

[PORTER.]

Major BELGER:

How soon must the train be down? It is difficult to start them this time of day. Do you wish me to start the train right away to bring the volunteers up?

PORTER.

Major PORTER:

I will answer you question as soon as the general returns with the instructions from camp.

[BELGER.]
