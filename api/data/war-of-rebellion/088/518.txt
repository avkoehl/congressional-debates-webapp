Lieutenant-General GRANT:

Since sending my last dispatch I have conversed with the safeguard referred to. He did not leave the field till after sunrise. At that time nearly all the enemy had left, moving toward Petersburg.

General MEADE:

The signal dispatch intercepted is evidently a hoax, as was the one intercepted yesterday, to blind us from some really intended attack. To-day suspect it will be against Warren.

CITY POINT, VA., August 26, 1864.

Major-General MEADE:

I think the chances are that Warren will be attacked in rear this afternoon by the same force that attacked Hancock yesterday. There will be probably a demonstration on his front by all the force now occupying the lines in his front. If Warren can prepare for both a front
