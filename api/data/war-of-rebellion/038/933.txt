The corn in the counties mentioned is in the shuck, and you are aware it would very much expedite transportation to have it shelled and sacked, and for that purpose it would be well to procure a negro force, with corn-shellers, sacks, &amp;c., and send in to De Soto County and have it properly sacked, should you deem it necessary to send in after the corn; also sacks for wheat.

One other point; that is, if you conclude to get the supplies out of Northern Mississippi, that all agents send there by you be instructed to give a uniform price (the same price), and all agents report to some man that you may designate. I mention this in order that speculators may be driven off, and that those having an agency from some other commissary for the purpose of speculation be brought under the same instructions. I mention this from the fact that I know that the people are being, and have been, imposed upon by speculators, and the soldiers deprived of a considerable quantity of subsistence.

All of which is respectfully submitted to your consideration.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. P. ATKINS.

I have in store 5,000 rations of meal and 40,000 rations of bacon.
