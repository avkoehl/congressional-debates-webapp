Major General F. J. HERRON,

Commanding District of Baton Rouge, La.:

Please notify General Brent and other commissioners that I have no authority to determine any questions that relate to civil matters, and that any arrangements that may be made upon the subject of their mission must conform to the conditions that controlled the surrender of General Lee's army, the details corresponding with those agreed upon in the case of General Taylor's army, with the modifications authorized in Special Orders, Numbers 215, from the Headquarters of the Army. (See General Orders, Numbers 55, from military division headquarters of yesterday's date. *) Beyond this I have no authority to act, and, unless their powers warrant them in accepting the same terms, it will be inexpedient to appoint commissioners or to make arrangements for a conference. If, with this understanding, they still desire it, you will please accompany

them to New Orleans, to which place I will return to-night. Please invite them to my quarters, where I shall be happy to see you also.

E. R. S. CANBY,

Major-General, Commanding.
