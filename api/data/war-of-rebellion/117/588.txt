WHEELING, VA., October 1, [1862.]

Major L. C. TURNER, Judge-Advocate.

SIR: The custom heretofore adopted toward deserters from the rebel Army has been to administer to them the oath of allegiance when they have not previously taken it to the Confederate Government so-called, or to parole them not to take arms against the United States and not to give aid or information to its enemies and to require them to live in some loyal Northern State until the end of the rebellion.

Commanders of departments may have different views on the subject, and I prefer to know from the department what general policy is to be furnished regarding these deserters so as to protect the Government.

Can I give them transportation and clothes if they need it?

Very respectfully,

JOS. DARR, JR.,

Major and Provost-Marshal-General.
