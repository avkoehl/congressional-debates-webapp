Major SAYERS,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Meridian, Miss.:

If small-arms were not issued to any men of Abbay's battery, send them, with accouterments, ammunition, &amp;c., about forty rifles. Tell Major Young King's battery (dismounted) has been ordered down from Verona. He and chief of ordnance must ascertain what horses and harness., &c., it requires, and equip it soon as possible; meantime they will use small-arms. Do not be precipitate in moving stores from Meridian. I have ordered McCulloch's brigade and Maury to Leakesville, thence toward Bucatunna,if enemy moves that way. Give orders for prompt issue of supplies, which may be needed.

D. H. MAURY,

Major-General, Commanding.

Colonel COLVIN.

At Shubuta or Meridian:

Your best position will be at or near Bucatunna. I think McCulloch's brigade will be at Leakesville to-night, probably near Bucatunna tomorrow night. Communicate and co-operate with him. Take every means you can to guard telegraph line. There are some negro dogs in your vicinity. use them to trail who ever cut it, and deal summarily.

D. H. MAURY,

Major-General, Commanding.

Colonel Maury's regiment left town about 9a. m.; it is not far behind you. Tobin's battery left about sunset;is in camp a few miles out. Send orders where it can find you. Send me frequent information of enemy's movements to Citronelle, or by other shorter means. Keep some of your forces always between me and enemy.
