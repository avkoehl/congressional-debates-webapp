up and dispos&of them in their regular order;
and I want to know of my friend from Kentucky-
how he will get through with the Calendar?
Mr. GROW. I sec no objection to the propo-
sition made by the gentleman from Ohio [Mr.
Stanton] to read over the list of bills which have
been reported, and let gentlemen indicate upon
what ones they desire a separate vote, pass such
as there is no objection to, and allow the others
to go over until to-morrow.
Mr, JONES, of Tennessee. The objection to
that, I expect, is that there are gentlemen here
novi whp have not been here during the day, and
who want time to look over the list, in order to
determine which bills to object to, and upon
which to demand a separate vote.
Mr. LETCHER. There are, I understand,
eighty-nine bills reported from the Committee of
the Whole. Now, I understand that it is pro-
posed to read over the titles of all these bills in
ten minutes, and give gentlemen only that time
to determine upon what bills they wanta separate
vote.
Mr. BURNETT. I will say to my friend from
Virginia that, if he had been here all day listening
to the reading of the bills and reports in commit-
tee, he would have prepared to determine without
any delay what bills, in his judgment, ought to
pass, and what ought not. I say to gentlemen
that it is their own fault if they have not paid at-
tention in committee to-day to the reading of bills,
when a single objection would have prevented
any bill from being reported; and now, to delay
action in the House upon these bills until morn-
ing, would be doing injustice to the other cases
on the Calendar. I hope these bills will be acted
upon to-night, and that we shall go over the bal-
ance of the Calendar to-morrow.
Mr. LETCHER. I will say to my friend from
Kentucky that I think I have been here to-day
much more of the time than he has been.
Mr. BURNETT. I have been here the whole
day, except while I was absent at dinner.
The SPEAKER. The Chair thinks he has
indulged this irregular debate long enough. The
titles of the bills reported by the committee will
now be read over, and gentlemen can indicate
upon which ones they desire separate votes.

in line five, and insert " twenty-live," so as to
make it read " twenty-five dollars per month."
Mr. SINGLETON. 1 sincerely hope the House
will not ajjiee to this amendment. It has passed
the Senate in this present shape; and if it is
amended, it wib have to go back to the Senate,
and there will be git at danger that it will be lost
in the pressure of business. I hope the House
will vote down the amendment.
Mr. REX i)Y. Mr Speaker, I hope the amend-
ment to the Senate bill, repoited by the Commit-
tee on Military Affairs, will not be adopted. Out
of the large number of private bills which the
House has passed to-day, I am sure there is not
onemoie meritoiious than this. Mrs. Barnard
is the widow of one of the most gallant officers
who seived in the Mexican war. I happen to
have a personal knowledge of her. She is among
the most retiring and amiable women Hiave ever
known. Her late husband, Hrevot Major Bar-
nard, was twice wounded while, heroically at-
tempting to plant the btondard of his country on
tho walls of Chepultcpec, of which wound he died
fibout a year afterwards. He left fi widow with a
