Washington, D. C.,
Tuesday, May 21, 1872.
D. R. Anthony sworn and examined.
By Mr. Thurman :
Question. What is your age, residence, and
occupation?
Answer. Age, forty seven; residence, Leav-
en worth, Kansas; editor.
Question. How long have you resided in
Kansas ?
Answer. Fourteen years.
Question. Where have you resided during
that time?
Answer. Leavenworth.
Question. Were yon at Topeka at any time
during the senatorial canvass of 1867 ?
Answer. I was.
Question. About what time were you there ?
Answer. In the month of January.
Question. How Song before the election did
you go there?
Answer. I think one or two weeks.
Question. Were you a candidate for the
Senate at that election?
Answer, I was not.
Question. Were you working for anybody?
Answer. I think I favored the election of
Mr. Pomeroy, and I think Mr. Ross. I can
state it more properly by saying I was for Mr.
Pomeroy, and anybody to beat Mr. Carney.
Question. Do you know of any money or
other-valuable thing being used in that elec-
tion by either of the candidates ?
Answer. I do not of my own personal knowl-
edge. The only money I knew of was what
was told me by Perry Fuller, of checks that
he had paid for Mr. Ross's election.
Question. Did you have any conversation
with Senator Pomeroy at or about the time
of that election in regard to the use of money?
Answer. I did.
Question. What was it?
Answer. I can only state my recollection of
the substance of that conversation. I had
many conversations with him.
Mr. Thcrmax. Well, sir, state that.
The Witxess. Do you desire me to state
everything that I can recollect ?
Mr. Thcrmax. Yes; all your conversations
with .Mr. Pomeroy in regard to that election.
Answer. The most important part of the
conversation as applying directly to this mat-
ter was that Mr. Carney was there with money ;
that 
Question. Who said that?
Answer. That was the talk with Mr. Pome-
roy and myself and all—that he was using
money in the election ; that he was not ident-
ified with the party as a party man; not a be-
liever in its principles, or an advocate of its
principles; and that men who voted for him
would be charged with voting because they
were paid for it; that Mr. Pomeroy had the
advantage of Mr. Carney in this, that he was
believed to be of the party and with the party,
and that the people naturally supported him,
and did support him.
Question. That he was believed to be with
the party ?
Answer. Yes, sir ; Mr. Pomerot was; that
it was costing Mr, Carney a great deal ot'
money ; that it was not costing hita near as
much, although it cost him some money.
That is about the substance of the conversation
as it would affect the question of bribery and
corruption. I heard of men that were bought
at that time, but I have not now the recollec-
tion of a single man or natne. Indeed, the
names 
Question. By whom was it said that these
members were bribed—by which side?
Answer. It was said that money was used
on all sides, but very little money was used
by Mr. Pomeroy; that quite a good deal was
used by Mr. Ross—Mr. Ross's agent, Mr.
Perry Fuller. He told me he had pail eleven
or twelve thousand dollars, and he showed me
his check book. He told me the names of
those he had paid it to. He showed me the
stub-book by which he paid it out.
Question. Did he show you any he paid out
for electing Mr. Pomeroy ?
Answer. No, sir; he was using his money
principally for Mr. Ross.
Question. Did Mr. Pomerot speak to you
about using money 1
Answer. Yes, sir; he did. He said it cost
him a great deal.
Question. Did he say how it cost him—what
use he had made of the money ?
Answer. My recollection now of what he
stated is that it was his hotel bills that cost
him the most—some thousands of dollars.
Question. That his hotel bill bad cost him
some thousands of dollars?
Answer. Yes, sir; a large amount: his
hotel bill was the principal item. I never in-
quired or asked whether they were buying men,
or who were bought.
Question. Did he explain how his hotel
bill came to cost him so much money?
Answer. I think he said he was paying th 
bills of his friends who were there at the hotel.
Question. He did not treat any did he?
Answer. I guess he did. I always thought
the Senator played the dodge on that: he got
John Martin to furnish the whisky, and I
always supposed that he paid the bills, although
I could not swear to that; it was done quietly
at one side.
By Mr. Pomerot:
Question. Mr. Anthony does not mean to
say that any was drank in my presence ?
Answer. O, no. I could swear that I rsu
invited by Coionel Martin several times, and
very good liquors they were.
By Mr. Thurhan :
Question. What was the political complex-
ion of that Legislature—how many Repub-
licans and bow many Democrats ?
Answer. It is a mere question of memory.
I think twenty or twenty-rive Democrats out of
about one hundred members of both branches.
Question. For whom did the Democrats vote
in theelection when Mr. Pomerot was elected?
Answer. Some of them voted for him.
Question. And some for Carney ?
Answer. Yes ; for Lee, and some for Car-
ney ; Carney, Lee, and Ross, I think.
By Mr. Loga.v :
Question. That was in Mr. Ross's election;
but in Mr. Pomehoi's election thejournalseems
to show that there were only votes for Lee aad
Pomeroy.
Answer. 0, yes ; that was ou the first bal-
lot—in the ballot for the long term.
By Mr. Thtomax :
Question. Was Lee a Republican also ?
Answer. Yes. sir.
Question. They werebolh Republicans ; thera
ji was no Democratic candidate ?
|i Answer. None.
!j Question. Were there a good many friends
' of Pomeroy there?
Answer. Yes, sir ; a large number of his
friends.
Question. Can you state the names of any of
them ?
Answer. I ought to know five hundred of
them, but you ask me and 1 cannot name them.
The man that I recollect most by seeing him
about the room was George Anthony : there
was John A. Martin and Judge Horton.
