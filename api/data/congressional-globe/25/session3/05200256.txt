$13,000,090, and the most economical adminis-
tration of the Government cannot fall under
$18,000,000 for ordinary appropriation , inde*
pendent of annual extraordinary appropi rations,
ranging from five to ten million dollars, conse-
quently, without the revenue derivable from the
public lands, the deficiency in the Treasury can-
not fall short of eight oi ten million dollars
I have now, Mr Speaker, discharged my duty
to my constituents and myself, and the result is
left to the wisdom of the country. I soon quit
this Hall for the more retued scenes of my
adopted State, and in sui rendering the trust com-
mitted to me by the people of that young and
happy State, I feel assured that I have faithfully
struggled to serve them, and it is a source of
pride and gratitude to me to know-that they have
generally approved my efforts, and in no instance
manifested any otherfeehng than that of kindness
and friendship far beyond my merits
carried to Woodstock, there examined by magis-
trates of the Province of New Brunswick, and
ordered to Predencton, they were sent off on a
horse sled, amid the sTVOuts &nd jeers of the pop-
ulace, under a military guard, and imprisoned in
a foreign jail, add to such unjustifiable seizure
and imprisonment of the land agent and his as-
sistants, the pioclamation of Sir John Harvey,
denouncing the acts of Maine and her officers as
án invasion of her Majesty'  province, and Ihi eat-
ening to expel by fot ce the posse sent by Maine for
the protection and preservation of her property.
Then look at Sir John's letter to the Governor of
Mame, asserting the claim to exclusive jurisdiction
of the whole disputed territory, by agreement be-
tibeentlielwo General-Governments, and threatening
to expel from the territory the armed force of
Mame, unless the Governor Of Maine should vol-
untarily Withdraw it; and connect with it the as->
sertion of the British Minister that exclusive juris-
diction of the disputed terutory belongs to Great
Butain until the question of boundary shall be
finally settled, with the claim of Mr Street, Attor-
ney Geneial of New Brunswick, upon Mr Jams,
then acting ai land agent of Maine, requiung him
to wrthdiaw fiom the disputed terntoiy, and to
iwiendertne pet sons an died and in custody, as
trespassers upon the disputed teintory, to the cm*
thoiilies of JVeto Brunswick, to be tried %n the cow is
of that piovince, and you have the íeasons and the
justification of Maine for the couise she has
adopied, and is puisuing, and which course is
intended to be controlled and restrained by the
memorandum and agreement now communicated.
If Maine was right, as all seem to admit she
was, in sending her land agent and posse to pro-
tect the timber and to arrest the tiespassers, then
she must not only be justified, but applauded,for
piomptly meeting the threat of Sir John Harvey
(to expel that posse by military force if not with-
diawn) by arrangements to support and sustain
the land a°;entand posse by a foice equal to the
«meigency Can Maine retrace her steps and
withdraw her land agent and posse, without vir-
tually yielding to the demand and threat of Sir
John Ilaivey' Would any Senator desire that
she should do it} Would any Ameucan pardon
her it she did do it > Mr W did not pretend to
speak by authority on this occasion, and would
not say how Maine would think oi act in respect
of the recommendations to her, but as a citizen
and representative of that State, knowing some-
thing of the feelings and determination of the
people and government of Maine, he felt it due
to them and to the country to sa-y now, in his
place, and upon the first appearance of the mem-
orandum and agreement, as he understood it,
(having no opportunity to learn Us meaning and
intent, except from the reading of it here,) that
it would not be satisfactory to Mame, and can-
not be carried into effect.
The agreement, as understood, provides that
Sir John Harvey will not attempt to expel, by
military force, the armed party which Maine has
upon the terutory, (hat Maine will forthwith
withdraw from the disputed territory, and if,
hereafter, there shall be necessity for an armed
force to expel notorious trespassers the operation
shall be conducted by conceit between Maine, and
New Brunswick If, by the armed party, was only
intended the military force which Maine has or-
dered to sustain the posee against the threatened
attack of Sir John Harvey, then Maine surely
would not object to withdraw that force, upon Sir
John withdrawing his threat, which threat was
the sole cause of sending that force upon the ter-
ritory; and if such should be the understanding
of the parties to the agreement, then Mr W. had
no objection to that part of it, but if it be intended
that the land agent and posse shall be withdrawn
before they shall have accomplished the objects
for which they were sent, it cannot be done
Mame cannot yield to the demand of Sir John
Harvey, even by the advice of the General Gov-
ernment, without surrendering her unquestion-
able right to protect her territory and property
from depredation Again if Maine were to with-
draw her land agent and posse, what security is
provided by the memorandum that Sir John will
not immediately enter upon the disputed territory
and occupy it, by military force or otherwise,

* From March 4,1*89, to December 31,1791
If it was impolitic and inexpedient in the year
1832 to recognize the system, it is more so now,
(in 1839,) situated as the Treasury is; and pru-
dence forbids its adoption Even if Congress had
the power to carry it into effect, it would, if en-
forced, be destructive to the interests of the new
States, and aC a single blow would prostrate all
future hope of receiving any benefits from the
kind action of Congress.
Carry the scheme of the gentleman from Vir-
ginia [Mr Robertson] into execution, and we
are then to be taxed by the tariff one hundred per
centum, amounting to about ten million dollars,
to make-up a deSeiency in the Treasury; and, on
the other hand, we will receive, under the provis-
ions of the resolution, our proportion of the
lands, accoidwg to the Federal enumeration of our
population,amounting, certainly, by the most lib
eral calculation to about five million dollars only,
thus inflicting a loss on my constituents of about
twenty five per centum upon the whole amount
of increased duties, either from direct taxation,
which maybe resorted to, or by an increased
tariff
By reference W the estimate of the Secretary of
the Treasury, we find the revenue from the im-
port duties ranging from #38,000,000, in 1833, to
$11,000,000, m 1838
After the year 1841, the revenue from cus-
toms will not exceed the foregoing estimate of
MAINE BOUNDARY QUESTION
DEBATE   IN   THE   SENATE,
Wednesdat, Feb)uaiy 27, 1839
A message from the Piesident of the United
States, with a memorandum of a specific chai-
acter, signed by the Secretary of State and the
British Minister, togethei with vauous other doc
uments on the subject of the Maine and New
Biunswick difficulties, having been received and
read in the Si nate—
Mr WILLIAMS, of Maine, said the message
of the President and accompanying documents,
just now read by the Secretary, weie highly im-
portant to the nation, but more especially so to
the State which he had the honor, in part, to
represent They related to a quesiion of the
deepest interest to his constituents, and to meas
ures adopted and pursued by the united voice of
the Legislatuie and the people of the Stale nf
Maine foi the pieservation and defense of her
property and njlils lie was not sure that he
fully compiehendid the terms and miamngot the
message, and ngioemi nt 01 memoiandum, signed
byhei Butannic Miijpsty's Ministtrnnd the bec-
rctaiy of State, but so lai as he could catch them
from the lending at the Cleik's desk, he felt it
due to the Senate and to his constituents, to say,
fiankly, that he ftaied they would not prove
satisfactoiy to Maine, or produce the effect in-
tended by the fiameis of them
The people as well as the Legislature of Maine
feel deeply and sensibly the injustice and degra-
dation she has long suffered fiom an unjust and
groundless claim, by a foieign Government, to
one third of the terntorv of that State, and fiom
theexeicise of jurisdiction by that Government
over a part of the terutoiy.and from repeated ar-
rests and impi isonment of her citizens by that for-
eign Government, without redress or satisfaction
They are now aroused and excited by the recent
avowal of the Lieutenant Governor of New Bruns-
wick and of the British Minister, that Gteat Brit-
ain claims exclusive )unsdiction over the whole
disputed terutory, and that that claim will be en-
forced by military power They feel that the
quebtton of her boundary has already been suf-
fered to remain unsettled too long, that Great
Butain refuses to settle it according to the treaty
of 1783, and thatf the time has come when Maine
mustpiotect her own property on the disputed
territory, or suffer its principal value to be de-
stroyed and abstracted by desperate marauders
The General Government interposes no obstacle
to the continued depredations upon that territo-
ry, and the honor and interest of Maine have alike
impelled her Legislature to adopt measures in-
tended and well calculated to prevent further de-
struction of the timber upon that territory, as well
as to arrest and punish the trespassers For this
object Maine sent her land agent and sheriff, with
an armed posse deemed sufficient to arrest and dis-
perse the gangs of tiespassers who had bid defi-
ance to her laws, as well as to her power, to stop
their depredations
The land agent and his assistants, after par-
tially accomplishing their purpose, were sur-
rounded by armed men in the night time, forcibly
