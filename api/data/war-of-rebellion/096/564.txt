General WEBB,

Chief of Staff:

I have just sent up two more deserters from Pegram's division, who fully confirm all the others have said. They say their army is very much dispirited and starving, and that they know three-fourths of the men in ranks would make an unconditional surrender now. They are building their new line back at Burgess' Mill, and are ready to run out a new line at Dabney's Mill at short notice, only one division
