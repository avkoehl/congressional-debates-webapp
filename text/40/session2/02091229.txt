RIGHTS OF AMERICAN CITIZENS ABROAD.
Mr. GRISWOLD. I move to suspend the
rules for the purpose of offering the following
preamble and resolutions, which I send to the
desk.
The Clerk read as follows:
Whereas the principles which underlie the founda-
tion of the American Republic, as an independent
nation, recognize "the right of all men to lite, lib-
erty, and the pursuit of happiness;" and whereas the
duties of allegiance and protection being reciprocal,
the Government of the United States are bound to
protect this right equally in the persons of all citi-
zens, whether native or naturalized: and whereas all
judicial opinions or pretended judicial opinions to
the contrary notwithstanding, this is, and has always
been, the fundamental law of this country, and one
which the President and all other authorities of the
country are, and always were, bound to enforce;
and whereas the right of all American citizens to
equal protection has been, or is reported to have
been, lately violated in frequent instances by certain
foreign Governments, especially by those of Great
Britain and Prussia: Therefore,
Be it resolved by the Senate and House of Represent-
atives of .the United States of America in Congress
assembled, That this ri-xht to equal protection of per-
son and property, on the part of all citizens of the.
United States, is now, as it has always been, and shall
forever be, the law of this country.. .
2. That in every instance, ascertained in the man-
ner hereinafter prescribed, of the violation of the
rights of an American citizen, by any foreign Govern-
ment whatever, it shall be the duty of the Executive
of the United States to demand the instant release
of such citizen, with adequate reparation for the
insult and injury sustained by him; or, on failing
to obtain such release and reparation, the .Executive
shall immediately report the facts to Congress, by
and with whose advice and authority he shall em-
ploy all the power of the country to maintain its
honor and the rights of its citizens. . .
3. That in every instance, either at present existing
or which may hereafter occur, of the arrestor impris-
onment of an American citizen in any foreign coun-
try, it shall bo the duty of the President, or of his
representative in such foreign country, to demand
a certified copy of the charge laid against such citi-
zen, to require that he be brought to trial within ten
days after his arrest, to secure to him the benefit of
an impartial jury, with the necessary legal assist-
ance; and in case of the refusal or delay of such trial,
or, on its being had, of the acquittal of the accused,
it shall be the duty of the President to demand his
instant release, or to employ the whole power of the
country to enforce it.
Mr. GRISWOLD. I will yield to the gen-
tleman from Ohio.
