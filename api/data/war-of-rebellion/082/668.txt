Will you please send us ammunition for rifle muskets. We can hold this position, but cannot advance. We have two guns of the enemy; one we have firing to our right, the other to our left.

I am, general, &amp;c.,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers.

[JULY 30, 1864]-10.30 [a. m.]

General WILLCOX:

The enemy is moving troops down their main front rifle-pit from their left toward the exploded mine occupied by us. The regiments and companies occupying the same are very much broken up. An advance with the troops around me is impossible.

I am, general,

J. F. HARTRANFT,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers.

CIRCULAR.] HDQRS. THIRD DIVISION, NINTH ARMY CORPS,

Before Petersburg, Va., July 30, 1864.

The brigadier-general commanding wishes the troops of his division to distinctly understand that the evacuation of the crater was not on account of their inability to hold it, but the work was evacuated by a peremptory order given by the lieutenant-general commanding the armies, for good reasons. All the general officers in the work concurred in the opinion that the last rebel advance could easily have been repulsed if necessary, but it was not thought wise to sacrifice the lives of any more brave men by a bloody resistance.

By command of Brigadier General O. B. Willcox:

L. C. BRACKETT,

Lieutenant and Aide-de-Camp.

Commanding Cavalry Corps:

The major-general commanding directs me to inform you that the assault on the enemy's intrenchments not having succeeded, the troops are ordered to be withdrawn to our own lines. You will be governed
