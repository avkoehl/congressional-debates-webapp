CAPE GIRARDEAU, MO., October 14, 1864.

Brigadier-General EWING:

I have this day directed the commanding officers of the following regiments to report for orders to Lieutenant Colonel H. H. Hiller, commanding post Cape Girardeau: Fifty-sixth, Sixty-fourth, Seventy-ninth, and three companies of the regiment at Charleston, Colonel Deal's. Reports have been received this evening that a rebel force of from 400 to 1,000 are at and about Fredericktown. I think it exaggerated. I await your orders.

Lieutenant HANNAHS:

My force is distributed as follows: North of De Soto, 390; about 150 at De Soto; a guard at each of the three bridges between this place and De Soto; forty men sent to Potosi last evening; forty men sent to Sainte Gevevieve on the evening of the 11th, who have not yet returned. The residue here are driving piles and capping one bridge, clearing out the debris, and getting the next ready. Expect to cross the first brigade to-morrow evening and ought to have the other two done within three days.
