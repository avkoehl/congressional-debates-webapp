THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
Feb. 2i,
places now designated as new, were appropmted
for He could state that the committee who re
ported the b,M had duly considered the subject, and
in answer to their application for information, they
had received a special communication fiom the
Sec-etary of Wa-, which he would bes; to have
read by the Cleik, and satisfied the committee of
the propre'y of the course they pursued lie
found that there was an appiopnation made of
$25,000 for the fort on Geoige'd Island, B «ton
harbor 1 here were also appropuations made foi
a fort on Throg's Neck, New York If the gen-
eral argument was to be brought up on the policy
' of our system of fortifica'ions, that is a different
question It might be that the system was too
much extended Cut, taking the appropuations
now proposed, in the aggregate, he believed tnat
they did not exceed those of foimer yeais He
desired the reading ot some ot the communications
fiom the Secretary of Wai in relation tosevenl of
the foits and fortifications in progress He could
see no reason for discontinuing the piesent policy
in regard to this system, and if it was to be con
tinued, the appropuations were proper and neces
sary
Mr McDUPFIEsaid it had been thedetermin
ation of Congress not to make appropriations for
new fortifications The items appropuated last
year must have passed suli silentw They did not
meet his eye He was not in favoi of abolishing
the foitificuion system The fortifications of the
fiist order were aheady finished, and theie was ro
ut.e in continuing to bund foitificauons which we
could neither man noi equip He adveited also
to the necessity of economy and retrenchment as
mother ieason for discontinuing the appropri
ations The i ext year we should hardly be able
to meet oai necessary expenses lie made the
proposition to recommit the bill with a view to
attempt to amend it, and not from any unkind or
unfan spirit towaids the Committee ot Ways and
Means, or to the Administration, but it seemed
that he could do nothing without exposing himself
to the charge of acting from hostility to the Ad
mm stiation
Mr POLK explained that he had not intimated
or supposed that thegentleman's motion had arisen
from hostility to the Committee of Ways and
Means, or the Administration lie added that the
fortifications embiaced in the bill, uelonged to the
regulai system winch we had adopted, and by dis
continuing the appropriations now, we should lose
what we had already expended on them
Mi SELDEN spoke in lelerence to the im-
portance of continuing the appiopnations tor the
defence of ihe haibor of New Yoik
Mi   WAYNE íeplied to the views of thegen-
'tleman from South Carolina, and showed that ne
was in error in the supposition that the appiopn
ations now called for exceeded those of foime
years
Mi GORHAM opposed the motion to r< com
mit the billrand contended that the appropriations
proposed for Boston harbor were essential to its
defence The inner harboi was well protected,
but the outer harbor was wholly defenceless To
this day, though the United States have made Bos
ton the grand naval depot of the eastern States,
the Government has done notl-irg towards the
deftnee of the outer harbor The last place which
the Government should abandon was this import-
ant depot of their naval stiength.and he was only
suipiised that it had not been fortified befoie The
estimates «ere not, in his opinion, too high
Mr HALL, of North Caiolma, sa.d he should
vote for the recommitment, not, perhips, precisely
for the «ame reasons that some others did, but be
cause he was really and thoroughly aretrenchment
mt n, and in saying this he meant not the slightest
reflection on any one But gentlemen ht.d s| oken
of re'ienchment He was willing to go with them,
not only upon this bill—this particular case—but
all otheis where it waspiopei lie would go with
tne gentleman from New Yoik [Mi Srnir\] to
the Blue Bool, a" he had alluded to that as a prooei
< bject Mi II sud this wsave-y good "lot nd
to start! upon It migh' not be c-iticilly coi ect
to say t good ground on which to raise ° siipe/-
M uclu e o* retrenchment, but jt wis a good ground
to stand upon to carry into effect very large le
trenchments But he would tell the gentleman
that it was v ery in idequate     It was entn ely use-
less to exoect any great or beneficial resu'ts fiom
attempting to cut oft a little here and a little there
He had learned from long expenence and obse -
\ation, through a term of between fifteen and
twenty yeais that 1 e had been a member of th-
House, the uttei futiluy of attempting to lop off
the branches piecemeal, tie only temecly was to
go it once to the mam body o? tue evi Reduce
the levente, 'his was1 the only íemedy Su, (said
he,) I am willu g lo lop eff the bra icl es as I go
along, but I am for gomof to the souice of the evil,
to the body and soul of ti e mischief And,I re
peat, that I am convinced, from what I have seen
and experienced, that, so long as we have a sur-
plus levenue, v esha" continue to scramble fcr and
apply it to purpose  many of them entuely valu
less or mischievous As to the bill now under
consideiation, he had said he should vote foi the
lecoinnntment, because he believed tl at many (lie
would by no means ..ay al!) of the objects weie
entuely unnecessaiy
Mr HARPER, ofPenisylvama,contended that
the appiopnation proposed in the bill for the nbrts
on the Delaware weie necessaiy There was at
tin  ti ne no point of defence on the approach to
Prnladelphia The whole range of the D°Ia vaie
was unprotected The old fort 1 ad fallen into
lums Last yeai its rebuilding was commenced,
and to stop the ap itopnalion i ow would Le to ex-
pose the ci v of Pi tladel| hit to be laid in asi es at
any moment by an enleipurine enemy
Mr   BROWlN =aid, he was wiJm^ to give his
vote foi the b 1   urt'ei ror sideiatioi , u th° state
of the ie\enuc wot id admit sucn an expenditoie
of the public money, witho it senous emla ra^s
menttothe iieasuiy     He would votef i the bill,
not because a poi ion of ihe morey was to be e<
pended iiitle? He of JNew Yoik, w uch he haJ
the honoi, in pait,tu repiesent upon this flior,
not would he vote foi it because it contained an
appiopnation for the  haibor of Boston, or the
mouth of the Delawaie   but he would d i so be
cause it was a patt of out eieat system of public
defence, piovided and pujectel foi  the security
and defenie of the whole country     Before he did
vote for the bill, however, he should be giad  to
have some information fiom honoraule gentlemen
upon the Committee of  Ways and Means, as to
the probable state of the revei ue     We had been
admonished by the President, in his annual mes
sage, tobe cautious of making unnecessaiy appro-
puations of the pob'ic money     Om leve uelaws
had undeigonea very ierent,and a very impor
tant change, and  the effect uf such change upon
the tieasuiy was ¡tie subject of unceiuinty if rot
anxiety

lions which had filien fiom tl e liinoi  I le pentle-
man from South Carolina, [Vi   McDn. nr ] en

If there was to be my consider ible falling off in
the receipts of the revenue ñbrthe comí ig vear, he
thought this very lili, above   ill otneis, making
appiopnation, she u d be drawn will le'eierce lo
that deficiency, and before he was called upon to
vote for its final passage, he 1 oped that the House
would be put m posses ion of the views of the
Committee of Wsys and Means upon the subject
of the íetenue foi the coming yeai
Mr EVERETT, of Massachusetts, admi'ted
that theie had been an unders'arding that works
cf the second class should be discontinued, but
there had been no undeistanding, expiess or im-
plied, that works of ttiefiist cla«s should te aban-
doned The representatives of Massachusetts
v ould never have assented to any undeistandmg
that the outtr haibor of Boston should be lef' de-
