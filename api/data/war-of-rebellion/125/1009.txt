It will be seen that the excess of years of service over the number of men furnished in the first sub-district is 100, in the second, 110, &amp;c. Total in the district, 1,200.

The quota of the district under the present call is 1,000; to this add the excess, 1,200, making, 2,200; then, as the number enrolled in the district (20,000) is to this sum (2,200), so is the number enrolled in the sub-district to its quota, which quota will be reduced by subtracting from it its share of the excess.
