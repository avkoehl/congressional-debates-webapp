the same into effect; which was referred to the
Committee on the Library.

REPORTS FROM COMMITTEES.
Mr. DICKINSON, from the Committee on Fi-
nance, to which was referred the joint resolution of
the Senate, No. 29, being the resolution to amend
the resolution approved the 10th of August, 1850,
relative to the payment of dividends or interest on
' war bounty scrip, reported back the same without
anfsndment, and recommended its passage.
Mr. DICKINSON. I am directed by the select
committee to which was referred the memorial of
Miss D. L. Dix, asking that grants of public lands
may be made for the relief and support of the ind i-
gent insane in the United States, to report a bill
making a grant of public lands to the several
States of the Union for the relief and support of
indigent insane persons. In making this report I
beg to say that I do it as the organ of the commit-
tee merely. When I was appointed upon this se-
lect committee I stated that I should not be able to
give this matter my personal attention, because the
duties of the Committee on Finance were such as
to engross my whole time and thought. I present
this bill, therefore, without expressing any opin-
ion as to its details and principles, because 1 have
had no opportunity of examining them as thor-
oughly as I could desire. Iam aware, too, that
some entertain doubts as to its constitutionality,
and therefore I shall express no opinion upon that
question, but bring it before the Senate for its ac-
tion in the absence of the chairman of the commit-
tee. 'The subject embraced in the bill has been
brought before the country for years past by Miss
iJ. L. Dix," of Boston, a lady of fortune, of accom-
plished education, of refinement, and every way
fittted to grace and adorn the highest oircles of
society. She has devoted herself with her whole
soul and all the energy and fidelity of her sex, to
relieve the sufferings of those unfortunate beings
who have been bereft of reason. She, too, has
hovered like a ministering angel around the lonely
cell of the prisonâ€”has visited wretched outcasts,
the most abject specimens of poor degraded hu-
manity, and has carried rays of light and consola-
tion to the dungeon where the iron enters into the
soul. In behalf of her holy mission I invoke for
it the early and earnest attention of the Senate. It
is a subject of high moment, and certainly recom-
mends itself strongly to the best feelings of our
nature. I do not expect or propose to take charge
of it hereafter, but I hope it will receive the con-
sideration its importance demands.
The bill was then read a first time and ordered
to a second reading.
Mr. WHITCOMB, from the Committee on
Patents and the Patent Office, to which were re-
ferred the documents in relation to the application

accompanied by a bill to extend a patent hereto-
fore granted to Thomas J. Godman, which was

on the coast of Florida, and which was distributed
among the troops then stationed in Florida, asked
to be discharged front the further consideration of
the same; which was agreed to.
Mr. RUSK, from the Committee on the Post
Office and Post Roads, to which was referred the
petition of Isaac- Houston, asking compensation
for carrying the mail, submitted a report in writing,
which was ordered to be printed, accompanied
by a joint resolution for the relief of Isaac Houston,
which was read and ordered to a second reading.
Also, from the same commitiee, to which was
referred the petition of Samuel F. Bucterworth,
asking compensation for carrying the mail, sub-
mitted a report m writing, which was ordered to

I THE STATUE OP COLUMBUS.
! Mr. BUTLER. I desire to submit the follow-
ing resolution:
1 Resolved, That the Committee on the library inquire
; into the propriety of removing the-groupcontaning the statue
ot Columbus, from its present position on the east poriieo
of the Capitol, to a suitable place in some one of the public
squares.
! It is proper I should say that I do -not offer the
; resolution as a mark of disrespect to the artist; but
I 1 rather think these statues should be removed to
j some place in the public grounds, where perhaps
, they might be regarded as an ornament,
j Mr. WINTHROP. Is the Senator from South
j Carolina aware that a statue to match the one
; which he proposes to remove has already been
I ordered, to^ be placed on the opposite wing? I be-
; lieve such is the fact, and that probably it is al-
j ready on its way to this country,
i Mr BUTLER. I will only say that I con-
<; ferred with some persons in relation to this sub-
ji ject, and they concurred with me in the propriety
of removing this group.
The PRESIDENT. The resolution is not un-
der discussion.
Mr. DICKINSON. I would suggest that that
part of the resolution which relates to the public
grounds be struck out. I think I could find a
m uch more suitable place for it.
The PRESIDENT. The resolution is not un-
der discussion.
The resolution lies over under the rules.

Mr. FREMONT. Mr. President, I desire to
move that a day be set apart for the consideration
of business for the State of California. It is very-
important that something should be done for her,
and I therefore move that Friday next be appro-

On motion by Mr. DOUGLAS, the Senate pro-
ceeded to the consideration of a bill entitled " An
act to create the office of surveyor general of the
public lands m Oregon, and to provide for the sur-
vey, and to make donations to settlers of the public
lands.'' '
The p'ending amendment was one offered by
Mr. Davis, of Mississippi, when the bill was laat
under consideration on the 3d msunt, as follows:
" Add to the bill the words: And that such portions of
the public lands as may be designated uuder the authority
of the President of the United States for foits, magazines

certained, and the amount so ascertained shall be paid to

posed to be made by the Government, and^respasses
were said to have been made upon the rights of
