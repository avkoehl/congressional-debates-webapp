[Indorsement.]

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA, April 16, 1863.

Respectfully returned to the Adjutant and Inspector General.

The difference between the number of casualties appearing by this return and the number given in the first imperfect report of December 14, arises from the fact that the first report was made while the army was in order of battle, and there was no time to obtain full information. The number of slightly wounded was unusually large, and no report was made of them until the enemy had retired.

R. E. LEE.
