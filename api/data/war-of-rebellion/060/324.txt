MARTINSBURG, W. VA., January 1, 1864.

(Received 8. 25 p. m.)

General CULLUM,

Chief of Staff:

From information received here I report no enemy certainly this side of Winchester. I occupy all the important points on the roads as far as Bunker Hill with cavalry. A citizen from Berryville reports that the force that was at Strasburg moved up the valley to-day. I am certain that a scare of the pickets was magnified to a great extent, since the heavy firing reported on Tuscarora road turns out to be a salute for the new year.

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

Send along railroad. Notify all stations. Put Opequon on its guard. Move out a force strong enough to check the enemy. Let me know where they are. Keep town quiet.
