would be true only as to two millions instead
of four, for the reason that but one four-
million loan act ever was intended to go
into effect, and only one did, in fact, go into
effect; so that we have in these five items to
which I have called attention $8,255,000 which
should be eliminated at once from his table ;
and the same is true of many other items. It
would seem to me, however, quite sufficient to
show the utter untrustworthiuess of his esti-
mate to point out errors covering considerably
more than half of the total at which he
arrives.
I have not much patience to follow further
the remarkable financial fire-works which he
has let off.
TRUSI STATEMENT OF THE DISTRICT DEBT.
The majority of the committee reported to
Congress the exact indebtedness of the Dis-
trict, and I here reproduce it as my answer to
the gentleman. I give it in detail:
*' The indebtedness of the old corporation was as-
certained by a board convened to audit and marshal
the old debts. They reported, as the committee find:
Washington, D. C $2,966,093 27
Georgetown, D. C   261,463 37
Levy court District of Columbia  28,825 84
Total indebtedness of the late corpora-
tions   S3,256,382 48
** The board further report as additional indebted-
ness of the corporation of Washington the follow-
ing:
Trust funds.
Special tax fund  $22,874 04
Water fund  69,776 92
Canai fund y  68,022 04
Ten-year bond sinking fund  125,644 58
Total amount trust funds.,  $286,317 58
" The last amount was misapplied by the corpora-
tion of Washington by using trust funds to pay cur-
rent expenses ef the corporation, and thus it became
a debt for which the new government is forced to
provide.
"In addition to the foregoing were certain uncom-
pleted contracts which may be regarded as a debt
imposed by the old upon the new government.
These were for the construction of schopl-houses
a d paving of certain streets, and amount to
$707,338 71.
."There was also to be provided for certain overdue
and current interest upon the bonds of the late
corporations of Georgetown and Washington, which
was paid by the now government, and thus went to
swell the debt entailed upon the District. This
amounts to $131,258 60.
"The total indebtedness thus sot forth, and for
which the District government had to provide,
amounts to $4,381,297 37.
44 The indebtedness created by the new government
appears from the report of the comptroller as fol-
lows:
District of Columbia.
July 10,1871. Permanent-improvement bonds-
authorized, $4,000,000; not is-
sued, $2,000.000 $2,000,000 00
July 20,1871. "Vfater-stock bonds  450,000 00
August 23,1871. Market-stock bonds—
authorized, $300,000...Not issued.
October 18,1871. Chicago relief bonds-
authorized, $100,000...Not issued.
Total $2,450,000 00
The comptroller excludes the unissued bonds, but
the commineo regard the bonds as a debt, although
not yet issued, which gives a total of, $4,850,000 00
Adding to thistho amountof the debt of
old corporation above given  4,381,297 37
Makes total debt of the District of Co-
lumbia $9,231,297 37
BATE OP TAXATION.
My colleague is equally wide of the mark in
his estimate of the rate of taxation which
would inevitably follow this large debt. It is
probably true that if our debt was actually
what he has imagined it to be, the rate of tax-
ation would possibly increase nearly to the
estimate which he makes, but it is not exactly
fair to create an imaginary debt and then ex-
pect us to believe that it will require a particu-
lar rate of taxation to meet it. There is such
a thing in logic as having one's premises cor-
rect before reasoning from them. My col-
league cannot be wholly uafamiliar with that
fact. Let me quote my colleague's method of
ascertaining the probable rate of taxation.
He says the true estimate is as follows:
For the District fund $0 70
Lighting the city  15
Metropolitan police  20
The public schools  60
The ten-year bonds  10
Interest on four-million loan  37
Principal on said loan  22
New water-main  6
Piedmontrailroad  5
Interest on second four-million loan  37
Market-house bonds    7
For payment of the floating debt.'.  30
Interest on the funded debt  15
The seven-thirty certificates  25
Chicago fire-bonds    4
Total tax on every $100 valuation $3 63
Where my colleague gets his estimate I do
not know, but as it corresponds with one sub-
mitted to the committee by Mr. W. W. Moore,
of this city, I infer he has taken it from that
statement. Mr. Moore's estimate is found on
pages 418, 419.
My colleague ought at least to be willing to
do his informant the justice to state what he
said in relation to this estimate, if he is not
disposed to be scrupulous so far as his own
statements are concerned. It is due to Captain
Moore to give him the benefit, at least, of his
own computation. Turning to the testimony it
will be seen that this table was made up upon
a supposed state of facts which did not exist,
and which would change the result very much.
Mr. Moore's table shows(partofwhichhe says
is hypothetical) a tax of $3 G3 on every $100.
Subsequently he submired a corrected state-
ment showing it to4 bo $3 15J. (Pages 074
and 676.)
This matter I deem of sufficient importance
to warrant me in placing before Congress in
this connection as complete an answer as can
be made to this false estimate of our probable
taxation. That answer I believe is completely
made by the vice president of the Board of
Public Works, Mr. Shepherd, who reviews
Captain Moore's estimate in a letter to the
chairman of the District Committee, and I
give an extract from it. (See pages 676, 677.)
After pointing out at some length Captain
Moore's errors and eliminating several items
which are manifestly wrong, Mr. Shepherd
submits the following:
Summary.
" It is respectfully suggested that the aggregate of
taxes to belevied during the coming fiscalyear is to
be determined, not by more special pleading nor the
distortion of facts, but by a careful computation
and analysis of the current expenses of the govern-
ment of the District, including the interest on its
bonded debt. The following estimate of these is
submitted for the consideration of your honorable
committee:
Estimated expenditures.
Public schools  $400,000
Fire department  75,000
Metropolitan police  90,000
Lighting the city with gas  70,000
Ordinary and contingent expenses of the
government of the District of Columbia... 282,634
Interest and sinking fund on debt, esti-
mated at $8,000,000  600,000
Contingencies  100,000
$1,617,634
Estimated revenue.
Estimated assessment, (in round numbers,) $90,-
OuO.OOO. This amount, at $1 70 per $1U0, will
yield $1,530,000
Estimated revenue from licenses  150,000
Estimated revenue from water fund  40,000
$1,720,000
" The estimates of receipts and expenditures above
given are based upon the experience of tho past
year, and are, I believe, as nearly correct as it is pos-
sible to make them. The allowance for the inter-
est and principal oi the debt (which I have placed
at $8,000,000, and in which I have included the
$450,000 water loan) is, in my opinion, not only ample
but m excess of what wil) actually be required. '
"Permit me to say that I have endeavored to
make this statement as succinct, intelligible, and
accurate as possible, in order that the allegation of
excessive taxation, made to the detriment of the
interests of the entire community and to the injury
of our credit, may be promptly met and emphatically
disproved. It does seem to me that had Captain
Moore, turning aside from his efforts to exhibit our
local taxes in excess of their real rates, contributed
his abilities toward strengthening our tr^dit and
aiding our people in their endeavors to keep pace
with American progress, his action would have been
more in accord with his high reputation as a citizen
and a legislator/'*
I will remind my colleague of another im-
portant fact which in his flights of fancy he
seems to have forgotten, and that is that a
month before his speech was printed Congress
had passed an act, which represents the views
of the District government, providing that the
aggregate amount of taxes in any one year
shall not exceed two per cent, on the assessed
cash valuation of property.
All the mental gymnastics of my friend,
therefore, in attempting to create false impres-
sions with regard to the condition of affairs
here and the burdensome taxation which
awaits us, were entirely unnecessary, and cal-
culated to do much more harm than good.
EATE OF TAXATION COMPARED WITH OTHER CITIES.
Why my colleague seems to have become so
anxious about the taxation of this District,
when he knows that our taxes now are less
than almost any other city in the Union, and
in all probability will remain so, I cannot
understand. If he would turn some of his
attention to his own cities, and leave us, so long
as we are doing well enough, to manage our
own concerns, it would be quite as well.
Perhaps I ought here in this connection to
show by comparison the difference between
our taxation and that of sf>me of the other
cities of the Union. I quote from a report of
the commissioners appointed by the Governor
of his State (New York) to revise the laws for
the assessment and collection of taxes, (pages
9, 10:)
City of New York $2 27 on $100
City of Brooklyn   3 87 on 100
City of Rochester  6 70 on 100
City of Albany  4 57 on 100
City of Troy  4 30 on 100
City of Cincinnati  3 19 on 100
City of Philadelphia  1 80 on 100
Our tax is  1 70 on 100
Considering that fully one third of the prop-
erty of the city of Washington belongs to the
United States and pays no tax, while the im-
provements which are made here through-
out the city generally contribute as much to
advance the value of the Government prop-
erty as our own, it is certainly very creditable
to the management of our government that
we pay a less tax on the hundred dollars than
any of the cities named, and this fact becomes
still more creditable when we consider that the
improvements made by way of paving streets,
laying sewers, &c., are not paid for by the
property abutting on the streets improved
wholly, as in other cities, but that two thirds
of this expense are assessed against the whole
property of the city. I challenge the gentle-
man from New York to find anywhere better
management with lower rate of taxation, and
I challenge him to show any reasonable ground
for his apprehension that our taxes will be
increased to $3 63 upon the hundred dollars,
as he states.
NEGOTIATION OF THE FOUH-MILLION LOAN.
In discussing this matter of debt of the Dis-
trict my colleague refers to the manner in
which the four-million loan was negotiated as
not the least remarkable feature of our debt.
Let me follow him through this branch of his
speech, which is equally unfair and unjust, par-
* By recent act of the Legislative Assembly of the
.District, levying taxes for 1S7J, the rate is fixed at
. 70 on the $100; the same as heretofore.
