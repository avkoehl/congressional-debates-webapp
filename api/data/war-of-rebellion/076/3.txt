CORRESPONDENCE, ORDERS, AND RETURNS RELATING TO OPERATIONS IN THE ATLANTA CAMPAIGN, FROM JULY 1, 1864, TO SEPTEMBER 8, 1864.*

UNION CORRESPONDENCE, ETC.

NEAR KENESAW, July 1, 1864.

(Received 1 p.m. 2d.)

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

General Thomas offered General Crittenden a good division-Butterfield's, in Hooker's corps-but Crittenden declines, on the ground that he formerly commanded a corps in the same army. A division is the legitimate command of a major-general, and he having declined I am released of the promise made through you to give General Crittenden a command.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.

NEAR KENESAW, GA., July 1, 1864-9.30 p.m.

(Received 12 m. 2d.)

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Washington, D. C.:

General Schofield is now south of Olley's Creek, and on the head of Nickajack. I have been hurrying down provisions and forage, and to-morrow night propose to move General McPherson from the left to the extreme right, back of General Thomas. This will bring my right within three miles of Chattahoochee and about five of the railroad. By this movement I think I can force Johnston to move his army down from Kenesaw, to defend his railroad crossing and the Chattahoochee, when I will, by the left flank, reach the railroad below Marietta; but I cut loose from the railroad with ten day's supplies in wagons. Johnston may come out of his intrenchments and attack General Thomas, which is what i want, for General Thomas is well intrenched, parallel with the enemy, south of Kenesaw. I think Allatoona, and the line of the Etowah are strong enough for me to venture on this move. The movement is substantially down the Sandtown road, straight for Atlanta.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.
