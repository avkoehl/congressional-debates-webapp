is steadily on the increase, and that during the present spring and summer the military powers and resources of our State will be largely and liberally devoted to the cause of the Confederate States. You are apprised that in the present posture of Kentucky I am almost powerless in the enforcement of the conscript law or in the means of returning our officers and soldiers to their commands, and little can be effected in drawing from my State the quartermaster's and commissary stores in which she so largely abounds. I can, however, assure you that no effort will be spared and no opportunity neglected to animate and urge our people to the fullest co-operation in the prosecution of the cause of our liberties and independence. I am now engaged in setting on foot a communication with our firm friends in Kentucky from which I hope such organizations as will materially increase our political and military forces, and which will, as I hope to a valuable extent, aid in supporting the commissary and quartermaster's service of the country.

Very respectfully, yours,

R. HAWES,

Provisional Governor of Kentucky.

It is impossible to determine to what extent prices will advance and the Commissary-General can only approximately conjecture.

Respectfully submitted.
