Surg. J. S. Sparks, of the Eighth Tennessee Volunteer Infantry, of the Third Division. I shall have occasion before I close this report to speak of the services rendered by these gentlemen.

The next great military movement was the advance upon the enemy's position at Kenesaw Mountain, covering Marietta and the Chattahoochee. The general hospital was retained at Allatoona and improved as far as practicable. The field hospitals were established in the rear of their respective divisions, and the wounded transferred from there to Allatoona as fast as they became full. The distance was twelve to fifteen miles, and the roads in very bad condition. This method was pursued until the turning of the left wing of Johnston's army was successfully accomplished and Marietta uncovered. This town was immediately made the depot of quartermaster's and commissary supplies, and also the hospital center. I beg leave to refer to the accompanying report* of the acting medical inspector of the department for a full description of the flying field hospital of the Army of the Ohio, which was immediately transferred from Allatoona. The same method was observed in regard to the hospital at Marietta as had been when located at Allatoona. The wounded were transferred as rapidly as possible from the division to the general hospital, first by wagons (well padded with cotton when it would be procured or with pine boughs) and afterward by rail. This duty was superintended by Surgeon Wilder, and too much praise cannot be awarded him for his zeal, intelligence, energy, and humanity. At this period a careful inspection of the entire command was made, and I herewith inclose the report.* The crossing of the Chattahoochee followed, made first by the Twenty-third Army Corps, under the immediate supervision of Major-General Schofield, on the 8th of July, and the battle of the 19th, 20th, and 22nd followed, in all which the Twenty-third Army Corps was engaged. The wounded were equally promptly cared for, and the operations were in all cases primary. They were transferred with care and rapidly to the now well furnished and comfortable hospital at Marietta. On the 1st of August the Twenty-third Army Corps began its movement to the right with the view of cutting the East Point railroad, or taking the station of that name.

This maneuver was followed by the battle of Utoy Creek on the 3d, skirmishing during the succeeding days, and an assault on the 6th. During these engagements, field receiving and operating depots were established near the front, while the main division hospitals were kept some distance in the rear and beyond Utoy Creek.

The assault of the 6th was repulsed, and many of the wounded were left on the ground until the succeeding day, when the extension of our lines to the right compelled the enemy to leave their position and permitted our stretcher-bearers to gather the wounded and bring them in. The position, gradually extended to the right, was held till the 29th instant. There was no severe fighting, but constant skirmishing and a few wounded every day, not averaging more than 8 or 10. On the 29th the last great flank movement commenced. It was preceded by removing the sick and wounded to the general hospital at Marietta and sending back such men as would not be able, in all probability, to make the march. They were transferred by wagons and ambulances to the railroad, a dis-
