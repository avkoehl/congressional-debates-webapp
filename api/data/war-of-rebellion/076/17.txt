moving out of Memphis, as they suppose, to re-enforce us. This will hold Forrest there. Now will be a good time for the raid from Decatur on Opelika. It should consist of not over 2,500 cavalry. No wagons or artillery, or at most a section, and should move first on Pillow, at Oxford or Talladega, and then pass him rapidly, cross the Tallapoosa, and break up the road. If you agree with me I will order it now.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.

Major-General SHERMAN:

I think now would be a good time for the expedition to Opelika if you have any good officers to place in command. I have heard that Roddey also had moved west of Tuscumbia, evidently attracted in that direction by the movements of Smith.
