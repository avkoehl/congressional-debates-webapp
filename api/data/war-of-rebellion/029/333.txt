The movement by the flank was a fortunate one for us, for had we remained any longer in that position we would have been cut to pieces or taken prisoners by the enemy, who were in great force on our front. After moving to the right and rear about half a mile, we formed a line of battle in a meadow behind a fence, where we were joined by the remnants of the four companies which were on picket the night before. After sending out two companies as skirmishers across a field to a fence directly in our front, we moved up to the same place, and the action commenced.

General Kirk having been wounded early in the morning, and Colonel Dodge, of this regiment, having taken command of the Second Brigade, the command of this regiment fell upon the undersigned.

After the regiment upon our left and we had sustained the enemy's fire for some time, the Seventy-ninth Illinois Volunteers advanced to our immediate right and supported us gallantly; but being outflanked by a superior force of the enemy, and exposed to a heavy cross-fire, they fell back, and we were obliged to do the same, having no support whatever, and having suffered heavy loss, as hereinafter stated. In retiring, the men became very much scattered, but were mostly collected again, and then we were ordered to the front, on the right of the Murfreesborough turnpike, 3 miles from the town.

January 1, after erecting breastworks we remained behind them, without any further active service, except skirmishing on picket line.

January 2, the same routine of duty as the day previous, except in the evening, when the left wing was sent out with parts of other regiments of this brigade as skirmishers to feel the position of the enemy; but after receiving a severe fire, and supposing the enemy to be in force, we returned their fire briskly for some time and then retired to the breastwork.

January 3, same routine of picket-duty as the day previous. It is unnecessary for me to particularize the services of any officer or man, for both officers and men performed their duties well and gallantly.

I have also a statement of the killed, wounded, and missing to submit, as follows:

Killed............................................... 30

Wounded.............................................. 108

Missing and prisoners................................ 70

Number in battle:

Commissioned officers................................ 24

Enlisted men......................................... 463

All of which is respectfully submitted.
