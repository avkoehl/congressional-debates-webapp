INDIAN HOSTILITIES
Mr  CAMBRELLNG lemarked that he was sure there was a
general desire en the part of the House that they should go on
with this bill, and therefore he asked the House now to pioceed
to us consideraron
Mr SERGEANT said, before Una question was propounded
to the House, he wished to ask the chairman of the Committee
of Ways and Means when hepioposed to call up the bdl to esta
bhsh what was termed a Sub Treasury, oi Independent frea
suiy?
Mi CAMBRELENG replied, that, with the approbation of
the Houie lie hoped to íearh it some time next week The
great anxiety felt to act on the pie eruption bill was such, (hit
he wt idd not inteipose any obstacle to it, but the moment tnat
measure was disponed ol, he should call up the Independent
Tieasmy bul
Tne House, agreeing to Mr Cambreleng a motion, accord-
ingly took up the "bill making appropnations foi preventing

arrearages (or 1837 "
The bill had been repoited from the Committee of the Whole

lokee couutiy now contemplated, he is Ut-ieby authomed to
apply two millions to the sum appropriated by this act to that
object "
This amendment was excepted toby Mr Camdreikno, who

Mi Um l had been instructed to move by the Committee on
Indian Afluís
' b&c And beit fui ther enacted. That the further sum

Mi Wl-tC returned, and concluded his remarks, and the de
lute was continued by Mctori GRAHAM, iilDHLL, and LE
«arc
Mr LEG MIT hiving concluded his remarks, he w is follow
edbyMr DOWMMJ both in ¡-Uppmtof the b.l!, when
Mi f UallMAN obtained the 11 ¡or, and remaikín? thit,
though thf te was one tnitmlment he ielt very strongly ineiiii
cd to vote m favoi of, that w is t1 e Amendment of the Commit
(to on Indian Ail ins but soeuv no piubabihty of bringing this
deb lie to a close w ithout applying that usetul rule ol the IJousv,
the previoiiftqutetion he thereioiedemandod it, and hoped the
House would sustain the motion
Mi MARTIN moved a call of the House, but subsequently
withdrew u
Mi EVMtETT called for the reading of the original bill,
and the amendment made thereto in Committee of the Whole,
whuh was otdered
The House refused to second the call for the previous ejues
tton—aves 62, noes not counted
Mr U1DIH.E rose amid the most vociferous calh for ques
tion Aom all parta of the Hall, anu made a brief rejomdei to
Mr Downing
Mi CAMPBELL of/Tennessee then made a brief defence of
(he Tennessee volunteers, from some charge of misconduct
alleged m have been brought against them by Geneial Jesup,
thoi.gh he admitted the possibility oi Gen Aunstrong declining
for them the laboi of common laboiei*, thoueh they nevei
disobey* d in or ¡er of my kind fiom Gen Jt.?up
Mr DOWNING made a brief reply to Mr BIDDLE, and
that gentleman again rejoined with much warmth, when the
several amendments proposed to the body of the bill weie all
agieed to
Mr GRAHAM of North Carolina called for the yeis and
nays, on agreeing to the amendment of Mr Bell, as printed m
last evening's paper  winch were ordered
Mr GARLAND ni Louisiana inquired of the mover of the
amendment if the two millions proposed in it were an addi
tional sum to the means provided lor in the bill, or were to be
taken out of them
Mr BELL explained that his obiect was to take the two mil
hone out of the means reported by the Committee of V  ays
and Means for the support ufan army of six thousand men in
the Cherokee countiy
The question waa then taken on this amendment, and it wa 
decided in the negative—yeas 90, nays 112
So the amendment was rejected, and the question recurring
upon concurring in the amendment ougmally reported from the
Committee on Indian Affairs, thereon—
Mr CUSHMAN ealled for the yeas and nays, which were
ordeied
Mr McKAY called for a division of the question, and it being
taken on the first branch of the proposition, lihe whole of this
amendment was also printed in last evening's Globe,] the result
was—yeas 189 nays 15
So the first branch of the amendment was concurred m
The question then íecurring upon the second branch of the
amendment—
Mr McKAY explained that he had called for a division of
the question for the reason, that though he was pei fectly wil
ling to vote an appropriation conformable to the lecommenda
tion of the Secretary of War, he was unwilling to vote so largo
a sum to pay these Indian claims Mr McK undeistood they
had all been examinedmto and long since rejected by Congress,
but even if they were allowed, they would not exceed about
$35 000 though he honestly believed nothing at all was clue In
legnd to btankets medicines, etc they could easily be pur
cha-ed out of the $1 040,000, and appiopnated i  the fust branch
ot the amendment The truth was, he behevi d the real obiect of
this item waa to place the $100 000 in the hands of the Execu
tive as scciet «ervice money, to buy up the Cherokee delegation
in this city who weie hostile to the trtMty
Mi THOMPSON would suaeest to ihc gentleman, as a suit
able mode of carrying out of this system of economy, to «pa
ciiy the medicines, and to pie^cube that they should tonaist of
nothing but lobelia, as that drug was theaper thm calomel'
The gentleman would not trust a sum of S100 000 to the di^cie
tion of the Pie'ident, but Mr T would have tl ought bettei
of it, if the aentleman upon a lormei occasion had not voted to
trust the then Executive with the dibcretion of a three millions
appropriation
Mr EVERETT stated that he had advocated this appropn
ation in committee, in ordei to facilitate the removal, and that
no objection should be made th it there was a want oi articles
necessary m effecting it He had not advocated it for the pur
poses intimated by the gentleman from North Carolina, nor
did he wish the House to vote foi it on such ground I( theap
propnation was not for necessaries for the Indians, he hoped
it would be rejected If it was for necessaries, he hoped n
would he made by the House
The second branch of the amendment waa then concurred in
—ye is 174, nay«20
Mr EVLREIT then moved further to amend by adding a
clause of $10 000 for making treaties with the Indian tube" *"
Mr HOPKlNft then demand d the previous question, which
was seconded, 84 to 61
Mi EVER EFT called for the yeas and nays on ordering tho
mam question, but they were íefused. and the question was or
dered wuhouta division
Mr GRAII\M of Nouh Carolina then called foithe yeas ami
nayf on the main question, being the engrossment of the bdl,
but they were refund, and the question prevailed without a di
vision, and the bill oi dered to a third reading and put on its pas
sage, on which
Mr   I L WILLIAMS of Tennessee called for the yeas and
nays, which, being oideied, were 143 to 37
h > the bill was passed
Mr CHAPMAN, on leave, submitted the following resolu
tion which was agreed to

TERRITORIAL BüSÍJNESS,
This being one of the da>5 set apart for the cob-
sideranon of bilis relating to the Territories,
Mr. WHITTLESEY of Ohio suggested that th 
committees be called on for reports this morning.
Mr. YELL ^ud he must object to it, much as he
disliked to do so, for these were the only two days
the Territories would have, and he thought no
other business should interpose.
Mr CASEY, from the Committee oh the Pub-
lic Lands, reported, with an amendment, Senate
feill to grant a quantity of land to th* Territory of
