BACON'S HOUSE, August 20, 1864.

Major-General Cleburne:

In the absence of Captain McDowell I report that a scout is just in. He reports that he saw four Federal scouts about three miles below here on the railroad, and heard that the enemy's infantry and cavalry are on the railroad (both sides), about four miles below here. I have just sent out a reliable scout to find out by actual sight the truth of the matter. Since writing the above two accounts have come in who report a pretty heavy force on infantry at trimble's Mill. I send this by one of the last-named scouts, so that you can question him yourself. He is a reliable scout.

Respectfully,

J. A. ANDERSON,

Captain, Commanding Camp of Detach. of Cav. from Armstrong's Brigadier
