When practicable, two-sevenths flour and five-sevenths corn-meal will be issued. DIVISION commanders are charged with the duty of supplying green corn in quantities to make up the deficiencies in the ration of corn-meal. The ration of bacon has been reduced to one-THIRD of a pound by order of the War Department.

III. Inspectors of commissary stores for condemnation or disposal will be made by brigade, DIVISION, or army inspectors, or some officer of the Inspector-General's Department, specially designated by the Inspector-General for that purpose. In cases where delay would cause further damage and loss to the Government, as in cases of condemned flour or meal, bacon or beef, the inspection and recommendation of the brigade, DIVISION, or army inspector shall be sufficient. In all other cases the approval of the Inspector-General of the Army must be had.

IV. DIVISION commanders will require provision returns to be made up for DIVISIONS, based on actual strength present, including officers and authorized servants, with 10 per cent. added for contingencies, and the correctness of same examined and approved by DIVISION commanders. The provision return will then be submitted by DIVISION commissaries to Major W. E. Moore, assistant chief of subsistence, who will compare the same with the morning report furnished him from this office, and, if found correct, will approve and order issue.

The records of your office and the Adjutant-General's will show that from July, 1862, when I first went too Monroe, I was asking for troops to defend the country, and particularly the railroad from Vicksburg to Monroe, which I regarded as a vital element in the defense. At that time I had (nominally, for sickness was terrible) about 3,000 men, badly armed. It was thought by my superiors that the troops were not needed there, and the Thirtieth [Twenty-eighth] Regiment, Colonel [Henry] Gray, was sent to Southern Louisiana; the Thirty-first Regiment, Colonel [C.
