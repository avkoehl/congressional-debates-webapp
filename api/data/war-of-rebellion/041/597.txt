HEADQUARTERS DEFENSES OF NEW ORLEANS,June 25, 1863-10.20 a. m.

Lieutenant COOLEY:

The cavalry must be held at Boutte Station, to cover the River road leading to Boutte Station, as long as Boutte Station is occupied. I wish no artillery left there, as I do not intend to hold the place except with cavalry patrol on the River road. You know the enemy have half of our rolling-stock on the other end of the road, and Cahill must break up the communication in his rear as he comes along, particularly Des Allemands Bridge.

By command of Brigadier-General Emory:

[FRANK W. LORING,]

Aide-de-Camp.
HEADQUARTERS DEFENSES OF NEW ORLEANS,June 25, 1863.

Major-General BANKS:

The enemy's force at Brashear and on this side is known and ascertained to be at least 9,000, and may be more.

He has part of our rolling-stock, and is working this way. The city is quiet on the surface, but the undercurrent is in a ferment. The mystery to me is where the enemy got boats to cross Berwick Bay, and in face of the gunboat.

I still think you should have a brigade, at least, in reserve, with transport ready to move here at a moment's notice.

W. H. EMORY,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DEFENSES OF NEW ORLEANS,June 25, 1863.

Major-General BANKS:

Colonel Stickney has arrived, and reports Cahill's force all safe, and on its way to the city.

W. H. EMORY,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

Colonel CAHILL:

I will keep one regiment at Boutte, with a picket advance at Des Allemands, for the present, but I do not wish to keep many troops from this city until after your arrival here, when I will consult with you about it.

By command of Brigadier-General Emory:

W. D. SMITH,

Lieutenant-Colonel, and Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEFENSES OF NEW ORLEANS,June 25, 1863.

Colonel CAHILL:

I have telegraphed you that the regiments would take the same places they had before, except the regiment left at Boutte.
