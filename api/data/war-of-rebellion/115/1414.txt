in Jefferson, Patterson's army passed by. A man whose name he does not rehim a good place. The offer was made at Halltown, above Harper's Ferry. His counsin, Henry Dixon, lived in Halltown; another cousin, Joseph Dixon, lived three miles above there. Another man, Edmund Allen, a relation of his wife, lived in another part of the county. Says he was several days in Jefferson. Says the offer of a place in the army was made on the road. He passed a tent in which some officers of the enemy were. Some one told an officer to call him. This was on the way from Harper's Ferry. The enemy's army was camped all the way. Prisoner says he was on horseback in company with a man he did not know who was looking for a negro he had lost. Prisoner asked the officer if he did not want the man who was looking for the negro. The officer asked prisoner if he did not belong to Carter's Loudoun Cavalry. Prisoner said he had belonged to it. Officer then asked him to go with them and prisoner refused. Says this was on his way home from Jefferson. It was in July, after his grain was stacked. Says he staid at home all the time after he was in Jefferson except one trip to Maryland. Went in latter part of July same route by Harper's Ferry; forded the river; some troops at Frederick; cannot tell who commanded them. Passed the pickets at Harper's Ferry. Told them he wanted to see his odl mother. They let him pass through. Had no communication with them or any person connected with them. Staid five or six days. Came back the same way. This was after harvest and after militia came back home. Says he was in Maryland once before harvest, twice since; was twice in Jefferson, once when he visited his relations, once when he went to Maryland; then he stopped at his counsin's. On this occasion says he met the Hendersn home guard. They did not stop him; they did not know him; he knew some of them; had seen them at Halltown; does not remember any of their names; knew the mother and sister of one of the men; cannot remember their names. Says on his last trip to Maryland moing to join the Southern army. Told him what road to take; cannot remember his name. As to Carter's company says he was discharged at the time of the John Brown raid. The discharge was confirmed by the court-martial. Had Galleher's company affidavit shown him. He denied its truth. Says Galleher came twice to see him, and would not see him. Galleher conversed with Krantz's wife. The third night he did see Galleher. Says he designed to have him arrested. He proposed to him to go to Circeleville, but designed to take him through FEtterman where he could have [him] arrested. Galleher and prisoner arrested before he got to Fetterman. Prisoner says when he was in Maryland he was looked on as a Southern spy. Says he wrote to President Davis offering to procure information if a pass was given him. Says a party of Mead's cavalry came to his house to arrest him, but he was from home; he had gone to buy shingles. He then wrote to General Evans offering to surrender himself if a pass was given him. Evans told Cadlewll he had given him a pass. Says some men from Virginia formed a home guard in Maryland. Says Working did not join it and prisoner would not.

I have given this long statement of Krantz's* examination, as it shows his inconsistencies and prevarications, and as the circumstances of his arrest were peculiar I think he should not be discharged.

Commissioner.
