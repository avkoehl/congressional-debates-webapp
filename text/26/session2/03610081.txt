under sixteen years old, of officers who shall be
killed, or die by reason of wounds received in the
line of duty." This was the fir-t d parture from
the act of 1800, and, admitting the propriety of
giving the pub'ic money to widows and children,
whether the officer possessed extraordinary ment oi
not, and without proof that the assistance of Go-
vernment was needed, there can be no doubt that
the promise of Congress was violated by thus
using the návy pension fond In 1814, the provi-
sions of this last act were extended to the "widows
and children of seamen and mermes"—in 181G,
pensions were granted to those «ho were wounded
at Dartmoor prison," or * the widows and children
of such as were killed there " Afterward*, at dif-
ferent periods, the acts of 1813 and 1814 were re
newed, and m 1834 a law was passed granting
pensions to the "widows of officers, seamen, and
marines" who may die from "casualties, dicea e
contracted, or injures received in the Uns of duty,"
and directing that the pension "shall com-
mence from the pas age of the act" though the
husband may still be living, and leceiving
his regular pay Thus inroaas wery gradually
made on the fund, and its original objec was for-
gotten, yet the interest wasmore than sufficient to meet
these demands, and the principal amouuted to up
wards of a million of dollars at the close of the
year 183G
The law of 1837, vhich my amendment repeals,
was then parsed, ard a new doctrine was slipped
into the statute book, it gave pensions to the wi-
dows, and, if no widows, 'o the children of officers,
seamen, and marines, "whs have died ormay here-
after die in the naval service" Hcwever unjust
and impolitic previous acts had been, they were not
complained of, because the benefit accrued to the re
latives of such a  "were killed, or died by reason of
wounds received in the hn° of duty"—but now if a sai or
should die from an ordinary disease, or the consti-
tution of an officer be broken aown by dissipation,
their widows and children are entitled to the ams
pensions as those of the men who fall in battle
Hnndreds, therefore, rushed upon the pension fund,
and we need not be surprised that it has been nearly
consumed, in 1836 the annual charge was $58,009,
in 1838 it reached to $103,120 33, and in six
months—from March to September, 1837—the re
trospective operation of the law took $329,615 from
the Treasury.
It is true that something has been lost by the de-
preciation of State stocks, but m what should ihe
investment have been made1 We have heard a
great noise about the attack on State credit, and
now the Administrate n is assailed became it

But this is a small matter, the act of 1837 has done
the mischief, ?nd the question is, shall it be re-
pealed, or shall it be permitted to eat tip the re-
mainder of the lund, and finally be settled on
the general Treasury' I understard that the
American army is more liberally paid than that
of England, excepting officers of the highest grade
If, however, it can be shown that officers or men
receive less than the corresponding clasfes of civil
life, their compensation s^oald be increased. The

The member from Mas achusetts [Mr. Adams]
thinks that the act of '37 made a contract, w'ncti
we are bound to fulfil An cb'igation, sir, implies
that sometmng is given oi done on bo h sides, and
as tne g ntlerr an sometimes quotes BUckstone, it
is odd that he overlooked the great lawyer on the
present occasion The 'aw of 1800 was undoubt-
edly a contract, becauss it was passed at an caily
period, and may have induced many to hazard
th ir lives m the service, it also embraced tie con
dition of "wounds," "disability," and extiaordmary
gallantry, which must be complied with before its
advantages could be partaken. But the couniry is
not indebted to th^se who receive pensions under
the act of 1837, the husband or father en'ist*d vo-
luntarily, was paid well, treated kindly, and there
is not the si ghtest evidence of greaf suffering or

genuine patriot, having passed through all the
offices of trust known to the Constitution, and pos-
sessing a vigorous intellect, he might become the
father and the idol of this House When younger

so great is the strife that the most sanguine occa-

conciliatory feeling, and just legislation, would

Tu bill to establish a permanent prospective
