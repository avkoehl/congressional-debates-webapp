succeeded, as far as it was possible to do so with the means at their disposal.

When, on the second day of the battle, it became evident that the territory occupied by our hospitals would fall in possession of the enemy, I directed a sufficient number of surgeons and attendants to remain in charge, and not to deserted the wounded in any event. These officers were exposed to much danger, as the contending armies swept past; but they remained faithfully at their posts, and were unceasing in their attentions to the wounded during the three days that elapsed before the recovery of this territory by our troops.

The enemy took from them a large portion of the medical and hospital stores and instruments,and our men were compelled to seek for dressing materials, bedding,&amp;c., among the families in the rear of the lines. Much kind assistance was received from citizens in the vicinity, and no violence was experienced at the hands of the Confederate soldiers.

It affords me much pleasure to bear testimony to the efficiency and self-denial of the medical officers of the right wing. During that long week of hardship and exposure they labored day and night, regardless of their own safety and comfort, and only anxious for the well-being of the wounded intrusted to their care.

I have the honor to remain, your most obedient servant,

C. McDERMONT,
