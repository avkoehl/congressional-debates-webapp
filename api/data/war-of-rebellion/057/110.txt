General Elliott's division has captured in all, since we reached this side the river, some 75 prisoners. I am sending a detachment to-day to destroy the pontoon across mouth of Chucky.

Numbers 2. Reports of Colonel Edward M. McCook, Second Indiana Cavalry, commanding First Cavalry Division.
HEADQUARTERS FIRST CAVALRY DIVISION, January 22, 1864.

GENERAL: I send the orderly, who knows the road to my headquarters. A scouting party of the First Tennessee captured a Captain Bennett, commissary on General Benning's staff, Hood's division, and 7 men who were out looking for forage.

The First Tennessee and Colonel Palmer's force are out after a forage train, and I think will get hem, unless the guard is too strong. I will move my command before day, so that their withdrawal will not be noticed from the other side.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,EDWARD M. McCOOK,

Colonel, Commanding.

Brigadier-General ELLIOTT,

Commanding Cavalry.

BREMNER'S CHURCH, TENN., January 23, 1864.

CAPTAIN: Your order for destroying their pontoon was received at 3 p. m. The party detailed (200 strong) started at 4. Miller's scout
