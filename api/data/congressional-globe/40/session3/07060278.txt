possible, into all the local communities intd which
the State or the country is divided; and this objec-
tion. from my point of view, deserves respectful
treatment and respectful answer. I hare to observe,
then, that in my opinion particular localities within
the State would have a due voice and due influence
in the selection of candidates; that if they were se-
lected by a common body, by a State convention,
any attempt to disfranchise any particular section
of the State would bo met by a counter combination
in the interest of fair play, and that the practical
result would be that there would be on the whole a
fair distribution of political power in the different
parts ol the State by the selection of candidates. If,
however, any difficulty were apprehended on this
ground there might be a rule adopted by which
aominationsshould bcmadebydistricts.athingvery
often done in counties and also in States. It would
be a rule to a party in makingitsselection thatthere
should be a distribution of its candidates according
to district divisions, either those established for
other purposes by some general State law or estab-
lished by the particular party organization for its
own purposes of selection or distribution.
"But the conclusive answer to the objection is
this, that any important locality would have the
power to defend itself against such injustice, and
that is one of the merits of this system of cumulative
voting. If there was an attempt to disfranchisethe
city of Philadelphia, to prevent her returning her
four members to Congress, and the thing was gross
and glaring, what could she do under a system of
cumulative voting? Just combine her vote on her
four men and elect them in spite of all the other
electors in the State, and thus any attempt at injus-
tice in any section of the Commonwealth might be
resented by the people aggrieved by cumulating
their votes upon one or more local candidates of
their own. They could defeat any such attempt at
injustice and defend themselves against it, and the
fact that they had such power of defense would
always secure a just distribution of nominations."
THE ELECTORAL COLLEGES, THEIR DEFECTS AND FAIL-
URE, AND REJIKDIES PROPOSED.
By Colonel J. R. Wheeler, Statistical Bureau,
Treasury Department.
"Thisnation has recently passed through an ex-
eitiug election for President, and the electors have
met at the capitals of each Stateand cast their vote.
"We propose to show that the present mode of
election of President and Vice President does not
guaranty "a republican form of government" or
carry out the intentions of the framers of the Con-
stitution or the will of the people, which is the founda-
tion of our torm of government.
Wo are aware of the reluctance which exists to
disturb the provisions of the Constitution or the cus-
toms of the nation. But this very Constitution has
been amended again and again, and once in regard
to this veiy question.
'* Under the second article of the Constitution the
electors, appointed in such manner as the Legisla-
tures of the States may direct, meet in their respect-
ive States and vote by ballot lor two persons; the
persou having the majonty of the whole number of
electors appointed shall be President, and the per-
son having the next greatest number of votes shall
be Vice President.
"By this mode the first President (Washington)
was elected twice, (1788 and 1792,) and John Adams
(in 1796) once.
"in consequence of the violence to the popular
will attempted to be done through this mode, this
article was amended in 1804, (September 25,) and the
electors required to name in their ballots the per&on
voted for as President, and in distinct ballots the per-
son voted for as Vice President. They are to make
a list of all the persons voted for, and the number of
votes for each, which they are to transmit to the
President of the Senate, who, in the presence of the
Senate and House of Representatives, shall count the
votes and declare who is chosen. Thus the matter
now stands. We propose to show, as previously
stated, that this mode as now used does not carry out
theintention ot the framers of the Constitution : that
it is not a fairhtul indication of popular will, and
therefore is subversive of the principle that lies at
the foundation of our Government—that the will of
the people lawfully expressed should be inviolate.
If this is so this mode should be abolished.
As to the.in tent of the framers of the Constitution
we are not left iu doubt. Alexander Hamilton, of
New York, a member of the Convention which
formed the Constitution, in No. 68 of the Federalist
acknowledged that the mode as prescribed for the
election of the President by electors chosen by the
people ions objectionable. He says:
"' The Convention which formed the Constitution
did not desire the appointment of President to de-
pend on preexisting bodies ot men who might bo
tampered with beforehand to prostitute their votes.'
"The mode was suggested by the practice of the
Germanic Confederation: and this was that the elect-
ors or people shouldchoose as their representatives
or electors men of high character, capablc and hon-
est, above influences of place or power—for no per-
son holding an office of trust or profit under the Uni-
ted States can be an elector—and these electors,
unbiased by party partialities and prejudices, uu-
awed by power, impervious to tbeseducfions of plac<\
but guided only by patriotism and virtue, should
select some citizen of the nation, eminent from his
services, virtues, and talents as Chief Magistrate.
" It tii is be the true intent of the framers of the Con-
stitution how widely does the practice differ frdm
the intent I Any one who has ever witnessed the
assembling of the electors of any State can but have
felt the ridiculous mockery with which as mere au-
tomatons they carry out the edict which a caucus or
convention has already dictated, and for an elector
to vary therefrom or dare to follow the convictions
of his judgment would be political suicide, although
it is his constitutional right so to do. One case only
occurs to our memory in the history of our Govern-
ment where an elector has ventured to exercise this
unquestioned right. In 1820 Mr. William Plummer,
elected in New Hampshire as an elector to choose a
President, voted for John Quincy Adams (who was
not then a candidate or the nominee of any party)
against James Monroe. He was doomed to political
death. This incident was the more singular as it
was the only vote castin any electoral college against
Mr. Monroe. This gave occasion to tho caustic re-
mark of John [Randolph, of Virginia, in Congress,
that * Mr. Monroe came in by unanimous consent and
went out of offiee by unanimov# consent.'
"That the mode now used may beno indication of
the wishes of the people, may fail in many instances
to carry out their will, and, in fact, be at variance
with and iri opposition thereto, the examples in our
political history, as we will presently show, abun-
dantly prove.
"In 1800 this mode had nearly placed in the pres-
idential chair Aaron Burr, for which high position it
is well known he did not receive a single electoral
or popular vote.
"In 1824, under this mode, John Quincy Adams was
placed in the presidential chair ngainstthe declared
wishes of a majority of tho people, for he was in a
minority in both the electoral and popular vote.
Wehaveprepared a table of tho popular and electoral
vote. The electoral vote is given iioui the organiza-
tion of the Government; the popular vote is only
from 1824. This vote has no constitutional existence,
and no Federal record officially presents it. Prior to
the adoption of the amendment in 1804 'he mode of
choosing electors was so heterogeueous, by the Legis-
latures, by districts, and by thfe people, that no ac-
curate or perfect compilation concerning it is extant
worthy of confidence. Even after the adoption of
this amendment very maivy States continued to
choose electors by the Legislature, (notably New
Jersey, North Carolina, South Carolina, and occasion-
ally Connecticut. Massachusetts. New York, and
Vermont.) In the election of 1824 the electors for
President and Vice President in Delaware, Georgia,
Louisiana, South Carolina* New York, and Vermont
werechosenby the Legislatures of those States. Of
the election ot 1820. back to which tho table of popu-
lar vote extends, Niles's Register of 18fh November,
1820, has this item: 'In Maryland and Virginia the
election of electors excites so little interest because
there was no thought of opposition that very few
votes were east, only seventeen at Richmond.' ilence
of the popular vote, as before stated, no complete
record is extant. Tho following table is as complete
as possible and worthy ot careful study:

"(It is to be remembered that the State of South
Carolina continued to choose electors by her Legis-

so that no popular vote from her is included in the
above returns prior to 1868. As she is, however, a
State of the third or fourth rank in population the
absence of her vote does not greatly affect the com-
pleteness or accuracy of our exhibit.)
