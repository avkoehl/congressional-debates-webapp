PROCLAMATION.

KNOXVILLE, TENN., April 23, 1862.

TO THE DISAFFECTED PEOPLE OF EAST TENNESSEE:

The undersigned in executing martial law in this department assures those interested who have fled to the enemy's lines and who are actually in their army that he will welcome their return to their homes and families; they are offered amnesty and protection if they come to lay down their arms and act as loyal citizens within the thirty days given them by Major General E. Kirby Smith to do so.

At the end of that time those failing to return to their homes and accept the amnesty thus offered and provide for and protect their wives and children in East Tennessee will have them sent to their care in Kentucky or beyond the Confederate State lines at their own expense.

All that leave after this date with a knowledge of the above facts will have their families sent immediately afte them.

The women and children must be taken care of by husbands and fathers either in East Tennessee or in the Lincoln Government.

W. M. CHURCHWELL,

Colonel and Provost-Marshal.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF EAST TENNESSEE,Knoxville, April 23, 1862.

First Lieutenant JULIUS M. RHETT,

Battalion of Artillery, C. S. Army, Charleston, S. C.

SIR: On the 17h instant 475 Union men of East Tennessee were captured en route for Kentucky and sent by Major-General Smith's order on the 20th instant to Milledgeville, Ga. Some of them expressed a wish before leaving to enlist in the C. S. Army. They were not permitted to do so because of the apprehension that they might [not] be faithful here to their oaths of allegiance; elsewhere they may make good soldiers. Remembering your request the major-general commanding directs me to say that you have whatever authority he can give you to proceed to Milledgeville, Ga., and enlist as may of them as consent for service in South Carolina or elsewhere except in East Tennessee.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. L. CLAY,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

M. T. HAYNES, Esq.

SIR: Mrs. Maynard applies for passports for two servants understood to be slaves. I am directed to ask your decision as to whether they are her property or not.

Respectfully,

W. M. CHURCHWELL.
