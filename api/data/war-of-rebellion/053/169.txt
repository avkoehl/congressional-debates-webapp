day evening in pursuit of rebels. From best information I can get, rebel force is small. If Major Martin and Captain Beck can overtake them, they ought to whip and capture them.

W. F. GORIN,

Glasgow:

I have had but few troops assigned to me since I was placed in command of this part of the State. Those at Glasgow were not reported to me. I have ordered all the force I can spare to Glasgow; they will be there to-night. Colonel Spaulding is on his way to your place. I requested General Boyle on yesterday to order him, via Columbia, to Glasgow. He replied that my wishes had been complied with.
