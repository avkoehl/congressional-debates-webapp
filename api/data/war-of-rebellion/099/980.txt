(Received 12 o'clock.)

General COOPER:

The men of Wheeler's cavalry corps have not been paid, many of them for more than twelve months. I request that you will authorize Mr. Sneed, C. S. depositary, now in Charleston, to turn over $3,000,000 for this purpose.

W. J. HARDEE,

Lieutenant-General.

CHARLESTON, January 2, 1865.

General S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General:

A telegram from the President of the 30th of December* to General Beauregard directs him to proceed to the district west of Augusta and to leave me in command of the district east of Augusta, but is not definite as to whether Augusta will be in his district or mine. I have no desire to enlarge my department, but the connection between Augusta, Branchville, and Charleston is, in a military point of view, so intimate that I consider it necessary that they should be in the same department.

W. J. HARDEE,

Lieutenant-General.

[Indorsement.]
