Mr BENTON proposed to strike out from the
bill that part which provides tnat no o her Bank
shall be established during the continuance of the
present Bank
Mr B said this provision, embracirg die odi >us
principle of monopoly, wa> copied from an act of
ClaeenAnne of England, but had gone entirely
out of fash on even m that country of King ,
Lord , and Commons Mr B here read an ex-
tract from a letter of Lom L verpool, m reply to
an application of the governor ind dir>cior- of the
Bank of England for a monopo'y of banking
privileges, in which the nobleman -aid that exclu
sire privileges had gone out of fashion, and Par-
liament subsequently refused to grant them in the
Bank charter.
The amendment was rejected—ayes 19, noes 25,
as follows:
YEAS—Messrs Allen, Benton, Buchanan, Cal-
houn, Clay of Alabama, Pulton, King, Lmn,
McRoberts, Mouton, Nicholson, Pierce, Sevier,

Mr BENTON then moved to amend tli3 bill to
the effect that, it any committee of Congrc-s should
be refnsed means ot inspecting the books and pro-
Cfedmgs of the said corporation, it should b; con-
sidered caust  of forfeiture of the charter.
Mr B «said as the bill at present stood, w^en a
committee of Congress upon investigation reported
the charier violated, a scire facias was directed to
be issued, he proposed that it the committee were
repulsed and the opportunity for investigaron de
med, that it must be made eqmva'ent to a tut ition
of charter
Mr. BERRIED thought 'he amen<'m nt ui r>r-ce<¡
sary, asa refusal to permit the committee to nvesti-
gate would be a violation of the chittci     He
quoted some provis onsof the charter in confirma
tion of these view ,
Mr. BENTON sud every word of fns was in the
charter of the late Bank, which chafed our com-
mittee out of Philadelphia. Besides, the provision
has no penalty attached to it Congress had been
«united in ihe per«ons of its commit ee by the late
Bank, and it was still unavenged He wishe 1 th? t
the provision might be inserted by Congre s to
mark its reprobation of the flagrant conduct of the
late Bank.
Mr CLAY of Alabama remarked, <n addition,
the Bank might be guilty of ¡amy transactions
which would incur a forfeiture, and would sooner
incur 'he responsibility of a re<\ml to permit the
committee to examine its affairs, than ri«k the dis
closures.
w Mr. BENTON moved an amendment, to «trike
out the clause au horizmg the Bank taking 6 per
cent, interest on loans &c and fix  g the rate of
interest at 5 per cent
Mr B said when the former chai ter ivas grant-
ed, it was a question whether the equivalent for ihe
priveleges conferred hould be a bonu  to t^e Go-
vernment, or a reducid rate of interest on its loan«
He had no doubt thit this charter, if put in ihe
ma'H would bring «everal millions of dollars,
and though he considered toe pr nciple of -¡filing
privileges as dete^tab'e, as an odious ulic of ihe
times of the Tadors and the Stuarts he thought
the community should derive some advantage as
CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
an equivalent for the great privileges conferred.
There was a well authenticated case on record, m
the time of the Stuarts, when a monopoly was sold
to an indwidua', and it was clearly shown for
every one pound 1 e paid to the sovereign, one
hundred and twenty-seven were extorted from the
community. This Bank had greater privileges
conferred on it than any corporation since the
dayi. of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. These pri-
vate corporators are to be associated with the
Government, their coffers are declared to be
the Treasury of the Union, thsir noteo are to
be the currency of the wnole country If th's
bi'l was passed, the time wou d come, and
to'erably old men would live to see it, when no
law could pass Cingress but what an attorney of
the Bank would draw up It would become what
General Hamilton said, whea he proposed a splen-
did Government, strong enough to take care of
itself, and this Bank would take care of melf For
all these privileges, he proposed to reduce the rate
of mtore«t to five per cent For the loan where
with we will rais~ the means to purchase this
stock, we will pay five per cent intere t, and he
considered it unbecoming a great nation to play
ihe usurer for the «ake of one per cent.
Mr HUNTINGTON thought six per cent not
unreasonable The amount of the privileges con
ferred on the stockholders of this Bank was that
they m ght divide seven per cent on their invest-
ment In return for^this they per orm various and
important services to the Government Mr H
here enumerated the services which the Bank was
obliged to perform.
Mr. BENTON said the old Bank had performed
all these services, and yet she paid a bonus of
one and a half million of dollars In the char-
ter proposed in 1832, the same services were in-
serted, and there was also a large bonus, two and
a quar'er millions he believed Mr Bibb pro-
posad to stnkp out th s bonus, and leduee the rate
of in erest to 5 per cent Mr Bent n here read
the vote on this motion from the journal Among
those who voted in favor of it weie Mr Mangum
and Mr Tyler
Mr MANGUM said he had voted formerly
for this proposition, because he thought it more fa-
vorable to the stockholders  than the bonus but
now there is no bonus exacted, and the Govern-
ment has a much larger portion of the s'ock
Mr BENTON said the prec se amount of the
bonus pro*«ed in 1831, (oi the charter for fifteen
years was three mlhons of dollars, apd this, in
the «ame proportion, buog f r twenty jear-,
should biinsr four null on<- He de pised the bo-
nus, and wa-- utterly opposed to sellm* puvileg'-s,
but ne aske 1 thit some equivalent should be made
to ihe community for the enormous privileges coi
ferred on this corporation
The question was then taken on the amend-
ment, and it was rejected—ayes 17, noes 26, as
follows

Mr CALHOUN rose for the purpose of moving
an adjournment He did t¡ is not from any wish
to e'elay, but "he Senate had been m se sion nearly
six hour^ during a sultry and oppressive day, and
he thought a proper regard to health requited an
adjournment
Mr CLAY of Kentm ky said he would make a
single suggestion Hs d d not know wb~ther the
gentlemen had got throngn their . mendmenls but
if lhey had, to morrow they wished to go in'o Ex-
ecutive business t"nd he would propo e V-a. the
bill be taken out of Committee of the Whole, and
be printed with the amendments that they might
take it up in the Stnate
Mr. CALHOUN said theie were jet a few
amendments to offer, none of which, however,
would probably consume much time, and gentle-
men on this side were willing that the bill should be
taken out of committee on Saturday, at farthest.
Mr WALKERsaidhe had submitted an amend-
ment, which he considered of the greatest impor-
tance, and which he should press to the extent of
his ability—and that was the proposition to discon-
nect the Executive with the banks and the money
of this Government, by giving the election of the
directors of this institution to the two Hou es of
Congress
The Senate then, at 4 o'clock, adjourned.
