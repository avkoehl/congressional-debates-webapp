HARRISBURG, September 13, 1861.

Honorable THOMAS A. SCOTT,

Assistant Secretary of War:

We can organize and send forward three or four regiments. We have no arms, and I fear it will be hard to get them off without. Can you send arms? I can't say how many of the independent regiments. Will try and get knowledge in the morning. We have 7,000 men in Camp Curtin.
