HEADQUARTERS,Near Sibley's, March 26, 1865-12.30 p. m.

General MAURY:

Your dispatch received whilst engaged placing troops in position at this place. The enemy is at Cyrus Sibley's Mills, and halted just now. He made too wide a circuit for me to concentrate the command on him. General Gibson was at D'Olive's Creek, and another column was reported moving in that direction. I have not heard from General Gibson since reaching this point. C. Sibley's Mills is four miles distant.
