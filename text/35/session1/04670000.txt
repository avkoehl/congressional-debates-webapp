THE OFFICIAL PROCEEDINGS OF CONGRESS, PUBLISHED BY JOHN C. RIVES, WASHINGTON, D. C.
Thirty-Fifth Congress, 1st Session.
TUESDAY, .TUNE 1, 1858.
New Series....No. 158.
HALL AND COZZENS, AND NAYLOR AND CO.
Mr. GOODWIN, from the same committe, re-
ported a bill for the relief of Hall & Cozzens, and
Naylor & Co., which was read a first and second
time.
Mr. GOODWIN. I ask the consent of the
House to put this billon its passage. These men
entered into a contract with the proper ofiiceis of
the Government for furnishing the Government
with iron roofing and cornices for the United States
Government buildings at the capital of the Terri-
tory of Nebraska. They have fulfilled their con-
tract, as appears from a communication which we
have received from the Treasury Department,
which is embodied in the report. They have been
paid a portion of the amount of their contract, but
before it was finished the appropriation was ex-
hausted. This bill simply authorizes the Treas-
ury Department to pay what shall be found due
them. I hope there will be no objection.
Mr. KELSEY. I object to putting this bill
upon its passage,and will object to any bj 11 being
put on its passage in this way, for the reason that
it is doing great injustice to the cases which have
been heretofore reported and placed upon the Pri-
vate Calendar, where a single objection will pre-
vent them from being reported. I want these
bills all to take tho same course, and take their j
chances together. :
Mr. GOODWIN. I appeal to my colleague to
withdraw his objection. These men have per-
formed their contract, and have been without
their pay ever sinee 1855.
Mr. KELSEY. I cannot withdraw my objec-
tion.
The bill was then referred to a Committee of
the Whole House, and, With the report, ordered
to be printed.
HENRY SMALLY.
Mr. JOHN COCHRANE, from the Commit-
tee on Commerce, made an adverse report upon
the memorial of Henry Smally; which was laid
on the table, and the report ordered to be printed.
SIMON DE VISSER.
Mr. EUSTIS, from the same committee, re-
ported back Senate bill (No. 103) for the relief of
Simon De Visser and Joseph Villarubia, of New
Orleans; which was referred to a Committee of
*he Whole House, and oideied to be printed.
SETTLERS ON PUBLIC LANDS IN ILLINOIS.
Mr. DAVIS, of Indiana. I am directed by the
Committee on Public Lands to report back
House bill (No. 533) for the relief of settlers on
certain lands m the State of Illinois. I ask the
unanimous consent of the House that the bill be
put on us passage.
The bill was read in exleiuo.
Mr. DAVIS, of Indiana. This bill lias been ,
unanimously reported from the Committee on ;
Public Lands. A similar bill was passed a few 1
days ago, for like settlers in Wisconsin. It is :
recommended by the Commissioner of the Gen-
eral Land Office. It is necessary that it should
pass.
Mr. BRANCH. I make the point of order
that this is not a private, but a public bill.
The SPEAKER. The Chair thinks that it is
not a private bill.
Mr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois. I hope that
all objection will be withdrawn, and that the bill
will be passed.
Mr. HOPKINS. I object; and I shall object
to putting any bill on its passage until all the
committers have been called. My objection is not
diiected specially against this bill. Some com-
mittees have not been called for months.
Mr. DAVIS, of Indiana. The bill passed for
sealers in Wisconsin, a few days ago, was de-
cided to lie a pnvate bill.
The SPEAKER. That bill set out that it was
for the rehef of Simon Drew and others.
Mr. DAVIS, of Indiana. I can make the title
of this bill read in the same way.
The SPEAKER, if that bill had been read
through, instead of gomir to a Committee of the
158
Whole House, the Chair would have referred it to
the Committee of' the Whole on the state of the
Union.
Mr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois. I hope that
this bill will be allowed to go to a Committee of
the Whole House, and take its chance with the
other bills. It is a meritorious case.
Mr. BRANCH. I insist on my point of order.
The SPEAKER. The Chai rcannot receive it
as a private bill.
JOHN L. ALLEN AND ASA R. CARTER,
Mr. COBB, from the Committee on Public
Lands, moved that the committee be discharged
from the further consideration of Senate bill (No.
162) for the relief of John L. Allen and Asa R.
Carter, and that the same be referred to the Com-
mittee of Claims.
It was so ordered.
Mr. COBB. I have a small Senate bill here,
for a poor man, which I am directed to report
from the Committee on Public Lands. I will ask
that it be put upon its passage. -
Mr. BARKSDALE, I object.
