HEADQUARTERS FOURTEENTH ARMY CORPS,Nashville, December 8, 1862

Major-General THOMAS:

General commanding desires you give orders to all post commanders to throw up small intrenchments, and picket all roads leading out from their positions with cavalry. Disaster at Hartsville seems attributable to neglect of these precautions.

By command:

J. P. GARESCHE,

Assistant Adjutant-General and Chief of Staff.

NASHVILLE, December 8, 1862.

Major General GEORGE H. THOMAS,

Commanding Center, Army of the Cumberland:

Any more news of Hartsville affair or of the enemy? Could one of Dumont's brigades come down immediately? How soon will you be ready to move whole force?

By command of General Rosecrans:

J. P. GARESCHE,

Assistant Adjutant-General and Chief of Staff.

GALLATIN, December 8, 1862

Colonel GARESCHE,

Assistant, Adjutant-General and Chief of Staff:

Colonel Harlan reported that the enemy recrossed the river on the arrival of his troops. Scouts report none of their infantry or cavalry on this side of the river. I can send one brigade (Ward's) of General Dumont to-morrow, if you desire, and my whole command whenever your order it or think proper to relieve it from guarding the railroad and fords on the Cumberland River. There are no troops, however, to take their place on the road or to guard the fords.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS FOURTEENTH ARMY CORPS,Nashville, December 8, 1862

Major-General THOMAS:

Have you heard anything of Hall's brigade? If it has come in safely, make the best disposition of that and Dumont's command to protect railroad from Mitchellsville to Nashville, and then come down yourself with Fry's command. Don't count on Granger. His whole force is needed at Mitchellsville. Tell what you know about Hall. Stokes' Tennessee and Fifth Kentucky Cavalry start to-morrow. Leave orders where they are to be posted.

By command of Major-General Rosecrans:

J. P. GARESCHE,

Assistant Adjutant-General and Chief of Staff.
