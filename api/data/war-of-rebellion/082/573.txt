Lieutenant-Colonel COMSTOCK,

City Point:

I am sorry that General Hancock made such a report. I will have that road accurately surveyed and, if possible, every stump shown. I doubt if there are ten on the whole six miles of road. They are so few that until I received your dispatch I was under the impression that these roads were most excellent.

I would ask you to send an officer over the road to report. I will have it carefully cleaned up if anything is found.

G. WEITZEL,

Brigadier-General.

They reported two places that needed repair. Immediately upon this Lieutenant Michie repaired these two places on the day before the movement commenced.
