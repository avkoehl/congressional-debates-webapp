(Received 3.30 p.m.)

The PRESIDENT,

Washington, D. C.:

After hearing from General Garfield I shall write you. But detailed information of high national importance, of a plot to over-throw the Government, which you should know, cannot be instructed to the mails. To convey the facts to you and avoid such an outrage on my messenger as was perpetrated on Major Bond, I respectfully request an order from you to forward the documents by a staff officer.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS SAINT LOUIS DISTRICT,Saint Louis, Mo., June 2, 1864.

COMMANDING OFFICER,

Pilot Knob:

Order Companies B and F, Third Missouri State Militia, from Patterson to Pilot Knob, with camp equipage. Let them march without delay. Send Company D, same regiment, from Pilot Knob to Patterson, and also all of the company at Fredericktown, except 1 commissioned officer and 15 or 20 men. Let the field and staff of the Third Regiment report to Major Wilson, except Major Bartlett, who will remain at Pilot Knob at present.

THOMAS EWING, JR.,

Brigadier-General.

CAPE GIRARDEAU, June 2, 1864.

General EWING:

Hiller, at Bloomfield, has information that the enemy are gathering quite a force at Cane Island, about 100 miles southeast of Bloomfield and across the Saint Francis. The river is not fordable, or we would cross and attack, but we think they will bridge it. We have scouts watching every move, and hope they will cross, when we will seize the bridge and debate with them. They are Kitchen's men and say [they] mean to join McRae. We shall know soon. Let me urge again that Hiller be relieved from court-martial, as he knows everybody there and can get information when a stranger could not.

J. B. ROGERS,

Colonel.

WARRENSBOROUGH, MO., June 2, 1864.

Major-General ROSECRANS,

Commanding Department of the Missouri:

The current of guerrillas appears to be running north and east.

E. B. BROWN,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers.
