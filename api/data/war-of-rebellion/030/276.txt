HEADQUARTERS SECOND DIVISION,LEFT WING, FOURTEENTH ARMY CORPS,

In the Field, December 30, 1862.

Colonel HAZEN,

Commanding Second Brigade:

The order of battle and of march to-day, as suggested by General Rosecrans, is that there shall be intervals between the first and second lines of advance brigade of about 300 yards. General Cruft and Colonel Grose, will immediately examine the ground, to see if such positions can be found for their rear lines as will afford that interval, and, if possible, will withdraw them. This is only important in case of a battle himself ready to move in any direction, and will gradually gain the interval between the leading brigades, holding himself in proper supporting distance. Second line will not be advanced until absolutely needed, and will then be used to relieve or support exhausted men. Fight by brigades.

By order of Brigadier-General Palmer:

D. W. NORTON,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.

Firing heard in the direction of Jefferson. Have sent to ask Rousseau if brigade there has been withdrawn,and to order it back if it has left, unless there is a strong regiment left there. Write a note to Walker, which I will send by courier, to come up as soon as possible.

It seems there is some delay in the movements of McCook. Until the fight is south, Negley ought not to separate from him.
