Ü5th Cong--"2nd Sesi
Mi . Calhoun's Resolutions—Mr. Pierce.
Jan. 1838.
Senate.
nient throughout the country in favoi of then
emancipation. We mean at present (Mr S said)
to declare that we recognise the constitutional
rights of the slave States in their slave propertj —
that we do not mean to infringe thoie rights He
believed that the true interests of the slave States
would be best prometed by liberating their slave',
but that (Mr S. said) was a question of then own,
and for them only to decide. But he rose (Mr S
vud) to express his views as ¡o tne difference be-
tween the resolutions which had been passed ind
the one at present before them Those that were
passed were only declaratory ot constitutional
rights, which he thought they n ere bound to recog-
nise, and on theue grounds he gav e his bupport to
them. But what (Mr S asked) was this fifth re-
solution? Was it not wholly different from the
others'! This was a field m which the people of
these United States hadarighttotntei and to discuss
—the expediencyof slaverym this Distuct. Ii (said
Mr. S.) we are called on here to act as legislators,
he for one would be ready to say that it would not
be expedient to legislate on the sublet, because it
would be unjust to the holders of slave piopeity,
but he would be unwilling to say that it was uncon-
stitutional to abolish slavery m this District
When they came to talk of prescribing limits to
the discussions of the people oi the United States,
they were not acUng within the limits of their duty
If, said Mr. S we do not act m conlonmty to the
will of the people of the Uuittd States, they can
exercise a proper check or control over us What
was this fifth resol ution but the prescribing a rule
to Umit the discussions of the people of the United
State  hereafter, and the sating themselves up as
ceiwors over them? This Mr S thought was
going far beyond the limits oí their dutv While
he would cheerfully oppose any unconstitutional
interfeieiice with the institutions of the States, he
would at the same time avoid expiessing anv opi-
nions adverse to the right of the people to discuss
such subjects as were properly open to them He
opposed this resolution, not because he did not go
heart and hand with the gentlemen ot the South in
the maintenance of the t constitutional lights, but
because he believed that its adoption, so tai iiom
answering any good end to the pioplc oi tin slave
States, would have an injurious effect on their in-
terests.
Mr PIERCE of New IUmpsiui list vud said
the Senate had at come it length to the srouni1 on
which thi  contest was to be deteimined ihe
District of Columbia was now emphatically the
battle-field of the Abolitionist, and the resolution
immediately under consideration, with, perhaps,
some modifications in phraseology, would present
the true issue here and to the country—an issue
which would raise, not a mere question of expedi-
ency, but one of a much higher chaiactrr, in which
the public faith is directly involved.
That my position, said Mr P maybe distinctly
understood, some explanation is perhaps due to
the State which I have the honor, in pan, to repie
sent, especially as there is a manifest disposition,
m certain quarter"!, to perveit our votes and imsre
present our motives
I have given to the resolutions all the considera-
tion which I am capable of bestowing, and have
listened to the debate which they have elicited with
interest and profound attention
If the grave objections suggested on the othei
side were sustained by an examination of the reso-
lutions themselves, or a course of sound argumen-
tation, they would ensure my opposition What
are they' The first that reached my ear was, that
they contain latent nullification I have waited to
hear the particular resolution, sentence or phrase
pointed out in which this, heresv is supposed to be
concealed, and I have waited in vain Having,
then, assertion on one side, and what appears to
me to be the plain reading of the resolutions and
the frank and unqualified declaiation of the mover
on the other, I must be excused if I do not take the
alarm.
We have next eloquent disquisitions upon the li-
berty of ^pe«ch and the freedom ot the press To
every sentiment uttered upon these subjects I yield
my cordial assent, but why introduced on this par-
'iculsr occasion, I have been at a loss to determine
Would any man here abridge thejliberty of speech,
or assail the freedom of the press? I take it not
Is there any thing in the resolutions to sanction an
invasion of either? Not a syllable. That these
are pnvileges most dear to every American is
freely admitted by all. Why such a variety of
changes have been rung upon them in this debate,
others may determine It is not my piovmce to
judge of motives, and I would take occasion only
to remark, that no man shall make up an issue
upon this subject for me I oppose the Abolitionists,
for the veiy íeason that I entertain a sacred regard
loi thes  in common with all othei rights secured
by the Constitution
But it is further urged against the resolutions,
(said Mr P ) that they aie mere abstractions    Sir,
it is quite imtmtenal  what name vou apply  ^o
them, sufficient is it that they meet the case, that
they encounter the Abolitionist upon sound and te
nable ground, and  furnish a conclusive answer to
his importunities    To say that the petitions refei
only to this District, and that ihe principles assert-
ed  in the preceding resolutions are consequently
without application, is perfectly idle     It is impos-
sible to read a single number of the leading aboli-
tion penodicals, without peiceiving that  their ob-
ject reaches fat bejond this Distuct, and stops at
no  point short of general emancipation  in the
States     And yet, sir, I suspect that you would find
few intelligent Abolitionists, who wosld assert that
Congies^ has the constitutional power to interfere
with slavery m the States, but admitting the want
of power here, they hold it to be their duty, as indivi-
duals, loperseveieinthecause   Regarding the insti-
tution ot slavery as morally wrong,  or sinful, if
\ ou please, they consider themseh es, as citizens of
the Union, responsible foi  its continuance,  wher-
ever it may exist within our borders     This feeling
has its origin, to some extent, in a misappiehension
ot the stiixeture of oui Government, and this eiror
the preceding resolutions aie calculated to  coirect
They  assert,  in effect,   that the citizen  of New
Hampshire is no mole responsible, morally or po-
luicilly, for the existence and continuance of this
domes ic institution in Virginia or Maryland, than
he would be lor the existence ot any similar insti-
tutions m France or Persia    Why? Because these
arematteis over which the States,  respectivrlj,
when dt legating a portion of their  poweis,  to  be
exeieised b/ the General Government, retained the
sole and exclusive control,^nd for which they are
alone responsible
¡Now, let tnese doctrines be universally under-
stood and admitted, and you take one great step
toward satisfying the consciences of honest, but
misguided people, in one section of the country,
and quieting the irrigation, for which there has been
too much ciuse, in the other This we have at-
tempted to do We are bound to go further, and
frankly to declaic to these petitioners, that so long
slavery shall continue in Virginia and Maryland, it
is vain for them to expect its abolition here, that
vie are forbidden to legislate upon this subject, un-
cid existing crcumst mees, by obligations hardly
intenoi to the Constitution itself, that Congress
cannot abolish slavery in this District, against ihe
wishes of the inhabitants, without a gross breach o'
public faith, and an outrageous infraction of pri-
vate rights
At the time the cession was made, dome tic
"lavery existed in the States of Maryhnd and Vir
gmia it st 11 exists there, and it has a'so existed
here from lha' day to this Now, how is it possi-
ble to nis'ake what must have been the under-
standing of both parties at the time2 No man, it
strikes me, can doubt for a moment, who will re-
gard, without prejudice, the relative position of this
" ten miles squaie," the objects of the cession, and
the manifest interests of the States making it Who
can believe that these patriotic States would hive
parted w ith their territory, if they could have sup-
posed that the rights and property of their citizens,
living upon it, weie to be invaded, against their
consent, and in defiance of their remonstianees? I
ha /e no hesitation in saving that I consider slavery
a social and poh'u al evil, and most sincerely wish
that it had no existence upon the face of the earth,
but it is perfectly immaterial how it may be regard-
ed, either by you or myself, it is not for us to sit in
judgment, and determine whether the rights secured
to the different States by the Constitution are
blessings or otherwise; it is sufficient for the argu-
ment that they are rights, which the inhabitants do
not choose to relinquish.
Further, Mr. President, suppose, for a moment,
that the cession had never been made, and that the
States of Maryland and Virginia should now at-
tempt, without the consent of the inhabitants of the
District, to interfere with this description of pro-
perty—to abolish slavery within these portions of
their respective limit , and retain it upon its present
basis in every other portion.   What would be the
consequence1   Why, the law could never be en-
forced , and every reflsctmg man throughout the
whole length and breadth of this country would re-
volt at such a wanton disregard of equal justice
and of equal rights and privileges    And yet, be-
cause the States have generously ceded their terri-
tory to you for certain puiposes, you propose to do
this very thing, and thus, requite their confidence
and their spmt of accommodation, by opening a
common refuge foi  their runaway slaves     I will
only add, upon  this  point, that the  Abolitionist
would do well  to pause  in  the midst of his real,
and inquire calmly and dispassionately whether, in
fact, any thing more than a nominal advantage
would be gained by the abolition of slavery m this
District, and whether even this would not be ac-
quired at a senous sacrifice    It is admitted that
domestic slavery exists here 11 its mildest for*n.
That part of the population aie bound together by
friendship and the nearer relations of life.   They
are attached to the families in which they have
lived from childhood    They are comfortably pro-
vided for, and appaiently contented    Now, let a
bill for the abolition of slavery m the District pass
either  House of Congress, and what would take
place here?    Why, before it could possibly become
a law, all these tics would be violently sundered ,
every slave in the District would be removed be-
jond its limits, their present comparatively easy
condition changed, it is probable, for one of greater
rigor, and, with all this accomplished, you"would
not hive made the slightest progress m diminishing
the  aggregate  amount of  s'aveiy in the United
States
Mr President, yielding to my inclination, I
would here take leave of this irritating subject, now
and forever, but the manner m which it appears
to be connecting itself with other topics renders it
proper, m my judgment, to add a few remarks.
When, it i  often asked, is this agitation, m Con-
gress and out of it, to ceased When is it to ter-
minate, and with what results' These are ques-
tions which, three years since, would not have cost
me one moment's uneasiness I thought the ap-
prehensions of Southern gentlemen, to a great ex-
tent, had their ongin m a morbid sensibility upon
this subject Still, mindful of their interests and
peculiar relations, I appreciated their feelings, and
dec ply regretted the cause of irritation And now
these questions would create little interest, cer-
tainly excite no alarm, in my miad, it agitators
upon the subject were only to be found in the circle
of avowed Abolitionists With regard to the State
which I have the honor, in part, to represent, I am
perfectly satisfied, as- well from my own observa-
tion as from the expression of the Legislature dur-
ing the last winter, that public sentiment can
hardly be said to be divided upon fh s subject
But h«>re, sit, I feel bound to admit that there are
indications m New England which cannot and
ought not to be overlooked Tne aspect of things
m this respect has undergone some change, and I
fear the elements of still greater change are in ac-
tive operation I do not mean to say that the
Abolitionists proper are gaming strength rapidly ,
but what I do mean to say is, that they are Imdmg
allies m the cause of agitation in the political
press Sir, if polit cs are to be mingled with this
subject, let it be known, it cannot be proclaimed
too soon I have been taught that the way to
overcome d fficulties and threatening dangers is to
meet them on the advance, not to await their ap-
proach , and, although I would create no undeces-
saiy alarm, I assure the mover of these resolutions
that he shall not find me standing tamely by, or '
attempting to lull others into false security by the
