I have n.n time to specify others, but they are
to be fount! in the documents accompanying the
(juartenrMster's report. Now, I ask, has the
quartermaster any control over these rentings?
Bv reference to regulations 965 and 968, the com-
mittee v.'iH see that he has no power to refuse these
things, when they are demanded hy the the officer
in command. I will read the regulations:
  96fl When an oifiet'r arrives at a post, if he be entitled
to quartern ami iiwl, lie *!ial! make a written requisition for
limn on ire t'll'.oei of the qiiarteimaster's department sta-
tioned then', a'-, uiiipamcd by a copy of tin; order placing
In lis On dut> !i lie be aceomiiinicd by troops, bis requisl-
uon must t'liiiiraee in- wiiole eoiiimand, and designate the
number ul oirioer.- ol each class oi grade, as well as nuii-
<32
commissioned officers, musicians, artificer?, private soldiers,
servants, and authorized washerwomen."
"968. When officers and troop-? a>e assigned to duty at ;
stations where theiu are no public buildings winch they can
occupy, the officers of the quartPnaasterJedep<irtmeut shalL
hire quarters ior thern. not exceeding the "natnuer of rooms
to wiueh the officers are entitled, and the space to which the
troops are entitled.,s
Here is the manner, then, in which the qv.ar- ■
ters shall be demanded, and the maimer in winch
j| they shall be provided. Regulation 082, to whidi !
!j my attention lias been called, but in reference to ,
| which I have a note only, saya that an officer is ,
i entitled to quarters, aijd a temporary absence on
j duty shall not deprive him of them. So that we
I see, for the item of renting, which appears to me !
j to be enormous, the quartermaster general lias no 1
, responsibility at all. He is required by the laws
| and the regulations which control the army; and
; to which 1 have just referred, to supply quarters '
i by renting, if there be no public quarters at the '
], post. It has been frequently asked me within the
'j last few days, " Why don't General Jesup make ;
;t the soldiers cut their own wood5" That seems to ,
iime to be a very pertinent and sensible question.
[\ It is, however, easily answered, by saying he has i
■ : no power to make the order, as will be seen by '
!\ reference to regulation 981, which says: ;
! \ "• 981. At all posts m the vicinity of public oi Indian latid<- ;
i; winch afford fire-wood, the necessary luel will be provided |
, b\ faugue partius detailed troni the troops!, under the direc- ;
i j tion oi the several commanding otficcis ; but should fuel be .
provided by the labor of soldiers on extra duty, u s-hall be ■
taken up, on the returns of the othceis oi the quartunnas- i
ter's department of the respective posts, and accounted toi,
as public property, according to the regulations. *' j
Now, under these circumstances what has Gen- j
eral Jesup to do? These regulations say what j
each of the officers shall be entitled to, and what i
each man shall have in the way of fuel—so much |
in summer, and so much in winter, so much in )
one degree of latitude, and so much in another—all '
specifically set forth. But if the quartermaster 1
general should think proper to say: <;I cannot j
give you fuel here; here are public lands around \
you, go and cut your wood, what would be the ;
result? He would be disobeyed, because he has ;
no right to give the order. The commanding offi- ,
cer has a right to give that order, and it should j
have been given long since. If General Scott
should issue his order, or the Secretary of War !
should issue his order, requiring it, then the com-
manding officer will have it done. Our troops at '
those ports, for at least a portion of the time, are ;
doing little or no duty that would prevent them i
from cuttingtheir own wood, and saving their own ;
hay, yet other persons are lured to do this work, s
making the wood cost from three to ten dollars a
cord. I regard that as an abuse; but the quarter- j
master general has no power to change it. The j
j| Commander-in-Chief can Change it, and is in my i
}j view*remiss in the discharge of his duty for not ;
'| having done it long since. These remarks as to
:j4fuel, apply precisely with the same force to hay.
•i Why is it, 1 ask, that we are paying $30, ond $40,
■ and $50 a ton for hay, when there is the very
j grass growing all around our posts out of which
! that hay is made: I will leave others to answer
! that question.
| Mr. MARSHALL, of Kentucky. I wish to
| ask a question.
1 Mr. HOUSTON. 1 cannot yield, as my time
> will not allow me to do so.
'! Mr. MARSHALL. The question is merely i
,J this: Whether it does not appear from the docu-
ments reported by the Secretary of War, in New
Mexico especially, that the otHcer in command .
1 there has not issued an order requiring the soldiers
; to cut their own hay, whenever the price at which
i it can be purchased exceeds §10 per ton :
j Mr. HOUSTON. I intended to come to that,^
i and state that I had learned of the existence ot
! such an order. These abuses appear to have oc-
ij curred in 1851. We have not received the sfate-
•! ments in detail since that ume: and, as I stated in
the outset of my remarks, efforts are being made
') to correct many of tbem. I stated that most dis-
,! tiuctly, but I believe the honorable membei from
Kentucky was not then in his seat.
I desire to have the attention of the committee a
moment to another point." It is said here by mem-
bers, and believed very sincerely, that General
Jesup ought to change the forage that is furnished
to the animals we have there in the service. If the -
commanding officer makes a requisition upon the
quartermaster's department for forage, specifying
what that forage shall be—either grain, fodder,
or what not—the quartermaster's department is
bound by that requisition, and has no discretion
to change it. If he calls forgrain, the quartermas-
ter has no right to supply the demand with long
fodder. The regulations allow to a mule eight
quarts of corn for each du\, and if the command-
ing officer requires it, the quartermaster general
has no right to say, that but four or six quarts shall
be given; and the idea that the quartermaster is
responsible for these things is a delusion. It is
erroneous in all of its length and breadth. But
my friend from New York, [Mr. Brooks,] on Sat-
urday last, argued to show (and I was astonished •
at it; (hat Congress was responsible for .these
expenditure©. Now, has it come to this?—has it
come to this, I ask, that an Administration, with
the power of making an estimate—with the power
and duty of making honest and economical ex-
penditures—shall attempt to sinrk and evade the
responsibility incident to such action? I flatter
myself that the gentleman from New York [Mr.
Brooks] has spoken without authority. I flatter
myseifthatthere is power—theExecutivebranches
of the Government are not so cowardly—I will
! not employ that language—are not so lost to all
• sense of magnanimity, as to induce them to en-
: deavor to escape the responsibility of their own
expenditures. That is a most unheard of propo-
sition—that Congress is responsible. Who makes
the estimates r The Executive Department makes
them. The President of the United States is re-
sponsible for those estimates, and Congress has
nothing to do with them until they are received here.
Weall agree about that. They are made alone upon
the responsibility of the Executive. But the gen-
tleman says that Congress, by voting for these esti-
mates, became their indorser, and thereby becomes*
responsible. Now, let us test that. Let us see
whether it is a sound, a correct principle. The
estimates are sent to us,and,as I contend, consti-
tute what a lawyer would call a prima facie ease
| for appropriation. 1 desire distinctly to be under-
I stooa upon this point. The estimates make a
: prima facie case for an appropriation. They come
! to us and are referred to our committee. It is the
! duty of that committee to investigate and examine
carefully into these estimates; to scrutinize, to cor-
rect, and to do everything to detect error and im-
propriety, and to expose and lop off, if thought
necessary. The committees then report to Con-
gress, and it becomes alike the duty/)f all the
members to investigate and probe the estimates to
the full extent that their facilities will enable them
to do; and if, after all this, we cannot give a °;ood
reason l'or reducing or refusing them, we should,
in my opinion, make the appropriation estimated
for. I state that as a principle that will ordinarily
govern my action in such cases. But, then, what
sort of responsibility does the gentleman from New
York attempt to give Congress; We are called
upon daily to repose confidence in the Executive
. Department of the Government. We are told by
: him and his friends that we must rely upon them
1 to some extent; that we should not cut down their
estimates without a reason: and then, if we agree to
take ihern vpnn trust," and give them the appro-
priation, the same gentlemen turn immediately
round and say, Congress, and not the Executive,
is responsible for the expenditure, when it does
neither expend nor direct the expending of a dol-
lar. This is strange reasoning.
Mr. Chairman, there never has been, and never
will be, a Congress of the United States that can
make the necessary and proper reforms in the
Government, either in the appropriations or any-
thing else, without the codpei-ation of the Execu-
tive Department. We may reduce this and that
item, but with rare exceptions, we will not be likely
to afit understandingly when the departments fad
