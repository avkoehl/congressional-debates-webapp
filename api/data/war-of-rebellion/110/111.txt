MEMPHIS, June 7, 1861.

SECRETARY OF WAR, C. S. A.:

You have 3,200 muskets from Baton Rouge on their way to Mount Vernon Arsenal. Will you allow me to put them into the hands of Tennessee troops? In a few days all Tennessee will be of you. There are now 28,000 troops, and daily the number increases, at Cairo. Have ordered forward three regiments of the Corinth forces. We have not the means of arming another man. Let me have these arms and you shall have the men and arms when you call. Answer at once.

GID. J. PILLOW.

MEMPHIS, TENN., June 11, 1861.

President DAVIS, or

SECRETARY OF WAR:

I was advised that I would be supported by forces at Corinth. Three regiments of those have gone to Richmond, and to arms them others had to give up their arms, and there are not now arms left for two regiments. You authorized me to retain 1,200 of the flint-lock muskets. Is it not possible for you to allow me to issue the whole of those arms? Our forces in the field are wholly too weak to arrest the column with which we know the enemy is preparing to assail us. The Army of Tennessee is now subject to your orders as a part of the Confederate forces. Can we retain those arms?

GID. J. PILLOW,

Major-General, Commanding Army of Tennessee.

NEW ORLEANS, June 16, 1861.

President DAVIS:

General Pillow sends for meants to prevent the enemy descending the river and taking Memphis, which he thinks they are about to attempt. The only thing to be done is to order the Confederate States war steamers here to ascend the river. This we recommend. Answer immediately.
