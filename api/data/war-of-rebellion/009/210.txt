eyes and face with sand and gravel. Lieutenant J. M. Pendleton, of General Foster's staff, also had a narrow escape from a ball which passed through the sleeve of hic coat. The wounded will be immediately removed to two comfortable hospitals in the city of New Berne. Surgeons Upham, Kneeland, Batchelder, and Clarke, from Massachusetts, joined us at Hatteras Inlet, and have been of great assistant both in the field and hospital.

HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT NORTH CAROLINA,New Berne, April 9, 1862.

GENERAL: I herewith submit a revised and correct list of the killed and wounded at the battle of New Berne, on the 14th of March, 1862, compiled from the reports of the various brigade and regimental surgeons. Although the casualties are only reduced to 88, I am happy to find that the number wounded is much smaller than was at first supposed.* A large number of the wounded as they improve have been sent home, and those remaining are comfortable cared for in the Craverstreet Hospital, under the charge of Brigade Surg. J. Bryan, and in the Academy Green Hospital, placed in charge of surg. George Derby, of the Twenty-third Massachusetts Regiment Volunteers. The wounds were unusually severe, and there have been several remarkable recoveries. The labor of the medical corps has been so great that I would once more respectfully urge upon you the absolute necessity for an increase of our surgical force, as, in addition to the sick of the transports they are obliged to attend the sick of the town and negroes. The latter are now so numerous that it is necessary to open a hospital for their reception.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WM. HENRY CHURCH,

Brigade Surgeon and Medical Director.
