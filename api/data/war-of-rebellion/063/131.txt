been hovering about Bayucas, Oyster Shell Reef, and Corpus Christi, you will be careful to guard against surprise and to provide for your safe return. You may also, if you should think it entirely safe, extend your reconnaissance to the south end of Saint Joseph's Island and ascertain whether the detachment, on Mustang Island might not be transferred to a position on this side of Aransas equally eligible for commanding (by artillery) that pass, and more eligible for a camp. Should you extend your reconnaissance so far, you will, if you find it convenient to do so, communicate with Major Thompson, commanding on Mustang Island. To meet this contingency I will send a copy of this dispatch by the steamer Saint Mary's, now here. You will not, however, consider yourself in any way constrained against your judgment by this suggestion.
