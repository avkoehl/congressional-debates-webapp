At McDowell nothing was captured except hard bread, which was issued to troops passing through-an extra ration. At Winchester, Martinsburg, and Harper's Ferry large amounts of supplies were carried off by division wagons, of which no report was made to me. Full rations were issued to 13,000 of the enemy for two days at Harper's Ferry. The issue was made before an inventory was taken.

Very respectfully,

W. J. HAWKS,

Major and Commissary of Subsistence, 2nd A. C., Army of N. Va.,

Lieutenant-General JACKSON,

Commanding Second Army Corps.
