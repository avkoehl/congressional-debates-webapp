HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,May 1, 1863.

Captain JAMES S. HALL:

SIR: Have you signal communication with General Sedgwick? If so, keep him advised of all you see.

Answer.

DANL. BUTTERFIELD,

Major-General, Chief of Staff.

MAY 1, 1863-12.05 p. m.

General BUTTERFIELD:

We have communication with General Sedgwick. The column reported this morning moving toward Chancellorsville was about two corps. The rear column passed a given point at 11.30 a. m. From appearances, a portion of the column diverged to the left before reaching the Orange Plank road. Firing is now distinctly heard in the direction of Chancellorsville; quite rapid.

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,May 1, 1863.

Captain HALL,

Signal Officer:

The general desires to know how long it is since you have seen a column of the enemy passing toward our right, and how many regiments; whether artillery and cavalry was with them. Also about how long it took them to pass.

PAUL A. OLIVER,

Lieutenant and Aide-de-Camp.

MAY 1, 1863-12.30 p. m.

[Lieutenant OLIVER:]

The column was first discovered 8.30 a. m., last seen 11.30 a. m. About two corps, accompanied by artillery. Firing going on in the direction of Chancellorsville. Dense black smoke seen in the direction of our supposed advance.

[HALL.]
HEADQUARTERS,May 1, 1863-12.30 p. m.

Major-General HOOKER,

Chancellorsville:

Patrick ordered from Banks' to United States Ford, and cavalry ordered there from Hartwood. Balloon and signal reports to this moment all sent you. The enemy will meet you between Chancellorsville and Hamilton's Crossing. He cannot, I judge, from all reports, have detached over 10,000 or 15,000 men from Sedgwick's front since sun cleared fog. Ingalls, just leaving, has your compass. I will have telegraph to Banks' ford shortly. Shall I keep party waiting there to cross, or build line from United States Ford to Chancellorsville?

DANL. BUTTERFIELD,

Major-General.
