This army is in the finest possible health and spirits.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

NEAR Vicksburg, MISS., May 25, 1863.

VIA MEMPHIS, TENN., May 29.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

There is evidence of a force collecting near Big Black River, north-east of here about 30 miles. I have ordered all the force that can be spared from WEST Tennessee, and communicated with General Banks, asking him to come with all the force he can. I can manage the force in Vicksburg and an attacking force on the rear of 30,000, but may have more to contend against. Vicksburg will have to be reduced by regular siege. My effective force here is about 50,000, and can be increased 10,000 more from my own command.

COLONEL: Eight men, with 200,000 percussion caps, were arrested whilst attempting to get through our lines into Vicksburg. The inclosed cipher was found upon them. Having no one with me who has the ingenuity to translate it, I send it to Washington, hoping that some one there may be able to make it out. Should the meaning of this cipher be made out, I request that a copy be sent to me.

Very respectfully,

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General.
