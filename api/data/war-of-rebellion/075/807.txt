them highly important. I send him back. Please communicate with me in writing so that I may know what is desired. It is of great importance that the position of my regiment on your left should be defined.

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS, June 30, 1864.

Major-General FRENCH,Commanding Division:

GENERAL: All right. Of course I will do all I can to co-operate with you, and would as soon protect your line as my own. If you should be attacked and I not, any assistance I can render in any way will be most cheerfully done.

Yours, respectfully,

W. H. T. WALKER,

Major-General.

Nothing new on my front.
HEADQUARTERS HARDEE'S CORPS,June 30, 1864-9.15.

Major-General WALKER:

GENERAL: General Hardee directs me to say that General Johnston considers the whole of Stevens' brigade, except the regiment in Gist's salient, as in reserve, and he desires, therefore, that the brigade, except this one regiment, shall be sent General French in case of the apprehended necessity. General Hardee adds that it should be sent with the utmost promptness in case of attack.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

T. B. ROY,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

[Indorsement.]
HEADQUARTERS WALKER'S DIVISION, June 30, 1864.

Respectfully referred to Brigadier-General Stevens, who, upon intimation from General French that his brigade is needed, will go at once to General French's assistance without awaiting further orders from these headquarters. With a view to this General Stevens will hold his brigade, except the regiment in Gist's salient, well in hand for the movement. General Walker suggests that the position now occupied by the brigade on the right of the division line is as good a starting-point as any other.

By command of Major-General Walker:

J. B. CUMMING,Major and Assistant Adjutant-General.
