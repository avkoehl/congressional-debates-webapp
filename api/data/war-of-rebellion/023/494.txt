Major-General HALLECK, General-in-Chief:

I understand that Generals Ketchum and A. J. Smith are in the department on special service. Cannot they be sent here for duty with the troops? If other generals are not available, I would suggest for appointment J. J. Reynolds, John Love, and Thomas A. Morris, all understood to be at Indianapolis. You know them, I believe. I have not a single brigadier with the force assembling here.
