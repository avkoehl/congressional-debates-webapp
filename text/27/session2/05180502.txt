CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
mi
iie bwldmgsat the territorial seat of government, showed how
unfounded were the pretensions of Governor Doty to the irre
ponsibiiity which he claimed The honorable gentlemen went
thoroughly into the whole subject, and a full report of his re-
marks will be given hereafter
Mr HOWARD then moved to amend the preamble, as he
had before suggested, by striking out all those passages which
charged the Governor of Wisconsin with being a defaulter
He was notfamiuar with the statutes,but he thought it would
I>e found, on a full investigation, that his accountability was to
the Treasury oí the United States. The passage which he
moved to strike out was in the following words
"And whereas the $40,000 so appropriated by Congress was
paid to lames D Doty as treasurer of aboard of commission
era appointed by the Legislature of the Territory to superintend
the erection of the said public buildings, who has denied all
authority oa the pait of theTerutory to require him (the said
JDoty) to account to the said Territory for the unexpended por
tion of the money so appropriated by Congress, and claims io
"be accountable only to theTreasuty of the United States, w th
"which he pretends to have settled for said menej, and to have
deposited a balance "
Mr WELLER saw no necessity foi any alteration The
statement of facts was m the possession of the House They
had tbf resolution with its lecitais of acts of Congress and they
had Governor Doty's letter to members of Congress, whiUi con
etituted the pieamble He did not know by what forced con
struction the preamole could be construed to make a charge
against Governor Doty, but if it should have done so, and if it
had chaiged hnn with being a defaulter, and guilty of rascality,
"which would duve him not only from the gubernatorial chair,
but from the Terutory of Wisconsm, he would still vote for it,
for he held there were circumstances which had been detailed
here—
Mr ARNOLD interposed, and called the gentleman Aom
Ohio to order He was for a fair fight between Governor Doty
arid Mr Medjix he had no objection to the adoption of the
resolution, but he disapproved of peisouat abuse of a man who
was not i ere to defend himself
Mr WELLER replied that he had always noticed, when a
man had not sense enough to comprehend an argument, he
raised a point of order    He was merely saying—
Mr ARNOLD insisted on his point of order.
The SPEAKER overruled it
Mr «LUNOLD appealed from the decision of the Chair
Mr WELLER had no wish to prolong this discussion, and
thereforejie would conclude, and move the previous question
Mr. ADAMS inquired if it was m order then to meve to strike
out the whole of the preamble1?
The SPEAKER replied m the negative.
Mr ADAMS asked if it would not be m order to call for a
division
The SPEAKER replied that it would not now be morderlas
the motion ior the previous question was pending
The House then sustained the motion fot the previous question,
and the vote was tht,n on the amendment of the gentleman from
Michigan, [Mr Howard,] to strike out the last recital of the
preamble
The vote was 60 in the affirmative, and 57 m the negative,
being less than a quorum
Mr 80WNE called for the yeas and nays, and, being or
dered, the amendment was adopted—yeas 77, nays 71
Mr ADAMS called for the yeas and nays on the adoption of
the preamble
The SPEAKER reminded the gentleman from Massachusetts
that the question must first be taken on the resolution
* Mr C\B OTHERS inquired whether the resolution could bo
amended, if it should be adopted, and the preamble should af
terwardsbe reacted
Mr ADAMS also made some remark, but, m the midst of it,
he wasieminded that the previous question had been ordered,
and debate was not therefore m order
Mi MEDILL remarked that the gentleman fromMassachu
setts were allowed to go mto a debate, he should expect permis
sion to reply
Mr ADAMS denied that he was making a speech, he said
he was only asking a question He then went on to say that the
House could determine as well as the Secretary of the Treasury
to whom Governor Doty was responsible It was a question of
law, andfthey were round to know the law
Mr BOwNE asked if this question was debatable, and whe
ther this debate was in order
The St EAKER replied in the negative
Mr ADAMS said, then, that he should be compelled toSvote
agamst it
After some othei observations,
Mr ADaMS moved to lay the resolution on the table
Mr BOvVKH called for the yeas and nays thereon, and they,
being ordered, resulted as follows Yeas26, noesl'iS
1 he resolution, and the preamble as amended, were then
adopted
Mi TR1PLETT asked leave to offer the following resolu
tion
Resohed, That the Secretary of the Navy report to this
House, as soon as conveniently may be, whether the President
has n jmmatprf to the Senate the piomotion of a number of
lieutenants mine nivy to the rank ofcornmandeis or master
commandants and what number (it any) of such nominations
-were made by the advice of the Secretary of the Navy, what
service ft is proposed to employ them ir what ships vessels,
or naval stations it 13 proposed they should command, the
number of sSipa, and vessels now m commission, or naval
stations m operation and the number of captains and com
mandants now m commission al?o, whether the increased pay
of such lieutenants, d* it is proposed to promote to the grade
of commanders or master commandants, is included in his
late estimate for the navy
The resolution being objected to—
Mi TRIPLET T moved a suspension of the rules, but, on
taking the question, the motion was lost
On m Uion by >fr FILL WORE, the House took up the mes
sage of the vnate returning the civil ant' diplomatic ippro
priatiorj bill, with its disagreements lo the imendnients oí the
House, and inking onus own amendments
The first amendment insisted on by the Senate, was that in
creasing the appropriation for the Boston custom house from
toOOOOto^tOOOOO
Mr PEOFFIT asked what would be the proper motion for
«be IJouse to insist on its own amendments, and its di&dsrec
mustfrtfc  i*mendments of the Senate,
The SPEAKER replied that the proper motion would be for
the House to insist                                                        „_„
Some conversation ensued between the SPh-AKfcK. and
Messrs ATHERTONand FILLMORE, on the point of ordei,
resulting in the SPEAKER'S quoting the parliamentary law oí
the case from the Manual.
Mr PROFFIT then moved that the House insist on its disa-
Mr ADAMS after some remarks, moved that the House re-
cede from its disagreement
Mr FILLMORE expiessed his anxiety to dispose of these
amendments He was willing to go for the one then before the
House, but would rather the vote should at once be taken As
the subject had been sufficiently discussed already, he was not
disposed to say any thing more in regard to it
Mr CAVE JOHNSON called for the yeas and nays on the
question, which were accordingly ordered
Mr PARMENTER asked if the question should not firbt be
put on the motion to recede
The SPEAKER said that, by reference to the Manual, it v^ould
be found that the motion to insist and the motion to iecede were
of equal dignity, and the question must thert-foie he ¡ ut on the
motion first made
Some conversation then followed between Mr ALIEN and
the SPEAKER on the point of order, resulting m the Speaker's
again deciding that the question must first be put on the motion
tu msi=t
Mr SMJTH oí Virginia, who had just come into the hall, m
quired what was the question before the House, and on being
mfoi med by the Speaker, said that he thought that a bill of this
in poitance ought not to be acted on in the absence of so many
members, who weie necessarily absent, and who took an m
terest in the questions involved [A member heie asked what
they were absent for J lheir absence was involuntary, and the
House itselfwasinvolved, for they were defending its privileges
He would make no motion, (Mr S said,) hut merely threw out
the suggestion for other gentlemen to act on, if they thought
proper
[Note —Several members of the House were absent during
the morning, attending the aigument at the City Hal!, on the
process issued agamst Mr Wise, under the duelling act ]
After some remarks from Messrs S MASON and TILLING
HAST, the question was taken on tha motion to insist, and
carried m tne affirmative  yeas 82, nays 71
The next question was on the amendment of the Senate, and
which was insisted on, striking out the proviso that the money
appropriated should be applied to putting the building in a
suitable condition for the occupation, of the collector and hi&
officers, and not in continuing iny oí the ornamental parts
thereof, to which the House ha I disagreed
Mr FILLMORE moved that the House insist on its disagree
ment, and m taking the question, it was earned in the arruma
ttve without a division
The next amendment of the Senate to which the House dis
agreed was that appropriating ©28,000 for the New York custom
house
Ihe Gleik having read the amendmen*—
Mr C. iOHN ON moved that the House insist on its dis-
agreement, and hoped they would not recede an meh The
House had become so thoroughly -onvinced of the fraudulent
conduct of the architect, that they had not only rejected the
item but had appointed a committee to investigate the matter,
aid ho therefore hoped they would wait till the committee
leported before they voted the money
Mr FILLMORE did not rise for the purpose of debating the
question, but he had been requested to present a letter to the
House fiom thedeputynavalofficerof Newlork, which, it was
alleged, was the basis of the letter of the Secretary of the Treae
ury, which Mr Frazee had given an imperfect version of The
Iettei was pent to him as an explanation, in pait, of Mr Fra
zee's conduct Though there had been some things said for
the purpose of palliating the mdiscietion of Mr Fiazee m fur
mshing a fal ecopj oí the Secietary's Iettei, yet he could not,
till the committee had investigated the matter, agree to vote for
the appropriation At present, he confessed that he must dis
credit all th t ti e architect has said
The letter of the deputy naval officer was then lead
Mr ROOSEVELT said that, with many others, he had in
ikilged in some hasty expressions in condemnation of the indis
cretiooofMi Trazee, and, he now thought with too much <=e
veuty He, had attended the debase on thi& subject in the Sin
ate, and, from the explanations there made was convinced that
Mr Frazee had really given the purport of the letter as he un
derbtood it in good faith Indeed Mr Woodbuiy said that if
the spurious copy hnd been shown him, he would not have been
able to say from memorv, that it was not genuine
Mr PROI FIT hoped that the House would insist on i's dis
agreement and expressed, in a few words, h s disapprobation-
of (he conduct of Mr Fia?ee m giving a false copy of a letter,
from memory, which was to effect the passage of an appropri
atmn through the House
Mr BOWNff addressed the House in favor of the motion to
insist upon the disagreement of the House to the Senate's
amendment How, he aske 1, was, the Hou^e situated at this
time? Before the charge of fraud was made upon Mr Fiazee,
this House had deliberately i efused to vote f r the increased ap
piopnation for the New York customhouse although he had
the benefit of the defence made for him by the honorablegen
t'eman who iow opposed him, and althougn the inteipolations
ofthe letter were operating in his behalf After the fraud was
iiscoverel—and it wa-> as palpable and clear a case of fraud
is wasevu made out—the House, with extraoid nary unanim
Uy, had appointed a committee to m\ estimate the whole aTair,
and with oower to report by bill The authority to revolt a bill
was given them at hi¡s(Mr B *s) suggestion, because he was of
opinion that a pm non of the appropriation should he male
there weresome workmen who were entitled to compensation
f>r the work they had done on the custom house In thisstate
ofthmffs—after the House had refused to make the appropn
ation and had appointed a committee to investigate the whole
matter—the Senate m the face ot this action by the House ha i
-i Ihered to their amendment increasing the appropriation He
(tfr R > was unwilling to retrace the steps which the Hou«e
I ad taken upon the sublet, whilst the committee had the mat
tcr in their handb Mr B concluded by moving that the Hoube
alhere
The SPEAKER decided the motion to be out of order, the
pending question being a motion to insist updh the disagree
ment r ftf e House to the Senate's amendment
Mr FERRIS addressed the House at some length in favor of
the applanation   Reconsidered themoneyas justly due to
the contractors and workmen, who had expended their prop-
eity and laboi for the public service , and that the claims of
these persons were in no way affected by the false issues that
had been raised on this question
Mr ANDREWS having called for the previous question, it
was seconded and carried , and the mam question being taken,
the vote was yeas 95, nays 45
So the House insisted on its disiigreement
The next amendment of the Senate to which the House had
disagreed, was that by which the appropriation id relation to
light houses was increased from $4,000 to ®15,215
Mr FILLMORE nioved that the House insist upon it*
disagreement to the Senate amendment which motion was car-
ried.
The next amendment, a proviso to this appropriation, was
also disagreed to by the House
The next amendment was that by which £5,000 was appro-
priated to paya commercnl agent upon the coast of Africa
This item, which was inserted by the House on Mr Wise's
motion, was dmgteed tn by the Senate
Mi riLLMORE remarked that it was adopted by the House
without deliberan >n He had Ins doubts at the time as to
whether there was any anthonty oflaw to justify the appropri
ation Since then, he had exammedmto the subject, and had
found no act making it the duty ofCongress to appropriate this
money, neither was the appropi lation called for by any of the
dtpaitments He therefore moved that the House recede from
the amendment, which motion was agreed to
The remaining amendments of the Senate to the bill, com-
prehending the salaries of the district clerks their office W
penses, and the salary ol the district at'orney for the southern
dibtnet of New York were then severally disagreed to, and the
bill sent back to the Senate
Mr FILLMORE moved that a committee of confereRce be
appointed to meet a similar committee from the Senate, for the
purpose of arranging the items about which the two Houses
had disagreed
This motion prevailed, and Messrs Fillmore, Adams, and
Cav£ Johnson, were appointed a committee
A number of private bills weie then read a first and sec-
ond time, and referred to appropriate committees
Mr G DAVIS offered the following resolution
Rebolved, That a committee of five be appointed fo inquire
into the causBj manner, and circumstances of the removal of
Henry H Sylvester, late a clerk m the Pension Office, from his
place of clerk aforesaid, and that said committee have power to
send for persons and papers, and to report by bill, resolution,
or otherwise
Mr WELLER, pending the resolution, movtd an adjourn
ment, which was carried
