HEADQUARTERS MORRIS' BRIGADE, Bolivar, Md., July 6, 1863.

Lieutenant W. F. A. TORBERT,Acting Assistant Adjutant-General:

SIR: In answer to your communication, dated 2 p. m. this day, I have to say that, in order to hold the passes strongly, there should be four regiments at each of the three gaps, as the woods are quite open, and the enemy's infantry could sift through the woods and get upon the heights on either side, if he came in force, and have an advantage over me.

I have two pieces and two regiments at the National Pike Pass [Turner's Gap], excepting two companies, which are at the Sharpsburg Pass [Fox's Gap], and two pieces and one regiment in reserve at Bolivar. Colonel Kitching's regiment and two pieces are at Crampton's Pass.

The approaches are so circuitous that artillery can sweep them but for short distances; it would, therefore, be running unnecessary risk to have more guns, unless a still larger amount of infantry should be sent. The chief reliance must be upon infantry.

The character of the ground is stony, so that intrenchments can be thrown up only with great difficulty in many places; stone-wall breastworks, however, can be made. Slashed timber would also strengthen the position. Please send me the engineer company, with such tools as they and my troops can use.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WM. H. MORRIS,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS OF THE ARMY, Washington, July 6, 1863.

Major-General HEINTZELMAN,Commanding:

It is reported that General Elliot's command has drawn 103 wagons for 3, 300 men. Forty wagons are enough for that command.

See that the transportation is reduced to the very minimum, and the troops pushed forward with all possible dispatch.

Very respectfully,

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.
