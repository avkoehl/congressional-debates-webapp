This State is desirous of sending her troops into the field in an efficient condition, and to do so should have reliable instructions, and directly, on the above subject, at the earliest possible day.

I have the honor to be, my dear sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

E. D. MORGAN.
HEADQUARTERS OF THE ARMY, Washington, May 6, 1861.

Major-General SANDFORD, New York:

Send without delay every regiment of the New York quota in and about your city, as soon as equipped for service, to this place, via the ocean and the Potomac River.

WINFIELD SCOTT.

COLUMBUS, OHIO, May 6, 1861.

Hon. SIMON CAMERON,Secretary of War:

Your telegraph just received.* It leaves me in doubt as to the number of regiments you will receive from Ohio for three months and three years. The thirteen regiments under the first call are nearly all mustered in for three months. We have nine additional organized and one more provided for by law. What I desire to know is how many of these last ten regiments you will receive for three years under the last call. It is important for me to know this forthwith, as they should be mustered in immediately.

W. DENNISON,

Governor of Ohio.

COLUMBUS, OHIO, May 6, 1861.

Hon. SIMON CAMERON,

Secretary of War:

The Ohio regiments are in camp. It is important for us to know how many of them will be required under the three-years' enlistment. The mustering officers are here. Please advise by telegraph.

W. DENNISON,

Governor.

COLUMBUS, OHIO, May 6, 1861.

S. P. CHASE,

Secretary of the Treasury:

Will you see Secretary Cameron immediately and learn whether he will accept all our ten regiments under the three years' enlistment. If so, I will have them mustered forthwith. The mustering officer is here. I have no reply about the guns from Washington Arsenal. If possible, let me hear from you to-night.

W. DENNISON.
