Major-General HALLECK,

Washington:

General Thomas may send all the troops ordered before forwarding transportation, except such as can be carried along without delaying the movement. About half the transportation of the troops going to Canby should follow as rapidly as possible.

[FEBRUARY 4, 1865. - For Halleck to Grant, relative to jurisdiction over the east bank of the Mississippi River, see Vol. XLVIII, Part I, p. 736.]

Major-General THOMAS,

Eastport:

General Grant does not deem it advisable for you to send more cavalry to General Canby than first ordered, say 4,000 or 5,000. Canby has many dismounted men, for whom we will send horses as early as possible.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
