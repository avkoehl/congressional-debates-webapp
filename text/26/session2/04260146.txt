26th Cong.....2nd Sbss.                                   Treaswy Note Bill—Mr. Wetter.__________^_________________H. of Reps.
The pre emption bill|is a favorite measure with
ifle, and entasis, all the sympaih es of my nature It
affords me the most sincere pleasure to do all in my
powsr to advance the ínteres' of the hardy and en-
terprising emigrant, who, abandoning the home of
his father , the worn-out, worm- aten land of his
nativity, has taken up his> abode in the rich valleys of
the far West Sir, I would rather be recognised
as the champion of such men, than nold the highest
office within the gift of my country Let these
men have the encouragement of the Government—
the promise that, withm a limited period, they
shall be permitted, at your present price, to pur-
chase the land on which they reside, and, wiih
«heir industry and enterprise, the rude cabin will
soon give way to the comfortable dwelling, and
the wilderness be made "to bloom and blossom as
the rose." By the passage of this ao>, many, in
the old Slates of this Union, who now feel, from
day to day, the cutting lash ol penury and want,
and who have families growing up around them,
without the ability 10 supply ihem with even the
ncessanes of life, would emigiate to the West, set
tie down on jour lands, and soon surround them-
selves with all the comforts of life In this way
you would not only contribute to their happiness,
but in making them the owners oí the ^oif, in-
crease and strengthen their attachment to the Union,
and thus lay the foundat on for Ihe permanent
prosperity of ihe country broad and deep in the
affections of the people I would, for my own pait,
much rather make a gift of the public domain to
bona fide settlers, who would improve the country,
than to see it falling at the Government price into
the hands of speculators
One word more on this point If gentlemen r -
gard this pre emption. bill as an "electioneering"
measure, what, I ask, do they think of the the dis-
tribution act1? That is a measure which has been
hawked about by a distinguished Senator [Mr
Cut] for a number of years, and has constituted a
large portion of his political capita!, a measure,
through the influence oí which he hopes to reach
the goal of his ambition—the Presidency It the
pre-emption bill which has parsed the Senate
passes this House, (and I know it will not be the
fault of the Demc craoy it it does not,) and the price
of the public lands is. graduated, m<itiy portions ot
the country, now considered unproductive and
valueless, will soon be settled and under cultiva-
tion A considerable part ol the public domain
has been in market (or some twenty or thirty years,
and, if the price of this were reduced and gia
duated, much of it might be sold, and thus the Trea
sury replenished, without a resoit to additional
taxes on the people This policy ha> been ad< pted
by some of theSiatts in disposing of their lands,
and ought to be pursued by the Gtneial Govern-
ment.
Much has been said by ihe cliffuent gentlemen
who have addressed the committee in relatu n to
the policy of the next Administra! on Whil t
gentlemen tell us that General Harrison stood
fairly committed before the public upon all the vi
nous questions in wh ch the people are interested,
we find ihem here ditfenng widely .is to the mea-
sures he will recommend, or the policy he will
adopt. The gentleman from New York [Mr Bar
hard] hopes and believes that liberal appropria
lions will be made, the "mgrardly parsimony" ii
the present Administration abandoned, and a ra-
tional Bank established We arc aho Ml 1, by
those high in the confidence of the President elect,
that the proceeds of the public lands will be clis.tr -
buted araong,t the fetate , and an additional tariff
levied on certain articles, to make up the deficiency
in the Treasury Other gentlemen ot the sa ne
party have denounced these measure , and declared
such would not be the policy of General Harnson
Theeloquentgentleman from Virgin a [Mr Wise,]
who has long stood b°fore the countiy as one ot
the ablest champions oí the Wh g cause, has de-
nounced, in unmeasured terms, an increase of the
expenditures of the Government, the project for a
duty on wines and silks and the distnbuiion of the
proceeds of the public lands Wei!, sir, here stand
members of thesame party differing in eveiy tning,
as to the course of the next Administration Now,
does not every one see that if, as ha  been alleged,
General Harrison';, views were well known to the
ceuntry, this contrariety of opinion would not ex
ibt I have no deposition to speak harshly of the
man who has been selected by my countrymen to
preside over tne des'inies of this Republic Not-
withstanding the manner m which he comes in, he
ought to have a fair trial It, as his friends de-
clared before the election would be the case, his
measures are in accordance «ith those which go-
verned the Administration of Jefferson—if he ad
heres to the good old Republican doctrines taught
by our fathers—I wilt not be found arrayed against
him But if, on the contiary, he proves a lahtudi-
natian in his construction of the Constitution—if,
under his ausp'ces, a National Bank is created and
a national debt saddled upon the peuplt, to carry
on a splendid sys em of internal improvement,
thus making Ihe States the mere stipendiaries of the
General Government—if the public money is to be
taken from the hands of public officers, \ here the
iramers of the Cmstitution intended it should be,
and given to bankers, to increase their dividends
and enhance the value of thti  stock—then, sn, I
will oppose his administration boldly and fearlessly,
and to the fullest extent of my humble abilities
The Democratic principles, which I believe to be
inseparably connected with the prosperity of the
country, shall not be sacrificed, if 1 have the power
to avert it
We have, during this debate, had the novel spec-
tacle of Whif members debating the question,
whether or no we will have a special se sion oí
Congress, this summci The Constitution gives the
President alone the power to ci nvtiie Congress,
should he def m it necessary This House has no
control whatever over the Mibject, and yet it has
been warmly discussed by gentlemen; in the Oppo
sitton I understand that a caucus, consisting of
the Whig Senators, has been held, at which it was
detei mined that a special session should be called
Here tMr Jí.nipí.b of Maryland, rose, and after
disclaiming any knowledge of such a caucus, ask-
ed for the authority on which the declaration was
made
Mr Wei ler. responded that lie made the asser-
tion on the authority ot the Whig papers in New
York and Philadelphia, in one of which the names
of the Senators m attendance were given lie
was not awaie that the Senator thus named had
authorised a den al of the correctne s of the re-
port
Mr Jí.nu tii asked Mi Welur whether he be-
lieved all he read in Whig papers'!
Mi WiXLtii ri plied that he was not generally
in the habit of placing much confidence on them,
but that, when they undt rtook to give the move-
ments of their party leader-, he supposed they
might be depended on
It is th<>n sealed Mr Chairman, "-o lar is the ad-
visets of the President arc c< ncirned, ihat we- must
have a special session of Contris And it r what
purpose' It our cimitiy were about to be involve 1
in a war, and it were important to make prepara
tions for defending our rights, an extraordinary
session might be nccussary and proper, but why
call us from oui homes, at an expense of some
three or four hundred thousand dillars to the peo.
die? I know of m other reason than because yon
are anxious to repeal the act commonly called the
' Sub Treasury bill In the late canvass the banks
freely expended their money to elevate the Whig
orators to office, and now they are impatient f< r
their remuneiaticn, they have complied with their
part oí the contract, and expect you to comply with
yours, by giving them the use and custody of the
public money They are unwilling to trust you
until the annu U se s on of Congress Yes, nr,
the bank  have issued their edicts to you, and you
have issued jouis to fh  President elect, demanding
a special session cf Congress, in order that the
"Sub Treasury" may be repealed, and the puolic
momy be again given to a favored few to advance
their mteiests The gentleman from Indiana [Mr
Lane] said that this act had "carried darkness
and gloom inlo every avenue of life," ?nd has re-
peated to tnii House a speech about the remov.il of
the deposites, the specie c rcalar, the B ink of the
United States, &c I have no doubt, «ir, that
speech was frequently recited to his constituents at
home dHimg the late election, and received from
them much more attention than it met with here
We were told some years ago, when the patriot ef
the Hermitage was a candidate for the Presidency,
that "war, pestilence, and famine" were pieféiablé
to the rule of a military chieftain, and another dis-
tinguished Senator, who is soon to be in the cabinet,
in depicting the ruin that must ensue from the remo-
val of the deposites, declared that our "canals would
be a solitude and our lakes a desert waste of waters "
But, sir, that military chieftain was elected, and
neither "war," "pestilence," nor "famine," over-
spread the land, but on the contrary, so ably did
he administei the Government, that we now find
these men the most devoted supporters of military
chieftains. The public deposites were not restored,
nor were our canals made a "solitude," but, on the
contrary, the eommeice of the country increased,
and the people continual prosperous and happy.
But I have no inclination to review the acts of Ge-
neral Jackson's administration, they have been
pass°d upon by the American people, and now
cons ilute a part of out national history He who
believes he can divert public attention from the pro-
fligate acts ot the banks, and make them believe
that the more fact of the Government taking care
of its own money, by means of the "Sub-Treasu-
ry" law, has produced the present low prices of la-
boi and produce, and the general embarrassment in
the business of the country, has much mistaken the
intelligence of the people The time for such ar*
gurnet ts (if arguments they can be called) has
gone by It may have done well enough, during a
1 eated canvass, to advance such doctrines, but the
time for reasoning has returned, and the sober
judgment of the people is no v directed to the true
cause of their difficulties
We have, Mr Chairman, just passed through
one of the most violent contests ever witnessed m
our country The fires, of party strife were kindled
in the valleys and on the Hll-tops, the whole repub-
lic was converted into an amphitheatre, m which
pol ttcal gladiators met m fierce combat and battle
array The successful parly, by low appeals to the
prejudices of ihe people—by shows and r>arades of
th< moit disgusting character—called into action
all the worst passions of the human heart, and
made enemies, bitter and irreconcilable, of those
whom nature designed for friends Sir, I need not
remind you of the foolish processions, the vulgar
songs, and the various shows, which eutered into
and constituted the capital stock of our opponents
in the late canvass They are still fiesh m youi
recollection, and, I trust, for the honor of our com-
mon country, will never again be repea'ed Such
scenes were moulting to the intelligence of the peo-
ple, and well calculated lo undermine the founda-
tion of oui free institutions But, sir, the election
is, ovei, and we have assembled here as legislators-,
for tne put pose of enacting such laws as maybe
deemed necessary to promote the welfare of our
constituents I expected that the excitement con-
nected with that election had subsided, and that we
shou'd meet in this Hall as friends—as Americans
jointly interested in ihe perpetuity 'of the Republic,
and anxious to do all m our power to brighten,
to strengthen, and to extend the chain of our
federal Union I did hope that a conciliatory
sjirit would prevail, and that the rude conflicts
through which we have passed would not be íe-
newed, that oil would be poured upon the troubled
waters, that our victorious opponents wou'd act in
the spirit that becomes a generous foe, and not, m
tones of exultation, taunt us with our defeat, and
continue to denounce us as violators of the Consti-
tution, and ensmies to the Republic In all this I
have been mistaken Before the elect on we were
told that, in the event the Whig party succeeded,
we should have "an era of good feeling," that
every thing would be done to repress that violent
party spirit which has at times threatened the per-
manency of our institutions But, sir, the general
tone of the Whig members in this debate has been
any thing e! e than pacific Notwithstanding the
public mind demands repose, they have determined
thrie-hall be no peace, that this Republic shall
again be convu'sed, and the fires of party rekindled.
During this discussion, the party to which I am
proud to belong has been denounced with unusua
