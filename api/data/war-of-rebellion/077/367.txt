GENERAL: The rebels about FIFTY strong attacked our forces at Athens this morning at 8 o'clock and fought some time, our forces killing 2, wounding 3, and taking 1 prisoner, and then the rebels retreated southward from that place. I sent a squad of ninety men, commanded by Captain Bivens, by this morning's train, by direction of Captain Ammen, assistant adjutant-general.

The following is a telegram I have just received:
