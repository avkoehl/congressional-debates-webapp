Brigadier General CLINTON B. FISK, Pilot Knob:

Bloomfield should be held, if possible; but it will probably be necessary to give the commanding officer at that place discretionary authority abandon the place, if threatened by overwhelming force.

Brigadier-General McNEIL, Springfield, Mo.:

Reports indicate a concentration of the enemy near Fort Smith, with intention to attack General Blunt at Fort Gibson. The latter may need re-enforcements soon.
