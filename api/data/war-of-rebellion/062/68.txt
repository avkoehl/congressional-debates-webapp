pelled to fence it. The large extent of prairie lands, the scarcity of timber and labor, require this change in the law in order that these parties may be able to produce sufficient bread for their sustenance the coming season.

I am, very truly, your obedient servant,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF SOUTHWEST MISSOURI, Springfield, Mo., January 12, 1864.

Colonel J. J. GRAVELY,Commanding at Lebanon:

COLONEL: There is much complaint among the people of Dallas County in regard to our troops taking too much of their forage. It is very important that enough should be left to enable them to keep their stock and do the spring work. You will detail two discreet commissioned officers to go to that region of country and ascertain what the condition as to forage and what amount of forage can be spared from that section. If forage is scarce where you are and is plenty south or southeast in Wright County two or more companies might be and should be moved from the road to such points as will furnish forage. The only troops that procure forage from Dallas County are those on the road. I except the company at Warden's Station. Confer with the captain on the subject.

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF SOUTHWEST MISSOURI, Springfield, Mo., January 12, 1864.

Colonel JOHN E. PHELPS,Commanding at Cassville, Mo.:

What point or points south or southeast of you furnish the most abundant forage? It is important that the larger portion of your mounted force be sent to such points; also that points be selected that will best cover our telegraph line and road. Give me your views on the matter.

JOHN B. SANBORN,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF SOUTHWEST MISSOURI, Springfield, Mo., January 12, 1864.

Lieutenant-Colonel BISHOP,Commanding at Fayetteville, Ark.:

Has Captain Worthington made his report of the affairs at Newton and Searcy Counties yet? If not, have him do so. My opinion is that at least one battalion of your forces and one section of artillery should be disposed of at and west or northwest of the town, and the balance I judge may be extended as far east as Newton County and perhaps farther. Give me your ideas as soon as you have your mind made up. Reference must be had to covering our road and telegraph line.

JOHN B. SANBORN,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
