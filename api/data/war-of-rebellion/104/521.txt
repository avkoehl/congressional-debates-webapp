Colonel C. T. CHRISTENSEN,

Asst. Adjt. General, Hdqrs. Mil. Div. of West Mississippi:

COLONEL: A rebel soldier has just come in from Taylor's command. He says Taylor started from Meridian with his whole force, about 8,000, moving in this direction, but for some cause stopped and went into camp ten miles this side of Meridian. It is supposed that his intention was to reoccupy this place. It appears to me that our special attention should be directed toward that command in case negotiations fail.

Very respectfully, colonel, your obedient servant,

F. STEELE,

Major-General, Commanding.
