NEW JERSEY-
Joseph F. Randolph,
When the CLERK arrived at this part of the
roll, he stated that there was conflicting evidence
with regard to the election of five members from
this State, and asked it it was the pleasure of the
House that he should pass over their names until
the call of the balance of the roll was completed.
Mr. MAXWELL wished to know what this
evidence was, or whether the usual evidence was
produced on both sides.
The CLERK asked if it was the pleasure of the
House that he should make a statement as to the
usnal course of proceeding?
Several members called for the reading of the
evidence.
The CLERK then read the commission of Mr.
Aycrgg, signed by Governor Pennington, and
stated that there were five other commissions in his
possession in the same style.
Mr. MERCER then called for the reading of the
law of New Jersey on thi* subject.
Mr. CAVE JOHNSON desired that the evi-
dence on the other side be read by the Clerk before
the law was read to the House.
Mr. MERCER stated that his object in baring
the law read at this stage of the proceeding was to
show what could be received as evidetcs by this
body.
Mr. VANDERPOEL contended that all the
facts should be laid before the House before the
law was read. In the present case, there were con-
flicting returns and conflicting evidence, and it
seemed to him that it would be more in order to
read the evidence on both sides before the law was
read, than to read the law at the present time.
Mr. TILLINGHAST thought the most proper
course would be for the Clerk to read the law now,
so that the House might be enabled to decide what
could be received as evidence in relation to this
matter. When this body heard the law read, then
it could decide whether the paper on the other side
could be read as evidence.
Mr. JENIFER wished to know of the Clerk,
whether there were any other returns in his posses-
sion from New Jersey, signed by the Governor of
that State, than the six which had been referred to?
If there were not, why not proceed to call the roll
in the usual manner?
The CLERK here asked if it was the pleasure of
the House that he should make a statement in xe-
lation to this matter.
Mr. RIVES respectfully suggested the propriety
of laying this motion on the table for the present,
in order that the rcll might be called through, to
ascertain whether there was   quorum of member
