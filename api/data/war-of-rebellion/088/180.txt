General Meade has been directed to watch closely, and if present demonstration north of James River should force the enemy to weaken his lines at Petersburg, so that advantage can be taken of it, do so without waiting for further instructions.

Please instruct General Ord that in case of operations against Petersburg he will receive orders from General Meade.
