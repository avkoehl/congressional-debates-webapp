Ho. of Reps.
to obtain employment of any kind by which to
earn any wages. The omission of these ele-
ments from the calculation vitiates the Com-
missioner's figures, even though they are in
themselves true as Holy Writ, and conceals
the fraud this report was intended to perpetrate.
Let the gentleman from Ohio glorify the mem-
ory of 1860 as he may, I confidently reiterate
what I said in the former discussion:
"Eighteen hundred andsixty and 1861, andfroml857
to the autumn of the fatter ycar.was one ofthedarkesfc
periods ever seen by the laboring people of America.
Not one outof five of theskilled workmen of the coun-
try was steadily employ ed. InPhiiadelphia.when they
wanted to build a street railroad they advertised for
two hundred and fifty handsat sixty oent3a day,and
more than five thousand offered, a majority of whom
were skilled artisans who could find no other em-
ployment. In the neigh borhood of one of the estab-
lishments, the statistics of which go into this report,
a rolling-mill, the Dumber of unemployedmen wasso
great that the county authorities, to save its skilled
workmen from open pauperism, determined to build
a turnpike, andexperiehced handsfromrolling-mills
were employed at breaking stone and road-making
at fifty cents a day rather than become paupers. For
the comparatively few who had employment the
wages are, I assume, honestly given in the report;
bnt of the many who were picking up a precarious
living by getting an occasional day's work at half
wages or quarter wages noaceountistaken; and thus
facts that may be true in themselves, by being sepa-
rated from tho e which would have explained and
interpreted them, are made to libel our country and
the Congress that carried it through the war.
" Let me in this connection bring the attention of
gentlemen to some facts:
"Look at the palatial buildings erected in this city
daring the last year and the comfortable dwellings
for mechanics and laborers. How many of them
there are you have all seen. They are built by
squares and blocks. I have endeavored to ascertain
bow many were built in 1860, and can hear of but
four dwelling houses built in Washington in that
year. In 1861, so far as I have been able to learn,
butone dwelling house and one public school-house,
the contract |>riee for which was $3,500, were erected
Leaving Washington, I go to my own city, and by
turning to the report of the building inspectors find
that in 1860 twenty-four hundred and seventy-two
houses were built. The decline had commenced, and
in 1861 but sixteen hundred and seventy-three were
built. In 1860 we enlarged five hundred and eighty-
eight buildings; in 1861 but two hundred and four
were enlarged. But in 1868, when the Commissioner
tells us labor was not as prosperous as iu 1860, we
erected forty-seven hundred and ninety-six build-
ings and enlarged twelve hundred and fifteen. In
1868 there was an active demand for labor, and its
price was high. It could determine its own wages.
In 1860 labor was begging employment and wages
were low. As a general thing mechanics had to ac-
cept whatever wages were offered, though in a few
instances favored establishments were able to run,
continuously and pay fair wages. These exceptional
cases havefurnished the Commissioner data for what
he announces as a general law.
"The low rate of wages that ruled in 18fl0 would
have led a proficient in political economy to look for
the facts 1 am now about to lay before you. It is a
law of social science that when employments scarce
labor must accept low wages and loses time; but
when employment is quick and active labor regulates
its own w.iges and is constantly employed. The
tables presented by tb e Commissionerignore this law,
and are consequently a fraud upon Congress and a
slander upon our country, tbe working people of
which were never so prosperous as now,
"Let uie exhibit some other comparisons between
1860 and 1868 which bear upon the question at issue.
In that blessed year, 1860. which tbe Commissioner
eulogiz* s, the sheriff of Pniladelphia received seven-
teen hundred and forty writs for tbe sale of real
estate, while in 1868, the year of congressional wrong
and pecuniary depression, the sheriff of that city
received but seven hundred and six writs for the sale
of real estate, a falling off of largely more than fifty
per cent, though in the interval there has been an
increase of forty per cent., in the population and
vastly more than that in the wealth of the city."
In connection with these statements I brought
to the attention of the House on that occasion
such figures drawn from the reports of the sav-
ings-banks of seven States as I happened to
have at hand. Since then I have been able to
add much to my collection of that class of facts,
some of which I will proceed to exhibit. I
have the official statement of the total amount
of deposits in the savings-banks of Maine, New
Hampshire, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island,
of the Philadelphia Saving-Fund Society,which
is allowed to receive but $200 from any one
depositer in a year, and of the savings-banks
of the city of Newark, New Jersey, for 1860
and 1861, and of those institutions, and a third
at Newark, a dime savings-bank, which lias
since come into existences for 1SBT and 1868.
I have also reports from other states, butas the/
do not cover the four years designated they
could not be embraced in the table I have
compiled. That I have not been wanting in
diligence in my endeavors to procure such offi-
cial information as would enable me to make
a general comparative table for these years
will be attested by gentlemen on this floor and
in the Senate, of whom I have requested the
names of the proper parties to whom to apply,
and by Mr. Spofford, the Librarian of Con-
gress, to whose industry and courtesy I am
much indebted.
All the information obtained shall be fully
presented, and I think the gentleman from
Ohio, [Mr. Garfield,] though he may remem-
ber 1860 as a pleasant and prosperous year,
will be persuaded that millions of his country-
men remember it as a year of ceaseless agony,
during which gaunt want entered their homes
because the last dollar of their past earnings
had been extorted irom them by enforced
idleness.
I have not been able to ascertain the num-
ber of depositors in all the institutions to which
I am referring for each year, but have them
from the Saving Fund Society of Philadelphia
and the' savings banks of New Hampshire,
Massachusetts, and Rhode Island. These
are, however, sufficient to indicate the general
condition of the class of people who are de-
positors in suchinstitutions, and whose relative
poverty in 1867 Mr. Wells so deplores. On
the 1st day of January, 1860, there were
twenty-one thousand two hundred and sixty-
five depositors in the institution at Philadel-
phia, and on the 1st of January, 1881, there
were but twelve thousand six hundred and
sixty-two ; and the total amount of deposits
had gone down from $4,083,450 to $2,251,646,
or little more than one half. In Massachu-
setts, as an official statement before me shows,
the number of depositors has fallen off in but
two years from 1834 to 1868, inclusive. In 1865
the total decrease was one hundred and twenty-
eight, an almost incalculably small fraction of
one per cent., but in the year 1861, in conse-
quence of the wantof employment in 1860, the
number fell off five thousand and ten, or two
and one sixth per cent, and the deposits re-
maining at the close of the year were reduced
$268,797.
The number of depositors in the savings-
banks of Rhode Island has receded in but one
year from 1855 to 1868 inclusive, which was
1861, when they fell off five hundred and ninety-
eight, notwithstanding which the aggregate
deposit increased $119,119 83.
The extreme force of the depression which,
as the result of our adhesion to free trade and
an exportable metallic currency, overtook the
country in 1857, and terminated only with the
issue of the currency known as greenbacks,
and the passage of the protective tariff of 1861
seems to have fallen upon New Hampshire as
early as 1858. From 1850 to 1868,- inclusive,
the number of depositors in savings-banks of
that State has decreased in but two years, 1858
and 1866. In the latter year the number of
depositors fell off about one per cent-., not-
withstanding which the deposits increased
$26,265 31; but in 1858 the depositors fell
off seven per cent., or thirteen hundred and
twenty-three, and the deposits were reduced
$159,627 40.
While recounting the manifold blessings that
period brought to the working people of the
country the gentleman from Ohio reminded me
that the working people were docile in that
year, and indulged in no strikes either for
higher wages or against a reduction of their
pay. He said:
"Jtwas a year of plenty, of great increase. I re-
member, moieover, that it was a year of light taxes.
There was but one great people on the face of the
globe so lightly taxed as the American people in 1860.
Now we aie the most heavily taxed people except
one, perhaps, on the face of the globe; and the weight
of nearly all our taxes falls at last on the laboring
man. This is an element which the gentleman seems
to have omittod from his calculation altogether.
" Tbe gentiem an says that at th c preseu t time labor-
ers are doing better than iu 1830. I ask him l>ow
many strikes there were among laborers in 1830-61?
Were there any at all? And how many were th*'re
in 1868? Will the gentleman deny that strikes oxhibit
the unsettled and unsatisfactory condition of labor
in its relations to capital? In our mines, in our mills
and furnaces, in our manufacturing establishments,
are not tho laborers every day joining in strikes lor
higher wages, and saying that they need them on
account of the high price of provisions, or that tho
capitalists get too large a share of the profits?"
The gentleman has my thanks for bringing
this significant fact, so destructive of his own
argument and that of Mr. Wells to my atten-
tion. He knows that it was not until Jeshu-
run waxed fat that he kicked; and he ought
to know that unemployed workmen, who had
drawn the last dollar from the savings-bank,
and parted with furniture in exchange for food
and fuel, were not in a condition to strike, and
had no employers whose decrees they might
resist. I need no more powerful illustration
of the absurdity of the assertions of the Com-
missioner than the fact that the workingmen
of to-day, in contrast with their abject con-
dition in 1860, find so wide a market for their
labor and are so comparatively easy in their
condition that when their rights or interests
are assailed they are able to offer resistance to
the assailant.
Our positions are fairly taken, and as the
condition of savings-banks furnish the truest
and most general index to the condition of the
laboring people, the facts I am about to present
will overthrow him who is in error. Be the
judgment of the general public what it may, I
am confident that the memory of every Ameri-
can workingman who remembers the experi-
ence of 1860 will sustain me in this controversy.
Having shown the loss of depositors and de-
posits in the only banks from which I could
obtain information on those points in or about
1860, let me compare the condition in these
respects of the same banks iu 1867 and 1888:
c, , r Increase in lncrmm nf

New Hampshire 1867 4.907 $2,672,150 05
New Hampshire 1868 7,-176 2.705.242 01

Philadelphia 1868 2,234 761,901 00
94,682 $40,462,034 24
The contrast these figures present to those
of 1860 does not give the Commissioner's the-
ory much support, and casts a shade of doubt
over the accuracy of the position taken by the
gentleman from Ohio. It may, however, be
regarded as exceptional, and I therefore pro-
pose to present a broader range of facts, em-
bracing the amount of deposits in the banks of
Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, New-
ark, New Jersey, and the onlj institution at
Philadelphia from which 1 have been able to
obtain this information for the years 1880â€”61
and 1867-68. 1 have sought for corresponding
facts from all the other Ne.v England States
aud New York, but have not been able to
obtain them. These tables are, therefore, as
complete as industry and the broadest research
possible in so limited a period could make
them. As, however, they present so general
a correspondence for both periods it is fair to
presume that they indicate the condition of the
savings-banks and their depositors throughout
the country. The total amount of deposits in
these banks in 1860-61 was as follows:
