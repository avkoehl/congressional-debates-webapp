HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE OHIO, Huntsville, July 12, 1862.

Lieutenant-Colonel CONKLIN,Commanding Thirty-fifth Indiana Volunteers, Fayetteville:

SIR: The general commanding directs that you march with your regiments for Elk River Bridge, on Chattanooga road, as heretofore ordered. It will probably be best for you to move via Winchester. On the march you will keep on the alert for the rebel cavalry which has been through that part of the country. You will report your arrival and anything of interest that may occur or that you may observe. Telegraph stations have been ordered to be established at Tullahoma and Cowan. It is not the intention to put your regiment as a guard on the line, but to put it in a position suitable for future movements. You will, however, guard the bridge and railroad while you are near it.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. M. WRIGHT,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
