CAMP ON CORINTH ROAD, May 27, 1862.

Major-General POPE:

You will advance to-morrow morning on the left, or southern, road leading to Corinth, and establish batteries in proper distance of enemy's works. If possible, cross Bridge Creek and carry the enemy's works at the Widow Phillips'. As soon as your heavy batteries are in position, open your fire on the enemy; at the same time advance a strong force on the Danville road to cover your left. If you think any modification of this order necessary, telegraph to-night.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General.

FARMINGTON, May 27, 1862.

Major-General HALLECK:

I will send an officer to you to-night to lay before you my views of your order. I will be ready to execute it at an early hour to-morrow.

JNO. POPE,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE MISSISSIPPI, May 27, 1862.

Major-General HALLECK:

A white woman living near the railroad east of this place left Corinth night before last. She asserts positively that the enemy were leaving Corinth in the direction of Memphis, and it is fully believed by men whom we have as scouts and who know the woman well. I give you this for what it is worth.

JNO. POPE,Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE MISSISSIPPI, Farmington, May 27, 1862.

General GORDON GRANGER:

You will send a brigade of cavalry to proceed by some secluded route to a point on the Mobile and Ohio Railroad at least 40 miles south of Corinth, with instructions to destroy the railroad bridges, trestle works, telegraph wires, &amp;c., wherever it is practicable, and to render the railroad useless, as far as possible.

In your orders to the officer commanding the brigade you will give him the necessary instructions as to his movements, being careful that he is to return by a different route from that pursued in his forward movement.

Respectfully,
