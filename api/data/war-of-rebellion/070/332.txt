this date General Averell fell back to Greencastle, where I had previously detached fifteen men and an officer from Lieutenant H. T. McLean's party. This latter officer had pickets near McCoy's Ferry, which were driven, about 3 p. m., back to Mercersburg. The enemy's advance, 200 men, charged through the town, forced the small party to fall back after a severe skirmish. Dark coming on, a picket was left at Bridgeport, while Lieutenant H. T. McLean fell back to Saint Thomas, seven miles from Chambersburg, on the Pittsburg pike. In course of the day and evening all of the horses in the Valley, amounting to several thousand, were moved north by order, and the trains of General Averell, with those at Hagerstown, refugees, &amp;c., came through and encamped near Chambersburg. I notified General Averell that I had no force to protect them. That officer was duly notified of Lieutenant H. T. McLean's movements as well as that I had no force to protect his trains.

The following dispatch was sent:
