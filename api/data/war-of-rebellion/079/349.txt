Major-General SHERMAN:

GENERAL: General Hood left here yesterday morning on the Alpine road with his army, leaving only a few regiments of cavalry as a rearguard. Part of his force took the Gaylesville road, and followed it for a mile, then crossed over to the Alpine road. I charged two regiments of rebel cavalry at Trion Factory, capturing 27 prisoners. I also had some work driving them out of Summerville. Cheatham's corps passed down the Broontown Valley road the day before yesterday. A reliable citizen says that the rebels will cross Tennessee River at Guntersville.

Respectfully,

LOUIS D. WATKINS,

Colonel, Commanding Brigade.
