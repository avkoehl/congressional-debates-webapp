Lieutenant Colonel MAX. WOODHULL,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Fifteenth Army Corps:

COLONEL: I have the honor to report the following movements of my division on the 13th instant: Breaking camp at 6 a. m. I moved through Richmond upon the Brookton pike, pursuing the same a distance of ten miles in the direction of Hanover Court-House; thence to the left, on the Ashland road, to the vicinity of Ashland, where I again changed the direction of my march to the right, upon the Ashland and Hanover Court-House road, traversing the same as far as Purdy's plantation, near which I placed my command in bivouac at 6 p. m., having marched nineteen miles. Brook Creek and Stony Run and Chickahominy River were crossed en route. The roads, after leaving the main and direct route to Hanover Court-House, were almost impassable. Brigade trains being compelled to pursue another road in consequence, and not being able to join the division during the night, a large number of officers were thus deprived of bedding and subsistence for the night.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOHN M. CORSE,

Brevet Major-General.
