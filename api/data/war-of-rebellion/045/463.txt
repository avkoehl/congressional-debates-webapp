You will also guard the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad from Frederick to a junction with General Schenck, to whom you will communicate your instructions. In the event of our being compelled to withdraw and retire before the enemy, you will be in readiness to throw your command by rail, or march, as may be most practicable and speedy, into the Defenses of Washington. He desires that for the present you will hold the line of communication to Frederick. Keep it open, and send up from Frederick all stragglers, keeping the town clear and in good order.
