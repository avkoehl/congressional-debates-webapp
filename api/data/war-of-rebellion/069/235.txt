HEADQUARTERS,In the Field, near Bermuda Hundred, Va.,

May 26, 1864-8.30 p.m. (Received 10 a.m. 27th.)

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Chief of Staff:

Telegram of 10 a.m. to-day received. Orders were already given this morning to put, say, 17,000 infantry in condition to move at once, leaving what may be sufficient only, in the judgment of myself and officers, to hold the line of defenses between the James and Appomattox, near Point of Rocks, which is our defensive line. You say "hold the line of the James to City Point."Is it intended to abandon this line and retire to City Point? This will be a work of time to save material and men. General Meigs can explain the difference. At all events send transportation which has been ordered to Washington.
