order of business.
Mr. WILSON. I desire to ask unanimous
consent to put a little bill of six lines, to bury
a soldier in a national cemetery, on its passage.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Massachusetts asks unanimous con-
sent to pass a bill. The Chair will request the
Secretary to read the order adopted by the
Senate in reference to the session this evening.
Mr. WILSON. If there is any objection to
it, I will not press it.
Tbe Chief Clerk read as follows:
Ordered, That on Monday nest, at twelve o'clock,
Senate bill No. 656,, to extend the provisions of the
fourth section of the act approved April 20,1871, be
resumed to the exclusion of all other business, and
that it be continued, subject to recess and adjourn-
ment, until disposed of before adjournment on Tues-
day.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is the
order of the Senate. What is the pleasure of
the Senate ?
Mr. WILSON. I suppose that by unani-
mous consent the bill might be taken up. If
not, I will not press it: but if it can be, I
should like to put it on its passage.
Mr. MORRILL, of Vermont. I would not
object to this, but if this is allowed to come
in, of pourse other cases will come in.
Mr. WILSON. I will not press it.
TAX AND TARIFF BILL.
A message from the House of Represent-
atives, by Mr. Clinton Lloyd, its Chief Clerk,
announced that the House had passed a bill
(H. R. No. 2322) to reduce duties on imports,
and to reduce internal taxes, and for other
purposes ; in which it requested the concur-
rence of the Senate.
The bill was read twice by its title, and
referred to the Committee on Finance.
EXTENSION OF KU KLUX ACT.
The Senate, as in Committee of the Whole,
resumed the consideration of the bill (S. No.
G56) to extend the provisions of the fourth
section of the act approved April 20, 1871.
Mr. OSBORN. Being out of the Chamber
for a little while this afternoon, I was informed
by tny colleague on returning to my seat that
the Senator from Missouri, [Mr. Blair,] who
was speaking at the time, had made the state-
ment that the debt of Florida had been in-
creased from a few hundred thousand dollars
to $15,000,000 during the last few years. That
being the case, and assuming that the Senator
so stated upon my colleague's statement, I
desire to say a few words in relation to the
actual indebtedness of the State.
On the 26th of April, 1872, the Lieutenant
Governor of Florida, in charge of the executive
office of the State, in his message to the Legis-
lature made the following statement of the debt
of the State as furnished to him by Robert H.
Gamble, comptroller:
Seven percent, bonds of 1857 $164,000 00
Eight percent, convention bonds of 1868... 30,000 00
Six per cent.bonds of 1868-69,sold  79,0U0 00
Six per cent, bonds of 1868 (four hundred}
hypothecated to L. P. Bayne a.nd New
York Warehouse and Security Company
for  100,000 00
Six per cent, bonds of 1868 (eight) hypothe-
cated to B. 0. Lewis  8,222 16
Seven per cent, bonds of 1871  350.000 00
Bond of 1866, internal improvement fund, 21,000 00
747,322 16
Less bonds of 1857 due Indian trust fund
of the United States, against whom
recognized claims of the State of 3?lorida
make a balance in favor of the State  132,000 00
Total of bonded debt proper &615,322 16
The following indebtedness is due by the State to
its own seminary and school funds for moneys taken
from those funds during the war and used for public
expenditures. It is not properly to bo included in
the public debt except in taxation for the interest:
School fund in State bonds of 1856,1857,1861,1883,
and 1867   $190,652 63
Seminary funds in State bonds of 1S56,
1857, 1861, and 1863  71.202 15
Total $262.015 03
Interest account.
The comptroller reported at the hist, session the in-
terest on the school and seminary debt paid to
July 1, 1871, and remaining due on the general
bonded debt to January 1, 1872 $157,606 09
Add principal of bonded debt proper  615,322 16
Total principal'and a.ccrued interest..^772^-8 25
floating debt.
Outstanding greenback warrants.,   #60,000 00
Outstanding tax-paying' warrants  7,000 00
Outstanding non-tax-paying warrants  93,569 69
Total floating debt  160,569 69
Total bonded debt and interest  772,928 25
Entire State debt   $933,497 94
Now, deducting the bonds belonging to the
school fund and held by the State of ยง262.045 08
from the entire debt of the State of $933,497 94,
we have out standing, all told, $671,452 86.
That there may be no misunderstanding in
the matter or an assumption that this state-
ment is partisan or made for partisan ends, I
will state that the Governor is a Republican
while the comptroller is a strict Democrat
and in no political sympathy with the party in
power. ' *
The State, by legislative action, became in-
dorser to the extent of $16,000 per mile for
about two hundred and twenty-five miles of
railroad now completed, oil which the,indorse-
ment is about thirty-six hundred thousand
dollars. The 3t?,te, by virtue of a prior lien
to this indorsement, has in addition about half
a million dollars of interest or security on this
road. This road is well built, well stocked, and
paying. The State security carries with it a
first mortgage lien, and the property is in
every way equal to the liability of the State
for it.
Thus I have given the debt of the State
of Florida as it stands to-day, i. e., outstand-
ing, $671,452 86 ; bonds belonging to the
school fund and held by the State itself,
$262,045 08; indorsement of the Jackson-
ville, Pensacola, and Mobile railroad, $16,000
per mile, $3,600,000. The State owns more
than ten million acres of land, and holds in
various securities several hundred thousand
dollars, but the exact amount of which I do
not now remember, thus leaving the State
debt as it stands at $671,452 86, that being
the debt of the State to-day.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill is
still open to amendment. If no amendment
be offered, it will be reported to the Senate.
Mr. HAMILTON, of Maryland. There are
several gentlemen who desire to address the
Senate.
Mr. VICKERS. They are not here.
Mr. HAMILTON, of Maryland. They ought
to be here. We have no quorum present now,
and rather than have the bill reported to the
Senate now I shall insist on a count of the
Senate.
Mr. PATTERSON. As there seems to be
no disposition to go on with this bill, there is
a little bill that I should like to take up in the
interim.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Vermont on the left of the Chair
objects to any business being done except what
is regularly before the Senate. Does he with-
draw his objection ?
Mr. MORRILL, of Vermont. I merely
objected to the bill of the Senator from Mas-
sachusetts because the order absolutely pro-
hibits any other business being done, and if
we should yield to one we ought to yield to
all. I think we ought not to violate the rule.
Mr. PATTERSON. There seems to be a
lull, and no one ready to make a speech, and
I should like to take up a little bill of a few
lines.
Mr. MORTON. I see the Senator from
Maryland [Mr. Vickeks] has a book in his
hand, and probably he is ready to go on.
Mr. HAMILTON, of Maryland. My col-
league desires to make a few remarks.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sena-
tor from New Hampshire asks unanimous con-
sent to take up a bill.
Mr. SPENCER. I object. It is contrary
to the order adopted by the Senate.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sena-
tor from, Alabama objects,
