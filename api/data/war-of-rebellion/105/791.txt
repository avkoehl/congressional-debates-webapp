Colonel JAMES H. CARLETON,

Commanding District of Southern California, Los Angeles, Cal.:

SIR: The general commanding the department desires you to place the company of Second Cavalry California Volunteers going down on the Senator in camp near Los Angeles (Camp Latham), where it will remain until joined by the other two companies composing Lieutenant-Colonel Evan's command.

RICHD. C. DRUM,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE PACIFIC,San Francisco, Cal., December 30, 1861.,

Commanding OFFICER, COMPANY A, FIFTH INFTY. CALIFORNIA VOLS.:

(Through Commanding Officer Fifth Infantry California Volunteers, Auburn, Cal.)

SIR: The vessel on which your company will embark has as freight a very large amount of Government property and stores, and the object in sending your force is to provide a sufficient guard during the time you are passing up the Gulf of California. The general is particularly anxious that no cause of complaint should be given the Mexican authorities, and therefore desires that no one belonging to your command should land at Guaymas unless absolutely necessary. When the stores are transferred from the steamer to the sail vessels you will divide your force and place a platoon on each schooner. On your arrival at the mouth of the river, or wherever the second transfer may be made, you will ascertain, if possible, the number of trips the river-boat will have to make, and then so dispose of your force as will enable you to send a sufficient guard with each load. Having been selected for your discretion and prudence, the general expects you to afford every assistance in your power in transporting and guarding the Government property, and, as far as consistent to respect the authorities of the Mexican authorities.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

RICHD. C. DRUM,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
