The troops sent via Mobile will renew their rations at that point, instead of Meridian. The artillery moving from Columbus, Miss., will be supplied with rations and forage sufficient to last to Montgomery, where they will renew their supplies, as well as at Macon. Your chief quartermaster and commissary will make the necessary arrangements for the rapid transportation of these troops to their division.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,
