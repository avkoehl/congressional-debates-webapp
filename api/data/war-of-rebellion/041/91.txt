U. S. S. HARTFORD,

Opposite Mouth of Red River, May 4-1 a. m.

Soon after midnight of May 4 an alarm beat to quarters. A large fleet was discovered descending the Mississippi. We exchanged messages.

PORTER,

Admiral.

IRON-CLAD BENTON.

My compliments.

FARRAGUT,

I will be on board immediately.

PORTER.

NEAR PORT HUDSON,

May 5--12.30 p. m.

Captain ALDEN:

Did Swann get over safely? I am in communication with Banks and Grant. Porter arrived Sunday night with four iron-clads, and is now up Red River.

FARRAGUT,

Admiral.

Swann is here. Large lot of corn at lower mouth of False River. Two regiments of Illinois cavalry, from Tennessee, reached Baton Rouge on the 2d. Left the 27th. They came down the Jackson and New Orleans Railroad, destroying much of it; all the bridges, cars, and locomotives. Heard heavy firing on the 29th at Grand Gulf. Lost 1 man killed, 5 wounded. Now is the time to take Port Hudson.

A.

Sent. "Are you Abbott?"

Received. "Numbers Jackson."

Captain ALDEN:

I hope to be at New Orleans last of the week. Order up the mortar-boats, the Essex, and Genesee. Shell Port Hudson every night at a different hour, for an hour or two, until the Hartford passes down.

FARRAGUT.

We will not communicate across the Point. Too much risk.

FARRAGUT.

McDermot killed at Sabine Pass, on shore at the light-house. Boat's crew taken. Read escaped with his boat's crew, himself wounded. Tell Porter that there are three steamboats up Thompson's Creek.
