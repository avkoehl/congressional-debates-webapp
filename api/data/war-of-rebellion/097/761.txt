HEADQUARTERS ARMIES OF THE UNITED STATES, Washington, April 15, 1865-7.30 p. m.

Major-General SHERIDAN,Burkeville:

The following is forwarded for your information:

RALEIGH, N. C., April 13, 1865.

General U. S. GRANT:

I entered Raleigh this morning. Johnston has retreated westward. I shall move to Asheville and Salisbury or Charlotte. I hope Sheridan is coming this way with his cavalry. If I can bring Johnston to a stand can soon fix him. The people here had not heard of the surrender of lee, and hardly credit it. All well.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS, April 15, 1865.

Major-General SHERIDAN:

I am afraid it is indeed true. Army headquarters asked City Point in reference to the genuineness of the dispatch and City Point replies it is reliable and has been since confirmed. It is too horrible to contemplate with composure.
