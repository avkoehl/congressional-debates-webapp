Mr ii.VA.NS did not intend to call thp Senator from Kentucky
toaccouot for nu course, but if the Senator did not vote foi
any appiopnation to carry on this building, or any other of the
public buildings did lie voie against such appropriations, and
rise in his place to make a single speech agamst their propriety?
If he did n )t, \t was now too Uto to oppose what he had sanc-
tioned by his silence
Mr CRiniSNDCtf contended that he was not accountable
to the Senator fiom Maine for what he did or did not vote for,
either now or five years ago, nor ¡or makmg, or not making,
a speech for or against any measure under discussion his re-
sponsibility wasdueelsewheie, and he was ready to meet it
But what he now did say, was, that he would not vote for the
proposition of theSenatoi from Maine to continue thisextrava
gant system of expenditure, by appropriating $100 000, m&tead
of é50,000, as recommended by the other branch o! Congie^
It was no argument with him to silence opposition toextia-
vaganf appropriations, by the outcry of being too late, and re
ptoach of not at the first making a speech against such woiks
Mr. CALHOUN considered that some explanation was re-
quisite with reference to the manner in which they had been
led on, from time to time, to incur this enormous expense It
appeared that theie never had been any official report made to
Congress upon tip subject, and those who undertook to com
píele the work paid not the elightestiegard to the appropriation
They bad be n going on from year to year, without looking
"back or examining the cost, and he now rose principally to
make thid single remark that they had no evidence whatever
to «how them that the $300,000, which it was now asserted
would be sufficient, would, in reality, be so It had been a
standing en or of Congress, fur many years past, to go on m
making appropriations for public works, without having certi-
fied estimates before them* If, then, there were no other
reason than the absence of any well grounded assurance
that it would be adequate, it would be quite sufWent, of
itself, to deter him lrom going beyond the apHropria
tion agreed to by the House, of fifty thousand dolUrs—for
the present, at all events Until he saw such evidence pro-
duced as would satisfy him upon this pomt¿ he would not go a
step beyond this He was not ready to admit the pi maple that
the public revenue derived fiom all parts oí the Union,
should be rashly and lavi&hly expended at one par icular
point, where the strongest possible interest existed to extend
the am ,>unt of that expenditure to the utmost limit practica jIp

Mr EVERETT    The report is, already in
Mr BRIGGS. Only one of them. They ought all to be

Mr LINN The other one has been called for by aresolution
of the 9th of Febi uary, but has not yet been received from the
Sccretaiy of she Treasury

Mi LVKKE1T    I object
Mi IÍÜJGGS     Then I move to suspend the rules
Mr THO\lP.-ON,of Mississippi, called for the reading of the
resolution, which having been again read—
The question on the mono í to suspend the nTes was then ta-
ken, and decided m iheaffirmauve, without a division
And the resolution being thu? beiore the House, and the ques
tion being on the adoption thereof—
Mr BfUGGS demanded the pievious question
Mr SAUNDERS rose to inquire of the Chair whether a reso
lution had not already been parsed calling for the reports
TheSPEAKERsaid he was not able to answer the question.
Mr LINN was understood to answer the question according
to the statement previously made by him
The SPEAKCR was then undeisiood to say that the Chair
was informul that acailhad been made on thesecretary of the
Treasury
Mr URIGGS was understood to say that the resolution was
laid over for debate
Mr esaUNUER-s desired to be informed by his colleague
[Mr Stanly] in what character his report came before the
House?   Wh ther m the character uf adeposition or-------
Mr STANLY That is another mattei, and when it comes
up m oider, I am fully prepaiedto an&wer it
The SPEAKER int rposedto order
And the question being then taken, [the demand for the
previous question having been overlooked,] the resolution was
adopted
Mr THOMPSON, of Indiana, a^ked leave to make a report
from the Committee for the Disti tct of Columbia
Mr COWEN did not wish to object, but his desire was that
the House, ii so disposed, should proceed at once to the consider-
ation of private business
Mr THOMPSON, of Indian*, aaid he would move a suspen
sion oí the íules
Some conversation followed, when amidst much confusion,
The SPEAKERsaid this conversation was all outof order ,
and he inquired of Mr Thompson whethei he insisted on his
motion to suspend the ruksl
Mr THOMPSON said, Yes, if objection was made to his
presenting the report
Mr WELLLR objected
Mi THOMPSON then summed '.is motion to suspend the
rules, which motion was decided in the negative
So the rules were not suspended
Mr COWEN moved that the ffouse proceed to the consid
eration of the piivaie calendar, (Mr Everett, chairman ofthe
Select Committee on the Apportionment oí Representatives,
havms i^'ima ed his will ngiess to give up the day t > pi ivate

Mi R bdid thathe halyesteiday madeamotioiio-econ^ider

Public Expenditures in relation ii the New \oil custom
house The Speaker had then decided ihe motion to be
out of oidei , and the appeal which he (Mr R ) had indi
Cdted his intention to take from the decision oi the Chair was
declared to be out of order, because tnere was a privileged mo-
tion pending
Theie being no such motion now pending, he presumed it
would now be mordei for him to make the motion to reconsider,
(ins being the last day on vhich it couid be done bv the rules )
with a view to take the sense of the House on the point of order,
if the Spbakjsk shouldsiilladheie to his opinion yesterday ex-
pressed

VELT and (OWEN—
iheSPLAKLR. intimated to Mi Roosevelt that this was
the proper time for him 'o make the mo ion if I e &o intended
Mr   ROOSEVELT said his motion was to r conaidu the
vote on the ieport made yesfeiday bv the (" v n tuttee on Pub-
liv, E\ pendí tine*, in relation to the New Y oik cu&tom house.
He did not make the motion on any mere tcchni a'uy, but be
cause he had been uncle      niaapprehension fiom thp stateme it
of ihi gentleman fiom Noith Carolina, (Mr ístanly )     He
(Mr R ) had not examined the contents o    he ieport, and sup
posed that it was a report fiom the commi rpeof us own m
ve3iigaaon^ on the affairs of the custom bou^-e      Such a report
he was as Willi g as any one to receive    He*"v &hed to suppress
nothing    His attention, however, had been called to the matter
by those who sat near him, and, on going into the Ctei k's office
and looking into the i epoi t, lie found tt to be ^ i eport ot one of
th*  ''ommi-^ioneis appointed to investigate the affairs of the
New York custom house
Mi BRIGGS l.eie interposed with the interrogitory, as the

Mr ROOSEVELT    I gave my assent to it
The SPEAKEK Thist3a matter for the House finally to
determine The Chair has no pride of opinion m it, but is gov
erned by what had oeen the uniform action of the House The
Chair could not find a « ngle instance in which a vote of this
ki 1 had DP<*n reconsideied At trie extra se«s'on such votea
had been reí U3ed on three ¿ifietent occasions, ard, according to
his recolfectto i, such had been the fixed deci&ien of forn er
Speakers The journal did not show an instance m whic*" a
vote tatcen suh wlentio oi where no division had taken place,
had, on the motion of snv o-enUemanvotin* either in the maiou-
ty or minority, been recon^ideied The Chair, there foi e, de-
cided that, the motion to reconsider could not heentertamed
Mr ROOSEVELT was proceeding to make some remaiks,
wh<m
M™ ARNOLD inquired if the gentleman appealed from the
decision ofthe Chair)
Tne SPEAKER said he understood the gentleman as ap-
pealing
taMr ROOSEVELT said he did appeal fiom the decision.
And the quesnon being on the appeal,
Mr R  briefly spoke m opposition to the dec sion of the
Chair
The SPEAKCR said he would state that the question *of re<
consi lei anon was a question gi iwmg enurt Iy out of the rulea
of this House Accoiding to ihe puiiamentary law, there was
no question of reconstdeiation It was und^r the following
rule alone that a motion to reconsider could be entertained
"Rale 51 When a motion has been once made and carried
m the affirmative or negative, it shal I be id order for any mem
bei ofthe rrujurrty to move for the reconsideration thereof on
the same or the succeeding day "
In the present case, there had been a unanimous vote, or at
least no division had taken place, no objeción had been made;
and, of course, in the judgment of the Chair, i o member, ac-
cording to the practice ofthe House, had a right to move a re-
consideration
In reply to the only argument urged by the gentleman from
NewYotk, [Mr Roosevclt ]thnt of the inconvenience of the
deciinoi—thatit would entorce on this Hou-*e an act, however
sti >ng a desire to reconsider it mijlu eiis t—that the House
would be deprived ofthe puvil^ge oí doing so, the Chair
woij] ¡suggest that there was an easy modes i getting rid of this
order wif ¡out a mo'ion to recon^idei It would be m order for
any Tember, under the sanction of the House, to move to re*
bcind this very order, thus reaching the object by a direct
means
Mr ROOSEVELT But a vote of two thirds would be re-
quired to enble me to introluce such a resolution
The SPEAKER I would nnlerthe r^Ie But the Chair
is ne rdy sugge&nng mreplvto he genteman's argumentas
tomconveme ice, that the d 'lieu iy can he met in adireC and
easy way, wnl out overrides the wt.ll se tied principles and
practice of this. House Arid the Cnair will state th.u he be-
lieves that the mem  ry ofthe ol lest memhei of this House can-
not -recur to a case in which a mouon to reconsider has, under
such encumsunces, b°en entertain d
Mi CUSHING biiefly opposed the decision of the Chair, on
the ground oí convenience and principle, t"oth of which, 'ie
coatended, i equned tnat th<* decision of the Chair should be re-
versed    And on the appeal hedsked the yeas snd nays
Mi ARNOLD thought the decision ofthe Chair wrong in
principle, and hoped that his friends on this floor would not op-
pose the reconsidera ion
Mr A then alluded to an effort which he said was making to
prevent the printing of the report

Mr EVERE1T «aid time was pi ecious, and, as the shortest
way of getting rid of the ^jjject, lie would move that the appeal
belaid on the ta^le
Mr PitOrFIT and Mi WELLER demanded the yeas and
nay on thai aiotior
Whereupon the SPEAKER caid that this seemed to be a
question of son c eeling, and, probably, involving much inter-
est The Chair had not had time to look m'o the report, but
no injuty could b° done to any side of the Hou*e by taking the
quesfioti whethei the printing should bedone or not TheChair,
therefore would receive the motion to reconsider
fSr T\ LRETT inquiied what then became of his motion to
la>   ie appeal on the table?
fie SPLAKER said it full to the ground, the Speaker having
withmawn his decision
And the q ie& iop now being on the motion to reconsider—
Mi RO >SEVELT explained the reason why he had made
the mo(ion foi reconM leration After the vote to print hearing
that tne repor. *as veiy voluminous,and finding that there had
been, with otneis as well as him^lt, a misapprehension as to
what its nature was, he had gone into thp Clerk's office and
examined the document, which he found to be, not the report of
the Committee on Public Expenditures, nor of the board of
commissioner  to n/e ¡gate the condition of the New York
custom hoii^e but a voluminous ma^s of wntmg by an indi-
vidual not now a member ofthe Hoi^e, oi even an officer
of the President, accompanied, by way of preface with a sin-
gle V oe from the commii'ep a=> a letter of introduction He
t oQtended tint the teport ought first to have been submitted to
th*1 Executive, and not given ti a committee of the House to
adopt as if it \\ ere 'heir own It rm^M be veiy proper that the
facti in the -cpor' bhuuld be made public, but it was a docu-
ment for which the committee were not responsible, and it
ouoht nit ro be pnn ^1 un kr the sanction of the House The
House had already wiled oi the I xecntne for a communica
tion ofthe report oí the boaid of commissioners, and, no doubt,
in due time the Executive would cornnunioa'e H, or would as
sign reason-; fjr not doirg so Mr R could not bring his mind
to believe th*' the Presideitwomd desire to wi hhol ¡any proper
infoiirution from the Hot? e He hoped the vote would be re-
cons dered, and that th Iloj^e w uld either §ret the document
m a proper and regular mai ner, or get the reasons of the Ex-
ecutive fir no' conmumcatmg it
Mr CUSflING said that U woull appear, fro-n an examina-
tion of thi« wport, that it had not b^en presented to the depart-
ment until the20'h of this. m n Ii, it had, indeed, been given m
on ihe 12th but had been withdiawn '•^in for some reason,
and not asam presented till the 20th It was a document of 400

time for the Secietary and President to do moiethan read it
