RICHMOND, VA., July 9, 1864.

Major General W. H. C. WHITING,

Wilmington, N. C.:

GENERAL: Your letter* of 4th instant has been received, and at your request laid before the President. I am directed by the Adjutant and Inspector General, after a conference he has had with the President, to say to you in reply that it is not possible when the enemy are sorely pressing us upon every quarter to send re-enforcements for the defense of Wilmington. The President relies confidently upon your resolution and ability to drive off any force the enemy may be able at this juncture, when every effort for the capture of Charleston is being made, to bring against the place.

Very respectfully, general, your obedient servant,

H. L. CLAY,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

WILMINGTON, July 9, 1864.

President DAVIS:

Following dispatch to General Whiting just received from ordnance officer at Columbia, July 8:

Two thousand rifles left here yesterday morning for Captain Wilkinson, C. S. Army. Colonel Gorgas has just ordered 1,400 to be sent back. I send messenger for them.

The number ordered, with what we can get from General Whiting, is little enough, and I request that we may be allowed to have them.

G. W. C. LEE,

Colonel and Aide-de-Camp.

WILMINGTON, July 9, 1864.

President DAVIS:

The arms ordered from Columbia have not yet arrived. I suppose they have been stopped by messenger referred to in dispatch of this morning. General Whiting is making every effort to get them, and will give us the 1,600 Austrian rifles that he has, but they are not of a desirable caliber for our purpose; have not accouterments, and are not sufficient in number.

G. W. C. LEE,

Colonel and Aide-de-Camp.

WILMINGTON, July 9, 1864.

President DAVIS:

Will try and get out to-night. Am badly off for officers, but hope for the best. I request that you will not act on Wilkinson's case until I see you.

J. TAYLOR WOOD,

Confederate States Navy.
