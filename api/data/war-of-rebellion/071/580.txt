WASHINGTON, August 2, 1864--12. 40 a. m.

Major-General COUCH,

Pittsburg, Pa.:

I have no information later than that from General Averell. These accounts indicate that only a small force of rebels is north of the Potomac.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.

PITTSBURG, PA., August 2, 1864--8. 30 p. m.

(Received 10. 50 p. m.)

Major General H. W. HALLECK:

The line to Cumberland is open, but I can't get anything from General Kelley. Scouts near there last evening report a very large force of cavalry in the vicinity, and that Kelley had sent his teams and led horses to Berlin, which is southwest of Bedford. Very likely that McCausland has not gone into Virginia as yet. Fifty scouts have been sent to Uniontown by rail to go into Virginia. Averell reported at 9 a. m. from Hancock, via McConnellsburg, no enemy north of Potomac from that place to Falling Waters.

D. N. COUCH,

Major-General.

PITTSBURG, PA., August 2, 1864--9. 40 p. m.

(Received 11 p. m.)

Major-General HALLECK:

Scouts from Somerset say McCausland beaten by Kelley at Cumberland. Former retreating, Kelley following, and Averell in enemy's front. No enemy in vicinity of Romney.

D. N. COUCH,

Major-General.
