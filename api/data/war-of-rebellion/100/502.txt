Brevet Major-General KILPATRICK,

Commanding Cavalry, Lexington, N. C.:

I find it is necessary to have a regiment of cavalry at hand for the purpose of supplying small detachments to go into the country at distances too great for infantry. I will be obliged to you if you will order the regiment above here on the Danville road to report to me, to be encamped near town for that purpose. Please answer.

Bvt. Major General J. KILPATRICK,

Commanding Cavalry, Lexington, N. C.:

The following is received from General Cooper, commanding at Salisbury:

I have received information that gangs of guerrillas are committing depredations in Wilkes County, and the citizens are very anxious to be protected there and in the adjoming counties. I will send sand organize the home guard in Lenoir County, but think cavalry could go more easily from Lexington to Wilkes County than to have men sent from here. I think some troops should be sent there at once.

J. A. COOPER,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

The general commanding desires that you send some cavalry to the counties indicated to keep the peace.

THEO. COX,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Assistant Adjutant-General.
