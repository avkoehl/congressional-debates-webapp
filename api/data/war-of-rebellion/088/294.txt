HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,August 19, 1864-11 a. m.

General GRANT:

Parke will be able to send Warren all his white troops, amounting to 6,000. This will be ample for all Warren's purposes, unless the enemy re-enforce strongly from their troops now north of the James. I have directed Warren to intrench himself strongly and to connect, if possible, with the left of the Ninth corps; also, if practicable, to push the enemy back to their works around Petersburg, they being now, as I understand it, over a mile or more outside of these works.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,August 19, 1864-12.15 p. m.

General GRANT:

I send dispatch just received from Warren*. I am going to see him. The telegraph now runs to his headquarters.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,August 19, 1864-8 p. m.

General GRANT:

I left Warren's at 4 p. m. All quiet. At 4.30 the enemy drove in the picket-line he had established connecting with our works on the Jerusalem plank road, and, turning his right flank, interposed their masses between Warren and Parke. Warren immediately attacked them, and after a severe fight drove them back and re-established his lines. I send you his dispatch,+ just received. The roads are in a very back condition, and if it continues to rain there will be trouble in supplying Warren.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.

CITY POINT, August 19, 1864-9.30 p. m.

Major-General MEADE:

Your dispatch of 8 p. m. just received. I am pleased to see the promptness with General Warren attacked the enemy when he came out. I hope he will not hesitate in such cases to abandon his line and take every man to fight every battle, and trust to regaining them afterward or to getting better. The enemy must have left their line guarded by a single division.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
