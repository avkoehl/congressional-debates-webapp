Brigadier-General GARRARD,Commanding Second Cavalry Division:

The general commanding desires me to inform you that he made a demonstration upon the enemy's right at daylight this morning. He struck the rebel cavalry and the right of the rebel infantry line and took 8 infantrymen prisoners. They belonged to Strahl's brigade. From them it was learned that Ferguson's cavalry brigade left the right of the rebel line at daylight yesterday morning to move after Kilpatrick, and that the only cavalry now left there are new Georgia troops. This cavalry run at almost an easy matter for Millers' brigade to strike and disperse this force.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. S. FULLERTON,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
