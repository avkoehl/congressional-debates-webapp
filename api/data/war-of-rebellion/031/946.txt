Major-General BURNSIDE, Falmouth, Va.,:

General Kelley is of the opinion that a large force of the enemy is moving on Winchester. I will telegraph you again when I hear from Heintzelman's scouts.

General-in-Chief.

BALTIMORE, MD. January 5, 1863

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.

The following dispatch has been received from General Kelley:

HARPER'S FERRY, W. VA., January 4, 1863

Colonel WILLIAM D. WHIPPLE,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Baltimore:

A dispatch just received from General Milroy advises me that he anticipates an attack soon. I have no doubt that the enemy will make a powerful effort to prevent the working of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, and to drive us out of the valley.

The following is an extract from General Milroy's dispatch; "I have reason to believe, from information received from various sources, that an attack in heavy force will be made on this place soon."

B. F. KELLEY,

Brigadier-General.

General Milroya is at Winchester. Can I promise General Kelley any support from General Heintzelman, or the Army of the Potomac, in that direction?

Major-General, Commanding.

Have you any further information from Harper's Ferry or Winchester? Any re-enforcements sent from here should go by railroad.

Your telegram received last night.

The wire has been cut during the night. I cannot hear
