The great grain-producing States of the
central West, are Ohio, Indiana, Illinois,
Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Iowa,
with probably a population of eleven millions.
In the year 1865 the grain product of the
United States was 1,343,027,868 bushels,
valued at $1,118,904,376. "Of this, the pro-
duct of wheat was, 151,999,906 ; and of corn,
867,946,295 bushels; the rest in oats, barley,
rye, &c. In the year 1868 the wheat product
was two hundred and twenty-four million
bushels, of which thirty two million were used
for seed, one hundred and sixty-four million
consumed in the United States, and twenty-
eight million exported. The grain-producing
States of the southeastern West are Kentucky,
Tennessee, and West Virginia; and those
of the extreme West, with the Territories, are
Missouri, Kansas, Nebraska, Montana, and
Colorado, and Dakota Territory, and Ark-
ansas in the Southwest. The area embraced
in these seventeen States and Territories is,
as yet, only under partial cultivation, for there
is only at the present time embraced in them
somewhere in the neighborhood of twelve or
thirteen inhabitants to each square mile. The
areas of land awaiting cultivation in the States
which now produce more grain than they con-
sume, are as follows:

The average fertility of soil m these coun-
tries is not greater than that embraced in our
States and Territories, and in the general
123
course of nature the latter will assimilate, in
point of numbers to the old countries across
the sea. Through statistics based on the in-
crease of the past, the probabilities are that
the young people of to-day will live to see a
population of one hundred and twenty mil-
lions in these seventeen States and Territories;
that is to say, in the year 1940. There are
between two and three million square miles
in this great central plftin of fertile soil, whose
capacities are only partially known, and which,
nevertheless, furnishes a product greater than
any other land. From its center, it is one
thousand miles nearer to the Atlantic than to
the Pacific, and its products must naturally
look to the Bast for an outlet, even if nature
had not placed such a barrier as the Rocky
mountains between the two oceans. As it is,
from the foot of the Alleghanies to the base
of the Rocky mountains, the surplus products
of the soil are destined to move to the Bast,
and to some extent to the South.
To narrow down this immense area to one
within it, where statistics have been more
accessible and consequently better prepared—
I mean the country comprised in the States of
Ohio, Kentucky, Indiana, Illinois, Missouri,
Kansas, Nebraska, Iowa, Minnesota, Wiscon-
sin, Michigan, and the Territory of Dakota—
we find that these eleven States and one Terri-
tory produce more than three fourths of all the
cereals and other farm products of the_ entire
country. We learn from reliable statistics that
they produced, in 1871,193,876,300 bushels of
wheat, 919,348,060 bushels of corn, 19,887,686
hogs, 11,745,668 cattle, and 31,441,736 sheep.
In 1872 they produced 225,000,000 bushels of
wheat to 86,383,000 bushels raised in all the
other States ; that is to say, about two thirds
of the whole quantity produced. And this is
only a small part of their productive power,
for not one sixth of the soil is cultivated.
Considering the heavier weight of the hogs
in this region, these eleven States and one
Territory raise about three fourths of all the
pork, bacon, and lard of the country. They
possess about three fifths of all the sheep in
the Union; and allowing one and a half pounds
of wool to the head, they furnish, compared
to the other parts of the country, about the
same proportion of wool. The probabilities
are that the five great staples of this region
in 1880, at the rate of ten per cant, increase,
will amount to over five hundred million
bushels of wheat, nearly twenty-six hundred
million bushels of corn, nearly forty-two million
head of hogs, over twenty-five million of cattle,
and sixty-seven million of sheep, giving over
one hundred million pounds of wool. In fact,
as far as material prospects are concerned, no
region ever had a more brilliant destiny to
fulfill than this one.
To exhibit the pecuniary value of the agri-
cultural fruits of the labor of the toiling yeo-
maury of the West to the citizens of the older
States, in which the productions of wheat and
corn have declined since 1860, I refer to the fol-
lowing table, in which the names of the States
are given and the deficiencies enumerated:

The six New England States are obliged to
purchase, in round numbers, one hundred
million bushels of grain. Massachusetts pro-
duces just bread enough for breakfast and
dinner of each day ; Connecticut a supply for
two days; New Hampshire only for ten days ;
Maine sufficient to last for eleven days; Ver-
mont about enough to furnish her people
bread for thirty-seven days; Rhode Island
scarcely any wheat. This is computing the
consumption of bread on the basis of the
Army rations', namely, twenty-two ounces of
flour for each person per day.
Enlarged channels of intercommunication
are matters of immense account to the States
favored with great mineral wealth, especially
those which have been advancing at a steady
gait and grandeur through the stimulus of pro-
tection. A perennial stream of commerce
flows from the manufactories of the old States

The mining production which, in 1860, was
included in the total of manufactures, is, in
1870, treated separately,and amounted to $152,-
698,994.
The proportion of this increase ot one hun-
dred and eight per cent, in the manufacturing
production is due in part to enhancement of
prices; but to raise enormous quantities of
breadstuffs and create large stores of other
products is only one of the primary condi-
tions of success, and the guarantee of the
basis of a common interest. These articles
must be carried cheaply to the best mar-
kets. That this is a sweeping national ques-
tion no one disputes. That the present
means of transportation are inadequate, even,
the owners of railways do not pretend to
maintain the contrary. The region I have
just referred to can easily send three fifths of
its productions to market, retaining the re-
maining two fifths for home consumption.
It is stated that in 1860 there were eighteen
million tons of produce to spare from the
the West, not half of which went off, either
through the exorbitant rates of freight de-
manded or insufficient means of transporta-
tion. It is believed by those who have made
