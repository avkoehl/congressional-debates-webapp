Major General F. P. Blair, commanding Seventeenth Army Corps, will diminish his command to one line also, not holding more than one brigade as a reserve, relieving a portion of General Logan's left.

Major General John A. Logan, commanding Fifteenth Army Corps, will then complete his line of works to his right. The object being to extend the line as far as possible to the right, the intrenchments will be made strong and ground cleared well to the front. Corps commanders will report the execution of this order of the completion of their line.
