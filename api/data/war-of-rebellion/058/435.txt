HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND, Chattanooga, Tenn., February 20, 1864.

Major General JOHN M. PALMER,Commanding Reconnoitering Force, Chattanooga:

The major-general commanding the department directs that you make a reconnaissance in the direction of Dalton for the purpose of ascertaining, as far as practicable, the strength and position of the enemy at that place, Tunnel Hill, and along the line of the railroad from Dalton as far as Resaca, and should the enemy retire, to gain as much ground to your front as possible.

You will use for this purpose the troops now under your command, the First Division, Fourth Corps, commanded by Brigadier General Charles Cruft, and the cavalry under command of Colonel W. P. Boone, both of which officers have been ordered to report to you. You will direct Colonel Boone to move out on the La Fayette road as far as Rock Spring, for the purpose of ascertaining whether or not that place is occupied by rebel cavalry, and, if so, and considered practicable, to attack and disperse them. Having accomplished his mission at that point, you will give Colonel Boone such orders as circumstances may require. Colonel W. J. Palmer, commanding Fifteenth Pennsylvania Cavalry, will accompany and act with Colonel Boone as far as Rock Spring, from which point he will continue and make a reconnaissance through La Fayette, Broomtown Valley, and the head of McLemore's Cove.

You will start on this reconnaissance not later than Monday morning, the 22nd instant. Colonel T. J. Harrison, commanding Thirty-ninth Regiment Indiana Mounted Infantry, will be ordered to report to you for the purpose of keeping up the communication between General Cruft and your main force.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WM. D. WHIPPLE,

Brigadier-General and Assistant Adjutant-General.
