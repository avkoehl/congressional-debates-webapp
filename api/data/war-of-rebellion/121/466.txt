Bvt. Brigadier General W. P. RICHARDSON,

Commanding Camp Chase, Columbus, Ohio:

GENERAL: From the records of this office it appears that the prisoners named on the accompanying roll, who were captured by the forces of Major-General Steele in the Department of Arkansas prior to July 28, 1864, are still at Camp Chase, and the Commissary-General of Prisoners directs that immediately on the receipt of this you will please forward all of them, or as many as are present who desire to be exchanged, to Cairo, to be delivered to the commanding officer, who will be instructed to forward them with other prisoners of the same class to New Orleans for exchange. Return the inclosed roll to this office with a note opposite the nameof eachman showing whether he has been forwarded, or what disposition has been made of him. It is probable that some of thesemen have already been forwarded for exchange, have been discharged, or have died.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. T. HARTZ,

Captain and Assistant Adjutant-General.
