General WILLIAMS:

I have nothing of importance on my line to report. Fresh abatis has been prepared and will be put down to-night. During last night it is reported the enemy were heard moving artillery to their right. My signal officer reports as follows:

Major-General BURNSIDE:

GENERAL: From 3 until 5.30 p. m. two different columns of dust appeared over the city, both moving in direction of the enemy's right. A regiment of infantry also moved toward evening from camp near plank road in direction of earth-work opposite our extreme left. Condition of the atmosphere since 3 p. m. prevented a more distinct observation of these movements, which might have been made. Nothing else-where visible.
