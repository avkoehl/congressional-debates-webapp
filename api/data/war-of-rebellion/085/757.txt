SAINT LOUIS, October 10, 1864-11.15 a. m.

Captain MAYO,

Commanding, Glasgow:

Press steam-boats, and don't let any pass up. If any arrive show the commanding officer this order, and say that General Rosecrans directs him to return and report to General Pleasonton.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.

SAINT LOUIS, October 10, 1864-11.15 a. m.

Major-General PLEASONTON:

I have sent you word not to send troops up to Lexington, nor [any] force to Boonville, until you are certain the rebels have gone south or west, beyond striking distance. Bring back those you have sent up.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.

JEFFERSON CITY, October 10, 1864.

Major-General ROSECRANS:

General Fisk, with two regiments of infantry and two pieces of artillery, left by boat for Lexington yesterday. Colonel Switzler's regiment and four pieces of artillery left by boat this morning for Boonville. Price passed through California on the way to Boonville yesterday morning, hard pressed by General Sanborn. He left 300 horses behind which I shall send out for. Price is getting short of artillery ammunition. I have furnished Sanborn all I am able to. Please bring up some 3-inch ammunition. Have heard nothing of General Smith's or Mower's commands. Their cavalry could be of the greatest service with Sanborn just now. He has about 3,000 men. Shall do the best possible to save Lexington and Boonville.

A. PLEASONTON,

Major-General, Commanding.

JEFFERSON CITY, October 10, 1864.

Major-General ROSECRANS:

Your dispatch of 9th via Mexico is just received. I have retained all the troops I found here. I have relieved General McNeil and placed all the cavalry available under General Sanborn, as the most of it was his. I considered him the best officer for that service. He has already done very well. Price will be at Boonville to-night, and unless Generals Smith's and Mower's cavalry arrive here to-night, they will be too far behind to be of much service. I have heard nothing as yet from their cavalry. With the troops sent to Lexington and Boonville and Sanborn's command, this place is stripped, and some other troops should be sent here to hold. There is no telegraph to General Curtis from here. I will endeavor to send your dispatch to him by hand. It will be some time getting there. If the express boat comes here I will try to send it up to Leavenworth.

A. PLEASONTON,

Major-General, Commanding.
