they commenced to evacuate. My skirmishers, sent forward to feel their position, met with little resistance, and at midnight the whole work was in our possession. Our captures amount to 4 flags, 46 pieces of artillery, large and small including three 7-inch Brookes in the water battery, and two 8-inch columbiads in front, 700 small-arms, and 540 prisoners, including 20 officers, and a large amount of ammunition. Twenty-six of the enemy's dead were buried on the field by my men this morning.

I cannot commend too highly the conduct of the officers and soldiers of my division during this trying, dangerous, and laborious siege. The men were all on duty at least once in twenty-four hours. On one occasion the officers and non-commissioned officers of a brigade held the trenches during the day while the men slept. It will not be improper for me to mention especially my brigade commanders, Colonel James L. Geddes, Eighth Iowa Infantry, commanding Third Brigade; Colonel Jonathan B. Moore, Thirty-third Wisconsin Infantry, commanding Second Brigade. Colonel Moore and his brigade were distinguished during the siege for the siege for the energy and intelligence which they displayed in pushing the approaches, and for their promptness in supporting Colonel Geddes' assault. Lieutenant Henry Vineyard, Company G, Eighth Iowa Volunteers, was especially distinguished as leading the charge of his regiment and is dangerously wounded in the thigh and arm. My loss during the whole siege is 29 killed, 195 wounded, and 1 missing, including 7 killed and 19 wounded in the assault.* My staff officers all behaved with gallantry and showed the utmost energy and perseverance. Their names are Lieutenant Colonel W. R. Lackland, One hundred and eighth Illinois Infantry, picket officer, distinguished for leading his regiment, musket in hand, on the day of investment and on the day of the capture; Major C. B. Loop, acting assistant inspector-general; Captain Bluford Wilson, assistant adjutant-general who is a most gallant and energetic officer, and acted as aide to Colonel Geddes during the assault; Captain W. L. Scott, Thirty-third Wisconsin Volunteers, acting assistant inspector-general; Captain H. M. Bush, Ninety-fifth Illinois Volunteers, assistant commissary of musters; Captain E. Morgan, jr., Seventy-second Illinois Volunteers, provost-marshal; Captain A. Geddes, Eighth Iowa Volunteers, acting aide-de-camp; Lieutenant Charles A. Harms, Forty-third Illinois Volunteers, aide-de-camp; Lieutenant W. B. Walker, Ninety-fifth Illinois Volunteers, aide-de-camp; Surg. E. Powell, Seventy second Illinois Volunteers, surgeon-in-chief; Captain J. P. Reese, commanding pioneers. Captain H. L. Wheeler, Ninety-sixth U. S. Colored Infantry, acting engineer officer, displayed great energy, pertinacity, and untiring industry. I would also mention Bvt. Captain C. J. Allen, U. S. Engineers,on General Smith's staff, acting chief engineer for the corps; Captain J. G. Patton, acting engineer and acting assistant inspector-general military division; Major Connelly and Captain Hendricks, First Indiana Heavy Artillery; Captain Craig, Sixth Michigan Heavy Artillery; Captain Blankenship, First Indiana Heavy Artillery,commanding mortar batteries, and Captain Gillis, U. S. Navy, all for rendering great assistance in constructing and working batteries in my front.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

E. A. CARR,

Brigadier-General.
