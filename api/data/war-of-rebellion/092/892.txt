OCONEE, November 24, 1864.

Major - General McLAWS:

Enemy sent up a rocket last night and opened heavily again at daybreak this morning and still at it. Am nearly out of 54, only twenty-five rounds to the man left. Send me up ammunition, and, if possible, 1,000 men.

WAYNE,

Major - General.

OCONEE, November 24, 1864.

Major - General McLAWS:

I am again attacked at Ball's ferry in force. Do send me ammunition; I am nearly out.

Major - General.

OCONEE, November 24, 1864 - 8. 55 p. m.

Major - General McLAWS:

I have held the bridge to the last extremity. The enemy have succeeded in setting fire to the trestle-work on the other end of the bridge; it is burning slowly. We still hold this side, and shall continue to hold it until driven back. The enemy are in heavy force on the other side. I believe I have more than Kilpatrick's division in front of me. Wheeler has not yet come up.

H. C. WAYNE,

Major - General.

OCONEE BRIDGE, November 24, 1864.

Major - General McLAWS:

Major Hall reports to me that the enemy are on the Linton road to Tennille, fifteen miles off.

Major - General.

OCONEE, November 24, 1864.

Captain R. W. B. ELLIOTT,

Assistant Adjutant - General:

The force of the enemy is, in my opinion, exaggerated. I do not think there are more than 800 men. Major Hall, at Numbers 13, reports the enemy seen fifteen miles on the other side of Buffalo Creek, the bridges over which are all destroyed, but they may force a passage. Sharpshooters of the enemy on this side of the river, and ours on the other, firing on each other.

A. L. HARTRIDGE,

Major, &amp;c.
