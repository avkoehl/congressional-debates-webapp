Mr. WAKEMAN. This is one of the four
cases referred to by the chairman of the com-

and the payment of this pension is made pay-
able out of the naval pension fund, which I
am told amounts to over thirteen million
dollars, set apart for the payment of naval
pensions. This is a widow in destitute cir-
cumstances. She is now, it is true, receiving
thirty dollars a month. This naval fund is
made up out of prize-money, and this is one
of the cases where the committee think the
pension ought to be increased, her husband
Slaving served so long a time.
