[Mr. BaciLniN presented the petition and papers
of General Walter .Tones, in relation to his claims
against the United States.
Mr BeuLDiN said that he would briefly state the
content? of this petition This was common, and
according to the rule, Jbut m this case it seemed to
him to be strikingly necessary No doubt he said,
there were those who knew the fact, that General
Jones stood indebted to the United States,, by judg
ment confessed, for a large sum of money, which
judgment stood still not discharged To such it
w ould naturally be a surprise to be informed that
he claimed to be a creditor, and not a debtor on a
settlement
Mr Bottom said it was easily and naturally
explained. The judgement was confessed fot
$10,000 to be discharged by payment of $4,629 13Í,
with interest and cost'', subject to a credit of all
and any sums that General Jones could make ap-
pear to be due him from the United States, on ac-
count before the proper accounting officer* of the
Government.be uithm the term of six month-!
This he faded to do m proper form, in propel time,
and so has íeceived neither a credit on thejndg
msnt nor payment of the account, and has failed
until now to state his accounts with such particu-
larity, lhat they could be audited The account-
ing officers having neglected his accounts lmg
since, not for ihis want of justice, but for iheir
want of form, and want of legal ptoof produced,
although that prool was then, and 11, still mailer of
record entirely, appearing by the report ot the
Auditor, now presented Thus has it h ippened, as
it does but too often happen, that through negli-
gence ot pecuniary interest genius pays a ta\ foi
its high distinctions, and consentís rectitude, disre
gardmg form, fnicK itself somen hit embarrassed
in appearance, for the want of those baruers, «huh
greater utcunispection, giowm? onto! conscious
weakness upon that point, might have so easily
thrown «iroutid it.
There aie few, however, if any, whose gemuc
cin bettei bear the tax, nor are theie any «hose
character for honor and honesiy will mou eisily
and certainly relieve them lrom the embairasMiun'
of thus being ¡or a long time the apparent debttr ol
the Government, all the while bemg m fact the
creditor.
This may appear strange to tho«e not acquainted
with Gencial Jones, but to (hose acquainted with
him there is nothing remarkable m it at all
