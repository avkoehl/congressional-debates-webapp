Major FRANK S. BOND,

Jefferson City:

Major Majors is a rebel recruiting officer; has been recruiting for some time in Monroe County; said to have recruited 1,500 men besides the force with which he captured Paris; there are numerous small bands all over the country who will be flocking to him. Telegraphic communication with Macon has been cut off for twenty-four hours, and I have no news from Macon. I learn that the militia at Wellsville killed 15 of Anderson's men yesterday. No other news.
