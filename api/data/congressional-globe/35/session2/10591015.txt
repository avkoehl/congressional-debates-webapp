of the free list; and it is very doubtful if, with all
that, you could raise, for the next year, as much
as would be necessary to meet this extraordinary
expenditure.
Well, Mr. President, if it be impossible to ac-
complish the purpose of squaring our revenues
and expenditures in that mode, is there no other
manner m which we can accomplish it? Let us
lopk to the estimates of expenditure; and I think
when we come to analyze them, we shall find that
we can reduce those expenditures so as to bring
them within the probable means of the Govern-
ment. The Senator from Georgia remarked on
the very unusual fact that the Secretary of the
Treasury argued that we should expend the whole
of the outstanding balances, to wit: $12,000,000.
He showed by reference to past history that this
had never been done before; on the contrary, that,
taking any two years, the amount remaining out-
standing one year was about equal to what re-
mained outstanding the year before; and proceed-
ing upon the same estimate, and adopting the same
usage, I do not see why there might not be a
reduction of the estimates full $12,000,000;
$12,000,000 deducted from $73,000,000 would
leave $61,000,000; and if you must add to that the
expected Post Office deficiency of nearly §4,000,000
it would raise the appropriations to $05,000,000.
Now, sir, on analyzing the estimates, I think
it may be done. Let us take the estimates of the
War Department. The War Department esti-
mates that it will want an annual appropriation,
together wi th the permanent appropriations which
it will use, of $20,577,456; that it will want of the
outstanding appropriations $3,361,000; " because
the existing appropriations, part of whicii are
required«for the payment of the liabilities of the
present fiscal year, but which will not be drawn
from the Treasury until after June 30, 1859, and
the balance applied to the revenues of the fiscal
year, ending June 30, 1860, will be §3,361,000."
Now, is it not obvious that if, during this fiscal
year, liabilities are incurred to the amount of
§3,361,000, which are not to be paid until the next
fiscal year, during the next fiscal year there will
probably accrue the same amount of liabilities to
be paid "in the year which succeeds; so that there
will be as much left unexpended of the present
appropriations during the next fiscal year, as will
be left unexpended during the present fiscal year
to be paid out of the next. It is plain that this
must be so; and that the Secretary of the Treas-
ury has either estimated too much or too little.
Jf the same amount of„appropnations are left un-
expended for the next fiscal year that are left this,
then he has estimated too much in supposing
that we shall expend $12,000,000. If, on the
other hand, we are to expend the whole of the
|12,00U,000—as it is obvious that there must bo,
in the nature of things, liabilities in the next year
which will not be paid until the succeeding year—
then he has not estimated enough, because there
will be a deficiency fully to that amount.
I say, therefore, that we may fairly, in my
opinion, assume the responsibility of legislating
upon the. position that there is as much to be left
of the appropriations unexpended in the next fis-
cal year, as will be left in this; and indeed, when
we come to look at the amounts, I cannot but
think that that is what was intended by the esti-
mate of the Secretary of War. The whole ex-
penditures of that Department (pr the last year,
which included the expenditures for the Mormon
expedition, were $25,485,000.^ Now, the esti-
mates for the next year, in which we ought not
to have near so many expenses, are $20,577,000.
1 have been informed by the head of the quarter-
master's department that it is probable we shall
be able to cut down those appropriations some-
what, because the wars in Oregon and Washing-
ton are at an end. But is not $20,577,000 enough
for the War Department to expend in the next
fiscal year? And why might we not say, in the bill
appropriating this money, that no more shall be
expended in the next fiscal year than it is esti-
mated he will want of annual appropriations, and
out of the permanent appropriations > If we did
this, it would be necessary, for that year, to allow
him unlimited discretion in transferring from one
head of appropriation to another—that is, of the
appropriations contained within that blii.
Now let us look at the Navy Department. The
N.tvy Department last year expended $13,680,000.
The estimates this year are $13,500,000, and
#3,243,000 out of outstanding appropriations for
this year to be expended in the next. Why can-
not we say, in the bill, "you may expend what
you spent last year, and.no more; pay the liabil-
ities that occur this fiscal year out of those out-
standing appropriations of the next; but diminish
your expenditures under these others, so that
there may be the same amount to transfer to the
succeeding fiscal year."
Mr. FESSENDEN, Will my friend allow
me to interrupt him ? I do not exactly under-
stand him. 1 wish to ask a question for infor-
mation as he goes on. I understand that he de-
ducts, in the first place, from $73,000,000, or
$75,000,000, all the amount of appropriations on
hand;that is, the unexpended balances. He takes
them as a deduction and thus reduces the esti-
mate to $61,000,000, or $63,000,000. Does he now
propose, to take in detail the several items which
make up that amount, and reduct those also ?
Mr. HUNTER. I will explain. I stated first
that $12,000,000 might be deducted, because it
hp.d been the habit to leave as. much unexpended
in one year as had been unexpended in the year
before; and in order to prove that it might be
$12,000,000, I take the estimates in detail, and
show how m each appropriation you may cutoff
such an amount, that by adding the whole to-
gether, you get the whole $12,000,000.
Mr. FESSENDEN. Then the Senator is
merely endeavoring to prove the first proposi-
tion.
Mr. HUNTER. I am merely endeavoring to
prove my first proposition. Now, sir, for the
civil list: we expended last year on the civil list,
exclusive of the public debt, $36,387,000. This
year the Secretary of the Treasury, who seems to
have made large deductions, proposes something
like $19,000,000, exclusive of outstanding apprp-
| priations, of which he wants to use $4,270,000.
Here, again, it seems to me,the rule applies. The
same liabilities will occur in the next fiscal year,
to be paid m the succeeding year, that occur in
this; but, if I have doubt in regard to any of them,
it is hi regard to these; because here the largest,
reduction has been made. When you come to the
Interior Department there is a simple cutting down
of expenditures from $6,021,000 to $4,096,000, and
no application there to use outstanding balances.
If, then, we add these several sums, they will
constitute $12,000,000, to be deducted from the es-
timate of $73,000,000; and if you allSw the Post Of-
fice Department a deficiency of nearly $4,000,000,
you will raise the whole amount required to
$65,000,000. If you raise it up to $65,000,000, it
is allowing the Post Office Department to Expend
m'ore than $9,000,000 above its revenue from post-
age. If you reduce it to $61,000,000, it is allowing
the Post Office Department to expend $6,000,000
above its levcnue. Why cannot we declare, in
the Post Office bill, to put some restraint on him,
that the Postmaster General shall use only the
$6,000,000 out of the Treasury, and cut off be-
tween $3,000,000 and $4,000,000? If we did that,
it would be some practical limit upon his discre-
tion.
But let me go further, sir. Why cannot we
make it a self-sustaining institution, and cut off
the $6,000,000 which it draws from the Treas-
ury? and if we did, it would reduce our annual
expendituies to $55,000,000 or $56,000,000. I
knoiv that it is said by my friend from Pennsyl-
vania, [Mr. Bigler,] that he is unwilling to in-
crease the postage, because, under our present
mail service, the North pays more than its share;
and, in order to sustain himself m that proposition,
he credits New York and Philadelphia with all
the amounts of prepaid postage which they re-
ceived. Why, does noteverybody know that the
New York merchant and man of business charges'
his customers with the postages;"that, m reality,
they are paid by them; and that, so far as that is
concerned, the effect of the arrangement i^ to give
to New York all the benefit of the patronage aris-
ing out of the management of this revenue, in-
stead of charging it with the excess which is sup-
posed? The same I may say in regard to Penn-
sylvania. I ask, where is the justice of making
the man who does not receive letters and papers,
pay for the man who does? Where is the justice
of taxing that man so as to make his hue and
ax and his blanket and his coat cost him more
than they should do, in order to enable ihose who
receive letters and papeis, to receive them at loss
than they ought to pay ? Whatever class there
may be in this country, which is benefited by a
special service of the "Government, should pay
the expenses of that strvice of which they are
the sole recipients.
If then, Mr. President, you were, to make the
Post Office self-sustaining, were to make the De-
partment pay its own expenses "out of its reve-
nues, we should be able to reduce the expenditures
of the Government, I believe, to $55,000,000 or
$60,000,000. A bill has. been reported from the
Post Office Committee which will go far towards
doing that. It will raise, as I understand, the re-
ceipts upon printed matter and upon letters, be-
tween $3,000,000 and $4,000,000. It,willcutoff
the franking privilege, which is estimated—I know
that it is an arbitrary and a conjectural estimate—
at $1,500,000 more. Besides that, there is an op-
portunity for large reductions in the postal service.
I believe the California mails could be furnished
at a saving of hundreds of thousands of dollars,
and that California could be furnished better mail
service at this less expenditure than it now re-
ceives. I believe there might be a limit.put on
theroute agents who are established. I think we
might repeal that discretionary law which allows
the Postmaster General to increase the salaries Qf
the postmasters at pleasure; and I think if we did
these things, which Congress mightdo, we could
save the $6,000,000, and bring it down-. Why
should we not do it ? There are strongmoral and
political reasons for doing it. As it now stands,
it is a vast machine of irresponsible power. The
Postmaster General can run us in debt as much
as he pleases. He can appoint as many postmas-
ters as he pleases. He can add to, or diminish,
the service upon particular routes. He can accept
what bids are made, no matter how extravagant,
that he chooses; and tjie jaonsequence is, that in
the exercise of this discretion there has been the
most alarming increase of the burden which the
Post Office Department imposes upon the Treas-
ury.
Allow me, sir, at the risk of being tedious}, for
this is a matter which Senators should consider,
to refer to the rapid growth of expenditure ill that
Department. I hold in my hand a table, which
was made out with great carefor me at the Treas-
ury Department—a statement of the amounts
which have been paid out of the Treasury to sus-
tain the Post Office Department.. In the year
1846 it commenced with $810,231 62; in 1847, it
was $536,298 99; in 1848, $22,221 96; in 1849,
$681,500. It goes on in that way gradually. In
1854 it was $4,742,1)4 77; in 1855, $4,248,849 19;
in 1856, $4,598,402 87; in 1857, $4,746,499 67; in
1858, $5,564,495; m 1859, $9,164,935 10.
Now, sir, eit this rate of increase, it is manifest,
and it may bo made at the discretion of the Post-
; master General, that the expenses of this Depart-
i ment, drawn out of the Treasury, will soon be
greater than those of the Army or Navy. Is it
not time that we should impose-some restrictions
upon the exercise of this discretion? Is it not
time that we should say in the appropriation bill,
"You shall expend no more than you receive from
your revenue r " or if Congress should think he
ought to have more, then that "Yuu shall expend
no more out of the Treasury in addition to your
! revenue, than a given amount," imposing thus
; some limit on their discretion? There has never
I been anything like the growth of the patronage
of this Department. Allow me again to refer to
a paper of interest, in this connection.
1 find that there are m the United States
27,977 postmasters, whose ejjtiraeompensation is
$2,355,000; that $918,000 in grftss are appropri-
ated to clerks in the post offices; that there are
440 route or mail agents, costing $334,000; 28
express route agents, coating $28,000; 23 local
agents, costing $29,989; 1,404 mail messengers,
costing $184,634; 31 special agents, whose com-
| pensation and other expenses amount to $73,527.
| The salaries of the Post Office Department proper
cost about $170,000; so that we see here are a
number of officials, outnumbering either the Army
or.£he Navy, under the influence of the Postmas-
ter General, who has the power,! may say, to in-
crease them at pleasure.
i This is not all. I have not measured the total
| extent of its influence. I have shown you the
| officers who are distributed in every city,in every
< village, in every cross-road station in the land.
[ I might add that he exercises a powerful influ-
