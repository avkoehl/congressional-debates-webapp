[First indorsement.]

COLUMBIA, S. C., February 4, 1865.

Respectfully referred to the adjutant-General and most earnestly request that a remedy be immediately applied. The prisoners never will be properly fed until commissaries are ordered for prison duty. I never have been able to get anything from staff officers not on duty with the prisons. I hope that assistant commissaries will be ordered to report to me for duty, and that they be not, as heretofore, young men with no experience; the duty requires experience.

JNO H. WINDER,

Brigadier-General.

ADJUTANT AND INSPECTOR GENERAL'S OFFICE,

Respectfully referred to the Commissary- General.

By order of the Secretary of War:

H. L. CLAY,

Assistant Adjutant- General.

[Third indorsement.]

FEBRUARY 11, 1865.

Respectfully returned to Adjutant and Inspector General.

The following is a copy of an indorsement placed on a similar paper on December 16, 1864:

The state of the commissariat will not allow the issue of a full ration to our own troops in the field, much less to prisoners of war, It is just that the men who caused the scarcity shall be the first to suffer from it. No need is seen for an additional officer at Florence, S. C. Present appearances indicate the prospective necessity for a still greater reduction f the ration.

L. B. NORTHROP,

Commissary- General of Subsistence.

[Fourth indorsement.]

File. The prisoners have been ordered from Florence, and besides, the speedy exchange of all in our possession has been announced by authority of the Secretary of War.

H. L. C.,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
