Respectfully forwarded for the consideration and orders of the general commanding the department.

My own opinion is it would be better to put San Diego County (at least so much of it as includes the Colorado River), San Bernardino, and Sant Barbara Counties under martial law, and so order it that all malcontents and all open sympathizers with the South be tried by a military commission. Unless this be done the troops would be powerless to stop seditions language.

OFFICE INDIAN AGENT, WARM SPRINGS RESERVATION,

Dalles, Oreg., October 18, 1861.

Captain WHITTLESEY,

Commanding Fort Dalles, Oreg.:

SIR: I am informed that on the 15th instant a band of Snake Indians came into the reservation and drove off 100 head of horses, the property of friendly Indians on the reservation. The Indians report two of their men missing, supposed to be killed or capture. Owing to this late incursion of the Snakes upon the friendly Indians, I am compelled to make a requisition upon you for a detachment of men to assist in retaking the property already stolen, and to protect the reservation from further depredations. Without protection the Indians will not remain upon the reservation, and the property of the Government will be unsafe.

I remain, respectfully, your obedient servant,

WM. LOGAN,

Indian Agent, Oregon.
