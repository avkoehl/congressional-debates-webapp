Brigadier General S. WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Army of the Potomac:

SIR: Upon subsequent inquiry I have become pretty well satisfied that I must take the road that leads to the right from Old Chesterfield, and proceed a mile to the road on which Warren's two divisions have been moving, from which, I understand, he has moved them off. I am now proceeding there. There is nothing at the depot on the other road in my front, and the river is 6 miles distant in that direction from that point.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General of Volunteers.

Brigadier General S. WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Army of the Potomac:

SIR: I have arrived here-about three-fourths of a mile from the river. The ford here is known as Ox Ford. There is a brigade also (that is, the brigade was standing last week), some little distance below, say one-half mile, called Taylor's Brigade. The brigade is over the Telegraph road. There is no such ford known here, so far as I can ascertain, as Chesterfield Ford. Jericho Mills and Ford are about 3 or 4 miles about this. I have sent some infantry down to seize both brigade and ford. The enemy's sharpshooters occupy the other side. I don't think the y have any force; they have some little artillery, but appearances indicate that they are not strong. We shall soon know. General Warren's column is on my right, and I am in close connection which it. I am massing my troops in front of the position. A prisoner was captured yesterday, who just came from the defenses of Savannah. He says that all the troops there have been ordered up here.

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General, Commanding.

Major-General HANCOCK:

The enemy made so show of resistance here; my infantry are fording. I do not believe they mean to hold the North Anna. Will you communicate with General Meade, if you know where he is.

Major-General.
