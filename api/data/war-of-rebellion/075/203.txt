[General THOMAS:]

GENERAL: We have skirmished briskly with cavalry all the way from Resaca, so that I have not pushed quite so far as I wished. My outposts are in Calhoun. My main line about three-quarters of a mile this side, right resting on the river. The force in our front was Wheeler's cavalry, supported by two pieces of artillery and one regiment of infantry. I heard McPherson's guns, but only for a short time.

Respectfully,

O. O. HOWARD,

Major-General.
HDQRS. SECOND DIVISION, FOURTEENTH ARMY CORPS,On the March, May 16, 1864-6 p.m.

General THOMAS:

GENERAL: This will be handed you by a staff officer of General Garard, who returns with information that no bridge exists across the Oostenaula below the pontoons until you reach Rome. He reports General Garrard returning to Resaca, to cross at the pontoons. This places me in a dilemma. I, however, will push on till night and try and cross some way or other. Cannot pontoons be sent down to-night? This will remedy the difficulty. Please give me instructions. If I do not receive any during the night I will push for Rome.

Very respectfully,

JEF. C. DAVIS

Brigadier-General, Commanding Division.
