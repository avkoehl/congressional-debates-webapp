The mounted men have had some fighting with them, losing 1 killed and 4 wounded. The enemy are intrenched behind the levee at the bayou. Please send up the battery and the three regiments of the brigade. I think we can take them.

Yours,

A. G. MALLOY,

Colonel, Commanding Second Brigade.

SHERMAN'S HEADQUARTERS, September 14, 1863.

General McPHERSON,

Vicksburg:

I hear of Mr. Marshall as he passed in. My orders were to send him to me, but on his application I allowed him to pass direct from the bridge. If he proposes to reside in Vicksburg I can see him there at leisure, but if he proposes to go out I want him to see me on his way out. I would like much to have Stevenson and Crocker send me a sketch of the ground passed over by them in going to Monroe and Harrisonburg. The latter point is one of strategy, and should be visited occasionally to prevent the placing of heavy guns till high water makes the Washita navigable for gunboats. I want to begin to strike at the cavalry scattered in my front as soon as weather permits, but the heat is killing to men and horses, and water only exists in the larger streams. All ponds and cisterns have dried up.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.

[SEPTEMBER 14, 1863.]

Colonel J. CONDIT SMITH:

I will order Captain Joel to send all soldier teamsters to their companies, and to use hired teamsters to be furnished by you.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.

WAR DEPARTMENT, Washington, D. C., September 14, 1863-3 p. m. *

Major-General HURLBUT,

Memphis, Tenn.:

There are good reasons why troops should be sent to assist General Rosecrans' right with all possible dispatch. Communicate with Sherman to assist you, and hurry forward re-enforcements as previously directed.

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.
