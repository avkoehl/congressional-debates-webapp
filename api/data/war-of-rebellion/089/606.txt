HEADQUARTERS EIGHTEENTH ARMY CORPS,November 11, 1864.

Major-General TERRY:

A column of troops moved in front of my lines toward my right this morning. It is reported by one of my brigade commanders to have been about 5,000 strong. A part of the column is now massed in a field about three miles from my line.

G. WEITZEL,

Brevet Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS,November 11, 1864. (Received 11.50 a. m.)

Major-General WEITZEL:

You say that a part of the column is now massed about three miles from your line. Do you mean that it is in your front and three miles from you, or that it is three miles to your right? How large a part of the column is there?

ALF. H. TERRY,

Brevet Major-General.

November 11, 1864.

Major-General TERRY:

I have heard nothing further about that column of rebels. I think it will turn out like the three black crows story.

G. WEITZEL,

Brevet Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS EIGHTEENTH ARMY CORPS,November 11, 1864-1.30 p. m.

General TERRY:

I have just returned from a personal observation and investigation of that report. I find that at 9.30 a. m. a column of the enemy's troops, which consisted of three regiments, was seen moving toward the lower pontoon bridge. They now are lying massed in the field near Kingsland Creek, on the other side of the river, as if waiting their time to cross. No troops were seen to precede them. None have followed up to this moment. I have staff officers out and every one on the lookout, and will keep you posted as much as possible.

G. WEITZEL,

Brevet Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE JAMES,November 11, 1864.

General WEITZEL:

The following dispatch has just been received from Lieutenant-General Grant:

If possible to prevent to-day's papers from getting into the hands of the enemy, prevent it. They all contain news from the West most decidedly contraband.

U. S. GRANT,

lieutenant-General.
