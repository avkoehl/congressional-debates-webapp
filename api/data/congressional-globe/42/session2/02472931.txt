Direct taxation being impossible, indirect
taxation is the only alternative, under the power
given to Congress to lay and collect "duties,
imposts, and excises," our present system of
: tariff and internal revenue taxation has grown
up; and while the public debt and its interest,
together with the pensions and bounties, have
to be provided for in addition to the ordinary
expenses of the Government, tariff duties
must be maintained. Free trade is, therefore,
impossible, even if we all deemed it desirable.
Reform in the present mode of assessing and
collecting duties is all that can be accom-
; plished; it is simply a question for practical
legislators, who ought to have no other object
in view except, to obtain the necessary revenue
upon the most equitable terms, to pass such
laws as will most surely accomplish that result.
No citizen or class of citizens have any right
to require any other class of citizens to con-
tribute out of their earnings to enrich them;
and no legislator can honestly vote either to
pass or maintain laws which he knows pro-
duce such results.
However odious internal revenue taxes are
and 1 confess they are extremely so, they have
one merit: all the money collected goes into
the Treasury. They are avowedly levied on
consumption, and each man pays in exact, pro-
portion to the amount he consumes. These
taxes are reduced now to tobacco, spirits, and
stamps. The man who does not drink nor
use tobacco pays nothing on these articles,
which pay about four fifths of the whole in-
ternal revenue those who do, pay exactly in pro-
portion to the quantity used ; and the Govern-
ment, if its officials are honest, gets it all. The
same may be said of tea, coffee, aud all that
large class of imports not produced in this
country, which are purchased with the surplus
products of our soil, or the manufactured arti-
cles exported by us. No man complains of
what he is required to pay for anything he
buys if the increased cost caused by the impo-
sition of the tax goes into the Treasury, and
is honestly applied to support the Govern-
ment. The complaint comes when the in-
creased cost caused by the tax imposed goes
not into the Treasury, but into the pocket of
spme other citizen who lias succeeded in get-
ting laws enacted by Congress to make his
neighbors spend their earnings for his support.
it is because the bill of the committee
Strikes at that character of legislation, because
it seeks to reduce taxation far beyond the mere
reduction it makes in the revenue, and seeks
to lighten the oppression which bears so heav-
ily on labor, and especially on agricultural
labor, consumption, and products, that 1 give
it my support, and voted that it should be
reported to the House where its provisions
can be amended, extended, and corrected, so
as to make them conform to the wants and
just demands of the country. It is no bant-
ling of mine. I would have brought tariff
taxation, if not back to the average of nine-
teen per cent, as it was in 18G0 when our gen-
eral pi osperity was greater than at any other
period of our history, at least to twenty-five, as
it was from 1846 to 1857, which the rapidly
mereasiug price of labor, scarcity of materials,
and cost of ^articles in Europe, and especially
in Great Britain, would enable us to do. The
products of our protected industries are fac-
tures now, not manufactures as formerly.
! The machinery of this country has a pro-
| ducing power estimated as equal to one hun-
| dred and sixty million human beings. The
j product of machinery needs no protection, as
' no nation has any better than we.
My colleague on the committee [Mr. Brooks]
has submitted to me the programme of what
he thinks the tariff ought to be; in the main I
agree with him. He will lay it b.efore the House
and the country to-day, and therefore I will
not consume time now by stating my ideas of
the modifications I would suggest in detail,
but will reserve that for the five minutes debate
on the items of the bill. The bill of the com-
^ mittee is certainly far better than either that of
! the minority or that of the Senate, and infi-
j nitely better than the existing condition of
things which the protectionists in both Houses
secretly desire to perpetuate either by dividing
the friends of reduction and reform on plaus-
ible but impracticable amendments and sub-
stitutes, or by forcing an adjournment before
any modification can be perfected, as was tried
the other day under the lead of another dis-
tinguished Pennsylvania protectionist, [Mr.
Dickey.] Of course the object is not openly
avowed; such avowal would defeat it. They
"stoop to conquer," and judging from the
action of the House it is possible, I had almost
said it is probable, they will succeed. Yet I
hardly think any Representative from the West
or South would feel much confidence in the
indorsement of his people if he abandons the
field without making an honest, intelligent,
and persistent effort to initiate at least a sys-
tem of tariff reform. The gentleman from
Illinois [Mr. Bcrchard] presents the follow-
ing facts, which my examination of the sub-
ject confirms:
" The reductions in the bill of the duties upon
but six classes of manufactures lessen the revenue
not quite ten million dollars, but lighten taxation
$54,000,000. A comparison of the domestic produc-
tion with the imports will show as follows:
Reduction on
Reduction of cost of do-
revenue. wextic pro-
duction.
Salt  4615.522 £1,175,000
Leather  329,258 5,890,000
Iron  2,135,223 10.683,(100
Steel  745,539 1,726,000
Woolens  4.967,452 23,000,000
Cottons  788.72 4 5,000,000
Total $8,781,718 $45,333,000"
That alone will commend the bill to the
favorable consideration of the House and the
country, and there is no good reason why by
proper amendments the relief may not be
more than doubled. The propositions of the
Senate aud the minority are simply ridiculous
in many regards. Take, for examplp, salt in
bulk, now taxed one hundred and thirty-nine
and one sixth per cent.; ten per cent, off, as the
Senate proposes, is child's play. So with all
the manufactures of leather, iron, cotton, and
wool, as both the Senate and the minority
propose, ten per cent, indiscriminate reduc-
tion is wholly inadequate. The average rate
of reduction proposed by the committee on
these manufactures is about twenty per cent.;
it ought to have been much more, and I
hope the House will by proper amendments
increase it. This much can be safely said for
the bill: nearly all its changes of existing
duties are reductions; every blow struck, how-
ever feeble, is in the right direction ; some
monopoly is aimed at, some abuse is modified
if not corrected; an outpost here and a bastion
there are overthrown, so that when another
attack is made the citadel of monopoly will
fall, it is to be hoped never to rise again.
1 know how hard it is for Democrats to
vote against any sort of proposition reducing
taxation in any form. Fortunately, our con-
stituents are rapidly learning, if they do not
now know, that mere reduction of reveaue
does not necessarily relieve burdens, while,
as in the case of salt, a loss of revenue of a
fraction over a million, by making it free
would relieve the consumers of it, and every
human being consumes it, over three million
dollars. The people are asking, I might say
imploring, relief from monopoly rather than
from mere taxation or revenue.
We may as well look existing facts squarely
in the face. The Democrats are in a minor-
ity, and we have a few whose constituents
require them to vote for local interests. A
bill granting substantial relief can only be
passed by the aid of the revenue reform
Republican members from the West, and
while I and most of the gentlemen on this
side of the House think that $250,000,000 is
ample to supply all the wants and the rea-
sonable stealings of the Administration, we
cannot expect that men who sustain the Gov-
ernment, and are responsible for its success,
will deprive it of the means they think neces-
sary for its support. We would not reduce
the revenues of the country if we were in
power below the estimates of expenses sub-
mitted by our Secretary of the Treasury, no
matter how unreasonable the opposition might
show them to be, aud we cannot and ought
not to expect the cooperation of the friends of
the Administration in reducing the revenues
below the estimates submitted by him. The
mode of reduction and the relief from taxes
now paid to protected monopolies in making
reductions down to the point to which Repub-
licans can go is the great object all friends
of revenue reform, regardless of politics, must
unite to accomplish, if we expect to bring about
useful results.
The Secretary submits the following:
