Mill? Is it your judgment that these two divisions were moving to meet Warren, or is it likely they were moving to take a position to meet an anticipated attack on the South Side Railroad? Did the contraband on his return make no inquiry or hear anything as to the destination of these troops? If they crossed at Burgess' Mill and moved down the Boydton plank toward Dinwiddie Court-House would not the contraband have been likely to have heard this or seem some of them this morning on his return?

HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,December 9, 1864-4.10 p.m.

Major-General MEADE,

Commanding:

Lieutenant Stacey, of my staff, has just returned from General Miles. He informs me the cavalry are out from two to three miles beyond Hatcher's Run. No firing going on. So far as he gathered, there was no enemy in front of the cavalry, and no further information of the movement of the enemy's infantry had been obtained. Two stragglers from Butler's cavalry had been picked up. Lieutenant Stacey took out my order to General Miles to push forward the cavalry, with some infantry support, to find out what they could of the enemy's movement.
