The SPEAIvERpro tempore. Is there objec-
tion to entertaining the motion of the gentle-
man from Michigan, [Mr. Conger?]
Mr. CREBS. I object unless the excuses
for other absent members may be presented in
the same way.
Mr. McNEELY. Unless we can go back
and excuse Mr. Burr, I object.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Objection is
made.
Mr. ELDRIDGE. I rise to a point of order.
Is it not in order to make a motion to excuse
a member, and cannot a majority of the House
grant the excuse ? Or can a single objection
prevent a member from being excused?
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair
understands that it is in order to excuse a
member when his name is called on the call
of the roll for that purpose.
Mr. ELDRIDGE. Has not the order of
presenting excuses been reached?
Mr. STILES. I wish to inquire upon what
rule the Speaker bases his decision? The
practice heretofore has been that excuses
should be presented at any time during the
proceedings.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. As the Chair
understands, it is the rule to move to excuse
any member when his name is called during
the call of the roiybr the presentation of ex-
cuses. If the House decides otherwise, the
Chair will of course acquiesce. The Chair
will entertain any motion for excusing a mem-
ber, provided there be no objection. Is there
objection to entertaining the motion of the
gentleman from Michigan [Mr. Conger] that
Mr. Beaman be excused?
Mr. CONGER. On account of ill health.
There being no objection, the motion was
entertained, and was agreed to.
Mr. CREBS. I move that Mr. Burr be
excused on account of sickness.
The motion was entertained by unanimous
consent, and agreed to.
Mr. YOUNG. I move that Mr. Price be
excused on account of sickness.
The motion was entertained by unanimous
consent, and agreed to.
Mr. PLATT. I desire to ask how many
more members can be excused and still leave
us enough to make a quorum ?
Mr. FERRISS. I offer the following reso-
lution:
Resolved, That the Sergeant-at-Arms take into
custody and bring to the bar of the House such
of its members as are now absent without leave of
the House.
The question being put upon the resolution,
it was declared agreed to.
Mr. FARNSWORTH. I move that all fur-
ther proceedings under the call be dispensed
with. I understand there is a quorum here,
and I do not see any use in carrying this thing
further.
Mr. FERRISS. I hope that the motion ofthe
gentleman from Illinois [Mr. Farnsworth]
will not prevail. We do not want to trifle with
the business of the House.
The question being put, there were ayes
one hundred and one, noes not counted.
Mr. PROSSER. 1 desire, if it is in order, to
ask leave of absence for one of my colleagues.
Several Members. It is too late.
Mr. W1NANS. I move that all further pro-
ceedings under the call be dispensed with ;
and on this motion I desire to make a remark.
Several mem*bers objected.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. A vote has
just been taken on the motion to dispense with
further proceedings under the call.
Mr. WINANS. I want to say just one word.
I understand that the reason we have a call of
the House 
Mr. BECK. I rise to put a parliamentary
inquiry to the Chair. Is it in order now to
move that the House take a recess till half
past eleven o'clock to-morrow morning, and
that the Sergeant-at-Arms be directed to bring
the absent members before the House at that
time.
The SPEAKER -pro tempore. On the
motion of the gentleman from Illinois [Mr.
Farxsworth] all further proceedings under
this call have beem dispensed with.
Mr. KELSEY". That has not been under-
stood by the House.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentle-
man from Illinois will please state his motion.
Mr. FARNSWORTH. My motion was that
all further proceedings under tlhe Call be dis-
pensed with.
Several Members. Thathasbeen voted clown.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. That there
may be no mistake, the Chair, if any member
of the House desires it, will put the question
again upon the motion of the gentleman from
Illinois.
Mr. WINANS. Before that question is put
I desire to say a word in regard to it.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. No membet-
seems to desire that the question shall be
again put.
Mr. KELSEY. I have requested the Chair
to put it again. When we adopted the resolu-
tion, and one hundred and One rose, it was on
the motion of my colleague [Mr. Ferriss]
.directing the Sergeant-at-Arms to take into
custody the absentees.
Mr. FERRISS. And weallso understood it.
Mr. FARNSWORTH. How many members
are present ?
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair
desires to state to the House' that the gentle-
man from Illinois [Mr. Farnsworth] made a
motion to dispeuse with all farther proceedings
under the call. At the same time the gentle-
man from New York [Mr. Ferriss] moved
the resolution that the Sergeant-at-Arms take
into custody and bring in the absent members.
It was the intention of the Chair to put the
question on the motion of the gentleman from
Illinois, which takes precedence of the other
question. That, however, does not seem to be
the understanding of the House.
Mr. KELSEY. It was our understanding
that we were voting on the motion of my
colleague, [Mr. Ferriss.]
'Mr. SARGENT. The Clerk read the other
resolution.
Mr. BENTON. Let us have the vote.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair
will take the liberty to put these motions to
the House again. The motion of the gentle-
man from Illinois [Mr. Farnsworth] to dis-
pense with all further proceedings under the
call takes precedence of the motion of the
gentleman from New York, [Mr. Ferriss.]
Mr. FARNSWORTH. How many mem-
bers appear to be present?
Mr. STEVENS. That is not in order.
Mr. FARNSWORTH. It is in order.
Mr. WINANS rose.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair is
not informed how many members are present.
Mr. FARNSWORTH. I understand 
Several Members. Order!
Mr. FARNSWORTH, Has a quorum ap-
peared ?
Several Members. Order!
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair
will state that a motion to dispense with all
further proceedings under a call takes prece-
dence of a motion to bring in the absentees.
Mr. FARNSWORTH. I now understand
from the Chair that there is a quorum present.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question
will be first taken on the motion of the gentle-
man from Illinois.
The House refused to dispense with all fur-
ther proceedings under the call.
The resolution of Mr. Ferriss was then
adopted.
Mr. BECK. I now move that the House
take a recess until half past eleven o'clock to-
morrow morning, at which time the Sergeant-
at-Arms can present at the bar the absentees
whom he has taken into custody.
Mr. FERRISS. We have just refused to dis-
pense with all further proceedings under the
call. Is this motion, then, in order?
The SPEAKER pro tempore. It is in order
to dispense with these proceedings altogether
or to dispense wilh them with condition or lim-
itation, and the Chair rules that the motion is
in order.
Mr. BECK. My motion is that we take a
recess until half-past eleven o'clock to-mor-
row morning.
