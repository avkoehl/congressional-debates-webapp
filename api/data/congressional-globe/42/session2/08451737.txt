THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
1737
million dollars, and gives it to the manufac-
turers of salt. This oppressive and iniquitous
robbery of the people under the form of law
should be done away with. If we propose in
good faith to inaugurate revenue reform and
relieve the people ot' th§ oppressive burdens
of taxation under which they now labor, this
is the very article upon which to begin. Salt
is one of the prime necessaries of life; its use
cannot be dispensed with by the rich or poor;
and while the repeal of the duty on this article
would cause but little reduction in the revenues
of the Government, it would result in the
saving of millions to-the people in reducing
the. price.
Mr. Speaker, there is no man in or out of
this House that is more in favor of revenue
reform and a reduction of taxation, and will
more heartily support any measure looking to
that end than myself. But that reduction, to
meet my approval, must be made to apply
to articles ot' consumption, not to property.
This will confer benefits and blessings upon
the whole people of the country, the poor as
well as the rich. We should begin this reform
and reduction by stripping the tariff of its
odious and unjust feature of class legislation,
by arrangtng it with the view to the creation
of revenue alone, and so adjusted that the rev-
enues derived under it shall be sufficient, and
not more, to meet our obligations and pay the
expenses of Government conducted according
to the strictest and most rigid principles of
economy and retrenchment. This is the rev-
enue reform and reduction of taxation that is
demanded of us and expected by the people
we represent. They will be satisfied with none
other, nor with less than this.
The six million voters, Mr. Speaker, rep-
resented by us on this floor do not demand,
nor do they expect ua to release, less than
seventy thousand property-holders, now paying
an income tax, from bearing their just bur-
dens of the Government. They do not require
of us to exempt the property and wealth of the
country and leave taxes to rest on consump-
tion alone, and should this be done, the people
will demand of us to know why this great
wrong against the labor and industry of the
country was committed. I can understand, sir,
the motive that governs the Representatives
on this floor of the wealthy communities of
the eastern States in their opposition to the
income tax; but when I find the Represent-
atives of a western or southern State opposing
it, 1 confess the motive that actuates them in
their opposition is beyond my comprehension.
The cries of "espionage" and "inquisitorial"
that have been rung, with all their changes,
from 1863 to the present, will not avail, be-
cause examination will show that these objec-
tions will apply to all taxes, and to most of
them in a far more obtrusive and objectionable
form than this. The objection that it is unjust
is without foundation. All the authorities agree
in saying that it is the most just and equitable
tax that can be imposed; and figures demon-
strate, when you compare the wealth and pop-
ulation of the eastern States with the wealth
and population of the western and southern
States, that its repeal and discontinuance would
be an act of gross injustice to the people o f
the West and South. Jn proof ot' this, I sub-
mit the following table, showing the true valu-
ation of the real and personal estate on the
1st day of June, 1870, of the States named,
as shown by the report of the Superintendent
of the Ninth Census, and the amount of in-
ternal revenue tax paid by each of said States
for the year ending 30th June, 1871, and the
amount of income tax paid by each for said

It will be seen by reference to this table
that Massachusetts, with property valued at
$'2,132,148,741, pays less than three hundred
thousand more of internal tax than does Ken-
tucky with only 5604,318,552 of property. Con-
necticut, with $170,312,872 more property than
Kentucky, pays less than one sixth of the
internal tax paid by Kentucky. Illinois,
with property valued at $2,121,680,579, pays
$15,088,536 of internal tax, more than twice as
much as Massachusetts, and nearly three mil-
lions more than Pennsylvania with property
valued at $3,808,340,112. Take off the income
tax, and the disproportion of tax paid to the
wealth of the States is largely increased. .Ken-
tucky will then pay nearly one and a half million
more than Massachusetts, and Illinois will pay
$5,201,053 more than Pennsylvania, and three
times as much as Massachusetts.
But, Mr. Speaker, I will not extend this
comparison. Here are the figures taken from
official reports, and any one can see at a glance
the inequalities I have indicated, and what
States are to be benefited by the repeal and
discontinuance of this tax. I have occupied
more time in the discussion of this subject than
I expected or intended when I began, and
have only to say in conclusion that when I
compare those persons who pay the income
tax, and upon whom its burdens will rest, with
tho great body of tax-payers of this country,
and contrast this tax with the other taxes im-
posed upon the people, I am surprised to find
either in or out of this House any formidable
opposition to its continuance. But, sir, I care
not what others may do as regards this tax; to
me the path of duty is plain, and I will follow
it. Never, so long as there is a dollar of the
public debt to be paid; never, so long as there
is a pensioner to be paid from the public
Treasury; never, so long as taxes have to be
imposed or moneys collected from the people
to pay the expenses and maintain the Govern-
ment, will I consent to see the possessors of
the property and wealth of the country relieved
or exempted from the payment of an income
tax.
CHINESE SLAVE TKADE—COOLTISM.
Mr. COGHLAN. Mr. Speaker, there is now
pending before the Judiciary Committee of
this House a bill which I introduced sometime
since, for the suppression of the Chinese slave
trade, and as I nave been requested by some
members of that committee, as well as by
other gentlemen upon this floor, to take this
occasion to lay before the House my reasons
for wishing that bill to pass, and as I know that
to many the question is a novel one, I will,
with the consent of the House, proceed to dis-
cuss some of the many arguments that might
be advanced why that bill should become a
law. The Chinese cooly question is one that
is possibly less understood by members than
any other that will demand the attention of this
House. I find by private conversation that
some Representatives here have by half an
hour's contact with the free Chinese in San
Francisco judged of the morality, the standing,
and the intelligence of the fifty thousand
Chinese coolies or slaves that to-day compete
with the labor of the free men of the great
State of California.
I cannot hope, Mr. Speaker, to open the
eyes of prejudice, or to make the willfully
blind to see, but I do ask the House, in the
name of the laboring men of the far West, to
assist, ere it be too late, in checking the im-
portation of the host of slaves which are yearly
being landed on American soil. This bill asks
no more, nor do I seek for further legislation.
Startling as the proposition maybe to some,
a personal knowledge for the last twenty years
of the workings of the Chinese system of labor
compels me to say that in my judgment the
labor of the fifty thousand Chinese who to-day
infest the State I have the honor in part to
represent, is owned and sold by a few rich
companies of merchants who traffic in human
flesli. I know that these companies make the
engagements for the laborers, fix the com-
pensation, and send their agents along lo re-
ceive the wages of the coolies' labor. The
records of our courts show that they sell their
women for so many pieces of silver, and their
own conversation tells that they have intro-
duced into free America the vile system of
Chinese slave labor.
I am aware, sir, that in this portion of our
country, where the Chinese question is so little
understood, it is generally believed that the
opposition to Chinese coolyism by the people
of the far West is engendered by a feeling of
caste prejudice, and that it has no nobler or
more generous sentiment to support it. But,
3ir, while 1 admit with sorrow that some few
ruffianly attacks upon persons of that nation-
ality might give color to such a supposition, I
emphatically deny that the enlightened and
generous-hearted people of the Pacific coast
are influenced by any such ignoble feeling.
No people deprecate and abhor the cowardly
instincts that impel men to ill-treat and abuse
the defenseless more than they, and the swift
vengeance of an impartial law follows close
upon the heels of all these outrages when their
perpetrators can be discovered. But knowing
as we do that the foul stain of slavery is upon
us, and feeling that all our efforts to suppress
it are futile, and finding that our cries for
assistance, instead of bringing us aid, are an-
swered by you with incredulous smiles and
derisive taunts, we may deplore, but we can-
not be surprised at the fact that our laboring
men are gradually becomingprejudiced against
tho whole Chinese nation, because a false rea-
soning leads them to believe that the poor
cooly is responsible for the slavery that exists
among us, when in truth you and I and the
law-makers of the land are the real culprits.
Now, Mr. Speaker, tempting as the subject
undoubtedly is, I do not intend to essay a
speech at this time. 1 propose to make a
simple and straightforward statement, of facts,
which I believe will prove to every member
upon this floor that the Pacific coast is to-day
cursed with as vile a system of slavery as
ever disgraced any country on the face of
God's fair earth.
The Chinese slave system is, I believe,
unique. It is a quasi voluntary servitude.
The cooly intended for foreign marts is
sometimes kidnapped and carried aboard ship
by violence, or while stupefied by drugs ad-
ministered by the kidnapper, and after he
finds himself detached from his home, his
fears and his superstitions are alike used as
levers to compel him to sign a contract to
labor for his capturer for a certain number
of years, which contract once signed is, as I
will directly show, as binding upon him as an
edict from heaven accompanied by a threat
from hell. Mention is made in the North
