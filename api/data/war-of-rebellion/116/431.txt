WAR DEPARTMENT, ADJUTANT-GENERAL'S OFFICE,

Washington, April 7, 1862.

Lieutenant Colonel MARTIN BURKE,

Commanding, &amp;c., Fort Hamilton, New York.

SIR: I have respectfully to inform you that the Secretary of War declines to grant the request of Brigadier-General Stone to have his wife with him.

I am, sir, &c.,

E. D. TOWNSEND,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

FORT HAMILTON, New York Harbor, April 7, 1862.

Brigadier General L. THOMAS,

Adjutant-General of the Army, Washington, D. C.

SIR: Inclosed you will receive the request made by Brigadier-General Stone, now in my custody at this post. As a matter of course I could not act upon this request even if I had any charges against him without the authority of the War Department. Major-General McClellan's order is the coucher I have for his confinement. I would be glad if you would inform me whether the parole I gave to General Stone and of which I sent you a copy is approved, or whether you wish any modification of the same. As I stated in my accompanying letter I had only two modes to pursue-to give him that parole or to post a sentry in front and rear of his casemate.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

MARTIN BURKE,

Lieutenant-Colonel Third Artillery.
