From which it will be seen that, at the time this draft was closed, July 31, there was an aggregate deficiency of but 5,600 in all the States. This aggregate was made up of the deficiencies of ten different States, so that the amount due from each was very small. The call of July 18, for 500,000 men, may be said to have been made with some of the States in excess of all previous calls and without a material deficiency in any. In filling these calls, however, but a small proportion of men was obtained by draft, as appears above, the quotas drafted for being filled, according to law, if the required number paid communication.

THE DRAFT OF 1864, FOR DEFICIENCIES UNDER CALL OF JULY 18, 1864.

As required by section 2 of the act approved July 4, 1864, the draft under call of July 18, 1864, was commenced in all the deficient sub-districts as soon as practicable (to wit, September 19) after the expiration of the fifty days authorized for filling quotas by volunteering. Threats to resist this draft by force of arms were made in various quarters of the country. In several places parties of men were bivouacked in the woods, partially organized, and armed with pistols and shotguns, for the avowed purpose of preventing the execution of the law. The draft has been made without resort to military force on the part of the Government, and the examination of the men is in progress, and no serious resistance has been offered. It is only just to the officers acting under this Bureau in the different States to say that the unflinching determination manifested by them to carry our fully and fairly the orders of the Government, and the good judgment and fairness they have shown in doing so, have contributed in no small degree to this favorable result.

The state of this draft, as far as reported to November 1, is as follows:
