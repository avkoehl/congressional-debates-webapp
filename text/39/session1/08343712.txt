THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
July 10,
our expenses from imposts, the public lands,
and miscellaneous resources, and liquidated
debts considered formidable in their day.' The
returns are not all in for the fiscal year end-
in" with 30th June last, but they are near
$530,000,000.
From customs   $170,000,000
I'Yom internal revenue  310,000,000
From iniscellaneuJ^s..   50,000,000
Exclusive of loans $530,000,000
From this sum the Secretary of the Treas-
ury had reduced the public debt to 1st June
$87,000,000, and paid interest about $142,-
600,000. But as the miscellaneous receipts
are so largely creditable to sales of useless
war materials, and as so many expenditures
are chargeable to the war, I prefer to estimate
by the present year, beginning July 1. In his
estimate for this year the Secretary calls for
$284,000,000 for expenditures. Butthis Con-
gress has so exceeded his estimates that he will
want $300,000,000 for expenditures. To meet
his expenditures he estimates the following
receipts:
Customs $100,000,000
Internal revenue  275,000,000
Miscellaneous  21,000,000
$393,000,000
This will leave $96,000,000 to apply upon
the public debt. But without a change of the
tariff this estimate will be too low for customs.
There is no reason without that change why
they should not go on as they are now going.
But if we call them $139,000,000, and our
miscellaneous as above, $21,000,000, we have
$100,000,000. This will pay all the ordinary
expenses of Government. For the Secretary
wants $300,000,000 in all, and of this he wants
$1*10,000,000 for interest, which I propose to
pay out of the internal revenue fund, and then
we can either reduce the internal revenue fund
to $140,000,000, or we can set apart the sur-
plus for a sinking fund.
Now, if you revise the tariff; you must have
some regard to a revenue basis. How much
do you want to raise by it ? We will say $140,-
000,000. To this add your receipts from lands
and all other sources usually denominated mis-
cellaneous, and you have $100,000,000. And
this is all the money we want for ordinary ex-
penses of Government.. The balance goes for
interest, $140,000,000, which would be all that
we should require from internal sources if we
pay nothing for the liquidation of our debt.
Cannot the tariff be so revised as to produce
a sum like this, on an average, for the next
four years, taxing heavily luxuries, lightly ne-
cessities, and everywhere encouraging domes-
tie industry, thus making both a revenue tariff
and a protective tariff? For these interests
have got to be compromised, and the sooner
the better for both parties. Indeed, I have
taken particular pains among the large number
of manufacturers who have come before our
committee this session to inquire if they would
not prefer a revision of our present very unfair
tariff upon principles that would so bring rev-
enue with additional protection as to give them
a reasonable hope of an early deliverance from
the annoyance of the stamps, the inquisitors,
and the spies that are a necessity from our
internal taxation system. I have received but
one response, and that has been, God speed
the day!
With $140,000,000 (being $80,000,000 less
than this year) from the tariff, and with $20,-
000,000 from miscellaneous sources, let us see
where our internal revenue tax will land us
at the end of this fiscal year.
But, while I have assumed $100,000,000 for
the ordinary expenses of Government, I pro-
test against any such extravagance. With our
currency placed upon an honest basis, the
ordinary expenses of Government should never
exceed $100,000,000. I also protest against
the assumption of the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania, [Mr. Steveks,] that our debt will
yet be increased to $4,000,000,000. If almost
any one else had made such an assumption I
should have inferred that he was in fayor of
paying the rebel debt. But I suppose he means
our debt is to be increased by paying for the
losses to loyal men from rebel sources. When
this subject comes up it will be found that
losses of health, of life, and of limb, will have
to be taken into consideration as well as losses
of fences, of garden vegetables, of haystacks,
peach orchards, buildings, &c. It is lamen-
tably true that many persons suffered greatly
from losses of property. But how inestimably
greater were the losses of those who risked
their all to defend such property. When a
commission is appointed to estimate the losses
of this war, the cripples,-the orphans, and the
widows must be heard; for our pensions are
wholly inadequate.
The Secretary of the Treasury, at the com-
mencement of this Congress, estimated $275,-
00,0,000 from internal revenue. Our legisla-
tion will vary this somewhat, as well as uncon-
trollable circumstances. For instance, the
income tax returns (being last year $58,000,-
000) show a falling off of about thirty per cent.,
or ^17,000,000. Then from the reduction of
prices and decrease of business attendant upon
the close of the war we must estimate a loss
of about forty million dollars. We have added
largely to the free list. The loss therefrom is'
estimate<f at $05,000,000. This makes a total
of $102,000,000 to come from $275,000,000,
leaving $173,000,000 of the Secretary's esti-
mate. And as we want but $140,000,000 for
our interest, (the tariff and miscellaneous hav-
ing paid all other expenses,) we should have
left $33,000,000 to apply upon the liquidation
of eur debt in this case.
But I believe the legislation of this Congress
upon internal revenue will largely increase this
amount, although we did not need the increase
except for a sinking fund. Now that the cot-
ton tax is out of the woods I can safely say
this. It will be remembered that this House
put the cotton tax at five cents. The Senate
begrudgingly put it at two cents. We had to
compromise on three cents. Commissioner
Wells estimates that we will raise $7,000,000
from this source; from our more stringent
whisky law $25,000,000, and from the new law
upon legacies, successions, tobacco, licenses,
&c., $18,000,000. This would make $45,000,000
from new legislation. Add this to the former
$33,000,000 and we have $78,000,000 to apply
upon our national debt, with a tariff yield-
ing $140,000,000. But will this tariff yield
$140,000,000 ? It is the highest ever even asked
for, even with gold at par. To the duties asked
for in this bill what shall we add for the differ-
ence between gold and currency? During the
last fiscal year gold has averaged 140. With gold
at less than 125 Government cannot convert its
seven-thirty notes. This guaranties at least
twenty-five per cent, to the duties provided for
in the bill. The Secretary is prohibited by law
from reducing the currency fast enough to keep
gold even at this point. Supposing gold aver-
ages the same as last year, then the duties,
unprecedently high in the bill even for cur-
rency, are raised forty per cent. What is gold
to be the present year ? What landmarks have
we? Where is the plummet for our soundings,
or the polar star for our direction?
And here is a breaker in sight. We have
near one hundred million dollars of goods in
bond. The gold duties due upon them will
average $40,000,000. These duties are due
one year from the date of the bond at any
rate. If this bill pass, these goods must either
be taken out of the country or pay this $40,-
000,000 before the bill goes into effect, or be
subject to the new duties, which are greatly
increased. And large orders have been given
out and some of the goods are on the way.
Now, we know that the Secretary of the
Treasury has the most of the gold in the coun-
try, and if he should sell, judging by the past,
it would go abroad quite as fast as he would
sell. To meet this $40,000,000 and all other
gold demands, good judges say that there is
not $10,000,000 in the market. Some limit it
to less. And tho Secretary of the Treasury is
daily making drafts upon this, while the gold
interest of July is already paid. If this bill
passes in its present shape, may not gold go to
100, and thus all the duties be doubled until a
reduction of imports shall reduce its price 1
Does this bill tend to revenue, to protection,
or prohibition ? The two form er I want. The
latter I oppose, as among other evils it will
prolong the abominations attendant upon the
internal revenue sytem. Upon many of the
items in the bill I know nothing save from the
statements of the numerous gentlemen of great
tact who have appeared as interested parties
before the committee, and the adverse com-
ments upon them since the bill has been pub-
lished. * I wish I could be convinced that the
duties would be productive of revenue as well
as protective in all cases; for I know that the
interests of agriculture _and, in fact, of all
industrial pursuits "require a change of the
present law. With so much unimproved land
as we have we ought to induce, by all practi-
cable means, foreign cultivators to emigrate
here. Our manufacturers, too, see the neces-
sity of inviting foreign laborers, especially
skilled laborers, here in greater numbers than
sufficient to make good the half million we
lost in the war. I want to see American legis-
lation fraternize with American industry. I
want to see American farmers patronize Amer-
ican manufacturers, and American manufac-
turers in turn patronize American beef, pork,
mutton, wool, flax, flaxseed, &c. We are
daily told that to enrich and populate our
country we must labor to diversify American
pursuits. This is the truth, and it is equally
true that we should diversify agriculture. For,
while it is true that we cannot all be farmers, it
is equally true that all farmers cannot depend
upon the same crop. We cannot all be grow-
ing cereals and prosper.
Does this bill tend to diversify agriculture?
Are its advantages equivalent to its burdens
upon agriculture? For, if the bill is not satis-
factory to the manufacturers of all kinds it lias
not been for the want of effort on their part,
nor for the want of an appreciation of their
real necesities on the part of the • committee.
And I will leave the great interests of com-
merce to those who so ably represent it on this
floor, and who are better able to speak for it
than I am. I will speak for the few agricult-
urists on this floor, and yet in behalf of the
most numerous interest in the country. "Ne
sutor ultra erepidam.'' As the President told
us about the word " veto," I tell you again,
Sr. Speaker, that here is Latin, and it means,
in this case, let a man only talk upon what he
best knows.
Our chairman, in his opening speech, has
alluded favorably to the provisions concerning
wool, as being an honorable compromise be-
tween the wool-growers and the manufacturers
of wool. From his stand-point, where the wool
is near the manufacturers, his views may be
correct. He resides in a State where every
acre of land is inclosed and used to its fall
capacity; where it commands the highest price,
■and where land is so scarce to the wants of its
ever enterprising inhabitants that his State is
daily sending out emigrants who never fail
wherever they plant their feet to become mod-
els in industry, in enterprise, in morals, and
in everything else that tends to advance and
adorn a State. Vermont sheep, owing to the
untiring skill of her breeders, have added more
to her credit than her renowned Morgan horses,
whose fleetness for short distances may'have
occasionally been surpassed, but whose patient
endurance, like that of our chairman, is pro-
verbial. It was her Campbell, who after a series
of triumphs at American State fairs, took back
the American descendants to the Old World,
and at the World's Fair, amid the competition
of nations, heard plaudits from connoisseurs
of every clime as the righteous judge tied the
triumphal ribbon around the emblems of inno-
cence from the Green Mountain State. It was
then that her enterprising breeder, more wor-
thily than the Emperor Alexander, could cry
because he had no more to conquer. This tri-
