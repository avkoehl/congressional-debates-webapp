FALMOUTH, VA., August 22, 1862.

ABRAHAM LINCOLN, President:

Porter is here with nearly all of his corps. The remainder will probably be here by 12 o'clock to-day. Reynolds, with Pennsylvania Reserves, is well on his way up to Pope, and I am shoving Porter's corps as rapidly as possible to Pope. A large portion of the Reserve Artillery has arrived, and a proper proportion will move with each body of troops. All quiet in our front. A messenger from Reno, this moment arrived, states that the enemy is massing large bodies of troops at Kelly's Ford, and at 6.30 a. m. heavy firing was heard in direction of Pope. You may rely on my pushing troops rapidly as possible.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.

FALMOUTH, VA., August 22, 1862 - 10.40 a. m.

Major General H. W. HALLECK, Commander-in-Chief:

In answer to a dispatch from the President this morning, which you no doubt have seen, I gave him the state of affairs here at that time. I will telegraph again in an hour.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.

FALMOUTH, VA., August 22, 1862 - 1.30 p. m.

Major General H. W. HALLECK, General-in-Chief:

All General Porter's corps, except the artillery, have landed, and we are moving them up the road as rapidly as possible; but enough of artillery has been landed to make a fair proportion for the infantry. Owing to the non-arrival of wagons, our means of transportation are very limited and will soon run out, but we hope to receive more from Fort Monroe to-morrow. All quiet in our front. I have sent out a detachment of cavalry to communicate with General Reno.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.

Washington, August 22, 1862 - 3.45 p. m.

Major-General BURNSIDE, Falmouth, Va.:

The enemy seems to be moving the mass of their forces toward Warrenton, to turn Pope's right. It is therefore important that Porter's corps should move up as rapidly as possible. Direct him and all other commanders to subsist their men and forage their animals as much as possible on the country. Kearny's division is already moving out by the railroad.

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.

FALMOUTH, VA., August 22, 1862 - 5.45 p. m.

Major General H. W. HALLECK, General-in-Chief:

Telegram of 3.45 received. General Sykes' division, the last of Porter's corps, is already under orders to move, and I will push the other
