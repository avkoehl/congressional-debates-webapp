HEADQUARTERS, Baldwin, July 4, 1864.

Major GEORGE U. MAYO,Inspector of Artillery of the Department:

MAJOR: I very respectfully report that I have many men in my command who are destitute of shoes. I have forwarded an estimate of shoes, clothing, and pay to the chief quartermaster twice since being in this district, and his reply is that neither pay nor shoes can be obtained in the department. The clothing in my command is generally good. I have 1 man who was transferred to my company from the Second Florida Cavalry, who is entirely destitute of shoes and clothing, and has not even a change of clothes.

I have the honor to be, major, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

F. L. VILLEPIGUE,

Captain Kilcrease Light Artillery.

Major Hutson Lee, quartermaster, thinks shoes and clothing sufficient to supply the artillery troops in Florida are here, and it is urgently recommended, in order to enhance their efficiency, that the articles be sent to Major General Simkins, at Tallahassee, to be distributed as above.

G. U. MAYO,

Major, &amp;c.
