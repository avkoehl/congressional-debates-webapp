HEADQUARTERS ROCK ISLAND BARRACKS,Rock Island, Ill., May 31, 1864.

Respectfully forwarded to Colonel William Hoffman, Commissary-General of Prisoners, with the remark that I have just returned from a careful inspection of the prison. I find the police and everything in excellent condition. The grounds outside the prison inclosure are being improved as fast as practicable. Received Friday morning 179 prisoners from Little Rock, per steamer, via Saint Louis; Saturday, 331 from Louisville per rail: all very dirty and badly clothed. Health of the Louisville squad, good; of the Little Rock squad, bad. A few cases of measles among the sick. The Thirty-seventh Iowa Regiment is ordered away; a 100-days' Illinois regiment is to take their place. This change will occur in a day or two. When it takes place this depot will be better garrisoned than at present.
