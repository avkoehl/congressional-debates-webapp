HEADQUARTERS,Port Hudson, La., March 16, 1863.

GENERAL: The enemy's fleet came up within range at 11 o'clock on the night of the 14th, and being discovered, made a terrific fight with my batteries from 11 until 2, attempting to pass seven vessels by. The result was the Hartford (flag-ship) passed with the gunboat Monongahela lashed on the far side. The Hartford was very much damaged. The frigate Mississippi was burned immediately opposite, and the frigate Richmond was badly crippled and had to fall back.

The fleet consisted of fourteen vessels, steam frigates, sloop of-war, gunboats, and mortar-boats, and all except the mortar-boats came within range. The firing was terrific for three hours. The enemy was very much damaged in all her vessels within range, and prisoners state that the loss much have been as much as 200. Our loss was 1 killed and 8 wounded.
