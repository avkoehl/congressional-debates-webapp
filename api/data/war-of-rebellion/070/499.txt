HEADQUARTERS HASKIN'S DIVISION,May 20, 1864.

Colonel MILLER:I send order from department headquarters for detail. Great Falls is on the Potomac, about ten miles from Fort ReNumbers The best route for the detail to take would be to strike the River road or the canal, and follow it up until it reaches Great Falls. I think there is a road leading from Tennallytown west direct to the River road. Once on the River road the route is plain. Subsistence can be drawn from the nearest commissary. Instruct the officer to use great vigilance in protecting these works.

Very respectfully,

R. CHANDLER,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
