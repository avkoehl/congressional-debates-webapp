General RAWLINS.

Chief of Staff, Armies of the United States:

GENERAL: In my opinion it is highly important to have an artillery officer of great experience and high attainments in charge of all the artillery on my line. I have no one to fill this position. Understanding that the Reserve Artillery of the Army of the Potomac is broken up, I would respectfully ask that Colonel Burton be ordered to report to me at once if consistent with the interests of the service.

Respectfully, &amp;c.

WM. F. SMITH.

Major-General, Commanding.

GENERAL: I have made all arrangements to take the hill in front of my left, which will save me from much annoyance if I succeed. I think I can do it without serious loss. The time appointed is 7 p.m., but learning that you are on the field I have judged best to defer to your judgment.
