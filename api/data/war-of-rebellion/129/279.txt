because I do not know that I shall have time to do it in the morning before the mail closes. *

I wrote you a pretty long letter day before yesterday, and feel no disposition to prolong the discussion. If after reading that you are still of the opinion that the act suspending the writ of habeas corpus in certain cases does not attempt to confer upon the President and others under him the power to arrest and to hold persons arrested without proper warrant under oath, a power that they could not exercise without it, then it is useless to say more; and after reading that letter and the order of General Cooper alluded to in it, you are still of the opinion that person liberty is not jeopardied by it, and that no blow is stuck by it at the very "vitals of liberty," then, indeed, you would not believe though one were to rise from the dead. So no more on those points.

I wish barely to say a few things on some other points. After speaking of the commendable tone of the Milledgeville speech you say, "Yet below the surface your antipathy to the President is perceptible to any one acquainted with your opinions of the man" (under-scoring mine), and on this point you say, "I think you had as well have fully unbottled you wrath; for, after all, you are as well understood, in the estimation of the country, to be hostile as if you had avowed it. " And you go on to say that I will necessarily be classed "with those whose palpable object it is to organize a party in opposition to the Administration," underscoring all mine; and further on you say that my antipathy to Davis has misled my judgment, or I have allowed my antipathy to him to mislead my judgment.

For your candor and frankness in all this I sincerely thank you, for it is conclusive evidence to me that such are your opinions, and I allude to these matters for the sole purpose of correction an erroneous impression on your mind.

I assure you I have no antipathy to Mr. Davis; nor am I hostile to him; and if there is an object or intention or wish with any to organize a party in opposition to the Administration, I know nothing o it- have heard nothing of it. As to the late movement on the action of Georgia upon the subject of the habeas corpus and the resolution in relation to the terms upon which peace should be sought, I think I know as much as anybody else. If any one is responsible for it, no one is ore so than myself. it is true that those resolutions were not drawn up by me, but they were prepared by Linton after full consultation; prepared at his house before he went to Milledgeville. And as for Mr. Davis or his Administration, they had but little to do with it-nothing in the world except in so far as they fall within the scope of the point as stated. they did not rise to the dignity of a moment's serious consideration or thought one way or the other. Greater objects by far were then engrossing my attention, and Linton's too, I think.

As for Mr. Davis, I repeat again I have no feeling of antipathy, much less hostility. What opinions you may think I entertain of him as you intimate I know not, but I have no hesitancy in stating to you freely and frankly, and most confidentially, what my opinions of him are. They are much more akin to suspicion and jealousy than of animosity or hate. While I do not and never have regarded him as a great man or statesman on a large scale, or a man of any marked genius, yet I have regarded him as a man of good intentions, weak and vacillating, timid, petulant, peevish, obstinate, but not firm.
