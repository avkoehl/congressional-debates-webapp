graph line between Sugar Loaf and myself is broken. At 10 o'clock this morning it is reported that enemy landed at Smithville in small boats and took possession. Small-arm firing heard in direction of Sugar Loaf. I have no communication from General Hoke. Last information received from General Simonton is that he was moving to this point on the Georgetown road. I have received to-day the Twenty-seventh South Carolina Regiment. I have visited Major-General Hoke to-day. I cannot assist him, nor can he assist me. I will await your orders or act in emergency.
