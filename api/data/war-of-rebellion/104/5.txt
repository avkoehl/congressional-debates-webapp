HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF KENTUCKY,Louisville, Ky., March 16, 1865.

ADJUTANT-GENERAL U. S. ARMY,

War Department:

SIR: The towns of Jeffersonville and New Albany, Ind., are opposite the city of Louisville and are, in fact, part of it. These towns formed part of the District of Kentucky, but are supposed not to be in the Department of Kentucky. For many reasons, I suggest that they be placed under my control. There are several hospitals and other public establishments there that can be much more easily and advantageously managed from here than from the headquarters of the Northern Department at Cincinnati. The proper police of the city of Louisville and the river makes such an arrangement necessary.

Very respectfully,

JOHN M. PALMER,

Major-General, commanding.
