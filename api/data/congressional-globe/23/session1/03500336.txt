THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
April 22,
possession of the bank be con eet, or nearly ao, the
condition of the currency is obviously such, that
the nation should not be content with it,nordesne
to continue it in its present state It is an immense
superstructure of paper, lestmg on a metallic foun-
dation too narrow to support it. It has never been
sustained by its own inherent strength, but by
public confidence. When every one firmly believes
that the notes of the banks will, on demand, be
paid m com, they readily circulate and answer all
the purposes of money. But the moment that
confidence is impaired, they lose their value as a
part of the circulating medium, and are returned
upon the banks for redemption in specie, and the
disproportion between the papei circulation and the
com prepared to redeem it, is so great, that it is
constantly liable to have it chief support, public
confidence, withdrawn from it.
In speaking of the dangers to which the cur-
rency is exposed, I do not mean to intimate that
the State banks are unable to pay the amount of
notes they have issued. On the contrary, I am
persuaded that, with very few exceptions, they
, are as safe as the Bank of the United Mates Por
that bank has never been in a condition to redeem
its notes in specie, if they were all suddenly thrown
back upon it. My object in inviting the attention
of the committee to this subject is, not only to
show the real condition of the currency, but to
maik the utter inconsistency of the argument,
which urges the recharterof the Bank of the Uni-
ted States, on the ground that it has furnished a
sound currency to the nation, and at the same
time attempts to disciedit the notes of the State
banks. Both parts of the argument cannot be
true. The Bank of the United Slates has not
furnished the nation witn a sound paper currency,
and has produced no salutaiy effect on the great
mass of it, unless the issues ot the State banks aie
now m a safe and healthy condition
The difficulty under which the State banks are
laboring at this time does not prove that they are
unsound, and that they have been worse managed
than the Bank of the United States, when reports
injurious to the credit of the State banks are in-
dustriously and widely circulated, some degiee of
embarrassment is unavoidable, especially when
it is generally supposed to be m the power of the
Bank of the United States to stop them at its
pleasure The evil is, howevei, in its nature,
temporary, and will soon pass away And the
intelligence of the citizens will readily discover
that the present difficulty is the offspring of use-
less alarnij and of a deliberate design to destroy
the credit of the ¡state banks. And when the real
object of the excitement, and unfounded íumors
which are daily circulated, shall be undei stood by
the people, confidence wnl soon be lestoied, and
business resume its usual channel. The stoppage
of a bank from any cause naturally pioduces a
run on the banks in its neighborhood, and if pains
are taken to increase the excitement and alaim,
the evil will be more extensively felt than it would
be in ordinary times.
The dangeVous expansion of the paper circula-
tion, compaied with its specie basis, shows that
there is something essentially vicious in the whole
system; and the mischief, so far from being cor-
rected o. lessened by a Bank of the United States,
is more probably aggravated by such an institu-
tion. The great amount of paper afloat proves
that the quantity depends moie on the discretion
and judgment of those who make the paper, than
on their ability to redeem it whenever it is called
for.
The dominion which a Bank of the United
States must always exercise over the smaller cor-
poiations of the States, vests in it the entire dis-
ci etion of expansion or contraction. If it discount
and i«sue its paper freely, the State banks are in-
duced, by the hopes of pi out, to follow its example
If it suddenly curtails, they must curta.l also, or
become the victims of then own imprudence And
if, by any means, the conduct of that bankdistmbs
the public confidence m the safety of the State
banks, their notes will be returned upon them with
such rapidity as to endanger even the best managed
institut.ons, and while such a power remains m
the hands of a single corpoiatton, the country will
be constantly l.abie to sudden agitations and ex-
citements from the alternate expansion and con-
tiaction of the currency; and those engaged in
commerce will, in the yeais of abundance, be led
into an extension of their business, which must, in
the succeeding years of scarcity, inevitably result
in bankruptcy and rum. In a time of pressure,
confidence is eas.ly shaken, and whenever it be-
comes the mterstof the Bank of the United States
to excite alarm in the country, its great money
power will most commonly enable it to effect the
object, and by destroying confidence and ciedit, in
a tew months throw the whole business of the
nation into confusion. A system of currency thus
liable to constantfluctuations,and always in danger
of being entirely overthrown, is eeitamly one of
the woist that can be devised. Every species of
property is unstable and insecure, unless the cur-
íency which is tobe exchanged for it shall be
steady in its value, and not liable to be seriously
disturbed by accident or design And the danger
and evil is abundantly manifested by the history of
the United States, since the establishment of the
present bank "V ears of hollow prosperity have
been succeeded by y earb of pi essure and suffering,
and thepiesent condition of things demonstrates
how leadily a concerted effort to excite a panic
and destroy confidence, may endanger the great
mass of the cnculating medium, and injure most
extensively the property and industry of the
country
The great evil of our present cuirency is the
disproportion between the paper in circulation and
the com prepared to redeem it. The remedy is,
to diminish this proportion, and to give to 'he
papei currency a broader and firmei metallic foun-
dation. Can this object be best accomplished with
or without a Bank of the United States >
I do not perceive that a Bank of the United
States, upon any plan, is likely to dimmish the
evil
It may perhaps be supposed that a restriction
on the bank, which would prevent it from issuing
notes below twenty dollars, would tend to ac-
complish the object But the cn'y effect of such
a restriction would be to substitute the notes of
State banks of the lower denominations, in the
place of the notes of the Bank of the United
States.
Gold andsilverwill never cuculate where banks
issue notes which come m competition with them
For it will invariably happen that when the circu-
lating medium is composed of diffeient kinds of
money, and one of them is less valuable than the
other, but not sufficiently depreciated to be discred-
ited, the infeuor will, aftei a time, become the
genera' cuirency, snd the more valuable will
entnely dis.apf.eai. This <s obviuiis m the Slates
where the banks issue notes as low as one dollar.
For silvei dolíais are never found" in cnculation
wlieie papei ones are freely issued by the banks
in order, therefoie, to bring the precious metals
into use, the rivalship of paper must be effectually
taken away. We must not only íemove the notes
of the Bank of the United States, but also the notes
of the State banks
And to create a Bank of the United States, and
restrict its issues, as above suggested, would be
to invite the State banks to issue largely that
description of paper which will not be interrupted
by the competition of the Bank of the United
States The paper cnculation would not be dimin-
ished, nor would the propoitiou of the metals be
incieased. Paper dollars would still be manufac-
tured in the same abundance, they would still come
in competition with gold and saver, and drive them
fiom cnculation
The restriction therefore on the issue of the
smaller notes, cannot be effectual, unless the sev-
eral States shall be willing to coopcra'e with the
legislation of Congress They could hardly be
expected toprornbittheissue of notesunder twenty
dollars by their banks, whilea Bank of the Uni'ed
States was in existence with all the advantages it
would possess overthe State institutions And if
they could be induced to unite in ¡such a plan, the
inevitable result would be to put an end to the
S'ate banks, foi their circulation cf laiger notes
would be so much restrained by the competition
and superior advantiges of the notes of the Bank
of the United States, tint the small State corpma-
tions would probably soon find their charters of no
value, and be compelled to wind up their concerns
The field for paper currency would then be left
entuely to the Bank of the United States    Then-
notes being receivable everywhere m payment for
debts due the Government, would give them a
credit beyond their iea! value. The temptation
under such circumstances to over-issues of paoer
would be almost inesistible And after closing,
by thiscouise of legislation, the Joois of the State
banks, we should soon f nd ourselves with a paper
currency equally liable to depreciation with the
present one, from thegreatdispioportion the paper
would bear to the specie provided to redeem it.
In a plan which would lead to such results, we
could hardly expect the States to come in aid of
the legislation of Congress, but we might count
on their cordial ccopeiation in efforts to place the
wnole circulating medium of the country on a safe
and duiable foundation, when it can be aonewith-
out injustice to their own citizens who are inter-
ested in the State institutions
The first step towaids a sound condition of the
cuirency is, to reform the coinage of gold. The
piesentgold comismoiem silver than its nominal
value It is therefore never seen in the ordinary
exchanges of the country, and it is worse than
useless to continue the expense of coming it at the
Mint, unless it is intended for circulation It will
never make its way into geneiel circulation, until
the íelative value of silvei and gold is obseievd.as
near as may be, in the pieces coined of the respect-
ive metals. It has been tiuly said that gold is the
antagonist of paper Silver is too heavy to be
tiansported fiom place to place, in large sums,
without inconvenience Some othei circulating
medium of general currency io therefore necessary,
even for the expenn.es of a journey fiom one State
to anothei There must be eithei a paper curren-
cy of geneial ciedit, or gold must be introduced
And it is essential that in its standard value as
coin, it should be placed on its proper footing in
lelat on to silver, before a paper currency of gen-
eral credit can be conveniently dispensed with.
The charter of the Bank of the United States, by
making its paper receivable everywhere for debts
due to the Government, furnishes a paper currency
not equal to gold or silver, but yet of sufficient
credit for common use, and for the purposes of
travelling from place to place This will continue
urtd the 3d of Maich, 1836 It is desirable, there-
fore, that piovision should be made at the present •
session of Congress for the reform of the gold
coins The coinage will require time, and as this
general paper cunency is gradually retiring from
circulation, the gold should be prepaied to takeits
place. We produce gold to a large amount in the
United States, and the product is increasing every
yeai. Tne greater part oi it is now exported as
bullion, and this will continue to be the case until
the value of the gold com is changed. Even if the
change should be made at the piesent lession,
theie would not, perhaps, be a sufficient supply of
our own gold coins to meet the demand for a cir-
culating medium of general credit, at the expira-
tion of the charter of the bank But if foreign
gold coins should be made a legal tender at then-
real value, there would doubtless be enough of that
metal, at the time above mentioned, to meet the
wants of the public And there can be no suffi-
cient reason for throwing out of cnculation the
foreign coins of gold or silver, which are current
in other paits of the commercial world. Indeed,
as a measure of immediate relief in the present
state of things, it is necessary that the foreign
coins, both of gold and silver, should be made a
legal tender, in payment of debts, according to
their intrinsic value Very large importations of
the foreign coins are continually arriving in the
United S ates, and if they can be used by the
State bonks to discharge their engagements, they
will probably remain here, and become a part of
our circulating medium And jf they were made
a legal tender in payment of debts, it would enable
the State banks to extend their issues,and to íedeem
their notes with greater facility. I respectfully
invite the eaily attention of Congress to this sub-
jectand regard theproposed alteration in our laws
as peculiarly necessary in the present exigency,
and calculated to produce immediate and extensive
benefit As the Bank of the United States with-
draws i s circulation, it is of the first importance
that the State banks should be enabled to extei d
their issues and to supply immediately, by their
notes, the place which v/as filled by the Bank of
the United States.
