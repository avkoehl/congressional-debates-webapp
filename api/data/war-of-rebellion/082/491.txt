HEADQUARTERS TENTH ARMY CORPS, July 26, 1864.

Brigadier-General WEITZEL:

I have received the orders from department headquarters relieving the battalion of Massachusetts cavalry serving at these headquarters under Major Stevens, and ordering it to report to the lieutenant-colonel of the regiment. The battalion has but about 120 men mounted, and those hardly sufficient for the orderly duty which is necessary to keep up communication along my very extended line and to furnish a very moderate provost guard and escort. I respectfully ask that the mounted moderate provost guard and escort. I respectfully ask that the mounted force be left until relieved by a squadron, otherwise I shall be without a mounted man.

D. B. BIRNEY,Major-General, Commanding.

The commanding general directs me to say to you the intention of that order is not to remove that squadron of cavalry from its present position or duty, only to make written reports to the lieutenant-colonel for organization. Major Ludlow, inspector of cavalry, will be over to-morrow to explain to you.

Respectfully,

G. WEITZEL,

Brigadier-General.
