HARPER'S FERRY, VA., March 23, 1865.

General MORGAN,

Chief of Staff:

I consider Loundon County in the Department of West Virginia when we occupy it. The Twenty-fifth New York Cavalry have reported and have relieved First Maryland. First Maryland has gone to Duffield's. One hundred and ninety-fifth and One hundred and ninety-second Pennsylvania will report to General Egan to-morrow. Second U. S. Cavalry arrived at Point of Rocks to-day. Nothing further from Reno himself. A man from Harmony came in with body of Lieutenant Chase. Says Reno moved on toward Upperville yesterday morning; that Mosby collected about 200 of his men and followed Reno up.

Respectfully,

JOHN D. STEVENSON,

Brigadier-General.
