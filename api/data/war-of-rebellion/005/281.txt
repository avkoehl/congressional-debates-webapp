of ammunition, tents, clothing, &amp;c., on the route, besides the evidences of the destruction of a much greater portion; that when from the unknown and difficult nature of the country some twenty hours had elapsed before his retreat was assured, and without which we did not feel it safe to pursue him to his works at Dickerson's farm (since found it to be of the strongest character for field works) with my force, then of less than 2,000, and not one-half of the least of his supposed numbers, he wa most vigorously followed up by my command through rain and storm and much till overtaken at about 18 miles from the camp he left, and the heavy force of his rear guard was there routed and further camp equipage taken after another action, by which his train was still kept in advance o us, and the pursuit was still continued until, from the difficult nature of the defile beyond, the breaking of bridges, &c., our exhausted forces needed to rest for the night, when we were recalled by the orders of General Schenck; and this was accomplished with the loss of 1 man killed and 4 wounded on our part in the fight at Lauler Creek and none at the affair at McCoy's Mill, while it is certain that the loss of the enemy was three times that amount, including that of their chief colonel of cavalry killed, and Floyd was pursued for about 30 miles from his batteries of Gauley Bridge, and driven, as was ascertained, to Raleigh, and for some 9 miles father than our last bivouac.

I can only add, in conclusion, that had I not been ordered to return, and had forces which were sent over the river been moved up to Keton's to support me, as I asked by a courier that evening that they should be, we could have moved forward to Raleigh to-day, as I intended, and, as I am well satisfied, captured that place and depot with their train, and certainly routed, if not captured, the whole of Floyd's force..

I have now but to report the noble conduct of the forces during the most toilsome march, where through all their great exposure in the storm upon the route, and in bivouac, without shelter against the rain or snow that fell in each of the last three nights, not a murmur was heard by me, but every duty was performed with the greatest cheerfulness and alacrity. And the Principal officers of the command were worthy of the men they led. Of Colonel W. S. Smith, commanding the Thirteenth Regiment, I have frequently expressed my opinion in my report of the battle of Carnifix Ferry, and all there stated was here more than confirmed. Colonel White, of the Twelfth Regiments, who has recently been promoted, and made the most praiseworthy and successful efforts for the discipline of his regiment of fine men, did not behave less nobly than if he had been fully in most successful battle, by yielding as he did to the exigencies of the occasion a desire with much of equity in it, which was shared by himself and his men, to lead the advance of the march. Colonel Woods, of the U. S. Army, at this time acting in command of the Tenth Regiment, led that regiments in advance at a rapid and safe pace at the latter part of the march on the 14th with great good judgment and gallantry, and Captain Schneider, of the rifled artillery of the Thirteenth Regiment, a very gallant and deserving officer, was not prompt and successful in the management of his guns. Captain McMulin, though his howitzers were not brought into in action, was prompt and ready at every point on the march, as he is ever at every call of duty, and Lieutenant-Colonel Creighton, of the Seventh, executed the maneuver from our right flank which decided the route at McCoy's Mill in most gallant style; the Forty-fourth, under its very effective officer, Major Mitchell, not having the opportunity of participating in the action, as well as the Thirty-seventh regiment, from their position in the rear.
