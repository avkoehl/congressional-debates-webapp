HEADQUARTERS FOURTH CORPS,Near Seven Pines, May 30, 1862-8 a. m.

Brigadier General R. B. MARCY,

Chief of Staff:

I expect to send a report to-day on the falling off of General Casey's division. One great cause was the rawness of his troops. At my final survey of my position last night I passed 100 yards beyond the point where Major Kelly fell in the morning, and I saw many rebel pickets. At the same time the enemy remained in line of battle on my right, and was found by two scouting parties on the left. The enemy is found all round a semircircle described with a radius of two miles from my headquarters as a center.
