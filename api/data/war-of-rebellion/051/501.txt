brigade retired back to the woods, procured ammunition, and took position in line on the left of Roberton's brigade.

Here, on receiving an order from Brigadier-General Johnson, the brigade (under Colonel Coleman, upon whom the command had devolved), advanced forward and to the left about half a mile to the support of Johnson's brigade, which was supporting Robertson's battery, which was stationed on the brow of a hill to the right of the Lookout Valley road, at which point the force there were resisting with difficulty the determined advance of the enemy in heavy force. In a few minutes General Johnson ordered our advance, when, passing the line immediately supporting the battery (which line also advanced), we charged over the hill upon the enemy, and after a protracted and obstinate resistance (a brigade on our right and Minigault's brigade on the ridge to our left advancing on parallel lines to us), the enemy were completely driven from the position. In this conflict we suffered much from a flanking fire, arising from tardy support on our left.

The artillery (Captain Culpeper), having assisted in repulsing the enemy, at 9.30 a.m. was placed in position by General Law with his battery, and remained there during the day.

I have great pleasure and pride in saying that the whole brigade behaved most nobly during all the fighting of both days, being uniformly in advance of all others in every onset. Its losses and its trophies bear ample testimony to its good conduct. In another report I propose to particularize individual instances.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

D. COLEMAN,

Colonel, Commanding Brigade.
