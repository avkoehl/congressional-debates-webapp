Duel Reports—Mr. TUlinghast.
H. of Reps,
ltbertiesand the safety of (he republic, we have neither schools
«sujUshedfor theu uistiuction wor provision made by law ior
establishing them as <_ «joined by the Constitution I have no
means ol ascei taming, but am inclined to the opinion that 80,000
are entirely unmstruoted "
Pennsylvania hasadopted withm the last three or foui years
a more liberal sv stem of public instruction and, in that brief
period, the benefit have been beyond ail annexation And
never was a system more zealously opposed Dun rig the con
fltct anaína out of thn meastup, it was my fortune to travel
through the greater part oí that State, and I di«coveiul that those
poitiona of the &ta e most unmiormed, and requiring in the
greatest degree education, weie most zealously hostile to it
They enlarged upon taufóand taxes, and weie vehementm
denunciations
It was then that the truth of the remark of Pr Chalmeis
forced conviction upon my mind,(i that the mappetence of o
people for education is in the exact ratio of its i¡?noiance "
Whdthds been the effect of that system? Fiomthe repoitof
Mr Borrows Supanntendent of Education, to the Lesnslatuie
of Pennsyhamx, Febiuarv 7, 183S, we find ' that the whole
number ofscl o us taushtduung theyeai in the d s nets which
repotted, was 1*2,355 " The whole mimbei of young j eicon°,
between fivoani fifteen > ear*, of a^c, m the distnctsthat rep nt
ed, is supposed to be about 200,000
" So far i<j be letuins have been received, the who e num
ber taught in schools of all kind", in ti e ..ame distucts, befoie
the adoption ofthe system, was80 OOU "
Ihen it appears that in the short mteival Horn the adop ion
of the measure to the pie-,uit time, more than 10Ü 0J0 children
ale now leceivmg the advantages of education, who othcivuse
would have giown up in degiadmg ignorance
The measure of public education, which was at the moment
•f its adoption so unpopulai, is now in those veiy re ton's
hailed as the greatest public blessing, whieh proves conclusive
ly another fact, that, whatever may be the piejudn.es ag mist a
liberal system of education, when once adupo, Í, he who wo i d
then oppose U would make himself infinitely mort unpopulai m

As hi Stale Govemme us, so in theíNauona1 piejudices m ly
