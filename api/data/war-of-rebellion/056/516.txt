CORINTH, December 27, 1863.

General GRIERSON:

My command is just coming in. I cannot get to Ripley without going as far as Pocahontas by rail. The Hatchie is impassable. Where is the enemy?

J. K. MIZNER,

Colonel, Commanding Brigade.

CORINTH, December 27, 1863.

General GRIERSON:

Cypress Creek, as well as the Hatchie, is impassable. Inform me at what point you want my brigade. I can get railroad transportation here, and have my animals rested. When I arrive can save a day by taking the railroad, and it will be as easy to load here as anywhere else.

J. J. MIZNER,

Colonel, Commanding Brigade.

LA GRANGE, December 27, 1863.

Colonel MIZNER,

Corinth:

The enemy have just attacked La Fayette; don't know their force. Come west along the railroad as far as you can and report to me at the stations as you come. Will try to cross you over the Hatchie when you arrive there.

B. H. GRIERSON,

Brigadier-General.

LA GRANGE, December 27, 1863.

Colonel W. H. MORGAN,

Commanding Third Brigade, Cavalry Division:

You will press forward with your command as rapidly as possible to La Fayette, running the train as far as is safe. You will attack the enemy vigorously wherever you may find him. The Ninth Illinois Cavalry is already on the road with four pieces of artillery.

By order of Brigadier General B. H. Grierson:

S. L. WOODWARD,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

[DECEMBER 27, 1863.]

Colonel W. H. MORGAN,

Get your command on the cars immediately and move west. The rebels are attacking La Fayette.
