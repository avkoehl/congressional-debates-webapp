night in front of Wood, on Crittenden's left. He is apparently disposed to dispute passage of Shields' Gap. We are still without information of Longstreet's arrival.

CRAWFISH SPRING, September 17-5 p.m.

There are pretty clear indications that the rebels are massing their forces about Rock Spring Church, east of Pigeon Mountain, between Shields' and Catlett's Gaps. A body of rebel infantry and cavalry has just come into this valley by way of Dug Gap, and the rebel column reported in my dispatch of this morning continues to raise a cloud of dust on the road between Shields' Gap and Ringgold.

Reports that Longstreet has reached Atlanta begin to come in from various sources. A rebel deserter reported this morning at Chattanooga that some of Burnside's cavalry were at Cleveland on 15th, but nothing positive reaches us from Burnside. His forces needed here.

CRAWFISH SPRING, September 18-12 p.m.

Rebel cavalry and infantry are appearing along front of Wood, whose division holds Crittenden's left, and on right of Van Cleve, who holds Crittenden's center. Apparently it is a reconnaissance in force, but everything is ready for serious attack. Our position is excellent, with West Chickamauga River in front of greater part of our lines. Minty's cavalry and Wilder's mounted infantry on left flank, and on right two divisions cavalry under Mitchell, who succeeds Stanley, the latter being very sick. Thomas with the central corps is moving down the Chickamauga in this direction,and McCook, whose troops have all got over into this valley, except one brigade yet on Lookout Mountain, is closing up on Thomas' right. Sky cloudy, thermometer 62; perfect day for fighting. Nothing from Burnside; his cavalry at Cleveland, reported yesterday, were only scouts sent out from Byrd's brigade, which has been at Athens some time.

CRAWFISH SPRING, September 18-5 p.m.

Rebel demonstration to-day proves to have been reconnaissance in force. Some 10,000 men of all arms were engage. They felt our line along Wood's position on Crittenden's left, exchanging a few shots, and attacked Minty and Wilder with vigor, compelling them to retire west of Chickamauga. Casualties not yet reported.
