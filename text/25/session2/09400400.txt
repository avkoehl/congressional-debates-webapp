Iu t' s I have obe ed tuem fairlv,  yet, a'th ugh I

instructed "to   oteitrsucn a  mode of receiving,

Go     nr ent     Thu<.,  whilst  I  «33 instructed to
vote against the Sub Tr°asuiy bill, I was equally
ii struc ed to vote to" some other measure distinct
from the creotu n of Sub-Treasunes, which would
separate the banks from the Government as far as
piacticable    This  is V/hat my amendment pro-
poses, but candor compels mc to confess that, with-
out any instructions upon the suhjeet,I should hue
left mvself bound to move this amendment after
the defeat of the Sub-Treasury b 11 in the House,
because I think Congress ought not to adjourn and
leave the Treasury Department  wilheut any Ian
whatever to shield and to direct its proceedings
What is the present state of the case? A t the
called session in September last, the Sub Treasury
bni r?= passed by tne Senate Whilst it «a  uu
iloi discussion hete, I made a speech m its favor,
and exerted myself to the utmost of my feeble abili-
t es to secure us passage What was, at that time,
its faff in fie House' it «is laid upon the table by
am joriyot (we've votes
My opm i)n^ tin n unon the subject are rnv opi-
nions no . They have not changed in any p u-
ticular I should have again, at the present ses-
sion, advocan d and supported the passage of tne
Sub Treasury bill, had I not been prevented by my
instructions
It parsed the Sena e a eoond tme, wnhiut tie
spe. ie restrictu i, and was again Hid upon th  ta
ble of the House The House have since coesider-
el their own bil' which contained the specie clause
o igmal y mtiojueed on the motion of the Senator
tiom S mth Caro'im [Mr Calhocn,] and it has
been direnh negativd by a majority of fourteen
votes We cannot th refot-e, hope th-it this or an)
o hei similar bi 1 will become i law ' ring the ex-
istence of t! e present Con~ress, which will not em-
pire unnl the ft urth of M^tch next The subject
is, iherefore, necessarily postponed until the m°et-

süre, make no attempt to pass any olher, but le ie
all the puolic money for the next eighteen months
to be managed without law, at the mere discretion
of the Secretary of the Treisury? I am not one ot
those who can arrive at any such conclusion The
people of this country expect that Congress mil,
before its adjournment, adtpt some measure to
■separate tne money of the Government from the
business of bank , and at the same lime direct by
law m what manner it shall be kept and disbursed
by the Secretary of the Treasury It would, in my
judgment, be suicidal, in a party point of view, to
go home without making ary further effort to settle
this perplexing question Tne President, la bis

wishes of the great mass of our constituents
Now, what is the plain meimrg of ihis extract
from the President'^ message' He prefers the
Sub Treasury system, hut if thct should not suc-
ceed, he still urgently recommends the settlement of
the question, if possible, at the present session He
then suggests the keeping of the public money in
the State banks on special deposite, as ih<- next al-
ternative, and states that it is, to some extent, in
accordance w th the practice ot the Government
and the present arrmgement of the Treasury De
partment. A'though the Sub Treasury plan is his
'tstchoce, yet he «avs, it must be admitted that
the special deposit  bystein would, in a great de-
gree, accomplish the sep **ation of the fiscal con-
cerns of the Government from those of individu-
als oi corporations Now, my amendment is
based upon these very pune pies thus recommend-
ed by the President
Most heartily do I concur with him m these
opinion , and I entirely dissent trom those who
believe it to beourbest and wisest policy to separate
anu go home, leaving the entile subject itndei the
control of the Secretan of the Trcasmy, wi'houtany
regulation by la  There miv h* a d fference or
opinion on this question among the fr ends of the
Administration The altt rnptive nreser ted is, shall
we now do nothing—shall we go before the o°o i'e
and agilate the Su^ Treasurv quest on, until the
cumriencement ol the next Congress, in Decem-
ber, 1839, or shad we enact some temponry mea-
sure which will secure the grtat pnnciplc of sepa-
ration, and put the question at rest ft r th" present'
There are sume convictions upon nv mind so «trong,
that [ almost fet] ihcm to be intuitive tru lis This
ore is aiiong the number 1 feel that the most
dar"'iOiis course we can pursue, is to fold our
arms and dtlPrnm  to do nothing, merely bcciuse
we have not been able to do every thug To an-
nounce to the Ameiican people, that, aUhru;h v e
have been placed bv mem at tie hem, ir<d
are responsib'e to thccountiv for the management
of the vessel, yet thpt ve will not c "« nt to gam
the haven of safety, unless we can reach it bv
cne predetermined com e Shill we asu pouimg
shall wt accpt nothing, b"ciusc we caniot rbtain
all w e desire1* O her genfemen may v ish 11 f line
such an issue, and go before the people ivuh tt for
their determinaticn I feel confident it would not
be i avorably responde I to by the sober and reflect-
ing citizens of Pennsj Ivania
What is now the law m regard to the safe-keep-
ing of the public money1* The old act of the 2d
September, 1789, to establish the Treasury Depart-
ment, passed nearly fifty years ago, is the only law
upon that subject now m full Torce. It simply pro-
vides, in general terms, that the Treasurer o£ the
United States shall receive, keep, and disburse the
public money- This act was pasted in,hard money
times, and evidently contemplated that nothing ex-
^ep" current coin was to be received into the Trea-
suiy. This is evident from its whole tenor, as well
as from a single provision. The Treasurer is
obliged at all limes to submit to the Secretary of
the Treasury, or the Comptroller, the inspection of
the monej s in hi hand". This act was framed to
meet the s'ate of things which existed at the origin
of the Government, and is wholly inadequate to the
present circumstances of the country.
Under the joint resolution of 1816, the notes of
specie pav ing banks are now receivable in payment
of tne puHic dues     When the banks shall resume
specie payments, by far the greaterpoition of our
revenue will be collected  in  bank notes     After
they reach the Treasury,  what is" the Secretary to
do with them?   There is now no law upon the sub-
ject     Every thing is left to his dissretion     Ought
tins to be the case under any free Government'
How can  those who dread Executive discretion
rest contented without attempting to remedy this
evil?   In  my opinion, the enemies út the present
Administration o ght to desire nothing more ar-
dently than to leave things just as they are.   There
will then be nothing but agitation throughout the
country.   As often as the Secretary, m his discre-
tion, shall present these bank notes to be cashed,
so often w ill the banks raise a clamor that it has
been done in hostility to them, and without neces-
sity—that it is an abuse of his -discretion    Con-
stant complaints against the Administration will be
echoed  and  re-echoed  throughout ihe country.
Every sort of attack which political  malice can
dittate, will be made upon it fiom some quarter oi
other.   The Secretary will be accused ot hostility
against some batiks, and favont sm towards others-
It wil  i e imposible for him to pursue any course
whatever without subjecting himself and the Ad-
ministiation to unmerited reproach    Is it right,
then, for us who are friends of the Administration
to go home, having made no attempt to reguiate by
law the manner in which the Sccietary shall dis-
pose of these bank notes after they reach the Trea
sury?   Will the people rest satisfied with this de-
termination, and ctfnsider it a sufficient excuse for
our omission of every other doty, that we have not
been able to pass the Sub-Treasury bill?
Now, sir, the amendment which I propose
amounts to little more than p legal sanction of the
present practice of the Treasury Department The
Secretary of the Treasury, for the sike of security,
now keeps special deposites of gold and silver in
certain banks The President, in the extract from
lus Message, which I have already read gives us
this information, and I have since heard it from
otner sources entitled to all confidence The Sub-
Treasury bill ,tself provided for such spec al depo-
sites of gold and silver m Sta e banks everyr where,
except at the five c six points wheie we had mints,
or weie to have receivers geneial That bill,
Iherefore, as well as tne practice of the Ireasury,
sanctions those special deposites Why not, ther,
if guíate tKm, and place ihem underlie protection
of law? Wh' not adopt tn s alternative, recom-
mended by the Pre ! lent, for the saft keeping of the
public monej'
The first section of my amendment is exch sively
co fined to spec, e It simplv reqnues the collectors
ard receiver", urder the dir etion of the Treasury
Department, to make special deposites with the
b-uiks, foi sife-ktepmg, of the balances remaining
in then han^ at leact once in sixty days, and as
much c tener as the security cf the public rponey
mov íriKu necias ry Tbe rest is chiefly detail,
md merety reguhtes ihe manner in which these
banks shall be sheeted, and their du'ies p rrormed
It is nothing more than to sanction the use of the
vaults of these banks, as being more secure than
the private houces of the collectors and receivers
Of course, fiom the very nature of a special depo-
site, it is impossible that the hanks can ever use
this gold and silver for their enn benefit, in any
manner whatever.
The second section provides first, that the bank
