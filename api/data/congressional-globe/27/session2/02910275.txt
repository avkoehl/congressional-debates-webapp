came he believed the office of postmaster to be highly neces-
sary
Mr B asked the Clerk to read one of the resolutions—that
which related to stationery—in oid°r tha* the Hoiise might see
what duties were assigned to this officei under it
tThe Clerk here read the 8th resolution of the series reported
by the committee,j"
Mr B proceeded to remark that it would thus be seen that, in
addition to the present duties imposed on the postmaster, the
committee proposed to assign to him the duty of keeping an ac
count oí the stationery delivered to each membei,&c If the
House concunpd with the committee as to the propriety of
adopting that resolution, they must, as the gentleman from New
York (Mr Bowne] had justly remarked, provide another off]
cer to attend to that duty, if the office of postmaster should be
abolished And as the number ot clerks had already been re
duced to ten, (which was the lowest number to which, in his
judgment, they could be reduced, in justice to the business of
the House,) the HoLse co ild nof chaige them with this addi
tional business The abolition of the office of postmaster would
be attended with an inconvenience so great as to be felt imme
diately by every member of the House He hoped the amend-
ment would not prevail
Mr EVERETT suggested (as the Reporter understood) the
necessity of pioviding some substitute before the Hou&e abo
lished the office of postmaster In hi? view that officer was in
dispeneably necessary to the convenience of the House
Mr W SMITH thought if their pi edecc=sors had done with-
out the aid of a postmaster, they ought to dispense with it too
But it was said that it was necessary to have a substitute, but
before the postmaster was appointed was it found necessary to
have a substitute? The truth was, the membeis of the House,
as far as his experience went, were too little m the habit of
waiting on themselves He conceived there would be no dif
ficultymthe distribution of their documents, and he had no
doubtthat a veiy efficient economy might be prac ised He
was astonished to hear any gentleman o i that floor object to
this retrenchment, because it was a small matter Tt was by
items that the exoendituieg of the countrv had been swollen m
until they excited the astonishment of the whole peop'e He
trusted the amendment would be adopted
Mr CAVE JOHNSON thought, he said, that by loa ling the
resolutions of the committee down with proposition after pro*
pos tion the Rous'* would defeat the *vno]e object in view Let
the subject matter of the post office and its arrangements under
go the investigation, an 1 he would \ote cheerfully lor any
change or refoi m which appeared proper
Mr HOPKINS said he was veiy unwilling to protract this
debate, but notwithstanding his reluctance, lie was compelled
to throw himself once more upon the kind indulgence oí the
committee, to say a word ortw > in reply to the remarks of the
gentleman from New Yom [Mr Bowne ] That gentleman
had thought piopei to character ze the amendment proposed
by his colleague as contemplating a picayune reform, and
seemed to intimate that trnse who advocated it did so from a
desire to appear on paper as the friends oí refoim Now, sir,
(said Mr H ) I de ire to say to that g<ntleman that the rule
which I have piescribed for the i emulation of my public con
duct, is to practise here upon the professions which I have ever
made to those whose servant I am proud to be, and whi's' he
professed to entertain as much respect foi the intelligence of the
people a*, that gentleman does he was ready to abide their j tig
ment, whenever the gentleman may choo&e to invoke it, upon
the propriety of the am ndment which he has thus chaiaote
rized My desre (said Mr H ) is so to appear on paper as to
practise upon my prei epi* and he was iu dy to abide t'ie\ei
diet of his constituents  upon the vote waich lit should give upon
the question under consideration
I do not, sir, profess tobe m any degree indifferent to the ap
probation and good opinion of my constituents No, air theie
is no earthly consideration moiedearfo my heait, and nomtima
tion as to the motives of his conduct here could either lessen or
impair that feeling, or deter him fiom the faithful pQiformance
of his duty to them Us had bng thought and s ill thought,
that the post office of th s House migh be a tohshed without
detriment to the pubic sei vice an 1 entertaining that opinion,
he should vote for the amendment, and sh juld be gratihf d by its
adoption
Mi CUSHfNG saiditwas admittel on all hand  that there
was satisfaction wi h the postmaster and the manner iti which
he discharged bis duties Tht. question tht- afore ha I no
thing peisonal in it, out it was Mmply a question of e onnmy
as it was called, or expediency, ot the part of th s House and
aa such it was pioposed to atniie.h he office oí postmastei of
this House
There were as gentlemen all knew certain mechanical la
lois to be done at the post oftict He dil not under taidthe
gentleman fio-n ISew York [Mi Flovd] as piopo«ngio du
these labors himself Some one thereiore had j et to be got to
do tt It was proposed not to ^ay the postmaster todo it,
but to abolish that office, and since they had yet to pay some
one, he supposed the reform would turn nut to be nothing
at all And the qresdon now turned to be, whether this
labor should be paid lor heie, or paid for at the other end of the
Inthisview Mr C stion^Iy opposed the amendment Their
constituents he said, did not e^pectofthem to «trip themselves
of ad all facilities pi opei to the cli¡>chdre;eof then public luties
Why not, on the same pn ciple in pur nit of a mere phantom,
black their owi boots wash then own clothe , and cook
then own dinners'* Foi, according to the pnnciole heie
advocated it wii veiy u repu ¡¡can to shift off t e cook

the true field
As a general ru e that was a i i&t econiry which ex¡end
ed money foi worthy object*5, and all uthei eco íomy he le m
diated
Mr GORDO \T was in fav( r he said of tae amendment P
did not follow that if the office of po&tma->ter was dispensed
with, the House would have to employ any body else The very
reason on which the amendment wau ba^e'was, hattnepoot
roaster was an unnecessary officer—that the House might not
to employ hira, that he ought not to be paid at the public ex
pense
The gentleman from Massachu=>etts [Mr Cushing] had said
that the members might as well be called upon to black their
own boots, wash their own clothes, or cook then own dinners,
as perform the mechanical labor sought to be imposed upon
them?   But who, Mr G would ask, paid for all these things'?
Mr CTJSHIrsG (Mr G yielding the floor for the purpose)
explained He said that upon a'l ti ese pioposed retiench
ments in the House he, Mr C was willing to meet the gentle
men from New York He Mr C wa* íeady at any time to
vote for a bill to abolish both the pay ard mileage of Mem
bers of Congress This, if the country desired it, he was ready
toc'o
Mr GORDO NT resumed The gent'eman told the House
what he was willing to do hereafter The House wa¿> now en
gaged on matters of practical retrenchment and reform He
(Mr G ) wanted to see what the gentleman would do now, not
what he would do hereafter The ' race was not to the swift,
nor the bat* le to the strong," and they would see who would
hold out the longest in pmsuwg what the gentleman had
pleased to call * a phantom "
Why phould they have a post office here? Was theie not
one in the city of Washington not only for the citizens but for
members of Congress? In other cities, merchants either had to
go to the post office for their letter , or to pay the penny post,
and were members of Congress to enjoy peculiar privileges, or
advantages superior to the people at large? Must they have
servants for which they must not pay but which were tobe
charged to the people? Now he proposed that each should
pay the penny post for himself, to carry their letteis, as they
paid for blackmgtheir boots, or cooking their dinners
Mr PUSHING    Agreed
Mr GORDON proposed to retain the two clerks, because he
thought they were necessary, and he went against the Post
master because he conceived him to be unnecessary Another
reason why he opposed power being gi/en to the clerk to em
ploy two lepiities was, that he wished that power to be íetam
ed by the House, but he was not to oppose all reforms because
he opposed the discharge of two useful and necessary clerks,
and he wished to know why members of Congress were to be
privileged with a special post office Were gentlemen too idle
to walk to the post office, m a central position in tne city? He
thought a little exercise would be beneficial to them, both in
tellectnally and physically These were his views on this par
titular branch of leform, and when they came to the largei
itemsof reform, as he tiusted theyshould at an early period of
this session, he would meet the challenge of the gentleman trom
Massachu°etts
Mr MORGAN (remarking that some gentlemen seemed to
be under the erroneous impression that the post office wa«of
recent origin) called for the reading of the note to rule 75 [of
the edition published at the commencement of the present ses
slon ] which was lead as   follow*
"Immediately after the oigamzation of the Government under
the present Constitution a room was set apart in the Capitol for
the reception and distribution of letters and packets to and
fiom Members ofthe House without an order for thaifpurpose,
and was called the Post Office It was su penntended by i he
Doorkeeper and his assistants On the 9th of April, 1814 a
special allowance was made to the Doorkeeper to meet the ex
pensesofthis office, and he was authorized to appointa post
master The office continued on this footing till April 4, 1838,
when an order was pasted, as above, for the appointment of a
Po^tmaotei by the House itself "
Mr MORGAN (oh.eivmg thit the HJirne i! this debate
was continued, would *oon spend as much money as the sa
lary of the postmaster would amount to) moved the previous

When the committee robe last evening, the pending nti/stioflr
wasonanappealtakenby Mr G Davis from the !e|i£ionof
the Chair, by which the following amendment to the Mroviso
heretofore appended to the 15th item of the bill had wen de
clared to be out of order, on the-ground that it proposed a
change m the existing law
"And all other job punting, binding, and stationery m aw
way touching the Departments, or any business connected with
them, shall iu like manner be let in the same way by the officer
hdvmg the chai ere of the same, and the laws> of the United
States, and alladvertisements and other pnntirg pertaining to
the public service, to be done m any newspaper, shall be printed
and published in the newspaper or newspapers of the place
w here such publication may be made having the largest num-
ber of subscribers, to be verified by the affidavit of the editor
or editors of the paper making such publication, and also ofthe
editors of such other papers as may propose to make the
me "
1 And provided, further, That nothing herein contained «ball
be construed to repeal *he provision of any existing law which
authorizes the Secretacy of State to diseontiuue the publication
of the laws in any newspaper for cause, and which forbids
again the employment of the proprietor oí any newspaper po
discontinued to publish the lawsof the United States "
And the question now recurring, "Shall the decision of the
Chair etind as the judgment ofthe committee?"
Mr ATHERTON observed that before the committee rose
last night, he made the attempt to get the floor, m order to eay
a few words on the decision of the Chair, which he deemed
erroneous, and which was mist important mils bearings and
effect, and if sustained, would operate most injuriously in pre
venting all salutary reforms by way of amendment He ceuld^
haidly concur in the opinion expressedbythe gentleman from
Ohio, that they were all now pti feuly free from party feelmffei,
when he adverted to the fact, that on a question of order, party
topic*  had been brought into the discussion He certainly
should not, on the present occasion, say an> thing of that cha-
íacter,nor comment on these criminations and recrimination 
which had been introduced in the debate Ihe question was
not whether they could more conveniently or more speedily
pitsb this bill, if they sustained the decision of the Chair, than if
they reversed that decision It might be much more conve
ment, so far as despatch was concerned, if they had no right
in Committer of the Whole to offer amendments, or to discuss
the questions befoie it at alt, but he would ask if that would be
consistent with the objects of a free Government, or with that
course which a Committee of the Whole ought to pursue when
they are about to appropriate money taken from the people by
taxation
One of the rules of the House required that allapproprja-
tion bills shall be consideiedm Committee ofthe Whole House.
The object of this was that bills of this description may be
thoroughly scrutinized and discussed This discussion was not
to be useless and unavailing, but remedies were also to be ap-
plied for the redress and prevention of evils, and of course all
amendments were tobe introduced pieventive of wasteyi ex '
penditures for legitimate objects, and prohibiting expenditure*
for such objects as were useless
He would inquire in what did an appropriation bill differ
from any other bill* Might not any amendment be offered ttJ-
an appropriation bill that might be offered to other bills, except
so fir as prohibited in the rules') This being admitted, what
was the obiect of the prohibition m the rules with regaid to
araei dments to general appropriation bills? It was to guard
the Treasury—to limit expenditures— to pievent appropriation 
from heme introduced into them, except for objects authorized!
by law But because there was a prohibition that the commit-
tee should go in one direction—that of an increase of expendí
tures—it did not follow that they could not go in another direc-
tion, and limit expenditures and guard the public Tieasury
On the contrary, thespintandmeamngof the rule nselfpointed
out the course for the committee to pursue, viz that they
should not increase appropnations, except for objects autho
r zed by law, but that they might regulate limit, and restrain
expendiuie If the amendment v ds pertinent, then it was m
order unless e\pressly p< ohibued by the rules Now, he would
^am ask, if there was doy rule of the Hoise or ofparliamen-
taivlaw v ichdeclaied it t-> be out of orderl It did not ongi
natef-Mct i tine i did i ot -,o to increase txperditun , nor did
itc ntemrlate an expenditure foi objects not authorized bylaw.
Then the question of pertinency was the only one remaining to
be settled
The gent eman from Massachusetts [Mr CushingJ seemed
to put his objections on this ground and to argue that the object
of an appropriation bill being to make appropriations for ob
lects authorized by law the committee had no right to do any
thine but consider whether they could increase or dimmish the
appropriations Now, if that was the only function the com
mittee had to peform, they were nothing more thdu a mere ma-
cl me and he daredto *>ay that a machine might be made some
thing like Babbage's Calculator, which could draw, amend,
and passappiopnationbills on such principles, with asmuch
rapidity and ac/uiacy as ary body of men According to these
pinui les the «ame thing as he (Mi A ) heard a voice sug-
srestmg might be lone by steam if all they could áof after
having ascertairel that the law authorized an appropria-
tion wa' to square it accoidmg to the law If the gentleman's
assmnp ion wascoirect it would not be in order to move to
stuke out appiopnations because the law required that such a
salaty should bepaid to any paiticular officer, and therefore,
thevweiebmi d to give the money He could not, many
po nt he couUl view the subject agree that the privileges of the
Committee of the Whole should be thu& narrowed and con-
fined to a meie registration of the edicts of a prior Congress
Tht, gentleman from Massachusetts refeired to instances in
in which he thought this principle, if established would work
inconveniently and said that they might go into the Po*t
On e Departmeat, dnd make provisnrs against the frank-
ing privilege This, said Mr A has already been done,
and a law was now in foree in relation to that subject, engraft
ed on an appropriation bill at the instance of a gentleman from
