CITY POINT, VA., January 24, 1865-9.35 a. m.

Honorable G. V. FOX,

Assistant Secretary of the Navy:

The enemy's iron-clads came down below the obstructions this morning and returned to the neighborhood of Howlett's before daylight . Since their return there has been a heavy explosion about the obstruction. There are three of these iron-clads in view, and I am inclined to believe they will make an effort to get down here to destroy our stores. Will you please order up the gun-boats now about Fort Monroe, with orders that they shall not stop for night or other cause until they reach the front now occupied by our gun-boats.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

WASHINGTON, January 24, 1865.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

The Ironsides and Atlanta have both started up James River. The former, on a draft of sixteen feed, ought to reach City Point; the latter is less. The Saugus started from Norfolk for this place, but was sent for to-day. I do not understand where our torpedo-boats is. She ought to dispose of all the rams if they come below the obstruction. The Rhode Island, one of the fastest and best ocean steamers, will be at the Roads ready for you Thursday morning. I cannot tell until to-morrow whether I can get off; we are frown up here. Will telegraph in the morning.

G. V. FOX,

Assistant Secretary.

Captain Fox is waiting for an answer, so says telegraph operator.

E. S. PARKER.

CITY POINT, VA., January 24, 1865.

Honorable G. V. FOX,

Assistant Secretary of the Navy:

If the weather holds dry I want to go to Fort Fisher as soon as possible, so as to be here whenever the roads admit of troops moving. If it should rain a day or two, would not make any difference. I should particularly like you to go with me, however.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

WASHINGTON, January 24, 1865.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

I will send an order now removing Commander Parker. The next in rank is, I think, Commander Nichols, a fair officer. If you deem it unadvisable you can withhold the order. I will go with you Thursday, unless I notify you to the contrary to-morrow. The Secretary of War will send me over to Annapolis in the evening.

G. V. FOX,

Assistant Secretary of the Navy.
