The tot:iI mercantile Indebtedness of the South to north-
ern merchants Is raiefully estimated to be @^00,000,000. The
following Finns are computed to be thus due to the chief
not there commercial cities :
New York 6159,800,000
Philadelphia  '24,000,000
Baltimore  19,000.000

Tile total indebtedness of those who became insolvent
In the northern States In the year 1861 is ®178,833,170,
against $61,739,474 the prceerlimjyear. The nuinberol fail-
inea exceeds tli.it of 1837 by 1,678, being 4,937 in 1857, and
5,935 in 1861. The total number of failure* in 1861 in the
southern States, ns far as known, is 1,058, being 383 more
Ulan In 1857; but these failures probably much exceed the
estimates.
As the indebtedness of those failures, where the debts
amount to less than $5,000, id computed to he at least one
thiid in addition to the foregoing estimates, the number of
the failures Is probably quite as great as that of larger fail-
ures.
POLICY AND OBJECT OP TUB WAR.
SPEECH OF HON. A. L. KNAPP,
OP ILLINOIS,
In the House of Reprksentatives,
June 5, 1862.
The House being In the Committee of the Whole on the
state of the Union, and having under consideration the bill
for the enlistment of minors-
Mr. KNAPP snid:
Mr. Chairman: In the history of nations, not
tinlike in this respect that of individuals, great
crisea at times occur, when every action is fraught
with interest, every step a measure of most vital
andlastingimportance,and destined in theircffect
upon that history, as safety and prosperity or ruin
and destruction is the result, to an everlasting
remembrance of gratitude or an immortality of
infamy.
In such a crisis, without parallel in the records
of nations, whether in the magnitude of the stake
at issue or the greatness of the means employed
in the contest, is our country placed to-day. And
to us, as the exponents of her legislative will, ami
the authors of her general policy, are the eyes of
ourgreat constituency directed. In our hands are
now, thanks to the successes of our arms, placed
the destinies of the Republic.
At ari earlier period in the rebellion, before the
ensign of the Republic had emerged in* triumph
from the smoke of decisive conflict, and while
armies such as rebellion had never before raised
stood arrayed in the field, flaunting their banners
insightoftheCouncil Chambersofthe nation,and
thundering almost at the very gates of the capital,
the issues of national existence were in the hands
of those whom patriotism had summoned from
the quiet avocations of peace and the endearments
of home to take their place in the ranks of their
country's defenders.
Right nobly, Mr. Chairman, have they per-
formed their duty, as the records of the last few
months willeverattest; and now, while the " wan-
ing proportions" of this rebellion give confident
promise of its entire suppression and the restora-
tion of law and constitutional authority to their
wonted and accustomed spheres, it devolves upon
us to perfect the work so gloriously carried for-
