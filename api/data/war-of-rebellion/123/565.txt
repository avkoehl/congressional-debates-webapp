We have respectfully to suggest to the Commander-in-Chief that, if convinced, as we think he may be, of the worth of these claims (and he has only to consult the Surgeon-general to receive full evidence of them), he will use his official influence with the President to obtain a recommendation to the following effect, i. e., that the President, by the advice of the Commander-in-Chief and the Surgeon-General, recommends the country to furnish its extraneous aid and assistance for the soldiers who are sick and wounded through the Sanitary Commission, appointed in the very beginning of the war to be the channel of this benevolence, as the multiplication of agencies of this kind is embarrassing to the Medical Department and the military authorities. Whatever expressions of confidence, after full investigation, the Government may see fit to add to this recommendation, we should value for their moral effect.

A thorough and unsparing examination of our methods, of our past services, and our present activities (if it were possible) would be the highest favor the Government could render us.

Very respectfully, yours,

HENRY W. BELLOWS,

President of the Sanitary Commission.
