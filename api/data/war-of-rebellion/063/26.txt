HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE GULF, On Mansfield Road, April 3, 1864.

Major-General BANKS:

GENERAL: The enemy have just advanced a small battalion of infantry, with led horses, nearly opposite our left. They have moved a body of cavalry to the road, and are running wagons from the center to the right of their line. Is not the whole matter of this stand one of saving the train? A push up the Mansfield road would capture the train and isolate the wings.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,CHAS. P. STONE,

Brigadier-General and Chief of Staff.
