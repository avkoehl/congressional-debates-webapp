Major-General HALLECK,

Washington, D. C.:

I think the road toward Sheridan should be put in order as far as protection can be furnished for it. Washington, being protected as much by troops sent out on the road south as if the same troops were in the city, can be stripped considerably lower than would be justifiable to send the troops elsewhere. After reaching Manassas Juction I would like Sheridan to decide which road should be opened. If he moves, as I expected him, to Charlottesville, the road to Culpeper would be the one to Culpeper would be the one to repair.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

CITY POINT, VA., September 27, 1864-6.30 p. m. (Received 10 p. m.)

Major-General HALLECK,

Washington, D. C.:

Now that Sheridan has pushed so far up the Valley, General Augur should send, if it is possible, a force of cavalry and infantry out by Culpeper, with scouts as far to the front as they can go, to watch if any troops move north on the east side of the Blue Ridge to get in upon Sheridan's rear.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

QUARTERMASTER-GENERAL'S OFFICE, Washington, D. C., September 27, 1864.

Lieutenant-General GRANT,

Commanding Armies of the United States, City Point, Va.:

We wait military protection to open the Manassas Gap Railroad. Reports of time needed-say three days to Piedmont, seven days to Front Royal, fourteen days to Strasburg. The cost of wagon trains from Harper's Ferry or Martinsburg to Strasburg will be very heavy, and it is very difficult to supply hay and grain for the animals. They consume in the rear what the Manassas Gap Railroad would enable us to deliver to the front. If the military movements needed to cover the road can be made it will be very advantageous to open this road at once. Can your order dispositions to make this safe and practicable?

Respectfully,

M. C. MEIGS,

Quartermaster-General, Brevet Major-General.

CITY POINT, VA., September 27, 1864-6 p. m. (Received 10 p. m.)

Major General M. C. MEIGS,

Quartermaster-General, Washington:

I have given no orders until to-day about repairing railroads, because I did not know whether Sheridan would have the road to Culpeper or the one to Strasburg opened. General Augur and other departments in the Middle Division will have to furnish the troops to guard the road when open.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
