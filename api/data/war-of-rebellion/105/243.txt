below during the night, and early the next morning were attacked by the Indians, and the fight was kept up several hours, in which 3 white men were killed and 2 wounded, also a Chinaman wounded. Of the Indians 1 was killed and 2 wounded, 1 of which it has since been ascertained died of his wounds. At this place the Indians obtaned two rifles and two pistols. The citizens were but few in number and poorly armed.

The next day other citizens arrived from North Salmon and a party was sent in pursuit, and came upon the camp of the enemy in the dark before they expected to, and the Indians all escaped, being obliged to leave nearly all their merchandise, two rifles, and a double-barreled shotgun. After this the pursuing party saw no more of the Indians, as they scattered in every direction. From this post Captain Ousley proceeded directly to the South Salmon and returned via New River, where he found several hundred pounds of provisions the Indians had left, which was cached by the captain. A few miles farther down the stream were found caches made by the Indians of their plunder, which were destroyed. The party of thirty men which I sent out to intercept the Indians were not successful in discovering any. This raid on Ponyn Creek was nothing but what was expected if a few miners would persist in remaining for the winter on any of the branches of New River. The region is so completely isolated and difficult of approach for troops that it would be impossible to afford assistance or protection to the miners, except a force was stationed there. The people on Salmon River have felt themselves comparatively safe from attack, the more probably because they have heretofore escaped and from the distance than from their ability to resit. The citizens here are now on their guard and able to protect themselves for the present.
