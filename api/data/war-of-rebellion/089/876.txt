HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,December 8, 1864. (Received 11.06 a. m.)

General WILLIAMS:

Four deserters from MacRae's, Archer's old, and Scales' brigades came in during the night. Those from MacRae's and Archers' state that they had orders yesterday afternoon to cook two days' rations and be ready to move. Heard that a brigade moved to their right yesterday evening. Don't know whose. It was understood we were moving to their right. Deserter from Scales' left his regiment for picket yesterday morning. Heard nothing of our moving. No marching orders had then been issued to them. There was one deserter from the right of the First Division last night and one from the Third Division pickets.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,December 8, 1864-12 m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

An order will be issued placing you in command of the movable column in case of leaving the intrenchments. Park's reserves are ordered to report to you by telegraph for orders. Please be prepared to send them such preliminary orders as you issued yesterday in paragraph 11. I think twenty-four guns will be enough to carry, one battery of which, if not more, might come from Parke, who has ten rifled and ten 12-pounders in reserve.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,December 8, 1864.

Colonel DUANE,

Chief Engineer, Army of the Potomac:

Can you send a supply of gabions to each of the inclosed works held by the Second Corps, to close the entrances, in the event of an attack on their rear? The inclosed works of the Fifth Corps line probably require the same. I am informed there are no palisade closing for the works on the line of the Second Corps.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General of Volunteers.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,December 8, 1864.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

Lieutenant-Colonel Spaulding has been directed to send details of his command to inclose the different works requiring it along the lines of the Second and Sixth Corps.
