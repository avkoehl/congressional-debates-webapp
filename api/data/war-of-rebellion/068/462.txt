HEADQUARTERS ARMIES OF THE UNITED STATES, Wilderness Tavern,May 6, 1864.

Major-General BURNSIDE,

Commanding Ninth Corps:

GENERAL: General Hancock has been severely engaged for some time, the enemy having forced his line in one place, but being immediately repulsed. In consequence of this, orders have been sent Hancock suspending the order to attack at 6 p.m. In your movements for the balance of the day, our until you receive further orders, hold your own and be governed entirely by circumstances. Should the enemy attack Hancock, give such aid as you can. After dark, and all is quiet, put your men in a good position for defense and for holding our line, and give your men all the rest they can get.

Yours,

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
