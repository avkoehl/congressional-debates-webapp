GALLATIN, December 7, 1862.

General ROSECRANS:

If I knew the locality of the enemy, I could use Fry's entire division, about 8,000, I believe,and leave General Dumont to defend Gallatin. There being so many fords on the river, it becomes necessary to divide up a good deal.

GALLATIN, December 7, 1862

General ROSECRANS:

General Boyle telegraphs, as coming from you, that Forrest left Columbia for a raid into Kentucky, via Clarksville. Is this reliable? And do you know his force, and have you any troops west of Nashville likely to intercept him? Clarksville is an important point, and should be held, but I have not the troops to spare. Can't you do it? Boyle thinks McHenry's regiment ought not to be taken from Bruce's command for that purpose. Lieutenant Tardy reports about 2,000 rebel cavalry in Lebanon. This confirmed by citizens who have run off to avoid conscription. They might be captured by sending a force from Nashville to get between them and Murfreesborough.
