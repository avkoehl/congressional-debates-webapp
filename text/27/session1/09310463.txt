APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
m
Revenue Bill—Mr. Fillmore.
H. oí Reps.
In order to determine how this affects the revenue, it is ne-
cessary to ascertain how much these deductions take off* from
the duties m imports By a reierence to the table to which I
nave alieady called the attention of the committee, in House
document No. 31, at page 29, m the second column oi that table,
itwiU be seen what the deduction hasbeen under this act fiom
1834 to 1839 inclusive And, if I have not made a mistake in
my calculation, it will be seen that the average amount for
every tenth, in each year, is $S74,000 This, then, furnishes an
easy rule by which to determine what was deducted during the
past Administration, and what will be deducted during the pre-
sent, and the difference will be the amount which the past Ad-
ministration received and expended, from a souice from which
tfaepresentcanieceive nothing
In 1837, 2 lOths were deducted, being twice S874,00D, $1,748,000
1838,3l0ths              do          do   three times do      2 629,000
1839,310ths              do           do           do        do     2622,000
1840,4-lOths              do          do   four times do     3,496,000
Making a total of deduction during the past Adminis-
tration of      -----           - $10,438,00
Now let us see the amount of deductions by the same process
for the current four years
In 1814,1 lOths will be deducted, being fom times
«874,000......93,496,000
In 1842,7 lOths for half a year, being seven times

All of v-hich hacheen red i ved and expended dunng the pist
Administration, and that, too, from «nuces fiom which the pre
sent Administration has nothing to expect. This h equal to

had they come into power with hl iher means or íesources than
what the present Administration has—assuming that the land
bill become«! a law—they would have left, the Tieasury empty,
and incurred a national debt of $60,953,000.
Comment upon this state of thmga is unnecessary It is clear
that the Administration cannot go on so Something must be
done to replenish an exhausted Treasury, and to maintain the
good faith of the Government. I shall not assume to say what
the amount of deficit in the Treasury will be, but the bare state-
ment of the case shows that it must necessarily be very laige
It calls loudly upon us foi retrenchment and reform—not that
retrenchment that is heard m strong professions before election,
and isnever heard of afteiwards, but for thoiough, practical
retrenchment, by which every unnecessary office shall be abo
Hshed, and every--alary that is too high cut down, anda tystem
of rigid economy and accountability m the expendnuies of the
public money adopted I hope my friend /rom Virginia. [Mr.
Gilmjer] will, by the investigation-? of 1m select committee, show
Tis how much money may be saved But all thu is a work of
time. Investigations must first be had, and then law passed,
before any of these retrenchments can he realized. In the
mean tima our expenses ate accruing, and we have no means
of meeting them We must look these thing  in the face—
we must meet this cribis as best we can No matter by whom
the governmental machine has been permitted to getout of re-
pair and run down, it is now in our charge, and we are bound
to repair it, and set it in motion On us, whether filends or
foes to present Administration, rests this responsibility, and we
cannot absolve ourselves from it Oui country's honoris in-
volved, and I hare no apprehensions that my constituents will
not cheerfully and piomptly meet any additional demands
which it may be necessary to make upon their means to supply
the wants of this Goveinment when it is economically adminis-
tered; and when they think it is not, they will turn out the un
faithful stewards, and put more trustworthy ones m their
places But they will pay the honest creditor of the Govern-
ment, even though the steward may have proved unworthy of
his trust. And I claim no more patnotism or magnanimity
for my constituents m this matter than I am willing to grant to
those of every other membei on this floor.
But, before I pass from this subject, I beg leave to say, that,
m making up our minds as to the amount of additional ieve-
nue that may be wanted to meet the probable demands upon
the Treasury for the four current years, \ihile we flatter our-
selves with the retrenchment we may effect, not only m the few
expenditures to which I have alluded, but possibly by putting
an end to that most inglorious, unfortunate, and ruinous of all
wars—I mean that with the Florida Indians—yet it must also
he borne in mind that we have to provide for the debt incurred
during the last four years, and that the practice has been for
several years past to stave off all private claims without much
regard to their merit, many ol which are doubtless just, and
should be paid, and that several of the States, particular!)
Maine, Geotgia, Alabama, and Louisiana hare large claims ac-
cruing under the past Administration, which, ifjuat and legal,
must be paid, independent of the nameless and numberless
■unliquidated claims growing out of the Florida war and the re
moval of the Indians, many of which are doubtless just and
must be paid I barely mention these among the numerous de-
mands that may be made upon the Tieasury of an extraordi-
nary character during the current four years to show that we
cannot estimate the probable amount
But the next question is, liow is this deficit to be supplied,
whetheryou chalí it$16,000,QOO or$18,000,000 peryear, ormore
or less ? It is clear there must be a large deficit that must sup-
plied from some source, and I know of but three modes in
which it can be done. 1st. You may borrow 2d You may
lay a direct tax upon the propeity of the country Or, 3d
You may hi y a duty upon goods now imported free, and upon
those bearing a less duly than 20 per cenr.—equal to 20 per
cent.—and m that way supply the wants of the Treasury to the
extentof those means.
I shall enter into no argument to show that we ought not to
depend on borrowing to supply the ordinary wants of theTrea
suiy We have tiied that, more or lesa, fot the last four years,
and have finally funded the debt with a view of paying it off
during the current four years A public debt is justly odious
to the people of this country, and I am unwilling to Bee it in
creased except frc m absolute necessitv
The ne\t mode t* by a direct tax The gentleman from South
Carolina [Mr Rhett] and my colleague from New York
[Mr McKeon] spoke m favor of this mode of supplying
the Treastuy a day ot two since, but I apprehend there
aie very few members on this floor who would advocate that
doctrine
[Here Mi McKfom ioie to explain, but as Mr F'shourwas
nearly exhausted, he declined yielding the ftooi ]
I shall be happy to hear that I have mistaken my colleague
Let those who piefer dnect fixation to indirect by cuaterna
look at England, where they both prevail, and see the picture
of inquisitonal mtiusion and official insolence and violence to
which then excise «ystem natually leads, and I think he will
prefer duties to excise oi dnect taxation
The only remaining mode is by duties a** ptopored in this
bill, and this brings me to speak directly upon the merits of
the meisme ltseii I beg leave to call the attention of tho
committee to the views entertained bv the present Secretury of
the Treasury on thus subject They will be found in document
No 2of this House, usually called the "Finance Report" at
piget), where, after speaking of the embarrassments of the
Treasury and the public debt already accrued, and the constant
inci ease of both, he says
"But as it may not comport with the views of Congress to go
into a revipion atin u^ustmentofthe custom  «o long befoiethe
act o f Mart h 2, 1S,*Í% comes to havens final and permanent
operation, the undtrbigned would respectfully lecommend,
asa tempoiary measure, the levy of a duty of 20 pel cent
ad valorem on all articles which are now free of duty, or which
paya less duty than 20 pel cent except go'd and silver, and the
ameles specifically enumerated m the 5th section of the act of
March 2,1833
"If thismeaauie V adopted, it is estimated (hat theie will be
lccerved into theTieasury from customs m the last qinrtPi of
ihe picentyear,about$5'í0fl0fl0( in all ofiiejeai I84-? about
5í22,É0O,O0O, and m the yeir 18-13, after lie final íeducimn im
der the act of March 2 ifc.S3 about $20 800 OOO The details of
this estimate will be found in the accompanying paper, marked
K, and enclosures "
Theseatethc view^oftbt piesent Stoietaiy, Mr Fwmg, md
the Committee of Ways and Means have, in (lie in tin, com ur
rod in them, andtliebill under consuleiation is intended tocar
ry them out. But th; members of this House, on a measure of
so much importance, may desneto know what were the views
of the late Secretary of the Treasiuy on this subject I am
happv to have it m my power to gratify them in this l aspect
Mr Woodbury, the late Secretaiy of the Treasury, made a
report to the Senate on this subject, dated January 18, 1841,
whidí is No 93 of Senate documents, 2d session of the 26th
Congress, and te whxhl invite the special attention of every
member of this committee, that he may see how well these
two Secretaries agree on this sul pet Indeed I cannot well
see how they could disagree, for both knew the exhausted state
of the Treasury, and no rational miri could doubt as to the
mode of rcplcn whine it The only change of difference amona
statesmen and fi ¡inner* must be as to the particular articles
that should be selected fiom the fiee h°t on which to impose
duties. Mi Woodbury gives what he calls a h*t of all free
articles, and thei ssys a duty of 15 per cent on them would
laise the required amount, but thinks it objectionable, and
finally says, at pasre 6—
' Another mode of raising the same amount of revenue would
therefore be preferable, if it could be accomplished without in-
cluding those articles Suppose then that theie should be
selected from the free ameles those which mav be regarded
most as luxuries, thoush not in every respect belonging exclu-
sively to that tlaos such are tea, coffee, and silks should we
then add to them others, conflicting with similar American pro-
ductions, such as worsteds, linens, etc and the agtrrperate, de
ducting tlie amount reexpoitcd, would be $29,026,448 [fee
the second tahlí R ] A duty of twenty ner cent on those, afrei
paying th« expenses of collection, would yield about the same
amount of five millions This seems to connin the general
data for the most eligible and unexceptionable revision "
I will now iead you this table "B," (which may be found at
page 10 of that report) containing the articles on which he
lecommendsthe duty of 20 percent tobe levied It is in woids

Thus you have the plan of the late Secretary of the Treasury,
Mr Woodubry, for the revision of the tariff, m order to supply
the deficiei cy m the Tieasury, which he has styled ltthe most
eligible and unexceptionable revision "
[Here the hour having expired, Mr F was cut short w his
remarks, but at the request of several gentlemen he has added
the bubstance of what he had intended to say ]
I now call the attention of the committee to so much of the
tables Nos 1,2, 3, and 4, in House document No 31 of this
session, as is necessary to show the articles upon which the
proposed bill will operate, and the probable amount of duties
to be raised thereby The tables explain themselves, and are
arranged m tins manner, because, as I am informed, this is the
mode in which the accounts are kept at the Treasury. T?he-
first table gives those ameles now fiee that usually pay an a$
valorem duty. The second, those now free that usually pay a
specific duty, with the estimate of a specific duty equal to the
ad valorem duty The third, those wines that now pay a spe-
cific duty, with the increased revenue that wou d arise from
an advalorum duty of 20 per cent, and a specific duty per
gallon equal to such ad valorem duty. And the fourth gives ft
hit of those ai tides that now pay a less duty than 20 per cent
ad valoru/ft, which, under this bill, will be raised to thajt
amount These tables have been piepaied at theTieasury I)e-
paitment by oider of the Committee of Ways and Means, and
aie presumed to be correct, anil so much of them .as is necei-
sary to illustrate, this subject 1 here give
