Major General R. F. HOKE,Sugar Loaf:

Reports of a painful character reach me from citizens on the west of the river in regard to the conduct of our troops. Large numbers of Haggod's brigade are represented as straggling off home, plundering indiscriminately as they go. I wish you would visit this part of your division and inform yourself. I will have the other part of the command inspected. Has General Haggod returned?
