There may be cases where prisoners of war are charged with offenses outside of their legitimate duties as soldiers, and these may be held responsible for these acts.

Recruits are not tried by court-martial, because they are recruits; but if recruiting officers come within our lines and induce men to enlist under them, neither they nor those whom they enlist can claim the privileges of prisoners of war.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. HOFFMAN,

Colonel Third Infantry and Commissary-General of Prisoners.

OFFICE COMMISSARY-GENERAL OF PRISONERS,

Washington, D. C., September 16, 1863.

Brigadier General S. A. MEREDITH,

Commissioner for Exchange of Prisoners, Fort Monroe, Va.:

GENERAL: Your letter of the 12th instant, inclosing annexed declaration of exchange of civilians, is received, and in reply I beg to say that I do not think it yet exactly meets the case. The declaration is to cover the exchange of all civilians arrested by the Confederate authorities on parole at City Point or at other places across our lines on or before the 6th of May. As you word the declaration it applies to those arrested prior to the 6th of May, though released on parole at any subsequent time.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. HOFFMAN,

Colonel Third Infantry and Commissary-General of Prisoners.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF VIRGINIA,Fort Monroe, September 16, 1863.

SIR: I am in possession of reliable information which states that Andrew Johnson, confined in Castle Thunder, is subject to "horrible treatment. " Will you cause inquiry to be made into this case and let me know his condition at your earliest convenience?

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. A. MEREDITH,

Brigadier-General and Commissioner for Exchange.
