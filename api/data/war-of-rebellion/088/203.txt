HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS, August 15, 1864.

General POTTER,Commanding Second Division:

GENERAL: The batteries sent you were not intended to be put in position unless they should be required. The heavy rain prevented Colonel Monroe visiting the line this evening, indicating to you the position of the batteries on your front.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOHN G. PARKE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS THIRD DIVISION, NINTH ARMY CORPS, August 15, 1864.

Captain R. A. HUTCHINS,Assistant Adjutant-General:

I have the honor to report that Colonel Humphrey's brigade relieved the brigade of General Hartranft during the night, connecting on the right with the Eighteenth Corps. Captain Roemer reports only few rebels see on the line this morning. I shall keep vigilant watch during the day.

O. B. WILLCOX,

Brigadier-General.

AUGUST 15, 1864-10.40 a.m.

Captain HUTCHINS:

Captain Roemer having reported a material diminution of the rebels in our front, I sent Lieutenant Brackett to Roemer's battery with a glass. Lieutenant Brackett has just returned, and says does not perceive any difference in the number usually visible. Colonel Humphrey, who went on the line last night after having been off a week, makes the same observation, so that I think reports of the rebel works being thinned out should be taken with caution.

Very respectfully,

O. B. WILLCOX,

Brigadier-General.
