HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, near Chattahoochee, July 10, 1864.

COMMANDING OFFICER,

Marietta:

The Eightieth Indiana should go to the mouth of Soap Creek and join its corps. General Schofield will need every man, if, as I suppose, the enemy will attempt to dislodge him.

Major-General, Commanding.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, near Chattahoochee River, July 10, 1864.

COMMANDING OFFICER,

Marietta:

The officer at Acworth report that a cavalry force of the enemy is near and that they threaten to burn a bridge between you and Acworth. Now that the main army of the enemy is across the Chattahoochee, Allatoona is safe, and you can safely detach one or more regiments forward to secure the road. See that the bridges are all well guarded as far as Acworth. Four companies are at Big Shanty.

COMMANDING OFFICER,

Marietta:

The Twenty-third Corps is now across the Chattahoochee at the mouth of Soap Creek, and being exposed will need every regiment in it. It is my smallest army. The signal officer reports the enemy's bridge burning, in which case the enemy will, of course, abandon this side altogether. As soon as that is ascertained to be actual truth, I will arrange for permanent details to guard the road back as far as Allatoona.

HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, near Chattahoochee, July 10, 1864.

COMMANDING OFFICER,

Rome, Ga.:

Johnston's army is now driven across the Chattahoochee. You should now keep detachments well out toward Van's Valley, Villa Rica, and toward Gadsden, getting familiar with the country, getting grain and forage, and picking up prisoners. Instead of being passive, all should now be most active.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
