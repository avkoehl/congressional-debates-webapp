ADJUTANT: I have the honor to report that on the evening of the 20th instant I received information of the whereabouts of a bushwhacker that had been wounded and thrown from his horse on the previous evening while running from a detachment of this command. I ordered out Lieutenant Teel, in command of squads from Companies G and H, First Cavalry, Missouri State Militia, who found the bushwhacker and executed him on the spot. His name was B. F. Watkins, formerly of Cass County, Mo. He was thrown from horse he or his party had stolen from citizen near Brownsville, Saline County, on the previous night. He had a $5 greenback, which is subject to order. He had with him no other valuables.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

General FISK, Saint Louis, Mo:

The recent murders have caused considerable excitement in this county. They were cold-blooded assassinations and strike terror to the heart of every citizen. They were committed by men who live in the immediate vicinity of the unfortunate victims and are partly known to be accomplices. I apprehend nothing serious from them, militarily speaking.

JOHN F. WILLIAMS,

Colonel.
