NEW BERNE, N. C., December 12, 1864.

Major General BENJAMIN F. BUTLER,

Commanding Dept. of Virginia and North Carolina:

GENERAL: The brilliant affair near Greenville, which I reported on the 28th, produced great commotion throughout North Carolina, and was generally noticed in the Richmond, Raleigh, and Wilmington papers, although I have failed to discover any allusion to it in ours.

In consequence of this and other moves, Governor Vance called out the entire State or home guards by proclamation on the 2nd. Brigadier-General Ransom, with a portion of a brigade, moved to Tarborough, which is equally distant from Greenville and Rainbow Bluff, and connected by rail with Weldon, &amp;c. A large force, of all arms, is at the railway near Kenasville, where but a single company has usually been kept. All concur in material additions to the command of General Whiting.

The gunboat has not yet been reported in North Carolina, but I look for her daily.

No part of the Third [New York] Cavalry has arrived, as I hoped. In my judgment, it is needed for the public service.

The 200-pounder has arrived but without a carriage. It will be placed in its proper position so soon as a carriage can be prepared.

Your General Orders, No. 46, on the recruitment of colored troops have been received. Orderes have been issued calling the attention of all to the subject-matter and requiring a hearty co-operation. It seems to remove all obstacles, and there is a fair promise of an abundant harvest.

Rev. Mr. James may labor under some difficulty from not being a bonded officer. I nominated him to the War Department for an appointment as superintendent of blacks. Failing to receive that, a commissioner's appointment would remove all embarrassment, and increase his very small compensation.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOHN J. PECK,

Major-General.
