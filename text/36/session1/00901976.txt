THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
May 8,
fifteen per cent. On olive oil in casks, which is
not produced in this country at all, we have put
a duty of ten per cent.; old type, to be remanu-
factured, we have placed in the free list.
It is obvious, Mr. Chairman\ that it is indis-
pensably necessary that we make some change in
the tariff if we would carry on the Government
without running into debt some $10,000,000 an-
nually. This year, I believe, we shall run into
debtat least.$10,000,000; and I think the measure
here proposed ought not to be considered a party
measure, but one to provide for the real necessi-
ties of the Government. If gentlemen will exam-
ine it, they will find that it is not open to ail^r
serious objection from any quarter. I think it
embraces the whole interests of the country—the
farming, the mining,and the manufacturing; and
I do not think it will prove burdensome to any
interest, or to any portion or in any quarter of
the Union.
The CHAIRMAN. Debate is now closed upon
this bill, ahd the Chair desires to state the posture
of the bill. The gentleman from Alabama [Mr.
Houston] has moved an amendment by way of
substitute. The gentleman from Vermont [Mr.
Morrill] has moved an amendment to the
amendment, by way of a substitute to the substi-
tute and to the bill itself. It will now be in order
to perfect the original bill; and the original bill
will be read, in order that it may be perfected, if
any member desires to have it read for that pur-
pose; if not, the Chair will have the substitutes of
the gentleman from Alabama and the gentleman
from Vermont read.
Mr. KELLOGG, of Illinois. I wish to make
an inquiry of the Chair. Is it proposed now to
read the bill with a view to amendment, or, after
the substitute shall have been acted upon, will it
then be in order to propose amendments to the
different portions of the bill ?
The CHAIRMAN. The Chair understands this
to be the order of proceeding: in the first place,
the committee will procced to pass upon the ori-
ginal bill. That will be rend for the purpose of
amendment. After the original bill shall have
been perfected, then the substitutes will be read,
and the question will be upon them.
Mr. HOUSTON. It occurs to me that the
Chair is likely to fall into what I believe to be
an error, in receiving a substitute to a substitute.
My idea of the practice and of the law is, that a
substitute being offered in lieu of the original bill,
the course to be pursued is to take up the original
bill and perfect it before ever you put a competing
proposition against it. Then the pending substi-
tute is taken up, and it is perfected before a vote
can be taken between the two propositions. So
that if the Chair receives a substitute to a substi-
tute, when you pass through the oiiginal bill and
pcrfect it, and you propose then to take up the
substitute to th<j substitute,! would ask to perfect
the substitute before the second substitute is taken
in its stead. So that the Chair would get into
difficulty upon that point.
The CHAIRMAN. The Chair will state the
position which he understands to be the correct
one in this regard. There was, in the first place,
the original bill. It was competent for the gen-
tleman from Alabama to offer an amendment, and
he did offer it. It was, to be sure, in the nature
of a substitute; and it was precisely as competent
for thegentleman from Vermont to oft'eran amend-
ment to the substitute, and to offer fa by way of
a substitute for it; which he did. Now, the com-
mittee have the right to go to work upon the ori-
ginal bill, in order to perfect it; and it is simply
for the purpose of perfecting it that the commit-
tee have the right to act upon it at all. Were
there not a law, or a practice, that the orignal bill
might be perfected, notwithstanding the pendency
of a substitute, it would not be proper or compe-
tent for the committee to proceed to perfecting
the original bill, there being two amendments al-
ready before the committee. The practice has
been, notwithstanding the pendency of a substi-
tute, to permit theperfccting of the original propo-
sition. That has been the uniform practice of the
House, and will hold, though there are two pend-
ing amendments; and it makes no difference
whether they are to the whole bill or to a part.
One is to the whole bill, and the other is an
amendment in the nature of a substitute to the
substitute.
Mr. HOUSTON. The trouble I have is this:
that whenever an amendment is proposed, in the
nature of a substitute, that substitute is as far as
you can go. I propose a substitute to the bill.
Then you can perfect the bill, and then there will
be two amendments pending—true, not to each
other—but there will be two amendments pend-
ing. After they get through with the original bill,
.the committee have the right of perfecting the
substitute before a vote is taken upon it. Now
my recollection and my understanding is that
there can be but one substitute pending under
any circumstances. The committee will have
the right, or will claim the right—and I think
they have the right—to amend the substitute be-
fore it is voted upon in competition with the ori-
ginal bill.
The CHAIRMAN. The question directly be-
fore the committee is in reference to the original
bill, the amending and perfecting it. If it is the
desire of the committee, the Chair will have the
original bill read in order to have it amended. If
the committee do not desire that, the Chair will
have the amendment, in the nature of a substitute,
read.
Mr. MAYNARD. I would like to inquire of
the Chair, with regard to the second amendment,
proposed by the gentleman from Vermont, whether
it will be permissible to modify, or amend, or
perfect it, or whether we shall have to take it as
it is ?
The CHAIRMAN. The Chair will rule on
questions as they arise.
Mr. SHERMAN. I have a suggestion to make
which, I think, will expedite the matter, and give
the committee a full opportunity to vote on every
section of the bill; that is, that the amendment
offered by the gentleman from Vermont be putin
the stead of the original bill. It is a substitute for
the original bill, with only some grammatical cor-
rections. There arc quite a number of amend-
ments that are not of a very important character.
There are but one or two important amendments
in it. I therefore suggest that Mr. Morrill's
amendment be taken up as the original bill, and
read by sections for amendment. After we shall
have perfected that amendment as the original
bill, then the gentleman from Alabama can have
an opportunity of getting a vote on his substitute.
Thfct will simplify the matter.
Mr. HOUSTON. Is the substitute printed?
Mr. SHERMAN. It is not; but it is precisely
like the original bill that is printed, except in two
or three particulars, which will be found when we
reach them.
Mr. HOUSTON. The bill has to be r^ad by
sections for amendment. We cannot get along
without that. But, I suppose, it would be more
convenient for us, as the other bill is not printed,
to go on and make the printed bill conform to the
substitute.
Mr. SHERMAN. It will require about fifteen
amendments to do so.
Mr. HOUSTON. That will be required at any
rate. I think, as this bill is printed and the sub-
stitute is not, that it would be much more intelli-
gible and satisfactory for us to have the bill taken
up. The gentlemen who propose to make it con-
form to the substitute of the gentleman from Ver-
mont, can offeramendmemsfor that purpose, and
we, at the same time, can offer such amendments
as we choose.
The Clerk proceeded to read the bill by sec-
tions for amendment. t
Mr. TAYLOR. I understand that the object
of this bill is to increase the duties.
The CHAIRMAN. Docs thegentleman from
Louisiana offer an amendment?
Mr. TAYLOR. I move to amend the^luties
on sugar, by substituting one cen and a half
where it is one cent, and by substituting two cents
where it is one cent and a half.
I understand, Mr. Chairman, that the object
of this bill is claimed to be the augmentation of
revenue. The duties on sugar constitute an im-
portant element of national revenue. By reference
to the existing rate of duty, and to the importa-
tions of sugar at the port of New York, for the
last three years, I find that the average rate of
duty now collected on sugar exceeds considera-
bly one cent a pound. I hold in my hand a table,
prepared with great care, of the importation of
sugar at New York for the last three years, and
its dutiable value in each quarter, which shows
that the average amount of duty collected dur-
ing that time approached to one and a half cent.
The following are the figures:
Importation of sugais into New York for three years ; their
dutiable value in gross; average dutiable value per pound.

If the object be to increase the revenue, it would
be proper to augment the proposed duty on sugar.
But this is not the case. The rates proposed in
this bill will be productive of much less revenue
than is now raised under the ad valorem duty im-
posed by the existing tariff. From what has been
said on the other side, one would suppose that a
great increase of duties was contemplated. That
is the case certainly with respcct to iron. 1 hold
in my hand a table, also prepared with great care,
showing that on specified articles of iron, on which
specific duties are proposed by this bill, the du-
ties collected at the port of New York, for the
last three years, were from forty to sixty per cent,
less than the duty proposed by this bill. The fig-
ures arc as follows:
Proposed rates of duties on various kinds of iron, and what
they arc now.
Fig iron, $6 a ton.
Railroad iron, §12 a ton.
l>ai iron, $15 a ton.
Cut nails, &c., 1 cent alb. Tacks, 2 cci)U> or more, if
more than 1,000 to 1,600.
lion cables and anchors, &c., I? cent a lb.

a tan—to 1 cent, ly cent, and li cent.
Present duties under the art of 1837—twenty-four per centum
ad valorem.
Fig iron—dutiable value, 1857, 96 cents a cwt. or $19 20
a ton duli, equal to $5 98 per ton.
185^, dutiable value, 88 cents a cwt. or $-17 60 per ton,
$4 80 duty.
J859, dutiable value 76 cents a cwt. or $15 20 per ton,
$3 64 duty.
Kailroad iron—dutiable value $2 19 a cwt. in 1857, or
$43 80 a ton, duty equal to $10 51 per ton.
1858, dutiable vaiue $3 09 a cwt. or $41 80 per ton, $10 03
duty
1859, dutiable value $1 60 a cwt. or $32 per ton, $7 68
duty.
liar non—dutiable value, 1857, $2 52 a cwt. or $50 40 a

1858, dutiable value $2 53 a cwt. or $50 60 a ton, $12 14
duty.
1859, dutiable value $2 25 a cwt. or $45 a ton, $10 80
duty.
NaiK spikes, tacks, See.—Dutiable value, 1857,4.1 cents
all' , duly equal to .98 cent.
1858, dutiable value 5.2 a lb , 1 24 cent duty.
lion cables—Dutiable value, 1857, 3£ cents, duty equal
to 8.4 mills.
1853, dutiable value 3.44 cents, 8 I nuil-s dut>.
1859, dutiable value 2.92 cents, 6.9 initio duty.
Anehois—Dutiable value, 1857, 3 cents 4.3 mills, duty
equaHo 7.69 mills-.
1S58, dutiable value 4.44 cents*, 1.05 cent duty.
1859, dutiable value 5.14 ccnts*, 1.22 cent duty.
Sheet iron—Dutiable value, lc57, 3 cent*, duty equal to
7.2 nulls.
1858, dutiable value 3 37 cents. 7.92 mills duty.
1859, dutiable valuo 2.55 cents, 6.2 nulls duty.
So that, Mr. Chairman, in this bill, by which
itis pretended we are to obtain additional revenue,
we find that the specific duties proposed on iron
are such that the increase over the existing ad
fflfomjiduty underthe present tariff is from thirty-
three and a third per ccnt. to seventy-five percent,
on hur great leading product; while on the other
