NASHVILLE, December 10, 1864-6 p.m.

Major General G. M. DODGE,

Saint Louis, Mo.:

Your dispatch of 2 p.m. is received. I have an ample supply of batteries.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding.

LOUISVILLE, KY., December 10, 1864. (Received 6.10 p.m.)

Honorable E. M. STANTON:

The general impressment of horses by the military is so oppressive here that we cannot think it meets your approbation. All horses are taken without regard to the occupation of the owner or his loyalty. Loaded country wagons with produce for market are left in the road; milk carts, drays, and butcher's wagons are left in the street, their horses seized. We know not the immediate necessities of the service, but we are certain that great wrong is being done in carrying out the order. If there be such, we pray you to look into it.

J. F. SPEED,

BLAND BALLARD.

NASHVILLE, December 10, 1864-9.45 a.m.

Brigadier-General MEREDITH,

Paducah:

Your dispatch of the 9th instant is received. If you should learn further of the movements of Lyon and Cheatham I shall be obliged if you will inform me at the earliest moment.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding.

PADUCAH, December 10, 1864.

Brigadier-General WHIPPLE:

GENERAL: I have just received reliable information that Lyon and Cheatham crossed the Tennessee River at Danville bridge on the 8th. They will apparently demonstrate between the Cumberland and Green Rivers. I think they will strike the Green River bridge. Their forces number some 2,000 to 2,500 men, with six guns. I have sent a steamboat to reconnoiter.

S. MEREDITH,

Brigadier-General.

Paducah:

Your dispatch of this date is received. Am much obliged for your attention, and would like you to give me the first intimation of the enemy's movements.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding.
