all evening without a quorum, and 1 hope we
will not adjourn.
Mr. TOWNSEND, of New York. I hope
we will.
Mr. RANDALL. If the gentleman from
New York wants to go home, he can do so.
Mr. SPEER, of Pennsylvania. This even-
ing and to-morrow evening have been set
apart for the consideration of reports from the
Committee on Invalid Pensions. That com-
mittee have had under consideration more bills
than any other committee. "When the House
is willing to go on considering these reports,
which have been carefully considered by the
Committee on Invalid Pensions, I do not see
why the gentleman from New York should
insist on his motion to adjourn. Let us go on
and finish the bills we have ready to report
this evening.
Mr. DOX. Is this motion debatable?
Mr. SPEER, of Pennsylvania. The gen-
tleman from New York can go home if he
wants to.
Mr. TOWNSEND, of New York. I am
much obliged to the gentleman, but I prefer
to remain here as long as the House is in
session.
Mr. SPEER, of Pennsylvania. It is of
great importance to many poor crippled sol-
diers throughout the country that we should
go on and complete this business.
Mr. TOWNSEND, of New York. I insist

Mr. STOUGHTON. I would inquire of the
gentleman from New Jersey [Mr. Bird] why
the petitioner does not receive a pension un-
der the existing laws?
Mr. BIRD. My recollection of the case is
that this application was made by the guardian
to the Commissioner, but from informalities in
the affidavits the pension was rejected by the
Department. Those informalities and irregu-
larities, in the judgment of the Committee on
Invalid Pensions, have been removed by sub-
sequent affidavits establishing the case to our
satisfaction.
Mr. RANDALL. I would also state to the
gentleman from Michigan [Mr. Stoughton]
that I have examined this matter very fully,
as the case is one which comes from my own
section, and I am satisfied that this child is
entitled to the pension. There was, as the
gentleman from New Jersey has stated, some
informality about the testimony.
Mr. BIRD. There were irregularities in the
testimony as supplied to the Department.

pose the time had elapsed within which appli-
cation could be made to the Commissioner.
