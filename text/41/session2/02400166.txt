APPENDIX TO THE CONGrEESSIONAL GLOBE.
[March 3,
Ho. of Reps.
The Tariff—Mr. Brooks.
41st Cong....2d Sess.
from Pennsylvania, [Mr. Kelley,] that this
bill did not increase the duties on the manu-
factures of iron and steel.
tin plates, tin pans, us kettles.
The following shows the proposed duty on
tin plates:
Letter from John D. Locke & Co., 47 Cliff street. New
York.
Tin plates arc now paying 25 percent, duty; and as
the pound sterling is fixed by law at $4 84 gold, the
following figures will show the result of the present
duty and of the new bill, which makes a specific
charge of 2* cents per pound without reference to
cost or quality. For example, a box of 10X14 X C tin
plate, weighs 112 pounds, and the range of prices for
the various qualities, during the past year, has been
from 21 shillings to 28 shillings per box in Liver
pool. Thus:
Shillings. Duty. At present.
At 2* cts.

I do not thiuk, however, from what I can
learn, and from the rattle of tin cans, tin cups,
and tin pans, which X hear from without, that
the majority of the Ways and Means will per-
sist in this enormous increase. The duty, I
believe, was proposed upon some claims for
some protection from some tin concern, some-
where in western Pennsylvania.
pry goods.
I hold in my hand a table, which is too long
to read just now, which has the sanction of the
house of A. T. Stewart and Co., of New York,
the gentleman who was nominated by General
Grant as Secretary of the Treasury, and which
shows the rate of duties on certain articles on
this bill, the rates now levied running from 52
per cent., the lowest rate, to 812- per cent., in
woolen blankets. This table includes broad-
cloths, balmorals, hosiery, and many other
things, too numerous to mention.
The following statement^ from the house of A. T. Stewart & (7o., New York) shows the duties on various descriptions of imported goods.
