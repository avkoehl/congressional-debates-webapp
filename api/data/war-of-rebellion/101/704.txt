I have gathered the above estimates from the books kept by me since I assumed charge of the duties of this office in August, 1864, and from the closest possible search of the imperfect records kept by Colonel Hanks in the early pat of the year, which, as you will see by his own returns,* herewith inclosed, marked A, B, and C, do not give prices or value of supplies drawn by him, excepting those of medicine. His letter to me, also inclosed herewith, affects to give his reasons for the imperfection of his records, as well as to be his answer to the requirements of Special Orders, Numbers 297, extract 3, headquarters Department of the Gulf, dated New Orleans, November 2, 1864, a copy of which I also inclose, marked D. * I believe, however, that my figures are as nearly correct as it is possible to have them, and that the total yearly cost of the care of freedmen in charge of this bureau is very nearly that above set forth.
