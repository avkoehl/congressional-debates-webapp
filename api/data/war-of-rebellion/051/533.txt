GENERAL ORDERS, ADJT. AND INSP. GENERAL'S OFFICE,

Numbers 64. Richmond, Va., August 10, 1864.

I. The following Roll of Honor is published in accordance with Paragraph I, General Orders, Numbers 131. (1863). It will be read to every regiment in the service at the first dress-parade after its receipt.

II. Attention is called to the manner in which the selections under the law should be made. The non-commissioned officers and privates are authorized, at the first dress-parade after each victory the company shall have assisted to achieve, to distinguish by a majority of their votes one private or non-commissioned officer most conspicuous for gallantry and good conduct in the battle. Should more than one soldier be hereafter selected by a company as equal in merit, the name to be announced upon the roll will be determined by lot. Commissioned officers distinguished for gallantry on the field are not to be selected by the vote of the company, battalion, or regiment to which they belong, but a statement of their special good conduct should be made by their immediate commander and forwarded through the regular channel to this office.
