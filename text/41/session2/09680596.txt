Mr. SUMNER. Let us have t.hp question I
put on the resolution. I
The VICE PRESIDENT. In the opinion' ]
of the Chair this should be a concurrent reso- j
lution, but in its language it is a joint resoln- j
tion. i
Mr. EDMUNDS. It ought to be concurrent.
The VICE PRESIDENT. It should be a
concurrent resolution.
Mr. SUMNER. Very well, let the resolu-
tion be changed to a concurrent resolution.
Mr. WILSON. I rise simply to say one
wojd. The law* as it now stands is complete in
itself. I shall not oppose, however, the pas-
sage of this resolution, as the matter has been
inaugurated, and I hope, as it has been intro-
duced, it will be putin proper form and passed.
I repeat, however, the law in itself is complete
and requires no legislation whatever, and I
trust that hereafter it will be so regarded.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The question is
on agreeing to the resolution.
The resolution was adopted unanimously.
MOKNING BUSINESSâ€”PETITIONS*, ETC.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senate now
resumes the consideration of the Virginia bill.
Mr. RAMSEY. As there is some morning
business not yet disposed of I move that the
Virginia bill be passed over informally for that
purpose.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator
from Minnesota moves that the Virginia bill
be passed over with the view of continuing the
morning business. Is there objection?
Mr. STEWART. I object. '
Several Senators. You had better let the
Virginia bill go over for a few minutes.
Mr. STEWART. If it is the general desire
of the Senate, I have no objection to allow fif-
teen minutes to be devoted to the morning busi-
ness.
Mr. RAMSEY. Say sixteen minutes.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator from
Nevada reserves his right to object; and the
morning business will continue until some Sen-
ator objects. Will that be sufficient.
Mr. STEWART. Yes, sir.

PERSONAL EXPLANATION, ETC.
Mr. THAYER. I ask the indulgence of the
Senate for two or three minutes, not longer,
to correct a report of my remarks made yester-
day morning. I find that I am reported thus :
" Ho believed it improper for any Department to
undertake to bring about legislation by circulating
the grossest misrepresentations uf fact."
I certainly did not make a remark of that
character. The remark which I did make as
to misrepresentations related to'general state-
ments which have been put in circulation, but
not by the Postmaster General. The abuses
of the franking privilege have been bad enough.
I desired to refer to the reckless statements
which had been made charging a great deal
more against the franking privilege than really
belonged to it. 'That was the only motive I
had. I have the fullest confidence in the Post-
master General; X know that he is actuated by
the best of motives, and is seeking to accomplish
the best purposes. I11 what he aims at in this
regard I support him ; but I do not agree as to
the mode which he has adopted to secure the
forwarding of petitions to Congress. I did not
intend to impute to him or to any head of
Department the circulation of any misrepre-
sentations.
Mr. THIIRMAN. I present a petition of
sundry citizens of Columbiana county, Ohio,
asking for the abolition of the franking privi-
lege, and I wish to say a single word in this
connection. This is one of many petitions all
evidently printed from the same type, in identi-
cally the same words and letters, and, as I
gather from what was said yesterday when I
was not present, but which I have read in the
reports, sent by the Post Office Department to
the various postmasters of the country to secure
signatures. I think such must be the case, for
of those I have received every one of them has
been sent to me by a postmaster, and this par-
ticular one comes with a list which the same
postmaster sends me, with the name of nearly
every petitioner on it begging me to frank him
some documents. This is a rather singular
commentary on the petition.
I do not quite agree with the Senator from
Nebraska if I understood him aright as saying
that this is not an improper practice. I may
be found voting to abolish the franking privi-
lege ; I will determine that after I have invest-
igated the question; but I do not think it is
right for a Department of this Government to
use the postmasters of this Government to get
up petitions to Congress on a one-sided state-
ment of the facts. I do not think that it is
proper that the head of a Department of the
Government of the United States should pro-
duce factitious public sentiment in this way. I
do not know that the fact is so; but if what
was said in the Senate yesterday be true, if
these petitions have their origin in the Post
Office Department, and are brought here
through the agency of the various postmasters
of the country, I do not think that is a proper
mode to influence the action of Congress.
The petition was referred to the Committee
on Post Offices and Post Roads.
