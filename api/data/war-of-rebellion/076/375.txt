HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, near Atlanta, August 5, 1864.

General STANLEY:

A heavy movement of troops is reported out of Atlanta, south through White Hall. Let your extreme left feel forward strong and fire half dozen shots with artillery in quick succession or by volleys, something different from the usual way.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS FOURTH ARMY CORPS,August 5, 1864--10 p. m.

Brigadier-General KIMBALL,

Commanding First Division, Fourth Army Corps:

Direct the artillery on your front to fire six volleys at intervals of ten minutes into Atlanta. Let your skirmishers keep up fire and notice if the rebels return fire. Do you see any sign of their quitting? If so, push skirmishers up. General Sherman thinks they may quit. Our forces did nothing on the right to-day. Baird captured 150 on skirmish line, but not being supported fell back to his intrenchments. Please answer.

D. S. STANLEY,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,In the Field, August 5, 1864.

Brigadier-General WILLIAMS,

Commanding Twentieth Army Corps:

Major-General Sherman reports that he can hear musketry on the front of Generals Palmer and Schofield and concludes that they must be engaged. The major-general commanding directs that you observe well the indications of the battle, and if there is any move of our troops toward the town that you be prepared to take advantage of it.

Very respectfully,

WM. D. WHIPPLE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
