HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, January 1, 1864.

CONFEDERATE CORRESPONDENCE, RTC.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA,August 4, 1863.

General S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General, Richmond:

GENERAL: The movement of the enemy north of the rappahannock, rendering it difficult for me to ascertain whether he intended to advance through Culpeper or fall down the river to Fredericksburg, determined me to unite the army south of the Rapidan. General Ewell's corps, which after crossing the Blue Ridge had been posted in Madison, had been previously ordered to Orange Court-house.

Longstreet's and Hill's corps were yesterday ordered to the rapidan. I could find no field in Culpeper offering advantages for battle, and any taken could be so easily avoided the enemt wish to reach the south bank of the rapidan, that I thought it advisable at once to retire to that bank. Should he advance by this route, I shall endeavor to resist him; and if he falls down to Fredericksburg, will oppose him on that line.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. E. LEE,

General.

WELDON, August 4, 1863.

General S. COOPER:

Following dispatch received;

My scouts from nansemond report that general getty's brigade is preparing to move, some say to Charleston, some to petersburg, others to meade; but my scouts think he will join Colonel Spear, who is preparing for another raid. Colonel Spear is going to move his headquarters to between Norfolk and Edenton. Five thousand infantry and 2,000 cavalry in force at Norfolk and Portsmouth-so estimated.

J. F. MILLIGAN,

Major, and Signal Officer.

M. W. RANSOM,

Brigadier-General.
