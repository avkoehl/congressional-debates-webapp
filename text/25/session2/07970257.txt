which, of all the banks, would succeed m the con-
test for Congressional favors? Would not the
Bank of the United States—the controlling centre
of the paper system—she whose friends already
throng these halls—she who is already so deeply
skilled m political facilities—would she not stand
triumphant in our midstf Yes, the same vote
which could pass this substitute, would give her the
deposites, and thus that institution would again be-
come a National Bank, with all the powers and
immunities she before enjoyed, without any of the
restraints or responsibilities imposed by a Congres-
sional charter. And here, sir, I shall express it as
my deliberate opinion, that every man of the Oppo-
sition will sustain this substitute, and that, too,
with a view to the very result I havs anticipated
Those who desire the concentration of the money
power in a National Bank, will ask for none better
than the Bank of the United States will become,
should this measure be adopted Nor will that in-
stitution desire or accept of a national charter, if
it can obtain the public moneys under the less em-
barrassing charter it now enjoys.
These, sir, are my opinions The subject of a
National Bank will still be urged before the people,
but notsenouslydesired, oythepoliticalleaders They
are not the men to pursue visionary forms, to the
neglect of substantial realities Their object is the
concentration and union of the money with the po-
litical power of the country, and they see in every
line of the substitute before us the certain accom-
plishment of that object.
And now, sir, standing in my place, and in the
immediate presence of the American people, 1 pro-
nounce it as the solemn conviction of my judgment,
that this union, should i* te eifected—the union of
the banking or paper system with the Govern-
ment—will prostrate the liberties of the countrj,
and that this prostration will continue until that in-
born love of freedom, the peculiar inheritance of
this nation, shall rise to restore those liberties by
the only means which despotism cannot withstand.
In such a union, in such a compound of the money
with the political power, it would be utterly
immaterial which of the elements predominated—
whether that of the Government, or of the
banks The junction of the two would speedily
result in blending both into one, and it is
this consolidation, this aggregation, of powers
so vast in the same men, it is this which would
enable those men to override the liberties of the
country What, then, sir, would be our condition,
if the very men who are now struggling to effect
this consolidation should succeed, and having suc-
ceeded, should, by that very success, place them-
selves tn possession of these powers thus consoli-
dated? Would not the fact of their success, m
this effort, be proof conclusive of the dangerous
strength oí the banking system, which is now their
sole support1 and would not that strength, united
with the powers of Government, enable th< se men
to perpetuate their reign, and to spurn, with impu-
nity, the complaints of a betrayed and ruined
people?
How, then, can w e adopt a measure fraught
with consequences so momentous, so fatal, as
these' How can -Re sit and hear, wnh patience,
a demand thus made of the whole revenues of the
Republic—made, as a political nght, by private
corporations—made upon principles tending infal-
libly to a revolution of the Government' Shall
we sit and hear, unmoved, hear without a becom-
ing spirit of resistance, a pioposilion so wounding
to every sense of patriotism, so plainly destructive
of the liberties of the country' Wheie, Senators,
are the souls of your sires? Did you inherit no-
thing from them but freedom—freedom without
the spirit to defend if* Are you thus destitute, and
will you betray the only country where abides the
only hope to solace the sufferings of mankind?
If not, how can you, how dare you suppo't
a measure which is to place such a country
as this under the vulgar despotism of a moneyed
monopoly?
GRADUYTIOJ." or THF PRICE OF PUBLIC LAXDfe
SPEECHOFMR CLAY,
Of Alabama.
In Senate, March 29, 1838—The " bill providing
for the reduction  and graduation of the price of
the public lands" having been taken up for con-
sideration—
Mr CLAY of Alabama addressed the Senate, in
substance, as follows.
Mr President It is cause of gratulation, not
only with their several delegations, but with the
people, generally, of the new States, as they are
familiarly called, that there is, at length, a disposi-
tion manifested by the Senate to give to the matters
involved in this bill that examination and delibera-
tion which their great importance to the interests
and prospenty of those States would seem to de-
mand Impressed with a deep sense of the justice,
as well as the sound policy, of such a measure, the
Legislatures of the States embracing the public do-
main, and the people of those States n their pri-
mary assemblies, through their resolves ard memo-
rials have repeatedly, and year after jear, for
the last twelve c fifteen, most earnestly invoked
the attention and action of Congress Xc r is it
remarkable that those States should evince such
solicitude on this subject, when we reflect (n the
difference between cultivated fields, abounding m
the rich and varied productions of their several por-
tions of the country—not only adding to their owr
strength and resources, but increasing those of the
whole Union—and the wild, unbroken forest, or
waste and unproductive territory
It is true, sir, our humb'e petitions have been re-
ceived during the period alluded to, and generally
referred in each House, to the conmittee having
charge of subjects connected with the public lands
In several instances, bills have been reponed by
those committees, m principle somewnat like tne
one now before us, but in no instance, do I recol-
lect, within the last seven or eight >ear>, has either
House gone farther than to receive such report and
place the bill on the calendar, there to remain un-
touched, and stand over amongst the unfinished
business of each successive session. Yea, sir,
whilst days, and even weeks, have been devoted to
the consideration of local subjects and individual
claims, I have often felt mortified and humiliated
that not one hour was vouchsafed to the discussion
of this question, involving directly the paramount
interests of more than one third of the States, and,
in a more remote degree, the welfare of the entire
Union.
Although discouraged by these repeated failures
and disappointments, we have not despaired, but
confiding m the good faith of our coumr\, w e hav e
continued our annual appeals to her justice and
magnanimity A blessing is promised, bj die high-
est authority, to those uho hold on! to the end I am
so far a believer as nev er to despan in a good
cause, and I trust we shall, to some extent, realize
the benefits of such perseverance on this occasion
I am persuaded, Mr Presilent, that all that is
necessary io insure success to this bill, or some si-
milar measure, is for gentlemen to examine, and
understand its provisions I do not ask gentlemen
to take for gianted, or yield implicit assent to, the
representations which ma) be made by the friend-,
of the bill, but, at the same time, I trust the} w ill
not take on faith, the objections or the asstr'wns oí
its opponents Wtth some member* on this floor
I have been sorry to observe a kind of nervous ex-
citability, whenever a proposition is submitted in
refeience to the public domain, especialh if tfcat
proposition should come from a member of a new
State We hear it frequently said, or insinuated
in substance, that the people of the new States w i<¡h
to obtain the public lands without the pav ment oi
any consideration, or for a vetv inadequate one
Sir, said Mr ¿¡.nothing is laither from the fact
The inhabitants of those States as seMom a^k do-
nations of public land as those of the older member,
of the Confederacy. When they ask the right ot
pre-emption for settlers and occupants, who hav e
improved and given greater value to, and accele-
rated the sales of, the public domain, thev do not
ask them as agifi, but the application is alwavs ac-
companied b} the offer to paj the minimum price
1 —the same pnce you obtain from the monopolist
and speculator, who never contributed an wta to
the improvement of the country, or t© the interest
of the Government When they ask yon to reduce
and graduate the price of interior land, which has
been offered at public sale, and refused, then, ano
for years afterwards, at $ 1 25 per acre, they do
not ask yon to take less than its value. No, sir
the proposition is, that you mil sell if, i« a reasona
ble time, at itsfmr value, to be ascertained either by
tne length of time it may have remained in market
unsold, or by any other just criterion of value
The imp itation that the new States, or their repre-
sentatives, wish to rob the nation of the public do-
mam, or even to obtain it without the payment of
a fair price, is wholly unfounded They only ask
the adoption of just principles m the sale of it, and
permission to take it on the payment of a fair and
full equivalent It may, indeed, become a question
with the old States, as well as the new ones, whether
it will be sound policy for the General Government
to retain the millions of acres, w hich may be found
in all of them, so bairen and stenle as not to com-
m?nd tuehe and a half cents, six anda quarter cents,
or, perhaps, one ce-,4, per acre, and which, coase-
aueiuly must cease to furnish a source of mdem-
nuy, even for the expense of keeping the land of-
fi es, indispensable to afford an opportunity to pur
chase That question, however, does not present
itself on this occasion, and may be safely left to the
determination of those who will follow us. "Suf-
ficient unto the day is the evil thereof "
Sir, said Mr C the enlightened views of the
present Chief Magistrate, upon this subject, com-
municated m his annual message, however some
of us may differ with him in opinion, as regards
the particular mode of effectuating the object m
contemplation, show that he has devoted to it the
a ention due to its importance, and are worthy of
all commendation The President i ^iews are set
torth, upon everv branch of ourpohcj, connected
with tne sale and disposition of the public dt-
ma n, with such character -ticforce and per^picuitv,
that I am almost asicnished that an} statesman
can withhold his assent to some such course as
he has recommended. After some general re-
marks upon the system, under which the public
domain has been hitherto managed, he introduces the
subject embraced by the bill under consideration,
by remarking- " The modification most persever-
mgly pressed upon Congress, which has occupied
so much of its time for years past, and will proba-
bly do so for a long time to come, if not sooner
satisfactorily adjusted, is a reduction in the cost ot
such portions of the public lands, as are ascer-
ta ned to be unsalable at the rate now established
b> law, and a eiaduation, according (o their rela-
tive value of the prices at which thej may here-
after be sold It is vrorthv of consideration whether
justice ma} not be done to everv interest in this
matter, and a v exea question set ai rest, perhaps
foiever, bj a reasonable compromise of conflict-
ing opinions Hitherto, after being offered at pub-
lic sale, lands have been deposed oí at an uniform
price, whatever difference theie might be in their
intrinsic value" Again, he adds ' ,qu tcill con-
pede tne abstia tpnnciple, that the pi ice of the pub-
lic lands should bt pi oportioned to their relative lalue,
-o far a^ can be accomplished, without departing
rom the rule heretofore observed, requiring fixed
price* in cases or pmate entries The difficulty
ot the subject seems to Hem the modeofaseei-
ta mng w hat that \ alue is ' Sir, no man can

down Its mere statement i  s iffctent to es'-Ori sh

Mr President, said Mr C I ha\e given, this
subject much attention during the last seven or
eight vears, ard I have kng since formed tne
opinion thai the price might be gtadtuled with süf-
iicent accuracj, «"ending to tne timt the land shall
