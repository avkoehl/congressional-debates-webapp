own looking for the stragglers from Porter's main body. Eight miles from Edina they espied Colonel Frisby H. McCullough, who had abandoned Porter and was now alone, making his way eastward. Espying them he entered the brush. They surrounded the place. One brave man, Mr. Holmes, of Edina, volunteered to penetrate the lair of the lion. He did so. McCullough raised his rifle and threatened to kill him if he did not instantly retire. Nothing daunted, Mr. Holmes also raised his gun and demanded an instant surrender. The brave colonel saw the odds against him and surrender. They convoyed him to Edina; placed him in charge of Captain Sells. The next morning a train with an armed escort proceeded from Edina to Kirksville. McCullough was sent along. On arriving at Kirksville the news of the capture of this famous guerrilla excited the utmost enthusiasm among our troops. He was martial was held and he was sentenced to be shot that very afternoon. He received the information of his fate with considerable composure but protested against it. Leaning against the fence he wrote a few lines to his wife. These with his watch he delivered to the officer to be given to her. Upon the way to his execution he requested the privilege to give the command to fire, which was granted. All being ready, he said: "What I have done I have done as a principle of right. Aim at the heart. Fire!" The command taking the soldiers by surprise, one fired sooner than the rest. The ball entering his breast, he fell, while the other shots passed over him. Falling with one leg doubled under the body, he requested to have it straightened out. While this was being done he said: "I forgive you for this barbarous act. " The squad having reloaded their pieces, another volley was fired, this time into his body, and he died. His remains were committed to friends in the place.

HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF EAST TENNESSEE,Knoxville, Tenn., September 14, 1862.

Brigadier General C. L. STEVENSON, Commanding First Division, Army of East Tennessee.

GENERAL: Yours of to-day has been received. * The major-general commanding approves of the course you took in regard to the exchange of the prisoners, and further directs that you retaliate to the fullest extent should General Morgan inflict punishment on a single one of them. You will see from the accompanying muster-roll of Jessee's company that the organization was lawful, though not full; they had authority to recruit. All the troops possible to be collected are being concentrated at Clinton and Big Creek Gap, and will continue to be. Colonel Smith's legion is by this at Big Creek Gap; Capers' (200 men) at Jacksborough; Reeves' battalion (500 men) at Clinton; convalescents (2,000 men) at Clinton. McDowell, now at Greeneville, will be armed and sent forward at once, as arms arrived to-day. Lieutenant [A. H.] Sevier, aide-de-camp of General Churchill, and perhaps other members of his staff accompanied them; also some members of [T. M.] Nelson's Georgia Rangers, a company now with General Smith. As soon as the scattered forces can be concentrated the major-general will join you.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. S. BRADFORD,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
