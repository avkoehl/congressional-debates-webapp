CITY POINT, VA., October 20, 1864-7.30 p. m.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Chief of Staff:

Has Rosecrans yet come upon Price? If he has not he should be removed at once. Price is in a country where he supports his army without difficulty, and there is no reason why our forces should not move without any delay. Of all the generals whose names have been mentioned in connection with the successorship and are available I prefer Logan. Anybody, however, will be better than Rosecrans.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF WEST MISSISSIPPI,New Orleans, La., October 20, 1864.

Rear-Admiral FARRAGUT,

Commanding West Gulf Blockading Squadron:

ADMIRAL: Since writing to you on the 18th I have received information which leads me to believe that the rebels will attempt to cross at or about Gaines' Landing. This district, I find, has fewer heavy boats than any other district on the river, and I think it will be advisable to send three or four boats tot he mouth of Red River. I am not satisfied with the delay made by the rebel commissioners of exchange in not sending down our prisoners. It may cover some ulterior object, and I wish to be provided for it. I have sent troops to watch the movements of the rebels on the Red River, and if you can spare two or three gunboats to replace [those] that may be sent up the river I think I shall be abel to meet all contingencies.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

E. R. S. CANBY,

Major-General, Commanding.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF WEST MISSISSIPPI,New Orleans, La., October 20, 1864.

TO NAVAL COMMANDERS FIRST, SECOND, THIRD, FOURTH, FIFTH, AND SIXTH DISTRICTS, BELOW VICKSBURG, MISSISSIPPI SQUADRON:

SIR: I have asked Admiral Farragut to send some heavy gun-boats to the mouth of Red River, to replace any of that class that you may think it advisable to send up the Mississippi in anticipation of the projected crossing by the rebels. My information leads to the belief that the crossing under Jeff. Davis' last order will be attempted in the vicinity of Gaines' Landing, but it may be attempted lower down. If you should find it necessary to send any of the heavy gun-boats from your district I will endeavor to have them replaced by arrangement with Admiral Farragut and Commodore Palmer.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

E. R. S. CANBY,

Major-General, Commanding.
