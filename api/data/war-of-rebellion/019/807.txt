to report that all is quiet on the frontier. To-day I have directed that Vincent Marmaduke, a disloyal member of the State Convention, be permitted to give his parole to leave the State within ten days and not return during the war. Sample Orr, another disloyal member of the State Convention, and register of lands in Jefferson City, who I had confined for uttering disloyal sentiments in delivering a speech in Jefferson, was released by order of Governor Gamble. Whilst gentlemen who occupy high official positions are allowed to preach treason in the capital of the State it will require the most active, zealous, and energetic action on the part of the loyal troops to preserve law and order.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

BEN. LOAN,

Brigadier-General, Missouri State Militia.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

JAS. G. BLUNT,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
