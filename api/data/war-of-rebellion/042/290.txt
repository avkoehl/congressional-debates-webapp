HDQRS. DISTRICT TEXAS, NEW MEXICO, AND ARIZONA,Houston, Tex., October 9, 1863.

Gov. F. R. LUBBOCK,

Austin, Tex.:

GOVERNOR: I am instructed by Major-General Magruder to request that you will forthwith concentrate, with or without the consent of the Legislature, this being beyond doubt a military necessity, in his opinion, the Frontier Regiment or any other troops of this nature which you may have at Fort Belknap. It is important that this should be done with the utmost rapidity, in order to anticipate and prevent a raid which the Indians are certainly expected to make into the frontier counties some time in November.

Brigadier-General McCulloch, commanding the Northern Sub-District, is authorized to appoint as many officers as may be necessary to organize these commands, and have them ready for service. The whole, when organized, will be under his entire control and subject to his orders.

I am, Governor, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

EDMUND P. TURNER,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF TEXAS, &amp;C.,Houston, October 6, 1863.

Brigadier-General McCULLOCH,

Commanding Northern Sub-District, Bonham:

GENERAL: I am instructed by Major-General Magruder to acknowledge receipt of your communication of the 28th ultimo, with inclosures, and to say that the "pacific measures" adopted by you meet with his approval, and he trusts that it may produce the desired result.

The major-general commanding fully empowers you to retain and organize the absent officers and men that are reporting to you, that their services may be availed of against the Indians and other enemies.

By the inclosed orders and letters, you will observe that Captain John R. Baylor, with his company of Ladies' Rangers, is ordered into your district, and the Governor and minute-men have been appealed to. Major-General Magruder assures you that everything in his power will be done to assist you in protecting that exposed frontier, and that all be done to assist you in protecting that exposed frontier, and that all unnecessary interference will be avoided. He will acknowledge the private portion of your letter, and furnish such officers as he can spare at an early day.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

EDMUND P. TURNER,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
