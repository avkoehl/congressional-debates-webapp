of its redemption But, m the admimstiation of
our fiscal concerns, it has alwajs been very desira-
ble to avoj the want of umfoimtty, and the delay
or expense, and sometimes the loss, incident to the
receipt for lands or duties of such notes ,f redeema-
ble at a distance, and which then would sometimes
occur before they could be convei ted into specie,
. or such money as the public creditor was bound or
willing to accept. In order, therefore, to prevent
those injurious conseqaenees, one mode has b°en
to accept no State bank notes w hatever for public
dues, as is now, and sometimes heretofore was, the
practice m respect to lands Anothei has been,
to permit none to be taken except such as, undei
permission of the Treasury Department, the col-
Iscting officers or the public depositories were will-
ing at once to credit as specie
In our early operations, foi purposes of facilita-
ting remittances to the Treasury, quite as much as
for accommodation to othois, collectois were in-
structed to receive ceitain Stale bank notes, paya-
ble near the seat of Government, and which vv ere
to be credited as cash when forwarded by mail, or
otheiwise, to the Tieasurer The justification
offered for this course may be seen m a re-
port from this depaitment in April, 1790 The
situation of the country, howevei, as to ease
m communication, iaciluy in exchanges, and
the neaier location of many points of collec
tion to those of expenditures, has since under-
gone such great improvements, as tor a long
time to have rendered the recipt of notes to aid in
public transfers seldom necessary, and almost en-
tirely disused Another mode adopted by Congiess
has been, to render the receipts of the notes of
State banks, for any purpose less material, by
providing those of a bank chaiteied by the Gene-
rol Government, and making thebe last, by kw, íe-
ceivable for all public dues But tins mode has
ceased, and the legality as well as sound policy of
the practive to receive the notes of State banks for
any public dues, whether done with a view to fis-
cal or general convenience, and though under all
the strict limitations before mentioned, has been
questioned bj some Others haie considered any
limitation whatever, by eithei the Executive or this
department, as not justifiable since the joint resolu-
tion of 1816 It is, therefore, respe tfully suggest-
ed, that a strong propriety exists for i. ongress to le
gislate more explicitly on the whole subject
It may be pioper and useful to t >d, that as
most of the duties on imposts have been discharged
in checks on the bank wnere the bonds weic depo-
sited for collection, or in us own notes, and seldoir
m those of banks at any distance, little embarrass-
ment has ever alisen oonct rnmg the payments for
duties in bank notes But, in taking them foi
lands, the remote situation of the purchasers, the
receivers, and the banks, has generally been such
that frequent difficulties and changes m practice
have occurred dunng the period while the United
States Bank and its branches, as well as the State
banks, were employed as depositories In our
mixed system of a currency, and one so long and
so deeply interwoven with the business of the coun-
try, it was very inconvenient entirely to avoid, and
at the same time occasionally dangerous to permit,
taking the bills oí any State bank for lands, and the
receipt of such notes was obliged to be either so
restricted as to prove of lutle convenience to the
cormrrumty, or a nsk was incurred of many partial
arrangements being made, and some ultimate inju-
ries sustained by the Treasury
Under all these circumstances, the course least
liable tu strong objections appears to be for Con-
gress to piescribe some specific regulations on the
whole subject
This could be effected by directiig what alone
appears safe, and what is undeistood to be the prac-
tice m both England and Fnnce It is, that the
bills of no local banks be taken, which shall not,
fiom the near location of the bank, be equivalent
to specie, be able to be converted into specie at very
shoif periods by the receivers and collectors, so as
to pay the public credi'ors legally, if demanding
specie, and be thus accounted for af pai, and with-
out expense to the Government. Another advan-
tage fiom this course would be, its salutary check
on Ovei-issues by the neighboring banks.
The occasional convenience of ? sound paper
currency for various purposes, whether natioial or
individual, such as larg-1 pay mente, di tant remit-
tances, exchange , or tiavcllng, is highly ta'ued
by some, an', where gold does not circulate, is
often very consideiable But the difficulties m
keeping it sound, the haztrds and losses medent to
its use, and which have airead) been explained,
arc tioublesome Should Congress determine that
it is proper to furnish by its own auttionty, and tor
the purposes before mentioned, some piper me-
dium, oí higher chaiacter and othci thin what now
exis's, m private bills of ex.cnangc or notes of
State banks, no doubt exists that any benelirs which
may occasionally be derived from its employment
can be readily secured, v >thout Heading on the de-
batable ground ol enher the po >er or the pohcy of

The present branches of the mint, ir tut numer-

the receipt of specie and bullion for this purpose
might be aided by two or three agencies, instead of
more expensive new branches, at points favorable
to the interests of the mint and of the community
It must be obvious that the paper of any bank
will be less safe and useful in being received for
public dues, m pioportion as it may want such
solid s'cunties and foundations as the certificates
b fore described But if the notes of State banks
are made receiv able for such dues, under certain
limitations like those which hav e been explained,
Ihj ol1 et most desnable guaranties for their safety,
w hether looking to any use of then by the Gene-
ral Government, or to the durable interests of the
Sta'es themselves, seem to be for t1 e latter, first,
to impose on the existing banks, so far as lawful,
the cVcks mentioned in a subsequent part of this
co nmunical on They could next authorize veiy
f w banks hercaftei, except those of meie dis-
count an 1 deposite, and where the powei of miking
paper issues to p"ss as money is "dded—a power
so sovereign in its character, and so indispensable
to be vigilantly guarded, could require a large
proportion of specie to the circulation and depo-
si es to be kept on hand, and, in addition, have
the Ca th tnd security of tne State pledged to
ndemmfy the community, as, in the case of
the above named certificates, would be pledged
those of the Geneial Government This would
grcat'y mcierse the ciution and watchfulness of
all concerned, an i could be done Dy special laws
for 'hat puipose, or by allowing no new banks
