HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF EASTERN ARKANSAS,Helena, Ark., June 12, 1864.

Major General C. C. WASHBURN,

Commanding District of West Tennessee:

DEAR SIR: I send my assistant adjutant-general, Captain T. C. Meatyard, to you. I have complied with your request in returning to Memphis the detachment of 200 men of the Sixth Tennessee Cavalry, dismounted.

By General Steele's order I am this day sending him one company, recruited and mounted at this post, of the Fourth Arkansas Cavalry and two of my best colored companies. A short time ago, by his orders, I sent him two companies of the Ninth Wisconsin. I feel certain that he would not have ordered my force to be thus reduced did he not think I had received other troops from above.

I have official papers here which induced me to think the Sixth Minnesota and the Fourth Iowa were to be here. I have not enough troops for the daily duties of the post and its defense. Of white troops I have only 238 infantry and 287 cavalry. Inclosed I send you General Canby's order, Numbers 6,* to hold reserves to act in the case of the river being blockaded below. I send Captain Meatyard to you to request that you give me some good troops. Could you not send me the Twelfth Iowa Veterans? I have 50 men of that regiment at the mouth of White River. There may be a necessity of my sending a force to the relief of that place at any moment. I commenced Captain Meatyard to your kind consideration as an officer of merit.

I have the honor to be, your obedient servant,

N. B. BUFORD,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
