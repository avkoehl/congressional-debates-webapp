Brigadier-General WHIPPLE,Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: I have the honor to report that I am just starting on the march. I wish to move six or eight miles out on the Pulaski pike, to get out of the way of the cavalry and such other troops as may cross to-night. I do not think the cavalry will all get over the river much before dark. Please allow the remnant of my artillery and trains to cross the pontoons to-night.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

HEADQUARTERS FOURTH ARMY CORPS, Squire Mack's, Five Miles from Columbia, December 23, 1864-6.30 p .m.

Brigadier-General WHIPPLE,Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: I advanced the corps five miles upon the Pulaski pike, and occupy a position about two miles in advance of the cavalry. The position is a gorge between ridges closing down on either side of the road. The gorge was occupied by a force of rebel cavalry, about a brigade, which was readily dispersed by the advance of a skirmish line and a section of artillery. Casualties, so far as known, one rebel captain mortally wounded, who fell into our hands. I will wait to-morrow morning a reasonable time for the cavalry to move out, and if it does not do so I will advance down the pike toward Pulaski.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

TH. J. WOOD,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
