Major-General Sheridan,

Commanding Cavalry Corps:

The major-general commanding directs me to inform you that General Burnside will not occupy the line of the Matadequin, but will merely throw back his right to Bosher's. The cavalry on the right should, therefore, picket from that vicinity across to the Pamunkey passing near Linnery's where the cavalry brigade should be, instead of at Old Church. I inclose tracing of sketch+ showing position of Bosher's, &amp;c.
