three pounds coffee to the hundred men. This is the best that can be done under the existing state of things. the law regulating the rations is most liberal and the ration table in superabundant, but for over two years it has been impossible to meet their requirements and the ration has been gradually declining. As time advances the funds for procuring subsistence become less and less devisable and available, and the obstacles to collecting what is in the county increase in like ratio.

In addition to the depreciation in the currency, a further and very great difficulty has been experienced in obtaining money. The Treasury has generally failed, and particularly since April 1 ultimo, to respond with promptness to requisitions, until now it owes this department $35,500,000, and though this Bureau has paid out more bonds and certificates of indebtedness than all other bureaus of the War Department put together, it has yet been unable, owing to the above-stated deficiency in funds, either to make sufficient purchases or enforce impressments when they have been resisted. The cure or mitigation of these evils is matter of legislation in finance, taxation, and impressment. My policy, as exhibited in my letter to Major Moses and the accompanying circular, herewith inclosed,* is what I would recommend for impressments. Still another difficulty arises from the actual scarcity of supplies. There is not enough meat for a full supply for all, and this excites the fears and avidity of all, individually and collectively, to change their depreciating currency into substantial commodities, and while all others crave and are generally allowed a full supply the commissariat must do its best in gleaning industriously. But this deficiency of meat is not the most formidable feature. Bread threatens to be deficient at an early day, as has been often reported to you, and had the ration not been kept to one pound for the last five months there would not now be one pound on hand. At present there is not here or en route over twenty-five days' rations for 100,000 men, whilst the area for subsistence is being steadily desolated by the enemy. These deliberate attempts to destroy the fruits of the earth, begun cautiously and, as it were, experimentally at first, have now become the system; this renders us more than ever dependent on transportation which has been steadily failing.

Our connection with Southwestern Georgia and Alabama has not been adequate to collect supplies of corn here, and these resources are now cut off, and the Danville and Greensborough railroads are our only connection with the two Carolinas. All inland contracts or attempts proved abortive; in two instances by the interference of our generals, and in others by changes of circumstances and by views of general policy. It appears now that our generals are authorized to regulate the trade. Foreign importations ought to be pressed. these have been resorted to as far as funds could be procured or contracts made. But the Treasury has refused to furnish cotton and has been unable to furnish cash except in very limited quantities, and its policy to import under the regulations has failed to get meat. Blockaders seek freight of great condensed value and little specific gravity; therefore meat is not brought in when it can be avoided, and the regulations, whether appropriate or not for other departments, have not succeeded in bringing meat from abroad, either as original purchases or as freight. In fact, what has been accumulated at the islands has not
