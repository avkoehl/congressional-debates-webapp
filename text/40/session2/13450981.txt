COUNSEL IN RECONSTRUCTION CASES.
I Mr. HOWARD. I ask leave to introduce a
joint resolution, and I ask the present action
j of the Senate upon it.
By unanimous consent leave was granted to
introduce a joint resolution (S. R. No. 99) to
authorize the Secretary of War to employ
I counsel in certain cases ; which was read twice
(I by its title.
|j Mr. POMEROY. I should like to have the
j resolution read and acted upon now. I know
j! what it is. I have seen the Secretary of War,
II and he wants immediate action.
The Secretary read the resolution, which
proposes to authorize the Secretary of War to
employ counsel for the defense of the General
of the Army, Major General George G. Meade,
and Brevet Brigadier General Thomas H.
Ruger, provisional governor of Georgia, and
any other officer or person intrusted with the
enforcement of the reconstruction acts, or either
of them, against any suit or proceeding in any
court in relation to their official acts.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Sen-
ator from Michigan asks for the present con-
sideration of the joint resolution. It requires
unanimous consent. Is there any objection?
Mr. HENDRICKS. I wish to inquire of the
Senator from Michigan what necessity there is
for this resolution, inasmuch as it is a well
known fact that the Departments, including
the War Department, are in the habit of em-
ploying counsel in cases where, in the opinion
of the heads of Departments, it becomes neces-
sary.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Does the
| Senator object to the present consideration of
the joint resolution? If he does it must go
over.
Mr. HENDRICKS. I shall not object if it
be necessary; but I wish to make an inquiry,
not to debate it. I desire to inquire why it is
necessary to pass this resolution, in view of
the fact that the Departments, including the
War Department, have been in the habit of
employing counsel at their discretion?
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. No objec-
tion being made to the present consideration
of the resolution it is before the Senate as in
Committee of the Whole.
Mr. HOWARD. The best explanation that
can be made is found in a letter from the Sec-
retary of War, which I beg leave to send to
the Chair.
Mr. POMEROY. The Secretary of War
thinks there is no authority of law authorizing
him to employ counsel. Heads of Depart-
ments have sometimes employed counsel, but
it has been objected to, and he regards the
authority as somewhat doubtful.
Mr. HOWARD. I send the letter to the
Chair, and ask that it be read.
; The Secretary read the following letter:
' "War Department,
Washington City, February 5,1868.
Sir: General Meade and General Ruger. in Geor-
1 gia, have applied to this Department to defend them
in a suit about to be prosecuted in the Supreme
Court of the United States by the latcGovernor Jen-
i kins against them for an injunction against their
official acts under the reconstruction acts oj Congress,
j I would respectfully rccommend the immediate pas-
] sage of a joint resolution authorizing the Secretary
! of War to employ counsel for the purpose indicated.
The power might be exercised, perhaps, without such
, special authority; but it might be well for Congress
to indicate its view for their indemnification.
Yours, truly,
E. M. STANTON, Secretary of War.
Hon. Henry Wilson, Chairman of Military Commit-
tee of (he Senate.
Mr. JOHNSON. I have no objection to the
passage of the resolution if it be necessary;
but without knowing what are the questions
which are involved in the case which it is sup-
posed is about to be brought into the Supreme
Court of the United States I cannot imagine
' why the Attorney General of the United States
| cannot appear.
Mr. SHERMAN. My friend from Mary-
land is not aware, perhaps, that the Attorney
General is placed in a very awkward position;
he has expressed an opinion, I understand, that
the laws are unconstitutional, and hence has
; declined to appear.
i Mr. JOHNSON. The honorable member
does not understand me. I said that without
knowing what were the questions which are to
be brought before the Supreme Court I should
be unwilling to authorize the Secretary of War
or any other Secretary to employ counsel to
defend the United States or any officer acting
under the authority of the United States in the
Supreme Court. If the questions which it is
supposed will be involved in the case which it
is apprehended will be brought against General
Meade and General Ruger involve the inquiry
as to the constitutionality of these laws, that
is another question.
Mr. SHERMAN. It is confined to that.
Mr. JOHNSON. Is it confined to that?
Mr. SHERMAN. The resolution is con-
fined to cases growing up under the reconstruc-
tion acts.
Mr. JOHNSON. I did not hear it in that
way. Let it be read again.
The Secretary again read the joint resolution.
Mr. HOWARD. It is notorious that the
Attorney General of the United States, whose
duty it would be ordinarily to appear as counsel
for the War Department of the Government,
and whose duty it is by the law of the land so to
appear, has, upon a very important occasion,
declined to appear for that Department in the
Supreme Court. He has refused to discharge his
duty, because it seems that he has solemnly pre-
judged the whole case itself. He has come to
the conclusion that ourwhole system of recon-
struction acts is unconstitutional and void;
and therefore his professional conscience, for
which I suppose we ought to entertain a very
high respect, does not permit him to appear as
counsel for the authorities of the United States
