your dispatch of the 21st, will be ordered to return at once to their regiments in the vicinity of Warrenton.

(Received July 26, 12. 30 a. m.)

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

Your telegram of 12. 30 p. m. is received. I telegraphed you on the 19th instant. After that date, being away from telegraphic communication, and the guerrillas rendering the transmission of dispatches insecure, I did not telegraph till the 23d, as there was nothing particular to communicate, and nothing definite known of the enemy. When I left the Potomac River. I requested the quartermaster's and commissary departments to throw supplies to Warrenton and Warrenton Junction. After I found the movements of the enemy might detain me from reaching Warrenton as soon as originally expected, I requested the chief and acting chief of those departments to have a limited amount of supplies sent to White Plains, to meet contingencies. The chiefs of these departments with me were fully apprised of my views and plans as soon as they were formed. As soon as I had crossed the river, I sent two brigades of cavalry to guard the Orange and Alexandria road and its branch to Warrenton, and the very moment my army was within reach of those places, two corps were sent to guard Warrenton, Warrenton Junction, and White Plains. The service the cavalry have had to perform has been trying on horses, and the rocky character of the roads very destructive of shoes. Four corps are to-night in this vicinity; the remaining three will be in position to-morrow. My cavalry are on the Rappahannock. One division is at Amissville, beyond the Rappahannock, annoying the rear of the enemy; another at Orleans, covering the movements of the infantry. No positive intelligence has been received of the movements of the enemy.
