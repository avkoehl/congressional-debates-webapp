SOUTHWARD HOFFMAN,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS CAVALRY CORPS,August 29, [1863]-3. 30 p. m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: The regiment sent to Chester Gap reports no signs of the enemy.

General Buford reports one of his scouts states that the rebels know of the order for a regiment of cavalry to escort sutlers on Thursday to Washington and back. Says also that 1,500 cavalry under Imboden have been at Leesburg over one week.

Would it not be well for Buford to send one of his brigades up to Leesburg and give those fellows a good clearing out? They can do it in four or five days.

Very respectfully,

A. PLEASONTON,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS CAVALRY CORPS, August 29, 1863.

Colonel JOHN I. GREGG,Commanding Second Cav. Div., Opposite Sulphur Springs:

The major-general commanding directs that you keep the enemy from concentrating any force at Gaines' Cross-Roads. If the force you have sent out is not strong enough, you had better send a stronger force with two pieces of artillery; that is, if you find them very strong there, as it is important to hold the cross-roads. If your own brigade is not strong enough, you had better order up some of McIntosh's brigade. Watch the enemy's movements as closely as possible.
