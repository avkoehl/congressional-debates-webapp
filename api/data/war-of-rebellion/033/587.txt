Weston, and Platte City, and Farley-men who will ascertain the facts correctly. Answer by telegraph what you can ascertain this afternoon, and send reports brought from over the river by telegraph or special messenger as soon as possible. It is of great concern for me to know the exact truth quickly.

Brigadier-General.

KANSAS CITY, MO., October 1, 1863.

Major-General SCHOFIELD:

Captain Joy telegraphs from Leavenworth, saying:

It is true that Union men have been driven out of Platte County by Moss' men, and dare not go back. Captain Fitzgerald's company has been disbanded, and their arms given to returned rebels. The true Union men have left, or were leaving, so there are none at Platte City or Farley to send to. Evidence is being taken here all the time, which I will send each day.

L. D. JOY.

I think Captain Joy has got an exaggerated statement, but suspect there is considerable foundation for the complaints. I will have to-morrow reliable information from all the points mentioned in last dispatch.

THOMAS EWING, Jr.,

Brigadier-General.

KANSAS CITY, MO., October 1, 1863.

Major-General SCHOFIELD:

Colonel Moss has in his regiment a large proportion of present or quondam rebels, including some once in rebel army. Some of the Union League at Farley hung two rebels, or rebel sympathizers. A few days ago anonymous letters were served on four or five of the Union League to quit the county next night, which means were attributed to Colonel Moss, his officers, or men. They left for Leavenworth, one of them alleging that he was pursued by the militia, causing considerable excitement in Leavenworth. A meeting was held last night, addressed by Price, Burnes, and Clough, at which the circumstances were detailed and colored highly. I telegraphed statement to General Guitar. I have ordered Captain Joy to prevent armed rebels crossing from Leavenworth, and have since ordered him to send intelligent men to Weston, Platte City, and Farley to ascertain the true state of things. I have sent (6 p.m.) parties to Parkville and Liberty. Before noon to-morrow I can telegraph you an accurate and reliable statement.

MACON, MO., October 1, 1863.

Major-General SCHOFIELD:

I have advices from Saint Joseph up to last night, and no word in relation to the report mentioned in your dispatch. I have no hesitation in pronouncing the whole thing an infamous falsehood, gotten up to aid the radical delegation at Washington in their revolutionary scheme.

O. GUITAR,

Brigadier-General.
