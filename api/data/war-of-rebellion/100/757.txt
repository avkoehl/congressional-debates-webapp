Colonel T. B. ROY,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

I inclose herewiththe plan proposed by General Kennedy for the consolidation of his brigade, which I think is the best that can be adopted under the circumstances. It is proposed to consolidate as follows: Second Regiments, 184, Lieutenant Colonel William Wallace, of Second Regiment, for colonel; Twentieth Regiment, 263, Major J. M. Partlow, of Twentieth Regiment, for lieutenant-colonel; total 447; Captain J. D. Graham, of Second Regiment, for major. Third Regiment, 247, Lieutenant Colonel F. S. Lewis, of Fifteenth Regiment, for colonel; Fifteenth Regiment, 182, Major R. P. Todd, of Third Regiment, for lieutenant-colonel; total, 429; Captain J. K. G. Nance, of Third Regiment, for major. Seventh Regiment, 234, Lieutenant Colonel E. T. Stackhouse, of Eighth Regiment, for colone; Eighth Regiment, 62, Captain T. A. Hudgens, of Seventh Regiment, for lieutenant-colonel; battalion, 137; total, 433; Captain J. Harris, of James' battalion, for major. There are nearly 2,500 officers and men absent from the brigade, from which deduct 1,200 for those who may not be exchanged or who may be disabled, and we have a balance of about 1,300 as a basis to draw from to fill up the three regiments to 640 men
