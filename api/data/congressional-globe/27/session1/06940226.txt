them as the great marts of trade and commerce
receiviag from the country and returning to the
country mutual benefit and advantage. The places
where the fortifications already erected ar  situated,
and where others are to be located, are positions
selected by competent engineers, with the vi<°w of
enabling the works erected on them to defend the
entrances to the highways, by land and water, by
which an invading enemy would enter our coun-
try with his fleets and ai mies or to compel such
an enemy to land his troops in situations most dis
advantageous to them for advance or retreat, and
where they could be met and repulsed under cir
cumstances most favorable to the forces which
should oppose them.
The necessity which requires the existence of
fortifications in particular positions is by no means
fortunate to the inhabitants of such places. They
must sustain the first shock of war—they must be
the first to meet and repel invasion—thev must
suffer all the inconvenience of besieging fleets and
armies—the destruction of trade, the derangement
of business, the ravages and depredations of hostile
and licentious soldiery. But while the war >s
raging here, all is qliet and peace m the interior
If judiciously located, properly constiuct«d, and
well defended, the fortifications prevent an enemy
from entering the country, Us mhabilants pursue
their various occupations, enjoy the social inter-
course and interchange the courtesies of life, as if
no hostile banner floated over besieging enemie ,
and no friendly trumpet summoned the chivalry of
the invaded districts to the battlements erected f< r
their defence. For the want of such fortifications
Havre de Grace and Buffalo were burned during
the laU war For the want of such fortifications
the public buildings of this city, and tin Halls of
legislation, which covered the spot h here stands
the splendid edifice in which we are row delibe-
rating, were destroyed, and the inhabitants of this
District weie doomed to witness the flune of tneir
lofty domes flickering in the heavens, an evidente
of the want of prudence in their rulers, and of ihe
vandal spirit of their invaders For the want i i
such iortifications, the enemy took and held pos
session of the city of New York during the whole
of the Revolutionary war, and Riso ascended the
Hudson and burnt Kingston All civilized nations
resort to fortifications as a means <M d fence, and,
notwithstanding they are sometimes taptured, no
enlightened Government would for that reason
abandon the use ot them.
In the report of the board of officers to which I
have alluded, numerous instances are detailed of
the successful defence of fortifications 3ga nst ihe
attack of vessels of war, armed si <uner«-, and
floating batteries 01 vastly superior force m ihe
number and power of their armament I will
mention some of the most remarkable
In 1794 a small round tower in the biy of Ma -
tellom Corsica, with only one heavy gun, beat
off two British ships of war without sustaining
much injury.
In 1836 the town ef Fuenterabia was success
fully defended by three guns, mounted on an old
wall, against a squadron of six arme 1 steamers,
two British, and several Spanish gunboat
But why search 'he history of Europe for in
stances of ihe successful defence of foitifieatioi s,
when our own furnishes so many ej ampien Who
has not heard of the gallant defence of Fort
Mtultrie, mounting about thtrly prrcs ot hew,
artillery, against the attack of aButf-h fleet, con
sistoig ol two ships of war of fifty guns, four 0f
* venty eight guns, two of twenty guns <nd a bomb
keteb, under the command ot Sir Pi lei Pariter?
Who has not heard <f the brave deftrceof Sio
ntngton by citizen soldier^, wbo, with a batter,
only three feet high, rrounting only tvotightitn
founders, beat off a «loop of wat1
Tbe successful deferce of Fort RI. Henry by
Colonel Armistead and the biave mna under bis
command, consisting of regular tro p ¡aid volm -
teer militia, against thirty British ships of war, con-
sisting of  hips of the line, large fn aif , and bomb
vessels, by which Baltimore was «avt c! r< m an at-
tack by this fleet, is among the n c st brilliant
achievements of the late war. I will lefer to an-
other bright page ¡a the history of cur country.
The defence of the Fort at Lowei Sandusky by
"Colonel Croghan, who, with a small number of
men, armed with muskets, and ono six pounder,
successfully defended the fort with the loss oí only
one man killed, and seven wounded, against a s -
multaneous attack by gun-boats, and a land force
consisting of five hundred Butish troops and from
seven to eight hundred Indians, aided by five six
pounders and a howitzer, who lost in the attack, in
kuled, wounded, and prisoners, upwards of one hun-
dred and fifty men But why multiply í samples when
the universal practice of civilized na'ions attest their
opinion of the utility ot fortifications for national
defence1? During the long and bloody wars be-
tween France and England, growing out of the first
revolution in France, what prevented the fleets c f
Bntam.with her immensenaval supenoi ity and;prox-
innty of situation, from entering the naval depots
and commercial ports of France, bui fortifications,
judiciously placed, and suitably provided with the
means of defence? Admonished by the past, the
Government of France is now placing Pans in a
state of deience, by the erection of fortifications at
a vast expense, prudently preparing, in time of
peace, for the emergencies of war.
It i-, alleged by the opponents of this bill, that
the availing enemy would have an increased pow-
er of attack and annoyance by means of armed
war steamers, and that such steamers could pass
by our batteries into our harbors unperceived, or,
if discovered, without much opposition or injury,
and wish the committee to infer that the erection
of fortifica'ions is a useless expenditure of the pub-
lic money. I do not draw the same conclusion
from the same premises. The increased power
which the enemy derives from armed steamers,
furni hes an argument why our defences should be
propcrtionablv increased, and their means of at-
tack and resistance augmented to enable them to
cope with this new combination of power Would
not the Sbntnes w ilk iheir rounds? Would not te-
legraph signals and evety other device, be made
usp ot which thp ingenuity of man and military ex-
perience have discovered, to prevent surprise and
alarm ihe garrison on the approach of an enemy?
Is it not fair to presume that the officers who
shill be entrusted with the command of fortifica-
tions guarding the entrance to our seaport , will ex-
ercise their best judgment and skill in availing
themselves of all the means within their control to
prevent the passage of hostile «hip* of war and
armed steamer*' Could not chains, rafts, vesseh,
and floating batteries beso placed, that whil  they
should obstruct the passage of such vessels, friend-
ly ships would be allowed to enter' Is it not pro-
bable that before an enemy could remove these
obstructions, be might suffer so muc^ annoyance
fiom toe fire of red hot shot from the batteries as
to deem it prudent to retire? It has been observed
that fortifications are u eles , inasmuch as an ene-
my may land «u a di tance, and march upon our
cities in the rear This is a mistake. Ttie prin-
cipal object of fortifications is to prevent the ap
proagh of the vessels of an enemy in a particular
direction, the landing of an armed force at parti-
cular points, anl to give the garrison the advantage
of delt-ns ve works, i( assailed bv lanl or water. I
will lake an examp'e Fort SchnylT, for which
an appropriation is proposed in thi oill, is built on
Throg's point, which projects irern the mam land
into the sound opposite Long Island, forming
a nairnw strait, through whieh ships of war
must pass under the guns of the fort in fo
ng to the oit/ of New Yck by Long
island sound ftom the east Without this
fortification, an enemy could land in the rear of the
citv below the strong defensive position afforded
by Haerl m rivet, and thus fiod no natural or ar i-
fi al obstacle oniosf d to his pro«re s and the si'y
must bo defended b/ the un overed breasts and
living valor of her citizen  But this fort will com-
pel an eneny's forces to land at somf distance to
the east of it, and more than twent" miles from
New Yoik, and in marching to the city, ihey
would have to pass Haerlem river, and a line of
entrenchments bristling with cannon, manned by
citizens fighting for their altars and firesides, for
wives, children, libeity, and life. In such a crisis,
when old and young would rush to the "battle
field," it is no exaggeration to say that with the mi-
litia from Long Island, New Jersey, and the neigh-
boring counues, conveyed by numerous steam-
boat , always at command, a force could be col-
lected of one hundred thousand brave and deter-
mined men, animated with the same enthusiasm
in defence of their country, which lighted their
sires to victory in the war of the Revolution. In
what situation would a besieging army and its
commander be placed, with a broad river on each
side of them, filled with armed steamers, vessels of
war, and every means of annoyance that could be
obtained? Haerlem river and a line of armed en-
trenchments, well manned in front, and the entire
body of the militia of the country collecting m their
rear by railroads, steamboats, and every available
means of conveyance? I believe that they would
b* in the same situation as General Burgoyne
found himself and army at Saratoga, unless they
saved themselves by a rapid flight and escape to
their ships
If this view of the subject is corree', it must be
evident that no number of ships of war, armed
steamer , or «team batteries, could answer the
same purposes as Fort Schuyler. It is more pro-
bable that an enemy, instead of landing hts forces
and marching directly on the city, leaving the fort
in their rear, would first attack the fortification by
land and water, and prudence requires that the
works should be prepared for such an emergency.
An objection has been made to this bul because
one of the fortifications for whieh an appropna-
t on is required, covers sixty three acres. If a
board of competent officers has determined that the
works require that number of acres, they should
just cover so much land, no more, or less The
fortifications should be adequate, both in extent
and force, for the purposes for which they are
erected, or they become useless, and the money ex-
pended in their erection is wasted. In such mat-
ters, the opinion of officers and engineers, whose
studies, habí s of life, and experience, qualify them
to judge accurately, are more to be relied upon
than the vague speculations of inexperienced citi-
zens, however splendid their talents and extensive
their information on other subjects
Before I reply to the objection urged by some,
that if the forlificati ns are completed, it will re-
quire seventy thousand ment o man them, I will
respec'fully request an answer to this simple ques-
tion If it will require seventy thousand men to de-
fend the country with fortification-, how many
men would it require without them? The opposition
made to this lull because there is an unexpended
balance of the appropriations of 1840, applicable
to the repair of fortifications, should not influence
the committee, unless it can besho^n that the aggre-
gate amount of this unexpended balance, and the
appropriations made by Ibis bill, are more than
sufficient for the purposes to which they are to be
applied. If it can be shown that the estimates of
the engineers are incorrect, that a less sum than
what is required would accomplish all that is in-
tended to be effected by the appropriations, then
there would be a fair inference and argument
against the excese; but this is not even pretended
The object on then resolves itself into a mere ques
tion of time; (hat is to say, whether the appropria
tions shall be made at this session or next, and as
to that question, there is this answer, which I hope
wi'l be decisive with the cornmitt-e If the appro-
priations are not now made, the works will bp
shortly suspended for the want of funds to carry
them on If th> appropriations are made, the for-
tifications; will be put in a serviceable State, and
the couniry placed in a state of deVnce Can the
Representatives of the people hesitate wnat deci-
sion to make'
But it is contended by some that these appropn-
atioi should be withheld because it is desirable
that the navy should be increased, and a home
squadron established. When suitable measures
are proposed, haying these objects in vi<"w, I will
give ihem my cheerful support. I trust I never
shall be wanting in yielding a proper support to
that gallant navy, winch is the pride and the boast
of our country, which experience has shown to be
so useful and so essential an arm of our defence;
which has extended the fame of our Republic to
