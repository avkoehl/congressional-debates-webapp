Major-General THOMAS:

Please see my telegram of this date to Lieutenant-Commander Fitch. Will give you convoy down to convoy transports as soon as you wish. Lieutenant Naile heard from or at Cumberland City that General Lyon had two guns at Paducah and Fort Donelson. General Lyon reported to have from five to nine guns. Naile heard along the river that Lyon had gone to hopkinsville. Two or three transports declined convoy from Smithland. The brigade of cavalry had not arrived there. I will have three good tin-clads to convoy it up as soon as those here return.

S. P. LEE,

Rear-Admiral, Commanding Mississippi Squadron.

CLARKSVILLE, December 13, 1864-4.30 p. m.

Lieutenant Commander LE ROY FITCH:

Your telegram of 11th instant is just received. Lieutenant Naile, with two gun-boats, convoying two naval transports loaded with 100 rounds of ammunition for your vessels and towing two coal barges, was to have left Smithland last Sunday morning for this place. I have no intelligence of him since he left Mound City Saturday morning. The Peosta returned to Paducah Sunday morning with two large barges and two boats, in which Forrest crossed the Tennessee River, near Welch Bridge, on the evening of the 8th instant.

S. P. LEE,

Acting Rear-Admiral, Mississippi Squadron.

CLARKSVILLE, December 13, 1864-8.30 p. m.

Lieutenant Commander LE ROY FITCH:

Your two telegram of 8th instant, sent to Mound City, just received by gun-boats. Nos. 19, 33, and 15, which bring two coal barges and a full regulation supply of ammunition for you. The Benefit left Smithland 1 a. m. Sunday for Louisville with the ammunition you desired. What sort of works and guns did you engage on the 8th? Where at, and with what effect? The endurance of the Neosho is gratifying. Lieutenant Naile was delayed by searching for rebel ammunition opposite Cumberland City, where he captured nine boxes of carbine cartridges and one caisson. I will give army transports convoy from here as soon as desired.

S. P. LEE,

Acting Rear-Admiral, Mississippi Squadron.
