command believed the reports of excited and affrighted citizens instead of relying on information which he should have had from his own scouts and patrols. I expect reliable information during the day.

B. F. KELLEY,

Brigadier-General.

CUMBERLAND, May 30, 1864-10 a.m.

Major T. A. MEYSENBURG,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Martinsburg:

Your telegram of this a.m. just received. I had already anticipated your order in regard to the protection of the road. I had ordered Colonel Harris to send a strong scout to Soldier White's, on the Dry Fork of the Cheat River, which is the key to the Cheat River Valley. The scout I ordered from Beverly into Webster and Braxton returned to-day. It has been entirely successful. I understand that among the prisoners in the notorious Major Triplett. I send you a copy of telegram* just received from Colonel Harris.

B. F. KELLEY,

Brigadier-General.

CUMBERLAND, May 30, 1864-1 p.m.

Major T. A. MEYSENBURG,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Martinsburg:

Information just received from the front confirms my convictions of yesterday, that there is no enemy in force at or near Petersburg. The officer in command at Greenland Gap relied upon statements of excited and scared citizens instead of his own scouts and patrols. For this I have reprimanded him. I am now satisfied that there is no force in the South Branch Valley but McNeill's and Harness' commands. I am drilling and disciplining the new regiments Ohio National Guard. They are composed of good material and are improving rapidly.

B. F. KELLEY,

Brigadier-General.

CUMBERLAND, May 30, 1864-1 p.m.

Major T. A. MEYSENBURG,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Martinsburg:

The regiment of Ohio National Guard will proceed to Martinsburg from New Creek, as heretofore ordered.

B. F. KELLEY,

Brigadier-General.

CUMBERLAND, May 30, 1864-1 p.m.

Colonel WILKINSON,

New Creek:

Make an investigation and report to me why such reports were made from Greenland Gap without foundation. Such conduct is exceedingly reprehensible.

B. F. KELLEY,

Brigadier-General.
