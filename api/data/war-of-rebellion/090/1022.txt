encamped between there and Leesburg. The enemy came up shortly after we crossed. Part of the cavalry crossed lower down (see plate ---*). McCausland crossed at Conrad's Ferry and went to Edwards Ferry and had a fight (see plate ---*). The 15th was spent in camp, the enemy making demonstrations along the river and shelling our cavalry. The trains and prisoners were sent to Ashby's Gap, via Upperville, McCausland covering them. July 16, we marched, via Leesburg and Purcellville, through Snicker's Gapa, Jackson's cavalry in advance, crossed the Shenandoah, as did also Gordon's and Wharten's divisions. The others encamped on the east and west slopes of the mountain. McCausland followed the trains to Ashby's Gap and Johnson marched to protect the right flank from the enemy at Hillsborough, but he failed to do it, and they made an attack on our train at Purcellville and did some damage, but they were soon repulsed and we captured a piece of artillery from them (see plate ---*). McCausland marched to Millwood.

July 17, we crossed the Shenandoah at Castleman's Ferry and Gordon and Wharton encamped near the crossing; Rodes farther down the river and Ramseur near Long Branch. Imboden went to Millwood; McCausland to Salem Church; Jackson toward Charlestown, and Johnson farter to the left (see plate ---*). Our cavalry fought the enemy's advance in Snicker's Gap. July 18, the enemy came across the mountain at Snicker's Gap and attacked our lines furiously, getting commanding positions for their artillery on the bluffs of the east bank of the Shenandoah. They crossed the river at Cool Springs, where they were met by Rodes, aided by Wharton, and signally repulsed and driven with loss across the river, Gordon engaging them at the same time near Castleman's Ferry (see plate ---*). Their loss was heavy. Our cavalry fought them as they advanced across the mountain. The fight took place in the p. m. July 19, the enemy attempted to cross at Berry's Ferry, from Ashby's Gap, but was signally repulsed by Imboden's and McCausland's brigades of cavalry (see plate ---*). On the 20th Ramseur's division and Vaughn's and Jackson's cavalry, which had been sent to Winchester last night, to-day went three miles toward Martinsburg, and was attacked by the enemy at Rutherford's farm and defeated, losing 4 pieces of artillery, Jackson saving them from rout by charging to the front and covering the retreat (see plate ---+). The trains were started toward Newtown, and during the night Breckinridge (Gordon and Wharton), followed by McCausland, marched to Cedarville via Milwood, and on the 20th to Middletown. Rodes marched through White Post and on to Newtown, while Ramseur, having covered the evacuation of Winchester, came to Kernstown (see plate ---*).

On the 21st we moved to Cedar Creek, the enemy slowly following with a large force, and on the 22nd marched to the vicinity of Strasburg, Ramseur north, Rodes northwest, and Breckinridge northeast, on Hupp's Hill (see plate ---*), and McCausland encamped in the vicinity of Front Royal. July 23, the enemy's cavalry advanced to near Newtown, but was met by ours and driven back to Kernstown. The infantry remained in camp. McCausland's brigade moved to Buckton (see plate ---*).
