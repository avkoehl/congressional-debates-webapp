HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,October 8, 1864.

General GRIFFIN:

GENERAL: Will you please send me any information you may have in regard to the position of the enemy. General Ayres is directed to advance and take the W. Davis house. Has the Ninth Corps moved with your division, or have you had any trouble in regard to your left? I desire that you will select some good line and re-establish the picket-line to-night. We have driven the enemy's skirmishers into their works on the right. The picket-line must be in advance of where it was last night. All I desire is that the enemy should see your force. When that is accomplished, or the enemy's skirmish line drawn in, the object of the reconnaissance is accomplished and you are at liberty to withdraw your command in connection with your right and left. Please inform me of the situation.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. W. CRAWFORD,

Brigadier-General.
