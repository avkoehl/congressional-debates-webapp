festing hostile intentions. It is alleged that some
of their tribe were found in arms with the Sioux,
but no evidence has been discovered calculated
to implicate the tribe. The most of them have
remained quietly on their reservation during the
war.
The condition of affairs produced by these In-
dian hostilities demands of Congress prompt le-
gislation. Thepeople of Minnesotahavesuffered
irreparable injuries. Large settlements have been
depopulated, and numerous families have been de-
stroyed. The loss of life is beyond the power of
Congress to compensate. The destruction of prop-
erty has been very great, and the sufferers are en-
titled to indemnity, at least to the extent of the
property heldhy the Government in trust for the
tribe. No examination has yet been made from
which the extent of the pecuniary loss can be as-
certained. The mode and measure of indemnity
must be determined by Congress.
But the people of Minnesotaask not only in-
demnity for the destruction of their property, but
they insist upon guarantees of future protection.
This, they think, can be obtained only by the
removal of the Indians to some point so remote
from the settlements as to preclude the possibility
of another attack. No promises of forbearance
and future good conducton the part of the Indians
can allay their fears. It is apparent that whil$,
they remain in the vicinity of the settlements they
have desolated those settlements cannot be re-
peopled. The treachery and cruelty of the recent
attack upon a confiding and unsuspecting people,
involving helpless women and children in indis-
criminate slaughter, forbid the indulgence of con-
fidence in the future.
It may well be questioned whether the Govern-
ment has not adopted a mistaken policy in re-
garding the Indian tribes as quasi independent
nations, and making treaties with them for the
purchase of the lands they claim to own. They
have none of the elements of nationality; they
are within the limits of the recognized authority
of the United States, and must be subject to its
control. The rapid progress of civilization upon
this continent will riot permit the lands which are
required for cultivation to be surrendered to sav-
age tribes for hunting grounds. Indeed, whatever
may be the theory, the Government has always
demanded the removal of the Indians when their
lands were required for agricultural purposes by
advancing settlements. Although the consent of
the Indians has been obtained in the form of
treaties, it is well known that they have yielded
to a necessity which they could not resist.
The admission of their right to the lands and
of the necessity of their consent tu a cession has
given them a feeling of independence, and fos-
tered a desire for vengeance for every supposed
violation of their rights. They are exacting in
their demands for the fulfillment of treaty stipu-
lations, as they construe them, or as they are in-
terpreted by dishonest and designing persons,
who are interested in fomenting their discontents,
and they seek revenge upon the Government for
real or imaginary wrongs by the- slaughter of
women and children.
The duty of the Government to protect the In-
dians and prevent their suffering for the want of
the necessaries of life should be fully recognized.
They should be taught to earn their subsistence
by labor, and be instructed in the cultivation of
the soil. The Government should designate the
place where they shall reside, and afford them
protection in the lands which are assigned to
them for a home, and furnish them with such
aid as, with the fruits of their own labor, will af-
ford them an adequate support. They should be
taught to rely on the cultivation of the soil for a
subsistence, and that they can become independ-
ent only through their industry.
Kansas Indians.
The people of Kansas are very earnest in the
expression of their wishes for the transfer of the
Indian tribes within that State to the Indian
country on the south.
The presence of Indians in such great numbers,
occupying a large portion of the best lands of the
State,"retards the progress of the State in popula-
tion and improvement. The close proximity of
the Indians to the white settlements affords facil-
ities for illegal intercourse and traffic which it is
found impossible to prevent entirely. As a con-
sequence, the Indians are encouraged in habits of â€¢
idleness and dissipation, and are despoiled of then-
money and property. Their removal would un-
doubtedly result in advantage to both races.
It is not proposed to compel them to remove
against their wishes. A large portion of them
have expressed a desire to be removed to the In-
dian country south, and it is believed that the sev-
eral tribes will readily enter into treaties for the
removal of those who desire to be transferred.
Portions of the different tribes have made such
progress in civilization that they can now culti-
vate their lands and earn their subsistence. These
would remain and become citizens of the State
and subject to its laws.
While the people of Kansas and the Indians
would be benefited by this change, it would result
in benefit to the Government, by diminishing the
expenses now annually incurred. Instead of em-
ploying one agent for each of the tribes, one com-
petent agent could supervise the business of all of
them. That portion of the lands now held by
the Indians in Kansas, which may be rightfully
claimed by those who will be willing to remove,
may be sold for a larger sum than will be required
to purchase all the lands they will need in the
Indian country.
California Indians.
A provision in one of the appropriation bills of
the last session of Congress directed an inquiry
into the expediency of reducing the Indian res-
ervations in that State to two, to designate the
proper places for them, and the probable cost and
the value of the present reservations; also in what
manner the expenses of the Indian department in
that State can oe diminished.
The time which has elapsed since the adjourn-
ment of Congress has been too brief to enable the
Department to obtain the information required;
and I can only present at this time some general
suggestions.
There are now two superintendents in Califor-
nia, one having charge of the Indians in the north-
ern and the other of those in the southern part of
the State. Both keep their offices at San Fran-
cisco. 1 am unable to perceive any advantage from
this system of double superintendencies in a sin-
gle State. By placing the supervision of all the
Indians in the State in the control of one superin-
tendent, the salary of one of them, with the ex-
pense of clerks and other employes, office rent,
&c., may be saved, while a uniform system of
management, under one controlling head, would
be calculated to lessen the expenses of the general
administration throughout the State.
No treaties have been made with any of the
tribes in California. The Government has as-
signed to them reservations, and made appropri-
ations to aid in their support. It is expedient, in
my judgment, to continue this policy.
The superintendent of the northern district
reports to the Commissioner that there js no one
available location in that district of sufficient ex-
tent to afford a home to all the. Indians. He rec-
ommends the sale of the present reservations and
the purchase of two others. No report has been
received from the superintendent of the southern
district in relation to the subjects referred to in
the act of Congress. I do not entertain a doubt
that a system for the government and support of
the Indians in California may be adopted which
will diminish the present expenses, while the In-
dians will be greatly benefited. The length of
time required for the transmission of the mails
has made it impossible to obtain such information
as is necessary to present the necessary details at
the present time.
The object can, in my judgment, be best accom-
plished by the appointment of a board of commis-
sioners, to consist of three persons, who shall
make a personal examination of the country, and
select suitable locations for the residence of the
Indians, and have authority to purchase such
claims or individual rights as may interfere with
their occupation.
Considerable difficulty has been created in Col-
orado and Washington with the tribes in those
Territories by the great increase of immigration,
attracted by newly discovered gold mines. The
Indians claim that the land belongs to them, while
the miners, in search of new veins, are disposed
to pay but little respect to their claims. A suffi-
cient extent of country should be assigned totiwi
Indians, and they should be protected in its enjoy-
ment. . - -
I am fully convinced that many serious difficul-
ties grow out of the practice of permitting traders -
to sell goods and other property to thelndians on
credit. The profits which arc made by the traders
might be saved for the Indians. It seems to me
expedient for Congress to provide by law for the
purchase of such goods, agricultural implements,
stock, and other articles as the Indians need, to
be paid for from the sums provided by treaties to
be paid to the Indians. These should be placed
in charge of a storekeeper, under the control of
the agent,and should be delivered to the Indians
as their necessities may require, charging them
only their cost and transportation. All contracts
with them should be prohibited, and all promises
or obligations made by them should be declared
void. A radical change in the mode of treatment
of the Indians should, in my judgment, be adopted.
Instead of being treated as independent nations,
they should be regarded as wards of the Govern-
ment, entitled to its fostering care and protection.
Suitable districts of the coun try should be assigned
to them for their homes, and the Government
should supply them, through its own agents, with
such articles as they use, until they can be in-
structed to earn their subsistence by their labor.
PATENT OFFICE.
The business of this bureau has exhibited in-
creased activity the past year. During the year
from October 1,1861, to September 30,1862, there
were received 5,302 applications for patents, of
which 3,522 were granted. In the same time Sll
caveats were filed, and 29 applications for exten-
sions were received, of which 18 were granted.
Seven hundicd patents remain in the office await-
ing the payment of the fee which is due on deliv-
ery. The law specifies no time within which
patents must be taken from the office. This causes
alarge accumulation for an indefinite period. The
law should be amended in such manner as to .re-
quire the applicants to take the patents and pay
the fees within a specified time; or, upon failure
to do so, to forfeit their right to the patent, as well
as the fees paid.
The balance in the Treasury to the credit of the
patent fund on the 1st of October, 1861, was
$16,750 27. From that date until October 1,1862,
there were received in payment of patent fees
$163,40534;appropriated by Congress,$50,85549.
During the same period there was .expended
$182,853 89, leaving to the credit of the patent
fund on the 1st of October, 1862, $48,157 21.
The large model rooms of the Patent Office
have been for some time past occupied as a hos-
pital for sick and wounded soldiers. They are
admirably adapted to the purpose, being very
commodious and well ventilated. They contain
at this time over eight hundred patients. The use
of these rooms for hospital purposes has been the
cause of much inconvenience to the Patent Office,
and to every other bureau in the Department.
This inconvenience has, however, been cheerfully
submitted to, in view of the benefits conferred
upon the suffering soldiers.
The Commissioner has asked for an appropri-
ation for putting up model cases in the north wing,
and for additional improvements in the large hall
in the south wing. These improvements are de-
manded by the increasing business of the office,
and the application of the Commissioner is com-
mended to the favorable consideration of Con-
gress.
A balance of Â§5,720 04 has been found due to
Henry y. Davis for the erection of model cases in
the west wing.
The balance of appropriation made for that ob-
ject, and which was sufficient to meet this de-
mand, was carried to the surplus fund, and can- ,
not, therefore, be now applied. An appropriation
to meet the claim, which is justly due, is respect-
fully recommended.
PENSIONS.
The report of the Commissioner of Pensions
presents in detail the operations of the Pension
bureau during the past year.
