oppression you are pleased, directly or by insinuation, to attribute to my branch of the War Department. I do not think there is any sufficient cause for your presenting a branch of the War Department to your people as an unfair and unjust institution against which you were, with doubtful prospects of success, using all your arguments to "protect them." That such is the effect of your letter I think must be admitted.

Law and justice require that each and every section of country should furnish its proportional amount of military service. If your arguments and the case upon which they were presented are carefully and disinterestedly studied, I think it will be found that they are calculated, if not intended, to relieve your district from its fair share of military service instead of protecting it against injustice and unfairness on the part of the War Department, and this in connection with the last sentence of your letter, "I shall do all I can for you," will, I fear, be construed by the ungenerous as indicating a subordination of great interests to local influences. Must not the great cause and the Government suffer by being presented to the people by a professed friend, in the manner you have presented them in this letter to your constituents?

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JAS. B. FRY,

Provost-Marshal-General.

WAR DEPT., PROVOST-MARSHAL-GENERAL'S OFFICE,

Washington, D. C., July 18, 1864.

Governor BROUGH,

Columbus, Ohio:

Your dispatch of 14th of Secretary of War about suspending draft is received. It has already been answered by my dispatch to Colonel Potter, dated July 16, which please see.

WAR DEPT., PROVOST-MARSHAL-GENERAL'S OFFICE,

Washington, D. C., July 18, 1864.

Governor BROUGH,

Columbus, Ohio:

Dispatch of 14th to Secretary of War received. New call for 500,000 troops in made to-day. If you feel satisfied you can complete a regiment of representative recruits promptly it may be undertaken. Present this to Colonel Potter as an order to have provost-marshals concentrate these recruits at points suitable for organization.

JAMES B. FRY,

Provost-Marshal-General.

COLUMBUS, OHIO, July 18, 1864.

General JAMES B. FRY,

Provost-Marshal-General:

Recruiting in rebel States must be done by sub-districts. Can I allow one agent to each Congressional district in the State requiring parties to agree upon their agent and ask no more? Answer prompt. I am pressed on the subject.

JOHN BROUGH.
