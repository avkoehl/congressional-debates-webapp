About seventy men of Jackson's command in upper part of this county, supposed to be making for Webster. Report to-day at 12 o'clock that between 300 and 400 rebels were en route for this place and Weston; if this is correct will advise you.

(Received 12 m.)

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Chief of Staff:

I leave for Baltimore in a few minutes. Hold all new regiments coming into service in Washington until further orders. It is possible, through not probable, that Sheridan may want to throw a force suddenly into Hagerstown.

Lieutenant-General.

WASHINGTON, D. C., September 17, 1864 - 1.30 p. m.

Lieutenant-General Grant, Baltimore:

Dispatch from Harper's Ferry received. Orders were given some days ago to send all infantry regiments and recruits in the Northern States from Boston, New York, Philadelphia, and Baltimore to City Point by water, on account of the numerous desertions. Do you mean that these orders be suspended and the new regiments brought here, or simply to retain what are now here and on their way here?

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
