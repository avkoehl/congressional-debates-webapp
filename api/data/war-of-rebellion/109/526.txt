day. The general commanding desire that your order a reconnaissance toward Russellville to be made by a party of the cavalry referred to, starting to-morrow morning a little before day, so that we may be fully advised should any movement of the enemy take place to-night. General S[chofield] wishes that the troops may be upon the alert at daybreak and all proper precaution taken against surprise from any direction by parties large or small. Please give orders to the cavalry to report through you as heretofore.

MORRISTOWN, February 29, 1864.

Brigadier General E. E. POTTER,

Chief of Staff, Department of Ohio:

GENERAL: The commanding general desires that reports be made daily of the number of wagons arriving at Strawberry Plains and loaded with stores for the command, as well as of the progress made with the bridge. As the divisions here have little or no extgra transportation the command is dependent upon the arrival of the expected wagons and teams from the rear, and no labor should be spared in the quartermaster's and subsistence departmeners to push everything forward. The enemy are reported still in force between Bull's Gap and Greeneville, but reports are conflicting, and it will require some hours to test their truth. We hope to know definitely by morning.

Acting Chief of Staff.
