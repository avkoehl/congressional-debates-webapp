is entitled to much credit for his conspicuous gallantry. The gallant adjutant-general, Captain E. P. Guillet, was already wounded. Major M. Hanly, assistant quartermaster, and Major W. V. Crouch, acting commissary of subsistence, throughout the campaign have discharged their duties with fidelity and promptness.

The brigade entered the action with 120 officers, and lost in killed and wounded 33; with 1,200 enlisted men, and lost in killed, wounded, and missing 396. It drove the enemy from two batteries, which fell within our lines, only six guns of which, however, upon investigation beyond all doubt, were positively taken by officers of the command. About 600 prisoners were likewise captured during the battle. It only ceased the pursuit of the enemy at night and under orders. One hour more of daylight had added largely to our captures.

I have the honor to remain, yours, very respectfully,

RANDALL LEE GIBSON,

Colonel, Commanding.

Assistant Adjutant-General, Breckinridge's Division.
