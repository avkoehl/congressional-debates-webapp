SPEEOII OP HON. O. CLEVELAND,
Of NEW JUltSliY,
In the House op Rewieshn'tativios,
July 15, 1870,
On tho report of the committee of conference on the
bill (II. R. Xo. 2015) to rt'duco internal taxes, and
for other purposes.
Mr. CLEVELAND. Mr. Speaker, on this
last day of this protracted session, when at the
hour wo have been accustomed to meet for the
transaction of the public business a joint res-
olution declares we shall separate and leave
this Capitol, I find in the Congressional Globe
what purports to be a speech of Hon. Dasiel
1 J. Morubm,, of Pennsylvania. It appears that
] two days previously, when the House had
1 under consideration the report of a conference
) committee on the disagreeing votes of the two
; Houses on the tax and tariff bill, Mr. Morkeix
i asked and obtained leave to print some remarks
on that bill, and we have in to day's Globe
j those " remarks."
i I have before heard of ready-made speeches
I being carried about, but this is the first in-
j stance in which I have met with the actual fact,
i This pretended speech has not one word in it
in regard to the particular bill or tho confer-
once report upon which it professes to have
been made; but it bears ample evidence of
having been long in preparation, and is wholly
devoted to the minority report of the Committee
on Manufactures and to Hon. David A. Wells,
late Special Commissioner of the Revenue.
That minority report was presented in May last,
and Mr. Morhell's speech has therefore been
two months in pieparation, but it was printed
in the Globe on the very last day of the ses-
sion, in order that there might be no oppor-
tunity given me to reply to it. But the scheme
has failed, as did his first scheme of springing
upon the House, after a four months' prep-
