HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF WEST MISSISSIPPI,New Orleans, La., August 22, 1864.

Major General J. J. REYNOLDS,

Commanding Nineteenth Army Corps, New Orleans, La.:

GENERAL: The Twenty-third Wisconsin and One hundred and sixty-first New York have just reported, and I have given them orders to proceed by the Cahawba to Mobile Point. It seems that these regiments have taken all their sick with them, some of them in such a condition that it may not be advisable to take them beyond this place, and I would respectfully suggest that a medical officer be sent to the Cahawba to inspect those sick and have such as are too feeble to travel transferred to a hospital in this city. The commanding officer also reports that they are entirely out of forage, and asks that twenty-four hours' rations for twelve horses may be sent to the Cahawba. I have instructed the commanding officer to delay his departure as little as possible after these wants have been attended to.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

C. T. CHRISTENSEN,

Major and Assistant Adjutant-General.
