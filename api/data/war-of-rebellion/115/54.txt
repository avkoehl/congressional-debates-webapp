FLAMEN BALL, Esq.,

U. S. Attorney for the District of Ohio, Cincinnati.

SIR: Inclosre a copy of a letter* to the President from J. H. Edwards who professes to be a member of the society calling itself "Knights of the Golden Circle," and offering to disclose its secrets to the Governmen. We have had disclosures from other similar persons which have hitherto proved of little or no value. You may, however, request this person to call on you, and if he has anything of importance to communicate you may pay him for it according to its value-not to exceed $ 100, and may draw on this Department for the amount at sight.

I am, sir, your obedient servant,

WILLIAM H. SEWARD.

Honorable SIMON CAMERON, Secretary of War.

SIR; To prevent a greater calamity I have taken it upon myself to interdict and entirely prohibit the sale and circulation of the New York Daily News in the city of New Haven, it being quite evident to me that our citizens as a body do not desire its circulation nor will they longer allow it.

Will you please telegraph me on receipt of this if my course is approved, as I wish to stop the circumstation of this detestable sheet throughout the whole of our State?

DAVID H. CARR,

U. S. Marshal.
