DUELING IN THE DISTRICT.
On motion of Mr PRENTISS, the Senate pio
ceeded to the consideiation of the bill to prohibit
the giving or accept ng, within the District of Co-
lumbia, of a challenge to fight a duel, and for the
punishment thereof
After some remarks fiom Mr PRENTISS, in
explanation of the ments and objects of the bill,
Mr CLAY, of Alabama, moved to ¡strike out
the fourth section, contending that it was uncon-
stitutional
Mr  SMITH, of Connecticut, said that he en-
tertained no diffeienee of opinion now fiom that
which he entertained at the last session on this
section of the bill    It wa? said then as now, that
this provision in the bill was designed to punish
an act perpetiated beyond the limits of the Dis
tnct     Is it so?  1 he object ot the bill is not only
to prevent dueling in the Distuct, but to pi  \uit i
its perpetiation  elsewhere, wIilii  it is pro] cted
and originates in the Distuct, and consummated
beyond its limits,, with a view of evading the law .
of Congiess, which can extend no furthoi  than '
the limits of the Distuct     The law, in his i n.«r,
would be wholly ineffectual, unlf ssthis pioMsion
of the bill should be letdined     The law i<s de   ,
signed to operate and bear upon the uiminal acts I
of the inhabitants of the Distuct     Is it, then, or
may it be made, ctiminal in  the people of the
District to conspne and combine togethei within
the Distuct to commit a crime beyond the limits
of it>    If it is, there can be no doubt that C m
gress has the power to mikt a law ti an est the
ptogiess of cume at any time after the fitst step j
is taken for the commission of it, and to punish
every act which tends to its peipetiation     If the
parties who intend to fight without the Distuct, '
have that undeistanding within  it, and   befoie
they leav e it, is not this understanding, then, how-
evei it may have been biought about, the mcip I
lent step to the final consummation of the cume
which is to be, and is, peifoimed or consummated
beyond the limns'   Most certainly it is     Sup-
pose two or more persons, within the Distuct, I
were to conspne together to commit muider, or
any other crime, beyond  the limits of the Dis  j
tnct, and  in puisuance of this conspiracy, the
muider was committed by a part only of the con-
spiiators, while the otheis remained within the
Distuct, taking no further pait in the act than to
consent to, and approve of, the cume thus per-
petiated   could they not be punished for this of-
fense against the laws of the District, or is no act
cumiml except that which finishes the crime'
Yes, sn, every step, every act, and eveiy motion
tending to the perpetration of the crime, is crim-
inal, and the offender liable to punishment foi it
wherevei these inchoate acts may have taken
place He was, therefoie, in favor of retaining
this provision in the bill, and, without it, he
should consider the bill worse than useless
Mr NORVELL was in favor of the motion to
strike out This was, he said, strictly a consti-
tutional question, and he could not suppose that
the authoiity of Lord Bacon, or any other old
English lawyer, who lived one or two hundied
yeais before the adoption of our Constitution,
ought to have any weight upon it Lord Bacon
had been described by one of the old English
poets as
" The wisest, brightest, meanest of mankind,"
and in this point of view his moral character
would not have given him any great weight in
his own day But to cite him as authority on
questions arising under the Constitution of the
United States was a departure from that accu-
racy which usually characterized the Senatoi
from Vermont The case alluded to by the Sen-
ator from Connecticut to illustrate his position
on this bill showed that the section under consid
oration was untenable He asked if an act con
coived here, and consummated without the Dis
tnct, could be constitutionally punished here—
punished where the act was not committed, but
meiely imagined? He certainly could not think
that a majority of the Senate could entertain the
opinion that this section was constitutional, when
it proposed the punishment of an oflense ima-
gined within the Distuct, but consummated else-
wheie, undei another junsdiction He could
haidly suppose that the Senate could sanction
the principle that Congiess had any powei to
authorize the punishment of the crime of dueling
within the limits of Virginia or Maryland
Mi PALLMADGEiose, at the request of the
authoi of the bill, [Mr Premtiss,] to cite another
authoiity in its support, without going back to
Loid Bacon *The State of New York had, in
1833, passed a bill similar to this, and though
the constitutionality of it was questioned, both
branches of the Legislatuie passed it by laige
majouties
Mr PRENTISS denied that there was any at
tempt in this bill to punish an offense committed
without the District It was an attempt to pun-
ish that part of the offense only which was com-
mitted heie It was competent for Congress to
punish a conspiracy here to commit a theft or
aison out of the District, and this was precisely
such a case He cited Loid Bacon as very high
authoiity He did not wi«h to go into the ehai-
actei of that distinguished jurist, but he would
say that, on all legal questions, no highei authoi-
ity could be cited
Mi    WALL said that the  section   aimed  to
punish, not the lighting of the duel, but the con-
spuacy entered into for the puipose of e\admg
the punishment intended foi that offense     Can
any Senator doubt the existence of a power in
Congiess to punish a conspiracy within the ten
miles square to do any unlawful act out of it
He would ask gentlemen who laise the constitu
tional doubt to suppose that a conspiracy was en-
teied into  in  this Distuct to seduce away the
pioperty ot peisons in the neighborhood, or to
excite slaves to escipe fiom their masteis, or to
commit latceny in the adjoining StUes   would it
not be competent (he would  not say wise) for
Congress to punish the peisms engaged in such
conspn icy?    Can Congiess not punish a con- i
spiracyin the District to commit atnme without  i
the District ?    The only diff-culty arises from the
confounding of teims and the object of this sec
tion—confounding the conspuacy to fight a duel ,|
with the fighting of the duel itself     He thougnt i
there was no necessity of reverting to ancient
authorities, it was meiely a question of policy
He could not perceive the slightest giound on I
which to raise a doubt of the constitutional power
of Congress to declaie the cumnnhfy of the act
intended to be punished, and to punish it as pro-
vided in the section in question.
Mr NILES contended that the bill was in-
tended not to punish an offense committed out of
the District, but to punish the inctpiency of the
offense here It was not to punish the offense
out of the District, but the act connected with it,
and which led to ¡t Whethei ¡t was just or
reasonable to do so was not the question, but
there was no doubt of tire right Of Congress to
punish such an offense    The act proposed to be
j punished was, as had been well observed bf the
Senator from New Jersey, a conspuacy or com-
bination to do an unlawful act Now, was not a
conspuacy to do an unlawful act, in itself a crime,
and was it not competent foi Congress to punish >
The act proposed to be punished is a crime—it is
committed m our limits, and by persons subject
to oui jurisdiction
Mr CLAY, of Alabama, said it would be time
enough to decide the question whether we ca 
punish a conspuacy to commit an offense else-
where, when that question was fairly pieseated
to the Senate, but he denied that that question
was then before them Mr C read the -section
he objected to, and said that it was plain that the
1 intention must not only be entertained here, but
that the act must be consummated beyond the
District Now, it was not pretended that a con-
I spiracy, or agreement to commit an offense, was
, to be punished under this bill, butceitam acts
must be done elsewhere, befoie the punishment
will apply If we pass, this law m its present
shape, an individual may be punished here foran
offense for which he may be punished by the
courts of Vnginia and Maryland As legards
the intimation of the Senator from New Jersey,
[Mr Wali ,] whether a certain offense cited by
him can be punished under an act of Congiess,
he would say that he had no doubt of it. If, by
publications or any other means, there should be
a seduction of the pioperty belonging to individ-
uals in the adjoining States, or if they should be
excited to commit cume, then it would be within
the competency of Congress to punish it, either
under the Constitution oi in accordance with the
punciplcs of international law He was not dis-
posed to occupy the time of the Senate, and
would barelv obseivp that this was presented at
the last session, when this objectionable sentence
was stucken out He hoped the same amend-
ment would be made now
Mr SOUTHARD opposed the motion to strike
out the fourth section Ihis section piovidesfor
the punishment of a conspuacy for the puipose
of evading the penalties inflicted by the act The
bill provides, m the fust place, for the punish-
ment of a cume, and then provides for the pun-
ísment of acts intended to evade the provisions of
the law The intention is to punish the previous
airangement or concert in the District to perpe-
I trate the crime, which is aftei wards consuratnated
without the limits of the Distuct He had no
doubt whatever of the power of Congress to pun-
I ish this conspuacy as it would a conspuacy to
peipetiate any othei criminal act Mr. S con-
tended that the remainder of the bill was a dead
letter, if this section was stricken out, on account
of the gieat facilities that existed to evade it He
hoped, if we passed the bill at all, it would be
I passed with this provision letamed in it
