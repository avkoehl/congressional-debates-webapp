RICHMOND, VA., June 29, 1862.

General BRAGG, Tupelo, Miss.:

Your department is extended so as to embrace that part of Louisiana east of the Mississippi, the entire States of Mississippi and Alabama, and the portion of Georgia and Florida west of the Chattahoochee and Apalochicola Rivers.* You can take charge of the Selma and Meridian connection, but the only funds appropriated to the work are the $400,000 authorized by Congress to be loaned to the Alabama and Mississippi Railroad Company. They can disburse it under your directions. After two days' fighting McClellan is in a critical position. Large re-enforcements are expect from the West. Strike the moment an opportunity offers.
