found in the year 1863, when the reports show
the following figures:
Secretary Chase... 
Register Chittenden X,0.i3, . 181
Showing apparent discrepancy of  $123.320.378
And he has followed this up, giving the state-
ments of both Secretary and ltegister through
all the intervening years until 1870, since
which year the reports agree.
Now I will take a single year upon which to
give -an explanation of the apparent difference
in the statements of these two officials. I do
not need more than that, because it will be
seen when 1 have made this explanation that
it applies to all years. One year will serve
my purpose as well as another; but 1 will
choose the year 1869, because it is the first
year of the present Administration, and iu it
the apparent discrepancy is the largest.
General Morgan gives it as follows:
Secretary Boutwell 
Register Allison 2,489,002,4bt>
Discrepancy..
$167,601,475
Here is a serious change. The difference
is alarming—unexplained it might well shake
confidence in the Treasury Department and
render worthless its statements as to the
amount of the debt,. It lias undoubtedly
puzzled honest men who believe in the Re-
publican party and in the success of its
administration of the Government.
Let us see how it arises. The statement of
the Secretary is given on page 39 of the finance
report for 1809, and the .Register's on page 317
of the same report. This is why they differ ;
the Secretary gives nothing but a statement
of the amount of Lhe principal of the outstand-
ing debt. The Register's is the same as the
monthly statement at the end of the fiscal year
1809, which includes all the interest then due,
and deducts cash in the Treasury, bonds issued
to the Pacific Hailroad Companies upon which
we have security, certain discounts on old
issues partly worn out and lost, a balance on old
ante-war debt which was not then included in
the debtstatement, and certain payments made
on the last days of the month, which do not
get into the Secretary's repoit.
Here is the exact statement of each of these
items as given from the accounts of the De-
partment, which 1 have had examined, and a
note explaining each item :

Which exactly agrees with the debt statement and

J cannot see how anything can be made
plainer than this. The two statements which

have troubled some gentlemen are each cor-
rect a« to all the facts that they cover, and
neither was made with the intent to deceive
the people. It is to Mr. Boutwell's credit that
in 1870 he established a system by which both
Secretary and Register include the same facts;
that is, all the facts in their statements, and so
their reports agree. _
The same reason applies to the differences
between the monthly statements from the
Treasury and the annual reports until 1871.
The former were made up after the manner
followed by the Register, including all assets
and discounts as offsets to the gross indebted-
ness.
Fault has been found also because the state-
ment ot'the present Secretary in his annual
report for 1871 ot the national indebtedness
in the years past disagrees with the reports
made by the several Secretaries in their
respective years. The explanation will be
found by any one who will examine the tables
and statements found on pages 18, 19, and 20
of the finance report for 1871, m which year
Mr. Boutweli, discovering errors in the ac-
counts ot loans and a want of unity, system,
and method in keeping them, had tiie whole
account from 17'Jl to 1871 examined and cor-
rected for eachyear in detail. It, then, I have
a firm ground to work upon, as proved by this
exposition, let us look at the figures.
TAXATION.
The war closed in 1805, in which year our
legislation imposing taxes reached its farthest
point. The net leveriue received into the
Treasury for the fiscal year ending July 1,
1800, was $558,032,020 00. Nearly allot this
the people paid through national taxation. It
was an enormous tax. It burdened every in-
dustry, and thereby pinched many households.
It was a larger sum of money than had ever
been taken by taxation from any people in
one year; and as soon as the war closed the
people demanded relief. While lhe Republic
was menaced by the living rebellion, thereby
imperiling the property and prosperity of all
alike; whilenewarmiesandnavies wereneeded
to cope with our foe, men patiently bore their
burdens, looking for an honorable peace to be
won ou the ovei throw of that foe, and content
to boar the almost constant presence of the
tax-gatherer until the end of the war should
biing relief. This immense revenue cume
almost entirely from two sources — impoit
duties aiid the internal revenue tax. The
former brought in $179,040,051 58; the lalter,
$309,i!20,813 42. The remainder was from
public lands, gold premiums, and miscel-
laneous sources.
'The national revenue tax was a war tax.
It was laid first in 1802, when the outlook was
darkest and bankruptcy impended. It had
been increased at every session of Congress
uinil the war ended. It brought in, in 1803,
$37,040,787 95, and ill 1805-00, the amount
1 have already given. But nowhere was it
borne uncomplainingly after the rebellion took
its death-blow at Appomattox, it rested upon
a generation to which such taxation had been
as unknown as the imposition ot '"tithes" or
the collection of "ship-money." It was a tax
laid directly upon nearly every manufacture in
the laud, and alterthat upon the sale of nearly
every article so manufactured ; and, as though
human ingenuity had been pushed to its ut-
most to devise new sources of revenue, after
manufacture and sale had been taxed, man
was taxed for owning scores of the aitides
which had already paid iu being made and
being sold. No enterprise escaped the drag-
net. Few vocations ran free from a license
tax. It is appalling to look at the "schedule
of articles and occupations subject to tax under
the excise law of the United States as amended
, March 3, 1865."
Look at this schedule which has just been
sent to me by the Commissioner of Internal
Revenue:
