HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Saturday, Feb turn y 15, 1834
On motion of Mr  A. H   SHEPPERD,
Resolved, That the Committee on Indian Affairs
be  instructed to inquire into the expediency of
compensating the Society of Moravians, or United
Biethren, foi their missionaiy improvements and
expenditures in the Cherokee country, within the
State of Georgia
ALABAMA CONTROVERSY.
The following resolution, submitted on the 14th
ult. by Mr. Gilmer, of Georgia, was taken up-
Resolved, That the Secretary of War bedirected
to communicate to this House all correspondence
which he may have had, or information in his
possession, in relation to the death of Hardeman
Owens, a citizen of Alabama, who was lately put
to death by a paity of regular soldiers; whether
said Owens was put to death ui puisuance of orders
fiom the War Depaitment, oi any officer of the
United States, and that he also communicate to
this House any correspondence which he may
have had, or other information in his possession,
in relation to any obstructions thrown in the way
of the execution of the process of the courts of
Alabama, issued for the purpose of bringing to
trial those by whom said Owens was killed, and
any correspondence m relation to the removal of
said prosecutions to the Distnct Court of the
United States.
Mi. G said, that knowing many of the friends
and relatives of the deceased, he was induced to
bring this subject to the attention of the House,
and he could testify that, as they weie mostly all
his neighbors and constituents, they weie of ie-
soeciable standing in society. The fathei of Mr
Owens had commanded a company in the service
against the Creeks, and died neaily in that place
where his son was subsequently put to death
Owens himself had been, in 1831), chosen to survey
the public lands, and be had means of knowing
that whilst in that employment he had given full
satisfaction. With this knowledge, then, of his
and their general good conduc', he had seen, with
surpnse, those who had brought odium on them-
selves, endeavoring to free themselves fiom it by
making aspersions on the character of the deceased
He had seen him, duung the last summer, at his
lesidence, which was situate on the gieat road to
NewOileans, many white settlers were aiound
him. At that time, he undeistood fiom him that
he had raised and possessed extensive crops, which
had been cultivated for him by his Indian neigh-
bors, peaceably, and with perfect good feeling,
that he had puichosed many valuable- Indian íe
serves from them whilst living there, for the time
he had been amongst them, being about twelve
months He knew that, at this penod, theie was
much excitement on the subject of Indian pin-
chases, and Government were trying to collect the
Indians together with a view to purchase then
lands. He saw Owens on the most amicable terms
with the Indians, and there was not any allega-
tion then made by them against him that he was
an intiuder. But shoitly after this, he was in-
formed that he had been put to death, and he had
received a letter from his bereaved widow, detail-
ing the circumstances, and entieating him to obtain
for her íedress To do this, he wrote to the Pres-
ident of. the United States, and soon afterwards
received a communication from the Secretary of
War,"couched in such terms as precluded any hope
of obtaining redress from that quaitei
Mrs. Owens, he was son y to state, was not
only left wi h a numerous and young family, bat
she was afflicted with a chionic dioease, all these
uicumstances made it difficult to conceive what
s tuition could moie justly clum thea symuathy.
It was n consequence of this feelu g> that he de
s red inquiry to be made into the encumstances
which attended the death of her husband He
"nderstood that it was occasioned by some sol-
diei s acting undei orders given by the Secretary
12
of War But was this to be the employ men t given
to then army > He thought such duties weie in
compatible with theduty that ought to be assigned
them, and nothing but the stiongest case of neces-
sity could justify their being so" employed. The
House, then, as the grand inquest of the nation,
were bound to inquiie into the circumstances at-
tending this act, and if a sufficient justification for
it was not found, they should see thpt theoutrage
upon then laws should be amply vindicated. The
fourth article of the Constitution expressly pro-
vided that it was the right of the peonle to be
secure in then persons, houses, &c , against un-
reasonable searches and seizuies, and that no
warrant should issue but upon piobable cause,
supported by oath or afHimation,and paiticulaily
descubmg thep'aceto be seaiched.and thepeison
or things to be seized, and such was the feeling of
the fiamers of the Constitution, that but for thib
amendment it never would have been adopted
This would be proven on reference to the vaiious
conventions held in Massachusetts, New Yuik,
and other places. He desired, therefore, in pur-
suance of this article, to know by what authonty,
by what warrant it was, that process had been
issued and given to the soldiers of the United
States, in consequence of which, one of the uti-
zens of this countiy, entitled to the btncfi'sof this
article of the Constitution, had been deputed of
his life' It was not his put pose to charge the
peisons implieattd in this transaction his oLject
was to have the tiansaction itself investigated
The second clause in the íesolution submitted by
him, was for the purpose of ascertaining wbethei,
aftei the act was perpetrated, and piocess theie-
upon had been issued foi the pui pose of having
justice done in the premises of the State couits of
Alabama, any obsttuction had been given to that
process by the officers of the army, acting under
the oidcis of the Secretary of Wai > He under-
stood that this was the case. That the death
having been caused by some soldiers of the regular
army stationed at Fort Mitchell, proceedings had
been instituted, writs of subptena ad leslifuaw'vm
had been issued, directed to those who were most,
cognisant of the circums'ances,and that when the
ofHcei in command of the fort was requested toa d
the civil authority, that aid was not given by him,
but the parties implicated lefused obedience to it,
did not give the lequired assistance, and finally,
that they were peimitted to leave the country foi
the puipose of avoiding the process which had
been issued against them. Thepioofs of ill these
facts, he beheved, were in the possession of the
Secretary of War, and could be communicated by
him to the House lie requned prool or this fact,
because it was made the bounden duty of all
officers in the seivice, by the twenty t1 nd aiticle
of legulations, commonly called ti e articles of
wai, to aid the civil authonty, ard if this was
refuseJ or wilfully neglected, then, m such cases,
the office1, so refusing was to be caslneied The
House would from this see the imporiai ce there
was, if the facts as alleged weie true, of having
that tiuth ascerta'ned The third clause in the
íesolution went to lequne a copy of any corie-
spondence on the subject of lemomig the prose-
cutions commenced against the parties ftom the
State courts of Alabama, in which they h id com
menced, to the circuit couits of the United States
He had íeason to beheve the>-e was such a cor-
respondence, as he held in his hand a punted copy
of 'letters that passed on this subject from the
Secreta y of War to the Governoi of Alabama, to
Major Mcintosh, Mi Kev, and to Mr Austin,
the deputy maishalof thesouthern district of th¡.t
Sta'e, and fiom which it wouid appear that the
Ui i ed States Government lad solar mterfeitd
with the S *¡.e lapsus to have codeovorea to effect
this ,etnova!ofacau«e whicu was titoim piositss,
and pen In g b^foie these courts, at d *hat the light
to do tl is was claimed by Coven mem o nave
been conferí ed on it by the authonty of what was
called the Foiee Bill If this was to be one of the
first flints of that bill he hoped it would be the
last Mr. Secretary Cass, in his lettei to Major
Mcintosh, saj s thct the seventh section of that b
makes ample provision for taking from the Sta'te
tribunals, and cairying befoie those of the United
States, alipeisons prosecuted foi proceedings under
that act But if the law was fully examined, he
contended that it would appeir there was no such
power to be found m it, nor was there any ap-
pointment of a special agent authonzed by it.
That act gave only the right of issuing a habeas
corpus, to iciease from prison such persons as
might be confined undei the State laws. He re-
feired to a decision given by the supieme court
in New York, whcie it was deteimmed, in the case
of a soldiei, killed at Fort Niagara, that the Su-
preme Comt of the United States had not authority
to act in similar cases, but that the powei was
possessed exclusively by the State couits.
Ileconcluded by saying that, although hedidnot
intend to make any chaige against the Secretary of
War, for whom he acknowledged he had the high-
est itspect, in this mattei, yet he was induced to
submit the resolution, believing that the Govein-
mentowed it to itself to have a matter investigated
inwhich there wei e giave violations of then laws;
the Houae were also bound to see that those laws
were not wilfully violatfd
Mr CLAY rose and said, before he would pio-
ceed to submit a few brief lemaikson this subject,
he wished that a message sent by the Governor of
Alabama to the Geneial Assembly of that S'ate,
should be read by the Clerk, that the House might
know how mis matter stood, and was viewed by
the Goveinci ot that State.
Tue me su^e having been read accordingly—
Mi SEABORN JONES e ¡piessed his desne
that the documents which weie sent with themes-
sage should be also lead.
Mi CLAY said he had no objection to this
being; done
[The following btters were then lead by the
Clerk, viz one ¡rom See etary Cass to Governor
Gayle, an extract fiom same to F S, Key, Esq ;
letters to M"jor J S Mcintosh and J S Austill,
Esq , a'l of winch, with Governor Gayle'b mes-
sage, have been heretofore published in our
paper ]
Mi CLAY observed that, as it appeared from
the documents that were just read, t! e matter in
controversy had been adjusted to the neifeet sat-
isfaction of Goveinoi Gayle, and as there was no
practical purpose suggested, he could not see the
propuety or the necessry, now, of instituting the
pioposetl inquiry He could, moreover, state that
the Legislatuie of Alabama had exercised their
opinion, and, in conform, y to the recommenda-
tion of the Govetnn-, passed a 1 >vv which would
regulate heicafterthe ¡nteicouise vvi h the Indians,
and prevent any collision with the n or theo lands
by miriuleis, which 1 uv he whs happy to be able
to cay, was considered satisfactoiy by the Exec-
utive of the United S ates
It would be recollected ilia* in this case a pros-
ecution ha"! been commenced against tne deputy
maishalof the district and othe s implicated with
him, fo1- the death of Owens, in one of 'he circuit
(ourtsnf AUbama, and although it -vas true, that
m the fiist instance Major Mcintosh had declined
paying obeuience to the process issued by the
coui t, yet when tl is circumstance was n aie known
to tne S°cietiry it War, he primi fly directed
Major Mcintosh not only to submit h1 nself to the
niocess, but he was instructed to facilitate by all
the means in his powei any investigation winch
t"e civil authority should considei it necessary to
make into the transaction, among those under his
comma'.d Heconsiueied that, as the whole matter
was more piupeiiyu subject fat |ud!cial cogni-
ztnie and investigation, tie House was not the
