at the first turn of the road WEST of the bridge across the north branch of Bayou Pierre. Shall I not order them to join or follow me when I move?

WILLOW SPRINGS, MISS., May 4, 1863.

Major General U. S. GRANT, Comdg. Dept. of the Tennessee:

GENERAL: I have the honor to report that General Osterhaus has reconnoitered along the Jackson road 6 miles. No portion of the enemy retreated on the road beyond General Osterhaus' present camp. The portion that retreated, as already reported, turned to their left, to make their way to Hankinson's Ferry, which is where I understand your headquarters are.

An Irishman, who deserted from the enemy's transport's crew last right at Hall's Ferry, reports that there are four steamers at Hall's Ferry, which the enemy have ordered to be destroyed upon our appearance. Hall's Ferry is 11 1/2 miles from here and 1 1/2 miles from the Jackson road. Shall I make an effort, by a night march, to seize them? Please answer at once.

WILLOW SPRINGS, MISS., May 4, 1863.

Major General U. S. GRANT, Comdg. Dept. of the Tennessee:

GENERAL: No trains or provisions have yet arrived from Grand Gulf. The officer in charge of transports has given preference to the SEVENTEENTH Army Corps in everything. The baggage of that corps is being sent forward, to the exclusion of ammunition and provisions for the Thirteenth Army Corps; priority is even given to forage over necessary supplies for the Thirteenth Army Corps. Only three of the wagons of my corps had been crossed over the river up to this morning. I am convinced that your order to send out provisions and ammunition with any teams that may be found at Grand Gulf has failed to challenge obedience. Without necessary provisions and ammunition, of course, I cannot answer for results.

Early this morning I sent a strong detachment, consisting of cavalry, infantry, and artillery, to Hall's Ferry, to seize, if possible, and boats there. I went 5 miles on the way myself.

WILLOW SPRINGS, May 4, 1863.

Major General U. S. GRANT, Comdg. Dept. of the Tennessee:

GENERAL: Colonel Clark Wright informs me that he drove [I. F.] Harrison's forces to Van Buren Bayou, 7 miles back of Saint Joseph, and captured 15 prisoners, some mules and horses. A portion of the cavalry under his command has just arrived; the balance he will bring over to Grand Gulf, and thence push forward to join me. I hope every facility will be afforded to hasten the transportation of his command, with its camp and garrison equipage and trains, across the river.

JOHN A. McClernand.
