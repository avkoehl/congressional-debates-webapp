enemy advanced four miles from the railroad yesterday with infantry and cavalry, but were held in check at that point after a skirmish, in which I had one man severely wounded. The cavalry fell back toward evening, but I have not heard up to this time whether the infantry have retired.

Yours, very respectfully,

C. J. COLCOCK,

Colonel, Commanding.

S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General:

It is deemed essential to military operations that the railroad from Milledgeville to Mayfield be speedily finished. It is graded and the bridges completed, except over the Oconee. Major Hottle, assistant quartermaster, an active and intelligent officer, accustomed to such work, should be at once put upon it. Am I authorized to have the work done and assign him to it?

General Hill reports from Brier Creek enemy advancing on all roads from Savannah on west side of river. I think your presence of extreme importance at this juncture.
