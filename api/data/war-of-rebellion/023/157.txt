when you get orders. General Halleck proposes that you shall cross at Decatur. It is far better to cross at Florence. Your supply train should cross at Eastport and bring a load of provisions. See that the scows which were used there are ready. Are these at Florence ready? When will the road be open again?

Major-General HALLECK, Corinth:

Have sent out scouts toward Fulton to keep a lookout for Van Dorn's approach. Saw a citizen to-day from Frankfort, who assures me they are not this side of Fulton. Twenty citizens arrested at various times and places are just in from Columbus. they were released last Friday and sent in a wagon 40 miles on the road this way. These men think there are very few north of Columbus.

Captain CHARLES O. JOLINE,

CAPTAIN: I have this day, through the chief of my corps, as required by my instructions, made a requisition for a large number of guns and a large supply of ammunition there for the service of the place. I think it a matter of great importance that this ordnance and ordnance stores hold be accompanied by an ordnance officer of experience, who should be permanently stationed here.
