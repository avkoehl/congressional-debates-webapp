that he got all the money before he turned Con
servative Sir, even allowing he had any Whig
blood in his veins, can the gentleman ascertain
whether it was this or the other sort of blood that
prompted him to these depredations' Certainly
the Locofoco predominated in him Sir, to be
serious, has it come to this' Are we brought so
to , that when public lobbers and plunderers are
detected and brought up for punishment, we are
to be told ' Oh, you should not complain of this,
or seek to expose him, because he is one of your
party' We permit our people to pick and steal,
but you should not complain when one of youi
side gets a little spice of the good things too "
Would it have ever been supposed that a repre-
sentative of the people in this House, and one
especially bound, from the place he occupies, to
devise ways and means to save the public purse,
would bring such an insulting argument before us'
Is it intended to hold up a bribe to the Swiss' a
leward to those who will become parasites and
panders to the men in powe-' Can that be the
meaning of such a course' He teils us that
Swartwout is to be whitewashed by a committee
appointed "in the dark " Sir, how many win
dows are there in this Hall' There, sir, over
head, is a magnificent dome, and the sky light at
its top sheds a vertical light upon us—the light of
day—of this day—and it is the 8th of January
remember, [the drums were heard at the moment ]
And we are to be told, in the full sunlight of
heaven, that what we do here is done " in the
dark'" What does the gentleman mean' Does
he mean that if we vote by ballot, the President
will not know how each man professing to be a
friend of the party vo'ed ' Is that what he means'
If it is, (and it is what he means,) 1 tell him that,
m a case like this, "darkness," in his sense of
the term, suits the interests of the people better
than light if to vote for this seaiching committee
vtvavoce, or leave it to be nominated by the Chair,
will insure the purposes of those in power, then
better weie it that we be descended into the tomb
prepaled beneath this Capitol for the ashes of the
Father of his Country Ay, sir, better that we
vdted in a vault, than be called to stand and vote
Hi front of the spears of power If the people
need the panoply of the ballot box, give them the
ballot-box
The gentleman asks, what has become of the
millions which have been stolen' What has
Swaitwout done with the money' knowing (as
he might know) that it was given for speculation
to the Morris Canal and Banking Company
Now, sir, it so happens that I, too, know some
thing about that Morns Canal Company, as well
as the honorable gentleman In 1837, I received
a letter stating that the public money had been
abstracted from the Girara Bank and other banks,
to be employed in purposes of speculation, and
that the Josephs, of New York, and Mr Lewis,
were privy to the facts I thereupon issued sum
monses calling Lewis and the Josephs to the city
of Washington, to testify before a committee
But when Lewis came before us, not one of the
various questions which I put to him to elicit the
truth of the case, would that famous and pure
svze tres committee suffer to be put' And, after
this, would you suppose that any friend of the
Administration would use here and dare to talk
to me about this Morris Canal and Banking Com-
pany' When I wrote to the Josephs, I got, in
reply, one of the most pitiable letters you ever
saw, stating that he had some bodily ailment
which would prevent him from coming on So
much for the gentleman"s "Morris Canal and
Banking Company "
But I ask you, sir, and I ask the country, and I
ask the gentleman himself, what were the officers
of this Government doing while these abductions
of the public" treasure, for purposes of private
speculation, were going on' [Here Mr Wise
sank his voice so low as to be totally inaudible to
the reporter ] Sir, the answer will be found in
the celebrated letter of Mr Senator Hendricks
to the Secietary, about the case of Spencer—
"Better let-tí alone r"
And now, sir, we are told that the light-houses,
the very eyes of commerce, are to be put out, and
river and harbor improvements are to stop, by
reason" of these defalcations of the Administra-
tion's favorites, while thousands upon thousands
are to go to buy votes, and to retain power most
ignomimously got, and which you have dishon-
ored
Mr BOON said, after the display of eloquence
which had just been witnessed by all present, he
had risen to address the House under some em-
barrassment But, inasmuch as what he had to
say was not intended for those ¡n the galleries of
the House, or for the House itself, he presumed
it would be permitted to pass for what it might
be worth to those for whose ear it was intended.
I (said Mr B ) wish to speak a few words for Bun-
combe I intend my remarks for my constituents,
if what I say should chance to reach them, in
order to let them know why it is that I will not
vote to appoint a committee of the House by
ballot—by the members of the House. I am op-
posed to the proposition, because it would be a
total departure, not only from the usual mode of
appointing committees of this House, but it would
also be a departuie from the universal practice
which has prevailed in the House of Represen-
tatives from its first organization to the present
time And, furthermore, it would be, as had
been very truly remarked by the gentleman from
New York, [Mr Címbrelevg,] a dark transac-
tion, and avoiding altogether any individual re-
sponsibility to the country, in the appointment of
important committees, thus to be raised in theáarü:,
b" ballot I again repeat the fact, that the appoint-
ment of a com mittee of this House by ballot would
be a dark transaction, for it would be utterly im-
possible for the country to know how, or for
whom, any member of the House voted If the
long-established practice in the appointment of
committees of this House is to be departed from
in this particular case, let it be by a moa voce vote,
in order that responsibility to the country may at-
tach where of light it should do
Mr B was in favor of the freest and fullest
investigations into frauds and defalcations of pub
lie officeis of every description, and he was also
in favor of the appointment of committees for any
and for all purposes by the Speaker of the House,
believing that a fairer committee for all parties
would be obtained by appointment made by the
presiding officer of the House than by the House
itself Should the committee be appointed by the
Speaker of the House, he would, no doubt, ap-
point some Conservatives, some Whigs, and some
Administration men This (Mr B said) would
be light But should the committee be appointed
by the House by ballot, it would most likely be
composed of members of one party only This
would not be right or proper But it is both right
and proper that there should be a majority of Ad-
ministration men on all committees It was (he
said) the parliamentary usage to appoint, on all
committees, a majority of members composing
such committees who were known to be friendly
to the Administration
Mr B said some gentlemen seem to think that
it is no matter whether a public defaulter be a I
Whig, or a Conservative, or an Administration |
man     Sir, I  think  differently from gentlemen j
entertaining these views     It has been  the con- I
stant policy of the Opposition, by eveiy possible
means, to make the people at a distance fiom this
city believe that there was not m the whole coun
try a Government officer ora public defaulter that
was not an Administration man, and that all the
frauds upon the public Treasury have been com-
mitted by friends of the late and present Chief |
Magistrates    This (said Mr B ) is untrue, and |
it was but right that the truth should go forth to
the people, and the country should know whether .
the Whigs, or the Conservatives, or the Dem-
ocrats, had committed the greatest public frauds,
or stolen most from the public Treasury     This J
was a very important fact to be known and prop
erly understood by the American people     If, at
any time, an office holder of the Opposition was
removed from office for any cause whatever, the
yelp of "proscription for opinion's sake" was
immediately raised by the Federal press through-
out the country, and if certain of the late public
defaulters had been earlier detected in their pec-
ulations upon the Treasury, and removed from
office, the country would have heard the old cry
of " proscription for opinion's sake."                  '
The gentleman from Virginia [Mrs Wise] pro-
pounded to the Chair a question of arithmetic, to
be answered by the rule of three, and which was:
" If a Conservative office holder had, m a given
period, stolen from the public Treasury a million
and a quarter of dollars, how much would a full-
blooded Locofoco have stolen in the same length of
time'" Now (said Mr B ) I propose that the
question be put in this way: ««If a Conservative
office holder has, in a given period of time, stolen
from the public Treasury a million and a quarter
of dollars, how much more would a full-blooded,
wiggle-tail Whig have stolen m the same length Of
time'"
Mr BOND obtained the floor, and, haying
proceeded for some time, moved an adjournment.
And thereupon the House adjourned.
DRY DOCKS.
DEBATE  IN  THE   HOUSE,
/onmtry 10,1839
The House having resolved itself into the Committee «f
the Whole on the state of the Union (Mr Basks, of Vir-
ginia, m the chair) on certain bills reported from the Coia«
mittee on Naval Affairs, and which had been made the
special order for this day, die committee tooh up foreoa-
sideraaon the bill for extending and improving the Nary,
Yard at Brooklyn, New York, and for constructing a Biy-
Dock at the same
A motion was made by Mr. Patnter to amend
the bill by inserting a new section appropriating
$ 100,000 for the construction of a dry-doc&at th 
navy yard in Philadelphia.
Mr PAYNTER said that the time had arrived
when every navy yard of any magnitude, m our
country ought to have a dry dock In the year
1835, one of the largest, and probably best, ships
in our navy was launched from the navy-yard in
Philadelphia That ship had been taken to Gos-
port to be finished What would have been the
consequence if this were to be the case in time of
war' The ship would be captured before she
got out of the capes. This was a bad condition
to be m He hoped his amendment would pre 
vail He believed that a dry-dock could not be
built under one or two years, and he asked this
appropriation for the purpose of commencing
upon it.
Mr PICKENS said he had risen simply to re*
mark that the bill, as it came from the Committee
on Naval Affairs, was such as could receive his
support most cordially It provided for theeüecí4
tion of a dry-dock near the city of New York—*
measure which was admitted in all quarters tobé
absolutely essential for our ships, and it w*s a
remarkable fact that a work of this kind would
more than pay back the cost of its construction m
a very few years, in the preservation and repair
of our vessels But if the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania [Mr Pavnter] persisted in his effort to
append this new appropriation for another object,
other gentlemen in different parts of the House
would offer their amendments, and would thus
cieate an interest in the House in favor of local
appropriations which would be the means of de-
feating the bill If the bill was to be loaded down
with such amendments, it could not receive
his (Mr P 's) sanction This was a branch of
that system which had been introduced here, and
whu-h had given birth to unsound legislation by
combining local interests on particular measures,
and thus uniting a majority which would pass a
bill amounting to a million of dollars, when, prob-
ably, not a single isolated measure contained m
it could, of itself, and on its own merits, have re-
ceived the vote of a majority He protested
against this system, and hoped the amendment
would not prevail L t the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania bring in a bill at the next session of Con-
gress to gain his object, let it stand on its own
separate merits But let it not interfere with the
object of the present bill Mr P believed thata
dry-dock was absolutely required at New York—
more so, probably, than ¡n any other part of the
country
Mr INGHAM said, that although the gentle-
man from Pennsylvania, [Mr Pavnteh,] who
offered this amendment, was «a member of tire
Committee on Naval Affairs, yet he had aot
