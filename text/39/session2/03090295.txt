1867.
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

Mr. KELLEY. Allow me to say that those
■bonds are payable in "lawful motley," and
if 'the English people send them over here
before we resume specie payment, they must
take their redemption in lawful-money, let it
be specie or greenbacks.
Mr. BUNDY. That is a very important
suggestion, and I am obliged to the gentleman
for making it. .
Mr. MAYNARD. I wish to ask my friend'
from Pennsylvania [Mr. Kelley] whether he
thinks that the Secretary of the Treasury, by
making an official announcement that these
bOllds will be paid at maturity in coin, creates
thereby any moral obligation upon_ the part of
the Government to pay them in coin.
Mr. KELLEY. I have never supposed that
the word of the Secretary of the Treasury could
override the law of the land; and as those who
bought these bonds bought them with the under-
standing that according to the terms of the law
they should be redeemable in lawful money, the
Secretary cannot change the terms of the con-
tract. I am therefore in no hurry to give the
gold instead of greenbacks, as in doing so we
will crush all branches of American industry.
Foreign bondholders cannot complain if they
have to take what is "nonHnated in the bond,"
and do not get gold when we promised but law-
ful money.
Mr. BIJNDY. I am very much obliged to
gentlemen for interjecting such good doctrines
into my speech. They will be highly valuable
as illustrations.
Now, Mr. Speaker, I have stated who are the
interested parties ; and they are the only parties
interested. On the one side are the non-pro-
ducers, with the bondholders, domestic and for-
eign, added; while on the other are the pro-
ducers of this country, the men who work, I
care not where they work; on them the whole
weight of this thing must eventually fall. They
constitute the bed-rock in these strata. What-
ever we may say here, the capitalist, the man
who has the money, is not to be the sufferer by
a crisis. The weight of the calamity falls at
last, and most severely, upon the man who
works—the producer.
But, sir, it is urged that the reputation of
the Government is involved in this matter. I
have seen intimations coming from across the
waters that we should see to it that very early,
perhaps even before all the revolted States are
restored to practical relations with the Gov-
ernment, the resumption of specie payments
shall be accomplished. In order to enforce
this doctrine, the example of Great Britain
after the Peninsular war is quoted to us as an
illustration. What is the tact in regard to
this matter? How did Great Britain resume
specie payments ? What are her consols worth
to-day in the market? Do they command
specie dollar for dollar with their denomina-
tional characters? No, sir. They are quoted
in London at ninety-two cents on the dollar;
while our five-twenties in the same market are
quoted at seventy-two. Do you call that a
resumption of specie payments? If it were
proposed that our Government should resume
specie payments upon that principle, there
would not perhaps be so much objection to it.
Take all our vast debt; consolidate it; declare
tliat you will pay but three per cent, interest on
it, and then let its quotable value in the
market be but ninety-two cents on the dollar,
and you will have resumed specie payments in
the same way that England has done it, so-far
as the indebtedness of the Government is con-
cerned.
But, Mr. Speaker, the evil of this thing does
not stop here. In the first place, we are not
conditioned like Great Britain. We never
have been ; and we shall not be within the next
hundred years. Her natural resources are
nearly all developed; and the Government,
the capitalist, the agriculturalist, and the manu-
facturer are all a unit. They are on one side
of the line; on the other are the paupers of
Great Britain, the artisan, the mechanic, and
the laborer. Hence, under the system prevail-
ing there, the manufacturers and capitalists can,
in "almost every case, avoid a financial crisis
when they see it approaching. All that they
need to do is to get the Bank of England to lower
the rate of discount and issue their paper,
thus anticipating and avoiding a financialcrisis.
It is no£ so with us, and it never will be. Here
the Government is one thing; our agriculturists
another thing; our manufacturers another, so
far as their respective interests are concerned.
Hence I maintain that England cannot fur-
nish us any example in the solution of our
financial difficulties. There cannot exist in
that country a condition of things analogous
to that prevailing here. There is just as much
propriety in quoting the practice of Great Brit-
ain under her financial system as a rule for our
Government as there is in quoting international
law established by despotic and monarchical
Powers as a rule to guide us in the restoration
of our Government. _ ■
Why, Mr. Speaker, we never did do anything
here like Great Britain, and I hope we neyer
will. Here it is that the people are sovereign,
and they manage their own affairs pretty much
as they please. Not so there. Therefore I
say the rule does not apply. .Gentlemen are
perfectly willing, apparently, to leave all mat-
ters pertaining to our interests in this country
to the people who are involved, except this
question of finance. We maintain until we
get into Congress that that is their right, under
the spirit and form of our Government. I
know how I have felt once. When I was at
home as an humble individual, I thought I was
able to conduct my own finances without any
interference from others; but somehow or other
when I got in here I thought it was a part of my
duty to regulate the financial affairs of all my
neighbors. I know that is natural; but, sir,
the effect of all such action is detrimental to
the business interests of the country. So much,
then, for that view of the question.
Now, Mr. Speaker, I concede that the bond-
holders have a large interest in this question
of "contraction and resumption," for those
are the catch phrases; and perhaps, without
intending to say anything against our national
banking system at all or any of the persons
who are engaged in it, I must be allowed to
say there is no class of men in the country who
are anymore interested than they are, because
their bonds constitute the basis of their circu-
lation.
There is another aspect of this case. By
the legislation of Congress you tax out of ex-
istence every State bank in the country. In
other words, the national banking system is
the only one we have or can have. They have
the matter in their own hands. It is curious
to see how the capital has been distributed,
and how it has been appropriated by different
sections of the country. Now, sir, I do not
blame men for being actuated to some extent
by self-interest in this country, and therefore
it is not surprising to me that a great effort is
being made to so amend our national banking
law so that our country national banks shall
be compelled to keep an agency in New York.
It is not a matter of surprise, when we look at
the New England States. I will show how
ihat thing has been " fixed up." Take, if you
please, the State of Massachusetts, with a pop-
ulation, I do not remember how many, but
something over a million. In this race of dil-
igence, for that is what it is. they have appro-
priated of the banking capital of three hundred
and odd millions authorized by Congress, sev-
enty-niue millions, over one fourth of the
whole. The State of Ohio, with a population
twice that of Massachusetts, with an area much
larger, with a country for agriculture far supe-
rior, with a belt of mineral territory six miles
wide, running from the northeast to the south-
west, which, if properly developed, would be
worth more than all the lands and manufactories
of Massachusetts, has a banking capital of this
association of—how much do you think ?—
about twenty millions, or about one fourth of
Massachusetts.
I do not wish to make any invidious com-
parisons ; I only wish to show how fast men
go in this race of diligence. Take, if you please*
seven States, New York, Massachusetts, Maine,
Rhode Island, New Hampshire, Vermont, and
Connecticut, and of the sixteen hundred and
odd banks they have seven hundred and ninety-
eight of them, with an authorized capital of
about two hundred and sixty-two million dol-
lars. Ifyou include Pennsylvania—and we have
a right to include it so far as the Northwest is
concerned—there is this condition of things:
that of the. sixteen hundred and forty-sevea
banks, they have nine hundred and ninety-nine
of them, or two thirds, leaving for the other
twenty-eight States of the Union and all the
Territories but six hundred and forty-eight
banks ; that is all that can be made under
the law. In order to show how this national
banking system has been "fixed up " and ap-
propriated, I append the following tables, ex-
tracted from the last report of the Secretary
of the Treasury:
