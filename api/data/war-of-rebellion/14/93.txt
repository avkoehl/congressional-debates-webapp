
enemy (off Poquosin, I mean) anything more than what they know now, viz, that we have made a depot there.

I fear they have now fortified the mouth of the river, and have manned them, evening before last, with the troops that crossed over from Yorktown in our view, as I can't see what they have done with them.

Might not a landing be made at night on Gloucester on this side if your information gives assurance of strong works on the Severn?

Please look at York River chart 3 1/1 miles below Gloucester Point and 5 miles also.

Yours, very truly,

J. S. MISSROON,

Commander.

The point I would first indicate is plainly seen from our ship. Will you not come on board and see it?-the first sand beach just beyond the meadow-land. Gunboats could cover landing 600 to 800 yards off. No battery in view. A spot where oyster boats used to make landings.

A feint might be made at the Severn to keep troops there if fortified or to hand if not fortified.

Signal for a boat to land at Shields' house as the best point for embarking.
