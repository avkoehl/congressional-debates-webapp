Numbers 9. [Extract from General Milroy's report.]

At one time, not receiving assistance from the rear, as I had a right to expect after having sent for it, and our struggling battalions being nearly overcome by the weight and persistence of the enemy's attack, I flew back about one-half mile, to where I understood General McDowell was with a large portion of his corps. I found him and appealed to him in the most earnest manner to send a brigade forward at once to save the day or all would be lost. He answered coldly, in substance, that it was not his business to help everybody, and he was not going to help General Sigel. I told him I was not fighting with General Sigel's corps; that my brigade had got out of ammunition some time before and gone to the rear, and that I had been fighting with a half dozen different brigades, and that I had not inquired where or to what particular corps they belonged. He inquired of one of his aides if General-was fighting over there on the left. His aide said he thought he was. McDowell replied that he would soon help him, for he was a good fellow. He then gave the order for a brigade to start. This was all I desired. I dashed in front of them, waved my sword, and cheered them forward. They raised the cheer and came on at double-quick. I soon led them to where they were most needed, and the gallant manner in which they entered the fight and the rapidity of their fire soon turned back the tide of battle. But this gallant brigade, like many others which had preceded it found the enemy too strong for them as they advanced into the forest, and was forced by the tremendous fire that met them.
