APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
[Dec.,
31st Cong 2d Sess.
in the ihilVrent sections of the United States, of
correjipnndinu functions with the English Surveyor
of Posts, to take charge of certain matters of mail
arrant ments 111 his section, in which personal ob-
servation on the spot is beneficial,anil to make the
contracts, subject to confirmation by the Postmas-
ter General, ont he inferior class of routes. This
might be effected by some modification of the pres-
ent special agencies and some alterations in the
law.
It would afford still further relief, and give more
stability and efficiency to the service, if the dur-
ation of the contracts was regulated as in the
English mail service. Instead of terminating ab-
solutely at the expiration of four years, let the
contract continue over beyond the time set, unless
the Department or the contractor gives six months
notice of intention to determine ft on that day,
with power to either, by like notice given at a
certain portion of the year, to determine on a sub-
sequent day. Whenever contracts were mutually
satisfactory in their terms, and well performed,
they would continue over, and thus greatly mod-
erate those revolutions m the service that succeed
each annua] letting, and so seriously disturb, for
several months, each section of the Union once
every four years, with the derangements incident
to a change of contracts.
Believing that postage will be reduced as low as
it can be short of contributing from the public
Treasury to the cost of transporting private cor-
respondence—so low as to be relieved from that
portion of the present charge which prevents the
full use of the mails, and which is, besides, a tax
imposed to defray the expense of certain meas-
ures of public policy, that the public at large
should sustain and not the postage-payer, exclu-
sively—I refer to this expected measure, in con-
nection with the subject of improvements in the
performance of post office business, to ur^e the
importance of having a uniform rate of postage,
free from all exceptions that would interfere with
the simplicity of the accounts, so that the en-
tries in the post bill, and the accounts may be
made solely by the numbers of rates—counting a
double letter as two, and so 011. There might be 1
one rate for unpaid, and another (to be less) for '
paid letters; for the entries of unpaid and paid
postage must of course be separate. There might
be a separate rate for newspapers, because they
cannot be entered in the post bill; but the account
of them should be kept by a quarterly exhibit. If
pamphlet postage is not to be the same as news-
papers, let it be, with a view to the accounts,
double the newspaper postage, so that a pamphlet
may lie entered in the newspaper accounts as two
newspapers, and where there is an additional
charge on account of excess of weight, let it be
made at full and not fractional rates, as at present, i
A discrimination might be made, in a lower rate
for paid newspapers and pamphlets without inter-
fering with this principle of convenience in the ac-
counts—which is a maiter certainly worthy ofcare-
ful consideration in framing the provisions of the
law, since it will promote dispatch in business,
and accuracy in the accounts, and save labor and
expense.
From the nature of tilings, the low uniform letter
rate will not include the sea-going letters. But
the postage on them needs alteration. There are
now no less than ten or eleven different rates of
postage on that class of letters—a most perplexing
diversity. I judge that two rates would be suffi-
cient-—the higher, for the correspondence with the
Eastern Continent and its islands, with South
America, and all places on the Pacific and beyond;
and the lower rate for all other places to which
letters are sent by sea conveyance. But the Post-
master General should have the power of modify-
ing these rates to conform to those of other coun-
tries, the better to enable him to make international
mail arrangements, or conteract any unfavorable
postal policy in other Governments. j

By the joint resolution of the 14th February
last, the sum of $2,450,000 was appropriated to de-
fray the annual expenses of collecting the revenue,
in addition to such sums "as maybe received
from storage, cartage, drayage,and labor."
By the provisions of the act of 3d March, 1849,
in lieu of the net revenue, " the gross amounts of
all duties received from customs, from the sales of
the public lands, and from all miscellaneous
sources," were required to lie paid into the Treas-
ury without "any abatement or deduction"
whatever. This devolved upon the Department
the necessity of transferring all coin received to
the depositaries designated by the act of 6th Au-
gust, 1846, and retransporting the sums necessary
for the current and incidental expenses of collect-
ing the revenue, or the exercise of the implied dis-
cretionary powers conferred by the same act upon
the Secretary of the Treasury to designate such
other depositaries as circumstances might require.
The collectors of customs and surveyors of inte-
rior ports have, therefore, been made depositaries,
! and given bonds as such.
I concur in the views of my predecessor that
the change was a salutary one. The labors of the
collectors and their clerks, though largely increased
thereby, have been, in general, performed by the
force authorized at the date of my assuming the
duties of this Department.
The law of 29th July last, directing all convey-
ances of vessels to be recorded at the custom-
houses, necessarily required some addition to the
clerical force, and consequently one clerk for that
duty has been authorized at each of the larger
ports. The fees allowed, it is hoped, will equal
the expenses incurred thereby.
I transmit herewith statement C, showing "the
amount of money expended at each custom-house
in the United States during the fiscal year ending
the 30th June last, the number of persons em-
ployed, and the occupation and salary of each
person at each of said custom-houses during the
period aforesaid," as required by the sixth section
of the act of 3d March, 1849.
The act of 30th September last authorized the
employment of ten additional inspectors at New
Orleans. The proviso to the section, in the opin-
ion of this Department, nullifies the enacting clause,
and the relief so much required awaits the further
legislation of Congress.
By the act of 28th September last, six collection
districts were created on the Pacific, and two east
of the Rocky Mountains on our northern frontier.
These give occasion for a large increase in the per-
sonnel of the department of customs, and a more
than corresponding increase in the expenditures.
The maximum salaries of those officers attached to
the Pacific districts designated by that act, though
in general reduced by the Department, are believed
to be only commensurate with the expense attend-
ant upon a residence in that country. That basis,
as fixed by Congress, has been the standard adopt-
ed by the Department, relatively, for the compen-
sation of the subordinate officers; and in the exer-
cise of the discretion given by the first section of
the joint resolution of 14th February last, such
salaries have been assigned as, in the opinion of
the Department, were required to insure to the
Government officers of ability and integrity; and
full reliance is placed upon an honest and faithful
discharge of the onerous and responsible dirties
devolving upon them in that remote section of our
country.
The great reduction of the revenue marine made
by my predecessor, in consequence of the limited
appropriations, has been represented as injurious
in its effects. This branch of the service, inti-
mately connected with and necessary to the collec-
tion of the revenue, is, in the opinion of the
