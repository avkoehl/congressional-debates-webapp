The Tariff—Mr. Ifubard.
Extractsfrom Mr. Jenifer's letter to Mr. Webster.
ViBsvi, September 30,1841.
i suggested to the Minister of Finance the experiment of
permitting a limited quantity of American tobacco to be ad-
mitted, through the port of Trieste, into the Austrian domin-
ions, with mollified duties, independent of the existing con-
tracts; being fully satisfied that such permission would be
the mean* of profit to the American planter, at the same
time that the Austrian government would obtain a much bet-
ter article for manufacture and consumption, at a less pricc
than government pays under the present system. Should
this experiment be only partially made, there can be but
little doubt that the whole supply of foreign tobacco might be
furnished from the United States, upon better terms to the
Austrian government, and with mutual benefit to the Amer-
ican planter. The desire for the better qualities of our
American tobacco, where an opportunity has been afforded
to taste it, without adulteration, seems to be universal. Nor
would its introduction conflict much with that of Hungarian
growth, which is generally of an inferior quality, and con-
sumed by the soldiery and peasantry principally. I left the
minister under favorable impressions of a liberal disposi-
tion towards the United States.
The contracts for the supply of foreign tobacco not ex-
piring till the ensuing ; ear, and the triennial meeting of the
Hungarian Diet being fixed for the next spring, the prob^.
ability is, that no decision will be had as regards that articler
before that period. There is ei iitnlly a desire on the part
of ministers here to enlarge theirtrade uith the United States,
so that the Austrian government may not be dependent upon
' continental Europe or England, for the supply of those ar-
ticles required from abroad.
Extract from Mr. Jenifer's letter to Mr. Dodge.
Vienna, November 14,1842.
The question of the tobacco trade is one of the most
delicate in Europe—connected as it is with the financial con-
cerns of those governments, all of which derive more or less
revenue from its growth, manufacture, sale, or import.
We find in these communications from our for-
eign ministers pretty strong reasons for dissuading
the tobacco planters from jeoparding their great sta-
ple, by joining the manufacturers in a mad crusade
against our foreign commerce. When great exer-
tions are making all over Europe to place our agri-
cultural staples upon a better footing in their markets,
shall we blindly thwart that wise and beneficent pol-
icy, by adhering to law3 which militate against so
salutary a change? I hope the good sense of the
committee will indicate, by their acts, a determina-
tion not only to abstain from doing injustice, but de-
clare by their deeds that they will discard these bar-
barous restrictions, and give to commerce and agri-
culture that degree of freedom which the welfare of
the country so much demands.
Having pointed out a variety of defects in the ex-
isting law, I now propose very briefly to state some
of the reasons inducing me to favor the bill now un-
der consideration. ,
Having already shown that the act of 1842 im-
properly increased the taxes, of course I should be
in favor of any tolerable mode of correcting that in-
justice. When I compare the bill now before me
with the law as it stands, I am most sensibly im-
pressed with the great difference between them.
The leading recommendation of the new bill is, that
it proposes to diminish the extent of indirect taxation,
by lowering the rate of duties. Nor is this the only
important advantage which it presents to the coun-
try. Any bill reducing materially the rate of duties
on importations must, by liberating commerce to
that extent, augment its volume, and increase its im-
portance. This change being accomplished, another
result, no less desirable, ensues. As the demands
of commerce increase, the value of our staple pro-
ductions increase. But the impetus thus given to
these great departments of business does not stop at
this; but, on the contrary, the flood tides caused by
the disruption of the shackles which now fetter our
commerce, like the waves ofthe mighty deep, pervade
every inlet, and impart activity and spirit through-
out every part of t he country. It is true, there are
some features in the bill which I do not approve;
but when I view it as a substitute for the existing
law, I should be recreant to the welfare of the coun-
try were I to permit fastidious notions to prevent
my cheerfully accepting this as the best measure of
relief which the circumstances of the country, at
this time, allowed us to hope for. This course I
hold to be sanctioned by sound common sense prin-
ciples; nor can I doubt but that it will commend it-
self to the favorable consideration of the country.
I am well aware that there are a great many con -
flic,ting inteiests to consult m adjusting this question.
These facts, if no other reasons could be found, are
enough, '.o insure a eorrespsndmg diversity of opin-
ion in arranging the details of a bill of this descrip-
tion. That the Committee of Ways and Means,
therefore, had a heavy responsibility resting on
them, we most readily perceive, and when I reflect
on all these things, 1 feel but the more disposed to
, support a measure which we have the best reasons

to believe has been as wisely and as justly balanced
as circumstances would permit. With such feel-
ings 1 have examined the bill, and, in all sincerity,
I declare my approval of it, as things now stand.
While it may not be perfect, yet, perhaps, as a
whole, it is the very best measure we can obtain.
After these general remarks, I will proceed in de-'
tail to notice a few of its leading features.
But in .doing this, I must again resort to compar-
ative statements, which are taken from the bill and
accompanying estimates.

Remarks.
In the foregoing list, 61 articles are enumerated, which,
under the act of 1812, paid duties ranging from 15 to 290 per
cent", or an average of 64 19per cent.
B) the act ofl844, reductions aiymade on the same arti-
cles ranging from 2 to 26o per cent., or an average of 3-4.72
per cent.
Fifty articles on the foregoing list, under the act oflS44,
pay duties ranging from 10 to 67 per ccnt., or an average of
30 Ofi per cent.
Under the act of 1S42,7 articles paid ad valorems.
" " 5 " "
" " 30 " " «pecifiA<;.
Under the act of 1^41 42 articles pay ad valorems
•• " 8 " " specifics

The T, which, under ihe act of m2, paid ad valorems,
retain their ad valorem character; but reduecd 0 and 10 per

The 30, which, under the act of 1842, paid specifics, now
pay ad valorems, ranging from 20 to 30 per cent.—reduced.
The 8, which, under the act of 1842, paid specifics, re-
tain their specific character—reduced
The 1. which, under the act of 1812, paid a specific duty,
now admitted fice.
The r>, which, under the act of 1342, paid minimum duties,
now pay an actual ad valorem duty.
An examination of the foregoing table, it is confi-
dently believed, will satisfy most persons opposed
to the existing law, that they should not hesitate
about adopting this bill as a substitute. The farmers
and planters, tradesmen and consumers, will all find.
in the retimed rates of duties, ample arguments in
favor of the bill. Those engaged in- cornmerce will
find a great deal to commend the measure to their
favorable consideration. Those employed in manu-
factures will also perceive that great advantages are
extended to thean. Indeed, no section can fairly
claim it, as protecting their peculiar interest, at the
expense of any other portion of the confederacy; nor
can the manufacturers claim it as a bill extending
to them their wanted monopolies, neither can the
consumers say that it disregards their interests.
Perhaps it does not deviate very far from doing jus-
tice to all parties. Such, sir, are some of the
reasons inducing me to support the bill.
J cannot take leave of this financial question,
without commenting on the acts of the two great
parties now arrayed against each other, during the
time that each one has swayed the destinies of this
government. Having been honored with a seat in
the last Congress, i well remember the zeal dis-
played by the party then having a controlling ma-
jority in both branches of Congress, in passing their
tariff kills. The whig party came into power cry-
ing out "relief." But m what way dia they pro-
pose to effect that object? By passing a tax bill at
the extra session in 1841; yet this was inadequate
for their purposes, notwithstanding they promised
to reduce the expenditures, and correct abuses. In
1842 the famous whig tariff, under which the coun-
try is now groaning, was passed; but these bills con-
stituted only one chapter. The second chapter em-
braced the public debt, which, in the canvass of
1840, they so much deprecated. This debt has not
been paid, but they have increased it since the 3d of
March, 1841, according to the treasury estimates up
to December 1,1843, about $18,363,890 18. Is this
the way to relieve the country? But to place the sub-
ject in a more intelligible point of view, allow me to
invite the attention of the committee to the follow-
ing:
Jl statement showing} in part, the amount of taxes
which the whigs calculated to impose on the people
by the tariff bills of 1841 and 1842, for the support of
government.
The amount imposed by the act of 1841, ac-
cording to the treasury estimates, is about $1,000,000 UU

mittee of Ways and Means in the

a view to accomplish that re-
We find from this table, that one of the proposed
measures of whig relief was to impose an annual ad-
ditional tax, upon those already existing, of $12,400,-
000. "While this has been attempted, contrary to
what might have been supposed, they have also
augmented the public debt from the 3d March, 1841,
up to 1st December, 1843, $18,363,890 18. Thus,
sir, they have given the country the benefit of their
combined measures of relief, consisting of increased
taxation, and a greatly increased public debt. It
seems that they do not know how to impose taxes,
for the revenue has fallen vastly short of what they
contemplated having it when they passed the tariff
act of 1842. Yet the country is most heavily taxed
for the benefit of the manufacturing classes. JNoj-do
they seem to know how to administer the govern-
ment, for the public debt has increased most enor-
moxishj under their management. How advan-
tageously do the two last democratic administrations
compare with this era of whig misrule! Notwith-
standing all the denunciation that the whig party
have so lavishly dealt out against the democracy, let
them cast up the account, and learn in whose favor
the balance will stand upon these great financial
questions. Having glanced at the miserable condi-
tion of our national finances under the supervision
of the present whig party, let us for a moment turn
to the other side of the picture, and review their
condition during the period of democratic rule. In
the first place, they sustained the policy of reducing
