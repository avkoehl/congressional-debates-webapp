Revision of the Schedules of February and March last.

Since the adoption of our schedules for the months of February and March last the financial bills passed by Congress taxing the currency had seriously impaired the value of the old issues of Confederate Treasury notes. At this juncture large numbers of horses and mules were impressed and paid for in a currency which was in a few days thereafter to be taxed 33 1/8 per cent.

The Board of State Commissioners having adjourned and one of its members out of the State, it could not be convened in time to review our schedules of prices. Under this state of facts we have re-examined and rearranged our tariff of prices, so far as we have been advised of recent impressments, proposing in this mode to remedy any diminution of valuation which may have occurred from the action of Congress upon the currency. Therefore we asses the average value of artillery or wagon horses or mules impressed since the passage of the currency bill of the 17th of February last at $600. This ward will entitle each person to receive a higher compensation accordingly as each horse or mule recently impressed be considered as being a first, second, or third class artillery
