HDQRS. SECOND CORPS, ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, May 7, 1864. (Received 4.30 a. m.)

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

GENERAL: Picket officers' reports agree that the enemy in my front, or a portion of it, commenced moving to the extreme left of my line about 6 last evening. The commands given to the enemy's infantry could be heard and the noise of artillery. General Barlow, commanding the left, thinks they are massing opposite him, and expects an attack in the morning. If you hear heavy artillery firing you may infer that my left is engaged. It is of the greatest importance that I have at my disposal troops to strengthen this point. The ground there is clear and the enemy have fine positions for artillery. Inclosed is a sketch* made for me yesterday. The ground at the point marked "A" commands nearly all in my front. A battery was used against me there to-day.

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, May 7, 1864-4.40 a. m. (Received 6 a. m.)

Major-General HANCOCK, Commanding Second Corps:

Your dispatch of this night is just received (at 4.30 a. m). The major-general commanding directs me to say that he has just directed General Sedgwick to keep General Getty's division in reserve to be sent to you or elsewhere as may be most required. At present the position of General Getty is not known to him; that in the event of pressing necessity you must call on General Burnside for support,+ which he or some part of your own line may afford.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, May 7, 1864-5.30 a. m. (Received 6.10 a. m.)

Major-General HANCOCK, Commanding Second Corps:

The major-general commanding directs me to inquire whether you have not Stevenson's command and Robinson's two brigades to support you. It is questionable whether he will be able to send you re-enforcements.

HDQRS. SECOND CORPS, ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, May 7, 1864-6.10 a. m.

General HUMPHREYS, Chief of Staff:

Received your dispatch of 5.30 o'clock. I have Robinson's two brigades and Stevenson's command. I shall do the best with what I have without asking for re-enforcements, except in case I can advantageously use them. I do not know that I shall require any.

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General, Commanding.
