GENERAL: I am instructed to confer with Major-General Ord concerning a joint plan of operations between Turner's division and yours for the capture of the enemy's redoubt just north of the Crow house. I have not yet heard from General Ord, but from other source I learn that General Turner is erecting batteries on the north side of Hatcher's Run, by which he expects to get a reverse fire on the redoubt and enable you to assault it. You will please make careful examination and preparations for co-operating in every way with General Turner, and informme of the plan by which in your judgment the redoubt can be captured.+

Very respectfully,

[46.] A. A. HUMPHREYS.
