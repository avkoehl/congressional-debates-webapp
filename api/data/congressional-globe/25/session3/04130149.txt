public necessity, during the present condition of
the Tieasury—than from any convictions adverse
to the objects of the expedition. 1 bhoulu, in all
probability, have opposed ¡t m ¡ts incep'ion, yet I
<im fai from b mg satisfied that it la nota measure
ptegnant with important results, which rr ay be
alike creditable to the ration and beneficial to
commerce But that my constituents maybe able
to see and judge for themselves of the ment of the
interesting objects of this expedition, 1 will read
Irom the Register of Debates for December, 1834,
tht most condensed statement of them which I hj.ve
been able to find
" Among the petitions ami memorials presented to dav
was one by Mr Pearee, oí Kindt Islnd, ol J ihn \
Riynold" I ilelv lcturned from a vov ng of exploration in
the Pacific oiem and the nonhwtst cua t prajmg that an
expedition may be fitted out lo survi y the islands and ret la
in thlt ocean and on that coa t Tht pth ton was recom
mended by both brandies of the Legislature of Rhode
Island, and Mr P slated that the legislature of several
oilier Stales would join m the prayer of the memorial, as
would the merchants and chamber;, of comimrct in the
pnncipil cities in the Union lo show the importance of
lile olject in view, Mr P slated that tin re were now en
gigtd in tht what* fisl ery IJ2 000 toi s of shipping that
ill re were employed 10 OuO seamen, and lliat the business,
duect and indir et, empl )yed 170 000 tons of «hipping, and
nioie than P,O0J stamen, that mort than on tenlh part
of our whole u-ivioitiun was engaged m it, and the capita!
mvisted was $12,100,000 He further stited that the an
nual loss ot property upon the islands and reels not laid
<Iown upon any chart, was fully equal to the expense of
the expedition and survey requested "
Such were the commercial objects to be attained
by this measure     There were, bebides, other ob
ifcts of the greatest consequence to be attained,
growing out of an emulous and 1 tudab'e ambition
to advance the charactei of the nation, the icputa
tion ol our Navy, and the cause of science     But
what I  had  intended  to say in iert rente to this
sul ject is, that tLi s was a measure of which tí e
Opposition could not complain, for, aititou0h it is
ci  somewhat doubtfui origin, yet   ts claims to
[ atermty on the Opposition seem to have the bet
fi foundation     It is true that novóte evei taken
t pon it could be fairly said to be of a pai ty cnai
t cter, yet i s stiongest suppoit has been from the
Opposition ranks     Ihey are, therefoie, estopped
liom making an y complaint about the expenditure
tt has cost     The puricipal hopes of its success
¡re founded on a desire to piomote then dailmg
merest, that of commerce, of which they claim
lo be the exclusive friends, because the friends of
this Administration think that other interests de
leive equal encouragement     Upon recurring to
I he yeas and nayb on thefiist bill to bung forwaid
this measuie in lb2'l, we find among the yeas the
I ames of most of the leading Opposition members
i n this flior who were then in the House of Rep-
iesentatives     There are the names of the long
Mied veteran members froni Vugiiua, [Mr  Meu   '
i er and Mr  TiinrEKRO,] in company with the j
i ame of the gentleman fiom Philadelphia, [Mr   i
s>ERct.ANT,] and of the representative fro n Boston,
{Mi   Davis,] now a distinguished member of the I
other branch of Congress    and there is the name I
of that faithful sentinel from Massacnusetts, [Mr    I
Reed,] who is always at his pon on ti e watch
towei of commerce, guarding its various inteiests i
ps he wouid the apple of his eye    Why,sir, (said '|
Mr  M ,) the cause of commeite is to him what
sack was to Palstaff     It is his breaKfast, his dm- j
ner,and hi' supper    It is his meat and r-i-^ dunk,  j
he lives on it and sleeps on it     His con^ti uents |
are a commercial people, and well are they awre |
of the value of his services to the r favorite tntei
est     A proof of this is that trey have, I believe,
kept him in Congiess from time immemorial, as
1 have no recollection of ev er having i ead the j eas
and nays without seeing among them tt e name of
John Reec     But, then, I am  comparatively a
young man, and do not know whethei the ' mem-
< ry " of others around me " runneth to the con-
trary" or not     Be that aa it may, I can  bear
testimony to  the fact  that no  member deserves
more the confidence of his const 'uents than the
gentleman, tne politics, the pursuits, and position
of those wnom he represents considered
There is arotber item (said Mr ^1)1 must
not omit to examine It is that of £28,1.01 G44
depo i ed witl the States by the law of 183o
You may lie surprised tnat I notic  this maker
while speaking of expenditure, inasmuch as the
Government is not chargeable wi'h this item under
that head     That matter, however, is seldom con-
sidered by those whose business it is to make an
array   of  figures   against   the   Administration
Whether well founded or ill founded, is no mattpr
of concern to those who onl) calculate in referTce
to  the effect to be   produced      Gentlemen here,
when speaking of extravagant experditures,never
speak of i olated items which compose the aggre
gate amount      fney are like the gemleman from
New York, [Mr  Clark,] when speaking in ret-
eience to another subject  iney never "descend
to particulars, they deal in generalities "    They
will tell you of all the money that has come into
the Treasury, and then e« aim, " where is it "
Whethei received as levenue, or expended as ap-
propriations proper  for  tre   public   sei vice,  the
people are not informed   Thus, our foreign itidem
mties from Trance, Dent'iaik, Spain, Naples, the
Sicilies, and Brazil, amounting to near §7,000,000,
which are received into the lreasury as a trust
fund for the citizens who own it, being so much
clear gain to the country, but belonging, neverthe-
less, to the injured citizens for whom it is obtained,
and not to the Government, are a'l included in the
gross amount of the Government receipts, ab if
part of theactual revenue     These trust funds, in-
cluding these indemnities, and including §1,390,000
received in  trust for Chickasaw Indians on the
sale of their lands in 1835-'36, and §1,200,000 on
the sale of their lands in 1836-'37, and invested
for their benefit, amounting altogether to nearly
ten millions of dollars, are included in the appio
pnation bills in order to invest it, or enable the
owneis to draw it from the l'reisury   and  then
it lb classed with the round numbers of appropri
ations, as part of the \iaslijal and piofligcttc exUai-
agance of the Administration     Another instance
of  this disingenuous  mode of attack winch we
have often witnc sed   even on  this flooi   is this
the most gorgeous description of the full and over
fiowing condifion of our Tieasury previous to the
late financial difficulties is followed with the rod
omontade, " What now is the condition of your
íesourees'   Youi  Tieasury bankrupt, unable to
meet the demands against it, and your Govern   [
ment in debt fiom a resort to the expedient of
Treasury noi.es "   Now, the answer to all this
is  most destiucuve to this fine apostrophe, and
casts back the reproacn intended foi otheis upon
those who make it, with a most signal estoppel to
the charge implied     The answer is, that theie
would have been no embariassment nor issue of
Treasury notes but for the deposit of 4,28,101,614
with the States, which was a most favorite measure ¡
with the Opposition, that of the money ordered
by the act of 1836 to be deposited with the States,
upwaids of £,9,000,000 was appropnated before I
the close of tne session at which the act of deposit
was [ as ed, which thtew tin  §9 000,000 upon the
subsequent revenues  of the Government, which
thereby became burdened with a pieexistmg deb
to  'hat amount     líbese appropnations, f r lm   I
pi ovements of rivers and harboi a, i oads an 1 canals,
for light houses, fortifications, and for the rdief
of the corporate cities of the D strict of Columbia,
(the last item being §1 500 000,) weie supported
by most of the Opposition, and, theiefoie, they
have no right to say to the f lends of this Admin
titration,   ' you are aune íesponsibie "    That of
the public money in depos t with banks in 1837,
(a mode of deposit no v advocated oy the Oppo
sttt m,) we vverecjmpe led, for then relief, and fir
the relief of the countrv , to postpone of those de
posits*-irpayment to asubsequenf Lime $4 800 000,
vu   §2 40b 000 to July, 1838, and >2 400 U0d to
July, 1839, thereby {.lacing beyond oui reach the
money paid  by the people for the public service,
for the benefit of the most favorite institutions of
the political enemies of this Admm.stration     We
also postponed  the payment of moneys due on
unpaid duty bonds, amounting to §4,000,000 more
To  these  measjies  tne deficit 11 theTreasuiy,
which called forth tne issue of the Treasury notes,
is  alone attributable, so far aa concerns the dis
posal of the money by '1 e Government, and to
my own  knowledge, t' e Oipos  ion a¡e v. hoby
preclude 1 from oljec' rg to any one of the n
But tnere are oilier things raie'y told to the
people when tney tue lee u ed on tne suljCct of
the Government embarrassments The gnat de
cieasen the public revenue—a decrease ¡asviig
all precedent, and oou'd not have been anticif ateu
uy any—is seldom spoiten of or commented on
rhifc, it is supposed, belongs also to the credit
pait of the ncciunt. They are not told that the
imports of ISoS were §78 000,000 less 'han the
corresponding impoiu. of lb3G, that the f íoceeds
of public lands had t« leu fiom ¡¡,.24 877,000, re-
ceived in 1838, to $3,136 000 in 1837, .hat the
whole am mnt cf levenues proper in 1836 was
§4b,000 000, and araouiiul from customs and
lanus in 18J8, "ex 'u mg tne amounts received
from postponed bonus, which formed part of the
recemts of 1&J7," to only about $14,500,000.
Tell these, and all these things to the people, and
they will not be imposed upon by the humbug
epithets of "puolicdebt,' and " Tieasuiy em-
barrassmei t Ji
Xhus much I have thought proper (said Mr M )
to say in leference to this deposit oí §28,101,000
with the ¡states, not for the purpose of objecting
to the act that gave rise to it, or of showing that
it was objectionable as a measure at the time it
passpd, but for the purpose of showing that the
consequences resulting from it ought not to be laid
at the feet of the Administration by any party in
this country    I was myself m favor of this act
of deposit, not from choice, but from necessity
We had an miineiibe surplus m the Treasury, and
I was in favor of its deposit for tne purpose of
[ avoiding a much greater evil likely to grow out of
I its appropriation by Congiess     The people had.
paid this surplus to defray the charges of the pub-
lic service     The banks were employing it in the
most ruinous schemes of speculation    The people
j had paid it  for no such purpose     If left m the
' lieasury, it was likely to tempt Congiess into
| an inordinate and dangerous system of appropria-
tions,which wasdesuable to be avoided, and much
j to be deprecated     Upon pnnciple Í was opposed
to it, and am yet opposed to it     Next to a large
surplus 1  should most depiecate this system of
depositing money with the States, which  is but
another name for distribution    The surplus being
disposed of, the object of the law isaccomohshed,
and I snail oppose any further deposit by the pay-
ment of the four h  installment, heretoiore post-
poned     I shall advocate that system of revenue
which will hereaftei   bring no surptus  mío  the
Treasury      A  revenue commensurate with the
necessary wants of the Government is  all  that
should ever be raised by this Government     And
when I say t le neccssmtj 'Wants of the Govmiimsnl^
I do notmean a splendid system of improvements,
either of fortifications, of light houses, or for river
and coast navigation     To some of them I am
opposed altogether, and the others I would reduce
to a limited and  economical  establishment      I
have ever piotes'ed against the splendid and ex-
, tensive by stem of fortifications entered upon  by
I Congress during the redundancy of our Tieasury
means     A  few   necessary points,  well  fortified
and fitted up for the nhelter &nd protection of our
soldiers and seamen, and the pieservation of our
arms and n umttons of war, vvi'l be acknowledged
by all to be indispensable     But to line oui   ex-
tensive fiontier and coast with fortifications, to
mciease our armed esttbl shments of the Army
and Navy.ard to cost annual millions in future
to supply them  with  men  and  munitions, and
repair   then   dilapidations,  is  justifiable   on   no
ground vvhatevei, whether oui extensive territory,
the  genius and  charactei of oui  people,  or  the
sunt le  and  limited form of our Government, be
consulted       Nor   do   Í   believe   these   extensive
fortifications   to  be the best means of piefunig
our wide extended country for defense m time of
war     I approve much more of the policy of the
great Spartan lawgiver,  who ordained that his
I countrymen   should   not  make  walls  of wood,
' brick, or stone, for the defense of then city, as
was done by other cities of that day, but that the
j hearts and the courage of the citizens should de-
, fend  them with a wall of men     God forbid that
we should rely on fortifications and wooden walls
for the defense of this wide extended and mighty
nation     Whenever the pati otism and courage of
oui cituerib shall become u¡ eqja! to its defense,
then  u il  it not be woith defending     It seems
( aid V    Aí ) from the leport of the Committee
if Wajs anU ¡Vieai s, that the expenditure for
this e« abhshmei t " has increased f>-ori something
over <}100,0u0, uu ing the first years o*" the Gov-
etrmerH,  to  upwards of |1,000,000 annually "
The appropriation last year for tms purpose was
