Lieutenant H. W. PERKINS,

Actg. Asst. Adjt. General, Eleventh and Twelfth Corps:

CAPTAIN: I cannot think that it is absolutely necessary for us to live so completely from hand to mouth as we are now doing in this valley, so that every storm or other cause that intercepts the regularity of the boats occasions an entire want of rations and forage. We have suffered particularly for want of forage. Horses and mules are dying. Having no hay, an interruption in the supply of corn and oats, even reducing us to half rations only, results in the death of the animals. Our forage is not so very little, but is delivered to us with such irregularity that we are often without any. Everything can be remedied by allowing us an accumulation of eight or ten days' supply of both forage and rations.

Very respectfully,

O. O. HOWARD,

Major-General, Commanding.

NASHVILLE, January 5, 1864.

Major General U. S. GRANT,

Commanding Division:

Steam-boats are here with subsistence for Big South Fork. Are these stores for General Foster, and shall I send them on? If so, I must get a gun-boat as convoy. Two steamers have discharged their freight at Carthage; they remain here to go up. Shall I send them also? There are only 400 men at Carthage, and they do not know why supplies are sent there.

PRESIDENT UNITED STATES:

Major-General Foster has ordered all the organized forces in Kentucky to Knoxville. This will take the forces raised under act of Congress for defense of Kentucky and expose us to ruin.
