HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,March 30, 1865-10.30 p. m.

Major-General WRIGHT:

Your dispatch of 9.45 received. It is impossible to give you the time you seem to require before the orders for attack are sent. All information tends to show the enemy are massing all available troops on their right. It is positively known that one brigade (scales') has left your front, and reported that all of Wilcox's division has been withdrawn. i think sufficient is known to warrant the belief that for the present you are secure from attack, and I think you would be perfectly secure in leaving your lines to two divisions, as you did on the 25th, and massing your third division in the vicinity of the proposed point of attack, where it will be ready promptly to attack and will also be on hand to meet any offensive movement of the enemy. With one division to attack with you will have time to collect other troops to follow up any success gained.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS SIXTH ARMY CORPS,March 30, 1865-10.35 p. m.

General MEADE:

Your dispatch* transmitting that of General Warren's of 8.15 p. m. is just received. If so much of the force on my front has left, would it not be well for me to attack at daylight in the morning, according to the original programme? I believe I can go through the enemy's lines, and then, turning to our left, attack the enemy in flank while he is occupied by the attack in front by the Second and Fifth Corps; corresponding movement should, of course, be made by the Ninth Corps and General Ord's command on my left. My division and brigade commanders fully understand what is to be done, and, if your orders can reach me promptly, I can be ready to start the assaulting columns at early daylight. This is indispensable to the success of the movement. We must get the troops in position before daylight; if we do, we will be almost sure of success. On carrying his line we will turn to the left and sweep down on his flank while the other corps are attacking in front.

H. G. WRIGHT,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS SIXTH ARMY CORPS,March 30, 1865-11.07 p. m.

General WEBB:

Deserters just in from Scales' brigade know nothing of any movements of that brigade, but as they were not relieved this morning, as they expected, and from the accounts they give of their different regiments, it seems probable that the statements made to General Warren are true and that a part of the brigade may have been withdrawn from my front last night. General Scales is said to be absent sick.

H. G. WRIGHT,

Major-General.
