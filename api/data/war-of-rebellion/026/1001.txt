[Major General D. H. HILL:]

GENERAL: I shall move with all the haste possible, but no route was indicated, and I have to make inquiries about the best route, arrange about rations, &amp;c. I am ignorant of the country and where supplies could be obtained if I left with an insufficient quantity. My supply train was at Pactolus when I got your order, and that could only rejoin me late this afternoon. With many kind wishes for your success,

I am, general, very respectfully, your most obedient servant,

R. B. GARNETT,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS, April 19, 1863.

Major General S. G. FRENCH, Commanding, &c.:

GENERAL: The two guns from Powhatan have not yet arrived. I am expecting to hear of their arrival at Smithfield every hour. I do not know if they had not better be placed near Smithfield, on the James, to prevent transports passing up, should the enemy take a notion to send troops from the Army of the Potomac. Turn the whole matter over in your mind and let me know what you think best.

Most respectfully,JAMES LONGSTREET,

Lieutenant-General, Commanding.

GENERAL: Your not and inclosure are received. Please let me know the result of the furious cannonade now going on as soon as you learn. Have you the regiment of infantry so placed as to support the batteries in time should the enemy attempt to land an infantry force against them? I have ordered more ammunition for the large guns.

Most respectfully,

JAMES LONGSTREET,

Lieutenant-General, Commanding.

Please order the gunners of Captain [D. L. Smoot's [Alexandria Light Artillery, Va.] to fire with great deliberation and care.
