HEADQUARTERS SIEGE ARTILLERY,June 21, 1864-4.45 p. m.

Captain A. MORDECAI,

Headquarters General Butler:

I will want the three 4 1/2-inch guns and the two 12-pounder howitzers and the 20-pounder Parrot to-morrow. I hope you can send me the three 4 1/2-inch guns as I have not enough transportation; the rest I will bring up myself. Please hurry forward the 30-pounder Parrot ammunition; I am getting very short. The wretched Shenkl stuff is throwing discredit on my gunners, and the Hotchkiss I will not use except as a last resort.
