flank of the One hundred and fourteenth New York Volunteers. I immediately ordered the Twenty-ninth Maine Infantry, under Colonel Beal, to move so as to clear the left flank of this regiment from annoyance, and I directed the One hundred and sixty-first New York Volunteers, Lieutenant-Colonel Kinsey, to move in column of companies upon the road to clear it of the enemy, if necessary with the bayonet. This movement was executed with promptness. The officers, and particularly Lieutenant-Colonel Kinsey, who commanded, are deserving of especial praise and mention. At this time this brigade was entirely surrounded by the enemy with the exception of the ravine on its right, and balls were falling into its position from all direction-a most trying position for the soldiers of this brigade, and one which fully attests their steadfastness and devotion. Having cautioned the three regiments, viz, One hundred and fourteenth New York Volunteers, One hundred and sixteenth New York Volunteers, and One hundred and fifty-third New York Volunteers, which were in position, to remain firm, and on no account to give way in the least or to retire, I afterward moved the Twenty-ninth Maine Volunteers and One hundred and sixty-first New York Volunteers in such a manner as to protect the flanks of the other regiments and the right of the army. These movements were made under the eye, and for the most part under the immediate direction, of the brigadier-general commanding the division. Neither of these regiments did much firing, but the attacks upon the three other regiments were incessant, and their fire was constantly maintained until darkness put an end to the battle. The attacks of the enemy upon the position of this brigade continued to the end, and showed the enemy to be in force near my position up to the time when all firing ceased. In their movements and entire conduct during this day, the regiments of this brigade were steady and extremely well behaved, while the fire of the three regiments that remained in position could not have been improved.

I would call especial attention to the One hundred and fifty-third New York Volunteers, which on this occasion made its first appearance on a battle-field. The officers and soldiers of this command have received my thanks for their conduct on these two trying occasions. My thanks are due to the members of my staff, Captain Oliver Matthews, assistant adjutant-general; Captain Chitty, acting assistant inspector-general; Lieutenant D. C. Payne, aide-de-camp; Lieutenant S. S. Fairchild, aide-de-camp; Lieutenant Fillebrown, ordnance officer, and Lieutenant S. W. Phinney, provost-marshal, for the faithful and gallant manner in which they performed all their duties. The efficiency of Captain Oliver Matthews is especially worthy of attention. I was immediately accompanied during both battles by my brother, Mr. D. A. Dwight, who rendered me much efficient service. I would most respectfully call the attention of the brigadier-general commanding the division to Colonel Beal, of the Twenty-ninth Maine Volunteers, and to his peculiar fitness for a higher command. I inclose a list of casualties.* This brigade retired from Pleasant Hill to this point with the main body of the army.

I have the honor to be, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WILLIAM DWIGHT,

Brigadier-General, Commanding Brigade.

Captain DUNCAN S. WALKER,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
