NEW YORK CUSTOM HOUSE INVESTIGATION
Mr ROOSEVELT said he róselo make a privileged motion
He had voted for the printing of the report of the Committee
on Public Expenditures, made this morning, m relation to the
New York custom house, under the idea that it was the result
of the investigations of the committee itself Other membeis
informed him they had vo^ed under the same impression On
looking into the document, which was very voluminous, he
found that, instead of being the work of the committee, it was
the report of Mr Pomdexier, one of the commissioners appoint
ed by the President, and was made, not to the House, but to the
President He would not insist on the disposition of the mo-
tion at this moment, but, as he wished a little time to look mto
the matter before printing, he merely desired that the motion
should be entered o-i thejoumal, that he might call it up here
aftei
The SPEAKER   There was no division on that question
Mi ROOoEVELT I know theie was no division, but I
gavt. my assent to the motion^ and suppose, therefore, that I
haveanghi to move a reconsideration
The SPEAKER The motion is not in order No division
was had, and it is not in the power of the Chair to determine,
when there was no division, whether the gentleman voted in
the affirmative or not
Mi WELLER But the gentleman himself spates that he
voted in theathrmative
The SPEAKER There is no case wherea motion to recon
sider has been entertained under such circumstances
Mr BRIGGS called for the question on the motion of Mr
Everett
Mr ROOSEVELT said he «ould appeal fiom the decision
of the Speaker
The SPEAKER said the appeal would not be in order, as
there was a motion pending to go into committee
Mr STANLY suggested that the further consideration of the
bill to prevent the tranpoortation of letters and papers coastwise
in foreign steamers had been postponed until this day
The SPEA KER said the motion of the gentleman from Vei
mont[Mi  Everett) had the priority
Mr STANLY said he hi ped it would be voteddown, in order
that the House might take up and dispose of the bill to which
he had referred
The question was then taken on the motion oi Mr. Eev
rett, and, by ayes 83, noes not counted, it was deciden in the
affirmative                                                         v       /
APPORTIONMENT BILL \     ,
So the House resolved itself into Committees of the Whole
on the state of the Union, (Mr Alien of Mainehof the chair,)
and resumed the consideration of the bill for the apportionment
of Repiesentatives among the several States, artording to the
sixth census                                                           }
When the committee rose last evening, the stale of the ques
Hon was as follows
Mr Halsted, from the Committee of Elections, had moved
to amend the bill by adding the following as section 2
And be tí fui thsr enaclpd '1 hat each State shall be divided
by the Legislature thereof into as many districts, composed of
contiguous territory, as shall be equal to the number cf Repre
sentatives to which said State may be entitled in the House of
Representatives of the Consrtss of the United States, and that
each of the said districts shall elect one Representative
To which amendmentMr Campbell, of South Carolina, had
moved the following amendment
That in every case where a State is entitled to more than one
Representative, the number to which each State shall oe en
tied under this appoi uonment, shall be elected by districts com
posed of contiguous-territory, equal in number to the number of
Representatives to which said State may be entitled, no one dis
trict electing more than one Representative
Which said amendment Mr Halsted had, on behalf of the
Committee ol Elections (as the reporter understood,; accept
ed asa modification of the amendment reported from that com
mittee
Mr Colq-uttt had then moved to amend the amendment, by
excepting from the operation thereof the State of Geergia
And the question pending was on the amendment to the
amendment
Mr KENNEDY, of Indiana, who was entitled to the floor,
resumed his remarks commenced yesterday, but there was so
much noise and confusion in the hall and particulaily in the
alcove in the rear of the reporters' desks, that it was some con
siderable time before the reporter could catch a word When
order was somewhat restored, he (Mr K ) was understood to say
he would propound a question to the committee Under the Con
stltution of the United States, Congress had the power to organ
lze the militia, the States exeicise the right, till Congress ehall
take the matter into its own hands now, he asked if Corgress
could lake the matter m hand, and order the States to organize
their militia in a «ertain manner' Should Congress do so,
what would be the answei of the States'* They would give the
same answer that they would give should Congiess order them
to do the act required by this amendment They would say, If
you believe the thing to be right and necessaiy do it yourself,
but do not undertake to order us to do it Whatever power
this Goveipment exercises, it must exercise it itself, it cannot
ordei the States to exeicise it If Congress should undertake,
not only to interfere with the internal relations of the Sta'es but
to command and enforce the States to do certain ack, the Fed
eral and State Governments would inevitably come in conflict,
which could not happen without crippling, to a certain extent,
the tormer, and strengthening the latter He, therefore, admon
ished all those friendly to the powers of the federal Govein
mem not to permit it to come into confliu with the States, in
which it must inevitably suffer Mr K held that the State
Legislatures, and then members, were as independent as this
House and its members They were not s'aves, and would re
volt at any unauthorized assumption of power over them
The gen'leman from Kentucky [Mi Davis] admitted that,
when this idea was first started by his colleague, [Mr Under
•wood lit had great plausibility, but thought that it was de
sfroyed by the words giving Congress the powei to alter the
districts of the States Non, for his part he (Mr K ) did not
see any force m this objection, for if it did give Congress
that powei, it did not give the power to command the States to
do it All that it did was to give Congress the power to make
the districts itself, or to alter those made by the States Though
Congress might do the act, it could not order the States to do it,
it could not order the State of Indiana to take part of his Con
gressional district, and add it to that of his colleague   He was
one of those who did not believe one word of themherent right 
or implied powers of this Government We are, said he, only
trustees, we are not acting on our own rights, we are not prin-
cipals, we have trusts delegated to us, and those trusts we must
fulfil eurselves, for there is no principle in law better settled
than that a trustee cannot delegate his trust to another The
position of the gentleman from Kentucky [Mr Undeewoob]
was clear and undeniable, that if Congress had the right, under
the Constitution, to district the States, yet it had no such power
given to i> to command the States to do it It was madness to
tell the State Governments that they are bound by the acts of
this Government. He recollected the attempt that was made
to compel the State of Georgia to do a certain act. She was or-
dered to turn loose a murderer, and ehe set the General Gov-
ernment at defiance and hung the man There never wa  a
mandate issued by this Government to any of the States that
was not treated with scoin and contempt, and this Government
fell in the conflict Mr K said he was in favor, as he had before
remarked, of the district system He believed it to be the best, but
if there was any one thing that would make him give it up, and go
for the general ticket system, it would be the attempt on the part
of this Government to contiol his State Something had been
said in the coutse of the d'scussion about State rights He never
was a professor of the doctrine, and did not pretend to know
exactly what it was The gentleman fiom Virgiria[Mr
SümmeesI said that the amendment was so consistent with
State rights doctrines, that he was astonished that any State
riah^ man should resist it He accounted for this, as our
Saviour did for the perverseness of the Jews, by saymg that
they did not know wh t 'hey did Now, he would tell the gen
leman that if this was Sta.e rights doctrine, he was against it
What he understood State rights to be was a strict adherence
to the Constitution, resistance to all usurpations on the part of
the Fedeial Government, and keepirg bo'h the Federaland
State Governments within their proper sphere Now, he
would ask the State rights men what could be more offensive
to the States than foi Congiess to go into them and cut them
up into districts, and then tell Xhem that it was done in p irsu
anee of Sta'e rights 1 The gentleman from South Carolina
said, that at ihe other end of the Capitol the Stales were repre-
sented, andthat in this end of the Capitol the mass of the Amer-
ican people were represented Now, he denie 1 this doctrine tolo
cmh He denied that there was any such thing in this Government
as one branch of the Legislature representing the American peo-
ple m gross He denied the doctrine, and could prove its falsity
hy a test that could not be controverted Why was there no
such thing as the repi esentation of fractions m that House? Why
don't you put your fractions togethei—the frac ions of Indiana
and the fiactions of Illinois, and let them send a Representative!
for this could be done, it this branch of the Legislature repre.
sented the American people in gross He denied, then, that
this House represented the mas  of the American people, and
for the best reason in the world—that it was not a consolidated
Government, and the very moment such a representation was
attempted, the State lines would he wiped out, and a consoli-
dated Government established Mr K then went onto show
the evils that would result from any interference with the in
ternal concerns of the States in the manner contemplated by the
amendment commented on the extreme hazard ol the under-
takine demonstiated its unconstitutionality, and finally showed
that a continuance of sjch usurpations on the part of this
Government would end in the destruction of the Union
Mi PAYNL said he regarded this question as one of vital
importance, and therefore he desired to give the reasons by
which he was influenced in or posing the proposition now before
the commutee, and he should not occupv more time than was
absolutely necessary topresent his views to the consideration of
the committee He alluded to the amendment proposed by the
gentleman from South Caioltna, [Mr Campbell] and that
amendment proposed to do—what* To direct the respective Le-
gislatures of the States of this Union to district their States
Now, he asl ed what authority this House had to make such an
oider or requisition on those Legislatures1 In looking over the
instrument wmch rules and guides, as it called into exist,
ence this body, he saw no hmg m the slightest degree justifying
the amendment Though, in making this declaration, he did not
intend to deny to Congress the power to prescribe the time,
place, and mannei of holding the elections, yet he denied that
Congress was authorized to issue such an order, and he gave it
as his opinion, that it would be absurd in Congress to issuesuch
a requisition Why was it absurd? Because there was not a
State m the Union that woald not tieat it with contempt, and
with the contempt which it merits What' order them to do
wha' they did not choose to do' Go mto the States and inter
fere with their internal policy1 It was idle to do so The
States would not obey, and what wou7d be the consequences of
failure to obey an order which Congress might choose to give?
Take Georgia, for instance, which elects under the general
ticket system, one of her members there said she would be sure
to disobey—and why? Because it was her favorite policy, on
which she had always acted, with the exception of one single
election for members of f'ongiess And what wasthe result of
hei change then? Why, they were told that the next Legisla-
tuie repealed the law, and all subsequent elections were con-
ducted accoiding to her favorite principle Aeam, take New
Hampshire, and would she do if She would pay not the
slightest attention to any such requisition which they might
make, but she would continue under the genera] ticket system
as heretofore Her membeis would come here to the next Con-
eress, and they would he compelled to admit them oi—what?
Ei pel them as not qualified, and thus ensui e a collision between
the State and the Federal Government And did any gentle-
man wish to see such a collision? Might he point to a case, m
which it had occurred? and had they not seen the lightning of in
dignation flashing across this Hall, and did not every patnotap
prthend disastrous consequences there? It was the object of
everv patriot to guard against such results, by opposing himself
to has'y, inconsistent absurd legislation, which would bnn 
t'iem about                                                                                   °
But he must be permit'ed to go further, and to say that this
miehtbe put forth but as a feeler to catch the public sentiment,
P'eparatory to a more important step to be taken He gave
that as his opinion, for he could not believe that any considera-
ble portion of that House could seriously favor a proposition so
absurd, but if it was a feeler to pave the way for a great que .
Hon which was behind—the districting of the States by this body
—then would eome a question that would require not only the
grave deliberation of this House, but of the whole people ateo
And here he might be led to inquire into the power of this Gov
ernment to adopt that course For himself, he did notbelieve It
existed; and whatever opinion he held he was not afBud to <S|
