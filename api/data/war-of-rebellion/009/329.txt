ments on Joy's Creek, about 2 miles in his rear, and called in Lieutenant-Colonel Reid's and Major Lee's commands, and there awaited the enemy, who it appears were so badly that they made no advance, but at about 8 p. m. began to retreat to their boats. At this time I am informed that several companies of the Thirty-second North Carolina Regiment joined Colonel Wright, who during the night retired from this position to the Northwest Lock.

Colonel Wright states his loss at 6 killed, 19 wounded, and 3 taken prisoners. The enemy's loss he estimates as very large, as high as 300. Colonel Wright states that the regiments opposed to him were the Ninth, Twenty-first, and Eighty-ninth New York, and the Twenty-first Massachusetts, Sixth New Hampshire, and Fifty-first Pennsylvania Regiments (we have prisoners or wounded of five of these regiments), the whole commanded by Brigadier-General Reno Among the killed he is grieved to Announce the loss of Captain McComas, an estimable gentleman and brave and skillful officer, whose conduct throughout the action elicited the highest praise.

All the command engaged behaved in the most gallant manner, standing firmly against overwhelming odds until ordered to fall back to our intrenchments. They maintained their position over five hours, and killed and disabled more of the enemy than we had in action.

On returning to the field next day we recovered 1,100 pounds of powder, and the arms, accouterments, tools, &amp;c., left by the enemy. I have already reported his leaving such wounded as he could not remove, and I have sent them to Fort Monroe on parole. Some 10 or 12 stragglers were taken on the 20th and held as prisoners of war. I will forward the original reports as soon as they are corrected, and meanwhile submit this as a summary.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

BENJ. HUGER,

Major-General, Commanding.

General R. E. LEE, Commanding, &c.
