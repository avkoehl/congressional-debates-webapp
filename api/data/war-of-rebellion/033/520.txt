I send this by Major [Daniel J.] Benner, of my staff, too insure a quick return. Give him your views in full.

If you can turn Bayou Meto to the north and west, perhaps it is best to try it, as you already have a base on White River, and the Arkansas is unnavigable.

Yours, truly,

S. A. HURLBUT,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS SIXTEENTH ARMY CORPS,September 9, 1863.

Brigadier General JOHN A. RAWLINS,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

GENERAL: I send a copy* of General Steele's last communication. You will perceive he recommends change of base to the Mississippi at Napoleon. If this meets the views of the major-general commanding, I would respectfully recommend that the division just returned from Monroe be ordered up to Napoleon, to communicate with Steele, moving either on Pine Bluff or such other point as he may direct.

Your obedient servant,

S. A. HURLBUT,

Major-General.

LEAVENWORTH, KANS., September 9, 1863.

Major General JOHN M. SCHOFIELD,

Commanding Department of the Missouri:

SIR: Great alarm exists in the city of Leavenworth for the safety of the lives and property of the town. Therefore we respectfully, but earnestly, ask that you cause to be stationed at or near the city of Leavenworth, six companies of cavalry and infantry, to guard against the attack of Quantrill or his band, and thereby restore confidence again in this community and in the department, to give that protection that the citizens of the city have a right to expect.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

THOMAS CARNEY,

Governor of Kansas.

D. R. ANTHONY,

Mayor.

[Indorsement.]
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE MISSOURI,Saint Louis, Mo., September 12, 1863.

Respectfully referred to General Ewing. Though there seems no military necessity for troops at Leavenworth City, I think it would be wise to station a small force for the purpose of restoring confidence to the people.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.
