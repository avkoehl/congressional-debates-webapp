Pherson succeed in breaking through or we have yet to resort to a flank movement, I believe Cox's present position far more valuable than any he can gain by moving toward the railroad.

General SCHOFIELD:

Don't's detach Cox any farther. If possible press Hascall forward, exposing skirmishers only. I will await the result of Thomas' movement. What does the large smoke in your front mean!

Major- General SHERMAN:

Hascall's skirmishers have driven the enemy into their works, and are so close upon them that they get a volley from he enemy's line every time they stir. The smoke in my front arises from burning leaves between Hascall's line and the enemy, ignited by the artillery. Cox will hold firmly what he has gained.

General SCHOFIELD:

Let Cox secure well the crossing of Olley's Creek on the Sandtown road, and take all advantage of that flank should we move in that direction; otherwise hold fast all you have, and remain on the defensive.

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE OHIO,June 27, 1864-7 p. m.

Major- General SHERMAN:

General Cox's position overlooks the Nickajack Valley and seems to control the ridge between the two creeks, so that the enemy cannot extend his line along that ride without displacing us. It threatens the enemy's left rear and seems to me more important than I at first supposed. I think it should be held by my whole force if you propose to operate in that direction.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major- General.
