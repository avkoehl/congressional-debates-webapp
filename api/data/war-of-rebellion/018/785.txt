[Brigadier-General.]

WASHINGTON, D. C., September 1, 1862.

Major-General POPE, via Fairfax Court-House, Va.:

If the enemy moves as your last telegram indicates, and you engage him to-day without a decisive victory, I suggest a gradual drawing in of your army to Fairfax Court-House, Annandale, or, if necessary, farther south, toward Alexandria.

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF VIRGINIA,Camp near Centreville, September 1, 1862.

Major-General McDOWELL:

Please inform me precisely what movement of King's division you are making. None of our troops, I think, should for the present go beyond Fairfax Court-House. Sumner makes a reconnaissance due north from Centreville, across Little River turnpike and beyond.

JNO. POPE,

Major-General, Commanding.

CENTREVILLE, September 1, 1862-12 m.

Major-General McDOWELL:

You will march rapidly back to Fairfax Court-House with your whole division, assume command of the two brigades now there, and immediately occupy Germantown with your force, so as to cover the turnpike from this place to Alexandria. Jackson is reported advancing on Fairfax with 20,000 men. Move quickly.

JNO. POPE,

Major-General, Commanding.

NEAR CENTREVILLE, September 1, 1862-4 p.m.

Major-General McDOWELL:

If you hear a battle raging to-night near Centreville advance to the north, keeping your communication open with Reno and near to him; also by the right with Hooker, who will advance his left to your right.

By command of Major-General Pope:

GEO. D. RUGGLES,

Colonel and Chief of Staff.
