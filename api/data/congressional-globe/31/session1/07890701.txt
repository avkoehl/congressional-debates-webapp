IN SENATE.
Thursday, Jipril 11, 1850.
Mr. DAVIS, of Massachusetts, rose as soon as
Si the Journal had been read, and called the attention
'! of the Senate to the fact, that in the deficiency
bill an amendment had foeen made to extend the
time allowed to marshals to make their returns to
the Executive Department to the 1st of November,
but that other parts of the bill, which required
alterations to make them conform to that provision,
remained as originally prepared. He asked the
unanimous consent of the Senate to make such
amendments in this respect as were obviously ne-
cessary. Leave was granted.
MEMORIALS AND PETITIONS.
Mr. HAMLIN presented a petition of citizens
of Waldo, in the State of Maine, asking a reduction
of the rates of postage to two cents on all letters
prepaid that do not exceed half an ounce in weight;
which was referred to the Committee on the Post
Office and Post Roads.
Mr. BRIGHT presented the memorial of George
Ketcham anff eighty-four other citizens of Indiana,
â  who were officers and soldiers in the last war wjth
i Great Britain, ashing bounty land for their serv-
ices.
Mr. DAVIS, of Mississippi, presented a memo-
rial of Brevet Col. J. F. K. Mansfield, of the United
States Engineers, for the settlement of his public
accounts as disbursing agent of the Government,
while superintending the construction of certain
public works; which was referred to the Commit-
tee on Military Affairs.
Also, a petition of citizens of the State of Mis-
sissippi, remonstrating against the further exten-
sion of Woodworth's patent for a planing ma-
chine; which was refeired to the Committee on
Patents and the Patent Office.
Mr. PEARCE submitted additional documents
relating to the claim of James Wilson, surviving
partner of William Wilson and Sons. He said that
the committee to which the memorial in this case
was referred had made an adverse report thereon;
he therefore moved the recommittal of that memo-
rial, and that these additional papers be referred to
the same committee. The motion was agreed to.
Mr. BELL. I present the memorial of Joseph
By rd, which sets forth that, in acting as a piivate sol-
dier in Fioridaagainstthe Creek Indians, in the war
of 1814, during the war with Great Britain, while
out as a scout, belonging to a company of spies, he
came upon a prize which was in possession of a
British schoonerâa quantity of merchandise. The
crew of the schooner, supposing him to be at-
tended by a larger company, weighed anchor and
left a portion of the goods on the shoie. They
were chiefly goods designed for Indian consump-
tion, and were taken into camp, and finally dis-
tributed among the troops stationed there at that
time. The petitioner prays that he may be al-
lowed a compensation I do not know the value
of thegoods thus taken. 1 do not know the amount
he claims. I think this should go to the Com-
mittee on Military Affairs, and 1 move that it be
referred to that committee.
The reference was agreed to.
Mr. DOUGLAS. I present a memorial of the
citizens of the United States lesidtng in the valley
of the northwestern lakes, asking the adoption of
measures for acquiring the right to the free navi-
gation of the St. Lawrence. The memorial seta
out with a very-well written representation that the
business and commerce upon the northern lakea
has increased to such an extent that the present
outlets to the ocean are incapable of furnishing the
requisite means of transportationâthat the New
York canals are now so crosvded beyond their ca-
pacity, that the effect is not only to delay but to
create great uncertainty whether contracts for de-
livery can be complied with. They represent this
as a growing evil, and as a serious tax upon the
whole northwestern portion of our countiy, and
I lnctecismg to such an extent that some other mode
i of transportation must be provided. They set
i forth the fact that ^8,000,000 have been vested in
' vessels upon these lakes, and that of this $8 000,-
! 000, at least Â§2,000,000 are vested in vessels well
| adapted to the navigation of the ocean; and that
1 they lie idle five months in the year in conse-
quence of the ice. Jf they could secure the free
navigation of the St. Lawrence, they could be
used throughout the year, either on the lakes or
on the ocean. They set out with a great variety
of facts; and they conclude with the prayer, that
Congress will take such steps as will secure this
free navigation. I ask that the memottal be re-
ferred to the Committee on Commerceâthat being
the committee to which the bill, which I had the
honor to present a few days ago, was referred;
and I ask the early attention of the Committee on
Commerce to that bill. 1 was in hopes it could
