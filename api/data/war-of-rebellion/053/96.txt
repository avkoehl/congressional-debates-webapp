Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

I have just received a request from General Rosecrans that I at once proceed to the execution of the first of the three plans submitted to you. Shall it be done? You will remember that it involves the abandonment of East Tennessee, and that we have issued 5,000 stand of arms to companies in this part of the State. I am ready to do it immediately if ordered. Please answer immediately.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.

KNOXVILLE, October 4, 1863.

General ROSECRANS,

Chattanooga:

Is there any truth in the crossing of the enemy's cavalry at Cotton Port, which you reported?

BURNSIDE.

CUMBERLAND GAP, October 4, 1863.

General BURNSIDE:

Scouting party returned from Mulberry Gap. The enemy retreated through the gap toward Jonesville yesterday. The force estimated at Jonesville is 600 and upward. The Mulberry Gap and Sneedville road to Rogersville is reported impracticable for wagons and artillery. I can get to the gap, but from Sneedville my informant says it is desperate and can't be done. The Jonesville and Estillville road to Bristol is reported practicable. The party struck across to the Jonesville road and returned that way. The squadron from Wheeler's cavalry had just passed in pursuit of 5 rebels. I am led to believe that the rebels in this vicinity have been parts of companies made up about here, and came to run off their property and stock, and other plunder.

WILLCOX,

Brigadier-General.

ATHENS, October 4, 1863.

General BURNSIDE:

I have dispatched by courier, but for fear that it has not reached you, send the following telegram:

The officer in command of the scouts last night returned from Cotton Port, capturing 1 rebel prisoner. He has reliable information
