his command had just arrived when it advanced to the attack. He says Gillmore is certainly here, that he saw him himself, and that only a brigade of negroes and some cavalry were left on the south side. Prisoners taken by some men of Heth's yesterday say that their loss was heavy on that flank. My headquarters will be at Nance's, about 200 yards north of Mechanicsville road and from a quarter to a half mile from Turner's. General Field is at latter place.

GENERAL: As before stated, the enemy is in my front, nor is he in the front of General Field or the left of Pickett's line. I have advanced skirmishers along in front of our lines across the enemy's until they are in front of Pickett's corps. A line of skirmishers have been found running back, as far as I can judge, across from some point on Pickett's line to the Mattadequin or beyond it in the direction of Raleigh's or Old Church. Sheridan's cavalry is reported by prisoners to be north of the Totopotomoy. Certianly cavalry is reported by prisoners to be north of the Totopotomoy. Certainly cavalry was on that side late last evening. My troops are between Bethesda and Pickett's left, in front of Field's left, with one division thrown across perpendicular to our lines. As the last message from you stated that no movement is reported to our right, it has occurred to me that perhaps the enemy has moved back his right to induce us to uncover the Mechanicsville road, and I do not deem it prudent, therefore, to advance farther until I ascertain something definite of the enemy's movements, which I am endeavoring to do. The country in front of our line is very rough and difficult, and rendered more so by an intricate system of works made by the enemy. I see as yet no road along the rear of the enemy's lines on which artillery or wagons have been heard.

Respectfully,

J. A. EARLY,

Major-General.

[P. S.]-I have heard nothing from Hampton for two days. He would be of great assistance to me now.

GENERAL: I have ascertained very closely, I think, that the enemy's infantry is moving to your right. Warren's corps, the last which left, passed to the rear by Allen's Mill. The enemy have a line running from about the middle of General Anderson's line across the Mattadequin, east of Barton's house, and our skirmishers are across the Mattadequin, east of Barton's house, and our skirmishers are across the creek at Barton's. I am going to try and strike at the enemy on the other side of Mattadequin and run down Beulah Church. The movement will be a difficult one, as I find the enemy has everywhere the most intricate system of breast-works, facing every way and making a
