The resolution was then adopted.
Mr. FILLMORE called up the Indian appro-
priation bill, which was on its third reading.
No objection having been made,
Mr. GWIN said he had an additional section
which he wished to be inverted by general consent.
It was read, as follows:
And be it further enacted, That no portion of the money
herein appropriated shall be drawn from the treasury except
upon warrant, «¡«tied by the Secretary of War, and counter
jsigned by the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, and each war
tant shall specify on its face the item ol expenditure named m
Ibisact that It is intended to meet, and the money thus drawn
shall be used only forthe puiposesnamedm the warrant, and
All balances of appropriations heretofore made, and remaining
unexpended, shall be forthwith paid into the treasuiy of the
United States, and shall not be withdrawn therefrom, except in
Aho manner herein presrubed
Mr. FILLMORE objected to the amendment,
inasmuch as it proposed a change in the legisla-
tion on the subject.
Mr. GWIN then said he must move a recom-
mitment ot the bill to the Committee ot the Whole
on the state_ptihe- U w  , wuh instructions to add
thcíBíTion which he had drawirTjTrr--"Ew*iU-WL
come into the House from the committee rather
hastily, and he thought the abuses in the Indian
department required reform.
After a brief conversational débale between
Messrs FILLMORE, THOMPSON of Indiana,
and COOPER of Pennsylvania,
Mr. McKAY addressed the House at considera
ble length. In the course of his speech, he was
interrupted by the appearance of John Tyler, jr.
esq , below the bar, with a message fiom the Presi-
dent of the United States
There were loud cries of "Read it," but other
gentlemen desired the business before ihe House to
he proceeded with, and Mr. McKay continued.
Mr. GILMER, after some remarks, offered the
following as a modification of the amendment, with
the view ot making the clause prospective in i s
operation:
And be if furth'r enacted, That all appropriations for the
currentand contingent expenses of the Indian Department, and
/or fulfilling treaty stipulations with the Indian tribes, which
shall remain unexpended for two years, or which shall here
after remain unexpended for two years, shall be paid into the
ireasury, to the credit of the surplus fund
Mr. GWiN having accep ed the modification—
Mr CAVE JOHNSON made some remarks in
opposition to the provision of $300,000 for paying
the debts of the Miami Indians, wlueh, he said,
■would be productive of a great deal of fraud, prac-
tised by designing persons, and suggested the re-
cowasitraent of the bill, with the view of striking
0«te ^ tJjKOTrision.
Mr, GRAHAM, after some remarks, offered a
further modification of the amendment, by inseit-
mg the wolds "excepting the Cherokee /imd," which
modification was also accepted.
After some remarks from Mr. THOMPSON c f
Indiana, he concluded by moving the previous
question; which was seconded, and the mam ques-
tion ordered
Mr. GWIN called for the yeas and nays, which
were ordered; and,
The question being taken on the passage of the
bill, resulted in }eas 114, nays 84, viz-

Mr. CUSH1NG then suggested that Ihe House
proceed to consider the message of the President,
and, no objection having been made, ihe Clerk
read the message, as follows:
To the House of Representatives :
I return Ihe bill which originated in the House
of Representatives, entitled " An aet to extend, for
a limited pentd, the present laws for laying and
collecting duties on imports," with ihe following
objections :
It suspends—in other words, abrogates for the
time—the provision of the act of 1833, common-
ly called the ' compromise act" The only
ground on which ihii departure from ihe solemn
adjustment of a great and agualing questiqnseems
-i¿*-rj&iE£_hean.j:f'gtti,*U<i-uu warjidimiiTls tnfe  alleged"
necessity of establishing, by legislative enactments,
rules; and regulations for assessing the duties to
be levied on imports, after the 30th June, accord-
ing to ihe home valuation , and yet the bill ex-
pressly provides that "if, before the l t of August,
there be no further legislation upon ihe subject,
the laws for laying and collecting duties shall be
the same as though this act had not been passed "
In other words that the act of 1833, imperfect as
it is considered, shall in that case continue to be,
and to be executed, under such rules and regula-
tions as previous statutes had prescribed, or had
enabled the Executive Department to prescribe for
that purpose, leaving the supposed chasm in the
revenue laws such sa it was before.
I am certainly far from being disposed to deny
that additional legislation upon the subject is very
desirable, on the contrary, the necessity, as well as
difficulties, of establishing uniformity in the ap-
praisements to be made in conformity with the true
intention of that act, was brought 10 the notice of
Congress in my message to Congress at the open-
ing of its present session. But however sensib'e I
may be of the embarrassments to wh ch the Execu-
tive, in the absence of all aid from the superior
wisdom of the Legislature, will be liable, in the
enforcement of the existing laws, I have not, w nh
the smcerest wish to acquiesce in its expressed will,
been able to persuade myself that the exigency of
the occasion is so great as to justify me m signing
the bill in question, with my present views of its
character and effects,   The existing laws, as I am
advised, are sufficient to authorize and enable the
collecting officers, under the directioni of theSecre-
tary of the Treasury, to levy the duties imposed by
the act of 1833.
That act was passed under peculiar circum-
stances, to which it is not necessary that I should
do more than barely allude. What may be, in
theory, its character, I have always regarded it as
imparting the highest moral obligation It has
now existed for nine years, unchanged in any es-
sential particular, with as general acquiescence, it
is believed, of the whole country, as that country
has ever manifested for any of her wisely estab-
lished lns'nutions. It has insured to it the repose
which always flows from timely, wise, and mod-
era e counsels—a repose the more striking, because
of the long and angry agitations which piecededit.
This salutary law proclaim?, in express terms, ihe
principle which, while it led to the abandonment of
a scheme of indirect taxation founded on a false ba-
sis, and pushed to dangerous excess, justifies any
enlargement of duties lhat may be called for by
the real exigencies of the public service. It pro-
vides "that duties shall be laid for the purpose of
raising such revenue as may be necessary to an
economical administration of the Government."
It is therefore in the power of Congress to lay du-
ties as high as its discretion may d date, for the ne-
cessary uses of the Government, without infrin-
ging upon the objects of ihe act of 1833 I do not
doubt lhat the exigencies of the Government do re-
quire an increase of the tariff of duties above 20
per cent, and I as hule doubt lhat Congress may,
above as well as below that rate, so discriminate
as to give incidental protection to manufacturing
indusiry—thus to rmke the burdens which it is
compelled to impose upon the people, for the pur-
poses of Government, productive of a double bene-
fit. This, most of the reasonable opponents of
protective duties seem willing io concede, and, if
we may judge from the manifestations of pubic
opinion in ail quarters, this is all that the manu-
Idciuring interest? really require. I am happy in
the persuasion that this double object can be most
easily and effectually accomplished, at the present
juncture, without any departure from the spirit and
principle of the statute in question The manu-
facturing classes have now an opportunity, which
may never occur again,of permanently identifying
their interests with iho*e of ihe whole country, and
making them, in the highest sen*e of the term, a
national concern The moment is propitious to
the interests of the whole country, m the introduc-
tion of harmony among all its parts and all its sev-
eral interests. The same rate of imposts, and no
more, as will_ni"«i onrgly—ra-<>*nrTrlinh -thxr public
creHit, will secure to the manufacturer all the pro-
tection he ought to desire, with every prospect of
permanence and stability which the hearty acqui-
escence of the whole country, on a reasonable sys-
tem, can hold out to him.
But of this universal acquiescence, and the har-
mony and confidence, and the many other benefi's
that will certainly result from it, I regard the sus-
pension of the law for dis'ributing the proceeds
of the sales of the public lands as an indispens-
able condition. This measure is, in my judgment,
called for by a large number, if not a great major-
ity, of the people of the United States, by the state
of the public credit and finances, by the critical
posture of our various foreign relations; and,
above all, by that most sacred of all duties—pm>
lie faith. The act of September la*t, which pro-
vides for the distribution, couples it inseparably
with the condition, that it shall cease—first, in ease
of war; second, as soon and so long as the rate
of duties shall, for any reason whatever, be raised
above 20 per cent Nothing can be more clear,
express, or imperative, t^an this language. It
is in vain io allege that a deficit in the treasury
was known to exist, and that means were taken to
supply this deficit by loan when the act was
pasted. It is true that a loan was authorized at
the same session during which the distribution law-
was passed; but the most sanguine of the friends
of the two measures entertained no doubt but lhat
the loan would be eagerly sought after and taken
up by capitalist?, and speedily reimbursed by a
country destined, as they hoped, soon to enjoy aR
