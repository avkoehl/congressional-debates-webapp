relieve the people1* Certainly not They weie not rebponsi
ble, as the gentleman from Kentucry LMr TJm>erwoojd] had
said, for the use that was marie of tha Treasury notes, and
on any ground, could feel no difficulty with regard to the cir
culation which grows up under lire object for which they
were issued
This was not a question between a loan nnd Treasury notes,
if it were, he wuulu go for a loan But it was too late tor that
They knew they could notbonow money at the u=ual rate of
interest The gentleman from Kentucky [Mr Makshall] had
proposed that they should raise the íateoí interest to seven per
cent on bonds lather than Uu«. they should defraud public
creditors If it necessauly followed that the cred tars mus be
defrauded, the argument woutd be a strong one, but they 1 ad vo
proof that Treabury noree wouid necessarily be at a disto jnt
And, if it were so, it would be •very easy to increase the mteiest
on the/Treasury notes, instead of boi rowing money for a long
time Gentlemen had admitted that, if we borrow on bond we
must borrow fora longer tune than is lequned for the wants o¿
Government and that the debt nin*f con mue long a*ter the
necessity foi it had ceased to e\i t Whereas was it not battel
to issue lreasury note* to continue only for the time require I
bythe wants of the Govern nent'i He would re«w< toa loan
under equal circumstance , but if a nece &ity existed that we
must pay more interest than we liad been m the habit of paying,
he prefeirüd that it should be p^id for a ohort time, latner them
for a long tune That we were wirhontthe power of raisin^ mo
ney on aloanatsix pet cent m this country he took foi gianted
from the evidence befoie the Hou t And, also, that we must
resort to a loan, to extend to tun years at «even per cent or re
sort to Treasury notes fcn a«hoit time What did gentlemen in
tend? To stand still and do nothing, saying that we cannot
borrow this money, and tltat they die opposed to the i^&uirg of
Treasury notes andaré committed against it, and will there
fore do nothing for the relief of the Government and its credi
tors, and will iet the wheels oí Government stop? lie wa«i not
so committed lie conceived (his to be ? necessity which would
induce him to exercise any power of the Constitution although
dangerous, and tiust to this Constéis, and other Congresses
which should succeed, to see that this powei is not at u**ed
One thing must be considered how lo* g this state of things was
to continue Gentlemen m ght say, that if we begin now the
practice of this system we may go on while we are in powei
(and he was afraid that wout I be a very short tirm ) and afford
a precedent to otheis 1 hi  mieht be bo hut oi °ht they not o

Winch the Whig party had poured out i'h fiercer deuwiu
ahons, they were now prepaiedto pursue as the correct policy
of tht Governmcr t, rctiacung all they had formerJy said
against it
Had the issue of Treasury notes been resorted to at the extra
session, instead pfthe ill judged twuve million loan—had the
political fanati ism of the Whig ¡arty given way to the best
interests of the country, so far as to have enabled them
to adopt that measure the Goveri ment Mould now
have stood in good credit, and tie business of the coun
try generally wou'1 be far moie prospeious than it
was Instead, however, of reselling to this measure,
the trmnifhant Whig party flushed with then n.cenf victoiy,
proposed aloan of twelvemilhons ■ f dollars a<?oneof the WI

toa distressedfand ruined country Ihuroiator5* ot the day had
bceji ringing the changes of ru n and disaster fiom one end

distress of the people aoout which they had o eloqnf-nt'y de

they had been moving heaven and earth in ou'tr to destioy the
character of this Government They ha 1 at la«t obamed
power, and i must be con fes edwat they succeeded wonder
fully m the object they had in view, for both the credit and cha
raoter of the Government were neady prostrate He wished
he had the eloquence- of Ciceio, to rouse the whole countiy to
an understanding of the condition towhieh tho&i tleyhaden
trusted v.ih power had brought hem líe \ ished he could
display to them, the naked deformity of the Wh gpiity When
be reflected on the disa^Urs thit had been occasioned by the e\
travagance" and rmsruie of th tt party, he confessed he
felt so excited is to cause his blood to run in a swift cur
rent tnroush his veins He was about obseivmg that,
at the turn, of autho ízing this loan, the orators ind presses of
tint party were declaiming about mm and distie^s, depressed
trade, and impoverished people, and that that I oan bill was a
glorious act of ielief; and if he mistook not, lie had heard agentle
man say on that flor, that it was a measure that would induce
rich capitalists to disgorge their treasures of gold and silver
and pour them out hi refreshing abundance upon the country
li he had time to trace further some of tht areum nt& usej by

individual were to conduct his affairs as the affairs of this OV-
vemment had been conducted, his hfe upon it, he would, if he
lived m Ohio be sent to the lunatic asylum Let him be guilty
ol as much profligacy-and coiruption, and in France he would
be sent to the galleys, while in Russia or Prussia, he would be
sent to work m the mines Mr D then adverted tathe late de-
velo pmemsof cor uption in the management of the Untted States
Bank, and the &25,0G0 worth of plate presented to Nicbolaalktl-
<lle, comparing it with the \\ hr^ party, by which it had &een
upheld and defended but he said that he felt no disposition to
run the pnal W iui titer than to say, that the Bank of the United
States had met with i srewaid, the Whig party fead met with
naieward, and he trusted that ihe country was on the eve of
being relieved fiom bo'h for ever
Having, at the extra session, bestowed S25,GG0 as a douceur to
a favorite, having tin ow n away the proceed*, of the public lands;
and having also tl rown the buiden of the Post Office Depart-
ment on the National Treasury, where it ought never to hava
been placed, the next thing that the Whig party did was to pass
an act to borrow r oi ey Where, now, were the economy, re-
tienchment, and reform that they h-'d so liberally piomisedthe
couniiy'? The result of all these liberal promises was signally
displayed m the d ^graceíul f option in which the Government
was now piased And this brought him to the consideration of
how it was his duty to act on the pr^&ent occabion However
much he might delight m the disasters and destruction of what
he believed to bea wicked andcoriupt party, who had abused
the corfidenceofihe people andvsolated all the pledges they so
solemnly maue u them, yet he felt for hrs countiy, and when
events mieiest oi ivs honor wps at stake, he would always be
