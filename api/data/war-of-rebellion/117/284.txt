Honorable EDWIN M. STANTON, Secretary of War:

The following has just been received from the Confederate lines:

Captain HOPKINS:

Send word to Doctor Collins at City Point to notify General McClellan that our agents for exchange of prisoners will be at Aiken's to-morrow at 12 o'clock meridian.

Acknowledge receipt of this dispatch.

R. E. LEE,

I beg to urge upon you the immediate appointment of the agents.

Major General GEORGE B. McCLELLAN:

Major-General Dix and Major-General Franklin are appointed our agents for the exchange of prisoners. If either of these cannot attend you may name some one to take his place. Major-General Dix has been notified of time and place of meeting.

Major-General DIX:

A dispatch from General McClellan states that the agents for exchange of prisoners on the part of the Confederate is to be at Aikden's to-morrow at 12 o'clock. I think you had better go up and explain why our rolls of prisoners are not ready and that they will be furnished and the prisoners sent on immediately. General McClellan can then appoint General Franklin or some one else to act as agent and General Halleck designate an agent at Vicksburg. It is important there should be no misunderstanding and you can prevent it better than any one else. Your visit to Point Lookout appears to be of minor importance to this.

EDWIN M. STANTON.

Honorable EDWIN M. STANTON:

By a dispatch from General Williams just sent to you it will be seen that the agent of the insurgents was at Aiken's yesterday. I understood that General McClellan would send some on to act for his army until an appointment could be made at Washington. Paroled prisoners arriving here from Richmond every day and they look for prompt action on our part.
