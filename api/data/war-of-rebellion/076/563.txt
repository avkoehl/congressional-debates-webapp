CARTERSVILLE, August 17, 1864.

Major General W. T. SHERMAN:

McCook's cavalry has returned, and a report of their operations has been sent to the front. The wire was not cut, but worked very hard during early part of the night. I don't think the enemy will attack this place just now. The six rebel regiment reported six miles below here yesterday were not there. Eighty or 100 guerrillas gave rise to the report. I have cavalry patrols well out.

Colonel, Commanding.

CHATTANOOGA, August 17, 1864.

(Received 19th.)

Major-General THOMAS:

I have driven Wheeler's forces all off our main line, except a few small squads he has left to annoy us, and will have trains running to the front to-night. He has gone in the direction of Knoxville with his whole force, except one regiment, which camped near Red Clay last night. He destroyed in all about two miles of track, burned two water-tanks and two small bridges near Dalton, and captured about 150 of our men. My loss, killed and wounded, including 17 Laiboldt lost, is about 50. We killed and wounded fully 200 of the enemy. Will report by courier. He skirmished a little at Cleveland, but did no damage.

Very respectfully, &amp;c.,

JAMES B. STEEDMAN,

Major-General.

I just arrived at this point and find a quarter of a mile of track torn; will reach Chattanooga to-night, if possible; have been repairing road all day. Wheeler has gone to East Tennessee with his whole force, except one regiment left to cut the road.

JAMES B. STEEDMAN,
