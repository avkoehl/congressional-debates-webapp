Lewisburg and sixty tons to Clarksville will be sufficient, and if it can be done forty tons should be sent here. If this place is not to be evacuated, I respectfully request that boats be sent up with a supply of subsistence, forage, quartermaster's stores, and medical supplies. In either event, evacuation or no evacuation, I beg that boats will be sent.

Major General G. M. DODGE,

Commanding Department of the Missouri:

GENERAL: I am in receipt of your letter to headquarters Military Division of West Mississippi of December 11, 1864,* in relation to sending through our lines certain people from Missouri, with indorsement to the effect that they will be passed through at this point. It will be very inconvenient to pass them through the lines at this place. I propose to pass them through at Gaines' Landing, on the Mississippi River. Any orders or permits from your headquarters will be approved, without delaying the parties, by the commanding officer at the mouth of the White River, and the landing can be made at Gaines' Landing. Please direct parties whom you send South in future to report at mouth of White River.

Very respectfully, &c.

Major-General.
