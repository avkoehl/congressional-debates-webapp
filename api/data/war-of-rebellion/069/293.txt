(of between 100 or 200 wagons) was passing in their rear yesterday during the fight. A negro sent in by General Wright states that he was lately a servant at General Fitz. Lee's headquarters; went to Allen's Station with the cavalry; stopped at Allen's for the infantry to pass. General Ewell's corps passed late day before yesterday p. m., going in the direction of Mechanicsville. He knows nothing about Hill or Longstreet.

Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: Scouts sent out on left this a. m. returned. Report that they went to within half a mile of Gibson's Mill on the road from Totopotomoy Creek to Mechanicsville. Met infantry there and were fired upon. Saw about 20. They had bayonets. Think it was a small reconnoitering party sent from the right of Lee's line to watch the road. Other parties are out on different roads. Will report on return.

Very respectfully,

GEORGE H. SHARPE,

Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: Gibson's Mill is about 4 miles north of Cold Harbor, on a branch of the Matadequin Creek. Gibson's house is on the sheet marked Ed. May 2, 1864, on the road from Mechanicsville to Old Church, and the mill just above it. Plough, who went out this a. m. to the right, went as far as Taylor's Ford, nearly opposite hanover Court-House, on the Pamunkey. he found the ford obstructed by felled timber, and was unable to cross; could see nothing of the enemy, and learned from people at the mill there that nothing had been seen of the enemy there since the first advance of our troops, or, at all events, since night before last. He reports a large quantity of corn, say 6,000 bushels, in a barn on Taylor's farm, 1 mile from the ford.

Respectfully,

GEORGE H. SHARPE,
