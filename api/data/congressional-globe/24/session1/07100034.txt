APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
[Januaj-jf 19,
24th Cúng....1st Sess.
National Defense—Mr. Hubbard.
Senate.
The object oí this communication cannot be
misundt rstood—there can be no mistake about
the matter It wis to put tin two Houses of
Con?!ess in poss ssion of all the intoimation
i  possesion of the Executive upon the sub-
ject of oui nltUons with Fran , which hid
come to his knowledge atter his message at the
opening of the session, and this information was
communicated at the latest possible period, to
enable Congress to act upon the subject, if they
deemed any action expedient and necessary, ex-
pressing, in the conclusion of his message, his
entire confidence in Congress, and that on their
part everything would be done to maintain the
n^hts and honor ot the country which the occa-
sion required. There was a peculiar propriety
ill making the communication at the time it was
made, it had become necessary—it was near the
close oí the session, it was, in all probability,
tin last communication winch the Pi csident would
b< able to make to that body upon that absorbing
subject The Senate had, also, moie than one
month before this communication was made ,upon
the repoitof their Committee on Foiugn Rela-
tions,unanimously come to the resolution, " That
' it is inexpedient at present to adopt any legisla-
'tive measure in regard to the state of affans
'between the United States and France "
The House of Representatives had the subject
before them at the time this last message was
communicated, and on the very day next follow-
ing the receipt of this message, the Committee of
the House on Foreign Relations reported the fol-
lowing resolutions:
" 1 Resolved, That it would be incompatible With the
rights, and honor ot the Uhited stated luruer to negotiate
in relation to tlic treau enured into by Franco on the 4th
ot Juh, 1831 and that this Hou-e will insist upon its exe-
cution, as ratified by both <!ovemment 
" 2 Kejoired, I hat the Committee on Foreign Affairs
be discharged from the further consideration of  o much of
tin President'  me~sase as relates to commercial restric-
tions, or to reprisals on the commerce of Trance
'■ J Resolicd, That contingent preparations orurht to be
made to meet my emergency growing oat ot our relations
witli France "                                                                  I
At a subsequent day, as late as the 2d of
March, the House finally came unanimously to
the resolution, "That the treaty with France on
the 4th of July, 1S31, ought to be maintained,
and its execution insisted on",—yielding the last
resolution which the committee had reported on
the 27th day of February, for the reason, as ex-
pressly stated by the chairman of that committee,
to pioduce a unanimity on the vote of the House
upon the adoption of the first resolution, at the
wane time communicating that lit should offer an
umendment to tne fortification bill then pending
in the House, appropriating, conditionally, three
millions for the purpose of national defense
These pioceedings on the part of the House had
become matter ot history, they were published in
the papers of this city, and they must have been
known to the membcrsof the Senate. The amend-
ment then proposed by Mr Cambrei evu, as the
chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations,
to the fortification bill, which is now the subject
of debate, was what that committee deemed, and
tin House considered, expedient and necessary to
do upon the subjei t of otu affairs with France. |
The question u is then pending m the Chamber
of Deputies, whether they would or would not
pass the bill of indemnity was unknown, whether I
they would pass it untiammtlcd with conditions
was alike unknown. This amendment then pro-
posed, comprehend! dall that the House regarded
as licces&ary to be done under all existing circum-
stance s It was the action of that body. Itwas
agie'fd to by a vei y decided majonty of tnat body.
Among the yt-iin are included the names of f>ome
of the most distinguished membeis of that House,
who were opposed to the Administiation. That
this amendment was offered, not to defeat the
fortification bill, but to cari y out the message of
the President of the 26th of Febiuary—that it
was offered as a precautionary measure, consid-
u,ng the attitude and the position of our affans
wiJi France ,no person conversant wnh thefacts,
can for one moment doubt.
The gentleman from Massachusetts íemarkcd
"that the propos d grant was defended, so fdr as
it was defended at all, upon an alleged necessity
growing out of our foreign relations." The
terms of the grant—of the amendment itself,
leave not a shadow of doubt upon the mind how
it happened to be offered, and the history of the
proceedings shows clearly and explicitly why it
w as proposed at the time as an amendment to
the fort'hontion bill If, then, I am conert, the
President had co nmumcated, not to one House,
but to both House s, the very informition wh,ch
he was required to communicate under the clause
of the Constitution to which the gentleman has
referred
He not only had, at the opening of the session,
sent in hia message giving full information of the
state of the Union, but, as late as the 26th of
February,he communicated, by special message,
the then state and condition of our relations with
France—that the Chambers had not then passed
the indemnity bill, and the instiuctions which he
had given to our Minister at tint Court. He had
done all that could by any possibility be required
of him to do By the message, he left it for Con-
gress to decide upon the measures to be adopted.
All that the Constitution requned of the Presi^
dent—all that a patriotic regard to the state of
the Country required of hmi, had been done—all
that the peculiar and embarrassing attitude of
our affairs with France had suggested, was faith-
fully communicated to both Houses of Congress;
and it was this "message—it was the exposed
and defenseless state of our country—it was the
necessity growing out of our relations with
France, that induced the House to propose and
adopt the amendment It was all this which
made the amendment necessary, expedient, and
proper.
How, then, could the honorable Senator from
Massachusetts urge as an objection, that Con-
gress-were in the dark, that no information had
been communicated from the Executive, that wé
had no Executive recommendation whether the
measure was or Was not required, whether it was
Or was not necessary and proper> Sir, can the
gentleman show to this Senate that it has ever
been the practice of the Executive to do more
than w hat was done by him m relation to this
subject? Would the gentleman have had the
Executive call in direct terms for an appropria-
tion of |3,000,000, the expenditure of which was
to be committed to his discretion > I presume not.
Would he have had the Executive, after having
communicated, through his Departments, the pre-
cise condition of our Navy, the state of our forti-
fications, the amount of our ordnance, and every
mfoimation necessary for the action of Congress,
gone further, and in this message, have stated
that the further sum of $3,000,000 is now required
to arm oar fortifications, and to hive in readiness
such a naval force as the exigency of the times
demanded > I trust not. The President had
properly submittfd the whole matter to Congress,
leaving it with them to do whatever they should
deem it necessary, expedient, and proper to do
He had stated in his message at the opening of
Congi-ess what particular measures he considered
advisable. In his last message he left, where it
should have been left, the whole matter with the
Congress of the United States, and yet we are
told that we havf had no Executive communica-
tion upon this subject, and on this ground the
appropriation was opposed—on this ground it
was successfully resisted by the Senate. The
position of the gentleman, that this appropriation
was opposed on the ground that it did not come
recommended by executive authority, strikes
me to be wholly untenable—it proves too much.
The appropuation was $3,000,000 for fortifica-
tions, ordnance, and increase of the Navy—L
opposed, and successfully opposed, says the gen-
tleman, for the reason that it was without execu-
tive recommendation. Well, sir, was there any
executive recommendation for the substitute re-
ported by the committee of conference* The
gentleman certainly assented to that report; he
was himself the chairman of that committee I
am unable to see any real difference between the
amendment of the House to the fortification bill
and the report of the committee of conference,
except in the amount, and exceptf also, that the
expenditure of the $3,000,000, in whole or in
part, was left to the discretion of the President.
The sum recommended by the committee of con-
ference was an absolute and unconditional appro-
priation.
But ltisproper here to remark, that the expend-
iture of the three millions, in whole or in part,
left to the discietion of the President, wts not
paiticularly excepted to by the gentleman from
Massachusetts If, then, the great objr etion really
was, that the appropriation of three millions had
not thr sanction of the Executive authority, that
it was not recommended by the President or by
either of the Departments, does not the same ob-
jection apply with equal force to the report of the
committee of conference ' Where was the author-
ity for reporting as an additional appropriation
for arming the fortifications of the United States
$300,000' We had passed the fortification bill,
we had introduced into that bill all the appropri-
ations w hich were recommended to us, and which
we considered necessary and expedient And
how, then, did it happen that a further sum of
$300,000 was proposed > Notin pursuance of any
executive recommendation, says the Senator,but
solely in pursuance of the recommendation of the
committee of conference. The same committee
proposed, as an additional appropriation for the
repair and equipment of the ships of the United
States, $500,000. We had passed the usual bill
for the naval service, and no such appropriation
was then believed necessary or proper. How
did it happen that this large appropi íation was
recommended at that particular time ? Not in
pursuance of any executive recommendation, the
gentleman from Massachusetts contends How
Oien' Something must have occurred within the
short period which had elapsed between the pas-
sage of the bill for the naval service, and the time
when this large additional appropriation was rec-
ommended and proposed.
I say, then, sir, there is no more, but just as
much authority for the amendment to the fortifi
cation bill, as proposed by the House, as there
was for the $800,000 proposed as a substitute by
the committee of conference. There was an
influence—there was a reason—there was a con-
sideration for the action of the House, the same
influence—the same reason—the same consider
ation must have operated upon the committee, and
what was it, sir' What induced the House to
propose an appropriation of $3,000,000 at the time
it did > What induced the committee of confer-
ence to strike out the $3,000,000, and to substitute
$900,000' jor this is all the real essential difference
between the action of the House and the action
of the committee. I ask what had occurred to
induce this action of the House, and this action
of the committee' The answer is at hand, it
was the message of the President of the 26th
o£ February, 1835, giving information of the
posture of our affairs with France, of the deter-
mination of the executive, in the event that the
Chamber of Deputies should neglect to pass the
bill of indemnity. Disguise it as you may, it
was the then existing relations between the
United States and France which called for this
largo appropriation It was our defenseless mar-
itime frontier; it was the unarmed state of our
fortifications, it was oar unpreparedness to meet
a possible contingency, which induced the House
of Representatives, upon the communication of
that message, in the exercise of its proper dis-
cretion, to propose an appropriation of $3,000,000,
to be expended in a certain way, if the expend-
iture should, in the discretion of the President,
become necessary. It was the same consider-
ation which induced the committee of conference
to substitute the sum of $800,000 in lieu of the
$3,000,000. Then, Mr. President, I cannot fail
to come to the conclusion, that the first ground
of objection made by the Senator from Massa-
chusetts was not well taken. That the facts
showed clearly, that we were not only not without
executive recommendation in this matter, but that it
was the executive's comtnunication which produced
the action of the House, and I presume also the
action of the committee of conference.
The appropriation embraced in the amendment
of the House of Representatives to the foitifica-
tion bill, which was rejected by the Senate, was
a contingent appropriation—its expenditure con-
fided to executive discretion; and I am unable to
conceive what more could ha\ e been done by the
executive, with reference to this subject, than was
done. From my examination, I have not been
able to find a precedent wheie the executive has
