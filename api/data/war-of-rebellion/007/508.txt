HEADQUARTERS ELEVENTH BRIGADE, Columbia, December 19, 1861.

(Received December 20, 1861.)

Brigadier General GEORGE H. THOMAS,Commanding First Division, Lebanon, Ky.:

GENERAL: * * * * As far as I can ascertain, there is no certainty that Zollicoffer is on the other side of the Cumberland. My information one day is that Zollicoffer's whole force [is] on this side and the next day that his whole force is on the other side. I have received a letter from the Cumberland, informing me that W. G. Brownlow was in Fentress County, Tennessee, advancing this way with 1,500 to 2,500 men. I heard two days ago that Brownlow was certainly in jail in Knoxville, and no doubt felt that he would be hung.

There is no reliable news here of interest, except that Morgan or some other rebel is ravaging the county of Metcalfe and toting off the stock of all kinds. Zollicoffer is sending large trains of wagons both into Tennessee and to Celina on the river to bee shipped south.

My messenger returned without meeting the messenger from your headquarters.

Respectfully, &amp;c.,

J. T. BOYLE,

Brigadier-General Commanding.

P. S.-You will do me a personal favor and the public a service if you will see that Bramlette and his field officers are supplied with tents and are left without excuse for not staying in camp.

Brigadier General GEORGE H. THOMAS,Commanding First Division, Lebanon, Ky.:

GENERAL: To-day has passed without anything worthy of note. I have seen nothing and heard nothing of the enemy.

One of my regiments is scouting in the direction of the enemy's camp to-night, and may bring in something of interest by morning.

A party of Colonel Hosking' men returned this morning from a two days' scout on the south side of the river, bringing nine Belgium rifles and a few blankets and knapsack, taken in a slight skirmish with the enemy on that side of the river.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

A. SCHOEPF,

Brigadier-General, Commanding First Kentucky Brigade.
