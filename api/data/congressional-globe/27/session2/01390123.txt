fears to call u pon the States for what they justly owe, while it
does not hesitate to impose additional taxes upon the necessa
riesof life, to be paid by those who consume them You com
pel, said Mr 1 the farmer to pay a tax upon every farming
utensil wh oh he uses—the mechanic upon the tools of hi 
trade—the laborer upon his coarse clothing—the very beggar
upon the salt which he eats with his potato—but you aie afraid
to call upon the States for what they owe, lest it should be va
popular
Mr F continued by saying that he should hive been unwil-
ling to oppose this bdl if he did not suppose that a better re
medy was withm the power of the majority m Congress, and al
though he presumed that his voice woul i be unheeded, he would
advise those who had the power hue, that if they would escape
the shameful cundition into which we have fallen, instead of
rushing madly on, deeper and deepei into debt and difficulty, 
to retrace their steps,—to undo, as far a  they could, all that
they had done—to blot out, as faraspo&bib'e, every vestige of
the extra session, undei the dioa&tious consequences of which
the country and the Government aie alike suffenug—to restore
to the public Treasiuy the íeceiptsfiom the sales of the public
lands—repeal your Bankrupt law, which will utter1 y derange
the whole business of the countiy, and make ten bankrupts
where it will relieve one—to repeal the law of the extra session
organizing the home squadron, at an expense of a million ofdol
lars a year, a useless humbug, which the t-^ecre ary of
the Navy does not know what to do w th—to call upon
the States for an instalment of the money they have
in deposite—in a word, set sen nisi y and hone&tly to work
to redeem your piomises of" retienchm^w, economy, and re
form," cut down your expenses five millions below t e annual
expenses ot the last Almmisiiation, inste id of raising them tint
amount higher, reduce your official galanes as you promised—
reduce the number of officers  as vou promised—in the name of
the people,[said Mr P I be&eech you to dos methwg besides
adding debt to debt, and helping taxation upon taxation You
do not need money more than you need that conn" lence which
can only be acquned by honest iction—deal justly with those
who have entrusted to you then interests—show to the world
that you intend to act honestly and you will have no need to
borrow money, or, it vou have, you can obtain it on favorable
terms

Mr ARNOLD &po te ar great It ngth on various subjects con
nected with the question befuie the House
He commenced by referring to the fact that his fi lend ftom
Pennsylvania f\Ir Cooper 1 who had the other day hinted at
the deposite bank sy&t m, and merely squinted atageneial
view of politics, wat) cafied to urdei arid his bpeeeh broken ff,
but since that time a latituJe of remark had been taken,
spreadingovei the «hole system of politic  of t'ie country for
the last twe've years And he desired the honoiablecnanman
to award to h m the sime latitude for he disliked very much to
be handled by ngid rules He should go accoidmg to the De
mocratic maxim, and take the largest liberty
the gentleman from Ohio [Mr Deah] had yesterday said
that the Whig party weie totally dissevered and resemhl d a
headless corpse But there was a little remnant oí the Whig
partv left here anl he thought i v as unkind foi gentlemen to
tread with iron heel upon the dead and marg ed body, and that
there was little ma-,nanunit\ in it When the Wh g piity that
had but ucently b^en called the triumc, hint Whig party was
now laid in the du«t and sea tered to t ie foul wind- of heaven,
it should be his business to stand by I he little fragment that ie

told by the chairman of the Commit ee of Ways and Means
and by the Secretaiy of the Treasiuy tl it they could not líe
had no doubt of the fact himself, tnd for the reasons that he
would state
During the last twelve yeirs a paity hat risen up in tul*
country, extending itself ftom New Hampshne to Missoun,
•whose incessant cry was 'the nch man against die poor man "
which wa& calculated to f xeite prejudice against the capitalists
in the country, no mattei how their wealth has been ac limed,
jf from industry, economy, andsobnety, he was denounced by
this party as an enemy to the poor man, and the doctrine had
gone forth through the land of repeal—the lepeal of all char
ters Was not this calculated te destroy credit, and to make
the man of capital go to the caves and bury his money, for fear
that the strong arm of the robber, excited by these veiypolm
cians who held this agrarian doctrine which strikes down every
thing, mieJiteonie an 1 rifle his coffirs, and if he rented, put
him to the swoid? 1 he cry has also been raised ag unst foreign
capitalists,¡whose money we had bonowed to carry on the busi
ness of the countrv it began wi h regard to the poor lit le
sum ol seven millions, at the time oi the old United States
Bank It was said it would never do fot ustobe Ubing the im
ney of these loros m Europe, and paying them the interest
upon it
He was convinced then that we had not enough capital m this
conn ry, that we were a young and vigorous people and needed
a great deal moie capital, and he vo ed to retain this s jm withm
ourboiders The question came up upon therechaiter of the
old Bank of the United States A laige majority of the oppo
nents of Jackson at tha time went for the countiy instead of
the par y, and passed a law re e tibhs* in- the Bank of the
United States, and thp blessed veto h id c ime whi^h was intro
duced into the Cons itution by tho e who favoied monaichy,
aftei they had filled in their attempt to mseit a ptovi^ion that
the Executive ehoul' sustain his position for life His demo
ciacy was that the majority should rule, both when he was m
the nnnoutyand when he wa^in the majority But this was
not the course < f modern Demon acy which went fot the party
instead of thf countiy TJadei (he veto powei this seven mil

plied the ve o, and theDemoiricy iai>cd the shout then, as they
did last fill wht.n ly'cr used his vetoes, an 1 he would come to
that subject and show whqee President Tyler was The e^n
t emin ftom Pennsy'vmn [Mi Cohpeu] had spoken of the
courtship between the Ptesident and the modern Dernoentic
party This began (continued Mi A) at the time of the "ha

Cirolma, [Mi Pickens] When his colleague, last session,
ha i mtrodu cd a n solution for themehgibdity of the President
after one teim the gen'leman from South Carolina had asked
t im if it mclu lelthe piesent incumbent to which the reply
bein„ that it did not, the gentleman thtn sai 1 that he would vote
for it
Mr A then triced the progress of this ( courtship ,f as mdi

[Mi Cooper] had said his icciedittd oigan had declaied that

He was going on to show that the Government had no credit

and they now came ready to undo their own work The mo
dein Democracy who had íaise 1 the k,ry of the nch against the
poor, and who had shed so manv teirs over the poor man for
tne sake of miking a Imlei oimcal ripjfal, had come forwiid
and raise 1 the shout igams' the veiy first law that hal Ven
concocted for the benefit of the honest poor man—lor he must
show himself to be an honest man before he can take the benefit

teied, tracing the inconsistencies of th course pmsued by the
[ ar y m powei foi the last twelve>eiis which had forrnetlv
^upp >rtcd the sta e bank depo  e s^ *tm and which, when
the deposites were moved from the Uni ed btates Bank, hal
given the ordei to the hanks to loan freely, and undei whose
auspices the banks, having increased from three hundied to
nine hundred in mmibei, and having exploded and produced
distress throughout the country, they had turned round against
them and advocated the hard money system, on which they
had rode into office, and were rode out of it by "Old Tip"
After all this they come forward and tell us that the hun-
died days of Whig rule has brought all these evils upon the
nation
The Government had been in the hands of quack doctors for
the last twelve years, and now by a disastrous stroke of Provi-
dence, it was m the hinds of a won=e quack than before, with
whom the opinions of Washington and Madision had no weight.
Madison hauchanged Ins opinion hke an honest man, but John.
Tyiei, like the laws of tl e Medes and Peisians, changes not.
The counyymight continue to writhe undei snffenng,and if his
mongrel production—half bub Treasury and half bank—were
not adopted, he would change not If the select committee on.
(his subject would give their plan, it might be one that he would
agree with
But if this were not the case, he would offer apian which he
thought would be acceptable to the people of the country He
hoped the committee would find it convenient soon to report
their plan They had a great deal of wisdom and experience,
and stood mneai i elation u his Excellency "Captain Tyler,"
and he should think they would be able to concoct a plan and
bring it forward When it did come foi ward, he had apian
whnh Ie should offer, and he mi^ht yet be considered the
Neckal oí this country But he was going to ask how they
found the staeof the country at the caHed session It was a
point that he wanted to keep before the people The gentle
man fiotn Georgia, [Mr MehiwííTH&h ] (he other day, had
said and challenged the Democracy on his floor to come for
war! and contradict him that Van líuren's Admimstiation had
left a debt of ©25,0üU,e0O There had been no attempt to di<*
pr«vsit
Mr Smith of Virginia here rose and said he denied it toto
c«/o,and called for the figures m its proof
Mr Arnold said he wanted to see the gentleman's figures
and his denial m writing And the gentleman from Georgia
would furnish his figures and meet the question When the
gentleman from Ge >rgia made his remarks, he had challenged
gen lemen to show that his statement was eironeous And neit
hei the learned gentleman from Virginia nor any other gent e-
man hid met the statement
the Giverum nt had b en carried on foi the last twelve
years unler this hotchp itch syt,tem—a •system of expedients,
and thisfiscality was nothing more nor le^s than another ex-

M- FI OYD replied that he wa  confident he had not stated
thattheie would not be a deficiency, but he now said, that if
the late Administra ion had bee i continued in powei, the bix

Mr ARNOLD continued Then tnere would be no deficiency,
