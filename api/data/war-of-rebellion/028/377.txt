BALTIMORE, MD., October 1, 1862-3.20 p.m.

Major-General HALLECK:

Major-General Banks says that you have ordered the One hundred and ninth New York Volunteers, at Annapolis Junction, to be placed under his command. This belongs to the Middle Department, and this regiment was placed there to protect the railroad from the Junction to the Patuxent. This part of the road is too important to be neglected, and does not come within the jurisdiction of Major-General Banks. The First District of Columbia Regiment, to which he refers, I have never considered under my command. We have three new regiments now waiting for cars to go to Washington.

JOHN E. WOOL,

Major-General, Commanding.
