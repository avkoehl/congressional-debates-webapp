Judiciary to inquire into the expediency of making certain alte

Mr LEWIS WILLIAMS ana other members objected
Mr WELLER called for the oidersof the day
REFERENCE OF THE PRESIDENT a ME8SAGF
The House resumed the consideration of the unfinished busi
«ess, being that branch of the resolution of Mi   Fillmore,
providing for the reference of the annual message of the Presi
dent, which is in the following words
Resolved, That so much therefore as lelates to thetauff be
referred to the Committee on Manufactures
Which resolution Mi Atheeton had heretofore moved to
amend by striking out the woids "Committee on Manjfac
tuies," and inserting the words "Committee of Ways and
Means '
Mr MARSHAL! of Kentucky was entitled to the floor, but
yielded it for a moment to—
Mr BARTON of "Virginia, who gave notice that he
would, upon some early du.y, by resolution or rrotion, propose
to amend the 34th rule of the House, which is in the following
words
"When two or more members happen to rise at once,
the Speaker sha Í name the member who isfirst to speak i}
With the permission of the House, Mr  B said, he must be
allowe J to ¡say that he had counted the cost of this motion    He
knew that, come when it might, it came with the ascription of
a motive of wounded vanity    Cut he had Democracy enough
to prefer the dictation of the House of Commons to the dicta
cation of a King   he ha<j Democracy enough to preier the des
potiam of numbeis to the despotism of a  unif   and his object
was to transfer thisarbitrary po^erwhich without a violation
of the rules, he might say any ¡speaker mi^l t exercise   from
number one to the general number o    tl is House     He who
fell mto the hanch cf a banditti might probably esrape wnere
there was no such chance (Mi B wa-. understood to   &\) for
him who fell into the hands of i single robber
Mr B was interrupted m thio las sentence by
Mr G DAVÍS who called him to order
Mr BARiOX     I have said alii wis i to &av
The SPEAKER íeplied to Mr & I>a\i&, that th<= speaker
would not  arrest the gtntieman from V rgima [Mr  Barton]
but had been willing to indulge him m his remarks
But, to save the gentleman 0-om Virginia trouble the
Speaker would inform him that the very privilege the gentle
man sought by his motion wd« already guarantied to him by
the rules of the liou«e If, at any time, the Chair transcended
lUaiicem his selection between two members claiming the
floor, the gentleman considering himself aggrieved might ap
peal from the decís on of the Chair and submit the ma'ter to the
judgment of theHouse Butuwasmade the imperative duty
of the Speaker, m the first instance, to decide the conflictiug
claimsto the foor, the words of the rule being 'the Speaker
shall name ' <SLc
Mr MARSHALL, in allusion to what had fall u from the
gentleman fiom Virginia, [Mr Baeton ] made an explanation
exoneiatmg himself from ill blame m the matter which seemed
to have given that trentleman so much uneasiness, out of re
spect and kindness to one for whom no one en eita nel higher
respect, and who seemed to have a peculiar anxietv to oitam
the floor he had offered to waive In  own right to it, under the
speaker s decision, but the gentleman declined to avail himself
of the offer
Advening then to the quest on before the House Mr M
ob&erved that it did not ae^m to hun to involve any difficulty
or justly to authorize the extent of debite to which it had
given rise    it was a simple question of reference which, in
itself, involved no declaration of principle in relation to the
merits, either on one side or the other of the much-debated
question of the tariff    It was a mere question of parhamer
tary propriety, as between two of the stand ner committees of
the House, to which of them a certain pottion of an £\ecu
uve communication should be sent    To Mr  M  it appealed
that an examination of the language employed by the Presi
dentin the communication íeferredto must at once settle the
matter    [Here he quoted from the me&sage the passages re
íerring to an increase oi dune45 ]   In the'-e pas ages he uu
der^teod the President as i itendma to intimate it as hisopi
men that, although duties should in no case be laid beyond the
amount of revenue actually nee led by the Government  jet
m the tmposi ion of them Congress might legitimately have
an especial eye to the protection of the domestic mdu try of
the country, and migh so frame its legislation that the ta\es
needed bj Uie 1 reasury might incidentally contribute to that
eul     It that was the opinion of the President and Consress
was calle 1 upon byhnn to lay revenue duties with a view to
uuardthe domes íc industry of the people, without nansoend

lh°re could bt nnthin  &o fatal to the peace and to the
union of these States as the agitation of questions in which
the interests of slave labor should be set in opposition to those
of free labor—in which a line was drawn between different
bectuns of the Union as if their interests were hostile to each
other And the idea was attempted to be established that
the Government of this country could not exert the power con
ferred upon it by the Constitution to establish a uniform sys
tern for the regulation of commerce without arrayng one half
the country against the other, and benefiting the one at the
expense of the other Mr Ms views of the general subject
werev*idely different Ihe fact that slaveiy prevailed in a
portion of the land and not in another portion, taken id connec
tion with the diversity of products and of purcmtsarrongdif
ferentpor ion=of the courtry, had always struck him as one of
the stiongest possible cements oi our iidtional Union What
furnished a more certain foundation for the interests of com
merce than such a diversity! Or what had proved a surer basis
for peace and amity among different nations of the worlds
Werethere one dead uniformity m na ural productions and in
social pursuits, there could exist nomutual exchanges between
dirfeientportions of the earth, and the natural tendency would
be to rivalry and discord whereas a natural diversity of pro
ducts and of social habits among different sections of the same
country, or among difieren countrns, naturally tended, if pas
sion wereabsent to unity and peaceand mutual prosperity and
happiness Could it ever be the intere«tofvihe North to crush
slave labor? To destroy a species of industry different from
its own, and capable of being made a frmtfifil source of its pros
penfy'i Or, on the other hand, could the South have any inte
rest m prostiating the industry and destroying the capital of
then ¡Northern brethren'' i\evei,^uiely never But, so s> on

our valleys aad our plains were covered with every plant plea-
sant to the eye or good for food, staple prod cts of the highest
commercial importance abounded on every side, yet, strange
to tell, with a lard like th's m our pos ession, anda popula-
tion increasing beyond all example foreigners could come to
our &hores, take fiom us the raw material cany it across the
ocean, manufacture it into a thousand useful forms, derive all
the profit of such manufacture, and return u to us without
taking scarcely any thing of ours in return
Mr M wanted to see an end put to such a state of things, h&
wanted to see the day when under the protecting arms of the
Government, extended over every branch of our own domestic
i ¡dusáry (and here he knew  the danger of running his head
a«am«t the'compromise act ") all that could be produced to
meet the wants ot this nation should be produced here—upon
her own soil    The home market was the bebt of alt markets
When we bartered with foreigner*, a portion of the profit,
perhaps the larger portion, went into the pocket of the fo
reio-ner    But if we traded with our own people, the profit was
American, all mund    If we traded with an Englishman, half
the profit went to Fngland but when a man of the South traded
with his brother in Isew England, America got the whole-
double the amount was made an i saved to the nation
Ay, but how would all this mte-fere with the com promise act?
And what was the compromise act?   It was a law passed m
1833, fixing a uniform duty of twenty percent  on all imports
after a certain day, but very generously leaving it in the power
of CoHgress to fix the rate higher or lower, if the nece«sities of
the Government should require or permit according fo the ex-
cess or the depletion of the Treasury    Why so m uch sensibili-
ty was exhibited   i connection with dm Hw Mr M had never
been íbletoundc stand    For his own pait,  even if the law
had-"on'ained n   -jch«avsn£Glau«e,nosuth leserve of power
to the Government to vary the rate of duty, he should deny its
authority m/ofo as a rule to bind the legiblauon of Congress
He denied the po >\er of any one Congress to clothe a law of its
enactmen with i constitutional sanction and sacredness for
all future time     Ks a temporary expedient—as a means of
sootrin* and allying political and sectional txaspeiation, it
might be all veiy well, it mi^t even have been wise for the
tirrethen p esetit    South Carolina he'd towards the Geneial

Greatmen on either side, were idem fied with íhe controversy,
and its progress had involved the who'e country in a state of
high and alarn ingexasperatio i   h wasieared by good and wise
men that the peace of the Union might be endarirered, and urder
such an ominous juncture of en cum«taaces this lo npro n se bill
became a law    As a measure of pohev is ap e^ertiveof evil,
it was wise, considering the lime      Bu    to meet us at this
dav  in 1842 an I tell us that i law pa^ed in 1833 has power
to bind thi« Government to ill eternity, as a comoact—as an or-
ganic fundamental law—w as to advance a proposition to which
Mr  M  ne-*erwomd>ieIdhu,a«ent    He ne?er would recog
