My colleague next quotes a parage from the same «paéc&v
m which Í am represented as having spoken i>f the, majority iff
this Hou e as a "passive, twitd, and time serving vugontv."
My colleague can have hai3 no other object in bringing ttua
statement to the notice of the comrriitee but the benevolent
one of bringing me into personal collision with the gentlemen
who compose the majority of this body He, no doubt  supposes
that f will be embarrassed and confounded by having this pari
of ray speech thus brought to the notice of the gentlemen whd
were the subjects of the remarte My colleague^ I trust, wiJI
find that ho misapprehends me Such a sentiment I would
not utter; such a character of the members of this House I
certainly would not attempt to draw, when spea&mg m the
House, because it would not be admissible or (¡ant parliamen-
ts y to do so Of the influence of the Executive, arwí of the
power oí r<*rty discipline in this House, I have often spoken irs
the most decided language on this floor So far I migai pro-
psiW go here As to whether I uttered the sentiment ro the
precipe temis imputpd to me m the pi ssage quoted by my
colleague from the Hartford speech I can neither admit nor
deny 1 he printed speech from which my colleague oMotes,
I never saw or íeaa, e/ci i such extraéis from it as filled the
columns of the Administration pre*? in Tennessee duungthe
wintei I nevei saw the manuscript from which it was print
cd, noi did I know that it would be published It must have
bfcen published by some person who took notes of it m the
usual w?y, When it waa delivered , but,m jueticeto therepa^
ter, whoever he Was, I must say that I found all the extracts
alluded to, although selected, no doubt, on the ground that they
weietne most objectionable parts of the speech-, substantially
coneu, and I wondered how so much generai accuracy cosía
hav been attained, under the cneumsianceá I may, in the
incitement of the moment, have used the precise foim of ex-
pression ifr speaking of the majority in Congress imputed to
me, but I beg leave to *ay that the terms there used would nos
exptcag my dehbe ate sen'mtents in relation to the majority of
this House I have too much respect for alarge portion of the
gentlemen of this House, composing the majority, to use that
language as determine oí them The terms employed arc
liable to iv o exceptions They are too harsh, and imply more
censure tfcan X wouM deliberately bestow in speaking of a large
numbei oi the members in tbe majority, but, on the other
hand, 'bey fall I tr short of the severity Wl*h which I WOtlld be
compelled to speak, if it should be made my duty to express
n y opinion of another and smaller portion of thefxiv
The kc vi ¿round of charge alleged against me by nweof
Viene is another parage ofthe speech at Hartford, m which!
he «ays I clmgedthc late President of the United States with
li ivirig violated and trampled upon the ConsUtuUoa My co!
league wishe* to know, if I really entertaii&d such opinions q{
the conduct oí the late President, why I did not move an im-
pt-trhment a«am&f h'm in this House As Í did not dow, my
collcigue miet? (hit I am in the habit of making unfounded
chilli s i<Min*t (he Irite Ftesident and bis administration (5) I
< in u form m\ «nVacuctrat 1 made no charge in my speech
t )f if ford which 1 havt, not olten made upon this floor, and
durin" I'rrtF p ilmy days of the power and populan y of the
' ue Ewcum e Chief it has been my opinion, and 1 have not
>et patted horn it, that ti e late President did trample upon
home of the most impoitant and Vital principles of the Con-
i-ti uaon rha' no impeachment was actually moved against
1 11 ,:is not because there was any doubt that, the Constitu-
tion was m uKl and tiampled upon, norbecause m«subject
t catoed attention at the time foi, sii, I, (oi one, did cali the
attention of this House to the subject, and declared my solemn
conviciion to be, tlu* urtxl a ereat example should be exhibited
of the powei and justice ofthis House by impeachment, the
euls of whi h we most complained would be progressive.
V id Í questioned whether anv other adequate íemedy could be
aprhed under the Constitution But, sir, 1 did not think of
moving an impediment asamst the late Piesident, because*
consjdti it g his great pop ularity and influence with the people—
that, dunng the last years of his administration, and which were
cieaily the w orst, he wa« sustained in all his conduct by a great
maionty 11 this House and in the Senate—I held that to pro
voke, without the powei to lestiain, would only aggravate the
evils of the times, and bung additional injury upon the country
and it* institution* \.n impeachment under such circum-
s anees wa- not to be thought of by a prudent s atesraan But,
it is not 'he late President only that I am of the opinion has
t aggressed and trampled upon the Constitution Tne present
Executive Cmef holds principles of administration, nay, more,
he openly sanction* tlieu in his practice, which, in my opinion,
aire clearly subversive of the \ery foundation on which the
Constitution reposes and it is funher my opinion that tbe Pre-
sident himself, together with several of the Chiefs of Depart*
ment* has been emlty of such high misdemeanors—of such
acis both of omission and c mmission, m the conduct and
manisement of various branches of the public setvice—such
abuses f pmei ma violation1* of duty as make them justly
1 ah'p to impeachment \nd that my colleague, who has intro
dated this subject, n a\ see how gravel} I have viewed it, and
how much attenuon I have bestowed upon it, I will inform him
that I nowho'd m my hand eleven articles of chaige against
thpm upon every one of -winch it is rry deliberate and solemn
conviction the) could be properly imp ached and convicted,

n on them in this House may be regaided a*> uncertain, for it
is not pubt c «enument alone that I would consider m «ueh a

Mr Bell íesumed, and said, that is tiue, sir, but it is also
true that my colleague was peimitted to go on with his le
marks, until he said all he desired to say upon that subject I do
hot intend to discuss the merits oí tins subject I have no de
sue to do so now, nor is it important to my pt.rpooe I oily
desire to expose the attempt which has been, and will continue
to be, made to identify me with the designs of the Abolitionists
My colleague says that it is not the fanatics of (he Noith alone
who are to be feaied' Whd eise tr *rb*t els  doe? my col
league mean to say is tobe feared* Theie are, he «ays, certain
other Interests and feelings connected and allied -ft ith this meen
diary feeling at the Nonh, which are as mucn, or moie, to be
dreaded than the machinations of the Abolitioni^g This is
W at my colleague means to affirm \Vell, what are these
other interests* My colleague means to abbcit that t1 e*e are i
persons in the Southwest, mtbe^outh in the State of Temes
see, foi that is the point aimed at, who, in order to piomote then
own political interests and design*, co opeiate with, and aie be
Come, the allies of the fanatics ot the Noith Yes, sir, tlm is
what my colleague is striking at, and he, and those with whom
ne acts, mean, at a proper tu"e ?\id plrce, n> include me m
this denunciation The ground upon which he propot-os to !
make out this chiige against me is that I did not vote foi or
approve the resolution of Mr Patton I did not vote against
t jat resolution, because it appealed to have the concurrence oi
jnost of my colleagues ind fricada, md my \ote could not
change th'e result My mind, enlightened bv thee\penence of
two years upon that point, led me to the concita on tl at it wds

peated the slatpment, that eveiy membei ol v/hat ke call   the

fei that, theieioie, the Whigs of the ISoith aie all imbued with
the spirit of the fanatics of th^ Noith   oi, m other wouls, that
they favoi the cause of abolition    I am well awaie that  ny
colleague means also to use the aisument, that all those of the
Bouthand Southwest who Jet in  tl is Hou«e with the Whig
members of the North must also have like feelings and objtcts
ivilh them, and that, in fact, to gratify their politic i1 ambumn,
they are ready to sacuficenotonlv the geneial luteiust^ ol the
South and Southwest, but likewise then own piopeitv and that
of all their deaiest fnen Is    Gou'damore umeasonabVoi ab

held up, oi no o'hei sfiound in my own State, as an abolition

is piesenW in my own easel    r/hat lesolution wa=, aaopted un
der the gag of the previous question    Those who voted again-a
it had no power to assign aieasonfoi their course  then lips
weiesealed, hut the moment t íeír vote  was lecoided, tl^y
were denounced as abo'uioniats, togctner with all those who
act with them poli ically in this House
With the Whigs o! this House it it, my nleasuie and my pude
to act, especially n the gieat design of ovei throwing by al! ho
norable and cons'itutional means, the present mo&t unprincipled
and mischie\ous Admmistiauon In this greatest measuie of
reloim I heartily concur with them, though upon sum? other
questions I differ from them But sir, I have not the slightest
reason to believe that I am acting with fanatics oi Abolition sts
Some there may be of that description butthegi-at lio y oi
the Whigpartv ,n thi  House, I am. well satisfied to not favoi
or concur m the designs of the Ab ilitiomsts, wnatevei they mav
think of the institution of slavetv as an abstract que^aon it
stead of looking to the -ote on Mr Patton'siebolutim a& a test
of the sentiments of m mbers of this House upon that qu°^tio i
and as furnishing any guuind of belief that the Whigb of the
North are advocates of Abolition I see in then votes upon that
question the evidence only of their gicatei goodeense and wis
dom I see even gieater wisdom in their covuse than the gen
tlemen of the South havu manifested upon the same questio i
As for the votes given in fa>or of the resolution by the suppoit
eisofthe administration to the ^oith, Iiegardit asa meiPde
vice to persuade the South that they are then bes lnends Í
regard such a testimony of the sentiment of a portion of the
North as of no value to the South whatever 11 e moment it
shall api eai to bo the mtei est of that oarty to c i -tiue then po
sition upon this question, they will have no scruple m dons so
They will change m a single day I have, upon mo hei oeca
won, adverted to the attempt/which was madf by the s-u ip party
a few years ago to convince Southern members that they were
opposed to a system of internal improvements by the Federal
Government. I will not now enter into the details of that move
ment It will be ^ufftclent to remind gentlemen that tt tv as en
tirely delusive, that the ¿est furnished upon that occasiro wa<*

extiact from a speech made by me in the spring of 13d5, at
