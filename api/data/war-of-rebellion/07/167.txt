On consultation with General Grant and my own officers, as my services here, until we can repair damages by bringing up a competent force from Cairo to attack the fort, are much less required then they are at Cairo, I shall proceed to that point with two of the disabled boats, leaving the two others here to protect the transports, and with all dispatch prepare the mortar boats and Benton, with other boats, to make an effectual attack upon Fort Donelson. I have sent the Tyler to the Tennessee River to render impassable the bridge, so as to prevent the rebels at Columbus re-enforcing their army at Fort Donelson.

I transmit herewith a list of casualties.* I am informed that the rebels were served by the best gunners from Columbus.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

A. H. FOOTE,

Flag-Officer, Commanding U. S. Naval forces on the Western Waters.

Major-General HALLECK,

Commanding Army of the West, Saint Louis, Mo.

Numbers 5. Return of casualties in the army commanded by Brigadier General U. S. Grant, at the siege of Fort Donelson, Tennessee, February 12-16, 1862.

[Compiled from nominal lists of casualties, returns, &amp;c.]
