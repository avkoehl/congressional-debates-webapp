bridge, on the right, to Malvern Hill, on the left. Wilson had constant sharp skirmishing on 13th, losing 50 men. He has taken prisoners who report that Hill and Ewell are intrenched on the line from White Oak Swamp to Malvern Hill. Lee appears to have had no idea of our crossing the James River. General Grant moves his headquarters to City Point this morning. Weather splendid.

The Petersburg Express newspaper of yesterday has a telegram sent to Extra Billy Smith from Lynchburg stating that Hunter entered Lexington on the 11th. They estimate Hunter's strength at 16,000; his advance was resisted by General McCausland. The Richmond Enquirer of the 13th has official intelligence that Crook, with 8,000 men, was at Amherst Court-House, only twelve miles from Lynchburg. They had destroyed the bridge over the Ta River. Lynchburg is defended, as Enquirer says, by a much larger force than it had expected, aided by militia. Smith, with 15,000 men, attacked Petersburg this morning. General Bulter reports from his observatory near Bermuda Hundred that there has been sharp fighting, and that troops and trains of the enemy were, as he writes, moving from the city across the Appomattox as if retreating.

(Received 5 p. m. 16th.)

Our latest report from Smith was at 4.04 p. m. He had carried a line of intrenchments at Beatty's house, the colored troops assaulting and carrying the rifle-pits with great gallantry, but he had not yet carried the main line. He describes the rebel artillery fire as very heavy. He expected to assault this line just before dark. Hancock is within three miles of Smith.

(Via Jamestown Island 11.45 a. m. Received 4.45 a. m. 17th.)

At 7.20 p. m. yesterday Smith assaulted and carried the principal line of the enemy before Petersburg, taking 13 cannon, several stand of colors, and between 300 and 400 prisoners. This line is two miles from Petersburg. Hancock got up and took position on Smith's left at 3 a. m. to-day. There was heavy firing in that direction there from 5 to 6. No report yet.
