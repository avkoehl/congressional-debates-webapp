[COLD HARBOR, June 1, 1864.]

[General BRECKINRIDGE:]

GENERAL: Hearing from the left that General Finegan was ready to move his skirmishers I charged with mine to the rifle-pits in my front, connecting with General Wharton's left, capturing 12 or 15 prisoners. My skirmishers were there subjected to a heavy fire from the left flank and were driven in. After mine had come in I received a note* from General Finegan, which is inclosed. My skirmishers cannot [sic] unless the enemy are dispossessed in General Finegan's front. Shall I repeat the experiment without General Finegan's co-operation?

GEORGE S. PATTON,

Colonel, Commanding Brigade.

Please preserve the inclosed note* for my use.

NEAR CHESTER, VA., June 1, 1864 - 7 p. m.

General ROBERT E. LEE,

Shady Grove Church, Va.:

Prisoners and deserters report Gillmore with two division, about 8,000 men, still in my front. One of his divisions, with Smith's corps, say, 16,000 men in all, have gone to White House, probably to form junction with Grant. I have left here only one division, which can be moved to north side of James River as soon as balance of Gillmore's corps shall have been withdrawn, or Government shall have determined to abandon line of communication from Petersburg to Richmond.

G. T. BEAUREGARD.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA,June 1, 1864 - 12.45 p. m.

General G. T. BEAUREGARD:

It would be disadvantageous to abandon the line between Richmond and Petersburg, but as two-thirds of Butler's force has joined Grant can you not leave sufficient guard to move with the balance of your command to north side of James River and take command of right wing of army?

R. E. LEE,

General.
