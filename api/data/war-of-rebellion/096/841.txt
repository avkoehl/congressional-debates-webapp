CITY POINT, VA., March 5, 1865-11 a.m. [Received 11.45 a.m.]

Honorable EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

Deserters in this morning report that Sheridan had routed Early and captured Charlottesville. They report four regiments having gone from here to re-enforce Early.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

CITY POINT, VA., March 5, 1865-2 p.m. [Received 3.30 p.m.]

Honorable EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

Deserters from every part of the enemy's line confirm the capture of Charlottesville by Sheridan. They say he captured Early and nearly his entire force, consisting of 1,800 men. Four brigades are reported as being sent to Lynchburg to get there before Sheridan, if possible. I think there is no doubt Sheridan will at least succeed in destroying the James River Canal.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

CITY POINT, VA., March 5, 1865-4 p.m. [Received 6.45 p.m.]

Honorable EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

Refugees confirm the statements of deserters as to the capture of Early and nearly his entire force. They say it took place on Thursday last between Staunton and Charlottesville, and that the defeat was total.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

WAR DEPARTMENT, Washington, D. C., March 5, 1865-8.50 p.m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

I congratulate you on Sheridan's success. We are anxiously waiting intelligence from Sherman and Schofield. No apprehension is felt that you will ever exceed your authority, and your object in applying for instructions was understood. The President supposed you desired them to be explicit and made them so, not only to correspond with your wishes, but also because it was believed the enemy had a purpose in desiring to enter into political negotiations with military officers. The inauguration went off admirably, without mishap of any kind. Rawlins' nomination went in Friday, but I am unable to ascertain until to-morrow whether it was acted on. I saw the chairman of the Military Committee, who said, if they could get into executive session, it would be confirmed, but he thought they would have no session until Monday. The commission will be forwarded without delay.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.
