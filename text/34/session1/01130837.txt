MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT.
A message, in writing, was received from the
President of the United States, by Mr. Sidney
Webster, his Private Secretary.
Mr. HOUSTON called for the regular order of
â€¢ business.
Mr. COX moved that the rules be suspended,
and that the House resolve itself into the Com-
mittee of the Whole on the state of the Union.
The motion was agreed to.
DEFICIENCY BILL.
The House accordingly resolved itself into the
Committee of the Whole on the state of the Union,
(Mr. Stanton in the chair,) and resumed the con-
sideration of the amendments of the Senate to
"the deficiency bill.
Mr. ZOLLICOFFER, who was entitled to the
floor, addressed the committee for one hour in
reply to his colleague, [Mr. Smith,] yielding in
the course of his remarks for questions and ex-
planations. His speech is withheld for revision,
and will be published in the Appendix.
Mr. HUCrHSTON obtained the floor, but
yielded it for a moment to
Mr. SMITH, of Tennessee, who said: I stated,
in reply to my colleague, that I had voted for
what was called the river and harbor bill at the
last Congress, and that I should vote for the same
kind of bill again. My colleague alluded to the
fact, that the President vetoed that bill. I wish
to state in this connection that his veto of that
bill does not lessen my respect for the President,
nor does it prevent my preference for him for re-
nommation, because I regard all these questions
as of minor importance.
Mr. HUGHSTONthen resumed the floor, and
spoke upon the subject of slavery. He was fol-
lowed by Mr. WALDRON, who addressed the
committee for an hour upon the Kansas question.
Their speeches will appear in the Appendix.
Mr. BOYCEthen delivered his views upon the
subject of our relations with Great Britainv In
regard to the enlistment question he contended
that the Government of Great Britain had vio-
lated our neutiality laws, and that the United
States should insist upon reparation being made
therefor. It struck him that a future Administra-
tion coming into power would make that repara-
tion which was due from England, the present
Cabinet of that country not being able to do so
without condemning themselves. He sustained
the construction put by our Government upon the
Central American treaty, and considered that of
Great Britain as entirely unfounded. [His speech
will be found in the Appendix.]
Mr. SHORTER then obtained the floor, but
yielded it to
Mr. JONES, of Tennessee; who moved that
the committee rise.
The motion was agreed to.
So the committee rose; and the Speaker having
resumed the chair, Mr. Stanton reported that
the Committee of the Whole on the state of the
Union had, according to order, had the Union
generally under consideration, and particularly
the amendments of the Senate to the deficiency
bill, and had come to no resolution thereon.
And then, on motion by Mr. UNDERWOOD,
(at a quarter before four o'clock,) the House ad-
journed until to-morrow, at twelve o'clock, m.
