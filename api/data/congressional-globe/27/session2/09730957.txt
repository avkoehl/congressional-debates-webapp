the State It was no such trifle which would accomplish this
But it was to be kept id the public treasury, to be dribbled
away m appropriations among the thirty millions of expendi-
tureawhich, according to by gone experience, might be expect
ed to flow from the public coffers when the opposite party
again came into power, (as they now anticipated,) and the Sen
ator from New Hampshire was again at the head of the
Treasury
He wished the country to know who it was that went for di-
rect taxes—for taking away protection, and giving it to foreign
industry, and who for taking away from the education of the
poor the land fund.
Mr WOODBURY said he regretted that any of the remarks
which had fallen from him should have occasioned so much
trouble to the Senator from Kentucky Mr W really cher
ished no unkind feelings towards thatSenator, and, therefore,
would not say a syllable m retort, likely to add to those pangs
which the Senator spoke of so ardently, and in his peculiar posi
Hon must, without doubt, feel so strongly
He passed by it all, and would merely state in explanation,
one or two facts Tirst, in respect to the charge that he (Mr
W ) had voted for the abominations in the high tariff act of !82y,
the Senator labored under a great mistake, and peisistedm
it strangely, though once befoie corrected Mr W probably
voted then, as now, on some amendments designed to make
the bill better and more equal He may have voted to raise
the duty on wool, and some such articles, because they were
much lowei than on others, and in order to create moie equality
in favor of agnculture But the journal of the Senate would
show, as well as the publication of debates, that he was from
first to last opposed to the principle oí that as well as this
bill, and recorded his nay against the abominations (as the Sen
tor is pleased to tetm them)of that bill, as he should against
those of this one Next, the Senator professes to be puzzled to
discover how a bill with nearly horizontal duties of twenty or
twenty-five percent on all imports, could yield any incidental
protection to American labor or home industry
Mr W was sorry that the Senator had not learned a little on
this subject from the chairman of the Committee on Manufac
tures, who had stated in debate, this very day, that he con
sidered a horizontal tariff the mostjust, and, if high enough, as"
useful for protection as any other, or learned a little from the*
farmer of Ashland, who, in 1840, declared that the tai iff provided
in the compromise, which was horizontal, andon'y20pei cent,
would, with cash duties and home valuation, yield, incidentally,
all the protection to manufactures which waspioper, or horn
the hero of North Bend—another authority almost as Inch
with him—that the same compromise duties were enough in 1
that he would never assent to a depauure from them Why,
air, if 60 per cent duty yields any protection, will not 20 pel
cent yield one third as much? Or, n 40 per cent yields some,
will not 20 per cent yield half as much! And is it nothing to
aid American labor, American industiy, and the boaste 1 Amen
can system—to restrict the use of foreign articles, such as are
grown or produced here, unless paying on them even a 5 rer
centtax? Muchmoie will u aid all domestic enterprise, if those
foreign articles are obliged to encounter not only the n«k, delay,
and expense of coming here acioss an ocean three thousand
miles, and a tax here of five per cent, while ours are free, but
a further tax of 10, 15, or 20 per cent
Let us hear no more, then, that no protection lesults incident
ally to American labor, if all foreign articles, coming in compe
tltion with it, are equally taxed for revenue 20 or 25 per c cut
Sucha tax, I grant is not imposed for the purpose ofprotec
tion; nor should it be, by the General Government But when
it is imposed for revenue, rather than to collect all revenue fiom
lands, excise, and other sources, incidental piot< ction is often
the consequence, and a very effective consequence, in aid of the
domestic production
In respect to another imputation made by the Senator, as to
the extravagance in expenses during a part of the period ot my
connexion with the Treasury Department, Mr W would only
remind him that Congiess caused and authorized the public
expenses, and not the executive depaitments If the Senator
could put his finger on a single case where the Treasury De
partment, during his administration of it, or where he, as a
member of this body since, had recommended extravagant
measures, lent be done    He was ready for the issue
And in respect to surpluses, to which the gentleman fiom
Kentucky had referred, let him remember that the only admin
istration of the treasury under which a dollar of surplus had
ever accrued and been paid over to the States, was under mine,
and that to the extent of moie than twenty eight millions of
dollars But he claimed no peculiar credit foi that, though it
put to flight all the imputations in respect to the want or waste
of surpluses
Mr CRITrENDEN made a brief explanation
Mr BAGBY rose,dndspokeforaconsiderabletimebeforehe
was distinctly understood in the gallery, in consequence of the
noise mthe senate, and the lowness of tone in which he spoke
When heard, he was undeistood todeny that any power, or the
slightest authority, could be found m the Constitution for this
doctrine of protection, either direct or incidental He ca ed to
the recollection of the Senate that, when this revenue bill v,„e
under consideiation a few weeks ago, and the Senatoi from
Pennsvlvama moved to stilke outlhe27lh section the gentle
men opposite declared that, sooner than forego distribution,
thev would let the Government and the Constitution «sell ¡ et
ish What, ho would ask, had produced such a revolution as
was now witnessed' What but the domination of a greater in
.«rest—that involved m the principle of protection  ihis, then,
was the mam object of this measure In this bill of abomina
tions from beginning to end of its 54 pages the ruling principle
was protection, and nothing but protectwn
On former occasions die Senator from Kentucky advocated
d.sttibution, as essential for the salvation of the h-ok n town
and bankrupt Governments of the indebted State Now he
has chanzej1 his ground, and insists that it is to go for the
educauo"fof the widows' sons, and the poor boys of ever- State
in the union If the compendium ofthe census be examined it
will be found that, in sevel al ofthe Sates their respec ive sha. es
would only amount to about one cent for each individual m the
State Yet, with this mighty fund, the Senate, from Kentucky

Gentlemen talked of this pi otective measure as one to neces
sary "bit it severed ties long Uieushed It might sever ties on
the opposite side, but he knew of none on his side so severed, but
with regard to the Senator from New York and the r-enator fr, m
Pennsylvania, (who were both, he understood, actu g un ler u.
-.miction,) they had no alternative, becauseithey cherished those
|irmciples which recognised the doctrine of instruction,
But when gentlemen were talking of severed ties, he hoped
they would not set down asamong the Democratic party their
own President, Mr Tyler. It was in vain to say they did not
know Ins principles and sentiments when they elected him It
was not as a Democrat he was elected, and he was now as
much a Whig as ever he was-%xcept that he respected his
obligations to the country The Senator from Connecticut
[Mr Smith] had never spoken a greater truth than when he
said this system of protection was calculated to break down
the proud sj hit of the American people, and to build up an
aristocracy of monopolists, supported and inflated by apauper
labor system, leduced to the lowest condition of human subsist
ence, that they might moie servilely contribute to the luxuries
of their task masters
This whole policy of protection, dn ect and incidental, was all
wrong its tendency was not to build upa race of Ameucan
freemen, but a race of American beggars and paupets, and to
make anstocrafic conditions and distinctions,
Under the influence of' Tippecanoe and Tyler too," gentle
men came into power Llwifli a rush," and what had they done
since? They say they begin to see daylight ahead This is
another instance of their infatuation If they could but «ee
themselves as others see them, instead of daylight ahead, they
would see naught but that darkness, to which the hell they suf
fer now is heaven Their game of heading Captain! yleris
now undeistood They have gambled and lost it—their game
is up
He had no doubt of the sincerity and patuotismof the Sena
tor from Rhode Island, and therefore he would say to him,
Take care how you teach any portion of the American people,
instead of relying on themselves, to rely upon the General Gov
erumenr for support The moment vou induce them to aban
don self reliance, you weaken self lespect and smooth the way
for them to become the slaves of power Their progress will be
onward to thatconsummation, and m the end, they will stand
the lowest of dependants Great principles never die Such
has been the course of that policy in other countues—such
would be us course m this He regretted that the Senator was
insensible to these great truths, if he were not he would see
thattheie could be no soundness .n the doctnne of protection
The Senator fiom Maiyland had stated that he would vote
agaiuflt this bill, because it abandoned distribution Without
any disiespect—for lit intended rone—he feL bound to say that
it was his prediction (foi he undeistood the game about to be
played) that just enough of the gentlemen opposite would vote
foi this bill to insure Its passage, and not one more
Mi CRITTENDEN rose merely to elucidate a calculation of
the Senator from Alabama That senaloi estimated that each
individual would get half • cent from distribution Ho under
stood—if he understood figures—that (ive millions of dollars,
brought into cents, would make five hundied millions of cents
He would ask Were there Ave hundred millions of boys in the
United S ates?
Mi BAG1SY estimated the I ind fund at its net pioreeds under
the piesentAdmimstiation, and th t was nit tnoie than half a
cent for each individual ot the population
Mi WILLIAMS said It is too l .te in the day, Ml President,
and the time of the Senate is too valuable to allow me to íeply
to smie lemaiks of the Senalol fioniAlabama [Mi   Baoby,]
gratuitously, and very unjustly describing I he char ictel and con
ditiou ofthe people ofNew England   Sir, the honoi able ¡senator
does not know that people or their condition, if he did   he
would not do them injustice     let the honoiaule Senatm visit
New England, and pass through het towns villages, and cities
and witness the industry, fiugality, and thuft of that people
then  he  might speak  with   some authority   and I am  sine
he would be constrained to think and speak of them very dif
ferently horn what he has now done    I invite him to sucha
test But it is not my pui pose to reply to the Senator, noi to con
sume the time of the ¡senate longer than may be necessaiy to
vindicate my course upon the bill under consideration and to
state the íeasons which impel me to that course    It is now
understood that the fue ofthe bill upon  hiciwt are about
to vote is very uncertun and may depend upon i single vote
hence each an 1 cv<n Senator should consider himself indiv id

consideration has induced me to reflect deeply and anxiously to

What would men of business  ol sound judgment and e\pe
lience, do lindel  such  cncum tancest   What would [ atn   «
loving'heir countiy moie than all thugs eke m sucha cusi-
do'   III loi mill  my own conclusion as to what I will do, I have
looked at the condition of the treasmy, which is empty, and
must be replenished to enable the Government to pay it  just
debts to Us unfortunate creditors
To the existing laws, if we have any, to justify the collection
of any duties I do not concur with many highly respectable
opinions, that there is not now any law authorizing the collec
tion of some duties, but I cannot shut my eyes to the fact that
all duties now collected are paid under protest, and that the
Government, ae well as very many of its citizens, are going m
to the law to determine iheir rights And here let me say that
the people of my State have had sad experience that the very
almission that then light, declared by this Government to be
perfect, was d sputed, and might be made a subject of refer
ence, has resulted in the abandonment and loss of that right.
The teveiiue from the sales of your land are now to be divided
among the States, the passage of the bill before us will suspend
that drain frcm your treasury, which will be highly satisfactory
to my State, as declaied by the resolutions of her Legislature.
If we look to the credit of the Government, and find it pros
tiated at home and abroad and corsidei how important it is to
lestore it, to enable the treasury to i eallze the loans which have
been authorized to meet the pressing demands upon It, all must
desire to do something and is not the bill before us the only
thing left to us, whn h can have that effect?
If we look beyond these halls upon the commercial, navi
gating, trading ai d manufacturing interests of the country, do
we not find them paralyzed and inactive, mainly from the un
certa nty wh ch h-ngs over the legislation, or want of legisla
tion, by Congress? Are not al! other branches of industry
affee'ed by the same cause? In view of all these considerations,
1 have brought my mind to the determination that I shall best
jieiform my duty to my constituents and to my country, by
withholding my opposition to the passage ofthe bill, andsuffei-
mg its fi lends to pass it In the event of my vote being necessary
to pass a bill so unacceptable to me as this is, I will give it,
lather than see this Congiess close its nine months' session
without making any provision for the support of a Government
deal to every Ameucan heart
In thus doing, I take a fearful responsibility My support is
a conviction that I am doing my duty to my country, and I
shall leturn to my constituents in the confidence that, if they
weie here, and called upon to act under the circumstances in
which I am acting, they would act as I do
If this bill shall become a law it will enable the Government
to continue its operations until the people shall have anot! er
opportunity of seleumg a„ems to rejiresent them in another
Congress and whatever is vvron<* in the provisions of the bill,
(and there is much of it,) may then be conected
Mr \\ III 1 L had some bing to say on this subject, but was
