HEADQUARTERS DEFENSES OF BERMUDA HUNDRED,April 3, 1865-9.30 p.m.

ASSISTANT ADJUTANT-GENERAL,

General Grant's Headquarters, in the Field:

I still keep at Chester Station the force of about 1,200 I reported as taking there this morning. Reconnaissance by it this afternoon in its front, covering the wagon road to Chesterfield Court-House, developed a line of vedettes and probably pickets, about two or three miles from it. Whether temporary to cover a halt, or permanent, and how far it extends, not ascertained. Deserters coming to and men captured by this command to-day amount to over 200. Enemy took all his guns from his line in my front except the heavy ones at Howlett Battery, on the James, and one rifle field piece.

GEO. L. HARTSUFF,
