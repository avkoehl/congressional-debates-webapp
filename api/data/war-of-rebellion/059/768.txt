@ Martin's division joined by transfer (effective total, 1,716; total present, 2,328; aggregate present and absent, 6,477.) Deducting effective total Martin's division (7,716) and Grigsby's brigade (747) in rear recruiting horses, and Roddey's brigade, transferred to Mississippi (1,050) equals 3,513, which, deducted from 5,598, shows the effective total of cavalry in the army to be 2,085.
