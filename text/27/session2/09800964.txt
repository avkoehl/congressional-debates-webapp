TREASURY NOTE BILL.i
Mr FILLMORE offered Ihe following resolu-
tion, and demanded the previous qnesiioi thereon:
Resolved That after the said bill No 607, to linW the sale
of the public stock to par and to aulhonze the issrM of tieas
ury notes m lieu thereof to a ceitam amount, shalwiave been
considered in Committee of the Whole House on the state of
the Union two houis, all debate shall cease, and the commit
tee shall proceed to vote on all amendments which may be
pending oi off led to said bill and then report the same to the
House, with such amendments as may have been agieed to by
said committee
The previous question was seconded
The main question was ordered, and, being taken,
the resolution was adopted
On motion of Mr FILLMORE ihe House re-
solved itself into Commi tee of the Whole on ihe
state of the Union, (Mr Joseph R Ihgebsoll of
Pennsylvania jn ihe chair) ana proceeded io the.
consideration cf the following bill:
AN ACT to limit the sale of Che public stock to par, and Io
authouze the issue of treasury'notes in heu thereof, to a
certain amount
Be it enacle t b / the Senate and House of Rept esenlalives
of the United Staler of America in Congress assembled,
That no slock au hor zed to be ls&ued 101 a loan by the act en
titled "An act aulhoilzing a loan not *excpedii," th sum of
twelve millions of dolíais" apprVjve^ July twtnty fit t, 1841,
and the act amendatory of the sam¿, entitled ' An act lor the
extension ol the lean of eighteen bundled at d loity one, ai d ioi
an addition ol five millions of dolíais thereto, and for allowing
imprest on treasuty notes due," approved A pi tl fifteenth, ]&1¿,
shall hereafter be sold below lai, and in ca-e the same eai not
be sold at or above par and the exigenciesof the public seivite
shall require the same, then, and in th u case, the Secietary ol
the Tieasury shall be and hereby is authorized to issue treas
ury notes m lieu of so much theieof as cannot be thus nego
tiated, to an amount not exceeding six millions ol dolíais
Sec 2 And belt Jurther enacted, That the titasuiy notes
authonzed to b" issued by vntueof this act shall not be jssut d

teenth day of Apnl, eighteen bundled and firty'hiee,) lor

and limitations C( ntamed m the act entitled 'An act to aulhor

by the act entitled An act id Hion il to the act on the &ul jeci

the tune above piesctibetl foi tsstn g the same Pronded,
Th it not mme than six million  in amount shall be outsland
ing at any one time ut uer the authority of this act
The bill having been iead,
Mr TILLINGHAST desired the attention of
Mr. Fhlmorb to a certain verbal error (which
was not understood by the report?r) m the print-
ing of Ihe rept rt accompanying the bill.
Mr FILLMORE, cnairman oí the Committee
of Ways and Means, who reported the bill, said he
had nothing to say with reference to this subject,
and (no gentleman indicator g a desire to address
the committee) he hoped the bill would be laid
aside to be reported to the House.
Mr WISE merely wished to ascertain whether
he understood correctly this bill. He believed it
piopced (and he wished Ihe chairman of the
Committee of Wajs and Means to correct bim if
he was mis-taken) to limit the sale of the s tck of
the loan at par, and in case it could not be sold at
par, it proposed the alternative of issuing treasury
notes to a certain amount, to supply the immediate
wants of Government.
He heartily approved of this for it was precise-
ly what he ha" contended for when ihe loan bill
was under consideration He was g'ad of it, and
he woald rect mmenri hi- colleague from tne Lou-
don disinct [Mr Powfh] now to amend his cir-
cular to his    onstituei ts.
Mr POWELL said, so far from that, he should
maintain the prn ciples, by Lis vote  here, whichhe
had laid down m that circular.
Mr. FlLLlWORE (in reply to Mr Wise) said
it would be perceived that the siiuaiion of ihe bill
had no connexion w th the situation ot the loan
bill when it passed. That was a case when, a
large amount of treasury notes having been au-
thonzed to be issued, because there wa1  no means
in ihe treasury to redeem tho e notes, they were
sinking in the maikct The bill provided for that
exigency, and restoied the ciedit cf the treasmy.
The question now was, whether they would per-
mit the stcck to be sacrificed, when there wai no
means ot issuing treasury notes.
Mr WM.C JOHNSON addressed an inqui-
ry to Mr. Fillmore, which was not heard by the
reporter
Mr FILLMORE For the purpose of avudmg
the ev Is of ihe •sale ol tne stock below par, this b i[
authorizes the issuing treasury notes to the amount
of f 6,0ü0 000.
Af er s-ome remaiks from Mr. BARNARD—
Mr FILLMORE said it was perhaps nfcts ary,
after whai had been said to siat  ihr groun4s on
which the Committee of Ways and fVeans had
proceeded , and, if he could get the ear of the
House, he would slate a few fac s, wh ch seemed
necessary to be undersold, in older to undeisland
the importance of this measure
First Thev had authorized at the extra session
a han of $13,000 flOO of which there- w?s taken,
in round numbers, §5 439,000, 1 avmg at tne eom-
merc ment of th s se su n, i f ihat amount, jet un-
taktn, §6 478 000. Thev had added to ihiit ,i loan
of §5 000 000 more, mukin" in all, authorized at
the pre em session $11,478 000 Of ihis amount,
thus Kuthonzf d ai ihe p esent sfssion, there v.as
already negotiated $1836 000, leaving of that
loan yet to be t«sktn, $9,642,000, or about po 000,-
000, now authorized to be taken.
Mr SPR1GG made an inquiry, which was not
heard by the reprrter
Mr FILLMORE. So far as nesotiM'on went,
most of it was negt Hated at ntneiy seven anda
half cenis on the (Jollai; the remainder of it (a small
portion) was taken at par.
Tbe present liabilities of the Government (Mr.
F ron'mued) were, a wefk ago last Sa uid^y,
$3 875 000, which v ere prevent demands, and fop
which the Government wa  liable to be e lied en
at any moment, and to meet th se demands no oie
dollar w?s available. There wns a small amount
of money in the treasury, to be sure, Lut n t m, re
than enough to meet the dpmands for trust funds
and ft r the public dtbt. Therefore, the qut spon
had presented itself io the considerann if the
commutee, whe'her, when tieie was a present na-
bih'y ot a'most $4 000,000 on he treasury, and
when there t ds authority to sell tt is stock almost
to an jmouni of §10,000 000, at any aiscr u> t the
Secretar) of the Treasury saw fit, was it advisable
to permit the slock to b<? s,unficed to me S1!}licks
of th -country, without off«nng seme altera? ¡ve to
Iht Stcretpiy by which to meet these habih esf
wuhout subjecting h mself to <o great a shave?
The committee had concluded (hat it vas un-
reasonable to force this large amoun* of ücclr on
the market at this time, and c< mpel the Seere ary
of the Treasury to submil to any exacuns that
might be forced on him by money-lent'ers, without
having some alternative. The fir t qupsmn, there-
fore, was, whether they would limit th« loan to a
certain discount telow rs ppr value It was ob-
vious that, if this were done, it would instarily
strike the stock down to that point in the crun ry.
They had, therefore, considered that it was ueees-
sary lo limit it, and, if it were limited at all, any
other mode would but discredit our own stt ck in
market; and thy had tht ught it unreasmable
either to discredit our stock in market, by ñxme the
mínimum at which n should be sold, or permitting
the Secretan of the Treasury to go into market
and «ell at the best pnc«« be could obtain.
The committee bad thought it injurious to the
tnasurj to suffer the stork lo be'old below par,
when, if tne tariff bul pa.sed (wh ch they hoped
wou'd si on take flare,) it would come up, thnt it
wrull be injurious to fa(se who t ad herd fore
tikeu our s ock; and that n would b injurious to
all the s ocks t f ihe st veral States of the Union,
that the United States stock here should be suffered
