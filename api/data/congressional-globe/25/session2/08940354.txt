Indian Hostilities—Mr. Benton.
Senate.
the United States to adjust Indian difficulties gene-
rally, was then beyond the Mississippi, and these
commissioners were directed to join in the negotia-
tions, on the part of the United States, and to give
the sanction of oui guarantee to the agreements
made between the Seminóles and the Creeks for
the repmon oí the former to the parent tribe.
This was done. Our commissioners, Messrs
Stokes, Ellsworth, and Schermerhorn, became
party to a treaty with the Creek Indians for the re-
union of the Seminóles, made at Fort Gibson the
14th of February, 1833. The treaty contained this
article-
"AkTict e iv It is understood and agreed that the Seminole
Indians ol Florida, whose removal (o this country is provided
fin by then treaty with the United States, dated May 9, 1832,
«had also have a permanent and comfortaole nomeon the lands
herdiy set apart as the country of the Creek nation, and they,
the Seminole", willheieaftei be considered as a constituent pan
ot the said nation but are to be located on some part oí the
Creek country by themselves, which location shall be selected
fot them by the commissioners who have seen these ai tides of
agreement"
This agreement with the Creeks settled one of
the conditions on which the removal of the Semi-
nóles was to depend. We will now see how the
other condition wai disposed of.
In a treaty made at the same Port Gibson, on
the 28th of March, 1833, between the same three
rcmmissioneis on the part of the United States,
and tne seven delegated Seminole chiefs, after
reciting the tv o conditions precedent contained m
the Payne's Landing treaty, and reciting, also, the
convention with the Creeks on the 14th of Febiuary
preceding, it is thus stipuhted
' Now, theiefoie, the co n t ssioneis aforesaid, by virtue of
the power and authontv tes'cd m them by the tieaty made
with the Cicek Indians on the Uthof February, ic33 asabove

THr-visrivrs wi ix satisfied with the i oca
HON PROVIDED TOR THLM BY THE COMMISSION
ERS, and agree that their nation shall commence the i emo
xal to their-new home as soon tr? the Government will moke
the arrangements for their emigration satnf ictoty the
Seminole nation "
This treaty is signed by the delegation, and by
the commissioners of the United States, and wit-
nessed, among others, by the same Major Phagan,
agent, and Abraham, interpreta, whose presence
was stipulated for at Pa3ne's Landing
Thus the tn o conditions, on which ihe removal
depended, were complied with, they were both
established in the affirmative The Creeks, under
the solemn sanction and guarantee of the United
States, agree to receive back the Seminóles as a
part of their confederacv, and agree that they shall
live adjoining them on lands designated for their
residence The delegation declare themselves well
satisfied with the country assigned them, and agree
ihat the removal should commence as soon as the
United States could make the necessary arrange-
ments for the removal of the people.
This brings down the proof to the conclusion of
all questions beyond the Mississippi, it brings it
down to the conclusion of the treaty at Fort Gib-
son—that treaty m which the Senator fiom New
Jeisey [Mr. Southard] has located the charge of
fraud, after withdrawing the same charge from the
Payne's Landing treaty It brings us to the end of
the negotiations at the point selected for the charge,
tint! now how stands the accusation? How stands
the chai ge of fiaud? Is there a shadow, an atom,
a «peck, of foundation on which to rest if* No, sir
Nothing—Nothing—Notlvng' Every thing was
done that was stipulated for, done by the persons
who were to do it, and done m the exact manner
agreed upon. In fact, the natuie of the things to
be done west of the Mississippi was such as not to
admit of fraud Two things were to be done, one
io be seen with the eyes, and the other to be heard
with the ears The deputation was to see theirnew
country, and say whether they liked it This was
a question to their own senses—to their own eyes
—and was not susceptib'e of fraud They were to
hear whether the Creeks would receive them back
as a part of their confederacy, this was a question
Io iheir own ems, and was also unsusceptible of
fraud.   Their own eyes could not deceive them in
looking at land; their own ears could not deceive
them in listening to their own language from the
Creeks. No, sir. there was no physical capacity,
or moral means, for the perpetration of fraud;
and none has ever been pretended by the In-
dians from that day to this. The Indians
themselves have never thought of such a
thing. There is no assumption of a de-
ceived party among them. It is not a de-
ceived party that is at war—a party deceived by
the delegation which went to the West—but that
very delegation itself, with the exception of
Charley Emarthla, are the hostile leaders at home1
This is reducing the accusation to an absurdity
It is making the dslegation the dupes of their
own eyes and of their own ears, and then going to
war with the United States, because their own
eyes deceived^them in looking at land on the Cana-
dian river, and their own ears deceived them in
listening to their own language from the Creeks,
and then charging these frauds upon the United
States. A'l this is absurd, and it is due to these
absent savages to say that they nevei committed
any such a1 si.hu v—that they never placed their
objection n ,e> \p upon any plea of deception
practiced u|              i beyond the Mississippi, but
onfmolous              s   a vented long after the íe-
Uun of in do r , which pretexts covered the
leal ';rouu K i „ oi < ot the influence of run-
away sl.v e ma ir"e evilly disposed chiefs, and
that thirst <. ' ¡m J plund-r, in which they
expected a 'oil  -<. ur e of enjo>ment and impunity
in their swamps, believed to be impenetrable to the
whites.
Thus, sir, it is clearly and fully proved that there
was no fraud practised upon these Indians, that
hey themselves never pretended such a thing, and
mat the aecus-i'ion is wholly a charge of recent
origin spiung up among ourselves Having shown
ihat there was no fraud, this might be sufficient
for the occasion, but having been forced into the
inquiry, it may be as well to complete it by show-
ing what weie the causes of this war. To under-
stand these causes, it is necessary to recur to dates,
to see the exu<sme mod -ration with which the Uni-
ted States actid, the hu g time which they tolerated
Ihe delays of the Indiars, and the treachery and
murder wilh which their indulgence and forbear-
ance was requited. The emigration was to com-
mence m W), and be completed in the years 1834
and 1835. The last days of the last month of this
last year had amved, and the emigration had not
yet commenced. Wholly intent on their peacea-
ble removal, the Administration had despatched a
disbursing agenl, Lieutenant Harris of the army,
to take charge of the expenditures for the subsist-
ence of these people He arrived at Port King on
the afternoon of the 28th of December, 1835, and
as he entered the fort, he became almost an eye wit-
ness of a horrid scene which was the subject of his
first despatch to his Government He derribes it
in these words

of the two companies (under Major Dade) which had buen
ordered up from Fort Brooke, and of whom we team
nothing "
Sir, this is the-first letter of the disbursing ageBt,
specially detached to furnish the supplies to the
emigrating Indians. He arrives m the midst of
treaeheiy and murder; and his first letter is to an-
nounce to the Government the assassination of
their agent, an officer of artillery, and five citizens;
the assassination of two expresses, for they were
both waylaid and murdered, and the massacre of
one hundred and twelve men and officers under
Major Dade. All this took place at once, and this
was the beginning of the war. Up to that mo-
ment the Government of the United States were
wholly employed in preparing the Indians for re-
moval, recommending them to go, and using no
force or violence upon them This is the way the
war was brought on, this is the way it began, and
was there ever a case m which a Government was
so loudly called upon U avenge the dead, to pro-
tect the living, and to cause itself to b¿ respected
by punishing the contemners of its power? The
murder of the agent was a double offence, a pecu-
liar outrage to the Government wnose representa-
tive he was, and a violation even of the national
law of savages. Agents -ire seldom murdered even
by savages, and bound as every Government is to
protect all its citizens, it is doubly bound to protect
its agents and representatives abroad Here, then,
is a Government agent, and a military officer, five
citizens, two expresses, and a detachment of one
'■undred and twelve men, m all one hundred and
twenty-one persons, treacherously antl inhumanly
massacred in one day' and because General Jack-
son's administration did not submit to this horrid
outrage, he is charged with the guilt of a war
founded in fraud upon innocent and unoffending
Indians1 Such is the spirit of opposition to our
own Government' such the love of Indians and
contempt of whites' and such the mawkish senti-
mentality of the day in which we lite—a sentimen-
tality which goes moping and sorrowing about m
behalf of imaginary wrongs to Indians and ne-
gioes, while the whites themsehes are the subject
of murder, robbery and defamation
The prime mover m all this mischief, and the
leading agent in the most atrocious scene of it, was
a half blood Indian of little note before this time,
and of no consequence m the councils of his tribe,
for his name is not to be seen m the treaty either of
Payne's Landing or Fort Gibson We call him
Powell, by his tribe he was called CKceola. He lead
the attack in the massacre of tne agent, and of
those who were killed with him, in the afternoon of
the 28th of December The disbursing agent,
whose letter has been read, in his account of that
massacre, applies the epithet traitor to the name cf
this Powell Well might he apply that epithet to
that assassin, for he had just been fed and caressed
by the very person ttnom he waylaid and mur-
dered. He had come into the agency shortly be-
fore that time with seventy of his followers, pro-
fessed his satisfaction with the treaty, his reaciness
to remove, and received subsislence and supplies
for himself and all his party The most friendly
relations seemed to be established, and the doomed
and deceived agent, in giving his account of it to
the Government, says " The result uas that tve
closed wilh the utmost good feeling, and I have never
seen Powell and the other chiefs  o cheerJtU and m so
fine a humor, at the close of a discussion upon the sub'
ject of i emoval "
This is Powell, for whom all oui sympathies are
so pathetically invoked' a treacherous assassin, net
only of our people, but of his own—for he it was
who waylaid, and shot m the back, in the most
cowardly manner, the brave chief ¡Chttrley hmarlhla,
whom he dared not face, and whom he thus assas-
sinated because he refused to join him and his run-
away negroes m murdering the white people The
collector of Indian curiosities and portraits, Mr
Catlm, may be permitted to manufacture a hero
out of this assassin, and to make a poetical scene
of his imprisonment on Sullivan's island, but it
will not do for an American Senalor to take the
same liberties with historical truth and our national
character Powell ought to have been hung for
the assassination of General Thompson, and the
