country hi the day of its danger, and seek protec-
tion, like the Grecian Themistocles, vr^ the ene-
my of his country, and throw himself istto the arms
of the Persian monarch, and exert ths mighty ener-
gies of his mind, in conjunction with that enemy,
to supplant the institutions of his native land, even
should that enemy giye him "a Magnesia for his
bread, a Myus for his meat, or a Lampsachus for
his wine."
I have, Mr. President, noted some of the objec-
tions which have been made to the bill reported
from the committee, and I have endpavored to an-
swer those objections. There are still other objec-
tions which the Senator fiom Virginia has urged
against this measure, which I may have occasion
to consider after I shall bestow upon his substitute
a passing notice , and in the outset I freely admit,
that it must have required no inconsiderable degree
of moral courage to bring forward, at this calami-
tous period oí our history, a measure intending
practically to revive a system which has been the
fruitful source of the calamities which, as a nation
and as individuals, we are now suffering I pur-
pose ,to examine the details of the proposed amend-
ment, in order to show that, so far from its being
any improvement of the bill of 1836, it is more
objectionable, that it throws around the Slate depo-
site banks (which, under this amendment, are to
be selected) no sufficient guards for the safe-keep-
ing of the public funds, but commits to their custo-
dy the whole revenues of the Government, relying
on the honor and integrity of these depositories lor
the forthcoming of the people's money.
I have, with as much time and attention as I
could devote to the consideration of this substitute,
examined it in its various details, and I must con-
fess that I have not yet been able to understand
some of us provisions, when comparing them with
the existing provisions of the act of June 23, 1836
It is perfectly apparent, from the phraseology of
the fourteenth section of this amendment, that the
Senator from Virginia does not contemplate a total
repeal of the act of 1836 That section is in these
words: " That all acts and parts of acts coming
withm the purview of this act, are hereby re-
pealed."
The first section of the amendment declares
" That the number of banks authorized by the act
of June 23, 1836, to be employed as depositories
of the public money, shall not exceed twenty-five
—to be selected with reference to the wants and
convenience of the Treasury in conducting its lis
cal operations "
By the first section of the act of June, 183 6, the
Secretary of the Treasury is required to select for
public depositories such of the banks, incorporated
by the several States, and by Congress for the Dis-
trict of Columbia, or by the Legislative Councils of
the respective Territories for the said Territories,
as may be located at, or convenient to, the places
where the revenue may be collected and disbursed,
and in the proviso to said section, it is expressly de-
clared that at least one deposite bank shall be se-
lected in each State and Temtory, if one cm te
found in each State and Termor) willing to be em-
ployed as a deposite bank I can hardly suppose
that the Senator from Viigmia intended to prohibit
the Secretary fiom making at least a selection of
one bank m each State and Territory, because, in
the several States and in each of the Territories,
portions of the public revenue are collected and dis-
bursed In the Territory of Wisconsin, large sums
are collected from the sales of the public lands, and
in each of the States and Territories mole or less
of the public money is annually disbursed for
the necessary support of the Government in the
payment of Us officers, and in the discharge of its
labilities to the public creditors If, then, s r, the
State bank deposite system is to be revived by the
express legislation of Congress, I trust that the Se-
nator, if he designs to repeal the act of 1836, will
so modify h s proposition as to give an undoubted
power to select at least one deposite bank in each
Slate and Territory, but if the last section of the
amendment only repeals so much of other acts as
conflicts with this, it will leave in force the provi-
sion authorising the Secretary of the Treasury to
select one bank m each State and Territory, and
also, that where there are no banks in States wilhm
which the public collections or disbursements re-
quires depository, to make arrangements with a bank
or banks in some other State, Territory, oi District,
to establish an agency oi agencies in the States,
Territories, or Districts so destitute of banks. And
the amendment also leaves m full force the provi-
sion which prohibits the Secretary of the Treasury
" from suffering to remain m any deposite bank an
amount of the public moneys more than a sum
equal to three-fourths of the amount of its capital
actually paid m "
It certainly may be questioned if the Senator
contemplated an entire and unqualified repeal
of the deposite act of June, 1836, whether this
important restriction of suffering to remain in de-
posite any more of the public money than a sum
equal to three-foui ths of the capital stock of the
deposite banks, can even apply to the twenty-five
banks to be selected If the Senatoi designs his
substitute as a mere addition to the deposite act of
June, 1836, many of the difficulties which now oc-
cur to my mind, regaiding the amendment as a
new and independent system, would be avoided
The second section of the honorable Senatoi's
amendment contains substantially the third and
fifth sections of the act of June, 1836, with one
essential addition, that the fifth section of the old
law prohibited the Secretary of the Treasuiy from
selecting oi continuing any bank as a deposite
bank, which shall not redeem its notes and bills on
demand with specie The second section of the
substitute extends the piohibition to all banks
which shall not pay all demands against it prompt-
ly in specie, when required. The third section of
this amendment is entirely new, so far as it goes
to requne the resolution of both Houses of Con-
gress to give effect to any selection of a deposite
bank, which the Secretary may think proper to
make. This provision is intended by the honoio-
ble Senator to check Executive usurpation, and to
control Executive patronage
But this particular provision is not only most e\~
traordmaiy in its characlei, but unprecedented m
the history of our legislation The Executive
branch of the Government, m relation to all
appointments of the highest íesponsibility, is re-
quired to present them for the confirmation of the
Senate From the first judicial officer in our country,
down tothatof a deputy-postmaster, whose annual
receipt shall exceed i thousand dollars, the Senate of
the United States, under the Constitution and the Ian,
alone has power to control Executive nominations
The collectors of your revenue, the receivers at
your land offices, the treasurers of your mints, can
only be appointed with the advice and consent of
the Senate of the United States But under this.
amendment, the places where these collectors and
receiveis shall make deposite of the public money,
must be «elected by the Executive, not only with
the advice and consent of the Senate, but with
that also of the House of Representatives Here
is a new addition to the appointing power The
popular branch of our Go/eminent is tobe clothed
with Executive lutlioiity That bianch neatest
to the people, and which ought, according to the
doctune < f the Senator from Kentucky, to origi-
nate all important measures ol a legislative cha-
racter, i" by this amendment to be e.'othed wi'h
power to execute the law The Senitp and House
of Repieseatatives is to become not only the la v
making power, hut m conjunction with Ihe Secre-
tary of thi" Treasury, the law executing power
I cannot Mr President, give to this proposition
mysuppoit To my mind it is extiemely objtc-
tionable, and calculated to produce great embai-
rassment and confusion I would asu the Senator
from Virginia, (in the event of his substitute be-
coming the la  of the Ian 1,) that if the Secretary
should select the Manhattan Bank, in the city A
New York, ^s a deposite bank, and Congress
should be in session, and the Senate, bv its resolu-
tion, a¡ prove, and the House should disapprove,
of the election—suppo e that this selection should
become matter of a proti acted discussion, what is
to be done vv th the puolic money collected in th it
city in the interim' Suppose that the p Jitics of
New York should not happen at the time to pass
current m the popular branch of the Government,
and that no selection could be made i.i that city oí
a deposite bank, which would receive the approba-
tion of the House of Representatives, what would
be done with the public money under such circum-
stances' Suppose that precisely the same thing
should happen to any selection of a deposite batik
in the city of Baltimore, what would-the honorable
Senator have done with the public money collected
and disbursed at those places where " the wants
and convenience of the Treasury In conducting its
fiscal operations" would seem to demand the de-
posite of a portion of the public money i I can tell
the Senator what might happen; for it wjdl be
observed that he has not located his twenty-five
deposite banks They are to be located, m effect,
wherever the Senate rmd the House of Rcpi esen-
tatives conjointly shall determine. The action of
the two Houses might compel the Seei etary oJ the
Treasury to select deposite banks m the city of
Philadelphia, to the exclusion-of the banks of the
cities of New York and Baltimore, Let there be
a majority of the House of Representatives, or
of the Senate opposed to the Executive, let
there he a Senate and a House ot the same
political character as distinguished those be dies
m the session of Congress in 1833 and 1834,
and what could prevent the selection of the
Bank of the United States chartered by the State
of Pennsylvania, with its branches established, and
to be established, as the exclusive depositories of
the public money. I know that the Senator frem.
Vngima could noi have bad that purpose in
his mind at the time he prepared the amend-
ment which he has presented. But it has
occurred to my mind that the adoption of this third
section of the Senator's amendment may lead, for
all practical purposes, to ihe recharter of the Bank
of the United States That it may lead, and m all
probability will lead, to give full employment to
that institution, its branches, and to tho«e agencies
which shall be established m the several States and
Teriitorics under its authority, and bj its sanction.
The moment, sir, that I heard the Senator fiom
Massachusetts say that he should piefei the Sta e
bank deposite system—that he should prefer any
thing, or even nothing, to the bill reported by
the Committee on Finance—sentiments directly
conflicting with opinions expressed by him at the
extra session of Congress, when nothing was so ob-
jectionable to his mmd as this State bank deposite
system, and the moment I read this third section
of the amendment proposed by the Senator from
Virginia, I could not but imagine that, when the
Senator from Massachusetts gave utterance to his
opinion, that he must have been perfectly aware of
the true import and tendency of this third section.
Sir, would not the honorable Senator from Ken-
tucky, and the honorable Senator from Massachu-
setts, the great champions foi the establishment of a
Bank of the Umied States, be peifectiy satisfied
with the adoption of this entire amendment, if they
could believe that its adoption would le?ci to the
se'ection of the present Bank of the Umlel States
and its branches as the depositones of the publ c
money'    CcUaudy they wouhl
It is of no use to talk about renewing the
charter of the Bank of the United States, by a di-
lect aig of Congress, if, by mduection, the same
thing can be obtained That bank, under its char-
ter from the State of Pennsylvania, has authority
to establish branches in other States with their ap-
pr ibation Establish this State bank deposite sys-
tem, ind no difficulty would be expeuenced by the
bank in mulhp'jmg its branches, with the under-
standing that such branches would control the pub-
lic deposites which it might be necessary to make
in the States vihere such branches would be esta-
blished
Notwithstandng the Senator from Ma"=ichusetts
said, in this hill, in February, 1 35 "I -u he
considere 1 the question of renewing the bi i chai-
tei as entirely settled, that the people had decided
against its continuance, and it must expiie. Not-
withstanding this frank and full declaration, the
Senator will now come to thesuppoitof the amend-
ment of th<= Senator from Virginia, which, if lean.
compienend the signs of the times, may lead, for
all practical purposes, it the proposed amendment
should be adopte 1, to a renewal ot the Bank of the
United States.    The capital oi that bank will give
