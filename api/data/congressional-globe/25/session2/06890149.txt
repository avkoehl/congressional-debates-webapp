ted by changing the French system for that of ihe
English
While upon this part of the subject, I will
add that the banks after all impose upon the
peop'e of this country the most onerous tax
they pay. A slight examination of the terms upon
which the banks supply us with cunency will be
full of instruction. Before we enter upon this in-
vestigation, it rarot be received as a proposition in
political economj, fully susceptible ot demonstra-
tion, that he who tills the earth, or digs the roe til
out of it, fanasnes the bisis. of all value , <Mid ¡a
whatevei state oi wherever va'ues or piopertj are
ultimately found, to one of these sources we must
look as the original means of its possesion In
whose hand soevei real money is found it vvpí ori-
ginally levied upon the Ubor of the taiuci oi the
agriculturist, or upon whit are called the produc-
tive elates I will now proceed to take lor exam-
ple the State of North Carolina, and will suppose
that six million , of dolíais oí caculating medium
are necessary for hei purposes, and, in order lo test
the matter fairly, will suppose farthei that she his
not within her borders one dollar of circulating me-
dium Now, aecoiding to the modern ideis upon
this subject, there are two modes in which the ne-
cessary supply may be obtained, supposing her to
have the necessary quantity of surplus produce
The one is by the incorporation of a bank and
making use ot a paper medium The other is by
conceiting her pro luce into speaie in a foreign mai-
ket, and bringing that specie home Let us try the
first pioress.and upposea bank to bechartercd with
a capital stock oí two millions ot dolíais oí this we
will suppose about 10 per cent to be pai I in specie
into the ban it, that is to say, |200,U0O, hi foro the
bank is allow c a to u to op ration Hi it immuit
is obtained by loan from abroad, or m some other
way, by ihp individual stockholder, but it is fairly
paid in, and the bank is now ready to commence
operations The different iaimci- of the country
bring together at a giv  n time, two millions' worth
oí produce at the diffeient market towns of the
State, and offer it to the merchants (or sale The
merchants ■say to ihem, "you are well awaie, gen-
tlemen, that there is not a dollar of money m the
whole State of North Carohm, except what is m
the vaults ot the bank, and, ot course, we have
none with which we can p\j y< u loi your produce
But lfjou consent to consider us the pincha crs of
your pioduce, and will take payment hi it
in bank notes, the matter can be airan^ed,
for we can sell our bills, drawn upon the
faith of this produce, to the binks, for which they
will pay us out their notes, " The air-vngement
is made, and the banks accordingly throw into cir-
culation two millions ol dollar in then notes For
thc e they have leceived the repieientatives of so
much specie, and which they considei to a specie
fund, and are thereby placed in a situation lo issue
four millions more in then notes upon the discount
of promivsary note-., (foi three p„per doll irs in cir-
culation, for one dollai m spec ie, or spent lands m
their possession, is not be ond the limits of the
most prudent banking) and thus the whole six mil-
lions ot circulation is furmshe 1 by the bank But
who has furnished Ihe leal capital upon which tins
whole process is bot'omed? Why the fanners,
surelv, who have supplied the produce, tnd not the
manufacturers of papel, who cb-ige the commu-
nity as it they had furnished the subs'ance, and
not the shadow only For it is vety certiui, that
m one way and another, they levy upon the com-
munity, at the very lowest, at the rate of six per
centum per annum for the amount of paper so
furnished by them This, it will be at once seen,
amounts lo three hundred and sixty thousand dol-
lars per annum Now this, as I have already said,
comes out of the pioluc.ive classes, who,let «ho
will dance, ultimately and invariably pay the pipe.
If will thus be seen upon the United States at large,
whlre aboufone hundred millions of th s paper
currency is furnished, six millions of dollars at
least is levied, Let us now try the other piocess,
Md suppose the credit given by the farmer to the
merchant, who only awaits the return oí Ihe pro-
ceeds of his cargo, which we may calculate, on an
average at six months, and we have the interest ot
two mil ions of dollars for that peiiod, amounting
to sixty thousand dollars, and by repeaung the
process thrice, so as to command an equal amount
of circulating medium, you have one hundred and
eighty thousand dollars, half the expense, and a
currency of real substantial and abiding value. So
much for the comparative cheapness of the lade-
pendent Treasury and fiscal agency of banks.
But the highest claim, 'after all, which the origi-
nal bill has over the substitute, is, that the one is in
strict conformity with the letter and spirit of the
Constitution, while the other violates both. The
first clause of the eighth section of the first article
of the Constitution declares " The Congress shall
have power to lay and collect taxes, duties, im-
posts, and excises " For what purpose- " To pay
the debts, and provide for the common defence and
general welfare, of the United States," etc. But
some time must, of course, intervene between the
said collection and the application of the money to
the purposes for which it was so íaised, and the
question is, what u  to become of it in the mean
time? The Constitution informs us, in the sixth
clause of the ninth section "No money shall be
drawn from the Treasury but in consequence of
ajipiopnations made by law," etc In the Trea-
sury, then, the money must be placed when raised
Tiue, the Constitution does not so directly declare,
hat it says it shall not be drawn thence; and
surely the mteidiction against its withdrawal dis-
tinctly implies that it must be there placed And
can any one, I ask, imagine that the Treasury m
contemplat.on was a bank1 If such a thing was
in contemplation, it was easy to have so declared,
but it was not so declared It ts not said money
shall not be diawn out ol the United States Bank,
oi the deposite bank, but out of the Tieasury, and
we learn by the debates in convention that the fra-
mers of the Constitution were not ignorant of
hanks, but purposely declined granting to Conjress
the powei of chartering one But the word Trea-
sury had a plain and significant meaning, under-
stood by eveiy one as a place where individuals or
communities kept their treasure, and in that plain,
popular sense was used.
But allow, for the sake of the argument, that the Go-
vernment might, in the general meaning of the word
Tr< asurj .elect to make a bmk such Treasury, yet
surd), under the clause I have just read, it could
n )t mil e such bank the Treasury by a general
dt posite, lor, whether the Treasurer be the cashier
ol a bank, oi whatever complication of character
raiy belong to him, he cannot withdraw money
from the Treasury but in consequence of appro-
priations made by law Will it be said that a
pcnerdl authority granted by Congress to Ihe cashier
to withdraw and replace money in the Treasury, is
an appropriation made by law- Does not such an
interpolation leduce the provision to an empty
sound, and repeal it as to all substantial operation?
But it may be said that the specific authority to
lend out the money is an apptcpnation made by
law Fiom whence does Congiess derive the
mlhority to make such an appropriation? The
purposes for which Congress is authorised to col-
led revenue, are expiessly set forth m the fiist
clatw of the eighth section of the hist article "to
pai the debts, and provide foi the common defence
md general welfaie of the United States." To
lend money is not one of them It will be said
that, having the money, we have a right to lend it
This tight is exceedingly doubtful, but grant it to
( xist, the substitute not only proposes to lend the
money which you now have, but all that you shall
heieaftei raise, and places the same, ere yet it is
íaised, in the very process of getting to jou, in the
hands   of  banks   to be  lent out
There is yet another part of the Constitu-
tion standing directly in the way of the
proposed substitute, to wit the latter part of
the first clause of the eighth section of the
first article "But duties, imposts, and excises,
shall be uniform throughout the United States "
Now, is not the effect of the substitute entirely to
destroy this provision' Grant that there is a uni-
formity m the original levy and collection, is not
the effect of uniformity enmely done away if the
revenue is immediately distnbuted by way of loan,
in unequal proportions, among the different States
of the Union.   Suppose, for instance, ten gentle-
men were to go to a boarding house in this city,
and say to the landlord or landlady, as the case
might be, "We all desire to have equal fare, and to
be charged at the same rate " "Certainly," is the
reply, "you shall all have the same fare and be
charged at the same rate," and the bargain is ac-
cordingly closed. It turns out, however, in. the
event, that the landlord has stipulated with one of
the guests to lend him out of the ten dollars agreed
to be paid weekly, seven dollars, to another five,
to another three, and to another one, without inte-
rest, and this for the whole time they remain
boarders at his house; that is to say, to make
the same return weekly for which they would
give their notes, which the landlord stipulates
with them shall be treated by him as so much gold
and silver Will any one pretend the parties had
been treated with the stipulated impartiality' Clear-
ly not, and so in a much more absolute sense is
this stipulation of equality in the Constitution vio-
lated by  the operation   of the deposite system.
Again it is declared in the 5th clause of the 9th
section of the 1st article that "no preference shall
be given by any regulation of commerce or re-
venue to the ports of one Stite over those of ano-
ther " And can any one doubt that the revenue
regulations of the General Government hitherto
acted upon, and those proposed to be adopted by
the substitute of the Senator from Virginia has, and
will have, the effect of giving decided advantages to
the ports of one State over those of another? Have
they not and will they not, paralyze the commerce
of the Southern States, and give more vigor to that
of a favored few at the North? To any one who
does not see this, it is useless to address argument
Our whole system of Government is based upon
principles of equality, and these principles have al-
Wiys been more or less violated in it  administra-
tion But the substitute proposes a violation even
greater than has yet been practised. Even the
United States Bank might locate a branch in any
State desiring it; and under the deposite law of
1836, the Secretary of the Treasury was not re-
stricted to any State for the choice of banks, nor
to any given number of banks in any one Slate.
But we have, by the piovisions of the substitute,
the system of equality completely subverted, and
the power of the large States magnified, and that
of the small ones diminished In the first place,
the banks are limited to twenty-live, so that one
State of the Union must of necessity be excluded
from any participation in the real or imaginary
benefits of this arrangement, and only twenty-five
banks out of the hundred  in the Union are al-
lowed to share it This will be a pet bank sys-
tem with a vengeance And what is w orse, the
selection of these banks is to be committed m part to
Congress, where the large Stales, in one branch at
least, have a most decided advantage Truly is
the principle of equality altogether ovei looked jn
this measure But there is another clause of the
Constitution standing in the way of the adoption of
the substitute, (for it runs counter to a whole
phalanx of constitutional provisions,) and that is a
portion of the 2d clause 2d section of the 3d article,
"he, [the President,] shall nominate, and by and
with the advice and consent of the Senate, shall
appoint, ambassadors, other public ministers and
consul', judge  of the Supreme Court, ana
all other officers of the United States," &c
Now, waiving the question raised by my col-
league, whether corporations are competent to be
chosen officers of the Government, (and I do not
say that the objection is not a valid one,) it seems
to me evident, from thisclause of the Constitution,
that whether the officer be an individual or corpo-
ration, he can only be appointed by the Pi esident, by
and with the consent of the Senate, or by the Pre-
sident alone, or the heads of Departments, if they
shall be vested by law with that power. And yet the
substitute proposes that banks shall be selected as
fiscal agents of the Gov ernment by Congress, con-
trary to the letter of the Constitution, and its mani-
fest policy.
Whether receiving paper m payment of the pub-
lic dues, be a direct violation of the Constitution,
as ins sted by the Senator from South Carolina'
[Mr Calhoun,] or not, it ought, at any rate, to ie-
ceive no sanction from Congress because, in the
