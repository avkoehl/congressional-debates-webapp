Mr J Q, AD 4MS asked what was the mean
mg, force, and effect of the wot ds et cetera, in

of no effect, and moved to stnkeitout, which was
agreed to

izing the settlement of the claim of Colonel Thayer,
foi the purchase of philosophical appaiatus for the
academy, under an order from the Secretary of
War, which was agreed to
Mr THOMAS moved an amendment, provid-
ing that the benefit of the act shall not extend to
any cadet who shall not graduate, or who, having
gidduated, shall not serve fWe years m the armv
This subject, he said, was to prevent young men
from going to the academy foi the purpose of an
education at the public expense, without m'ending
to devo e themselves to the public service
Mr EWING said, that if the object of the gen-
tleman was to destroy the institution, it could not
be better attained in any way than this The West
was now beginning to derive some benefit from the
academy
Mr THOMAS withdrew the amendment for
the present m order to modify it
Mr DICKINSON of Tennessee, spokeagamst
tie geneial pnnciple and policy of the bill If we
were suriounded by hosfle nations, as Austria or
Prussia is, we might need such an institution, but
tnis would nevei be the case, until the Union was
dissolved He was opposed to the institution,
as countcnpncmg an inequality of principles, con-
trary to the principles of free government, and he
moved to strike out the enacting clause of the
bill
Mr WARD, of New York, spoke about one
hour in support of the bill, and in favor of the
continuance of the institution
Mr fe\lilH, of Maine, expressed a wish to
bung the institution back to its original object,
which was meiely to educate engineers This bill
piovided for expenses incurred during the last six
months, and it was necessaiy that the appropna
tion should be made If the gentleman from Tei-
nessee would witl draw his amendment, he would
piopose one, which he thought would better meet
the feeling of those who are opposed to the msti
tution H"> would move an amendment, repealing
the second section of the act of 1803, fixing the
military peaoe establishment, and the second, third,
and fouith sections of the act of 1812, increasing
the number of cadets and instructois Also, an
amendn^nt sti king out the appiopiiations for
additional buildings
Mr DICKINSON said his proposition was in-
tended to test the sense of the House on the sub
ject, and he wished to have a vote taken on it
Mr EROWNsa d, the motion of the honorable
gentle nan frcm Tennessee [Mr Diciuntson] to
stnke out the enacting clause of the bill, and the
amendment which the honorable member from
Maine [Mr Smith] declared he would hereafter
submit, involves not only the fate of the bill under
conside ation, but the existence of the Military
Acaaerrv itself fie rose to express his regret
that this important question should be discussed
at this time, and he would ask his honoiable friends
to pause before they pioceed further The Milita
ry Academy has been established more than thirty
years Its establishment had been iepeatedly
and earnestly lecommended to Congress by Gen-
eral Washington, while President of the United
States It has been sanctioned and sustained by
every Administration (commencing with that of
Mr Jefferson) down to the present time and he
ventured to say, it had at all times enjoyed the
confidence and aporobation of a large majority of
the American people He would remind honora-
ble gentlemen that the faith of the nation was con-
cerned in the duration of the institution for some
time yet to come Did they mean to deprive its
professors and teachers of the places to which the
Government had invited them, and for which their
learning and attainments so eminently qualified
them, without a moment's notice, or 'he blightest
opportunity for preparation ' Did they roein to
cast loo&e upon the world two hundred and fifty
young men, selected fiom every partof the Union,
whose education and hopes of futuie usefulness
had been committed to the care and guardianship
of the nauon ? He trusted he knew too well the
high motives and genetous impulses which guided
the action of honorable gentlemen upon this floor,
to believe for a moment they could be accessory to
such a gross and flagrant violation of the public
faith, as these propositions (if adopted) would
mo&t suiely accomplish
He begged it might not be forgotten that the bill
under consideiation, was one of the usual annual
app-opuation bills And had not the Houseoter
and over again, in the course of the session, lep
lobated the practice of cieatirg or destroying
offices by means of bills of this character' And
if the practice was pernicious «hen applied to
offit es alone, he begged to know if it would not
be dangerous aid piegnant with mischief, when
applied to the long se'tled and peimanent mstitu
tions of the country J It had been his fortune to
reside in the immediate vicinity of West Po nt
during the greater part of his life It was within
sight of his home, and foimed a part of the dis-
trict whicn he had the honor to represent And
he hoped he woulJ be pardoned when he declared
he felt an unfeigned and anxious sohcitude for the
preservation of an institution which he regarded
as a necessary end essential part of our system
of public defence and an honor and an ornament
to the nation ff the question must now undergo
discussion, whether a m litary school for the in-
struction of our officers m the elementary pnnci
pies of military science should exist hereafter, he
must insist upon his right to be heard, reluctant
as he was to examine so grave a question withm
the last fourteen days of the session He wanted
the subject examined (as it should be) upon a bill
or resolution introduced expressly for the purpose
And he would respectfully assure honorable gen-
tlemen that the friends of the academy would not
shrink from or shun the inquiry He would for-
bear to say more at present, until he saw whether
the honorable gentleman from Tennessee would
not withdraw his motion to strikeout, and suffer
tne bill to pass through the committee And
should the discussion be renewed hereafter, he
ti usted the House would afford him an opportu-
rity to be heard
Aftera few words from Messrs DICKINSON,
JOHNSON of Kentucky, and McKAY, the ques-
tion was taken, and the amendment rejected
Mr HAWES renewed his motion-m amodified
form
Mr SMITH moved to amend it by substituting
for it the provisions suggested by him, as above-
mentioned
Mr  EWING opposed the amendment
After a few words from Messrs McKAY and
SMITH, the question was taken on the amend-
ment to the ampndr-ent, and decided in the nega-
tive, without a division
The amendmer' offered by Mr Hawes was also
rejected
Mr HAWES then moved iO amend the bill by
providing that each cadet should, upon his ap-
pointment, give bond, with security, to refund to
the United bcates the expense of his education in
case he should not remain in the service, which
motion was rejected
Mr BURD moved an amendment,providingthat
each cadet shall give bond to refund the expense
of his education to the Government, m case he
shall not serve in the army five years, if required,
which motion was rejected
Mr DUNCAN moved to amend the bill, by
providing that no one should be appointed until
the number of cadets be reduced to fifty, which
was rejected
Mr. PINCKNEY moved to amend, by pro-
viding that after the 1st of January next the Mill
tary Academy shall be abolished, which was re-
jected
The bill was then laid aside to be reported.
Mr ASHLEY moved to take up the bill for the
continuation of the Cumberland road, which was
negatived—63 to 65.
