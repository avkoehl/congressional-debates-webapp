the 22nd advanced half a mile, with skirmishers actively engaged. Returned to former position. Late in the afternoon advanced again, One hundred and twenty-second in second line, and charged the enemy, who fled with but little resistance; continued to advance in line until after dark; having advanced two miles, bivouacked. On the 23rd intrenched; heavy skirmishing, but regiment not engaged. In the evening returned to the position taken on the 21st. On the evening of the 28th [29th] moved to the left and reached Reams' Station on the Weldon railroad. The One hundred and twenty-second being in the second line took no part in the construction of the defensive works at that place. Returned to the intrenchments to the left of and near our former position on the morning of the 29 of July. On the morning of the 6th of July marched to City Point and embarked for Baltimore, Md.

It is due to the officers and men of my command that I state that they did not on any occasion during that terrible campaign-terrible alike for fatigue and danger-hesitate to obey any command to move upon the enemy, nor did they on any occasion retire from the conflict or from their position unless ordered to do so. It is also worthy of notice that at no time during the campaign could the regiment rely upon having an hour's rest.

I append a tabular statement of the losses during the campaign:
