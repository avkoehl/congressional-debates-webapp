Brigadier-General GRIFFIN:

GENERAL: General Sykes is camped near Wallis' house, about three miles from your camp, at Hartwood. He will move at 7.30 a. m . sharp, he writes. Have directed him to move at 7 if possible-that is, if Whipple is out of his way. Captain Tucker reports that you would move at daybreak. I fear you will be delayed by the occupation of the road in advance of you, starting at so early an hour. There is no haste necessary in your getting here other than that involved in the supply question, and you are supplied to the 26th. Take it comofrtably and make your camp here in fair time, which you will be able to do starting at same time with Sykes. Longstreet is sasid to be at Fredericskburg with guns in position. Our pontoon train at Dumfries coming by land. Roads bad to Belle Plain. The supply question most difficult one put at present. Graze your animals all you can and keep a sharp lookout for forage.

Yours,

BUTTERFIELD.

Commanding Third Division:

GENERAL: The order for the march of the corps has been countermanded. Your division, being under way, will proceed to the vicinity of Henry's house and camp, keeping well toward Potomac Creek and the railroad, so as to leave for the other two divisions, which will probably move to-morrow.
