CITY POINT, VA., January 24, 1865.

COMMANDING OFFICER GUN-BOAT ATLANTA:

If it is possible for you to get over the bar at Harrison's Landing please run up the river to the extreme point now occupied by our gun-boats. I inclose you copy of a dispatch * from the honorable Secretary of the Navy. The importance of having your vessel above is so great that I request you will make the effort to cross the bar at the expense of grounding your vessel. Lest you may not have a good pilot for the upper river I send one with the steamer carrying this.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

FORT MONROE, VA., January 24, 1865-3 p. m.

Honorable GIDEON WELLES,

Secretary of the Navy:

Commander Parker has this moment reported that the rebel rams have passed the obstructions in James River. I have sent the officer to report to Commodore Radford, at Norfolk, requesting that the Ironside may be sent immediately to Newport News, and have ordered the Atlanta to the same place.

JOSEPH LANMAN,

Commodore, Ship Minnesota.
