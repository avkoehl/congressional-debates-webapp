I directed General Torbert to advance with his division and General Davies' brigade, of General Gregg's division, in the direction of Gordonsville, and attack the enemy, who had concentrated and been re-enforced by infantry during the night, and had also constructed rifle-pits at a point about 5 miles from Gordonsville. The advance was made, but as the enemy's position was found too strong to assault, no general attack was made. On the extreme right of our lines a portion of the Reserve Brigade carried the enemy's works twice, and was twice driven therefrom by infantry. Night closed the contest. I found on examination of the command that there was not a sufficiency of ammunition left to continue the engagement. The next day trains of cars also came down to where we were engaged with the enemy. The reports of prisoners and citizens were that Pickett's old division, or a portion of it, was coming to prevent the taking of Gordonsville. I, therefore, during the night and next morning, withdrew my command over the North Anna, via Carpenters' Ford, near Minor's Bridge. In addition, the animals were, for the two entire days in which we were engaged, without forage, the surrounding country affording nothing but grazing of a very inferior quality, and generally at such points as were inaccessible to us. Up to this time I could get no definite in a formation as to the position of General Hunter. Report placed him and his command at Staunton, destroying the railroad. I had, therefore, the choice of attempting to join him there, via Orange Court-House and Stanardsville, or retiring, and I resolved on the latter. I had at that time only one day's rations for my men, but very little forage for my animals, and not sufficient ammunition on hand to risk a severe engagement. Living off the country was a failure; very little forage could be obtained or the animals, and to attempt under such circumstances to join General Hunter would have jeopardized my command. I regret my inability to carry out your instructions.

The cavalry engagement of the 12th was by far the most brilliant one of the present campaign. The enemy's loss was very heavy. They lost the following-named officers in killed and wounded: Colonel McAllister, commanding regiment, killed; Brigadier-General Rosser, commanding brigade, wounded; Colonel Aiken, commanding regiment, wounded; Colonel Custer [?], commanding regiment, wounded. My loss in killed and wounded will be about 575.* Of this number 490 were wounded. I brought off in my ambulances 377, all that could be transported. The remainder were (with a number of rebel wounded that fell into my hands) left behind. Surgeons and attendants were detailed and remained in charge of them. Surgeons and attendants were detailed and remained in charge of them. I captured and have now with me 370 prisoners of war, including 20 commissioned officers. My loss in captured will not exceed 160. These were principally in the Fifth Michigan Cavalry.+ This regiment gallantly charged down the Gordonsville road, capturing 1,500 horses, and about 800 men, but was finally surrounded, and had to give them up. When the enemy broke they hurried between General Custer's command and Colonel Gregg's brigade, capturing 5 caissons of Pennington's battery, 3 of which were afterward recaptured,
