GEO. W. SHELDON,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.

[Inclosure I.]

I, W. G. Campbell, Captain Fifth Regiment Alabama Cavalry, C. S. Army, do hereby make the following affidavit, to wit:

I came into Pensacola, Fla., September 8, 1863, and met Captain Wade, U. S. Navy, at the house of Mr. Morino, Spanish consul. Supposing myself to be on neutral ground, entered into conversation with said Captain Wade. While there, Captain Young, with a detachment of the Seventh Regiment Vermont Volunteers, U. S. Army, came upon my party, ordering me and my party to surrendered as prisoners of war. Captain Wade went immediately out of the house, and protested against Captain Young taking me and my party prisoners, claiming that we were on neutral ground. The said Captain Wade appeared much excited, using violent and abusive language while addressing Captain Young. And I hereby further state that I did not hear Captain Young (or any of his party) use any ungentlemanly language, or in any way conduct himself otherwise than in a manner as becomes an officer and a gentleman, while at the house of the Spanish consul aforesaid.

W. G. CAMPBELL,

Captain Fifth Alabama Cavalry, C. S. Army.

Then personally appeared the above-named W. G. Campbell, captain Fifth Regiment Alabama Cavalry, C. S. Army, and subscribed to the foregoing statement before me, at Fort Pickens, Fla., this 16th day of September, 1863.
