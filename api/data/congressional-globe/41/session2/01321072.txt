THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
February 5,
Mr. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, undoubt-
edly officers who remain in office for long
terms acquire a degree of efficiency which is
not always attainable where changes are fre-
quently made.
The people lose by making frequent changes
of members of Congress, as every one very well
understands.
But it is certainly a fact well understood all
over the country that there is at least one post-
master, if not more, in every county of the
United States, who is well qualified for the
duties of his place, and who certainly is com-
petent to perform all the duties connected with
paying pensions upon the plan I propose in
the bill I have introduced. It will also be
observed by the gentleman, who very properly
makes these inquiries, that in my bill 1 propose
that the Secretary of the Interior may select
any officer in any county and devolve on him
the duty of paying pensions. My bill does not
propose that the Secretary of the Interior shall
be limited to postmasters, but he may select
assessors or collectors of internal revenue, or
assistant assessors, or deputy collectors, or any
other officers of the General Government, or
any national bank.
Mr. BIRD. What mode doyou suggest for
the payment of these officers, whether post-
masters or otherwise?
Mr. LAWRENCE. T will state it in the
further progress of my remarks, and it is
embodied in the bill I have introduced.
I do not ask that our Post Office Department
shall undertake the vast business of the English
post office; but if England can pay $90,000,000
annually through her money-order post offices
our Government certainly, with equal capacity,
can pay out annually $30,000,000 to her pen-
sioners.
There are about two hundred and fifty col-
lectors of internal revenue and an equal num-
ber of assessors, one of each in every congres-
sional district in the United States, and one in
every Territory, besides deputies and assistants
in almost, every county. These are men of
capacity, integrity—none better in the Govern-
ment. Pensions could be paid through them,
and thus a pension officer could be brought
much nearer to all the pensioners than now.
I insist, therefore, that it is practicable to
pay pensions by some agency located in every
county of the United States where there are
pensioners. I would employ any or all of these
agencies to secure the interests of the pension-
ers and of the Government.
And now, what are the objections urged to
this ?
The Postmaster General, in a commu,nica-
t.ion to this House under date of January 11,
insists that it will not cost the Government any
less, and possibly more, by means of post office
money orders and through postmasters of the
money-order offices. I submit that experience
in England has demonstrated that the value,
economy, and efficiency of the Post Office De-
partment is underestimated by the Postmaster
General. But if in this I am mistaken, what
then?
Who has proposed to pay pensions by means
of post office money orders ? I have proposed
no such thing. I have urged that some officer
or bank should be selected, so far as neces-
sary, in every county; that the Commissioner
of Pensions should furnish to each officer or
bank a list of pensioners, with their post office
address in the county where such officer resides
or such bank is located; that the Commis-
sioner of Pensions should transmit to such
officer or bank a check on the nearest Assist-
ant Treasurer of the United States or bank
designated as a public depository, payable to
the order of each pensioner, to be delivered
when the proper voucher is executed and on
production of the pension certificate; and I pro-
pose to make it the duty of such officer to pre-
pare the vouchers and administer oaths all with-
out cost to the pensioner. (11 Stat 327; 9 Stat.
69; acts June 14,1858, and August 6, 1846.)
And I would devolve this duty on all such
officers without additional compensation. In
the United States there are seventeen hundred
and twenty-eight counties having pensioners
therein, and with an equal number of officers
! each would pay an average of only about one
i hundred and forty pensioners, and if an average
; salary of $100 should be paid annually to each
officer it would only cost the Government
$172,800, instead of $250,000 now paid to fifty
nine pension agents by the Government. Four
day's work would pay one hundred and forty
pensioners, and if they should be paid quarter
yearly $100 would be ample compensation for
i officers, especially when taken in connection
j with the emoluments for other official services.
The checks returned to the Treasury com-
pared with the pension-rolls would be the basis
for auditing and adjustiug the funds disbursed,
and by this means the expenses of auditing and
settling accounts now incurred might be dimin-
ished. But if the vouchers should be reexam-
ined at Washington it would only require the
duty now being performed; and if the number
should be increased by quarterly payments itis
a duty we owe to the pensioners.
And, now, what objection can be urged
to it? It is said that "in disbursing public
funds the fewer the men who have to handle
the money the better." In reply to this it is
sufficient to say the public funds would not be
handled under this system by as many men as
under the present plan. Pensions will be paid
by checks,not by creating new and individual
officers as disbursing agents.
To illustrate the working of the system I
present a statement giving certain statistics
from the Pension Office, as follows :

Very respectfully,
Hon. William Lawbencb, House of Repreaentativer.
H. VAN AERNAM.
Some of the advantages of the plan will be:
1. That it will cost the Government less than
that now in operation and less than that of the
Committee on Pensions.
2. It will save the pensioners annually
$1,400,000 now paid to claim agents, and save
them $364,500 now paid for fees of pension
agents, notaries, and postage.
3. It will save the pensioners the delay,
trouble, and inconveniences of the present
system.
4. It will secure quarterly payments to pen-
sioners, and thereby save them a vast amount
now paid for interest on money borrowed or by j
discount on pensions. !
5. It will furnish a means of detecting frauds !
on the pension laws, which will dispense with j
the heavy annual appropriations for that pur- j
pose, ana will save more than the cost of the j
whole system by detecting frauds on the pension j
laws. |
In accordance with these views I introduced a ;
bill (H.R.No.1098) on the 4th day of February I
to provide a mode of paying pensions. I ask :
for it the considerate judgment of the House, j
I speak in behalf of the soldiers of the Republic, .
theirwidows, orphans, and dependent relatives.
I have endeavored to do my duty, and if the
reform I have endeavored to inaugurate shall
be doomed to defeat it shall be no fault of
mine. If it shall succeed it will gladden the
hearts of those to whom we owe more than a
debt of gratitude, and all thepeople, as I fondly
hope and believe, will say," Well done, good
and faithful servants."
And then, on motion of Mr. HOLM AN, the
House (at ten minutes past four o'clock p. m.)
adjourned.
PETITIONS, ETC.
The following petitions, Ac., were presented
under the rule, and referred to the appropriate
committees:
By Mr. ASPER: The petition of John J.
Broadbeck and 47 others, citizens of Blue
Ridge, Harrison county, Missouri, praying for
the abolition of the franking privilege.
Also, the petition of Joseph Clutter, post-
master, and 43 others, citizens of Sweet Home,
Nodaway county, Missouri, for the same pur-
pose.
Also, the petition of C. C. Gelleland, post-
master, and 145 others, citizens of Gallatin,
Daviess county, Missouri, for the same purpose.
Also, the petition of William Pitman and 18
others, citizens of Fairport, De Kalb county,
Missouri, for the same pprpose.
