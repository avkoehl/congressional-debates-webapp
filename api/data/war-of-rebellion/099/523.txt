at the same time. About 7 o'clock I sent another to you directing you to come back. I hope this will reach you in time to take its place. My orders were based upon General Terry's report of an increase of the force in front, and that of prisoners that Hardee's forces had arrived from Charleston. I think you would certainly have learned it if the latter were true. That you have sent one brigade back is well. You may send another as soon as you get this dispatch. Keep the other two where you are until daylight in the morning. Then if the rebels have gone you can enter the town, taking care to hold the river crossings. If the enemy has not gone, or you are not positive that he is going, them move back and cross the river as before directed.

Very respectfully,

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.
