noneers had to fight pistol and sword in hand in its defense. The accompanying report of Major Beckham shows one instance particularly deserving special mention: Lieutenants [C. E.] Ford and [William] Hoxton, of the Stuart Horse Artillery, charged the enemy with their detachments, and Private Sudley, of the same battery, knocked one of the enemy off his horse with the sponge-staff. The officers and men behaved with the greatest gallantry, and the mangled bodies of the enemy show the effectiveness of their fire. Two of the enemy's guns were turned upon him with decided effect; the other was disabled. The enemy's loss is not known, and will, as far as possible, be carefully concealed by him. His dead on the field, together with the wounded and prisoners taken, exceed our entire loss, while he claims of have carried off his dead officers and all his wounded. A list of 192 of his wounded who reached one hospital in Alexandria, among whom were infantry as well as cavalry, is published in his papers, and in that list thirty-six regiments are represented, and it is not claimed that this hospital received all. Their dead, among whom were several field officers, were buried on different parts of the field before an opportunity was afforded to count them. A large number of arms. Equipments, horses, 6 flags, and 3 pieces of his best ordnance (2of which are serviceable) were captured. A list of captures is appended, as well as a statement of our killed, wounded, and missing, amounting to about 480 total. * Among our gallant dead, the memory of whose deeds of heroism on the battle-field will be an heir-loom to posterity, I am grieved to record Colonel Solomon Williams, Second North Carolina Cavalry-as fearless as he was efficient; the brave and chivalrous Lieutenant Colonel Frank Hampton, Second South Carolina, mortally wounded. The names of the other officers killed will be found appended. The limits of this report will not admit of the names of those brave spirits who have fallen in the ranks, but their names are recorded on the muster-rolls of fame, and will live in the lasting remembrance of a grateful people. Lieutenant-Colonel [J. C.] Phillips, Thirteenth Virginia Cavalry (a gallant officer), and

Major M D. Ball, Eleventh Virginia Cavalry, are among the wounded. Captain Benjamin S. White, of the regular army, serving on my staff, behaved with the most distinguished gallantry, and was wounded painfully in the neck. Colonel Lomax, Eleventh Virginia Cavalry, Colonel Young, Georgia Legion, and Lieutenant-Colonel White, Thirty-fifth Virginia Battalion, as coming under my own eye, handled their regiments admirably, and behaved with conspicuous daring; the last-mentioned, though painfully wounded, is still in command of his regiment, on active and important duty. Colonel A. W. Harman, Twelfth Virginia Cavalry, while bravely leading his regiment, was wounded in the neck, but retained command till night. Colonel M. C. Butler, Second South Carolina Cavalry, received a severe wound, causing the loss of his foot, which deprived his regiment and the country of his gallant and valuable services for a time. Captain W. D. Farley, of South Carolina, a volunteer aide on my staff,
