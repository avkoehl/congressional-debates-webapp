amounting to the enoimoussum or $140,000,000,
did not equal the one-third of the bank loans and
discounts
Never, tnen, was there a more fallacious idea
than this, that because the amount of bank
notes circulating in England had not greatly in-
creased, that therefore extravagant credits and
extravagant speculation did not exist We may
form somi* idea of the enormous expansion of
bank credits in that country, fiom a passage m
the Review to which I ha\e already referred
■* Mr B here read the following extract
"This rap d increase m the number and in the
issue of joint stock banks, has been in part a con-
sequence, but in a much greater degree a cause of
the late rise of prices, and of the existing excite-
ments
"But we should fall into the greatest possible er
ror if we supposed that the influence ot the banks
in question was to be measuied by the amount of
their notes m circulation payable on demand
These, in fact, convtitute but a comparati ely small
portion of then obligations Most of them have
been in the habit of trading, not on their own capi-
tal, or on the deposites made with them, but on cre-
dit obtained in the metropolis and elsewhere In-
stead of retaining ihe bills and other securities they
have discounted in then coffers till they are paid,
many oí the banks haw been m the habit of imme-
diately forwarding them to London to be ledis-
counted To such an extent has this system hurt, car-
ried, that we are well assured that certain banks, with
¡ess than ¿£500 000 of paid up capital, have discounted
bilk and made advances to tlie extent offtom uve to
six mil1 ions, and the engagements of others have been
even more mcommensui ate with then capital'"
Comment is unnecessaiy The i ipid mciease
m the number of banks andm the amount of bank
credits, has produced the same effects m England
that they ha\e done m the United States 1 will
venture to say that no portion of the history of that
countiy presents a parallel to then late extravagant
speculations of e\ery description The epidemic
seems to have spent its force chief!) m the creation
of joint stock companies, for almost every purpose
under the sun There are companies tor the con-
struc'ion of railroads, for the manufacture of cot-
tons, foi tanning, for the manufacture of glass,
pins, needles, soap, turpentine, etc , foi dealing in
coals, for racing sugar fr >m the beet root, for
making lailways in Hindostán, tor the prosecution
of the whale f sherj, lor had ng and lound ng set-
tlements on the southeast coast ot Afr ca, and
finally, for burying the dead
During the first three months of the last year, one
hundred and four joint stock companies were form-
ed in Manchester and Liverpool alone, with an
aggregate capital of ¿SXl 987 500 sterling' To
complete this pictuie of follv and extravagance, Mr
Poulett Thompson stated, in his speech in the
House of Commons, in the d scission lelitnc io
the budget, "thai he had made a*regi"-ter be kept c f
the various joint stock companies then on the tapit>
in different parts of the kingdom, and he found
their numbeis amounted to between three and foui
hundred, and tnat a capital of nearly two hundred
millions stealing or about twenty urnes the capital
of the bank of England, would be required accord-
ing to the statements of the paities, to carry them
into effect'"
The proposed capital of these companies formed
in a few months, amoun s to the enoi mous sum of
one thousand millions of aollars, or to neaily four
times the whole banking capital of the United
States on the first of January, 1836' 4.nd vet, •
when it becomes ne-essiry to convict the President
of ignoiance and mistake, w e are told, that there
has been no over-trading, no tvessive specula-
tions, no extravagant bank credits in England, anl
that too, simply because tne amount oí bank notes
in circulation has not greatlv increased Most
astonishing efirt' The statement contained m
the Message is tni", both m letter and in spir t
If I were to contend, which I do n(t, fhn all om
calamities in tnis countu have pioceeded iiom the
extravagant expansion of the paper cred ts o Lng-
land, succeeded by a sudden contraction, it wou d
be mucn more plausible than the argument of gen-
tlemen     What but this bloated credit tempted our
merchants to inúndale the conn íy -with foreign
goods'! The ancient customs of trade were aban-
doned, and they were urged in every mannei to
accept credits, and to draw bills of exchange, not
founded upon any aciual expoits, but on the hope
that exports might be made at some future and in-
definite penod
The two countries have proceeded together with
equal strides on ihe road to ruin, stimulating each
other in their dow nward career, and they have both
suffered the same penalties, and endured the same
misfortunes As th* Prpsiden* states, tne chief dif-
ference in their condition is, that our banks have
suspended specie payments, whilst those of England
have been able to w eather the storm
But gentlemen allege that the President Ins com-
mitted anothei g^ e error, m staung Jiat the fo-
reign debt contracted by ourcitizens was estimated,
in March last, at more than tl irty millions of dol-
lars This estimate, the" say is uelow the ttuth
some eighty or ninety millions ll it were, this
would only be, as m the case of the othei alleged
mistake, so much in favsr of tne President's aigu-
ment—not against it But how do they prove this
mistake? B; adding to our actual foreign debt,
now due and paj able by the merchants, all foreign
investments in our stocks, and all the peimanent
loans which have been made m England to the
sevi ral Slates and to corpora'ions The bare state-
ment of this fact is sufficient It is evident the
Pres dent was not estimating the amount of perma-
nent investments made by foreigners in this coun-
try, but ihe actual amount of our commercial debt,
due in March List, which it was necessary to extin-
guish before our trade could revive Tnis d"bt
may have been thirty five or foity millions of dol-
lar* bat, froir the information communicated by
the Senator hom New York (Mr Tallmadge) a
few dus ago,th it, m Ihe opinion i f the merchants
of New York, it was i ow reo jced to twelve mil-
lions of dollars, I should very much doubt whether
it at all exceeded thirty millions m Maich last.
How cheering the intelligence that our foreign
debt has been reduced to $12,000,000' The re-
sources of our country are «o abundant, that this
debt must v ry soon be extinguished Our next
cotton crop will create a large balance m our
favor The foieign exchanges will soon no longei
be against us, and then the foreign demand for
specie will cease All sound banks may then with
safety resume specie payments They will have no-
thing to dread, except the want of confii'ence at
home This I fear has been greatly increased at
least throughout the interior of Pennsylvania, by
the refusal of the banks m Philadelphia to meet
those of New York, even for the puipose of con-
sulting at what time it was pribable specie pay-
ments might with safely be resumed I have re
ceived numerous letters on th * s ib ect, wh ch Ul
speak the same language This ri.fi sal I ieel
confident, did not arise from an^ apprehension,
that these banks were less able to resume specie
pa\ ments than thos  of their sister cuy
Mr Van Burei is not on'\ correct in his state-
ments of fact, but, by his Me sam, ne 1 is for ever
put to fight the charge of non-ommillahsn—of
want of decision and ere-gj He has assumed an
altitude of moral giandenr before the Amencin
people, and has shown himself worthy to succeed
Genpral Jacl-sora He has elevatel himself much
in my ow n esteem He has proved equal to tne
tiymg occasion Even his political enemies tvho
can not apprine the doctrines of the Messag ,
admire its decided tone, and the ability with which
it sustains what has been callad the new expen-
ment AM why «hould the sound of n«w experi-
ments in Government grate so barshl, upon the
ears of the Sen itor Horn Massachuset s? Was not
our Government itseif, at its origin, a new
and glorious expenmeni? Is it not now u on
its trpl' If it sho lid continue to work as it
has heretofore done it will at last s«cme liber y
to the human race, and rescue the n hts of man,
m every clime, from the giasp of tyrants "till it
is, as yet, but an experiment Foi its i ature suc-
cess, it must dep n 1 upon the patriotism and the
wisdom ol the American people, and the Govern-
ment of their uioice I sincerely believe that the
establishment of the agencies which the bill pio
poses will exert a most happy influence upon tie
success of our grand experiment, and that it wiji
contribute, in no small jdegiee, to the prosperous
working ot our institutions generally. The Mes-
sage will ccustitut  the touchstone of political par-
ties in th r country for jear« to come, and I shall
always be found ready to do battle m support of its
doctrines, because their direct tendency is to keep
the Federal Government within its proper lim'ls,
and lo maintain the reserved rights of the Slates.
To lakecaiecf oui own money, through the agency
of oit own officers, w uhoú the employment of any
banks, whether State or national, will, m my opin-
ion, gieatly contribute to tnese happy lesults, and
in sustaining this policj, I feel confident I am ad-
vocating the aue interest and the ttearest rights of
the people
SPEECH OF MR BROWN,
Of North Cakoiina,
In Senate, Seplembei 30, 1837—The bill imposing
additional du íes, as depositories in certain cases,
on public officers, b"ing under co sideration—
Mr BROWN said, in rising t > aeldress the Se-
nate, after the verv able and luminous mvestigat on
w hich the subject then before them had undergone,
he did so from no vain expectation that he should be
able, by any thing he might say, to ímpai t any new
interest to the debate, which had been listened to
so attentn el>, or to add an} thing of force to the
argument by which it had been sustained The
acknowledged importance of the question they
were called on to decide, the powerful influence
which it would exert on the future destinies of th 
counti \, either foi good or evil, and the deep inte-
rest felt in relation to it b> the citizens of the State
w n ch he m par", repiesent d, wo II he trusted,
excuse him foi presenting some of the leading cor-
sid «rations which would govern his course on that
occasion
Before, however, he entered into an examination
of the merits of the pioposed measure, he \v >uld
notice very bnefiv some observations that had
fallen from several Senators who had preceded
him in the debate The houoiable gentleman
from South Carolina, (Mr Preston,) who has
Jnsf taken his seat, in the commencement of his
remarks, had alleged that the late Bank of the
United States, had been constantly the subject
of reference, o\ those who had spoken m ihis body
in defence of the measures of the admunsti Uion,
and had deprecated its intioduction into this deba.e,
as tending to make up an erroneous issue before
the country. It surely could not have escaped the
observation of that gentleman, that the course of
the late admimstiation, in relation to that institu-
tion had been severely arraigned by many of those
wh) were politically as ocíate I with him in the
p cress of the present discussion Thus invited
b) the política friends of that gentleman in «ome
mea uie to bring into review the character and con-
d ict of that institution it could not justly be com-
plained oe, either bv them or himself, that the invi-
tation h d Von accepted, and that somj reminis-
cences ha 1 been called up not, perhaps, the most
grat tvin m is friends, and but little calculated to
reenmnend it to the public favor
While, s.id Mi B the gentleman evinces so
muchanvetv that we should a\oil maKing iaise
issues befoie the country, is he quite certa *> thai
he is no* h'mself obnoxious to the same c rge'
When he impu es to the administration an 1 its
suppliers, the des gn ol attempting to establish
an exclude n italic currency throughout the
county, is he en din mat he ousents the question
fanH' Ooes he w h«n he represents tl em as c -
teuu.,0 1 a cri a'e to annihilate the Stele b ml ,
andcWrcj th" paper system, makeup an uipar
tial issue' Heuas wfcllawa.e, tint man\ .the
opponents of the administration had u=ed no o di-
na!, índnstrv, f'r some time past to produce the
impression on the public mind, ih it tuns a part
oi its system of policy to attempt the iniroduet on
of an excub-n e metallic cuirencv The friends of
a national bank, had leen especially distinguished

this  impression, no  doubt hop ng to profit by the
