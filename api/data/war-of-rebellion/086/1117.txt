Brigadier General W. R. BOGGS,

Chief of Staff, &amp;c.:

GENERAL: Herewith I send a plan of reorganization in accordance with my views, and several alternate plans. It will be perceived that I greatly reduce the cavalry by plan Numbers 1 without varying materially from General Smith's views. Besides, this plan will suit far better the geographical features of the country, with the defense of which I am intrusted. If I take action independently of General Smith's previous approval, and he directs changes after the reorganization is effected, either in part or altogether, the confusion which would result would be very disastrous to the public service. The whole country is flooded; creeks and rivers everywhere being almost impassable, some delay may take place on this account. I have been unable, notwithstanding every exertion on my part, to procure returns. I sent for them when General Price was at Perryville, and forwarded blanks when he was at Clarksville.

I beg that the answer of the general commanding may be addressed to me at Lewisville and respectfully urge that this subject may be brought to his earliest attention. Tyler's brigade has been organized partly in Missouri and partly in texas since its return. Is its organization legal? Whether so or not I recommend that it be preserved until it can be ascertained if there will be a sufficient number of men to fill up the old infantry organizations without it. If this should prove to be the case it is desirable it should be retained, as it is formed of a good class of men, and mostly neighbors, having been recruited from well-to-do farmers in Missouri, and that it should be attached, dismounted to Price's division of infantry. If not so disposed of, I recommend that the men should be transferred to Price's infantry as re-
