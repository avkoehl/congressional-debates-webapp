sterling, and an annual tax of fifty millions ster-
ling upon the people, was prosperous and unem-
barrassed, and its industry and trade not materi-
ally affected, Whilst, on the contrary, the Govern-
ment of the United States, with a surplus of forty
millions of dollars, and the people comparatively
no taxes to pay, yet the Government and the peo-
ple were alike bankrupt Without literally adop-
ting these positions, they nevertheless went clearly
to elucidate to his mind the effect, of th« commer-
cial action of the two countries. England has no
balances against her, and, hence, the comparatively
partial evil she experiences, whilst the balance
against us required, in its liquidation, the com of
the country—the basis of our paper currency
The Step taken was inevitable. The basis of our
currency would have been swept from the country
but for rhe proper and justifiable course of those
who held it m possession Had England received
hei dues, she would, of course, not have felt the
Wow, but had we promptly paid our dtbts we
should have been ruined
In establishing the position that the present state
of thing  has been product d principally by over-
trading:, theeondu.1011 of Fngland has been assimi-
lated to ours, and her embanassments ascribed to
the same causes In his judgment, however, there
was a material, a radical difference—our over trad-
ing consisted in buying too much, in buying moie
than we can pay for, of foreign countries The
ovei-trading of England, on the contrary, consists
in selling more than she can obtain pay for, and
the losers only feel the effect, without its pervading
all branches of business Our over-tradmg abroad,
as before remarked, in creating balances against us,
affects m a greater or less degree all classes,
of community by its operation on the currency He
ha7aid(d In t 'e in saying that excessive importations
had been the forerunner of all the severe ¡evulsions
we had felt for ihe last twenty years That of
1819 must be familiar to most of the membeis of
this House, and he thought no Individual could
doubt its cause It operated with extreme seve-
rity, and however gicat may be the embarrassment
and suffering of the commercial interest at thepresent
ume,the general distress at thatpenod was incompa-
rably greater than u now is Ournumeiousmanufae-
turmg establishment , with scarcely a single excep-
tion, were overwhelmed in irretrievable ruin Thou-
sands ot iaimeis canged proprietors, and those
w ho but yislerday thought themselves secure m a
cei tain, though, perhips, humble independence,
wcio on ih< monow the tenants of their former
freeholds And it may not unwoithy of lumilc
that thev isked not, received not, any oí the boun
tits of Govert ment
He had no doubt of the existence of the diffi-
cuHies complained ot bv the commercial interest
Public fame, as well as the documents before us
on that subject, estiblish that iact, and he should
hope in Ihe honor of huminity that that distress
must he deep indeed, that could bring be/ore us,
b-ggmg alms, that class ol oui citizens, who, m
then own estimation, and as it would appear m
the estimation of this House, weie hrtt m impor-
tance as they were m wealth
He ttusled the provisions of the first section of
this bill would afford them great lelief, at all
events it was their proportion of the bounties of
Government He considered ihe second section,
as well as the amendment offered, went to mciease
by the ai 1 of the Government, an evil which had,
to <i great extent, been checked by its own excesses
Import itions, unbraced in ihe amendment, being
principally ftom the west of Europe, had in gene-
rübeen ordered since the commencement ot the
pie ent embanassments The impoiters were
consequently aware of their inability, if that ina-
bility exists, to comply with the requirements of
the revenue laws. If then they have knowingly
and purposely plunged in beyond their depth, they
snould be left, as the great maw. oí their fellow citi-
zens are, to get out of their difficulties, without the
spec al bounties of the Government He would
say no more, except to etpres, the hope, though
apparently a vain one, that those «ho had comn-
buted to the establishment of the present revenue
laws, would feel and see the propriety of rendering
them permanent.
Hub-Treasury—Mr. Rives.
SPEECH OF MR. RIVES,
Of Virginia,
In Senate, September 19,1837—In support of the
bill introduced by him designating the funds re-
ceivable m payment of the pablic revenue, and
in opposition to the Sub-Treasury scheme.
Mr Pkesid*nt I rise, in pursuance of the no-
tice I gave yesterday, to ask leave to bring in a
" bill to designate the funds receivable m payment
of the revenue of the United States " It will be
borne in mind, by the Senate, that among the most
piormnent, and certainly not the least important
objects presented, both by the President's message
and the report of the Secretary of the Treasury,
for the " immediate attention" of Congress at their
present session, is the expediency of some legisla-
tive provision defining the character of the funds
to be received m futuro, m discharge of the public
dues From the intimate connection between the
collection of the public revenue and the general
currency of Ihe country, this question has, in my
estimation, far more essential bearings on the great
interests of the community than any which the
President has submitted for our deliberations The
Committee on Finance, however, to whom the
Message was referred, have not thought it proper
to make any report on that portion of it, and we
have been informed by the honorable chairman
(hat it is not iheir intention to make any report
upon it at the present session It is this omission,
on thf part of the committee, that it is the object of
my motion now to supply
The President recommends that henceforward
the whole revenues of the United States shall be
collected exclusively in gold and silver A propo-
sition of so marked a chaiacter, emanating from a
source of such high authority, could not jail to ex-
cite deep anxiety m the public mind, and it seemed
to me that all uncertainty, in regaid to the policy of
the Government on so vital a subject, should be
promptly settled one way or the other by the action
of the legishtivcdepai talent It is my misfortune
to differ -Kith the President m his views of the ex-
pediency of this proposition I am fully convin-
ced that, m the actual condition of our circulating
medium, and m what is likely, foi j ears to come,
to be its condition, the operation of such a measure
would be distressing to the community, injurious to
every branch of industry and enterprise, and, above
all, would postpone indefinitely that return to spe
cie payments by the banks, which is the great ob-
ject of the public solicitude, and ou M to be the
end and aim if oui deliberations here Viewing
the que tion in this light, I desued it should be met
«idi promptitude, considered with candor, and de-
cmel with «islorn
Since I , tve notice yesterday of mv motion, two
gentlemen, the Senator from South Carolina, (Mi
Calhoun,land tho Senator from Missouri, (Mr
Benton,) have submitted propositions intended to
carrj out the President's recommendation, differing
somen hat m detail, but both founded on the prin-
ciple of rejecting bank papei altogethei in the ope-
li'ionsof the Government, even though ímme-
chitely convertible into specie, and issued by banks
of unquestionable solidity Both contemplate, as
dees the íccommendation of the President, a tho-
íoogh revolution m the policy and practice of the
Government Prom the origin of the Government
it has been the practice ot the Tieasury Depatt-
ment to Ireat the notes of specie paying banks as
equivalent lo specie, and the joint resolution of
1810 oxpiessly placed bank notes, comeit ble m o
specie, on the same fo( ting with specie in the fiscal
transactions of the Government It is true that,
under the construction given to that act by the Ian
officei of the Government, Ihe late President of the
United States caused an ordei to be issued, requir-
ing payments for public lands to be made m gold
and silver alone, still leaving the other branch of
the revenue (ihe customs) to be collected as hereto-
fore, in the notes of, or checks on, speeie-pajmg
bank= That older was undeisiood at the time to
be issued for objects pui*>ly of a temporary nature ,
and ns such it mav hive been a salutary measure
But its continuance as a patt of the permanent po-
licy of the Government was almost unanimously
repudiated by the voice of the representatives of
the people and of the States
Senate.
*____
You well remember, Mr President, that the dis-
cussions 'o which this subject gave rise, during the
last session of Congress, terminated m the passage
of a bill, by overwhelming majorities of both
Houses, distinctly re-affirming the principle of the
joint resolution of 1816, in relation to the receivs-
bihty of the notes of specie-paying banks, and con-
taining also the significant provision, that in future
no discrimination should be made between the dif-
ferent branches of the revenue, as to the medium
in which they v ere to be paid The bill received
the votes of nine-tenths of the members of this
house, and near three fourths of the other Still
it did not become a law The circumstances under
which it was a'rested in the ordinary and regular
course, and which alone prevented it from being
now the law of the land, are fresh in the recollec-
tion of the eonniry I will not speak of them, for
it is my sincere wish to keep out of the present dis-
cussion every thing which may awaken unpleasant
feelings. But this I will say, that no act of legisla-
tion was ever the subject of a more watchful scru-
tiny, in the various stages of its progress, few, if
any, have ever met a fuller discussion, or a more
deliberate consideration, none, within my expe-
rience, has ever received a more unammoas and
emphatic assent of the bodies by which it was
passed The country, too, so far as I have been
able to learn—and I have not been an inattentive
observer of the evidences of public sentiment on
the subject—has responded, with a general voice
of approbation, to the decision of Congress, and
warmly and cordially sustained it. It is that mea-
sure, thus doubly sanctioned, with some modifica-
tions suned to ihe change of circumstances, that I
beg leave to re-present as a compliance with the
call of the President em Congress for further legisla-
tion, believing it to be adapted to the exigencies of
the occasion, as well as useful and salutary in its
geneial operation on the currency.
The principles of that bill were thesp. It de-
clared that the public dues should be collected in
specie, or in the notes of specie-paying banks, un-
der certain restrictions m regard to small notes,
which were intended to operate the suppression
(ultimately, but gridually) of all notes under
twenty dollars, and it further provided, as I have
already stated, that, in future, no discrimination
should be maáe between the different branches of
the revenue, as to the funds m which they were
receivable. These pnncip'es are incorporated in
the bill I now ask leave to present, and in the very
language in which they stood in the bill of last
session The modifications of that bill, which I
have made vuthieference toexistmgcircumstances.
are these In contemplation of the contingency,
now highly probable, of an issue of Treasury notes,
I have introduced an alternative clause, declaring
that, in addition 10 specie and the notes of specie-
paying banks, the public dues may be collected
"tn alii/ other medium specially authorized by law.'"
The other modification has relation to the great
desideratum of an early resumption of specie pay-
ments by the banks , and consists m a proviso that
" he notes of no bank which now fails, or may
hereafter fail to redeem its notes m specie, shall,
at any time, be received in discharge of the public
dues, unless such bank shall, on or before a given
day, have bona fide resumed pa) ment in specie"
The object of this proviso is to designate a fixed
period for the resumption of specie payments by
the banks, «Inch may serve as a rallying point to
them all, and produce that concert and harmony
of movement without which this most desnable
end cannot be pccomplished There will be no
difficulty, I think, from the data already in our
possession, or easily attainable, m fixing that pe-
riod under tandmgly and judiciously The mere
designation of a day by Congress will, itself, be
powerfully operative in effecting the result we aim
at. You doubtless recollect, Mr President, what
was the effect produced by a similar proceeding m
1816-17 By the joint resolution of April, 1816,
the 30th February following was fixed as the day
for the resumption of «pecie payments by the
banks The banks themselves determined, m a
formal convention held for the purpose, not to re-
sume uitil the 1st of July, 1817, but the firm ad-
I herence of Congress to their original resolution,
