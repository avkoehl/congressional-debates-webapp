THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

ions, whoso sympathies, whose predilections, are
all with him.
Mr.HAMMOND. The Senator will allow me,
injustice to that gentleman, to say that, although
he arranged, he did not take the census.
Mr. HAMLIN. He did not take the census;
but the arrangement of the returns and some of
the conclusions, which are deductions based upon
judgment, were made by him. The census of the
South was taken by southern men; the census of
the North was taken by northern men; and then
the calculations which were required were made
by Mr. De Eow, a very distinguished man—a
good deal of a financier, I am willing to admit,
but with all the prejudices that would surely arise
in his own bosom in favor of the South. 1 there-
fore go to his tables for the purpose of presenting
what are the evidences of the prosperity of the
different sections. I think they afford the best
evidence that we can lay our hands upon as to the
surplus of the different parts of the country.
Mr. TOOMBS. Will the Senator allow me to
interrupt him ?
Mr. IIAMLIN. Yes, sir.
Mr. TOOMBS. It is a matter of no consequence
in reference to the argument; but I want to put a
fact right; and that may be of some consequence.
The census was compiled, and it was very well
done, indeed, by Mr. Kennedy—not by Mr. De
Bow. He came in just before the publication,
and had nothing to do with the agricultural sta-
tistics. I am not complaining of them. I think
they were very badly taken in some places. But
a vast amount of matter was collected, for which
Mr. Kennedy is entitled to ciedit, and he claims
| free States was §6,780,337; and in the slave States,
' $2,719,534. The number of libraries, other than
! private, was, in the free States, 14,91]; in the slave
, States,695. The number of volumes in those libra-
| ries in thefree States,3,888,234;in the slave States,
' 649,577. That is one evidence of the intelligence
; of a country, and the intelligence of a country is
! one index of its prosperity. It is an index of a
i surplus, because a surplus is required to support
I schools.
i Next, as to the progress of white population.
, In 1790, at the first census, there were, in the
j northern States, 1,900,970 white people; in the
! southern States, 1,271,488. In 1820 there were,
' in the northern States, 5,030,377 whites; in the
! southern States, 2,808,946. In 1850 there were, in
| the northern States, 13,238,670; in the southern
States, 6,184,477. It will be observed that in 1790
the white population of the North exceeded that
of the South about half a million; and in 1850 the
white population of the North was 13,233,670;
that of the South, 6,184,477. In 1790, at the first
census, Virginia had a population of 748,308
whites; New- York had a population of 340,120;
giving Virginia a surplus of 408,188, or a little
more than two to one in population over New
York. How was it in 1850 ? In 1850 the popu-
lation of New York was 3,097,394; that of Vir-
ginia 1,421,661, giving, in favorof New York, an
: excess of a little more than two to one, reversing
j precisely the ratio of population existing between
those two States in 1790. I afiirm that that is
another evidence of the prosperity of a country,
1 and of its actual wealth; because wealth goes
along pari passti with population, unless there is
it justly. Little or nothing of it was done by Mr. j | some particular causc to prevent it.
De Bow; for he did not come in until they were
nearly all prepared for publication.
Mr. HAMLIN. I know very well that Mr.
Kennedy was originally at the head of the bureau
of census statistics. I was brought into frequent
communication with Mr. De Bow afterhisappoint-
ment, and it is my recollection th^t the whole
matter underwent his revision. But it is not ma-
' terial; nor is it material that there may have been
some thingsomitted from the census returns. The
facts there presented, we cannot avoid, and I am
confident are correct and reliable.
Now, I put the question, whatare the best evi-
dcnces that wo can have of what is the surplus
production of a country ? Its exports may be one,
its imports may be another; but I insist that there
are still other and important evidences which go
to show what is the surplus production of a coun-
try. First, its schools; second, its progress in
population; tlurd, its agricultural productions and
its improved state of agriculture; fourth, its man-
ufactures; fifth, its ships; sixth, its railroads; and
seventh, its capacity for war. There are others—
these are the principal ones. The latter three are
those which are offered by the Senator from South
Carolina himself, as the evidence of the wealth of .
a country. I read from what that Senator said:
" You may estimate what is made throughoutthe conntiy
from these books, but it is* no matter how much is
made if it is as I consumed."
I grant that.
II If a man possess millions of dollars and consumes his
income, !•> lie tich ! [s he competent to embatk 111 any new
eutei [Hue ? Can he build ship-: 01 railroads' And could a
people m that condition build slnp.-and roads, or go to war?"
The exhibition of the wealth of a country is to
be found in those three things. I add to them
those which I have named. I propose to show
I offer next a statement showing the number of
farms and plantations, acres of improved and un-
improved land, cash value of farms, average value
per acre, and value of fatming implements and
machinery, in the free and slave States, according
to the census returns for 1350. Number of farms
and plantations—free States, S77,736; slave States,
564,503. Acres of improved land—free States,
57,688,040; slave States, 54,970,427. Acres of
unimproved land—free States, 50,394,734; slave
States, 125,731,865. Cash value of farms—free
States, $2,143,344,437; slave States, $1,117,649,-
619. Average value per acre—fi ee States, $19 83;
slave States, £6 18. Value of farming improve-
ments and machinery—free States, §85,736,658;
slave States, §65,345,625.
Thathshows conclusively that we improve our
farms, that we add the surplus of our products to j
the value of our lands. It proves conclusively J
that while we do not cultivate so large an area, it j
is in value exceeding that which is cultivated at j
the South, and it is this improved condition of j
our agriculture and this improved condition of j
our farms that shows the prosperity of our coun- i
try. I shall not stop to comment on these figures, j
Indeed, if I were to deal in figures of rhetoric, i
they could add no force to these figures of arith- i
; metic. # i
: I next, as another and one of the best evidences
: which 1 think I can present to the Senate of the
surplus product of the country, exhibit a table
. which shows the amount of live-stock and its
! value in 1850, and the value of all the agricul-
tural productions. I find that in the free States
1 the whole amount of agricultural productions and
the value of live-stock (and we know that our
I friends of the South exceed us in agriculture) is
$709,177,527, and in the slave States §,634,570,057.
I Capital—free States, §430,240,051 slave States.
' $95,029,879. Value of raw material used—fte£
1 States, $465,844,092; slave States, $8f>,i90,S39.
; Hands employed—free States, male, 57^954;
] male, 203,622; slave States, male, 140,377; female,
i: 21,360. Annual wages—free States, $195>97.6*453;
slave States, $33,257,560. Annual product—free
States, $842,586,058; slave States, $165,4X3,027.
Annual profit, according to De-Bow—free States,
I $376,741,966; slave States, $79^222,388. _ - "
j The amount of manufactured articles is tftojre
1 than $842,000,000 at the North; at tJie Soutli,
| $165,000,000; and the annual profits at the NbrCh
[ are $376,000,000; at the South, $79,000,000; leav-
| ing an excess of profits on manufactured articles
; at the North of about $300,000,000.
] For the purpose of measuring the surplus
' wealth of the respective sections, 1 come now to
test it by the rules which the Senator from South
Carolina himself has laid down. He asserts that
the surplus products of a country are to be ex-
hibited in the capacity of its people to build ships
and railroads and to go to war. These are the
indications of the prosperity and of the surplus
revenue of a country, as advanced by the Senator
himself. While I do not admit that they are the
only indications, I acknowledge that they are
great and true ones; and while I contend that
other great branches of industry to which { have
alluded are equally sure and certain indices of
the prosperity of a country, still, when I come to
the very standard that he himself has erected, I
j find a state of things which I shall now present.
I Where is the navigation of the country? Who
: has the capacity to build ships ? "That is the first
i point made by the Senator; and I answer that
• amid the cold regions of the North, where we can
; do little else, we build ships. We can come down
; with them to you, and carry your products, and
i I trust you will allow us to do so when we carry
; them as cheap as anybody else. Of the tonnage
of the United States for the yearendmg June 30,
; 1857, we have 4,102,491 tons; the South 338,352
' tons; showing in favor of the North more than
j twelve tons to one. The tonnage built at the
j North during the year ending June 30,1855—and
! I take these tables from our latest reports on c'om-
! merce and navigation—was 528,844 tons; built
| at the South, 52,959 tons; being about ten to one',
I I find, from the last reports which I can obtain,
: that in the northern States, which embrace an area,
, as we all know, of some 200,000 square miles less
than the South, we have 17,855 miles of railroad,
while at the South they have 6,559 miles, or nearly
three miles to one. 1 find that the canals in oper-
ation at the North are 3,682 miles, and at the South
1,116 miles. That is the standard by which the
Senator himself has sought to measure the sur-
plus products of the country. I think they are
very true evidences, not conclusive, not embrac-
ing all the elements, but still they are the bast of
evidence to enable us to form a correct judgment
of the surplus of any country, so far as they go.
I come next to the capacity of the country for
a state of war; and I find, from the report of the
Secretary of War, made May 10,1790, that there
were furnished, during the revolutionary war, to
the Continental line and regular militia, from the
northern States 218,544 men; from the southern
States 71,140 men. Massachusetts alone fur-
nished 83,092, being some 12,000 more than were
furnished bv the whole South-

private schools; m the slave States, 2,797. Their
teachers in the free States were 7,175; in the slave
States, 4,913. Their pupils in the free States were
154,893; in the slave States, 104,976. Their an-
nual income in the free States was $2,457,372; in
the slave States, £2,079,742. The total amount in-
vested m schools and in colleges in the free States
was $2,940,125; in the slave States, $699,079. The
number of public schools m the free States was
62,433; m the slave States, 18,509. Their teachers
in thefree States, 72,621; in the slave States,19,307.
Their pupils m the free States, 2,769,901; in the
slave States, 581,861. Their annual income in the
furnished are as I have named them. But, in ad-
. dition, there were what were called estimated or
conjectural militia returned in the report of the
Secretary of War. It was a class of militia that
' was called out for temporary purposes, and to be
used at specific points. Many of them were used
to protect the Virginia Legislature, then, I think,
But sir I come to another table, which shows j' called the House of Burgesses. Many of them
' '  * ' ' ' ' '' 5 —l! were used in South Carolina to protect her legis-
lative department when in session. That class of
conjectural militia amounted, from the northern
States, to 30,950; from the southern States, to
76,810. For the regular service, either of militia
or Continental line, I have stated the number made
by the Secretary of War to Congress in his re-
port. I refer to the report of General Knox, when
he was Secretary of War. -
