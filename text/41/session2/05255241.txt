The SPEAKER. The regular order having
been called for, the morning hour will now

mittee on the Public Lands.
JOSJS DOMINGCEZ GRANT.
Mr. JULIAN, from the Committee on the
Public Lands, reported back, with a recom-
mendation that the same do pass, a bill (H. It.
No. 2026) to repeal an act entitled "An act
to confirm the grant of certain lands to Jose
Dominguez, in California," approved June 12,
18C6.
The question was upon ordering the bill to
be engrossed and read a third time.
1 The bill, which was read, provides that the
act of Congress approved June 12, 18GG, enti-
tled "An act to confirm the grant of certain
lands to Jose Dominguez, in California," be,
and the same is thereby repealed.
Mr. JULIAN. I will briefly explain the
object and necessity of this bill. In 1SGG a
memorial was presented to Congress asking
the confirmation of the grant referred to in
this bill. It was supposed to contain an area
of three or four leagues, and a statement was
also made that it contained within it the famous
grape-vine of California, and that the grantee
had held it for a great many years, as his
father and mother had done before him.
The surveyor general undertook to have a
survey made, but found the. boundaries of the
grant so vague and indefinite that the survey
was pronounced by him to bo impracticable.
Thereupon the claimants of the grant under
Dominguez employed the surveyor general at
their own expense to make a survey according
to their own directions as to the boundaries.
The survey thusmade covered some forty-seven
leagues, or about 208,742.33 acres; thus gob-
bling up quite a large number of settlers on the
lands of the United States under the preemp-
tion laws, including the town of Santa Barbara
itself. This development was so startling to
that wh ole section of coun try that the facts were
looked into. It turned out that the memorial
asking for the confirmation of this grant was a
forgery in the beginning, and that the statement
of pretended'facts embodied in the memorial
was entirely false; that, in fact, no such grant
existed, the conditions not having been com-
plied with, and Dominguez himself deriving no
title. It further appeared that the celebrated
grape-vine spoken of was seven or eight miles
distant in another portion of the county.
The Committee on the Public Lands have
examined the whole matter, and I have myself
submitted a carefully prepared report setting
forth all the facts, with documents and other
proof of the facts and circumstances of the
case. I pronounce it the most monstrous con-
spiracy against justice and decency and the
rights of settlers on the lands of the Government
that I have ever had any knowledge of in the
whole course of my legislative experience.
These are biiefly the facts, and I believe they
are uncontroverted and incontrovertible. The
report I refer to is as follows:
The Committee on the Public Lands, to whom was
referred House bill No. 202(5, entitled "A bill to re-
peal an act to confirm the grant of certain lands to
Jose Dominguez. in California, approved June 12,
1866," have had the same under consideration, to-
gether with the memoiia.l of a largo number of citi-
sens of S.inta Barbara county, and other papers and
documents relating to this claim, and now respect-
iully submit the following report:
The act of Juno 12.1886, purports to confirm to Jo.se
Dominguez tlie title to certain lands wnieh it is
alleged were granted to hitn by the Mexican gov-
ernor, Pico, at Los Angeles, under date of Septem-
ber 24,1S>5, 'mown as ihe Los Prietos y Najalayegua,
and situate m the county of Santa Barbara. It
directs the surveyor general of California to pro-
ceed and survey said lands in accordance with the
original title papers in his offico, and provides that
when said survey shall have been approved by the
Commissioner ot the General Land Office a patent
shall i.'sue for said land to said Dominguez, or par-
ties holding under him by inheritance or otherwise.
It is farther provided that the confirmation shall
only be construed as a relinquishment on the partof"
the United Stales, and shall not affect the adverse
rights of any person whomsoever.
The action of the surveyor general of California,
under this statute, will be best explained by his own
letter to the Commissioner of the General Land Office,
under date of September IS, IS08, which is as fol-
lows :
united States Surveyor General's Offick,
Sax i'EAKCisco, California,
SejpteinberlS, 1868.
Sir: The aet of Congress approved June 12, 1866.
confirmed tho claim ot Jose Dominguez to a tract of
land named Los Prietos y Najalayegua, situate in
Santa Barbara county, and directed the surveyor
general of California to proceed and survey said
lands in accordance with the original title papers on
file in his office. In obedience thereto I issued in-
structions on tho 25th April, 1867, to George H.
Thompson, deputy surveyor, for tho survey of said
claim, furnishing him with a traced copy ot the ori-
ginal papeis on file in the Mexican archives, as his
guide in executing said survey. Deputy Thompson
reported that the calls were so uncertain and vague
that he found it difficult to make a survey.
The grantees of theclaim, through their attorney,
E. J. Pringle, esq,, then offered to provojudicial pos-
session by affidavits covering the extent of the pres-
ent survey ; but I declined to rcceive any evidence
exeepttliatmeniioncd m tho act of Congress as gov-
erning my action in the matter.
They then requested that a survey should be mado
according to their views and at their own risk. In
order to bring tho matter before this office for ex-
amination, I so instructed tho deputy. Mr. Thomp-
son returned a survey comprising an extent of 208,-
742.33 acres, as the tract claimed by the grantees of
Dominguez under said actof Congress.
The location and area of this survey did not meet
my views as to tho construction of said aet, for the
following reasons:
1. The original evidence of title shows that the
grant was one under the colonization laws of Mex-
ico. and could net therefore exceed the quantity of
eleven square leagues.
2. The extent ot said tract under said title, as far
as I am able to judge, was simply a long narrow
vallev, situate between two ranges of mountains,
and bounded by the Arroyo de la Uarpenteria in the
east, and the Paraje de los Prietos in the west, and
about three leagues in extent, according to the scalo
on tlie map or disriio.
The parties demurred to these views, and requested
that the survey, as executed, bo forwarded for the
decision of the department.
In order that ail parties m interest should have an
opportunity to be beaut, I caused a publication of
the survey to be made under the act of 1864.
Under these circumstances, I herewith forward the
plat of survey for your decision, with my expressed
opinion, as above, and accompany tho samo with the
following documents:
