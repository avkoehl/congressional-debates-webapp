once disappear, if you could restore specie pay-
ments throughout the Union.
But if the banks should all pay specie to-tror-
row, we have no security wha ever that they would
not, organized as th3y are at present, sotn again
suspend. Theie are mo restrictions, which, it im
posed upon them, would always injure a sound
bank note currency to the people of h" United
States, and prevent future suspensions Fir ', if
you would render them able at all times to pay
specie, you must require that ih y 'ha'I at a 1
times keep on hand at least on? do'lar oí gold and
silver for every three dollars of h*ir deposites and
circulation combined. But this alo^e mi^ht not
prove sufficient They misht pos e's the ability
to pay, without the will To seccre th s, you must
impose another restriction, which will prove tobe
an infallible preventive of suspeis on Declare in
the charter of each Bank, by a self-execu ipg pro
vision, which nothing can arrest, hit the moment
it J&spends specie payments it shall "die the delta "
"In the day that thou eatest thereof ihou shaltsuie-
ly die " Render it ihe irreversible, organic la v,
of each bank's existence, thit a suspension of spe-
cie payments shall produce i's civil death, and the
instinct of self preservation will then compel it to
perform its datws in such a manner as to preserve
its Ufe. Upon this principle, a bankrupt l?w ap-
plied to banks would do more in ^curing a sound
currency for the people of the United States, than
twenty National Banks scattered over the whole
country could accomplish, even if they were di<
posed to exert all th .r power Wh«n it was first
proposed to apply a bankrupt law to banks, I felt
strongly inclined to oppose it But I am not one
of those who pride ihemse'ves in their unifoim
consistency throughout life Live and loam is my
maxim. I trust I am wiser this year han I was
the last, and that, if I live, I °hall b  wiser next
year, or twenty years hence, than I am at present
Tne man who prides himself upon never having
changed an opinion, proclaims himself to have
been infallible from the beginning, and thu' an
Bounces himself a blockhead Any Senator, there-
fore, has my entire permission lo ransack the old
journals and prove that I voted many years a-to on
any subject differe? tly from whit I should do at
present. I have changed my op mon m regard to
a bankrupt law as applied to bank , and this be-
cause I most solemnly believe that it is the on'y
remedy which can reach the root c f the evil and
secure to the people, at all umes and in all places,
a paper currency convertible mtj gold and silver
\  But the committee say that this bank "will
poweriuliy contribute to the resumption of specie
payments " How will it produce «nihan effect ?
It is not sufficient that a declaration of this kind
shall be made ev cathedra m order to command
our faith Will it be by producing a new and
greatly increased demand for specie m order to
iurmsh a capital foi the bank. Ask Mr Chetes
who is I believe the avowed author of those able
numbers which have appealed in the Charleston
Mercury, above the signature of "Jay," wfether
the late Bank of the United States cintribi ted es-
sentially to the resumption of specie payments,
when it firs  went into < pcration, and he will an-
swerdecidcdly in the negative He ought to know
this /act if it existed, because h? saved the Bank
from rum at an early period o1" i s ctreer
The seven millions of gold and silver which the
charter requires to be paid by iIip private stock-
holders before the Bank can go mto(pei <t on, must
be chiefly drawn from the vaults of specie paying
banks. In addition lo this, the jai"? amount which
will be taken by our own ci'izpns of the sixteen mil-
lions and a half of the bank stock loan, to *ay no-
thing of the twelve million loan, must b> principa -
)y derived from the same source Tne probability is,
that the run which this must ecca ion on tne specie-
paying banks, will compel them to suspend. The
banks a'ready suspended will hold fast vhat srecie
they have got. Self-prescv-itu n w 111 < rnpel them
to pursue this course In this manner, then, th°
estab ishment of the Bank, so far from promoting
a resumption of specie payrrents, will prolong ih-
suspension, and may, m all human probabihn,
render it universal. If the existing solvent banks
hnnld be able to meet the demand for specie which
wilt thus be m'de uoon them, it wi'l be by such a
sudden cur ailment of their loa > a-"d iss -es
as will produ e rain and di-tre s ¡rfoughout
the land We er, never, w^s there a more
\* auspicious mon eat than th- presert for cs-
rabli hmg a Bark oí the Un.ied Sia'e , and
I trust that its inends will take tbis'view of the
subject in'o their delibeiateconsid-ration and post-
pone the question at lean until D c mbei. Let
th*  general nusiness of the country be restored,
and then, and not till then, let th<-m begin to ihiok
senou'ly on the subject of establishing a Bji k of
the United S ates
But even if specie pay men's had been univer-
sally re='ored, and bus ne-s were again prosperous,
I deny that this Bank wid ever regulate the S a e
banks in such a manner as to prevent the ru>nous
expansions and contractions in our currency which
have efflicted the country throughout its history, or
seenr . us against fu ine suspensions This Bank
would not thus retrain the S ate Bank  if it could
__it   eould not  if  it   would      On  this p nt I
shall be as bu f as possible, having already occu-
pied moie of your time than I bad intended.
Andi n the tir-tpl ce, this Bank will feel no dis-
position v hatever to restrain 'he issues and loans cf
the local banks witbm reasonable Imi s And
why1 Because its duty as a regulator of the
currency n in direct opp «i ion to the interest of
its stockholders If you desire lo create one pow-
er for the purpose of restraimog another, you must
ma''e them "antagomstical" either in point ot in-
teract or of inclination, or of bo h But will you
change the nature of these nne directors and make
•hem better than other men, t y placing thpm at the
head of A Naional Bank? I! you cannot work
ihismi aele, they wi 1 ¡hen teel th  same in ere^t,
and ihe «-ame inclination with the Director  of the
State Banks to expand the currency—to acco no-
dale their favo lies and fn-nds—to make money
plenty, and to increase the profits of the stock-
holders
No, sir, no, n the honest opinion of my soul, so
far from making these «Vectors better, you will
make them worse lhan other men. Stationed here
at Ihe Capitol, and under the baneful influence of
high y exuted polii"al feeling, I be'icve ihey will
be even less inclined to act as a restraining power
than the directors of many other Banks of the
country Thfir first impulse will be to promote
their own i iterest, and to a commodate thur
friends as far as popule And yet tri i> the
powei whi h you intend toestpb i\h or tre purpose
ot comroliog the Governffien of the State banks,
ind preventing them from bu a gnil y of excess
They would not do tri if ih y ccud, because
they wi 1 act upon the same universal law which
governs all bankers and direeiors of banks, and
impels ihem to exterd tknr business and increase
th ir profi's as far as practicable.
But I say that this Bank could not restrain the
Slate banks, even if it would, and th s want of
power has been recently demonstrated in England
It would be easy for me to maintain this position
b/ arguments, a prion, and to prove ib t this
Lank, with a capit I if thirty millions, could not
control ihe issues of athoosand State banks, whose
combined capual is more lhan ten umes that
amount, but, reasoning would be only a waste of
lime when ihis cone usion has been established by
well known fads In ]836, the Bank of ling and
clearly foresaw ihe appioach of th  storm which
ufterwaros <pread ruin over that country as   II as
this Tne foteigi exchanges weie against Erg-
Un 1, and =p cie was exported The pa
per currency had b<cime s0 expanded, that
the pi ices of all domestic productions were
high, and consequently it was the interest of fo
reigners to sell every thing they could m lhat coun-
try, aDd buy as little iheie as po*sibI  Under
thesecircumstanc «, the Banko England determin-
ed to put tor hall us power,m ordert) redu ]rc s
and restore the equ¡ lbnumof the for-ignexohang s
It accoidmgly commenced a system of r pi I cur
latlment ot us loans and issues in the vain hope
that the joint stock banks of the kingdom would be
compelled to follow its example Much to its
astonishment, it found that as it contracted, they
expanded, and at the end of the process there was
more paper money in circulation (han at its com-
mencerrent So entirely satffied are well in-
formad men in England that their National Bank,
even with a capital rf «evenly mil ions of dollars,
cwnot contr< 1 these expans ons pnd contractions
of the cui rency, that ihev now seriously think of con-
fining t! e issues of piper money to one Bank to
be under the control of the Government, and of
excluding a'l the other b?nks of th" kingdom from
the eijoymen'ot this privilege And yet, in the
fac-of this well known fact, it is seriously con-
tended here that this Bank of thirty mill ons will
posses  the power to control the loans and issues
<f the thousand banks scattered ever our vast coun-
try It wil do no good in this respect, bat much
evil.
Daring the period of the late Baik's existence,
it was the pi mary and efficient ciu e ot all the
very great expansions vvhich aPl cted the country.
I sha'l mei ti n but one of these, nough I might
refer to those of 1823, 1831, and 1834 In the
yea's 1816, 1817, and 1818, .he first thiee jears
ater the date of it  charter, what nai its course'
It was a m^re sp=culating machine It expanded
the currency to such an extent and made money so
p'enty that ever/ rii g rose t > an enormous price
In the county where I reside, land commanded
from two to four hundred d< liars per acre, ?nd m
one msiance I know a tract to have been sold for
#1,500 per acre. Tie exoarston of the Bank of
the United States encouragtd all the country banks
It fol'o / ns exatrple, ard bank notes became so
cheap that t required al-rge amount of th m to
purchase any article of \ vlue The Bank ihus
h erally stimulated the spirit of speculation to such
a high degree as almost to produce a general de-
rangement of the public mind. Such ex ravagance
wa-* never witnessed before
The revulsion cane, a^ come it always must,
and th1 Bank, to all app arance, was in the last
agony It was then that Mr Cheves was called
to preside over it. In order to save it from de-
struction, he was compelled to reduce its loans and
curtail it issues witti unexampled rapidity and
m consequence, the years 1819, 1820, and 1831,
were the most disastrous that this coundy has ever
experienced since the Revolutionary war There
was wore individual rum—more propeity changed
hands by forced sales—during those three yea
than we have witnessed in a similar period beff .
or sincp, and all attnbutab'e dire-ctly to the influ
enee an t exartip'c of ihti g eat te^ulalor of the
currency. In 1821, the price of flour sunk to
$3 75 per baue] m Pmlade phr, and as far west
as th State et O n j it scaicely commanded any
prie There is no new thug urd r the sun, and
should this Bank ever get into successful cp~-
ration, from the very law of i s noture, it will fol-
io  in the foots ens o' it-, lllus'r ous predecessor.
It will be powerful to do evil, but feeb'e to produce
gord
The las* reason winch has been given by the Se-
nator from Kentucky why we shou'd establish a
Btnk of the Uní ed S ates, is, ihat other nations
have National Banks and therefore that we al-o
ought to have such an ms itution Let me
say, in the fi st place, that other nati ns
have no such Bank as the one which we propose
to establish The Bar Its ef Prance ard England
be ong to indiv duals, and no part of th^ stock of
either is he I by the Government But, under this
charttr, out Republic 'n Goverr merit is to ally is
