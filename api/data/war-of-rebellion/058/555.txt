in relation to Mobile indicating necessities there, it is deemed advisable that you should at once send these brigades back to their proper command. The difficulty of transporting Clanton's brigade to Virginia, and of sending troops thence to the Department of Mobile, is a serious objection to your proposition for such an exchange. Could you not advantageously make an exchange with troops in your own command?

Your dispatch to the Secretary of War asking to be informed of the extent of your command is answered in a letter by to-day's mail.

S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General.

General JOHNSTON,

Dalton:

I have concluded to retain Colonel Kennard. I have telegraphed President Davis in regard to the troops, and have said, as I thought an attack on Mobile was now plainly determined upon, he should order the four brigades to me for the emergency.
