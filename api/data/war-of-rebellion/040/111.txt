HEADQUARTERS CAVALRY CORPS,February 28, 1863.

General S. WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Army of the Potomac:

GENERAL: There are now in the cavalry corps about 12,000 men, and 13,000 horses, present for duty. The last return showed 11,955 enlisted men and 13,875 horses. The line this force has to guard is but little less than 100 miles. One-third on duty at one time gives 40 men to the mile on post at one time, and one-third of these gives 13 to the mile on post at one time. Considering the condition of the roads, it is a good day's march to get out to the line and another to return, so that actually the horses are out one-half the time or more. Added to this the fact that frequently the whole cavalry force is in the saddle for several days together, and it will be perceived that but little more than one-third of the time is allowed the horses in which to recruit.

I consider it my duty to call these facts to the attention of the general commanding for his information, which I should have done before, perhaps, but for the thought that I might possibly be considered as complaining. Should the general consider it expedient to diminish the amount of duty at present being performed by the cavalry, either by weakening or contracting the lines as now established, or by substituting a system of patrols for stationary vedettes, or in any other mode he may prescribe, I shall most gladly do so, and consider that the interests of the service have been benefitted thereby.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEORGE STONEMAN,

Brigadier-General, Commanding Corps.
