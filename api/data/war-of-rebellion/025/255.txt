Major General U. S. GRANT, Jackson, Tenn.:

I have sent a heavy cavalry reconnaissance toward Pocahontas. My own division has only two brigades, each of five regiments. Ross has four brigades. I will hold eight regiments ready to march as soon as I hear from thee roads south and west. No further news from Pocahontas. It is reported that the exchanged prisoners from Vicksburg are arriving at Davis' Mill.
