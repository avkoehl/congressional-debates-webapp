THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
March 3,
briefly advocated its expediency, and moved that
the House adhere
The SPEAKER explained that this motion
would peril the whole bill, and if both Houses
adhere, the bill would be lost
Mr BOND was aware of the consequences,
but he should persist in his motion nevertheless
Mr McKENNAN did hope the gentleman
would substitute the motion to " insist,"and not
peril the bill in this way
Aftei a few words fiom Messrs ATHER-
TON, WILLIAMS of North Carolina, BRIGQS,
GRENNELL, HAUL AN.WILLIAMS of Ken-
tucky, GARLAND of Louisiana, ITLLMORE,
TILLINGHAST, RIVES, BANKS.and BELL,
Mr GRAHAM, of North Carolina, demanded
the yeas and nay?, which weie oidered
After a number of suggestions from Messrs
RIVES, BELL, and others,
Mr. BOND substituted a motion to insist
Mi RIVES, as being more respectful to the
other body,moved thatthe House " recede" from
its disagreement to the proposed amendment of
the Senate
Mr CAMPBELL, of Tennessee, demanded
the yeas and nays, which wtio ordered
Mr HARLAN said, as the executive printing
had been a monopoly for years he hoped the pro-
fessed anti-monopolists, the Locofoeos, would
now show the sincerity of their professions by
their votes
The question being then taken, the icsult was
—yeas 80, n lys 93
So the House lefusmg to recede, the question
reeuried upon the motion to insist
Mr LOOMIS moved to imend the motion by
adding the words " and ask a committee of con
feience," but the amendment was dirigíeed to
The motion to insist was then earned without
a division
The other amendment, upon which the Senate
had, in part, moisted, m relation to the Docu
mentary History, was then taken up
Mr PETRUvIN moved that the House in-
sist
Mr TOUCEY moved that the House recede
from its disagreement
Mi ATHCRTONcalkdfoi the yeas and nays,
but they were not oidered and Mr Toiciy's
motion was tejeeted—ayes sixty six, noes not
counted
The motion to insist was then agreed to with
out a division
Ata subsequent stage, tin bill was returned
from the bínate, accompanied by a message,
stating that they still insisted, and isk< d a torn
mitde of conferenee, having aj p jinUd a commit
tee of tluec on then part
Mr CAM BR CIENO moved to conem in the
resolution foi a conference, which was agreed to,
and, on his motion, a committer of tlnee was ap-
pointed on the part of the House, consisting of
Mr Bond of Ohio, M  A rueRTON- oí Ni w Hamp-
shire, and Mi  Iivcolm of Massachusetts
About seven o'clock at night, Mr BOND made
a «epoit from the committee ot imit k nce,whi< h
recommended the Senate, in part, to lecede, and
m pait to insist, upon their am ndment,with the
addition that the printing shall be c\ uttd m
the city of Washington, and lecommuidcd th it
the Senate recede ftom part of their rmendment
striking out the appropnation fir the Document
ary Htstoiy, but only so fai as the House was
concerned, the Senate abstaining fiom taking the
books
Theieportwas concurred m witnouta division,
but, at a subsequent stage, at the instance of Mi
BELL,
Mi BOND moved a reconsideration of the vote
by winch the last matter wa<¡ agieed to and,
after a desultorv discussion by Messrs BOND,
LINCOLN, and BELL,
Mr WILLIAMS, of Kentucky, sud that,
rathei than peril a bill upon which the temporaiy
existence of the Government depended, upon a
mere point of etiquette, he should demand ti e
previous question, and it was seconded, earned,
and the main question ordered and put, when the
House refused to reconsider—ayes 54, noes 84
ARJ1Y  APPROPRIATION BILL.
On motion ofMi CAMBRET C\G, the House
went into Committee of the Whole on the state
of the Union, (Mr Briggs m the chan )
Mr. McKENNAN moved to take up the Cum-
berland road bill
The CHAIRMAN, however, ruled that the
Committee must first dispose of the business
underconsiderationwhen thecommitteelast lose,
which was the At my bill
Mr CASEY inquired if the Cumberland road
was not necessarily in order, as the House had
gone into committee generally'
The CHAIRMAN replied that it was not, and
reiterated his decision
Mr McKENNAN appealed therefrom, but
after some remarks from that gentleman and
Mcssis CAMBRELENG, LINCOLN, and
RARIDEN, he withdlCw it
The committee then resumed the consideration
of the Armyappropnation bill,the question pend-
ing being on the piovision to pay the State oe
Massachusetts #272,71G foi her militia claims for
services in the late war
This was an amendment of theSenate, andthe
question was on concurring therein
Mr LINCOLN waimly advocated the claim,
and went on to show that it was scarcely a sev-
enth of what Massachusetts was justly entitled
to, and that ltprecis ly accorded in punciple with
the already paid claims of Connecticut, New
Yoik, Maiyland, Vnginia, South Caiolma, and
othei States, proceeding to establish th< lattei
point by a review of the services actually pel
foimed by the militia of Massac husetts
Mi COLLS opposed th aim ndtnent He ob-
jected to the minnir in which it was intioduced,
by thus mgiafting substantive piopositnns upon
bills with which they have no connection It was
a loose mode of legislation, eve i to be deprec ited,
and was establishing a bad precedent More-
ovei, the validity of the claim for so large an
amount was not proven, and was doubtful It
had nevet yi t been audited and therefoie the
House would be voting awiy upwanlsof aquar
tei of a million of dollars m the dark Mr C
went into a variety of minute stuements of the
various items composing this gross sum, in order
to show that the claim ought not to be passeel
The evidence m suppoitof a numbei of the items
was deficient
Mi CAMBRELENG entieated gentlemen to
abstain fiom speaking, foi if the y weie to go inn
tin mcnts of thco ancient claims, they would
have to sit ill night again
Mr   LVANS said the claim had been audited
in tb36   anil although then then was not suffi
cicnt e vide nee to e st ibhsh all the items, yet since
Í th it time C ongie ss hael adopte d a new principle
of evidence, and upon  the   apphcition of that
j punciple this rlaim wis valid                                   j
Mi JOHNSON, of Maiyland, moved to amend
the amendment by adding the following                 ]

| a piovision that the Cherokee waniois wounded,
etc , in  the late wir with brreat Britain, should
I  be placed on the pension i oil like othei pension-
ers, which was agreed to
Mi GARLAjND, orLouisiana, remarked upon
the large s mis involved in the Senate's amend-
ments, and ¿nquned if they had undeigone ex
animation ?

the ícquisitions of the treaties, and had found
them accurate in eveiy instance

ARMY APPROPRIATION BILL.
The SPEAKER having resumed the chair, the
Army appropriation bill was taken up, and the

their concurrence with the Senate's amendments,
Mr CAMBRELENG moved to non-concur m

ment for the payment for the Missouri horses,
lost in the voyage ftom New Oileans to Tampa

ment of the Senate was concuned in

Ildihoad Company He stated that he would not
ask thefavoi, but, though he had been in the
House all day, indisposition would compel him
to leave the Hal!
Mr  LINCOLN objecting,

but it was ineffectual
