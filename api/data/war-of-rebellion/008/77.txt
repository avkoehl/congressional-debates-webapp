NEW MADRID, MO., April 1, 1862.

Was absent when your dispatch arrived. Canal is finished and boats now descending bayou to this place; expect them here to-night. Enemy commenced erecting batteries at points of high land, only landing places on river; little serious to be feared from them. Our floating battery, properly placed, will deal easily with them or any other obstacle to landing. Have erected two batteries, of two 32s each, but a mile and a half below the 24-pounder battery, opposite mouth of slough (see sketch sent you).+ These batteries cover handsomely the landing on opposite shore. I have no apprehension of the result. Commodore Foote promises to run a couple of his boats past Island Numbers 10 to-night. If so, all difficulty is over. Troops in fine condition and can be relied on. Railroad to Sikeston under water and roads to Commerce bad. Best send anything for this command to Island Numbers 8, with orders to Colonel buford to send it through the canal in barges or flats; easy communication in this way for stores. Do not be uneasy; no precaution will be omitted, and there is no fear of the result in the command. I
