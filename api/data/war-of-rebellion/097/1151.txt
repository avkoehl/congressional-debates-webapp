HEADQUARTERS U. S. FORCES, PETERSBURG, &amp;C., VA.,Petersburg, May 14, 1862.

Major-General ORD,

Commanding Department of Virginia:

Have sent copies of all general orders to department headquarters promptly; will send file complete to-morrow. Have placed General McKibbin in command of Sub-District South of Appomattox, consisting of counties of Amelia, Nottoway, Prince George, Dinwiddie, Sussex, and Surry, and General Ferrero in command of Sub-District of Petersburg. McKibbin has just returned from tour through his district to ascertain its condition and necessities, under letter of instructions from me, which I will send with orders to-morrow. Money was needed for farmers unable to obtain men. Abbot's brigade being just taken from my command I have now no troops north of Appomattox, and no territorial jurisdiction there. No troops under my command now except Ferrero's division, one brigade of which is in and about Petersburg, and the other, under McKibbin, which has been weakened by taking from it the One hundred and fourth Pennsylvania Regiment, will occupy his sub-district. Part of Sixth Corps is within this district; don't known what their instructions or duties are. Cavalry here should be under my command, as men in my district complain to me of their depredations, and I cannot order them righted.

GEO. L. HARTSUFF,

Major-General.
