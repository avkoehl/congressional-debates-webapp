thereof safe and easy, shall be defrayed out of the TVearary
of the United Slates: Provided, That such light-houses,
beacons, buoys, aud public piers, shall be ceded to ana
vested in the United States, by the Stale or States in which
they are situated, together with the iands and tenements
thereunto belonging, with the jurisdiction of the same."
And it was by that act made the duty of the
Secretary of the Treasury to provide by contracts
for rebuilding them when necessary, and for fur-
nishing them with necessary supplies; and also, to
agree for the salaries, wages, or hire of the per-
sons appointed for the superintendence of the
same.
By this act of the first Congress, approved by
General "Washington, the United States assumed
jurisdiction and control over all the light-houses,
beacons, buoys and public piers in the United
States, the title and jurisdiction of which should
be ceded to them by the States in which they were
situated. They were placed under the charge of
the Secretary of the Treasury, and the faith of the
Federal Government was pledged to maintain and
support them forever afterwards; and this pledge,
in respect to the light-house establishment, has
been kept good by the Government. I have looked
over the appropriation bills from the passage of
that act to the present time, embracing a period of
seventy years, and find that in every year there
has been appropriations not only for those for
which they were pledged to support, but for all
the lighthouses, light-boats, beacons, buoys, &c.,
that have since been authorized by law.
The first Congress also made it the duty of the
Secretary of the Treasury, by the same law, to
provide by contract for building a new light-house
near the entrance of the Chesapeake Bay. At the
nest session of Congress, in 1790, he was author-
ized to finish the light-house on Portland Head,
and at the same session the annual appropriations
in the civil and diplomatic bill were commenced for
the " support of light-houses, beacons, buoys, and
public piere," and have been annually continued,
without the omission of a single year, from that
time to the present. ^
These appropriations have been embraced the
general appropriation bills, and have therefore been
as permanent and uniform as the appropriations
for the support of the Government.

Mr. SPAULDING. I do. [Great laughter.]
Mr. BURT. Then I have nothing further to
*fcr
* The exact amount appropriated for this purpose by the
act of August 12, 1790, and the act of February 12, 1791,
does not appear in the acta themselves, but appears in the
accounts of the Secretary of the Treasury. (
The following additional light-houses, beacons, I
&c., were authorized during General Washing-
ton's administration :
In 1792, appropriations were made to finish the
light-house on Bald Head, at the mouth of the
Cape Pear river; floating beacons and buoys in
the harbor of Charleston, South Carolina; three
floating beacons in the Chesapeake bay; and a
light-house on Montauk point. In 1793, a bea-
con or buoy was authorized on Smith's Point, in
the Chesapeake bay, and the like on Royal Shoal,
near Ocracoke inlet. In 1794-'5-'6 and '7, Gen- ,
eral Washington also approved bills for buoys on
the rocks off New London; a beacon and two
btioys in the harbor of Portsmouth; light-house at
Cape Hatteras; a lighted beacon on Shellcastle
Island, in North Carolina; light-house near the
Kenebeck river; a beacon and three buoys at the
entrance of St. Mary's river; light-house at the
entrance of the harbor of Georgetown, South"
Carolina; buoys in Cape Fear river; light-house on
Baker's Island, near Salem, Massachusetts; light-
house on Cape Cod, and sixteen buoys in Boston
harbor.
I have gone into this detail of facts for the pur-
pose of proving conclusively that the practical men
during Washington's administration, conspicuous
in forming the Constitution, and who gave a prac-
tical construction to it during the first eight years
after its adoption, fully established the principle of
making appropriations from the National Treasury
to facilitate, protect, and foster the commerce and
navigation of the country.
During the next four years, from 1797 to 1801,
this system was carried forward under the admin-
istration of John Adams, in the same manner as
it was under the previous administration ofWash-
ington;new light-houses,buoys and beacons were
authorized and the annual appropriations were con-
tinued in the general appropriation bill for the
support of the light-house establishment.
From 1801 to 1809, Thomas Jefferson, who is
claimed lo be the great apostle of Democracy and
liberty, was at the head of the Government. The
chairman of the committee who reported the bill
under consideration,- [Mr. McLan*,] alluded very
briefly to the fact that Thomas Jefferson, the great
apostle of Democracy, did by his approval of
bills for internal improvements, support this sys-
tem, although he expressed doubts respecting its
constitutionality. But in order to bring this mat-
ter more clearly to the committee, I take the lib-
erty of referring to some facts connected with his
Administration. He is, however, regarded as good
authority on all doubtful constructions of the Con-
stitution. Although, in one of his messages, he
thinks it desirable that there should be an amend
ment of the Constitution, giving more enlarged
powers on this subject, to make expenditures,
"within the States;" yet in every year he approved
bills for some or all of these works of internal im
provement. In each year he approved the an-
nual appropriation bill for the support of the light-
house establishment. He also approved bills for
the erection of new light-houses, beacons, buoys,
and public piers.
Mr. BURT, (interrupting.) Will the gentle-
man from New York allow me to make a single
remark ?
Mr. SPAULDING. Certainly.
Mr. BURT. If the gentleman addressed his
remarks to me, I have only to ask him if he has
read the messages of Jefferson ?
Mr. SPAULDING. I have.
Mr. BURT. I will ask the gentleman if he has
read the message of 1806 ?
Mr. SPAULDING. I have. [Laughter.]
Mr. BURT. Then I ask the gentleman from
New York if, after reading that message, he makes
the statement'which he has just made to this
committee?
r. SPAULDING. I will say to the gen-
tleman from South Carolina, [Mr. Burt,] that I
stated at the commencement of my remarks that
Mr. Jefferson questioned the constitutionality of
making these appropriatians; yet while he was
questioning this power he approved three very
important bills to carry forward the great system
of internal improvements for which we are now
contending. I look to his public and /fficial acts
for a just exposition of his principles, and espe-
cially to his views respecting those works of na-
tional importance in which more than one State has
a common interest. Sir, gentlemen may write
messages, make speeches, pass resolutions, and
even giv« pledges as to their principles and course
of future action, but, after all, the best test of
fidelity of any man to his principles is his official
■ votes, and the signature of the President to the bills
that are made the law of the land by such official
acts. I will therefore refer to the acts of Con-
gress, passed during Mr. Jefferson's administra-
tion, to ascertain what principles were established
by him.
At the first session of Congress after his inaugu-
ration, an act was passed authorizing the erection
of "certain light-houses, and for other purposes."
The first section of this act authorizes the Secre-
tary of the Treasury " to purchase for the use of
' the United States the land whereon stood the
' light-house on Gurnet Point, and so much land
' adjoining thereto as may be sufficient for vaults
' and any other purposes necessary for the better
' support of said light-house."
The second section authorizes the Secretary of
the Treasury to rebuild the light-house on Gurnet
Point, at the entrance of Plymouth harbor.
The third section authorizes him to rebuild the
light-house on Newcastle Island, at the entrance of
Piscataqua river.
The fourth section authorizes him to cause to be
erected a light-house on Lynd's Point, at the
mouth of the Connecticut river.
The Jiflh section authorizes " proper light-houses
' to be built, and buoys to be placed in the stations
' necessary for the navigation of Long Island
' Sound: Provided, That sufficient land for the ac-
' commodation of such light-houses can be pur-
' chased at a reasonable price; and that the Legis-
' latures of Rhode Island, Connecticut, and New
; ' Yoijt shall respectively cede the jurisdiction over
! ' the same to the United States." *
! The sixth section authorizes a " sufficient light-
| house" to be erected on Cumberland Island, at
the mouth of St. Mary's river, in Georgia.
The seventh section appropriates $21,270 to ac-
complish the objects specified in the preceding
sections.
The eighth section is in these words:
" Sec. 8. Jind he it further enacted, That it shall be law-
ful for the Secretary of the Treasury, under the direction
of the President of the United States, to cause to be expend-
ed in repairing and erecting public piers in the river Del-
aware, a sum not exceeding $30,000, and that the same be
paid out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise appro-
priated : Provided, That the jurisdiction of the site where
any such piers may be erected shalL^e first ceded to the
United States, according to the conditions in such case by
law provided.
" Approved April 6,1802. TH. JEFFERSON. 
So, sir, it will be seen that Mr. Jefferson, as
early as 1802, approved a bill in principle essentially
like the harbor and river bill now under considera-
I tion. Sir, six distinct objects, extending from
{ Massachusetts to Georgia, are embraced in this
i bill. It is what my friend from Louisiana [Mr.
J Morse] would call a " log-rolling" bill, and yet
I' there can be no doubt each object is of national
1 importance; and I think Mr. Jefferson was clearly
. right in approving it, and that he forfeited none of
his claims upon the Democrat for this official act.
I But, sir, this is not all. .Mr. Jefferson enlarged
| and extended the system of internal improvement
beyond the limit it had been carried under Wash-
ington and Adams.
cumberland road.
On the 29th March, 1806, Mr. Jefferson ap-
proved the bill for the commencement of the Cum-
berland road, from Cumberland, in the State of
Maryland, across Pennsylvania and a part of Vir-
ginia, to Ohio, and the sum of $30,000 was appro-
priated to commence the work. Since that time
