not having any men that can be spared from this place, as I am momentarily expecting an attack. Yesterday Todd with eighty men was at Mrs. Shanks', nine miles from here, in the direction of Hickman Mills.

GUY C. MANVILLE,

Lieutenant Second Colorado Cavalry, Commanding Station.
HDQRS. DISTRICT OF SOUTHWEST MISSOURI, Springfield, Mo., July 19, 1864.

Colonel M. LA RUE HARRISON, Fayetteville, Ark.:

I congratulate you on your and Major Galloway's success over Brown and Pickler and upon your getting back so much stock. I had ordered Major Burch to move down from Neosho and attack Brown and Pickler, Major Galloway has taken the job from his hands. Your order [for] stores will be sent forward as soon as they arrive here. General Price has issued such an order as you speak of. The force east of you was Jackman's. Shelby has been and is concentrating all his forces and all the forces in Northern Arkansas at a point between Jacksonport and Devall's Bluff. He is there with his command proper, and Tracy's, Schnable's, Jackman's, Freeman's and Love's, and all the commands in Northern Arkansas have gone to him. The design is undoubtedly to attack Steele's communication. Everything is very quiet in the district, but much trouble in Northern Missouri. My troops are at Easley's Ferry, and scout to and south of Berryville.

JOHN B. SANBORN,Brigadier-General, Commanding.

SAINT JOSEPH, July 19, 1864.

Colonel O. D. GREENE,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

Thornton and his Confederate fiends are now in Livingston County, about 400 strong. They are about fifteen miles southwest from Utica. They are leaving a track of blood and ashes. I have ordered the troops at Chillicothe and Brookfield to concentrate and follow him. Colonel Ford abandoned pursuit too soon. I have requested General Craig, Enrolled Missouri Militia, to call out all the loyal militia of the northwest. We shall need them,and when out I can recruit from therm for the U. S.service men. While sensible that I must have aid before regular details can furnish them, I shall appeal at once to the people to rally to the number of 5,000, with their horses, guns, ammunition, and blankets, to join in a hunt which at least will exterminate the entire horde of bushwhackers. I shall put this force of minuteman in command of the best officers I can find, in order to prevent a wanton destruction of property. Is there any objection to these proceedings?
