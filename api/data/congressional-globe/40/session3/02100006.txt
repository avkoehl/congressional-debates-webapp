cheap ocean postage.
Mr. SUMNER submitted the following res-
olution ; which was ordered to lie oil the table

A resolution in favor of cheap ocean postage.
Whereas the inland postage on a letter throughout
the United States is three cents, while tho ocean
postage 011 a similar letter to Great Britain, under a
recent convention, is twelve cents, and on a letter
to J-'ranec is thirty cents, being a buideubome tax,
amounting often to a prohibition of foreign corre-
spondence ; yet letters can be carried at less cost on
sea than on land; and whereas by increasing cor-
respondence, and also by bringing into themails mail-
able matters, often nowclandestinelyeonveyed,cheap
ocean postage would become self-supporting. And
whore-is cheap oceau postage would tend to quicken
commerce, to diffa.se knowledge, to promote the m-
tereouise of families and friends separated by the
ocean, to multiply the bonds of peace and good will
among men and nations, to advance the progress of
liberal ideas; and thus, while important to every
citizen, it would become the active ally of the mer-
chant, the emigrant, the philanthropist, and the
friend of liberty: Therefore,
Be it reeolved, That the President of the United
States be requested to open negotiations with the
European Powers, particularly with Great Britain,
France, and Germany, for the establishment of cheap
ocean'postage.

HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
Monday, December 7, 1868.
In conformity to the Constitution and laws,
the Fortieth Congress of the United States of
America convened this day in its third session.
At twelve o'clock m. lion. Schuyler Colfax,
Speaker of the House of Representatives, a
member from the State of Indiana, called the
House to order.
Rev. C. B. Boyntox, the Chaplain, offered
prayer as follows;
Almighty and most merciful God, our Father
who art in Heaven 1 We give Thee most hearty
thanks for Thy preserving care, through which
all of us here present have been kept during
the time when we have been absent from each
other and this place, and through which we
are permitted once more to gather here and
enter upon the duties that belong to our several
stations. We bless Thee, 0 God, that the Con-
gress of the United States assembles now under
circumstances that seem to promise so much
for the future of this country after the strife
and the agitation of the political contest is over,
and when men can address themselves to pro-
mote the highest interests of the country un-
trammeled, as they were not before. And while
we look round us upon some vacant seats we
are reminded especially that it is through Thy
care that any of us are here alive. And we
pray Thee, 0 God, that those who have been
written down as mourners may be comforted
of God.
And now we desire to commend, in faith on
the Lord Jesus Christ, these legislators to Thy
holy keeping; and we beseech Thee to impart
unto them a wisdom that shall enable them to
plan and execute all such measures as may
tend to produce universal and stable prosperity
and peace. So far as law can do it may they
restrain all violence and disorder; and do Thou
add, 0 God, a force greater than human law—-
the teachings of Thy Holy Spirit, the power of
Thy truth, so that men's hearts shall incline
them to do right without the restraining influ-
ence of a statute. Bless all who are engaged
in governing the land. May the benediction
of God rest on the whole population, and we be
prepared at length for that "rest that remain-
eth for the people of God," for Jesus sake.
Amen.
