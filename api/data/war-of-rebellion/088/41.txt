Major-General HUMPHREYS,Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: Two deserters from the Eleventh Florida, who left the picket-line last night and came in this morning, report that their brigade is still lying in one rank. They think that the other brigades of their division which were taken out and moved down toward the mine have not yet returned. They understand that Heth's division is on their right, and heard officers say that Wilcox had gone down to Reams' Station. They are both men of very little intelligence, and their information is consequently exceedingly limited. One of these men states that on Sunday last he went from where his brigade lies at least a mile to the right, and did not see them mining anywhere along the line. He says the new earth thrown up is for the protection of their guns. He knows the position of the large fort on the line of the Fifth Corps, and says he has been opposite to that fort, and that there is no mining being done there. He thinks his brigade lies about half a mile to the right of where our mine exploded. He did not hear of any mining between his brigade and the latter point.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

They encamped immediately in the rear of their division last night.
