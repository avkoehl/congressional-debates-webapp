CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

was not able to conclude its labors, and make a re-
port after an investigation of a whole session, it was
the strongest proof which could be adduced of the
necessity of appointing this committee at the prese it
session of Congress- As to the Committee on the
Expenditures of the Executive Departments taking
charge of this subject ol the expenditures made in
this ¡tervice, he took it to be entirely out of the pro-
vince of their duties, as their business, so far as he
understood, was merely to take charge of the ex-
penditures connected with the administration of the
Departments When he had the honor of being at
the head of one of those Departments, reports on
expenditures related merely to the expenditures
connected with the Department, and no notice was
ever taken of the expenditures connecter with our
foreign affairs Of late years, honever, he behev-
ed these committees seldom took upon themselves
'o make any inquiries into the condition of the De-
partments at all, and, in support of this, he instanc-
ed that the chairman of one of those committees, at
a late session, had assprted on the floor than he did
not even know who were member  ol the commit-
tee, it never having bee i called togethei
Mr A then proceeded to make some comments
upon the composition of the military committee,
as regarded its polt'ical and geographical organi-
zation. He could not account lor the fact of there
being eight members on thit committee fiom the
southern and western States, while there was but
/one from the noithern and eastern States, unless it
■was because the whole benefits of the army of ihe
United States accrued to the people of the South
and West The whole miluiry an ay of the United
States was not of the slightest pecuniary benefit to
his constituents, and he did not know how the
gentleman from South Carolina, in his eve, (Mr
Thompson,) could reconcile this expenditure of
seven or eight millions of dol'ars in Florida with
the frequent asserti ns he had made on this floor
that the whole expenditures of the Government
flowed to the Noi th and Fast
At this stage oí the proceedings, on motion of Mr
CAMBRELENG, the House proceeded to the or-

*' The House went into Committee of the Whole,
"\ and resumed the consideration of the Senate bill
*, "imposing additional duties as depositones on pub-
*** lie officers, m certain cases "
*** Mi MASON resumed his remai ks He denied
>le'( any partiality for a national bank He had always
$* been known, both at home and abroad, as the un-
*K compiomismg foe of such an institution   He would
like gentlemen who advocated this bill to say what
thty would next re*ort to, m case it failed, ¡or fail
it must In his opinion, u could never be carried
out In that case, he did not know to what they
could «-esort, unless they went to the Treasury to
make a circulation, or threw themselves into the
arms of a national bank It was for that reason
he wished to oppose the present bill, for be was
convinced that it an issue of Treasury notes did
not effect reltef, nothing else would
Mr ROBERTSON gave notice, that at a proper
time he would offer an amendment, authorizing the
Secretary of ihe Treasury to deposite the public
money in such banks as chose to receive it, for a
fair compensation, as a special deposite, and with-
out discounting on or using the same
Mr R made some remarks in supnort of his
proposed amendment He contended that the
fatal objection to the bill was, the temptation pub-
lic officer* would be under to speculate on the
money in their possession
Mr GARLAND thought it his duty to make
some remarks on the amendment he had proposed
After leplymg to some arguments of his colleague
in relation to the Virginia barihs, he adverted to
the present bill He was sine the Government
would never piosper when divorced from the
banks, between whom and the people there still
existed a matrimonial connection It was his
opinion that, in less than eighteen months af er the
passage of this measure, the Government would
seek to re-umto itself with the banks The relief
now proposed to the people in lieu of Jhe State
banks, reminded him oí a certain criminal, who,
when on his way to the gallons, was offered a
reprieve on condition ol his marrying an u^l\,
wrinkled old woman The man, after a moment s
reflection, exclaimed
"A sentence hard 3 oj do nnpai t,
The-woman's woise—drive on the cart "
A.nd thus prefered hanging to a wedding on such
terms So the sentence was more preferable to
the people than the system now pioposed The
object of the divorce bill was to take the money
from banks and to deposite it with sub-agents But
111 his opinion, taking into consideration the frail-
ties of human mtuie, it would be a dangerous
scheme He did not mean to «ay that the officers
of Government had less integrity than othei men
but «hen the lamentable instances were called to
mind where individuals of lush standing had s« rr-
ficed an unblemished chaiactei foi a meie paltry
amount, it ought to teaeh a lesson to guide
them 111 the piesent instance He would repeat
the in it's of his colleague this mornmg, who had
said even the weds of cur Savioi weie, "lead us
not into temptation " He advocted the plan of
keeping the m ney 111 the vaults ol the ban! s, as
more secure, and particularly it the amendm nt
last off red weie ador ted, which provides that the
banks shall leceive the money as a special depos t ,
and wit! out using it in any way whatever lie
den ed that die banks weie insolvent as had bun
stattd He had leen lifoimedin unuuestu nab e
authority, tli it they weie as sound no  as bef le
they suspended specie payment As regarded the
proposed separation, he had always understood that
our sy stem ol Government, although necessan } divi-
ded miomanybranches, asall one But nowihey
talked ot a separation ñora those institutions of
which th< Ststes had laid the foundation, and
which they had cheri-hed to this time H >w
fearlul would be mat time, sh uld it ever occ u
when this Government should consider it as 1 s
duty to make its action m lependent of the States1
He d d not say that gentlemrn designed this but
he wot Id entieat (hem to reflect whether the pic-
sent measiue would not paie the way for such a
state of things The true policy oí Government
was to cement itself more closely wi'h the States,
and he had no d< ubt but that the 1 sue of 'lier-
sury notes would speedily aftoid relief, and enable
the banks to lesume specie pay merits It had bren
said that these notes wou dlay ihe foundation ot a
Treasury bank, but he had no apprehension ol that
kind, for the restrictions to tint b II n ould render
such a result impossible He contended that the
bank note system hid not had a í 111 tnal, and re-
ferred to  the Bank of Trance   and  other 111 titu-
tions, m support of his position. At the conclu-
sion of hrs remarks,
On motion of Mr. HAYNES, the committee

BANKRUPT LAW AGAINST BANKS
Mr GRUNDY mov ed that the Commntee on
the Judiciary be discharged from the fui ther cons -
deration of so much ol ihe President's Message as
i elated to the bankrupt law
On this motion
Mr BENTON rose and said The recommenda-
tion of the President for a bankrupt law, applicable
to banks and b inkeis,has been made the subject of
repeated animadveision on this floir, and that
winle the subject was not before the Senate, but m
the hands of a comm ttee I noticed these animad-
versions on a foimei occasion not for aigument,
but for the jjurposc of exnibitmg their unparh -
mental y character , to di sent from their justness ,
to express my ovv n approbation of the recommenda
Hon, and to de< lare mvself ready to support 1!,
whenever it could be done in a parliamentary man-
ner, and without obliquing into a discussion foreign
to the subject 111 h?nd The suitable occasion now
presents itself, and I embrace it with pleasure that
