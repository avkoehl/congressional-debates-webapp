General EASTON, Atlanta, Ga.:

The general does not wish to delay at all after this storm clears up, and there are indications of its doing so to-night. He wants everything ready as directed. Trains can be run to Cartersville and General Davis can haul from there his trains full. Say to Colonel Beckwith I will use all energy to get his stores to General Davis. Will let him know as soon as they arrive.

Colonel BECKWITH, Atlanta, Ga.:

Five trains are reported having left Chattanooga at 3 o'clock to- day and I judge they contain all you have ordered; but if there is any doubt about you having enough bread and salt, order it at once to come through rapidly by special trains. We may delayed a couple of days by this rain, and our force may amount to 60,000 by the increase of recruits joined.

Lieutenant James W. Railey has been relieved from duty with the Army of the Tennessee, and ordered to report to Captain Mordecai for assignment to duty as chief of ordnance, Department of the Ohio. If General Thomas retains command of the Army of the Cumberland, Captain S. C. Lyford might be relieved altogether, or else sent to the Army of the Ohio in Lieutenant Reilly's place, and Captain Mordecai could perform the duties of chief of ordnance, Department of the Cumberland.
