RICHMOND, VA., July 27, 1862

General D. H. HILL,Petersburg, Va.:

Report has reached me that Burnside has passed through Albemarle and Chesapeake Canal toward the eastern coast of North Carolina.

Though it seems improbable, it was thought well to send it to you.

JEFFERSON DAVIS.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA.

July 27, 1862

Major General LAFAYETTE McLAWS:

GENERAL: The commanding general wishes you to select positions, with due reference to support of your front lines, as will be best conducive to health of your command, not passing beyond the Mechanicsville road. The massing of troops toward Richmond is calculated to produce sickness among all; and it would be preferable to select camps for brigades separately, where good water, ground, &c. would afford pure air and convenient camps.

I am, general, respectfully, your obedient servant,R. H. CHILTON.

Assistant Adjutant-General.

JULY 28, 1862-7.30 a.m.

General S. G. FRENCH:

GENERAL: Will you please have Walker's and Daniel's brigades ordered to prepare three days' rations, and have ambulances, litters, &c., all ready. I want to move to-morrow night. The thing can be managed quietly. We might hint at an expedition to Suffolk.

Yours, truly.

D. H. HILL.

Major-General.
