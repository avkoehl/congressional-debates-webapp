HEADQUARTERS FIFTH CORPS, June 18, 1864-2.40 p.m.

Major-General MEADE:

The Fifth Corps will assault at 3 p.m.

FIFTH CORPS, June 18, 1864-4 p.m.

General MEADE:

The assault has been made, so far as I can see. Our left advanced under heavy fire and entered a small ravine close to their works, but could not get farther. The line there remains more or less covered.

T. LYMAN.

FIFTH CORPS, June 18, 1864-4 p.m.

Major-General MEADE:

The center of my line (the only part I could see) got well under way at 3.15 p.m. It received a very heavy fire, and after carrying one ridge had to halt there. I have received no report from any part of the line. I will try and strengthen the lines up in the new position and advance again as soon as I do. We met a heavy fire, and have suffered considerably from it. The railroad cut is a great obstacle.

Respectfully,G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.

HEADQUARTERS FIFTH CORPS, June 18, 1864-4.55 p.m.

Major-General MEADE:

Crawford continues pressing with quite sharp musketry. General Warren will try to push the assault over the works along the whole line, if there is any chance.

T. LYMAN.

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, June 18, 1864-6.30 p.m.

Major-General WARREN:

Birney has made a strong attack and been repulsed. Exercise your judgment as to further operations. The enemy, I fear, have been

re-enforced, and now that Birney is quiet may be able to offer strong resistance to your efforts. When you conclude that nothing further is practicable straighten your lines and make your connections secure. I am quite satisfied we have done all that it is possible for men to do, and must be resigned to the result.

GEO. G. MEADE.

(Same to General Burnside.)
