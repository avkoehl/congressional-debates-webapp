tion to their regiments now with Bragg. I respectfully ask to follow Maxey at once with the Kentuckians. General Jones propose to retain the Tennesseeans, but under the authority he claims he might call for the Kentuckians to-morrow.

JOHN C. BRECKINRIDGE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OD EAST TENNESSEE,Knoxville, Tenn., October 11, 1862.

Brigadier General N. B. FORREST,

Murfreesborough, Tenn.:

My command has been extended for the present over the country between the Tennessee and Cumberland Rivers. I can send you two more regiments in a day or so. Hold Murfreesborough if possible until I can re-enforce you. What is the condition of things in your front now? Answer to-day.

SAM. JONES,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF EAST TENNESSEE,Knoxville, Tenn., October 11, 1862.

Brigadier-General FORREST,

Murfreesborough, Tenn.:

I ordered Dure's battery and one from Montgomery's battalion to report to you. Ascertain from Colonel McKinstry where they are. Will send you two or three officers to aid in organizing troops. Have no arms for cavalry to send you. If yours orders from General Bragg are not positive to organize cavalry regiments, do not organize any more until the infantry organized. The undisciplined cavalry without arms is more than useless. I cannot leave here at present. Additional infantry be sent to you as soon as possible.

SAM. JONES,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF EAST TENNESSEE,Knoxville, Tenn., October 11, 1862.

Colonel J. GORGAS,

Chief of Ordnance, C. S. Army, Richmond, Va.:

In your telegram of the 16th ultimo to me you say the arms from Gainesville, Ala., had been ordered to me some days previously; that those from Columbus follow, and that General Price would direct every arm on hand to Knoxville. Have you given any counter orders in regard to them? If not, please ascertain why they have not been sent to me, and order them here without delay. There is great demand for arms in this department to arm exchanged prisoners and convalescents returning to their regiments in Kentucky.

Very respectfully, &amp;c.,

SAM. JONES,

Major-General.
