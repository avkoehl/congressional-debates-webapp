Captain J. H. ODLIN,Assistant Adjutant-General, Cairo, Ill.:

CAPTAIN: From information this day received from refugees, I learn that Faulkner, with 800 men, is intrenching Union City. Forrest is reported to be concentrating at Murray, from which placew he will try to cross the Tennessee. The rumor is that he has been driven back by our forces, and found this the only means of escape.

There are small bands all sides of us. They have been in Clinton, Milburn, Blandville, and Hickman, in squads of 20 to 40 men, conscripting all and taking everything in the shape of a horse. I will have a scout with a full report in a day or two.

I am, sir, respectfully, your obedient servant,
