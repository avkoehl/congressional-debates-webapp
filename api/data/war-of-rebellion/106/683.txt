EXECUTIVE OFFICE, IDAHO TERRITORY,

Lewiston, November 23, 1863.

Major S. TRUAX,

Commanding, Lapwai:

SIR: From the inclosed statement there is reason to apprehend difficulty between the Indians and whites on Snake River, which may result seriously. I have instructed the agent of the Nez Perces to go to that neighborhood and investiage the facts. I have to request that you send with him a force of ten or fifteen mounted men.

Yours, respectfully,

W. H. WALLACE,

Governor of Idaho Territory.

[Inclosure.] LEWISTON, November23, 1863.

His Excellency W. H. WALLACE,

Governor of Idaho Territory:

Your petitioners would respectfully show that on the 21st day of November, 1863, while in pursuit of their daily labor as miners, on the bank of Snake River, they were threatened by the Indians to take their lives and every indication showed that they intended to take the lives of the miners on that river. On that we were compelled to abandon our claims for fear they would execute their threats.
