Brigadier-General BROWN, U. S. Army,

Commanding at Springfield, Mo.

GENERAL: I have learned from reliable sources that my surgeons left with my wounded at Springfield, Mo., have been arrested, taken from the care of the wounded and sent as prisoners to Saint Louis or elsewhere. It is difficult to believe that conduct so contrary to the usages of war--so cruel to the unfortunate wounded--indeed inhuman, can be countenanced by the U. S. authorities. I write to demand the release of these officers and their return to the duty assigned them by me. I beg also to call your attention to the fact that many of my wounded at Springfield, Mo., have been paroled contrary to the express understanding and agreement between General Hindman, C. S. Army, and General Blunt, U. S. Army, commanding Army of the Frontier. This agreement has been faithfully and fully carried out by General Hindman and all officers serving under him. A like faithful execution of the agreement is expected of all U. S. officers. Again, I learn that Captain Frazier, of MacDonald's Missouri Cavalry Regiment, left wounded and in charge of my surgeons at Springfield, Mo., has been confined in a miserable dungeon and is to be tried for his life. Can this be possible? I do assured you that I hope this is false, but if true I do most solemnly pledge you that I will retaliate tenfold, seeing it is the only remedy for the wrongs done my men. I regret the necessity made by you of writing this letter but the rights and lives of those under my command demand it.

Very respectfully,

J. S. MARMADUKE,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
