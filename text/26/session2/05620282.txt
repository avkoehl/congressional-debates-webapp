there be a reasonable hope of compelling to ei,<n
nations,   by means of   counttrv-ulwg   duii-i, to
adopt a more liberal policy, I am for ir« ¡i % tt e ex-
periment.    According to my opimou, it & the du y
of the Government   to t ister and  protect every
branch of mdustrj, commercial, manufactuing,
or agricultural, where it can be  done by  wist   le
gislanon, taught by oui own experience and t1 at ot
other nations    It is not  b cause the&outh is  ihe
South, that it disdains  protection, Loui  ana, to
instance, has always  been a tariff brat>, on  ae
count ot the pro'ection tc  her s-ugars     1 contend
that even the article of cotton is indirectly   pro
tec ed by the indirect advantages it derives iiom
the extension of the maii-et here and elsewhere
We have heard much of late yeais of the theory
of free trade, whieti ro nation piacti^es, as it exi ts
between the different State-- ot t is Uní r it is
the doctrine of the Swiss school of abstract p li ical
economists, and it is the fashionabl  doc line Fo
reign nations are continually preaching it to each
other, but none set tne example, on the contrary,
their practice is directly opposite England is uil
ling to open her ports, where the ft reign article
cannot compete with the same, article proe'aced
there, where even the cost of transportation is a
protection, together with the excise levied on her
own manufacture, from which tne foreign article
would not be exempted She does this with twenty
percent higher wages than ihe manufacturers en
the continent, by means of her immense capital,
the superior skill and .nte'lige-nce of her workme i,
and that superior skill u the offspring of hbei ty In
the latter respect we have the advantage over Bu-
tam, and can compete with her with higher wage*,
and but for her great advantage m respect of capi-
tal, we could go ahead of her Ihe smaller the ca-
pital, the larger must tfe the profit, as we s e f om
the huckster with a hundred per e?nt to the whole
sale dealer who is content with five or ten It is
this vast capital which makes ihe power of Britun,
and from which protection is necessary on our part,
as much for the sake of ihe counliy as of ihe ma-
nufacturers Lord Brougham declared in the
House of Commons that it was the policy oí Eng-
land to break down our manufactures at any sacri-
fice, in order, as he was pleased to say, to preserve
the natural comse of things, that is, to k„ep us de-
pendent on England, which, ¡o my mind, is a very
unnatural course of things Switzerland, which is
cited as an example for us, is in a situation entirely
different Her superior intelligence and skill rer-
der the surrounding nations tnteutary to hei, not-
withstanding the poverty ot her soil, and the bleak-
ness of her mountains All her people are engaged
m manufactures, more or less, as they are m our
New England States Instead of attempting to
tariff out the productions of France, Germany,
Austria, and Sardinia, it is the policy of those States
to tariff m those of Ssilzerland A Swiss statisti-
cal writer* thus expresses himself, and complains of
the hard fate of his country, because the surround-
ing nations are unwilling to be overrun with their
watches, ribands, toys, and a thousand articles,
which throw the balance on the side of Switzer-
land: "The prohibitive systems, adopted by a great
number of the neighboring Power-., injure and in-
terfere with her essentially."   This, no doubt, is

than that of th* common labore", the merchant, the
profe sional man, better than the mechanic Tms
is the reason why the mere products ef the soil,
where n^ extraordinary skill is required, are more
poorlv paid, in propoition to the labor bes owed,
than any other We may rely upon it, that that
nition whi"h combines the highe t degree of mnd
in her operations will hold others dependent upon
it, and it we desire to lessen our dependence on
England or Fnnee, we can only to do by keeping
pace with them in the march of mind
When gentlemen declaim so earnestly against
the protectve leaislation of the United States they
seem to forget with whom it originated Permit
me to take a short review of 'fa history From
the time of the passage of the first act of Congress
for revenue and protec ion, so expressed in its title,
unt 1 the administration of Mr. Jefferson, our
manufactures had made considerable progress,
compared to the state of things before that time
A variety ot manu actures had been firmly esta-
blished, still they fell far below the wants of the
country Our enterprise was chiefly directed to
foreign commerce, and especially the carrying
trade, which would cease with the return of peace
But when the rival nations vied with each other in
spoliations on our commerce, we began to look out
for safe employment for our capital accumulated
in trade. The non-mtercourse, embargo, and war,
taught us to see our weakness, and depen-
dence on forcgn countries for the most ne-
cessary and common articles of manufacture
Necessity compelled Us to establish manufac
ture^, and capital was invested in them which
could find no other employment Acd, per
mit me to ask, in whose hands was the Govern-
ment at this time? In the liando of Southern
statesmen, who carried their measures by the votes
of the Western and Middle States. They were
the authors of the war, it was their policy which
drove the Northern people to manufactures At
the close of the war, it was found that an astonish-
ing progress had been made in manufactures, and
that a large amount, withdrawn from trade, had
been invested in tbem These establishments were
in their infancy, however, and unable to stand the
sheck of an attack upon them by the powerful
British establishments, backed by the British Go-
vernment The Southern statesmen, under Mr
Madison'-  administration, stood up in their defence
it was their policy which had called them into be-
ing, it would have bien crael to abandon their own
offspring. The tariff of 181<3 was the result, and
it was so regulated as to afford incidental protection
as well as revenue. I cannot erase from my mind
the lessons of wisdom I received in listening to the
speeches of Mr Clay, of Mr Lowndes, and of Mr.
Calhoun, when engagsd, as it were, in settling the
future policy of the nation on what was after-

Mr Chairman, the ruinous condition of the
country is no longei denied by any Gne. But we
are to d by the friends ot lhi„ Administration that
it will be for those con ing in to remedy these evils
They *ay they have promised to do so, and wo be
to them if they do not keep their promise1 Sir,
the brand of an idiot boy may destroy in an hour
trie edifice which called forth the labor of thou
sands, and required half a century to rear. Gene-
ral Harrison and his Cab net will do all they can,
but they cannot work miracles * But it is for the
people themselves, through their representatives, to
apply ihe best remedy the case will almit It will
be the work of t.me, and we know not half its
difficulty, but, in the language of the Roman patriot,
l"t us never despair of the Republic
When gentlemen speak of high duties, high ta-
riff, and refer to the tatiff of 1828,1 must remind
them that even that was the work tf the South
The high duties we>e unreduced by its enemies, m
order to defeat the bill It was not satisfactory to
any party it wa* a compound made up both by
friends and foes I must remind those with whom
the name of General Jackson still retains some
share of popularity, that he was in favor of a pro-
tective tariff He so expressed himself previous to
his election, he afterwards spoke of a "judicious
tariff," with reference to this subject, and, in one
of his Messages, he expressed the opinion that we
ought to encourage the manufactures of those arti-
cles which would render us independent in time of
war And how shall we determine what those ar-
ticles are? He could not mean merely the manu-
facture of gunpowder' Perhaps, without intend-
ing it, the passage covers the whole ground of pro-
tective duties
We must go back to the days of Jame> Madi-
son, and endeavor to follow in the fooistcps of the
great Democratic statesmen of that period, who set
