Instructions from General Johnston to join him near Canton as soon as possible, and that he had decided to move at once, in pursuance thereto, toward Brownsville, on the north of the railroad, by the route as far as the railroad by which we had advanced the previous night. He directed me to move the trains as rapidly as possible to a point at least 3 miles beyond the Jackson road, and there halt them, arranged to the right and left of the road in such a manner as would afford an uninterrupted passage to the infantry and artillery. I immediately caused the trains to be turned, and in charge of my Fourth Brigade (Colonel [A. W.] Reynolds), to be moved rapidly to the rear, in accordance with the instructions I had received. Colonel Reynolds was directed to place one regiment in front of the train, and to form the remainder of his brigade in line of battle, covering the Clinton and Raymond roads, there to remain until relieved by the next brigade in his rear. It was intended to hold these roads bu the brigades as they successively arrived until the passage of the entire army could be effected. The success of this movement depending mainly on the speedy relief of the road from the obstruction caused bu the presence of the train, I dispatched two of my staff officers (Major [Howell] Webb and [J. W.] Anderson) to superintend the operations of those in charge of the train. About 9. 30 a. m. the latter reported that the road was open, the trains having been placed as ordered, and free for the passage of the troops. This fact I immediately communicated to the lieutenant-general commanding.

About 9 a. m., lee relieved Reynolds on the Raymond and Clinton roads, and in a very short time his skirmishers were engaged by those of the enemy. A brisk skirmish of about three-quarters of an hour developed our position to the enemy, who at once changed his direction by the right flank, with the view of turning our left. My three brigades (the fourth, colones Reynolds, having moved off with the train) were immediately drawn up in order of battle, Barton on the right, Cumming in the center, and Lee on the left, as previously stated. The line of the march was a cross road from the Clinton to the Raymond road, intersecting the former nearly at right angles (see diagram*). It was at this fork that my left rested. The enemy, in columns of DIVISION, moved steadily around our left flank. Of this fact I informed the lieutenant-general commanding, and from time to time every apparent increase of force or additional movements by the enemy was promptly reported. Finding that they were about to concentrate on the left with the larger part of their force, still moving a column to the flank, as I had no reserve, I moved General Barton (my right brigade) by the rear to the extreme left. At the time this order was informed that the enemy had massed a large force on the left, which would doubtless be the main point of attack. My line had now been moved to the left, until two regiments of the center, now the right (the FIFTY-sixth Georgia, colonel [E. P.] Watkins, and the FIFTY -seventh Georgia, colonel {William] Barkuloo), occupied the Raymond and Clinton roads, with an interval of 300 yards between them and the remainder of their brigades. This separation was necessary to protect the right and rear of the new line, now threatened by these roads. This new line, upon which the attack was made, was formed as follows: The right rested at the angle of the original line, composed of three regiments (the Thirty-sixth Georgia, colonel [Jesse A.]
