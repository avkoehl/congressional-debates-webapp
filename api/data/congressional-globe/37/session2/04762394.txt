jurors' oaths.
Mr. HARRIS. The Committee on the Judi-
ciary, to whom was referred the bill (S. No. 281)
prescribing an additional oath to be taken by grand
, and petit jurors serving in the United States
courts, have had the same under consideration,
and report it back with a recommendation that it
do not pass.
The VICE PRESIDENT. Reports are not
yet in order; but the Senator's report will be re-
ceived, if there be no objection. The Chair hears
no objection.
Mr. DAVIS subsequently said: The Senator
from New York made a report from the Commit-
tee on the Judiciary out of time; I did not under-
stand that the report was then received, or that
the motion to receive it was entertained, else I
would have objected to its reception out of order.
I want that report to be considei*cd as not pre-
sented, to be yet in the hands of the committee,
because 1 want the strange recommendation of the
committee reversed when the report is made. I
object to its being received in this informal man-
ner.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The objection of
the Senator is entirely too late. The Chair stated
expressly that he would receive it if it was not
objected to, and no objection was made; and that
was half an hour ago.
Mr. DAVIS. I did not hear the words of the
Chair.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Chair so
stated.
Mr. DAVIS. "Well, I move to reconsider.
The VICE PRESIDENT. By unanimous con-
sent the report may bo regarded as not having
been made.
Mr. GRIMES and others. Let it go on the
Calendar.
Mr. HARRIS. I hope the report will be con-
sidered as having been made and as lying on the
table, and the Senator from Kentucky can call it
up at any time.
Mr. DAVIS. I move to reconsider the vote by
which it was received. I want to call it up as
summarily as possible.
The VICE PRESIDENT. In the opinion of
the Chair, there can be no motion to reconsider.
The Senator from New York rose in his place
and made a report. That brings it before the
i Senate. It is now before the Senate; and the Sen-
ator can move to recommit it.
Mr. DAVIS. Well, I can move to take it up
at any time ?
The VICE PRESIDENT Yes, sir.
Mr. DAVIS. I shall move to take it up at the
first opportunity.
PETITIONS AND MEMORIALS.
Mr. HARRIS presented a petition of citizens
of the city of New York, and two petitions of cit-

were referred to the Committee on the Judiciary.
Mr. SUMNER presented a petition of citizens
of New Haven, Connecticut, praying for the total
abolition of slavery throughoutthe country; which

He also presented two petitions of women of
Ohio, stating that they believe " the cause of hu-
manity and virtue will be advanced, and future
difficulties in the national Government effectually
prevented, by the extinction of slavery through-
out our country," and praying that Congress
" will at an early day adopt such measures as
