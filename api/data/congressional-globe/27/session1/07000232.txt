is presented by the !>( ntteman Irnti New York,
that being his (Mr A'-) i/iun purpose io address-
ing the committee What were those estimates?
The gentleman gave it astatementot the expense 
ot the last four \e->is, as follow-:
Expenses rf 1837     -             -            - $31,610,000
1838      -             -            -    31544,000
1839      -             -            -   25 443 000
1840      -             -            -    23,389,000
He tren  t< o   the average for the<e (our ji ar-,
equal to $27 697,000 annually, and 't eined • > rtlv
upon it as the ! asís ot lis estimated the annual
expen-es ol the current f ur yiars     K this was
¡ot th- scalt (f i xpenditure moused, Mr A.
asked, what was tha' -ode? M¿ hid heard no
otht t il'uded lo by the gentleman from New York,
who, throughout his -p e h, ha i see-n-d to place
his calculations on that grou- d, an continually re-
t rred to a deficit of etgh'een milliors annually,
which would take place under the operation of ex
■stm- laws It is just to admit that he did express
a hopi that "ome Kd icn in might be made in some
branches of expenditure; an1 tha' the comtni'tee,
under the lead of the gentl"man from Virginia,
[Mi. Gilmer,] would discover " some useless
<IJtceis," whine seivices might be dispensed with
But Mr. A would submit to the committee wh -
ther this hope was not very faintly expressed, and
whetrer the train of remarks entrrei jpon by the
gentleman in lelation to the subject was not such
a would g i far to justify an oppo-ue coi elusion.
Por he asserted, that, although the Florida war
sit uld hebtongbttoa clo-e,its effects vould last for
a 1< ng time, m the shape of claims of vonoiis kinds,
which we uld impose he?v« burdens on the Treasury;
hj alluded to the claims of Georgia, Alabama,
and Lomsipna on the Genera! Government, and
asstrtei distinctly ihat " rcreas d expenditures,"
growing out of pavatt el ims m gentrai, were to
be expected, assuming (what Mr A denied) that
private claimants had been, in effect, for years
past, turned iwpy from our doo" Tho=e who
have any experience heie are aware of ihe vast
number of unfounded and fraudulent claims wh>ch
n presumed to Congiess It is true that the do-
minant party, unde he last Administration, con-
s dered it their dut> to sirutin.ze all claims with
t <e utmost care and caution, and thus to guard
p'operly the money of the nation; and he (Mr A )
oped this policy would still con.mue, and that the
tloors ol the Treasury were not to be d rown open,
c id all who sought to thrust in their hands permit-
ted to do it. Nor did he think we had, from the
history of the past, every good guarantee that
many useless officers would be dispensed with.
Inihe repor' of the late Secretaiy of the Treasury
in 1840 is the following passage:
"Tilts occasion is taken also to renew the recommendations,
beforepresenledby this department, to Congress and iheap
propnate committees, for the discontmuanceofcertainoificers
now employed m the collection of dunes, whose further servi-
ces, it has been beiieved, could be safely dispensed with, m
consequence of the leduction in business at the different places
where they are stationed They include some collectors and
naval officeis, and seveial surveyor —amounting, in all, to
eighteen, but ííhose offices cannot be abolished without new te
gislation "
I' will be remembered that the committees of the
last Congress on the public expenditures, and the
expenditures of the several deyartments,were strong-
ly organized with majorities of the then opposition
paity. These recomm/rdalions oí the Secrefary
were repeated by him, and the particular officers
pointed out, in enswer to a resolution offered by a
gentleman from Massachusetts, not now a mem-
ber of the House. Yet, during the whole of the
last Congress, Mr. A. was not aware that any
of these eotnr ít'ee-, the scope of whoie duties
particularly embraced ihis subject, had brought
any proposition before the House to effect so de-
sirable an object.
Now, the genllennan from New York tells Us it
is 'imptssible to calculate" what rejrenchments
mav be made, o^ wheie .ie> can be effected; and
that "there has been no time ioi in ves igattct" m
the 'ma ter What' Have you yet to 'investi-
gate," morder to ci covei whether any and what
retr nchmen'b can be mide? When you
solemnlv promised the people retrenchment did
you not know whether any vas practica-
ble' Did you exclaim so loudly about ex-
travagance, and weie you not sati-fitd that any ex-
isted' These, Mr A. ihought, were questions pro-
per to be asked, a id to which the country would
'ook for an answer
Mr A protested against the propriety of taking
an average of tt e etpendi'uie  of the last foar
ytarsaslhe -cfle of yearly exnenditures for the
torn current ye^r- While the gentleman fiom
New Yoik as-ert- that the la'e Admit istration had
thpadvantag of $31 000 000 aoove th- current
revenue, and tnti the pres nt Administrad n will
nave no such lesouree, let him recollect the heavy
appropriit ons ih'own ut  n the late Admmi tra-
t on, and the reasons oí those appropriations, the
Krg<i S..U1S paid for the temoval ot Indians, and
Indian treaties—the Cherokee treaty alone involv-
ing an expense of over $6,000,000 Let him alss
recollect that, in 1836, the appropriations were
$19,000,000, and in 1837 $17 000,000 mure than
me estimates by the Exeeu'ive Departments;—in
the two years, $36 000 000 The e large expendi-
tures of the years 1837 and 1838 were caused by cir
cumstances which would occur to the mmd of
evervone. They were y ars following a time of"
unexampled expansion m business, and of mon-
s rous importation0, producing a bloated reve-
nu-, and a gorged and plethoric Treasury; when
the question, was, not how little, but how much
could be expended, and wnen many,who otherwise
would have been for no overaction on the part of the
Genetal Government,were, in a measuie,seekmgob•
jtcts of appropriation, in order lo prevent the adop-
tion of unconstiiutional and dangerous schemes ot
distribution of the publtcinoney:—thus proving the
pisitun to which he the other day advened —that
an overflowing revenue must always be adverse
to economy No fair argument tor fixing on an
annual scale of expenditures for ths four current
\ears can be drawn from th3 yearó 1837 and
1838.
Mr. A. said he proposed now to examine into
the course of the late Administration, m relation
to expenditures, as shown by the data furnished by
the present Secretary of the Treasury, and recog-
nised as correct by the cha>rman of the Committee
r f Ways and Means In doing this, it is well to
bear m mind the fact, that the appropriations for
the year 1837 were made at the session of Con-
Fie3s m the winter of 1836 '7, and of course pre-
vious to the 4th of March, the commencement of
Mr Van Bu-en's administration; that the appro-
priating for 1838 were made at the session com-
