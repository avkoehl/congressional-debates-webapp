rigging of this Administration; and if I fail, sur-
rounded as I am with rich and ample materials,
it must be for the want of ability on my part to
perform the task I design, also, to pay a passing
notice to the speech of the gentleman from North
Carolina, [Mr Bvnüm ] I will not attempt to
follow him through his winding, desultory argu-
ment You are perfectly aware of the fact, Mr
Chairman, that some speeches are put together
in such a manner, that if you attempt to analyze
them, in order to find their point, so as to enable
you to answer them, you are most woefully de-
ceived. Fearing that I might meet with that
difficulty in this instance, I shall only notice a
few select expressions of that gentleman.
I concur most heartily with him, " that there
is a party in this House attempting to to blacken
and pie-ball another great party." If I was
called upon for my proof, I should avail myself
of the various speeches I have heard delivered
by that gentleman since I have had the honor of
a seat upon this floor, and especially his revised
and enlarged edition of the day before yester-
day's date I also most heartily agree with the
gentleman that, so far as mere promises are con-
cerned, the Administration party occupy high
ground as Democrats; but when you attempt to
apply the test of acts to their claims, you will
find a "beggarly account of empty boxes"
Modern Democracy has been brought down to
such a nice point that you may confine it in a
nutshell, (if I may be permitted to use a favorite
expression of the gentleman from Georgia, Mr
Hatnes ) All its doctrines and all their bear-
ings are embraced in one short paragraph- " He
who knows his master's will and does not obey
it, shall receive thirty-nine stripes " As I do not
wish to deal in round assertion, I will endeavor
to prove the truth of what 1 have said Look, if
you please, at the situation of the Senator from
Virginia, [Mr Rives ] We all know that only
a short time since he was hugged to the bosom
of this Administration with fond delight, but now
how altered the easel Has he changed his polit-
ical opinions? No, sir, he entertains the same
opinions now upon the great questions of credit
and currency that ho di<l when he was so fondly
petted by the party, and what is more, they were
once the opinions of the Administration them-
selves, but now a "change has come over the
spirit of their dream "—they have changed, but
he adheres to his former position He has not
wheeled to the right-about at the bidding of the
President, and for this he is hunted down and
pioscribed by the Administration organ and its
kindred prints, with a fiend-like malignity of
purpose worthy only of the regions of the
damned
I have said that this Administration occupies
high ground as Democrats, so farasmere promises
are concerned I will now try and prove the asser-
tion , and as the gentleman from North Carolina
seems not to be fond of light reading, I will, in
imitation of his example, deal in facts "Who is
there, Mr Chairman, that docs not recollect that
the year 1828 was particularly distinguished in
the political annals of our country as the year
of promise ' It was then that the party now in
power came in sight of the holy land, it was then
that they pledged themselves to the Ameilcan
people that if they would permit them to enter
this land flowing with milk and honey, they
would usher in a glorious millennium, that the
cry and watchword of the Administration should
be, " Reform ' Reform ' Reform'" In short, that
a pure fountain of water should gush through the
Augean stable, purify and cleanse all that was
corrupt in the executive branch of the Govern-
ment. "Who is there that does not also recollect
that the year 1838 was particularly distinguished
by the organization of two celebrated i cform com-
mittees, the one in this House composed of a ma-
jority of Opposition members to the then Adminis-
tration, with General James Hamilton, of South
Carolina, as its chairman, while the committee of
the Senate had for its chairman the Senator from
Missouri, Thomas H Benton  The Executive
Departments were thrown open to their scrutiny.
No special pleas were urged, no specifications
were demanded, nor was this attempt at in ves- I
tigation pronounced to be " worse than a Span-
ish inquisition."   No, sir, special pleas, specifi- I

cations, and denunciations, were reserved for the
age of reform and Democracy
The House committee, after a thorough inves-
tigation , made an elaborate report, and gave it as
their deliberate opinion that there was corruption
and extravagance in the management of the dif-
ferent Departments, and declared that the only
reason why the committee were unable to propose
a remedy for the correction of the abuse was,
that it could alone be remedied by a hearty con-
currence on the part of the Executive and the
heads of Departments, clearly permitting the in-
ference to be drawn that the President and Sec-
retaries of the Departments were opposed to an
economical administration of the Government I
have taken the trouble to make out an account
current for the years 1828 and 1837, nine years
after the reformers had had full and peaceable
possession. The account I have made out is
taken from the book of receipts and expenditures,
annually published and laid upon each member's
table; and I find that the whole expense of the
different Departments, including every item of
expense, amounted, in 1828, to $481,748 I also
find that the expense of the same Departments,
for the year 1837, amounted to $958,523, leaving
a balance due against the reform Administration
of #476,775 This, sir, is a reform with a ven-
geance The House committee, also, after sift-
ing with great care the State Department,reported
to the House and the world the astonishing fact
that, comparing the last three years of Mr Mon-
roe's administration and the first three yeais of
Mr Adams's administration, $60,000 more had
been expended for the State Depaitment under
Mr Adams than there had been under Mr Mon-
roe This was enough The trump of alarm
was sounded, and the cry of " corruption" and
" extravagance" rang through the land, in all its
modes ana variations I have also made out an
account current as to that particular Department
for the years 1827 and 1837 During the year
1827, the entire expense of that Department was
$287,463, for the year 1837, it was $631,997,
which exhibits a balance against the refoimers
of $344,534 I wish it to be particularly lemem-
bered that the usual defence relied upon by the
party, to wit, that the extravagance is chargeable
to the votes of the Opposition, will not apply to
the examples that I have chosen in order to ex
pose and contrast the promises with the acts of
this Administration, not one dollar was appro-
priated by Congiess but what was asked for and
demanded by the officers of the different Depart-
ments
Mr Chairman, I do not wish the committee
should misunderstand me I have not stated, nor
will I do so, that there was extravagance and cor-
ruption in the management of the Departments
for the year 1837 I have not the materials be-
fore me to enable me to arrive at any such con-
clusions; nor am I sufficiently acquainted with the
routine of business to decide that question I am
inclined to the opinion, though, that, with proper
management, the business of the Departments
could be as well done as it is with less expense
But I shall take warning by the rock on which
the reform committees of 1828 split, and not make
chaiges that I do not know to be tiue. It is evi-
dent, fiom the facts now adduced, either that
those reform committees of 1828 made the charge
of extravagance and corruption on very slight
evidence of their existence, or that they willfully
slandered those in power, or that, since they have
come into powei, they have forgotten their pledges
of retrenchment, and acted more corruptly and
extravagantly than those whom they denounced.
One of the three things is inevitable I have been
particular in selecting such examples, that there
should be no dispute about where and on whom
the responsibility attached, for I had no wish to
go into a general discussion upon the question of
the expenses of the Government, my only object
was to show that profession was one thing and
performance another, and I think I have done
that satisfactorily and unanswerably.
Mr Chairman, the principal object I had in
view in addiessing the committee, was to prove
that there is more danger to be apprehended to
the liberties of my country from Executive power
and influence in this House, than from "theanti
I  republican tendencies of associated wealth "    If
Ho. of Reps.
you will only take a calm and dispassionate view
of all the circumstances that have given birth to
the thrice recommended and thrice-iejected sub-
Treasury bill, you will be bound to view it as art
illegitimate bantling of a party, who, after having
run roughshod over the best paper currency the
world ever saw, are nowseekingan "inglorious"
retreat, by denying that they have the power con-
stitutionally to do that which they have been doing
in the open face of day, and boasting of their
" better-currency "deeds for the last seven years
For my own part, sir, whenever I permit myself
to take that view of the subject, I feel armed and
fortified in the position I have assumed, that there
is more danger from the Executive branch of this
Government than there is to be apprehended
fi om the anti-republican tendencies of associated
wealth
What are the particular circumstances that
have led to the introduction of this ill-shaped Ex-
ecutive measure' Ten years ago it was the will
of the American people to elevate to the presiden-
tial chair General Andrew Jackson, a distin-
guished military officer When he entered upon
the duties of his station, his country was m a
prosperous and happy condition She was blessed
with a cuculating medium that passed at par witli
gold and silver in every part and portion of this
extensive Republic; nay, in China itself We
were also blessed with a cheap foipign and do-
mestic exchange Add, if you -please, the fact
that the people had just ejected an 4.dimmstra-
tion for its alleged extravagances Although the
annual expenses of the Government, ordinary
and extraoidinary, only amounted to the average
sum of $12,500,000, still the charge went forth,
and was believed, and, unfortunately for my
country, it was also believed that there was an
attempt on the part of the President to wield the
patronage of his office for other purposes than a
pure administration of the Government The in-
dignation of the country was aroused; the people
were anxious to lessen the patronage of the Pres-
ident by the passage of restrictive laws, and «
return to the good old days of economy Soap-
parent was this sentiment, that the Piesident
elect, in his inaugural addiess, felt bound to in-
dulge in the following emphatic language:
" 1 lie recent demonstntion of public sentiment inscribes
on tlic list of Executive duties, in characters too legible to
be overlooked, the tisk of reform which will require pir
ticuhrly the correction of those abuser that have brouglu
the patronage of iheredenl Government into conflict will 
the freedom of elections, and the counteraction of those
ciuses which have disturbed the rightful colarse of appoint
ment, and have placed or continued power m untaitirful or
incompetent bands "
During my proposed lemarks, I shall be ena-
bled to prove as plain as the noonday's sun, that
every principle embraced in the extract I have
read was totally disregarded by the party, and the
acknowledged wish of the people trampled under
foot President Jackson, in his fiist message,
calls the attention of Congress and the country
to the condition of the cuirency, and declares that
it was admitted by all that the United States Bank
had failed in giving to the country a sound and a
uniform currency I shall not attribute to this
distinguished individual improper or unworthy
motives in the presentation of this question to the
people It is enough for my purpose simply to
state facts It is wholly immaterial, in arífer to
arrive at truth in the investigation of this subject,
whether you attribute to him improper motives,
or the most high and lofty patriotism, for men
who are in the possession of both honesty and
Eatnotism often err, and when the individual's
row is encircled with the halo of glory, it gives
currency and importance to the error, nay, sir, it
is a passport to errors of every kind and degree.
In a case of that kind we judge the man, and not
the measure You know, sir, full well, that Gen-
eral Jackson's popularity, power and influence
were such, only a few short years ago, that he
could wheel this House to the right or left with
the same ease that I can turn that door upon its
hinge It is not my wish to indulge in improper
or unbecoming language, and especially towaids
that distinguished individual, foi, however widely
I may have differed from him, and however con-
scious I may be that the measures of his admin-
istration were unfortunate for his country, still
his name is associated with his country's glory,
