APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
August, 1841.
27th Cong......1st Sess.
Fiscal Bank—Mr. Clay.
Senate.
Why all this haste? Can you not trust yourselves
for a few short months? or are you afraid of "the
sober second thought of the people1" If not, I
implore you to pause in your rapid march—to de-
,Jay action on these important measures for a sea-
son—four short months, until the annual session
of Congre s, in respect to our constituent , in
deference to the people—permit us to return home,
and congult them on these important mea-
sures, which you have now at last, and for the first
tune as a party, suggested and proposed to adopt
I profess to be no prophet, but if you persist in press-
ing thes  measures and thus hastily, unexpectedly,
and unadvisedly fasten thtm upon the people, it
must arouse popular indignation, and roll bark the
popular tide against you, and, perhaps, may result
m a popular insurrection, for a free people will not
suffer power to sport with their interests, or lo be
regardless ot their rights.
I know, sir, I am one of a small paity in this
hall, and have no claim on, or affinity with, the
present dominant majority But, in the nam*1 of
the people, I (eel authorized to make this demand
cm you, and if you still persist in pressing these
measures on a reluctant and unwilling people I
am sustained and cheered by the hope that Ibo Pre
sident will ihen interpose, arrest your progie s, and
stay thes- dangerous miasures Though I did
much—perhaps as much as any humble indivi-
dual—to prevent that dismguished man from com
ing into power, yet, for mysdf, and in justce to
those who acted with me, I must say that our op
position was not so much to the man nor his prin-
ciples, as our apprehension of ihe^e fatal mea
sures, and those with whom he was asoociatei!, ai d
while I would not have the temerity to expee that
he should make any s-ae* **<"* for us in jus
tice to his own fame, for his own dear b ate, „-
our common country, if my voice could reach
him, I would appeal to him to stand fast on
his past acknowledged position, on his time ho-
nored principles, to hold out the Constant on as
the cynosure of the Republic, to unroll the senil
en which s in cnbed Iih Vi'ginia pnncii/Ie*, as
the only guides that can conduct the vessel of state
amidst ihe storms and breakers that tnv ron i, to
disrobe himself of the mystery that ceems to linger
around him, to stand out as a Democrat and a
man, b Idly, firmly, and mdepindently, underhis
ancient State rights banner, and then the people
will hail him as a d°hv rer, rally around him as
embodying their ciu^e and impersonating their prm
ciple , and, reposing m ilieir ^.eneious conli tt nee,
he will ee hiswng lile of past public Mime lost
in ihe imperishpble glory (f -in A imimstiatii n
founded on Ihe ob ervan<e of tbe un reo s ard the

Then, sir, all ihe suggestions of elfi h an I design
ing politicians, and tbe repu ed cons^uafy against
his administra ion, will ippeir to the age as m to
spots in the sun—a bubbles on the surf.ee of the
great ocean But, let him lis  sight of these high

THE FISCAL BANK
DEB\TE IN THE eFNATE
Thursday, August 19   1841
Tie Chair having announc <1 t e  < r' r  of the
day—the Ft cal Bank bill, with Ihe me sace ot die
President, revising his ps«cnt therett —
Mr CLAY spo'-<e f r about an hour and i hilf
In the cour e of his remarks he allnd d to ti r ma
jonties by which the Bank nil ha I be<n passed in
both branches of Corgrec^ m th1 mnner in which
it had been sent back, and the requirements of
the Constitution that, being returned si hoot the
signature of the President, it shoutd receive the
sanction of two thirdsrfeach ííousl before] could
become a hw Th s majority, h - did not expect
In such observations as he shou' 1 make, he dis-
claimed any di,re pect for the Grief Magistrate,
but regreted to find that tbe 16th fundamental sec-
tion of the bil, which had been offered in a spirit
of conciliation and compromise, had been treated
with such harshness of language, in the message
now under consideration
He adverted to the da/ on which Mi.
Tyler arrived m Washington to take charge of
the office devolving on him by the death of Gen
Harrison, and depicted what must have been
his mingled emotions at finding himse f the Chief
Magistrate of the greatest nation on earth, deduc ng,
from the address he then put forth to th  people,
Whig principles, which could bear no other con-
struction but that he would sanction «uch a Bank
as had been submitted to him since for h s signa-
ture Mr Clay read several passages from this ad-
dress in support of this assumption, and mferrpdthat
according to the Presiden t's. reference to tne fathers of
th  Republic, he would do as tbey had < one, and be
asked, had not Washirgton, Madison, Monroe, and
Jeffer on, given their sanction to a Bank of the
United States' He denied that even Gen Jackson,
in his veto message, had made any issue on the power
of Congre s to establish a Bank lor the purposes of
Government On ihe contrary, be believed Gen
Jackson would have iccepted such a Bank as be
conceived adapted to the wants of tb/ Govern-
ment
When the friends of a National Bank found there
were scruples in the Presiden 's mind which could not
be got over, they framed a compromise section in a
spirit of kindneis and conciliation First, conces-
sion was asked of him, ( Vlr Ci ay,) by his friends,
as to the name Revolting as it was to him, he
vielded on thit point, thinking ibat "a rose by any
other name ^ould smell as sweet " The n-xt con-
cession to which he had to vield, was the location
m the city of Washington, and the consequent re-
strictions as to loans and discounts, and th-n the
third, the compromise clause, which it had been the
pleasure of tbe President to criticise in language so
harsh Mr CiAyaludedto all these concessions
au having been considered necessary to escape the
vet i, which, it seems, was not to be esciped by
any such concessi ns
Mr Clay quoted that part of the President's
message m which allusion is made to the difeience
of opinion expressed by Congress on various occi-
sión*., and by never ! preceding P'esidents
with regard to tap constitutional power of
Congress to establish a National Bank,
and denied that the posuio" thus assume1 was
historically true He went on to show that five
Conc;res es hid decided in fa vi r of the power, and
not oraa"jinu it That e/ery Pre írpnt of Ihe
United Sates who had been ci'led upi" to ict
on tbe qu sin n, had "iven it his sarTti<n, but
one tbepnsfnt Pre idem of the United Sites
Mr C esp essrd h s a tomshmeni thit ihe Pres
dent, in his attempt to leprcsent the questi n as so
muly balanced, that he could not lake upon him
lo decide, h d not al o quoted the luthinty if
aioih°r co ordnate branch of the- Government,
and in some re pects a panmount b-anc i—the ju
diciary—ind sho-7 w hat had been the decisions of
the Supreme Court He al*o sxp-e«ed his sur
prise t> at <h« President shrulo think it ne~es ai/ to
parade hi former t pinions m reUtien to the con-
stitutionally of a United States Bank, and iim-
gme theeopimors were known and sciuinized
during the Pre* denual canvass In this he was mis
t Ken an Ihe (¡Mr Clay) thought the Presu entgsve
hs opinions more weight thin they were entiUed
to H  wou d ver-ture to say that rineti -ine ( ut
of ever' bur clr d vote , \  tie eleefd him to the
Vic1 Presi 'encj n<n-r thought of 11 opinions on
the °nl j ct of a ria linal ,?ark being of ary con-
sequence ivit i retail to hi du íes m that i ffice,
and certamiy rever calculated on the death ol Ge-
neral Harrison, or tbe contingency of tr-e Prest
denual chair h ing filled by ihe piesent lrcnmbent
The elec ors who ¡laced him in ihe office of Vice
Presidtnt, did not „'ive themselves the foable of
inquiring what Ins opinions were
Mr Clay next «¡noted that partofth- messag 
m which it is a ', ' Entertaining the op ¡inns al-
luded to, and having taken this oath, ti e Senate
and the country will see that I could not give my
«auction to a measure of the character describ i,
without surrendering all  claim  to the respect of
honorable men—all confidence on 'he part of the
people—all self-respect—all regard for moral and
religious  obligations, without  an ob ervance  of
which no Government can be prosperous, and no
people can  oe happy     It would be to commit a
crime  which I would not wilfully commit to gam
any earthly reward, and which  would justly sub-
ject me to the ridicule andscornof all virtuous men  
In this passage it was evident, he (Mr   Clay)
thought, that ihe President looked rather too much
into his own heart, and tbe consequences to himself
of the course he should pursue, instead  of to the
opinions of those who had elevated him to the trust
reposed in him     In doing this, he had expressed
himself in language which Madison would not have
used, for that great man would never have gone
the length of declaring a Bank, for the purposes of
Government, unconstitutional   He imagined what
would have been Mr  Madison's course, could he
h¿ve been called from his grave, and placed in Mr.
Tyler's situation   He asked, did Mr Madison's as-
sent to the United Stites Bank bring down upon him
the scorn and contempt of all resectable men?
Other authorities as high as that of the pre'eut
President, and higher, had decided that Congress
has the power of establishing a Nat onal-Bank.
These decisions should have   had some weight,
the call of the country, "O  decidedly expiessed,
should have had some consideration,  the majority
of 131 in the popular branch of Congress and of
26 in the Senate,  should have had some weight, if
doubti were so nicely balanced before, these con-
siderations  should have  turned the  scale.    The
blessings which the eountry had enjoyed for forty
years under the operations ot  the United States
Bank  should have helped  to   make a decision.
But President Tyler seemed to  have treated the
subject as if the sole alternative presented to him
was either to sign the bill  or veto it    Was there
not another alternative—that of allowing the  ten
days to expire?     Were there  not two alterna-
tes?   Could he no have adopted the obvious one,
instead of allowing his imagination to exaggerate
the consequences to himself     What were indivi-
dual consequences to the conbequence operating; on
the whole country and the people?   But was there
not even another alternative?   If it was incompati-
ble  with the preservation of his conscience and
the promotion cf the general good of the country,
wa  there not a solution of the difficulty in the his-
tory of Mr Tyler himself? When he was instruct
ed by his Legislature on a cour-e he did not feel
in  his conscience he  could   adopt, he resigned.
II     had on   that cccrsion  but one S ate for his
ci i s ituency, when called upon to  decide on this
measure,  he   had   tbe wh le Union—twenty-six
S ates for his constituei C) , ard it he ifgarded his
his own conscientioa. scruples m  the first case, he
could have ac'cd upon the same ru'e in ihe last
Mr Clay con'ended that, if it could have bren
foreeeen at the Harrisburg nom nation, that Gen
Harrison would die in the first month of his n
cumbency, and that Mr Tyler would fill the effi-e
of Prrsident, and thit th s session of Congress
would pas" the Bark bil , which it has passed, and
that President Tjkr tould veto it, hewiuld not
havs received a solitary vote from tha Harnsburg
Convention
He alHided to the c&se of Governor McKean,
when a bill was pre en ted lo him for signature,
which he could not coa«c entic usly sign, he ex-
claimed, 'Allowmeto preserve ray conscience," and
he did so by allowing the ten da}s to expire Was
it to be said tha iha conscience or opinions of an
individual were lo be b-ought  nto compeu ion with
a question oí great national jmporance, called for
by three fourths f ihe people? Is the pre<ervah<m
of conscienti u ness ¿nd effice of more cine-
quence to any individual than the great interests of
a people in the es pllishment of a law < r laws ne
cessary for the prosperity of the country?
On reading the President's messfge, it no wappea'-
ed perfectly obvious to him, (Mr Clay ) that even
if h'Bank bill of the Secre i ary of the Treasury bad
been pass-j by Congres and sent to the President,
i' WOI.M not have met his approba icn,ac-ording to
hisiiVr C'b)under tandingo themessage Itappeai-
ei to him that President Tyler would not have signed
