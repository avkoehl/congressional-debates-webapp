Many officers besides those above named are distinguished by their commanders for gallant behavior. I have only space for the names of a few, whose acts of gallantry are specified. I was fortunate in this campaign in the assistance of three division commanders -Major Gens. Jubal A. Early, Edward Johnson, and Robert E. Rodes-whole wise counsel, skillful handing of their commands, and prompt obedience to orders are beyond praise-generals whose scare bear witness to the manner in which were won their laurels and rank. Colonel J. T. Brown, commanding artillery of this corps, showed himself competent to his position, and gave me perfect satisfaction. I have to express my thanks to the officers of my staff for their valuable services during the campaign:Major (now Lieutenant Colonel) A. A. Pendleton, chief of staff; Major G. Campbell Brown, assistant adjutant-general; Lieuts. T. T. Turner and James P. S with, aides-de-campt; Colonel A. Smead and Major B. H. Green, assistant inspectors-general; Surg. H. McGuire, medical director; Major J. A. Harman, chief quartermaster; W. J. Hawks, chief commissary of subsistence; William Allan, chief of ordnance; Capts. R. E. Wilbourn, chief of signals; H. B. Richardson, chief engineer, and Jed Hotchkiss, topographical engineer. Colonel J. E. Johnson, formerly on the Ninth Virginia Cavalry; Lieuts. Elliott Johnston, of General Garnett's staff, and R. W. B. Elliott, of General Lawton's staff, were with me as volunteer aides-de-camp. Colonel Pendleton's knowledge of his duties, experience, and activity relieved me of much hard work. I felt sure that the medical department, under Surg. H. McGuire, the quartermaster's under Major Harman, and the subsistence, under Major Hawks, would be as well conducted as experience, energy, and zeal would allow. The labor and responsibility of providing the subsistence of the whole army during its advance rested to a great measure on Major Hawks, and could not have been more successfully accomplished. Colonel J. E. Johnson, formerly of the Ninth Virginia Cavalry, was placed in charge of the picketers on the Shenandoah, covering my flank and rear during the attack on Winchester, and I rested securely in that respect, trusting to his experience, judgment, and coolness. Captain H. B. Richardson, chief engineer, was severely wounded at Gettysburg, and was left, I regret to say, in the enemy's hands-a loss I have very seriously left ever since that engagement. The efficiency and value of

Major Allan and Captain Wilbourn in their respective departments are well known. The reports of the division commanders accompany this report, as also those of the brigade commanders, and the chief of artillery. To these I beg leave to refer for greater detail in their respective operations than is practicable in the report of the corps commander. I have the pleasure to send you the accompanying maps of the campaign by Captain Jed Hotchkiss, topographical engineer, being the map of routes to and from Gettysburg, map of the battle-field of Winchester, and map of the battle -field of Gettysburg. *I have the honor remain &amp;c., R. S. EWELL, Lieutenant-General, Provisional Army, C. S. Army. Colonel R. H. CHILTON,

Assistant Adjutant and Inspector General.
