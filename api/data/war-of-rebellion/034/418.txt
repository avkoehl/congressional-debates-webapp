HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND.

Medical Director's Office, Tullahoma, Tenn., June 30, 1863.

SIR: In compliance with instructions to report the operations of the medical staff during the skirmishes of the 24th, 25th, and 26th instant, I would respectfully state that suitable preparations had been made to take care of a large number of wounded.

The sick that could be transported without injury were transferred from the general field hospital in Murfreesborough to Nashville. Such buildings in the town of Murfreesborough as were suitable were put in order for the reception of patients.

About two hundred and fifty hospital tents were carried with the command to accommodate such cases as could not be sent to the rear. Reserve supplies of medicines, hospital stores, dressings, &amp;c., were carried with each army corps.

In each division the organization of the medical department was complete, the medical officers being assigned appropriate duties.
