until he had seen it at ihe Clerk's table The remaiks he had
then made were reported m the "National Intelligencer," which
paper the gentleman fiom Massachusetts had before him, and
he (Mr J ) must be peimitted to say, that that gentleman
ought to be the last to leiei to him as being guilty of fraud or
falsehood, when he (Mr A ) had called him privately to his
demand had apolisised to him ior what he had then said
though he had not the magnanimity to do iton the flooi It
was a course of conduct unworthy uf the gentleman, who taus
himself committed a fraud
Mr ADAMS The disavowal is not complete Does tne
gentleman disavow any knowledge oí the aft<ur befon he
made that discoveiy a., the Clock's tabled I call upon him to
answer
Mi JOHNSON (.still most imperfectly heaid) was under
stood to say, that he had uio t distinctly made the disavowal
And no man with honoiable feeangs in his bosom would
make such imputations upon honorable members of this
House
Mr ADAMS Thegcntlemanfrom Mai y land isa good tac
tician I know him, and have known him long in that capa
cuy The gentleman at one time made a moot unj ustible u5e
of the Journals of this House and of my votes heie m Older
to support the gioundbhe then assin iu«.l I proved the fact
to the House and to that gentleman, yet he nevei nade an apo
Jpgy—
*• Mr JOHNSON hero made a lemark, which the Repor ei
could not heai, but thepuipoitot which was understood to
be that he halproved the gen'len an from Massachusetts to
be guilty oí erroi, and that the gentleman had never ackaow
ledgul it

Mt AIM Ms* then proceeded to lemaik that the gentleman
fiom Albemarle, [\lr Gilmlr] aftei mo t pei¡severingíy<.ud per

having spent several Iiou'ü in mat pleasant employment—had
thought pi iper to say—aftex lie (Mr A ) had do laiul that h
iiad presented the petition Irom wh tt he consideied the mjunc
lion of lus God—that he [Ui G ] was willing to withdraw his
resol u< ion, provided he (Mr A)wouId withdnw the petition
No no, he could not do that The gentleman knew it perfect
ly well, artd he must have supposed that he (Mi A > spoke to tat
wind, and not to this House, when he mide the deelaiation he
had done But that proposition cime to the point md issue ot
thiiswhole question—that was to sav, to the total suppres
uongw tne right of petition to the whole people of this Union
That was wait the gttulemaa now biought foiwaul, ail
he was not content with the variety of forma undu which

diculous to bt adopted by any sensible House of Rei \e enta

Mr GILMER Ido not, know what the gentlemen means by
a caucus but I-—
Mr ABaMS, (interrupting Mi G) The gentleman does
notknowwhatlmeanbya caucus' That is enough. [Laugh
ter ]
Mr GILMER said he did know what the gentleman mear'
byacaucus1 buthe wanted to know what the gentleman meant
when he spoke of a caucus, and he (Mi G ) would now, after
tne fashion of the Yankees, answer the gentleman's question^by
asking him another Had the gentleman himself held no con
vprsations and had there not been another caucus at which he
(Mr G ) was not present ?
The SPEAKER again interposed
Mi ADAMS said that as to any conversations orconsuUa
tions he might have had, that was a thing for which he was re
snon«ib!eto the House whenever called upon fiom a proper
qW GILMFR' So am I
Mr ADAMS The gentleman equivocates He dares not ac
knowledge that he was a party to that secret conclave beneath
this hall which followed immediately after his resohitmn I ^ay
he dares not acknowledge it, an 1 he is trying to evade it by put-
ting cpie^tionsfo me
Ml GILMER, who had li^en, took his seat lemarkmg (as
thf Repoiter thinks) tha' he would not íeply to *uch Ian
guace
Ml Al>AMS proceeded He took forgrantel that the gen
t!ü nan was fhpie, and he took it foi ¡rnntel that the proposition
of the gentleman fiom Kentucky [Mr Mapshali] was the re
suit of that caucus
But moie The gent'eman from Alb^mailp had sai 1 that he
biought forward thisresolutn n upon his own ground without
consultation, under a «en«e of the indignation \roused by the
presentation of the petition let, mirk the gertleman had,
before th?t time, notiñed this-Houst, that he was piepared to
dismiss him [Mi A ]aschanman of the Committee on Foreign
Relations, according to the piayei of'he petition from. Gt oisia
r! hegentieman had given notice of tint to others besides him,
(Mt At Ye« the gentleman had tarn pel ed with a colleague
oí his (M A '*) own, to put him m the station of chanmanof
the Committep on Foreign Affai s, in his (Mr A 's) place
Mr Gil ME R In as tospectful language as lean u<=e, I say
that the charge is without foundation ot shadow ot piobabili y
It is untine
The «SPEAKER aaim interponed
Mr GUSHING Mv colleague has mad*1 p-n accusation as
well against me as agnnbt the gentleman from Virginia, [Mi

Mr ADAMS I ha 1 the information fiom the gentleman

Mi   CUSlIINGrose
The--PrAKrR intimated lhaf it would not be in order foi

There wasade&ignto lemoveJum from his station asChaii-
man of the Committee on Foreign AfTans before he presented

ready been made in the Committee on Foreign Affairs No-
t ce had 1 een given by a member of thib House, and a member
of that committee of his readings to remove him iMr A ) be-

would notn e that fact He would read fiom the record of the

Mr PICKENS ro e to a point of order With entire re-
spect to the gentleman, from Massachusetts, he would inquire
wbethei it was proper foi the gent lei ian to detail what was
done m the Committee on Toreign Affair* It had always been
cons'dered outof order to tef i in the House to the proceedings
o. the committees
Mr GILMER, as a member of the Committee on Foieign
Affair*, hope 1 that the ci airman (Ml A ) would read the ac-
couuol the pioceedmss of that committee
Mr ADAMS said he would do so He was on his defence,
and this was a  very material part
The SPEAKER made some remarks in reference fo the
point of ordei, which H was impossible to hear at the
Reportei s desk, but was supposed to overrule tl e point of
