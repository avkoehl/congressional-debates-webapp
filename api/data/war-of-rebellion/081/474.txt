COLONEL: The general commanding corps desires me to say that he would like to have as many 8-inch siege mortars sent up immediately as you can send; also your heavy guns proposed to be sent.

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS TENTH CORPS, June 27, 1864.

Colonel SHAFFER, Chief of Staff:

The discrepancy between the reports from the different lookouts yesterday is explained this morning. The man at the water battery had a map with only one Cox on it, the Cox nearest Ball's Bluff, which he supposed was the ferry.

HEADQUARTERS EIGHTEENTH CORPS, June 27, 1864.

Brigadier-General BARNARD,Chief Engineer Armies in the Field:

SIR: I have the honor to transmit a sketch* of the position now occupied by the Eighteenth Army Corps. I will send a copy to Major Duane to-day. In our front the enemy have a strong work opposite our left, but on our right nothing but rifle-pits are between us and Petersburg. We are very much annoyed by batteries from across the Appomattox, which enfilade and see our lines in reverse. I am placing our batteries so as to concentrate a deal of fire in return, and hope to silence them. A detachment of engineer troops reported last evening.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

F. U. FARQUHAR.

Captain, U. S. Engineers.

JUNE 27, 1864-7.40.
