Colonel E. M. MCCOOK:

Your dispatch received. Had a brash little fight this p. m., and by the timely arrival of General Williams' division saved our left from being turned. Keep a sharp lookout on our left. I will send your dispatch to General Thomas, not knowing where to find General Howard.

D. S. STANLEY,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS FOURTH ARMY CORPS,McCane's House, May 14, 1864-10 p. m.

Major-General THOMAS:

GENERAL: Fearing that I might have left a wrong impression by a previous message, I will say that the left of Stanley was pressed back on to ridge which his main force occupied. His battery was doing good service, but the supports were giving way when General Williams' division, of General Hooker's corps, arrived, handsomely meeting and repulsing the enemy. I have this from one of my staff officers. I have not yet learned further particulars. I have ordered my works strengthened and a replenishment of stores. Wood and Newton held their advanced positions till the fighting closed, and I believe do so yet.

Very respectfully,

O. O. HOWARD,

Major-General.
