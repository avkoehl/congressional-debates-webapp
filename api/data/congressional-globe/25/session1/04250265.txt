(/) President's message of December 6,
The President's message of the 6th o f December, 1836, open
ed with a eongtatulation of Congress "on the hidi Mate of
prosperity which our beloved country has attained "
" With ne causea at home or abroad to lessen th,e confidence
with which we look to the future for continuing pi oofs of the
Capacity of otir free institutions to pioduce all the fiuits of
good Government, the geneial condition of oui affairs may well
excite our national pride '
' The expenditures for all objects during the year," then about
to expire, "are estimated," he told us, "not to exceed thirty
two million, and will leave in the Treasury, for public pui
poses on the 1st day of January, about 541,723,959 The sum,
with the exception of five millions, will be tiansfened lo the
several States, m accordance with the piovisions of the act
regulating the deposites of the public money "
" Under our present revenue system there is every pioba
bllity that there will continue to be a sviplus beyond the
wants of the Government, and it has become our duty to de
cide whether such a result be consistent with the true objects of
our Government
"Should a surplus be permitted toaccumulate beyond the
appropriations, it must be retained m the Treasury as it now
is, or be distributed among the people or the States
"To retain u m the Tseasury unemployed m any way is
impracticable
" It is, besides, against the genius of our free institutions to
loch up in vaults the treasure of the nalisn
" A distribution to the people is impracticable, and unjust in
othei respects
"Ktpenence continues to realize the expectations enteitame 1
as to the capacity of the State bmk^ to peifirmthe duties of
fiscal agents for the Government at the time of the íemoval of
the deposites
" It is now well ascertained that the real domestic exchanges,
performed through discounts of the United States Bank and its
twenty-five branches, were at least one third less than those of
the deposite banks for an equal period of time
" Independently of these services, which are far greater than
those rendpred by the United States Bank and its twenty five
branches, a number of the deposite banks have, with a com-
mendable zeal to aid in the improvement of the cuirency, lm
ported fiom abroad, at their own expense, targe sums of the
precious metals for coinage and circulation "

fests
" In the mean time, it is our duty to provide all the remedies
against a depreciated paper run t,ncy which the constitution
enables lis to aftoid Tup Treasury Department, onseveial
former occasions, has suggested the ptopnety and impor anee
ofa uniform law concerning bankruptciesof corporations and
other bankers Through the instrumentality of such a law, a

(ft) The following extract from a report recently made by the
Governor of the Bank of Fiance to a general meeting of the
stockholders, furnishes the grounds of the allusion to France
That to the money market of China is deuved fiom a late
English newspaper
" During the second half of the year 1S36, the security of
commerce appeared shaken, confidence was, for a moment,
weakened From the month of July some symptoms of a
partial distress had begun to manifest themselves The marca
of our manufactures had been so íapid, that there could not
have failed to arrive a period of teaction Some exportation
of coin, the impoitanee of which was exaggeiated, and which
are now insensibly reduced, excited aceitam degree of anxietv,
when a crisis rather severe overtook the United States The
scarcity of specie raised the interests of money theie to an ex
orbltant rate It was at London that the reaction of this cusi^
was first felt The Bank of England, notwithstanding the
power of her means of action, and her well known skill, found
herself obliged to raise the rate of discount from 4 to 4} pel
cent and subsequently to 3 Tne Bank of Amsterdam imitated
this example France could not withdraw herself entirely from
the influence of these events, for the commerce of the whole
world is more or less- responsible for all its pans
" Although this commercial reaction only reached us second
hand, and consequently enfeebled, H could not fail to develop
the seeds of embaí lassment which I have just now alluded to
Thus, m many towns ot the kingdom, the interest of money
rose to 5 and 54 and even for a moment to 6 per cent Money
became scarce, demands for specie were addie=sed to Pans

ASBUBY DICKINS, Secretary
To this bill Mr Locvns, of New York, had moved, in Com-
mittee of the Who e House on the state of the Union, the fol
lowing amendment lo the lirst section
"Providing that all banks give seeuilty for ti c payment of
four per cent per annum on all sums of money remaining m
their po°set. .^ &~ «euosres "

Mr CAMBEELDNGieplied ihatthe gentleman fiom Massachu
setts had answeied 1 is own mierrogatoiy, bv reading from the
bill itself The section simply meant to hold the deposne
ban^stn the peiforriance ortben obligations
Mi Anws resum d He could not peiceive tho n ed of
any law at all on the subject un'ess there was some pat t« ular
allusion in this provision of the bill to delinquent banks Ac
cording to this reply of the clian roan ol ihe Committee of Waj s
and Mta is the banks that have pallevoiy dollar (hey owe I tho
Trcasurj, and falthliilly complied with then engaffemenis ale
to be treated piecisely as defaulting banks aie
Mr Oambbelei^g remarked that the act would hold out m
ducements to comply faithfully with their engagements
Mi Adaiis liutof what earthly use is it to make such an
inducement fol those banks which have already and a!«ajs
done thlsl This was somewhat insulting to sut h institutions
The question was not answeied and he conceived that if th 
bill weie to pass in its present form, it would not operate as
any lellef to the depositi banks, being simply an act declaimg
that the Goiornmencwill not charge with unlawful interest anv
institution wh ch has always faithfully performed its enaage
ments The law would be a peifect deid lettei And here
Mi Alimsrtferied attain to the language of the bill It pro
vioes he said, that the money was to be positively dnwn—m
a gradual manner-with nofurthei mteiest chai treacle theieon
than that piovided by the deposite act oflR3b, to any bank
which has met and which shall meet, its engagements if a
bank had not complied ivllh its engagements, though the default
should be evei so small, this action has no applicauoi. to the
case It simply says to those which have fulfilled all then en
-a-emeuts we will not play the Shylock with you, because you
have been ti tie to your'engagements The n«t section of the
bll pioposcs to put the claims described ,n the first ection in
«mt Tnis certainly could not be done, inasmuch «is the only
banks to which any dnect allusion is had in that section aie
íhíse wmch have met, and shall meet,all itar.^ ments
This was the fiist ma airy Mr «idarns wished to make The

sweied,and what necessity there ww for tho pas-age of any

of a law was evei to re nedy som    existing evil, but in this
ca<*e the termo of thelaw itself deny that any evil exists
Mr Cambreleng rose quickly, and remarked, that at so
iatp a pei iod of the session, the fast working night, he could
vntwi te hh>time in discussing: nouns and pronoun* , verbs anil
adveib?  with the gentleman fiom Massachusetts.
Mr Adams resumed WelLsn, as language is composed of
nouns and pionouns, verhs and adverbSj when they are put to
getherto constitute the Jaw of the land, the meaning of them
may surely be demanded of the legislatoi, and those parts of
speech may well be used for such a purpose But if suth ex-
pt natou be impossible, it ceuamly ought not to beevptícted
that this House will consent to pass a law composed of nouns
and pionouns, verbs and adveibs, rhich the author of it hm
self does not understand

Mi A piesumed that the bill wa* susceptible of amend

wou d make t'ie bill operative for some end or object, he
would so ioi such an amendment, although he should after
WdicK vote agiins-t the bill He should not him^tlf offei any
such amendment líe would suppose that it was geneially
believed by membeis, who had not parüfufaily noted the
phiafeeology of the bill, that it was intended to relieve delin-
quent deposite banks—banks wh'ch had suspended specie
payments banks which had not met the requisitions of the
Department—binks which had dishonoied its diafts, and
thereby become liable to the demand of some further mteref-t
than tho.t lequued by the deposit, act of 2-id June, 1836, which
fuuhei inteiest it 1s; the puipo^e of this ptovision of the bill to
lehnquish, on the pait «f the United States But this-section
has no reference to any such bank It appliessolely and exclu-
sively to bank;, which have met, and shall meet, all the iequisi
tions. of the Department—which have not suspended specie
payments—which have punctually paid, and shall heieafter
pay, every dollai of diaft due by them and with exquisite
abatndity tins section piovn'er, that no turther mterevt shall
be demanded of them than that required by the deposite aft
of lunc, ¡83b that is that the Government will not demand rf
them that which it ha= not the shadow or pretence of a right
to dt maná Aow, Mi A sad he would suppose it intent ed
to apply to the delinquent ba-iK and he must a«k another
que tun, which, in the opinion of tbt, ch uinwn ot the Commit
tee it Wdya iiid Mean mi^ht stein to beti ty .neat lguoiance

proviso contained m thi1* bill, that "uo further mteiest shall
be demanded of the hanks though delinquent, than that m
quned by the deposite act of 23d June, Ib^o"*"
It was necessary to presuppose, in order to give any mean
ing to this passage, that the Government have a right to
demand something more than this, and, although the chairman
of the Committee of Ways and Means was so unwill ng te
answci his question*, he muht btiil hold him responsible to
the committee for a'propei explan ilion of his own piepobi
