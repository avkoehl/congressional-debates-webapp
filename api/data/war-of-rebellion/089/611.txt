HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS,November 12, 1864.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

A deserter from the Thirteenth South Carolina Regiment has just come in. Came on the picket-line last evening. Heard no news from Hood or Early. Says that Mahone's division went into camp yesterday; means winter quarters. Says that when they finish the entrenchments they will go into winter quarters. From this man's account their line of entrenchments haves rather a formidable profile.
