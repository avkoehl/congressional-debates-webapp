THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
February 24,
which he considered a great and growing diffi-
culty in Congress Those of us who have been
here longest, have felt that the accumulation of
private business has been so great, and is increas-
ing, that it threatens to oveiwhelrn us lie was
desirous that some measure should be introduced
for the purpose of reducing tne number of appli-
cations to Congress upon private business He
would oftei a joint íesoiuüoh, which he held in
his hand, not foi consideration now, but to let it
lie on the table, that it might meet the attention
of Congress and of the people, in the hope that,
at the next session, which is the long session,
some action may be had upon it
Mr. W. then submitted the following joint res-
olution.
Mesolved by the Senate and House of Representatives
of the United States ofJLmei tea m Congress assembled,

sist of-------members of each House, be appointed

ify them according to their subjects
2   To consider the practicability of diminish-
ing the number of private applications to Con-
gress, either by vesting the authority of deciding
on such claims, or some of them, in some public
board, or m the several depaitmenls, or by other
proper provision, and to report theieon

signee, &c , was read the third time and passed
BRANCH MINTS.
The bill for establishing branches of the mint
of the United States in North Carolina, Georgia,
and New Orleans, being under consideration on
its third reading,
Mr HILL said, that having voted steadily
against the bill for creating three additional mints,
which must be conducted exclusively at the ex-
pense of the people of the United States, and
against some of those Senators with whom he had
the happiness, generally, to agiee, he felt a neces-
sity for explaining the grounds on which he gave
hi  votes.
Mr H had been struck very forcibly, when the
blanks, were filled up, with the fact that the sala- |
ríes for  the several officers of the mint at New
Orleans were placed fiom  twenty-five to unity- I
three per cen*   higher than would be expected at I
any other point of the Union     In addition to '
this., it was to be obseived, that during the sickly
season of from llu'elokix mon'hs in the yen,
the operations ot  the mint at that pkce mist Le
suspended     The additional expense of coming at
New Orleans must be fai greatei than the expense
ot  tiaiisportation would   be  from   New Organs
back and forward to the mint at Philadelphia
Mr H. considered that Lojisulle, in Ken-
tucky, would be a far preferable point foi a mint
it would be moie central loi the westein country,
and the di*Feierce of the expense of coinage at
the two places in favor of Lou.sville would much
more than pay all fhe expenses of liansportation
back and forwaid of the bullion or material for
coinage
Mr H said, if he could believe for a moment
that the establishment of these three new mints
would be the means of introducing a specie cir-
culation—would change the circulation of paper
for that of the precious metals—he would consent
to incur some expense to the treasury to eiect
such an object He believed that the introduc-
tion cf the new mints would not make hard money
more plpnty A large poi Hon of the gold which
would be coined at New Oileans would not be
from bullion 01 native go'd, but from gold already
coined The recent law had made all foi eijn gold
a tender—so that the coinage of gold in any vi-
cinity could not and would not make gold more
plenty. That cnculation must depend on other
circumstances—on the prohibition, by the State
and local Legislatures, of papei bills of certain de
nominations
It had been said that the gold finding business
required protection the bill of the last session of
Congress had laised the value of gold six percent
Mr. H lefeired to the last report of the direct-
or of the mint at Philadelphia, by which it ap-
peared that the gold coinage at the mint during
the last year, (half eagles $3,G60,845,and quarter
eagles $293,425,) has " exceeded the aggiegate
coinage of gold during the nine piecedmg years,"
and that the amount of silver coinage in the same
time exceeds by about one quaitei of a million of
dollars the coinage of any pieviousyeai He also
showed from that leport, that of the gold received
during last yeai, &89S 000 was recened fiom the
gold legions of the United States, £,225,000 from
Mexico, South Amenca, and the West Indies,
$2,180,000 fiom Emope, $12 000 from Africa,
and J>9,000 from sources not ascertau ed, and that
of the whole amount received fiom Euiope, about
four-fiftns were in foieign coins
This statement fiom the mint at Philadelphia
showed most conclusively that this institution was
ample for all the wants ot the country The gold
coinage of the last single half year had exceeded
the whole gold coinage of the last nine yems—
while the siivei coinage had exceeded that of any
previojs year The importation of gold, íesultmg
from its increased value, had been greater during
the last year than cou'd be calculated on hereaf-
ter, and it was found that the mm tat Philadelphia,
even with its piesent force, was ample foi the
coinage of all that could be required for the suo
ply of the whole United State-. If, in a lime
like the present, the National Mint is sufficient
for all ■the wants of the nation, of what seivice
can three additional mints be to the countrj,
when the importation of gold and silver shall be
discontinued' In time of wai, the opeiations of
the mint will be stopped, but the saianes of the
officers and men will go on, and this bill will
establish and create from twenty to tmrty officeis,
with larger salaries than the highest and most
responsible officers in many States ot the Union.
1 object to the bill (said Mr H ) because, after
incurring an expense in the outlay of half a mil-
lion of dollars, it wdl fix a permanent annual ex-
penditure of one hundred thousand dollars, and
all this, when the gold, silver, and copper, aie
coined, not for the benefit of the who'e people,
but for the benefit of individuals Even if there
should be no coinage, the expenses of the several
mint establishments must go on
Mr. H. said the statement made in the Senate on
Saturday relative to the thirteen mints in France,
Pad induced him to make inquiry in lelation to
the fact.    He said theie Were thirteen minis m
] France   but omy three of them were authorized
, to coin gold      The mints of Fiance had this nn-
pcitant d fference   fiom the mint of the United
States—they wete m the nature of private inslitu
tionJ     The mint of the United States was a pub
lie institution, coining g ftuitously for n dividuals
| all of the precious metals tnat may be committed
I to its charge     He quoted fiom Goldsmith'  Sta-
| tistics of 1 ranee, by which  it was bhown that
the charges for coinage at the Royal M ints in that
I country weie 29 centimes for eveiy 100 flanes m
I gold, [hat is, 20 cen tunes for Ices, ano 9 centimes for
¡ coming, and on silvei, one fianc and fitly certimes
for every one hundred frarc , that is, one franc
¡ foi   coining,   and   fifty   centimes   for   los^      He
I showec' from this book that in the year 1827, the
pi ofits fiom the mints, after paying all ex¡ ens<s
of lecoimng  and   sala'ies  to  ihe  Govenmenr,
amounted to 120 000 fiancs, or about 4,23,000    If
(said Mr   H ) the mints in this country were
founded on the  same  principle as they are m
Fiance, he would have no objection to addirg three
to the pie en' numbei, oi any additional number
In England there is but a single mint, as theie
is in this country, and it is a Goveinme it institu-
tion, nearly similar to tha„ of the United States
FromRees't, Cyclopediaj'he found ibeaceountthat
in foimei times there was a mint m neaily ever/
county of England, that at this time there is only
one single mint foi the whole of England, Scot-
land, and Ireland     That mint is in London, and
the single institution pioduces coin with so great
facility, that the whole wants of the coun'iy are
by it supplied     As one mint in that countiy is
sufficient for the whole United Kingdom, so one
mint will be ample for the coinege of all that the
wants of this country may requite
The Senator fiom Missoun [Mr Benton] has
declared the system of mints to be a pan of the
haid money system I will not yield to any gen-
tleman that he is more the friend of a haid money
currency than I am myself He supposes hard
money cannot be diffused through the West and
the South, if these mints shall not be established
He should recollect that banks are the natuial
enemies of a hard money circulation, especially
will bank notes of a small denomination duve out
of circulation hard money Haid money, gold
soveieig|is,and Spanish milled dolíais, and Fiench
ciowns, was moie plenty within the British pro
vince of Canada, until local banks were there
established, than I have ever known it tc be in the
United States Specie was constantly biought
fiom that province in quantities Yet the mints
at which this hard money was pioduced, were
thousands of miles distant So at New Otleans,
until banks were there established, specie, gold
doubloons, and silver dollars, were theie always
to be had in abundance Drive small bank notes
out of circulation, and no additional mint can be
wanted to give th*. people all the gold and silver
they may desire
We have had, very recently, (said Mr H ,) a
severe lecture on executive patronage, in the report
of a committee on that subject Is it not matter
of suipnse that gentlemen who should take a con-
spicuous part in that committee should, in a few
days thereafter, advocate the passage of a law
wh'ch will invest the Executive with an additional
annual patronage of at least $100,000'
The leport of the committee he considered a
valuable document for some purposes Mr II.
said he had a large number of extra copies of this
leport sent to him. He thought the report did
not represent facts in then Hue light, and on that
account he did not feel disposed to distnbute with
alacrity such a document But he considered it
valuable for another purpose He desn etl to have
it always before membeis of Congress, when they
had under consideiation such projects for expend-
ing the people's money as that of the mints which
was now before us Mr H read several para-
giaphsfrom Mr Calhoun's leport, among which
was the following
" Experience has shown that it is next toimpos-
' sible to reduce the public expenditure with an
' o\ erfiowing treasury; and not much less difficult
' to reduce patronage without a reduction of ex-
'penditure-, or, in other words, that the nost
