APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

Making public officers depositaries—Mr. Calhoun.
Senate.
Constitution which gives to Congress the right to
regálate commprce, and which he says involves the
right and obligation to furnish a sound circulating
medium The train of his reasoning, as far as I
could comprehend it, was, that, without acurrency,
commerce could not exist, at least to any conside-
rable extent, and, of course, there would be no-
thing to regulate, and, therefore, unless Congress
furnished a currency, its power of regulating com-
merce would become a mere nullity, and from
which he inferred the light and obligation to fur-
nish, not only a currency, but a bank currency'
Whatever may be said of the soundness of the
reasoning, all must admit that his mode of con-
struing the Constitution is very bold and novel
To what would it lead' The same clause, in that
instrument, which gives Congress the right to
coin money and regulate the value thereof, gives
it also the kindred right to fix the standard of
weights and measures They are just as essen-
tial to the existence of Congress as the currency
itself The yard and the bushel are not less ím
psrtant in the exchange of commodities than the
dollar and the eagle, and the very tram of rea
somng which would make it the right and duty
of the Government to furnish the one, would
make it equally so to furnish the other Again
commerce cannot exist without ships and other
means of transportation Is the Government also
bound to furnish them1 Nor without alucies, or
commodities, to be exchanged, cotton, rice, tobac-
co, and the various products of agriculture
and manufactures. Is it also bound to furnish
them? Nor these m turn, without labor, and
must that, too, be furnished? If not I ask the Se-
nator to make the distinction Where will he
draw the lint, and on what principles? Doe1- he
rot see that, according to this mode of construc-
tion, the highei powers granted in the Constitution
■would carry all the inferior, and that this would
become a Government of unlimited powers? Take,
for instance, the war power, and apply the same
mode of construction to it, and what power would
theie be that Congress could not exercise—nay, be
bound to exercise? Intelligence, morale,wealth, num-
bers, currency, all are important elements of power,
and m?y become so to the defence of the Union and
sale'y ot ihe country, and, according to the Sena-
tor s reasoning, the Government would have the
right, and would be m ^uty bound, to take charge
of the schools, the pulpit^ thp industry, the popu'a-
tion, as well as the currency, of the country, and
the5e Houl 1 comprehend the entire cacle of legisla-
t on, and leave the State Governments as useless
appendages of the system
Having now, I trust, taken down to ihe ground
the lutle centre baildmg, with its four apartments,
nothing re-nams of the entire structure but the huge
portico m front, and on which I shall next com-
mence the work of demolition The Senator
optn d his discouise on credits and banks, by as-
set ting that bank credit was, m truth and reality,
so much capital actually added to the community
I waive the objection, that neither credit, nor the
l ankmg system, is involved in the question, and
i íat th«se who aie opposed to the union of the po-
1 tical and money power, oppose that union, with
other reasons, on the ground that it is unfavorable
to a full developaient of the «edit system and dan-
gi rous to the banks themselves, which they believe
c in only be saved from entire destruction by the
separation, and ltfollows, of course, that all he said
in relation to them is either a begging of the ques-
ti n, or irrelevant Eut, assuming what he said
io be applicab'e, I shall show that it is either un-
founded m fact or erroneous m conclusion.
bo lar from agreeing vv ith the Senator, that what
he calls bank credit is so much real capital added
the country, I hold the opposite—that banks do not
add a cent of capital, or credit Regarded strict-
ly the ciedit of banks is limited to the capital ac-
tually paid m Thte usually is the only sum for
which the stockholders are liable, and, without
what is called banking privileges, they would not
have a cent of ciedit beyond that amount But
the capital subscribed and paid is not created by
the banks It is drawn out of the general fund of the
country Now, I ask, what constitutes its credit be-
yoná capital? In the first place, and mainly, it is de-
rived from the fact that both General and State
Governments receive and treat bank notes as cash,
and thereby, to the extent of their fiscal action,
virtually give them the use of their credit It is
an existing credit, belonging to them exclusively,
and is ne ther created, nor increased, by permitting
the banks to use it In the next place, the depo-
sites with the banks, both public and private, add a
large amount to their credit, but this again is either
the property or credit of the Government and in-
dividuals, which they are permitted to use, and
which they neither create nor increase Finally,
notes and bonds, or other credits discounted by
the banks, made up their credit, which are neither
more nor less than the credit of the drawers and
endorsers, on which the banks do business They
take m the paper or credit oí others, payable at a
given day, deduct the interests in advance, and
giv« out their own credit or notes, payable on de
mand, without interest, that is, the credit of their
own papei rests on the credit of the paper dis-
counted, or taken in exchange, which credit they
neither create nor increase In a word, all their
credit beyond the capital actually paid in is but
the credit of the public, or individuals, on which,
by what is called banking privileges, they are per-
mitted to do business and make profit, and so far
from creating credit or capital, they in fact add
not a cent of capital or credit to that which pre-
viously existed
But the Senator next tells us that there is three
hundred millions of banking capital in the Union,
and that it is real bona fide solid capital, as much
so a' the plantations of the South Uhis is certain-
ly pews to me I had supposed that this vas
amount was little more than a fictitious mass of
c-elit pued on credit, 'n the erection of which bat
little specie or real capital was used, and that,
when a new bank was created, the wheelbairow
was put m motion to roll the specie from the old
to the new institution, till it got fully undei way,
when it was rolled back again But it seems that
all this is a mistake, that the whole capital is actu-
ally paid in cash, and is as solid as terra firma
itself This eertatnly is a boid assertion, m the
face of facts daily occurring There have bet n,
if I mistake not, four or five recent bank explo-
sions in the Senator's own town, m which the
whole vanished into thm air, leaving nothing be-
hind but ruin and dessolation What has become
of that portion ot his solid capital? Did Ihe Se-
nator ever hear of a plantation thus exploding and
vanishing? And 1 would be glad to know how
1 irge a portion of this three hundred millions of
solid capital w 11 finally escape in the same way?
A lev" years may enable us to insiver the question
TheSptiaui next, bv way of illustration,under-
took to draw a distinction between bank cied t and
Government credit, or pubic stocks, in which he
was not veiy successful It would be no difficult
task to prove that thej both rest substantially on
debt, and that the Government stock ma\ be, and
is, to a great extent, actually applied in the same
mode as bank credit in the use of exchanges and
business it, m fact, constitutes, to a great extent,
the very basis of banking operation, but, after hav-
ing occupied the Senate so long, it would be unrea-
sonable to consume their time on what was intro-
duced as a mere illustrat on
The Senator next undertook to prove the im-
mense advantage of banking institutions He ask-
ed vvhat would be done with the surplus capital of
the country, if it could not be invested in bank
stocks? In this new and growing countr>, with
millions on millions of lands, of the best quality,
still lying ummpioved, with vast schemes of im-
provements, constantly requiring capital, with the
immense demand for labor for every branch of bu-
siness, ihe last question I ever expected to hear ask-
ed is that propounded by the Senator I had sup-
posed the greater difficulty was to find capital, and
not how to dispose ot it, and that this difficulty had
been one of the main reasons assigned in favor of
the banking system
The next benefit he attnbutes to the system was
the vast amount of lands, which had passed out of
the hands of the public into that of individuals of
late, which he estimated, during the last three
years, at thirty-six millions ef acres, forming a sur-
face equal m extent to England, and which be
aiated would rise in value greatly, in consequence of
their passing into private hands. That this im-
mense transfer has been effected by the banks, I ad-
mit, bat that it is to be considered an advantage to
the country, I certainly never expected to hear
uttered any where, especially on this floor, and by
one so intelligent as the Senator. I had smmased
it was infinitely better for the community at large,
and particularly for those not id affluent fát&am-
stances, that the lands should remain m possession
of the Government than of speculators, till wanted
for settlement, and that one of the most decided ob-
jections to our banking system is, that it becomes
the instrument of making such immense transfer*,
whenever the currency becomes excessive. This
is a point not without interest, and I mast ask the
Senate to bear with me, -while I pause for a few
moments to explain it
The effect of an expanding currency is to raise
prices, and to put speculation in motion. He who
buys, in a short time seems to realize a fortune,
and every one is on ihe look-out to make success-
ful investments, and thus prices receive a constant
upward impulse, with the exception of the public
lands, the price of which is fixed at f 1 25, excepting
such as are sold at public auction. The rise of
other landed property soon creates a new demand
for the public lands, and speculation commences
its giant operations in that quarter Vast purchases
are made, and the revenns of the Government in-
creases in proportion to the increased sales The
payment is made in bank notes, and these pass
from the land offices to the deposite banks, and con-
stitute a large surplus for new banking fasilmes and
accommodations Applicants from all quarters
press in to partane of the rich harvest, and the notes
repass into ihe hands of speculators to be reinvested
in the purchase of public lands. They again pass
througn the hands of receivers, and thence to the
banks, and again to the speculators, and every re-
volution of the wheel increases the swelling tide,
which sweeps aw aj millions of the choicest acres
from the Government to the monopolizers for bank
notes, which, in the end, prove as worthless as the
paper on which they are wr.tten Had this pro-
cess not been arrested, by the deposite act of 1836,
and had the banks avoided an explosion, in a short
time the whole of the public domain, the precious
inheritance of the people ot this Union and their
descendants, would have passed through the same
process with the thirty-six millions of acres whieh
the Senator so highly commends What took
place then vv ill again take place, at the v ery next
swell cf the paper tide, unless, indeed, mis bill
should beco ne a law, which would provi. an effec-
tual chtck a_,amst its recirrence
The Senatoi next attubutes our extraordinary
advance in improvement and prosperity to the
banking S}stem He puts down as nothing our
free institutions, the security in which tie people
enjoy their right , t'ie vast extent of cur country,
and th" fertility o its soil, and the energy, indus-
try, and enterprise of the stock from which we are
descended All these, it seems, are as dust Ths
banks are every thing, and without them we would
have been but little advanced in improvement or
prosperity It is much more easy to assign our
prosperity to the banking system than to prove it.
That in its early stages it contributed to give an.
impulse to industiy and improvement I do not deny,
but that, in its present excess, it impedes rather
than promotes either, I hold to be certain That
vie aie not indebted to it foi oar pxtraordinary ad-
vance and improvements, wholly or mainly, there
is an aigumein, which I regard as decisive Before
the Rev olution, we had no banks, and y et our im-
provement and prosperity, all 'hings considered,
wtre as great antenoi to it, as since, whether we
regard the increase of populaiion oi wealth At
that ume, not a bank note was to be seen, and the
whole circulation consisted either of gold and sil-
ver, or the colonial paper monev, which all now,
and especially ihe Senator, considers so worthless
Had the Senator Uvea during that period, he might,
with equal plausibility, hare attributed all the im-
piovement and prosperity of ths country to the old
colonial paper money, as he now do s to the banks ;
and have denounced any attempt to change or im-
