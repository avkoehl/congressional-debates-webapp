connected with his statement convince me that it has good foundation. Am just mounting to join you. Also reports Pickett reoccupied and drove Gibbon's troops out of heights we captured yesterday.

Colonel AMBROSE THOMPSON,

Keep as much of the public property afloat as you can until further orders. Be prepared to act on your judgment at short notice. See that your depot is kept constantly prepared.

Colonel D. H. RUCKER,

Ship no more horses or other stores until further notice. Please advise Captains Stoddard and Ferguson. My reasons are good.

General H. HAUPT,

Supt.of Military Railroads, Falmouth Station, Va.:

The bridge need not be built, of course, at present. You doubtless will se that your road stock is not molested by any raid of the rebels.

Chief Quartermaster.

MAY 4, 1863.

Colonel R. INGALLS,

United States Ford, Va.:

Your suggestions have been anticipated. I have ordered all rolling-stock not required for use here to be returned to Alexandria. Would it not be well not to keep too large supplies at Falmouth?

H. HAUPT.

MAY 4, 1863.

General HAUPT,

Supt.of Military Railroads, Falmouth Station, Va.:

I do not wish any more supplies taken up until further notice. I hope you will ask for protection at Aquia in case of necessity, though we trust to fight out in excellent style yet.

RUFUS INGALLS,

Chief Quartermaster.
