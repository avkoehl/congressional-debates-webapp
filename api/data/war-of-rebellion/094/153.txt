Rebel General Lyon, with from 2,00 to 3,000 men, with nine pieces of artillery, captured an up boat, at Cumberland City, Friday evening, and was crossing the river yesterday. He captured the Ben South that left here yesterday. The other boats all returned except two, who ran the battery and are at Fort Donelson.

Colonel A. A. SMITH, Clarksville:

It has been reported by the assistant quartermaster at Clarksville that the boats captured by the rebel General Lyon have all been burned. Will you report at once whether the statement is correct.

Major-General THOMAS:

The Thomas E. Tutt and Ben South are certainly burned. Tow-boat Echo has not returned-supposed to have been burned. A courier left Donelson last night at 12 o'clock. Echo had not arrived there. The two that had run the battery had arrived.

My scouts have just been driven in by Lyon's men, but I do not think he will come here, but threaten me. I think he will go to Hopkinsville, Bowling Green, or Russellville. I am ready for him.

Colonel, Commanding.
