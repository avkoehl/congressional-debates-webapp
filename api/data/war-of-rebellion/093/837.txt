I am confident that the enemy were not moving east of Bristol. My scouts have just returned. Have sent another scout toward Bristol. I will encamp three miles out on Saltville road. and will keep a strong picket in Abingdon. I have sent courier to Giltner, directing him to move his command [to] Abingdon.

The enemy has passed me beyond Bristol. I will try to check him at Abingdon.

CLARK'S HOUSE, NEAR GLADE SPRINGS,

December 14, 1864.

GENERAL: I advanced to the junction of the salt-works roads, where I found the enemy, I think, in considerable strength. He was poster in as strong position, and his line of fires was about three-quarters of a mile long. After driving in the pickets I could hear the rumbling of wheels, but could not determine whether of wagons or artillery. I dismounted and advanced upon the front of the position, but did not attack, because I feared they were too strong. My guide deserted me at the first shot, and I have not yet found him. I am now about a mile from the junction of the roads, awaiting the report of a scout I have sent to Glade Springs.

Very respectfully,

B. W. DUKE,

Brigadier-General.

The scout has just returned from Glade Springs, and reports no enemy there.

B. W. DUKE.

Major-General BRECKINRIDGE,

Commanding Forces.
