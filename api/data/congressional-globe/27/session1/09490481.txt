Bankrupt Bill—Mr. Brown.

the dispirited desponding, desp tiring debtoi, aud restores him
to the ei joymcnt of society and the equal blessings of a merci
ful Pjov dente
The causes tint have pieventedthe action of Congress on
this important subject aie wor by of a brief considei anon
A. few observa ro s o i ihe history of legislation on the suhject
of bankruptcy and insolvency may explain the true reasons
why former attemp s to pass a. uniform system ot bankrupt
laws have faded, and why this attempt now meets with embar
rassment
The fiist and only successful attempt to pass a general bank
rupt law was in 1S0J That law was par íal in its operation (in-
cluding only meic lants and tradeis) and limited mils duration
It was destg ed lather a&ieliefto those who were then unfor
túnate than as a system such a  the Constitution contemplates
—general, uniform and permanent For these and other
causes connecied with the political influences of that period, it
was tepealed m 1803 Although, this law was defective, and
not well calculated to corciliate public favor, us repeal was
unfortunate It si ould have been amended and made more
acceptable to the public mind The consequence of the repeal
ofthislawwas an at empt on tne part of the Stales to supply
its pitee i y local !eDis!a i n This attempt has been cained
en up to thrs time, ind h s given rise to a variety of loc tl, and
of course d fecrrve systems nroduemg that confusion tnd want

some degiee, fav rues in hen respec ive States Th s spnnss
fiom a law < fout natute which makes us most aita hid to
systems to which we aie mu=t accustomed and which ve best
understand A V r¿inian admires and loves most Virginia
laws, because he best under stands them and because he or his
forefathers have b u ne a ] art m their enactment The North
Carolinian a Imiies and reveres h s system of laws foi the same
reason, and so ot a1! oiheis on this floor We come heiewith
oui local atuci ments anl with opinions influenced by local
c tuses Ibis has cieited, and now creates, the greatest obsta
ele in the way of the passftre of a gencial and umfoim bank
rupt law These local prefei encesandjattachments to particular
systems, in aspintof patriotism, mustoe compiomised Vve
must all yield something and m so doing we will arrive at a
point at which we can all meet We shall then arrive at the
true spirit of the Constitution, and form a system that will be
uniform throughout the Vr ited States
There aie, sn strong motives of public interest which re
qture the sacrifice of 1 ical and particular attachments when
they come in the way of this gi at measur o of policy and relief
The systems of bankruptcy passed by State egrslation, as I
have shown, are not only variant, but are and must be, essen
«ally defective, Irom a want of sufficient powei in the States
They cannotoperate beyonllhe limits of their resj ecuve ju
risdictions All contracts made out ol the btate, and all per
sons íesiding out of the Stat", are free from then operation
They cannot opérale on contiacts made befoie the passage of
the law, and in this respect also they aie unable to give gene
ral rslief
But, sir, only loos into etiese State systems, and see what
contusion exists. One State adopts a system of general lnsol
venoy, auotheronlyahmittd or temporaiy system, one Cas is
the case m Maryland) relieves from the obligation of future
contracts, another only fiom imprisonment The laws of
sonr1 States give an undue preference to citizens of (heir own
fotate, while others, with more libera! justice, provide for the
equal payment of all, at home and abioad, without favor oi
piefeience
Does noteveiy one see that, m this infinite confusion, gr at
injury is necessarily mfl.ctcdon the freedom o< conimen p, open

and want ot confi lence at war with all the best mitiest ol so
ciety? When l tins confus on to end! Will if grow bettei hy
delay, until these local atachments anl t/rtiuJiees gain still
moie strength? Sir, the only coi re tlve is iñ the exmci e of the
constitutional power ves ed in Congress, and that conective
should be applied now I hope that honorable members on this
lioot are in a sr nit ol compromise, and that without dutnrc
tion ol party (lor pai ty lines si ould be unknown on this ques
tion,) they wi 1 come up to the expectations of the countiy—
pass the bill—and asseit arid vindicate the wisdom of our fore
fathers in giving ha contiol of this subject to the National I e
gislature
jBut I am met with objections, which, if not answeied, may
impede 111 passage of this ireasure It is contended that there
is no powei in Congiesstojnclude antecedent con races, ot such
contracts as have bee made before the pas age of the bi 1 This
argument is lounded in en oi growing out of no! distinguishing
properly between Fedeial and S ate legislation on this subject

m the case oi bantu uptcy, has this power wi'hout hmltiuoo or
oi contiol lurthei than that all laws passed on the subject u

Again it is ontended that the grant of power m the Co s i
tution to pass t niloi m laws on the subject of bankru| tcy had
reference to the mstem then existing in Gieat Br'tam wl ich
only included mere ants and traders, and consequently nonej

Seavinsr the mod  anl nrtnner of its exeieise to defend on the

Why at empt to limit the exei cr o ot this power bv th  partiru

tion? V. hy not as well lefer to the systems of í raí ce or Gti
many! VV by attempt to fetter the legislation of Congress and
prevent its i'aptation to the many changes and improvements

take plage? S ich short signted views never entered tue hea Is
9( tlie iwhers of the Constitution,   They have given the power,
and left the nme and manner of its exercise to the sound discre
tior of Cor giess
Agxm it is objected that this bill does not include corpoia-
tions especially banks I his argument, it wil be seen, con
filets with the argument coming from he same somce wh eh I
have lust noticed Ifit betruethat ihe power vested in Con
gress has leference to the sjstem existing in Great Britain at
the dale of the Constitution, as that svstem did not include cor
porationsor banks, it follows, fiom this mode of reasoning that
they cannot be included now But I waive this inconsistency
in the aigument, and go to a direct nonce of the objection
Waiving for the present the constitutional objections to including
banks,it sremstome thato'her difficulties are insuperable If
banks are included, shall they be included within the volunlary
oi the involuntary clause? None, I suppose, aie m favoi of
allowing them to become voluntary bankrupts They mus ,
then, if included at all be included undei the involuntary clause
Tor what act then, shall a bank be declaied bankiupt? Tor
stopping specie payments? This is sometimes allowed by their
charters, with no othei penalty than the payment of a per cent
age on their notes which may be presented during suspension
In other cises indeed m nearly or quite ever) caee, the Stale
LegisUtuies esabzetht suspensión fttr, are you piepared to
run in d rectconfl ct with State legislation?
But again the system must be ' umfoim " Ii you say a
bank snail sutrcn lei us effects because it fails to meet usen
gagements at the diy will you apply the same luletoi nil
vidua!?? If vou did sir, you would hear < f a storm galhenng
over jour held There is anothei difficulty n tiic wav A
number of the banks belong exclusivelj to the Sates iheie
is one bank with a number of blanches of that des nption m
n y own State, (lenne see ) It, like the balance has stopped
specie payment Now I would like lo know if this bank is in
eluded, whether Ihe Stale is included als i? The Slate owns all
the capita! and lshibte for itscnculation, and I do not sec how
the b ink tan be w ound up without making the State a party to
the pioreedirg
But sir, I will leave this objection It does seem to me that
gentlemen aie scarcely senous in pres uig n 1 In quest on
has been tried m ti e Señale and voted down byamafouty rl
two (o one and I take it foi grantid that those who are
urging this objection do it with i view of tefeating the bill
W bethel corporations aie included or not, they will vote
against it
Another ohjirtion raised to the passage of this measure is,
that it will do injustice to eieditois lhis is, perh ips the most
populai objection that has been mged, andd°seive iherefoie a
parurulai examinan n I do notbclieve tl at cie mors under
the operaiionofabaikriipt law, will get less than they will as
'he law now stands It contemplates the giving up all the
debtor has and then he is only entitle ! to his til chargt in case
he is found to be honest If must bv borne in m rd that honesty
is the basis of the bankrupt's discharge ihe eieditois are au
ihonzed to sift every fict necessary to show concealment or
dishonest practices on the part of the debtn, and if a stain is
left, he is not entitled to his acquittal So that all arguments
drawn fiom the supposition that the debtor has a ted fraudu
l ntly, are without foundation in fact 1 hty onlv go to prove
the debtor is not entitled to his discharge Thebil! pioceeds on
the gioundofonly discharging those who aie strictly honest If
now and then one estapes who is not so, it is only because of the
impeifcction that belongs to all earthly tribunals Now sir,
aftei debtors have actually given up all and tinned rhemselves
penmlesson the woild hr w much is evei collected out of them
afiei wards? I venture the assertion ihattheie is on an average,
taking all the debts of the countiy together not moie collected
iban Tsexpet ded in trying to make i ollect on* aid I may fur

throug'jthohonoiofihe del toi thai ihe coercions of ihe 1 iw
I think, fheiefoie, ihat creditois will lose n nhing— lhat they
have more to hope for from voluntary payments than from any
thing else
But sir, what are thf rights of creditors^ It was once
thought a rartol their nchts consisted in the power toimpn
son then debior u will but that is tbrogafed as a lehc of a
barbarous age In what do then rights now consist? All
agree th it they have a rialit to a ful! and honest Mirreridex of
the elector's property 1 his the bankiupt law n quires Does
the n htgo further th"n this? Has the cieiitor tie right to
ippioprine the future earn n"s and pi rstna! seivices of the
debtoi? If o, it f Hows that he should be enfltledloar medy
to enfoice this right and, consequertlv shoul 1 le allowed to
sell him out Thlsconclusion shows the absurdity of the right
assumed Nosucli right does or can exist wheie fieedom is
llffhtly appreciated
But it issaid theie aie case  wnen the debtor is ti usted not
en the faith ol what propertv he owns, b t on his honor    The
uiswei is this 1 w dies i ot d stuib tlieth igation of honor     It

will you dcrade the obligation of honor by asking   he assist

This bill divides debtortfinto two clasees—one class consisting
of merchants and tiaders, the other class including all others
Meichanis and traders when guilty of a disliorestact, (such as
making a fiaudulcnt convevance, <tc ) aie subject to the com
pulsoiy pioccss and are called mvoluniary bankrupis AU
otbeis have the light 10 choose wbethei they wjl! becomo
bankiuptsoi not, and, when they choose to accept the piovi-
sionsofihelawin their favor, they are called voluntary bink
rupts The i esult is, no one, under this bill, can be forced into
bankiuptcy except tiadeis, and lhen only when they are
proved to be dishonest In all other cases it is voluntary
The unfortunate debtor may accept the provisions of this law
in his favor or not, as his jud ment and feelings may dirrct
II he accepts it, then he is bound to make a full and fan dn>
closuteofall his property, which is divided equally among his
creditors If the debtor, on full examination is found honest,
he is dischaiged from future liability If, on ihe contrary lie
is found to be dishonest, then he íeceives no discharge but re
mains liable in all lespects, as he was befóle
Fiom this geneial glance at the punciplesof the bill, it wid
beseen that tl e stiongtstmotives oi honesty are continually
held out A distinction is continually made between an hi
nest and a dishonest debtor The desire oi inclination to con
ceal piopeity is checked bv the consequeues that will flow
from it whi'e, on the olhei hand, the open dlsclosute and full
euirrndei of all the piopeity a debtor basis rewatdedty anho-
noiahle discharge Motneslike these, continually pie?ented to
the mind cannot fail lo exeicrse a happy mfluer ce on the mo
rals and integnty of society How does the law now sand?
The debtoi must give up all his property, and, aftet lit nía
done tins he still íemains in bondage to his creduois His fu
ture earnings, though it be bv the sweat of his blow, are
continually watched, end he is often induced to conceal the
flints of ins laboi to supply the wants of a wife and lieiplcss
chldren who call on him for bread This giadua ly o r ks h m
m his own estimation, his punci[ lesgive way, and, m the end,
he is peihaps guilty of acts his soul once abhorred '1 his bill
piesentshighei motives and leads to more elevated molality It
gives lo the relation of debtor and creditor a more elevated
standard, taking away its serví ude and '•hams, and placing in
their stead the nobler tics of mtegntj and honor
-ir, thedebtor isnotalone mteie ted in this measure It
will be in many instances, the be=t security of Ihe ci cditoi It
will, m my judgment, greatly lessen the amount of fraud that
is nowa'most continually committed on the lights of creditors
1 his bill foibids conveyances made with adesign of preferung
onecreilitoi to anothei—placing them all on the same footing
Although it may be true that, 11 some instances, it might seem
propel to give the debtor aught of preteience amonb his ere
htors yet it cannot be denied that t! is right has been so much
abused and has been a cover for so much fiaud, that the evil
oveibalances the good Eveiy piactieal man has observed
strong cases illustrative of this ract A man of business with,
perhaps, a large amount of piopeity in his hands and appear-
ing to the world to be rich, has around him Ins confidential
friends and creditors, who know that, mfact he is in faihnjf
circumstances but keep it concealed—he all the time assuring:
them that they shall not suftei, that they shall be preferred
strangers are all the while giving him credit and trusting him
largely on the fanh of what appears to them lo be wealth All
at once It is announced that he is broken, and lhat Ins entire pro-
pel ty is conveyed to these his confidential friends AH othei
creditors are exel udod This is a case that often happens, and,
under our present system, will olten happen hereaf er
Now, sn, this bill proposes to change this, and not to allow
Ihlsprefcience Itnlacesall ciednors on the same footing, and
makes all iqual snfleiers in the failure I his is m aecoid
anee with ihe principle^ot equal justice, and will i 0 murhgoi I
Again it will have a fine effect in restia mnsr excesivo cíe

This is a singulai and astounding fact, and is auubuled, by ihe
