HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,June 23.

Flag-Officer GOLDSBOROUGH,

Commanding Naval Station, Fort Monroe:

Quite a number of vessels loaded with provisions and forage will leave the Pamunkey River within a day or two for James River. The general commanding desires that these vessels be convoyed up the James, and be placed in charge of the gunboats now in that river near City Point or at some secure place near there.

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,Camp Lincoln, June 25, 1862.

Flag-Officer GOLDSBOROUGH, Norfolk:

The general is now in front, where a sharp fight is going on, or I should submit your telegram to him to be answered.

Brigadier-General.
