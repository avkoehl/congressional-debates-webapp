CAMP HAGAR,

Three Miles from Paintsville, Johnson Co., Ky., Jan. 3, 1862.

GENERAL: I am yet in camp at the same point form which my last was dated, but in much closer proximity to the enemy. I suppose that I shall certainly be engaged to-day or to-morrow, for if he does not, I will. The force in front of me numbers some 4,000 and nearly as I can ascertain it, and I have had their encampments inspected. They have Garfield's Ohio regiment, from Mansfield, Ohio, which is 1,000 strong; it passed Catlettsburg 1,020 strong; a regiment from Parkersburg, Va., Laban T. Moore's Kentucky regiment, and Lindsey's Kentucky regiment, as nearly as I can learn the commanders, McLaughlin's Ohio cavalry, 200 strong, and what artillery I* cannot learn. they have entrenched at Peach Orchard, 17 miles below this place, but Garfield and Moore and their cavalry have advanced to Sycamore Creek, which is 7 miles from Paintsville. Their reserve was expected to come up last night and I suppose they will advance to-day on Paintsville. If they do not, I will made a close reconnaissance in force of them to-morrow myself. I would await them in position (for I, too, have entrenched), but there is a heavy force advanced from Mount Sterling, which approaches me on the other side, consisting of Cranor's Ohio regiment, 750 strong (as it passed Paris), and another regiment, supposed to be Mundy's Kentucky regiment, with 500 cavalry and a battery; say, in all, 2,500 men. I must retreat or fight them before they combine, and I prefer latter.

Since my last, Colonel Moore has arrived with about 330 men. He did not receive my order of arrest, and as he had actually come up I determined to try him again, and so pretermitted the arrest altogether. Colonel Stuart's [regiment] is still at Abingdon - himself sick at Richmond - the regiment having only about 200 fit for duty, and these trifling with the question of transportation. I have sent the most positive orders for them to march with such transportation. I have sent the most positive order for them to march with such transportation. I have sent the most positive orders for them to march with such transportation as they can get, but to march at once, and they have received the like order direct from the Department of War, "to march what they have, if it is but ten."

I have no forms upon which to make up the monthly brigade report and have just called on my adjutant-general for it. I hope to forward it by the next courier, and shall then be able, I hope, to report my condition after a fight, as I now do, in abstract, before it

But these are not all fit for duty; measles and mumps have played sad work among the men. The field report of yesterday shows noncommissioned officers and men present and fit for duty
