CHARLESTON, S. C., February 13, 1864.

Major General D. H. MAURY,

Commanding, &amp;c., Mobile, Ala.:

If enemy from Vicksburg burns bridges in his rear his objective point is Pascagoula, to open communications with Gulf and New Orleans, thence attack Mobile. Cannot you intercept his line of operations to delay him into starvation or surrender. I earnestly believe the expedition from Jacksonville, Fla., was intended for Tallahassee and Saint Mark's, to open communications thence with Gulf and New Orleans, but Finegan's success at Lake City defeated the plan.

G. T. BEAUREGARD.

RICHMOND, VA., February 14, 1864.

General BEAUREGARD:

Could you in your judgment be spared from your command to proceed to Mobile and take charge of its defense?

JAS. A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War.

CHARLESTON, February 14, 1864.

Honorable JAMES A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War:

Am honored by your dispatch of the 14th instant. Am ready to obey promptly all orders. The siege of Charleston is suspended, doubtless, but safety of place only secured, with present means, by constant vigilance. My task is not yet over. I was about to submit a plan to free outer harbor from enemy's fleet, and possibly recapture Morris Island. Further, the enemy must be dislodged from Baldwin, Fla., which I hope to do by careful use of my resources. could I not go temporarily to inspect and advise with officer in command at Mobile? At this late day to assume command voluntarily of its defenses is no little responsibility, and one which I dare not take.

G. T. BEAUREGARD.
