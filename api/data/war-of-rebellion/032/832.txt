HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE FRONTIER,Camp at Rhea's Mills, Ark., December 14, 1862.

Major General SAMUEL R. CURTIS,

Commanding Department of the Missouri:

GENERAL: It is not advisable to remove the wounded from Fayetteville.

In about one week more I shall have eaten up all the forage west of the Telegraph road and north of the mountains for 50 miles. There is considerable forage east of the Wire road, in the valley of the White River. There is no forage between the mountains and the Arkansas River; neither is there any south of the river, within 50 miles of Van Buren. Hindman cannot remain long at Fort Smith, unless he obtains his supplies and forage by water up the river.

This army has accomplished all it can, except to hold the country north of the mountains, while we can obtain forage, until some movement is made upon Little Rock, and the Arkansas River opened and made the base of our operations.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

JAS. G. BLUNT,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

WASHINGTON, D. C., December 15, 1862.
