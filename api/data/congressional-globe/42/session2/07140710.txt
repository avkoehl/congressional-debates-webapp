The third section provides that upon the ap-
plication of the party desiring such examina-
tion, such officer shall issue a summons to the
witness designated in the original affidavit,
x-equiring him to appear and testify at the time

original summons, under the hand of the judge
or officer issuing the same; secondly, deliver-
ing to such witness a copy of said summons;
and thirdly, paying or tendering to such wit-
ness the same foes and mileage as are allowed
to witnesses in suits pending in the district
courts of the United States.
Section four provides that after satisfactory
evidence by affidavit shall be given to such
officer that a copy of the order directing such
examination, and of the affidavits upon which
such order was issued, have, been duly and
personally served upon the party to such suit,
if one be pending, or on the persons named
in the original affidavit as having an interest
adverse to the applicant, if no suit be pend-
ing, at least, ten days before the time therein
appointed for such examination if such party
or persons reside in the district, in illicit such
examination is appointed to take place, and at.

mony of the witness would have if given on

direct and cross-interrogatories attached to
such commission, for the same purposes and
to be preserved and used in like manner and
with the same effect as the testimony herein-
before authorized to be taken within the United
States.
Mr. POLAND. This, also, is a bill which
was passed by the House in the last Congress
and was favorably reported by the Judiciary
Committee of the Senate, but failed there for.
want of time. It is to provide a mode of per-
petuating testimony. It is a little singular that,
uivlcr the statutes of the United States, the only
mode, of perpetuating the testimony of wit-
nesses is by a proceeding in chancery, which
all lawyers understand is a somewhat awkward
and expensive pi oceeditig to take the testimony
of witnesses.
I may say that this bill was mainly prepared
by Mr. Ferriss, of New York, who was a mem
ber of the last, Congress, and is founded prin-
cipally upou the provisions cf the statutes of
the State of New York. The provisions of
the statutes of the different States are sub-
stantially the same in relation to the mode of
perpetuating testimony ; and there is nothing
iu th^s bill except what is found in most of the
State statutes authorizing the perpetuation of
testimony.
Mr. ELDIUDGn. The suggestion occurred
to my mind, upon hearing the bill read, that
there sliould be a limitation, that this testi-
mony should not be used against a parson who
