Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

Our agent at Elliott's Mills telegraphs at 2. 35 that General Wallace had arrived there, and was then directing the forwarding of troops from that point to Baltimore. I telegraphed General Wallace at once the importance of communicating the position and condition of his forces for the information of your Department. I trust he has telegraphed directly, as I have yet no response. From conversation with an officer who came up on the troop train which arrived at 5 a. m., I find that all the troops of General Ricketts were discharged from these cars, and were placed in position as the rear guard of General Wallace's column. Their place upon the cars, in addition to the wounded, was filled with stragglers, and those who had been engaged with the enemy. The troops, therefore, which were thus added to the defense of Baltimore are not of the character heretofore reported. General Wallace has just ordered ammunition for artillery to Elliott's Mills, which Colonel Woolley states will speedily be sent to our station, where a train awaits it.

J. W. GARRETT.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

The agent at Parkersburg reports that 1,200 troops were shipped yesterday, the 9th, closing General Sullivan's command. He states that General Crook's command is on the way to Parkersburg, and that the last shipments of this force were made from Charleston yesterday. Also 1,600 cavalry were expected to arrive during last night, and that he had made arrangements to commence loading them at daylight this a. m. Our engineer at Back Creek reports that the officers in command advised a cessation of work upon the reconstruction of that bridge, and adds that military appearances there were yesterday unfavorable.

J. W. GARRETT,

President.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

We have a greatly improved report of the position of General Hunter, having just received the following dispatch from General Kelley:

CUMBERLAND, July 10, 1864.

General Sullivan's advance entered Martinsburg to-day. Took many prisoners and much material. He will occupy it to-morrow with his division. Sullivan commands the advance of General Hunter's forces. I have ordered Mr. Porter to push the repairs at Back Creek bridge as rapidly as possible.

J. W. GARRETT.
