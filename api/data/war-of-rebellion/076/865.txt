I have also to report that the corps under command of Lieutenant-Generals Hardee and Hood are supplied this morning with 80 rounds to each arm.

The Army of Mississippi requires 50,000 cartridges, caliber .57; 34,000 cartridges, caliber .54. It will be supplied as soon as the wagons will arrive, except 17,000, caliber .57.

To-day all supplies for field guns will be issued from the cars at this place. I shall go to-night to Atlanta and return with new supplies without delay.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. OLADOWSKI,

Lieutenant-Colonel.

General BRAXTON BRAGG,

Richmond:

In consequence of the enemy's advance toward the river below our left we this morning took this position, which is slightly intrenched. A division of cavalry on the southeast side of the river is guarding the ferries below. The gallant Brigadier-General Vaughan lost his left foot yesterday by a shell. We greatly need the general officers used for.
