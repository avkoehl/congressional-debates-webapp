cavalry at that point. As I have been unable to hear anything of the cavalry of Ramseur I apprehend a demonstration upon our flanks or some other points in West Virginia. I have sent some good scouts upon that flank, and have requested Major-General Kelley, at Cumberland, to send scouts to Romney and Moorefield. I hardly think the enemy have any business upon your eastern flank at present. I shall be glad to be informed of any news or movements. My pickets are undisturbed at Martinsburg and other points southwest of that place. I have three parties to ascertain as exactly as possible the force of the enemy in the Valley, and gain some indications of his designs.

Respectfully, &amp;c.,

WM. W. AVERELL.

Brigadier-General.
