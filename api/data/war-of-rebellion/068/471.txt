Major ECKERT:

Just from City Point. Major-General Butler thinks it unsafe to run line south sides river from Jamestown yes; can't protect it. May have to start one from City Point. Will see Butler to-morrow and decide, if possible; also arrange regular dispatch boats from Butler's headquarters to Jamestown office. I left 3.30 p. m. We occupy City Point, both sides of Appomattox, also for some distance up it. Butler thought Petersburg might be evacuated. Will let you hear from me to-morrow. Hurry that battery and wire along.

G. D. SHELDON.
