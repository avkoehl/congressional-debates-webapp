1858.
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE;
2431
ciency this year, because deficiency bills never j
decrease.
Now, this sum of 199,000,009 does not include j
any of the following; items of expenditure, and I !
wish gentlemen to add those, upon their own es- '<
timate, to this aggregate: For protecting works
commenced on our numerous rivers and harbors,
the lowest estimate of which is ,500,000; and ,
then there is your Calendar of one thousand pri- !
vate bills demanding your attention. There is the 1
pension bill forthe old soldiers of the war of 1812,
proposed by the gentleman from Tennessee, [Mr.
Savage,] requiring$8,000,000per annum. There
are the ten new war-steamers, proposed by my
friend from Virginia, [Mr. Bocock,] $2,500,000.
The French spoliation bill, urged so forcibly by
the gentleman from Massachusetts, [Mr. Davis,]
which, if passed, will require $5,000,000. The
duties to be refunded on goods destroyed by fire,
I do not know how much. Commutation to the
heirs of revolutionary soldiers, I do not know how
much. Claims growing out of Indian wars m
Oregon and Washington, urged by the Delegate
from Oregon, and certified by an executive officer,
§5,000,000. Then we have the Pacific railroad,
a foretaste of the cost of which we have had in
$1,000,000 expendedalready m the publication of
the report of the surveys.
Now, I have shown that in nil human proba-
bility the expenditures of this Government will
be from ninety to one hundred million dollars.
To meet this, the Secretary, in his recent letter,
estimates the receipts for the first two quarters
at $25,000,000. We know, from comparison with
former years, that the receipts for the last two
quarters will not exceed the fir&t, making the ag-
gregate of receipts §50,000,000, or a deficiency of
over forty million dollars for next year.
And yet, sir, for this alarming condition of the
puhhe finances, the Administration has no meas-
ure of lelief except loan bills, and paper money,
in the form of Treasury notes. No provision is
made for their payment; no measures of retrench-
ment and reform; but these accumulated difficul-
ties are thrust upon the future, with the improvi-
dence of a young spendthrift. While the Secre-
tary is waiting to foresee contingencies, we are
prevented by a party majority from instituting
reform. If wc indicate even the commencement
of retrenchment, or point out abuses, on tins side
of the House, we areat once assail* d by members
of the Committee of Ways and Means.
The only effort at retrenchment winch I have
seen he re successful, was that made by the gen-
tleman from Kentucky, [Mr. Mason,] in redu-
cing the number of officers employed about this
Hall.
That the Committee of Ways and Means have
no purpose of commencing a reform, we have
ample evidence m the appropriation bills before
us. I have a table here showing that at the pres-
ent session of Congress, its chairman hasjntro-
duced appropiiation bills, prior to the 12th of
May, amounting to more than sixty-nine mil-
lion dollars, as follows:
appropriation bilh repotted to the TToutpnf Rsprcicntaf ices
by the Co rmnittce oj Jl'tusanl Mean-,. jh st iesito/t Thir-
ty-Fifth Congress, prior'tj 12//: oj May:
ing committees, and we are told that other bills
are yet to be reported fiom the Ways and Means
Committee. Wc know, by sure experience, that
these appropriation bills are never diminished;
they arc increased in this House; they are sent to
the Senate, and there they are overloaded with
items already rejected by the House. Nor does
this table include a class of expenditures much
more deserving public favor than many of the bills
reported. The rivers and harbors of the West
in vain demand improvement. While millions
are expended in your coast surveys and Atlantic
defenses, you scruple over a comparatively small
sum, absolutely necessary to keep from destruc-
tion improvements already commenced in the lake
harbors.
If, while gentlemen are lavish in the public
money, they would vote $1,500,000 to the protec-
tion of the commerce of the great and growing
power in the North west, it would show some kind
of justice and liberality, liut, sir, the region of
country which will in a short time control thedes-
tinies of this nation; which now, in its almostin-
fancy, feeds your atusans and sailors, and in
time of war furnishes sturdy defenders of your
national honor, has appealed in vain for ordinary
repairs of their harbors, because (for T can see no
other reason) they are not upon the Atlantic coast.
Time will soon cure this evil; and we who come
from the West will have the power to legislate
for ourselves, as the Atlantic and Gulf coast has
done in times past.
1 desire now to call the attention of the House
to a comparison of expenditures of this yrat,and
of this Administration, with past expenditures.
I have a table, carefully prepared from official
documents, (Ex. Docs. Nos. 13 and CO,) as fol-
lows:

Government, and of the late Administration. Con-
trast the history, progress, and growth of our
country; contrast its purity, its prosperity, its
greatness,during the administration of JeiFerson,
of Washington, of Madison, and of Adams, with
that of Pierce, and then you may be able to ap-
preciate the rapid growth of our expenditures
from the simple fact that four years of modern
Democratic administration cost more than twenty-
six years in the earlier and purer days of the Re-
public. 1 have here the official tabl$ showing that
fact:

This table does not include permanent appro-
priations, amounting for this fiscal year to the sum
of $7,436,532, nor does it include a multitude of
bills appropriating money from all the other stand-
It thus appeals that from the foundation of
our Government, on the 4th of March, 1789, to
December 31,1791, nearly three years, the aggre-
gate expenses of tins G-overiimont, exclusive of
the public debt, were ^1,919,589. For the next fis-
cal year probably a better basis for estimate—it
was $1,877,903. Our population was then three
million nine hundred and twenty-nine thousand,
being less than fifty cents to eneh inhabitant. Our
expenses have now increased to *,83,000,000 this
year, and $93,000,000 next year, making an aver-
age of thrc° dollars to eacii inhabitant. In 1830,
in General Jackson's time, the expenditures weie
$13,000,000, and the population was neailyas
many millions. The amount to each inhabi:aut
v/asp 03. In 1810 it amounted to ^1 40toeadt
inhabitant. But now it is >3 00 to each inhabit-
ant, or $30 00 to every free family, upon the basis
of the census of 1850 showing the number of fam-
ilies to be three million three hundred and sixty-
two thousand three hundred and thirty-seven, or
$03 00 to every voter of the four million fifty-
four thousand four hundred and fifty at the ['res-
idential election of 1836. While the population
has increased sevenfold, the expenditure has in-
creased, up to 1S57, thirty-six fold,and up to this
year, forty-eight fold.
The aggregate expense of Mr. Pierce's admm-
istiatimi, exclusive of payments on the public
debt, was £232,8120,032. The aggregate expense
of the Government,from its foundation up to the
close of the last war, and prior to January 1, 1815,
exclusive of payments on the public debt, was
£172.097,779; so" that the expenses of the aimless,
fruitless, mischievous, ad ministration ofPresident
Pierce, were $60,000,000 more than the entire ex-
penses of the Government up to the close of the
last war. Sir, institute a comparison between the
results of the first twenty-six years of our national
$232.8)0,632 35
The expenses of this year, the first under Mr.
Buchanan's administration, will be $5,000,000
more than the entire expenses of the Government
from its foundation to the close of Jelferson's ad-
ministration. The aggregate expenses for the
first twenty yeais of our Government were
S>78,3G3,7G2-, and 1 have already shown that, this
year, the expenses exceed $83,000,000.
Sir, your deficiency bill thu year amounts to
more than the average expenses of the Govern-
ment for the first forty years of its existence.
Your miscellaneous bill amounts to more than the
aggregate expenses of the Government in any
year,"except tie' years of the war, prior to 1830.
We appropriated $18,940,189 for miscellaneous
purposes; and yet, if you look at the table you
will find that the asm egatc expenses of the Gen-
eral Government, exclusive of the public, debt, are
much less than that for every year except during
the period of the last war with Great Britain.
1 have another tnble here, carrying out the com-
parison instituted by the gentleman from Alabama
[Mr. Curry] the other day, in his very able
speech, to which 1 listened with great pleasure.
It contrasts expenditures of the Government m
ib40 and those of 1857:

Bv this it is shown, that, in the year 18-10, the
civil" list amounted to $2,736,709 31, and in 1857
to $7,011,547 27. I find that the miscellaneous
exnendituies—an endless cofJcciion of joh<j and
contracts—run up from $>2,500,000 to ^19,000,000.
I find that the expenduuiesfor the military servicc
run up from $>7,000,000 in 1840, to ^19.000,000 in
1857, and to $20,000,000 this year. The naval
expenditures of the Government run up rrom
$6,000,000 to over twelve million dollars, and for
next year, over thirteen millions, exclusive of
fortifications and the ten new sloops-of-war
