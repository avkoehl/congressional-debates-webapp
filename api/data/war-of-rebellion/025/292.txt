JACKSON, TENN., October 25, 1862.

General HAMILTON:

I was aware of the destruction of the railroad for a considerable distance south of Rienzi. If practicable, it should be destroyed south of Tupelo. By moving on the small force at that point they will be likely to destroy the road south themselves, as well as the stores they have there. My information is that the enemy have but a small force at Tupelo.

General C. S. HAMILTON, Corinth, Miss.:

General Quinby will probably be in Corinth to-morrow, and General Dodge as soon as relieved by General Davies.

Can't you get up an expedition to go down the railroad and destroy it far to the south? If done, the cavalry should go in force to Tupelo or farther south, supported by a division of infantry as far down as Guntown or that vicinity.

U. S. GRANT.

JACKSON, October 25, 1862.

General C. S. HAMILTON, Corinth, Miss.:

Make your preparations and execute the suggestions made in my former dispatch as rapidly as possible.

U. S. GRANT.

CORINTH, October 25, 1862.

General GRANT, Jackson:

It is believed here that Price has been largely re-enforced from Texas and Arkansas. There are indications that he is moving this way. Deserters say he is going to attack Corinth. I have large cavalry force to scout to the west. Am pushing the fortifications as fast as possible.

C. S. HAMILTON,

Brigadier-General.
