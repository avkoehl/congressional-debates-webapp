Mr MEDILL, who had the floor, resumed hts remarks in
support of the report ol the committee of elections and having
concluded before the extmation of the morning hour—
Mr FILLMORE rose to address the House in reply
Mr BELL rose and said that as the morning hour had nearly

Mr FILLMORE said he was perfectly satisfied to eive way
to the gentleman, provided that there was an understanding that
he could have the floor to morrow
Mr CUSHING said he could not consent to any arrange
ment which would protract a discussion that had alreadv lasted
too long II the gentleman from New York wished to speak,
he desired that he should go on and enable the subject to be dis-
posed of. He thought that some of the other Slates besides
the State of New Jersey, should be heard on that floor, on
suhjectsof interest to them.
Mr UNDERWOOD inquired if the gentleman had not al
ready spoken twice on this subject; and whether he was not
entitled to the floor
Mr CUSHING said it was evident that, if this discussion and
recrimination was to ho on, it would consume the morning hour
fo- months, and would be extended ad infinitum

gave way,

HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVE*.
Thursday, April A 1S40
The SPEAKER announced th it the first business in order
was ihe report ol the Select Committee on Punting
Mi FILLMO iE inquired if he had not the floor on the New
Jersey case.
The SPEAKER replied that the repon of the select commit-
tee wa< tlie special older
Mr R GARLAND (one of the committee) said that he d d
not see the ch irman in his place and he could not say what his
views were on thP subject of taking up ihe report (o dav The
documents were not yet punted, and it would be impossible 'o
go on and make the ne. essary expían itions without them He
could not tell when these documents would come (rom tl e
printer, and he did not like to assisrn aday foi the considera ! n
of this xnbi ct, under the circumstances he bad adverted to
Mr FISHER said he understood that the parsers had only
been sent down to the printer yesterday
Mr R GARLAND said, if the House would only pass over
the bi siness informally, by general consent, till the chairman
came in, they could then ascertain from him how the printmgof
the documents was piogiessing
Mr BLACK (chairman of the committee) cou'd only say
that the report he had had the honor to submit to ihe House,
was given to the printer as soon as he made it lo the House,
but that the documents connected with it eompnsing a laiae
body of testimony, was not jiven to him till yesteiday Wheie-
fore, he could not say, but the prinrr, of couise, was imtto
blame for the delay There was a con-adei able volume of tes
timony, which the commute wasfora lung tune engaged in,
preparing, and perhaps it took the eleik of the committee some
time to anange the documents for the press He hoped the
House would not ob|ect to givinga little more time to the print
er to execute the work
Mr WISE suggested to the chairman to name a day for the
consideration of Ihe report when the printing might be expect-
ed to bebroueht in—say Tuesday next.
Mr BLACK was not in correspondence with the punter, and
could not tell more than any other member when tliewoik
would be done.
Mr ADAMS informed the gentleman from Virginia that
Tuesday next was assigned for the consideiation of the lull re
poned by the Committee on Manufactures to prove it frauds on
the revenue.
Mr. WISE then named Wednesday next, to which Mr Black
assented
Mr R GARLAND inquired of the chairman of ihe commit-
tee whether he was prep ired to report on th it blanch of the
subject committed to them which related to the teparmon of
the public printing from the political press Ii was desirabl ,
he said, to have the whole subiect referred to the committee,
considered at the same time by the House
Mr BLACK replied, that if the report was ready, the print
ine would not be ready He would, however, say that the
branch of the sub|ect to which the gen'leman referred, had not
been definitely acted on bv the corrtmi'tee The committee, it
was true had decided against the proposition, and had directed
him to make a report to thit effect, but he had not yet had mm,
to do it, unless he laid aside all other business to aticnd to this
Mr GARLAND said that it was desirable that the House
should have both the sub|ectsreferied to the committee, before
it at the same time, an! he thought the chairman might, without
rruci inconvenience, enable the House to do so The com.
mil ee, on Wednesday last, decided against the proposition as
unconstitutionaVand highly inexpedient, and directed the coin
mittee to make a report lo that effect He hoped, therefore,
that the genlli man would be ready with his report by Wednes-
day next He had prepared the minority repoit, and would be
ready to present it any time
Mr 11LAI K did n t think it necessaiy thai the two subjects
should be considered bv the House at the same time Nay, he
thought it more expedient that they should be considered sepa-
rately. Indeed, it was impracucablp to consider both subjects
together, because the gentleman and his friends had agreed to
recommend to the House that no change with regard to the
niannei and foim of executing the public printing be made
this session, it being the priets only tha< was proposed to be
regulated feuch being the case, why urge the consideration of
that branch of the subject relating to the separation of the pub-
lic printing from the political press, when it had no direct con
neel ion with the olhe> branch, relative to the change of the
puces of the printing, and which ought immediately to be
acted on?
Mi DAVIDS observed that the gentleman from Louisiana had
inhumed the limine thai he was ready, on the part of the mi
nority of tht committee, to report on thesub|ect he was so so
licilous about, and therefoie, il the House was disposed to dis-
( uss it, it could be discussed as well on the report of the mino
ruy as on that ol the majority
Mr ÜROMGOOLE asked what was the question before the
House, and
The SPEAKER replied that it was the proposition to post
pone the further consideration of the report of theSelect Com
mince onPiintingtill Wednesday next.
Mr RUSSELL remaikedihai it was very evident that this
business was not in a state to be acted on now, and that the re
put not having been prepared, it was not probable that it
would be ready for the action of the House so soon as Wednes
day next Foi the purpose, therelore, of giving Ihe chairman
ol the committee time to piepare his report, as well as for the
House to have it printed, he would suggest wlfether it was not
more advisable to postpone the subject to a day more distant
than that named He would name Tuesday week, which would
give the gentleman Horn Georgia ample time to prepare his in-
tended report
Mr R GARLAND opposed the proposition of Mr Russell,
and issigned his reasons lor so doing
Mi RUSSELL understood that the committee had agreed
upon a reduction of (he prices of the public printing, and had
reported on that branch ol ihe subject, but that was not the only
in ttter referred to them They had also been instructed to in
quire and report upon the-expediency ol separating the public
printing from the political press Now, although the major ly
of the committee had decided against that proposition, and had
1 istrucled their chan man to report accordingly to the House, he
had not yet had time todo it But Mr R thoughtthat the latter
was the more important subject of the two, and that nought to
be biought belore the House at the same lime with the other, in
order tint it might be the better enabled to judge how far the
reduction slnuld be cairied 1 ir the put pose of giving ample
time to the chairman to prepare this second report,he had named
Tuesday week for the postponement, and if the gentleman from
Louisiana would consider what the House had to do in the
mi an time, he would perceive that tliey could not well take up
the subj-ct at an eailierday The bill leported by the Com-
mittee on Manufactures had been made (he special order for
Tuesday next, and the consideration of this bill would consume
two or three da\s at least Then the gentleman, he was sure,
would not lnterleie wnh the Fridays and Saturdays set apart
(or puvate lulls, while the Monday following was petition day.
So that thesiibjebtof printing, as he had before observed, could
not well be taken up befoie Tuesday week
Mr GRAVES, alter some renarLs, offered a resolution that
the Select Committee on Punting be required to leport on the
remaining branch of the subject referied to them in the course of
the pr  sent week
Mi BLACK observed that he would have no obicction to that
resolution, weie it not a direct reflection iq on the committee
The committee had, under the instructions of the House, exa-
mine lavastmassofttstiinony'and had found the duties imposed
on them so arduous, that the House had, from time to time, ex
tended Ihe period to which then report was to he made They
had already repotted on one bianch ol the subject committed to
them, the one that they deemed the most urgent, but had not yet
been ible to leport on the other Had they known that the gen-
tleman from Louisiana was so exceedingly anxious for a repoit
on the oilier, they migtt perhaps have given it the preference,
as their decision was made up on it The coinmntee had agreed
that it was inexpedient for the House to adept this last proposi
lion, and they though1 that it would be inconvenient to consider
it in connection wi'h ihe subject reported on.
Mi R GARLAND moved to postpone the further considera-
tion ol the subject till Thursday next.
The question being Alston the most remote period, i e on
Mr Ri'sscll's motion for Tuesday week, on count there were
ayes 64 navs 43, and no quorum having voted,
Mi VANDERPOEL called foi tellers, and Messrs Vander-
piEi. and Kci nolds having t een appointed such, ascertained,
on count, that there were ayes 65, nays G2. So the subject was
postpone I till, and made the special order of the day, for Tues-
day week next
Tne SPEAKER said that the business first in order was ihe
resolution repor'ed from the Committee of Elections by Mr
Campbell, chairman, to have the report of that committee and
all the testimony in lelation to Ihe New Jersey contested election
printed, and the amendment of Mr R Garland thereto to dis-
charge the committee from the furthei consideration of other
testimony.
Mr FILLMORE, who was entitled to the floor, at the request
of Mr Campbell gave way for an explanation
Mr CaMPULLL said that he had been inattentive to the
progress of the debate and when he rose on yesterday to answer
a ques'ion addressed to him, it was under a misapprehension of
what the question was Before he had taken his seat, however,
he understood from ihe gentleman from New York [Mr. Fill-
more] that the question related to the reading of testimony alter
the committee had assembled to take into consideration the re-
solution "I the House, under which the lepert was made To
ihe question thus limited as to time, he answered, that during
thi pendency of a motion in committee, instructing the chair-
man to draw upa report, a member had called for the reading
of the testimony, and that all the papers called for wire reaii
