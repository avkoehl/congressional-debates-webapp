Iuka, but make all your preparations with the utmost caution to guard against a surprise of the command you send.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

E. B. BEAUMONT,

Major and Assistant Adjutant-General.

TULLAHOMA, February 26, 1865.

Major General GEORGE H. THOMAS:

I have information from an officer at McMinnville, in whom I have entire confidence, that Wheeler is on this side of the Tennessee River. His forces are said to be in detached parties to be concentrated at some point for a raid. I received information to the same effect some days since from a Union spy. I think there is sufficient in these reports to make it important that I have more force here soon.

R. H. MILROY,

Major-General.

LOUISVILLE, February 26, 1865.

Brigadier General W. D. WHIPPLE,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

Is Colonel Palmer, Fifteenth Pennsylvania Cavalry, in Nashville? The Eleventh Kentucky Cavalry leaves here to-morrow, and I want it to report to Colonel Palmer on its arrival at Nashville, to which place it goes by rail.

GEORGE STONEMAN,

NASHVILLE, TENN., February 26, 1865.

Major General GEORGE STONEMAN, Louisville:

Major SOUTHARD HOFFMAN,

MAJOR: A deserter who left Hood's army at Montgomery, Ala., on the 16th instant reports that army had all gone to Branchville except one division of Stewart's corps, which was at Mobile. The last division of Cheatham's corps left Selma, Ala., two weeks ago to-day. Lee's and Stewart's corps had left about ten days before. He estimated the entire force at 18,000 to 20,000. He had received a furlough to return when Cheatham's corps train arrives at Augusta, Ga.
