General Ord in his place. It is now open to select a commander for the Tenth Corps. Do you think of any major-general available who you would like to have? Birney and Gibbon are with the Army of the Potomac, only commanding divisions. General Ord will meet you to-day at the Eighteenth Corps headquarters.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

BUTLER'S HEADQUARTERS, July 20, 1864.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

Our signal officer reports that the enemy in some force has just encamped on a hill three miles northwest of the Walthall house. This is, beyond all doubt, a force established as a reserve midway between our line here and Petersburg, and indicates that they are expecting an attack here.

G. WEITZEL,

Brigadier-General.

CITY POINT, July 20, 1864.

General BUTLER:

As it will be several days before the balance of the Nineteenth Corps will arrive it will not be advisable to send any portion of it to Deep Bottom at present. Send none of it over until at least a complete division is here, and when that is sent over withdraw Foster so as to hold your line at Bermuda Hundred perfectly safe. Such portion of the Nineteenth Corps as you have should be encamped, if it is not already, near the line of intrenchments, so as to be ready to take them in case of an attack.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
