Question. State, if you please, whether the
causes pending in the circuit court of the United
States for that district, and so transferred for the
recovery of money, in so far as they were brought
by non-residents of the State of Tennessee and of
the southern confederacy, were altered in any re-
spect upon the record in the confederate court.
Was there a party for use named?

of the plaintiff, it was marked by the receiver for
the use of the confederate States.
Question. I ask you whether the order that the
judgments or the cases should be entered up for
the use of the confederate States of America was
made by the judge?
Answer. Yes, sir.
Question. I ask you whether there were many
of those cases pending in the United States courts
so transferred and so altered in respect of the use
for which the suit was being prosecuted?
Answer. I cannottell exactly; I suppose some
sixty or seventy cases, may be.
Question. Where the judgments were so entered
upon them?
Ansicer. Yes, sir; there was no alteration; it
was just that insertion. There was no alteration
of the record.
Mr. BINGHAM. That is what I mean. He
says there was no alteration, but just the inser-
tion of the words, " for the use of the confederate
States."
Question. Were they so entered up in the judg-
ments for the use of the confederate States?
* Answer. Yes, sir.

and purpose of this, as declared at the time by
the receiver in the court, was not to sequestrate

States of America.
Answer. I presume it was. I do not know cer-
tainly.
Question. Was it not so understood at the time?
Answer. I judge so.
Question. Can you state to the Court about the
aggregate amount in money of those sixty or sev-
enty suits that were thus disposed of by this con-

Answer. No, sir; I cannot come any way near it.
Question. State, if you please, to the Court
whether they covered large sums of money.
Answer. Yes, sir; there were some pretty large
judgments.
3Vir. BINGHAM. I am instructed to repeat a
question which I believe I asked you before, and
which I think you answered; and that is, when
Judge Humphreys held the last term of the dis-
trict court of the United States for the middle dis-
trict of Tennessee? Was it in April, 1861?

them?
Answer. He had not them impannfeled, and of
course he did not charge them.

further to ask the witness.
