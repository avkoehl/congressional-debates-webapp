have forwarded to General Mott and requested that he do all in this power to re-establish the connection with General Warren. I do not consider that the negro troops are fit for such a service, under the circumstances, but should the commanding general desire it I will direct that a portion of these be employed in this service.

Major-General PARKE,

Commanding Ninth Corps:

A dispatch from General Warren, just received, shows that his troops do not occupy the same line as before the fight. He says he will connect his picket-line to-night along the road by Aiken's and straighten up all he can, and if not attacked to-morrow morning will endeavor to re-establish the line of to-day. I sent him your dispatch about his three regiments. Connect your picket-line with his to-night. His troops do not extend to his right farther than the Aiken house unless I misapprehend his dispatch. He does not consider it practicable or desirable to connect his troops with yours to-night and intrench them there.
