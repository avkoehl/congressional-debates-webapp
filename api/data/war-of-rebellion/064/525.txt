HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF NORTH MISSOURI,Saint Joseph, Mo., June 23, 1864.

Colonel J. T. K. HAYWARD,

Hannibal, Mo.:

I am in receipt of your letter of the 22nd instant. You may be assured that Captain Crandall's policy, so far as I know anything about it, meets my entire approval. I have not censured him in the least. Tell him to go ahead. He must expect the snakes will hiss when they are stirred up. I am quite sure that I have no better officer in the district than Captain Crandall. When complaints are made against him they will be placed before the captain, that he may better understand who may be flanking him. Tell Captain Crandall to kill every bushwhacker he can put his hands upon, and to make the feeders, aiders, and abettors of the villains sorry for what they have done to help on the iniquity. Let the best of discipline be continued among the troops, and when they strike, let it be with such force and vengeance that their presence ca be felt all along the lines. "No gloves on now." Forward the railway brigade.

CLINTON B. FISK,

Brigadier-General.

DISTRICT PROVOST-MARSHAL:

A body of rebels, 50 in number, were seen 3 miles north of town, late this evening, going toward Paris. They were dressed in citizens' clothes and armed with shotguns and rifles. Have had reliable information that the town will be attacked to-night. Will give the best we have got.

DISTRICT PROVOST-MARSHAL:

I have reliable information that this place is to be attacked to-night or to-morrow. I must have re-enforcements of at least 50 to 100 men. Send 1,000 cartridges, caliber .58. This is not doubtful. Send some from Macon City by special train.
