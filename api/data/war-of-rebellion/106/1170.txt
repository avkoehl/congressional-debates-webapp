BRIGADE HEADQUARTERS, DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA,

Sacramento, March 23, 1865.

Captain J. M. ROPES,

Second California Cavalry, Camp Union:

CAPTAIN: I am instructed by the general commanding to say that the design in ordering you to Camp Babbitt was to cover the real movement in view, which is to capture the men Rudd and his whole party and bring them to this place. The inclosed copies will give you an insight into the whole affair. You will hold the idea that you are going to that post for the purpose of operating against Indians in Owen's River Valley. When in Mariposa County, say at Hornitos, you can halt to recruit your horses, get forage, &amp;c. At this point you are only a few miles from your destination, and with the aid of the deputy provost-marshal, whom Captain Robinson has instructed in this matter, you can work secretly for the capture of these parties, particularly Rudd and R. S. P. The seizures should be made suddenly, at the same time getting possession of all their papers, which may lead to future developments. Take with you concealed a dozen pairs of handcuffs. If the success of the enterprise is possible, everything will depend upon your skillful management of the details.

Respectfully,

E. D. WAITE,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
