THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

tically the same. Then again, in using vessels
for defensive purposes, we have no guarantee
that the gnus mounted upon them will be any
larger or heavier than those which may be
brought to bear against them.
But, sir, in case of a war with some great
naval Power, the iron-clads we now have on
hand would scarcely be worth taking into ac-
count in the arrangement of a system of coast
defenses. I submit herewith to the House a
list of our iron-clad ships of the Navy, accom-
panied by certain statistical information con-
cerning them, to which I invite the attention
of every member feeling an interest in the
subject;
Statement of the member and character of the iron- clad vessels belonging to the ITavyi what they have cost, by whom designed, tolio recommended

* These iron-nbd vessels are all of the monitor class, which was adopted by a board of officers appointed by Congress, and all these vessels are of the same character,
f Altered from a sailing frigate designed by the Bureau of Construction.
.! Average cost per gun of finished sea-going monitors, $336,324.
[Executive Document No. 72. United States Senate, Forty-First Congress, second session.]
From this statement it will be seen that the
average cost per gun of the iron-clads for ser-
vice upon the sea or on salt water is $289,899.
It will be further seen, by looking over the list
of these vessels, and noting those which are
designated as fitted for sea, that is to say, such
as are safe to venture outside of a harbor in,
that they have cost $336,324 per gun. In
neither of these sums is the cost of the gun
itself or its carriage or any part of the arma-
ment included, but only the hull and engines
of the vessels respectively. From this tabular
statement it will be also seen that the total
cost of the iron-clad vessels now in the Navy is
$35,371,061 11. This I amassured does not in-
clude condemned vessels thrown aside as worth-
less, nor iron-clads heretofore sold much below
their cost, amounting perhaps to many millions
more. All these salt-water vessels3 too, are only
capable of carrying one hundred and twenty-
one guns, according to this same tabular state-
ment, which has been prepared with great care,
and which I have reason to believe is at least
substantially correct.
Of these one hundred and twenty-one guns
now upon or belonging to these vessels none
are equal either in weight or efficiency to those
