Numbers 1. Report of Major General Henry W. Halleck, General-in-Chief, U. S. Army.
HEADQUARTERS OF THE ARMY,Washington, D. C., November 15, 1863.

SIR: In compliance with your orders, I submit the following summary of military operations since my last annual report:

* * *

DEPARTMENT OF WEST VIRGINIA AND ARMY OF THE POTOMAC.

* * *

A considerable part of Lee's army was now withdrawn* to re-enforce Bragg in the West. But with his diminished numbers he assumed a threatening attitude against Meade; maneuvered to turn his flank, and forced him to fall back to the line of Bull Run. Having destroyed the Orange and Alexandria Railroad from the Rapidan to Manassas, the rebels again fell back to their former position near Orange Court-House.

During these operations there were several severe engagements between detached forces, but no general battle: October 10 and 11, at Robertson's River; 12th, at Brandy Station; 14th, at Bristoe Station; 19th, at Buckland Mills; 24th, at Bealeton and the Rappahannock Bridge; and the 7th of November, on the south [north] bank of that river.

Our loss at Bristoe Station was 51 killed and 329 wounded.+ We captured 5 cannon, 2 colors, and 450 prisoners. In the several skirmishes between the 9th and 23rd of October the casualties in our Cavalry Corps were 74 killed, 316 wounded, and 885 missing. The enemy's loss is not known, but must have been heavy, as we captured many prisoners.

While Lee was threatening Meade's army by Warrenton and Thoroughfare Gap, Imboden descended the valley of the Shenandoah and surprised a small garrison at Charlestown, capturing three or four hundred prisoners. Troops sent out from Harper's Ferry forced him to immediately retreat.

On the 7th of November, Generals Sedwick and French attacked the enemy at Rappahannock Station and Kelly's Ford, capturing several redoubts, 4 guns, 8 battle-flags, and about 2,000 prisoners. Our loss in killed and wounded was 370.+ The enemy now retreated to his old position south of the Rapidan.

The operations of our troops in West Virginia are referred to here as being intimately connected with those of the Army of the Potomac. The force being too small to attempt any important campaign by itself, has called mostly upon the defensive in repelling raids and breaking up guerrilla bands.
