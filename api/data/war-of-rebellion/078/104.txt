Brigadier General S. S. FRY:

It is reported, via Cincinnati and Louisville, that Burbridge came up with Morgan this morning near Cynthiana, and after an hour's fight completely broke him up. Am expecting news from General Burbridge by courier.

CAMP NELSON, June 12, 1864.

Captain DICKSON:

A dispatch just from Danville says: Provost-Marshal Cardwell of Mercer County, at Harrodsburg, reports that his scouts saw rebel pickets at Lawrenceburg, Anderson County, to-day, who say they have 300 men under Jack Allen. Have you any information of any rebels being in that section? This is the first intimation I have had of their being in that direction. I shall send out and ascertain, if I can, the truth and report, unless you have definite information on the subject. Please answer.

S. S. FRY,

Brigadier-General.

JUNE 12, 1864-9. 15 p. m.

Brigadier General S. S. FRY:

Jack Allen's force has been driven from Frankfort. I think your information correct - his being at Lawrenceburg. General Burbridge gained a complete victory over Morgan, at Cynthiana, this morning. Three hundred of Morgan's men, under Giltner, all making toward Lawrenceburg. I have traced them through Versailles. These last are demoralized. I have directed Weatherford, at Lebanon, to be on watch for them, and have informed General Ewing they may strike across this way or near Camp Nelson.

J. BATES DICKSON,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

Remain at Lebanon and watch the country well. Send me any information you may get. Do not press horses unless compelled to. If unavoidable, you are authorized to press them, giving proper vouchers.

By order of Brigadier-General Burbridge:

J. BATES DICKSON,

Captain and Assistant Adjutant-General.
