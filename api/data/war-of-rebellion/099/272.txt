209.] BELLAIRE, January 28, 1865.

Captain J. B. FORD,

Wheeling, Va.:

The batteries won't be able to start before to-morrow, and perhaps not until Monday morning, owing to causes officers will explain. I hope they will be duly cared for, and go as soon as consistent. I shall want all the stoves, army and all others, to put in cars, as I cannot think it right to send off troops without them.

LEWIS B. PARSONS,

Colonel and Chief of Rail and River Transportation.

210.] GRAFTON, January 27, 1865-10 a. m.

Colonel LEWIS B. PARSONS,

Bellaire:

The trains are running very well. There is some complaining of the cold, and if the weather continues as it is I fear there will be more. I think it will be best, unless the weather moderates, to order the Sibley stoves from Wheeling.

D. N. COUCH,

Major-General.

(On passenger train bound east from Wheeling.)

Yesterday noon your two dispatches received. I had already ordered stoves adn fuel for all cars. There is a great delay on the Ohio Central. Only two trains arrived since you left. They are off the track again west of Zanesville. I shan't get away before Monday. Please answer.
