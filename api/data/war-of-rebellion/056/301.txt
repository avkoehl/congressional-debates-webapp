CORINTH, December 1, 1863.

Major-General HURLBUT:

I have sent a scout both to Jacinto and Kossuth. I shall learn by morning if there is any move east of this post from the south, and will report. If I have to rely on Dodge for relief, I shall depend I fear on a broken reed. He is 100 miles off, and I have no communication with him. I shall, however, send him a dispatch in my hour of necessity.

Major-General HURLBURT,

Memphis:

Your dispatch indicates that the movement of General Tuttle is to be by march. I suggest that rail is the certain and sure means.

Trains out from Memphis can push him through to Pocahontas or this place by 3 a. m. if they are started instanter. If he has to march the enemy will certainly be between him and any position of his command beyond Middleton before he can reach there. His only chance to cross the Hatchie is at Pocahontas; Of course his troops must not consume time by bringing camp and regiment equipage or rations, only arms and ammunition. I can feed them all for a month.

HEADQUARTERS SIXTEENTH ARMY CORPS,Memphis, Tennessee, December 1, 1863-12 m.

Brigadier-General STEVENSON,

Corinth:

Tuttle has three batteries and four regiments. Five trains are out on the road somewhere.

I have not engines and cars enough to take his force, and in selfdefense he must march. Hatch's cavalry is at La Grange, and he will be strong enough and in time enough to reach Pocahontas. Geddes can concentrate 1,100 men at Pocahontas, and will hold it against their cavalry column. Engines can take them on from Pocahontas if required at Corinth.
