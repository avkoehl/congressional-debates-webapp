GENERAL: This will be handed you by Lieutenant Gordon, of the Texas Rangers, to whose gallantry we are indebted for the prisoners. He has in charge the prisoners, with orders to turn them over to the proper person in Murfreesborough. The enemy are threatening to visit us to-morrow. We annoy them so much that they now forage in very heavy force. Please direct me where I shall send deserters for trail; some one must be shot from this command, and that speedily.

Most respectfully, general, your obedient servant,
