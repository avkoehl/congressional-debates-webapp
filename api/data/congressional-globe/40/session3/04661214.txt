as would be incurred for a like offense on the
trial of a suit. Every witness appearing and
testifying under the act is to be entitled to re-
ceive from the party at whose instance he has
been summoned the fees now provided by law
for each day he shall give attendance.
Mr. WILLEY. Mr. President, I desire to
make a suggestion to the Senator from Massa-
chusetts, who has this bill in charge, as to the
twelfth line of the first section. Is it neces-
sary to absolutely require proof to be made to
the officer? Would not the mere affidavit of
the party himself be prima facie cause to
justify the issuing of the summons?
Mr. SUMNER. In this bill the committee
has followed a bill for a similar purpose in the
State of New York, which has been found to
work well there.
The bill was reported to the Senate as
amended; and the amendment was concurred
in.
The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a
third reading, was read the third time, and
passed.
The title of the bill was amended by striking
out.the word "and" after "United States,"
and inserting " or so as to read :
A bill to provide for tho execution in the District
of Columbia of commissions issued by the courts
of the States and Territories of the United States or
of foreign nations, and for taking depositions to be
used in such courts.

am instructed by the Committee on the District
of Columbia, to whom was referred the bill

ment; and I move that it be now considered.
The motion was agreed to ; and the Senate,
as in Committee of the Whole, proceeded to

UNIOMTOT7N AND WASHINGTON RAILROAD.
Mr. HARLAN. I move that the Senate
take up the bill (S. No. 532) to incorporate the

ning thence across the bridge known as the

outs from the bridge to the foot of Eleventh

time be amended or repealed by Congress.
Mr. SUMNER. I will inquire if those words
are not already in the bill?
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Such a pro-
vision is already in the bill.
Mr. EDMUNDS. Let us hear it read. I
want to be sure about that.

lows:

at any time be altered or repealed by the Congress

Mr. SUMNER. I think that section had
better be transferred to the end of the bill.
Mr. HARLAN. I withdraw the amendment
that I offered. It is suggested to me that sec-
tion seven, the one just read, had better come
in at the end of the bill, and the sections can
be numbered to correspond.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. That will
be done if no objection is made.
The bill, as amended, was reported to the
Senate, and the amendments were concurred

ARCHING Of TIBER CREEK.
Mr. HAItLAN. I move that the Senate
proceed to the consideration of Senate bill No.
808.
The motion was agreed to; and the bill (S.
No. 808) to arch Tiber creek north of Penn-
sylvania avenue was read the second time, and
considered as in Committee of the Whole. The
bill proposes to authorize and require the cor-
poration of Washington to regulate and determ-
ine the course of Tiber creek from Massachu-
setts avenue to Pennsylvania avenue, and for
that purpose to condemn, in the same manner
and under the same laws whereby new alleys
are condemned and opened in the city of Wash-
ington, a street, which shall be of the width of
fifty feet, and shall be called Tiber street, and
shall extend from Pennsylvania avenue on the
south to Massachusetts avenue on the north.
The street so condemned is to be subject to
the control of the corporation of Washington
in the same manner and to the same extent as
other streets within the city of Washington.
Thirty feet of the width of the said street, being
fifteen feet on each side of the middle thereof,
are to be for the bed of the Tiber creek. The
mayor of the city of Washington and the Com-
missioner of Public Buildings are, as soon as
practicable after the condemnation and determ-
ination of the line of Tiber street, to adver-
tise for at least ten days in two daily papers
published in the city of Washington, giving
detailed specifications and inviting proposals
for the arching of Tiber creek throughout the
entire length of Tiberstreet from Massachusetts
avenue, on the north side thereof, to Pennsyl-
vania avenue, in manner as similar as possible
to the present bridges across Tiber creek on
the lines of Pennsylvania avenue and Indiana
avenue. _ To defray the cost of the work the
corporation of Washington is authorized to
levy and collect a tax on the area of all assess-
able ground within the city limits which di-
rectly or indirectly drains into Tiber creek, the
aggregate of which tax is to be equal to such
proportionate share of the whole cost as the
area of the land within the building lines of
the squares or parts of squares which drain
into Tiber creek bears to the whole area so
drained ; and the residue of the cost of the
