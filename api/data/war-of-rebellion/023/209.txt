TANTALON, July 24, 1862.

Colonel J. B. FRY:

Will receipts given for provisions obtained in the country here, so as to make full rations of meat and bread, be recognized by General Buell? The work is heavy, and but slow progress can be made on half rations.

The stockades from Anderson to Cowan will be finished to-day.

H. M. BUCKLEY,

Colonel, &amp;c.

NASHVILLE,-, 1862.

Colonel J. B. FRY:

Glover telegraphs to-day from Murfreesborough that two ladies got to Nashville who could give important information, which he desired me to telegraph to you. We are now seeking them. Glover missed seeing them. Colonel Miller believes he knows what they can tell from other sources-that a rebel force of 5,000 is at McMinnville and 30,000 at Chattanooga. This he gets from Quartermaster Rickerts, Seventh Pennsylvania Cavalry, who was one of Dumont's expedition, and who yesterday saw a Union man whom he had dealt with in McMinnville, who told Rickerts of his own knowledge about McMinnville and from intercourse about Chattanooga. General J. S. Jackson is in this city. General Morgan, of Cumberland Gap, has resigned.

W. H. SIDELL.

TULLAHOMA, July 24, 1862.

Colonel J. B. FRY:

To get the 1,000 barrels of flour that I have arranged to purchase at Manchester it will be necessary to send all the teams of my command to wagon it to the depot. Will it disarrange any od your plans I march a couple of regiments and create the impression that I am moving on McMinnville? If not, I will do so to-morrow. I must accomplish it all at once or the portion left will be destroyed.

W. S. SMITH.
HEADQUARTERS,Huntsville, July 24, 1862.

General SMITH, Tullahoma:

You can send the two regiments and get the fluor. It is important to get all we can. Be prompt and cautious.
