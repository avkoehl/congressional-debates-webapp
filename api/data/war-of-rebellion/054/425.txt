my scout is within a mile of the latter. A citizen just in reports the enemy as having evacuated Knoxville, and retreating in direction of Morristown. A rebel woman of this place, who left here a few days ago for the purpose of visiting her husband in the rebel service, returned last night, and says she did not see her husband, as Longstreet had been ordered to fall back to Georgia, and is gone, and that none but cavalry remained around Knoxville.

MAYNARDVILLE, December 1, 1863.

SIR: Skirmishing had been kept up all day on the main Knoxville road about 4 miles from town, without any detriment to either side. The enemy had a position on the mountains, and kept is. Our scouts went out on the road to Blain's Cross-Roads; came up with the enemy about 8 miles out; skirmished with them nearly all day without any loss on our side. Late this evening Carter was reported within 4 miles of town. I have decided on holding this place until the enemy's intentions are more fully known. Firing commenced at Knoxville about 3 o'clock this afternoon, and still continues.

HDQRS. SECOND BRIG., SECOND DIV., CAVALRY CORPS,December 3, 1863.

GENERAL: A prisoner taken below here a few miles states that the rebel forces had orders to fall back to Maynardville last night. He also reports that they had orders to move on Kingston; also states that the forces yesterday were four brigades, commanded by Generals Morgan, Jones, and Armstrong,and Colonel Dibrell, commanding brigade. Colonel Dibrell was badly wounded. The assistant adjutant-general was killed in the charge. From all information their loss was not as large as first expected; will not exceed 50. Perhaps I will be able to get forage for the brigade.

Respectfully, yours, &amp;c.,
