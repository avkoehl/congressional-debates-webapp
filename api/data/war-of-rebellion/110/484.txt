these dipositions and plans are not approved by the general commanding you will please nofity me at once. It was my intention and desire to visit the general and submit my plans to him, but have been prevented by ill health and press of duties. I have but one pice of rifled artillery in my command, a Dyer gun, captured from the enemy. It weighs only 250 pounds and carries a 9-pound ball, and is a most valuable gun for cavalry service; but I find it very difficult to obtain ammunition for it, as we have no such guns in our service. We have now only 150 rounds for it, and if possible I wish to have ammunition prepared for it. If the general can send me a 3-inch Parrott gun, or any light rifled gun, I could make it very useful on the river in annoying the enemy's transports.

I am, major, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JAS. R. CHALMERS,

Brigadier-General.

General J. E. JOHNSTON:

Roddey's return resulted from orders given his troops by Forrest without my knowledge. His command being broken down, I immediately substituted Jackson. Will press in the direction of Corinth immediately. Can hear of no troops leaving Rosecrans. Shall I send you wagons and artillery by land? We are in great suspense, but hopeful.*

Major General C. L. STEVENSON,

Commanding Division:

GENERAL: I beg leave to communicate to you the following information in regard to the movements of the enemy as observed from points along my line: Yesterday afternoon wagons, troops, and artillery were seen leaving the front (Jackson road) and moving toward the Ferguson house on the Baldwin's Ferry road. The direction taken from that point is not known. This movement was continued during last night, and this morning there has been up to this hour (10.30 a. m.) a great deal less artillery fire than heretofore.

I am, general, very respectfully,

JOHN H. FORNEY,

Major-General.

Let me know the position of your headquarters, that I may keep you informed of my movement of the enemy seen from my line. My headquarters on the Jackson road, stone house, to the left, about 600 yards
