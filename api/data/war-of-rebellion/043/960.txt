to the aid of the Third Brigade or to check any advance of the enemy on the Martinsburg rad. Seeing that the force attacking on the Winchester road was largely superior to and was pressing Gregg's brigade, I ordered the First Pennsylvania, of McIntoh's brigade, to its support. One section of Captain Randol's light battery(E, First U. S. Artillery during the engagement was employed with Gregg's brigade. During the whole afternoon and until some time after dark the fight was maintained. The enemy was determined to get possession of Shepherdstown, at which were hospitals and also stores of provisions. Attacks with dismounted skirmishers, charge with his cavalry mounted, and incessant fire of his artillery would not accomplish his object. Having discovered that the enemy had gained the roads leading to Harper's Ferry, and the river in rear of Shepherdstown being unfordable, and attacked thus by so largely a superior force, we dare not yield our position, and it was held heroically. A line of skirmishers thrown out by Colonel McInthosh in his front effectually checked the advance of the enemy on our left. At about dark, Colonel Huey, Eight Pennsylvania Cavalry, arrived with the Second Brigade. His report that he had been attacked on the march from Harper's Ferry determined me to withdraw to that point. The wounded having been collected in the hospital in Shepherdstown, transportation was procured for such as could be removed. Those who could not bear transportation were left in charge of a medical officer. At about 9 p. m. it was discovered that the enemy was withdrawing. The rear of my command left Shepherdstown at daylight on the 17th. The command reached Harper's Ferry, the enemy not appearing on the march. At Shepherdstown my command captured a large quantity of bacon and flour. Our loss in this engagement was 4 officers wounded, 8 enlisted men killed and 68 wounded, and 1 officer and 10 enlisted men missing. *Colonel J. I. Gregg, commanding the Third Brigade, displayed the highest soldierly qualities in this action of his brigade. In the midst of his men, his coolness and bravely inspired them with confidence in their ability to hold their position. Colonel Gregg mentions Colonel Smith and Major Boothby, First Maine; Major Young, Fourth Pennsylvania Cavalry, and Captains Fishers and Swan, Sixteenth Pennsylvania Cavalry, as especially worthy of mention for distinguished conduct. Agreeably to orders from the major-general commanding Cavalry Corps, on the 19th, I moved with the Second and Third Brigades from Harper's Ferry, passing through Leesburg. On the 21st, I arrived at Manassas Junction. On the 22d, moved to Bristone Station; on the 24th, to Warrenton, Junction, at which place the First Brigade joined, it having been detached at Harper's Ferry. Lists of casualties have been herefore forwarded. I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant. D. McM. GREGG, Brigadier-General of Volunteers, Comdg. Second Division. Captain A. J. COHEN, Assistant Adjutant-General, Cavalry Corps.
