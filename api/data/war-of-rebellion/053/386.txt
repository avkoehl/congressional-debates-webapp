CHATTANOOGA, TENN., October 15, 1863-1 p.m.

(Received 1.25 p.m., 16th.)

Major-General HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

If Sherman is to give us any real help, his force must not be more remote than Athens. All the rebel cavalry that can be spared from vedette duty is on that flank, and they will overpower and wear us out unless we have an increased mounted force soon.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,Chattanooga, October 15, 1863.

Brigadier General L. THOMAS, Adjutant-General U. S. Army:

I respectfully beg leave to make a special mention of Brigadier General Absalom Baird, who, in temporary command of his division, handled his men with skill and bravery, sustaining probably more fierce assaults and losing a larger percentage of men than any other division in the battle except Brannan's. Holding the extreme left of our line where the enemy had intended to strike us on the 19th, his were amongst the first troops in action, and during the entire contest nobly did his troops under his watchful and careful eye sustain it. I respectfully recommend that he be made a major-general of volunteers for gallant and meritorious services at the battle of Chickamauga.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,Chattanooga, October 15, 1863.

Brigadier General L. THOMAS, Adjutant-General U. S. Army:

I beg leave to make special mention of Brigadier General Jefferson C. Davis, who commanded the First Division of the Twentieth Army Corps at the battle of Chickamauga. On this, as on every other battle-field, he was cool, courageous, and prompt in action. After going opportunely into action on the 19th, and fighting obstinately against superior numbers, he led the two small brigades again into battle on the 20th, and when, overpowered, his troops gave way, he rallied them at the first favorable point, and moved up to succor his brethren, who were fighting with General Thomas, although too late to get into action. For his meritorious services on this, as well as of former occasions, I respectfully recommend his promotion to a major-general of volunteers.

Very respectfully,

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.
