Right, Major General J. B. McPherson commanding:

Logan, 10,000; Dodge, 10,000; Blair, 10,000............. 30,000

Garrard's cavalry....................................... 5,000

------

Total................................................... 35,000

------

------

Grand aggregate.........................................112,000

This exceeds the probable force for duty, but is based on my official reports. If I can put in motion 100,000 it will make as large an army as we can possibly supply.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Washington, D. C.:

DEAR GENERAL: I now send you two more newspapers, my latest from Atlanta. I don't know if you have a quicker mail from that foreign port. I sent dates of the 18th and 19th by Colonel Comstock, and these are of the 20th.

Of course, in spite of all secrecy, Lee and Johnston are well apprised of the concentration going on to their front and are preparing for the conflict which they know to be inevitable. My greatest difficulty arises from the question of supplies, but when Grant moves I will, and then stand from under.

I see a mischievous paragraph that you are dissatisfied, and will resign; of course I don't believe it. If I did I would enter my protest. You possess a knowledge of law and of the principles of war far beyond that of any other officer in our service. You remember that I regretted your going to Washington for your own sake, but now that you are there you should not leave.

Stability is what we lack in our Government, and changes are always bad. Stand by us and encourage us by your counsels and advice. I know Grant esteems you, and I assure you I do.

I will go forward and command in person the moment I get the word start. I am now moving all my men into position and am drawing forward everything I can by way of reserve and road guards.

As ever, your friend,

W. T. SHERMAN.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,Nashville, April 24, 1864.

General THOMAS,

Chattanooga:

You may be as severe as possible with citizens who smuggle themselves into the cars. All are prohibited from going. I have more than doubled the number of cars per day. Yesterday we got off one hundred and ninety-three cars.

If you send a staff officer I will send you copies of General Grant's letters. They embrace the points of mine. Time is nearly up, and you cannot have your preparations too far advanced. For the first week out we will need but few wagons.
