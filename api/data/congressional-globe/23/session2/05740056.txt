THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
December 22,
The indemnities were not abandoned by the
negotiatois, but they postponed the fuithei dis-
cussion of the claims, on each side, to a future
day, and on the 30th of Septembcrconcludedand
signed a treaty, the second article of which is as
follows
" Aet 2 The Ministers Plenipotentiary of the
' two pames, not being able to agree at present
' lesperting the treaty of alliance of the 6th pi
' February, 1778, the treaty of amity and com-
' meree of the same date, and the convention of
' the 14th of November, 1788, noi upon the
' indemnities mutually due, oi claimed, the par-
' ties will negotiate further on these subjects
' at a convenient time, and until they may have
' agreed upon these points, the said treaties and
' convention shall have no operation, and the rela
' twins ot the two countnes shall be regulated as
'-¿plows "
On the 3d of February, 1801, the treaty was
ratified by the Senate, "piovided the second
amele be expunged," and by adding an article
limiting the opeiation of the treaty to a term of
eight years
On the 31st of July, 1801, it was also ratified
on the part of Fiance—agieemgto the limitation,
and to "the retienchmcnt of the second, aiticle,
'piovided that by this íetienchment the two
' Statesicnounccthe respecta o pretensions which
'are the object of the sxid article "
On the 19th of December following, the treaty
was again submitted to the Senate, which " re
' solved, that they considered the said convention
' as fully íatified "
This is the history of the final discharge of
France from all obligation to compensate our citi-
zens for losses It was effected by the act of this
Government in expunging the second article of
the convention, and regaiding it as fully ratified,
with the express piovision annexed by Fiance,
that it wa? a lenunciation, by each nation, of
its claims Thus, also, the United States were
forever dischaiged from the oneious burdens of
the ancient treaties, and fiom all claim ot indem-
nity foi íefusmg to Fiance the piívileges which
they sccuied to her
And at the same time, and by the same act and
instrument, these claimants were foie\cr deprived
of obtaining that indemnity ñora Fiance which,
if these claims had been kept separate and m ver
had been connected with any subject of national
guevancc, they most ceitamly would have ob-
tained The histoiy of negotiation cannot show
u more direct suilender of an admitted claim,
as a consideration of the release of an obligation
France always ofit led to set offonc class of claims
against the othu , the Envoys of the United States
refused it, the Senate and. tne 1 íench Govern
mi nt agiced to it, and accomplished it
Noi was the light to compensation destioyed
by a-state of wai Neither nation íegirded the
right to claim, nor the obligation to compensate,
as destroyed on account of the existing war The
United States claimed an indemnity as an exist-
ing right, and France admitted the claim to be
good
Itis true, that the United States authorized the
captuie of tin vessels of France on the high seas,
but they declaied it to be only m deft nse of the
persons and piopeity of th( ir citizens Wai was
not declared by either nation And m the con-
vention of 30th September, 1800, the claims on
both sides weie by the second article icgaidtd as
subsisting and valid This would not have been
done if wai had dtstioyid the light to have a
future negotiation and compensation Fiance m
her negotiations declared, as ouremoys say, that
her object was toatoid making compensation for
these claims, because she would find herself too
much exhausted by the war to sttisfy them, and
yet, anxious as she was,, bhe nevi r insisted upon
a dischaige, because a state of war had existed
On the 16th August, 1798, the Executive Dnec
toiy declare their wish " to piusue the friendly
habits of Fiance towards a people whose liberty
it defended " And at the same period the Min-
ister of Marine says, " Our political situation,
' with regard to the United States citizen, not
' having as yet undergone any change which can
'affect the respect due to neutral nations," " no
' injUry should be done to the safety and liberty
' of the officers and crews of any A menean ves-
'sels "
The French Ministers, in their letter of the 6th
of May, 1800, speak of the " misunderstanding"
and "transient misunderstanding "
And m their letter of the 11th of August follow-
ing, the French Ministers say. " that the treaties
' which united Trance and the United States aie
' not broken, that even wai could not break them,
' but that the stateof misunderstanding which has
' existed for some time," " has notbeenastate of
' war, at least on the side of France " Bysaymg
the treaties are not broken, the French Mimsteis
could not be regarued as intending to say, that
they had not been in many instances violated, as
they had both demanded and yielded to a com-
pensation as pioper foi such violations
The Minister of E\terioi Relations, Talleyi and,
in a letter of August 28, 1798, says " Therefoie,
'it never thought of making war against them,
' nor exciting cml commotions among them, and
1 every contrary supposition is an insult to common
' SPÍISP "
On the pai t of the United States it is well known
that she always pi ofessed and determined to mam
tain aneutial position
In the instructions to our envoys, 22d October,
1799, it is said "This conduct of the Fienoh
' Republic would have well j ustified an immediate
' declaration of war on the pait of the United
'States, but desnous of maintaining peace, and
' still willing to leave openthe dooi of íeconcilia-
' tion with France, the United States contented
' them selves with piepaiation foi defense and
' measures calculated to protect their commerce "
The American Ministers, in a letter dated 20th
August, 1800, speaking ot the act of Congress
annulling the tieatie , say, if it" had amounted
• to a cause of war, yet, as the wisdom of France
' reconciled it to peace, us application on the pun-
' ciple of war to the extinguishment of claims
'would be inexplicable "
Many other documents might be adduced to
prove the positions which have been taken, but
I foi bear, my object being only to exhibit suffi-
cient to show the relations of the two nations,
and the mannei in which these claims were dis-
charged
Does it become the United States now to allege
that these claims should not be paid by hei, for
other and different leasons than those which
Fiance used to avoid compensation'
France never seriously maintained that the
claims were extinguished by war, and how can
the United States now mtioduce such a defense?
As to the amount of compensation, theie may
not be any veiy certain and definite proof of it
It appears, flora a letter of tht Secietary of State
to a forme r chanman of a stlect committee, under
date of 22d Januaiy, 1827, that there were four
hundred and forty four cases then reported to that
Department I am infoimed that theie weie one
bundled and seventy-five cases filed before the
commissioners under the Florida treaty, other
and diffeient fiom those comprisingthefourhun-
died and forty-foui bifore named, making six
hundied and nineteen cases, which are known
There are piobably others Five millions, divided
among the six hundred and nineteen cases, would
give but little ovei $8,000 to each case as an
avei age
It is piobable the average value would be much
greater than that sum
There is an estimation of losses accompanying
eighty-eight out of the four hundied and fortv
four < ases, the aggiegate of which is stated to be
$2,235,702 59
If all the cases were to exhibit losses as gieat
as these, the amount of the losses would be more
than §11,000,000 But it is not supposed that
all the cases were so valuable
The ami unt offeied by the United States to
France, to be released from the stipulations of the
tieaties, as we have seen, was eight millions
francs. France offeied toieceive ten millions for
the extinction ot the guarantee, but would offer
no sum for the lelmquishment of her exclusive
privileges under the treaty of commerce
It may be inferred from this, that both nations
considered that the claims would amount to more
than these sums—as France was anxious to set
off the claims against the stipulations of the ti eaty,
and the United States declined it, until it was done
as before &tattd
It may be proper to remark, that these six
hundred and nineteen cases are of an entirely
different chaiacter, or are alleged to be so, from
those for which recompense was obtained under
the Louisiana treaty, oi undei the Florida tieaty,
and if they do not so prove to be, no compensa-
tion can b° made by the bill, as it does not provide
foi such as were piovided forundei those treaties
Oui debtis paid Compensation has been secured
by tieaty foi all, or neaily all, the mjuaes which
our citizens have suffered from other nations
Can the high chaiacter of this nation for doing
justice to all, at home and abroad, be maintained
without making compensation foi these injuries,
which have been the consideration of procuring
foi her a discharge from very onei ous obligations'
If the bill may pass, the only great claim i emam-
mg will be satisfied, and the duties of the Govern
ment to do justice to all will have been fulfilled
If these claims aie just, all feai for evil conse-
quences to arise from their allowance may be
dismissed Things are rightly so oidered here,
that to do justice to all others is to serve ourselves
best
When Mr S concluded,
Mr HILL took the flooi,and moved an ad-
journment, but afterwards withdrew the motion
The Sen ite then proceeded, on the motion of
