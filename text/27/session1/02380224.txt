the Whole this day, at 2 p m
Mr A said he made this motion without consulting \m
friends, for he had had no opportunity to do so, and without m
tending any disrespect to his fuend fiom Indiana, the moer
of the resolution Iff1 said he should have been pleaded to
have coribuited hi-3 friends, for he always received instruction
from them , but feeling now impeiUd by a sen=** of duty, ho
must act for himself, and he hoped no one would question his
discretion
Since the adjournment oí the House last evening, he had had
an interview with a gentleman t f great knowledge, and who**
position affurdeu him an opportunity to know, next to a a i
tamty, the late ot the great mea1-nes who^e passage was de

Mr A said it was due to this Hou-e tosiy that no blame
was to attach to the majonty here Atfiist we had a balky
horse or two m the team, and *>uch hoi es always played the

but by lengthening the bieist chain11, they had picveiiud tho^e

of the people may be wrecked He way fox putting the truth

Mr EVERLrr of Vermont ro^e toi question of ouler He

they were deieattd, wnild In1 hltind by j oJiticians nere-,
against the will of the people He spoke to the unbought, un
corrtipted people, and not to them
Mr LINN of New York iO:=e to a question of ordei He
said the gentleman was not only not eh jotmg at the mark, but
he was shooting at his friends
Mr BOTTfs here said that Mr Arnold would sign a difTe

of the American people If this countiy w«u> to be under the

, Mi SI proceedel to state that he destied tc lnnudtice an
amendment into the bill just reported, in order to make pi ovi
sion for retaking the census of Montgomery county, Maryland,
which had been so defectively taken as to represent the num
ber of the population of that county about 5,000 souls less than
the number in the census of 1830 Mr R had in his posses
sion proofs of these delects and omissions, and, among others,
certificates from the Clerk of the United States Court m the
District of Maryland, showing that indictments had been found
against some of the deputies oí th^ marshal m that county for
their mal feasance or non feasance in office by reason of these
veiy defects and omissions This amendment could not delay
the completion of the census, as Montgomery county adjoins
theDistnct of Columbia, and the retaking of the census as con-
templated by him could be completed and returned before the
expiration of the time now allowed by the bill for the accom-
phshment of its objects But this matter might be left, if
thought advisable, to the discretion of the Secietary of State,
undei whose supervision the whole subject was placed

Mr TERRÍ&, of New lork, spoke in defence of the bill, and
more paituulaily in leply to the obiections of Mr Under

this bill by hib own constituents, he observed that, alter all the
mutual elimination an Irecummation which hailcharacteuzed
the debate the naked question, when stripped of all extraneous
considerations, came to this—whether the national defences
should be putm such a state oí íepaír as this bih proposed
and as the btate of the countiy demanded The opinions of
gentlem non this question were somewhat affected by their
íelative geogiaphical po&i ions It was natural that gentlemen
fiom the mtenui should feel less anxiety in lelation to n than
those who ip ide 1 immediately upon the seaboard However
brave our countivmen might be, and whatevei reliance might
justly be placed upon their patriotism m a moment of emer
