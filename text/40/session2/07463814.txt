THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
July 8,
one railroad? The roads from Baltimore, from
Philadelphia, from New York, and from Bos-
ton westward are no more necessary now than
an equal number of lines of railroad to the
Pacific will be at a very early period. We
must have more than one Pacific railroad.
We must have a northern Pacific railroad.
We must have the Kansas Pacific railroad.
And we must have the International Pacific
railroad provided for in House bill No. 847,
from Cairosouthwestthrough Missouri, Arkan-
sas, and Texas, striking Mexico on the Rio
Grande, and reaching the Pacific coast at San
BlasorMazatlan. The construction of all these
railroads will aid in the aggrandizement of this
great Republic by possessing the trade which
must inevitably be developed on the Pacilie
ocean. And now, sir, in view of the existence
of the law governing the treaty-making power
as I have presented it, in view of the fact that
good faith requires us to execute this treaty,
and in view of the great, law of expansion which
must control the destiny of this country, I am
ready to cast my vote for this bill to consum-
mate the purchase of Alaska.
Mr. BANKS. I want to read a single ex-
tract from the document on Russian America,
which was printed by order of the House, in
reference to Major Kennicutt's passage through
this country :
" In consequence of tins succKestion he ultimately
undertook, eight years since, his first trip by Lakes
Superior, Wnmcpeg, Athabasca, and Ureat Slave
lake down to i'ort Simpson, where he spout the first
winter; thence down the Slacken zie to the tidewaters
of its deltas; thence up the Pearl river to l,lort JVIc-
Vherson; thence over the Porcupine mountains, the
northern termination ot the ltocky mountains, to the
J)orcupino river, and down to its junction wirh tho
Yukon, on the one hundred ami forty-seventh degree
Ot west longitude, where the British fur company
have a large post over a degree on Russian territory."
There he died, and his dead body was carried
down to Beliring strait.
Mr. WILLIAMS, ot'Pennsylvania. Thegen-
tleman is mistaken; it was on adifferent expe-
dition.
Air. BANKS. The gentleman is correct.
Mr. WILLIAMS, ot' Pennsylvania. I did
not dispute the fact that he had been as far as
the junction of the Yukon and the Porcupine,
but that the territory between the junction of
those two rivers and New Labrador, a distance
of otic thousand miles, was unexplored.
Mr. BANKS. It has been explored, but
Major Kennicutt died before making his report.
If he had lived lie would have given us inval-
uable testimony of this territory.
Mr. WILLIAMS, of Pennsylvania. I say
that the country was never explored, and we
have never had any report of it.
Mr. BANKS. There was no report, because
Major Kennicutt died before he could make it.

Mr. TRUMBULL. The Committee on the
Judiciary, to whom was referred a resolution
as to the propriety of a law to authorize In-
dians to testify in certain cases, have instructed
me to report it back and ask to be discharged
from its further consideration, on the ground
that the committee are of opinion that the
Indians have a right to testify under the law as
it stands and no statute is necessary on that
subject.
The report was agreed to.
Mr. TRUMBULL. The same committee, to
whom was referred the bill (H. R. No. 90) to
authorize and require the administration of
oaths in certain cases, and to punish perjury
ineonncetion therewith, recommend its indef-
inite postponement, being of opinion that the
laws already authorize the chairmen of com-
mittees, both standing and special committees,
to administer oaths. There is no necessity for
the hill.

agreed to.
