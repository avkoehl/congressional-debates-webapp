HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF CENTRAL, KENTUCKY,Lexington, Ky., May 16, 1863.

Honorable J. F. ROBINSON,

Governor of Kentucky, Frankfort:

GOVERNOR: I have received your letter kindly offering to co- operate with me in raising a force for special service in the counties infested by the guerrillas. The plan is also approved by General Burnside.

It is intended to bring this force under the provisions of the 20,000 bill, but I think that when a company is willing to enlist for the war it should by all means be allowed.

This will serve to organize and arm the Union men now hunted and persecuted by the guerrillas, and settle the peace and security of the interior portion of the State.

Under General Orders, Numbers 59. Department of the Ohio General Burnside directs General Boyle to co-operate with Your Excellency, but by special authority I am clothed with sufficient power for this particular purpose. If you will permit me to designate two or three recruiting officers, on their raising the men they can be commissioned and I will have them mustered into service. I am anxious to lose on time.

I remain, Your Excellency's most obedient servant,

O. B. WILLCOX.

BOSTON, May 16, 1863

Honorable E. M. STANTON:

I earnestly desire that the Fifty-fourth Massachusetts Regiment may be assigned to General Hunter. This is the wish of its officers.

JOHN A. ANDREW.

Governor of Massachusetts.
