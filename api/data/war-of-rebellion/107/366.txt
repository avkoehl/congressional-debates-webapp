[Major PORTER:]

Will stop in the cars until I can find a place to encamp. My men must have tents and provisions. Major Belger is one mile and a half below me, in last car.

[WYNKOOP.]

General W[YNKOOP]:

I will send provisions immediately, and tents are to come from the city by order of Governor Curtin. If you can let Major Belger come up, do so. Where will you encamp?

PORTER.

[Major PORTER:]

I cannot yet say. The ground must be found. There is none near the road here.

[WYNKOOP.]

General W[YNKOOP]:

Come here with your command and go into camp, leaving men to guard the bridges to this place.

PORTER.
