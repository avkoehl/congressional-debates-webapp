If Banks attempted this, Rust's brigade might attack his rear and whip him. If you believe you are about to be attacked keep all the subsistence stores you have. Give me your opinion as to the possibilities.

PORT HUDSON, March 11, 1863.

(Received March 12, 1863.)

The enemy has not developed his plans. Outside report from Baton Rouge says he will advance 10,000 toward Clinton and the rest against this place, or that he will advance the whole force toward Clinton and pass gunboats by to starve us out.

FRANK. GARDNER,

Major-General, Commanding.

Lieutenant-General PEMBERTON.

PORT HUDSON, March 11, 1863.

(Received March 12, 1863.)

The enemy have advanced a small force to the Comite. They do not appear to be advancing with their whole force. I two ill be impossible to operate from this point toward Ponchatoula, but an advance toward Clinton will leave his rear exposed. Rust is here, and al of my operations will have to be from his point. I will keep you advised.

FRANK. GARDNER,

Major-General.

Lieutenant-General PEMBERTON.

PORT HUDSON, March 12, 1863.
