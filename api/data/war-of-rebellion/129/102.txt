and sixty years of age, according to calculation from the census tables-36,034 between the ages of sixteen and sixty left in the State.

Of the number put into the Army about 60,284 are between the ages of eighteen and forty-five. The State should furnish from this class, according to calculation from the census, 71,000 men. There must be, then, 11,716 men between the ages of eighteen and forty-five years to be accounted for. General Pillow's organization exempted about 269 men, and the old organization exempted 7,993, leaving about 3,453 between the ages of eighteen and forty-five years still subject to conscription.

The census table shows that the State should furnish in time of peace, at this time, about 10,224 between forty-five and fifty-five years of age, from which must be deducted about 4,000 for volunteers in the field, leaving about 6,224 available men between these ages.

In the event of an extension of the age of conscription to fifty-five years the State should furnish then-

The number of men who have substitutes is not known, but about three-fourths of them are embraced in the number between forty-five and fifty-five years of age.

In the foregoing estimates no allowance has been made for the exemptions that may hereafter be granted, as this number will of course depend upon the modification the law may undergo during the present session of Congress.
