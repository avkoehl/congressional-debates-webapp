General W. D. WHIPPLE,

Chief of Staff, and Assistant Adjutant-General:

The quartermaster's gun-boat Newsboy just arrived from Eastport. The commander says Admiral Lee reports that he had effectually cleaned out the rebels at Florence, and that he had destroyed the pontoon bridge across the river at that point; and in verification of Admiral Lee's report the commander of the Newsboy says he met with numerous pieces of a pontoon, bridge floating in the Tennessee between Duck River and Eastport. A detailed report to the general by special messenger.

HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,Pulaski, December 31, 1864-8 p.m.

Brigadier General DONALDSON,

Chief Quartermaster, Dept. of the Cumberland, Nashville, Tenn.:

Your telegram of this date is received. Reports would indicate that Hood will attempt to halt his retreating army at Corinth, but this can hardly be possible for any length of time, as General Dana has broken the Mobile and Ohio Railroad for some distance below that point. You can be prepared to supply the cavalry command, and also General A. J. Smith's, at Eastport, with, perhaps, the Twenty-third Army Corps. The Fourth Army Corps, General Wood will, for the present be posted at Huntsville. Happy New Year.

Respectfully,

ROBT. H. RAMSEY,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
