Honorable GEORGE W. RANDOLPH:

The Thirtieth Virginia left here at 10 p.m. and the Forty-eighth Georgia at 11. A train has also [been] ordered, as I understand, to take up the Arkansas regiment of Colonel Manning at Port Walthall Junction. These troops could be stopped in Richmond and ordered back to Halfway Station; thence take the line of march for Drewry's Bluff.

RICHMOND, VA., June 1, 1862.

Honorable GEORGE W. RANDOLPH,

Secretary of War:

SIR: I informed General Lee yesterday that Captain Lee, in command of naval forces at Drewry's Bluff, reported to me that the supporting force to his battery had been withdrawn, with the exception of about 300 troops, and that a land force was necessary to protect his handful of seamen who man the batteries.

Inclosed herewith I hand you Captain Lee's dispatch of this evening, announcing the ascent of the river by iron vessels of the enemy and the landing of troops from his transports 7 miles below the battery. Unless troops are immediately sent down the batteries may be carried by a small land force, and I suggest that a sufficient force be sent at once. The steamers at Rocketts will transport them.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. R. MALLORY,

Secretary of the Navy.
