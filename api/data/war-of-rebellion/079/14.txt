Colonel J. C. DONALDSON,

Nashville:

As soon as I can arrange the troops on the railroad I will start for Nashville to assign the troops to points on the road as re- enforcements arrive from the States.

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding.

Acknowledge receipt.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General.

NASHVILLE, October 1, 1864.

Major-General THOMAS:

There are two car-loads of mail for the army. General Rousseau, at Tullahoma, thinks trains might run safety with a good guard. There are a good many officers here waiting to go down. We have no surplus of troops here. I got three regiments only from Kentucky; all they could spare. I am instructed by General Sherman to issue any orders you may wish from these headquarters.

J. D. WEBSTER,

Brigadier-General.

CRUTCHFIELD HOUSE, October 1, 1864-6 p. m.

Brigadier-General WEBSTER,

Nashville:

If you have not already started the trains with commissary stores for this point, I think you can do so safely by putting on board a strong guard to each train.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding.

CHATTANOOGA, October 1, 1864-9 p. m.

Brigadier General J. D. WEBSTER,

Nashville, Tenn.:

Colonel George P. Buell has gone up the road to-day with a construction train, taking with him a regiment as a guard as far as Tullahoma. I will telegraph him to have this regiment the trains you may send down to-morrow to this place. After to-morrow I think the usual train guards will be sufficient.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding.
