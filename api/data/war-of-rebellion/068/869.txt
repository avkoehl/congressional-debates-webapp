Major-General HANCOCK,

Commanding Second Corps.

The major-general commanding directs me to say that the attack is abandoned and that you will immediately order Tyler's division back to the Anderson house and assume a defensive attitude, sending such of your artillery trains as you do not require to the Anderson house with Tyler's division. General Wright will be withdrawn as soon as Tyler is out of the way.

Major-General HANCOCK,

Commanding Second Army Corps:

The major-general commanding directs that you withdraw after 9 o'clock this evening and move to Anderson's Mill at the crossing of the Ny by the Massaponax Church road. General Burnside is directed to withdraw after you have withdrawn and to take position on the left of General Wright, as close to the enemy as he can get. He will cross the Ny at Andersons' Mill. You, therefore, will clear the road for him.
