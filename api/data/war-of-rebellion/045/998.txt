********************************************************

XV. Brigadier General H. H. Walker will proceed to the headquarters of General R. E. Lee, and report for duty.

By command of the Secretary of War:

JNO. WITHERS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA,July 12, 1863 - 5. 30 p. m.

Major-General STUART:

GENERAL: Colonel [A. L.] Long has returned from a survey of our position occupied by the corps of Longstreet and Hill. He has discovered the enemy massing their troops in their front, and thinks their principal attack on our lines will be between the Williamsport and Boonsborough road and the Frederick road, embracing both said roads.

He has not been in Ewell's front (has just gone), but from your reports and those of General Ewell, there seems to be no enemy in that quarter. He thinks the attack will be made early to-morrow morning. Should it be, and there be nothing to occupy you, I wish you to bear down on the enemy's right, endeavoring to select good positions with your horse artillery, to harass and retard him. You will have, however, to keep a good lookout on the Chambersburg and Greencastle road, and not leave our left uncovered.

I am, most respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. E. LEE,

General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA,July 12, 1863 - 9 p. m.

Major General J. E. B. STUART:

GENERAL: Your letter of 7. 35 received. I this afternoon sent you a letter requesting you to have your cavalry in hand on our left, to prevent any attempt of the enemy on that quarter, and, should an opportunity occur, to advance upon the enemy's right and rear with your horse artillery, to shake him in his position or attack. Should we be fortunate enough to break him, you will then have an opportunity to pursue. I understood Fitz. Lee to say that General Longstreet said he only wanted a few vedettes from his brigade, and, in that event, you had better have him with you. I shall write to General Longstreet, if his brigade can be of no service there, and has not joined you, to order it accordingly.

Keep your eye over the field, use your good judgment, and give assistance where necessary.

I am, most respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. E. LEE,

General.
