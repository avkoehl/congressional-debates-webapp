At Salisbury he attack and defeated a force of the enemy under General Gardner, capturing 14 pieces of artillery and 1,364 prisoners, and destroyed fifteen miles of railroad and the bridges toward Charlotte.

General Canby, who had been directed in January to make preparations for a movement from Mobile Bay against Mobile ad the interior of Alabama, commenced his movement on the 20th of March. The Sixteenth Corps, Major General A. J. Smith commanding, moved from Fort Gaines by water to Fish River; the Thirteenth Corps, under Major Ge. Gordon Granger, moved from Fort Morgan ad joined the Sixteenth Corps on Fish River, both moving thence o Spanish Fort and investing it on the 27th; while Major-General Steele's command moved from Pensacola, cut the railroad leading from Tensas to Montgomery, effected a junction with them, ad partially invested Fort Blakely. After a severe bombardment of Spanish Fort, a part of its line was carried on the 8th of April. During the night the enemy evacuated the fort. Fort Blakely was carried by assault on the 9th, and many prisoners captured; our loss was considerable. These successes practically opened to us the Alabama River, and enabled us to approach Mobile from the north. On the night of the 11th the city was evacuated, and was taken, possession of by our forces o the morning of the 12th.*

The expedition under command of Brevet Major-General Wilson, consisting of 12,500 mounted men, was delayed by rains until March 22, when it moved from Chickasaw, Ala. On the 1st of April General Wilson encountered the enemy in force under Forrest, near Ebenezer Church, drove him in confusion, captured 300 prisoners and 3 guns, and destroyed the Central bridge over the Cahaba River. On the 2nd he attacked ad captured the fortified city of Selma, defended by Forrest with 7,000 men and thirty-two guns, destroyed the arensal, armory, naval foundry, machine-shops, vast quantities of stores, and captured 3,000 prisoners. On the 4th he captured ad destroyed Tuscaloosa. On the 10th he crossed the Alabama River, ad after sending information of his operations to General Canby, marched on Montgomery, which place he occupied o the 14th, the enemy having abandoned it. At this place may stores and five steam-boats fell into our hands. Thence a force marched direct on Columbus, and another on West Point, both of which places were assaulted and captured on the 16th. At the former place we got 1,500 prisoners ad 52 field guns, destroyed 2 gunboats, the navy-yard, founders, arsenal, many factories, ad much other public property. At the latter place we got 300 prisoners, 4 guns, ad destroyed 19 locomotives ad 300 cars. On the 20th he took possession of Macon, Ga., with 60 field guns, 1,200 militia, and 5 generals, surrendered by General Howell Cobb. General Wilson, hearing that Jeff. Davis was trying to make his escape, sent forces in pursuit, and succeeded in capturing him on the morning of May 11. On the 4th day of May General Dick Taylor surrendered to General Canby all the remaining rebel forces east of the Mississippi.+ A force sufficient to insure an easy triumph over the enemy under Kirby Smith, west
