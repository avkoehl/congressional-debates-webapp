I cannot say too much for the gallantry of the officers and men under my command in this action. It was above all praise. I have never before witnessed good conduct in battle so universal.

I am greatly indebted to my own staff for their efficiency. Captain Hart, who always distinguishes himself in battle, was placed under the command of Colonel Roberts, to assist him on our left, and for his conduct I refer you particularly to the report of Colonel. Roberts.* Captain [C. B.] Sheppard, of my old military family, was (as ever before in battle) gallant and useful. I cannot say too much in praise of Acting Assistant Adjutant- General [E. R.] Wells. My engineer, Captain Ellis, and Lieutenant [J.] Avery, and Volunteer Aide- de- Camp (for the occasion) George [T.] Madison, were also very useful and efficient. I herewith submit a statement of casualties. A full lest of names as soon as procured will be forwarded.

To Chief Surgeon George Cupples great praise is due in using the limited means at his command in alleviating the sufferings of our noble soldiers and his great an untiring activity in the discharge of all his duties.

Owing to the breaking down of the horses in section of Semmes' battery, it did not arrive in time to participate in the action.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

THOMAS GREEN,

Brigadier- General, Commanding Cavalry Division.

Major E. SURGET,

Assistant Adjutant- General, District of Western Louisiana.
