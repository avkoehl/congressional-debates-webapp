Reference of President's Message—Mr. Murray.

Government These two classes of agents were
then used m the collection and disbursement of the
public revenue* The recommendations of the
Message piopose to dispense with the latter class of
agents, and to retain only the first class in the per-
formance of these duties. This would seem to sim-
plify very much these important operations of the
Government, and keep the public moneys always
within her contiol The former system was moie
complex, and left our public tretsuie in the h mds
of irresponsible depositories This system is now
objected to, on the ground that the depositories
proposed would be unsafe, and too much would be
added to the patronage of the Executive It is ob-
jected to, abo, on the ground that it would operate
injuriously on the currency of the country. I shall
notice these, and some other objections, in the
course of my remar'cs For the piesent, however,
I will observe, that from the sentiments which I en-
tertain, the objections appear to me to be them
selves very objectionable It does not appeal to
me that the Government funds ever can be safe in
the hands of depositories not responsible to the Go-
vernment, nor subject to her control Such deposi-
tories will ever have it in their power to thwart tin
purposes of the Govei ument, by w ithholdmg hei
funds, which, in evtiaordmary emergencies, as m
times of war, might enable them to upset tin Go-
vernment. The histi iv ol the late diposite system
is a deal exempl Station ofi he danger ol employ -
ing such depositories The feet th it the Govern-
ment was pionounced bankiupt, and «as, in fict,
unable to pay hei creditors, when she had at the
same time near thirty millions of dollars m the
hands of her deposite banks, which, from then sus-
pension of specie payments, she w as unable to
command, is commentaiy enough on such a as-
tern, or, rather, tin facts being stated, need no com-
mentary at all
On the other hand, I ha^e been unable to disco-
ver in what manner the sjstem pioposed, ii adopt-
ed, could injure or debase the currency of the coun-
try. So far as i s operation may be ci ncoined with
the currency of the countrv, I ira cleaily ol opi-
nion that its effects will besalut.tiy Ioiiiijm.1I,
however, I am w ell "atisfir d that n< thing but a g< -
neial and radical reform in thi prison banking
system of the United Statts can relieve- us dom the
sudden and disastrous fluctuations in oui ouiroie\,
which have heutofcii so loii„ ano so olii i afilie ul

Banking, aoce ldtnr to is pici.ii1 e ^rnt/iii n,
is but an enlarged and )e<r.li7< rt system ot bn>\ i-
age It has accompann 1 us operations on the
community with th" most dangoious lendeiu íes,
eormpting the morals oí the pi opio byinlitsnf,
into all classes, «hither lush oi low, the most in-
ordinate spirit of speculation, and spoiling wuh
their fortunes by the expansions and contractions

ruining the conntrj, bj an unprecedented increase

of then credit Banking had become toe most pio-
fitable and, at thf same time, the most irrespoisible
ofall the modes of speculation Acompany of indi-
viduals had onl} to be incorporaied as the stockoldh-
eisof abaiik,ttnd they could, to any extent, exen m^e

dit of the best citizens of the counfy, in the shape of

bilities are all on the side of the citi^pii lie and
his endorsee are íesDonsible persons']}, to the list
cent of then piopei tj, for the pa\ metit of ther tile
given to the bank, with ÚV u secant and interest
thereon The bank, whose stoikholdets ne
shielded from individual responsibility, and vhoic
mock capital very often appears only on her bool s,
and not m her vaults, gues her ciedit m exchange
until it floods the country, upon which 'he pays no
mtere t The bank is always secure, and treasures
up large profits, withdrawn from the industry of
the community The community may be i umed
by the breaking of the hank, after which her stock-
holders ate irresponsible In this way splendid
fortunes are amassed by the stockholders, without
any poition of that hazard and responsibility
usually attendant upon the enterprise ot the honest
adventurer. Fot the last year or two preceding
the suspension of specie payments, the profits of
the banks are known to have been enoimoas, va-
rying, in most instances, fiom 18 to 50 per cent
Since the suspension, most of the banks have fallen
into the keeping of then evil genius, being com-
pelled, from the stern force of cucumstances, to
yield to the pressing or tempting necessities with
which they are sui rounded The mammoth bro-
kers, shielded from responsibility, and entrenched
behind the forms of law, have fallen into the hands
of the shaving shops and common brokers of the
countiy, being compelled to become the victims of
their exactions, oi the panders to their iniquities
Brokers fix whateiei price they please upoi their
p ipei, and although the chaiacter of the institutions
must sutler injurv, the communitj must beai the
loss I will give you one instance In the West,
for some time after the general suspension, the
merchants of New Oilcans continued to rec ive
papei upon the hanks ol Tennessee at par, m pay-
ment of debts The biokers of New Orleans, how
ever, deteimined to gue no funds for Tennessee
paper without a discount of ten pei cent The
consequence was, that the merchants weie com-
pelled to demand a discount alio of ten per cent
that being the price placed upon it by the bit kers
Instances, howcvei, need not lie cited except for
illustration, the facts are known to exist, anil the
practice to prevail, in pnhaps every comrntiu.il
<it) m the Union The siioi her-elf is taken by
means of the same chirm with whiih she so often
lured otheis to dcs'ruction ¡
But   it   mav   bi     presumid   that    the   banks
will    not   willingly    submit   to   this   mortitying
arid    humihiting    injury    up in     tin ir    credit,
without endeavorin',   by   some means  or other,
to leap some coi responding benefit     The strong-
est temptilion is tin >wn open to the banks to em-
ploy biokers to buj up and pinchase in their pap i
it a  discount, or sue h a puce as has been placed
upon it by the biokos     I do not affirm that this is
flit case, noi ai i I f,oing now to stop lo investigate
the matte r     1   only state the tempt Uion,  lor hu-
man ixpenenei h is admonished us that when lemp-
t itiou courts, tne lure is not always disregarded
What is lost in clniacttr  may be compensated in

II the .rood ol the communis and   the ram ol the
banks come lo b. wci«he 1 against each other in the
sciles, tin pi< ponili rmec is always on the side of
'he h ink inti n t     This, then, being apiuuipjl
and leading in' cdi-nt in their nature, how is it pos-
sible to expect that banks that are lying like an in-
cubus upon tne rommuni y,poweiliss  and almo t
m tton'ess—like the wieek of some dismantled an I
foundered 5liip, bi ought to destruí tion iiilhe distant
ocein by the  lenient} and folly of her drunken
helmsman, who sits in motionless stupor, and wit-
noses without   emotion the surrounding disasters
and distress of which h«" is the author— will  resist
[he many oppoitnnities that surround them of en-
joy nig the sava¿e and miserable conso'ation of pro
fitmer amidst the general calamity, by recen msr ad-
thtonal  accessions  to  their  gams, thou/u adding
still  fin hei to the general prosfalion of the coin
try.    The amo mt of bank  paper in circulauon at
the  'ime of the late suspension of sp ci  payments
is said to have  been $1 10,000,000     The ilcpreci -
tioi m this ene rmous and bloated mass is es'imated
¡u 10 pei cent  v h,ch,on he §140,000,000 m circu-
lation    would   he   i   los   io  the   community of
;$ 14,01)0,000    This was a clear loss, a deadening
shock to the holders of the paper, sufficient of itself
to produce veiy disastrous iecults
This, however, was a small item compared with
the general prostration of confidence and other re-
sults consequent upon the depreciation. The paper
cnculation being depreciated, forced the precious
metals to disappear, or threw them into the markte
as merchandise. The holders of specie laid it
away under lock and key, or carried it to the bro-
kers, and sold it for the premium rt commanded.
The miser made himself secure against the evils of
depreciation, by locking up his gold and silver,
whrlst the Shyloclc and usurer fattened upon the
premrums received from the brokers. But the ho-
nest husbandman who «arned to market his hum-
ble products for sale, was compelled to receive
either the depreciated paper of banks, or individual
tickets, redeemable, not in. money, but in the same
depreciated paper. If, after receiving such paper
at jiai foi his marketable pioducts, he calls upon
the merchant to pay hrs debts, he is frequently
told that his paper wrll be taken at a dtscount oí 10
per cent If the poor man utters any complaint at
this, he is told a very reasonable tale by the mer-
chxnt about the general embarrassment of the
limes, and that pressing necessity will compel him
m a few days to exchange his notes and accounts
ioi a constable's or other officer's receipt. This
argument is too forcible to be resisted, and ten per
cent of the poor man's labor is gone. I need not
notice the highei grades of trade, where we have
lound our exchanges bioken up, our commerce
bioken down, and the growers oí our staples, after
being duped and seduced into debt, delivered over
to the mercy oí constables and sheriffs, with therr
products lying on their hands, unsold and unsalea-
ble. Such have been the mtserable effects of the
jiresent banking system in the. United States.
Thank God, the energies and resources of the coun-
try are now redeeming it from the thraldom under
which it was placed Specie is beginning to flow
into oui country at almost every port, and has
nearly ceased lo be an article of exportation. Our
foreign eights aie almost entnely extinguished, and
exchanges tluee per cent in favor ot the United
Slates Our crops are abundant, and we yet pos-
sess all the elements of national wealth
1 will now give a glancing notice to the con-
dition of these banks, for the purpose of see-
ing the manner in which fhey have been con-
ducted, and also then fitness for being again made
the depositories of the public moneys Prom a
published statement in the newspapers, which I
examined a few days since, it appears that the
banks of New Yoik have an aggiegate of specie,
amounting to $3,482,620, and that their immediate
liabilities amount to $33,313,821, Vu circulation
$H,')08,803, public and private deposites f 19,404,-
'US These banks have, therefore, on hand but
one dollar in specie for nine dollars and nxty six
cents and two thirds of their immediate liabilities
Prom the same table it appears, that the immediate
liabilities of the bants ol Ptrmsylvama amount to
^38,103,818 42, that is circulation $16,164,539 21,
public and pnvale dep isiles $11,1)9,279 21, their
specie on hand $0,908,510 88, being one dollar for
cuiy faui dollars and sixteen and two-tbtrd cents
o' their immediate habiltt cs By the last report
ol the Secretar} of the Treasury, the immediate
means of the deposite banks of Virginia and North
Caiohna aie stated to have been m July last,
§•5,172,655 their immediate habilit es $15,267,563
The immediate means of the bmks oí Tennessee
and Alabama, at the same time, are stated to have
been «¡,3 506,164, their lm nceliate Irabihties $16,360-
íí'M By his ii port tothe special se sion, it will be
seen that of nearly two-thirds of the deposite
bin! s, their immediate means m July last tarred
horn one hfth to one-twentieth of their immediate
lespe risibilities The class of banks composed of
the Slates ot Tennessee, Alabama, Mississippi,
and Louisiana, had at that time of immediate
means $1,168 022 m specie, -whilst their immediate
liabilities weie $33,997,593, vi7 circulation and
deposites, public and p ivate, $21,480,819, balance
due other banks, after deducting all that was due
fiom other banks §2,516,773 Such is the condi-
•íon of these banks, whose extravagant credit has
brought wide spread disaster over the greater por-
tion of the Southwestern country, and whose paper
m Kentucky has vaned at a discount of from tea
