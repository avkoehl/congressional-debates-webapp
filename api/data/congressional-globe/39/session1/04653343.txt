amend the section by adding to it the follow-
ing proviso:

bonded warehouse established under tho one hun-
dred and sixty-eighth section of the internal revenue
act of June 30, lSt>i, and located in any of tho Atlan-
tic States, may be removed therefrom for transporta-
tion to a customs bonded warehouse at any port on
the Pacific coast of the United States, fortho purpose
only of being exported therefrom, under such rules
and regulations, and upon the execution of such
bonds or othcrsecurity, as the Secrotary of the Treas-
ury may prescribe.
