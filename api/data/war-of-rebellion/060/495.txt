CUMBERLAND, February 1, 1864-7 a. m.

Colonel MULLIGAN,

New Creek:

Your telegram received. Your proposition approved. Protect the rear of your Ridgeville force by close watch of the gap road. Two regiments will arrive to-night; more will arrive to-morrow. If you are attacked in large force night them until I can relieve you. I will detain the two regiments that arrive to-night here, for fear the real object of attack is this place.

B. F. KELLEY,

Brigadier-General.

CUMBERLAND, February 1, 1864-12 m.

Colonel MULLIGAN,

New Creek:

While you will make the necessary preparations for the defense of your position, you will at the same time make such needful arrangements for an offensive, rapid movement as your best judgement may dictate. Sullivan's cavalry will reach Romney, I trust to-morrow night. Please keep the suggestion of an offensive movement strictly to yourself. One thousand infantry will leave Harper's Ferry for us to-day.

B. F. KELLEY,

Brigadier-General.
