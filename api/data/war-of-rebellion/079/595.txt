attempts to invade Middle Tennessee I will hold Decatur and be prepared to move in that direction, but unless I let go Atlanta my force will not be equal to his.

Lieutenant-General GRANT,

City Point, Va.:

Dispatch of 11. 30 a. m. received. I will go on and complete my arrangements and in a few days notify you of the day of my departure. General Thomas reports to-day that his cavalry reconnoitred within three miles of Florence yesterday, and found Beauregard intrenching. I have ordered him to hold Nashville, Chattanooga, and Decatur, all well supplied for a siege. All the rest of his army to assemble about Pulaski and to fight Beauregard cautiously and carefully. At the same time for A. J. Smith and all re-enforcements to get up to enable him to assume a blod offensive, and to enable Wilson to get a good mount of cavalry. I think Jeff. davis will change his tune when he finds me advancing into the heart of Georgia instead of retreating, and I think it will have an immediate effect on your operations at Richmond.

Lieutenant General U. S. GRANT,

City Point, Va.:

If I turn back the whole effect of my campaign will be lost. By my movements I have thrown Beauregard well to the west, and Thomas will have ample time and sufficient troops to hold him until re- enforcements reach him from Missouri and recruits. We have now ample supplies at Chattanooga and Atlanta to stand a month's interruption to our communications, and I don't believe the Confederate army can reach our lines, save by cavalry raid, and Wilson will have cavalry enough to checkmate that. I am clearly of opinion that the best results will follow me in my contemplated movement through Georgia.

WARRENSBURG, MO., November 2, 1864.

Major-General SHERMAN:

I am now under orders to join you with my command, and will lose no time in reaching Saint Louis and embarking for destination en route. I have about 500 men in Memphis belonging to the First and THIRD DIVISIONS, SIXTEENTH Army Corps. They are in detachments, and in occupation of the forts in Memphis. I now most earnestly request that you will order all men belonging to the First and THIRD DIVISIONS to be relieved from duty at once and sent to Cairo, Ill., and to report to me by telegraph at Saint Louis.

A. J. SMITH,

Major-General.
