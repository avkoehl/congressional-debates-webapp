His Excellency Governor CURTIN,

Harrisburg, Pa.:

This Department is just advised by the agent of an importer of Enfield rifles that he will not deliver a lot 25,000 that had been offered to the United States, as Governor curtin of Pennsylvania has offered one-third more for them. Is it true that you are competing with the United States in the purchase of arms and offering much larger prices?
