This decided success is due to the personal exertions of General Hancock, and, in a great measure, to the conspicuous gallantry of Brigadier-General Egan, temporarily commanding a division in the Second Corps. The lateness of the hour at which this attack was made, and at which the information reached me, prevented General Crawford being sent of re-enforce General Hancock. Indeed, the distance and difficulty of moving through the dense thicket, together with the fact that Crawford was engaged with the enemy, induced me to put Ayres' division in motion, but it was dark before he could be crossed over the run at Armstrong's Mill. The position of the enemy being such, holding as it were, a ridge formed by his entrenched line in front of the run, and the run in rear, and forcing a separation of my flanks of over six miles, when he had only tow miles to move, deterred me from keeping Hancock in position and re-enforcing him with another corps, as it would leave only one corps to meet the attack of the enemy, if he should choose to move over. I therefore directed the withdrawal of Hancock and Crawford, who both recrossed the run by 7 a. m. to-day. About 12 ., having withdrawn all the impedimenta of the army, the several corps were, in accordance with the lieutenant-general's orders, withdrawn, and acre now moving into their former positions in the entrenched lines. In addition to the 7000 prisoners taken by the Second Corps, there were nearly 200 taken by Crawford. No prisoners are reported as lost by us, except the stragglers, whom it is always difficult to collect when withdrawing. No return of the casualties has yet been made. In the Second Corps the losses, owing to the severe fighting, are believed to be heavy. I regret to report that, owing to the want of transportation and the character of the cases, some of the most severely wounded were left in charge of surgeons in some houses on the field.

Very respectfully, &amp;c.,
