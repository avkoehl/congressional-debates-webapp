Major Patto, Virginia army, one of Harneys ecort from Harper's Ferry, states that troops are being concentrated at Chambersburg, Pa., with a view, it is believed, of occupying the Maryland Heights, which command Harper's Ferry. That the force now there, estimated at 4,000, could not hold that point against 1,000 U. S . troops. There are too many militia geenrals issuing conflicting orders and creating confusion. Harney left for Washington. Hicks recommends neutrality. Many persons from Maryland taking refuge in Virginia with negroes. northeern troops reach Washington in trasports via Potomac. A member of New York Seventh Regiment, at Governor Letcher's house, says many of that regimentrefuse to fight the South. This retiment never inany fight with Baltimoreans. A lman named Boyd shot on the island at Washington by two men for expressing secession sentiments. Ex- president Tyler says Maryland is calling loudly for help. Send all the troops you can spare.
