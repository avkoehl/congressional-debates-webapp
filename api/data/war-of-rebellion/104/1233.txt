MERIDIAN, April 13, 1865.

Lieutenant-Colonel MERIWETHER,

Demopolis:

Report result of your reconnaissance to Cahawba bridge, and send some one to reconnoiter and report condition of railroad from Selma to Montevallo. Keep the rope and go on rapidly with Tombigbee bridge. Have given no instructions to interfere with your operations on that work.

By order of Lieutenant-General Taylor:

W. F. BULLOCK, JR.,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

DEMOPOLIS, ALA., April 13, 1865.

Captain W. F. BULLOCK, Jr.,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Meridian:

Colonel Miller's scouts have been sent down and courier-line established. Couriers have been to Captain Porter, at Prairie Bluff, as required by Captain Morris.

S. JONES,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding Post.

DEMOPOLISH, ALA., April 13, 1865.

Captain JOSEPH PORTER,

Prairie Bluff, Ala.:

CAPTAIN: Lieutenant-General Taylor directs that you immediately impress wagons and equipage to the nearest point on the Selma and Demopolish Railroad. Let me hear from you by return of courier. Inform me of your progress, so that I may communicate it to General Taylor at Meridian, as he is desirous of hearing from you at the earliest moment, as is also Captain Mossis. The trains are running from here to Marion as is also Captain Mossis. The trains are running from here to Marion Junction and Cahawba bridge. You are doubtless aware of the evacuation of Mobile by our forces.

Very respectfully,

S. JONES,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding Post.

DEMOPOLIS, ALA., April 13, 1865.

Major S. HILLYER,

Assistant Quartermaster, Marengo Country, Ala.:

MAJOR: Your communication of the 11th to General Armstrong is before me. He is gone with his command to Crawfordville. The enemy have all gone east from Selma. Captain Graham has gone to his post. I think the best thing you can do will be to make the best of your way thence with all the teams. I heard General Taylor express a desire for your return to hat place several days since. He is now in Meridian. You are aware, I suppose, that we have evacuated Mobile. I have Colonel Miller's scouts between the two rivers and a line of couriers established to bring all possible information of movements on and between the two rivers. The cars run between here and Cahawba bridge. The latter has been burned.

Very respectfully,

S. JONES,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding Post.
