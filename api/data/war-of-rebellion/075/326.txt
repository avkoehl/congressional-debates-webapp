concealing your flanks in the timber. I understand General Howard is moving off on your left. He is ordered in to connect with you. I will re-enforce that flank as soon as General McPherson makes his junction, which is expected this evening. It is useless to look for the flank of the enemy, as he makes temporary breast-works as fast as we travel. We must break his line without scattering our troops too much, and then break through. See that General Stoneman is in close connection with you, but you had better leave General Hovey to cover that point for the present.

Yours, &amp;c.,

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.

General McPHERSON,

Near Dallas, Ga.:

GENERAL: If you can't drive the enemy from his position work to your left, so as to connect with Hooker. We are working on the left of the line in front of us, and as soon as you are in communication with Hooker I will strengthen the left and work round by that direction, so we may, if we choose, march round their extreme right and reach Marietta or Acworth.

Yours, &c.,

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
