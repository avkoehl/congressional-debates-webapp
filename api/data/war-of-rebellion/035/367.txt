MEMPHIS, May 27, 1863-9 p. m.

General ROSECRANS:

No official dispatches from Vicksburg since my last to you. The city is closely invested. Nothing can save it except a heavy force attacking Grant in the rear. Our batteries are playing all day and night. It is believed the works at Vicksburg are so strong that assault is out of the questions. It has been tried without good success. I think the city must have fallen by to-day. Will advise you as soon as anything comes.

S. A. HURLBUT,

Major-General.
