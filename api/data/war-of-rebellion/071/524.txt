(Received 1. 35 p. m.)

General HALLECK, Chief of Staff:

At 3 o'clock this morning Averell was at Greencastle. At 5. 30 a. m. the rebels, estimated at not than 800, with artillery, entered Chambersburg after a brisk fight. Since then no communication with that town. You have the number of my troops in the Valley in my dispatch of the 28th instant, less casualties. I have no knowledge of Hunter's position.

D. N. COUCH,

Major-General.

WASHINGTON, July 30, 1864-1. 15 p. m.

Major General D. N. COUCH,

Carlisle or Harrisburg, Pa.:

Can you give any definite information of the enemy's force which entered Chambersburg? Was it a cavalry raid or the main army?

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.

HARRISBURG, PA., July 30, 1864.

(Received 4. 30 p. m.)

Major-General HALLECK, Chief of Staff:

It was a cavalry raid, consisting of about 1,000 cavalry and two pieces of artillery. I don't consider that the main force of the enemy has crossed into Maryland.

Honorable E. M. STANTON, Secretary of War:

In order to get forces quickly for this department it is believed that the States must call them for State service to repel the invaders. If this is done to-day shall I consider myself authorized to furnish them all supplies and transportation that may be needed?

D. N. COUCH,

Major-General.

WAR DEPARTMENT,

July 30, 1864-9. 40 p. m.

Major-General COUCH, Harrisburg:

You are not only authorized, but it is your duty to furnish transportation and supplies for such troops as it may be necessary to send to any point for the purpose of repelling the invasion, if in your judgment the troops or material are necessary to that end.

By order of the Secretary of War:

JAS. A. HARDIE,

Colonel and Inspector-General.
