In pursuance of he plan suggested in my last dispatches the fleet under the command of Rear-Admiral Farragut made the contemplated effort for the successful passage of the river batteries at Port Hudson on Saturday evening, the 14th instant. The fleet consisted of the flagship Hartford, Monongahela, Richmond, and Mississippi, with a gunboat lashed upon the port side of the first three maned vessels. The Essex (iron-clad), Sachem, and six mortar-boats held position below the forts, enfilanding by their fire the lower batteries.

The fleet moved from Baton rouge on Friday evening at 4 o'clock, and anchored below Port Hudson until 8 o'clock on Saturday evening, when it commenced the contemplated movement, and at 11.30 o'clock
