HEADQUARTERS CAVALRY WEST OF ALABAMA,Starkville, Miss., February 25, 1864.

Brigadier General W. H. JACKSON,

Commanding, &amp;c.:

GENERAL: Generel Lee's headquarters will, for the present, be at Macon. He directs that you will at once establish a courier-line, consisting of three at a post, from your headquarters to Newtonville, near the line of Attala and Winston Counties, there to connect with General Forrest's line to Macon. During the general's absence you will assume command of Brigadier-General Ferguson's division, as well as of your own. He wishes you to take immediate steps for collecting all stragglers from your command and restoring them to duty.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WILLIAM ELLIOTT,

Assistant Adjutant and Inspector General.

P. S.-The general wishes you to send scouts above, as well as below, Vicksburg for the purpose of ascertaining and reporting in which direction General Shermahn's army is sent.

Very respectfully,

WILLIAM ELLIOTT,

Assistant Adjutant and Inspector General.

It would be very agreeble to me to comply with your wish in relation to General Anderson, but circumstanbces in Florida render his local knowledge and influence there essential.*

Lieutenant General J. LONGSTREET,

Morristown, Tenn.:

General Johnston telegraphed yesterday that enemy had been skirmishing most of the day within three miles and a half Dalton; forces and plans not developed. A concentration against you is therefore doubtful, as mentioned in your letter of the 22d.+

Major General DABNEY H. MAURY,
