AUGUST 30, 1862-2.06 p. m.

Major-General PORTER,

Commanding Corps:

GENERAL: Our skirmishers report two batteries in position on the hill from which they fired at us this morning, and one battery on our left (their right of that.) The enemy seemed to be swinging around to their right (out left). The skirmishers' fire of the enemy crosses the position occupied by Roberts' brigade. I would not advise the posting of artillery anywhere here near the present position of the division until the enemy are driven from our right. Don's know that I would then, not understanding the ground beyond.

Respectfully,

BUTTERFIELD,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

P. S.-One regiment of enemy on right, near their battery in the open.

[AUGUST 30, 1862.]

General MCDOWELL.

I fear for the result, unless you push Sigel up. Our right is also attached.

F. J. PORTER,

Major-General, Commanding.

AUGUST 31, 1862.

Generals MORELL and SYKES:

We stay here, by orders from above, to fight the enemy wherever he may be, or if he comes to us. Therefore do your best to make yourselves comfortable, and also all your command. Send your horses, and pack as much forage as possible for them, if you can find it. There is no more retreating until whipped again.

F. J. PORTER.

WATERY MOUNT, [August -, 1862]-9.15 a. m.

Major BARSTOW:

All quiet. No infantry in sight. Only two sections of artillery been firing on us.

THOROUGHFARE MOUNTAIN,

Monday, [August -, 1862]-9.15 a. m.

ROWLEY:

The left flank of the enemy is on the Orange Court-House road, west of Slaughter Hill. They have a strong position, the same as two days ago in a. m. Judge by their camp smoke they have two columns-one on the Orange Court-House road and the other on the other side of the ridge next to the Rapidan River. I cannot see the forces that are engaged; part of their train was moved toward Orange Court-House this a. m. Will report any change.

SPENCER.
