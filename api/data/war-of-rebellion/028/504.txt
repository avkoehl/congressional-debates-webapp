The other regiment of his at Red House will move forward early in the morning to join the two regiments here. Meanwhile the two regiments of his brigade which are now at Poca will, without waiting for the regiment from Red House, move forward, with a six-gun battery, on the mountain road. In the morning further orders will be given you, for the instruction of the brigade commandants.

WASHINGTON, October 29, 1862-11.15 a. m.

Major-General McCLELLAN:

Your dispatches of night before last, yesterday, and last night all received. I am much pleased with the movement of the army. When you get entirely across the river, let me know. What do you know of the enemy?

A. LINCOLN.

QUARTERMASTER-GENERAL'S OFFICE, Washington City, October 29, 1862.

Lieutenant Colonel R. INGALLS,

Chief Quartermaster, Headquarters Army of the Potomac:

The rolling stock for the Manassas Gap Railroad is being collected. They report that enough for its use will be here. General Sigel's scouts report the read in good running order to Front Royal, but I fear there is some mistake in this.

All the clothing, including blankets, called for by late requisitions has been ordered forward. Most of it was on hand here; some, however, was ordered from Philadelphia and New York to supply deficiencies. Horse-overs are not an article of supply under the regulations, and I doubt very much the propriety of encumbering our already overloaded cavalry with one thousand heavy horse-overs to a regiment.

I am, respectfully, your obedient servant,

M. C. MEIGS,

Quartermaster-General.

DEPOT OF ARMY CLOTHING AND EQUIPAGE, Washington, I. C., October 29, 1862.
