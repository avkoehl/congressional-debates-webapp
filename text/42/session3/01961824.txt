June 30,1874. The Committee on Appropria-
tions recommend that the House concur in
the amendments of the Senate. The only sub-
stantial amendment made by the Senate is

bers of the Board of Visitors at the next an-
nual examination to be held at the Military
Academy at West Point, three members of
the House of Representatives of the Forty-

mittee on the Credit Mobilier Company. The
gentleman from Massachusetts [Mr. Btttler]
is entitled to the floor for tfhe hour.
Mr. HANKS. With the consent of the
gentleman from Massachusetts, [Mr. Butler,]
I will move that the rules be suspended so as
to admit to the floor of the House, in rear of
the seats of members, those ladies now in the
corridors who have been unable to obtain seats
in the galleries.
Mr. RANDALL. I would not object to
that, provided I could be informed whether
amendments were to be offered to-night to
this report and considered and acted upon.
