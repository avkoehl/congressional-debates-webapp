July, 1841:
'APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
201
27th Cong.•••1st Sess.
Fiscal Bank—Mr. Benton.
Senate.
these, now considered as essentialities of "sound"
banking wi'l be scouted and scorned.
My opinion is that this subject should not be
touched until the new Congress, under the new
census, corner into place. That will be m the
winter of 1843 4 If at that time, and after a fu'1
and fair reference to the people, trie establishment
of the bink shall be resolved upon by a fair ma-
jority, I may afierwards let it alone: I m"y be
quiescent, and 'tt it live out us appointed time.
But, if passed now, m the present conditio! of the
chamber, and m the face ot all the formidable rea-
sons whicn forbad its passagt; if passed under
these circumstances, I declare war upon it, and
devote myself, regardless of all earthly conse-
quence', to lfa utter destruction
(|Ef Since the delivery of this speech, the
"comprcrmse" amendment was adopted, the cha-
racter of which, and the manner of gett ng it
through the Senate, and thereby passing ih  bill,
furnish a new reason for applying the repeal re-
medy 1
Havmg mentioned the remedy of  repeal as ihe
proper remedy for this act of legislation, so wrorg
in itself and so wrongfully pressed through at  this
ex ra se«s on, Mr. B wi it on to declare himselt in
favor of ¡he repealaoility of public and poliucal
cbaiters in general, and in favor of the applica'ion
of that decirme to this fi cal charier in  parlieular
Without going into the general question, he wou'd
say something in relation lo this particular institu-
tion, which, for the power to create it, its specific
nature, its peculiar character, ard special objects,
stood discriminated from all oihT chattels granted
either by Congress or the State Legislatures  Leav-
ing all others out et view, as only embarrassing
with extranet us matter a prop n ion wmeh is s n-
gle in itself, and dípendmg upon its own pnn<*i-
ples, he wou d say tint the chi'ter for th'    fiscal
B«n   was jjstat.   ¡epeal Je as   an>  otn-r  law
whicii Ci tigress might pass for th*  collection, safe
keeping, and aisbuisement of the public moneys
It was a law fot that purpose, and g vmg it  the
form of a charter, and admitting individuals into
partnership with the Government, if in'ended to
perpetuate the law, was a fiaud, and, whether so
intended or not, the charter and  the stockholders
were nothing but mcidpnts to  the mam act, and
could no' stand without it    Th- ooaer of Con-
gress    is    to     provide    a    fiscjlitj—a   fiscal
agent— or     the    assistance  of    tne   Treasury,
and tin* ageHcy is subject to  the con tant control
and maeaxemeht of C ir-gre^s    Congress createo
it when it pleases, abolishes it when it pleases, . nd
creates ano her «hen it please . Tois is the power
of Congce^and thus the D~mocraey act    T.,ey
make thai agency a Sub Treasury, they do tt by
a   imple act, and this is rc-pealafele, but the  Fede-
ralists, faithful to their principles of monopoly,
exclusive privilege , and m narch cal machinery to
giverrand  pluader th-  ppople,   mu>t five that
agency the form of a bank, witn ihe chii.ercd pri-
vilege of being a Nat onal Treasury, an 1 with the
right to issue a national currency, and to  p>y the
nauonal revenues   with 'heir own pnp-r   u nt-y.
Ail th s is a violan n of the Constitution, and   a
fraud upon legislation, and must be  Heated with
the contempt which  an uneonsututiona'ity ¿ml a

They are inciden al and t,uboid nate to ihe nam

cWired privileges, cm aspi e, and no*, o at-
tempt to come m a  principals, and place th m-
•elves m front of the Treasury agenc>, a 1  say
that we cinnot touch that, because they are here,
to attempt to do this is both impertinent andfraudu-
!ent and shall receive the ¡ate which traud and
impudence deserve.   We will crush   them   like
«lass    Here is a a war of life and death between
ths Pederalis s ?nd Democrats. This Bank is a
WAR MEASURE upon the Democracy—- n end-
ed to crush and des'roy die i. It is tne Trojan
horse of Federalism, its belly fi'led, not with h°roes,
and princes, and ¡he arms of noo e war, but filled
wit's jobbers, and swindlers, and all the implements
of national plunder and publ.e demjral zation. To
suppose that we are going ¡o submit !o ¡his war
measure, and admit within our walls this traitorous
hor¡,e, is lo suppo e us more silly than the Tr< jans
of old, and as senseless as the Egyptians, who suf
fered their country to be invaded and conqjered
without resistances, because the invading Persians
placed ¡he deified animals of Eg} pt—cats, dogs,
and sheep—at the head oí their columns The be-
sotted E¿yptians could not strike their invaders for
fear of kil'mg their gods But we, in 'his nine-
teenth centnrj of the Cnr stian era, have no idea
that these Bank stockholders sre deities, and it
they place tlsems^lveo between ns and our enemies
m this combat of life and death, they may expect
to be cut up and killed up, „s the feline and canine
an-mals now would be thai snouU pLce themselves
between two armies
I do not p-opose, Mr. Pre ident, to argue this
question of repeal no* the proper time for ¡hat
wul be af'er the chnrter ^h^li have passed, and ihe
bill to repeal it shi 1 be brou_ht m Thit will be

intention lo repeal, now they have full warning of

M
political engine, now it is an open and pubiie war
measure up m the Democracy The" t .e Supreme
Judiciary was Pedeial, now it is Rep*.bl can Then
ihe Demicraey was}Oung, aad vtas, Mi.matized
as destroyers and levellers, and cou d not repeal an
unconftitutional and jiestilent charier, wi hout en-
couraging that imputation, now it is of ripe age,
and vigorous, and despises a foul and calumnious
imputation. For these reasons, th- f¡ rbssrance
which was "wisest" in 1801, won'd be s l'y and
suicidal in 1841. Tne re is not one eaualy reason
for the Bank now, which waa urged e ner n 1791
or 1816 There is no color of nece^iiy fur it The
InJepenáent Treasury is in operation—¿t this mo-
ment in opeiaHon—doing the busines, of the Trea-
sury better and cheaper than it  a> ever dene be-
fore The Bank is now an op-n warrr^asuie upon
the Democracy, and as such it must dj met and
fought.
Proceeding wuh my quotations o ititnority, I
next cite ihe vote of General H«>r 'son in i->vor of
repealing, by law, the charter oí ihe late Bank of
tt,e Via ed S a'es, givti w the H uot ot R presen-
tatives, with thirty other members, in f toruary,
1819
Tne next au honty I shall quo e is t* ¿\ cf both
Gentral Haruson, and Mi T}ler, the \ tsent Pre-
si *ent, who at the same time, an i with   e«i forty
other members, voted in favor of usutn , ,i «ctre/a-
cuts to annul ttie charter of the Bank by a judicial
proof eJm?.
The fourih ard last authority wh eh I sha 1 tow
c te in lavorof this repeal rg power, is that of ihe
decision of the Supreme Cuun of the United States
m favor oi the eonstiiut.rnaiiiy < f the Bank, in
the ci e of M Culloch ¡ nl ¡he 8 at< o  ttlarjland,

this necessity, Congress is the sole judge Th s
decides the whole ejue-tion it leaves ail to Gon-

it to be unnecessary to the G-vewient. Neces-
sity is the only plea for its creation, eloquently
must be the oniy plea for its co itm • nee. Oi the
