The works about the W. Davis house are full of men; probably the force that advanced this a. m. Troops are moving upon the plank road toward our left, but the fog is so dense that we can neither determine their character nor numbers.

The enemy are advancing a skirmish line upon our right of the railroad. We cannot see any line in rear of it, but the woods would hide it if there was a line.
