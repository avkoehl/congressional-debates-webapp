By Mr. KING: From citizens of Alabama, in-
tending to migrate to the Oregon Territory. The
memorialists desire to go by the Isthmus as the
best route, and ask that arrangements may be
made by the Government to pro ect them under the
laws of the United States when they reach there
Mr. K. said many of the memorialists wer  per-
sona'ly known to him, and were men of worth
He did not think that any action could be had on
the memorial at this session, but early at the next
session he would feel it his duty to take the m?t-
ter up.
Mr. LINN was glad to hear the remarks of the
Senator from Alabama. There were now upwards
of a thousand American citizens in the Territory
of Oregon, subjected entirely to the laws of th"
Hudson Bay Company He Mr L had lately
seen a gentleman from that region who gave him a
glorious account of the tetllemcnt, its prosperous
and happy condition, &c. The memorial was laid

sent extra session of Congress was entirely uncalled
for by the public merest
Mr C said, he heartily concurred m the sei-
t íments expressed in these resolutions. He con-
sidered the Bank charter of this extra session no-
thing less than the entering wedge of ihe American
system It was not his intention to accompany
these resolutions with any lengthy remarks of his
own. It had been asserted with seeming confi-
dence, as if undeniable, from the very beginning
of this extra session, that ihe people of the United
Sta is had at the late Presidential election decided
the question of a National Bank This he wholly
den ed the people of Virginia, North Carolina,
and several other States, denied it The great
body of the peop'e of the United States were not
m favor of any National Bank, in many of the
States there is a violent opposition to any measure
of the kind
Mr HENDERSON rose to notice one expre- -
sion in tnis petition, which he had also noticed in
several others, which no Sena'or had undertook to
sustain by his argument—it had become a hack-
neyed phi ase m these pe ti tun*—viz the unconsti-
tutionality of a National Bank, and lhat the ques-
tion of its conitilutio íality was raised in the con-
vention that fiamed the Constitution This asser-
tion he denied, and should be ready to defend his
position when the subject should be d^cussed
Mr CLAY of Alabama said he could not con-
sent to lei die remaiks which had just fallen from
.he Senator from Mississippi [Mr Henderson]
pass altogether without no ice and uncontroverted
He ".aid he had, with no little surprise, heard that
Senator deny lhat the proposition had been made
in the convention which framed the Conshtu ion,
to give Congress the power to create a National
Bank Tne Senator from Mississnpi al'eged lhat
though it had been often asserted that such a pro-
position had been made in the convention and re-
jected, no one had attempted here to sustain the
tact by proof, and he insisted that ihe assertion
must be unfounded Now he (Mr C,) had heard
this declaration uith some astonishment, fir, on a
former occasion, h bad, himself, adverted t® the
subject, and hau adduced wast he considered very
satis/ictoty evidente m support of t if r>"opooition

Mr HENDERSON replied it cmil
Mr CLAY replied, thmsh ihere might oe pn
vale bankers, rr private bankir j companies, with-
OJt an  act of incorporation,  that h<- had never
known a publk, institution of the kind which was
not a corporation That was the understanding of
the whole country now, and it was equally so
when the ConstnuPon was adopted, as would suf-
ficiently appear by a portion of its history, which
he would presently bring to the notice of the Se-
nate He said the Bank established m 1791 was
a corporation—so was that which was established
in 1816—and the bill which had pas-sd the Senate
the other day, also, created a corporation, to be
called the "Fiscal Bank of the United States " In-
deed, every attempt here ofbre made to establish a
National Bank had been by acts of mcorporat on—
no other plan, so far as he (Mr C ) was advised,
had been attempted by Congre s in more than half
a century j
Mr C said Mr Madison had, m the first place,
submitttd a proposition, in the convention, to give
Congress the power to create corporations, amongst
various o'her powers, some of which had been
adopted, and now composed parts of the Constitu-
tion, but the committee to whom the subject was
referred, had repudiated the pov er in question and
refused to give it their sanction. At a subsequent
stage of the session, the same gentleman moved to
grant the same power, by way of amendment to a
motion which had been made by Dr Franklin,
j and, as the subject was one of d ep and pervading
interest, Mr C said he would detain the Sánate
by reading the account given of i> by Mr. Madison
himself He then read from the 3d volume of the
Madron papers,page , 1576 and 1577, asfollows
Dr Fianklm moved to add after ihe words post roads,'
article 1, section 8 a power 'to provide for cutting canals
where deemed necessary'
' Mi Wilson seconded the motion
Mi Sherman objected The expensem such cases willfatl
on the United ¡states and the benefit acci ue to the places where
the canals may be cut
Mr Wilson Instead of being an ex¡ ense to the Uniied
¡Stales they may be made asouive of revenue
Mr Madison suggested an enlargement of the motion into a
power 'to grant chartersofincorporation where the interest of
the United states might require, and the legislative piovisions
of individual States may be incompetent' His primary object
was however to secuie an easy communication between the
¡states, which the free intercoms now to be opened seemed to
call for Ihe political obstacles bemsr remove! a removal of
the natural ones, as far as po sible ought to lollow
Mr Randolph seconded ti t proposition
Mi King though the power unnecessary
Mr Wilson It is necessaiy to pttvent a State from oh
stiuctinn the general welfare
Mr King Ihe ¡states wilt be prejudiced and divided into
parties by it In Philaleljhia an! New \oik it will be re
tened to the esta lishment ofa Bank which has, been a subject
of contention in tho&e cine  In othet places it wi 1 be referred
to mercantile monopolies
Mr Witson mer uotied the importance of facilitating byca
na!s the communica ion with the western settlements As to
hanks he did not tbink with Mr Kinsr that ihe power in that
point of view would excite the prejudices and parties appre
hended As to mercantile monopolies they aie already m
eluded in the power to regulate trade
Cot   Mason wasfoi limiting the power to the single case of
canals    He was afrai 1 of monopolies of everv sort  which he
dil (totthmk were by any means already implied by the Con
stitutlon as supposed by Mr Wilsi n

"This n otion by Di Fiankhn not stated m the punted jour
nal as are some other motions
Mr Clay then remarked, it cou d no longer
be contioverted, that it had oeen proposed m the
fomi'on to give Congiesa the powfr "to grant
chattels of incorporation," and it was equally
clear that it was understood by t is members of
of that enligh ened bodv, that the power to "rant
charters of incorpon'ion did irciud- the power to
create a National Bink.
