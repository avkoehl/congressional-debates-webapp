directed the quartermaster of the Fourth Brigade to "do his best to keep the train well closed." At the point of its capture during the progress of the battle this quartermaster asked Lieutenant-Colonel Chandler, chief quartermaster of the army, if he had not better move his train back. He replied, "No; my must not turn a single wagon. If you lose your wagons lose them facing the enemy." I transmit, marked C,* statement of this quartermaster. During the battle Captain H. Hoge, division quartermaster,w as directed by an officer of General Banks' staff and an officer of General Franklin's staff not to move the wagons, as it would impede the advance of the infantry. Near the train the Third Brigade, Colonel Robinson commanding, was deployed and did good service in checking the enemy, Colonel Robinson being himself seriously wounded. The detachment of the Nineteenth Army Corps was soon meant, deployed across the road, and my troops with others formed behind it. The enemy's advance was checked, and during the night the entire force fell back to Pleasant Hill. On this day the First Brigade, Colonel Lucas commanding, lost, killed, 11; wounded, 57; missing, 83; total loss, 151. The Fourth Brigade, Colonel Dudley commanding, lost 17 killed; wounded, 143; missing, 83; total loss, 212. Two companies only of the Fifth Brigade were engaged inn this action, Companies K an D, Eighteenth New York Cavalry, Captain William Davis commanding, having been detailed as escort to General Ransom; they wee left without orders, and reported to Colonel Lucas, of First Brigade, who assigned them to duty. They acquitted themselves well. Their loss was, killed, 2; wounded, 9; missing, 2; total loss, 13. The Third Brigade, Colonel Robinson commanding, lost, killed, 2; wounded, 10; missing, 7; total loss, 10. Nims' battery lost, killed 1; wounded, 18; total loss, 20. Sixth Missouri Howitzer Battery lost, wounded, 3. Rawles' battery (Battery G, Fifth U. S. Artillery) lost, killed, 5; wounded, 10; total loss, 15 men.

April 9, detachments of 500 men each from First and Fifth Brigades were ordered to report to General Franklin. Colonel Lucas, commanding First Brigade, was detached, with Sixteenth Indiana Mounted Infantry, Sixth Missouri Cavalry, and Fourteenth New York Cavalry. They participated in the battle at Pleasant Hill, as did the detachment of Fifth Brigade. The Sixteenth Indiana, in a charge on the left (dismounted), captured the flag of the First Brigade on the 9th was, killed, 1; wounded, 4; total loss, 5. The detachment Fifth Brigade lost in wounded 21 men; in missing, 2 men; total, 23. With the remainder of the division and General Cameron's detachment of Thirteenth Army Corps, I was ordered to escort the army train to Grand Ecore, which was successfully done, arriving at that place on the evening of the 10th instant. During the period covered in this report the total known loss of the Cavalry Division was, killed, officers and men, 51; wounded, officers and men, 317; missing, officers and men, 155; total known loss, 523.

It would be difficult in this report to mention ind tail the names of officers who particularly acquitted themselves with credit during these days. With scarcely an exception their conduct was deserving of the highest praise. I desire, however, to mention Colonel T. J. Lucas, Sixteenth Indiana Mounted Infantry, commanding First Brigade, as an officer on whom I learned to repose the most perfect
