for construction parties, &amp;c. I have to request that you will also have these detachments relieved as soon as practicable, so that they can rejoin their regiments. Mr. Wentz, superintendent, or Mr. McCrickett, assistant superintendent, of the road, have been directed to inform you where these details are posted.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

I have a strong party out from the First Division with directions to go to Robertson River. Will it answer to delay the party ordered to Thoroughfare Mountain and beyond until this party gets back? The party will return by Waylandsburg, and may bring information. Please answer.

Very respectfully,

P. H. SHERIDAN,

Major-General, Commanding.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff, Army of the Potomac:

The party sent out to Robertson River this morning has just returned. They went out via James City and returned south of Thoroughfare Mountain. They found no enemy on this side of the river, but report about 50 men at Russell's Ford, Robertson River.

P. H. SHERIDAN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS CAVALRY CORPS,April 27, 1864.

Brigadier-General TORBERT,

Commanding First Division, Cavalry Corps:

GENERAL: The major-general commanding directs me to inform you that Major-General Meade has sent word that the enemy have infantry at Wolftown, west of Madison Court-House, and directs that a party be sent out via Thoroughfare Mountain to ascertain if such is the case; that the party shall go as far as Robertson River, and perhaps Madison Court-House, to see what information can be picked up. General Sheridan notified General Meade of the party which went to Robertson River to-day, but unless it went on the Thoroughfare road to Robertson River he directs that you send a second party at once sufficiently strong to make it safe, the object being to collect information.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. W. FORSYTH,

Chief of Staff.
