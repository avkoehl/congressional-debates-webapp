Assistant Adjutant-General, Goldsborough:

One of my scouts just returned. The other has gone into Wilmington. The enemy have crossed troops to the opposite side of Cape Fear; camps are considerable. No boats have been up the river. Evidences of a march up Cape Fear on opposite side. Will inform you fully when other scouts return. Engines and cars on Manchester road.

HEADQUARTERS,Duplin Road, February 28, 1865. (Received 11 p. m.)

Colonel ANDERSON,

Goldsborough:

If Sherman continued to his right he would soon get to a point on the Manchester road, and having stock on that road could soon throw his troops to Wilmington from this point. He could demonstrate into the interior and throw his troops to Grant. I know nothing of his movements, and only suggest this, thinking that Grant might suppose he could overwhelm General Lee by overwhelming numbers.

R. F. HOKE,

Major-General.
