What the committee thus spoke of as possible
and probable in 1826, has become sobei íeality
in 1839, while there is added (what did not then
enter the conceptions of the prophets.) Tammany

But, Mi Chairman, theie is another branch of
this machinery which is not less petfee'ly oigan
lzed, and not less completely within the control
of the central powei I mean the affiliated paity
press of the countiy Is it determined by the
President, with the advice of the select political
cabal, that any new party movement shall be
made ' A messenger in. dispatched, the editor of
the Globe appears, (though he is undeistood to
be generally piesent as one of the adviseis')
instiucuons are given, and the Globe moves
Straigntway there is a coirespondmg and simul
taneous movement in the paity press in Vermont,
m Pennsylvania, mGcoigia, and in the far West
Public sentiment is manufactuied, as the cotton
is taken fiom the bale, in the lower stoiy, and
comes out a peifectweb in the upper Lveiy
editor and every executive officer knows his place,
knows what is expected of him, and knows he
shall be " shot foi deseition " No military gov-
ernment was ever more absolute, no machinery
v/as ever moved with apiecision more perfect.
Wondei is oftei expiessed that, with the most
powei ful means, sofai as tl ere is power in tiuth,
(alas,1 it is too often powcness,) the Opposition
aie able to rrake so bulo impteasion, and are so
often defeated when victory seems certain Here,
sir, is the secret The President and his men un-
ueistand it, and, while the Whigs talk of prin
ciple, they laugh at its inefficacy when b.ought
into conflict with their party machineiy Mi

1 EXECUTIVE I\FUTE\CE AND TIIE EXPUNGlKG RESO-
LUTION
,     You remember, sir, the celebiated case of the
I deposits.   The Piesident " took the responsibil-
, lty," and the pabhc Tieasury moved at his bid-
j ding    The Senate, alarmed at the high handed
! usurpation of power, determined to rebuke it, and
l passed a resolution of censure.    The President
sent mem a protest, in which he asbtited piinci
pies and set up claims to power which made him
little to an absolute monaich
I     But he was not content with a p-otest     He
I could not rest on the sobei, dehbeiate judgment
j of his countiymen    He must have present satis
¡ faction ' The Senate had offended him, and they
. must be humbled, and the iecoid of the obnox
¡ lous íesohition expunged    But how should it be
| done' How should sucha lesult be accomplished5
Su, the means were not wanting    Paity oigani-
I zauon supplied them     Instiucuons fiom biate
Legislatuics could accomplish the end, and party
machineiy was adequate to their pi oduction   The
i President willed it   and the íesult showed that
his will, oy a mysteiious process, became the law
of legislative action in numerous States of the
I Union
Foi three years was this process going on
Fiomyeai to year the ixpungingiesolution snug-
gled in the Senate, under the ovei whelming argu-
ments, which weie uiged against it On one oc-
casion (Maich, 1835) the expunging words were
stricken Irom the itsolution by a vote of39u>7,
upon which Mi Webster, m addressing the
Senate, said
1 i e utempt to induce the Senate to expunge its Jour
nal ha i iiiod— ign illv and eft uu Uly 1 uled lherecoid
rem mi—nuiher binned blotted nor disgraced "
Would to Heaven, sn, that it had thus still
remtimd The attempt to blot and disgrace it
failed, signally indeed, but not finally Execu-
tive influence was too string foi the most unan-
svveiuble constitutional aiguments The State
Ligislatuics weie suuounded and pressed with
it Many resisted, but many yielded, and Sen
atois who, m 1835, had voted lo strike fiom the
expunging resolution Us matei ial wruds, and ren-
der it a nullity, weie, two years afteiwaids, in-
duced to yield to the Piesident's wishes,and vote
lo expunge a lecord which the Constitution hud
commanded them to " Keep " Sir, i was in the
Senate Chamber when the final vote on that res-
olution was passed I heard the i espouses to the
call ot the yeas and nays, and saw the result of
the thiee yeais' Executive war upon the mde
pendence of that body It was a disgiaceful and
humiliating spectacle, and seemed almost to lm
press upon the very image of the Father of his
Country, as it looked down fiom the canvas, an
expression of mingled soirow, amazement, and
indignaron Theie stood the Senator who, "sol
Hary and alone," had, thiee years befoie, " ¡>Pt
that ball in motion," swelling in tuumph at the
successful result of Executiv influence and p irty
machineiy, and there sat the subdued and the
humbled, who had been made, through that in
fluence, the unwilling mstiuments of accomplish
ing the designs of " the great expungei '"
The vote had passed, the resolution was adopt
ed It was a moment of thrilling interest The
Secretary brought into the Senate the doomed
record, and there executed the sentence by which
it was " blurred, blotted, and disgraced   '
Mr   Chairman, what a redemption from the
disgiace of that scene might, at that moment,
have been achieved'    It was in the power of a
single man     And why did he not seize upon it'
Why did he not íally the energies of a soul in
dignant at tl e high handed outrage which was 1
about to  be  committed, and nobly and sternly ]
íefusc to become the instrument of its peipetia
tion >   Why did not the Secretary stand up, m |
the midst of the scene, and say to the Piesi lent f
of that body, " Sn, I cannot, I mutf not, do this
deed   My h ind can never hold the pen thatblurs
and blots the íecord  I have swoin to 'keep '
Take fion n e my office, corsign me to beggaiy
if you will   bat do not requue no to disiegaid  |
my official oath, and violate the Constitution of .
my courfv      My di ly has been to tnis moment,
and &1U1 continue   o be, faithfu"y perfoimed,  j
but, come what will, thai deed I u>miot, I must
not, I will not do '"
What a sublime example of self sacrificing de-
votion to principle -would have been thus* exhib-
ited ' Sir, I would rather, so- far as persons!
gratification is concerned, have occupied the posi-
tion of that officer at that moment, than to be
President of the United States to the end of my
life There would have been more true glory m
such a refusal than in a hundred military victo-
ries, and the laurels which would have adorned
his brow would have remained fresh When the
name of cue connected with that transaction shall
have been consigned to execration and infamy.
But, Mi Chan man, there was one redeeming
act connected with that scene. It was the act of
the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts,
who rose, as the final vote upon the resolution
was about to be taken, and in the name of him-
self and his colleague, read to the Senate their
solemn protest against it. Sir, it was a noble
sight'—the Senator standing up, with lus erect
form and manly bearing, and declaring to the
Senate and the world, in the calm dignity of con-
scious uprightness and truth, the great piinciples
of the Constitution, which forbid the des&that
was about to be committed
But, sit, the exposition of constitutional prin-
ciples Was not the only feature of the protest
which gave it interest It declared, with a be-
coming plainness and directness, the true origin"
of the influence which was then about tof carry
the expunging resolution     It says
" We have seen with deep regret and sincere pain the
legislatures of respectable ¡States mstiuctingthe Si fiatora
of tliOse States to vote for and support tills violation of the
Journal 01 t le senate, and tins pain is infinitely increased
by our lull belief and entire conviction Unt most, it not ail
these proceedings of States had their origin m promptings
from Washington that they have been urgently requested
and in i led on, as being necessary to the iccomphshment
ot the intended purpose , and that ií w nothing else but the
influent e an I po c? of the executu e branch of tins Govern
ment which lias 1 rollout the Legislatun s of so many of the
fr< e States of th s Union to quit the sphere of their ordi-
nary duties lor the purpose ot cooperating to accomplish a
meisuie, in our judgment, so unconstitutional, so derog
alorv to tin. character of the Senate, and makked with so
UrtOAD AN IMPRESSION OF COVIPMaNCE WITH POWfcR     Bllt
tins resolution is to pass We e\pt ct it Thatcanse which
has been powulul enough to infi uence so many State
Lfoislaturps, will show itself powerful enough, espe-
ciiliv witii sue i aids, to secure the passage of the resolu-
tion here "
Thus, sir, did the Senator from Massachusetts,
at a moment of intense interest, and under cir-
cumstances of peculiar responsibility, stand up,
in the face of the Senate and the world, and sol-
emnly declare his "full belief and entire convic-
tion" that it was the influence and power of the
executive branch of this Government which had
brought the Legislatures of so many of the States
to quit the sphere of then ordinary duties to aid
in cariying into effect the will of the President in
the measuie then about to be consummated
And whatreply was made to this chaige * Was
it answered ' Was theie anv attempt to answer
it' No, su Every expunging Senaioi cowered
undei its withering rebuke All felt its justice,
foi its tiuth had been written on almost eveiy
page of oui piecedmg three years' political his
lory The " promp'ings " had been visible to
evei y intelligent observer None could deny their
leahty—none did deny it—none dared deny it
Thus, Mr Chan man, have I glanced at the
four years'warfare upon the "puie" Adtninis-
tiation—at the pietended apprehensions, by the
"put down " conspiratois, of dangei fiom the
abuse of Executive patronage—their extreme so-
licitude lest the puuty of Congiess should be as-
sailed by the appoi ument of its members to office
—thou fesus that conuption would become the
order ofthe day—Jicn alaim at the pretended dis-
eoveiy of extravagance—their grand piepaiations
for ¡eticrchment, as soon as they could have tho
cooperation of tho Executive, and the pledges of
the President that he would lespect " diligence,
talenis,ard integiay," n his appointments—see
that power should not be placed 11 " unfaithful
or incompetent ha^ds," a id take care that liisi
pdtionage should not be abused to party pui-
posis
I have also rem nded the committee of the vio-
lations of all these pledges by the men to whose
han Is a credulous people had been induced to
confide the idnmustntion of thei. Government
And, sir, it is amazing to contemplate the extent
and the openness of these viola-lions    One could
