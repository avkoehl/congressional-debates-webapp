HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF KANSAS,Fort Leavenworth, July 18, 1864.

Colonel FORD,

Kansas City:

Arrived last night. Intelligent men from Ridgeley and Weston report squads of rebels from twenty to fifty strong prowling about Weston and Ridgeley swearing vengeance. They speak of Centreville, Clay County, as a rendezvous. You should have your headquarters at Weston, with, also, forces at Liberty and Parkville, and you need a strong moving force by land and water. You should have all your regiments and more, and have command of the sub-district. I still keep a picket in Weston, and will support you as far as possible.

S. R. CURTIS,

Major-General.

The latest information from Arkansas is that Shelby and McCray have concentrated most of their force at a point on White River below Jacksonport, and are calling to that point all the rebel forces in Northern Arkansas, with the view of cutting General Steele's communication, and that Generals Shelby, McCray and company design making a raid into this State in heavy force in September. Everything is quiet throughout the district now. The farmers are securing a fair crop of grain and hay.
