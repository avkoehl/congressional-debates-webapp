Ordnance Serg. J. Jones, I ordered the balls to be removed from some of the spherical-case shot, which, with the balls fired by the Indians (many of which were collected and recast), was made into ammunition by a party of men and ladies organized for the purpose, who worked night and day until a good supply was obtained.

The buildings composing the garrison proper are still up, but they are very much wrecked. All of the out-buildings, except the guard-house and magazines, are entirely destroyed. Most of the mules and oxen belonging to the quartermaster's department were taken by the Indians, and we are left with a scanty supply of transportation.

I adopted every possible means in my power for the defense, by erecting barricades, covering the store-houses with earth (to guard against fire arrows, several of which were thrown), determined to sacrifice all but the men's quarters and store-house, which are stone buildings.

I also herewith inclose a list of the killed and wounded.*

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

T. J. SHEEHAN,

First Lieutenant Co. C, Fifth Regiment Minn. Vols., Commanding Post.

Numbers 2. Report of Ordnance Sergt. John Jones, U. S. Army.

FORT RIDGELY, MINN., August 26, 1862.

SIR: In compliance with your orders I have the honor most respectfully to submit the following report of the artillery under my command during the attack by the Sioux Indians as this post on the 20th and 22nd of August, 1862:

The alarm was given about 2 p. m. on the 20th; the gun detachments were promptly at their post, and gave much satisfaction, I am sure, to all who witnessed the action. Aided by the small-arms parties, this attack was repelled, and the guns, under their respective chiefs, drove the Indians from the ravines by well-timed shells and spherical-case shot.
