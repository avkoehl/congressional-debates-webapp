HEADQUARTERS CAVALRY IN NORTH MISSISSIPPI,Oxford, Miss., October 21, 1863.

Colonel B. S. EWELL,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

COLONEL: I am credibly informed that while the enemy's forces were endeavoring to concentrate against me in my recent expedition against the Memphis and Charleston Railroad, in addition to other outrages upon the persons and property of unoffending citizens, they made it a point to visit the houses in which I had had my headquarters, and, when they did not entirely consume, to injure them as much as possible by destroying their furniture and clothing, and wantonly wasting their supplies of forage and provisions.

These people had been guilty of no offense except that of extending their hospitality to myself and staff. In addition to this they burned the villages of Wyatt and Chulahoma (the latter without any provocation whatever), and desolated the plantations along their route, burning corn-cribs, &amp;c., and driving off horses and cattle.

I have not been able to capture any of those engaged in the perpetration of these acts, but I would respectfully ask whether some means of retaliation cannot be adopted to prevent the repetition of such outrages.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JAS. R. CHALMERS,

Brigadier-General.
