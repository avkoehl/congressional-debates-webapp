in motion I have to request that you issue an order exempting all State and country officers from draft. I further advise that there is great danger of seriously interfering with railroad transportation unless further exemptions are made of those employed in that service, and would recommend that you instant all the commissioners to exempt from draft such employes of railroads as the several presidents thereof may state, upon honor, are indispensably necessary to the working of their roads.

Governor TOD,

Columbus, Ohio:

An order of exemption of State and county officers, os far sa can be properly done, will be issued before the draft. The question as to railroad employes has been fully considered in conference with some of the principal railroad men, and it is thought better not to make an exemption from draft, but to relieve from duty such indispensable employes as may happen to be drafted. On reflection I think you will agree that this is the better course.
