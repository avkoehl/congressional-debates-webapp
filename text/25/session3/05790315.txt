Maine Boundary Question—Mr. Allen.
Sm#m>
out trespassers, but she cannot retire under this
menace This is the naked state of the facts, and,
unless something is done, New Biunswiclc will
execute her threat's And what is to be •done'
This resolution is one expedient, and it goes on
the ground that if New Brunswick will abstain,
Maine is to retire This will save the honoi of
both sides And what is proposed on the other
Bide' To insist that Maine has now a light to
the possession gentlemen who take that ground
intend war, and it will come And what is an-
other view of the subject taken by one of the
Senators from Massachusetts, [Mr Webster ']
It is, that Maine is not to be known in this affair
any rnoie than a county, and it intimates that
this county canrot be at the same time in the
opposite relations of war and peace, (with the
principal and suboidmates of another power,)
and that we have a light to go and drive off the
Maine forces without consulting Maine at all
I know that all this arises from the Senator's
peculiar views, ot from his political system But
we diffei on these points And although this is
the boundary of the United States, and is so of
Maine, the views of the Senator on these points
must be abhonent to every man who does not
agree with him in his peculiar sentiments
Sir, we must meet this point of honoi, (between
Maine and New Brunswick,) and the committee
have done well to say that New Biunswiclc is to
withdiaw, and then Maine is to withdraw That
is the best proposition
Mr YOUNG now moved to strike out the last
clause of the fourth íesolution, and msi.it
And leave the ultimate adjustment of hpr grievances to
the Government of the United States, to which it right
fully and constitutionally belongs
Mr CALHOUN    Thisis]udieiously worded,
but it will not reach the point     We ask New
Brunswick to abstain  from her avowed dctei m-
lnation, and  if khe  does  this,  Maine ought to
withdiaw     I prefer, therefoie, the original clause
as it came fiom the committee, it is to the point,
and when I heaid the substitute for it, I was still
moie decidedly in its favoi, foi, if that does not
mean  the same thing, it means nothing at all
And we had better not drsguise oui meaning on
the point at issue, it is a point of honor, for
Maine is threatened, and New Biunswiclc has
given the thieat, so that neither can retne unless
we interpose    We theiefore come forward, and, '
after due delibeiation, wo adopt the views of the I
Executive in  this matter     Sir, in this question
is peace or war   There is no safety but in adopt
ing the views of the committee in conjunction
with the opinions of the Executive                         '
Mr  WTBSTFR     It is easy, sir, to say that
any question involves peace oi war, and I do not
know how far anv subject may be circumsciibed |
and nai owed, if it respect our foreign relations,
and yet not incur the charge of involving, by
possibility, peace or war     But I cannot think
that on the question  of this amendment to this
fourth resolution, han_,!> the gieat issue of peace i
Oi Wai     The gentleman calls on me for a sub   I
stitute     I think the resolutions sufficiently ex-
piessivc  without the last clause  of the fouith   I
But, if anything is needed m place of that clause,
1 think that the clause proposed by the Senator
from Illinois [Mr Young] is vastly preferable to
theoiigmil clause, and that it may obtain the
general approbation,and perhaps the unanimous
vote of the Stnate
And what is the diffeience' Sir, it is quite
appaient i he íesolution now says that if the
Bntish authorities shall withdraw their troops,
and Maine shall not withdraw hei s, but undertake
to settle the controversy herself, then this Gov-
e nmont will not be under obligation to sustain
hei by militaiy foice But th< clause proposed
by t ic membei fiom Illinois leaves out all this,
and is&eds the duty and the powei of this Gov-
ernment ovei the whole subject The amend
n entoftne. membei fiom Illinois proposes to add
to the fust branch of the íesolution these woids
' Lea\mn- io the Government of the United Statcb,
to which it properly belongs, the íediess ot her
yi cvanccs " And, 1 jf.k, which reads most like
the Coiii. ttution of the United States'
The benatoi fiom South Caiolina seems tott ink
that this is an infringement of I know not what i
light of a State, and a mcasuie giowing out of
my own peculiar and singular views Does he
mean that a State has a right to make war' Or,
if it should, does he deny ourpower and our duty
to prevent it'
Mr CALHOUN There are two ways of pre-
venting it One is to invite Maine to íetire, the
other is to duve her off, which we might do if she
is to be regarded only as a county But, as Maine
is a State, we have not that right, although we
may apply to her the moial force of this Govern-
ment
Mi WEBSTER A moral force is not polit-
ical power We are clothed with political power,
which it is our duty to exercise on all proper oc-
casions, as well to preserve the peace of the coun-
try as to maintain its rights But I have not said
that Mame was no more than a county All I
said was, that we could have no war by States
any moie than by counties oi by multitudes of
armed peisons, acting without any authority at
all
Mr CAt HOIIV     Ceitamly not
Mi WEBSTER Then it is oui business to
pievent it If there be hostilities not carried on
by the authority of this Government, they are
to be suppressed I did not say that we were to
duve Maine out of the Union, but the leverse
I said that we must pievent wai, unless authoi-
lzed by this Government, by such means as the
case should call foi, when it should happen, and
that if wc cannot prevent such war, then we can-
notexecute the Constitution It is our duty—the
duty of this Governmcn' and of nobody else—
to say when there shall be war, and when there
shall be peace And, m the next place, what I
have objected to in the resolution is the penalty
which is theie hypothetically threatened against
Maine, a threat for which I see no cause and no
reason
Mr CALHOUN I did not suppose that the
question of war or peace was involved in the
words of the resolution, but in the punciple on
which it is based The íesolution is bettei than
the amendment, because it bears more directly on
the point of honor at issue, and on which turns
the difficulty And what I mean to assert is, that
the military occupation by Maine of that territory
is absolutely inconsistent with peace
Mr WILLIAMS Is Maine to withdraw her
force under existing encumstances'
Mr CALHOUN     Certainly not     Maine has
a light to retain her military force while she re
mains under a thieat
Mr WILLIAMS What I wish to say is,
that the military foice of Maine is now under a
thieat, and whenever that threat shall be with-
drawn, Maine can have no inducement to retain
her military force in the terntory, and it was,
theiefoic, that I argued that it was best to leave
Maine, on this point, to her own discretion
Mr CLAY, of Kentucky These resolutions
were not hastily diawn up by the committee, but
after a full examination and consideration of the
subject and I mu&t say that, after all that has
been said, I still adhere to them as they are I
believe that peace depends on our firmness hcie
at Washington, and directed to Maine Gentle-
men have argued as if there was an actual inva-
sion, but if it is so, let them come out boldly and
propose a declaration of war Sir, tnere is no
invasion, at least none such as the Constitution
contemplates in the way of hostility to thib Gov-
ernment When the Constitution speaks of inva
sion, and of the right of a State to call on this
Government for its repulsion, the Constitution
means that an uncontioverted, settled territory is
invaded but is th it now the case ' The Senator
fiom Massachusetts says that this is theacknowl
edged terntoiy of Maine but acknowledged by
whom' It is by one of the pai ties And now let
js suppose that Great Bntain is equally tinam
mous as to hei right to tne terntoiy as we are to
ouis might not ButBin then say that Mime's
eomrinto the Aioostook countiy was an inva
sion^and that it imposed on the Bntish Govern
ment the duty of lepelh ig it' There uetuopai-
ties in this controvcisv and the othei party may
bo under a conviction that the terntoiy i¡> heis,
as cleai as oui oun It it. in dispute, and, till
that is settled, what has taken place cannot be
an invasion which this. Government is bound to
lcpcl
But we are asked, can a State make war  Yea
she can, in 'act, and I wish she may not be at
wai at this moment Can we deny the fact that
ten thousand militia, with arms in their hands,
and sent by Mame upon Fredenckton, would be
war upon New Brunswick' Who can deny it ?
It is not a constitutional, legitimate war, but itis
wai ipso facto, and it is against that that I wish
the Legislature and the country to guaid And
what is the fact' Great Britain has not invaded
this terntoiy, but Maine has invaded it, with all
the circumstance and pomp of war, really for a
civil puipose, but to the British it may have ap-
peared diffeient, and as a nulitaiy occupation
She has gone there with one hundred and fifty
chosen men, undei a shenff, and with a six-
poundei Afterwards, Sir John Harvey warns
them to bieak up and retire, but the Governor of
Mame says " no," and the Legislatuie make a
unanimous call for ten thousand men, who are
now assembling in sight almost of the Butish.
foi ce at the mouth of the Aroostook And do we
now resort to logic, and think it an impossibility
that a State can make war' It is contrary to fact.
And what is presented in the resolutions' The
second declares that, if the British shall, with a
military force, enter the country with a view to its
occupation and exclusive jurisdiction, then we
Will consider it as an invasion But no such en-
try has been made. It has been threatened, but
not made And further, we say, if the British foi-
bear, then Maine also is to forbear, and then we
say, if she will not forbear, (and who will say
that she ought not') Maine may continue her
mihtaiy occupation of the territory. And who
will say that she is not bound to retire' And if
she is bound to do so, are we not manfully to tell
her, not that we will not come to her succor, but
simply foiewarn her that if she refuse to withdraw,
then this Government is not bound by the Con-
stitution to aid and succor hei' And is not this
fan and candid' If gentlemen look at this exas-
perated state of feeling, can they doubt the* dan-
gei of war' And whenever we are in war, I am
the last man to have peace on any other ground
than that of the honor and interest of the coun-
try But it is proposed heie simply to say to
Maine that she ought to prepare to leave it to this
Government to adjust and airange this matter
with a foreign Government, and in her present
infuriated state is it not necessaiy that you should
say to her, If you refuse our counsels, and lush
headlong into war, you must take the conse-
quences, and we aie acquitted of all obligation to
follow you'
Sir, I tiust the amendment will not be adopted,
either to strike out any pai t of this resolution, oi
to insert the clause proposed I saw from the fii st,
that if the Executive and Legislatuie would now
take a bold, manly course, they might avert war
I had great unceitainty in legard to the Executive,
but, as tar as 1 know, he has acted with a sinceie
purposi to preserve the peace ot the country, and
in tins I desire that all may unite
