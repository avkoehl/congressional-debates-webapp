to Illinois for enlistments prior to February 24, 1864. These amount to a total of 1,941, which were distributed by the same rules as were used in the greater distribution preceding. These credits were for one, two, and three years-viz, 761, 9, and 1,171, respectively.

From the 1st of August, 1864, when the system of Circular No. 52 began, to December 31, 1864, credits were distributed for 15,399 men of various classes and terms of service, as shown from time to time in my regular and special reports. Of these, 8,392 were drafted men and substitutes and 7,007 were voluntary enlistments.

Credits since December 31, 1864, to May 31, 1865, have been 27,658, of which 2,053 are for drafted men and substitutes and 25,605 are from voluntary enlistments.

For a tabular statement of the credits of these various periods by districts, see Schedule No. 12, Appendix.

A noticeable fact appears from comparison of the preceding paragraphs. It appears that of the men raised during the last five months of 1864, 54 1/2 per cent. were drafted men or substitutes for drafted or enrolled men, while during the first five months of 1865 the same classes are less than 7 1/12 per cent. of the number raised, though the number of the later period is 80 per cent. larger than that of the former. This great difference arises from the greater popular interest during the latter period, and the organized efforts of counties and towns to fill their quotas by volunteering. Where the civil authorities had not power or inclination to act, citizens" committees in many instances raised money by subscription and paid local bounties. Had the call continued, it would have required but little drafting, which would nowhere have been heavy, to fill the whole quota of the State.

It should be stated also that while I have been limited in the allowance of credits by regulations and laws excluding certain credits until the quotas on the present call should be full, papers have passed through my office showing men enlisted and mustered for whom it is certain no credit had ever given, and other papers bearing names for which it is probable that credit has not been allowed. The number of these I have not recorded, but they are probably some hundreds, which should be added to tule [12], diminishing in equal number the deficit of illinois at the close of the call. A few credits have come in since May 31, up to which date the tabular statements are made.

Balance of quotas and credits.-It would be expected that the difference between the total quotas and total credits, whether the whole State or separate districts be considered, would be the deficit or surplus, as reported in my monthly return of credits for May 31, 1865, but in no instance is this true. Table 13 [Appendix] compares in columns 1 and 2 the final columns of the tables of quotas and of credits, as given in Schedules 11 and 12, and shows in columns 3 and 4 the apparent deficits and surpluses; then gives in columns 5 and 6 the deficits and surpluses of my return of May 31, and in columns 7 and 8 the discrepancies between the apparent and reported deficits and surpluses. There is also added in columns 9 and 10 the total of deficits and surpluses obtained by adding the footings of accounts with sub- districts, without offsetting one against the other, as is done in obtaining the district balances.

When the discrepancy columns are footed and compared, it will be seen that the difference between them is 1,158 surplus, which is exactly the number spoken of in the remarks concerning the table of
