No. 129.

Report of Maj. General John M. Palmer, U. S. Army, commanding Fourteenth Army Corps.
HEADQUARTERS FOURTEENTH ARMY CORPS, DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,Chattanooga, December 11, 1863.

SIR: I have the honor to forward, for the information of the general commanding the department, the reports of Brigadier-General Johnson and Brig. General A. Baird, commanding divisions, of the part borne by their commands during the late operations near Chattanooga, together with the reports of their brigade and regimental commanders respectively.

It will be seen that the report of the operations of each of the divisions is complete of itself, and as their movements were entirely disconnected with each other no attempt has been made to blend them. They are respectfully referred to for all details and particulars.

The pleasing duty devolves upon me, in forwarding these papers, which ends my connection with the army, to express my high satisfaction with the conduct of the officers and men of these divisions. Brigadier-Generals Johnson and Baird were prompt, able, and true. They discharged all their duties like earnest patriots and good soldiers, not were their subordinates less entitled to praise. All the members of my personal staff deserve and have my thanks for their good conduct.

Appended hereto will be found a consolidated statement of trophies and prisoners captured, as well as the casualties of the command.

Respectfully,

J. M. PALMER,

Major-General.

Brig. General WILLIAM D. WHIPPLE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
