HEADQUARTERS FOURTH ARMY CORPS,December 19, 1863

Major General GEORGE H. THOMAS,

Commanding Department of the Cumberland;

GENERAL: I have the honor to call your special attention to the distinguished and meritorious conduct of Brigadier General William B. Hazen in the late operations around Chattanooga. First. The surprise and night assault at Brown's Ferry October 27, 1863, where great gallantry and coolness was displayed, evincing the highest qualities of the soldier and general. Second. The assault and carrying of the strongest points of Orchard Knob on November 23, 1863. Third. The daring and successful charge of the enemy's rifle-pits and batteries on Mission Ridge on November 25, 1863. If any officer has fully and frequently won his promotion by gallant and meritorious conduct, by strict devotion to duty, by the high state of discipline and efficiency in which he keeps his command, that officer is Brigadier-General Hazen; and from a high sense of duty and justice I do most earnestly recommend him for promotion to a major-generalcy of volunteers.

I am, general, very respectfully,

G. GRANGER,

Major-General.
