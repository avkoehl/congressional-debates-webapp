PILOT KNOB, MO., April 24, 1863.

GENERAL: Your dispatch of last night, * directing movement when I found the Iron Mountain road destroyed, &amp;c., was received, bit did not order a movement under present circumstances.

There is no force coming from Black River. The only force there is a few hundred, under Reves, in the vicinity of Patterson, jayhawking and robbing.

At 12.30 Colonel Smart had returned with one battalion to Saint Francis Bridge, leaving one battalion 6 miles beyond. He went within 1 mile of Fredericktown, and reports the enemy broke up their encampment in town, and withdrew 3 miles toward Cape Girardeau, where they halted and formed, but had not encamped. From all the information Colonel Smart can gather, he believes this to be the same force that was at Patterson, and does not exceed, at the utmost, 10,000.

I sent Lieutenant-Colonel Chandler, with two battalions of the Seventh Missouri Volunteer Cavalry, after the party threatening the bridges. He left at 10 this morning, moving via Farmington. Have not yet heard from him.

I telegraphed General Curtis my information from Colonel Smart, and asking if I should attack at Fredericktown to-morrow morning. Can there not be concert with McNeil? See dispatch to General Curtis and direct me. Flag of truce sent to Fredericktown to-day may delay the movement.

WM. VANDEVER,

Brigadier-General.

GENERAL: Just arrived. Marmaduke left yesterday in direction of Cape Girardeau. Camped last night 8 miles east of this. I am after him. Cannot McNeil co-operate? Remain here till morning.

NEAR FREDERICKTOWN, Mo.,

April 25, 1863-11. 20 p. m.

GENERAL; Yours received.+ The party attacked bridges yesterday afternoon, and were repulsed with some loss. They are now trying to effect their retreat, and Chandler and Lisenby ought and I trust will annihilate them. Colonel Clark's regiment is on the bridges, I understand. All pursuing Marmaduke toward Cape Girardeau.
