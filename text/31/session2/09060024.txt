how insignificant this amount is. when compared t
with the amount ot" home products consumed. 1
Upon the basis of«100 per head .the foreign produc-
tion furnishes $6 .V) per lie-id, or, in the aggregate,
sl50.000.000. The residue—or $93 50 ea'-h—
requires annually the sum of about *>2,100,000,000
to be supplied bv our own industry. By reference
to table —, it will be seen that our overage con-
sumption of imports per head for thirty years has
been >."> 94. Anv material excess over that aver-
age, as in the years 1835-*36 and 1839, has been
surely followed by the most disastrous results.
The Imports of the past year have been exceeded
' in amount onlv by the year 1836: and if the offi-
cial figures could be made to represent the true
cost of the imports of the former year, even 1836
would.it is believed, not be an exception. The
imports of the first quarter of the present year
show an increase of more than $18,000,000 over
the corresponding quarter of last year, indicating
an importation for the current year greater by
many millions than the imports of any previous
one. and n consumption per head proportionably
larger, whilst the markets abroad indicate no pros-
pect of an increased demand for our exports.
These exports, as already stated, consist prin-
cipally of articles of necessity, and nearly all of
them "raw materials in their crudest state; and if
we, therefore, wish to occupy the place anions;
commercial nations that our advantages of posi-
tion and our vast resources warrant, we must
greativ increase the amount of those exports. This
can onlv be done by an increase of manufactures.
During the [>a-t year our exports of cotton
have amounted to  $71,984,616
Whil" of domestic cotton manufactures we
liaT: exported only to the extent of  4,733,424
And d-irins the same period the importations
of cotton manufacture* entered for eon-
sumption have amounted at the foreign val-
uation  19,685,936
The exports of cotton from the United States
exceed in importance those of any raw material
exported from any other country, and at the pres-
ent time it is our only export that is essential to
any other nation; but it is believed to be a mis-
taken policy for any nation to send its raw ma-
terials to distant countries, to be manufactured
into fabrics for its own use.
Possessing this most useful staple in abundance
and of the best quality, we ought greatly to in-
crease its manufacture, and secure to ourselves a
portion of the profits which other countries enjoy
therefrom. In order to impress our people with
the value of this production of the United States,
and the means that it affords of extending our in-
ternal and foreign commerce, I subjoin several
tables exhibiting in some degree its importance.
Table No. — shows the value of the exports of
raw cotton and cotton manufactures from t he United
States for the last five years, and the countries to
which ihe same were sent. From which it will
be seen that we exported in

The countries which take the largest quantity
of our raw cotton are Great Britain and France;
and by reference to table No. —, it will be seen
that our exports of cotton and cotton manufactures
. during those years to these countries were as
follow:

Table No. — shows the value of the exports of
cotton manufactures from the United States and
Great Britain in the year 1848, and the countries
to which the same were sent.
From this table it will be seen that the value
cotton manufactures exported from th£k
i nited Htatesdurinjrthat year was * (<5,718.20.5
And that from Great Britain, the value was 1(19.777,008
Which shows how largely Great Britain is de-
pendent upon this manufacture for their oommer- !,
ciid prosperity.

The United States should share m the piofitsof
manufacturing her own great staple; and in pro-
portion as we increase the manufacture of this and
other materials of which we have an abundant
supply shall we be enabled to command the prod- ,
uce. manufactures, and coin of other nations.
Table No. — exhibits the exports of cotlvn from
the United States and Great Britain for five years
from 1844 to 1848, inclusive.
By a reference to this table it will be seen that
the exports of raw cotton to several countries from
Great Britain exceed those from the United States
to the same countries, and that the value of such
exports of American raw cotton from Great Bri- j
tain to the Continent of Europe exceeds the entire
exports of American cotton manufactures to the ]
whole world.
Our entire export of Ijreadstuffs and provisions
to ail parts of the world, during the past year,
will scarcely amount to the value of the cotton
goods imported and the duties thereon.
These tabular statements are intended to show
how important an article in the commerce of the
world is the cotton of the United States, and, if
manufactured by our own citizens, how widely
our commerce might be extended. Instead of an
imputation of nearly twenty millions in value of
' cotton manufactures in a single year, our an-
I" nual exports of those manufactures should be
1 $100,000,000.
The warehouses ofthe United States will be filled
with the products and manufactures of other na-
tions, so long as we are content to export our cotton
and other raw materials in their crude state, and
import the most common articles of clothing.
Our policy should be, by every constitutional
means, to encourage the manufacture of our own
materials, and, so far as their product may be ne-
cessary for other nations, exchange them in their
most valuable form; for under the present system
the gold obtained from our mines will soon be ex-
hausted in paying for excessive importations.
With a profound conviction of their truth, I re-
peat the opinion and words of my predecessor on
tjlis vital subject in his annual communication to
Congress at the last session: " All history shows
that where are the workshops of the world, there
must be the marts of the world, and the heart of
wealth, commerce, and power."
It has been shown by the experience of several
1 years, that the average rate of duties imposed by
I the present revenue laws is about twenty-three
1 per cent, upon the foreign value of our imports,
including free as well as dutiable goods.
During the last fiscal year we imported of for-
eign merchandise, including specie, $178,136,318;
and we exported, of domestic products, foreign
goods, and specie, $151,898,720, leaving a balance
against us of $96,247,598.
A large proportion of this balance has doubtless
been paid by our domestic stocks, which find a
ready sale at this time in European markets.
These last, however, as they only postpone a
present payment in coin, cannot, be expected to
liquidate similar balances for coming years, even
if it were the wish of the Government to create a
large foreign debt of this kind. The impolicy of
such a measure will not be questioned, and it is
doubtless the true interest of the country to avoid it.
In regulating our commerce with foreign nations,
we are therefore compelled to take, as the true
basis of safe importation from all countries, the
amount of our own products, which we may rea-
sonably calculate may find a market abroad.
It is certain that "the increased ability of this
country to consume foreign goods will at this time
safely admit a larger importation than in former
years; vet the experience of the Inst, year has
: shown that our imports have been greatly beyond
our exports, which last must be regarded as the
: true measure of our ability to consume for any
given number of years.
If upon the large importations of the prist, year
|j the increase should continue at the same ratio as :
that ofthe past quarter, which as already stated is
$18,000,000, the aggregate amount for the current
fiscal year ending 30th June, lf>51, will not fall
much short of $*2.i0,000,000. A survey of the
markets of the world, it is believed, furnishes no
reason to expect that our exportations wiil exceed
those ofthe last year, which we ha\e seen were a
fraction h :is than $152,000,000. This would leave,
on the trade of the current fiscal year with foreign
countries, an alarming balance, which could not
fail to be felt in results fatal to all branches of
business at home, and highly injurious to the
revenue of succeeding years.
These considerations, forced by the existing
state of things upon the earnest attention of this
Department, are submitted to the wisdom of Con-
gress, in the belief that they present reasons of
the most imperative character for a modification'
of the present revenue laws. The large prospective
importations should be cheeked by a higher rate
of duties, so as to bring their aggregate amount
within die limit of our capability to pay. If the
exports of the last year define that limit, then our
imports for the ensuing year should not greatly
exceed $152,000,000. It is believed, however, that
we may cab ulate safely upon an export of gold,
for several years to come, rtf at least from ten to
fifteen millions annually, exclusive of what goes
abroad, direct from California, without any detri-
mental effect upon the currency or business of
our people. The supply' of this metal from our
own mines may at present be estimated at
$50,000,000 annually, including that sent directly
from California to other countries; and this sup-
ply, it is believed, will not be likely to diminish
J in amount for the next two or three vears.
I if, then, we can afjord to spare the above amount
of the precious metals in payment of foreign mer-
i chandtse, it may be fairly assumed that our ex-
ports, including all articles, will be equal to about
one hundred and sixty-five millions, supposing
always the trade of the world to remain unaffected
by any disturbing causes. In the opinion of this
i Department, it would be unsafe to assume an
amount of imports as a basis upon which to levy
duties for revenue beyond this latter sum.
If the present rates of duties be applied to that
amount, we should receive from customs, only
$37,950,000, and the amount Of revenue required
for the present and succeeding years would fall
short of the estimates for the current year, by a
fraction over seven millions.
It cannot be doubted that a rate of duty higher
on many articles than that paid by the present
law might be established without affecting inju-
riously the revenue. The extraordinary in flux of
foreign merchandise for the last year and the first
1 quarter of the present one must be regarded as
conclusive proof that an increase of duties, so as
to advance the amount of revenue seven millions
on the same amount of imports, is entirely practi-
cable.
That such increase will be found necessary to
the demands of the Treasury, is believed to be
beyond doubt, unless Congress shall discontinue
many of the objects of expenditure which origin-
ated in our recent territorial acquisitions, and
this, in the opinion of the Department, would be
equally impolitic and unjust.
From the foregoing considerations, the Depart-
ment would submit the following modifications of
our present revenue laws:
I. A change in the present ad valorem system,
which should impose specific duties upon all arti-
cles to which such duties may be safely applied,
with home valuations upon all such as are neces-
sarily subject to {id valorem rates.
II. If the principle of specific duties shall not be
adopted, that the home valuation, instead of the
foreign, should then be applied to all imports sub-
ject to ad valorem duties.
III. If neither of the foregoing changes shall be
thought proper, then it is deemed highly neces-
sary that the present rates of duties should be in-
creased on a great variety of articles which it will
be found could bear such increase with the most
salutary effects upon both trade and re\ enue.
Either of the two first modulations suggested
above would undoubtedly correct many of the
inequalities of the present system, place all im-
porters, whether purchasers or manufacturers, on
equal grounds in respect to valuations for duty,
