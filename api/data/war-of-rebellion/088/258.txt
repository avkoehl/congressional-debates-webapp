HEADQUARTERS SECOND CORPS,August 17, 1864.

Major-General BIRNEY,

Commanding Tenth Corps:

GENERAL: The major-general commanding regrets to say that not a single wounded man was found between the lines to-day. The flag of truce was consented to by him reluctantly, and only on General Birney's assurance that the facts were that our own and the enemy's wounded were between the lines, exposed to the fire of both parties, and could be removed by neither.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

F. A. WALKER,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS TENTH ARMY CORPS,August 17, 1864-10.30 p. m.

Lieutenant-Colonel WALKER,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

In answer to your dispatch concerning the flag of truce sent out to-day, I would respectfully state that I am not aware of having given any assurances in respect to the wounded beyond what is contained in my note of this morning viz, that they were under the enemy's

fire and ours. This information was given by the corps officer of the day. The party bearing the flag was not suffered to advance beyond our picket line.

Respectfully,

D. B. BIRNEY,

Major-General.

Respectfully,

D. B. BIRNEY,
