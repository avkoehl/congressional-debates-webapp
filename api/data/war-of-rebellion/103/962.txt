Adjutant and Inspector General, Richmond, Va.:

GENERAL: I inclose you copy of a report made to me by Brigadier General A. W. Reynolds of an inspection tour which I directed him some time since to make in Northern Georgia. The recent appointment of General Wofford to take charge of the matters referred to in this communication renders it unnecessary for me to make any suggestions on the subject, still I forward the report for your information.

I am, general, very respectfully, yours, &amp;c.,

HOWELL COBB,

Major-General, &c.
