I have information that on the 27th the enemy received re-enforcements of one division, perhaps two-Bushrod Johnson's and Cheatham's. Some of Buckner's troops are certainly here, as some of our officers saw the rebel General Gracie during the flag yesterday. Let us hear from you soon.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.

Major-General GRANT.

KNOXVILLE, December 6, 1863-8 a.m.

General Wilson has arrived here, and has informed you in detail by telegraph of our present position. The siege was raised yesterday morning, and our cavalry is pursuing the enemy as rapidly as possible under the circumstances.

The horses are in bad condition and the men very much fagged by constant work in the trenches.

The infantry are not in a good condition for pursuit for the same reason, and the artillery can scarcely be moved for want of animals. The advance of Sherman's column is near and he will be here in person in a few hours, when we will try and organize a pursuing force large enough to either overtake the enemy and beat him or to drive him out of the State. The main body of his force is moving toward Morristown, and the indications are that he will try to reach the terminus of their railroad line at Bristol. We have saved all our rolling stock on the railroad, but will not be able to use it farther up than Strawberry Plains, as the bridge at that place has been destroyed. We have heard nothing from Foster or Elliott, but hope to this morning. Will telegraph you more fully after seeing Sherman. We thank you for the prompt aid rendered us. But for the approach of Sherman the siege would not have been raised.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.

Major-General GRANT.

KNOXVILLE, December 7, 1863.

I have just written the following letter to General Sherman,* who at daylight this morning reversed all his troops with the exception of Granger, and started them back to you. Elliott has not yet reported; when he does I shall put him upon the right flank of the enemy. Our troops are in motion in pursuit of Longstreet, and I shall join them to-day unless Foster arrives. He was at Tazewell last night. I have been able to organize a column of pursuit of about 8,000 men. Granger is crossing Little River now, and will probably be here to-night. The rear guard of the enemy is at Blain's Cross-Roads. I can scarcely express to you my obligations for the prompt assistance rendered by you to my command.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General, Commanding.

Major-General GRANT.
