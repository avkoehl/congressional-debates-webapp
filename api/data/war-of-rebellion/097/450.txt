Colonel T. S. BOWERS:

If the President will come on the 9 a.m. train to Patrick's Station I will send a horse and an escort to meet him. It would afford me much pleasure to meet the President in person at the station, but I know he will excuse me for not doing so when my services are so liable to be needed at any moment. If 9 is an inconvenient hour telegraph me the hour when the President will start and he will find his escort awaiting him when he arrives.

Lieutenant-General.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

As there are not over 100 men at City Point, and they are on duty, I applied to Admiral Porter for marines. He kindly furnished 500, which I sent to the front. They have returned with over 3,000 prisoners, whom they are now guarding. If Collis' brigade is not to return I will have to call on the admiral for all guards for prisoners.

The enemy took the route north toward the Appomattox. As Sheridan was in above them I am in hopes but few of them I am in hopes but few of them will escape. General Miles also captured two field pieces in this attack.

Colonel T. S. BOWERS,

City Point:

Send all my dispatches that have gone concerning operations to Sherman. What you receive hereafter send to Fort Monroe by telegraph to be forwarded by first steamer to Morehead City. Have you stopped Mulford from delivering prisoners? If he has any on hand for delivery tell him to hold on to them.
