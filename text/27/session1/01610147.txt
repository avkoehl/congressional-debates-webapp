m ulation of a considerable surplus, after the  payment of the
national debt
*lIn view of the dangers of sucha surplus, and in preference
to its application to internal improvements, m derogation of the
rights aid powers of the States, the suggestion of an amendment
to the Constitution, to authorize its distribution, was made It
was an alternative of what were deemed greater evils—a tem-
poral y resoiuo relieve an overburdened Treasury until the Go
vernmen* could without a sudden and destiuctive revulsion in
the business of the cou ury, gratually return to the just punci
plo o! raising no more revenue from the people, 10 taxes, than
is necessary for its economical suppoit Even that alternative
wa^not spoicen of but m connection with an amendment of
the Constitution Nntempoiary inconvenience can justify the
exercise of prohibited power ora power not gtanted by that m
strument and it was from a conviction that the power todistn
bute even a tempotary surplus of revenue is of that character,
and it was suggested only in connection with an appeal to the
souiceofail kgal povveis m the General Government—the
States whuh have established it
"No such appeal has been taken and, in my opinion adis
tribution of the surplus íevenue by Congress, ei hei to the
States or the people, is to bf considered as among the prohibí
turn of tl e Cons i utioi As aheady mtiraattd my views

its I tgi^iature with great respect, both on account oí then high

are thcie consideted
Tit tub-t of these resolver s°ts forth that the public lands,

in favor of liberal provi^ ns to the new States, but is opposed to
ceding the public lands to theStites in which they he as unjust,
and contrarv to th*1 s i| 11 ation^and condmons of the dteds of

any thing advanced in these three resolves, but to the lourth I

Mr Chairman, there is great force m the soitgestion of the
gentleman from South Carolina, tnat it would be best at any
rate to defer the further consideration of the bill until the win
ter's session befoie it is finally acted on It is, in fact, an as
sumption of State debts as faiasitgoes, forthe payment ofthe
interest of the debt of a State or nation from a pledged fund is
assuming the debt in fact, although perhaps not 111 foi m It aj -
pears to me we are not prepared to vote for U from the North
because it will rave a bearing on the tariff question, which is
to be discussed at an eaily period If our bretnren ofthe ¡south
feel that you unwarrantably diaw mon^y fiom the Tieasury,
there will be a strong feeling when you ask to have it replaced
bv import duties You may not have opposition to the
extent that01 ce existed, but the moral sentiment will be against
you Will the membprs ofthe South vo'e for it until they aie
more fully satisfied thaf their constituents view the pi'c.eeds of
thepubhc lands as difteientm their nature from othei revenue?
There is nothing to be lost to the West by delay Although I
shou'd, for one oppose the lull upon eveiy rrmciple yetnap
peai^to me that even with those who look upon it favorably,
it is too impoiiantin its consequences to be too hastily pressed
by its friends The precedent will be a bad one It wt'l be
the first scheme of regular d "tribution The deposite with the
States has not the sanction of law foi it aHhougn the money
wi 1 «ever he returned to the national Treis a v
Mr KEiNiNFDY, ofMarvland tot 111 «nip, ort of the bill
lie commented by observing that if he be leved the biM be
forethe cornmtteto contain within it ^ny 111 iupl< which,
m actuil opeiationof the bill o*- in the mtennonol tho e «In
framed it w >uld interfere with the existing, land f-ystem, he
should be opposed to its pa ase, because he believed our
) in 1 system as now established to be a wist,, efficient, and use
ful "vstern
If he beVvedthe bill was calculated to give leahty to that
p 1 tnrom (Hip Opposi ion  tbe assumption V State debts by
theGeieral Government   he sh >uid be agitnst the  bill    b"
cause he ccnsideied such a mearme as eminently  unwise, he
would not <*av unconstitutional   because, in the mteipre'ation
of the Constitution, he wa« not as strait laced as tome gentle
men     If he tl ought the bill intended to opeiate, or could be
lieve that it would opeiate   to the disparagement of the gitat
West  he  «voull oppose u  because he held that the inteiestsof
the West should   be a mo«t cherished object of legislation  fr
the interests of the West was none other than the interest of
settlement and of civilization, and was calculated to confer the
mo*t valuable benefits not meiely on our own country, butupon
mankind
If the, bill proro^ed to deprive the General Government of
the income from the public lands in time of war hewouldvote
against if because he was no friend to abstracting any impoi
tant source of accruing me w& in moments of public pressure
and emergency If this were a bill to favor stoekgamblers and
speculator, ot the interest of broken corpoiation^, brokers,
and money dealers he should give it his decided opposition
foi that entire class were far fiom bemg favorites with
him
But the bill did none of these thing* It proposed simply to dis
tribute the proceeds of the land system with the system it«e f
it had nothing to do And yet, though the bill had no propi 1 or
legitimate connection with any one of the^e obj ct5', yet each
and every of therr had been employed by the Opp(«monao
points of a t->ck from which to carry on then assaulis upon t
while some of those gen lemen, de^( urine of the effect oí anv
argument di íwn from the=e toj ic« had affected t npprehend
that something \ery m)<=tenous lay concealed b  hind this
measure, something which they feared, but did under
stand
Thi  seciet of their opposition said Mr K is to be found m
neither of the«e considerations I do not mean anv thing offen
s ve when I say that the bill is attacked on the mere principle
of pt iitical tactic because the bill is ours, not theirs The
measure is assaulted because it is the measure of 0 ma onty
and a majontv so large ts to covei a veiy large portion ol the

somethwg said about the ado^tiOR of the Constitution Itself
overriding all previous terms and conditions of the cession*
I  really do not know how to understand gentlemen, or What H
is they refer to but this I know, that if the adoption of the
Constitution organically disabled tbia General Government to
accept «uch a trust on the terms proposed, tliérí the grant must
of nece'isity re\ ert to the grantors But if thtíre, after all, ahy
solidity in this objection? I am not going, Uttm time, to aife
constitutional points to do so after the ab!efefear, convincing
and beautiful argument of the gentleman from Massachusetts,
[Mr Winth'íopI last evening, would in me be presumptuous,
and in regard to this committee not less superfluous But, pa
the point of power, the question is, has not this Government
actually received the trust? andif it has, what is there topre
vent its compliance with theLerms on which they received itl
Has not this Government received the temithsoman bequesf,
and also certain Pacts of Indian lands under a qualified tenure,
so limited by condmons as to render each or them a peculiar
fund"* Clearly it has and havmg so accepted them, it is ao
lemnly bound to execute the trust according to the terms of the
deed under which the property is holden If this tfocmne be
true, and if a claim to (he public hands is now asserted by the
Stales what light has this Government to set up its own neces-
sities as a plea for non compliance with the conditions express-
ly laid down in the deeds of cession under which it obtained the
land? And when we, m the name of those Sfateig, solemnly
present their dtniand aie we to be taunted with acting the part
of beggar* of suppliants coming here and humbly craving alma
from this Govemir-enf Is a man a beggar whocorrtestoan-
o b«r man holding h(spiopeit> and demands that pioperty on a
cleai qnestun ofHw? The gentleman who last addressed the
committee «aid that the lands had gone into revenue, and it
wis now to be considered as an established principle that they
constituted a part of the íevenue ofthe Go\ernrrent But the
fact is not so It 1* now only four 01 five years since the war
debt has been pud and long before that, iht 'principle of a; trust
was explicitly acknowledged That doctrme has had the con
currence of almost eveiy enlightened statesman in the country.
It is asound principle and now is the time in which it ought
to be cained outmto its practical results
Some of the States are in circumstances, now, to need the aid
to hedeiivedfrom a distribution, they come and claim their
right, though it may have lam long dormant Andaré they to
ho taunted as menials and mendicants? I epum the charce.
The States stand before this Congress m no such character.
They come and claim what is of right then own, hot oí! á theory
of to day—a plea invented and gotten up for the occasion—but
on giou ids cfjlemniy recognised more than ten years ¿go, when
all the States were in their palmiest condition, and when trjfere
could be no inducmer t but the mere abstract justice of ihe
case to ask a bettlement It was known that the lands in ques-
tion were rapidly settling that the question was becoming
moie and more embarrassing every year, and that sound policy
dictated that a settlement of it should be made while us ¿ettle*
ment was compnattvely easy We are now, happily, arrhrfed
at an er t ch in the history of the Government which renders it
pecuhaily timely aniíappiopiiate thatthe rights ofthe §>fat&i
shouilbeacknowletged and then properly restored to- tftejr
own hand? Those who re«ia ed <md refused their clahyjSj and
applied the proceedsof their property toa profuse and Wasfe-
fui adm initiation or the Government, are now dnvenfrom tho
seats of power The people have risen 111 the majesty of their
sttensth to vindicate their right* and this is one of them
Put iheic aie high considerations of public policy which far
ovei^hadow m lmpouance e\en the inherent justice of the
claim
If there is any principle peculiarly unfoi túnate m its opera-
tion upon a Government like ours, and which inflicts a direct
injury upon ihe harmony and steadiness of its aciion, it 13 thia
disturbing element, the pioceeds of the public domain, thfrown
from year to year into the provisions for the public expendí
ture No element in the calculations of a statesman can be
more uncpitatn or less dependable Lookfiom 1819 uptothe
present time, compare tne income of one year, from this
-ource with that of anothei, can any thing be more fluctuat-
ing'1 Can any fund more completely defy every thing" like/

was between thieeandfoui million'', ?n l&¡2¿, it fell down to
II  s tb in one million in '830, we find it two millions, in 1834,
