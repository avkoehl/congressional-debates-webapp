He adverted to the expenditures of the judicial department,
&ud asked eoutd any one suppose that the. lacrease to four
hundred and odd thousand dullard, had grown up without
great abuses; and he ieared instances were not wanting m which
a collusion between theclerkaand district judges had counte-
nanced these abuses He could name one district court in
Which the expenditures were four times greater than any other
of corresponding d u ties
He nextalluded to the diplomatic corps Our foreign minis
tere, he insisted, were m many instances useless It was well
known ministers to foieign countries were appointed for por-
tions of the earth which the officers themselves were puzzled to
find out.
The nexf resolution was, as to the abuses of the franking pri-
vilege litis he consider d a great abuse lie had heaid that
id the first fifty years of this Government, a system of abuse
had grown up, gte^ter than had grown up in the course of cen
tunes in England He enumerated many He understood that
95 per cent  of the mail depatches went iree, and the othei 5
Ííercent had to btav alt the charges Heal&o understood the

The next íesolu ion wa^ that calling for retrenchments m the
Departments He took it for granted that eveiy one would
concur that it would be impossible fui Cmgi ess to accomplish
refoim if the heads of Departments d,d not co opeiatein the
good work But i e was boi ry to say that two oí the Depart

greatly enl iged estimates JXe minted, howevei if the^e ie¡ u

The next was retrenchment and leforra—and was it not due
to a bleeding country to fix expendituies at the low est pos a

could not,m laving duty foi revenue, afluid incidental protec

He had no* gone into minute detail he had embodied great

would offer a few amendments, winch he requested might be

Mr Wright submitted the following amendments to the re
solutions
