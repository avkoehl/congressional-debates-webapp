organization that I telegraphed about yesterday should be ready by 1st June. I leave for the East to-morrow unless otherwise ordered. Weather clear and warm.

THOMAS A. SCOTT,

Assistant Secretary of War.

BUELL'S HEADQUARTERS, May 22, 1862.

Major-General HALLECK:

Besides the concurrent reports of several deserters to-day, that the enemy design to attack, the movements in my front may indicate the same thing. The force in front has been considerably increased, and this evening the enemy appeared on my left, flanking in an important outpost which I have on the Farmington and Corinth road in front of Crittenden. Some 6 or 7 men were wounded by their artillery at that point. Their position is in front of Pope's right.

D. C. BUELL,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS, Farmington, May 22, 1862.

Major-General BUELL:

I send a division from my right this morning to make reconnaissance beyond first creek. Please notify Nelson and Wood, that they may look out for the right of this division, which will rest on the first road to Corinth. Brigadier-General Crittenden is also notified of the reconnaissance.

JNumbers POPE,Major-General, Commanding.

FARMINGTON, May 22, 1862.

Major-General HALLECK:

The enemy advanced in some force on my left this morning. They drove in the cavalry vedettes, but did not advance upon the infantry pickets. I sent out a force to meet them, but they retired. I have sent a regiment and a half of cavalry to Yellow Creek this morning to look after the cavalry reported to be in that vicinity. I gave them orders to return by way of Hamburg and to destroy the bridge over Chambers Creek, on the Sulphur Spring road.
