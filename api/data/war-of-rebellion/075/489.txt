HEADQUARTERS LEFT WING, SIXTEENTH ARMY CORPS,Big Shanty, June 15, 1864 - 10.30 p. m.

Major General J. B. McPHERSON, Commanding Army of the Tennessee;

After a survey of the ground, I have concluded to put in the work on edge of timber in front of orchard, refusing well my right and left. If General Osterhaus advance on line with work he took to-day, we will cover with a strong force the ground between us.

General Davis has not advanced his main line, but his skirmishers connect with mine, and are well supported, and my rear line with his front line will cover pretty well my right; the position is the only tenable one to my front, and is certainly a good one. We are very close on a pretty strong force of the enemy, but some distance yet, I think, from their main work. We took one pretty strong work to-day and can make use of it. I will have to stretch my line some, and have ordered two regiments from General Sweeny to fill the second line vacated by General Veatch. The firing to-night is caused by rebels trying to stop our working parties. I have given strict instructions about firing, and it comes mostly from them.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. M. DODGE,

Brigadier-General.

BIG SHANTY, GA., June 15, 1864 - 11.30 a. m.

Brigadier General G. M. DODGE,

Commanding Left Wing, Sixteenth Army Corps:

Your note received. You will advance your right, and keep on a line with the Army of the Cumberland. If you can get the orchard without risking too much it will be all right. Your right will keep the line of the railroad as you advance. In consequence of the defeat of Strugis by Forrest at Guntown, Colonel Howe will remain at Decatur with his brigade until further orders even though Major-General Thomas sends troops there.

Yours, truly,

JAS. B. McPHERSON,

Major-General, Commanding.

BIG SHANTY, GA., June 15, 1864 - 7 a. m.

Brigadier General G. M. DODGE,

Commanding Left Wing, Sixteenth Army Corps:

Brigadier-General Harrow's division will move out on a reconnaissance and for the purpose of making a demonstration on the enemy's right flank at 11 a. m. to-day. You will move General Sweeny's division forward to occupy temporarily the position at present occupied by Brigadier-General Harrow's, or as soon as he leaves.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JAS. B. McPHERSON,

Major-General, Commanding.
