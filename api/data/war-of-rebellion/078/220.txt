Brigadier General J. AMMEN,

Commanding Fourth DIVISION, Twenty-THIRD Army Corps:

GENERAL: I am directed by the provost-marshal-general of East Tennessee to tell you that information has been received at this office that two companies of rebel soldiers, well mounted and known as Osborne's and Henry's companies, are in Sevier County, Tenn., and were last night within two miles and a half of Sevierville, Tenn. There are apprehensions that these men will do a great deal of damage to the growing crops and other property, unless driven out or otherwise stopped. Would it not be well to send a small force, say forty cavalry, to Sevier County, who, combined with our troops already there, may be able to capture or destroy the whole crowd?

I am, sir, with great respect, &amp;c.
