25th CoNG....lst Sess.                                   Postponement of fourth msJalment—Mr. Bell.                                                 H. of Reps.
cretary of the Treasurj, en the 1st of May last,
and a similar amount is admitted to have been in
their hands  on the 11th of this month. In truth,
sir, this ha.i now, in practice, become a standing
dead fund, so far as the public use of it is con-
cerned Instead of lying in fie hands of disbursing
agents, or being deposited- to their credit in the
banks from month to month andfrom } eai to year,
I wish it brought forth, and acluaUy expended du-
ring the present embarrassed con htion of the Trea-
suiy and the country. It is now contemplated
that this amount, or an average amount, will be
in the hands of disbursing agents at all times, and
it is upon this calculation that it is contended that
this fund will add nothing to the means stated to
be in the Treasury I affirm, that if jou will re-
quire these five millions to be actually expended,
to ti e dregs, during the remaining quartir of the
present year, it will diminish the estimated de-
mands upon the Treasury during that period by
that amount. I insist, too, that this is the proper
time to cure this evil It lias already been shown,
that if this amount can be applied to the public ser-
vice during the year, besides what is not yet drawn
liom the Treasury, the fourth instalment can be
safely paid to the States, w ithout leaving any ma-
terial deficit in the Treasury, even admitting the
leceipts tor the two last quarters of the year to be
no more than they are estimated by (he Secretaiy
himself
But it is contended by the chairman of the Com-
mittee of "Ways and Means, (Mr Camb eleng)that
at least one million of the moneys in the Treasury
should be reserved foi the purposes of the Mint I
saj, sit, tint at such a crisis mom fisaal affaus, it
ts idle longer to be deluded b; the expectation that
the country or its currency is to be rehe\ ed bj the
operations of the Mu.t1 We have had quite enough
oí ^uch experiments already It ¡s said, howcvei,
by the gentleman, that five hundred thousand dol-
lars are already in the Mint In reply, I say let
us un-nuni it, then, if I may com a word, and I am
sure my com is m quite as good taste as the new
gold and siher coins which have issued lately fiom
the Mint I sav, can we not reach this fund by
law, if necessary* Let us reduce the ariount em-
ployed in the Mint for the present, and until we
shall have the means of carrying out the pohc} of
recommg all the gold in this eountiy, or that can
be got from other countries
[Mi Mercfr informed Mi Bi u that the
amount formeily íequired for the use of the Mint
was only 200,000 dollars ]
We have only, then, (continued Mr Bell,) to
bring back the operations of the Mint to the stand-
ard which answered «o well until the recent experi-
ment commenced upon the currency
The gentleman from New York [Mr Cambre-
ieng] also contend  that we must provide the means
of keeping a contingent fund of four 01 five mil-
lions always in the Treasury, and he reminds us
that that amount was required to be reserved in
the Treasury by the deposite act of 1836 Does
the gentleman mean to say that this fund must
always be in the Treasury? Does he regard it in
the light of a fixtwe, which, for the honor and
safety of the Tieasury, is never to be removed or
disturbed1 Sir, for what purpose is a contingent
fund desirable or useful, but to meet just such a
crisis—just such an emergency, as the piesent1 It
istheverv. purpose of its cieation to meet unex-
pected calls upon the Tieasury—to supply unex-
pected deficiencies at periods like the present. No
such absurd idea as that which seems to have
weight with the gentleman from New York, ever
entered the heads of those who recommended the
policy of alwajs keeping a contingent fund of any
amount in the Treasuiy
[Mr Mercer here mfoimed Mr. B that the
amount formerly regarded as a sufficient contingent
fund was only two millions ]
And even that amount, said Mr B was designed
to answer demands upon the Treasury, when there
should happen to be no other funds on hand
It has been argued that in any form in which
the means of the Government can be presented,
there will be a deficit, or an excess of the amount
chargeable by law upon the Treasury during the
yeai over the moneys at the disposal of the Govern-
ment This is true if we include the fifteen mil-
lions chargeable upon the Treasuiy, which the Se-
cretary himself admits may be postponed until the
next veai, (1838,) but, sir, we are called here to
provide the necessary means to carry on the Go-
vernment and to pay all demands upon its Treasu-
ry during the present 3 ear It is not our business
to anticipate the future demands upon the Treasu-
ry, and to provide for them, though we are pro-
viding an ample fund for that puipose, if we post-
pone the collection of all the outstanding duty
bonds until the next year It will be the propel
business of the next session of Congress to pio-
vide for the expenditures of the year 1838, and we
shall then do it, after having the benefit of another
report from the Secietarj of the Treasurj, in which
it will be his duty to point out the ways and means
of meeting the expendamos of the next year We
have enough to do now, to provide the means ne-
cessary to meet the expenditmes for the remainder
of the present year
It is true, Mi Chairman, that we have now an
estimate before us for an <>dditional expendituiefor
the support of the war against the Indians 111
Flonda of 4,1,600 000 It this was not anticipated
and included in the estimates of the expéndame
foi the remaindei of the present year, submitted by
the Secretary of the Treasuiy m his report to the
House, it will inciense the deficit or balance of
charges upon the Tieasun during the yeai, 01 er
the means at the disposal of the Government, by
that amount But, sir, e\ en with that addition, the
deficit will not be senous, and will constitute uo
substantia1 cbstmction to the pavment ol ?ll d -
mands ui on it A small amount ot leceipts nto
the Treasurj during the two last q'^rtris of the
veai, 01 if hit the amount ot he Treasury pro-
!< ^t(d di.if 1' 1 *tcd 111 ti e lrpoit of the Seert<ar\
(4,000,000) ¡0 hi .10« 111 circulation should ei 1-
tinue, which will no doubt be the case, there will
still be no actual want of means in the Treasuiy
during the year.
In the statement I have made of the condition of
the Treasury, it must be remembered, I nave taken
the statements and calculations of the Secietary of
the Treasurj as the basis
But let us see what sort of a upon umn the
financial condition of the country we mignt haie
expected, and would piobably have received from
ar pdmimstiation which vías not hostile to the po-
licy if the act of June, 1836 and which had no
m'erpst m embairassmg the States, and in milting
the distribution act unpopular, or, if such an inte-
rest was felt, was too magnanimous and patriotic
to he actuated by such motives
A truly republican and patriotic Executive, I
can readily suppose, would have made so've such
statement as the follov mg
Whole amount chargeablebj law upon
the Tieasury  during the vear 1837,
inclusive   of  the  amount due   the
States under the act of June 1836—
viz balance ot appropriations of for-
mer years remain g unexpended on
the 1st ofJanuaiy, 1837, ¿.16,752,283
Appropriations for the year
1837,   exclusive   of the
Post Offiee Department - 31,400,087
---------------$48,152,370
From this amount, however,  may be
deducted  the following  sums,   viz
amount   of  appiopriations   for the
year 1836, and   the   present yeai,
which will probably not be requued
during the present year, $16,500,000
The amount of appropria-
tions foi the years 1836
and 1837, which may be
withheld   from the   ob-
jects to w Inch tb"y were
appropnated if Congress
shall   consent,    without
any material injury to the
public sei vice   -           -   5,500,000
Making an aggregate of---------------$22,000,000
Which being deducted from the sum
slated as the whole amount chargea-
ble upon the Tieasuiy during the
present yeai, will leave a balance of
existing appidpnations   which will
probably be required to be expended
for the ordinary service of the jear
(1837) amounting to      §26,152,370
Add the amount of the 4th
instalment due the Stat«s
under act of 23d June,
1836, which is  jet un-
paid      -           -           -   9,367,314
And the whole amount of the actual
demands upon the Tieasury durn g
the cunent jear will be       -          -35,51^,584
To supnly this necessaiy demand upon
the Treasuiy, the following means
may be s'ated as at the disposal of
the Government duung the current
year—viz balance in the Treasury
on the 1st January, 1837, after set-
ting apart the amount due the Slates
accoidmg to the act of 23d June,
1836     -           -           - $6,690,137
Receipts into the Treasury
during the two first quar-
ters of the current year - 10,700,415
Estimated receipts during
the two last quarters ot
the current year            - 10,000,000
The amount of the 4th in-
stalment dup the States
under the act of 23d June,
1836, which wa«set apait
on the 1st Janudiy, 1837,
and which ha not vet
been duvn from the
Tieasuij           -                9,367,21'

drawn from the Treasu-
iy, js unexpended, and
may fatrlv and pei fectly

posal Ol the Government,
and applieab'e to the ser-
vice of the current jeai,    5,000,000
Aggregate of nvans,          —-----------^44,737,406
By this statement, it appear that there w ill be a
surplus m the Tieasury amounting *o §9,218 822.
The only explanations which this statement may
seem louquire relate to he estimate ot receipts
for the two last quartets ot the >ear, and the pio-
proposed reduction of the expenditures
I have estimated the receipts into the Treasuiy
from all sources duung the two last quaiters of the
present year at #10,000,000, or at the ra e of $20,-
000,000 for the whole yeai I observe that the
chairman of the Committee of Waj s and Means
estimates the receipts foi the last quarter of the yeai
at £4,000,000, which is oil) one million le<-s for the
quaiter than the estimate I have stated He gives
us no estímale of the receq ts for the third 11 cur-
rent quarter of the year, nor does the Secretar; of
the Tieasurj favor us wi'h his es imate for the
th rd quarter He contents himself by stating the.
probable receipt in one contingcnov at <£<) Ü '0,000,
in one other contingcncv, at £,7,000,000, pnd in
still another, at §4,500,000 The amount is un-
doubtedly cont ngent, but I think the estimate of
the Secretary is too low, in any event affecting the
revenue that is at all probable But, suppose, sir,
that I have overrated the rece pts for the two last
quar ers of the year bj $3 000,000, and that the
expenditures hav e been estimated too low bj an
equal amount, there w ill still be an excess m the
Treasury of «,3,218,822
But the reduction I hav e proposed in the expen-
ditures of the vear demands a fuller explanaron
It will be seen that I have stated the unexpended
bilances at the end of the present year at sivteen
millions and a half This is le s than tin c uounl
remaimnmc unexpended at the close oí ' e vear
1836, and it ought to be uoine in mind t at most
of the items ot appropriation which remai ed un-
expended at the close of last j ear aie sti'l out-
standing, and must of necessity; compose the prin-
c pal of the fifteen millions which the Secretaiy ad-
mits will not be called for duung the present j ear
The appropriations fot the present year, applicable
