Now, sir, the Committee on Appropriations
examined this matter. They found test
year the sum of $65,000 was appropriated or
this item, which includes the secret-service
fund; and the estimates proposed the same
appropriation for the next fiscal year, in
committee thought that $30,000 would be
abundantly sufficient for all the contingent
expenses embraced in this item. We trust
that the Committee of the Whole and the
House will sustain our action.
Mr. BANKS. I move to amend the amend-
ment by striking out "sixty-five" and inserting
"fifty, so as to make the amount$50,000. I
desire to ask the gentleman from Illinois, [Mr.
Washbbrne,] who has the management of this
bill, whether the reduction proposed by the com-
mittee has been agreed upon after conference
with the State Department or with the knowl-
edge that the sum proposed to be appropriated
will be sufficient for the coming year?
Mr. "WASHBURNE, of Illinois. I will state
thatthe committee acted upon their own inform-
ation. They do not intend to permit the De-
partments to legislate for the committee or the
House. We examined the whole subject. We
know what appropriations have been made
heretofore; we have seen how those appropri-
ations have been expended; and we'believed
that $30,000 would be entirely sufficient for
this purpose.
Mr. SI2ALDING. On the contrary, I have
information that the whole sum proposed in
my amendment is needed.
Mr. BANKS. Mr. Chairman, while I would
not, of course, advise or consent that any De-
partment should be permitted to legislate here,
it appears to me it is always well, in making our
appropriations, to ascertain what are the neces-
sities of the Departments. In years past there
has been ail appropriation for this service of
sixty-five or seventy thousand dollars. Now
tlie Committee on Appropriations propose to
cut down the amount suddenly without, as the
gentleman from lllinoisgivesus to understand,
any knowledge whether or not the sum pro-
posed in the estimates will probably be neces-
sary. It is certain that dui'ing (he next fiscal
year the State Department will be called upon
in its intercourse with other Governments, in
looking after the protection of American citi-
zens  
Mr. WASIIBURNE, of Illinois. I will state
to the gentleman that that is provided for in
the preceding paragraph, "for contingent ex-
penses of all the missions abroad, $50,000."
Mr. ROBINSON. That is forthe contingent
expenses.
Mr. BANKS. They are for contingent ex-
penses regularly established, but this is for
extraordinary expenses incurred in the manner
I have indicated. They must necessarily be
added to those contingent expenses heretofore
provided by the Government. I am sure, sir,
during the present year there will be an urgent
demand made by our citizens abroad, whose
claim s are sustained by a large nu mber of people
in this country, and they cannot be met unless
we make an appropriation of a more liberal
chftriictGr
Mr. BLAINE. If anything of that kind be
provided let it be put in for that specified pur-
pose, and not put in as a secret-service fund.
If money be needed for Americans wlio get
into trouble abroad let the appropriation be so
limited.
Mr. BANKS. I have a communication from
the State Department giving the estimates of
appropriations needed for the protection and
defense of American citizens abroad. It is
there estimated that §40,000 will be needed.
Mr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois. Let the
gentleman bring in a bill for that purpose, and
I have no doubt the House will pass it.
Mr. ROBINSON. I hope the amount of
appropriation will be made 8100,000 for the
i purpose of paying these necessary expenses.
Mr. BANKS, I think the sum of $20,000
is too low, and I therefore move to make it
$50,000.
Mr. LOGAN. Has the Committee on Ap-
propriations any information as to the amount
of secret-service fund that the Secretary of
State has now on hand ?
Mr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois. That is a
matterwhieh is notcommunicatedtothe House
or the committee.
Mr. LOGAN. I understand he has a large
amount now on hand. I do not know any-
thing about it myself, but I have reason to
believe, as I think others have, that he has a
large amount of secret-service money now on
hand. This $30,000 is intended for the same
purpose—for the purpose of paying spies. - I
am willing that the Secretary of State shall
have a proper amount for a secret-service fund
needed in intercourse with foreign nations, but
I am opposed to any extravagant sum being
allowed to remain in his hands, to be expended
we know not how, and of the expenditure of
which we are to have no information. I am
opposed in principle to the employment of spies
by the Government except in time of war. I
am opposed to the keeping of secret agents at.
every court of Europe for the purpose of pur-
chasing worthless property at enormous prices.
I am opposed to giving any Department of
this Government a large secret-service fund
to be disbursed as it may think proper, without
the least check upon it. That is the way in
which the country is robbed of its money. In
each Department is a sort of seeret-serviqe
fund for the pay of spies and informers. We
appropriated the other day $100,000—to pay
for what? Why, sir, for secret agents of the
Treasury Department. The head of that De-
partment sends these agents all over the coun-
try. I know one of them in New York ha8
been in the penitentiary and was appointed
shortly after his release. .Thesemengothrougb
the country and give information upon which
people are charged with crimes. That is the
way this secret-service fund is expended. I
do not know but Mr. Seward may employ bet-
ter men, but I have little confidence in trust-
ing any man with the use of a large secret-ser-
vice fund. I am opposed to the si>y system.
I am opposed to it anywhere. I am opposed
to the system inaugurated of recent years of
giving the War Department, the Treasury De-
partment, the State Department, and other
Departments sums of §60,000 and $100,000, to
be expended at their option, and of which no
account is ever to be rendered to the Congress
of the United States. If they are to have that,
money then let us know what it is for. Do not
let us have any more secret agents sent to Rus-
sia or to Denmark for the purchase of worthless
property. I am opposed to the amendment.
[Here the hammer fell.]
Mr. SPALDING. I accept the amendment
of the gentleman from Massachusetts, [Mr.
Baxks,] and modify my proposition accord-
ingly.
The question being put on agreeing to the
amendment of Mr. Spalding as modified,
namely, to strike out $80,000 for contingent
expenses of foreign intercourse and insert
$50,000, there were—ayes 16, noes 51; no
quorum voting.
Tellers were ordered; and the Chair ap-
pointed Messrs. Spalding and Logax,
The eommittes divided ; and the tellers re-
ported—ayes twenty-four, noes not counted.
So the amendment was disagreed to.
Mr. ROBINSON. I move to amend by
inserting after line thirty-three, " for the pro-
tection and defense of the rights of American
citizens ahroad, $100,000.
Mr. WASIIBURNE, of Illinois.. I rise to a
point of order. This is not carrying out any
existing law, and it is making a new law.
Mr. ROBINSON. It is as much in order
as many other amendments.
The CHAIRMAN. The Chair sustains the
point of order.
Mr. ROBINSON. I appeal from the decis-
ion of the Chair. If it is sustained I wish to
object to everything else that comes in. I w ill
meet the gentleman from Illinois [Mr. Wash-
burke] on this subject.
The question being taken on sustaining the
decision of the Chair, there were—ayes sev-
enty-four, noes n.ot counted.
So the decision of the Chair was sustained.
Mr. KELSEY. I move to amend by in-
