Reports of Lieutenant General Leonidas Polk, C. S. Army, commanding

Right Wing.
HEADQUARTERS POLK'S CORPS, ARMY OF TENNESSEE,Anderson's House, September 11, 1863-1 a. m.

COLONEL: Having met the courier with the accompanying dispatch, * I have read and forwarded it. From this you will perceive that General Hindman thinks it doubtful whether the force at his disposal will be adequate for the emergency. Of this the general, perhaps, has better means of judging. In compliance with orders, I shall send the whole of my wagon train (Cheatham's and Hindman's) forward, and shall remain at Anderson's with the troops of Cheatham's division to cover Hindman's, and only to move forward to La Fayette when pressed by the enemy. It is for the commanding general to determine, with General Hindman's communication, whether my presence with Cheatham's division will be of more value to Hill or Hindman. I do not know the difficulties to be encountered in passing from the head of McLemore's Cove over to La Fayette, nor the strength of the force which the enemy can bring against Hill from the direction of Summerville; but I think it of the highest importance that thorough work should be made in the operations of the first attack.
