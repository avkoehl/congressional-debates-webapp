THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
March 2,
the appropriation for the purchase of Mount
VeYnon, without any destination m regard to it,
so that it will read:
For the purcha^o of Mount Vernon, $500,000.
Mr. JONJES, of Tennessee. I offer that amend-
ment for the benefit of my friends here who voted
against the proposition for the purchase of the
Hermitage. It is the identical amendment, offered
by the Senator from Louisiana, and he pledged
himself, as I understood him, to vote for it.
Mr. SEWARD. If the honorable Senator
appeals to me, I will say that I did not pledge
myself to vote with the honorable Senator from
Louisiana; but I did pledge myself to vote
$500,000 for the purchase of Mount Vernon; and
X hope the honorable Senator will agree with ine,
that it is becoming and due to the memory of
Washington, and the character of the American
people, to purchase it without reservations or lim-
itations.
Mr. JONES, of Tennessee. No, sir; I do not
agree to any such thing. I wqfit to be practical.
I wish to honor the memory of Washington prac-
tically. I desire to establish a inihtaiy school
there, and I wish a vote taken oif the proposition
just as it is, in order to see who is for it and who
against it.
Mr. HUNTER. I hope the Senator from
Tennessee will withdraw the amendment.
Mr. JONES, of Tennessee.. I will not with-
draw it. If any man will vote against it, I wish
to know who it is.
Mr. JOHNSON called for the yeas and nays
on the amendment to the amendment, and they
were ordered; and being taken, resulted—yeas
18, nays 28; us follows:
YEAS—Messrs. licll of New n,im}j*Iiire, Brodbcnfl, Col-

So the amendment to the amendment was not
agreed to.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The question
now is on the amendment of the Senatoi from
Tennessee.
Mr. JONES, of Tennessee, called for the yeas
and nays; and they were ordered; and being
taken, resulted—yeas ti, nays 41; as follows:
f YEAS—Messrs. Butler, Jverson, Join]son, Jones of Ten-

Toombs, Touce>, Tiumbull, Wade, Wilson, Wrigut, and
Yuloe—41.
So the amendment wag rejected.
Mr. WELLER. I desire to offer the following
, amendment to die bill, as un additional section:"
Jhxd. be it further enactcd, That out ot any inonev in the
Treasury, the sum of .^30,(MK) bo appiopriafed for the pur-
pose of investigating the etiology and pathology of epidemic
cholera, to be expended uhder tne stipmi.-ionoi the Seeie-
taiyof War bvthe committee of the Ameiiean Medical Av
bociation appointed to investigate said subjects.
I have only to say that this question has been
referred to the Committee on Military Affairs in
the House of Representatives, and the chairman
ol that committee was exceedingly anxious to
have the appropriation made. It would have
been oiFeivd m the House of Representatives but
for the fact that they were prevented from otler-
ing any Amendments whatever to the bill by the
operation of the previous question. I offer it m
good faith; and I have no doubt, if it is adopted,
that many practical benefits will result from it.
The amendment was not agreed to.
No further amendment being offered to the bill,
the amend men ts were ordered to be engrossed, and
the bill to be read a third time. It was read the
third time, and passed.
POST ROUTE BILL.
Mr. RUSK. The Committee on the Post Office
and Post Roads, to whom was referred the bill of
the House of Representatives (No. 852) to estab-
lish certain poot roads in the United States and
the Territories thereof, have had the same under
consideration, and instruct me to report it back
with certain amendments. I ask that it be con-
sidered now.
There being no objection, the Senate proceeded
as m Committee of the Whole to consider the
bill.
Mr. RUSK. I see no use in reading the amend-
ments of the committee or the bill.
Mr. STUART. They need not be read. They
relate to nothing but the establishment of post
routes.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. It requires
unanimous consent to dispense with the reading.
There being no objection, the reading of the
bill and amendments at length was dispensed with,
and the amendmentsof the committee were agreed
to.
The bill was reported to the Senate asamended,
and the amendments, made as in Committee of
the Whole, were concurred in, and ordered to be
engrossed, and the bill leada third time. It was
read the third time and passed.
FORTIFICATION BILL.
Mr. PEARCE, from the Committee on Fi-
nance, to whom was referred the bill (II. R. No. ;
034) making appropriations for fortifications and
other works of defense, and for repairs of bar- !i
racks and quarters, for the year ending the 30th :j
of June, 18o8j reported it without amendment, j
