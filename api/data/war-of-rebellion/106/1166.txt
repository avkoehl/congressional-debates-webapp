FORT CHURCHILL, March 20, 1865.

General GEORGE WRIGHT:

Captain Wells has returned from Pyramid Lake, where he whipped those Indians badly. Captain Wallance returned last night from Walker Lake with the Indians who murdered Stewart and Rabe. Captain Kelly left camp on Owen's River on the 13th to chastise the Indians at Owen's Lake. I have to send cavalry at once to Humboldt to chastise the Indians there.

C. McDERMIT,

Commanding.

His Excellency A. C. GIBBS,

Governor of Oregon, Portland, Oreg.:

SIR: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your three communications of the 7th instant. The request in those relating to the officers from the Oregon infantry and the company in South Oregon had all been anticipated and the orders sent to General Alvord. I have directed copies to be sent you this mail. You will see that the company is to be sent to Fort Klamath, which has been transferred to the District of Oregon. I received with regret and surprise the order for General Alvord's relief from command. I had supposes he was particularly acceptable to the good people of his district as a most zealous and active commander and sound Union man. How or why he was removed I am entirely ignorant.

I am, Governor, very respectfully, your most obedient servant,

IRVIN McDOWELL,

Major-General, Commanding Department.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obdient servant,

IRVIN McDOWELL,

Major-General, Commanding Department.
