Secretary of War.
HDQRS. DEPT. OF SOUTH CAROLINA AND GEORGIA, Charleston, S. C., June 4, 1862.

Brigadier-General MERCER,Commanding James Island, S. C.:

GENERAL: I am directed by the major-general commanding to say that you are not to fall back with your command behind the intrenchments nor to abandon Secessionville. Re-enforcements have been ordered from Savannah, and will soon arrive, who will relieve your present regiments, allowing time for rest. Supplies will soon be furnished and a supply of whisky will be sent to revive your fatigued troops.

I am, &amp;c.,

R. W. MEMMINGER,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

RICHMOND, VA., June 4, 1862.

Major-General PEMBERTON:

The call made on you for troops was the result of pressing necessity. It was hoped the season would secure you against operations inland, and that you could spare troops without weakening your strength for the defense of Charleston. You can estimate the consequence to the common cause which depends upon success here. Send three regiments, or, if you think it safe to do so, send the larger number named by you.

JEFFERSON DAVIS.

CHARLESTON, S. C., June 4, 1862-7 p.m.

JEFFERSON DAVIS, President:

Have just received your dispatch. Shall order three regiments from Savannah. Am drawing re-enforcements from there for Charleston also. The enemy is re-enforcing also, both in gunboats and troops. I may have to abandon one city or the other. Shall meet all your requirements promptly.

J. C. PEMBERTON,

Major-General, Commanding.

CHARLESTON, S. C., June 4, 1862.

JEFFERSON DAVIS, President:

I send four strong regiments under Brigadier-General Lawton. If I could get more heavy guns I could do well.

J. C. PEMBERTON,

Major-General, Commanding.
