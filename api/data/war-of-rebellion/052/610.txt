HDQRS. THIRD DIV., TWENTY-FIRST ARMY CORPS, Reconnaissance near Gordon's Mills, September 13, 1863-2.30 p. m. (Received 3.30 p.m.)

General T. L. CRITTENDEN:

GENERAL: Have ordered General Beatty to return. Am satisfied there is no force near us other than a small cavalry rear guard. We should occupy these corn-fields for our stock. There are no rebels of any account near us, or they would have re-enforced their pickets. We have had several wounded, 2 I fear mortally. Have not seen our cavalry.

Yours,H. P. VAN CLEVE,

Brigadier-General.

HEADQUARTERS TWENTY-FIRST ARMY CORPS, Gordon's Mills, September 13, 1863-7.40 p. m.

Brigadier General J. A. GARFIELD,Chief of Staff:

SIR: From further information just received, I have to correct the report made by Captain McIntyre, Fourth U. S. Cavalry, as to the extent of his reconnaissance to-day. I am satisfied now that he did not go down the Cove road more than 6 miles from this point, instead of 12 as before reported.

On carefully reading your orders of 12.20 and 12.25, I find now that what I considered an order to move is by the latter order only an order to be ready to move. I am now ready with all my command well in hand, and shall await further orders before moving in the direction indicated.

T. L. CRITTENDEN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND, Chattanooga, September 13, 1863.

Major-General CRITTENDEN:

Your dispatch of 7.40 p. m. just received. I have signaled you that the general commanding intends you to execute the orders contained in his dispatch of 12.20 to-night. I know this to have been his intention, and he did not mean you to construe his dispatch of 12.25 differently.

The wording was perhaps unfortunate. Colonel Daniel McCook has arrived here with three regiments and a battery, and will march to Rossville to-morrow morning.

General Gordon Granger will be here in person in the morning, and the rest of his troops will probably reach here to-morrow.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,C. GODDARD,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Assistant Adjutant-General.
