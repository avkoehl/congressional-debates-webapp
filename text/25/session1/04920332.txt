Before Mr Van Bui ems six months m office, befoie a single
bill or resolution lias been sent to him for his signature, he has
voluntarily, gratuitously, stepped out of the line of his duty, to
inform Oongiess that upon at least two measures he will use his
veto 1 haveahostihty to the veto power, and can never bere
conciled to its use Theframersof our*Constitution placed it m
the hands of the Executive undei the fallacious belief that it was
the weakest of the co ordinate branches of Government Sn,

Fedeiolist were mistaken The executive is moiepoweiful
