It will ho noticed that of the hanks on this list
six are in the State of New Yoik organized under
the boasted general law of that State, which, 1
understand, contains no limitation in regard to the
capital of the hank, nor to the amount which any
bank may circulate. Here arc twenty-five banks
with an aggregate capital of §1,932,968 issuing
circulation to the amount of $5,998,088.
Any one who remembers the condition of the
Currency during the war of 1812, or who has read
of it, mufU fee! grateful to the Secretary of the
Treasury, and the country will appreciate his
firmness in resisting the pressure of the hnnksand
inaugurating the financial measure.s which lmve
thus far met with such marked success, instead
of inflicting again upon the country the compli-
cated evils which resulted from the different course
of the Government in the war of 181)3.
1 repeat what Isaul the other day, that the issue
of legal-tender notes was not only a wise meas-
ure, but that it was the only measure that could
have been adopted with safety; and if the Gov-
ernment had, instead of it, depended on the State
banks and used their notes for emrency to carry
on this^wav, it would have proved an utter fail-
ure. The loon bill, including the issue of Ir^al-
tender notes, the national bank act, and the tax
law, were recommended by the Secretary of (lie
Treasury as the three measures to be rohrd upon
to carry the nation through its financial difficul-
ties. The lust Congiess enacted them, and it is
the duty of the present Congress to do all in its
power to perfect them. Th< y certainly hnvc
worked successfully thus far; and I trust any
attempts to perfect them will meet a generous
support from this House.
The gentleman from New York stated the other
day in his speech that the very best section of this
bill was the one which repealed the law of last
year, and thereby condemned it as unendurable
after only the bnef expeiiemvc of a single year.
Nothing can he further from the truth. So far
from condemning that law, th^ sole object of this
bill is to amend and perfect it. Like all n^w mous
ures, fii-it hill was put in tho best shape at the
time to insure its passage. It was in fact a good
bill; not perfect in all its details, hut still a good
bill. Its passage established a most important
principle, and the brief cxpericnce of a single year
has been1 satisfactory. The friends of that law
are riowendeavoringtogive more complete effect
to its principles by introducing this bill to perfect
Its details, and to give more effective action to the
banks which have been and are now rapidly or-
ganizing under it. It is a novel idea that any bill
amending an existing law is a condemnation of
the original law.
The constant denunciation from certain quar-
ters of the financial measures that were adopted
in the last Congress, and of the action of the Sec-
retary of the Treasury, remind one of the robber
crying u stop thief" to divert attention from him-
self. Ft is, m my.opinion, the State banks which
are now doing the most to depreciate the currency
of the country, and they arc deriving large profits
from it. Twenty and even thirtyperccnt. on the
capital has not been unusual ns annual profits of
some of them during the past two years. They
use the legal-tender currency as the basis for ex-
tending their own issues and inflating the cur-
rency, and then complain of the Secretary ol the
Treasury, and of the financial measures that have
been adopted, as the cause of the depreciation.
That the banks are doing this is not a matter
of opinion, but of fact, well known to gentlemen
from New York, and patent to anyone who will
take the trouble to compare the present amount
of the loan3 of the New Yoik banks, or of the
State banks generally, with what thev were be-
fore the suspension of specie payments in Decem-
ber, 1861.
When the great influx of gold from California
commenced a few years since, it was supposed
by many that it would strengthen the currency,
but, instead of being used for that purpose, the
banks madeitthe bnsisforextending their issues,
and they continued to inflate the currency until the
suspension of specie payments occurred in 1857.
It may, with almost as much piopriety, be said
that the inflation of currency which culminated in
the suspension of snccie 'payments in 1857, was
caused by the gold from California, as to say
now, in face of the fact of the great extension of
issues and expansion of the State hanks, that the
present depreciation of the currency js to be solely
attributed to the action of the Secretary of the
Treasury and the effect of the financial measures
of the last Congress.
More gold was exported from the country dur-
ing the ten years that preceded this war than would
have sufficed to supply coined money for the
whole currency of tiny country; but the gold, in-
stead of being used to strengthen the currency,
was made a basis for extending the issues of the
banks, and it was no sooner landed at New York
than it was transferred to a steamer for Europe,
to be sent abroad to pay for the excessive imports
of foreign merchandise, which was induced by
the inflated condition of the currency of the coun-
try. This misuse of the gold from California was
favorable for stock-jobbing and other speculations,
but was a positive injury to all the industrial in-
terests of the country.
The same use is now being made of the legal-
tender currency, which the necessities of the war
have obliged the Government to issue, in the ab-
sence of any other legal and suitable currency
that could be used in the great emcigency of the
war. The State banks ate issuing the iegal-tender
notes as a basis for an enoimous inflation of the
curicncy by the extension of the amount of their
issues and of their loans.
As 1 said before, this statement is nota matter
of nvic opinion, but of fact, that is patent to any
one who will examine, the subject, and compare
the present condition of the State banks with their
condition in the summer of 3^G1.
The gentleman from New Yoi k, [Mr. Brooks,]
in his remai k« last week, said the Sect etory should
retrace his steps and diminish the issues of Gov-
ernment paper. But I would ask him, in all frank-
ness, if he thinks this a suitable time to fund the
legal-tender currency and to dimmish its amount
when demands are pressing on the Treasury De-
partment that cannot be met without availing of
all the resources that Congress has placed at the
disposal of the Secretary; and I would also ask
what other effect it could have, if the Government
should now fund and tetire its issues of legal-
tender notes, than to give greater opportunity to
extend ih« issues of the banks. As the Govern-
ment withdrew their legal-tender notes the banks
would issue so much more of their irredeemable
jSper.
It is useless for the Government to do anything
to diminish the volume of the currency so long as
the State banks exercise the right, and are watch-
ing for every opportunity to extend their circu-
lation; and it is impossible for anything to he
done to correct the depreciation so long as the
State banks are permitted, without any restraints
of law, to fill all the channels of commerce with
their own notes. In no other country, civilized
or uncivilized, does the power exist with private
corporations or individuals to exercise such a con-
trol over the currency of the country. Nowhere'
but here is the sovereign and irresponsible power
delegated to individuals and to private corpora-
tions of furnishing and controlling the currency,
which measures the value of all the property of
the country. The cost of paper is only the ex-
pense of the paper and engraving and the trouble
of preparing and signing the notes; but wherever
it is used it regulates the price of all the salable
property in the community. Mr. Webster in
one of his speeches said, in reference to the ex-
cessive issues of the banks, that it was " the most
effectual of inventions to fertilize the rich man's
field with the sweat of the poor man's brow," and
"that banks should be restrained from issuing
for circulation bills or notes under a given sum,
eay ten or twenty dollars; this would diminish
the circulation, and consequently the profits of
the banks; but it is of less importance to make
banks highly profitable institutions to the stock-
holders than that they should be safe and useful
to the community." How much more important
is this now than at the time it was uttered by Mr.
Webster; now, when the life-blood of the nation
is being exhausted by adding the excessive issues
of the State banks to what the Government ia
obliged to issue to sustain itself!
I understand Mr. Webster to have meant that
when a stuuly pioneer in one of the new States
of the West is induced to borrow money on the
pledge of his land at three to five per cent, a
month, he usually finds, after two or thtee years
of toil, that he has received no benefit from his
labor; that the land he has clcared and cultivated
has by law become the property of his accommo-
dating but shrewder neighbor, and thereby it has
bccome the rich man's field, fertilized by the
sweat of this poor man's brow. I do not wish
to be understood as saying that this occurs only
at the West. The same thing is constantly go-
ing on in the eastern States. The popular delu-
sion that business is so profitable in this country
that men can afford to pay one or two percent, a
month for money tempts enterprising men to ex-
tend their operations and to engage in new un-
dertakings, and in the majority of cases with
precisely the result, illustrated by this pithy ex-
pression of Mr. Webster. It is to prevent the
national banks from making such loans that we
limit the rate of interest, nor in any case to ex-
ceed the rate of seven per cent, per annum; and
this rate was selected because it is the legal rate
in the great commerc^l State of New York.
The banks authorized under this national law
arc restricted and contioiled in regard to the
amount of currency they can issue and the rate
of interest on their loans. In none of them can
the amount of curiency exceed the amount of the
capital; and the whole amount of currency to be
issued is limited to $300,000,000. The provis-
ions of the law contain every suitable piiviiigo
that should be granted to any bankp; every in-
ducement is offered to organize the capital of the
existing State banks under its piovisions Lyoffer-
ing every facility to make the change, and to bring
in their circulation as a part of the $300,000,000
which tins law establishes as the maximum of
the circulation of bank notes.
If anything is to be attempted by Congress to
control the present depreciation of the currency,
the light must be assumed to regulate the issues
of notes that fin msh the curiency of the country;
and the circulation of any notes as money that aro
not sanctioned by this national law must be pre-
vented by the enforcing of soiiie stiingent enact-
ment. So long as the State banks are allowed to
issue their notes without restraint to be used as
money, any action of Congress or of the Tieasury
Depai tment to pt event the depreciation of the cur-
rency is useless. It is just as wrong and just aa
