appropriation Bill—Mr. McKay.
"If those prices could be maintained—if they could be
even protected against sudden reduction—they would
be cause of gratulation, rather than of complaint.
But the expansion of the currency, by the issue of
bank paper, in a period of prosperity, will inevita-
blv be succeeded by its contraction, in periods of
adversity." Mr. Crawford further estimated, that,
at the close of the year 1819, the circulation had
been reduced to $45,000,000; and then sap, that "a
change so violent could not fail, under the most fa-
vorable auspices in other respects, to produce much
distress, to check the ardor of enterprise, and se-
riously to affect the productive energies of the na-
tion." In confirmation of these views, he would
again refer to a table, showing the prices of the
principal articles forming the army ration, in those
different years:

Itwas time to return tothe point from whichhe had
digressed. What had been done with the money
in the Treasury, notwithstanding the successive ef-
forts that were made to reduce its amount! In the
first place, the whole of the public debt was paid off.
The amount of that debt on the 1st of January, 1829,
according to the Treasury report, was 858,416,418
06, and as there were no payments on account of it
between that day and the 4th of March following, it
follows that that sum was the amount of the debt on
the latter day, when Jackson's administration com-
menced. Of the principal thus due, $51,405,385 17
were paid before the 3lst of December, 1832, being
more than double the amount of payments in any
previous term of four years. The balance was
paid off as fast as it became due, or the certificates of
it were presented at the Treasury, and the whole of
the public debt, excepting a very small sum un-
claimed, was thus extinguished before the 31st
December, 1836. The amount of payments during
the four years, from 1825 to 1828 inclusive, on ac-
count of the principal of the public debt, was
#25,304,154 55, being at the rate of $6,326,038 63
per annum; whereas the payments for the same pur-
pose, from 1829 to 1832 inclusive, were «12,851,341
29 per annum. Even spread the payments made dur-
ing the administration of Jackson over both terms,
and there will still be a larger annual payment than
was made by any of his predecessors. It was true
that as the principal of the debt was larger before
1829, that the payments on account of the accruing
interest, prior to that year, would be necessarily
greater than they were subsequently.
[Here Mr. McKay was interrupted by Mr.
White of Kentucky, who said that the statements
made by the gentleman from North Carolina were
so extraordinary that he could not permit him to
proceed without at once noticing them. Here Mr.
White read from a document whieh he held, the
amount of payments on account of the public debt
in. each Of the four years from 1825 to 1828 inch;-
sive, showing an aggregate, during that term, of
«45.303,533 83.                                  5
While Mr. White was on the floor, he was call-
ed to order by Mr. Vanderpoel of New York, and
the latter, by Mr. Stanly of North Carolina.]
Mr. McKay resumed. The gentleman from
Kentucky has not been attending to my remarks
very closely, or he would not have misapprehended
them as he seems to have done. When interrupted
by him, he [Mr. McKay] was speaking of the
payment of the principal of the public debt. He
expressly admitted that the accruing interest was
larger prior to 1829; and the learned gentleman
from New York, [Mr. Barnard,] who sits just be-
fore him, will recollect the admission, as he signi-
fied his assent to the remark at the time, to be sure,
for the reason, as he understood from a question
now asked by him, that payment on account of the
interest was equivalent to payment of the principal.
Indeed it was so obvious, that the interest would be
more during the one period than the other, that he
did not think it necessary to enlarge upon it. He
certainly had no wish or intention to misrepresent
any thing on this subject. The simple truth alone
was sufficient for his purpose. But even the tables,
from which the gentleman read, are calculated to
mislead, unless very carefully examined.
As a proof of this, the gentleman read from
one column of the tables, that in the year 1825,
there was a payment of $12,095,344 78, on account
of the public debt, principal and interest. He for-
got, or did not read from another column of the
same tables, showing that $5,000,000 was borrowed
that year for the purpose of that payment, and thus
the apparent payment of $12,095,344 78 was reduced
to$7,095,344 78. He presumed thatmany ofthe vari-
ous loans, authorized at different times, had beenap-
Eliedinthesame way; but what proportion of them he
ad not the means of ascertaining. It may also be
remarked here, that a part of the payments on ac-
count ofthe public debt from 1812 to 1822, consisted
merely ofthe redemption of Treasury notes issued
during those years. There was another view that
might be taken of the public debt, which would con-
trast the administration of General Jackson, in re-
gard to it, still more favorably with any that pre-
ceded it. It, was presented by the following state-
ment, showing its increase or decrease during the
term of each four consecutive years, from the com-
mencement of the Federal Government to the 31st
December, 1836, by a comparison of the amount of
the debt as exhibited in the public records at the
beginning and close of each term. The amount of
thepublicdebtonthe 1st January, 1791, being the
first period at which it was stated, according to the
Treasury report, was
#75,169,974 21

do     1833,     7,001,032 88       do     51,405,385 17
And the balance of seven millions was paid off
prior to the 1st of January, 1837, excepting a very
small sum, say #127,807 55, not applied for.    Thus,
according to this statement, and supposing that there
were no material payments between the   1st   of
January and the close of each of those terms and
the 4th of March following, the commencement of
the several Presidential terms, or if there were any
payments between those days, that they were equal
in the different terms, the debt was either increased
or decreased, during each Administration, as fol-
lows:
It was increased during Washington's adminis-
tration ---           - $5,764,049 33
During the four years of the elder
Adams       ...           -   1,066,143 82
It was reduced  during Jefferson's
eight years             -           -           - 25,267,787 55
During Madison's 1st term -           -      824,927 58
It was increased during Madison's
second term            -           -           - 59,900,353 58
It was reduced during Monroe's eight
years           .... 32,097,232 88
During J. a. Adams's term -           - 25,304,154 55
During Jackson's eight years           - 58,416,418 05
And to this latter sum might be added upwards
of a million of dollars, paid in satisfaction of Yir-
H. of Reps.
ginia Revolutionary claims. Also, between six
and seven millions, or more, paid to the Cherokees
and others, to procure a cession of their lands within
the limits of Georgia, as the Government was
bound by i's compact with that State, made in
1802, to extinguish the Indian title to the same
as soon as pracu'eab'e. lie would not include
the la'-ge sums that h; i been paid during the same
period to the States of Connecticut, Massachusetts,
North Carolina, and South <": rolina, either for ser-
vices or supplies during t' j late war with Great
Britain, as similar payments had been made during
former Administrations. This was a short history
of the payment of the public debt. He did not in-
tend to claim for Jackson's administration any ex-
traordinary merit in effei Kig its total extinguish-
ment. Much might be conceded to the operation of
the sinking fund, fir^t es'a >lished in 1795. Indeed,
it might be admitted that, "through every change
of administration, and amidst all the revolutions of
parties, the extinguishment of the debt was a fun-
damental maxim in the system of public credit of
the United States." But, after all these admissions,
he still thought that the country would accord to
General Jackson high praise for the distinguished
fidelity with which he had, dm ing his administra-
tion, applied all the means at the disposal of the Go-
vernment to the extinction of the nation-1 debt. The
venerable gentleman from Massnc huseits [Mr.
Adams] in the report to which he had already so
often referred, with equal magnanimity and
justice, says: "To the Congress of the Uni-
ted States, and, in a particular manner, to the.
Representatives of the people in this House, theperiod
of the total emancipation of the nation from the
thraldom of a public debt, will be a moment of in-
tense interest and of heartfelt gratulation. To
have co-operated in the accomplishment of this
event, is a laudable object of ambition. To have wit-
nessed and contributed to its accomplishment, dur-
ing his own term of service, is a legacy of honor
and integrity, which any public ser rant "may be de-
sirous of leaving for the memory of his children and
the gratitude of posterity. As a monument of good
faith, active industry, and strenuous exertion for the
fulfilment of public engagements, it is an ex-
ample of morality, well worthy of that com-
munity which was also the first among
the nations of the earth to lay the fouundatioas of
her Government upon the basis of freedom and the
inalienable rights of human kind." The next ap-
plication ofthe money, which he would notice, was
the deposite with the States, by the act of 23d June,
1836, of $28,101,644 94. To this may be
added about $3,500,000, given either to the States or
their corporations, in the foim of remission of duties
on railroad iron. Mr. McKay said that he would go
on tp show that while the Government was doing all
this—reducing the revenue—paying offa vast public
debt, and depositing, or rather giving thirty-two mil-
lions to the States, it had made liberal appropriations to
public works and establishments, armories, arsenals,
fortifications, navy yards, &c. that large sums had
been appropriated to laying in materials for our
navy—fitting out some of the noblest vessels in the
world—arming our fortresses—rebuilding public
edifices, and other objects assumed to be of a useful
and national character. Also, that many millions
had been paid in extinguishing the Indian titles to
lands within the States and Territories—an acqui-
sition which will, in time, restore, by tenfold, the
sums paid out of the Treasury—which will give
birth to a population which will refund annually,
and forever, much more than the cost of the terri-
tory. But let us proceed to the proofs of this, which
will b? best afforded by a comparative review, either
of the condition of various branches of the public
service before and since 1829, or the amount of ex-
penditures in them, and in this way we may ascer-
tain the principal items upon which there has been
an increase.
He would begin with the navy, which has been
a favorite with the nation generally, since the last
war with Great Britain. The amount of efficient
naval force afloat, on the 1st of October, in each of
the years 1829 and 1839 was as follows:
Vessels. Line. Razee. Frieatea. Sloop . Steamers. Small vessels
1829     2       0        6       11          0             4
1839     5       1        f        19          1             9
And according to the estimates, the number of per-
sons that it was proposed to employ and pay in
those two years respectively, was as follows:
Years.      'Officers.       Petty officer* seamen, &c.       ToJ«K
1829       1,066                5,236                    6,302
1839       1,184                e>?31                     7,815
From this it appeared that the number of yesselj
