The transfer of active operations in this military division to Northwestern Georgia rendered the railroads radiating from Memphis,of little service to military operations, and 7 engines and 46 cars were transferred thence to Nashville.

In April 15 engines and 120 cars were taken from the Louisville and Nashville Railroad.

In May 2 engines and 60 cars were impressed from the Kentucky Central Railroad, and 2 engines and 15 cars from the Louisville and Lexington Railroad, in addition to the new U. S. Military Railroad engines and cars constantly arriving from the manufacturers.

The demand for transportation continued to increase, and with all the enlarged facilities it was not fully met until August.
