HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT SOUTHEAST MISSOURI, Cairo, October 16, 1861.

Captain CHAUNCEY McKEEVER,Asst. Adjt. General, Western Dept., Saint Louis, Mo.:

SIR: Two dispatches from General Fremont were received to-day and promptly attended to. I also received a dispatch from General Sherman, stating that Hardee had effected a junction with Buckner, and they were threatening Louisville; requesting me at the same time, in connection with General Smith, to make a demonstration on Columbus. Sending troops to Cape Girardeau, as I have done to-day, and having out another expedition of some 200 men, it will be a day or two before any move can be made. I will communicate with General Smith and co-operate in any demonstration that may seem to recommend itself. I have no reliable information from the enemy not already communicated.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

U. S. GRANT,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT SOUTHEAST MISSOURI, Cairo, Ill., October 16, 1861.

Brigadier General C. F. SMITH,Commanding U. S. Forces, Paducah, Ky.:

I send you to-day a copy of a dispatch received from General Sherman.* If you have any plan to propose, I am ready to co-operate to the extent of my limited means. I had to send off quite an expedition to the neighborhood of Ironton to-day by orders from headquarters Western Department, and have another expedition out at the same time. Five thousand is the greatest number of men I could start out with.

U. S. GRANT,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT SOUTHEAST MISSOURI, Cairo, October 17, 1861.

Captain CHAUNCEY McKEEVER,Asst. Adjt. General, Western Dept., Saint Louis, Mo.:

CAPTAIN: In pursuance of telegraphic instructions from the commanding general, I sent from here Colonel Marsh's regiment of Illinois volunteers, three companies of cavalry, and a section of artillery, to be re-enforced by two regiments from Cape Girardeau, to go in pursuit of Thompson and such of the rebel army as have been committing depredations on the Iron Mountain Railroad.

There is a great difficulty in procuring storage here for commissary and quartermaster's stores, particularly since the fleet of gunboats have commenced making preparations for fitting out. I have directed the employment of a very large wharf boat, capable of storing 2,500 tons, subject to the approval of the department commander. This accommodation, it now seems, the gunboat fleet wants. I ordered it more particularly for the commissary and ordnance departments. A great proportion of the rations issued from here going by water to the different posts, an immense labor is saved in hauling by storage upon the water.
