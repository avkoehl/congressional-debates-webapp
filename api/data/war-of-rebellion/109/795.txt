General R. H. CHILTON:

General Imboden reports from Shenandoah Mountain, 6.30 p. m., 12th instant, Averell and Mulligan, with 4,000 strong (3,000 cavalry, 1,000 infantry), at Monterey yesterday morning. Cavalry moved up Crab Bottom, he thinks, to cook rations yesterday and move on him to-day. Home guard (300 mounted) marched to his support this morning. Have about 300 convalescents and hands here organized, armed and ready for service. Major Gillmor reports the enemy at Front Royal in force night of 11th instant.

J. Q. A. NADENBOUSCH,

Colonel, Commanding Post.

Assistant Adjutant-General.

Lieutenant-General EWELL:

GENERAL: Nadenbousch telegraphs from Staunton that Colonel W. L. Jackson, at Warm Springs, being pressed on his right by the enemy, has fallen back toward Callaghan's, west.

Do you desire infantry sent to Stauton? I should think one of Hill's brigades might go.

Respectfully,

W. H. TAYLOR,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

Assistant Adjutant-General:

R. E. LEE,

General.
