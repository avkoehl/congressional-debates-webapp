THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
May 7,
two hundred and sixty-four will no longer be
required, and the number of articles released,
in proportion to tlxc whole number remaining
taxed, is still greater.
The law authorizing the Secretary of the
Treasury to assign to the Bureau of Internal
Revenue a sufficient force to carry it on will
expire by its own limitation on the 1st of July
next, and it therefore becomes necessary to
make some arrangement for the permanent
organization of the bureau. It will be seen that
the bill makes provision for this object. The
operations of this bureau are now on so large a
scale as to require the services of able, clear-
headed men, trained to business, and of unques-
tioned integrity. Such men in our country are
highlyprized, and command thehighestsalaries
paid in financial and commercial employments,
and unless we fix salaries at an adequate or
competing point we shall only command the
services of second-rate men. The bane of the
Treasury Department is that so soon as officers
receive the stamp of its confidence they receive
a loud call and the offer of more pay to go
elsewhere. The best officers are, therefore,
often mere birds of passage, here to-day but
may be gone to-morrow. The Bureau of In-
ternal Revenue, it is quite apparent, is deficient
in executive force. It is impossible that the
Commissioner, however faithful and industri-
ous, and I know of no man more so, should
be able to consider all the complicated cases
daily arising for investigation in the adminis-
tration of his office, and we have conceded not
only the propriety but the absolute necessity
of reenforcing the office by two additional
deputies and one solicitor.
Notwithstanding all the disadvantages we
have labored under in putting new and untried
laws suddenly into operation, it is gratifying
to find that the expense of collecting the rev-
enue has been far less than was anticipated—
including everything except printing done by
the Public Printer—amounting, in 1865, to no
more than two and seventy-live one hundredths,
or two and three fourths per cent. This con-
trasts most favorably with the cost of collection
in Great Britain, where, after years of experi-
ence, the cost varies from foar and one quarter
to five and three fourths per cent.
The services of the gentlemen employed on
the revenue commission, I have no doubt, are
properly appreciated by Congress, as they will
be by the country, and the Committee of Ways
and Means were unanimously, I believe, of the
opinion that this kind of service should not be
entirely discontinued. Believing that at least
one similar officer can be profitably employed
permanently, they have added a section to the
bill for this purpose, and I have no doubt it will
prove wise economy to adopt and continue it
so long as we may be compelled to raise any-
thing like our present revenues from taxation.
The military power of the United States
needs no eulogiums from any quarter. Its
supremacy at home is not likely to be ques-
tioned, and when it is challenged elsewhere it
will be time enough to answer back. Its finan-
cial power, also, even in the agonies of civil
strife, has been vindicated. No stain of dis-
honor rests upon its credit. Every promise
has been kept with entire good faith. So cred-
itor, holding the obligations of the nation, has
had to do more than to ask and receive. No
faithful soldier has closed his service without
receiving at the same moment with his honor-
able discharge the last dollar due. Is there,
then, any lurking danger as to our present and
future financial condition ? The confidence of
the people in their own Government cannot be
shaken ; the vigor and elasticity of American
industry is unrivaled; our resources, abundant
to-day, will be greater to-morrow; no empire,
ancient or modern, ever received, daily or
annually, revenues of equal magnitude, and
the wealth hidden in some of our single mount-
ains, if it could be placed in the balance, would
make our national debt kick the beam. Where,
then, is the cloud no bigger than a man's hand?
It rises only in that quarter from whence dis-
loyal representatives may come. Open and
inchoate repudiators lust for power. Save us
from these and the United States Government
will survive, with its credit and civil glories ra-
diant with youth and the fame of ages, long after
the final chapter in the history of anti-repub-
lican Governments shall have been written.

Mr. RAYMOND. I am sure the House has
listened with very great satisfaction tothe clear
and interesting statement which has just been
made by the chairman of the Committee of
Ways and Means of the financial condition of
the country. It cannot but give satisfaction
to find the country prepared for an immediate
reduction in the amount of its internal revenue
so very considerable as that which the commit-
tee proposes to make. And it will be equally
satisfactory to the House and to the country to
find that this reduction is to operate so gener-
ally upon those processes and articles which,
are of most importance to the great mass of
the people of this nation.
I am unwilling to trespass to any consider-
able extent upon the patience of the House j
but I shall be glad, with its indulgence, to make
a few remarks upon the general subject of tax-
ation, especially in the attitude in which we
approach it now. Perhaps I may find an apol-
ogy for so doing in the fact tliat it is a wholly
new subject. Until within the last few years,
we have made it our boast, justly and truly,
that wc were the most lightly taxed nation on
the face of the earth. Now we are compelled
to confess that we are among the most heavily
burdened of them all. This, sir, is one of the
many vast changes which have been wrought
in our condition by the rebellion we have just
suppressed. We have incurred a vast debt
consequent on the war for the suppression of
that rebellion.
We have, moreover, provided, necessarily,
for a permanent increase, more or less consid-
erable, in the ordinary expenses of the Gov-
ernment. Those expenses must be met year
by year. The interest upon the debt must also
be met as it becomes due; and I think it of the
utmost importance in all respects to our credit,
to our character, and to the courage with which
all burdens will be borne by the people, that
we should lose no time in making a begin-
ning toward paying off the principal of that
debt. It does not seem to me wise, sir, that
we should begin to accustom ourselves or the
creditors of the nation, the people upon whom ^
these obligations rest, to the idea that this debt*
may bo fastened upon us like the debts of Eng-
land and of France, never to be paid through
ail time to come.
The ordinary expenses of the Government,
as they are estimated by the Secretary of the
Treasury in his report, laid upon our tables at
the opening of the session, are $143,000,000.
The interest to be paid during this year is fixed
at about the same amount, some two millions
less. Both these sums, I think there is reason
to suppose, may be somewhat reduced. The
expenses of the Army and Navy are not likely
to be as high as they were originally estimated;
and the amount which will be due for interest
will be somewhat reduced by the fact that the
Secretary of the Treasury is not likely to fund
so much of the debt now bearing no interest as
it was originally supposed he wonld. But these
two sums, taking them at his estimates, make
the considerable amount of $284,000,000, which
will be required to meet the expenses of the
Government and the interest on the debt for
one year.
I think we ought also to begin at once to
make some provision for paying the principal
of the national debt. I do not think it would
be wise for us to provide less than $50,000,000
per annum for that purpose, the sum to be
increased from year to year as our system of
taxation may be perfected, and as the industry
may gradually adapt itself to the new burdens
which are imposed upon it. This would make
an aggregate sum of $33-1,000,000 to be provided
annually toward meeting the expenses of the
Government and the interest and installments
on the principal of the public debt. This sum
will be required annually, without any serious
