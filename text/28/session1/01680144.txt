to pension agents; which was read, and ordered

HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
Monday, January 15, 1844.
The journal having been readâ€”
Mr. RELFE rose and moved the suspension of
the rules, to enable him to introduce the following
resolution:
Resolved, That, after three o'clock to-morrow, the
Committee of the Whole House be discharged from
the further consideration of the resolution in commit-
tee, refering so much of the President's message as
relates to the "Western waters to the Committee on
Commerce, and that the said resolution be reported
with the amendments, if any, at that hour.
Mr. RELFE remarked that he was induced to
propose to this resolution from various consider-
ations. The subject had been before the committee
for many days, eliciting much debate, and it did seem
to him, the subject was exhausted, at least so far as
concerned information necessary to the House; but
a more imperious necessity prompted him to present
and urge upon the House the adoption of the resolu-
tion. yesterday's mail brought the melancholy in-
telligence of the wreck of another steamboat in the
Mississippi river, almost within the harbor of St.
Louis, which caused the loss of life to some fifty or
sixty persons, under the most distressing circum-
stances. We have heard, (said Mr. Relfe,) from day
to day, in this House, strong professions of friendly
feeling towards Western appropriations, by gentle-
men from the South, the North, and the East; and
he would now earnestly ask of those gentlemen to
give some immediate action on this matter. It is
action we want to satisfy Western people; give us
the means of protecting the lives and property of
our people against the dangers of Western naviga-
tion.
The question was then taken, resulting in 71 ayes
and 61 noes:
So the suspension was not carried, there not being
a majority of two-thirds.
PRANKING PRIVILEGES.
The following resolution submitted by M. Pat-
terson on Saturday, was taken up for consider-
tion:
Resolved, That the Postmaster General be directed
to report to this House the number of drop and free
letters each, received at all the post offices in the
United States for the last twelve months, ending at
the latest time that he has correct returns; also, such
other information at he may be in possession of, if
any, showing the quantity of mail matter transmitted
through other channels; also, the nearest estimate
that he can furnish of the gross amount of Govern-
ment franking in nil its branches, exclusive of the
Post Office Department, for a single year.
A short discussion then ensued, in which the res-
olution was supported by Messrs. PATTERSON",
BEARDi^LEY, and CARROLL, and opposed by
Mr. HOPKINS.
Mr. KENNEDY said that, inasmuch as the
Chairman of the Committee on the Pom Office and
Post Roads had declared, a few minutes a>jo, that
that committee were unanimous ill favor of a tho-
rough refoini in that department of the Govern-
ment; and inasmuch as the gentleman from New
York, who has just taken his seat, has expressed
his opinion that that reformation should embrace the
relieving the Post Office Department from the bur-
dAn of transmitting communications from the other
depaitments of Government free of postage, he felt
it his duty, as a member of the Committee on the
Po:'. Office and Post Roads, to say, that although he
was favorable to a proper reformation in the post
office charges of the Government, yet that reforma-
tion should be kept within certain defined limits.
Jle stated that lie was willing to reduce the postage
on letters and other mail matter, provided that reduc-
tion would not reduce the net revenues of the de-
partment. This, it is contended, will not be its ef-
fect. If so, well; but on this subject he wished to
be distinctly understood. For one, he intended to
make that department depend entirely on its own rev-
enues for support. In no event would he consent
to charge the general treasury with any part of its
burdens. For, to do so, would be to charge the
great mass of the people, who have but little or no
connexion with its benefits, with the postages of
those who use this department to facilitate their busi-
ness, and increase their pleasure. To such an ar-
rangement he would never consent.
After some further conversation, the reconsidera-
tion, by consent, was postponed until to-morrow.
