HEADQUARTERS FIRST DIVISION, CAVALRY CORPS, Rockford, Tennessee, November 13, 1863-10 p.m.

Maj. Gen. J. G. PARKE,Chief of Staff, Army of the Ohio:

GENERAL: Major Graham reports his scouts just in from Niles' Ferry and Morganton roads; says those on the Niles' Ferry (on McGhee's Ferry) road drove some rebel pickets to within 4 miles of the brick mill, where he reports there is a rebel force of some 300. I will send out a sufficient force to see, and try and capture some of them. He reports they are hauling flour from this mill and another. The parties on both roads bring the same report. I will be able to let you know more about them to-morrow, I hope.

Respectfully,

W. P. SANDERS,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

LOUDON, November 13, 1863.

Major-General PARKE:

The picket at Huff's Ferry, 6 miles below but within a half mile of Loudon, reports the enemy crossing in some sort of a flat-boat. I have ordered a regiment of infantry, a section of artillery, and the few cavalry I have, to go down immediately and see if the crossing is the commencement of a bridge or otherwise.

JULIUS WHITE.

Major-General PARKE:

My lower picket, posted at Huff's Ferry, 6 miles below here by the river, but only half a mile across the neck at Loudon, reports the enemy moving into Loudon in force and from the south. Think there is a good deal of artillery. They were moving on the Pond Creek road with a good deal of stir and noise. The movement commenced at dark.

JULIUS WHITE,

Brigadier-General.

LOUDON, November 13, 1863.

General PARKE:

I have no information confirming the report about Longstreet. There is nothing visible in my front except the enemy's

picket-line. I can add my opinion about the Longstreet news should you think it worth anything.

JULIUS WHITE,

Brigadier-General.
