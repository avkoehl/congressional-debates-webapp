Colonel JOHN S. PRESTON, Columbia, S. C.:

COLONEL: I have the honor to request that you will do all in your power toward collecting and forwarding to Richmond the men subject to military duty under the act of Congress of April 16, 1862. The regiments from South Carolina are much reduced by sickness and battle, and it is highly important that their depleted ranks should be filled. General Orders, Numbers 30, from the office of the Adjutant and Inspector General, directs that assignments, when made at camps of instruction, shall be proportioned among all the regiments of the State.

By letter of yesterday's date the honorable Secretary of War informs me that the conscripts from South Carolina have been ordered here, and that the entire subject of assignment has been committed to me. As soon, therefore, as you will forward them to Richmond I will order them to the several regiments from the State, in accordance with the instructions received from the Department.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,R. E. LEE,,

General.
