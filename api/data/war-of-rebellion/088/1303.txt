General EWELL,

Chaffin's Bluff:

Have telegraphed General Bragg to order out locals. Endeavor to retake Fort Harrison.

R. E. LEE.

CHAFFIN'S BLUFF, September 29, 1864 - 6 a. m.

General BRAGG:

Affairs look serious. Pickets driven in. While Gardner is away would it not be best to place Kemper in command of locals or else Pemberton? All disposable troops should be on the lines. The enemy have possession of Fort Harrison.

R. S. EWELL,

Lieutenant-General.

CHAFFIN'S BLUFF, September 29, 1864.

(Received 9.50 a. m.)

General BRAGG:

Enemy approaching Richmond by the New Market road in large force. Gary is holding Chaffin's interior line-the locals must hold interior line.

R. S. EWELL.

CHAFFIN'S BLUFF, September 29, 1864.

General BRAGG;

I have already reported that the local troops will be required to meet enemy's advance on New Market road. Gary reports advance of a division. Gary has been sent to meet them. I will extend to my left, but enemy are still in my front.

R. S. EWELL.

CHAFFIN'S BLUFF, September 29, 1864.

General BRAGG:

If some troops could be sent down the Osborne road, I may hold the enemy in check till General Lee sends me re-enforcements. Enemy hold much of the intrenchments around Fort Harrison, and I have great difficulty in keeping my men together, who are scattering much, being new troops.

R. S. EWELL,

Lieutenant-General.

CHAFFIN'S BLUFF, September 29, 1864 - 2.30 p. m.

General BRAGG;

One brigade of Field's division has arrived, and is directed to a point in repelling attack near Fort Gilmer. One regiment has arrived from Pickett and is placed to protect Chaffin's. I have directed Gary to cover Darbytown road. Some local troops should move in that direction as the enemy are extending toward the Darbytown road. General Anderson is here.

R. S. EWELL.
