Your dispatch just received. The force at La Mine bridge is armed with revolvers, and it is thought with the assistance of the militia they are able to protect the battery against any force that will be likely to come against them.

You are directed to move all records pertaining to the District of Central Missouri to this place with as little delay as practicable. Re-establish headquarters and take such measures as will further the organization of the district with the least delay.

HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF SOUTHWEST MISSOURI,Springfield, Mo., November 1, 1864.

Major-General ROSECRANS,

Commanding Department, Warrensburg:

The Fourth Brigade has passed south of Cassville. Colonel Harrison had some fighting at Fayetteville on the 28th, and was successful. He thinks the enemy are moving some troops up through the mountains from the Arkansas River. Cooper and Stand Watie have had but 1,800 men with them the last forty days and have abandoned all idea of moving north since Price failed to take Jefferson City and to support himself at Lexington, where Stand Watie says he expected to remain some time. I am starting troops and rations south as fast as I can.

JOHN B. SANBORN,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
