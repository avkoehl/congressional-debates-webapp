to erect a monument of marble to this commissioner who had
investigated the affairs of the New York custom house
Mr WISE   Mr Speaker, the gentleman------
Mr. ADAMS, (warmly ) No, sir the gentleman shall ex-
platn after I have done
Mr. WISE said the gentleman had put a construction on the
published report of yesterday'sproceedmgs, which they would
not bear; and he wished to set the gentleman right He had
been told that he had been misunderstood by otheisalso, and
he wished to say that he had not meant to say that the commis
Burners' report would be found to be true He did not mean to
endorse it, but to judge it after he had examined it, andhe
merely intended tp inform the Representatives from Massachu
setts that there was such matter in it which it was all impoitant
the gentlemen should be acquainted with, as well as the gentle
men who were attacked, that they might defend themselves
against those charges Theie was one gentleman attacked,
that he would defend as warmly as any friend he had on that
floor—a gentleman connected with the manufacturing interests
of Boston, and the manufactuung interests of the country—
against whom he should require the very strongest evidence to
piove any thing like bribery He haj intended also, to com
plain on behalf of the manufactuung interest of the North, and
of gentlemen connected with the manufacturing interest, that
this report, inculpating their characters, had been brought in
improperly, if not surreptitiously, forestalling the reports to be
made by two other of the commissioneis, whose reports would
have done those manufacturing gentlemen justice He meant
to complain that injury was unjustly done to them, and he said
this, and he now repeated it—and he was sure the gentleman
from Massachusetts would approve it—that if the charges were
true, a debt of grautude would be due to George Poindexter for
bringing them to light He hoped the gentle > an understood
him He complained of the printing of that report before the
reports of the othei commissioners were brought in A letter
had been biought there from the President, and it must have
got there through the instrumentality of George Poindexter
himself
Mr CAMPBELL interposed, and remarked that the gentle
man from Virginia had usen for a personal exp'ana ion, and
was now going into a discussion of o ,ei matter, and if this
were tolerated, the friends ol the other commissioners must be
heard also
Mr WISE said he wished them to hp heard, and he warned
Messrs Kelly and S ewart that then íeports ougM to come to
the House pari passu with the report of George Poindexter
he desired this, though an anti tariff man himself He hoped
the gentleman from Massachusetts n iw understood him He
also wanted th= letter of George Poindexter, to which the letter
of tnePresident read there yesteiday wasan answer, called foi
and brought up
Mr CHARLES BROWN rose to a point of order This
debate had arisen on the piesentation of a petition, in regard to
which the rules required that the substance o ily should be
stated by the member presenting ¡t
Mr W W IRWIN called the gentleman from Pennsyl
vania [Mr C Brown] to older
Mr CUSHING moved that his colleague have leave to pio
Mr ADAMS resumed He was happy to íeceivethe expla
nation of the gentleman from Virginia, because it appeared
that, in asking the favor whit h he had solicited fiom the House,
he had done that which the gentleman from Vnginia desired
should be done for he alleged his motive in making the re-
marks which he had made to the House yesterday, to be o give
an opportunity to meet the chaiges Ho said his motive was 10
inform th" ¡tentlemen of the charges, and certainly, in giving
them that information, it was his intention that they should
notice it properly, and that could only be done in the
manner in which he [Mr Adams] was proceeding
The memorial which he then presented he received last
night, and it gave him the oppoitunltv, as he conceived
to demand this right, for it lelated to a protective tariff,
which thegreat' Pondextel gun" was to blow sky high, besides
blasting the chaiacter, by charging them with corruption and
bribery, of Jie manufacturers of Lowell And these were theiea
sons why he called upon his colleague  to answer these charges
He thanked the gentleman fio n Virginia for la  motives, and
he would take the benefit of t em a id he now asked leave to
present this memorial in the manrer which he had signified
He also asked leave to read the remaiks made by the gentle
man from Virginia [Mi Wise] yester 1 ,y, to show the mteiest
•which he and all his colleagues had in this subject The gen
tleman from Virginia [Mr Wise] thus spoke of one of the com
unssionere, according to the report
"He then proceeded to inquire who was George Pnmdex eri
And, after passing high compliments on his intelligence and
standing, his fearlessless and independence, an1 admitting lie
had been among the leadn g menbers m the Senate, and the
Aiax of legislation in his own State, mfeired 'rom the whole
that he must well know the couioe of the committee to be an
abuse, and, if now on the floor of the Sena e, wou'd be the last
manto justify it "
The gentleman Irom Virginia had since letracted, and said
that Governoi Poindexter had communication under summons
Mr WISE exp ained He was rot answerable for the re
port of the Intelligencer, which the gentleman from Massachu
setts had quoted, the report was incoi rect indeed, it professed
but tobe a cunentreport The reporter was in euor in mat
Ins him call Governor Poindexter ihe Ajax of legislation—he
had said Atlas If he had been fully reported, he would not
have been misunderstood                            ,    ,                        c
Mr ADAMS had taken the report of a third person in pref
erence to hie own recollection, because he might have mis
conceived the remaiks of the gentleman, but it was possible
that the report foi the Intelligencer was n istaken He then
proceeded with the report of the gentleman's lemarks observ
ins that the gentleman of Virginia was arguing in favor of a
reconsideration of the vote by w h.ch the report of Governor
Poindexter was ordered to be printed on the ground that wlen
it came it ought to be accompanied by ti e reports of the other
commissioners That might be a very good reaso i for the
gentleman irom Virinnia, but it was not so for him (Mr
ADAMS) The instant hewas oprized tha himself his eol
leagues, and his constituents, whom he believed to be tiniest
and honorable men, were implicated by these papers that was
precisely the reason, of all otheis, he should have foi saying,
" Bring it forward at once, let us see what it is, let us meet
it face to face " If they were charged with crimes, let them have
afair and honorable trial, he therefore voted for it, for the very
reason  for which the gentleman from Virginia opposed it
He wished to see what the charges were which were to blast
his character, and the character i f his colleagues and constitu.
ents, and to merit a monument at the hands of the peopls of
South Carolina He would read the woids as they were re
ported in the Intelligencel, and if they were erroneous, the
gentleman could have an opportunity to correct them, and to
tho°e words he called the attention of the House, as he did
of the whole country
"How could the President have had it ten days, when the re
port was not made till the 20th^ 1 do notsay I know the fact, it
may have been in ttiehmds of the President on the 12th, but it
was recalled, and not returned till the 20th But admit he had
it for ten days he was to read it, compare it with the other re
ports, reflect on the whole, a^d then write his message to Con
gress The whole measure originated with him, and u, most
important report it is It not only involves the conduct and }
character of men in the New Yoik customhouse—of Hoyt, of
Curtis, ol Carnes, of Wasson, and others m that establishment—
but I can tell New England gentlemen on mis 11 n r that it m
volves some men of the t eiy highest standing in Boston and m
Lowell—the gently ol New England—the highest class of capí
tali&ts—these, too, aieinvoiveu, and if the statemei ts in the re
p trt are true, men of tins description have been engaged in a
conspiracy to bribe the custom house officers to seize on wool
len goods, for the benefit of the manufacturers oí New England.
"He believed this vpry repoi t would be found to be one of the
strongest anti tariff documents ever put forth tothe community,
ihe agueultuial mteiest of the countiy would be gratified by
its peiu al The report not only involved the character oí the
cus om house officers at New If ork, but a'so of the commis
sioners themselves, (who were undeistood some of them to be
anti tanff Whigs, and others pro tanff Whi«s,)and ultimately
eveiy member~here repiesenti g the State ol Massachusetts
This report, gentlemen might he assured, had deeperends in
view than a meie refoim of abuses or coireclion of the rev
enue laws Should it expose the iniquities of the protective
sys em, nd operate to save the countiy from then infliction, ¡
the whole South, and paiticularly the btateof Sou'h Carolina, 1
ought to erecta monument to the memorj ol itsaulhoi '
He (Mi  Ad vms) did not wish to comment upon the contiast
drawn between the manufactuimg and the aguuillural irter    '
est , oi th- lendency theie was t> anay oie apati st the othei
but what was the conclusion of thegentlem in frum the position

lectod,  as an anti tariff man  to gj to the I\ew \<ik custom

corruption on anybody'    Supj ose it was true that eveiy per

as n íespects a great question m diffeientsc ions of this I mon,
and hepiotested asanistit, even supposing the cl aiges ol bn
bery could be fixed upon them all
Mr WI-E again obt ined petmissinn t< explain He said
his intention had not been to charge an) thing agin st anybody,
but to notify iheRepiesentat ves of Lowell and Boston, that the
leport involved then constituents and injustice was likely to
be done to them if Poindexter s report was published before the
ot!ier two came m
Mr  CUSHING also desned permission to state why he had   |
voted as he did yesterday    He had no 1 nowlei'geof the con
tents of tiiejapor, except from rumoi and a laige quantity of
printed mattei issued by Mi   Jes e Hoyl  and by  them it was
said that persons were to be nnpjgned   part of whom were   I
cons'ituents oflns own    He was induced as long a«o as Sep
temberlast, tofixhis eyeonthatinvestieation,tosee What was   ,
tohappe , and he did but as ho was bound lo do    He com    I
mumcated with his constituents who were said to beimplicated,
and they said, as h" (Mr Gushing) sai 1 tnen, that he challenged
l ivcstista lor, and whenever tl e inn  si ould come to go into the
debate, he should stand thereto \indicate thee larac fi of those
gentlemen    Havng had an ltit mat on of what was to come,
he was desirous that it should come altóle hei, and pot ex

evideiceon which it was fouided  butespicially the lourna 
audthedocumentaiymatteron which it was to be nrde Hehad   ,
had the same object m view when he voted against the íesolu
Hon, some time since, calling on the Executive foi this report    I
though some of the newspapeis had accused lum of havi g
some Administration object in de-inng the conreaimen' ol the
repon    And, in regard lo list   he had only to say that the
Pre ident of th  Um ed States ha 1 ro pu,po-,eexc pt to dojus
tneto Jl the world, and to ta" e ca,e that ir|ustire wis not
done t) individuals, and if he hal d «ired inoie than three dajs

miehtknou how fai not only private irdividuals  bit public

knew of no purpose to supi i "es lie i port on th" part o' the
President, not ot any puipose but to see impartial justice dot e
to all parties
Mr GARRETT D WIS inq ured if the I'resil 11 has not de
sued the commissioneis to make i o rx-ininaeum ol Mr Cm
tissadmmlstntionl                                                       ,   .

w ling to interrupt his codeadle yet, as he had on'y ylek'ed

Mi ltRHl\Gcl! not wish to i espass on the indulgence ot

M, \DAMS resumed, and leiterated his desire 'o have the
papéis printed is sow a pis lblc that tVv miaht know the
nature of tha cherts niefeired asamst them Iiu theie was
another subject and that alone would hat e induced him to \ o e
against the reconsideiatio it wis the letter of the Pre ident
read yesterday b> the gentleman fiom >e<\ \nrk [Mí Lin\ J
Tha* le ter contained the most astonishing sediments he had
ever heard on that floor It was a letter fiom the President ot
the United States to the commission—                          „„„„ „f
Mr WIsE desired to correct the gentleman as to a matter o¡
fact.   It was not a letter from "the President of the United
States to the commission," it wasnevei laid before the com
mission, but it was written to Governor Poindexter alonej and*
he asked those who hadpioducedthe letter here, to bring for-
ward also the letter to which it wasa leply
Mr ADAMto would read an extiact from the letter, and to it
he called the attention of the House and of the nation.
"The commission on which, at my own request, you and,
others consented lo serve, was instituted, and the report of the
commissioners is now wanted by me for my own informa*
tion I do not doubt but that it will contain many suggestions
with regard to the custom houses, and the mode of transacting
business mostwoithy o be íecommcnded by metoCongress
And should it bring to my knowledge any facts implicating
those now m office, to an extent or upon giounds requiring the
Executive action m regard to them, 1 shall, without any
promptings by Congress uho have iightfully nothzng lo tío
ysdh tí, discharge my duty to the country without fear That
I have, for a considerable ume, most anxiously desned there-
port o be made, I wnl not deny Whether, when made, I shall
deem it best to umvmunic tie the entire report to Congress, or
othei wise make it public, or content myself with adopting its
recommendations, and urging them upon the dehbeiations of
Congiess, will be foi my own decision, as also will be the ume
and occasion for making it "
He (Mi Ad^is) was surprised at the sentiments here ex-
pressed, and he had opposed the reconsideration of the vote or-
dering the lepoit to be printed, because he was unwilling to-
put it m the powei of mis gentleman, who says Congress
"havenghtfully nothing todo with it " Congress nothing to
do with malfeasance in public office! What was that House
for? And why w is the power of impeachment given to thenTf
Why was that House engaged in that investigation for such a
length of time"! Why had they given power to committees to
investigate other subiectsof similar character? Whywasall
tins done, if the gentleman w 1 o was the tenant of the White
House was to deride it, and il Congress had really nothing to
do with it' In his opinion, Congress had a great deal to do with
it Congiess would have moie to do withit than if the report
had been sent back to the Treasury Department or to the Presi-
dent of the United Mates to be garbled
After a few remai ks on the observation that Ihis letter was a
pnvate one which, how ver, wa-s not written under the ln)unc
tion of secrecy he said il they admitted the doctrine that Con
giess had nothing to do with this mattei, they might as well
disperse and pi t the whole people of the commonwealth In
the ha ids of one n an He would say of the repoit itself that
if he had the 240 votes of the members of that House he would
have given 'hem all against the reconsideration But he had
tiespa&sed longer than he had intended, his oli|ect was solely
what he now requested—that this memorial coming, as it did,
Horn some tf those very peisons implicated m the report of the
commissioner, an 1 connected with the very interest which the
gentleman fiom Virginia sud was to be blown sky high, never
to show its face heie agau, micht be receivtd and punted, with
the names annexed to it, and refeired to die Cummillee of the

on Manufactures had been leferred
Mr UNDLRWOOD rose to adoress the House, but various
points of order were stai ted, some ge tleman avowing then de-
slíe to be to proceed with the pi lvate c-ilendar
The SPEAKER was understood to decide igainst the con-
tinuance olilie debate I he i ule piesn ibes that a buef explana
tion of a memorial only shall be i íade < n its presentation, and
if it becomes debatable, the,ubjuctmust ntcessanly go over
In this ese, the gentlem-m fiom Massachusetts had been al-
lowed to go into personal expl ination by universal consent, but
the debate could not be carried luither, without the consent of
the House                                                         ,
