low will either assault what he supposes to be the left, or attack with a regiment. Shortly, in the way of reconnaissance, I will try and carry out your views, but doubt whether anything can be done, though it is possible we may frighten the enemy into abandoning his line or re-enforcing it. The troops are very tired, having no rest since night before last, and with no opportunity of making cafe. What is not done this afternoon cannot be done to-night. I would have accomplished more except for the weariness of my command this morning, consequent on the fatiguing march.

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General.

I have one division on the road from New Market to Long Bridge, on the left of the enemy's line. I will get the intersection of the Central road to Richmond and this road if possible, and immediately. I am not very far from the right of your line.

Very respectfully,
