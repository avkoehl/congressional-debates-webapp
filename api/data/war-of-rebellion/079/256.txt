Wood's Station, or Nickajack, about eight miles from this place. I have no doubt this is the same party that destroyed the railroad near Tunnel Hill last night. They will probably attempt its destruction at the same place to-night.

W. H. HAYS,

Colonel, Commanding.

RINGGOLD, October 13, 1864.

Major MOE:

I have heretofore sent you all the information that I have in relation to the forces of the enemy near Dalton. If the reports are to be relied upon that I have from there, the rebels have infantry near that place. I am just starting a courier to Colonel Potect, at Tunnel Hill. If he is no re-enforced by daylight shall he fall back toward Chattanooga? Answer.

W. H. HAYS,

Colonel Tenth Kentucky, Commanding.

CHATTANOOGA, October 13, 1864.

Colonel POTEST,

Tunnel Hill:

Try and communicate with Dalton. If such re-enforcement as can be sent from here will be available to drive the enemy, will send them at once by Ringgold.

Respectfully,

S. B. MOE,

Major and Assistant Adjutant-General.

RINGGOLD, October 13, 1864.
