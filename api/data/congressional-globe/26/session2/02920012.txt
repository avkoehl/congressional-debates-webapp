were prevented from examining by the mevitab'e
dangers attending tlie attempt, or from want of
means and time. A very extensive series rf b<Te-
mwtrical observations were aKo made, and tne
zealous co operation of men of scence, occupying
stations m the several States, vho observed at the
same periods of time, has enabled Mr Nico'et to
compare his own with iho-e of oihers made in dn-
ferent quarters of the TJmop, ?nd thus accurately
to determine the relative level of the whole re ion
represerted by the map, as well as its elevation
above the ocean, thereby indicating the ¿Jimateand
face of the countiy The map will be accompanied
by a report calculated to give an accurate know-
ledge ot that dittant country, ->nd it is bel.evd that
the results of this survey will be u eful bo'h lo the
Government and to the people, and prove an ac-
ceptable accession to geography. It will 'erve, like-
wise, to exhibit the manner m which futu re survejs
of the country are to be made, if, as it is hoped,
they should be authorized by Congres* It appears
to be very desirable that those remote regions of
our country should be known; and the suivey 
ought, in my opinion, to be extended by degrees to
the sources of the Missouri, and across th? Rocky
mountains to ihe Pacific ocean Nor ought that
portion of our country which is nearer and moie
accessible to be neglected. The existing maps do
not rest on accurate data. TLe true courses of
our great rivers, and tha forms of the magnificent
chain of lakes which stretch along oar northern
border, are yet to be tru'y defined The m'erests
of the nsmg commerce of the Wes'require that hy-
drograpbic survey s of these inland seas and great
avenues of trade should be made wnhout delay. A
small annual appropriation will enable the Go
vernment lo (fleet thi? important objec , through
the agency of the topographical cotos, which is
composed of officers íoUy c?pab e oí perOrm.rig
this duty Nosu'-.ey f any efpscnpt'on 'hould oe
made, in future, vjliou' bo rg accompanied With
agronomical and narome iicjI obsei nations In
this manner a series of pesmuns may be deter-
mined, and the means gradually furnished of ac-
quiring a n ore perfect knowledge of the geogra-
phy of the country; and thus of constructing an ac-
curate map of thi  Un ted Sta es—objects of vast
importance ¡o ttte interests of ¡heir naviga'ion and
commerce.
The Military Academy has been conducted m a
manner highly credirab e t  the superintendent, and
satisfactory to this D pirtment. Every effort has
been mide to enf< rce discipline, and to "i-«il into
the minds o' the cad.ts a love ot order a"d a high
sense of their moial ard religious duties, and it is
believed that the standard of discipline, mora uy,
and religion, at this institution, is equal to that of
any other college or academv 11 the United States;
while the mathematical and military studies, a  far
as the theory is concerned, are?s complete as thos*
taught in any  choi 1 in America or Eurrpe
Nothing is required to give our young orneen
the same advantages as are afforded to those of
other countiies, bin schools of practice, w'uc'i are
about to be established, and to whieh ih« gradu-
ates are to be sent for ore jear after they are
commissioned, and their des ination ascertained, in
order to perfect them in the practical du ics of that
branch of the 'ervice to which the) may be a't c'i
ed The new library building is > s*rl> c jnplete 1,
and the mural towers attached to it, forthe purpose
of making astronomical observations, and teaching
practcally that important branch ot vi-nce, aie
well adapted for that object. Th<> prof ssor of
astronomy wa° sent to Europ , m ¡rder to procure
some instruments which are needed, and to ex-
amine the several groat observatories ihtre, a cer-
tain the manner ¡n which they are fitted up, and
witness their method  of obse-vmg He has re-
turned with information which cannot fail to be
highly interesting and useful
Whenever the condition of the Treasury will
permit, it is very desirable to erect new barracks
at West Point, Those at prespnt there are dilapi-
dated buildings, originally badly constructed, and
now in a state of decay, which renders them as un-
healthy as they are inconvenien'. The eo-icurrent
testimony of each succeeding board of visners for
several years past shows the necessity of lenewmg
these building?. With a view to spread gen ra ly
througKcut th* country a knovcledseof tni in mu-
tton, it has been decided to appoint eighteen \ i i e-s
from al ernate Sta es every year, for meg the re-
ma'njer of the board from officers ol the army and
navy of the Um'ed States
I must asain repeat my recommendat on that
two of the present paymasters be appointed assist-
ant paymas ersgeneial, with the rank of h=u enant
colonel. Thit very important branch of the ser-
vice is incomplete uncter its present orgamratnn,
officers of higher rank are if quire 1 to super-
intend the operations of those of the corps who
may be on duty in the field. It apprars bu' an act
of justice to the latter, to allow them a moderate
p r centage op the pa>msnts they may make to
volunteers and milma, to co\er the uppvo dable
lo«ses towlmh they are exposed from being at
times compelled to make these payments in a hur-
ried and informal manner.
No loss or inconvenience has resulted from em-
ploying, during the la<t season, Indian scents to
pay the annuities snd make the re^u ar disburse-
ments to the tribes over wh se inter srs they have
been appoiotel to watcn. These duties have been
well and faithfully performed, out, as h sjc em lor
the fi-al dupo*al of tbe-e important and responsible
dunes, the plan reported to on this occasmn ls 1()
complete, and I again recommend a -¡mall increase
of ihe number (f paymaster^, and that t'iis d iy be
permanent'y a«s gned to that branch of the m.litary
service
Iq rendering justice to the character of the offi
cers of the pay department and *o the eíTieiercy
will which their duties are dischirg'd, 1 cannot
forbear to bring to jonrnntue the defects of ih 
present system of p-tying the army, and th-  evil
consequencs which íesuL r'<"nit Fro « the ic-
•noteness of ihe rose-, the sou iPis aie > a I at li rw

tion of which the thoughtlesssoldier genera'ly avails
himself to the full extent, and on pay day has the
mortification to see nearly his w ole paj c rned r if

while, on the con rary, tho'e so'diers who happen
not to be n debt to the sutbr receive hr. e
amounts, which they too frequently waste in di>si-
p.Jion; and, until the«e sums are expended, the
post piesents a scene of alternate drunkenness an1
punishment The only remedy for these evils will
be found in the prohibition it ciedils by the sut-
lers, and more frequeiil payt n nts 11 the troops
The offieeis of the medical staff have maintain-
ed the high reputation acquired by then zpalous at-
tention to their dunes in ga-n on and n the field
The very strict examination lo wh ch candidates
for this branch of the service are subjected before
admission, insures biph professional attainments
in those of the lowest ran!, and that which the of-
ficers themselves undergo before promotion, lesds
them to s vere application, for it must apjear that
they havp not only retained the knowledge ac-
quued at eel ege, but also krp' pace with the pio-
 re«s ol mee'idl science, or ihey earnot be pro

Having, m several instances, found df fie ent the
title  to land en which forts and other public works
are erected, measures were adop'ed to perfect
taem, and I am happy to report that I found, os
all occasions the State authorities willing to con-
vey to the United S ates the land wheieon such
works are situa ed The Department has not yet
succeeded in settln g the question of the right of
property in the Peapatch is'and, net withstanding
its utmost efforts to do so. This is to be regratted,
as us possession is essentia' ¡y necessary to the de
fence of the Delaware. The works to be erected
■here, cannot, from thi nature of ike soil, be
thrown vp in haste, but will requite much time to
complete mem, leaving, in the ev-nt of war, ths
approaches to Philadelphia a'mos-t entire y ex-
posed.                            *
A new edition of the Army Regulations has been
diawn up, and is ab >u' to be published, with such
amendments and additions as the exper ence of the
last four lears has dictated
It is a subject of gi°at ¡egret to me .o be com-
pelled to state that every effort to terminate the
contest in Florida has so far, pn ved unsuccessful
Or. (Señera! Taylor's retiring irom the command of
the arc y there, (which he did, by p rmis5ion, ¡n
May la^r,) ¡t devolved upon Bi.gadier General
Armmead; who, rottnihstandiHg the advanced
s ason, c immenced active operations against the
Indian<=,and, in many instances, succeeded in break-
in  up their encampments, destroying their fields
and crons and mak ng se-me few prisoners. In
order to render the legalar forces available for cf
tensive operations, a bnrade of Florida militia was
raised for the defence of Middle Florida, at;d placed
under the comm-ind of Bugadiei General Leigh
Read, oí the Territorial militia, with instruct ons
to defend the portion of the Territory situated north
o' a line of post-, occupied by the regular troops,
-xtending from ihe At'antie, «Outn of St Augus-
t ne, including taos*a'ioi,s eas« of the St. Johns
-iver Pib'ka, Wh-elock, M canopy. Watkahoo-
¡pp Warasa ca a post betwe n the la=! and Fort
Fann i-g at d Cedar Keys
Tie troops that were n 'Vp service of the Ter-
ritory, in v rfue of a law of the Legt>tature ef Flo-
rida, were mu-tered into mat of the United S ates,
and form part < f General Read's b'igade, wh ch
ha  te n increased to twelve hundred mocnted and
five handri d footmen, and may be raispd to fifieen
hon Ired mounted and five hundred foot, a forte
whicn is considered ample for the proieetion of
that portion of the Territory assigned to General
Read's comtn?rd Some depredations having
been committed in the negborhood cf the Okefe-
nokee swamp, four companies of Georgia militia
have been musteied into the service of the United
States, are charged with the defence of the Geor-
gia frontier.
Certain of the hostile chiefs having signified to
General Armistcad their desire to treat, they were
invited to meet htm at Fort King on the 7th nil
and, from the circumstance (deemed fortunate) of
the presence there of a deleg^tlon from Ihe West-
ern S-"oinoles, 1 opes were entertained of termi-
nating this pro racted struggle by tne peaceful re-
moval of the remaining Indians After some days
spent in negotiating, and af er giving reiterated as-
surances of their desire to emigrate and rejoin
their bret' ren we t of the Mississippi the Indians
suddenly di.appeared, without any assignable
cause for this abrupt lupture of the negotiations.
Hostilities have, in consequence, bepn renewed,
and will be preseculed vigore usly
The r  ular troops now m Florida amount to
about 4 500 men, and the militia in service to
about 2 000 I recommend that authority be given
¡he Eíecutiieto engas?p the services (■>■ this de-
scription of trcop«- for a twelvomon'h or during
the continuance of hrsf hues in Florida. The
term of three months is much t<o short to ensu/e
efficiency; and frequent en isfments are a fruitful
source of insubordination, as well as of great ad-
ditional expense
The number of Indians em igrateel from the in-
ferior to ti e Wesf, Sine the year 1836, amounts to
very nearly 41,(00, of which about 5,000 were re-
moved during the past season; and I am happy to
add, that the condition ot those who are settled in
their new homes continues to be represented to us
as prosper us and bappy. The differences which
unfortunately sprung np between the Western
Cherokees and the late emigrants of that tribe, up-
