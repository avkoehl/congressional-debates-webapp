Brigadier-General FORSYTH,

Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: I am now on the road to Goode's Bridge, at Beaver Pond Creek. I have met a small picket here and will push a force to Bevill's Bridge. The road to Bevill's Bridge forks from this at Tabernacle Church, a short distance back. The enemy passed here with wagon trains toward Bevill's and Goode's Bridges. Have been passing trains here since Sunday. Generals Rosser and Fitz Lee camped here last night. They all said they were going to Lynchburg. Everything indicates they are moving that way, though I cannot tell certainly. I will be able to give more definite information before night. Cavalry is in our front: I will push them through, and give you all information possible very soon. We are now six miles from Goode's Bridge and ten from Amelia Court-House.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. MERRITT,

Brevet Major-General.

APRIL 4, 1865-4 p.m.

Brigadier-General FORSYTH,

Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: I have met the enemy in considerable force near Beaver Pond Creek. They seem to be inclined to hold the forks of the roads to Amelia Court-House and Goode's Bridge. (I have just received a report from Captain Whiteford, with Mackenzie's division. I inclose it.) From all this there is no doubt about their holding Goode's and Bevill's Bridgees, with a view of crossing the Appomattox. The force I sent on Bevill's Bridge road reports meeting the enemy. In how great a force I do not know. I will hold the forks at Tabernacle Church and find out what I can. Prisoners just taken report Heth, Johnson, and Pickett in our front with all the enemy's cavalry. They use their artillery freely. We have taken prisoners from Heth's and Johnson's divisions. The enemy does seem inclined to hold the roads, but not to advance. Prisoners just taken report that some said they were going to Amelia Court-House, and others across the Appomattox. Negroes report all trains gone to the bridges on Appomattox.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. MERRITT,

Brevet Major-General.

APRIL 4, 1865.

Brigadier-General FORSYTH,

Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: I send you a black boy with very important information. Let the general see him and question him. He says they mean fight at Amelia Court-House. He is willing to tell, and knows a great deal. The works in our front are heavily manned with infantry. I will stop here to-night. Will you please let the boy come back to me. I want him for a servant.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. MERRITT,

Brevet Major-General.
