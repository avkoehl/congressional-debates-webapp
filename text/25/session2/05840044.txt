By our Constimtion, both the^e powers aie reined
to Congress, neither being giren to ihe President
Congresj only can declare wai, arm and equip fleets,
raise armies, <Sc , and Congies  only can "lay and
collect .axes, duties, imposts, and excises, to pa\
the debts, provide tor the common defence and
general welfare oí ihe nation." The President
can neither laise m array nor pay an aimy lie
can neither declare wai, nor laise money to pay an
army to pi oséente one It is Hue that the dutj ol
seems* the laws faithfully excelled di volw son Hie
President. He must see that dutrs, imposts, &.(.
are collected as dnected by the law-, of Congress
And after they ate collected he must sre that they
are disbursed and paid out, m pursuance ot appro
pnations made by Congiess These are mere F.x-
ecutive duties,to bepeif nmeil in pursuance ol and
in obedience to the I eg shine will It is, then,
very cleai that the President cannot "have the coi-
trol ot either the sw ord oi the purse s > long as the
chatacter and sti ucture of the Govsrnment remain
unchanged
But it is slid that the recommendations of the
President propose "to cut the Go\ eminent loose
from (he people To piovide An the Goveiiinn tit,
and let the people slult fot themselves To piovide
one currency for the Government, and anolhei tot
thepeope." These are Ihe mind ass tniplums
that are to go down with the pe >ple ioi aiguinent
Istheie, su, matter of substance in these asscnmis,
orare they thrown out as mete bugbe us to fiiglilciuhe
people? Were it not loi the high souu< siiom whence
I often hear ihem emanate, I would not hesitate to
believe the latter How can the Government be
provided for, and not the people' or, how can n
be fevered from the people, when the Government,
with its money and every thing appuitenant to it
belongs to th  people, is crea'ed by them, sustained
by them, nnd admmistend foi then benefit? All
are in the ham's of the people and subject to their
control Are the peoplp's agents nine interested
than the people themselves, m having the Gin em-
inent vv ell provided tor? Are not these agents pal t of

After reading these tsobelnswe argameonts of
President Van Buren and Governor Olarfc, in de-
fence of the same position, I will proceed-to another
branch of the same inquiry; and that is, -té answer
the charge that the President has recommended an
unjust discrimination as to the character of the
itinds to be made receivable for the public dues;
the effect of which, it is insisted, would be to pro-
vide one currency for the Government and another
for the people.   Let us see, for a moment, how
this matter stands.   In his last Message, the Presi-
dsnt makes no allusion to the character of the
currency to be íeceived, consequently,  he cannot
be charged with unjust discrimination m that docu-
ment     In his Message to thespecial session of Con-
giess, he recommends the reception of "specie or its
equivalent," gold and silver, or "bank notes actually
eonveitible into specie;" the laltei to be received
under such circumstances  as will "allow of their
i arly presentation for payment *'   Here seems to
he  no unjust discrimination, nor any beyond the
foimer piaetice of the Government.   The former
laws ol Congress on this subject declare, " that if
bank notes are paid 111 the transactions of the
Government, it must be under such circumstances
as to enable th« holder to con\rert them into specie
without depreciation or delay    Surely gentlemen
would not have ihe  President to leeomnaend the
iccepiion of depreciated bank paper not "redeema-
ble, upon demand, m specie "   This he opposes in
his Message, and assigns, in my judgment, the best
of reasons that such a course "would, without the
excuse   of   wai  01   public distress, destroy that
equality  of imports and identity of commercial
legulation, which lie at the foundation of our Con-
federacy, and would offer to each State a direct
t' mptation to increase its foreign trade, by depre-
ciating   the currency   received   for duties in its
pork,  that "such a  jiroceedmg would also, in a
gieit dpgree,  frustrate  the  policy so highly che-
nshed,  of infusing  into 0111 circulation a larger
propouion ol the pieciotismetals " Such seem to be
the sentiments of the Piesident, against which it
would, to my mind, be very difficult to raise any
leasonable or valid objections     In many of the
cities md towns of the nation, the chief currency
for "common hand to hand transactions," consists
if individual and coiporate tickets, redeemable,
not in money,  but in   irredeemable, depreciated
bank paper    The people take them from choice,
10 answer the purposes of change, but is ¡hat any
leason why the Government should take such pa-
pea'    Could she tender such paper to her creditors
without subjecting herself to the merited charge of
fraud' and would her creditors receive such paper
when they have the common right of every citizen
to demand gold oi silvei, if Ihey choose to do so1
A s an individual, I may receive for my debts what-
ever I please,  irredeemable depreciated paper if
I choose     In perfoimmg th" trust of an agent m
collecting morey for anothei, I would not dare
to leceive such paper,  unless I mtende I to make
it "ood out ot my own pocket     How, then, is an
agent of the Government to be expected to receive
such paper'   There can be but (tie answer given
to such a question     But suppose the Government
vveie to íeceive such paper for the public dues
Would  not such  a course stand condemned by
every principle 01 sound policy, and be execrated
hv eveiy cui^pt   Who camot see ihe encourage-
ment thai  'ould theieby be given to the emission
and cin illation of such paper?    It would t>oon be-
come the onh ei cwlatirg medium of the country.
Do w e not  all   look to the Government to discou-
rage ra her than encourage the cin ulation of such
a m dnim     Sir, the Government is the safest and
p'lnnps  ine o H sui" check we possess against a
ppipetual flood of inconvertible depreciated paper ,
which check can only be  brought to ope 1 ate unon
