HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF VIRGINIA,Warrenton Junction, August 26, 1862-2.10 p. m.

General MEIGS, Quartermaster-General:

Our animals are dying in their harness form want of forage. My calls upon Captain Ferguson are not complied with. The reason, I learn, is that there is none at Alexandria. No forage can be had in the country, not even hay in sufficient quantity. The railroad agents report that all the transportation called for has been furnished, yet Captain Ferguson states that he could no send forage for want of cars. Irregularity exists somewhere, and in the mean time our animals must be rendered totally unserviceable unless a supply of forage is speedily furnished.

Brigade Quartermaster.

General COX, Kirkwood House:

Have an unexpected demand for cars for the transportation of forage and subsistence, and our trains do not arrive as promptly as expected; for this reason we must defer moving your command until to-morrow. The cars will be ready, and if the troops be loaded at 5 a. m. we can forward them at 6 a. m.
