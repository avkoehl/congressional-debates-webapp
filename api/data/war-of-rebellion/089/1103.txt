Chambliss', Young's, and Barringer's brigades of cavalry are at or near Belfield; the railroad is being repaired this side of that point, and cavalry details are at work on it. Dearing's brigade is camped near Burgess' Mill and picket on immediate right (enemy's right) of infantry. No information going to show that anything but Hoke's division has left this army for Wilmington.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
