CHARLESTON, S. C., February 3, 1863.

General S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General, Richmond, Va.:

Two more rifled guns (32-pounders or 24-pounders) are much needed at Genesis Point. Am informed there are some at arsenal here for other points out of this department. Can they be obtained? Cannot services of General Wayne be had to assist General Mercer?

CHARLESTON, S. C., February 3, 1863.

General S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General, Richmond, Va.:

British was steamer Cadmus arrived yesterday off this port. Consul Bunch is ordered to embark with his family as soon as possible. United States New Ironsides is among blockaders. It is believed on good authority this place is to be attacked soon, instead of Savannah, as already reported probable to War Department. My troops sent to Wilmington, with more besides, are indispensable for safety of Charleston or Savannah. Some more heavy guns would add greatly to their defense. No time should be lost. Now or never. Time of eight reserve State regiments expire in few days. Can they not be kept in service thirty days longer? Have already reported difficulty to finish torpedo ram for want of materials. Government is building three gunboats and State one, which cannot be finished for same reason. Why not concentrate, as already suggested once, all labor and materials on one at time?

G. T. BEAUREGARD,

General, Commanding.

CHARLESTOWN, S. C., February 3, 1863.

M. L. BONHAM,

Governor of State of South Carolina, Columbia, S. C.:

British war steamer Cadmus arrived yesterday off this port. Consul Bunch is ordered to embark with his family as soon as possible. United States New Ironsides is among blockaders; two or more monitors are believed south of here. It is reported Charleston or Savannah is to be attacked soon. Time of reserves soon out. Can they not be kept thirty days longer? My applications for negro labor still unanswered. A little more earth thrown up may save much property and many valuable lives.

W. S. WALKER,

Brigadier-General, Savannah, Ga.:
