AUGUST 26, 1864-1.15 p. m.

Major-General BIRNEY:

I shall relieve part of Carr's division now in trenches with colored troops on this side, march them across the Appomattox to-night. Was to relieve part of Foster's division-about one-half. I shall move my headquarters this p. m. and take the ground now occupied by yours. You can be ready to start for this side at 5 p. m. Your chief of artillery and the Eighteenth Corps chief of artillery will remain where they now are to place batteries in position as they arrive, and then join their headquarters.

E. O. C. ORD,

Major-General.

General ORD,

Eighteenth Corps:

The rest of Terry's division is en route from Deep Bottom. Paine reached there at 11 o'clock. Nothing unusual here. I think you should put Ames and Carr between James and Appomattox. The line is long.

General BIRNEY,

Tenth Army Corps:

General Grant, and I also, think the last intercepted dispatch, about Hoke's mine failing, a hoax. You can, however, make arrangements and be prepared for any emergency north of the Appomattox. I shall start in a few minutes and would like to meet you at General Butler's headquarters.

E. O. C. ORD,
