DECATUR, ALA., October 27, 1864.

Major-General THOMAS:

Officers returning from a scout up the river report small bodies near the river. The commanding officer at Triana reports loud cheering among the enemy on the south side last night and yesterday. We are still skirmishing all around the lines. No serious effort has yet been made to take the place.

R. S. GRANGER,

Brigadier-General.

DECATUR, October 27, 1864.

General GEORGE H. THOMAS:

Colonel Morgan, with small colored regiment, 250 strong, has just arrived from General Steedman. nothing has yet been heard from the other regiment, nor have any troops from the direction of Nashville passed Stevenson. I am anxious to get all the re-enforcements I can by morning, as the enemy will doubtless attempt to destroy my pontoons from the works he is now throwing up.

R. S. GRANGER,

Brigadier-General.

Brigadier General R. S. GRANGER,

Decatur, Ala:

Your dispatches of 4 p. m., 5. 30 p. m., and another not timed, are just received. I wish you to be particularly cautious in detecting and preventing any attempt of the enemy to assault you at an Early hour in the morning. I do not think there is so much probability of such an attempt during the day. The regiments sent you from near this place should reach you to-night.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General, U. S . Volunteers, Commanding.
