 [CHAP. XLIII.
artillery horses be included, render a movement upon Rome and Atlanta impracticable for the present. Such a movement cannot safely be undertaken until six months' supply for both troops and animals is accumulated here, so that we shall no longer be under the necessity of employing a great part of our forces to guard railroads in our rear, but can concentrate everything here for the supreme effort. What is now necessary is to hold Chattanooga and the line of the Hiwassee, to complete and protect the railroads and the steam-boats upon the Tennessee, and to amass food, forage, and ordnance stores in the fortress here. But all this will require only a portion of the forces under Grant's command, and, instead of holding the remainder in winter quarters, he proposes to employ them in an offensive campaign against Mobile and the interior of Alabama. For this purpose he thinks not more than 35,000 men will be necessary, which number he will draw from the armies of Sherman and Thomas. Embarking at Nashville, as if to return to West Tennessee and Vicksburg, he can land them all at New Orleans, and possibly at Pascagoula Bay, before the enemy get wind of his design. Investing Mobile, he will leave a sufficient force to hold his lines and keep the garrison imprisoned without any unnecessary fighting, while with the mass of his army he operates in the interior against Montgomery, Selma, or whatsoever point invites attention. He has asked me to lay this plan before you, and to ask for it the approbation of the Government. He will himself write to General Halleck on the subject, and perhaps also to yourself. I earnestly hope that you will agree to his design, and as soon as may be give your assent to its execution. A winter campaign may be made there with little if any difficulty. I can see nothing to condemn, but everything to approve, in the scheme.

CHATTANOOGA, November 29, 1863-2 p.m.

Grant has ordered Sherman to assume command of all the forces operating from the south for the relief of Burnside. These forces consist of Byrd's mounted brigade of Tennessee troops, belonging to the Army of the Ohio, and now at Kingston, altogether cut off from Burnside; of Elliott's division of cavalry, which should reach Kingston to-day or to-morrow; of Granger's corps, Howard's corps, and Morgan L. Smith's and Ewing's divisions of the Army of the Tennessee. Hooker, with Geary's division and the division of Osterhaus, remains at Ringgold till December 1, when he returns here. John E. Smith's division, Fifteenth Corps, returned here last night out of rations, and will remain. Sherman's new command will be supplied from the country, which it will soon exhaust, and by steam-boat. Weather very cold and clear, drying roads rapidly. I leave immediately to join Sherman and observe his campaign. He is ordered to march as far as Knoxville.
