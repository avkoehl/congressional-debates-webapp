So the committee non concurred in the amendment of the
Senate
Thexjqesnon recurred on concur! in* in the amendment of the
Senate, striking out: the provito to the said item, No 179
And (he amendment was mn concurred in
The next amendment of the senate wag read msertirganew
section between sect orts N e 179 and 180 a  follows
'For payment of sums now due for completing the custom
house at New York $28 200 "
Mr PTLLMORL said he did not wish to debae theamerd
ment, but wouid merely say that the Committee of Ways aid
Means recommende i a concurrence m ¡he amendment
Mr PROTOT opt osed it and he went through a mass of
items and details showing the expen J i tures for furniture, book
safes iron railing* and pa i no ganl biorzmg iron lading  in
the New Yoik custom h u=e ihe painting ans! brorzing
amounted to about 8^000, whnhshoved ihat, mNewlork,
they ' laid it t n pretty ihiL,k The f irni ure had heen purchas
ed contrary to the expre sed wilt of Coi giee*, and many other
expenditures were wholly nnauthor zed He relieved Mr
Woodbury to whom blame had been attached, fiom allrespon
Bibihty as he had positively refused to sanction t(ie expendí
tures And he deemed these (acts sufficient to justify an investí
gation into the aflair" of this custom house He alluded to ru
mors of a bonus having been given for a contract for non work,
and the extravagant rate at which the work bad been in conse
quence contracted fv>r He said iron desks and iron railing had
been chaiged 18£ cents per pou d, while the same work, <w he
had affidavits to show could be done at from 6 to 8* cents He
■went through other items of extiavagance, and concluded by
observing hat all the a mount a^ked for at the extra session for
completing the New Yoik custom house was $10 000,—it ^as
now swollen to $28 200, and unless something was done to check
It, by the next session it would be $38 000, if not $48,000
Mr Fill MORE referred to the consideration of this sub
ject, first by the Committee of Ways and Means and then
by the Committee on Public Buildings and said without re
plying to the many objections that had ¡ een ra sed by the
gentleman from Indiana [Mr Peoffit ] he would content him
self by stating the facts in the casf The gentleman had made
a very important mistake in refeience to the facts <md the
object of the appropuation The furniture for the ci «to n
house had been purchased by order ot some of the public nffj
cers, whether it ha 1 been paid for he knew not But the ap
propriation now asked foi v is not to r ay for the furniture thus
purchased, but for the custom nouse i self distinct fura the
furniture The estimate made «t the extrises ion for futnish
mg the custom house wa? gtOOOO and the es ¡mate made at
this «ession was abo t $2t, 000 He sent to the Clerk s table
where it was read a statement of the original estimate of
$10000 and in parallel cohmis of the e&timate $28010 with
explanations from the atchiuxt of the reasons for the diffei
enco of the estimates
In reference 11 the ch?rgea of ex ravagance m the purchase
of furniture &c for the custom bou e made by Mr Proffit,
Mr F referred to several too-iments on the subject among
-whichwasa Jettei from Mr Frazce the aichitect stating that
all the iron for the iron railing (whi<-h is mc'uded in this ap
propriation) was furnished by contrac, and at his order alone,
so that Mr Curtishad nothing to do with it Mi F also read
from a fetter from Mr Woodbury feeGretary of the Tieasury,
to Walter Bowne one ofthec>mmis«ioners of the custom house
at New York autiurzirg Mr Fra¿ e to be continued super
intendent and architect ot he building until the furrMing -md
furniture were completed and ¡statin^ that it was desirable
that Mr Frazee spUn should be carnedout as far asiespected

Mr McKAYOIr F yielding the floor at his request) bent
to the Clerk s tabU, a document relative to the custom hous*1
at New York, con a mng a c irre&pondence of Mr Cum  and
Mr Ewing, \\h ch was read and in which Mr Ewing author
ized Mr C to furm h the custom house pianlyand substan
tially, directn g as much of the old fui itureto be a ed as con
eistent an 1 nropei economy to be exercised in the mat er &r
Mr FILLMORE sa d f om this it appealed that Mi Éwug,
as well as his predecessor had authorized the furnishing oi the
custom houee the only difference bem-uhat Mr Woodbury had
left the matter wholly to the discretion of Mr Frazee while Mr
Ewing had directed it tobe f irnished pi ily and subsLanttally,
and the u d furniture to be us d
He asked that the House should not confound the apptopn*
ation tfow asked for completing the custom house with the ap
propriation that might hereafter be asked for furniture The
only question for the consideiat on of the committee on this
item was whether the Ron «a lab rerswhohad tendered &ei
vices to the public, on the order from one oí the departments
should be paid for those services
Mr F yielded he floor in the com«e of his remarks for e\
planations to Messrs ROO&EMXT, G DAVIS PROPFir,

These views are coiroboiated by the Governor of theTerri

Mature r* flection has satisfied me that these recommendations

carried on there and, at the same time, gratify mv anxiety to
reduce the demands upon the ireaaury, b) curtailing the extra
oidmaiy expenses which have attended the contest I have,
therefore, authorized the colonel in command there, as soon
as he -=ihall deem it expedient, to declare that hostilities against
the Indiars have ceased, and that they will not be lenewed un
