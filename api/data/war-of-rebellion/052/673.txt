Lieutenant Colonel GEORGE E. FLYNT,Asst. Adjt. General and Chief of Staff, 14th Army Corps:

COLONEL: I have the honor to report that my division remained at this point during the day. Nothing of interest has transpired.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Brigadier-General, Commanding Division.
HDQRS. FOURTH DIVISION, FOURTEENTH ARMY CORPS, Pond Spring, September 16, 1863-9.15 a. m.

Lieutenant-Colonel FLYNT:

COLONEL: Herewith I forward two reports just received from General Turchin. I have ordered him to make dispositions to hold the road leading from Worthen's Gap to the Catlett's Gap road, but not to advance into the gap until we can hear from corps headquarters. If a force from Brannan or Baird is thrown forward to hold the road from Dug to Catlett's Gap (which, according to my information, turns off to the right from the main Chattanooga road about half way between these gaps), we can take possession any time of Catlett's Gap. Worthen's Gap should at some time be stopped or taken possession of.

J. J. REYNOLDS,Major-General.

Major LEVERING:

The general commanding directs me to report that we have occupied the church three-quarters of a mile beyond the Chattanooga road, on Catlett's Gap road. The church is about one-half mile from the mouth of the gap and about 2 miles from our camp. Slight resistance.

Colonel Lane has gone south on Chattanooga road, with instructions to advance three-quarters of a mile and then turn to the left through Lane's plantation toward the foot of the mountain. If the general commanding decides to hold this point, our camp must be moved forward, and General Turchin desires Captain Floyd to come and arrange a division picket line.

There are three companies to the left and parallel to the Catlett's Gap road, and about one-third of a mile north of us, connecting with main advance.

Respectfully,

CURTIS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
