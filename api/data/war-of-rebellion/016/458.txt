In this engagement the officers and men of this regiment were continually under fire, all doing their duty nobly. Major John Ramsey and Captain Virgil M. Healey particularly distinguished themselves, leading in stragglers from different regiments and encouraging by their words and example all in their immediate vicinity. Captain Acton and Lieutenant Brill were killed; Captains Gamble and Woolsey wounded; Lieutenant Berry missing. Their condition is the best testimonial of their gallantry.
