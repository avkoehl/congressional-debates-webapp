"Joseph Gradney, (colored:)
*' Question. What was the feeling among the col-
ored people after that as to their own safety ?
"Answer. There were no hopes for any safety at
all. There were threats made that those who did not
join the Democratic party, and did not act with it,
would have to mind theconsequences after the elec-
tion. Those who were registered, and who were sus-
pected by the Democrats, had to give their registra-
tion papers to men who were sure not to go back on
them. My own ticket was taken from me and given
to a Democratic negro of the name of Jim Harvey.
I was ordered by George Robinson to give it to him
because he was a truer man to the party than I was,
as there was no confidence to be placcdin me.
"Question. What ticket did you vote?

sake, but it was not my desire to do so. iThis negro
who got my registration paper voted the Democratic
ticket, lie has always been considered a Democrat
since I knew him.

"Answer. A gentleman gave me a ticket, and when
I got to the ballot-box I put it right into the box
before them.

they did not have any guns. I cannot exactly say
how many had pistols. I can say that all I noticed
had small-arms. They always carried them.
"Question. Were you threatened on the day of
election ?
*1A nswer, I was not threatened, except the gen oral
threat that if wo did not vote the Democratic ticket
we had to stand the consequences; that anybody
who did not vote the Democratic ticket must bear in
mind if he did any mean action afterward that there
would be no chance for him at all.
"Question. Iiow did your brother vote ?

All the colored men who voted voted theDemocratic
ticket. There was not a Republican ticket voted
there.

colored Democrats were there in the parish ?

had published in my paper giving a description of a
meeting held in the town ot Washington a week or

44 In the liot of St. Landry, while the carpet-
baggers were fleeing for their lives at the close ot the
'unpleasantness," the negroes by hundreds wero
flocking to O.pelousas begging the protection of tho
white people against the white scouts that wero
sweeping over the parish shooting down the negroes
in all directions. Large quantities ot red flannel
were torn in strips arid tied in tho button-holes of
the negroes'clothes to show that protection had been
granted them. Such is the protection they get from
carpet-baggers when they are in trouble."
A few days before the election a manâ€”a brave
German Republican, a captain in our Armyâ€”
went to Opelousas to deliver Republican tick-
ets. He was seized, the ticketswere taken away
from him, and he was escorted by officers to the
edge of the town and sent out of the parish. He
was followed by armed men for two days and
nights, through field and swamp, and barely
escaped with his life.

immediately; took the Republican tickets i had
from me by force and destroyed them, and told me
I need not think I could reorganize the Republican
party in that parish again, for they were not going
to allow it to be done. Theparishsheriff, Mr. Hays,
who also keeps the hotel there, told me I was too
obnoxious to he allowed to stay in the parish or in
his house, and that I could not stop there, but must
leave at once. One of the town councilmen and a
deputy sheriff told me I must leave the corporation
immediately, as the mob could not be kept down by
them if I should be allowed to remain; the deputy
sheriff then took and accompanied me outside the
town corporation, and then left me to escape through
the woods as best 1 could from about fifty horsemen,
who had followed me from town; these horsemen
hunted mc all that mght, thenextday, and the night
after, when I managed to escape from the woods and
them, they having had me suirounded in the woods
all that time; some of these men who had followed
me were disguised with masks."
