HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,July 31, 1864-8.40 a.m.

Major-General BURNSIDE,

Commanding Ninth Corps:

The major-general commanding directs me to call your attention to the fact that you have made no report to him upon the condition of affairs in your front since he left your headquarters yesterday, and that you have made no reply to the two special communications upon the subject sent you last night at 7.40 and at 10.40. I am also directed to inquire as to the cause of these omissions.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS,July 31, 1864-9 a.m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

Your dispatch was received just as I was making out a report of our casualties. I have used every means to get something like accurate reports, but it has been difficult. The rumors are very numerous and exaggerated. I will send report by messenger. The order to retreat caused great confusion, and we have lost largely in prisoners. General Ord's men on our line were not relieved.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS,July 31, 1864-9 a.m.

General WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

I have the honor to report that all was quiet on my line. There was comparatively [little] firing. The remainder of General Ord's troops will be relieved during the day, if possible; certainly to-night. Nearly 100 wounded are lying between the lines in our front, which possibly could be brought in by a flag of truce.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS,July 31, 1864. (Received 9.30 a.m.)

Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

The report of casualties spoken of in my last dispatch will be delayed an hour.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.
