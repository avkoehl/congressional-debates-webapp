of Major Morfit, quartermaster, of issue of fuel and amount due from January 1 to February 15, 1865, and charges the want of a full supply during the inclement weather to want of energy on the part of Captain Goodman, post quartermaster; that the fact cited by Major Gee that the prison sutler buys all of his fuel from the prisoners proves nothing, no more than their willingness to part with their newly received supply of clothing, a practice to check with General Johnson has issued an order forbidding citizens or soldiers to purchase, proves that they are not in want of clothes. He reports that the most serious objection to the prison is the character of the soil, a stiff, tenacious red clay, difficult of drainage, remaining wet for a long time after a rain or snow, and becoming a perfect bog; that the system of drainage neither carries off the surface water nor cleanses the sinks, and in a season of drought the sinks would prove a source of annoyance and probably a pestilence. He reports in reference to the commissariat that, compared with the rations that are issued to our troops in the field, it will be seen from the inclosed statement of rations issued from February 1 to 15, instant, 1865, that the prisoners have no cause to complain, and in reference to clothing, that the prisoners have suffered from the want of suitable clothing and blankets, but that recently 3,000 blankets and 1,000 pants from United States were issued, and, respecting the prison quarters, that 300 tents and flies of mixed sizes and patterns were issued in October, 1864, and constitute the only shelter that was provided during the winter for a number of prisoners, amounting in November to 8,740, and in February, 1865, to 5,070; that Major Morfit, quartermaster, exhibited the frame of a large barrack, which he had contemplated building, but which was fortunately stopped by the Commissary-General of Prisoners; that a better plan would have been to have constructed cabins of logs and shingles, for which the material was at hand in abundance, and they could have been erected by the prisoners, and that in this way the prisoners would, like the guard, have been made comfortable, and would not have been forced to burrow in the ground like animals. That respecting the prison hospitals, one of the most painful features connected with the prison is the absence of adequate provisions and accommodations for the sick; that there is no separate hospital inclosure, but with a few exceptions (see diagram) all the buildings in the prison yards are used as hospitals; that there were no hospital comforts-bedding, necessary utensils, &amp;c.; that the reason assigned to him on his first visit was that it was useless to supply these articles, as no guard was kept inside of the prison yard, and that they would be stolen.

Surgeon John Wilson, jr., the medical officer at present in charge, is endeavoring to supply these deficiencies, and has succeeded in effecting several improvements; yet much remains to be done.

He reports that there are only enough bunks for one-half of the sick, and that the rest have to lie on the floor or ground, with nothing under but a little straw, which, on February 16, instant, had not been changed for four weeks. He reports that for a period of nearly one month (December and January) the hospital was without straw, and that there is no excuse, for straw could have been procured in abundance at any time, and that he was assured by Captain Crockford, inspector of field transportation, that the transportation of the post had been in excess of the requirements of the post; that in January, 1865, when no straw was furnished, he found thirty animals standing idle in Captain Goodman's stable, and consequently ordered them to be turned
