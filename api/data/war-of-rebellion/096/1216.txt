Richmond, February 12, 1865.

So far as this circular treats of impressment, &amp;c., and its bearing on the Treasury and on this bureau, the subject was brought be me to the consideration of Mr. Trenholm last summer, and it was urged that Government should make it a subject of instant consideration; that the alternative was then before us of unlimited exaltation of prices and destruction of the currency, or of sustaining the views set forth. To enforce these I wrote this circular, shewed it to him, and again maintained that the law of impressment, being sustained by no penalty, the Government having been intrusted with its execution, had the duty of enforcing it, there being no alternative but to call Congress to act in a matter vital to the currency and the subsistence of the army.

Commissary-General of Subsistence.
