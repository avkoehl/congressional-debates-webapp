started right; and* it was moving within its consti-
tutional limits when" an unfortunate impulse was
given to it by one of the leading mmds oí that day ,
in the establishment of a national bank, which has
caused all the financial difficulties and embarrass-
ments the country has experienced for the last half
century
The administrationk.of Mr Van Buren termina-
ted m 1841, and resulted m again separating the
revenues of the Government from banks, and re
quiring their collection in gold and silver, the cur-
rency of the constitution His administration
brought back the action of the Government within
its constitutional limits, to exert its power identical
with its exercise before the estabksjfrnent oí the
first Bank of the United States It is now proposed
to lake a fresh departure, and on the very track
marked out by Alexander Hamilton in 1791 The
establishment of a national bank and a funded debt
was the occasion of the first formation of parties
under the constitution The issue now is the same
as it was then, and the same parties are rallying to
form it.
The question of a national bank has agitated the
country in every period ol its history. The people
have opposed it with inflexible hostility from 1791
to the present time, and they will continue to op
pose it, as an institution not warranted by the con-
stitution, and dangerous to public liberty Wo mat-
ter what may have been the opposite action of in-
dividuals in reference to its constitutionality or
expediency, the question will ever be regarded as
the landmark which divides the two great political
parties of the country, as long as the constitution
remains in its present iorm
In 1791, Jefferson and Madison on the one side,
and Hamilton on the other, were the expoundeis
of the great principles of their respective parties
The former maintained that Congre s possessed no
powers, under the constitution, which were not ex-
pressly granted, or mdi->pen3ably necessary to carry
the granted powers into effect, that by no rational
construction could the power to charter a bank be
derived from the constitution, that it was not
among the enumerated powers, noi was it fairly
referable to any of the implied or resulting powers
of the Government They relied upon the con-
temporaneous history of the constitution, and the
proceedings and debates m the federal convention
which 1 lamed it, to show that the power to charter
a bank was intended to be expressly inhibited Mr
Madison, in his celebrated speech delivered in
Congress m 1791, slated the following important
lact,—speaking ol ihe power to incorporate a bank
"This power (said he) was pioposert to be vesle'cl
in Congress m the original plan reported by the
committee of the convention, among the cnumen
tionof powers which now foim the 8th section of
the 1st article, but that aftei three days' ardent
debate on the special subject m tint body, the pou
er was rejected and stuck en out, upon the principle
lhat it wis a power impro]ei to be vested in the
Geneial Government" in support of the powei,
it was contended that although it w is not among
the enumerated powers, it wasmeidentalto the pow
ers granted, and that, by no legal rule of interpre-
tation, was it admissible to let in the contempoia-
neous lustoiy of the constitution, and the proceed-
ings and debates m the convention, to explain the
intent and meaning of the framers of the constltu
•tion in refeience to the power claimed The his
tory of the power, as given by Midison, was not
denied The common law rule of interpretation
was urged, which opeiated in exclusion of all in-
formation except that derived from the constitution
itself
Sir, if the rule of interpretation as contended for
by Mr Madison had prevailed,—if effeet had been
given to the known intent and meaning of the fra-
mers of the constitution,—this question, which has
agitated the people of the country for the last fifty
years, would have been settled in the Congress of
1791, by a solemn decision against the exercise of
the power
This, sir, wis the state of the argument in 1791,
when the first Bank of the United States was char
tered And now, in 1841, when the fathers of the
constitution are gone, we are met with the allega-
tion that the power of Congres* to charttr a bank
is a setlled question,—settled by the judiciary, and
by the approbation and judgment of the American
people Sir, I deny that the Supreme Court of the
United States have ever decided that Congress has
the power to charter a bank, to subserve the pur-
poses for which its friends contend for its establish-
ment—to restore order to a deranged paper cur
rency, and to regulate the foreign and domestic
exchanges of the country The Supreme Court, in
the celebrated case of McCulloch against the Bank
of Maryland, decide that Congress has the power
to charter a bank, if necessary as a fiscal agent of
the Treasury, and for no other purpose, and that
this power is incidental, and derived under the
clause of the constitution which prescribes that Con-
gress shall have the power to pass all laws neces-
sary and proper to carry into execution the enu
merated powers The necessity of a bank for such
purpose, the court decide, appertains to the sover-
eign power—the people, and it leaves to them,
through their constituted agents in the two Houses
of Congress, to determine that necessity The
court say a bank is constitutional, if necessary to
carry into execution the enumerated powers, if
necessary to collect, transfer, and disburse the pub-
lic revenues,—not that it may be convenient oi
useful to carry on the fiscal operations of the Gov-
ernment, but necessary,—not a bank to restore
order to a deranged paper currency, and regulate
exchanges, but a bank for the Government in its
own transactions Such a bank would be one of
depositesimply, and not of discount and circulation
The point of the decision of the Supreme Court is,
that a bank is constitutional if necessary to carry
on the fiscal operations of the Government, that if
the revenue can be collected and disbursed to the
public creditor ■« ithout the aid of a bank, then
Congress has no constitutional power to charter
one, that Congress is the sole and exclusive de-
positary of the powei, under the constitution, to
determine that necessity
Now, sir, if it be true (v mch I deny) that a bank
is necessary foi the Government in its-fiscal opera-
lions, to collect, transfer, and disbur>e the public
revenue,—do the wants of the Government require,
for suchpurpose,abankarmed with the tremendous
power of the one proposed by this biin The bill
proposes to establish a bank of thirty millions of
capital, with a power reserved to increase it to fifty
millions,—armed with the power of discount, de
posite and circulation,—with the power to establish
branches m the sovereign Stiles of the Union
against their assent Such a bank would control
the labor, the industry, the enteipnse, and the
wealth of the country, and render trade and com-
meiei* dependent upon it It would control the
State sovereignties, and obtain a mastery over the
Federal Government By sudden expansion of its
cunencyand credit, it would laise Ihe jirices ol
value, am! b\ sudden contraction, depress them
This pmerbythe bulls lodged in the hands of
nine elir< ctois, to be located at the city of Washing
Ion, to exeit the power in secret, without being re-
quited to apprize the people of intended expansion
or contraction of its currency and credit Such an
engine ol power may be fastened upon the willing
subjects of the monarchical governments of the o'd
woild, where power is stealing lrom the many to
the few, but in a land of republican freedom, where
the popular voice is the supreme law, it will be
rcsi'-ted, as it has ever been since the experiment
commenced of man's capability for «elf govern-
ment
And, sir, in violation of the decision of the Su
preme Court,—having the power, under ihe sup-
posed plea of necessity to charter a bank as a fiscal
agent,—it is proposed by the bill to extend its pro-
visions, to embrace other powers, objects, and
duties, not warranted by the constitution, or b) any
interpretation that has been given to it For what
object, su, do the friends of this measure ask for its
passage i I hold m mv hand a pamphlet on this
subject, emanatmgffom the merchants of Bo ton —
a city which, if newspaper report can be relied
on is to become the London of America If such
is her destiny, I rejoice in it I should rejoice to
see the place where the cradle of American liberty
was first rocked attain the highest pinnacle of pros-
perity her past history should secure to her a
noble destiny The pamphlet discloses that her
enterprising meichants claim the establishment of
a national bank, to secure a uniform currency, to
restore order to a elerangetl papei currency, to re-
gulate the exchanges, and to promote the industry
and enterprise of the country There is not an al-
legation in the pamphlet, claiming the establish
ment of a Bank of the United States on the ground
of making- it the fiscal agent of the Government
They do not ask for a bank to collect and disburse
the public revenues, but only as an instrument to
flood the country with a paper circulation, to plnn-
%
der industry of its rewards, and take from the hand
of labor the bread it has earned Thefe is no pow-
er m the constitution authorizing Congress to reg-
ulate exchanges. If a bank were competent to per-
form it, there is no more power in the constitution
to charter one for such purpose, than to provide a
means for the transportation of merchandise from
Ohio and Indiana to the Atlantic shore
Sir, at the called session of the twenty fifth Con-
gress I had the honor of a seat on this floor I was
a silent, but not an inattentive member of the de-
liberations of that body I recollect that it was
then contended in the other end of this Capitol, by
tne Jupiter Tonans of the exclusive paper system,
that a national bank was necessary to regulate for-
eign exchanges, which were then twenty-two per
cent Well, so, without the aid of a national bank,
and by the operation of the laws of trade,—which
are as uniform and immutable as the laws of mo-
tion or of gravitation, or any of the physical lawt>,—
foreign exchange so regulated itself, as that in the
month of March, 1838, it was reduced down to
eight and a half per cent, which is the par rate of
exchange between this country and England—the
sum which pays the transportation of the precious
metals, and the insurance upon the risk of trans-
portation This circumstance took away from the
friends of a national bank their most potent argu-
ment What then t Why, it was contended that
we must have a Bank of the United States to regu-
late domestic exchanges Well, sir, all the depre-
ciation in the currency now existing, and the con-
sequent derangement in exchanges, is attributable
to bank suspensions If the State banks would
only comply with their engagements, all this cry of
deranged domestic exchanges would cease Sir,
look at the state of exchanges between Charleston,
S C , and New York, they are merely nominal—
bnt one per cent , and the reason is, the banks of
Charleston and New York comply with their en-
gagements to the aountry, and pay gold and silver
for their obligationl-on demand Sir, if the bank-
rupt law recommended by Mr Van Buren, in his
message at the called session of the twenty filth
Congress, including corporations, had received the
favorable action of Congress, it would have been a
better regulator of the deranged currency and do-
mestic exchanges than all the national banks that
ever existed m the country
Another argument in favor of a Bank of the
United States i , that we must have one to establish
auniioim currency To this argument I answer,
that gold and silver, the only currency known to
the constxtuticpl is of unifotm and intrinsic value,
and that there is no power in Congress to establish
any other kind of currency By the constitution,
Congress has the power "to com money, and regu-
late the value theieof and of loreign com " Here
is an express power given to Congress to make
go'd and silver the legal currency of the country,
and there is no other power given on the subject
The lramers of the constitution never intended that
Congi ess should have the power to establish two
kinds of currency,—a gold and silver currency, by
exp-ess enactment of the constitution1 , and then, by
implication, to authorize a bank to make a paper
cunency, to drive gold and silverout of circulation
I invite gentlemen to show the power m the consti-
tution, either express or implied It is a law of
currency, that the baser circulation always drives
out ihe purer, that a five dollar bank note displaces
from circulation its corresponding value in the
precious metals, and the power is given m the bill
to this bank to drive gold out of circulation by its
five dollar notes Unless " to com monej ' means
íO com paper, thei e is no power given to authorize
a banr to issue a paper currency The verb "to
com," by all approved lexicographers, means "to
want, to stamp metals for money, to malee /mimpress
merit upon metafc" Some gentlemen when hatd
preyed m pursuit of this vagrant pow er in the con-
stitution to establish a bank of circulation, have
argued, that " to com money" means to stamp pa-
per   but the idea cannot be seriously entertained
There is, sir, another remarkable fact connected
wnh the grant that Congress shall have power ' to
coin money, regulate the value ihe-eof, and of for-
eign coin " Congress never performed its duty
under this clause of the constitution until the pas
sage of the gold bill, in June, 1834 Gold was un-
dervalued six and two-thirds per cent until that
bill passed, to suit the views of the friends of the
exclusive paper system, and the consequence was,
it was driven out of the country by exportation
The gold bill of 1834 restored gold coins to their
