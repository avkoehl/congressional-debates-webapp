GENERAL: I have the honor to inform you that my pickets have been pushed forward from their position of this morning, forming now a much rectified and strengthened line from Linney's, Gibbon's, to Bosher's house. Everything remains quiet.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Brigadier-General, Commanding Division.

JUN 7, 1864.

Colonel J. B. McINTOSH,

Commanding First Brigade:

COLONEL: I have advanced to the road leading to the left, and find on the Mechanicsville road a strong picket of mounted and dismounted men, who fired at my advance. I do not think it safe to advance in the direction of the right of General Burnside, as I might be easily cut off. The people at Mr. Gibson's house say that there is a considerable force on the other side of the swamps. Rebel infantry came up on the left-hand road yesterday afternoon.

I have the honor, colonel, to be, very respectfully, yours,

OTTO HARHAUS.

[Indorsement.]
HEADQUARTERS THIRD DIVISION, CAVALRY CORPS, June 7, 1864.

Colonel O. Harhaus is at Butler's. The point designated by him is at the junction of the roads near Gibbon's.

COLD HARBOR, VA., June 7, 1864.

Brigadier General J. J. ABERCROMBIE,

Commanding U. S. Forces, White House, Va.:

Captain Parker, assistant adjutant-general, goes to White House this morning for the purpose of ascertaining certainly the time when cars can commence running, and the probable time it would take thereafter to remove all the iron from the York River Railroad from the Chickahominy back to White House and place it on board of steamers. I shall not want to use the railroad at all for supplying the army, but will destroy it, so that the enemy cannot use the iron for the purpose of relaying other roads.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
