HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, June 25, 1864-12.15 p.m.

Major-General WRIGHT,Commanding Sixth Corps:

The major-general commanding has directed Colonel Bryan to send out a scouting party to Reams' Station, on the Weldon railroad, to find out what the enemy are doing in that direction.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS SIXTH CORPS, June 25, 1864-12.20 p.m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,Chief of Staff:

From the latest and best information it appears that the force reported as moving down the railroad did not exceed 2,000 or 3,000, and it is doubtful whether they proceeded farther than the point at which we tore up the railroad on the 23d. This number I believe to be largely exaggerated. My pickets at the Aiken house report a skirmish line of the enemy some 200 yards this side the railroad. Possibly the enemy is repairing the damage. I have sent an infantry reconnaissance to our right of that point, to reach the railroad if practicable, which will afford some certain information. There is no enemy in front of the pickets on my right.

H. G. WRIGHT,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS SIXTH CORPS, June 25, 1864-12.30 p.m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,Chief of Staff:

Your dispatch saying that Colonel Bryan had been ordered to send a scouting party to Reams' Station has been received. I had just sent him an order about the same effect.

H. G. WRIGHT,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, June 25, 1864.

Major-General WRIGHT:

Have you any report to the effect that the enemy's troops that were on the railroad have left there and returned to their works?

A. A. HUMPHREYS,Major-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS SIXTH CORPS, June 25, 1864-4.20 p.m.

General HUMPHREYS:

I have no such report as you speak of. Some cavalry did move northward some time ago, but the infantry still remained, perhaps only a skirmish line at last report.

H. G. WRIGHT,

Major-General.
