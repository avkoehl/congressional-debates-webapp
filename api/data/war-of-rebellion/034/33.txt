One company of our cavalry is out beyond them, and Colonel Harding entertains fears that they may have been captured. Everything possible is being done.

FORT HENRY, February 3, 1863-5.30 p. m.

Fighting commenced at Donelson an hour since. I directed Colonel Harding to make a demonstration to press back their advance, to find their strength, and then to fall back to the trenches. After they had been engaged about fifteen minutes, the line ceased to work. have started over some infantry and cavalry, and am now crossing more infantry, cavalry, and artillery. Will start over myself as soon as I can get force arranged.

FORT DONELSON, February 4, 1863.

A glorious victory over Wheeler, Forrest, and Wharton. One hundred and thirty-five of their killed already found. We have some 50 prisoners. Their wounded and stragglers are being continually brought in. Colonel [F. N.] McNairy, rebel, killed; Forrest wounded. the whole rebel force in full retreat. I have cavalry following. The precise number of the enemy I can't tell, but one of their surgeons now here says they had eleven regiments here. it is known they had from eighth to eleven pieces of artillery. Colonel harding and his force did noble fighting.

FORT DONELSON, February 4, 1863.

Enemy is in full retreat toward Charlotte and Shelbyville; cavalry have captured quite a number. I will suggest that a force can be sent down between the two rivers, and their whole force can be met and captured. They are out of ammunition and rations. Large fleet here under Crook and Gilbert, with seven gunboats.

Colonel, Commanding.
