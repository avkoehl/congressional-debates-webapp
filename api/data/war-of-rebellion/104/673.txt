MERIDIAN, May 8, 1865.

Major General E. R. S. CANBY,

Commanding, &amp;c.:

I understand that a portion of General Dana's garrison at Jackson, Brookhaven, &c., will be negro troops. I hope this can be avoided, for the present at least.

Respectfully,

R. TAYLOR,

Lieutenant-General, C. S. Army.
HDQRS. ARMY AND DIVISION OF WEST MISSISSIPPI,Mobile, Ala., May 8, 1865.

Lieutenant General R. TAYLOR,

Meridian:

In regard to the garrisons sent to Jackson and Brookhaven, &c., by General Dana, I would remark that he was instructed to make this selection from the best disciplined of his troops, and place them under charge of intelligent and discreet officers.

E. R. S. CANBY,

Major-General, Commanding.
HDQRS. ARMY AND DIVISION OF WEST MISSISSIPPI,Mobile, Ala., May 8, 1865.

Lieutenant General R. TAYLOR:

I feel under obligations for your dispatch of this date. It was the omission of the operator in not requesting that the cipher dispatch of last evening might be forwarded. I have ordered a light, strong tug to be sent up to tow the blockade steamers out.

E. R. S. CANBY,

Major-General, Commanding.
HDQRS. ARMY AND DIVISION OF WEST MISSISSIPPI,Mobile, Ala., May 8, 1865.

Lieutenant General R. TAYLOR,

Meridian:

I will act upon your suggestions as contained in telegram of this date, in regard to the Texas, North Louisiana, Virginia, and North Carolina troops. General Andrews will be instructed accordingly.

E. R. S. CANBY,

Major-General, Commanding.
HDQRS. ARMY AND DIVISION OF WEST MISSISSIPPI,Mobile, Ala., May 8, 1865.

General GEORGE L. ANDREWS,

Meridian:

General Taylor suggests that the Texas and North Louisiana troops be sent as soon as paroled, via Vicksburg, to Alexandria, on the Red River, and that a company of Virginians and a regiment of North Carolinians to be sent by sea from Mobile. The suggestions are approved by General Canby.

C. T. CHRISTENSEN,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
