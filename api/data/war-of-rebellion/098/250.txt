HDQRS. FIRST DIVISION, FIFTEENTH ARMY CORPS,April 2, 1865.

Lieutenant Colonel MAX WOODHULL, A. A. G., Fifteenth Army Corps;

COLONEL: In compliance with your letter of March 31, asking that recommendations for promotion may be forwarded with my official report, I have the honor to mention Bvt. Brigadier General William B. Woods, commanding the First Brigade of my division, and to earnestly recommend his promotion to the rank of full brigadier-general. General Woods is a brave, competent, and deserving officer, and his able management of his brigade during the recent campaign has been such as to entitle him to this reward from the Government he has so faithfully served.

I also recommend the promotion of Colonel R. F. Catterson, Ninety-seventh Indiana Infantry, to the rank of brigadier-general. Colonel Catterson assumed command of the Second Brigade of this division at Griswoldville, Ga., in November last, when General Walcutt was wounded, and has always since that time under all circumstances displayed marked ability, and his sound, cool judgment of the true soldier, in the management of his command. He has rendered valuable service to this country and proven himself to be worthy and deserving of the promotion recommended.

I respectfully ask that this letter may accompany my official report, forwarded before your communication was received.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

CHAS. R. WOODS,

Brevet Major-General.
