Colonel AUGUSTUS MOOR,

Commanding Weston:

Concentrate all your cavalry at Weston, where you will instruct it to remain until further orders, keeping pickets out a short distance. Move with your infantry and the battery to Clarcksburg with the least possible delay. Direct the quartermaster and commissary to take as many stores as he can to Clarksburg. I will as Captain Gardner to send for the balance. You must let him know how many wagons to send. Take the prisoners to Clarksburg, and turn them over to Colonel Wilkinson. Move at once.

WM. W. AVERELL,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

EIGHTH ARMY CORPS, Baltimore,

June 15, 1863.

Brigadier-General KELLEY,

Harper's Ferry:

The troops west on the railroad must all be directed now to concentrate at New Creek instead of Grafton. Give your orders accordingly, as I know not where to communicate all the necessary instructions, but I will send orders from here to General Averell and whoever is in command at Grafton, to get to New Creek as soon as possible. If your telegraphic communication is cut off west of Harper's Ferry, send orders via Baltimore and Pittsburgh. Do your scouts report anything from the direction of Winchester of Martinsburg?

By order:

DONN PIATT,

Lieutenant-Colonel, and Chief of Staff.
