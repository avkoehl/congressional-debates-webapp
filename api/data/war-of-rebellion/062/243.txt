itician, with Kansas troops at his command, it did not occur to me, and so think the people of Missouri, who were the sufferers, that it allowed Kansas politicians to make political capital out of the lives and property of the people of Missouri. Two millions of dollars will not compensate the people of Jackson, Cass, and Bates for property taken by Kansas thieves, and mostly by men having military commands or by their known connivance. And at this day I am being advised by men on the border that Kansas troops are yet in Missouri robbing the people, indiscriminately, of all they have.

I beg of you, general, on behalf of the people on the border, that you will put an end to this. The distress brought upon 20,000 free white inhabitants upon the border by the memorable order, Numbers 11, is untold, nor can it be believed only by those who have witness edit. I will be recreant to my duty if I do not at the very first opportunity expose the outrage of this order. I know there is a wish by some, not yet satiated by the blood and plunder of the people of Missouri, to have a continuation of the military connection of the two States on the border. They are now separated, and I can only hope for the sake of peace that they may remain so. I can but express the hope that you will require General Brown to make his headquarters at Kansas City, for he is most certainly needed there, and I am not aware of any chance for trouble at this time in any other part of his district. I assure you that the people on the border who have suffered so much desolation are not in the least moved by any distracting party considerations, which, unfortunately, have been the source of some trouble in other parts of the State. But with them it is a matter far above party, involving life and its enjoyments on the one hand, and desolation and destruction and anarchy on the other.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully,

AUSTIN A. KING.

General FISK,

Commanding:

A detachment from my regiment yesterday attacked the Bolin gang on Halcolm Island. Our force was under Captain Shibley. They killed 7 men and captured 8, and among them Bolin himself. We have him sure. They were on this side foraging. He took 15 wagons corn, mostly citizens', and 13 horses. They report that McRae is preparing to cross with 400 men and attack Bloomfield. They will be welcomed. None of our force were killed.

General FISK,

Commanding:

Bolin is on the way here, tied. Shall I shoot him without trial or try him by drum-head court and muster him out?

Colonel.
