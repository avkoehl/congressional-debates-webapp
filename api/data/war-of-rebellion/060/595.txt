FORT MAGRUDER, February 25, 1864.

Major R. S. DAVIS:

The enemy's scouts are collecting all the negro men, women, and children in the country in front of us, and carrying off both them and their stock. This I have just learned from negroes who have come in this p. m. I have ordered out 200 infantry, 100 cavalry, and a train of 15 wagons to start early in the morning and bring in all who want to come with their effects. There are quite a number. I issued the order to save time; can countermand if you do not approve. If the movement is made it will necessitate the delay of the Twenty-fifth Massachusetts detachment, as I shall be compelled to take 100 of that detachment to get a reliable detail in time to move early in the morning. Please answer soon.

ROBT. M. WEST,

Colonel, Commanding.
