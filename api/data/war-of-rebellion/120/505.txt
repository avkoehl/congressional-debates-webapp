GENERAL: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your communication of this date in relation to clothing issued to prisoners of war at the Lincoln General Hospital, and I beg to inform you, in reply, that the surgeon in charge has been directed to issue only inferior clothing, for which he is required to make proper requisitions. We have now about 60,000 prisoners of war on hand, for one-third of whom it may be expected we will have to furnish coats, pants, shirts, socks, shoes, and blankets.

I am informed that there are large amounts of unclaimed clothing at some of the general hospitals, and I wound respectfully suggest that it may be issued to prisoners
