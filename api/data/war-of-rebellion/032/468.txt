The enemy was reported at Augusta, but I learn from my scouts that they are all gone back. My scouts learn that the citizens at Augusta brought in all the produce they possibly could traded to the enemy, principally cotton. There is but a small force at Bloomfield, Mo. Colonel [S. G.] Kitchen's health is improving slowly.

I am, respectfully,

J. ELLISON,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding Tenth Missouri Cavalry.
