Treasury Circular, as connected with the Independent Treasu
ry bill Many &ena ors, on ihia side of the hall, in voting ior
ttia section intioduced into that bill repealing the Specie Circu
Ur, ha 1 sj vo ed with leluctance, because they did not consider
the two subjects properly or necessarily connected, but (he
question of repeat being dnectly presented to them, they were
bound tosu-.tj.jnit When the separate joint íesolution on the
sjbj-ct subsequently came before us, we voted for the repeal
wi b pleasure We considered the Spe le Circular partial and
sectional in its operation, and as having ceased to have any bene
ficiai efflct Ic never had any such effect, except for lour or
fiv months m checking inordinate speculations m the public
lands Jlut its íepeaf did not impair the objects or policy of the
Independent Treasury, and it was new to him that the intended
action of the other House upon that subject was to be consi
dered a mallei of suipnse, either by the honorable Senator, or
by any one el^e Cetumly no friend of the measure had ever,
for one moment, supposed that Congress would adjourn with
out adi ei tdec sion upon it, in one way or the othei Without,
howevei indulging m any further observations, he would call
o   the readme of the jepoit
Mr WRIGHT obseived that he was not disposed to excite
a debate on this matter, but he could not discharge what he
believed to b^ h's duty, and fail to reply to some of tne remarks
of the benator from Massachusetts What he had to e>ay would
not be in reference to the piopositionthe gentleman had given
notice of his ln'ention to introduce, but m reierence to a sort
of smprse he expie^ed that a measure which ne referred to,
and which having passed this body had been «ent to the other
House, and was there pending, would he taken up and acted on
The gen iemai --poke of the taking up ol thih measure, and
acting on i by the other House as something new andsurpris
wg "He knew, Mr W said, that there had been an attempt,
vast and persevering m its character, fo inculcate the belief
throughout the countiy, that this measure was ended for the
present, or to use the language of a gentle nan on that floor,
that it was deal and buned He was not able to contradict the
at egauuu, but he 1 new that when it was fir t made heie, he
expressed hs own di^enr, and declared that he had never re
nuutced the hope that tne other branch of Congress would,
be ore the end of the session, consider and decide on that sub
jectw thwh ci the feeling and interests of the counttywere so
closely connected He had therefore hoped that any movement
respecting it would not have been represented here as altogether
new and surprising He knew of no expectations that an
effort would be made here to considei that measure He him
self had no intention to make such an effort He also knew
that by a laige number, a disposition had been entertained that
itshoul I not be again considered in either House But it was
not r ght that it «hou 1 be represented any where that that mea
sure was e i led o^d nor again to be considered, that to take it
up and xctoi it .n ■ielodym whit h it was pending, was new
and sjrpi <u g It buch were the expectations of the Senator
from Massachusetts, he had drawn them from a source not
known to him, [Mr W ] He could not consent to sit by while
the Senator was making such allegations, without expressing
his dissent to them Again the Senator told them that within
a few weeks the country was springing into new life, that pros
penty wasieturning,and husmeo  reviving, but that this Ad
ministration had started up a measure which had thrown them
back again
We have seen that measure the subject of constant agitation
and unreasonable anxiety, and yet they were told that it was
dead and buned, and Hut the attempt to revive it would pro
duce alarm, embaiia-- i ¡enr, and distiess It was against such
infe esees that he was compe led to «petk He had he ml it
announce 1 fiom the <= ime quaitei that in consequence of the
passage of a measure to wnich tome importance was attached,
aresutnp ionn specie payments wassoon to commence by the
Bank ortlu, Unite 1 States, and that fact hal been announced by
their gr at all; himself Was that ally to recede so soon from
his purpose andt i>t, too, in consequence of the apprehended
attempt of tin-* Administration to revive the Independent Irea
surybill? If thu>pr >cUm<nton is not to be caned into effect,
was. it intended to lay the blame at our dooi? The Senator
knew that all tho-.e who advocated and supported this Irdepen
dent Treasut y bill here had nevei abandoned ¡t, and he should
nstb uif isLrl hatthcy «till « Ivicate it and lepjesentthem
as bringing ip as something new that which had been consigned
to the tomn He ought not to tepresen u as consigned to the
tomb till it is really so At present, said Mi W we do notagree
that it is
Mi WEBSTER The gentleman says if I flattered my=elf
that the subj ct was notaaaintobe agitated, that I have been
in great eiroi 1 tcertainly never flattered myself thit thev
would have cease 1 at any time to urge its passage if 'hev
tnought they could have done so It is part of then system—
part and parcel of their avowed policy When I state that it
was «unpo&ed the matter was at an end, it was not of ourselves
that I spoke, where we were in daily habits of conversation m
lelation to these topns, bur I spoke of the country, where, I
undertake to say that the impiession is geneial, ay very gene
jai, tha' t íesubjeet would not be likely again to excite and agi
tate th  count y And, «ir let me ask if I have not very good
foun iation on which t> rensuch an opinion even for myself*
Has it not been continually the party topic of the times'* Was
ir nof íecnved horn the Chief Magistrate at a former and the
picent session1* His it not twice parsed this house the last
tim  bv a mapnty ot two vote , and been sent to the othtr
Hous-1, wheie it has slept a solid sleep for ninety days'* And
was irhkeh to suppose that, at this advanced state of the ses
sion rf-^ix month":, aid near the time of adjournment when
Cono-iPss sits even fonsrei than usual—wa' it not natura!, I sa>,
to snppo« that it was abandoned? Ceitainly, nothme was more
natmat thin to suppose that there was no fuithei dispo mon to
disturb it Mr W then went on to show, that, so far is they
were able to ¡udge fiom their coirespondence, fiom the articles
of the duly presses etc that the matter was at an en 1, and
would no lonsei e\c te and agitate the country Ihe public
had acted on the be! of that we ha3 fallen back on the deposite
law Mt W c mc'u led by exp essms a hope that the subject
migh no asmo be made the mea ¡s of asi atrng the countiy, at
a time when the late action of the Government had already be
gun to be beneficially felt, in thereviv mg business, of commerce
and trade
Mr WRIGHT un lerstood now the difference between the
Senator and himself It was nit here then, that the impres
sion existed that an attempt wouU not be made to take up the
measure pending in the othei House, but the impression ex
isted abroad He did not know but that strong efforts had been
made to produce that impress on, but m a paper of the Oppo
sition where he had seen it declared that the measure was
dead and buried, and could not¿ succeed, he had also seen the
declaration that it would pass Now he did not know but this
last declaration was a better move than the other, or whether
both were not made for the purpose of producing a conviction
on the public mind unfavorable to the measure But the Sena
tor knew that when the vote to which he alluded was taken m
the other House, that the House was thin—that the e were
some twenty or thirty members absent The Senator knew
also, as well as he did, that from that time to this there had
been a strong controversy in the public mind as to "what would
be its ultimate fate
Mi BENTON said the conversational debate which had ta
ken place appeared to him to be irregular and unparliamentary
It is out of order to call in question the action of the House of
Representatives upon any subject, and to make remarks which,
even by implication, reprimand or threaten that Hoise Ihe
remarks of the Senator from Massachusetts, [Mr Webster,]
seem to imply a reprimand upon the House of Representa
aves foi proposing to revive, as he calls it—to revive the bill
for the divorce of Bank and State, and he attributeb to that re
vival the infliction of distress and alarm upon the country
Upon this idea of revival of a bill in the House of Representa
tives, there is certainly some remark to be made Has the Di
vorce bill ever been dead in that body? and if it was dead, have
not the house a right to revive it? and if they revive it, has the
Senate aright to animadvert upon them m the nature of are
pnmand, oír of a threat, for so doing? How stands the fact?
Has the Divorce bill ever been dead m the House of Represen
tatives? Certainly not They have two such bills theie, one
ol their own, which has never been acted on, and one from the
Senate, which has been laid upon the tabic Nowitispei
fectly competent to the House of Representatives to act upon
either of these bills Neither of them are dead, and to take
them up 1s* meiely to goon with existing bills, and not revive
dead ones If gentlemen, who have carried on a system of
boasting that the Divorce mil was dead, perhaps to make it die
—if these gentlemen have deceived themselves, or other", it is
their own misfortune, and no cause of censure upon the House
The Divorce bill has been in thaf House, as sent from us, three
months, but how many o(her bills have been there as long or
longer? The army bill has been there longer the pre emption
bill ako the steamboat explosion bill likewise, and the gradúa
Hon bill nearly as long, none of these measures are considered
dead, nor can it be called a revival when the House shall take
them up and act upon them I know not whethei the Divorce
bill will pass the House of Representatives I never remark
upon such a subject m this chamber I have seen gentlemen
of the Opposition for months pa*-t, proclaiming on this flooi
that thar bill was dead and buried m the House of Representa
tives I deeired all such speculation o * the fate of bills in the
House of Representatives, 11 bt unparliamentary and irregu
lar, and ncvei would join in a iy such remai ks, e> en to express
a contrary opinion, if I felt it
Mr B said this was a day to be marked in the history of the
times, this Friday, the Sth day of June, was a day to be remem
bered, for it was a day on w hich had commenced, and from
which time would go forward, a new war from the political
pat t of the banks against the Government and the countiy The
Treasury Older of July 11th, 1836, was rescinded Suarcely
was it done, when a billet from the president of the miscalled
Bank of the tinned States appearsj addressed toan old corre
spondent of the other House, in which the writer gives the pub-
lic to undetstand that the scales had been knocked from his
eyes, that he could now see what he could never see before,
and that the visiot bi ought to light by this second sight was the
immediatercsumption of specie payments, and the pieperva
tion of a good curiency Now sir, the insignificance of the
cau e for <mch gieat events struck every body The Treasury
Ordei had been mopeiame for ayear' it had been the same as
dead since the 10th of May, 1837 Besides that, the Senate had
passed a bill which contained a clause for its lecision thiee
month  before, and the passage of that clause, in some form or
other, was known to be absolutely certain in the House of Re
preventatives That order wa¿, then ro loncer a stumbling
block, even to the blind, to the resumption of specie pav mentp
us entire recision was nothing but an act on paper, the fact oi
inopeiation already existing Yet thismost insignificant encum
stance is seized upon by the president of the miscalled Bank of
the United States to back out from the famous non resumption
letter which placed that bank at the head of a confedeiatiou of
insolvent ami political bank« somucn wushonoi bothmFurope
and Am^ncd1 A pretext mtcht he wanting to retreu horn that
le ter oi to enable the writei to take a new hold upon h s sub
ject, and bottom hib non resumption on a moie tenable ground
It was a miserable pietext, and laughed at by every" bodj
Tan open íesumption, if íes jmption was intended, would have
been much bt-tei But it would teei i, from this day's  pro
ret dings that resumption was notnitended that a shifin^of
giom d only was wanted thataquairel with the Government
was the fhingdesned and that non r^umption wa^ to be the
pohev btill but based upon a new ground, and that around to be
founded 11 the conduct of the Government itself I look upon
the speech of the Senator fiom Massachusetts this day as a re
velation fiom the miscalled Bank of the United States' as a pro
clamation that she does not mean to resume' andas a declara
Hon thatshe is going on to foim her league ef non resuming
banks to levive the old panic scenes of lS33-3~>, to make all the
mischief that she can and to charge the whole upon the Inde
pendent Treasury bill or the new Treasury Ordei, or both, and
so make w?r upon the countiy again for the purpose of govern
ing the elections and forcing the Government to submit to her
This i«ths aspect under which the «cenes of this day present
themselves to my nind, and let the events tell how lar they are
true Certain I am that the events of this dav furnish new and
potent reasons for the pagase of the divorce bill Itpie^ents
usapaicel of banks making our action the cau=e of their re
sumption, ornon íesumption o*"specie payments pretending to
live, or die, as we do this oi that The import of what thev pre
sent j-s that they cannot resume it the Federal Gov eminent is
sepaiated fiom them and certain it is that the Government
cannot live if u is connected with them Thev make their own
ibihty to resume to depend on their conjunction with the Tede
ral Government now what .s this but to admit their msolv enrv
and to require the Government to supply then with credit to
goon"7 It is a confession of irsolvency, if it was true, and a
pretext for non íesuming if it was not and, ¡n either event, fur
mshed new and strong reasons for the passage ofthedivoice
bill It is not safe for the banks to depend upon the Govern
ment, nor foi the Government to depend upon the banks Di
vorce, eternal divorce, should be the word   and so fully am I
convinced of the necessity of that divorce, that I stake my polt*
tical existence upon it, and I am ready to sink with it. If that
measure goes down, I am ready to go down with it.
Mr WEBSTER said u might appear strange to the Senate,
that he should rise again oa this question, but he coulá net al-
low the member who last addressed them, or any other, to iq
dulge m such a course of perversion of remarks made by him
without notice He did not say, nor intend to say one word
d srespectfulto the other House The gentleman called his re-
ference to the delay of action by that body on a particular mea-
sure irregular and unparliamentary, and on his denial that
there were any such irregularity, the gentleman: boiled over as
tempestuous^is Etnaor btrombofi, with smoke, heat, and lava
What did he say? He said that the agitation of this question
again in Congi ess would necessarily produce agnation in the
eountr} He said that he believed that a new attempt to carry
that question would agitate the country anew, and the gentle-
man came out with a warm and zealous vindication of the
other House, as if it was assailed "Non tali auxilio eget"—
the House did not want the gentleman's assistance, it could take
care of itself, it knew him, and the denunciations and the vol
came eruption of the gentleman would produce no effect
Every body knew that he was speaking of this measure as one
that had already agitated the country, and therefore he was
wan anted m saying that an attempt to take up again would agi
tate the country anew
Mr BENTON said if the Senator from Massachusetts had
said nothing to threaten the House of Representatives when he
was first up, he had certainly done so now He had chaiged
that House with agitating the country, and preventing theievi
val of business, by reviving the Drvorce bill Agitation is the
word ht- used, agitating the countiy, and preventing the revival
ol business, is the accusation which he pie ers And has it come
to this, that heie, on the floor of the senate, the term agitation is
to be applied to the regutai and Constitutional action of the
House of Repiesentatives, onquestions depending before them?
and are they to be deterred from proceeding with a bill by being
stigmatized on this floor as agitatois, and charged with doing
mischief to the country? Sir, we have seen agitators assembling
m public meetings, adopting panic resolutions, sending on dis
tress committees wit*i distress petitions, to this city, all done by
self constituted assemblies, acting under bank impulsions, and
we have seen all these agitators extolled and applauded on this
floor, and now when the Constitutional representatives of the
people proceed w th their regular duties, they are to be called
agitators, and to be charged before hand with creating that dis
tress in the country, by agitating measures heie, v, hich the po i
tical bank party mean to crea e for their own purposes of mis 
chief, and then lalsely charge upon the measuresoi the Govern
ment This is what they have done before, thisis what they are
preparing to do again, and this is what these preliminary attacks
upon the House of Representatives are to covei over, and to
excuse in advance Sir, it it time for us to speak out, and to call
things by then right names it is time for us to strip off the
masks, and lo exhibit the mischief makers in their odious de
formity Here is an attack m advance upon the House of Re
presentatives, to deter it from going on with its business, and
this attack comes from a c'a^s of political banks which have
been making mischief ever^incelSJ^dnd fairly charging their
own work upon the Govenmer t The^e banks mu«t be met
with the language that is due to their conduct they must be dis
criminated from the business institutions, and the stamp of re
probation must be fixed upon them Th-y and their followers
must be detected and exposed, they must not Le allowed to plot
mischief against the country, and then come here and falsely
charge their own machinations upon the Gov ernment
The Senatoi from Massachusetts complains of fire and rocks,
of burning mountains, and rivers of lava, and seetrs Ut think
that I have huiled all the^e things upon his head tar be it
from my intention to use him so cruelly I only undertook to
learn the iu meconductof the Bank of the United States from
hi  present co iduct here to day and if, m doing this, I have
been w uting on his naked skin with the point of a red hot non,
t may hav e been the innocent cau e of all these confused sen-
sa ions about the«e fiery eruptions, heaving mountain*, flow
i tg nv ers, and filling rocks, which have led the gentleman to
believe that he was standing under the showers of oneofiho«e
volcanic mountain0 which buty a city in a ix.oment Ihe
i emed\ is to cover the head and fly 1 he inhabitants of Pom
pen and Hercul'eneum, m the time of Fhny the elder, covered
their hedds with pi low ^, let him cover his with a document,
and he will come our safe
Mr W EB^TER ob«en ed that the gentleman, with a remark
able emphisis and with a very w aim repetition of the argu
ment, insisted on for the last six months, had repeated the
charge that the Bank of the United States was about to «rourge
the country, with a view to bring about a state of things deslía
hie to it and the gentleman had found every time he addressed
his argument of the solidity of mountains in favor of his puie
doctrine that tin  bank h id some such design in view What
wasth*1 "course which the gentleman announced with so much
emphasis was to go abroad to the countrvi Why, it was a
repetition of the same song so Ions sung that the banks were in
a state of hostd tv to the Government, and that then interests
were opposed to each other "Who be ievedone word of thi<¡,
from Dan to Beer=heba? The gentleman had taken great ex
ception to some remarks which he [Mr \\ ] had just made, in
refeience to the action of the House Why he [Mr W jan
nounced nothin^ he spoke m no ones behalf, but orlv gave
his own individual opinion as to the effect likely to be produced
t  the revival of a particular measure He only spoke of
what was apparent to every gentleman who looked at cuirent
events, and who was acquainted with the bu"ine«s and com
meice of the country Everyman at all conversant with com
i íeiciaí affairs, and who was m the habit of consulting the
public n^w"papers, would kte that a disposi ion to press the
Sjb Treasury bill would «euously afiect ihe busme> andcom
meucoi the countiy The gen leman might entertain a diffe
íeiv t pinion But the eentleman spoke of the great irregulaii
t> f the reference he [Mr \\ ] had in de to the procee'insrs of
the other House, and stigmatized it as unparliamentary H nv
long was it since a repou was made to the Senate by a com
inuteLj of which the gentleman was a member, and with the
gentleman's enncunence m which this measure ard othera
rending m the other House were spoken of again and again
Was this irregular and unparliamentary? Did it not meet
with the gentleman a concurrence'* And if this report was not
irregular in the particular referred to, hnw could he justly be
charged with irregularity for following the example set by it?
But the truth w¿s, there was no irregularity in it There was
no parliamentary rule applicable to u,   %\ mJghi be irregular
