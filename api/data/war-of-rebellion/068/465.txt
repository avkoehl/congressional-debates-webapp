General Sedgwick directs that you leave two regiments at Germanna Ford to protect the bridge. Place one brigade on the road at Beale's house, the second road on the right coming up from the ford, and the rest of your division on the first road on the right after leaving the second line of works.

The cavalry referred to by General Humphreys will be under your command. General Sedgwick wishes that you should throw it well to you front and report at once any observations they may make.

You will keep out strong pickets.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

CHAS. A. WHITTIER,

Major and Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.

GENERAL: The Sixth Corps has been forced back from its position late this evening, and there is now every probability that before morning the enemy will intervene between you and this command. Should you learn such to be the case, move at once across Germanna Ford and down the river to Ely's Ford. There cross to the south side and remain with the wagon train until you receive further orders.

Yours,
