Brigadier General C. L. STEVENSON, Commanding:

GENERAL: Send your wagons, excepting ordnance and ambulance wagons, at once to Nicholasville. Send a fresh courier to Colonel Taylor, now on the Lexington and Harrodsburg pike, to join you by a forced march, and to send his wagons, excepting ordnance and ambulance wagons, to Nicholasville. In case you have to fall back this way let him know there is a pike leading from the Versailles to Nicholasville pike through Mortonsville, which joins this road about 4 or 5 miles this side of Versailles, by which he can join you. General Marshall is ordered to take post until further orders near the intersection of the Versailles and Nicholasville with the Lexington and Harrodsburg pike; should you have to fall let him know. General Heth's command has just been ordered up to your support. He will probably join you to-night. Colonel Taylor will reach to-morrow morning. Have the country in your front immediately and thoroughly reconnoitered, with a view of fighting the enemy there. Send the inclosed letters to Colonel Morgan at Lexington. He is ordered to join you with his entire command.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JNumbers PEGRAM,

Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF KENTUCKY,McCown's Ferry, Ky., October 7, 1862.

Brigadier General C. L. STEVENSON, Commanding, &c.:

SIR: In reply to your note of to-day I am instructed to say that if you have to fall back you will direct your movement to Nicholasville; but it is hoped you will not have to fall back at all, as General Heth's and Colonel Taylor's commands will encamp on this side of the river to-night and can move up to your support early in the morning, and even to-night if you are pressed in front. It is the general's intention to give battle to the enemy in the vicinity of Versailles unless his numbers should be too overpowering. The general request that you try to make your notes more legible, as it is with difficulty they are now read.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

JNumbers PEGRAM,

Chief of Staff.

P. S.-If any train of provisions shall come from Lexington through Versailles you will stop them and not let them come any farther this way.
