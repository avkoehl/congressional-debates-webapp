Major-General WARREN:

The signal officer reports a force of the enemy, about two regiments, north-northwest from the Aiken house, struck camp this a.m.; marched out camp, and have again returned, standing in company streets under arms.

JNO. G. PARKE,Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS THIRD DIVISION, FIFTH ARMY CORPS, September 27, 1864.

General WARREN,

Commanding:

GENERAL: I saw Parke this afternoon. He tells me that eight or ten deserters from the Sixth Virginia came into his lines to-day, who report that great depression exists among the men of the rebel army; that it was well known that Early had been twice defeated in the Valley, and that a rumor prevailed to-day that our cavalry was in Gordonsville. Do you wish me to occupy the entire line from Fort Howard to the right of Ayres? If so, I have no reserve. I understood that Ayres was to move to the right yesterday. The camps vacated by the Ninth Corps were so filthy that I have ordered my regiments to new ground in rear.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. W. CRAWFORD,

Brigadier-General.

GENERAL: I called to-day to ask whether you desired that I should occupy the whole line from Fort Howard to Ayres' left. I beg that you will direct differently, as now I have no reserve whatever. Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Brigadier-General.
