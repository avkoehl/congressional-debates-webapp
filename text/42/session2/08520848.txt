THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
February 6,
outside the protection of the Constitotion, for
all were and are incorporated. We may not
thus interpolate the Constitution.
But further, Mr. President, while I think the
provision is not in accordance with the spirit
of our institutions or with the Constitution, I
look upon it as a most dangerous subject to
open. Neither, sir, does it promote the inter-
ests of society or the welfare of any class of
the people. When dealing with the subject
of religion we have passed beyond the limits
of human law, and are dealing with spiritual
things that reach beyond time. The beneGts
of religion are not to be enforced by penal
enactments. These benefits have their origin
feud power in kindlier influences. They are
conferred from an appreciation of the great
truth that God has " made of one blood all
nations of men for to dwell on all the face of
the earth," from a recognition of the brother-
hood of man and of our accountability at the
bar of the great Fatherhood.
Aside from the infringement upon the Con-
stitution resulting from the disturbance of
public worship by privileges not freely granted
being insisted on, it would be a scandal upon
our Government for a white man to be per-
mitted to maintain a suit under the laws of
the United States because a colored commun-
ion refused to permit him to enjoy the privi-
leges which they in their lowliness and humil-
ity desired to enjoy with those who, having
been the victims of a common sorrow, could
sympathize with them 1 The two great doc-
trines of human progress and religious free-
dom should not be antagonized, and we should
hesitate long before passing the first law affect-
ing in any manner perfect freedom in the exer-
cise of religion.
I desire to support the amendment of the
Senator from Massachusetts, and the ques-
tion relating to jurors does not disturb me. I
do not understand that it is the right of a man
to be a juror, but that it is the right of a large
class that their whole class shall not be ex-
cluded from the jurybox. I can vote for the
amendment of the Senator from Massachusetts
if he will modify its provisions as to churches.
We do not wish to begin to legislate on the
subject of religion or of worship.
Mr. EDMUNDS obtained the floor.
Mr. MORRILL, of Vermont. There is
some executive business which it is important
to act upon, and, with the consent of my col-
league, I move that the Senate proceed to the
