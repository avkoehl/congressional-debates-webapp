NEW ORLEANS, LA., September 12, 1866.

Honorable EDWIN M. STANTON, Secretary of War.

SIR: I see by the papers that a suit has been brought against you by Mr. Smithson, banker, of Washington. Yesterday a person of the highest respectability called onme and said that Smithson attempted in the fall of 1861 to send through the lines a plan of the fortifications of Washington and other information, through Lieutenant Colonel B. B. Boone, a paroled rebel prisoner belonging to a Mississippi rgiment, who declined taking it because it would vioalte his parole, and my informant returned the documents to Mr. Smithson. The papers were inclosed in a small package of tabacco, the center of which was scooped out for the papers and a portion of the end cut off as though used. My informant is personally known to you and will give testimony should it be necessary to satisfy the ends of justice, but shrinks from any publicity being given to her name. She is a Sister of Charity and was connected with the Providence Hospital in Washington. The Sister will go to Washington should her evidence be necessary.

P. H. SHERIDAN,

Major-General.
