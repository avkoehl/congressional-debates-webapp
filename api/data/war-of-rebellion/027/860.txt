Which, taken in connection with the small number of missing, shows how dearly, yet how gloriously, their success was obtained.

It is with sincere regret that I have to state my adjutant-general, Major T. S. McIntosh, was killed, shot through the heart while carrying out one of my orders. The country has lost in him as brave and as gallant an officer and gentleman as any that survive him. My inspector-general, Major Goggin, was with me during the day, carrying orders and superintending their execution, in the performance of which duties he exhibited great daring and cool, sound judgment. To Captain King and Lieutenant Tucker, aides-de-camp, and Captain Costin, signal officer; Lieutenant Campbell, of the Engineers, and Lieutenant Edwards, ordnance officer, I am indebted for their zeal and activity; their gallantry was conspicuous in the performance of their duties. Colonel Henry Coalter Cabell, chief of artillery, who had been absent, sick, joined me on the field, and remained during the rest of the engagement.

I inclose reports of brigade commanders, and call attention to their notices of individual merit.

Very respectfully,

L. McLAWS,

Major-General.
