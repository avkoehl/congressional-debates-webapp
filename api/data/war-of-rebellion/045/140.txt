WAR DEPARTMENT, June 15, 1863.

(Sent 2 a. m., 16th.)

Major-General COUCH,

Harrisburg:

I understand from General Sandford that the New York City regiments, numbering from 8, 000 to 10, 000 men, will be forwarded by Governor Seymour. They ought to reach you in time to check the enemy. Every exertion is being made by the Department to support you. Please keep me advised of the position of the enemy, that I may communicate with General Hooker.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

COLUMBUS, OHIO, June 15, 1863.

(Received 11. 15 a. m.)

Honorable E. M. STANTON:

I have the President's proclamation of yesterday and yours of this morning. Nothing shall be left undone to promptly respond to your calls. I have no doubt the loyal men of the State will promptly obey. Name Camps Cleveland, Chase, and Dennison as the camps of rendezvous. We are short of arms of every description.

DAVID TOD,

Governor.

Governor TOD, Columbus:

Arms will be on hand before the men. Orders have been sent to New York. There are 10, 000 stand at Cincinnati, 16, 000 at Columbus, as just reported to me by the Ordnance Department. Any deficiency of accouterments can be had from Pittsburgh, where there are about 60, 000 sets complete.

SPRINGFIELD, ILL., June 15, 1863.

(Received 2. 50 p. m.)

Honorable E. M. STANTON:

If left to my discretion, I could not to-day recommend six-months' volunteers from Illinois under such a call. None but Union men would volunteer, and, since the revocation of the order for the suppression of the Times, the excitement is intense. Day after to-morrow the Democratic Convention for the Northwest is to be held here, and it is supposed by some that it will inaugurate direct opposition to the Government, if not revolution in our midst. Under these circumstances, I do not feel at liberty to promise you troops from Illinois. Should the convention prove harmless, then Illinois will do her full share.

RICHARD YATES,

Governor.
