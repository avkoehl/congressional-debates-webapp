THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
April 30,
Here let me remark to my old associates on
the Republican side of the House, who form-
erly belonged to the Whig party, and especially
to thegentleman from Oneida, New York, [Mr.
E. H. Kobbrts,] and to the gentleman fxom
Massachusetts, [Mr. Dawes,] lhat in this pro-
gramme we stand up as high as the Whigs did
in the tariff of 1842, and in some cases we go
higher than when the Whigs in 1842 gave the
iron and the woolen and cotton manufacturers
all they demanded from this Government, and
all that Mr. Clay and Mr. Webster would then
agree to give them in their infancy, as it was
said, but in their maturity now.
Mr. DAWES. The gentleman from New
York says in what he speaks to day he repre-
sents himself and his Democratic associates
on the Committee of Ways and Means, and I
should like to make an inquiry whether he and
his associates on the Committee of Ways and
Means will support the bill reported by the
committee?
Mr. BROOKS, of New York. Whenever
I see a reduction of taxation I will hit it.
[Laughter.]
Mr. DAWES. Is it their intention to sup
port the bill reported by the committee V
Mr. BROOKS, of New York. Whenever
you reduce the tax on an article forty per
cent., when it was paying a revenue before
of one hundred per cent., we will hit it hard,
and when you reduce it only ten per cent, wo
■will hit it soft.
Mr. DAWES. Answer my question.
Mr. BROOKS, of New York. We intend to
vote for every available reduction of the tariff.
Mr. DAWES. Does the gentleman and his
associates say they propose to vote for this bill
reported from the committee?
Mr. BROOKS, of New York. Let mo ask
the gentleman from Massachusetts whether he
intends to vote for the bill he himself reported ?
Mr. DAWES. Lwill answer the gentleman
when he answers my question.
Mr. BROOKS, of New York. We are both
Yankees, and will not get much out of each
other. [Laughter.]
Mr. DAWES. Answer.
Mr. BROOKS, of New York. I cannot
yield further, as i have not time to spare.
Mr. DAWES. 1 want to know what the
gentleman means when lie refers to himself
and his Democratic associates.
Mr. BROOKS, of New York. Give me lime.
Mr. DAWES. L will give you all the time
you want.
Mr. BROOKS, of New York. If the House
will give me all the time, very well.
Mr. DAWES. The House will give you
the time without objection.
Mr. BROOKS, of New York. Very well.
Mr. DAWES. As the gentleman is spenk-
ing for himself and his associates on the Derao-
cratieside of the House on the Committee of
Ways and Means, 1 should like to have an
answer from Inm whether they intend to vote
for the bill reported from the committee or not.
Mr. BROOKS, of New York, if J answer
that question will the gentleman from Massa-
chusetts answer me one?
Mr. DAWES. I will hear the gentleman's
question.
Mr. BROOKS, of New York, Does the
gentleman trom Massachusetts who reported
the bill intend to vote for it?
Mr. DAWES. The gentleman from Massa-
chusetts does not intend to vote for the bill in
its present shape. Unless a majority of the
House amend the bill in important respects he
intends to vote against it.
Mr. BROOKS, of New York. On what
principle did the gentleman from Massachusetts
report a bill which he does not in tend to support?
Mr. DAWES. The gentleman from New
York will have a fair answer to that question.
The gentleman from Massachusetts reported
the hill in obedience to instructions from his
committee, and with the express permission
of the committee that he should state before
the House that he dissented most emphatically
from the essential provisions of the bill, and
that he might offer amendments to give effect
to what were his objections to it.
Mr. BECK. 1 desire also to ask the gen-
tleman from Massachusetts a question. Did
the gentleman from Massachusetts ever t^ll
the committee that he would vote against the
bill if he could not carry his amendments?
Mr. DAWES. The gentleman trom Massa-
chusetts told the committee that he never could
vote for that bill in its present shape.
Mr. KELLEY. 1 would like to inquire
further if anybody is responsible for the bill?
[Laughter.]
Mr. BROOKS, of New York. It certainly
was not possible to have made a fairer Com-
mittee of Ways and Means than the Speaker
made, there being four and a halt on each
side. What makes the half, I leave the House
to decide. [Laughter.]
Mr. DAWES. 1 would like the gentleman
from Kentucky [Mr. Beck] to state to the
House who lie expected to vote for the bill, if
it was not those who instructed me to report it?
Mr. BECK. 1 did not hear the last remark
of the gentleman from Massachusetts. Will
he repeat it?
Mr. BROOKS, of New York. I decline to
yield further.
The cotton manufacturers of this country in
1842 were content with an average duty of
thirty per cent, ad valorem. i'hat was the
duty under the high Whig tariff of 1842. They
now have from thirty to seventy-two per cent.
The manufacturers of woolens under the high
tariff of 1842 were content with forty per
cent. They now have from fifty-three to eight
hundred and seventy-two per cent. The pro-
tection of iron lias increased in like manner.
I subjoin a brief list of articles by way of
contrasting 1842 with 1871 :

This programme of a tariff which I present
here, necessarily goes higher than the Clav-
Webster tariff of 1812, because it is necessary
to provide for the public debt; and yet my hon-
orable friend from New York [Mr. E. H. Rob-
erts] and my discontented friend from Massa-
chusetts, are not satisfied with a taiiff which
goes far beyond what we in those days dreamed
of, even when we were attacked as high pro-
tectionists, or what was demanded for the
Republic, or what Clay or Webster ever de-
sired to give to the Wings of that day, though
clamoring for protection.
I hold in my hand our programme ior re-
ceipts from the internal revenue, and a state-
ment of what taxation we deem necessary to
be derived from that source, and to be added
to the customs. The existing duties on spirits
we keep up at sixty-live cents a gallon. On
tobacco we recognize the report of the Com-
mittee of Ways and Means, proposing a uni-
form rate of twenty cents per pound. We
continue the present duty on fermented liquors,
the present tax from banks, le-s the tax from
savings banks, and the present tax in stamps.
The receipts from customs as calculated from
the importations of the calendar year 1871,
would be $152,021.407; and from internal
levenue $100,1(51,429: from land sales, $2,-
000,000; trom miscellaneous, $5,000,000; mak-
ing the receipts altogether, from all these
sources, iS2o9,182,86t>. Add for elasticity of the
revenue five per cent. While it was five and
one half per cent, under the tariff from 1870 to
1871, and eight, and one half per cent, from
1869 to 1870, we make the elasticity now only
live percent . amoundngto $12,893,571. Add-
ing this we propose altogether to raise in tax-
ation from the people .i>272,07(>,487, tabulated
thus :

for the calendar year 1871.

The recapitulation of all these tables will
then stand thus:

debtor for other purposes  532.641,615
Tu this programme we have between six and
seven hundred articles of revenue which we
now propose to make free, thereby abolishing
to that extent the existing tariff and freeing
the people from the taxation, more especially
the manufacturers of the country, in reliev-
ing the m from very heavy taxation often im-
posed upon the r w material. We make salt
free, free coal, free timber, lumber, hides, and
many other articles of great importance to
the country. We were forced to recognize the
action of this House ana of the Senate of the
United States upon tea and coffee. I deeply
regret that we were so forced, but as public
men and statesmen, no matter what are our
own opinions, we are obliged to recognize, as
facts accomplished, that tea and coffee are to
be free.
I shall soon close these remarks, wbich I atn
aware ai*e somewhat heavy and necessanl/
tedious in a figurative point of view ; but be-
fore i close I desire to invoke the special
attention of both sides of the House to the
condition of our exports. 1 pointed out here
some years ago the then approaching destruc
