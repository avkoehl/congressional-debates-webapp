Your letter of this date has been received and laid before the commanding general, who directs that you at once measures to carry into effect your proposition to send a detachment down the Neck for the purpose of capturing any small parties of the enemy that may be found in that quarter, of breaking up contraband trade, of seizing mails being conveyed to and from the enemy's lines, seizing any supplies intended for the enemy, and making arrest of such citizens as shall appear to be active engaged against us.

Great care and direction should be exercised in making arrest. The party will find an abundance of forage on the Neck. All provisions and forage likely to be used by the enemy, and not needed by our own troops, will be destroyed.
