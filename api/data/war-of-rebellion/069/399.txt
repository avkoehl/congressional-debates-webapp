HDQRS. FOURTH DIVISION, FIFTH ARMY CORPS,May 31, 1864.

Captain MARVIN,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

SIR: My pickets connect with Griffin on the right and Lockwood on the left; Crawford's pickets are in the rear in the same piece of wood; it embarrasses my men. I ask that they be withdrawn.

L. CUTLER,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,May 31, 1864 - 7.30 a. m.

Major-General WRIGHT,

Commanding Sixth Corps:

The major-general commanding directs that you throw forward your right, push out skirmishers, and ascertain where the enemy is in your front, and what position he holds.

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS SIXTH ARMY CORPS,May 31, 1864 - 9.05 a. m.

General HUMPHREYS:

The enemy's intrenchments extend in front of Russell, the continuation being lost in the woods on the other side of the swamp, supposed to be the Totopotomoy, or one of its branches. How far the left extends I have not yet learned, but am expecting further report every minute.

H. G. WRIGHT,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS SIXTH CORPS,May 31, 1864. (Received 9.30 a. m.)

Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

I respectfully report the result of the advance of my skirmish line as ordered this morning. The enemy appears to be strongly intrenched along my entire front, occupying a high ridge, difficult of ascent, and in some places perpendicular. The timber is slashed on the slope of the ridge, and immediately in front of the intrenchments (which are some distance back from the brow of the ridge) is an abatis. Immediately in front of my skirmish line is a swamp, thickly wooded, and averaging about 300 yards in width. The swamp extends to the foot of the ridge occupied by the enemy, and is occupied on the farther side by sharpshooters.

H. G. WRIGHT,

Major-General, Commanding.
