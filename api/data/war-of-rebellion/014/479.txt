general of this department, informs me that General Johnston answers in effect that the matter remains with me. This cannot be so, as relief is specially asked by Brigadier-General Jones to come from the reserve under command of Major-General Smith.

The complaint, it seems to me, is universal and the dissatisfaction great, that all the duty is imposed on a part of the army and none on the reserves.

Some companies of the artillery ought to be relieved without delay; otherwise they will be unable to serve their pieces.

These companies belonged to the Army of the Peninsula, and have slept on the platforms of their guns and been under fire without relief since the 4th of April continuously. They can keep no fires; many of them have chills and fevers; all of them should be put in the reserve for a short time, I think, and what is called reserve artillery should be substituted in their places.

These are gallant and devoted men, and I am naturally anxious that they should not be kept longer in their present position than they can bear.

I most respectfully request that the commanding general will cause Lieutenant-Colonel Brown's reasonable application for relief for a portion of his artillery to be granted without delay by Brigadier-General Pendleton, chief of artillery, and that a regiment from Smith's reserve be ordered to relieve for twenty-four hours the First Kentucky Regiment to enable its officers to organize it. This cannot be done by me, as I have no troops with which to do it.

I have the satisfaction to report for the information of the general commanding that I addressed the South Carolinians, Kershaw's brigade, yesterday afternoon, after which all re-enlisted into service without a murmur, and I believe, if the suggestion of Brigadier-General Jones is acceded to by the commanding general, there will be no further trouble, but if it once commences there is no knowing where it may end, for I have intimation that there is at least one officer of rank who sanctions by his language the idea that the conscription law is unconstitutional and not binding upon the men, and the men, it is said, know his views.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. BANKHEAD MAGRUDER.
