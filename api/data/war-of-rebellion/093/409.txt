Major-General THOMAS,

Commanding Army of the Cumberland:

GENERAL: I have the honor to calling to your notice the conspicuous gallantry and meritorious conduct of Colonel Emerson Opdycke, commanding a brigade in General Wagner's division, Fourth Corps, in the battle of the 30th ultimo.

In the early part of the engagement a portion of the Second Division, Twenty-third Corps, was somewhat disordered by misunderstanding the purpose of retiring through the lines of the two brigades of Wagner's division, which had been engaged in advance. It was at this time that Opdycke's brigade was lying in reserve on the Columbia pike, and being called upon, he led them forward in the most brilliant manner, charging the advancing rebels and restoring the continuity of our lines, which were not again disordered in the slightest degree. Colonel Opdycke's promptness and courage deserve official notice, and as I awe commanding the line at that time I deem it my duty to bring the facts to your attention, the more especially as he does not belong to my division.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. D. COX,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
