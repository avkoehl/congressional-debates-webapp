HDQRS. EASTERN DIVISION, DISTRICT OF THE GULF,Blakely, April 2, 1865-8.30 a. m.

General MAURY,

Mobile:

The enemy camped apparently in large force one mile above us last night on the Stockton road, and is now engaged skirmishing on the left flank preparing, I think, for an assault or demonstration in force. I need additional artillery temporarily if it can be spared. My cipher reader, Massey, has not yet returned from Mobile.

General MAURY,

Mobile:

I think a gun-boat should be placed at once in the mouth of Raft River to prevent the enemy from interrupting navigation by placing a battery on land.

Commodore FARRAND,

Commanding Naval Forces, Mobile:

If the gun-boat Morgan is not needed where she now is, please order her at once to lie at the mouth of Ralf River to protect our left, as the enemy are now advancing on the left, and the Morgan can rake the right of the enemy's line.

The bluff in high and the Huntsville has not sufficient elevation. Please send Morgan or some boat with more elevation.
