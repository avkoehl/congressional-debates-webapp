I learn that you have a force of 2, 000 infantry and two batteries at Poolesville. I request that they be ordered to seize the South Mountain Pass, and to hold it at all hazards. It is important that they should take possession of it to-morrow.

BALTIMORE, June 19, 1863-7. 10 a. m.

Brigadier-General TYLER, Harper's Ferry, W. Va.:

Your two dispatches of last night received. The building by Jones of a permanent bridge over the canal I think rather indicates that the forces which have crossed above you are the advance of General Lee's army, which is now reported to be passing in force into the Shenandoah Valley. Watch closely. A day or two will develop.

DONN PIATT,

Lieutenant-Colonel, and Chief of Staff.
