But, to come back, i put it to gentlemen whe-
ther it is right and fair to make this great change in
the land system of the country at sucl a ime'
Would you hie us to do it if condi ions were re-
versed?
But there are other considera ions wh ch admo-
nish us against legislating on tin? «ubject at the
present time We have not yet officially rtcencd
the results of the census for the la-t ten yeirs, we
cannot, therefore, sec whethei the new States have
filled up as rapidly as we could wish Let us firs'
see what is the number of their population; so thpt
we may judge whether any further siimu.ant is
needed to quicktn the rate at which then rumbéis
increase. I know, indted, that the result >> ul ¡.Low
directly the contrary. From tab es xxhioh I c¿u ul
to be carefully constructed nine }ea<-s a¡to, it is
shown that the population of the new State" in-
creases at a rate vastly over that of the old Take
a single example The population of ll'incis
doubles itself m six years' Wha , then, i, the
ground for the adopt.on ot this new sy-t in? Dt cs
it consist in some nouons of chanty to th' pier' i
have formerly adverted to that subject. Wh re do
gentlemen get their ngl t to set up e'eirm^yt ary
laws for the benefit ol the poorer portions of the
commumtj? But if they ha/e, nhat will b to

Mr WRIGHT s u i he ha', yc=*erdp'-, he-
fo-r .ii y qtt t o'l x a<- t ksn on this bul, ofT'red a
fv  le it rk to the Stna'e on one 'uig'c qtes .on,
and xxi h one sm<-l oiirpc=e, ni that v as 'o sht i
tri il no Uw xybioh lliey could ¡ ass co'dd ha> p any
i fluence, wuhm ene ot «he S at' -. of the Ua'o ,
upon a hoiLr under this Government, of apakit
forlaiid^, as to ihe security, or perpetuation, or
tr^nstcr of his title He attempted to show that
the State, and not tms Government, has the cont ol
of that matter, and that any alien receiving the r
patent wou" i'fcs f-e title, and that it would de
pend upon the institutions of the Slate whether he
could hold, aid vhetherhe could transmit or trans-
fer it, and therefo'- , that the amendments then un-
d'r d s-ussion were entirely unnecessary, unknown
to their legislation, and of no practical utility. He
had then, in lllustr?' on of the atgument he had at-
tempted to make, le ened to the suggestion of the
honorable Semtor from Kentucky, [Mr. Clay,]
who had just taken hts yat, m^dc on afoimet day,
and m reference to the influence of out legislation
?s to tne sale ol land- upon the subject of voting in
the Stales, and to that incidental remark of hi?, the
honorblc Scnatoi fairly and pioperly, though unex-
pectedly to him, tephed. it was i0 answer the ho-
norable Senitoi's argument on that point, and not
to discuss the bill under consideration, that he now
threw himself on the indulgence of the Senate.
There was one part of that Senator's remarks,
which he hould not anoiver, namely, that the vote
of one Sta'e, at the Utc election, ihe gentlemen was
lt'icrmrd, and upp'sedtobe true, was controlled
by the 10 is of petsons who were not naturalized
cii/ciisof t i< Un ted States. Having no know-
ledge oi the facts, he referred a'l that matter to the
SeriAtois on that fie or, who represented the State to
which allusion had b-en made. He referred also
Ihe bil',and its provision , to the Senators from the
St tes more immediately interested, and who
xvrrt mucn more able than he was to discuss it
As to the incidental ¡omt, one of vast importance
—no less than tí e qualifications of voters, and as
to th- que tion where rest, the power to prescribe
i''o e qaa fi^.lions—he could not, m jus'ice to
bun e'f, lo le   than m ike some reply to the remarks
ot the Scna'or froii Kentucky. He admitted,
however, that be t as led into an error in making
thit simpl abusión on the previous elay, as he had
afforeled the Sena tor from Ksnlutky an oppoimmty
ti draw thi discu^i n from the point before
i"° L>gr latine, and fron the proper ques'ion to be
d scus cd. The question between the Senatorfiom
Ke-ntt cky and himself was, first, where rests the
rgh'to pttsCtiDc the q eal ficattons of voters for
mi 'nbers of tre National L gislature in this coun-
try, fen he cióse to confine himself wilh'n that
him', but it t c Senator de-ired more broad ground,
he would then siy for the officers of the State Go-
v mm ¡its, anil, by et,nseqiente, for the members
oi the Nan n 1 L-us'atute1
lias this Government =ny power whatever over
those q i?I ficatiotis «pen prescribed by the States''
Ilc(i\ji. Wn Mu) ud )Cjtere'ay ehat, as he un-
e er tteei th s1 bject, the '\holi power was commit-
ted to me Sti e, and that no branch e f this Govern-
ment cot.1', n. any way, consutu'ionally inter-
ine Ir he indtrtood the argument of the
hoLOtable S nator, and that honorable gentle-
rx<.n vx-ooU' believe him when he said he d'd
rot intend to m su.i''erstar d him, it was that
the qiait.taion if natuialuauon ovtr-ndea
t ii pe net e f tt >• S ate, and, res mg m the hands
cf bus Gjvcip.nent, un il >t shall constitute an
emit,ta.it f-om a toteign eountry a citizen, the
Saw in whtcn he may reside cannot constitute
nun a voter. He believed he statu! the argument
fiirly and tru'y.
No At he did not mopo.e to go into this
discussion, it was ab^xe h's sphere, but he had
sime su <;esicis to ra, k , wrich it was his
duty, a1 tne dilie^t pen d, to lay before this body,
ard before his couatiymej What xxas the ques-
tio 1 It ""is—in rt/etcilie to one class—and
tt th^y wen' b".sk to the commencement of out his-
tory as a co i u ut oni! Gt,vei nment, s. very large
cla's—if tl.ey looked to the tuiure, likely to be as
large a (l,s 0' the mnabttants cf this country, the
tibers of me < ji1, and the ot eralives, in all the avo-
ca' 'ons of ba ) ess—has ihis Government tne power
t say whether lh<.y shall, or shad not, be the free-
men o the CJ) iti"d Sta'e-, in the common accepta-
tion of the ' i>' Whence ¡s that power denved?
Wnere did th s Senator look for th  right of mter-
breice Was it m our Constitution' He (Mr.
Wiiohi)   had carefully   examined   (hat   ínstrn-
