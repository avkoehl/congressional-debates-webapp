(Received 11.50 a.m.)

Hon. E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

At 9.15 this a.m. we had started from Washington for the west 12,600 men, 33 cars of artillery, and 21 cars of baggage and horses. The first four trains, with 2,500 men, reached Benwood, the end of our line, 412 miles from Washington, at 11 this a.m., and continuing to move at the ratio expected by us, or two hours through. At Benwood a substantial and superior bridge of scows and barges, strongly connected, is in full readiness to make the transfer across the Ohio, and adequate cars are waiting at Bellaire.

Hon. E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

Our agent at Grafton has orders, he says, to hold all the Third Division, Eleventh Corps there until General Schurz arrives. May I suggest that this kind of thing will cripple your whole movement? I have therefore given a peremptory order to our agent that the trains shall not be so held unless his order comes from you.

W. P. SMITH.

(Same to General Hooker.)

You have done right. Order your men to disregard every order or direction but your own. Report immediately to me any officer that presumes to interfere with you,and let me know who gave the order referred to in your telegram.
