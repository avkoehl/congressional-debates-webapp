Brigadier General F. J. HERRON,

Commanding 2nd and 3rd Divs., Army of the Frontier, Camp Curtis:

Yellville is farther to the east than our scouts have penetrated. Companies G and K, First Arkansas Cavalry, are now in Carroll County. They have met with occasional detachments of Home Guards, but in no strength. They have lately been within 30 miles of Yellville, but did not think it prudent to try to enter the town. I am now about to recall them, as their horses are in bad shape.

General Blunt is still at Camp Babcock, where he was on the 15th instant, the date of an important dispatch to General Schofield. Camp Babcock is near Lindsey's Prairie, in Benton County. The enemy seem to have retired from before him, and from conscripts and escaping Missourians I learn that Hindman's main force is the other side of the Arkansas River. I received a dispatch from Blunt last night directing me to throw out scouting parties toward Huntsville and Fayetteville. I have done so, but apprehend no particular danger from those directions just as present. There is something mysterious, however, about the reports of forces at Huntsville that I have as yet been unable to fathom. A day may clear matters up.

A. W. BISHOP,

Lieutenant Colonel First Arkansas Cavalry, Commanding at Elkhorn Tavern.
