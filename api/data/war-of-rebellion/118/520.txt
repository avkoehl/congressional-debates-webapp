Assistant Adjutant - General.

LOUISVILLE, KY., April 25, 1863.

President LINCOLN:

Pray let my son, Major Clarence Prentice, now at Camp Chase, be paroled and be permitted to return to the Confederate Army to effect his own exchange. This course has been adopted in other cases and would be most agreeable parents.

GEO. D. PRENTICE,
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF VIRGINIA,Fort Monroe, Va., April 25, 1863.

Acting Read - Admiral S. P. LEE,

Commanding North Atlantic Blockading Squadron.

ADMIRAL: The officers of the insurgent army confined at Fort Norfolk will be sent to Richmond on parole in two or three days. There have been some unsettled question in regard to the exchange of officers but they have been adjusted by Colonel Ludlow and Mr. Ould and the delivery on both sided will proceed as usual. Please inform me whether Lieutenant Rogers, of General French's staff, shall be sent up with the others. If you desire to retain him I will send him to you. his detention by me would be improper as it is inconsistent with the articles of agreement for the exchange of prisoners. These articles were negotiated and signed by me and it would be embarrassing to me to have Mr. Rogers in my custody after the other officers are sent away.

JOHN A. DIX,

Major - General
