HALLTOWN, W. LA., August 25, 1864 - 8.30 p. m.

There is no doubt of the presence here of a large portion of Longstreet's corps, General Anderson commanding. Early and Breckinridge moved this morning in the direction of Sherperdstown and were met by our cavalry near Kearneysville not far from Blue Spring or Leetown, The cavalry was opposed by Breckinridge's corps. After some skirmishing, Wilson's division was ordered into its present position here, and Merritt to Shepherdstown. Merritt was followed and had to leave Shepherdstown and fall back here, Custer crossing to the north side at Shepherdstown. It is possible that I may have to cross the river to the north side, should the enemy cross. I have not yet captured prisoners from any but Kershaw's division, of Longstreet's corps, but there is no doubt of General Anderson, who is temporarily in command of that corps, being here. I have not heard from General Grant for three or four days. Have you anything from him?

The movement of the enemy toward Shepherstown yesterday amounted to nothing. It did not disturb me nor cause me to make any changes, except to send one division of cavalry to Antietam Creek, on the north side. No attempt was made to cross the ford, although it was left open for the enemy. They must have retired to the vicinity of Charlestown. Averell reports cavalry in the vicinity of Williamsport and an attempt to cross; but no serious effort was made. This evening General Crook made a dash and drove in their heavy line of skirmishers on the left, and Colonel Lowell took advantage of it to make a cavalry charge, capturing seven officers and sixty-nine privates of Kershaw's division. Among the officers is one lieutenant-colonel. I think I can manage this affair. I have thought it best to be very prudent, everything considered.

The enemy left my front last night, falling back to Smithefield or Middleway. We captured 101 prisoners yesterday, and inflicted a loss of 150 killed and wounded. There have been a few feints to cross the river by cavalry at Williamsport, but there was no strength shown. The indications to-day are that they will fall back out of the Valley.
