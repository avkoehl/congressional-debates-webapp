We have got back most of stage stock. I fee considerable anxiety about these Indians west of mountains, and watch closely for further developments. Stages run regularly.

FORT LEAVENWORTH, May 26, 1865.

Major General JOHN POPE:

Referring to your dispatch to Colonel Potter about 200 ponies for General Sully, I do not think that they would be of any use to him. I can issue them to troops stationed at posts that have no long marches, where they can be recuperated and made of service. It is impossible for them to make any campaign in their present condition. Am ready to send them to General Sully on first boat, if you think best. Please answer.

G. M. DODGE,

Major-General.

HEADQUARTER MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSOURI,

May 26, 1865-4. 12 p. m.

General DODGE,

Fort Leavenworth:

The brigade of Michigan cavalry en route from Washington will go to you direct. The brigade now here is being rapidly mounted, orders to that effect having come from Washington. They also will be sent by regiments as fast as mounted. You can send what are necessary to Utah. With 5,000 good cavalry in addition be necessary to make rapid cavalry expeditions against them. I hope in the course of a week to have these 5,000 additional cavalry at Leavenworth.

JOHN POPE,

Major-General.
