CAPTAIN: A deserter, just sent in from the Second Cavalry DIVISION, from the Sixth MISSISSIPPI Infantry, Adams' brigade, Loring's DIVISION, Stewart's corps, reportss as follows: Loring's and Walthall's DIVISIONS were in Garrard's front, near Hardshell Church, yesterday about three miles distant. Captain McIntyre, Fourth U. S. Cavalry, charged within three-quarters of a mile of teir DIVISION yesterday, driving in an Alabama regiment. The DIVISION of Loring and Walhthall moved at 7 o'clock this morning to the right of Lost Mountain in the direction of Blue Mountain. The rebel sick were ordered to Blue Mountain from Palmetto, and the general impressin throughout the rebel army is that Hood is to retire to Blue Mountain and draw supplies from Selma and Talladega. French's DIVISION, of Stewart's corps, attacked Allatoona yesterday. The deserter does not know whether they were accompanied by other infantry, but thinks only cavalry co-operated with French.

I am, captain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

HDQRS. CHIEF OF CAVALRY, DEPT. OF THE CUMBERLAND,Burnt Hickory and Marietta Road, October 6, 1864.

Captain L. M. DAYTON, Aide - de - Camp:

CAPTAIN: The Seventh-second Indiana Mounted Infantry, Captain Thompson commanding, has returned from Acworth and reports the railroad destroyed two miles this side Big Shanty and above Acworth, not as effectually as the road below Atlanta; many of the ties not burnt and many rails not injured. From two of our men, captured and paroled, he learned that the rear guard of Armstrong's brigade left Acworth this morning about 8 o'clock for the direction of Dallas. The troopss at Big Shanty and Acworth were captured; a train of cars escape to Allatoona. Loring's and French'ss DIVISION went to Allatoona; said to have lost about 500 men when repulesed. The squadron sent to Allatoona has not returned. Captain Thomson is of opinion that is could not have gone beyond Acworth until this morning on account of the force of the enemy there and could not return by this time on account of the roads. From citizens Captain Thomson learned that the enemy contemplated crossing the Etowah for Kingston to destroy the railroad; that the supplies of the enemy were limited, principally parched corn and cape. I have ordered General Garrard, with his DIVISION, to New Hope Church, and to send back information as to the movements of the enemy.

I am, captain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. L. ELLIOTT,

Brigadier General and Chief of Cavalry, Dept. of the Cumberland.
