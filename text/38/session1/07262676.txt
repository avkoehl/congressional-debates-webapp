fbad, and bar, showing the quantities imported,
the cost in England, and the cost in this country
in depreciated paper, with duties, freight, and
importer's profits superadded. I omit insurance
and other minor charges of importation. I take
"Chfe importations of 1861 as the basis of my cal-
culations. because I have not at hand the impor-
tations of later years. The-principles upon which
the demonstrations are made apply to the impor-
* tatidn of all years. My calculations are also based
uppn gold at the rate of §160 in the depreciated
"paper currency of the United States. The rates
of .duty are those of the tariff of 1862, without
"adding .thereto the 50 per cent, on those rates of
f-thq recent law-, and without adding the increase
"pfbposed by the present bili. I take these dif-
ferent Itinds of iron because the specific duty re-
quired" to be paid upon each of them can easily be
reduced to the ad vaZormstandard. Also, forthe
purpose of economizing in figures, I will call the
rate of exchange between England and this coun-
try TO percent, instead of 74, which will be more
favorable to the manufacturer.

, Thus, when this quantity of iron, with its ori-
' ginal cost, difference of exchange, freight, and
duties paid, is offered in the marketof theUmtcd
States iteostfj #1,685,301. Atthatpointit comes
in competition with the'productof the home man-
ufacturer ;consequently nis protection,or bounty,
is the difference between the ftaet cost and the cost
when the foreign'iron enters into competition with
him m the home market.
Let us see what that protection or bounty is:

After all expenses of importation are added,
the cost in the wholesale market of the different
kinds of iron would be as follows: Pig iron,
39,538 tons, $1,685,301; equal to §46 17 per ton.
Railroad iron, 63,140 tons, $5,385,773; equal to
$55 85 per ton. Bar iron,83,984 tons, $9,303,858;
equal to #110 78 per ton.
Below 1 give the quotations in the Boston
wholesale market, reported in the Boston Courier
of March 7, 1864. In that paper of the same
date gold is quoted at 158= to 169; exchange on
England, sixty days, 73 to 74:
" Enqllsli common, $110 to $115; English refined, $120
to $')25; English sheet, 7 to B-i cent«; Russia sheet, 21$
to 25 cents; Jartslierrie, $50 to $52; No. 1, other biamls,
$50 to,$D2; American No. 1, $48 to $50. 
Thus showing that my calculations are correct.
Whole quantity of pig iron produced in the
United States in 1860 is 884,474 tons. Value of
884,474 tons of pig iron at $14 per ton, the cost
in England is $12,382,636.
Value of the same in our market, at $46 17 per ton,
is $40,735,164

Average value.
Thus the cost of importation, namely, the first
cost in England, difference of exchange, freight,
and duties, reduced to the paper standard, and
profits of importers, enables the home manufac-
turer to realize $48,094,548 on a manufacture of
$2G,489,302, or 180percent.!
In these calculations I have embraced only three
descriptions of iron. The importation of iron in
all forms amounts to millions in value more,
which comes in competition with the home man-
ufacture of similar description of articles. Thus
my calculation fails to give all the enormous profits
realized by the home manufacturer on the article
of iron.
In order to pay those exorbitant profits to tho
iron manufacturers, labor and capital employed
in other pursuits of industry must necessarily be
taxed in corresponding proportion.
" But we must have revenues. The warmust
not suffer for the want of money," says some
one with more zeal than reflection. Now, will '
some adept in figures please inform me what pro- •
portion of this immense sum of $48,094,548 real-
ized by the home manufacturer on iron goes into
the Treasury to support the war and pay the ex-
penses of the Government? The whole revenue
of the tariff on all articles is not much greater.
The truth is, the revenue is not only lessened, the
Treasury defrauded, and the people deluded by
this clamor for bounties, but, by oppressive and
unjust discrimination, one class waxes fat and
rich out of the labor and means of another.
If, then, this amount does not go for revenue,
but is for most part a bounty paid to tho manu-
facturer by every consumer of iron in all its mani-
fold shapes and uses, how can an increase of tho
duties on iron as proposed by the bill now before
the House, be justified? On pig iron alone tho
duty is increased by this bill from six to nine dol-
lars per ton; on railroad iron nearly in the same
ratio, and on bar iron much more; and still the
iron masters clamorfor more. Does their clamor
proceed on the principle laid down by Dr. Way-
land—Political Economy, page 147—that " when
once a duty is imposed for the protection of a par-
ticular branch of manufactures it is not long be-
fore home competition begins, ruin threatens, and
a larger protective duty is demanded?" Or is tt
because these iron cormorants, having tasted the
sweets of inordinate gain, place no limit upon their
insane greed? If I should fix the price of gold at
190 instead of 160, if I should add the recent 50 per
cent, increase of the tariff to this protective bounty,
or the increase proposed by the present bill, 1 would
be justified in fixing the average tax which the con-
sumer pays to the manufacturer at over 200 per
cent, on all kinds of iron! Nor would our people
then wonder that whereas they once bought all ar- '■
tides into which iron enter at small prices, these \
articles are now enormously enhanced in price. Of
course such articles as are increased in price by
the increased value of the labor put on them, and
into which little iron and more labor enters as an
element of cost, are double their old prices. A
hatchet which before the tariff of l§62and the paper
money system, cost twenty-five cents/now cost a
