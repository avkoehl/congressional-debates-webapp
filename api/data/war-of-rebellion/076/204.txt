HEADQUARTERS FOURTEENTH ARMY CORPS,In the Field, July 20, 1864.

Brigadier General R. W. JOHNSON,

Commanding First Division, Fourteenth Army Corps:

The major-general commanding directs that if General Geary throws his right forward and enables you to do so, you will relieve a portion of General Baird's left, so as to enable him to strengthen his right brigade, which is much in need of it. He desires that you have two brigades in line and one in reserve, at the same time affording General Baird all the assistance in the manner indicated.

HEADQUARTERS FOURTEENTH ARMY CORPS,July 20, 1864.

Brigadier General A. BAIRD:

The major-general commanding has directed General Johnson to afford you all the assistance possible. He deems the interval between Colonels Walker and Este of no importance whatever.

Very respectfully, &amp;c.,

A. C. McCLURG.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE CUMBERLAND,July 20, 1864-3 p. m.

Major General JOSEPH HOOKER,

Commanding Twentieth Army Corps:

Major-General Palmer reports that he is waiting for your troops to advance before he can move. If this report is correct I wish you to push forward your command at once. General Newton has advanced his division and now occupies the ridge taken by his skirmish an hour since, and is now about to advance his skirmish line again.

Very respectfully, your, &c.,

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS TWENTIETH ARMY CORPS,July 20, 1864-3.30 p. m.

Major-General THOMAS,

Commanding Army of the Cumberland:

GENERAL: Your not of 3 p. m. just received. My lines are on the road due east and west, which I pointed out to you this morning. General Palmer's extreme left connects with it, but his right falls away to the rear and affords me, little or no protection. Major-General Palmer can scarcely understand where my line is-or his own, if he makes that statement.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOSEPH HOOKER,

Major-General, Commanding.
