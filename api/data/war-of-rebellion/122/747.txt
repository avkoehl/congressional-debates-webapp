proportion for the authorized strength of the infantry and cavalry. The President should have the power to increase the number of guns in each battery and to mount others as the exigencies of the service might require.

As a portion of the artillery is mounted, the pay and allowances of all mounted officers and men of the corps should be the same as in the cavalry, grade for grade.

Taking the present strength of the artillery as a basis, the proposed organization would be as follows:

Staff: 1 brigadier-general of artillery, 6 colonels, 6 lieutenant-colonels, 12 majors, 6 adjutants (first lieutenants), 6 quartermasters (first lieutenants).

Two of the field officers to be appointed inspectors of artillery, with the rank of colonel.

Platoon "out of ranks:" 6 sergeants-major, 6 commissary- sergeants, 6 quartermaster-sergeants, 18 clerks (6 as sergeants, 6 as gunners); total, 34 [36].

Band: 1 master (pay and allowances of lieutenant), 1 sergeant (pay of sergeant), 2 gunners, 36 members; total, 40.

Sixty batteries, each battery composed as follows:

Horse artillery would require 12 men and 72 horses more on the war establishment. The same number of officers and men would be required in all the batteries, mounted and foot. Horse artillery in war 6 pieces, mounted batteries 6 or 8 pieces, 1 staff sergeant. Quartermaster-sergeant not needed in foot batteries.

Effective strength of the artillery in peace: One brigade- general, 36 field and staff, 60 captains, 180 lieutenants (battery officers), 34 platoon out of ranks, 40 band, 80 staff sergeants, 240 sergeants, 480 gunners, 80 mechanics, 240 artificers, 120 buglers, 3,360 cannoneers. Total, officers, 277; enlisted men, 4,674.

A school of application and practice will be required. No organization is here proposed, but the school should be for the engineers and artillery, and, if the ordnance retains its lieutenants, for the ordnance also.

Respectfully submitted.

HENRY A. HUNT,

Colonel and Aide-de-Camp.
