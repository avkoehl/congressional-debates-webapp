mail, of any Province, State, or country having
the privilege authorized to be granted in and by
the next preceding section, shall, while in the ter-
ritories of the United States, be deemed and taken
to be a mail of the United States, so far as to make
any violation therefor, any depredation thereon,
or any act or offense in respect thereto, or any
part thereof, which would be punishable under the
existing laws of the United States, in case the same
had been a mail or part of a mail of the United
States, an offense of the same grade, and punish-
able in the same manner, and to the same extent,
as though the said mails were those of the United
States; and in any indictment for such act or of-

expedient, and with one or more suitable postage
stamps, with such device and of such denomina-
tion and value as he may direct, printed or im-
pressed thereon, which envelopes shall be sold at

near as may be, with the addition of the value or
denomination of the postage stamps so printed or
impressed thereon or attached thereto as aforesaid;
and letters, when inclosed in such envelope, with
postage stamps printed or impressed thereon, (the
postage stamp or stamps in every such case being
of the value, denomination,oramount required to
prepay the postage which would be chargeable on
such letters and envelopes if sent by mail to the
place of their destination under the provisions of
the laws then in force, and such stamps and en-
velopes not having been before used,) shall pass
in the mails as prepaid letters; and all letters in- .
closed in such envelopes as shall be provided and
furnished by the Postmaster General, as first in
this section prescribed, and with postage stamps

thereof under any existing law; Provided, That

missions allowed at such office for the year ending
on the thirtieth day of June, one thousand eight
hundred and fifty-one, such compensation, in ad-
dition to his legal commissions, as will, in the

the compensation of other postmasters in the same
section of the country whose labors are the same
as his, and who are entitled to an additional allow-
ance under the sixth section of the act entitled
"An act to reduce and modify the rates of postage
in the United States, and for other purposes,"

sentatives oj the United States of America in Congress
assembled, That no license, register, or enrollment,
under the provisions of this or the act to which
this is an amendment shall be granted, or other
papers issued, by any collector to any vessel pro- j
pelied in whole or in part by steam, and carrying
passengers, until he shall have satisfactoiy evi-
dence that all the provisions of this act have been
fully complied with; and if any such vessel shall
be navigated, with passengers on board, without
complying with the terms of this act, the owners
thereof and the vessel itself shall be subject to the
penalties contained in the second section of the act
to which this is an amendment.
Sec. 2. And be it farther enacted, That it shall be
the duty of the inspectors of the hulls of steamers,
and the inspectors of boilers and engines, appoint-
ed under the provisions of this act, to examine and
see that suitable and safe provisions are made
throughout such vessels to guard against loss or
dangerfrom fire; and no license or other papers on
any application shall be granted if the provisions
of this act for preventing fires are not complied
with, or if any combustible material liable to take
fire from heated iron, or any other heat generated
on board of such vessels in and about the boilers,
pipes, or machinery, shall be placed at less than
eighteen inches distant from such heated metal
or other substance likely to cause ignition, unless
a column of air or water intervenes between such
heated surfaceand any wood or other combustible
material so exposed, sufficient at all times and
under all circumstances to prevent ignition; and
further, when wood is so exposed to ignition, as an
additional preventive, it shall be shielded by some
incombustible material in such manner as to leave
the air to circulate freely between such material
and the wood; Provided, however, That when the
structure of such steamers is such, or the arrange-
ment of the boilers or machinery is such that the
requirements aforesaid cannot without serious in-
convenience 01- sacrifice be complied with, inspect-
ors may vary therefrom if, in their judgment, it
can be done with safety.
Sec. 3. And be it further enacted, That every
vessel so propelled by steam, and carrying passen-
gers, shall have not less than three double-acting
forcing pumps, with chamber at least four inches

hand; one whereof shall be placed near the stern 
one near the stem and one amidship; each having
a suitable well-fitted hose, of at least two thirds
the length of the vessel, kept at all times in perfect
order, and ready for immediate use; each of which
pumps shall also be supplied with water by a pipe
connected therewith, and passing through the side
of the vessel so low as to be at all times in the
water when she is afloat: Provided, That in steam-
ers not exceeding two hundred tons measurement,
two of said pumps may be dispensed with, and
in steamers of over two hundred tons, and not
exceeding five hundred tons measurement, one of
said pumps may be dispensed with.
Sec. 4. And be it further enacted, That every
such vessel carrying passengers shall have at least
two good and suitable boats supplied with oars,
in good condition at all times for service, one of
which boats shall be a life-boat made of metal,

safe sea-boat, capable of sustaining, inside and

teen hundred tons measurement, shall have six
life-boats; all of which life-boats shall be well fur-
nished with oars and other necessary apparatus:
Provided, however, The inspectors are hereby au-
thorized to exempt steamers navigating rivers only
from the obligation to carry the life-boat herein
provided for, more than one, the same being of
suitable dimensions, made of metal, and furnished
with all necessary apparatus for use and safety;
such steamers having other suitable provisions for
the preservation of life m case of tire or other
disaster.
Sec. 5. And be it further enacted, That every
such vessel carrying passengers shall also be pro-
vided with a good life-preserver made of suitable
material, and float well adapted to the purpose, for

accessible places in such vessel and in readiness
for the use of the passengers; and every such ves-
sel shall also keep twenty-five buckets and fife
axes; and there shall be kept on board every such
vessel exceeding five hundred tons measurement,
Duckets and axes after the rate of their tonnage,
as follows: On every vessel of six hundred tons
measurement, five backets and one ax; for each
one hundred tons measurement, decreasing this
proportion as the tonnage of the vessel increases,
so that any such vessel of thirty-five hundred tons,
and all such vessels exceeding the same, shall not
be required to keep but three buckets for each one
hundred tons of measurement, and but one ax for
every five buckets.
Sec. 6. And be it further enacted, That every
such vessel carrying passengers on the main or
lower deck shall be provided with sufficient means
convenient to such passengers for their escape to

marked as aforesaid, on board of any steam-vessel
carrying passengers, shall be deemed guilty of a
misdemeanor, and punished by a fine not exceed-
ing one thousand dollars, or imprisonment not
exceeding eighteen months, or both.
Sec. 9. And be it further enacted, That instead
of the existing provisions of law for the inspection
of steamers and their equipment, and instead of

the present mode of employing engineers on board
the same, the following regulations shall be ob-
served, to wit: The collector or other chief officer
of the customs, together with the supervising in
spector for the district, and the judge of the district
