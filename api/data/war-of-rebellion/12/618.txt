Numbers 3. Report of Captain Richard Arnold,

Fifth U. S. Artillery, Chief of Artillery.

SIR: I have the honor to submit the following report of the movements of the artillery brigade, of General Franklin's division, from Sunday, the 4th instant, up to the disembarkation at the head of York River, opposite West Point, as well as the part it performed during the action which took place on the 7th instant:

An order was received at 10 o'clock on the 4th instant to embark the artillery at Poquosin River for Yorktown.
