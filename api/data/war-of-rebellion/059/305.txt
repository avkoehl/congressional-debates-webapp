take his place, but in the mean time do not know where to send Hurlbut. How would he do to command at Charleston during Gillmore's absence?

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

NASHVILLE, TENN., April 9, 1864. [Received 6 p.m.]

Lieutenant-General GRANT,

Culpeper:

Your dispatch of yesterday is received. I have Stoneman now in East Kentucky with all the cavalry of the Army of the Ohio. General Schofield's troops are at Bull's Gap, and I have no indications of an invasion of Kentucky from Pound Gap. That road is very long and very bad. Forrest will escape us. Veatch went to Waverly and came away without orders, because he could hear nothing of Forrest.

We will want a bolder man than Hurlbut at Memphis. Why not send Buell?

Should any force come into East Kentucky could it not be checkmated by a comparatively small force sent to the mouth of Big Sandy to march by Louisa and Prestonburg? In the mean time I am collecting everything with General Schofield, Generals Thomas and McPherson to act offensive south of the Tennessee.

I will continue to draw here all detachments and furloughed men. I am also endeavoring to accumulate surplus stores to the front, which would enable me to move troops rapidly by railroad.

McPherson's two divisions will soon begin to arrive at Cairo from their furloughs.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.

CULPEPER, Va., April 9, 1864-10.30 p.m.

Major-General SHERMAN:

I have no objection to your proposed march of A. J. Smith across from Grenada. All I want is all the troops in the field that can be got in for the spring campaign. I do not think any more generals will be sent to you want Milroy, McCook, or Crittenden.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

NASHVILLE, TENN., April 9, 1864-10.30 p.m. [Received 12.50 p.m., 10th.]

Lieutenant-General GRANT,

Culpeper:

Your letters of April 4 are this moment received, and suit me exactly. I will write fully. All is well with me, and I will be on time, anyhow.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.
