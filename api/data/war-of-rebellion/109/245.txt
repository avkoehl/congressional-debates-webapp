GENERAL: The change of organization made by Special Field Orders, Numbers 35, will render it necessary that your headquarters should be near mine. I shall move in a day or two to the vicinity of Grier's house, and whenever you change I think it should be in that direction. If General Buell's forces can cross Lick Creek I shall direct them to move south of Monterey, which will make the center of the advance near Grier's.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. W. HALLECK,
