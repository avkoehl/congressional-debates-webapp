and in reply I have to inform you that all the prisoners at Fort Delaware were [recently] ordered from the front to a point on James River to be exchanged. About the time of their denature, a week ago, I noticed in the papers a statement that 400 or 500 had been released on their taking the oath of allegiance and your brother may have been among the number.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
