Hold Resaca to the death. I will send you re-enforcements by cars, and will come up.

General RAUM,

Resaca:

Have as many bridges finished for our use as you can be to-morrow morning; also gain all possible intelligence of the movements of the enemy; ascertain if Snake Creek Gap be held in force or not, and generally everything that will enable me to arrive at a correct judgment. Try and get a messenger through the mountains with as much verbal intelligence as possible of our movements. I will try and get through to-day.

Colonel DEAN,

Kingston:

Hold fast all supplies and guard them well until we know exactly what course things take. Don't send the cars until you give time for the troops to reach Adairsville. It will be morning, I suppose, before they reach there, thought I will order General Howard to push a DIVISION to-night. Keep me well advised, and ask General Raum to do the same. I have already caused their cavalry to be driven below Coosaville, capturing two guns, and have no doubt the columns now out will disturb Hood. I want him to be held at Resaca until I get there, though I suppose he will succeed or be off.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.

Colonel DEAN:

General Howard was just here and says he left at Kingston for Resaca two large regiments, amounting to 1,000 men. Did General Raum take them, and where are they? If at Kingston, send them in the cars to-night. General Howard promises one DIVISION of near 4,000 men at Adairsville, so you may order cars. General Stanley marches on the Calhoun road. Turn cattle and everything for us up toward Resaca.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.
