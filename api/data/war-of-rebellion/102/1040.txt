Omaha:

I have telegraphed Major Almstedt to meet You at Loup Fork. If he does have no delay over one day and night for payment, as You are over a week behind the time You should have started. Why did You not get Your quartermaster's stores when You left here? I gave orders that You should go fully supplied.
