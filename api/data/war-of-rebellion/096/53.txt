CITY POINT, VA., January 6, 1865

Major-General HALLECK,

Chief of Staff of the Army:

On mature reflection I am of the opinion the purchase of horses should be renewed in the East, and that all the horses that can be got elsewhere between this and spring ought to be purchased. If we can start out in the spring with a reserve of 20,000 or 30,000 spare cavalry horses they will be worth as much to us as that number of veteran troops. The resources in the South in that respect are now about exhausted. If we can keep the enemy's cavalry on the move we will soon wear them out, and be able to ride over their whole country comparatively unmolested. I would say let purchases be resumed, and collect all the cavalry horses possible between this and next April.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

Lieutenant-General GRANT,

City Point:

Will you not ask Mr. Stanton to give me a command against Wilmington? I will take Fort Fisher, or leave my bones on the sand.

The only information of any direct importance elicited is that two brigades from Gordon's and Pegram's divisions moved south a few days ago; destination unknown. The brigades are said to be Evans' and Lewis' which are Gordon's and Hoke's old brigades, of Early's old division. Information from City Point as follows;

Refugees from north side of James report troops passing through Richmond going south day before yesterday; thought to be Kershaw's division.
