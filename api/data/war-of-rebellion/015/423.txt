Barker was killed by my men on the Valley River, near the railroad. My men were in three squads; they were commanded by one captain, two sergeants, and two corporals. They also killed Ashcraft. Barker made a prisoner of one of my men, who was sick at his home, and took him to Ashcraft's house. They also killed one Kaufman, who belonged to Righter's gang.

These men all belonged to Righter's company. My men were piloted and assisted by the Boothsville Home Guards. The Home Guards killed a man in Boothsville whom I know nothing of .
