among them, except ng a few of the followers of
that ingenious politician who had recently invented
a mode by which these oppjsed to the bank on
constitutional grounds tan consistently vote for a
rechaiter of that institution, and a few disappointed
old Feudalists who ciept into the Democratic
ranks for the sake of office These, said Mi P,
are the individuals who are following in the wake
of their leaders, and respondmg to the mflimma-
tory panic s] eeches of Consist by pissing
distress resolutions at public meetings, foi the pur-
pose of influencing the action of this House The
question be'bie the people of the United State" is
the same now, said Mr P , that it has been evei
since the adoption of the Constitution, between
tne Federal is's and República! s—between the Ana-
tocracy and Democracy—between tnose itho aie
in favor of enlarging the powers of the Geneial
Government, by implication, and those who aie
for confining it within the limits prescribed by the
Constitution Gentlemen might disguise it as they
would, that, he said, was the real state ot the
question In answer to the second íntei-osato.y,
*• Do they believe good or evil is to come of it>"
Mr. P said that it their representatives did not
violate the trust reposed in them, and forfeit the
confidence of the people who sent them theie, by
voting for a restoiation of the deposites, and a
lerharter of the bank, they believed that the great
cause of the " ml" would expire by limitation,
and that " good" would eventually " come of it "
Mr P read fiom the same paper the following
interrogatories.
" Do they, or do they not feel that something ia
' wrong, in relation to the money operations of the
' country > Do they, or do they not feel that a
' blow has, from some quarter or othei, fallen upon i
' and paralyzed their best m'erests > Do they tiace
' the fall in price, and stagnation m the operations
' of the great staple of our country, to any pa"-
' Ucular cause, and if so, what is it}"
The people of Mississippi (said Mr P ) do be-
lieve that something is legally and rnoral'y wrong
m relation to the moneyed operations of the coun-
try, and that wrong, they believe, consists in de-
stroying private ciedit,driving thegold and silver
outof the country, and collecting the loanable cap-
ital at one point, and placing it under the control
of the Bank of the United State*.—an institution
exempt by law from liabilities to which individuals
are subject—a coiporation clothed with powers
lepugnant to the fundamental principles of a repub- I
iican Government—a moneyed monopoly upon
which exclusive privileges have been conferred by
charter, and an aris'cratic institution, under no i
moral obligations, which respects the laws and
public opinion only so far as is necessary to pro-
mote its own interest The demociacy of that I
State (continued Mr P ) do believe that a blow
has fallen upon and paralyzed 'heir best interests,
and that there is a stagnation of business, and fall I
in the price of the s'aple of the ccurtry He said,
however, that they did not trace the cpuse to the
Secretary of theTreasury, nor to the President of
the United States, but to the ev's of the banking
system They did not beheve that the mere trans-
fer of eight millions of dollars from one bark to
another could cause such distress, and affect the
price of cotton The bright and cheering prospect
a few months ago, described in the resolutions,
was, he said, owing to the extensive accommoda-
tions of the bank during the past year The effect
of bank papei, every one would admit, was to
di ive the gold and silvei out of the country. Ex-
perience had demonstrated that specie and paper
money could not circulate togethei As long as
the bank continued to extend its discounts, money,
or that which represented money, was plenty, and
the country apparently in a prosperous condition
When the bank curtailed its discounts, the system
contracted, and the pressure on the community
was in proportion to the curtailment This (said
Mr. P ) is the effect of the whole system, and the |
necessary consequence of banking operations
What (inquired Mi P ) weie the facts' In the
short peuod of sixteen months, pnoi to the fi-st
day of May, 1830, the bank extended its loans
from forty-two to seventy millions of áo'lais,being (
an increase of tw enty-eight ímlhons, a mi eh higer ,
amount of loins than wis ever made by trie bink I
withm the same peuod, since the granting of its
charte1"                                                                           '
This extension of the bank (said Mr P )made
" money plenty, "caused a sadden rise m the prices
of cotton pnd the staple commodities, and thecoun
try wasnnparently in a prospeiouscord non Dn
"is; the months ot August and Septembei ]pst, the
bank curtailed its loans four mil'ions sixty-six
thousand one hundred and forty-six dollars, while
thei e was an increase of the public Jeposites,dunng
that period, of tworri'lions two hundred andsix'y
eight thousand five hundred and four dollars In
the short, peuod of two months ihe enorn.ous sum
of six millions tnree hundied and thirty <bur thou-
sand s x hundred and fifty dollars was withdrawn
by the B rk of the United Sta'es from the buta
ness of (he country This rima.lment of its loans
and connection of its lbsues, (said Mr P ,) was
what caused the price of cotton to fall, and brought
pecuniary disfess on the coun'ry The contrac-
tion, he said, had been >n fact gr ater than hehad
nsmed TI e pol cy adopted by the United States
Bank compelle I the Sia'e batiks to curtail in equal
proportion Such «as ine extraordinary power
of that institution over, not on'y a portion of the
commum y, but the State banks, and the whole
curiency of the country Witnout, however,
entering into an argument at that time on the sub-
ject, he begged leave to sta'e one fac*, which he
considered conclusive on that point Whether
the bank was or was not compelled to pursue tha*
course in self-defence, all the combined powers of
the Nationals, Nullifiers, and Bank party put to-
gether, could not, he said, induce the mtelbgen*
people of Mississippi to believe that there would
have been any distress or pre&bure in the money
inaiket, at this time, tf theie had been no Bank < f
the United States That position admitted, (and
no man could deny it,) it followed as a necessary
consequence that the evil must be traced to the
bank, and not to the execu'ive branch of the Gov-
ernment
" Do they believe that the action of the execu-
' t ve branch of Government in lelation to the
'United States Bank, the removal of the public
' deposites from, and itsdeclaied hostility to, this
' institution, has or has not had an effect upon ti e
' present state of tl ings ''' To this, the last inter-
rogatory, (said Mv P ,) this wi iter had in the same
commumc uion (by mistake,lie piesumed) fur-
nished a full and satisfactory answer " If the
' amount of deposites (says the letter writer) had
' been cast into tneocean,oi disposed of in any way,
'leaving the bank the full enjoyment of its chartered
' rights and privileges, its action uninfluenced by
' hostility towards it on the partof the Executive,
' things would have gone on well; and if it had
' been the sense of the nation that it should have
•died a natural death, its existence would have
' terminated, with its constitution or charter, with
' out a shiiggle, and without affecting the body
' politic in winch it had figured as thegreat moder-
' ator of the currency of the countiy " Here
(spid Mr B ) is an admission made by this bank
advocate which overturns every argument adduced
to show that the present disti ess in the country is
produced by the action of "my old friend the
Gmeral," (as this letter wr'ter calls him,) and not
by the voluntary and malic ous conduct of *he
bank Mark his words " If the amount of the
'deposites had been cast into the ocean, thngs
' ibould haie go-ne on ttell '"—that is, the mere re-
moval of the deposites would no' have caused any
distress in the country, if th  bank had not sought
to íevenge itself on the people, foi a supposed
lpjuiy done to the institution, by the Secietaiy of
the Ti easury, by contiaetmg its issues, and there-
by causing umveisal distress n all classes of
society throughout the land, that, but for this
sp'rit of íevenge, aroused into action by tne pre-
tended hostility of the Executive, "the existence
' of the bank would have terminated with its char
' ter, without effecting the body-politic, and that
'it would have died a natural death, wi'hout a
•btruggle," notwithstanding the removal of the
deposites When it comes to the test, this (said
Mr P ) is -what thev all a>-e bound to admit. But
the pubhc moneys were not enst into the ocean,
they-were not thrown away, they were not locked
up in the strong box of the Government, for the
purpose of oppressing thepeople, they weie placed
in the State banks, foi the accommod*£>uon of the
community
Mr   P   said he did not claim the light of aa-
vismg or lectunng his honorable colleague, for
whom he entertained the kindest of feelings, but
the character of the State was suffering under
chaigesand imputations which hehad been instru-
mental in bringu g about He therefore begged
leave most íespectfully to address to the House,
for the benefit of his colleague, a few observa-
tions in lelation to the sudden change of public
sentiment in Mississippi, and the hostile attitude
which that State had assumed towards the meas-
ures of the Administration, spoken of in that Hall
and elsewhere
[The Speaker reminded Mr P that it was not
in oider taspeak personally of any member of the
House
Mr Cace requested that his colleague might be
allowed to proceed, if the Chair could permit him,
without too great a violation of order, as he was
prepared to reply ]
Mr. P thanked the Chair for the timely admo-
nition, and his colleague for his polue request in
his behalf, aid begged leave most respectfully to
inform them ihat he had no intention of violating
the rules of the House, as they would have learned,
if they had been a little more patient That there
should be no dispute or misunderstanding about
I his allusions, Mr P sa.d that he would read from
the newspaper the charge against the character of
his State to which he referred.
He then read from the " Richmond Whig" as
follows-
"Mississippi—This State has assumed an at-
' tuude of decided hostility to the moon-struck
' measures of the Administration The Natchez
' Coui ler publishes a letter from Mr Cage, one of
' the Representatives of the State in Congress, an-
' nouncing his purpose of throwing off the tram-
' mels of party, and sustaining the interests of the
' oeople Judge Black, of the Senate, elected a
1 Jackson man, has taken the same decided stand,
' and in both Houses Mississippi is unanimous in
1 the course, unless Mi. Plummer bean exception,
' which the Telegraph regards as doubtful.
Mr P pronounced this siatement false. The
S ate of Mississippi has not assumed, he said,
" an attitude of decided hostility to the measuies
of the Administration." If there was any hostil-
ity on the part of that State to the Administration
on the bank question, it was not among the great
mass of the people, for he had already remarked
that they stood firmly by the Old Hero, who stood
by them in the houi of peril and danger, but it was
among those who were elected to sustain him in
his efforts to put down a moneyed monopoly,
about to enslave the people, and who had know-
ingly and wilfully violated the plighted faith of
then constituents, and forfeited the confidence re-
posed in them by the much abused people of Mis-
sissippi
Mr P referred to another article, stating that
"Mi Cage, of Mississippi, a member of the House,
elected as a triend to the Admimstiation, is a friend
no longer, but speaks loud and strong against it."
In order to explain this strange state of things, he
sa'd, he deemed it necessary for the wond to know
a few fac's that he hoped would not be consideied
entrrelj lireleiant to the subject under considera-
tion, which he understood to involve, among other
things, the question of what was puolic sentiment
in Mississippi His colleague and himself, he
said, were elected to the stations which they occu-
pied n August, 1832, immediately after the ad-
journment of the first session of the 22d Congress.
The presses in support of the Administration,
charged a distinguished Senator from that State
with being hostile to the leading measuies of the
Admimstiation One of the specifications was,
that he had voted for the bill to recharter the Uni-
ted States Bank, which the Piesident had just put
his veto upon The presses in opposition to the
Adm.mstration charged his colleague, another
Senator, with having supported the leading meas-
ures of the Administration. One of the specifica-
tions was, that he had voted against the bill to
recharter the United States Bank They were
toasted at dinners and barbecues got up for the
purpose by their respective friends and partisans—
the lines of party were distinctly drawn—every
polincian took sides—there was no equivocation
aliowec1—the people advanced boldly up to the
mark and took their stand—they took their motto
fiom the good book, " those who are not for as,
