Making public officers depositaries—Mr. Calhoun.
Senate.
A deeply momentous question, which we are now
tilled on to decide in behalf of the States of this
Union, and on our decision their future destiny
must, in a great degree, depend, so long as their
Union endure-
In comparing the relative merits of the two mea-
sures, preparatory to a decision, I shall touch very
briefly on the pnnciples and details of the bill The
iormer is well understood by the Senate and the
■country at large, and the latter has been so ably
and lucidly explained by the chairman of the com-
mittee in his opening speech, as to supersede the
necessity of further remarks on them at this stage
< í the discussion I propose, then, to limit myself
to a mere general summarj, accompanied by a
lew brief observations
The object of the bill, as I have already stated,
is to take the public funds out of the hands of the
Executive, where they have been thrown by opera-
tion of our acts, and to place them under the cus-
tody of law, and to provide for a gradual and
slow, but a perpetual, separation between the Go-
vernment and the banks It proposes to extend
the process of separating to the year 1845, receiving
during the first year of the series the notes of such
banks as may pay specie, and reducing thereafter
the amount receivable in notes one-sixth annually,
till the separation shall be finally consummated at
the period mentioned
The provisions of the bill are the most simple
and effectual that an able committee could devise
Four priHcipal receivers, a few clerks, and a suffi-
cient number of agents to examine the state of the
public funds, in order to see that ill ¡s right, at an
annual charge not exceeding forty or fifty thousand
dollars, at moot, constitute the additional officers
and expenditures reauired, to perform all the func-
tions heretofore discharged by the banks, as depo-
sitor es of the public money and fiscal agents of
the Treasury This simple apparatus will place
the public Treasury on an independent footing, and
give to the Government, at all times, a certain
command of its funds to meet its engagements, and
preserve its honor and faith inviolate If it be
desirable to separate from the banks, the Govern-
ment must have some independent agency of its
own to keep and disbuise the public revenue, and
it it must have such an agency, none, in my opi-
nion, can be devised more simple, moie economi-
cal, more effectual and sale, than that piovided by
this bill It is the necessary result of the sepaia-
tion, and to reject it, w ithout propo<= nj, i better,
(if, indeed, a uettei can be) is to reject the separa-
tion itself
I turn now to the substitute Its object is di-
rectly the reverse of that of the bill It'proposes
to revive the league of State banks, and to renew
our connection with them, winch all acknow-
ledge has contributed so much to corrupt the com-
munity, and to cicate a spmtfoi speculation, heie-
tofore unexampled in our history
The Senator in offering it, whether wiselj or not,
haQ at least acted consistently He was its advo
cate at first m 1834, when the alternative was be-
tween it and the recharter of the late Bank of the
United States He then defended it zealously and
manfully, against the fierce assaults of his present
allies, as he now defends it, when those who then
sustained him have ab mdoned the measure
Whether wisely ornot, there is something heroic in
his adnerenc , and I commend him for it, but I
fear I cannot say as much for his wisdom and dis-
cretion He acknowledged, with all others, the
disisters that have followed the first experiment,
but attributes the failure to inauspicious circum-
stances, and moists that the measure has not had a
fair trial I grant that a second experiment may
succeed, after the first has failed, but the Senator
must concede, in return, that every failure must
necessarily weaken confidence, both in the experi-
ment and the experimenter He cannot be more
confident in making this second trial, than he was
in the first, and, if I doubted the success then, and
preferred the Sub Treasury to his league of banks,
he must excuse me for still adhering to my opinion,
and doubting the success of his second trial Noi
ought he to be surprised, that those who joined him
in the first should be rather shy of trying the ex-
periment again, after having been blown into the air,
and burnt and scalded by the explosion But if the
Senator has been unfortunate m failing to secure
the co-operation of those who aided him in the first
trial, he has been compensated by securing the
support of those who «ere then opposed to him
They are now his. zealous supporters In contrast-
ing their course then and nos, I intend nothing
personal I make no charge of inconsistency, nor
do I intend t&> imply it My object is truth, and
not to wound the feelings ot any one, or any party
I know that to make out a charge of inconsistency,
not only the question, but all the material circum-
stances, must be the same A change m either,
may make a change of vote necessary, and, with a
material variation m circumstances, we are often
compelled to vary our course, m order to preserve
our principles In this case, I conce\e that cir-
cumstances, as far as the present allies of the Sena-
tor are concerned, have materially changed Then
the option was between a recharter of the late
ban.*, anda league of State banks, but now the
former is out ot the quesuon, and the option is be-
tween such a le igue and a total separation from
the banks This being the alternative, they may
well take that which they rejected in 1834, without
subjecting themselves to the charge of inconsisten-
cy, or justly exposing themselves to the imputation
of change of principle, or opinion I acquit them,
then, of all such charges They doubtless thmk
now, as th'y formerly did, of the measure which
they then oenounced and rejected, but which a
change of circumstances now compels them to sup-
port But in thus acquitting them of the charge of
inconsistency, they must excuse me, if I should
avail nrvself of the tact, that their opinion remains
unchanged, as an argument m favor of the bill—
against the substitute Ihe choice is between
them The\ aie in the opposite sea es To take
from th- one is, in ellect, to aad to me other and
any objecticn against the one, is an argument
equally strong m favor of the otner I then
do avail myself ef tneir man} powerful objec-
tions in '¿4 against the measure which this
substitute proposes now to revive I call
to my aid, and press into my seivice, every
denunciation they then uttered, and every argu-
ment they then so successfully urged against it
They, no, we (for I was then, as now, irrecon-
cilably opposed .o the measure) charged against it,
and pioved what we charged, that it placed tne
purse and the sword m the same hands, that it
would be the source of boundless patronage and
corruption, and fatal m its consequences to the cur-
rency of the country, and I now avail mj self of
these, and all other objections, then uiged b> u1-, in
as full force against this substitute, as if } ou w ere
again to rise m >our places and repeat them now,
and, of course, as so many arguments, in effect, in
favor of the bill, and on their strength I claim \our
vote m its fa\or, unless, indeed, still 'tionaei ob-
jections can be, urged against it I sa\ s ronger,
because time has proved the truth ot a 1 that w as
then said against the measure now proposed to be
íetived bj this substitute What was then pre-
diction is now fact But whatevei objections have
been, or may be, urged against the bill, however
strong they n iy appear in aigiiment, remain j et to
be tested hy the unerimg test of time and expe-
rience Whether the\ shall ever be realized, mu't
be admitted, even bv those who ma> have the great-
est confidence in them, to be at least uncertain, and
it is the i rt of wisdom and prudence, where ob-
jections aie equally strong against two measures, tj
prefer that which is yet unit led, to that which has
been tried and failed Against this corcluaiun
theie is but one escape
It may be said, that we are sometimes compelled,
m the midst of the many extraoidmary circum-
stances in which we may be placed, to preier that
which is of itself the more objectionable, to that
which is less so, because the former may moie
piobably lead, in the end, to some desired result,
than the latter To apply the principle to this
case It ma} be said that the substitute, though of
itself objectionable, is to be prefened, because it
would more probably lead to the establishment of
a National Bank than the bill, which you behe\e
to be the only certain remaely for all the disoiders
that afiect the currency,   I admit the position to be
sound in principle, but it is one exceedingly bold
and full of danger in practice, and ought never to
acted on, but in extreme cases, and where there is
a rational pros-pect of accomplishing the object ul-
timately aimed at The application, in this' case,
I must think, would be rashness itself It may be
saiely assumed that the success of either, which-
ever may be adopted, the bill, or the substitute,
would be fatal to the establishment of a National
Bank It can never put down a successful mea-
sure to take its place, and, of course, that which is
most likely to tail, and replunge the country into
all the disasters of a disordered currency, is that
which would most probably lead to the restoration
of a National Bank, and to prefer the substitute on
that account is, in iact, to prefer it because it is
the worst of the two But are you certain that ano-
ther explosion would be followed by a bank? We
have a'ready had two, and it is far more probable,
that the third w ould impress, universally and in-
delibly, on the puhlic mind, that there was some-
thing radically and incurably wrong in the system,
which w ould blow up the whole concern, National
Ban it and all
If I mav be permitted to express an opinion) I
would sa}, >ou have pursued a course on this sub-
ject unfortunate both for yourselves and country.
You are opposed both to the league of banks, and
the Sub-Treasury You prefer a National Bank;
and regard it as the only safe and certain regulator
of the currency, but consider it, for the present,
out of the question, and are therefore compelled to
choose between the other two By supporting the
substitute, vou will be held responsible for all the
m schief and disasters that may follow the revival
ot the pet bank s}stem, as it has been called, with
tne almost certain defeat of jour first and cherish-
ed cho ce and those } ou oppose will reap all the
benefits cf the power, patronage and influence,
w hich it mav place in their hands, without incur-
r ng any portion of the responsibility But that is
net all Thf sUcce-s ot the substitute would be
the defeat of the bill, w hich w ould, m like man-
ner, piace on v ou the responsibility of its defeat,
and gi\ e those } ou oppose, all the advantage of
having supported it without any of the responsibt-
hi} that would hav e belonged to it, bad it been
adopted Had a different course been taken—had
) ou joined in aiding to extend the custody of the
laws over the public revenue, m the hando of the
Executive, where your own acts have placed it,
and for which }ou, of course, are responsible,
throwing the blame at the same time on those to
whom voa attribute the present disordered state of
the currencv, the burden of the responsibility, you
w ould hai e stood íead^ to profit by events If tie
Suo-Trea^un , contrarv to jour anucipation, suc-
ceeded, is patnots, vou would ha\e cause to re-
joice in the unexpected good If it failed, you
wou d have tne credit of having anticipated the
lesult and might then, after a double triumph of
sagi'-iu and foresight, have brought forward your
favorite measuie, with a fair prospect of success,
when every other had failed By not taking this
course, you have lost the only prospect of esta-
blishing a National Bank
Nor has } our course, in my opinio , been fortu-
nate tor the countrv Had it been different, the
cuirenci question would have been decided at the
ci1 el session and had it been decided then, the
c ran y w ould this d?v have been in a much better
conditio i—at least the manufacturing and commer-
cial section to ihe North, where the derangement ot
the currenev is telt the most severely The South
is comparativeh in an easy condition
Such are the difficulties that stand in the way of
the substitute at the \ery threshold Those be-
\ ond are vastly gi eater, as I shall now proceed to
show Its obiect, as I hav e stated, is to revive the
league ot btate banks, and the first question pre-
sented foi consideration is, how is this to be done?
how ¡s the league to be formed' how stimulated
into life when formed2 and what, after it has been
revived would be the true character of the league
or combínanos To answer these questions we
must turn to its provisions
It provides that the Secretary of the Treasury
shall select twentv-live specie-pa) mg banks, as the
fiscal agents of the Government, all to be respecta-
