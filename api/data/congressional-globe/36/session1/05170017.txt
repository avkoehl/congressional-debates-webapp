APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
36tii Cong....1st Sess.
Report of the Postmaster- General.
Senabe & Ho. of ®ebs;
a distance the appearance of islands. He then
proceeded to the Island of Graham, the most im-
portant of the Marianas, a principal recruiting
station of whalers: and thence to Hong Kong,
where he arrived May 19, having, on the way,
taken repeated soundings and made many import-
ant observations.
From Hong Kong he intended to proceed to the
islands south of Japan, and thence to the coast of
Japan.
The Department, on the 1st day of May last,
made a conditional contract with the Chiriqui Im-
provement Company and Ambrose W. Thomp-
son, subjcct to the ratification of Congress, for the
purpose of securing to the United States some very
valuable privileges" in the Province of Chiriqui.
The rights proposed to be secured are:
1. A right of way or transit over the rsad-
way gi tin ted to the said Ambrose "W. Thompson
through the Province of Chiriqui, from the Ca-
ribbean sea to the Pacific ocean, free from all tolls
or taxes upon officers, agents, seamen, landsmen,
mails, munitions, stores, troops, or any direct
property of the United States which the Govern-
ment thereof may transport, or cause to be trans-
ported, over said road during the continuance of
the grant made to Mr. Thompson, for the period
of sixty years, by the Province of Chiriqui.
2. A grant of five thousand acres of land, on each
side of the Isthmus, for depots and stations for naval
purposes, to be selected at the lagoon of Chiriqui
on one side and the harbor of Golfito on the other.
3. The right to use its harbors tin1 waters of the
lagoons, bays, or gulfs, sheltered or partially sur-
rounded by the lands of the said Chiriqui Im-
provement Company, and of the said Ambrose
W. Thompson on the Atlantic and Pacific sides of ]
the Isthmus, and wherever their lands may extend.
4. The right to all the coal for naval purposes
at or near the points selected for depots and sta-
tions for naval purposes*, and if coal of superior
quality for steam purposes shall be found at other
places, the right to use the same, subject only to
the tax of one dime per ton and the cost of mining
and delivering the same.
For all these rights and privileges it is stipulated
that the United States will pay to the said Am-
brose W. Thompson, for himself and the Chiri-
qui Improvement Company, the sum of §300,000,
provided Congress, at its next session, shall ap-
prove the contract and make the necessary appro-
priation therefor; otherwise the contract to be void.
The importance of securing these privileges for
the use of the United States cannot be too highly
appreciated. A harbor on the Atlantic side of
the Isthmus, another on the Pacific side, opposite
the one to the other, both of them among the finest
and most capacious in the world, capable of re-
ceiving and sheltering at all times ships of the
largest class, and an unlimited number of them;
a depot and station, for naval purposes, at each
of these harbors; a right of transit across the Isth-
mus, from one to the other, and a supply of coal,
should it be necessary for both the Home and
Pacific squadrons, are objects of great impor-
tance to the United States, and, if attainable, ought
not to be overlooked. The title of Mr. Thomp-
son and the Chiriqui Improvement Company has
been submitted to the Attorney General o'f the
United States, and he lias expressed the opinion
that it is a good and valid title.
The bureaus, m their respective reports, to
which 1 beg leave to refer, have presented a very
satisfactory account of their transactions during
the past year, in relaLion 10 the various subjects
committed to their particular charge.
There having been no appropriation for im-
provementm the navy-yards for the present fiscal j
year, the public works of that description have ;
been suspended, and, in pursuance of the policy
adopted by Congress at its last session, no esti-
mates are presented for their continuance during
the next fiscal year, I have caused a special ex-
amination to be made of the condition of the Na-
val Asylum at Philadelphia, under the superin-
tendence of Captain W. TV". McKean, and am
highly gratified to be able to say that it is in ad-
mirable condition, under lenient but firm govern-
ment, and well adapted to secure the objects of
the institution. The agencies for the preservation
of live-oak timber belonging to the United States
have been successfully conducted, and the system
New Series—No. 2,
now established and in operation through the
present corps of agents, will, it is believed, effec-
tually secure that important object. I have caused
a thorough examination to be made of the several
Atlantic navy-yards, and have issued instructions
to all the navy-yards, establishing a uniform sys-
tem of organization and management, adapted to
insure economy, efficiency, and responsibility.
There being a great deficiency in our supply of
saltpeter, it has become necessary that an appro-
priation be made sufficient to secure an ample
supply under any contingency that might arise.
The superintendent of the Naval Observatory
recommends that a larger force be employed 111
that institution. As the appropriation for the
Nautical Almanac failed to receive the sanction
of Congress at the last session, it becomes neces-
sary that a small appropriation for "that object be
made early at the approaching session, or the
work will be arrested for want of funds to carry
it on. The supply of provisions and clothing for
the Navy received from the contractors during the
past year has been satisfactory to the officers and
men. The tables presented by the Bureau of
Medicine and Surgery afford a very satisfactory
illustration of the physical efficiency of the crews
of our public vessels, of the favorable sanitary
condition of the Navy, and of the skill and effi-
ciency of the medical corps. The Naval Labora-
tory is found to answer satisfactorily the purpose
for which it was established. The insane of the
Navy are now well taken care of in that noble
institution which the humanity of Congress has
provided in the District of Columbia.
For the support of the Navy and marine corps,
andall other objects under the control of the Navy
Department, for the fiscal year ending the 30th of
June, 1858, the estimates were ^13,803,212 77;
appiopnation, §14,240,217 27; expenditures,
§13,870,684 7G.
For the fiscal year ending June 30, 1859, the
estimates were $14,616,298 23; appropriations,
$>,14,508,354 23; expenditures, §14,659,267 76.
For the fiscal year ending June 30, 1860, the
estimates were £13,500,370 80; appropriations,
§10,464,769 55.
The estimates for the fiscal year ending June
30, 1861, are $11,244,845 63: that is to say, for
the Navy proper, $9,977,115 58; for the marine
corps, $699,736 05; and for all other objects,
$,567,994.
I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your
obedient servant, ISAAC TOUCEY,
Secretary of the Jutvy.
The President of the United States.
Keport of tlie Postmaster General.
Post Office Department,
December 3, 1859.
Sir: In th(? month of March last, the sudden
decease of my enlightened and deeply-lamented
predecessor, immediately preceded as it was by
the death of the Third Assistant Postmaster Gen-
eral—so long and so honorably connected with
the administration of the postal revenues—filled
this Department with discouragement andgloom.
Associated with this double talamity, came an-
other which awakened painful anxieties, not only
from its intrinsic magnitude, but from the fact
that the history of the Government, from its
foundation, furnished no parallel for such a dis-
aster. My allusion is, of course, to the failure
of Congress to pass the customary appropriation
bill for'the support of the Post Office Department,
whereby, with all its responsibilities resting upon
it, and the fulfillment of all its duties demanded by
the country, it was still depiived of the use of its
own revenues, and thus necessarily of all means
of complying with its engagements to the faithful
officers toiling m its service. The ordeal so un-
expectedly prepared for it was, in all its aspects,
as novel as it was perplexing, and disquieting
apprehensions were naturally felt for its result.
When, however, from high political considera-
tions, the President announced his purpose not
to convene Congress in special session, and the
full measure of the crisis was thus revealed, the
contractors and others charged with the main-
tenance of the postal administration, manifested
everywhere a determination to meet the emer-
to the transmission and delivery of the mails. 1
been performed as cordially and as faithfully,
during- the last nine months, as at any -former,
period. While, however, this is referred to with
gratification, and cannot be too warmly commend-
ed, it must not be forgotten that this fidelity, in
the midst of abandonment and privation, has cost
a numerous and deserving class of public-ser-
vants severe pecuniary sacrifices. Feeling anx-
ious that they should be relieved as far as'possible
from the embarrassments in which they were so
suddenly involved, statements evidencing the in-
debtedness of the Department to its contractors
and agents have been issued to each, in the hop.e
that, m the easy condition of the money market,
their holders might obtain advances upon :them
without serious loss. It is to be feared, however,
that those whose circumstances obliged them to
dispose of these securities have, in many cases,
been compelled to submit to a heavy discount. I
would most earnestly urge upon Congress the ne-
cessity of making an early appropriation to meet
all the existing liabilities of the Department. As
the faith of the Government lias been broken, not
only should the principal of these debts be prompt-
ly paid, but interest on them should also be al-
lowed. In many instances this may prove but
an imperfect indemnity for the damage which the
creditors of the Department have actually sus-
tained; but this much, at least, is due from the
gravest considerations of public justice and policy,
and cannot, in my judgment, he withheld With-
out national dishonor. *
