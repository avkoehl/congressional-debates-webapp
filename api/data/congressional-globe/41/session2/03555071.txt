SCHUYLER COLFAX,

George C. Gorham, esq., Secretary of the Senate.
Mr. SUMNER. Mr. Clerk, I send a resolu-

of the Senate.
The Chief Clerk. The following resolu-
tion is submitted by the Senator from Massa-
chusetts, who asks for its present consideration:
Resolved, That in the absence of the Vice Presi-
dent Hon. Henry 13. Anthony bo, and ho is horeby,

recess.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Jour-
nal of yesterday will now be read.
Mr. McDONALD. I move to dispense with
the reading of the Journal.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there
objection to dispensing with the reading of the
Journal? It requires unanimous consent. The
Chair hears no objection ; and the reading of
the Journal is dispensed with.
Mr. McDONALD. I move that at half past
four o'clock to-day the Senate take a recess
until half past seven, for the purpose of consid-
ering to-night the Mediterranean and Oriental
steamship bill.
Mr. HAMLIN. I suggest to my friend from
Arkansas that it be understood that if that bill
shall be concluded this evening we shall after-
i ward consider the bill relating to the payment
i to Maine and Massachusetts of war expenses
| in the war of 1812.
i Mr. RAMSEY. The general understand-
ing was that the Duluth bill should come up
next.
Mr. SUMNER. I hope the Senator from
Arkansas will accept the suggestion of the
Senator from Maine.
Mr. McDONALD. I will do that.
Mr. THURMAN. What is the proposition ?
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. It is moved
that at half past four o'clock to-day the Senate
take a recess uutil half past seven, for the pur-
pose of considering at the evening session the
Oriental steamship navigation bill.
Mr. THURMAN, I have no objection to
the agreement to take a recess; but I think it
is but just to my colleague to say that it is his
purpose, as he has stated to me, to ask the
Senate to sit to-night on the bill for the reduc-
tion of taxes, in case that bill shall not have
been concluded before the recess; and 1 hope
no other business will have precedence over
that to-night.
_ The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The ques-
tion is on the motion of the Senator from Ark-
ansas.
Mr. SUMNER. I understood the Senator
from Arkansas to accept the proposition that
the Massachusetts bill from the other House
be also considered to-night.
Mr. WILSON. I suppose that is all with
the understanding that we are first to finish the
tax bill.
Mr. McDONALD. That is the understanding.
Mr. MORRILL, of Vermont. I shall be
compelled to object to any business to-night,
in behalf of the Finance Committee, unless
the tax bill shall be got through with before
that time.
Mr. THURMAN. _ That bill must have pre-
cedence over everything.
Mr. MORRILL, of Vermont. Certainly.
Mr. WILSON. I think we can finish it
to-day.
Air. THURMAN. I hope so.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The order
of business is at all times within the control
of the Senate. The question is on the motion
of the Senator from Arkansas.
The Chair put the question, and declared the
motion to be agreed to.
Mr. CASSERLY. I should like to inquire
what was the motion just put and carried.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. That at
half past four o'clock to-day the Senate take
a recess until half past seven o'clock. The
Senator from Arkansas made his motion with
the view of having considered to-night the Ori-
ental steam navigation bill; but the Senator
from Vermont asked to have the question
divided, and it was divided.
Mr. MORRILL, of Vermont. No, I asked
to have the question taken, with the distinct
understanding the tax bill should be first com-
pleted. As that is the understanding on the
part of the mover, I do not object to the mo-
tion, as otherwise I should.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Chair
understood the Senator to ask for a division
of the question.
Mr. MORRILL, of Vermont. No, sir; I
was merely providing that the tax bill should
not be overslaughed.
Mr. SUMNER. What is the order for this
evening now?
Mr. POMEROY. Yes; let us have that dis-
tinctly understood.
ThePRESIDENTjpro tempore. The record
is that the Senate will take a recess from half
past four until half past seven o'clock, for the
purpose of considering to-night the Oriental
steam navigation bill.
Mr. SUMNER. And also the Massachu-
setts bill.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Chair
understands that modification to have been
accepted; but the order of business is at all
times under the control of the Senate.
Mr. CASSERLY. I am very anxious to be
allowed to move an amendment to the mo'ton
uf the Senator from Arkansas.
