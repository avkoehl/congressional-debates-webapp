Secretary of War:

My information from front is as late as 3 o'clock this evening. Reconnaissance of yesterday and this morning show the enemy still confronting General Sheridan. They had retired their pickets from the immediate front of our army, but upon crossing the Opequon Creek a heavy line of skirmishers was soon met. The movements of the enemy seem to be to our left.* General Sheridan passed Crook's corps from left to right to meet their new disposition.

So far from Early retiring, the indications are that he adheres to the purpose of holding this end of the Valley at least, if he does not propose a raid north of the Potomac.

Respectfully,

Brigadier-General.
