JACKSON, MISS., July 9, 1863.

Honorable JAMES A. SEDDON:

I have nothing official of capitulation of Vicksburg. An officer of the garrison told me that the terms were those I stated: The troops to be paroled and sent into our lines as soon as form is complied with; officers to retain baggage and side-arms; soldiers their clothing. Provisions being exhausted, the general officers proposed capitulation to General Pemberton. I have not heard of the garrison.

J. E. Johnston,

General.

Honorable SECRETARY OF WAR:

The following telegram was received by the President, and is forwarded to you for your information:

Your dispatch of yesterday received. No report of Taylor's junction has reached me, as it must have done, if true, as we have 1,200 cavalry in that vicinity. I hear nothing official from Vicksburg. Major Jacob Thompson, of General Pemberton's staff, gives me the following list: Lieutenant-General Pemberton, Major-Generals [C. L.]

Stevenson,[J. H.] Forney, M. L. Smith, and [J. S.] Bowen; Brigadier-Generals [S. M.] Barton, [S. D.] Lee, [A.] Cumming, [J. C.] Moore, [W. E.] Baldwin, [L.] Hebert, [J. C.] Vaughn, and [F. A.] Shoup; Colonels [A. W.] Reynolds, [T. N.] Waul, and [F. M.] Cockrell, commanders brigades; also Brigadier-General [John V.] Harris, of Mississippi militia.

General JOSEPH E. Johnston,

Jackson, MISS.:

To afford facilities for exchange at the earliest period, telegraph as soon as you know the number of privates, sergeants, corporals, lieutenants, captains, majors, lieutenant-colonels, colonels, brigadiers, and generals, designating as far as practicable the number of the foregoing belonging to each regiment; at any rate send the designation of the regiments captured. After full lists are prepared, you will send them on without delay, but telegraph only as above.

Secretary of War.

JACKSON, MISS., July 14, 1863.

General Pemberton has recommended that his troops be furloughed.

Should the recommendation be accepted, it will have an injurious effect
