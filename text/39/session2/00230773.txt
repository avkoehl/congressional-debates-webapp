cost, over thirty-four per cent, on'the European
cost, the American producer has a right to
ask for protection until that state of things
shall cease to exist. Now, we know that the
American manufacturer does pay more than
thirty-four per cent, advance upon European
prices, and hence he has heretofore demanded,
and not only demanded but received, a tariff
protection of fifty per cent, in^ coin, which
would make a currency protection of about
sixty-seven per cent., which being added to
the thirty-four per cent, makes about oneliun-
dred per cent., which he can afford to pay in
currency for material and labor more than the
European manufacturer pays, and yet success-
fully compete with him in the sale of his prod-
ucts. With this view of the subject it will be
seen that every advance in the price of gold
operates as a protection to the American man-
ufacturer, because it advances the rate of ex-
change, with which the foreign payment is to
be met. Every decline, therefore, in the price
of gold is tantamount to a reduction pro rata
of the tariff. Hence, with a vacillating gold
market, the manufacturer cannot thrive; he
wants permanency and stability in the stand-
ard of value. The American importer may
take advantage of a heavy decline in the gold
market, and purchase large stocks of goods
with the certainty of a future advance of gold.
Not so with the manufacturer, and especially
with him who uses American material. Neither
the raw material nor labor invariably follow the
fluctuations of gold. Gold is sensitive ; it moves
like quicksilver in the midst of more sluggish
metals.
It should cease to be a commodity of pur-
chase and sale, but should again take its place
as the standard of value. If we intend to main-
tain commercial relations with the civilized na-
tions of the world we must have their standard
of vafc.«. The old adage again enforces its
truth upon us, Ihat "being in Eome we must
yield to the customs of Rome." We cannot
compel other nations to take our paper money,
and so long as we retain it as the standard of
value among ourselves we are setting up a new,
policy in the commercial world, and have con-
stantly to struggle against established laws of
trade. So long as we maintain commercial
relations with them gold retains its value here,
subject to local influences. It will continue to
be bought and sold in our markets. Its fluctu-
ations may and perhaps will depend upon our
own legislation, upon our errors in politics and
in business. A mere rumor will put it up and
put it down. Its fluctuations cannot injure
people abroad, but they do injure ourselves.
The disease, I take it, then, consists, partially
anyhow, in the fact that there is a difference in
the nominal value of our paper money and
gold. Until that difference is removed it is
idle to talk about protecting American indus-
try. Such a thing might be if our ports were
closed against the world 5 but without it per-
fect protection cannot exist. No possible rate
of duty will be sufficient.
Our bank-note circulation at present, includ-
ing compound-interest notes and excluding
certificates of deposit, amounts to-day to more
than nine hundred million dollars. The entire
trade and commercial business of Great Brit-
ain, perhaps double our own, are conducted
with less than one hundred and ninety million
dollars of paper money. At no period of our
own history had bank issues in the United
States previous to 1860 exceeded $215,000,000.
The business of 1859 and 1860, two of the most
prosperous years in American history, ^ as
safely and expeditiously carried on with a paper
circulation of less than two hundred and eight
millions. To me it is not at all strange that,
with an inflated currency of at least three times
as much as the country needs, all species of
property maintain their present exorbitant
nominal values. Gold is the cheapest article m
the market. Itis made cheap by the desperate
exertions of our Government to commence the
payment of the public debt. Everybody talk?
of speedy resumption : the Government extorts
from an oppressed industry at least $500,000,-
000 annually, not because it is needed, bat
with the apparent view of hoardinjg coinsuffi-
cient to resume specie payments by a simple
proclamation of the fact. Gold, with its sen-
sitive nature, feels the "general inclination in
that direction, and seefe% to take its proper
place in advance of other articles. _ With the
present policy enforced by legislation, how-
ever, gold will not only be sensitive, but sensi-
ble enough to take a different position.
The thing now most needed is to relieve
industry. The heavy hand of the tax-gatherer
should be removed from the productive indus-
tries of the country. The manufacturer can-
not extend his business, because he cannot
afford to buy the machinery necessary to do so.
■ His profits largely go into the Federal Treas-
ury. If he has any remaining after the pay-
ment of excise duties he hesitates to purchase
machinery at the present exorbitant rates for
fear that his neighbor may in a few years pur-
chase similar machinery for half the money.
The machinist cannot furnish machinery for
any less price, because of the duties on iron
and steel and the high price of skilled labor.
The farmer cannot afford to sell his_ products
any cheapcr, because of the high prices enter-
ing into their growth and transportation to
market, and because, further, the tax-gatherer
stands ready to receive the Government's share
of his income.
The proposition now under consideration
instead of relieving'industry adds to its bur-
dens. The evil, I have said, is inflation. What-
ever tends to continue this state of affairs or to
make inflation a necessary condition of trade
in the future necessarily aggravates the evil.
If the present prices are maintained it requires
an inflated currency to do the business of the
country. If prices are reduced a less volume
of currency is needed. As that volume is less-
ened, so we advance to the realization of
specie payments. Until that volume is re-
duced specie payment is a myth, a thing to
be talked of by visionaries, but not by prac-
tical men. The immediate as well as perma-
nent effect of the passage of this bill will be
to increase prices, making a continuance of
inflated currency an absolute necessity. _ After
its adoption and the consequent inflation of
prices gold will rise. But men will not cease
to hope still for specie payments. Having
mistaken the true remedy is no reason the
patient should not be further dosed. The
same old treatment will be resorted to—San
grado's bleeding and hot water. _
We sluj.ll be urged still to continue the pres
ent rates of internal taxation for the pnrposeof
paying the public debt, and thereby sustaining
the public credit. In order to force our de-
preciated Government paper to par we must
make the Government rich. To make the Gov-
ernment rich we must make the people poor.
This policy will fail as it has already failed.
This bill, I-repeat, looks to increased taxation.
The people of the United States are to-day the
most heavily taxed people on earth. The na-
tional debt of Great Britain is nearly double
our own in amount. The value of real and
personal property in Great Britain is nearly
twice that of ours. The amount of taxes paid by
the English people in 1864—65 was $354,131,000.
The amount of taxes paid by the people of the
United States in 1865-66 was $561.572.266, cur-
rency value. Our people pay annually an
average of $11 46 per head in gold, while the
people of Groat Britain, with double our wealth
and means of payment, pay $10 92. _
Our true policy, in my judgment, is to post-
pone the payment of the principal of the public
debt until business shall have recovered from the
effects of a long and exhausting war; until the
cotton and sugar plantations ofthe South shall
be again cultivated, and until our natural laws
of progress in population and wealth shall make
the payment of the debt comparatively easy.
Real and personal property in the United States
increased in value from 1840 to 1850 sixty-four
per cent.; from 1850 to 1860 the increase m
value was one hundred arid twenty-nine and
seven-tenths per cent.; from 1860 to 1870, had
war not intervened, the same rate of increase
would have been near two hundred and sixty
per cent. We may well postpone, for at Teas
ten years yet the payment of a debt which can
be fully liquidated in the course of ten or fif-
teen years after we commence the work, with-
out retarding the development of a single in-
terest, and without oppression of a single indir
vidual. If we pay the interest of the debt
and keep our people rich we shall maintain
our credit and have a fund in the wealth of
the people upon which we can at any ti.me
check for the payment of our national obliga-
tions.
If my views be correct on the policy of tax-
ation, it only remains now to inquire what
amount of revenue will likely be required to
meet the expenditures of the Government,
Again we must look to the past. The dis-
bursements for the fiscal year ending June 30,
1866, as reported by the Secretary of the Treas-
ury, are as follows: .
Fur civil service      £41,055.961 5-1
For pensions of Indians  18.So2.416 91
For War Department     82
For Nary Department  43,324,118 52
For interest on debt   133,067,741 69
Total $520,750,940 48
In the items above it will be observed that
the expenses of the War Department consti-
tuted largely more than one half the entire
disbursements. That Department cannot now
cost more than say $55,000,000 annually. The
Army is reduced to about the peace establish-
ment, and if peace continues we shall have
time to look after and cut off extravagance in
the administration of every Department.
Let us take the expenditures of the first
quarter of the present fiscal year. We were
then approaching still nearer the normal con-
dition of things. It embraces the period from
June 30 to September 30, 1866 :
For civil service.   
For pensions of Indians  ll.jf87,9io 66
For War Department  13,833,214 03
For Navy Department  II
For interest  33,86 ,399 99
Total $79,258,935 29
If the expenditure of the three remaining
quarters shall correspond with this, the entire
expense for the present fiscal year, including
interest on public debt, will be $317,035,74116.
With proper economy, this amount may be
greatly reduced. Putting the interest.on the
public debt even at the estimate of the Senator
from Ohio, at $140,000,000, it would "leave
$177,035,741 16 to meet the ordinary expenses
of the Government. Taking several years pre-
ceding the war, the following table will give
the ordinary expenses of the Government:
iffic.  -. $60,533,833 45
ijtyr    65,032,569 76
105Q    72,291,119 79
tSS  ..."  66,327,405 72
iosn    60,010,112 58
lSBi:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::'  62,537,171 62
During those years the expenses of the Navy
Department averaged about $13,000,000, and
the War Department about $21,000,000. I
believe no one now estimates our ordinary ex-
penses at more than $180,000,000.. I am sat-
isfied' that by prudence and economy they
ought to be reduced to $150,000,000. But even
taking the highest estimates we shall need to
meet accruing Remands the following sums,
namely:
For payment of interest §140,000,000 in coin.
For ordinary expenditures.... 180,000,000 m currency.
I have already shown that the present tariff
yielded last year $179,046,651 58, and dur-
ing the first five months of the preheat fiscal
year it yielded $78,843,774 26, which would
give an aggregate for the present fiscal year oi. •
over $189,000,000 in coin. But suppose it
yields no more than during the last fiscal year,
it will be sufficient to pay the interest on tha
public debt and leave a surplus of $39,000,000
