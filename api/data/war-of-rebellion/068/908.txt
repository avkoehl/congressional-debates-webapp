Soldiers generally understood there was to be a move of their white army, which was stopped by some movement of ours. He is a good fellow, but a late conscript, and knows very little.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: We have some 55 to 60 prisoners from Rodes' and Early's divisions, of Ewell's corps. They represent the whole of these two divisions, and say they were marched at about 3 to 4 o'clock this p.m. with great rapidity from that part of their line which lies in the rear of the Angle where the Second Corps charged on Thursday; that they went about 4 or 5 miles before the skirmish began. Some of them think that it was supposed we had left. They were marched right through the woods, and don't know exactly where they were taken, but are mainly sent in by the heavy artillery, Colonel Kitching's, I think.

Very respectfully,

GEORGE H. SHARPE,

Colonel, &c.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,May 19, 1864-10 p.m.

General HUMPHREYS:

The prisoner from General Warren is in; is from Twenty-second North Carolina, Scales' brigade, Wilcox's division. He says that an hour before sunset the whole of A. P. Hill's corps was ordered forward on front of the Court-House, and came as far as four line of works on the hill the other side of the stream; that he knows the whole corps came, because Wilcox's division was the last; that he was thrown out in front of the skirmish line, and so captured.

Respectfully,

GEORGE H. SHARPE,

Colonel, &c.
