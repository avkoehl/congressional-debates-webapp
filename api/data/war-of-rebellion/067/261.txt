was an opportunity, the wounded of the enemy have been collected and fully cared for.

The medical directors of corps have faithfully met their responsibilities. To Surg. J. J. Milhau, U. S. Army, Surg. A. N. Dougherty, U. S. Volunteers, and Surg. S. A. Holman, U. S. Volunteers, are due especial credit for the improvement and efficiency developed in their corps. Surg. E. B. Dalton, U. S. Volunteers, who received the aggregate wounded of the army for transmission east (with Surg. A. J. Phelps, U. S. Volunteers inspector and assistant), ably directed the labors of numerous subordinates at the base of the army. Assistant medical director, Surg. J. T. Ghiselin, U. S. Army (since made medical director of the Middle Military Division), Asst. Surg. J. S. Billings, U. S. Army, and Asst. Surg. George M. McGill, of the U. S. Army, have rendered me most valuable, varied, and constant aid in the discharge of general duties assigned them and special ones that emergencies required. The ambulance service has been well and gallantly performed, and their chief officers, Captain W. F. Drum, Second U. S. Infantry, Captain B. W. Baldwin, and Captain J. G. Pelton, Fourteenth Connecticut Volunteers, deserve especial commendation.

Accompanying are reports of Medical Director Dougherty and Medical Purveyor Brinton. Reports from other medical directors of corps and chief medical officers of independent commands have not yet been received. It is deemed advisable to terminate this report with the period ending July 31, 1864, and not further delay its transmission.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

THS. A. MCPARLIN,

Surgeon U. S. Army, Medical Director, Army of the Potomac.
