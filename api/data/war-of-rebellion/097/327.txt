Lieutenant-General GRANT:

A reconnaissance on my left this morning, where it was reported the enemy had withdrawn forces, developed no change. No change observed or reported anywhere else in my front.

Major-General.

CITY POINT, March 30, 1865.

General WEITZEL:

Warren and Humphreys have pushed forward until the enemy now occupy the same position about Burgess' Mill that they did when Hancock had his battle last fall. There has been some pretty sharp fighting, but I have no details further than that the enemy were pushed back. Sheridan has driven the cavalry, and now holds the Five Forks roads. The mud is deep. In the affair of yesterday our men did handsomely. Johnson's division attacked Griffin, and were promptly repulsed. We lost forty-two killed and several hundred wounded. We buried twenty-five of enemy. The army is in fine spirits over the result.

Please tell the President that hearing that some of the enemy had gone away in front of my left, a reconnaissance was sent out this morning. It developed no change in the enemy's line. I have had a constant succession of deserters all last night and this morning. they all report no change on my front and no knowledge of our movements from this front. I will inform him of any change as soon as it occurs. I just sent to-day's Richmond papers to you. No news.
