MESSAGE FROM THE SENATE.
A message was received from the Senate, by
Mr. Pattox, one of its clerks, notifying the
House that that body had passed bills and a joint
resolution of the following titles:
An act (H. R.. No. 435) to refund to the Ter-
ritory of Utah the expenses incurred in suppress-
ing Indian hostilities in the year 1853;
An act (H.R.No.299) for the paymenlof ex-
penses incurred in the suppression of Indian hos-
tilities in the State of California; and
A joint resolution (H. R. No. 70) to quiet titles
to lands in the State of Iowa;
The first without and the others with amend-
ments, in which he was directed to ask the con-
currence of the House; and also informing the
House that the President of the United States had
notified the Senate that he had approved and
signed joint resolution (S. No. 49) to repeal the
joint resolution approved .Tune 15, 1860, for the
relief of William H. De Groot.
T1IE TARIFF AGAIN.
Mr. SHERMAN. I will not detain the House
ten minutes.
Mr. STANTON. I want the Chair to decide
my point of order. I was present when these
Senate amendments were postponed till to-day;
and I was not awaie, nor do I think the House
was, that the understanding then made super-
seded the militia bill, pieviously made the special
order for this day. My understanding was that,
at one o'clock, the tarilf biil was to be taken out of
committee, and that then the House was to pro-
ceed to the consideration of the militia bill, which
was set down for this day. If that had not been
the agreement, I certainly would have objected.
The SPEAKER. The Chair did not so under-
stand it.
Mr. STANTON. Let the Journal entry be
read. I did not understand that the tariff bill was
made the special order, it was agreed, I thought,
that we should go into committee on this bill, and
at one o'clock that the committee should rise to
proceed to the consideration of the militia bill,
set down as the special order for this day after the
morning hour. Task that the Journal on try be read.
The SPEAKER. The gentleman from Ohio
is laboring under a misapprehension. The reso-
lution adopted last Saturday went further than lie
states. In the opinion of the Chair, the under-
standing was, that the tariff bill should be reported
to the House, and considered.
Mr. MORRILL Such was the declaration of
the gentleman from Missouri, [Mr. Phelps.]
Mr. PHELPS. I had something to do with
this matter on last Saturday. I was under the
misapprehension that the militia bill reported by
the chairman of the Committee on Military Af-
fairs [Mr. Stanton] was made the special order
for to-morrow, and not for this day. My prop-
osition last Saturday was, that the amendments
of the Senate to the tariff bill should be consid-
ered in the Committee of the Whole on the state
of the Union until one o'clock; and that then,
whatever progress had been made, they should
be reported to the House, and disposed of. I
made that suggestion, which the House adopted,
without beingaware of the real condition of the
militia bill.
The SPEAKER. The recollection of the Chan-
agrees with the statement of the gentleman from
Missoui i.
Mr. SHERMAN. I will proceed, then.
Mr. PHELPS. Let me state, in justice to the
chairman of the Committee on Military Affairs,
that when I made the proposition on Saturday I
supposed, as I did until this morning, that the
militia bill would not come up until to-morrow.
Mr. STANTON. The bill 1 desire to call up
is a House bill; and these are Senate amend-
ments, which can just as well be concurred in to-
morrow or Wednesday as to-day; and I hope that
my colleague will postpone action on them until
the militia bill is disposed of. There has evi-
dently been a misapprehension and misunder-
standing, and I hope my colleague will not insist
on the consideration of the tariff bill.
Mr. SHERMAN. I will now proceed with my
remarks. Mr. Speaker, I desire, if I can m a
few minutes, to impress upon the House the ne-
cessity of concurring m the Seaate amendments.
There are many of the amendments which at any
other timel would vote against; there are many
of them which I think wrong in principle. But,
sir, the honor, and perhaps the existence, of the
Government depends upon the prompt passage of
some revenue bill. I will therefore vote for the
amendments of the Senate. I vote for the amend-
ments of the Senate, and have voted for this bill
as a revenue measure simply. It is probable, were
it not necessary to produce increased revenue, I
would not vote for near all the amendments.
There are many of them I do not approve. It is
necessary, however, indispensably necessary, to
increase the revenue to the amount of several mil-
lion dollars.^"Under the operations of the pres-
ent tariff law, the revenue for the next fiscal year,
as near as it can be estimated, will not exceed
$39,000,000, partly because the value of many
articles upon which the duties was based in 1857
has gone down. An ad valorem tariff will now
produce less than it has done for a period of many
years, nearly all the articles of commerce bearing
a less price than usual; therefore the present tariff
is totally inadequate. The tariff now proposed,
with the Senate amendments, is substantially the
tariff of 1846, with the atl valorem reduced to spe-
cific duties. Gentlemen on the other side of the
House, who were in favor of the tariff of 1846,
should remember that this tariff bill is framed sub-
stantially upon the average rate of duties imposed
by the act of 184G, with the exceptions that the
duties are now made specific, instead of ad valorem,
and the free list of 1857 is added. I
Mr. Q.UARLES. Let me interrupt the gentle-
man for a moment.
/ Mr. SHERMAN. I cannot yield. With the
..exception of the two articles of tea and coffee,
there are no articles I believe added to the taxa-
ble lists in this bill which were not contained in
previous tariffs. If there aie any, they are not
important. The duty imposed by the Senate
upon tea and coffee is temporary. It can last but
for two years. It is a small duty, and it ceases
with the payment of the recently issued'bonds
and Treasury notes. It can last at most but for
two years. This bill, modified by the Senate
amendments, is necessary to produce requisite rev-
enue. In times of ordinary prosperity, this tariff
bill, with the Senate amendments, would produce
$65,000,000; but in the existing condition of com-
merce, it will not produce so much—at least for
a year or two.l
Owing to the heavy increase of the public debt
during the present Administration, itis necessary
to realize more revenue than sufficient to pay cur-
rent expenditures. The interest of the public debt
is an important element of expenditure. I have
a statement, which has been carefully prepared,
showing the actual condition of the public clcbtat
this time. I have gathered in separate items the
whole of the public debt, so far as I could. It is
as follows:

The debt now funded, orevidenced by Treasury-
notes, or admitted deficiencies provided for by
law, amounts to $87,697,033. The class of spe-
cial debts and deficiencies amount to $9,181,997.
That includes the Washington and Oregon war
debt; the award made by the Senate in favor of
the Choctaws; the Creek trust fund; the Califor-
nia war debt; the deficit in the Indian rjst fund,
caused by the abstraction of the bonds by Bai-
ley; private bills passed, (partly estimated,) at
$1,000,000; and the deficiency in the Quarter-
master's department, malting an aggregate I have
stated. The aggregate of the public debt, it thus
appears, is $96,18S,994.
When this Administration carae into power, the
public debt amounted to $29,060,386 90. There
was a balance in the Treasury on the 1st of July,
1857, of $17,710,114 27, leaving a balance of in-
debtedness of (511,350,222 63, while the present
acknowledged debt is $87,000,000; or, including
debts acknowledged by the departments and by
one or the other of the two Houses, is over
§96,000,000. And this does not include the claims
allowed by the Court of Claims, bills now pend-
ing in Congress, suspended accounts in the De-
paitments, (which I am told are large,) or the
money abstracted from the mint at New Orleans
by the authorities of Louisiana. Those four items
are not included in my statement.
It is impossible to compute what has been al-
lowed by the Court of Claims, because in some
cases they allow a claim which involves a prin-
ciple upon which many other claims must be al-
lowed. In one case, by allowing a claim of $300,
or $400, they adopted a construction of a law that
would lead to the allowance of millions. It is not
possible to state what amount will be required to
meet the bills which maybe passed by Congress.
It is also impossible to estimate the suspended
amount at the Treasury Department.
As to the amount of money abstracted from the
mint at New Orleans, I take it as a matter of
course, that upon returning reason, the people of
Louisiana will restore the bullion they have taken.
Such, then, is the condition of the publicdebt.
The amount necessary to meet the regular annual
appropriations for the next fiscal year, as esti-
mated by Secretary Cobb, is $45,650,282 71, as
follows:
Estimated appiopiiations for the service ofthe year ending
June 30, 1862 :
Pensions §1,082,000 00

$45.650,883 71
To this sum must be added the permanent ap-
propriations, including the expense of collecting
the levenuc, amounting to $6,130,914 14, and the
interest on the public debt, about $5,760,000, mak-
ing the lowest amount necessary to carry out ex-
isting laws, the sum of $57,541,196 85. And,
sir, we know very well, that this sum will be
increased by new appropriations by Congress, and
that the country will be fortunate indeed, if the
new Administration shalllimit the annual expend-
iture to $60,000,000.
If", an, in addition to this sum, we must meet
the political difficulties of the time, if we must
maintain the Government and defend the prop-
el ty of the nation by an appeal to physical force,
it is evident we must pass a revenue bill. We
would be derelict in the highest duty intrusted to
us if did not do so before this Congress term-
