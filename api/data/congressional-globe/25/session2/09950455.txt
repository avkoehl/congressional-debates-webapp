had been favorab'e to it in, the nation, and had a
delegation appointed, of whom he was one, to visit
this city, ¿.though he had been positively and
repeatedly told that no negotiations would be held
with him, or any other delegation for that purpose,
here
Under these circumstances, the party m the na-
tion favorable to a treaty, seeing no prospect of
settling the controversy through the agency of
Ross—tneir country and their people groaning
under calamities thnt had be°n borne for years, but
\ hich had accumulated until they become almost
insupportab'e—finding tint unless some means
could be adopted, and speedily adopted, their na-
tion must boon become utterly destroyed, and their
people, already degraded and demoralized, scat-
tered to the four wmdi Without "a hab tation or a
name"—being without institutions, without law,
or a regularly organized system of Government,
they determined to rrarch boldly to the breach,
and hazard their lives in an effort to save
their nation. This could only be done by
a trea'y, and no treatv could be mads but
in the nation, and there only on the basis
of the five millions which Ross, himself had
before agreed to accept, as has been before re-
marked A meeting of the people was called at
New Echota m December, 1835, at which from one
to five hundred assembled, and appointed thedele-
ga'es who concluded the late treaty. That delega-
tion, before concluding on the terms of the final
treaty, however, and in conformity with their de-
termination at the meet.ng, used every effort to ob-
tain the co-operation of Ross and h « delegation to
that treaty, or any other within their power, with
such alterations or modifications as might be agreed
upon here Indeed they offered to yield up to Ross
and his parly the whole management of the nego-
tiation, if he would agree to conclude a fina' trea-
ty, but that mai/idual obstinately refused every
proposition, and unless the Government would
agree to give him the price he asked, and place the
money under his control, he objected to any ar-
rangement, however advantageous to the nation at
laige There being no otter mode of relieving
then country from the difficulties m which it was
placed, pir l\, too, \>, the conduct of Ross m re-

The genilempn from Kentucky [Mr Harlan] has
ascertained "i t the) have been paid for the time
they were enja^ed in the negolntion, their ex-
penses incurred for trai ailing here, «te, and
this is his proof of corruption and bnbe-' Can

John Ross and his delegation wre paid £ 13,000
ft r thnr time -"id exp n*es her?, on tne same oc-
casion Wtie i'iey paid lor oppon-i^ the treaty''
Win did nrt the gentleman tell us how much Ross
and his delegation, who were her  to prevent a
treaty, were paid? I am quite certain the\ received
as much as the other*, in pioport on to numbers,
and the time they were engaged, and if the gentle-
man will look on the other side ot ihis picture, he
will find it so It has been charged and íepeited,
that the Cherokees, vith the exception of very
few, are opposed to this treaty, and a pretended re-
monstrance which has been sent here, purporting
to have been signed by eighteen thousand persons,
is the proof of the fact I am not prepared to say
that a majority of the Cherokees did give their as-
sent to this act, nor is it likely, among all the trea-
ties heretofore made with Indian tribes, that this
has been the case. Indeed, from the character of
the people?, it is impossible it could be, where so
much ignoiance pievails Perhaps, even among
the Cherokees, who are admitted to be much the
most intelligent of all the tribes with which we are
acquainted, there are not more than one in ten,
perhaps not one in twenty, who have intellect
enough to understand any thing about it.   John
Ross, we all know, speaks for the ignorant Indians,
but without their will Of those who know or take
any interest in the affairs of the nation, counting
all, east and west, I have strong grounds to believe
that a majority are favorable to the treaty The
statement that eighteen thousand have protested
against it, is absurd, for it appears, from the official
report of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, that
there are only about 14,00ft, men, women, children,
slaves and all, of the nation east of the Mississippi
How, then, could eighteen thousand befound capa-
b'e of protesting'' About one-third of that number
has e removed West, of whom it is not pretended
that any have signed the memorial Less than one-
fourth of the fourteen thousand East, with the seven
or eight thousand West, would make a majority of
the whole nation
It appear*, from the documents before us, that a
great many who opposed the treaty, as well as
most of those m favor, have taken the benefit of it,
and removed West Among those are perhaps one-
half of the delegation who were here at the time the
treaty was concluded. We have already paid a
considerable part of the money stipulated to be paid
by the provisions of the treaty, and incurred great
expense m its execution The pnce agreed upon
for the Cherokee lands is not only more than we
have ever paid for any Indian territory hereto-
fore, but far above the real valus of the country;
and the mode of distributing the amount, altho igh
not satisfactory to John Ross, who wishes to con-
trol ti e money, as he now does the ignorant part
of the nation, is just and equitable, with a proper
regard to the rights of the people From this brief
statement of the affair, I am at a loss to conceive
w here gentlemen find evid'nee to justify the denun-
ciation-, they ntter against this Government, and all
who had any agency in making the treaty They
change l' to have teen corruptly and fraudulently
made, because John Ross and tho e under his im-
mediate control have refused to sanction it I in-
sist that a full consideration has been paid for the
country, and indeed more than it is woiih A ma-
jority of the nation, capable of understanding their
interest, have consented to, anl availed themselves
of, the provisions of it It has been said by seve-
ral gentlemen who undertook lo e?lculate the losses
w hich the Indians will sustpm by the treaty, that,
p < ii i ng the sum of fi " mi'iion* to be the value
(i the lands in a wild state, yet, th.2 improvements
m th  country when paid for out of that sum to
il" individual Indian*, will exhaust nearly the
w hole
The valuation of improvements, under the treaty,
is not all they receive After they have secured
tne -amount of that estimated value, (which by the
way, I understind, ha^ been generally verv high,)
they «¡el! out then places to our own ci'izen*, (the
po<S'ss*ory right) fir a furthei sum mmany ca*e*,
I have known as much as the fee-simple tit'e would
be wunh
I1 gentlemen call n ruinous to the Indians, to
remove on the terms I have staled, they can find
most of the wh te settler* in the country willing, on
lerms less fav orable to remove themselves
Bj independent of th  oblig?tions under the 'ate
treaty, I contend, thpt b\ the power which the
Uni'ect States have ícserved to themselves in vari-
ous treaties here ofore made to guard and contiol
tne affairs of the Cherokee people so as to promote
their interests and piospenti, w e were bound under
ti .. circumstances I have mentioned, to remove
them, as the only mean1- of saving the nation trom
utter annihilation And i'v* duty, it *eems to me,
ought not to be omitted, even when the Cherokees,
deluded as they are bj the false and -selfish coun-
sels of an ambitious chief, refuse their consent to
such a mea*ure.
Much has been said of the absurdity of a senti-
ment read from a pamphlet written by a Chero-
kee, (Elias Boudinot,) in defence of the late treaty,
that "if one hundred persons are ignoiant of their
true situation, and are so completely bhrded as not
to see the destruction that awaits them, «e can see
stro g reasons to justify the action of a minority ol
fitty persons to ao what the majoruy would do, if
they understood their condition—to «ave a nation
from political thraldom and deg adation " Prom
jny acquaintance with Mi. Boudinot, and from the
pamphlet alluded to, and other ar'icles written by
him, I can say that, as a man ol intelligence,, he
wouldjnot surfer by a comparison with. John Ross-,
who has been so much complimented. The senti-
ment alluded to, when apphed to an intelligent
community, each individual participating in the
administration of the Government, may not be or-
thodox, but in reference to the great body of the
Cherokees having no understanding or will of their
own, but influenced by a self-created ruler, it is
by no means absurd In this pamphlet (from
which I have obtained some of the other facts I
have stated,) it is alleged that, according to the
custom of the Cherokees, the chiefs are to be elect-
ed every four years.
In 1830, Ross was elected, but since that time
they have held no election, so that, although he
calls himself the principal chief, and pretends to
exercise all the power, as if he was really, as he
frequently says, "the constituted authority of the
nation," his office, in fact, has long since expired,
and he now acts as a self-created dictator Influ-
enced by his fixed determination to prostrate those
Cherokees who have negotiated with the Govern
ment, encouraged by that *pirit of fanaticism
which he has observed prevailing among a portion
of ouT own people in a certain quarter to make
common cause with him, or any others who will
war against (he interest of the South, he has been,
for two year*, causing" petitions to be sent here
against the treaty, without the least prospect of
setting it aside, until the time has expired when, by
the treaty, the Cherokees were to have removed.
The victims of his mischievous policy, w ho have
been misled by him, will soon discover that the
hope he has held out so long has been false and
illusive, and that, m despite of his opposition, the
treaty will be executed
Wi h the controversy between the gentleman
from Virginia [Mr Wise] and the State of Geor-
gia, I have nothing to do, any further than it in-
volves the rights of Alabama The able and effi-
cient representares from Georgia here are fully
competent to the ta*k ot 'efending their own State.
The Golfín claim, ao iat wmch so much has been
said by that gentleman, is exclusively a Georgia
matter, and I profess no information on the sub-
ject, but I beg leave to remark that if, on the mere
testimony of John Ross, given before the commi-
tee of investigation last winter, when he was ex-
erting himself to set aside the treaty, and laboring
under prejudices and motives of «trong personal
and political feeling, a high functionary of the Go-
nernment and an officer of this House ?re to be sus-
pected of corrupt conduct in bringing: about the
treaty, to secure a supposed interest in the claim re-
ferred to, we have but little chance of escaping as-
saults on our reputations.
The gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Wise)
threatens to "castigate ' Georg a, if she attempts
to assert her claim to that portion of her territory,
in possession of the Cherokees \\ hen docs that
gentleman, who professes so much j-alou*y of the
increasing powsr of the General Government over
the States, and prides himself on his State Rights
principles, find authority to "castigate a sovereign
State," in the constitutional exercise of her juris-
diction withm her ovn limits? But the sentiment
uttered oy the gentleman from Virginia, vhich
struck me with most a*tonishm"nt and alarm, was
that in reference to the numerous petitions and re-
monstrances sent here against this treaty, when he
says, that he has been exert ng himself to br nz the
petitions of the people to bear upon the ac ion of
this House These petition*, no doubt uo i trom
the same northern horde of fanaucs and f~¡\-e phi-
lanthropists, who, regardle-s of the constitutional
rights oí tne Southern Slate*, or ihe danger of a
dissolution of the Union, have been *o long- t-ccit-
mg Congress with their petitions m arother deli-
cite sulject, with which they have nothing at all
to do A feeling of ho ti'm to (he South, causes
t e movement* en both these questions, *o nearly
allied in then m aginations
Can the gentleman from Virginia, whose consti-
tuents are so deeplv interested in preserving our
constitutional rights, free from the influence of the
fanaticil *p nt that has *prung up of ¡ate,favor an
attempt, evidently designed to be in aid of'he great
