Ho. of Reps.
thus practically afford no relief to the consumer
ot' tea and coffee, but it would at least give
new life to our mercantile marine. To what
extent this discrimination in favor of American
tonnage raised the prices of freight on these
articles before American-commerce in Ameri-
can vessels was driven from the seas, I am not
able to state with certainty. But 1 am in-
formed on good authority that it had a marked
effect in enlarging our foreign carrying trade,
and the records show that American tonnage
at no time in oar history increased so rapidly
as within that period.
The following table, taken at intervals of
five years, gives the number of pounds of tea
and coffee admitted free, and the number of
pounds paying duty, during the fiscal years
ending as follows:

For some reason, not now traceable, there
was no uniformity in the quantities paying
duties from year to year. Duiingsome years
the quantity was much larger than during any
year mentioned in the table.
The following table gives the number of
pounds imported in Ameiican and in foreign
vessels duiing the same fiscal years:

During the time embraced in the table about
two thirds of our importations, other than
tho e of lea and coffee, were made in Ameri-
can ships. Now, however, the tables are
reversed, aud wore tbau two thirds are in
foreign ships, and the proporliou of American
ships is growing small by degrees and beau-
tifully less" from year to year, and will con-
tinue to do so while Congress confines itself
to removing duties from articles not, produced
in i his country, and leaves high rates on ship-
building materials. The increase and decrease
of American ocean tonnage are shown in the
following expressive figures taken at intervals
of ten years:

But suppose tea and coffee had been admit-
ted absolutely free from 1832 to 1861, it would
not prove that they ought to be free now. The
necessities of our country then were but small
compared with those of the present time.
This point is illustrated m the following table,
which gives the average receipts from customs,
the average population, and the amount of
receipts per capita during every Administra-
tion si uce the first act was passed making tea
or coffee free:

During the next fiscal year, according to
the recommendation of the Secretary of the
Treasury, the revenue from customs should be
$'213,000,000, besides $110,000,000 from in-
ternal revenue, making from customs $5 32
to each inhabitant, if we estimate the popula-
tion at forty millions. Tea and coffee might
therefore very consistently bear a moderate
duty now, though we should concede that it
would have been justifiable to admit them free
in the better days of the Republic.
A tariff is always a tax. A tariff on tea and
coffee is therefore a tax. As such it is a bur-
den. So is the local tax of the farmer on the
little farm upon which he works early and late
to provide for the wants of his family. But
the expenses of the national as well as of the
State government must be paid, and onr in-
quiry should be, how can the necessary sum
be raised and be least burdensome to the tux
payer? In any event, I am not in favor of
raising more than is necessary. I do not be-
lieve in inviting extravagance and fraud by
providing revenues for which we have no legit-
imate use. Neither do I believe it to be just
that the men of this generation should be taxed
to death, or protected to death, in order to re-
lieve their posterity from contributing their
reasonable share toward the payment of our
colossal debt. I am in favor of larger reduc-
tions than the Secretary of the Treasury recom-
mended ; larger than those provided tor in the
pending bill; larger than it is reasonable to
expect would receive the sanction of a majority
of Congress. In addition to all other reduc
tions which could possibly be carried I would
gladly have welcomed free tea and coffee ; but
I could not and did not give my sanction to a
scheme for placing those articles oti the free
list first, and thus greatly endangering all efforts
to reduce on other articles that are necessaries
in a higher degree, the prices of which are
largely enhanced by prohibitory duties with-
out any corresponding benefit to the Treas-
ury. If this precipitate action of Congress
shall have the effect of preventing any further
reduction, or instead ot a reduction of about
twenty per cent, of giving us a reduction of
only about ten per cent., as I understand is to
be proposed, it will, in my judgment, be pre-
judicial to the best interests of the country.
That tea and coffee are to be free is a fore-
gone conclusion. The provisions in the pend-
ing bill for moderate duties upon them will
be promptly rejected, in accordance with the
views of the House already so emphatically
expressed. 1 have spoken not to influence
any one to vote in favor of retaining them,
bat to justify my previous action, and inci-
dentally to illustrate some of the objections
to the present iniquitous tariff.

REMARKS OF HON. W. W. VAUGHAN,
of tennessee,
In the House of Representatives,
May 11, 1872,
On the bill proposing an appropriation for erecting
a oustom-house, post office, and rooms for tho
Federal court in the city of Memphis.
Mr. VAUGHAN. Mr. Speaker, I shall con-
sume the time allotted to me on this occasion
by invoking your consideration and that of this
House to the bill I had the honor to introduce
proposing an appropriation for erecting a cus-
tom-house, post office, aud rooms for the Fed-
eral court in the city of Memphis.
Commerce has its necessities, and this is one
of them, which we must respect if we would
rightly discharge our duties here.
True, there are many such similar applica-
tions, bat this is not a subject for regret. If I
do not err it is a sign, and sure one, of the in-
crease and expansion of the trade, wealth, and
prosperity of the country.
Let us consider this subject for a moment.
Look at the extent and magnitude of this
country, stretching from the Atlantic to the
Pacific, from the great lakes to the Gulf of
Mexico; through so many degrees of latitude
and longitude: with such variety of soils aud
productions; with such lofty mountains, such
extensive plains; with such mighty rivers,
lakes, harbors, and inlets; with a climate.so
varied.
The productions of this and of all countries
are controlled by the laws of climate. While
in this country we may justly boast of more
valuable and diversified productions, perhaps,
than any other one country on the face of the
globe, we must remember that we are within
the temperate zone, and that we must look to
countries outside the United States for many
supplies. To the frigid zone we must look for
furs and other supplies peculiar to arctic re-
gions ; to the tropics for gums, drugs, spices,
mahogany, rosewood, lignum-vitse, and other
valuable timbeis; for coffee, much of our Sugar,
aud for tropical fruits, and other supplies
which can be produced only under an almost
vertical sun. Then, again, our country is so
extensive, that the sugar, rice, cotton, fruits,
and other intertropical productions of Texas,
Louisiana, Alabama, Florida, the Caroiinas,
and Georgia, are remote, very Car remote, from
the ice, cranberries, wheat, corn, hemp, hog,
ami wool-supplying regions of the northern
and western States.
The peculiar condition of communities has
much to do with their employments. Some
find agriculture most profitable and follow that,
others commerce, others manufacturing; bat
while we have made mighty and satisfactory
advancements in this last mentioned depart-
ment of human industry, we must look to
foreign countries to supply us with the silks,
satins, laces,, jewelry, highly flavored wines,
and much ot the costlier fabrics, which can
only be . produced in older countries, where
cheap labor and more capital are united with
riper experience aud educated skill.
By developing the productions of the peo-
ple we encourage agriculture ; by converting
the raw material into fabrics to wear, or agri-
cultural implements, we oncourage manulac-
tures; by constructing canals, railroads, steam-
boats, sailing vessels, atid steamships, we foster
commerce—the three beautiful daughters of
civilization.
Commerce is aptly termed the civilizer of
nations. It may be traced in its beueficent
pathway from remotest antiquity, scattering
broadcast its ever increasing, ever-fertilizing,
ever-civilizing and ever christianizing benefits
upon mankind, it has assumed giant propor-
tions with us. Look at it—with an outward
commerce, imports and exports exceeding.au-
nuallysix hundred million dollars; with an in-
ter-State trade amounting to more than three
thousaud million dollars annually. If it be
this now, while we are in our infancy as a
nation, what will it be when all these States
and Territories are densely peopled and devel-
oped? Shall we foster this commerce wHich
so vitally administers to the high_ behests of
civilization, or shall we neglect it and turn
deaf ears to its requirements? This is pre-
cisely the question before you; which shall
it be? It has its rules and necessities. Ono
of its rules is to create great centers of trade,
a dense population, and a mighty traffic.
This traffic demands custom-houses and post
offices. The recent change iu custom regula-
tions, permitting imported merchandise to
pass through in bulk, and without breaking
bulk, to these different centers of trade, makes
custom houses, poBt offices, and courts an
absolute necessity winch cannot be dispensed
li wiih. '
