Several Members. Too late.
Mr. BINGHAM, I should like to know ho\fr
it is too late. I objected when thfe Chair proposed
the question.
Mr.OLIN. I hope to make a suggestion which
will 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The recollection
of the Chair differs from that of the gentleman;
but as the gentleman states he made his objection
in time, the Chair will entertain it. The gentle-
man from New Yoik [Mr. Olin] is, therefore, not
in order.

 So the vote was not reconsidered. *
Mr. EEOLMAN. Mr. Speaker, it is a little late.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman
cannot speak unless by unanimous consent.
Mr. HOLMAN. I do not rise for the purpose
of making a speech, but for the purpose of mov-
ing; that the House do now (nine o'clock, p. m.)
adjourn. I modify my motion to adjourn by say-
ing take a recess until twelve o'clock to-morrow.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. A motion for a
recess till twelve o'clock to-morrow is equivalent
to a motion to adjourn, and therefore can only
be put as a motion to adjourn.
Mr. HOLMAN. Then I nut it in that shape.
Mr. WADS WORTH. I ask to be excused
from voting.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair can-
not entertain that motion.
Mr. PERRY. I rise to a privileged question.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. No question of
privilege can intervene in a motion to adjourn, ex-
cept ir 'tie a motion to adjourn to another day.
Mr. PERRY. That is the motion I wish to put.
I move that when the House adjourns, it adjourn
to meet on Friday next.
Mr. ALLEN, of Ohio. I move to amend by
insertingSaturday; and on that I demand the yeas
and nays, and tellers on the yens and nays.
Tellers were ordered; and Messrs. Siiersiam
and Allen, of Ohio, wer#> appointed.
Mr. WAJDSWORTH. _ I ask to be excused
from voting on that question.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair does
not entertain that motion, it having been decided
that on a motion to adjourn, a motion to be ex-
cused from voting cannot be entertained.
Mr. WADSWORTH. I most respectfully ap-
peal from the decision of the Chair. ••
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair can-
not receive an appeal. The Chair makes his de-
cision, subject to the censure of the House, but
cannot receive the appeal.
Mr. HOLMAN. I rise to a question of order.
The motion is not simply one to adjourn, but one
to adjourn to a day certain.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair makes
the same decision in regard to that. The rule in
regard to both is based upon the same principle.
The House divided; and the tellers reported—
ayes six, noes none.
So the yeas and nays were ordered.

No quorum voting.
The SPEAKER pro Umpore. The motion to
adjourn is pending, and that is the only motion
which can now be put.
Mr. VALLANDIGHAM. I call for a count
of the House.
Mr. HICKMAN. Is it not in order to move
a count of the House ?
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Not during the
motion to adjourn.
Mr. VALLANDIGHAM. It was donenmo-
ment ago. The rule is peremptory. The actual
Speaker recognized it b'ut a few moments ago;
and I insist that the Speaker pro tempore shall
obey it.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Will the gentle-
man refer to the rule ?
Mr. VALLANDIGHAM. I do not recollect
the number. The rule was read here.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The case was a
different one fiom this.
Mr. VALLANDIGHAM. Not at all.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair de-
cides, according to usage, that amotion to adjourn
cannot be intermitted by a motion for a count of
the House.
Mr. VALLANDIGHAM. I appeal from that
decision, and call for the leading of the rule. The
Speaker decided a moment ago that there must
be a count.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The decision of
the Speaker was that while the mam question was
operating a motion that there be a call of the House
could not be entertained, unless upon a count it
appeared that no quorum was present.
Mr.VALLANDIGHAM. I demanded a count
of the House because upon the roll call which has
just been completed no quorum appeared.
The SPEAKER pro Umpore. The Chair can-
not entertain the demand pending a motion to
adjourn.
*M r. VALLANDIGHAM. There is a rule that
requires a count of the House.
Mr. ALDRICH. That lule docs not apply in
this case. [Lauihter.]
Mr. VALLANDIGHAM. I appeal from the
decision of the Clnur, and cull for the reading of
the rule.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair can-
notentertain the appeal while a motion to adjourn
is pending.
Mr. VALLANDIGHAM. The Chair must
entertain the appeal.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair de-
clines to entertain the appeal, in accordance with
the uniform precedents of the House.
Mr. VALLANDIGHAM. The Chair will
entertain the appeal. [Cries of "Order!" and
confusion.]
| The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair will
i not entertain the appeal. -The* question is on the
motion that the House adjourn.
Mr. VALLANDIGHAM. I insist on my ap-
peal from the decision of the Chair.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair re-
fuses to entertain the appeal for the reason he has
before stated, subject to the censure of the House.
The Chair will state the question. Upon the mo-
tion that when the House adjourns, it adjourn to
meet on Saturday next, made pending a motion
that the House adjourn, no quorum voted. Un-
i der the rules of the House, buttwo motions could

then be entertained: the motion that the Hou§£
adjourn, and the motion that therebe actfllof the
House. The motion to adjourn was already pentl^
ing, and the motion that there be a csilijpf the House
could not,therefore,be entertafried,f6r"the'r6asori
that the motion 'to adjourn being pf hfgftfer privi-
lege, must take precedence. Upon tttaft vote tM
gentleman from Ohio demands that there bp a
count of the House. The Chair decides that, acr
cording to the uniforfn usage, he cannot Entertain
the demand and cannot reccive an appeal, whitftt
he refuses to do, subject to the censure of th&
House.
Mr. VALLANDIGHAM. The Speaker of
the Hou&e only a f^v minutes ago deciued differ-
ently.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Speaker re-
fused to entertain an appeal under similar circum-
stances, and the present occupant of the chair
simply follows his ruling.
Mr. VALLANDIGHAM. I appeal to the
records of the House.
The SPEAKERpro tempore. The Chair can-
not hold any colloquy with the'gentleman from
Ohio. The pending motion is that made by the
gentleman ftom Indiana, that the House adjourn.
Mr. HOLMAN. I withdraw the motion to
adjourn.
Mr. VALLANDlGllAM. I move that there
be a call of the House, and upon that motion call
for the yeas and nays..
Mr. SARGENT. 1 rise to a question of order.
I submit that a call of the House is not in order,
unless tlig Chair fir&t proceed to count the House
for the purpose ofascertaining whether a quorum
is present.
TIk- SPEAKERpro tempore. The roll call just
completed discloses the fact that no qttorum is
present.
The yeas and nays were ordered.
