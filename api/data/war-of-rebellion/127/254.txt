EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT,

Milledgeville, Ga., April 27, 1861.

Hon. L. P. WALKER,

Secretary of War, Montgomery, Ala.:

SIR: While I assure you I entertain no feelings of jealousy on account of your exercising the right to appoint surgeons and assistant surgeons for the troops raised in Georgia and furnished to Confederate States, yet, conflicting information on the subject has reached me (having but a few days since been furnished by Doctor Blackburn, of Barnesville, Ga., with what purported to be an extract from a letter from you, stating that "all surgeons are now appointed by the Governors of the State where volunteer regiments are raised and tendered to the Government, and that when thus appointed they rank as assistant surgeon in the Regular Army," and then only yesterday having received your telegram in which you say in reference to such surgeons, "I appoint them"), I venture to trouble you with this note, and beg you to inform me definitely on the subject. Permit me also to inquire if you have appointed the surgeons to the volunteer troops which have been furnished by other States to the Confederate States, and as I have not me all the acts passed by the Provisional Congress, be pleased to cite me to, and if convenient furnish me with, the appointing power above alluded to is claimed to be exercised by the Secretary of War of the Confederate States.

Believe me, very truly, your obedient servant,

JOSEPH E. BROWN.

MILLEDGEVILLE, April 27, 1861.

Hon. L. P. WALKER:

Please say definitely whether you will receive volunteers into service by divisions and brigades, as I have a division of two brigades of fine soldiers nearly ready.

JOSEPH E. BROWN.
