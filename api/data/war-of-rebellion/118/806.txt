WAR DEPARTMENT, Richmond, Va., January 8, 1863.

Honorable J. P. BENJAMIN, Secretary of State.

SIR: Instructions have been again addressed to Brigadier-General Winder to procure the testimony you have asked for in your letter of yesterday relative to John Carfoot, a prisoner lately confined at Salisbury, N. C. As soon as he makes his report of the cause of the arrest of Carfoot and the proof that was produced against him it will be communicated to you.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JAMES A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War.

C. S. MILITARY PRISON, Richmond, January 8, 1863.

Honorable ROBERT OULD, Agent of Exchange.

SIR: Although you desired that no citizens be sent by flag of truce to-morrow yet General Winder wishes that exceptions be made in the cases of three men, viz: D. C. Bull, citizen of New York; William Bull, his son, and Wm. J. Peters, citizen of Delaware. Mr. John O. E. Sowers, citizen of Virginia, arrived yesterday on parole to obtain the release of Mr. Bull and his son. The Secretary of War is only willing that D. C. Bull be returned for Mr. Sowers.

William Bull is on parole for thirty days to obtain permission for the release of Charles Henry Smith, son of Colonel Larkin Smith. The other, Wm. J. Peters, paroled for thirty days to effect exchange of any citizen of the Confederate States who may be confined in prison at the North.

I am, sir, your obedient servant,

THOS. P. TURNER,

Captain, Commanding Prison.

Owing to some haste and confusion at the time of the departure of the prisoners last Tuesday we unavoidably failed to remit to them all their dues. Please receipt to Lieutenant Bossieus for the same. Respectfully,
