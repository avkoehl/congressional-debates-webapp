by possibility, occur To meet any contingency,
tn \i,  ihi h coming events may produce, shou'dnot
tie S ates stiengthen their internal resoutce% ím
prove tiieir strength, and cherish those institutions
vhich night, in coming events, be indispensable to
th^T safety' The States entertaining these views,
w 1 not be disposed to submit to any system which
h ay impair their strength and dry up their resoui-
ees Mr Chairman, when in the progress of our
nis or}, I saw tms Got eminent claiming the con-
s itutional power to charter a national bank, to con-
s ruu a system of internal improvements within
the junsdiction of the States, and the power of tax
n ■* the counti} for tne protection oí domestic man
ufaetures, my fears, that all the powers of Govern
ment would be concentrated into this great central
power, were gieatly aroused But, Mr Chan man,
when 'he Government not onlvseeks to disconnect
i'selí irom these banks, and then, in the form oí a
1 anVrapt law, hold ovei them a powei, which, in
its exercise, may deslioy every one oí them, my
jealousy is increased Now, Mr Chairman, I deny
to tlus Government the power in this way to inter-
fere with institutions cbartcied by the States, hav-
ing the clear and decided constituuonal authority
to do so Sir, tan it be that this Government is in-
vested with powei to impair, or, in any way, em-
baí ía&s, the operations of the clear constitutional
powers reserved to the States "* If it has, where is
the limitation i What institution may it not i each,!
what power may not be impaired"* These views,
Mi Chairman, have bi ought my mind to the con-
clusion, which many of the distinguished fnends
ot the Admniistiation formeilv entertained, that
this wai upon the Slate banks is a war upon Stale
ngM\ I speak of it as the tendenc), not as the
design oí this proposition
Mr Chairman, the Committee of Ways and
Means have leferred us to the examples of Fiance
•i'id England as wouhy of imitation in the re-
i eipts, sate keeping, and disbursements of their
levenues, and to enlighten us upon this subject,
have had a view of then sv stems printed and laid
upon oui desks Sir, their systems aie essentially
ours ioi m then whole iiscal opeidlions the banks
a<c the pnncipal agents But sir, I shalllook to
the monarchies aud despotisms of Euiope loi ex-
amples in so íegulatmg the fiscal agency of this
Government as to secure the liberties ol the people
and our free institutions Sir, the actual custody
of the public money in Europe by the go\ernments,
is at raí, i ued with the emplojment oí immense
s'aiii'mg annus, who suppiess and keep down
liberal sentiments, and keep unbroken tne fetters
with which the oppressed people are bound down
fou, it was lift ioi republican Amenca, for a free
people, to dense a plan by whien the public purse
c in be so kept as lo be at ccssible to the Executive
foi all If gal disbuisemcnts, and \et so \ ithhcid
irom its d( lual custodv as to place it beyond the
powei oí abuse Such has been the efíect oí the
svstem here'oioie—such I (ear, will not be the
eiteU of the proposed s) tcm if adopted
I have thus, Mi Speauer, presented my objec-
tions openly and fcailesjy, and upon my responsi
bih j to my constituents I may be mistaken, and
time nidi expose the enoi, yet, sir, until the fal
lac voí hese objections aie made manifest, I must
respectfully to all with whom I differ, but fnmly
ant decidedly oppose the plan recommended by
the executive
H ivmg thus Mr Chairman, attempted to prove
the s ifetv and capacity of the State banks as fiscal
aud commeicial agents, shown their present sol-
\o.ilV, \indica'ed the propnety and necessity of
their course in suspending specie paymmts, and
m ge1 my objections to the sub-Treasury scheme, I
will now offei to the committee a few brief remalles
in supput of the proposition which by the kind
inin'gence of Lie house, I have had the honor ol
lai i ig beío c it
The sel eme which I have presented is substan-
t ali^ tnc cuirencv bill' which passed botn
) > lses of Congiess at the late session of Congress,
uiid which was letamed by the late President
under the apprehension that its construction might
require the mteivention of the judiciary, on ac
count of some supposed ambiguity in its language
1 he substantial feauues of this bill, requires the
notes of all specie paying banks to be received
m pavment of the public revenues, whether
derived from foreign importations, public lands,
or any other source, and restricts any distinction
between different branches of the revenue and for
the purpose of enlarging the specie circulation of
' he country, by such a gradual process as to prevent
any shock in the business and commerce of the
country It provides that the notes of no specie
paying banks shall be received which shall not im
mediately discontinue the issue and circulation of
all notes under ihe dollars, and at given periods
thereafter, all notes under ten and twenty dollars
It also provides for the continuance of such of the
present deposite banks as aie sound and in good
credit, as depositories of the public money, upon
the condition of afiordmg such collateral security
as the Secietary of the Treasmy in the exercise
of a sound discretion, may presci ibe This bill
o^y presents the gencial features of a 'dieme
which may be ma'ured by amendments adapted to
the present embarrassed and emergent condition c f
the countryt
This bill also proposes a restriction of the i am
ber of State banks to be continued as depositories
of the public money within such bounds as to make
it their interest to adopt the measures of reform in
the currency which experience has proved to be
necessary for its extension, its credit, and its sound
ness Th s number will be m the discretion of
Congress This plan had the countenance, and was
recommended by the late administration, as w ell as
by the present Secretan of the Treasury It was
earnestly and repeatedly urged, and many of the
States have adapted their legislation to its princi-
ples and that there is now no just cause for its
abandonment—noi has the present state of things
sti ípped it of anv of its advantages or benefits I
think I have satisfactorily proved, unless it be ne-
cessary to the correctness of the system, that bank-
ing institutions should be infallible, and conducted
by mfal ihle men, which is unattainable
In presenting this scheme, I have done it under
the impression whibh seems generally to prevail,
that the banlnns institutions of the country would
not be abandoned  and that fhpir notes, under those
modification    and restrictions   which experience
might f om time to time pi ove to be necessary,
would constitute a material paitof the cuircncy
oí thecountn     II this impression be true, and notes
of banks shall cont nne to constitute a matt rial part
of the curiencv of the counti}, I icgard it as strict-
ly propel, and indeed necessary, that the Fedeial
Government should so regulate its actions in lefci
ence to the eui rencv, which the States, in the exer
cise of their sovereign rights, have thrown into eir
culation, as to give to it as much credit and sonn 1
ness as possible, because by such a course thp mtei
cour e between the States will be more regular,
more uniform, tnoie harmonious,more convenient,
and more cordial    But it is said by some that Con-
gress has no constitutional oower to legitimatize
bank notes so fai is to compel the Government to
iec< ne them    Su, this notion is of modem ongin,
and is opposed to the principles upon which this
Government has acted fiom almost its foundation
It is true  this Gov eminent has no power to emit
paper monej , it can make nothing but metal " mo
mil,'1' for that is the standaid of \alue of the world
But there is a matenal distinctun between routing
money and receiving public dues    I do not see any
constitutional restriction upon the Government m
receiving a promise to pay in a bank note, or in a
meidiani's bond    I do not doubt the power of the
Government to recei1 e its dues in any thing it may
deem most expedient   and such has been its con-
stant and undei rating pi actice
Thp bill which I have submitted, oioposes also
to enlaige the specie circulation of the countij, by
gradually retiung the notes of smaller denomina-
tion, and introducing in their stead a metallic cu-
culation This sn, I piopose step bv step to do,
until the metallic circulation shall be so enlarged'
as to confine the material paper ciicuhtion to their
legitimóte sphere—commeicial transactions And
until the metallic bisi^ shall ?ssume such a rela-
tion to the paper circulation as to secure with-
out difficulty, the convertibility of the paper into
specie Tt is an adm tted piincrole that notes
and com of the same denommvion will not
circulate together Ti ° supenoi value of the
coin makes it a subject of commerce, and it
al.vays seeks distant employment, when there is a
'ocal and less valuable currency to supply i<s local
calculation The plan which I propose seeks to
prevent this effect by restricting the circula ion of
notes to an amount above the denomi lation of any
com in circulation so as to that amoi nt 'o render
com indispensable and if by the operation of this
plan it shall b° found expedient still farther to re-
strict bank notes it can be done by the aid of that
expei íence, w hich the progress of the plan will un-
fold, which w ill be a sure guide to trn'h In the
discussion of this subject, I shall not find it neces-
sary to do much more than lefr to the expenence
of two of the most commercial nations of the
world, Great Britain and Frnce and the opinions
of some of the most distinguished s aiesrnen and
financiers of Gieat Bri am and the United States
The Bank of England in 1793, became seriously
and alarming1} embairassed on aceourt of the
immense re duction of her bullion, anu the heavy
demands ol depositors, the res.uU o which was a
suspension of specie payments, up to this ume, the
bank was no' authorized to issue notes of less de-
nomination than five j ounds, to p event dining
from circula ion com of small denomina ions The
-i spe> sion w as legali7ed by act of Pailnmcnt,
and the bank, to sucr)v the vacuum oeated by
the withdrawal fiom circulation of small coin,
which had been exported to the cont nent, was
authoi zed'o issue notes of £1 and £2 denomi-
nations These notes weie issued to a large
amount and cueulated to a great extent, the
result «as, what ahva}s will be, tbe expulsion
from circulation of nearly all coins of the
same denomma'ions Such were tne effects of this
act in enlarging the issues of the papei medium of
England, and expelling us bullion, Ilia' after many
efforts, in 1826 ibis law was lepealed, an 1 tne bank
required in 1829 to íestnct itspapei to the issue oí
£5 notes and over The ef oct of this íepeal, has
been so to enlarge the specie, as to secure the con-
vertibility of the paper cnculation The Bank of
France ispiohibited fiom issuing no cs below five
hundred francs, about %9i of our mone} This bank
wa= chaitered in 1800, and the restnc ion imposed
m 1804 From tha' time to tne present, notw lths'anc1-
mg the calamities of war, tvv o invasions, and sev eral
commeicial revulsions, the currenej oí France has
remained sound and uniform, and the paper of the
bank in good ciedit Austria and Russia, who aie
making vigorous exertioi s to enlarge then com
mtree have adopted the Bank of Fiance as a mode!
for their imitation and hive mcorpoiated| o-rnks
upon the same principle It would seem to me that
with sue 1> examp'es before Us, the le could be little
doubt of the coricctness of the pnncijile oi the bill,
winch I pioíose But, sir, I will add to this evi-
dence, b1 eitmg the opinions of some of the most
distinguished statesmen and finance!s of Gieat Bn-
tam who were wirnes es of the opera ion of the
bank restriction m England,andits injunous"Tec s
upon the cunency of tbe cour try The celebia'ed
Edmund Burke among the last let'eis which he ever
wrote, in ore addiessed to Mr Canning upon the
subjectofthe issuing of small notes, said " TellMi
