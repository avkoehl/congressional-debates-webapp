Improvement of the Western waters—'Mr. Hardin.
H. of Reps
&£.; when they are constructed? The only answer
which can be given is, that the power is inferrible
from the general grants of power quoted above, and
that the construction of these works are means ne-
cessary and proper to be used to carry into effect the
general grant to "regulate commerce." The same
rule of argument will apply to the construction of
roads for military purposes, or to railroads and
canals which may become necessary for facilitating
the commercial intercourse of the nation. If any of
these are means which become essential or proper
to be used for the protection of the military defences
of the country in time of war, "or to protect and de-
fend the commerce of the nation, either foreign or
inland, it is within the power of Congress to appro-
priate money for their construction, in order to enable
it to provide for the common defence of the coun-
try, and to regulate commerie between the States as
well as with foreign nations It is .not a question of
power.. This is too clear to be disputed. The only
question is as to the policy and expediency of
adopting the measure which may be proposed in
order to carry out the clearly delegated powers of
this body.
An objection occurs to me here, which is most
frequently urged by gentlemen residing in the Old
Dominion, or by those from the Palmetto State,
which is, that Congress has no proper jurisdiction
beyond tide-watei; and, consequently, no right to
appropriate money to be expended off salt water for
internal improvement purposes. These gentlemen
call themselves "strict constructionists," and boast
that they belong to 'the "strait-jacket school." It'
does seem to me, Mr. Speaker, as though these gen-
tlemen would treat the constitution as maniacs are
treated in hospitals. They would confine it to sea-
coast fortifications, which coot tens of millions of
dollars. They would illuminate it with the light-
houses, which cost nearly half a million annually to
keep their oil from burning out. They would guard
it with a navy whose annual charge is above eight
millions of dollars. And then, sir, they would com-
plete the prescription by encasing the patient in a
strait-jacket composed of sea-weed, pour salt water
in profusion upon its head to keep the western fever
down, and feed it with a light diet of salt water crabs
and herrings.
Why, sir, will any of these gentlemen point out
the provision in the constitution of the United States
(or of common sense) which authorizes Congress to
expend millions upon the seaboard for the protection
of commerce, but which also prohibits it from spend-
ing a copper in the interior for a similar purpose?
That provision in the constitution which empowers
Congress to erect a light-house, construct a break-
water, or deepen a harbor on the seaboard, extends
equally to the interior, and authorizes Congress to
remove the sandbars, to deepen the channels, and to
remove the snags from our rivers. These last ob-
struct the "commerce between the States" as much
as the shallow harbors and reefs on the seaboard, the
storms of the ocean, or the pirates on the seas, ob-
struct and endanger our "commerce with foreign na-
tions." And the same principles of constitutional
law, as well as the same sense of justice, render it
both necessary and proper for Congress to afford a
similar assistance to commerce in the one case as in
t'.ie other.
In order to show that the opinions of our most
conspicuous public men and the practice of our gov-
ernment have corresponded with the constitutional
view I have presented, I will turn the attention of
the House to a few facts.
In No. 14 of the Federalist, which was written by
Mr. Madison, he uses the following language:
"Let it be remembered, in the third place, that the
intercourse throughout the Union will be daily
facalitated by new inipnnemehts. Roads will be
every where shortened and kept in better order; ac-
commodations for travellers will be multiplied and
ameliorated; and interior navigation on our eastern
side will be opened throughout, or nearly through-
out, the whole extent of the thirteen States. The
communications between western and Atlantic dis-
tricts, and the different parts of each, will be ren-
dered more and more easy by those numerous canals
with which the beneficence of nature has intersected
our country, and which art finds it so little difficult to
connect and complete."
In 1806, Congress, with the approval of Mr. Jef-
ferson, made the first appropriation for ihe construc-
tion of the Cumberland road. About the same
period Mr. Jefferson caused a survey to be made of
a road between the city of Washington and New
Orleans.
In 1808, Albert Gallatin made his celebrated re-
port in favor of the policy of adopting a system of
internal improvements by the general government.
In 1816, on the motion of John C. Calhoun, (then a
prominent member of the republican party, and the
warm advocate of internal improvements,) a com-
mittee was appointed "to inquire into the expedi-
ency of setting apart the bonus and net annual pro-
fits of the national bank as a permanent fund for in-
ternal improvements."
Mr. Monroe, in one of his messages to'Congress,
says: "That irf his opinion Congress have an un-
limited power to raise money, and that in its ap-
propriations they have a discretionary power! re-
stricted only by the duty to appropriate it to purpo-
ses of common defence, and of general, not local—
national, not State benefit." And this was the
avowed principle upon which he acted through his
administration. Accordingly, during his adminis-
tration, in 1824, the following law was passed:
"Ail act to procure the necessary surveys, and esti-
mates, upon the subject of roads and canals.
"Be it enacted, 4fc", That the President is author-'
ized to cause the necessary surveys, plans, and esti-
mate's to be made of the route of such roads and
canals as he may deem of national importance in a
commercial or military point of view,- or necessary
for the transportation of the public mail," &c.
And appropriated thirty thousand dollars for the
purpose.of making the surveys.
Under the powers conferred upon the President
by this law, a great many surveys were made, and
amongst them was one for a canal between the Illi-
nois river and Lake Michigan. During the whole
of the administrations of Mr. Monroe and Mr.
Adams, regular and often large appropriations were
made for roads and canals and rivers, in every part
the nation. During the whole of General Jackson's
administration, these appropriations were also made,
although they were checked and diminished, for the
most part, for the Western country, by the votes on
the appropriations to the Maysville road and the
Wabash river. Notwithstanding these vetoes, ap-
propriations were regularly made for objects of in-
ternal improvement during that administration; some
of which, in my view, are of far less national im-
portance than those vetoed. I will read a few, taken
at random from the many I find in the laws passed
after the veto on the Maysville road:
In 1830. For improving the navigation of
Conneaught Creek in Ohio - $6,135
For improving the navigation of
Genesee river, in New York - 13,335
For removing obstructions in the
navigation of the Kennebec
river, in Maine - - 5,000
To Cape Fear river, ill North Ca-
rolina - 25,685
In 1831. For Ashtabula creek harbor - 7,015
For Black river harbor - - 9,275
For Oswego harbor - - * 21,412
- For Deer Island sea-wall, Mas-
sachusetts - - - i 12,390
For navigation of Conneaught
creek - - - - 6,370
For navigation of Genesee river,
' New York - - • 16,670
Besides these, there were appropriations made,
chiefly during the administration of General Jackson,
for the Chesapeake and Ohio canal, the Delaware
and Raritan canal, the Dismal Swamp canal, the
Louisville and Portland canal, amounting to some
millions of dollars. And numberless other in-
stances of similar appropriations might be cited
during the administration of General Jackson and
those who preceded him. Amongst other items I
find that two and a half millions of dollars have been
appropriated for the construction of the Cumberland
road, m twenty-six different laws, which have been
approved by every Piesident from Jefferson to Ty-
ler. During the latter part of the administration of
Mr. Van Buren these appropriations were general-
1 y, if not entirely suspended. The necessary ap-
propriations for the Western rivers were withheld,
and the Cumberland road having progressed so far
from salt water, was considered to have become
lost in the Western wilds, and had certainly out-
travelled the limits of constitutional appropriations.
Such, sir, was the manner in which the West was
treated, whilst larger sums were squandered in the
expenditures of the government than had ever been
before, since the organization of the government,
Under the present administration, something more
has been begun, but the appropriations have been
altogether too limited to answer the desired pur-
poses.
In proof of the statements above, I present the ac-
companying table, taken from Document No. 31, of
the 1st session of the 27th Congress, which was
prepared by the Secretary of the Treasury. The
first column exhibits the amount of appropriations
for internal improvements from 1829 to 1840. The
second exhibits the aggregate public expenditures
during those years, exclusive of payments for the
public debt and trust funds. Under the head of in-
ternal improvement are estimated appropriations
for harbors, rivers, lakes, breakwaters, sea-walls,
roads, &c.

Some members seems to be unapprized of the im-
portance and amount of trade which is transacted
upon the western waters, and of the population
which is dependent upon them for the means of
travel and of transportation, as well as of the rapid
increase of both population and commerce in the
West. I will take this occasion to present some of
the leading facts bearing upon ths subject, which
have been collated partly from the census returns,
and in part from the reports and statements of various
persons who have made this a particular subject
of investigation, and in whose statements I'confi-
dently rely:
In 1840, the population of the Western States was
6,376,972.
In 1840 the population of the Atlantic States was
10,686,381.
The area of the Western States in square miles
is 838,930.
The area of the Atlantic States in square miles
is 448,650.
The increase of the Atlantic States from 1830 to
1840 was at the rate of 16 per cent.
The increase of the Western States during the
same period was at the rate of 73 per cent.
The increase of the Atlantic States from 1810 to
1840 was 100 to 173.4.
The increase of the Western States from 1810 to
1840 was as 100 to 591.4.
It was thus be found that, while the Atlantic
States have not doubled in thirty years, the Western
States have, in the same time, augmented nearly six
fold.
In some of the new States, the increase far ex-
ceeded the general average: for instance, the decen-
nial increase of Mississippi was ]75 per cent., of
Missouri 173 per cent.) of Illinois 202 per cent., and
of Michigan 555 per cent.
In 1850, the population of the Atlantic and west-
ern States will be very nearly equal, if they progress
in population in the same ratio that they have done
for the last ten 01* twenty years; and at every suc-
ceeding census the relative stiength of the West will
increase on the Atlantic States. The above facts
are taken from a work recently published by Pro-
fessor Tucker, of the University of Virginia.
The extent of steamboat navigation on the west-
ern waters "has been variously computed at from
12,000 to 15,000 miles; the latter estimate being, in
my opinion, the most correct, as there are various
rivers in the West the extentof whose navigation is
not yet known, as there ha\e been 110 sufficient in-
ducements offered to steamboats to navigate them.
There are on the western rivers 550 steamboats,
with an average tonnage of 200 tons, equal to 110,-
000 tons.
Of these boats, about 100 were built during the
last year, and the average cost of each is ascertained
to be about $20,000;'making the first cost of the
steamboats in the West $11,000,000.
About 4,000 flat boats annually descend the west-
ern rivers, laden with every species of western prod-
uce, which are destroyed when they reach the South
and which cost'^600,000.
If we add together the amounts paid for insurance,
for boat hands, fuel, wear and tear of boats, interest
at 6 per cent, on the amount invested, and for flat boats,
