Pre-emption to settlers—Mr. Loomis.
H. of Reps.
prehension from that quarter The intelbgenceof the nomina-
tion efMr Muhlenberg as Mmistei to Austria wan received with
the utmost astonishment by all sides of this Housej and hynoue
with more than the chanmen of the Committee of Ways and
Means and oí Foreign Affairs I would ask either of the gentle
men if he dreamed ofauch an appointment when the appropri
tion was made, or the members of the select committee, when
they, at the last session, looked with so mush anxiety to the be-
nefits which were anticipated fram a coididl co operation, on
the part of the Executive, with Congiess, m relation to the to-
bacco trade, if they could have been content with such an ap-
pointment? And what is theie now to reconcile them to iti is
it that it msuied the disfranchisement of the State of Mississippi?
That, it is believed, it did accompln-h, for the day after the
vote was taken in the House of Representatives, which, by the
casting vote of the Speakei, sent Messrs Prentiss and Word
back, to be returned heie again, the President of the United
States nominated Henry A Muhlenfeeig as M'mster to Austua>
he having voted to vacate their seats
If there were no conditions attached to that appointment, ex
press or implied, if there were not some object to be effected by
delaying the appointment, why not have made it twelve or
eighteen months ago, when the mmistei to Prussia, whose out-
fit and salary were embraced in the =ame law, was appointed"?
Why not have made it at the coramencement of the present
session? The same reason applies as does in the case of another
member on ths floor, (Mr Bromsux of New Yoik,] whose
judgeship is held back until he doea the work of his ruasteis
here. And, further, several gentlemen were tantali7ed by the
delay, and the expectation of this mission It was also all-
important that the schisms in the Keystone State should be
healed Mr Muhlenberg held too securely the balance of power
in Pennsylvania to be permitted to return home to his consti-
tuents dissatisfied His former competitor for the high honors
of that State (Governor Wolf) had heen provided for, and re-
posed quietly under Executive patronage heie Many other
former members of Congress, notwithstanding Genera! Jack-
son's denunciation of the practice, had been taken fiom Penn-
sylvania and placed in high and lucrative offices by the Execu-
tive No wonder that Mr Muhleoburgfejt that injustice had
heen done to his claims He became restive, the collar was
about to be loosened, his thialdom too heavy to be longer
borne, when the Court of Vienna, with the outfit and salary
attachedj presented a fit opportunity of leconcilmg all Bui, [
ask again, why was not his appointment made at the com-
mencement of the session? Another object was to be accom-
plished; and, as I have befoie lemarked, the disfranchispment
of the State of Mississippi was a primaiy one with the Admi
mstration The securing of Mi Muhlenbeig's, vote upon that
question could not be dispensed with, as the result proved
These are some ot the speculations which tine appointment has
given rise to, and, if injustice has been done to the Executive
or the mmistei, they have the means of disabusing thenuelves
But as the case now stands, with the fads before them, no
honest juiy m the countiy would hesitate a moment to bring
in a verdict (under the íeport of the committee of the Senate of
1826, of which Mr Benton was ehairmin) of guilty of the
charge made in said repoit that "the President wants my
■vote, and Iwant his pahonage, I willvote as he wishes, and
he will give me the office I wish foi " The fact is, the ver-
dict has already been pionounced byjurors whe sat in antici-
pation of the case, and whose high stations in the country
forbid the idea that they were packed for the purpose The
four most prominent of t"ie committee of 1826, who passed
sentence in that lepoi t upon a Pi esident w * o should appoint to,
or a member of Congress who should a"cept, office, weie Mr
Benton, (chairman,) Mr Van Burén, Mi Richaid M Johnson,
and Mr Dickerson Will you beiieve it possible that these are
the gentlemen who now so openly advocate this bargain and
corruption^ One now >our President of the United States,
another your Vice Piesiden', another your Secretary of the
Navy, and another the leadei of the Loco Foco demagogue^
throughout the country
lamaskedby afriendwhyl single out this particulai case,
when there aie so many others equally flagrant it is because,
in the appointment referred to, 1 view the Executive as having
disregarded the expressed will of Congi ess, the wishes and inte-
rests ofthe tobacco plantéis of the country generally and of my
immediate constituents m particulai Su, an intense anxiety
has been, and stiil is, felt upon thi^ «subject The tobacco
planters have borne with patience the neglect ofthe Govern-
mentin protecting them from imposition and unprecedented ex
action in foreign countries, they have mai muted least m iegard
to what they felt most—the duties upon foieiso importations,
they have yielded to the impression that the Government of the
United States was formed for the benefit of the whole, and they
have quietly acquiesced m the duties imposed, both at home
and abroad, upon their interests, whilst all others have been
protected and guarded, however insignificant m their product
With an export of $10,000,000 annually, denied admission into
some, and received, wheie received at all, into othei poits with
heavy imposition, from whence aie impoited into the United
States articles, amounting to millions, free of duty—still they
have ceased to complain Sir, from no other class of our citizens
would these burdens, these grievances, have been so patiently,
so quietly, submitted to If is their love oi peace, their confi-
dence m the justness nf their Government, and an indissoluble
attachment to the Union, which has prevented their speaking a
louder, a moie impiessive language Had other interests been
thus neglected, similar application!  thus treated, y out desks
would have groaned undei mnumeiahle memorials for redress
convention aftei convention would have denounced youi ne
gleet, deputations would have thronged your city, and peihaps
nullification threatened
Afterthe promptaction on the part of Congress, inapprov
mg the reportan.! resolution ofthe select committee on the
subject of tobacco, we had a right to expect a prompt and cor
dial co-operation on the pari ofthe Executive Appropna
tions for two ministers being made—one to Prussia, the othei
to Austria, (Courts where the United States had not been re
presented before by so hieh a «fade,) and agents authorized
to be appointed, in addition, to take active steps for the
prosecution of those interests, we looked to the Executive for
a faithful execution ofthe poweis thusgiven him We did not
anticipate that the President would avail himself of those ap
propriations, made fbi a specific object, to consummate his
political arrangements m Pennsylvania, oi to gam an aseen
dancy over this House That his fuends miscalculated m send
mg back to Mississippi my friend Prentiss, who ^itsby me
and his colleague, is evinced by the lict of their being now

PRE-EMPTION TO SETTLERS.
SPEECH OF MR. LOOMIS,
Of Nfav York,
Li the  Houóc   of  Representatives,   Thursday,   June   7,
1838—On the bill to grant Pie emption Rignts
Mr LOOMIS of iNew Yoik said that he was in favor ot the
bill under consideration, not herau=e he did not think it defec
tive, but because, as it stands, it i& worth something; it is better
than nnthmg, anú he was not without hopea that it might be so
modified aid amended as to make it st'll better I am, said
be, for adopting a permanent system of pre emption in
favor of actual se tiers., piosptctive as well a=> pa&t m its ob

fei bringing it up to the piet,ent time, or, to name a day, say
the fiiot day of June, 1838, and I hope that the committee or
the chdii nan will move to amend t m that respect I think it
will not command one tliele^s vote m thi1* Ilou^e I believe

anticipate that the citizens ot theoldei States, aie hostile to it
So far as my observation has enabled me to pidse, I thmk them
mistaken in this opinion I believe sir, thata\er> hiree pro
portion of the citizens of the older States are entirely favorable
tothe principle of pie emption in favor of actual bona f It,

why those in this situation, who go on and take possession, und
make impro\ cments, should not be preferred atjthe same price
I belieye a laige share of the sales have heretofore been to ho
residents, speculators, those who desire to make ífivestmet i ,
and let the land lie for the Use Í speak, not disparagingly of
this class of persons Such investments are "hoi ©rdy lawful,
but obviously encouraged by the Government; and surely those
who avail themselves of the opportunity are by no means cen
smable Still, Idoubt the wisdom ofthis policy by the Govern
ment I can bee no good reason* I confess, why sales should
not be limited to actual settlers, by which thosewho cause the
use in ti a valúa ofthe laud by then Uboi would have the exclu-
sue benefit of if, tl at is, assuming that Government kept a
fixed minimum pi're for all landá ahije The present blU is,
however, not calculated foi such a state of ihiogs, but it* provi-
sions are favorable to the actual settlers, to the pioneers of our
settlement's, and I assure the Western gentlemen that a Strang
feeling ex:s'o in the oldei States to f&\ or actual settlers
Ihe class of emigiantswho, nrwhose friends, have observed
the nohcy of the Government in giantmg pre emption laws at
mteivote, covering ail time past up to a certain date, who as-
certain tl t all^hobdvepiecededfhemarjd^one upon the un-
sold pi bl c lands, hai e been unifoi mly confirmed in their pos

th,;J ( ^s I s iy si ha^e gone boldly on and tdken pobaession,
reí a1 on the past julicj of the Government a* affording evi-
de of Us future prar icp And 1 ask the question, had they
no ood gioum's foi then opinions, how would they anticipate
th jture action except by the pact's They may well consider
tr olicj of gi anting a preference to actual settlers a well set-
ti ' policy of the Government m the sale of its lands. Mr.
C iinman we must keep faith with settlci , and why should
\,t, not? Why not grant them a preference^ The rise *f the
i i value of lands in a neighborhood is caused by the improvements
i[ made by the haid labor of the actual settleis, and why shoulá
| not thase improvements and that labor go to enhance the value
i of the lands of then fellow laborers, rather than those of non
i, residents'1 Who should have the benefits of the rise of these
11 lands? who but those who earn it, who, by their labor produce
i ¡ , who add all the increased value, all that exists, pr can exist,
J ¡   above the mere Government price?   The gentleman from Mas-
I      sachuseits [Mi Lincoln] stated, and truly, that the mmi-
¡i mim price of public lands, fixed by law, is $1 25 cents per
M   acic, and that this minimum price is all the lands will fetch
II    at any rate, as the accounts of sales show; and he urges
'i that giving preemption rights will not mciease the value to
i the Government of the ^mroundmg lands, however it may do
Í to individual owners This I do not deny I claim nothing on
] that score I only ask a preference to be given to actual occu-
pants at the same price    The same gentleman says that these
i occupants having gone on against law maintain their posses-
j «¡ions against law, and that no bona ^(Repurchaserdare locate
i Ins pmchdse on 4 lot so occupied And he uiges that it is in-
expedient «md unjust to legislate in favor of sustaining and
encouraging these lawless individuals in their practices and
tnei, aespasses The fact in this respect ha\ e been stated by
the gentleman from Arkansas [Mi Yell] and others, and stand
uivl°nied to be, that aftei the public sales are o\er,and the
Hnd=;<¡ubject to private entry, no such practice exists as pre-
venting apuichasei fiom loc<-ui s ir"<. hndi hadare not al
ready pin chased, bit that the settler** do combine to protect
their possessions until they have the oppoitunrv of entering
them themselves, that when a tract is first opened foi sale, it is
done by public auction, before which no private entry is re-
ceived, and that these squatters, as they are teimed, wiü not
permit any one to pinchase their possessions at those public
sale--, but that, if the possessor fails to avail himself of this first
opportunity to complete his own purchase, by entering and
pavmg for his possession at the public sale, he is no longer pro
tectedby his fellows, the squatter's law is then atan end, hur,
should an> speculator, at those sale*, attempt to avail himself
of the impiovements mide by a settler, aod thus to speculate
out of the hard earnings of those pioneers m the forest, he
does so, as the gentleman from Massachusetts [Mr. Lin-
coln] justly says, at the peril of his head, the settlers will
not permit it Sit, this may be against the leuei ofthe law,
bmit is not asainst justice It i-s but common right, common
hon* stv, it ongitiate^ m a pnn iple which is above law itself,
and which always should be followed by laws—common right,
the title which even man has to whit He earns by the sweat of
his biow Before the occupancy, the lands be'onged as much
to one citizen as to another, all had a common mteiest in them
If one has added to their value by his labor, cleared the fields,
erected his dwelling, made road', ísit nghtj is it honest, that the
other mav enter into equal competition with him to secure to
himself all the fruits of this labor of his brother, without first
giving that brother the right of securing them himself, by the
opportunity of purchasing first, and at the same pricel This,
^ir, is ah that this bill seeks to do Shall we comp'am of men
foi protecting tl en rights, so manifest as these? Are they to
be ileeme 1 lawless and unworthy of piotcction for sustaining
the highest, *n«t be-.t moral principles'* I think this far fi rn
being a good reason wh> pre emption r ghts should not be sanc-
tioned bv law Itivn my judgment, amamfestution of moral
right andiustice m advance of the law It show3 what the law
on^ht to be
Mr Clnn man, many of these settlers upon the public lands

I would have it so that those of our citizen* who go tothe west
to improve the Government ldnd<% and c lUrge the boundaries
of our settled country, should feel frt e to locate themselves on
any of then and our commoi propei tv, knowing, from the sta
tute book, that the fru t^ of their aooi would he protected to
them on c applying with the law before them Theie can be no
doubt but the sale* of lands to non residents is "¿amst the inte-
rests of tuose living ne^r them It retards their settlement,
keeps puces of land high and tends the newcomers fimher
on, wheiethey can get choice lands without harirg to look up

It m ikes the settlements sparse, and leaver i arse tracts ofun-
