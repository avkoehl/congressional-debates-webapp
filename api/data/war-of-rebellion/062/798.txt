The citizens of East Saint Louis complain that outrages are committed daily by veteran volunteers returning to this State. Citizens and insulted, houses robbed, and lives imperiled daily for want of protection, the officers generally staying at Sain Louis, while the men go to this State. Colonel Oakes, assistant provost-marshal-general for this State, has be troops at his disposal, and, owing to trouble in Coles and Moultrie Counties, none to spare. Can you send provost guard to east Saint Louis for protection of citizens?

Governor Yates is absent, and cannot therefore join us in the request.
