COLONEL: The general commanding directs me to inform you that the cavalry of General Sigel are in Berryville, and that he trusts in a few days to be able to connect your line with that of the troops in Berryville. In the mean time, and until orders are received from General Sigel extending our lines, you are considered as holding the outer picket-line. The orders from the War Department prevent any one from going across our lines south, except by a pass from the Secretary of War. Any one desiring to cross from the south to remain north during the war will be permitted to do so, and will be directed by you to report to the provost-marshal at this place for the purpose of taking the refugee's oath. No other citizens will be permitted to pass either way except by permission from these or superior headquarters.

I am, respectfully, your obedient servant,
