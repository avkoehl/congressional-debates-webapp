THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.                  *         Dec. 30,
always placed under the care of the Treasurei of
the United States alone Now, if the Secretary is
vested with a power by which Congress is protub- ,
ited from acting with h'm.unon what ground can
he call on the President to do it' But the Secre- ¡
tai y says, "The power over the place of deposite I
'for the public money would seam propeily to be
'long to the legislative department of the Govern-
' ment " If this power then belongs exclusively to
the legislative, how does the executive derive any
authority ' Sir, I deny the correct interpretation
of this power as claimed by the Secretary. Con-
gress has not given up its powers over the Treas-
ury of the county How stands the matter, then'
Tne charter of the Bank of the United States says
that the moneys of the United States shall be
deposited in that bank, unless the Secretary shall
otherwise order and direct; and in case of removal
he is to iepjit his reasons. Towhom' Why,to
Congress Why was not the power and absolute
control g.ven to the Secretary himself Why,
because the Secretary is the agent and financial
sentinel of C ingress appointed to watch ovei the
Treasury, and in case prompt action might be
necessary, where the treasure of the nation was in
danger, to remove it to a place of safety, but to
report to Congress his reasons foi so doing. Sir,
does not all this prove that Congi ess intended that
the Secretary should act m obedience to the in-
junctions contained in the charter of the bank,
and upon the obligation of giving the reasons
which led him to the act' It is important to
discriminate between the paities to this con-
tract, the Government and the stockholders of
the bank The powei given for the removal
of the public deposites is a reservation for the
benefit of the people, not the stockholders 1 as-
sume this principle then: that there being two
parties to this cjiarter, which is for the benefit
of the people, those which are for the benefit
of the people Congiess may contiol and mod-
ify as they please. But the Secietary contends
that he alone should exeuise this power Con-
giess has said to the bank, we put the money
of the nation in your keeping, but place it un-
der the care of our agent And was it material
to the bank who that agent should be' or
whether any Secretary should be the agent' It
is no matter to the bank who the agent is Sup-
pose the office of the Secietary of the Treasury
should be abolished, and the duties of his office
were assigned by law to either of the other
Secretai íes, could the bank complain' The Sec-
retary is the mere agent The substance, the
essence is reserved to Congress Suppose a cor-
rupt understanding should be had with the Secre-
tary in relation to the appropriation of the public
money, has Congress no contro' ovei it' Sup-
pose the bank refuses to fulfill its engagements
and is faithless to its trust, has Congress no power
to interpose'
I contend that it is a universal principle in all
contracts that your obligation to fulfill your part
of the covenant rests on mine, and when you fail
to perform on your part I am discharged And
in either pnvate or public contracts when eithei
party fails, the judicial tribunals of the country
must decide fairly and impartially between them
The doctrine of  the Secretary denying the
powers of Congress in this case to be exercised
ia any contingency, I oppose in every view, and
assert that Congress possesses the light now to
withhold the public moneys from the impending
danger.    As to the absolute power contended for
to himself alone, sir, it is contrary to the genius, of
all our laws     I must be allowed to repeat that the ; ■
Secretary is the mere agent of Congress, the mere
substitute of Congress, bound to report to Con- i
gress, responsible only to Congress, and byall the
laws of principal and agent, his powers are no
more extensive than are those whom he is chosen
to represent.   TheSecietary,then, being the mere i
agent, theie comes in another pnnciple applicntle
to the case, and that is, that all agercy is liable to
revocation unless expressly declaied to be irrevo  I
cable     In this case there is no such  clause, no
such provision superadded to the authority, but
the Secretaiy is called the agent in theoidinary
terms    And when, therefore, you have ascertained j
the measure of power of the principal, you have
discovered the utmost stretch oMt which the agent
can exercise.                                                                 i
This brings me to the clause on this subject,
contained in the charter. And heie I will remaik,
that the whole instrument must be expounded
together The whole contract must be interpreted
according to known ruies Then, Congress has
the power to remove the deportes intimes of dan-
ger, and when the piovisions of the chartei have
been violated, but Congress would only have the
right upon the known rules of principal and agent,
and upon one contingency, and that is, a breach o£ 
the contract upon the part of the bank. If we will
look at the whole contract, we shall see that the
bank pays a heavy bonus, engages to transmit the
moneys of the Government from place to place
free ot charge. Theie aie but two stipulations in
'the tontiact to be performed on the part of the
Government The first is, that the bank shall
have the use of the public deposites for twenty
years, and its notes shall be receivable in pay-
ment of debts due the United States. If, then,
the bank has performed its stipulations, both par
ties are bound by their mutual engagements But
suppose at the time of chartering the bank, it had
been proclaimed, we have reserved the power of
removing the deposites, and we give notice that
the Secretary can remove them when he pleases,
and if he letuses to do it, the President may re
move him, if this had been offered to the people,
I ask, sir, would they have subscnbed to the
stock' Would they have risked their property
upon the whim of any man, upon such an aroi-
trary responsibility ' I come, then, to this conclu-
sion, that Congress has not parted with its power,
but may modity U for the benefit of the people,
and to prevent coirupt collusions If all this be
true, the Secretary beingrestiainedm theexeicise
of the power, could only inteifere in cases where
the principal could inteifere
I proceed to the second point in the argument-
the reasons which the Secretaiy has given foi the
removal of the deposites And hereit is necessary
to enter into this discussion with correct views of
these íeasons And fiist, whatever the reasons
are, they ought to be of a financial nature When-
ever Congress gives power to an agent, the extent
of that power must be interpreted by the act giving
him existence If we view the Secretary, then,
as a financial agent, we shall pretty quickly dis-
pose of his íeasons But theie i& another pnnci-
ple which we must take along with us m the dis
cussion The Treasui y Department is not one of
the executive departments ol the Government
Its duties are to Congress, its reports and its re-
sponsibilities are to Congress, and all this without
■acknowledging any assumption of authonty by
the Executive Whenever the Secretary of the
Tieasury is placedunderthedirection ofthe Presi-
dent, it is by the requirements of positive laws,
such as relate to loans, &c With these guides
before us, then, let us examine his reasons The
fiist reason given is the expiration of the charter
The Secretary says, that as the charter has only
about two years and a half to run, it became neces-
sary for him to interfere A gentleman just
appointed, and but three days aftei coming into
office, perceives it necessary to do an act which
ought to require great expenence and observation
to enable him to act rightly Ard was not this a
subject upon which it was proper for Congiess to
exeicise its discretion' Upon what principle d d
the Secretary interfere wi h a case winch was for
the action of Congress alone' Would it not have
been better to have waited sixty d lys' Why
anticipate the appioach of the session, which
was only sixty days oft, ^nd when he had been
only three days in office, remove these deposites,
b eause the charter would soon expire' Sir, he
admits the safety of the deposites, that there is no
d=ngei to be apprehended, and therefore he makes
out no case
Sir, is there a man he-e within the hearing of my
voice who doubts, that when the President issued
his proclamation last September, instead of order
ing a removal of the deposites, he had proclaimed
theie was no doubt of their safety m the bank,
th  stability of the bank, and its capacity to mec.
all its engagements—if this had been done, I siy,
there is no doubt that all the trouble and distress
under which the country is suffering wou.d have
been aveited 'I he despatching of an agent last
summer upon a secret mission made it necessary
for the bank to guard against Bxecuave interfer-
ence Was there no motive for waiting till Con-
gress should convene' Did not i decent respect
for Congiess require that the Secietary should
wa t' Before turning the treasure of the nation
out of doors, he ought to have piocured an ade-
quate place for its security I am sorry to say
there is no doubt of the motive of this precipitate
action Theie is no doubt that the oLjeci. was to
place the public moneys weie Congress could not
restore them or displace them. If the 21 íesolu-
tion pass, or if it pass both branches of Congress,
we shall see what the Secretary will do. The
next reason g ven is, that the selection of the
President has decided this question, and that the
people, by that act, intimated an expression against
the bank Admitting all this for a moment, and
what will it amount to' Nothing more than that
there should be no bank, or that the bank should
not be renewed. But, 1 would ask, was the ques-
tion of the removal of the deposites submitted to
the people of the United States by that act' Why,
sir, this perpetual reference to the reelection of
the President' It seems to be a favorite topic
either with him or the Secetary What right has
the Secretary to look into it and be constantly
recurring to it' Surely the immense majority he
received ought to have satisfied them. It is only
those who lost, who have reason to be dissatisfied.
The winners surely ought to be content 1'or
myselt, sir, I have adopted this rule, when the
election is ovei and it is lost, I give it up, and
think no more about it. 1 recognize in eveiy fiee-
man of this nation the right to vote for whom he
pleases, and do as a freeman ought
But, Mr President, if I show you that the ques-
tion of rechartering the bank or that of the removal
of the deposites were neither of them submitted
to the people of the United States, what beromr s
of the argument of the Secretary on that subjec '
I refer, in the fiist place, to the annual message
of the President in 1829    He says:
"The charter of the Bank of the United States
' expires in 1836, and its stockholders will most
' probably apply for a renewal of then privileges.
'In order to avoid the evils resul'mg from pie-
'cipitancy in a measure involving such important
' punciples and such deep pecuniary interests, I
' feel that 1 cannot, in justice to the parties niter-
'ested, too soon present it to the deliberate con-
' sideration of the Legislature and the people "
His at'ention is next diawn to the suljectin
1830     He says-
" Nothing has occurred to lesson in any degree
' the dangers which many of our citizens appre-
' hend from that institution, as at present organ-
ized In the spirit of improvement and compio-
'mis  which distinguishes our country and its
' institutions, it becomes us to inquire whether it
' be not possible to secuie the advantages s (Forded
' by the piesent bank, through the agency of a
' Bank of the United States, so modified in its
' principles and struc ure as to obviate constilu-
' tional and other objections "
So fai fiom being opposed to any United States
Bank, he admits the practicability of estal lislnng
a national bank based upon the public denosites,
which shall be as useful as the present bank All
this, sn, you ft ill perceive is noncommittal It
does not embody his own opinions, but only those
of a large part of the community He thinks hat
a bank may be so organ zed as to obviate a'l con-
stitutional objec'ions Here, sir, are three mes
seges alluding <o thi- all important subj (,', and if
any man can ascertain fiom them what the opin-
ions of the President were upon it, he must see
tnrougr different soectacles from those i am in the
habit of using. Sir, 1 affitm, that up .o the last
moment when the act for reciiai terms the bank
was passed by Congiess it was unknown what
the Pies,dent would do. 1 do not speak of those
having his confidential ear, but of gentlemen in
Cong-ess     In the message of ]R31, he s*vys:
" Entertair n g the opinions heretofote exp'essed
' in l elation to the B\ik of the United Stales as at
' present organized, Í felt it my duty m my foimer
' messages f anl;ly to disclose them, in order that
' the a tentron of the Legsliture and the people
'should be seasonably directed to that important
'subjec', and that it might be considered and
'finally disposed of in a manner best calculated to
'promote the ends of the Constitution aid sub-
' serve the public interests     Having thus con-
