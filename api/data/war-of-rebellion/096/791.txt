EDWARD MOALE,

Captain, 19th U. S. Infantry, Aide-de-Camp, and A. A. A. G.
HEADQUARTERS TWENTY-FIFTH ARMY CORPS, March 2, 1865-2.50 p. m.

Brigadier General J. W. TURNER,Chief of Staff:

My corps officer of the day having reported that the enemy seemed to present the appearance of a change, I have just been out and find their camps, camp-fires, and pickets as usual. I caused a blank cartridge to be fired from Fort Burnham, which had the desired effect of drawing the curious of the enemy onto their parapets. They did not appear in as large numbers as usual, but this may be owing to the weather. As I have not had a deserter in twenty-four hours, I desire to ask if any came in on the other end of the line, and if the commanding general has any orders to give. I do not believe there is anything in the story.

G. WEITZEL,

Major-General.

DEPARTMENT HEADQUARTERS, March 2, 1865.

Major-General WEITZEL:

You will permit no persons to come through the picket-line on permits from any authority until such permits are submitted to department headquarters. Turn all such back to await action at these headquarters.

E. O. C. ORD,

Major-General, Commanding.

A scouting party, which went out from Harrison's Landing, has just returned, bringing in a rebel lieutenant, of Pickett's division, prisoner. The prisoner states that Fitzhugh Lee is in New Kent County with a brigade of cavalry.
