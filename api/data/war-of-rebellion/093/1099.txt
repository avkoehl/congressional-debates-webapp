Major-General SCHOFIELD,

Commanding Army, or

Major-General WILSON,

Commanding Cavalry:

GENERAL; In obedience to orders from Major-General Thomas, I have ordered the Twelfth Tennessee Cavalry to establish a courier-line between Franklin and Columbia, to clear this part of the country of guerrillas and escort the train of the Twenty-third Corps to Columbia. Under orders communicated to me on the road this morning by Lieutenant Allen, Fourteenth Illinois Cavalry, in charge of courier-line, that all the cavalry on its way to the front should turn off to Rally Hill, I will move from here to that point with the Tenth Tennessee and Seventh Ohio Cavalry.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

ISRAEL GARRARD,

Colonel, Commanding.

HUNTSVILLE, November 27, 1864

Major-General THOMAS:

Cars carrying the Thirteenth Indiana ran off the track last night near Brownsborough, which will cause delay in moving from this place until to-morrow. I can hear of no enemy in country, except guerrillas; have no idea of locality of Hood. The Tenth Indiana Cavalry, which has been stationed at Athens and Elk River, came in last night, and report no enemy in that direction. Negroes by the thousand, from contraband camp, Government plantations and all other plantations, are filling the road for five or six miles behind us. I have ordered them to stop here; they block the road so that the column cannot get along.

R. S. GRANGER,

Brigadier-General.
