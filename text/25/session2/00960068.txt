Arter some brief tbservatiens frcm Mr DAW-
SON on the k solution,
Mr WISE wished to ask whether a report had
m t been tiready made by commissione's appoint-
ed by the Executive. He understood that at least
a t! ousand cases of fraud had been made out, but
w hich had nev er bee i repo-ted to the House. He
said he gathered his information from an agent,
recently leiurned from ami ig the Cherokees, whom
he knew to be a gen It "ia i, ai d any •«titeuierl he

mitted to remain on the land of th/ur lorefathers,
enjoying a 1 the beneñts of our institutions Asa
furlher rea-on why (heir wish shot Id be granted,
Mr W adverted lo their high state of c vibrat on
He thought it highly desirable that the report of the
agent recently arrived from the Cherokees should
be mid  to tht House, in addition to the former
infc rrr it on
Mi DAWSON had no objection whate cr to
si ch a ci urse The object of his resolution was
s mpiy to ? «certain the exact state oi affa t  at that
time in relation to the treaty, and to lay ad the in-
formation before the House
Mr WISE proposed to amend the resolution, by
adding to the end thereof • " also, if anv report has
been made by the agent Safely sent to the Chero-
kees, and it not mcompatib'e with the public inte-
rest, that he communicate said rep rt to this
Ilruse," wh ch modification was accepted.
Mr HOLSEY had no desire to enter into a de-
ba t, on Pus subject, but so ue observations, made
by the gentleman from Virginia, made it his duU
to si\ \fiv wonls inreph That gentleman had
«pi ken o1 the Cherokees as an "oppiesvd people '
Wi bout gong into any argument on the "¡ub-
l°ct, he would simply alltge, that tncy were with n
the j irisdic'ion of the Snte of Gecrg a, ind for hei
policy, Gt rgia held herself re« i0"sible to none but
God and her conscience When the gentleman
"¡poke ío stinngly and feelingly ibont oppresitn,
he evidently hid his eye fixid on he pol cy of*
Georgia H> (Mr H)woull repel the chirges
and ms nuat ons thrown out agiins' the State which
he had the honor of r prcsentmg Tie would tell
him that Georg a would stand upon her rescn ed
rgbts,and would never relinquish tl em He
woul l tell him that the people ol Georgia would
never consent to have naturalized Indians among
them, vvl o, civilized as they vveie said to be, were
not fit to asseciate with free born citizens if the
United Siates What, he would ask, were they to
have a nat on of s mi-barbarons people thrust upon
them, ant fastened forever upon the jurisdiction of
Georgia?   That pobcy w as one w hich -n ould be
' ■                              ■                    .'.                     i,                   ...... i   y      *',
repelled at all hazards, and her people would never
submit to hrve a set of harp es forced upon her, to
prey upon her substance Whenever such an
a tempt should be made, it would meet with a
determined resistance.
Mr. WISE was oí opinion lint ihe gentleman,
in his remarks, had exhibi'ed a great deal of unne-
cessary zeil aWiut Georgia, as, n his observations
on the oppression of the Indians, he had alluded to
the General Government, and not to the State of
Geoigia. He had not "the policy of Georgia in
his ev e," but the Lesislahv e and Executive branches
of the General Government, which were the op-
pressors of the Indians, and by whose officers a
treaty had been forced upon them Ye«, if they
would give him but twelve honest men of the State
of Georgia, he would prove it by that jury that the
treaty had been forced upon the Cherokees in the
face of ihe officers of our own standing army, and
thus incumrg the liability of a war Mr W then
mads some allusions to the farmer and present
policy i f Georgia He contended that notwith-
standing what had been said by ihe member from
that State, about the r-sistance wh'ch would be
made to any Vempt to natural ze the Cherokees, it
was his convict on tnat there was no lawyer in
Geoigia who would deny the right of the General
Government to accomplish it In his opinion, the
Government had just as good a right to make an
Indian a citizen, as an Irishman, and if they were
made citizens, it w ould be no disparagement to the
citizens of Georgia. They had now in the city a
Georgian, w ho was Secretary of Slate, and they
had, a'so, an Indian from Georgia or the Cherokee
tribe, named John Ross, who would, at any ttme,
compare in intellect and moral honesty with John
Torsy h. He wished to know why such Indians as
these were not as eligible to become citizens as the
hordes of foreigner'from the old world The Che-
rokees had assisted n fighting the battles of our
counti" , and had fought side by st le w ith the white
man in the «truggle for her liberies and what rea-
son could be assigned why they should not share m
its beneficial results'"
Mr GLASCOCK regretted that any unnecessary
discussion had arisen on the resolution offered by
his colleague He understood the motives of his
colleague were simply to put the House m posses-
sion of the instruction which was needed, and to
let the people of Georgia know what they might
expect from the General Government in relation to
the fulfilment of the treaty, and their peculiar
situation He ícgreUel that his colleague should
nave deemed it necessary to allude to the remarks
of the gentleman from Virginia, (\ir Wise,) but
as 1he poht-y of Georgia had been attacked, he
would observe that Georgia had as urned a ceitam
line of conduct in relation to the Cherokees, and
she would at all haza ds, purine lhat policy It
seemed to him, that if the gentleman had any mea-
sure to propose in relation to John Roas, cr the
natuiahza'ion of toe Indians, the mofl proper
course would be to bung n a «pecrl bill for that
pirpose, as it was to ally irrelevant and uncon-
nected with the present question AYith regaid to
the intellect of John Ross, he was willing to admit
t'i it he was a man of excel'ent judgment, but when
an attempt was made to oomp?re ! ím «ith the
Secretary of State, he thought n a most extiatrdi-
mry compan on coming fiom a mn oi such dis-
cernment as the gentleman from Virginia
Bill the pot pie t f Georg a w ere anxious to know
«ha1 conrs" the General Government intended to
pursii , in order tnat tney might take then own
treasures accordingly The l-eitj having been
made, Georgia expec ed a'l 'be faci'ilv in ihe power
of Government t > carry u into effect, and that all
the requisite assistance would be gianted by the
Secret iry of War
The gentleman talked about fraud and oppres-
sion but he vvculd ask hin ll this were the proper
occasion for such a charge, now that the treaty had
received the sanction of both Houses, and become
the law of the 'and' If he recollected right, the
gentleman from Virginia himself voted in favor of
the treaty.
Mr WISE No I beg to say that such was
not ihe case    I hauled it tor four y ears.
Mr   GLASCOCK.   Well, it received the sane-
