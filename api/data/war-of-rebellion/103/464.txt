taken by the Fourth Michigan Cavalry under my command in the engagement of the 2nd instant, which resulted in the capture of the city of Selma, Ala.:

The regiment moved from camp, one mile north of Plantersville, on the morning of the 2nd with a fighting force of 420 men and 24 officers, and an aggregate strength of 444. It being the rear regiment of the brigade that day nothing of interest above the ordinary incidents of a march occurred until arriving in front of the fortifications of the city of Selma, which point it reached about 1 p.m. having marched a distance of twenty-two miles. The regiment was immediately formed in line, and I received orders from Colonel Minty, commanding brigade, to prepare to fight on foot, and moved the regiment out dismounted for that purpose; but before being assigned a position in the line I received orders countermanding the former and directing me to move the command back to the horses, and to hold it in readiness to mount at a moment's notice and to charge with the saber as soon as the enemy's line should be broken, and in this position the command was held for the space of nearly two hours, and until a few minutes before the assault was made upon the enemy's position, when I received orders from Colonel Minty to move the regiment out dismounted to act as support to the battery then in position on a slight eminence to the left of the road leading into the city, and to the left of our line of battle as then formed, with directions to remain and support the battery, and maneuver the command as circumstances might require. In this position the regiment drew for a few minutes the fire or both the enemy's guns operating in front of the Second Division, but by a flank movement of one battalion that range of on of the enemy's guns was avoided, but the regiment continued to receive the special attention of the other gun up to the moment of the commencement of the assault upon their works. The command acted in this capacity until the first line of works was fully in possession of our forces, and the enemy pushed back into the woods in rear of their breast-works when I received orders from General Wilson to press forward and attack in flank that portion of the enemy's lines confronting the Fourth Division and on our left, and which still disputed its entrance to the works; but before reaching the point of attack I received orders from Colonel Minty (at the front) to mount the regiment and move forward as fast as possible. The horses were immediately ordered forward, but before they arrived I received a second order from General Wilson to move up the main road dismounted to charge the enemy's second line of works, from which a portion of our line had suffered a repulse. The regiment was formed for the charge about sixty rods in front of the rebel line, with its right resting on the road, with the Third Ohio Cavalry on our right. The order to advance was given and most splendidly executed the whole line moving with the precision of a parade, and the sturdy bravery thus displayed proved too much for the weak-kneed Johnnies, for before we reached the breast-works they broke and fled in the wildest confusion, leaving naught of the chivalrous garrison save a lame and decrepit chaplain to reward our efforts. I immediately broke the regiment in column and pushed forward at double-quick until we reached the heart of the city, where we succeeded in capturing 152 prisoners, and met the advance of the Fourth Division just entering the town from the other side. The casualties in the regiment were one wounded by shell, Edmund Ludlow, Company E, in arm, severely. I cannot close this report without adding my evidence of the noble conduct and soldierly bearing of those under my command; and especially would I mention the names of Major Eldridge, Captain
