Brevet Major-General EMORY,

Commanding Nineteenth Army Corps:

GENERAL: The major-general commanding directs that you have your corps under arms at daylight to-morrow morning, and everything hitched at the same time, to remain so until 8 a. m.

Very respectfully,

JAS. W. FORSYTH,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Chief of Staff.

(Same to Major-General Crook.)

CUMBERLAND, MD., November 12, 1864.

Major-General CROOK,

Strasburg, Va.:

Information has been received that the rebels intend a cavalry raid on the line of road at point or points, perhaps, near Paw Paw, or west of it. The cavalry force here is very small, and if the Lost River Valley could be scouted from your camps at Cedar Creek, you could gain information of their movements in time to notify General Kelley here, and he could be ready to meet their movements. They will probably come from the vicinity of Moorefield or Wardensville. Colonel Latham's expedition with 200 cavalry dispersed them this week at Moorefield and vicinity.

ROBT. P. KENNEDY,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
