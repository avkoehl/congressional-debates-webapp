General DWIGHT:

GENERAL: The major-general commanding directs that you move the brigades of your division from Summit Point and Stephenson's Depot to this place at as early an hour as practicable to-morrow, and that with your whole division you move from here to Kernstown. You will please fill your supply and ammunition trains and move with three days' rations and at least forty rounds of ammunition on the persons of the men. Your command will be relieved by dismounted cavalry from Pleasant Valley.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

C. H. MORGAN,

Brevet Brigadier-General of Volunteers.

Brigadier-General STEVENSON,

Harper's Ferry:

The major-general commanding directs you to make arrangements at once to send a force of dismounted men from Remount Camp to Halltown, Charlestown, Summit Point, and Stephenson's Depot, say 500 well armed at each place. Send them by rail. The troops at these points will be moved at an early hour to-morrow to the front. Dispatches will be sent you to-night.

C. H. MORGAN,

Brevet Brigadier-General of Volunteers and Chief of Staff.

HARPER'S FERRY, April 3, 1865.

Brigadier-General MORGAN,

Chief of Staff:

The arrangements for the dismounted cavalry to move are made. They will move at daylight: Sixth Pennsylvania Cavalry, 600, to Stephenson's; Second Massachusetts, 500, to Summit Point; 500 to Charlestown; 500 to Halltown. I have arranged also for Sixth West Virginia Cavalry to go to Opequon bridge if the general desires it, thinking perhaps Opequon bridge may have escaped his attention, not being mentioned in telegram.

Respectfully,

JOHN D. STEVENSON,

Brigadier-General.
