I have just received information from a spy that the guerrillas are committing numerous depredations on south side of river fourteen miles below here. If I have permission to cross I will hunt them down.

GLASGOW, March 28, 1865.

Brigadier-General FISK:

The bushwhackers, or part of them, are reported as having crossed the river in Carroll County. I started Lieutenant Self on Sunday night with a force to patrol the river, with instructions to send spies to the other side and learn the state of affairs. Have not heard from him.

P. EDW. CONNOR,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF IOWA,Dubuque, Iowa, March 28, 1865.

Major General J. POPE,

Saint Louis:

GENERAL: In conversation with you some time ago I understood you to say that you intended the four companies of the Seventh Iowa Cavalry to form part of the garrison of the new post to be established. This battalion has been under orders to hold themselves in readiness to march to Nebraska. I hope their services may not be needed there, as I intend them to form a part of the expedition, and if you still intend they shall form part of a garrison to a post they can be left there. Should they be sent out of my district I will have trouble to get together twelve companies of cavalry, for I will only have that number in my command that I can order, one company being out of my reach.

With respect, your obedient servant,

ALF. SULLY,

Brigadier-General.
