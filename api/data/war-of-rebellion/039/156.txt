enemy's communications, while General Hooker, with his main army, crossed the Rappahannock and the Rapidan above their junction, and took position at Chancellorsville. At the same time General Sedgwick crossed near Fredericksburg, and stormed and carried the heights.

A severe battle took place on May 2 and 3; and on May 5 our army was again withdrawn to the north side of the river. From want of official data, I am unable to give any detailed accounts of these operations, or of our losses.

It is also proper to remark in this place that from the time he was placed in command of the Army of the Potomac till he reached Fairfax Station, on June 16, a few days before he was relieved from the command, General Hooker reported directly to the President, and received instructions directly from him. I received no official information of his plans or of their execution.
