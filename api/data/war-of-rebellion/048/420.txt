HEADQUARTERS ARTILLERY BATTALION, January 19, 1864.

GENERAL: In accordance with orders from headquarters artillery Second Corps, I have the honor to make the following "report of the operations of my command during the last fall, from the time of its leaving the line of the Rapidan River to its return to the same:"

We left Raccoon Ford, where we had been on picket, about 7 p.m. on the 8th of October, 1863, and reached camp near Pisgah Church about 2 a.m. On the 9th, we marched in the direction of Madison Court-House, via Orange Court-House, crossing the Rapidan at Barnett's Ford, distant about 3 miles from Orange Court-House, and camped in the vicinity of Jack's Shop, in Madison County. On the 10th, we marched, via Madison Court-House, in the direction of Culpeper Court-House. On the 11th, we reached the Sperryville turnpike at Hazel River bridge, about 8 miles northwest of Culpeper Court-House, and camped for the night. On the 12th we marched toward Culpeper Court-House for some miles and then bearing to the left we crossed Hazel River and encamped near the village of Jeffersonton.

On the 13th, we marched, via Warrenton Springs, where we crossed the Rappahannock River, toward Warrenton, camping within 3 miles of that place. On the 14th, we marched through Warrenton in the direction of Bristoe Station, on the Orange and Alexandria Railroad. We remained in camp near Bristoe Station until the 16th, when we moved along the railroad to Warrenton Junction. On the 17th, we moved to within 4 miles of the Rappahannock River. On the 18th, we reached the river, which we crossed at daylight on the 19th near the railroad bridge, and moved thence to Culpeper Court-House. Receiving orders to camp near this place, we did so, and on the 21st moved to camp near Stevensburg, which we occupied until November 4, Captain J. L. Massie's battery being on picket at Kelly's Ford. On the 4th of November, we moved back to the vicinity of Slaughter's Mountain, leaving the above-mentioned battery a Kelly's Ford.

On the 7th, the enemy having effected a crossing, with a considerable force, at Kelly's Ford, Captain Massie, after a brisk skirmish, retired his battery about 1 mile. A copy* of his report, addressed to myself, you will please and herewith inclosed. An official report of the engagement was also forwarded by Major Thomas Jefferson Page, jr., commanding the artillery at Kelly's Ford, to Colonel J. Thompson Brown, acting chief of artillery, Second Corps.

The remainder of the battalion marched to Stevensburg on the night of the 7th,and encamped near that place, but received orders during the night to move to the foot of Pony Mountain, on the northwest side, and await orders. Reaching this point about daylight on the 8th, Captain Massie's battery having rejoined the battalion, we received orders about 2 p.m. to take the position occupied by Lieutenant-Colonel Carter's battalion, about half a mile northeast of Pony Mountain, during the morning. We remained in the position
