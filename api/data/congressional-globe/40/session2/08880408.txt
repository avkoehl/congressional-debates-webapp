RECAPITULATION.
Meceipts and expenditures for fiscal year ending June

There are several striking inferences to be
drawn "from the foregoing exhibits which I
have made:
1. The average annual cost of carrying on
the Government during the (bur years imme-
diately preceding the war of the rebellion, in-
cluding the interest upon the public debt, ivas
$68,159,756, and, exclusive of the interest, it
was $65,291,452, while the average cost of
carrying on the Government since the war has
been, including interest on the public debt,
$415,552,712, and the average annual cost,
exclusive of the interest, was $270,796,803.
2. Leaving out the interest on the national
debt it costs, on an average, $211,505,350
more each year to carry on the Government in
time of peace than it did during the last Dem-
ocratic Administration. That is to say, it costs
considerably more than three times as much,
and counting in the interest on the public debt
it costs sis times as much.
3. The expenditures during the year just
ended were greater than the year before by
overthirty-two million dollars, ($32,448.937 50. J
4. While the expenditures the last fiscal
year were so much greater than the year before,
the revenue of the Government was less by
nearly eighty-five million dollars, ($84,732,-
488 20.)
5._ The national debt has increased about ten
million dollars in the month of May, which is
the last Sidiith of which we have any official
account.
6. In the same month of May the gold in-
terest-bearing debt has increased over fifty
millions, ($57,449,550,) and the coin in the
Treasury decreased m the same time over six-
teen millions. These facts may be seen in the
published statement of the Secretary of the
Treasury for that month.
Nor is all this the worst,. The prospect
ahead is still more threatening, as I shall show
by ikeintroduction of a few more official figures.
The Secretary of the Treasury, in his official
estimate of the expenditures for the next fiscal
year, ending June 30,1869, sets them down as
follows;
For thecivil service, including the expenses of for-
eign intercourse, courts, loans, public domain, and
all other expenditures except l'or pensions, Indian,
and War and the Navy Departments $37,860,400 03
For pensions  30,330,000 00
For Indian department  3,210,152 86
For Army proper  51,039,134 20
For Military Academy  335,012 00
For fortifications, armoii.es, &e  3,778,084 00
For harbor and river improvements,
public buildings, &e ;  8,233,769 88
For naval establishment  47,317,183 95
For miscellaneous objects, including
theespensesof collecting thorevenue
from customs  9,059,000 00
For compensation to the Post Office
Department for mail services  700,000 00
For civilization of Indians  10,000 00
For arming and equipping the mihtia.. 200,000 00
For bounties, per acts of July 26 and
28,1806  25,500,000 00
For interest on the public debt  129,078,078 50
For the service of the fiscal year ending
June 30, 1S69, but payable out of
unexpended appropriations on ac-
countof War, Navy, cn'ilservice. &c. 24,609,184 58
Total estimated expenditures 8372,000,000 00
Supposing the revenue of the Government
from all sources for the next year will be the
same as the last, we should have $405,794,-
459 29 to meet these expenditures, which would
leave a surplus over expenditures of nearly
thirty-four million dollars. But certain sources
of internal revenue have been cut off by the
repealing acts of Congress, such as the tax on
raw cotton, and certain taxes on manufactured
articles. From this cause the chairman of the
Committee of Ways and Means of the House of
Ilepresentatives has estimated there will be
a falling off of $08,709,000 from the receipts
of internal revenue, which last year were
$190,000,000. His language is as follows:
" The revenuo, therefore, from internal taxes for
tlic next fiscal year, assuming all other matters in
respect to taxes and administration in this branch of
the revenue service to remain unchanged, must
necessarily be predicated on the basis oi theaggregate
receipts of the current fiscal year, less theaiuountof
taxes abated or repealed during the present session
of Congress, or .$190,000,000-$68,769,000-4121,331,000."
If, then, there should be this anticipated fall-
ing off of internal revenuo without a correspond-
ing increase in some other direction it is plain
that the end of the next fiscal year will prob-
ably disclose a deficiency of nearly thirty-five
millions of income below expenditures—a most
discouraging contemplation for a tax-ridden
people, and if realized, a most disastrous blow
to the national credit at home and abroad.
The chairman of the Committee of Ways
and Means anticipates, to be sure, an increase
of revenuo under the operation of the new tax
bill, if adopted. That anticipation, however,
was chiefly based upon a radical reform pro-
posed by him in the organization of the in-
ternal revenue department, a proposition re-
jected by the House. Under the present sys-
tem, as 1 shall proceed to show, there can be
no well-founded hope of essential improve-
ment,
REVEXUE FP.ACDS.
The revenues are not honestly collected, and
under the operation of the present system the
business has been constantly advancing from
bad to worse. Illicit manufactures and con-
traband merchandise everywhere abound. The
people pay the price, including the supposed
tax added on. But the superadded amount
for the tax, which ought to hare been paid to
the Government, goes into the pockets of the
ring. As during the war, enormous fortunes
are still made by cheating the Government,
and the thieves generally escape. The laws
seem to have been made for their protection.
It is estimated that about one hundred mil-
lion gallons of whisky is manufactured in the
country, counting all that is produced by the
distilleries, great and small, engaged in the
business. If so, the tax of two dollars a gal-
lon ought to have realized to the Government
a yearly revenue of $200,000,000. Instuad of
that the highest revenue from that souree has
been $80,000,000, and it has now dwindled
down to $18,(KM),000 for the last year.
EFFECT or THE MVIL-T^SUBS ACT.
Under the operation of the civil-tentjre act,
which was invented by the party in power to
baffle the Executive and keep their frifends in
office at any sacrifice, it is not possible foi* the
President to protect the public from the depre-
dations of dishonest officials. The power has
been taken from the President, and there is no
longer any responsibility anywhere.
Every practical man must recognize the fre-
quent necessity of prompt removals from office,
and especially in regard to those officers which
are connected with the management and col-
lection of the public revenues. As the law
now stands, the President, who ought to be
the responsible head, has been stripped of all
anthority to remove until the Senate have first
deliberated and given their consent. ' He1 can-
not even suspend except in the i-eeess of the
Senate, and eveh then he must furnish reasons
satisfactory to the Senate at its next session or
the deposed official will again be reinstated.
The effect is to make the appointees of the
Executive, when once in office, independent
of the appointing power. The President is
thus converted into a mere prosecuting officer
and may be defied, baffled, and delayed until
the time for efficient action has passed. Dur-
ing the pendency of such a controversy under
the civil-tenure act before the Senate, a Cabi-
net officer is said to have-written, upon a cer-
tain occasion, to the thieving official, begging
him to consider his conscience and in the
mean time steal as little as possible I The"
greater the office and the extent of its control
over the public interests the more powerful
is the dishonest incumbent in bis means of
defense and in the number and influence of his
confederate friends and allies.
Suppose the President, acting upon reliable
information, attempts to remove the collector
of customs at one of the great ports or a col-
lector of internal revenue in one of the prin-
cipal cities where the tax upon whisky alone
may amount to millions. Immediately upon
the receipt of the telegram which brings the
news the imperiled collector and his whole
force of hireling dependents and confederate
contraband traders, illicit manufacturers, and
venders who compose the ring are astir. As
soon as steam can carry them to Washington
the advance guard of these worthies appears
at the Capitol to light the Government with
its own money. They lie in wait in the ante-
chambers of the Senate. They button-bole
Senators in the streets and capture them at
their hotels and boarding-houses. They are
not in want of help from men and women, too,
of better looks and more alluring manners thau
their own. They bear with them also appoint-
ments to inspectorships and clerkships, if need
be, for family friends of obliging Senators.
'I hey come armed with longlists of respectable
signatures, such as may anywhere be cheaply
got for the asking merely by any gentlemanly
knave who lives in style and spends his money
freely; certificates of leading merchants, law-
yers, and divines.
By the same influences the new man ap-
pointed to the place is assailed from every point.
Here, too, comes in the complication of outside
rival claimants for the office. The President
naturally prefers his own political friends for
appointment. But the Senate, on that very
account, refuses to confirm them, and regard-
less of mental or moral qualifications rejects
them one after another. To get the office,
therefore, it becomes necessary for the appli-
cant to convince the President that he is his
friend, and the Senate must be convinced that
he is secretly the President's enemy. If he
gets both the appointment $nd the confirma-
tion it is because ho has succecded in perstia-
