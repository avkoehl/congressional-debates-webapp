ports, and the statement of David A. Wells,
Special Commissioner of the internal revenue
department, you will find those debts were con-
tracred since 1868. Mr. Wells shows what
the debts of the South werein 1861, and what
they were in 1868. He shows the following
facts:

This has been reduced several millions since the
Democrats obtained power. (See Governor's mes-
sage to the Legislature, October, 1871.)
Texas.
Texas had no debt before tho war.
The comptroller states it, November, 1871, at not
less than  $3,000,000 00
Debts and liabilities, including railroad
bonds, now. (See proceedings of tax-
payers' convention  17,000,000 00

was, as stated by the committee of
that convention  5,361,000 00

Take the statistics made by the gentleman
from Ohio [Mr. Stevenson"] and they show the
increase ot the debts of those States exceed
over two hundred and fifty million dollars in
the last few years.
Now, where has the money gone? Read
the reports. Read the statement as to any of
the States—for example, that of the auditor of
Louisiana. He tells you that the enormous
debt piled on that State was under the pretense
of building railroads, when there is not one
foot of railroad which has been built by that
money. Take the case of Florida, and you will
find there is nothing to show for it there. Take
the case of Alabama, and you will find hundreds
and thousands, yes, millions of dollars, given
to railroads in excess of all they were entitled
to, for the purpose of giving corrupt contracts
to friends of members of the Legislature.

The money has been squandered in that way
and in every other. Take the case of Georgia—
and it is too well known to need mention;
Governor Bullock who was here in attendance
on Congress two years, ago feasting and wining
and dining the Reconstruction Committee and
leading members of Congress, is now a fugi-
tive and cannot be found. His great friend
and banker was Henry Clews, who is now get-
ting up Grant meetings in New York city, and
is the same man who went upon the bond of
Bailey, the defaulting collector of internal rev-
enue for the thirty-second district of New
York, while Bailey is a defaulter to the exteut
of $600,000, and absconded iu March, 1867,
with the name of Henry Clews on his bond.
That bond has not yet been sued, as the rec-
ords show, because, I suppose, Clews is useful
as the subservient tool of the party and is
running the machine for them in New York.
These are only specimens of the men who
have been carrying on these State govern-
ments, and of the way they were managed. I
maintain that this book, then, instead of being
falsely named the "Ku Klux Conspiracy," if
it had been marked as "the report of the out-
rages of congressional carpet-baggers," would
have stated the absolute truth. You all re-
member the case of Alabama. She came here
in the Fortieth Congress with a constitution
which her people had defeated in accordance,
with your own reconstruction laws, and yet she
was not allowed the benefit of her guarantied
rights. You put her into an omnibus bill and
you declared that she was entitled to represent-
ation ; and men who were defeated at the polls
went and took possession of her. Her Legis-
lature, both her senate and her lower house,
was composed of meu all of whom had been
defeated by the people. Her Representatives
iu these Halls were men many of whom had
not set foot on her soil, or if so, only for
temporary purposes. The congressional
emissaries took possession of Alabama, and
her debt was increased from $8,000,000 to
$38,000,000 in three years.; and the senate,
constituted as I have said, declaring that it
had the right to exist for four years longer, has
perpetuated its own power and is now in
power.
How was it in Georgia? She had almost
escaped your thralls. She had elected a Legis-
lature in 1868 that was supposed not to be obe-
dient. The system of plunder under Bullock
and Blodgett, and men of that gang, could not
be carried on; and fellows to suit the Admin-
istration could not get into the Senate of the
United States if that Legislature was permitted
to represent the State. An act was attempted
to be passed by Congress to re-reconstruct
Georgia, but Congress declined to go the length
the President desired. I have here all his
orders and all the proof in regard to it. After
Congress failed to give the President authority
to rereconstruct Georgia, he sent his General
Terry down there, and made him absolute
master by orders which are all set forth in this
report; and that man, by the order of the
President, turned out nineteen duly elected
Democrats and put in nineteen defeated Re-
publicans in order to make the Legislature of
Georgia Republican. He put a man by the
name of Harris, a railroad employS, in the
speaker's chair of the house of .representa-
tives, and so organized that Legislature that
$30,000,000 were stolen from the State by a
Legislature made by the President of the
United States and by his military commander,
General Terry.
I have said on this floor, and I repeat it.
that if Andrew Johnson had been guilty of
one tenth of the enormities of which Pres-
ident Grant was guilty in those acts relative
to Georgia, not only would he have been suc-
cessfully impeached, but he would not have
found one man in the Senate of the United
States, Democrat or Republican, bold enough
to cast a vote for his acquittal. And no man,
although these orders have been brought up
and read, and are here now, no Republican
on the other side to this day has ever dared to
vindicate the President and indorse his con-
duct, or go before the country and say he had
a right to do what he did. At least no man
has ever dared to do so when he could be
replied to.
And yet men will tell me about the good
conduct of the party in carrying on the affairs
of the southern States. Complaint is made by
gentlemen on the other side of the kind of
witnesses by whom we have proved all those
things. And. the distinguished gentleman from
Vermont [Mr. Poland] said we brought up
the Governors, the lawyers, the judges, the
men who knew everything generally, and knew
nothing specially, while they brought up the
particular men who had suffered the wrongs
to prove that these things had occurred. Yes,
sir, we summoned men of intelligence ana
gentlemen; they brought up spies, thieves,
informers, men of tbe most degraded possible
character, many of them unworthy of belief
on oath, and proven to be unworthy of belief
on oath. There was Howie, of North Caro-
lina, the distinguished gentleman who appeared
and claimed to be a Virginian, kin, I believe,
to General Lee.
When he told his tale about outrages, he
excited the whole Ku Klux committee to such
an extent that they thought it important to
proceed to North Carolina at once, where this
man Howie was proved by old Elias Bryant,
a Republican, to be the most unmitigated
scoundrel on the face of the earth, and it was
shown that all his statements about Ku Klux
were false. He was dealt with because he and
two or three strumpets living in the neighbor-
hood where he was had taken a white girl of
fifteen years of age to a house where blacks
and whites—Howie himself the blackest
among them—expected to have that poor girl
for their own vile purposes ; aud because the
neighbors took her away and broke up the
den he came to tell the committee these tales
of horrors. By both whites and blacks he
was proved to be a liar and a scoundrel. And
these are the men that are relied upon, andia
whose charge the soldiers of the United
States are placed to arrest and imprison citi-
zens, as was done by Howie, and a magnifi-
cent Ku Klux case made of it.
A man by the name of Rockafellow, from
Atlanta, of the same character, was also
brought up and proved to be infamous. A
man by the name of Talliafero, from Missis-
sippi, was also brought up, whose record, if I
were to repeat it here, would show that he had
been guilty of crimes which would hardly be
credited. An old and ignorant negro named
Roper was brought up in Alabama to tell
the circumstances of the Huntsville riot. A
thousand white Republicans saw that riot.
It had been investigated by the civil and
military tribunals, and Roper himself had
been indicted for his share in that riot. And
yet this poor old ignorant negro was selected
to blacken the people of Alabama and to tell
what the committee knew was not true at the
time they made him tell his story. I charged
in the committee-room, and I repeat it, that it
was an outrage and a scandal for Senators and
Representatives to bring such a man before
them to testify and to blacken the character
of the people of Alabama.
An old man named Lakin, a preacher,
who was proven to be unworthy of belief,
utterly so, testified in regard to a Ku Klux
baby, while the testimony of the attending
physician is that the child was dead when
born, and decomposed in part. Out of this
Lakin manufactured his story.
Mr. POLAND. Do I understand the gen-
tleman to say that it was proved that Lakin
was an infamous man?
Mr. BKCK. It was.
Mr. POLAND. By whom?
Mr. BECK. It was proved before the sub-
committee at Huntsville, Alabama, by four
