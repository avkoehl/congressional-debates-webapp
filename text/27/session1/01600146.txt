consent to this ad valorem duty? At the last session an hono-
rable gentleman from Massachusetts had stated, if he, Mr. H.
recollected rightly, that the New England States were willing
to allow the compromise act to stand as It now was He
gave full credit to that statement And why? Simply be-
cause it was the interest of those States to allow the compro-
mise act to remain as u was They well knew that any great
increase of the du y would produce the effect it had hither'o
done—that the result would be competition of capital among
themselves, and a competition from one one end of the Blue
llidge to the other, which it would be veiy hard for them to
resist*
But would the compromise act after the year 1842, with the
additional duty of twmty per cent on silks, wines, and lea0,
cover the expenditures of the Government? He would read
the following table.

There was one portion of the gentleman's remarks which he
(Mr H ) had deeply regretted, and he could not but think that,
mhis enthusiasm, the gentleman had-been carried further than
he intended to go He, Mr II alluded to that part of the gen-
tleman's remarks m-which he referred to the cabinet, to the
numbei of suppliants foi office, and to the heads of Depart-
ments, sitting like demigods upon their throne, and treating
with contempt the humble applicants Now, for his own part,
he would say that he had never seen a cabinet moie straightfor

Mi W C TOHNSONsaid (hat by the permission of the gen-
tiemait [Mi Habersham] he would place his (Mr J 's> rt.
marks in a true position, that erroneous mfeiences may not be
di awn from them lie had in his (Mi J's) speech made no
personal attack-, nor did he think of chaigmg coriuption on
any officer of the Government He «poke or the powei nf the
Executive, and its vast influence He had alluded to the past
E\ecu iveaswellas to the piesent, and the memhers of this
committee were no doubt as well impressed with the truth of
his remarks as himself
He spoke of the heads of Department to show what influ-
ence they eould each wield oy patronage And their increased
and mcieasing pationage made those who weie intended to
be m'enor suboidinate officers of Government now caressed,
and daily solicited for favois, as. if they were mimic Prest
dents
Noi did it ever enter his mind to attack the motives of those
who wielded this power or whoicceived its benefits He should
only thin k of doing that when oceasion made it necc^ary So
fai from charging the presen t Executive wnh excess of use of this
dispensing power, he neh «ad mat he felkasjet far short of pub-

afforded the gentleman an opportunity of making the explana

always those who weie ready to misiepiesent statements that
weie made here And to show the gentleman thst he (Mi

wh ch ha I taken place on the bill, he should not have made
any observa'on^ were u not that he should \ ote differently
fiom his colleague, [% Wintbsop,} who spoke yesterday,
and that he probably differed in opinion from all his colleagues
with respect to the bill under consideration, and for theaddi
tienal reason that the Legislature of the State which he repre-
sented in part had passed a series of resolves on the subject of
the distribution of the public lands, which had been pre&ented
to the House during the present session
I shall endeavor (continued Mr P ) to confine mv remail s
mainly to the points presented by my colleague yesterday, wi h
such other views as may naturally arise from that exdiniea
tion I agree with him m his statement that, so far as our
State l* concerned in a pecuniary view, the measure is but t f
li tlemoment Massachusetts nei-dsnoaid of this kind What
she owes she can pay fiom hei own abundant resources, aid
that portion of hei debt which is not vested m safe institutions
is not sufficiently laige to cieate alarm any where We arc,
therefore, m exercising our judgment, peifectly free from any
impoitant question of interest, and can look at the subject with
a «ingle eye to us bearing on the welfare of our common coun
tiy It is true that my colleague incidentally introduced the
subject of a protective tariff, foi which he said he should be an
advocate at all tures If, by a protective tariff, he means dis-
ciimmpting duties, having its whole amount predicated on the
economical wanfs of the Government, I shouli agiee wi h him
so fai as it could be made with propel regard t) the otht r gieat
interests of the nation, and Ii mited by the wants of the Na*jonal
Government to constitutional expendituies The great body
of the citizens of Massachusetts, I believe, lequire no more
They would be pleased, no doubt, to see the necessaries of life,
such as tea, cofíee, and odiei similar articles, free, the amount
of duty added to iron, lead, and other artic'es ofthe kind, for
the benefit of the mmeial regions, and on such things as hat*,
shoes, and o hei things of the like character, to benefit manu-
factuiersand mechanics But this is not the lim** for this día

show the propriety of piovtdmg for the distnbution of three
millions of dolíais annuilly, when the nation was in debt He
remaiked, howevei, that the party with which he acted was
rot responsible for the debt I take issue with him on thaf
point It has been shown, over and over again and the jour
nals of Congiess will prove it, that his party have always voted
for large appropriations to a much greater extent, vety much

The clause in the Constitution has be n cited m relation to
the authority given to Congiebs ovei the terntoiy of the United
State and it issaid there is nothing which prohibits < or res
from distributing the proceeds ofthe public lands—tint it is not
money raised from taxe«, and, therefore, not resting upon the
same ground with them In this case, there can surely be no
diffeiencem the consequences and efiects between distributing
the proceeds of taxes and the withdrawal fiom the public
Tieasury of money which must inevitably be replaced by
