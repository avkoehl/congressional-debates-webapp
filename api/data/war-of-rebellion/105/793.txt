Indians. Indeed, I am of opinion there is not more than a bare supply on the other reservation for the Indians already to suffice until another harvest. Nevertheless, believing that our Government will promptly meet the emergency, I will take the responsibility of saying, send them on, for it is certainly cheaper to feed them than to fight them. Nome Cult is the best provided for at present, therefore the removal should be mostly made to that place. And at the same time allow me to ask in behalf of humanity that orders be given the troops as far as possible to avoid the shedding of blod, and prevent the kidnapers and independent companies from their wholesate theft and massacres, which they are now preparing for in certain quarters.

I have the honor to be, your obedient servant,
