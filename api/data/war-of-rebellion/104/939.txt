Brevet Major-General WILSON,

Commanding Cavalry Corps, Macon, Ga.:

I have the honor to report the return of Captain Clark, acting assistant quartermaster, without any tools. He brought a letter to you from Brevet Brigadier-General Donaldson, chief quartermaster, which I forward to-day. Captain Clark reports the railroad in running order as far south as the Etowah River, and that parties will commence work on the bridge over that stream at once. He says that none of the work on the upper end of the railroad has been done by the Government, but under the supervision of a Mr. Latimer, who says he is acting for the State of Georgia. I am inclined to believe, from the statements of Captain Clark, that the parties at the upper end are working on about the same basis as the party at this end, they having the advantage of unlimited material, without comparatively little to do. The axes, spades, &amp;c., received to-day from Augusta will enable us to do the work to the Etowah, but we yet labor under difficulties from want of spikes, which however, will not be irremediable. I am informed there are two miles of railroad iron (new and straight) at Macon. Unless I have other orders from you I will send for it soon, and shall request you to cause it to be delivered. The iron at Vining's and at Marietta is very badly bent - almost destroyed.

CAPTAIN: I take the liberty of again calling the attention of the general commanding to the helpless condition of very many people in this and neighboring counties. In ten counties, the inferior courts of which are drawing some supplies from the agency in this city, there are from 5,000 to 8,000 families-in all, say, from 25,000 to 50,000 persons-who are utterly destitute of bread or any kind of food. Some adequate steps should be taken to supply this demand for food. Women and children walk from ten to forty miles for food and the obtain only a moiety, frequently not any. Of course the proper source of supply should be in the State government; but as there is no such authority our Government must take the matter in hand or intense suffering will follow. I make this communication not simply in view of present necessities, but also that the brevet major-general commanding may be
