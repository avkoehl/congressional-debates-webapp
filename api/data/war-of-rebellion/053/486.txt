ambulances, hospital stores, and ammunition, and all other supplies that will be required on taking the field. It may be necessary to march before their arrival. You will therefore direct the utmost promptitude, and hold your troops in readiness to march at short notice. This does not conflict with the movement that war ordered yesterday.

MURFREESBOROUGH, October 19, 1863-10 a.m.

Lieutenant ColonelH. C. RODGERS,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Twelfth Army Corps:

Order relating to Second Brigade will be attended to. What provision will be made for the line thus vacated and the two companies of that brigade now at Shelbyville? To supply the deficiency from this post will, I deem from its importance, weaken it too much. It would be better to move one of Candy's Pennsylvania regiments this way. Answer.
