Your telegram of the 2nd instant, instructing me to keep secret the facts in your letter of the 31st ultimo, was duly received, but the letter referred to has not yet reached me.

From all the indications I am led to believe the enemy is retreating in a southwest direction from Prestonburg toward the Cumberland Gaps. How far in that direction shall I be permitted to follow him?

Very truly, your obedient servant,

J. A. GARFIELD,

Colonel, Commanding Brigade.

HEADQUARTERS EIGHTEENTH BRIGADE,Prestonburg, Ky., January 11, 1862.

I left Paintsville on Thursday noon with 1,100 men, and drove in the enemy's pickets 2 miles beyond Prestonburg. The men slept on their of the enemy at the Forks of Middle Creek, under command of Marshall. Skirmishing with his outposts began at 8 o'clock, and at 1 o'clock p. m. we engaged his force of 2,500 men and three cannon posted on the hill. Fought them until dark. Having been re-enforced by 700 men from Paintsville, drove the enemy from all their positions. He carried off the majority of his dead and all his wounded. This morning we found 27 of his dead on the field. His killed cannot be less than 60. We have taken 25 prisoners, 10 horses, and a quantity of stores. The enemy burned most of his stores and fled precipitately.

To-day I have crossed the rive, and am now occupying Prestonburg. Our loss 2 killed and 25 wounded.

PAINTSVILLE, January 8, 1862.

(Via Portsmouth, Ohio, 14th.)

I entered this place yesterday with the Forty-second Ohio and Fourteenth Kentucky and 300 Second Virginia Cavalry. On hearing of my approach the main rebel force left their strongly-entrenched camp and fled. I sent my cavalry to the mouth of Jennie's, where they attacked and drove the rebel cavalry, which had been left as a vanguard, 5 miles, killing 3 and wounding a considerable number. Marshall's whole army is now flying utter confusion. He has abandoned and burned a large amount of his stores. We have taken 15 prisoners. Our loss was 2 killed and 1 wounded. I start in pursuit to-morrow morning.
