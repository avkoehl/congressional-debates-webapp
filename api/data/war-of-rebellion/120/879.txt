Captain W. S. WINDER,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Andersonville, Ga.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE SOUTH,Hilton Head, S. C., September 26, 1864.

Major General H. W. HALLECK, U. S. Army:

GENERAL: I have taken pains to ascertain more about the employment of our soldiers, now prisoners, on fortifications in Charleston Harbor, and the result is that what I wrote to you yesterday is fully substantiated. Most of the men are at work in rear of Mount Pleasant. The worst feature in the case is that many of our men have been induced, by the hopelessness of their condition, by their misery and starvation, to take the oath of allegiance to the Southern Confederacy. Tho what extent this has gone I do not know, but the cases are becoming very frequent.

Respectfully and truly, yours,

J. G. FOSTER,

Major-General, Commanding.
