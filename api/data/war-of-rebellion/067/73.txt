General Grant at first determined. Tyler's division is to take in the Second Corps the place of the division of Mott, now incorporated as a brigade in Birney's division. All the reserve artillery, both of the Army of the Potomac and Ninth Corps, has been sent to Belle Plain. It was a useless incumbrance. In this heavily-wooded and broken country no great maneuvering of artillery can be employed.

SPOTSYLVANIA COURT-HOUSE, May 18, 1864-5 a.m. (Received 10 a.m.)

The report of General Wright, who had reconnoitered the ground over which our proposed attack upon the enemy's right was to be made caused General Grant to change the plan detailed in my dispatch of last evening. Instead of attacking on our left Hancock and Wright have made a night march to our right flank, and attacked at daylight upon the same lines where Hancock made his successful assault on Thursday last. We have as yet no news of the result. Warren's guns opened a heavy fire upon the rebel lines at the Court-House at 4.30.

HDQRS. NEAR SPOTSYLVANIA, May 18, 1864-12 m. (Received 4.20 p.m.)

Hancock and Wright made their attack this morning in good style, forced the first and the second lines of rebel rifle-pits, and for a time were confident that at last they had struck the lair of the enemy, but advancing through the forest each corps presently found itself confronted by heavy interior works, protected, especially in Hancock's line of advance, by impassable abatis. Barlow's division, of Hancock's corps, attempted in vain to charge through this obstacle, and held their ground before it for storming the rebel intrenched camp on that side being evidently of the most extreme character, and both corps having artfully, but unsuccessfully, sought for a weak point where they might break through, Grant, at 9 o'clock, ordered the attack to cease. Wright was directed to march back to his former position on our left, and Tyler's division, of Hancock's corps, to take post in his rear. Warren maintained a vigorous artillery duel with the rebel batteries around the Court-House until 11 o'clock, when both parties ceased firing. Our losses by the morning's work are reckoned by General Meade at 500 killed and wounded. General Grant has issued his orders for another movement which he has for several days had in contemplation, but which he did not wish to try till after last attempt to get the enemy out of his stronghold by attacking it on one of its flanks.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,Secretary of War.
