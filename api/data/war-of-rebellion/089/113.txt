I should have said signal tower instead of Deep Bottom. Kautz is ordered up. You can dispose of him as may be of most use.

General WEITZEL:

Do you see anything on the left that looks like a demonstration, or is it only mortar firing? If they are massing troops at all there this move on the right may be the feint, but I am inclined to think not.
