pike, and I have my force in readiness to concentrate at either of them should the enemy attempt a crossing. There is also an excellent ford six miles up the river, which, though well guarded by me, are too far for me to prevent the enemy crossing, if I guard those near me as they should be guarded. The enemy can approach the fords six miles up the river and the two six miles down by a short cut of three miles. I hear nothing of the enemy at either of the other fords.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

E. T. WELLS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
