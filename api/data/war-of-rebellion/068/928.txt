Can you not occupy the Quesenberry house with a brigade? It will be a good point from which to observe the movements of the enemy.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

Major-General.

MAY 19, 1864.

Major-General BURNSIDE, Ninth Army Corps:

After occupying the Quesenberry house, push picket out to the Po River, if you can, and drive in the rebel pickets until you find the end or right of the enemy's main line. You want to get, if possible, where their movements can be observed, and if they move away, we want to follow close upon them. Push pickets also good distances on the roads east and southeast from you.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
