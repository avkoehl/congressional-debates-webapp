enough. I should like your views before giving him orders. I think we ought to attack as early as possible in the morning-Smith, yourself, and Hancock; Warren also. If we give them any time they will dig so as to prevent any advance on our part. Whereas a vigorous attack, if successful, may throw them the other side of the Chickahominy, and may secure a crossing for us. Let me have your views as soon as possible.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS SIXTH CORPS,June 1, 1864-10.20 p. m.

General HUMPHREYS:

I think Hancock should come here and take position on my left and partly in my support. With his aid at daylight I think we might succeed in carrying the rest of the enemy's works, or at any rate extending our line to the Chickahominy without scattering too much. I shall be ready to renew the attack as soon as he is in position. He should get here before daylight, or I may lose what I have gained.

H. G. WRIGHT,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,June 1, 1864-10.45 p. m.

Major-General WRIGHT:

So soon as General Hancock arrives at Cold Harbor, or within supporting distance of you, you will renew the attack on the enemy's position. General Hancock was ordered to withdraw at dark, but as he had his whole corps in line of battle close up to the enemy, and has the same distance to march that you had last night, it is not to be expected that he can reach your position by daylight, though I have no doubt he will be there by 6 or 7 in the morning. He will be directed to take position with part of his forces on your left, and to attack the enemy as promptly as possible. General Smith will also be directed to attack at the same time.

Respectfully, yours,

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.

I send a dispatch* for General Smith, which you will please forward to that officer and acknowledge receipt of this.
HEADQUARTERS SIXTH CORPS,June 1, 1864-11.25 p. m.

Major-General MEADE:

Your telegram of 10.45 has been received; also one for General Smith, which has been forwarded to him by one of his staff officers.

H. G. WRIGHT,

Major-General.
