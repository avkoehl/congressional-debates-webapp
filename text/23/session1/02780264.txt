property and liberty are as dear as they can be to
any others, by men who, at the same time that
they suffer, have the sagacity to discover the cause
of their sufferings, the boldness to declare that
cause, and the firmness to bear up under those
Bufferings, and support the policy of the Adminis-
tration of their choice, because they believe that
policy best calculated to promote the great and
permanent interest of the Republic. In other

Mi CLAY said he had just heard through the
public prints that one of the incorporated banks
i of Maryland, situate in Baltimore, had failed
He had also heard that in consequence of a sup
I posed connexion between that bank and the Union
I Bank of Miiyland, one of the banks selected by
the Secretary of the Treasuiy as a depository of
the public money in  that city, a great run was
made upon that selected bank yesterdiy for «ppcie
He had been informed that the Secietary of the
1 Tieasury was a stockholder to some extent, he did
not know how much, m the Union Bank, and
there might be great danger to the public moneys
now on deposite there He hoped it would turn
out the Union Bank was safe, and that the Secre-
tary was not a stockholder to such an amount that
his interest could be supposed to have induced him
to select that bank as a depository of the public
money He h-d also heard that in apprehension
of a run on the Orion Bank, a Treasury draft had
been issued m its favor for $150,000 to that bank,
and it aas the duty of the Senate to look into i 
He had therefore prepared the following íesolu-
tion, which he hoped no gentleman would object
to being adopted immediately.
Resolved, That the Secretary of the Treasury
be directed to report to the Senate what amount
of public money is now on deposite m the Union
Bank of Maryland, on what account it was de-
posited, and whether any Treasury drafts, contin-
gent or other, have been, during the month of
March, 1834, furnished to the said bank to enable it
to meet any demands which might be madeupon it
Mr FORSYTH said, if the. gentleman had in-
troduced the resolution without any remarks, he
could have had no objection to it But after what
had been said by the gentleman, he thought we
ought to have sometime to see the íesolution It
was said the Secretary of the Tieasury was a
stockholder in the Union Bank—he knew nothing
to what extent, buthehad nohesitation msaying
that the interest of the Secretaiy, wheiever it
might be, had mt the si ghtest effect on him in
selecting the bank as one of the public deposito-
ries
The resolution lies one day

BANK OF THE UNITED STATES.
The VICE PRESIDENT having announced
the special order to be Mi Wfbster's motion
for leave to bring in a bill to recharter the Bank o(
the United States for six years—
Mi WHlTEresumed,and concluded his argu-
ment against the bill
Mr WEBSTER then took the floor, and said
that he had not expected that on a motion for
leave to bring in a bill, such a protracted debate
would have ensued If he had foreseen it, he
would have been restrained from interfering with
the discussion upon the resolutions of the gentle-
man from Kentucky In his judgment, any relief
for the present distresses of the country must be
cained thiough Congress bv the action of public
opinion out of doois Such was the distracted
state of the community, that no relief could be
expected till public sentiment gives a direction to
some specific measuies And with this object he
had moved foi leave to introduce this bill, with a
view to action upon it in due season hereafter
But it had become the subject of debate, and if it
went on, on a motion for leave, other topics were
likely to be introduced into it It was with great
reluctance he interrupted the debate, but he could
not consent to a thing so-extraordmaiy, he be-
hoved it was the first time such a thing had ever
occuned There had been nothing like it since
he had been in the Senate He was constrained,
therefore, to endeavor to make disposition of it
His ob)ect was to place the proposition for relief
before the countiy He therefoie moved to lay
the subject on the table, and intimated his irten-
tion to call it up again on the first Monday in May
next
On this motion,
Mr FORSYTH asked the yeas and nays—
which were ordered, and are as follows, to wit
