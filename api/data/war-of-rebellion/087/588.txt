except the One hundred and seventy-ninth New York. The regiments of that line had seized the house and grounds around it and fought bravely, and with a determination to hold the position, but being furiously attacked on three sides by superior numbers they were compelled to abandon the place, losing heavily and having some of their men captured. Forced to retire in haste, they did so in some disorder, and being closely followed by the enemy in force the whole line was carried away. Every effort was made to rally the troops, and a stand was finally made at the Pegram house, and the enemy checked and repulsed. During the night the main body of the troops was withdrawn to the rebel line of works near the Peebles house, which was fortified for defense, leaving a picket-line at the Pegram house.

Early on the morning of the 1st of October that line of pickets was attacked and driven in and a few captures made. On the 2nd of October we again advanced to the Pegram house, where my command took up a position on the left of the First Brigade, where it has remained until the present time. On the 4th of October the enemy made a sudden attack on my pickets, capturing Lieutenant Monroe Evans, Second New York Mounted rifles, and 6 men, and driving the line back for a short distance. One regiment (the Second Maryland Veteran Volunteers) was promptly sent out to re-establish the line, which was immediately accomplished without loss. On the 8th of October a reconnaissance was made by General Willcox on my left, and my picket-line was advanced to correspond with that movement, supported by two regiments from the main line. The reconnaissance ended, the line was withdrawn to its previous position, and the regiments returned to camp.

I inclose herewith a list of the casualties for the time embraced in this report with names of the officers, killed, wounded, and missing.

With much respect, I have the honor to be, your obedient servant,

S. G. GRIFFIN,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

Captain SAMUEL WRIGHT,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Second Div., Ninth Army Corps.
