WAR DEPARTMENT, Washington City, March 22, 1865-4.30 p. m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

Your account of the way Crook talked on his return from Richmond, and other circumstances, induce me to suggest a careful consideration of the propriety of giving him a command so important as that of your cavalry. For that reason I ordered him to report to you without indicating any specific duty to which he was to be assigned. With this suggestion the matter is left entirely to your own judgment. Anything you may do in regard to it will be approved.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, March 22, 1865-10.30 a. m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

Twenty-two deserters yesterday; twenty are reported this morning. No movements. The whole Confederate army appear to have had two days' cooked rations and told to be on the alert; I think due more to an expected attack from us than any projected movement on their part. I regret to state eight desertions to the enemy are reported last night-six substitutes from the Ninth Corps and two from the Sixth. Sharp picket-firing last night on Ninety Corps front.

GEO. G. MEADE,Major-General.
