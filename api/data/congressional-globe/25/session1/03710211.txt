Magistt ate i
Mr Chairman, I shall maite no professions of
unbounded confidence in anv man    I will not say
that I have moie, or that I have less confidence m
Mr Van Buren than m other men , but, sir, this is
a power which I would not have committed to
George Washington himself, 01 any man that evei
lived, or now lives    Su, I will not commit mj
liberty to the keeping of any man     I fear all    II
the people intend to preserve their liberties   hey
should not ejmm.it them to the keeping of an^ man
but keep them under their ov n immediate c^-e and
protection    A wise man said   ' etet nal watch/u,lnpss
is the price which the people pay for liberty     Sir
I warn them to watch, and that incessantly, if they
do not fearul will be the consequences  Mr Chair-
man, the patronage of the Executive is already suf
liciently laige for fhe satetyof oji free mstitut ons
and I am not wi'lmg to enlarge if     While on this

his hands1   Su ii he wants money, he has only to
demand h at the hands ot its keepers     If they re
fuse, he has nothing to djbut to exercise his consti
tutional power of removal and then every oostacle
íswithdiawn     And wha security have we, that
m the course of time, «une sueh man may not, in
the hour of popular infatuation and delusion   be
ele ated to the Exeru ive char?    None  sir   for
history affords the important lesson   that every
tyrant, who has ever overfhiown thehbeuiesof his
country has done it under the nollow  piofessions
of the good of tiv p°o i¡" an I have oí en n ade the
people the deluded i íctims of their own destruction
It is enough for m  to see this bi'l plac< s m the
handsof the Executive poweis wh ch mav be easi
ly perverted to the most dangerous purposes     To
oppose it, although those who propose and those
who advocate it may not have and I am suie en
tertam no such design    But, si-  one ot the pana
ceas held out tor the dangers which I íave adverted
to, is the reduction of the exoenditui es of the Gov -
ernment to its actual economical wants    Sir th s
measure has been often read to this bodv    j et as
often as it has been lead  the expendióles of the
Government have as often departed to the true
principle of economy    From some cause or other
our expenditures constantly increase    For these
extravagancies m expenditures, I do not hold Ex-
ecutive responsible    I hold Congress responsible
It has almost tniformly appropriated largely beyond
the Executive recommendations    Upon the sub-
let of appropriations,  a  large number  oí the
friends of the late administration voted for appro
priations at war with   its opinions , but whether
sanctioned bv  the  Executive or not   these ap
propnations nave been, ana will   I fear, continue
to be made , and the expenditure, of course, placed
in the hands rf the Executive so that the effect is
the same, as ai as the q lesnon of patronage is eon
cerned
Mr Chan man, I conclude th s part of m\ argu
men' bj referring to the follow mg extract from
Gen Jackson s message of Dec ember, 1835 m
which he savs
hold their place at the discretion of the Federal
Executive The only influence, then, which the
Executive can exercise over these institutions, Will
arise out of the profit which may be derived from
the use of the public money which may, from time
to time, be deposited m their vaults this profit,
with but one oi two exeep ions, will not be suffi-
cient to benefit the banks to hazard the displeasure
ot the S ate Governments—always overlooking
their operations—and to draw them into any of the
corrupt purposes of this Government Under the
system prooosed, the tenure of all the officers hold-
ing the public money will be at the discretion of
the President, without any counteracting influence
whatevei Let any man, then judge where there
is most danger of Executive influence, with the
banks or'he Executive ofteers The response is
not doubtful
1 he next objection which occurs, to my mind
is that the system proposed will exert a hos'ile
influence upon State mstitutions,^nd be subveisive
of State rights Mr Chairman, no member has
intimated the idea, that for a long period of time
of war, ti e country can divest itself of a paper
circu'ation , if the soundness of the circulation is
pnoerved theie must de some haimony of action
The natural wai whiehpapcr wages against specie,
and specie agamst paper, mus' be avoided This
bill w hich strikes at the cred t ot the banks, by
excluding their notes from paj ment of public dues,
and thereby necessarily nairows the boundaiy oi
their circulation and 1ossens the>r profits, will ne
cessanl} produce a counteracjing policy on the
part oí thebanls iiiaf polic\ Vvi'l be the resort to
small note issues, foi in this v av alone can they
drive specie out of circulation to enlarge their
own and thus add to the embaírassment of the
country But Mr Cha rman this is not the most
sen jus ob ection to this bill it wnl engender jeal
oi j and ho ilth on the pait of he States towards
the feder il Government a state of things grea 1}
to be deprecated, and pregnant with great evils to
our institutions Mr Chairman do you think that
the States will be passive under the operation of a
sjstem wmch is so blighting to institutions created,
nourished and matured by them and to which
thev aie so much mdeb'ed for their present flour-
ishing condition an 1 thea íapid march in science,
