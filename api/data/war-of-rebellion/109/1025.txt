HEADQUARTERS LONGSTREET'S CORPS,June 22, [1864]-4.15 p. m.

General R. E. LEE,

Commanding:

GENERAL: I inclose a note which I have just received from General Kershaw.* I suspect this is the same information which you have had already, and that it is the enemy's cavalry which is moving in the direction of Dinwiddie Court-House. I have sent for General Wofford, and if his information concerning two corps as given in the note is well derived, I will inform you at once.

I am, very respectfully, your most obedient servant,

R. H. ANDERSON,

Lieutenant-General.

HEADQUARTERS LONGSTREET'S CORPS,June 22, [1864]-9 p. m.

General R. E. LEE,

Commanding:

GENERAL: I presume that General Hill has by this time informed you of his success this evening. You are certainly right, I think, as to the condition of the enemy's troops and as to the happy results that may be expected from following up the blow Hill has given him. I can draw out a division, I think, without jeopardizing my line, and have it ready at any hour and at any place where you may think it can be best employed. You proposition of this morning to General Beauregard seems to me to promise the greatest results, and I am sure I can promise for the corps zealous and determined execution of whatever they may be called on to perform.

I am, very respectfully, your most obedient servant,

R. H. ANDERSON,

Lieutenant-General.
