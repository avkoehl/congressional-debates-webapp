FIELD ORDERS, HDQRS. CAVALRY, MIDDLE MILITARY DIV., Numbers 6. New Market, March 8, 1865.

The First Division, will have charge of the wagon train and conduct its march. Divisions responsible for train must pay particular attention in future to foraging for the animals of the train. The command will march to Scottsville and camp there unless otherwise ordered. The command will move on what is known as the river road, rather than the tow-path. The commanding officer of the First Division will send forty of the best mules to be found in his command to report at 5 a.m. to-morrow to Captain Brown, in charge of train. This must be attended to promptly.

HEADQUARTERS CAVALRY,March 8, 1865

General CUSTER:

If the order issued this evening to mount all dismounted men is complied with it is not understood how there can be many surplus saddles. I am afraid it will be impossible to transport them other than on the backs of horses. All the surplus wagons in supply train will be used to lighten the ammunition wagons.

W. MERRITT,

Brevet Major-General, Commanding.

N. B. - An inspection of your command will perhaps show that a number of your men are riding on citizens' saddles. These must be abandoned in preference to Government saddles.

W. MERRITT,

Brevet Major-General, Commanding.
