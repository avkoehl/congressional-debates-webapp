Major-General ORD,

Humphreys' Station:

Send Mackenzie at once to Dinwiddie to the support of Sheridan. He has been attacked by cavalry and infantry and driven into Dinwiddie. Fighting was still going on when I last heard from him, which was after dark. He will probably be back on the Vaughan road.

Major-General ORD,

Humphreys' Station:

Humphreys has been informed of the battery which you are building to take the enemy's line south of Hatcher's Run in reverse, and made dispositions to take advantage of it. If successful he will endeavor to push up the south side high enough to take the works in your front in reverse in return.
