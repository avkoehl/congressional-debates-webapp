THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
December 2,
to the protection of the United States It became
necessary for the peace of the fiontieis to check
these habitual mioads, and I am happy to mfoim
you that the object has been effected without the j
commission of any act of hostility Co'onel
Dodge, and the tioops undei his command,have
acted with equal fiimness and humanity, and an
auangement has been made with those Indians,
which it is hoped will assuie then permanent
pacific relations with the United States and the
other tribes of Indians upon that boi der It is to
be regretted that the prevalence of sickness in
that quartei has deprived the country of a num
bci of valuable lives, and particularly that Gen
eial Leavenwoith, an officei well known and
esteemed foi his gallant services in the late war,
and for his subsequent good conduct, lias fallen a
victim to his zeal and exertions in the discharge
of his duty
The Army is m a high state of discipline Its
moial condition, so fai as that is known here, is
good, and the vanous blanches of the public
sciviee are caiefully attended to It is amply
sufficient,under its piesentoiganization, foi pro-
viding the neeessaiy ganisons for the seabo u d
and for the defense of the internal frontiei, ind
also for picseiving the elements of militai y knowl
edge, and foi keeping pace with those lmpiovc-
mi nts which modem oxpeiience is continually
making And these objects appeal to me to em-
bi ice all the legitimate purposes for whichapci-
manent mihtaiv ioice should be maintained in
our country The lessons of history teach us
its dangci, and the tendency which exists to an
increase This can be best met and avcited by
a just ciution on the part of the public itself, and
of those who lcprcscnt them in Congiess
From the duties which devolve on the engineei
dopaitmcnt, and upon the topogiaphical ongi
neers, a diffeient oigamzation seems to be de-
manded by the public inteii st, and I ice ommtnd
tin subject to your consideiatwn
No impoitaiit change has, duiing this season,
taken place in the condition of the Indians Ai-
laugcmcnts aie in piogiessfoi the íemovalof the
Ciceks, and will soon b( foi the removal of the
hcmmolcs i íegiet that the Chriokee¡> east of
the Mississippi have not yet deteimined, as a
community, to lemoio How long the pcisonal
ciuse& which have hciotoforc íetaided that ulti
matcly inevitable me asme will continue to ope-
late 1 am unible to conjectine It is oeitain,
howt vi i, th it delay will bung with it ae cumulated
ev is, vvhuh will ícndi i tin n condition mou and
moic unpleasmt The experience ofevciy yi ai
adds to the conviction, that emigiatioti, and that
alone, can piesti ve fiom distinction th< uinii int
of the tubes yet living among us The f icility
vv ith which the ni ce ss incs etf lif ne piocmicl,

emigi int Indians in th' iragi ¡cultural pen sui s, md
in the important concern of education, md tin n
removal fiom those c mses which hive h< n tofoie
depiesscd all and destroyed many of the tubes,
cannot fail to stimulate thou exu lions and to 10-
wnid their industiy
1 he two laws passed at the last session of Con-
giess on the subject of Indi in affuis have be ( n
earned into effect, and detailed institutions fji
then administration hive bien given It will b<
seen, by the estimate s for the pi ese nt session, that
a gie it ltduction will take place in the expendí
tures of the Department in conscquonc of these
lives And tin íe is itason to believe that then
opciation will be salutaiy,and that the colomz i
tion of the Indians on the western fiont u, to-
gethei with a judicious system of administration,
will still fui thei loduce thccxponsesofthis blanch
of the public s ívicc, and at the same time pro
mote its usefulness and efficiency
Cncumstances have bei n recently developed
showing the existence of extensive fiauds undo
the vanous lawsgi mting pensions and gratuities
for revolutionary services It is impossible to
estimate the amount which may have been thus
fiaitdule itl> obtained from the national Treasmy
I am satisfied, however, it has been such as to
justify a reexamination of the system, and the
adoption of the necessary checks in its admimsti a
tion Wl will agiee that the services and suffei-
jngs of the lemnant of our rcvolutionaiy band
should be fully compensated    But while this i«
done, every proper precaution should betaken to
pievent the admission of fabi icated and fiaudulent
claims In the present mode of proceeding, the
' attestations and certificates of judicial officeis of
i the various States foim a considerable portion of
I the checks which aie interposed against the com-
I mission of fiauds These, however, have been,
and may be, fabiicated, and in such a way as to
elude detection at the examining offices And,
independently of this practical difficulty, it is
ascertained that these documents are often loosely
gianted, sometimes even blank ceitificates have
been issued, sometimes prepai edpapei s have been
signed without inquiry, and, m one nisi nice at
least, the seal of the couit has been within leach
of a poison most interested in itsimpioper apph
cation It is obvious that, under such cncum-
stances, no seventy of administration can check
the abuse of the law, and infoimation has, from
time to time, been communicated to the Pension
Office, questioning or denying the light of pel sons
placed upon the pension list to the bounty of the
country Such cautions are always attended to,
and examined But a fai moie general investi-
gation is called for, and I therefore recommend,
in conformity with the suggestion of the Sccietai y
of War, that an actual inspection should be made
m each State into the circumstances and claims
of eveiy poison now diawmg a pension The
honest vetoian has nothing to feu fiom such a
sciutiny, while the fiaudulent claimant will be
detected, and the public Treasuiy lehcved to an
amount, I have reason to believe, fai gitatei than
has heretofoie been suspected The details of
such a plan could be so íegulated as to mteipose
the necessary checks, without any buidensome
operation upon the pensioiiei s The object should
be twofold
1     To look into the original justice of the
claims, so fai as this can be done undci a piopei
system of regulations, by an examination of the
claimants themselves, and by inquiring, in the
vicinity of tkcir residence,into then lnstoiy,and
into the opinion entertained of then íevolutionary
services
2    To ascertain, in all cases, whether the 011-
gmal claimant is living, and tins by actual per-
sonal inspection
This measure will, if adopted, be pioductive, I
think, of the dcsiied lcsults, and I theiefoie re-
commend it to yom consider ition, with the fur
thei suggestion, that all payments should be
suspende d till the neeessaiy le ports ire received
It will be seen, by a tabulai stitementannexed
to the documents tiansmitted to Congress, that
the appi opnations for objects connected with the
Wai Depaitment, made at the last session, foi
the sei vice of theycai lb34, excluding the perma-
. m nt appiopnation foi the payment of nulitaiy
giatuitii s undci the ict of June 7,1832, the ap-
propnation of two bundled thousand dollars foi
aiming and equipping the militia, and the appio-
pnation of $10,000 foi the civilization of the In-
dians, which are notamiu illy íencwed, amounted
to the sum of nine million thiee thousand two
j   handled and sixty on   dolíais, and that the esti
! mates of appiepilations necessary foi the same
¡  blandios of sciviee foi the ycai 183Ó, amount to
I   the sum of five million seven   bundled and sev-
j cnty-ciglit thousand nine hundred and sixty-four
doll us, making adiffcienec in the appropuations
' of the cmicnt yeai over the estimates of appio-
puitions foi the next, of thin, million two hun-

I ninety s< von dolíais
l|     The pnncipal causes which have operated at
! this time to   pioduce  this greit diffeience  aie
shown in the icpoits and documents, and m the
detailed estimates Some of these causes aie
|  accidental and tempoiary, while otheis aie per
m-iK nt, and, aided by i just comsc of aelmims
1 nation, may continue to opeiate beneficially upon
II  the public expendamos
'     A just economy, expending whcie the public
seivice reepmes, and withholding wheie it does
, not, is among the indispensable  duties  of the
Government
I I it fei you to the accompanying report of the
j Seeietary of the Navy, and to the documents
with it, for a full view of the operations of that
, impoitant branch of our service during the
1 present yeai     It will be seen that the wisdom
and libeiality with which Congress have provided
for the gradual increase of our Navy material,
have been seconded by a corresponding zeal and
fidelity on the part of those to whom has been
confided the execution of the laws on the subject,
and that but a short period would be now íe-
quircd to put in commission a force laige enough
foi any exigency into which the country may be
thrown
When we íeflect upon our position in íelation
to othei nations, it must beappaient that, in the
event of conflicts with them, we must look chiefly
to oui Navy for the protection of our rational
uehts The wide seas which scpaiate us from
other Governments must, of necessity, be the
theater on which an enemy will attempt to assail
us, and, unless we are prepaied to meet him on
this element, we cannot be said to possess the
powei lequisite to íepel or pievent aggressions
We cannot, theiefoie, watch with too much at-
tention this arm of our defense, or cherish with
too much care the means by which it can possess
the necessary efficiency and extension To this
end oui policy has beenlieictofore wisely dnected
to the constant employment of a foice sufficient
to guaid our commcice, and to the íapid accumu-
lation of the materials winch are neeessaiy to
repau our vessels, and construct with case such
new ones as may be requned in asíate of wai
In accordance with this policy, I recommend
to your consideration the election of the addi-
tional dry dock descnbed by the Secretary of
the ¡Navy, and also the construction of the steam
batteries to which he has referred, for the pur-
pose of testing their efficacy as auxiliaries to the
system of defense now in use
The leport of the Postmaster General, herewith
submitted, exhibits the condition and piospects
of that Depaitment JProm that document, it ap-
peals that there was a deficit m the funds of the
Depaitment at the commencement of ihc present
year, beyond its available means, of three hun-
dred and fifteen thousand five hundred and ninety-
nine dolíais and ninety-eight cents, which, on
the 1st of July last, had been reduced to two
hundred and sixty-eight thousand and ninety two
dolíais and seventy-four cents It appeals also
that the íevenues for the coming yeai will exceed
the cxpe nditures about two hundred and seventy
thousand doll us, which, with the excess of lev-
enuc which will lesult fiom the oper itions of the
cunent half year, may be expected, independ-
ently of any increase m the gloss amount of post
ages, to supply the entne deficit before the end of
1835 But, as this calculation is based on the
gioss amount of postages which had accrued
within the penod embracud by the times of stiik-
ing the balances, it is obvious that without a pro-
giessive inciease in the amount of postages, the
existing retrenchments must be persevered in
thiough the year 1836, that the Depaitment may
accumulate a surplus fund sufficient to place it in
a condition of peifect ease
It will be obseived that the íevenues of the
Post Office Department, though they 1 ave in-
creased, and then amount is above that of any
foimei year, have yet fallen short of the estimates
more than a hundred thousand dolíais This is
ittubuttdm agieat degiee to the inciease office
ktteis gi owing out of the extension and abuse of
the franking privilege Thei c has been a gradual
inciease in the numbei of executive officei s to
which it has been granted, and by an act passed
in March, 1833, it was extended to membeis of
Congiess thioughout the whole year It is be-
lieved that a lcvision of the laws relative to the
flanking privilege, with some enactments to en-
foico more rigidly the íestrictions under which it
is granted, would operate beneficially to the
countiy, by enabling the Depaitment at an earlier
penod to restore the mail facilities thpt had been
withdrawn, and to extend them moie widely
as the growing settlements of the country may
lequne
To a measure so impoitant to the Government,
and so just to our constituents, who ask no ex
elusive  privileges   for themselves, and are  not
willing to concede   them to otheis, I earnestly
recommend the serious attention of Congress
The importance of the Post Office Department,
and the magnitude to which it has grown, both
in  its revenues and m its operations, seem  to
