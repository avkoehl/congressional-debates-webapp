THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
March 29,
all impaired, because when lawlessness became
stronger than the State government the Uni-
ted States stepped in and by restoring the
supremacy of the law established order through-
out our limits.
Mr. ELDRIDGE. Will the gentleman allow
me to make an inquiry of him ?
Mr. KELLEY. Yes, sir; and I will answer
it if I think it pertinent.
Mr. ELDRIDGE. I think the gentleman
will consider it pertinent. I understand the
gentleman to have been describing the state of
the South, and denying some positions taken
by gentlemen on this side of the House who
are residents of the South. If I am not divert-
ing the gentleman from the line of his argu-
ment, I would like to have him tell us, while
011 that subject, what is the cause, in his judg-
ment, of this state of things there ; whether it
is not in fact the legislation of this Congress,
the course pursued by the General Govern-
ment toward the people of those States, when
endeavoring to impose upon them 
Mr. KELLEY. That is euough. I will
answer the gentleman.
Mr. BLDRIUGE. When endeavoring to
impose upon them a condition of affairs repug-
nant to their liberties.
Mr. KELLEY. I decline to yield to the
gentleman for a speech, but will answer his
question, and tell him to what I attribute the
unhappy condition of the South. I attribute it
to Democratic influence, as I did the breaking
out of the rebellion, to the fact that the south-
ern people had been misled by the Democratic
party of tiie North into the belief that if they
threatened war the cowardly people of the North
would acquiesce, and there would be no blood-
shed. I attribute it to the same cause to which
I attributed the last year and a half of the rebel-
lion, when the confederacy iiad become a mere
shell, and its government was "robbing the
cradle and the grave" to replenish the ranks
of its exhausted armies; to the influence
upon its misguided leaders of the sympathetic
speeches of Democratic leaders in the North;
to the resolutions of the Chicago convention
declaring the war to be a failure, and demand-
ing peace at any price; and to the course of the
noi thern Democratic press that led the rebels
to hope that northern resistance to their armies
would be checked at home or exhausted, and
that they would still by such aid be able to
establish their government.
Democratic speeches made here in this
House and the course of the Democratic press
maintained the rebellion for nearly two years.
And, in conclusion, t say if the Democracy of
the North had condemned the outrages in the
South which weareconsidnring the condition of
affairs there now would be very different from
what it is; and that even now, while we discuss
this bill, the assertions of gentlemen, sustained
by a plausible show of argument, that there is
no constitutional power in Congress or the
Government to suppress these great wrongs and
restore public tranquillity, are heard among
the iiu klux and hiss them on to slaughter.
Xti replying to his question I have given the
gentleman from Wisconsin [Mr. Eldridge] my
impressions honestly, as 1 would utter them
beiore my God in final account.
Mr. ELDRIDGE. The gentleman has not
answered my question.
Mr. KELLEY. I decline to yield further,
nave said we are m a slate of war, and I pro-
pose to prove it by submitting very brief ex-
tracts iroin the testimony of two witnesses who
were examined before the Senate committee
to show something of its character.
James E. Boyd, an ex-confederate soldier,
a supporter of Seymourand Blair, and a mem-
ber of the Ku Klux, in the course of his testi-
mony said :
The meetings were to be hold in secret places—in
the woods, or some other place distant from any
Habitation, m order to avoid detection. The dis-
guise prescribed was a lung white gown, and a mask
c/*. ■No a-pphcNnt could be admitted as a
memoer 01 the organization until his name had first
been submitted to a regular camp. A county was
divided into a certain number of districts, and each
district composed a camp, which was under the com-
mand of a captain. The whole county constituted a
klnn, under the command of a chief. No person could
be initiated as the member of any camp until hisname
had been submitted to the camp and his application
unanimously agreed to by the members of the camp.
The manner of making raids was prescribed by the
regulations. No raid was to be made, no person pun-
ished, no execution done, unless it had first been
unanimously agreed upon at a regular meeting of a
camp of the klan and duly approved by the officers
and the chief of the klan. The sign of recognition
of the White Brotherhood was by sliding the right
hand down along the opposite lappel of the coat.
If the party to whom the sign was made was a mem-
ber of the organization he returned it by sliding the
left hand in the same manner down along the oppo-
site lappel of the coat. The word of distress was
"Shiloh." There was a sign of distress to be made
when a brother was in distress and wanted assist-
ance. I do not remember the sign; it was some sign
made by the hand. But if the person was so situated
that the sign made by the hand could not be seen,
then the word "Shiloh " was used to denote distress.
Question. Upon the oath administered, the mode
of procedure prescribed, and the government of the
organization, so far as you have observed, are the
members bound to carry out the decrees of the order,
if they invoivo murder and assassination?
Answer. I think so, sir. If it was decided to take
the life of a man a camp is ordered to execute the
sentence, and is bound to do it.
Question. What would, bo the penalty if any mem-
ber refused ?
Answer, I do not know that any penalty was pre-
scribed for that. A member could excuse himself
from attendance at meetings or from going upon
raids if he had a proper excuse. The penalty pre-
scribed in the regulations for the punishment of
any member who s-hould disclose the sccrcts of the
order wns death. Each member was informed upon
his initiation that if ho disclosed the secrets of the
organization he should be the first victim.
Question. If any arrests should be made by the
civil aulhoiities for inurdeis or other crimes com-
mitted in pursuance of the decree* of a camp, to
what extent did the obligations of members bind
them to assist and protect each other?
Answer. To whatever extent was in their power.
Question. Did it go to the extent of giving testi-
mony in behalf of each other or of acquitting if
upon a jury ?
# Antwer. I think that was one of the objects and
intentions of the organization, that a person on the
witness-stand or in the jury-box should disregard
his oath in order to protect a member of the organ-
ization.
Mr. AIcCOIiMICK, of Missouri. In what
year did these things occur?
Mr. KELLEY. I will refer the gentleman
to the report of the Senate committee of the
testimony taken by them a few weeks ago.
lhe report and testimony have been printed,
and the gentleman can obtain them by sending
to the document-room. The testimony of Mr.
Boyd is sustained by that of a large number
of others, among whom were several judges.
1 homas W. AYilleford,mthe course of his tes-
timony, said:
Question, Did they tell you what the object was?
# Answer. Yes, sir; in the first meeting. I was
initiated m Kennedy's barn.
Question. Did you take the oath?
Answer. Yes, sir; and then the next Saturday
went to the meeting.
Question. What did they tell you then was the
object of the organization?
Answer. They told me itwastodamagctheBepub-
iican party as much as they could-—burning, steal-
ing, whipping niggers, and sueh things as that.
Murder?
Ansxcer. The leading men it was to murder.
* f tjS Is * * * & -S
Question. Have you ever heard of a Ku Klux
being convicted of any offense there?
Answer. No, sir.
Question. Was there anything in the obligation
yon took or the rules of the order as to your being
obliged to defend men by your oaths, or otherwise?
Ansxcer. i es, &ir; if he could get you in as a wit-
ness you m\d to swear him out, let you be swearing
a lie or not. If you swore against him, why you
might just as^well be a-traveling at onct.
Quevdoa. You mean by that you would be in dan-
ger ot your life from the order?
Answer. Yes, sir.
Question. Anything about getting on the jury ?
Answer. Yes, sir; if we could get on the jury we
could save hi m. do what you please.
Question. No matter what the proof?
Answer. Yes, sir; you could not bring proof
enough to convict. y
bir, do wc live under a Government? Are
we a civilized people? Because, if we are,
and if we do live under a Government, the
power to suppress outrages such as these is
at our command, and the duty ofdoing it is laid
upon us by a Power higher than a written consti-
tution. Humanity implores, and the Father
of man and God of justice commands us to
put forth our powers and suppress this fiendish
organization, and give peace and security to all
the men in the South, let them have been born
and reared where they may and their color
or politics be what they may, and I thank
God that the Republican party at last seems
disposed to do its whole duty in this behalf.
Oh, how old and exhausted arguments do
come back again 1 Said the gentleman from
Ohio [Mr. Morgan] to day, "It was an in-
sult to the State of Kentucky to appoint a
polored mail agent," and he suggested that
that colored man had been appointed to that
position for the purpose of insulting Kentucky
and bringing on acts of violence. So it used
to be said. "Now, you will only anger the
South if you do that" That will be an in-
sult to the South." The South, with a million
of armed men in the field, were to have th ir
delicate feelings considered ; and we were to
do nothing in the way of legislation thatvrould
shock their sensibilities. And now we are
to permit a band of sworn men, forty thousand
strong in the single State of North Carolina,
to go abroad at night a scourge of the people,
and to exist as a terror by day. And for what
purpose? Wtiy do gentlemen on the other
side endeavor to persuade us to desist? Is it
not to enable those who planned and executed
the rebellion, and those who sympathized with
them and are now in political association with
them, to accomplish by murder, conspiracy,
and terror what they failed to do by open war—•
take possession of this Government? And
when this is done, to follow it up by attempt-
ing the mad scheme of retracing " the steps"
taken by the American people since rebel guns
were fired at Sumter, and turning backward a
providential revolution.
The inferiority of the negro has also been
hashed up again. Sir, will gentlemen never
learn that morals, industry, manhood, general
intelligence, stamp the man, and not the char-
acter of his hair, or the color of his skin? Will
they never learn ihat the object of government
is not to protect the strong, who can care for
themselves, but to protect the weak, the ignor-
ant, and those who are degraded because they
have been made to suffer in the past? And
how shall you protect such but by giving them
their equal political rights, and incorporating
them into the political people and power of
the country?
They were soldier?, they are tax-payers ;
their industry created the wealth of the South,
and will soon restore it if their rights are main-
tained. The loss by war is simply the loss of
the annual crop. It is marvelous, yet well
understood by those who have studied the phi-
losophy of the thing, how soon a war-scarred
nation regains its wealth; the annual crops
coining up from fieldsquickened by the wastes
of war, fields that have lain fallow during the
time of strife, tilled with renewed courage
and industry by the impoverished people, send
forth crops larger than ever since they were
first tilled. And the observer finds at the end
of the fourth or fifth year that the wealth of
the people equals the amount that existed when
the war began.
The outraged colored people of the South
have earned the dollars, grown the cotton, the
tobacco, the rice, cut the timber, built ihe fac-
tories, to which the gentleman from Tennes-
see [Mr. WhitthobnkJ referred; mid shall they
enjoy none of them? The madness of theSouth
made them free, and we have fully enfranchised
them by statute and constitutional provision ;
and shall they have thewoid of promise to the
ear only ?^ Shall they have the nominal right
to the privileges of citizenship without parti-
cipation in the general administration of
the Government? Shall they have the right
to vote, and yet be held by a mas'er class in
ignorance, subjection, and degradation, eo that
when election day comes they may be driven,
like dumb cattle, to the polls, or like serfs, away
from the places at which those, who are really
