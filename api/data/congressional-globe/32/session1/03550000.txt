crease in the number of cadets, an extension of
the teim of education, and an enlarged course of

NORTH AMERICAN FISHERIES.
A message from the President of the United
States was received, by Mr. M. P. Fillmore, his
Secretary, transmitting, in compliance with a res-
olution of the Senate of the 23d ultimo, requesting
information in regard to the fisheries on the coasts
of the British Possessions in North America, a
report from the Acting Secretary of State, and the
documents by which it was accompanied; and
stating that Commodore M. C. Perry, with the
United States steam frigate Mississippi, under his
command, had been dispatched to that quarter for
the purpose of protecting the rights of American
fishermen under the convention of 1818.
The message was read.
Mr.'CASS moved to refer the documents to the
Committee''3ft Foreign Relations, and spoke for
near an hour, contending that the construction
given by the British Ministry was utterly untena-
ble, and urged with much fervor the importance
of protecting the fishermen in all their just rights,
declaring the movement of England as most extra-
ordinary, to say the least.
Mr. DAVIS'spoke at length, maintaining the
opinion heretofore expressed by him, that no war
would grow out of the existing differences, though
he thought there was much in the conduct of the
British that might be classed as irritating and vex-
atious. He did not think Great Britain wanted a
war, but if she did she could have it; he would
never surrender an iota of our rights to Her.
Mr. HAMLIN followed, going into a'critical
examination of the treaty, descanting on the cor-
respondence in relation to it, insisting that the in-
terpretation put on the treaty by the American
Government was right, and should be sustained at
all hazards, givins "it as his opinion that the con-
duct of England could never be submitted to with-
out dishonor and disgrace. Mr. H. did not con-
clude his remarks. [These speeches will be tound
in the Appendix.]
On motion by Mr. SEWARD, the further con-
sideration of the President's message was post-
poned until to-morrow.

On motion by Mr. BRIGHT, the Senate pro-
ceeded to the consideration of Executive business;
