Thirty-fifth Regiment Iowa Volunteers, was deployed and sent forward as skirmishers. After a halt of about 2 hours we discovered that the camp of the enemy was some distance to our right.

It being now dark the Thirty-fifth Iowa Volunteers, followed by the Thirty-third Missouri Volunteers, was ordered forward toward the position of the enemy, and at about 10.30 p. m. arrived at the enemy's outer pickets. Eight picket-posts were now in succession relieved of their guards, and three couriers, one guidon colors, and an ambulance, with horses, &amp;c., captured, and the prisoners sent to the rear of the first regiment, without the firing of a gun or causing any alarm whatever. At about midnight we arrived at the main camp of the rebels. The Thirty-fifth Iowa quickly surrounded a number of the enemy in a house, and mounted their men on the horses hitched to a section of the enemy's battery and caissons, before our presence was at all discovered by them; it was a complete surprise. There was every indication that the camp was in readiness for an attack; horses were hitched, guns were in position, two of them were charged with canister, but so silent was our approach and so rapid our movements in their camp, that they did not use their artillery, and fired but a few rifle shots before the capture was complete. After the capture of the first section of artillery and a lot of officers and men in a large house, as also a large lot of cavalry horses equipped, both regiments were ordered with bayonets fixed to charge through the camp, and succeeded in capturing another section of artillery, with caissons and horses complete, and also a number of rebels mounted. Passing out of the enemy's main camp to the bayou, we found the bridge over Bayou Rapides destroyed by fire. We then moved to our left, along the bayou, the Thirty-third Regiment Missouri Volunteers in the advance, with two companies out as skirmishers. Passing through an open field and into an old cavalry camp, about 40 more prisoners and horses were taken. Finding here the frame-work of a partially destroyed bridge, we in half an hour repaired it and crossed over, and marched 2 1/2 miles, through deep mud and water, to near the place where we crossed the bayou at 1 p. m., and bivouacked for the few remaining hours of the night at 3 a. m., having marched about 35 miles in 22 1/2 hours.

On the morning of the 22nd, the Thirty-third Missouri Volunteers was ordered forward to support the Ninth Indiana Battery, while the captured property was secured, and the enemy's camp at Henderson's Hill entirely destroyed. At 12 m. we took up our line of march toward Alexandria, the Thirty-fifth Iowa Volunteers having in charge the prisoners of war and the captured battery. Arrived within 8 miles of Alexandria and camped for the night. Next morning (23rd) marched at 6 a. m., and arrived in Alexandria at 1 p. m.
