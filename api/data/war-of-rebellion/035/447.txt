You will also assume command of the hospital and convalescent camp, and issue such orders for the policing and government of the camp and of the town as the nature of the case may require.

The following just received by me:

MURFREESBOROUGH, June 23, 1863.

There are sings of a backward movement of Bragg's army. Adding to what I telegraphed you, I will say that Crittenden thinks they mean Kentucky. It may be well to be on the watch.
