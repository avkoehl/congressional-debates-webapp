HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND, Raper's Creek, Ga., May 30, 1864.

Major General O. O. HOWARD, Commanding Fourth Corps:

GENERAL: Major-General Stoneman reported last night that the enemy's cavalry appeared to be massing against him, for the purpose, apparently, of gaining possession of the road leading to Burnt Hickory, from our left, and General Palmer asked for more troops in that quarter to prevent the rebels gaining their object. The major-general commanding indorsed upon the back of the communication an order to General Palmer to use General Cruft's brigade for that purpose if it became absolutely necessary. I write this to inform you that such authority was sent to General Palmer by the major-general commanding.

Very respectfully

WM. D. WHIPPLE,Brigadier-General and Chief of Staff.
