MAY 30, 1864 - 3 P. M.

Major-General MEADE:

General Griffin reports to me that he has struck the enemy's line with rifled cannon in position. We have taken about 30 prisoners, Rode's division, North Carolinians. The orders last night contemplated the cavalry covering my left. They have not done it. I have had to send a large infantry force off of my line of march to drive away the enemy's cavalry and support it. My right is in advance of General Burnside's troops there. I think his whole force should cross over and let me move to the left if I am to go farther, as I now have to advance on two diverting roads. I do not know how to communicate with him, expect by sending to General Potter.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,May 30, 1864 - 4 p. m. (Received 4.15 p. m.)

General MEADE:

The enemy have got in force around my left flank. Any troops that can be sent to the Via house are desirable.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,May 30, 1864 - 4.15 p. m.

Major-General WARREN,

Commanding Fifth Corps:

I have already communicated to General Sheridan the fact that the enemy's cavalry in the Linney, Gilman, &amp;c., road have ben annoying you all day, and that had been obliged to send a brigade to drive them off while you moved elsewhere. Your dispatch of 4 p. m. just received. General Burnside reports that he has crossed his corps on the south side of the Totopotomoy, and has a large reserve. The telegraph does not communicate with him. I will send at once to find him, and direct him to send more force at once to the Via house. You had better communicate with Potter.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,May 30, 1864 - 4.25 p. m.

General MEADE:

We have formed a division to meet the advance of the enemy toward my left. Got artillery in position and order restored. If General Burnside moves across the stream I will take care of my own left.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
