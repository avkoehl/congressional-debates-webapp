HDQRS. SECOND CAVALRY DIVISION, CAVALRY CORPS,October 6, 1864.

Brigadier General H. E. DAVIES,

Commanding First Brigade, Second Cavalry Division:

GENERAL: The general commanding directs that so much of your brigade as may be necessary (not exceeding one-half) shall be disposed to cover the main avenues by which the enemy could approach our lines between the Jerusalem plank road and the James River. A thorough system of scouting will be adopted as the best plan of keeping off guerrillas. Special instructions have been sent the commanding officer of the Eighth Pennsylvania Cavalry, now near Birchett's. The regiment of your brigade posted in that vicinity will be governed by the same instructions. The officers commanding regiments toward James River will place themselves in communication with the commanders of infantry in their rear and give notice of any important movements of the enemy discovered in their front. As soon as you shall have established your line please report the disposition of your picketing force to these headquarters.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

A. H. BIBBER,

Captain and Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.

Secretary of War, Washington, D. C.:

I understand there are six companies of heavy artillery belonging to an unfilled regiment of New Hampshire volunteers somewhere near Washington. As artillery they must be nearly or quiet useless. Can they not be sent to me, and I can put them in my skeleton New Hampshire regiments and teach them the first duty of the artillery soldier-the use of the musket-in a short time.
