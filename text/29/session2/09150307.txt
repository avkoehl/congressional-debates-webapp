By this table it is seen that, with a population of |J
5,300,000 persons, our average ex ports, for a period ;
of seven years, amounted to the enormous sura of!
$96,359,443 per annum; and, taking the whole ;
population, was.$10 18 per head. This, sir, is j
wonderful, and shows the unparalleled prosperity i,
of the agricultural interests under this low rate of j:
revenue duty. There is nothing like it since; every !j
increase of duty has been followed by a rapid de- !■
cline of exports. But to the facts. I now present h
you a table exhibiting the exports for seven years |
under the high protective duties imposed by the
tariff bill of 1824.

This table exhibits the startling fact that, with a
population swollen to 12,866,000 souls, your ex-
ports had dwindled down to $79,889,997 per annum,
or $6 13 per head. This was the disastrous effect
of the hia;h duties of 1824. Let us now see the
effect of the much-lauded tariff bill of 1840. Here
is the table, presenting, in glowing truths, the
effect of that bill upon exports;

Thus it is seen, that with a population of 18,- !
500,000 souls, our exports were reduced to $303,-
397,710, or $5 58 per head, under the blighting
operations of the tariff bill of 1842. It is a most ;
striking fact, challenging the most deliberate con- ;
sideration of every agriculturist, that, under the j
low duties of 1800, the average exports, according
to population, were §18 18 per head; under the
high protective duties of 1824, exports woyp re-
duced to $6 13 per head; and, under the tanlf bill
of 1H42, were still further reduced to §5 58 per
head. Thus establishing the fact, that every in-
creased duty not only diminishes your imports,
and, consequently, your customs, but diminishes,
in still greater and more ruinous degree, the ex-
ports of the country. Now, sir, notwithstanding
the facts here submitted, this proposition may be
denied. 1 theiefore submit a question to this com-
mittee. If you can import nothing, including
money, can you export anything ! You undoubted-
ly cannot, unless you give away your exports.
It therefore follows, whatever tends to diminish
imports diminishes exports also.
Mr. Chairman, I need not dwell upon the evil
consequences to a country, resulting from a dimi-
nution of her exports. These exports consist in
the surplus products of labor; they cannot be con-
sumed at home, and if the markets of the world
are closed upon them, they decay, and waste
upon the hands of the producer, and are to him a
dead loss. The surplus products of labor, taken
in the aggregate, constitute tfce sole means of ac-
quiring new wealth to a country. If, therefore,
you adopt a policy which prohibits an exchange
of these surplus productions for articles of durable
and increasing value, all the sources of accumula-
ting wealth are as effectually closed as if Providence
had smitten the earth with the curse of barren-
ness.
Should we, then, seek to provide for the pay-
ment of the war debt by the revival of a system
which promises nothing but failure, and which if
successful, would operate so injuriously upon the
labor and exports of the country ? I hope we shall
pause long before we are guilty of any such absurd-
ity. Sir, I have now a word to add to gpntle-
men from the valley of the Mississippi, and those
who represent the 'farming, as contradistinguished
from the planting, interest of this country, and who
are now refusing to tax the free list of imported
articles because it includes tea and coffee. Reflect,
I beseech you, upon the large amount of exports,
and the wonderful agricultural prosperity with i
which we were blessed under the low duties^of,
1800, and do not overlook the fact, that, during the i
whole period embraced by the table already sub- |
mitted, not one bale of cotton was exported. The J
whole, or nearly so, of the $96,359,443 annually |
exported then, consisted of farming productions, ;
and principally provisions. But now (neaily fifty |
years afterwards) our exports have only increased ;
to $110,000,000 per annum, and two-thirds of those j
exports consist of cotton. Hencc, it is obvious,
that the very great reduction of exports, accord-
ing to population, resulting fiom the high duties,
subsequently imposed upon imports, has been farm-
ing and not planting productions. Why, sir, was ^
this the case? Because your duties were so high \-
upon imports that provisions, including gram, J
could not be shipped and exchanged for foreign ij
products, and pay the home duty. It absorbed |'
nearly the entire value of the outward cargo, and ;!
hence the trade was abandoned, and the provision ij
markets of the world lost to our people. But I
may be asked, why provisions might not have j!
been exported, if there was a demand for them, {■
and the value of them brought back in money ? I jj
answer, commerce, to be permanent between the |j
different countries of the world, must be reciprocal. !|
No nation can buy the surplus products of another, jj
and pay exclusively in money.
If a nation should buy for cash, and sell nothing
for a few years, the rapid exhaustion of her circu-
lating medium would \ery soon derange her com-
merce, and end in a general paralysis of all her
industnal pursuits. Fiom necessity, therefore, no
nation can pursue that policy; and when, by our
commercial restrictions, wc prevented the exchange
of the products of agriculture for the products of
foreign countries, except money, those countries
1 were^compelled to seek their supplies in those mar-
' kets in which a less restrictive system prevailed,
; and thereby permitted an exchange of commodi-
ties upon terms of mutual advantage. We refused
to do so, and therefore lost the provision markets
of the world, and others gained them. But we
have, by our late modification of the tariff, taken
! the first step in regaining our lost markets. Will
our friends from the West, who are so peculiarly ^
' interested in this lost, nav, foolishly abandoned, jj
market for the surplus products of the farmer, the !;
; benefits of which are now being felt in the increased
and rapidly increasing price of provisions of every };
kind, force us back upon high duties, and thereby ;j
bring upon the country the evils from which we ,
■ are now escaping, rather than submit to a tax upon j
tea and coffee ? ;
1 Sir, if they do, I have too much respect for them,
individually and collectively, to say what should i
i be the action of their constituents under the cir- j
1 cumstanees. We of the southern or planting States
j oppose, upon principle, high duties upon imports; |
I but we can bear them much better than the farm-
: ing States. The world is obliged to have the sur-
! plus products of our labor, which is cotton. It
| can be obtained in sufficient quantity and good
1 quality from no other quarter of the globe. And
if England, the ruling power of Europe, powerful
as is her Government, were to exclude it from her
market on to-morrow, she would, in ninety days,
be convulsed to her centre, and threatened with all
the horrors of internal war. It is necessary to her
national existence; she cannot, therefore, dispense
with it. It is, most assuredly, owing to this very
reason that the export of cotton has continued to
advance, despite, the restrictive folly of your com-
mercial system, until it constitutes two-thirds of
your entire exports, whilst the export of grain and
provisions, generally, has sunk into comparative
nothingness. But we of the South sympathize
with agriculture in all its branches, as we do in the
general prosperity of the country. We urge you,
therefore, by every consideration of patriotism,
not in time of war to force upon the country a
changcof the revenue system which can end in no
practical good, but in the most disastrous conse-
quences to all of the great interests of the country.
Let us, then, unite and provide for the certain pay-
ment of the war debt by a duty upon the free list,
and a reduction and graduation of the price of the
public lands. Let us prosecute the war with a
vigor corresponding with the power of a great
nation; and when peace is made, let it be upon
principles that will prove us a just and magnani-
mous one.
THE MEXICAN WAR.
SPEECH OF MR. GARRETT DAVIS,
OF KENTUCKY,
In the House of Representatives,
February 3, 1847.
The House being in Committee of the Whole on
the state of the Union, and having under con-
sideration the Bill to raise an additional Military-
Force—
Mr. DAVIS, of Kentucky, said it was so seldom
that members on that side of the House obtained
the floor, 01- had any opportunity of taking partm
the debates and course of business in that House,
that having now fortunately the opportunity, he
should avail himself of it to look a little at thestate
of the Union at large.
This reference of a certain class of subjects to the
Committee of the Whole oil the state of the Union
was a very valuable practice 111 the existing state
of things, as it-regarded the freedom of debate and
the information of the people as to the manner in
which their affairs were conducted, and how the
Government of the country was managed by those
high officers to whom they had committed these
H,teat trusts. This had always been considered as
a privilege important to the preservation of English
liberty, and it was no less so to the safety of the
freedom of our country. A great poet, and one who
well understood the course of human affairs, had
well said:
<< For forms of Government let fools contest,
The form that's best administered is best."
We had a Government and a code of laws to
regulate the proceedings of this House, not unjust
in principle or unwise in its provisions, but which
was more despotic, oppressive, and tyi annical in its
administration by an unscrupulous majority, than
any other that ever had existed on the face of the
g-jobe. Every free Government must necessarily,
to continue free, have a powerful, vigilant, and
fearless opposition, to watch the proceedings of
those in power: such an opposition, exerted for the
weal of the people and for the exposure of all at-
tempts at oppression and usurpation. _ To make
such an exposure, was a right of essential value to
th° people, and formidable'to tyrants and usurpers
only. But what ficedom had the Opposition m
that House 3 They could not discuss a subject;
they could not even speak upon it, except, occa-
sionally, bv the will and gracious permission of the
maiority "Without this leave obtained, iand tnat
could be seldom had,) they could not olier an
amendment to a bill, nor, m fact, take any part in
the operations of the Government.
That House (Mr. D. went on to say) was the
erand inquest of the nation. It was one of the
' Democratic features of our Government, that the
, representatives of the people had the right and pre-
! rotative to arraign all officers of the Government for
