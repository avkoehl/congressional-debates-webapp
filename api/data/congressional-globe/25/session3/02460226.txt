THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

Southard,] and beseech him, by his love Of coun-
try and regaid foi its honor and its rights, not to
vote against this bill It was not the bill that the
Senator supposed it was. He certainly could not
have had an opportunity of understanding it
truly. He appealed to the Senator not to prevent
a unanimous vote of this body in favor of a
measure so essentially necessary for the honor
and safety of the country. He fully believed that
the Senator regarded the rights and liberties of
his country as much as any man on that floor;
and he had not a doubt but if he understood this
bill properly, he would give it his support. Every
vote given against this bill will be regarded by-
Great Britain as an invitation, on the part of the
Senator who gave it, to persist in her unreason-
able pretensions, and never to surrender her
claims to this disputed territory Not to pass
this bill would be dishonorable, when we had
declared that Gieat Bntam had not a «shadow of
claim to this disputed tcrntoiy, and that wc would
consider her taking possession of it as an invasion
of the territory of the United States, that would
justify the President, undei the Constitution, in
calling out the militia to repel it. Wh< n, in addi-
tion to this, we had pledged oui si Ives to the Sta e
of Maine to sustain her, would it not be dishon-
orable to vote down the onlymeasuie that would
enable the Piesident to cairy into effect the iec-
ommendalions of the Senate > It wi ¡sbeAiltl send
a minister to England aftt r this bill liad been neg-
atived by the Senate, the British Ministry vv ould
laugh him to scorn
And under what circumstances aieeve toiefusc
to pass tins bill? Fiom all tin official informa-
tion that is before tis, we li am that the Governor
of New Biunswiek says that lie is positively in-
structed by the British Government to take pos-
session of tins disputed temtoiy, and that he is
determined to do it with all the forces of the pi o- j
vincial Government, both legulars and militia. ||
There is a threat, and not meiely a threat, for it
has been followed up by an actual call foi militia, '
and by armed troops marching into the disputed
territory. We shall disgrace omselvesby íetuin-
ing to our homes, and leaving a sistei State un-
defended, when she has been threatened with in- '
vasion Undti these circumstances, he appealed
to the love of countiy ot the Senatm from New
Jersey—for he believe d that patnotism beats, in
his bosom as stiong as m that of any othu Sen-
ator—to let the vote on this bill be a unanimous
one by adding his voice in its Í i\oi, so th it, when
our Mmistei went to Fn glaml, he might ¡jo aimed
with the stiongt st peiweisof the oniiiitiy lb
knew that theio wen those within tin sound of
his voice who, annul with such a moral pom i
as this bill, passed by the unanimous consent of
both Tfouses of Cong  ss, would givi tin in, < ould
not fail of bunging tins e ontrovcrsy to a success-
ful and happy teimitntion
Ml* NILES said he rejoiced to see this lull so
peifectly acceptable to the mi nibeisof this bodv,
with but one sohtaty e xcoption W< all agre< in
this maltei, that wr an foi piost rvmg the po re
of the country if «o can do so without s icufic nig
our honoi The only question, tin n , is, whethei |
the assuming the altitude the bill pioposts, by
clothing the "Piesident with powti to aim foi de-
fense only, on tht one hand, ind proposing to
opona new negotiation on the oth<i,thc latter
purpose will be frustiated by the formei, as the
Senator fiom New Jersey appiehends > Now, he
had no such appiehcnsioiis All the Senatoi's
objections were, in his -view, founded in onot
Novolunteers could be oigimred until the Pies
ident called foi them by ins pioclamation, and
when they were organized they would be in the
service of the United States, and no matter what
the state of excitement on the Canada borde rs
was, they could notnierch a foot without ordeis
But he would pass oi-ei this objection, as it could
not be suppoited by any show of íeason The
onjy plausible objection i aised was, whether Gi eat
Bntam might not consider the authorizing this
volunteer force as some sort of amenace, as com-
ing to her with the olive branch tn one hand and
the sword in the othei > This was possible, but
what would be the ultimate effect of assuming this
attitude > It would produce this effect' it would ¡
convince the British Government that we are in
earnest in this mattei, and that, though we have
a strong desire for peace, yet we are not willing
to delay the settlement of these difficulties any
¡ longer, and that they must be settled at once or
produce a rupture between the two countries.
The high attitude we assumed towards France,
notwithstanding her complaints of insult, settled
the controversy with her that had lasted for a
quarter of a century. Pass this bill, and the pies-
ent controversy will be settled in twelve months.
Instead of its being a war measure, I, for one,
pronounce it to be a peace measure. It will pre-
serve peace between the two countries If you do
not pass it, it will protract the negotiation, and
perhaps end in a war which will last for yeais.
He stood upon that noble maxim of the late Pres-
ident of the United States, that we desired noth-
ing from foreign nations but what was right, and
would submit to nothing that was wrong
Mr SOUTHARD here moved to strike out
the provision in the bill for raising fifty thousand
volunteers, which motion was rejected—yea 1,

Mr JOHNSON, of Louisiana, explained the              ,
chaiacter of the claims, and urged the importance
of acting upon them promptly, contending that it
was not necessary to refer the bill to the Com-

vent its being passed at this session. As objection
had been made to its involving an appropnation,
which was only $500, he would remove that dif-
