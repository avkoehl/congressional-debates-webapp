JACKSON, TENN., October 29, 1862.

General HAMILTON, Corinth, Miss.:

Order one regiment of cavalry from your command to Bolivar. They will march by way of Bethel. It would also be well to occupy Pocahontas with one division and one regiment of cavalry. This would make a good lookout for an attack on either Bolivar or Corinth, and would protect the bridge at Davis' if we should want to use it, or enable us to destroy it for use of the enemy.

General HAMILTON, Corinth, Miss.:

I am inclined to think that a part of the force from Holly Springs has gone south, either to Mobile or to come around by way of Tupelo to get in on the east of us, and their presence in Ripley is a cover. They might also move a column from there in conjunction with the other.

I have information that a large force of cavalry with some infantry and artillery are now attempting to cross the Hatchie near Brownsville, evidently with the intention of getting on to the river for the purpose of stopping navigation. I will attend to them.

Major General J. B. MCPHERSON, Bolivar, Tenn.:

If the railroad bridge at Davis' Mill is not strongly guarded it should be destroyed. No movement, however, will be risked that will bring on a battle. Ascertain, if possible, how things are at the bridge and around it.

[S. A. HURLBUT,]

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE TENNESSEE,Jackson, October 29, 1862.

Major-General HURLBUT, Commanding District of Jackson:

I am just informed of a movement across the Hatchie of a large force of cavalry with some artillery and infantry under Bowen, evidently with the intention of getting on the river some place to intercept navigation. They are said to be now in the neighborhood of Brownsville. If this is so we will want to send one brigade of infantry with a section of artillery and all the cavalry that can be spared from here and Humboldt to get in their rear and cut them off.

The forces should move toward Bronwsville until they found the direction of the enemy, and then pursue them by the most practicable route. They should go with very little baggage, taking three days' rations in haversacks and seven days' in wagons. Forage will have to be obtained on the route, giving receipts as provided for in general orders. This expedition should be conducted by an efficient officer.

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General.
