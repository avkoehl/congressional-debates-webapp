What is amount of your force, not including 5,000 I am sending? Enemy cannot be over 25,000, Banks' troops being mostly undisciplined.

RICHMOND, December 16, 1862.

General BEAUREGARD, Charleston, S. C.:

The telegraph operator at Goldsborough reports that the railroad buildings at Mount Olive, a station on the Wilmington and Weldon Railroad, ar reported by an engineer sent on the road to have been burnt and the railroad torn up by the enemy. The telegraph line direct to Wilmington is certainly cut; of the rest you must judge. The tone of the dispatch shows alarm and the news may be and exaggerated report.

General Smith, when heard from, was at Goldsborough.

Telegraph General Whiting.

J. A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War.

RICHMOND, December 16, 1862.

General BEAUREGARD, Charleston, S. C.:

A telegram from General Smith confirms the visit of the enemy (some 500 cavalry) to the Mount Olive Station, on the Weldon and Wilmington Railroad; the burning of a turpentine store there, the cutting of the telegraph wire, and some injury, extent not known, to the railroad track. There was serious fighting at White Hall Bridge, resulting in the enemy's being driven back with very heavy loss, while ours was not so. Re-enforcements had not arrived either from here of from you. Cavalry much needed. Re-enforcements from here must have reached him before this hour.

DECEMBER 16, 1862.

General BEAUREGARD, Charleston, S. C.:

Your dispatch received. General Gist's three regiments and one battery received. General Smith has all the transportation at Goldsborough. I have telegraphed for his orders and will let you know. I am only afraid will cut the road between us and Goldsborough.

W. H. C. WHITING.
