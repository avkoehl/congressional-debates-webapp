J. M. BRANNAN,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

GENERAL ORDERS, HDQRS. DEPARTMENT OF THE SOUTH, Numbers 51. Hilton Head, Port Royal, S. C., November 6, 1862.

The general commanding desires to express to that portion of the corps composing the late expedition to Pocotaligo, S. C., under his personal command, viz, the First and Second Brigades, the First New York Engineer Corps, Third Rhode Island Artillery, and Forty-eighth New York Regiments, with the Third Battalion First Massachusetts Cavalry, and sections of light artillery from the First and Third U. S. Artillery Regiments, his approbation of their gallant and distinguished conduct during the expedition.

Though laboring under many disadvantages, yet by superior courage and determination was a greater force of the rebels driven from their strong and well-studied positions at Caston and Frampton, and pursued, flying and in confusion, to their entrancements on the Pocotaligo.

The commanding general has learned from the events of this expedition that he can place the most implicit confidence in the bravery and devotion of his troops, and feels satisfied that in all subsequent operations the Tenth Army Corps will proudly maintain the good reputation they so hardly earned on the plains of the Pocotaligo.

By command of Brigadier General J. M. Brannan:

LOUIS J. LAMBERT,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Tenth Army Corps.
