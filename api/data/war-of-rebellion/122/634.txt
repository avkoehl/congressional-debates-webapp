The total amount of funds available for the service of the medical and hospital department of the Army during the year ending June 30, 1861, was $241,306.31, and the expenditures of that year amounted to $194,126.77, leaving a balance of $6,006.62 in the hands of disbursing agents, and $41,172.92 in the Treasury of the United States.

Of the total sum expended during the fiscal year embraced in this report, $20,088.89 were paid on account of the pay and other claims of private physicians, and $174,037.88 for medical and hospital supplies and for the pay of hospital cooks and nurses.

The accompanying "Annual report of the sick and wounded of the Army of the United States for the year ending June 30, 1861,"*as consolidated from the quarterly reports required in this office from the medical officers of the Army, shows the following results:

At the commencement of the year there were 648 officers and enlisted men remaining on the sick report; of whom 304 were reported as sick, and 344 as convalescent; and the number of cases of diseases and wounds that occurred during the year was 30,879, making an aggregate of 31,527 that have been under medical treatment within the stated period.

The mean strength of the Army during the year, according to the returns in this office, was 13,028.

From the above date it follows that the number of cases of diseases and wounds to the number of officers and enlisted men was 2.37 to 1.

For the same period the ratio of deaths (120) to the man strength of the Army (13,028), was 1 in 108.57, or .92 per cent; and the proportion of deaths to the aggregate number of cases treated (31,527) was 1 in 262.72, or .38 per cent.

Only one year (1845) in the preceding twenty-one years shows a less mortality than the present one.

An Army Medical Board, consisting of three surgeons, was convened at New York in May last for the examination of candidates for appointments in the medical staff of the Army. One hundred and fifty-six candidates were invited by the Secretary of War to appear before that board of examination, 117 of whom reported in person. Ten of this number the board declined to examine on account of physical disqualification, 27 voluntarily withdrew before their examinations were concluded, 2 withdrew without examination, and 78 were fully examined, 63 of whom have been approved.

These approved candidates have all been appointed except 2, 1 of them declining the appointment.

Another medical board was organized by your direction for the examination of applicants for the position of surgeon of brigade. It was convened in this city on the 20th of June, and is still in session. The
