than if they had been converted into money, and
the proceeds were already in the public Treasury.
To squander away this richest and noblest inher-
itance, which any people have ever enjoyed,
upon objects of doubtful constitutionality or ex-
pediency, would be to violate one of the most
important trusts ever committed to any people.
Whilst I do not deny to Congress the power,
when acting bona fide as a proprietor, to give
away portions of them for the purpose of increas-
ing the value of the remainder, yet, considering
the great temptation to abuse this power, we
cannot be too cautious in its exercise.
Actual settlers under existing laws are protected
against other purchasers at public sales, in their
right of preemption, to the extent of a quarter
section, or one hundred and sixty acres of land.
The remainder may then be disposed of at public,
or entered at private, sale in unlimited quantities.
Speculation has of late years prevailed to a
great extent ill the public lands. The consequence
has been that large portions of them have be-
come the property of individuals and companies,
and thus the price is greatly enhanced to those
who desire to purchase for actual settlement. In
order to limit the area of speculation as much as
possible, the extinction of the Indian title and
the extension of the public surveys ought only
to keep pace with the tide of emigration.
If Congress should hereafter grant alternate
sections to Statesor companies, as they have done
heretofore, I recommend that the intermediate
sections retained by the Government be subject
to preemption by actual settlers.
It ought ever to be our cardinal policy to re-
serve the public lands as much as may be for
actual settlers, and this at moderate prices. We
shall thus not only best promote the prosperity
of the new States and Territories, and the power
of the Union, but shall secure homes for our
posterity for many generations.
The extension of our limits has brought with-
in our jurisdiction many additional and populous
tribes of Indians, a large proportion of which are
wild, untractablc, and difficult to control. Pred-
atory and warlike in their disposition and habits,
it is impossible altogether to restrain them from
committing aggressions on each other, as well as
upon our frontier citizens and those emigrating
to our distant States and Territories. Hence ex-
pensive military expeditions are frequently ne-
cessary to overawe and chastise the more lawless
and hostile.
The present system of making them valuable
presents to influence them to remain at peace has
proved ineffectual. It is believed to be the better
policy to colonize them in suitable localities, where
they can receive the rudiments of education and
be gradually induced to adopt habits of industry.
So far as the experiment has been tried it has
worked well in practice, and it will doubtless prove '
to be less expensive than the present system.
The whole number of Indians within our ter-
ritorial limits is believed to be, fiom the best data
in the Interior Department, about three hundred
and twenty-five thousand.
The tribes of Cherokees, Choetaws, Chicka-
saws, and Creeks, settled in the territory set
apart for them west of Arkansas, are rapidly
advancing in education and in all the arts of civ- |
ihzation and self-government; and we may in-
dulge the agreeable anticipation that at no very
distant day they will be incorporated into the
Union as one of the sovereign States.
It will be seen, from the report of the Postmas-
ter General, that the Post Office Department still
continues to depend on the Treasury, as it has
been compelled to do for several years past, for
an important portion of the means of sustaining j
and extending its operations. Their rapid growth
and expansion are shown by a decennial statement
of the number of post offices, and the length of
post roads, commencing with the year 1827. In
that year there were 7,000 post offices; in 1837,
11,177; in 1847,15,146; and in 1857 they number
^6,586. In this year 1,725 post offices have been
established and 704 discontinued, leaving a net
increase of 1,021. The postmasters of 368 offi-
ces are appointed by the President.
The length of post roads, in 1827, was 105,336
miles; in 1837, 141,242 miles; in 1847, 153,818
miles; and in the year 1857 there are 242,601
miles of post road, including 22,530 miles of
railroad, on which the mails are transported.
The expenditures of the Department for the
fiscal year ending on the 30th June, 1857, as ad-
justed by the Auditor, amounted to $11,507,670.
To defray these expenditures there was, to the
credit of the Department, on the 1st July, 1856,
the sum of $789,599; the gross revenue of the
year, including the annual allowances for the
transportation of free mail matter, produced
$8,053,951; and the remainder was supplied by the
appropriation from the Treasury of $2,250,000,
granted by the act of Congress approved August
18, 1856, and by the appropriation of $666,883
made by the act of March 3,1857, leaving $252,703
to be carried to the credit of the Department in
the accounts of the current year. I commend to
your consideration the report of the Department
m relation to the establishment of the overland
mail route from the Mississippi river to San Fran-
cisco, California. The route was selected with
my full concurrence, as the one, in my judgment,
best calculated to attain the important objects
contemplated by Congress.
The late disastrous monetary revulsion may
have one good effect should it cause both the Gov-
ernment and the people to return to the practice
of a wise and judicious economy, both in public
and private expenditures.
An overflowing Treasury has led to habits of
prodigality and extravagance in our legislation.
It has induced Congress to make large appropria-
tions to objects for which they never would have
provided had it been necessary to raise the amount
of revenue required to meet them by increased
taxation or by loans. We are now compelled to
pause in our career, and to scrutinize our expend-
itures with the utmost vigilance; and, in per-
forming this duty, I pledge my cooperation to the
extent of my constitutional competency.
It ought to be observed, at the same time, that
true public economy does not consist in with-
holding the means necessary to accomplish im-
portant national objects intrusted to us by the
Constitution, and especially such as may be neces-
sary for the common defense. In the present
crisis of the country it is our duty to confine our
appropriations to objects of this character, unless
in cases where justice to individuals may demand
a different course. In all cases care ought to be
taken that the money granted by Congress shall
be faithfully and economically applied.
Under the Federal Constitution, "every bill
which shall have passed the House of Represent-
atives and the Senate shall, before it becomes a
law," be approved and signed by the President;
and, if not approved, "he shall return it, with
his objections, to that House in which it origin-
ated." In order to perform this high and re-
sponsible duty, sufficient time must be allowed
the President to read and examine every bill pre-
sented to him for approval. Unless this be af-
forded, the Constitution becomes a dead letter in
this particular; and even worseâ€”it becomes a
means of deception. Our constituents, seeing the
President's approval and signature attached to
each act of Congress, are induced to believe that he
lias actually performed this duty, when, in truth,
nothing is, in many cases, more unfounded.
From the practice of Congress, such an exam-
ination of each bill as the Constitution requires
has been rendered impossible. The most import-
ant business of each session is generally crowded
into its last hours, and the alternative presented
to the President, is either to violate the constitu-
tional duty which he owes to the people, and
approve bills which, for want of time, it is im-
possible he should have examined, or, by his
refusal to do this, subject the country and indi-
viduals to great loss and inconvenience.
Besides, a practice has grown up of late years
to legislate in appropriation bills, at the last hours
of the session, on new and important subjects.
This practice constrains the President to suffer
measures to become laws which he does not ap-
prove, or to incur the risk of stopping the wheels
of the Government by vetoing an appropriation
bill. Formerly , such bills were confined to spe-
cific appropriations for carrying into effect exist-
ing laws and the well-established policy of the
country, and little time was then required by the
President for their examination.
For my own part, I have deliberately determ-
ined that I shall approve no bill which I have not
examined; and it will be a case, of extreme and
most urgent necessity which shall ever induce
me to depart from this rale. I therefore respect-
fully, but earnestly, recommend that tihe two
Houses would allow the President at least two
days previous to the adjournment of eac,h session
within which no new bill shall be presented to
him for approval. Under the existing joint rule,
one day is allowed; but this rule has been hitherto
so constantly suspended in practice, that import-
ant bills continue to be presented to him up till
the very last moments of the session. In a large
majority of cases, no great public inconvenience
can arise from the want of time to examine their
provisions, because the Constitution has declared
that if a bill be presented to the President within
the last ten days of the session, he is not-required
to return it, either with an approval or with a
veto, " in which case it shall not be a law." It
may then lie over, and be taken up and passed at
the next session. Great inconvenience would
only be experienced in regard to appropriation
bills; but fortunately, under the late excellent law
allowing a salary, instead of a per die.m, to mem-
bers of Congress, the expense and inconvenience
of a called session will be greatly reduced.
I cannot conclude without commending to your
favorable consideration the interests of the people
of this District. Without a representative on the
floor of Congress, they have for this very reason
peculiar claims upon our just regard. To this I
know, from my long acquaintance with them,
they are eminently entitled.
