HANCOCK, August 3, 1864.

Brigadier-General KELLEY:

My scouts have just now informed me that the enemy escaped across the river at 12. 30 p. m. Please tell me what route he took from Springfield and all you know of him.

WM. W. AVERELL,

Brigadier-General.

CUMBERLAND, August 3, 1864.

Brigadier-General AVERELL:

The force that attacked me was commanded by McCausland and Bradley Johnson. We fought them from 3. 30 p. m. until dark. About 11 p. m. he fell back from my front and took an obscure mountain road to Old Town, where he crossed yesterday; captured about 80 men in block-house, and disabled an engine attached to iron-clads, which they destroyed with the iron-clads. At 4 p. m. yesterday they moved south toward Romney, burnt the Wire Bridge at Springfield after they crossed over. It is reported by the rebels here that McCausland and Johnson are to be joined by Ransom and the whole return and take Cumberland. I will send your forage and rations as soon as South Branch bridge is repaired, which can be done in a day or two. What news do your scouts bring from below?

B. F. KELLEY,

Brigadier-General.

CUMBERLAND, August 3, 1864--9. 10 p. m.

Brigadier-General AVERELL:

My scouts have just come in and report McCausland's and Johnson's forces at Springfield. Have not burned the Wire Bridge, and they report they are waiting General Ransom, to again attack this place and proceed west into West Virginia. Can't you move this way, either by turnpike tow-path, or by way of Bloomery? Unless they move from Springfield we cannot run trains with any safety.

B. F. KELLEY,

Brigadier-General.

NEW CREEK, August 3, 1864.

General KELLEY:

We are attacked. The force is more than McNeill. They have infantry, cavalry, and artillery with them.

R. STEVENSON,

Colonel.

NEW CREEK, August 3, 1864.

(Received 4. 30 p. m.)

Brigadier-General KELLEY:

Road all right to New Creek. Just came through; all quiet. Sent out cavalry immediately. No information of any rebels near. Will report as soon as scouts come sent out this morning. McNeill captured Maryland cavalry at Sheets' Mill.

J. F. HOY,

Lieutenant-Colonel.
