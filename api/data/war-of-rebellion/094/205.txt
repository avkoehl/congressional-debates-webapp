NEAR NASHVILLE, December 15, 1864-9.55 a. m.

Bvt. Major General J. H. WILSON,

Commanding Cavalry Corps, Military Division of the Mississippi:

GENERAL: General Johnson's forces are not engaged; it is General McArthur, with two brigades of infantry. General J. thinks he can take the position now occupied by the enemy when he is ordered to move, and will try to take the battery.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. H. KNEELAND,

Captain and Acting Aide-de-Camp.

SIX MILES FROM NASHVILLE, December 15, 1864.

Major-General WILSON,

Commanding Cavalry Corps, Military Division of the Mississippi:

GENERAL: General Johnson's command is now six miles from N[ashville] on the C[harlotte] pike. They have pressed the enemy back on what seems to be a strong line, but I think Colonel Harrison will push them out in a short time (as soon as he gets his brigade in position). They did not leave their guns in the position occupied by them this morning hardly long enough for General J. to get them.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. H. KNEELAND,

Captain and Acting Aide-de-Camp.
HDQRS. CAVALRY CORPS, MIL. DIV. OF THE MISSISSIPPI, December 15, 1864-12 m.

Brigadier General R. W. JOHNSON,Commanding Sixth Division:

GENERAL: The major-general commanding directs that you push forward with the utmost rapidity. Hatch is far in advance, and as you will have so [much] farther to march it will take the utmost exertion to keep up. The general would like you to communicate frequently with him.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

A. J. ALEXANDER,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Chief of Staff.

DECEMBER 15, 1864-1 p. m.

General WILSON,

Commanding Cavalry Corps:

GENERAL: The enemy has been driven from the creek, the hills on south bank occupied, and we are driving them handsomely through the valley beyond. Prisoners taken report Chalmers' division in our front. Our advance is slow, but I think my portion of the line is as far advanced as any portion of the cavalry line at this time. We did not capture the guns for reasons which I can fully explain to you at another time.

Respectfully,

R. W. JOHNSON,

Brigadier-General.
