Major-General HUMPHREYS,Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: The following dispatch from the plank road station is respectfully forwarded:

At 2.40 p.m. about 1,800 infantry moved from the woods on the extreme left visible from this point and disappeared west of large fort.

I judge from the movements of this body of troops that they were either just relieved from the intrenchments or picked-line, or were returning from working upon some work not visible from our station, though they may be moving for some other object.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

B. F. FISHER,

Major and Chief Signal Officer.
