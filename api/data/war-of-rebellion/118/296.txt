COLONEL: I have received no instructions from you concerning issues to the Arkansas prisoners now confined at Camp Butler, near this city. I have a quantity of gray clothing on hand unfit for issue to volunteers which might answer for the prisoners if desirable. Please forward copies of any general regulations concerning prisoners which may have been recently adopted and oblige,

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Honorable L. W. POWELL, U. S. Senate, Washington, D. C.

SIR: Your letter of yesterday is received and I have the honor to reply that after seeing you and before I had given directions for the release of prisoners from Kentucky in whose behalf you have presented petitions under general instructions for the release of prisoners of war on their taking the oath of allegiance I received further instructions verbally that petitions for the release of guerrillas and those charged with aiding them would not be acted no until they had received the approval of the Governor of the State. When I stated in my note that his approval would insure the immediate release of the prisoner I gave only my own impression and should have stated it would finally depend on the decision of the Secretary of War.

I inclose herewith in accordance with your request the petitions* presented by you.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. HOFFMAN,

Colonel Third Infantry, Commissary-General of Prisoners.
