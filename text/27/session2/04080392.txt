The bill having been read—
Mr WISE remarked that the brll had passed the Senate bya
 nammou3 vote The bill had been well considered and di
gested m both Houses—the Committee on Naval Affairs of the
Mouse having reported a bill precisely similar He asked
that the question might be taken, and that the committee
should at once resume the consideration of the general appro-
priation bill
No amendment having been offered, the bill was laid aside,
to be reported to the House.
GENERAL APPROPRIATION BILL.
The committee resumed the reconsideration of the bill mak

The pending question being on the motion oí Mr Profi-it to

" Ño 161 For compensation and mileage of the members of
the Legislative Council, (of Florida,) pay of officers, stationery,
fuel, printing rent, furniture, and all othel incidental and con

Mr PROFF1T withdrew the amendment
Item No 153 being under consideration, in the words f >1.
lowing For the salaries of eight Associate Judges, at $4,500,
835,000—
Mr CROSS moved an amendment piovidmg for the with-
holding $500 fioni the salary of each and eveiyone of the said
judges who fails to hold the regular circuit court in anydistnct
dr his circuit, unless the same be occasioned by sickness or un
avoidable acudant
j Mr. ROOSEVfiLT called attention to that clause of the Con-
stitution which provides that the judges "shall hold their offices
■¿during good behavior, and shall, at stated times, receive for
their Services"?  compensatiort which shall not be diminished
during their continuancem office."
Mr, POPE said he would be very happy to co operate with
the gentleman from Arkansas [Mr Cross] in providing any re-
medy for this case within the powers of Congress He be-
lieved it was impossible for this gentleman to attend that Court
and attend theSupreme Court. If the law required his attend
anee at both at the same time, and if he attended at Washing
ton, it was not a dereliction of duty Mi McKin ey was a man
of as much industry as any manin the United States He (Mr.
P ) had known him Inns
A proposition had been made by a new arrangement of the
ludges to equalize the duties among them fie would suggest
to the gentleman from Arkansas that the remedy he proposed
was one which was not authorized by the t onstitution of the
United States, but was inadmissible altogether If Judge Me
Kmley was gu.Ily of ciimiml negligence he was for his im
peachment, butthereduitioi ol the salary wis incompatible
with the Constitution Before they should acton a judge asa
public officer, would it not be fair that an investigation should
be made bya committee why he had not attended his courts?
Before the subject was investigated, and belore the gen-
tleman had had an opportunity of making known why this
neglect orcurre 1, he was opposed to acting on this case But
another and an insuperable difficulty was from the Constitution
They could not undertake, under the Constitution, to dock the
salaries 01 judges and the ptrnriple was an important one—a
radical one, which was inunde I to secute that Department
against all the powers ol the Government and of public opinion,
it was ono of the sacred princil los of the CYn titution
Mr THOMPnON of Mississippi was gla 1 that the gentle
man from Arkansas had biouglit this subject to tho notice of
the House Hlsmotion raised a giavc and seirous question,
and it was this—how hi and in what way this House, reflecting
the popular feeling of this countiy, could aflectorcontiolthe
conduct of those who held lifetime estates ¡n public offices'!
Are they so high that our shult arms are insufficient to n arh
them, except by the slow and uncertain remedy of impeach-
ment! Is a public office!, whose compensation cannot be di
mimshed during his continuance in office, and whose term of
service has no period but thatof his natural life, to ful and re
fuse to perform In  dunes at pleasure, anil have we no remedy!
If the remedy proposed of withholding the purse, be the tine
one, he thought it wis high time to exert that power The
conduct of Judge MiKinley deserved to be noticed in some way
by Congress But the gentleman from Kentucky [Mr Pope)
was mistaken in the proposition under consideration, if he sup
posed it was mti ndeti to bear upon the past neglect of this hono.

Last winter, said Mi T the Legislature of the State ol Mis-
sissippi forwarded resolutions to him as one of the Representa
trves of that State in Congress, instructing him to prefer an im-
peachment against this honorable judge But they came to
hand at so late a period in the session, that he and his colleague
then were unable to institute any proceedings Since then, he
had examined the question, and he was lather inclined to the
opinion that it would be of no avail to attempt an impeach
ment The Constitution provides that impeachments shall be
only 101 "treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misde
meanors " In this case, the talents and the learning of Judge
McKinley are admitted His integrity and honor as a man and
as a judge are not at all questioned But he has not shown a
willingness to discharge the duties assigned him His only sin
now charged was a non user of office, a non feasance of duly
But to him, Mr T said this was not the most offensive part of
his conduct It is rumored, and he believed the rumor, that
last fall, before the sitting of the court at Jackson, h s honor
wrote to the marshal of'he southern drstnet of Mississippi, m
substance, that he would come and hold the court at Jackson if
he felt securein his person, but hough he did notdoubt the cou-
rage and the willingness of the matshal to defend him, yet he
doubted his ability, and therefore could not come Now, this
piece of insolence towards the people of Mississippi should not
pass unrebuked by him From what motive does such conduct
spring! Oi what principle can such a course be justified m a
high public functional v? Is Corgress to fatten such men with
high sálanos to play off such tucks before an unoffending peo
pie that ii^d thern!
One of two things is inevitable Choose which horn of the
dilemma >ou please; this conduct evinces, on the part of the
Judge, cowardice, a want of moral nrmness, or else an unblush
ing effronteiy and bare faced impudence Shall such things be
tolerated! Were there no means left to force an officer of this
description to perfoim his duty! If this provision was not suf
ficient, he hoped gentlemen would go with him m applying
another remedy WovrM gentlemen go with him in the im-
peachment of this officer! [Cries of "Yes, yes "] If they would,
he pi omisedihat next session lie would propose this remedy, if
this honorable judge did not move on in the performance of his
duty
Mr ADAMS said, from the facts stated by the gentlemen from
Arkansas and Mississippi, [Messrs Cross and Thompson,]
he had no doubt whatever that it was the duty of this
House, their solemn duty, to take this subject into their con
sideration, but he believed wuh the gentleman from Ken-
tucky [Mr Pope] that the mode proposed by the gen
tleman from Aikansas was not consistent with the Constitu
tionolthoU btates Itwasiuithermoreobiectionablebecause
it would not lemovethe evil If a judge of the courts of the
United totates had been so extiemely lemisstnthe performance
of his duty, he ought to be noticed by this House in a different
manner from suspending any part of his salary if he should
continuem this failuie of duty It was perfectly well known
that the non user of an office wis as capable of impeachment
as the mal user of it There could he no possible doubt that,
on tho facts stated by the gentlemen from Aikansas and Mi sis
sippi, this House t\as perfectly competent to initiate measures
foi the «inpeachment of this ludge It was very possible, too,
that the mere fact of commencing the operation would remedy
the evil and secure the future performance by this officer of
Ins dt'ty To stop the salaiy of this ofii er not only would not
lemedy the evil, hut would suffer it to pass wuh impunity If
a judge of the Unite I States hail systematically, and for cor
lupt purposes, negle t°d Ins duty, this House ought to do
something moie than to say he should be punished by reducing
his salary
Mi THOMPSON said he ha 1 not intended to convey the idea
tint he had neglected his duty from corrupt purposes
Mi ADAMS The gentleman hid said it was in consequence
of his havingsuffeied an inchgnltv, and the gentleman charged
him with cottaidice Cowaidicc in ajudgewasas much coi
ruptionas bnbeiy
He hoped the gentleman from Aikansas would withdiaw his
motion and introduce a resolution into this House in tt e usual
form ol incipient ímpeiclinien', making inquiry whether the
judge had so conducted hrmseK as to requ re the application
of the constitutional prnvision That would call the judge hrm
self to account to this House—the grand mquest of the people
of the Ui ned ¡states Perhaps he might offer reasons which
would justily his conduct It mi^ht not be necessaiy to
prosecute the pi oceedmg any further to serme the pel fbrmance
of his duty,
Mi GWIVBaid before the gentleman from Aikansas with
drew bis motion, he wished to say something in defence of
Judge McKinley He was cognisant of the facts charged
against the fudge, and be thought the charges were unjust, and
had no proper foundation, for he knew of his own knowledge
ihit this judge h «1 dischai sed more duty than any judge on the
Supieme Bench of he U ited States It was impossible for
him to attend the court in Aikansas, he had not time lie
knew that an indignity ha 1 been offered to the Judge at Iarks"n,
Mi sissipp , and on that account he had refused to attend some
of the terms of that emit, but it was his intention to hold that

the labor of the judges, and he would willingly join ¡n euher of
these measures, buttie would not join in denunc attonsof Judge
McKinley for not doing what it was physically impossible for
him to do Notwithstanding the complaints against him, he
performed more labor than any of the judges on the bench The
remedy for the evils complained of should be cmed by-the legis-
lation ofCongress, and not by requiring an impossibility of the
judges of the Supreme Court
Another charge was bi ought against Judge McKinley, that ho
hasiemovedfrom his circuit This is not the fact He was le-
gislated out of the circuit by Congress, and his present residence
is infinitely more convenient to the citizens of the ninth circuit
than his former one In fact it is the most convenient he can
occupy, without removing to the sickly regions of the South, by
which he would not only endanger his own life but that of his
family Judge McKinley has been most cruelly treated and un-
justly assailed, and he would defend him if, m his opinion, he
deserved , regardlessof the consequences tohimselfpersonally.
Mr. FILLMORE rose for the purpose of saying that it must
be apparent to the committee that this evil, if evil it was,
could not be corrected in this way. if thiswasa crimmalneg-
lect of duly, the remedy was in peachment If it was an omis-
sion to perform a duly because the duttes were more than a
fudge could perform, the remedy laid in rearranging the
judges, or appointing another, or putting some of the business
on the distnct court He therefoie appealed to the gentleman
from Arkansas to withdraw his motion
Mr SAMSON MASON expiessctl his s.ncere hope that the
Committee on the Judrcrary (to whrch thrs petition of Judge
McKinley has been referred) would take an early occasion to
report a bill to correct the flagrant injustice perpetrated on
fudge McKinley He considered that this judae had been mal
treated most flagran ly Heghad dutres to perform, accordrng
to statistics collectid by the ¡secretary of State nearly equal to
two thuds of the business performed by all the judi/es In one
of his districts Ire had been maltreated, and he had been charged
wr h cowardrce
Mr THOMPSON rnqurred if the genthman meant to say
that he (Mr  i ) had made such a charge!
Mr MASON said he meant to say what he had said This
judge had a very hard task to perform, he had been insulted and
repudiated m one portion of his circuit, and had a mass of busi-
siness to attend to which no man possessed the ability 10 do He
did hope that the committee would see thatjnstice was done m
the premises There ought to be something like an equalization
ol labor of the judges
Mr BARNARD obtained the floor
Mr CROSS offered to withdraw his amendment
Mr BARNARD said he was very glad to hear the gentleman
fioni Arkansas offei to withdraw his proposition, for many rea-
sons He could not siy that he wis sorty he had introduced it,
because it had given the gentleman and others an opportunity
to bring before tlie notice of this House the conduct of one of
the Supreme Judges of the United States Thrs was a very ir
regular mode of proceeding He had risen for the purpose of
entering his solemn piotest against this mode of reachingthe
subject of the cun luct of a j ublrc officer, wnether ajudge or
other officer, and f afticnlarlvajudge, when the Constirurron of
the United States had thrown around tfese officers its broad
shield of defence agnnstpreeisely such attacks
He should not entei at all cither into the accusation or de-
fence of ludge McKinley The gentleman from Ohio [Mr.
Mason] had said that .his memorial of Judge McKinley was
sometime since referí ed to the Committee on the Judrciary,
and he Mr B took occasron to say that the Comrmttee on the
Judiciaiy intended to do their duty on ths subject, [Mr Ma
son I do not doubt it at all,] and especially after the gentle
lecture the committee had leceived in regard to it This ad
monition the een leman had given the Committee on the Judi-
ciary reminded him of the gentle admonitions this House was
constantly leceivmg froui var ous quarters of the country—
fiorj friend ind foe— ail whichimphed a neglect of duty They
weie const«ntl> told that this House was delaying and neglect
ing its duty and he begged leave to say, in a parenthesis, that
this IIou e had oope n ore labor and accomplished more ser-
vices or the public dui ing the present session than had been
accomplished during the same lenatli of time by any of its pre-
decessor in any poruon uf tiie history of this country [A
laugh ]
[Mr Arnold    Except the called sess on ]
Yes, (continued Mr B ) possib y except the called session,
but if there was any particular credit for the labor at the called
session he took it for gianted that they should come in foi a
portion of it
This subject wasbefore the Committee on the Judiciary, and
they did not mean to neglect their duty He had, for reasons
abundantly satisfactory to him, neglected to call it up They
hadnotyeten eiedon their duty, and, consrdenng what was
performing in the other end of the Capitol, it would he merely
iaboi thrown away
He desired once moie to protest against this mode of inter-
