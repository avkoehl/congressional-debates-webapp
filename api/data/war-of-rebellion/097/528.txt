PETERSBURG, April 3, 1865-10.20 a.m.

Major-General SHERIDAN:

Lieutenant Allen, of your staff, has just reached here. I have no special orders to send further than those taken by Major Hudson, of my staff, this morning. The troops got off from here early, marching by the River and Cox roads. It is understood that the enemy will make a stand at Amelia Court-House, with the expectation of holding the road between Danville and Lynchburg. The first object of present movement will be to intercept Lee's army, and the second to secure Burkeville. I have ordered the road to be put in order up to the latter place as soon as possible. I shall hold that place if Lee stops at Danville, and shall hold it anyhow until his policy is indicated. Make your movements according to this programme.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

P. S.-I shall move by the Cox road. Will start from here about 12 m.

U. S. GRANT.
