Numbers 3. Reports of Brigadier General William W. Averell, U. S. Army, commanding expedition from Beverly.

NEAR FALLING SPRINGS, W. VA.,

November 7, 1863.

SIR: On the 5th instant, I attacked Jenkins in front of Mill Point and drove him from his position, with trifling loss on either side. Yesterday morning he was re-enforced by General Echols, from Lewisburg, with Patton's brigade and a regiment of Jenkins's command, and assumed a strong position upon the summit of Droops Mountain, a position similar to that upon South Mountain, in Maryland, but stronger from natural difficulties and breast-works. I turned the enemy's left with infantry, when he became disturbed made an attack direct with four regiments of dismounted cavalry.

The victory was decisive and the enemy's retreat became a total rout. His forces, throwing away their arms, became scattered in every direction. I pursued those that he kept together until after dark. His wounded and many prisoners and arms have fallen into our hands. My loss is about 100 officers and men. Troops in excellent spirits, with plenty of ammunition.

WM. W. AVERELL,

Brigadier-General.

Brigadier-General KELLEY,

Commanding Department.
