I withdrew my command by order of Colonel Morgan and reformed my lines, my right resting at the orphan asylum, and again advanced, throwing forward a strong line of skirmishers. Later, the enemy opened heavily with a battery against Colonel Thompson, on the west of the railroad, and I deployed the Sixty-eighth Indiana, supported by the Eighteenth Ohio, and pressed back the enemy's skirmishers on the flank of his battery. My skirmishers of the Sixty-eighth Indiana advanced skillfully and rapidly, opened so effective a fire upon the enemy's flank as to totally silence the fire of his battery for the balance of the day.

Friday, December 16, I moved at 7 a.m., the Eighteenth U. S. Colored Troops, Major Joy commanding, being added to my command. We moved over the battle-field of the day before and found our dead all stripped of their clothing and left exposed upon the open field. After crossing the Nolensville road we came in sight of the enemy, strongly posted on the Overton Hill, near the Franklin road, and at about noon joined the left of the Fourth Army Corps, in line facing south in front of the position. Here we remained until about 4 p.m., the enemy annoying our position by a constant fire upon us. We then formed to assault Overton Hill. I formed my brigade on the left of that of Colonel Thompson, as follows: Eighteenth U. S. Colored Troops and Second Battalion, Captain Brown commanding, in the first line; Eighteenth Ohio and Sixty-eighth Indiana in the second line. We advanced through a small thicket and crossed rapidly over a wide, open corn-field under a sharp fire of grape and canister. While crossing this field the brigade of Colonel Thompson (or several regiments of it) moved by left oblique so rapidly as to throw a portion of my command into confusion, and finally crossed my front and came out on my left. The inexperience of the men of the Second Battalion, the wounding of the brave Captain Brown, commanding, as also the absence of the next officer in rank, Captain Riggs, Twenty-seventh Ohio Volunteers, threw that organization in such confusion that it could not be rallied, and I saw it no more during the campaign until I arrived at Murfreesborough. The remainder of the brigade pushed promptly forward, crossed the field, and pushed their skirmishers up to the base of the hill under the enemy's works. But the first assault of the Fourth Corps had failed, my line had become too weak to accomplish much without support, and none was at hand. I halted my line in the timber, and held my ground until ordered to retire. I reformed at nearly right angles and easterly from my original position, and on the right of Colonel Thompson. Here we threw up barricades. But we again moved forward, my right closing on the left of the Fourth Corps, and the enemy fled in great confusion from the hill, and the whole line pressed forward in pursuit and encamped for the night near Brentwood.

Saturday, 17th, we moved forward, generally deployed in line of battle, on the east of the Franklin road, reaching Franklin at dark. We did no fighting. Sunday, 18th, after marching three miles south of Franklin, the command was ordered to Murfreesborough, where it arrived Tuesday, the 20th instant.

I have the honor to forward lists of killed, wounded, and missing herewith.*

We captured about 60 prisoners, a portion of whom were turned over and receipted, for, and others were informally transferred to the Fourth Corps and other commands.
