were engaged during the war, and who intend
to vote the Democratic ticket in the next cam-
paign? A list of the names of the men who
committed the frauds of which the gentleman
from Illinois [Mr. Marshall] speaks during
that first year of Mr. Lincoln's administra-
tion and their present party affiliations would
be an interesting study for the gentleman^ and
forever seal his lips upon that subject. Espe-
cially would it preclude any farther accusa-
tions against the Union Republican party for
their conduct.
[Here the hammer fell.]
Mr. SCHENCK. I propose to bring this
matter to a close, and, after replying to what
gentlemen have said who seem to misappre-
end the matter before the House, will try to
do so.
Mr. MAYNARD. I hope the gentleman
will give the gentleman from Missouri ten min-
utes after the previous question has been sec-
ended.
Mr. SCHENCK. I propose to give the
gentleman from Missouri a few minutes in
order to complete his remarks. I do not expect
to occupy more than an hour, and perhaps not
more than half an hoar. I call the previous
question.
The previous question was seconded an4 the

Mr. SUMNER. I offer the resolutions and
doings of a public meeting of the citizens of
Worcester, Massachusetts, in which they call
upon Congress to take measures to protect
naturalized citizens in their rights, and also to
intercede with Great Britain for the release of
certain citizens who, it is said, have been
wrongfully convicted. In other days, Mr. Pres-
ident, it was not the habit to present resolu-
tions of this character, but I observe that they
have been presented, and these conclude with
a resolution asking that a copy should be sent
to the Representatives and Senators in Con-
gress. I therefore present the resolutions and
ask their reference to the Committee on Foreign

the New York Evening Post of the 7th instant
and the Philadelphia Evening Bulletin of the
same date what purports to be an abstract or
synopsis of the report of the Committee on Mili-
tary Affairs respecting the suspension of Secre-
tary Stanton. The report Of the President on
that subject, as the Senate will recollect, was
referred to the Committee on Military Affairs,
and since that time it has been in the posses-
sion of that committee and under their con-
sideration. While under their consideration
it became my duty to have a certain connec-
tion with it not now necessary to speak of
further. While the matter was in my hands it
seems that it transpired that that committee
had committed the subject to me for investi-
gation, and the newspapers in various parts of
the country announced such to be the fact. I
was waited upon last Thursdayby two persons,
one bearing the name of De B. Randolph
Keim, who holds himself out as correspondent
or reporter of the New York Herald, and an-
other person of the name of W. Scott Smith,
announcing himself as the " manager of tho
