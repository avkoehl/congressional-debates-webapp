HEADQUARTERS,Washington, September 6, 1862-11.15 p. M.

General F. J. PORTER:

General McClellan says the interior line of works is to be held, including those at Chain Bridge, and from De Kalb to Forts Ward and Worth and Fort Lyon. The heavy guns are to be withdrawn from Upton's Hill to-night, and the work there occupied by an advance guard, which should hold it against any attack of pickets or inferior force. Munson's Hill had perhaps better be abandoned. You must use your own judgment as to the force necessary at the Seminary, but the forts in front of it must be securely held. McDowell's corps has orders to move at once, and you should take measures to relieve his pickets immediately. Reynolds' division is of necessity detached temporarily. The exigency leaves no alternative, but it will soon rejoin your command. General Whipple, at Arlington, and Colonel Tyler, at Fort Richardson, can give you all information about garrisons of the works. They can both be reached by telegraph. Please acknowledge.

S. WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

GENERAL ORDERS, HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS, Numbers 15. Fort Corcoran, Va., September 6, 1862.

The charge of Forts Corcoran, Haggerty, Bennett, De Kalb, Woodbury, Cass, Tillinghast, Craig, Albany, Jackson, Runyon, Richardson, Barnard, Scott, Blenker, Ward, Worth, and Ellsworth having been assigned by Major-General McClellan to Major General F. J. Porter, he hereby assumes command of these forts and of the troops designed to defend them. Commanding officers of the troops will at once send in a report of their command and their locations. Officers will be sent from these headquarters to procure information of each command. Commanding officers will at once furnish the necessary information called for and take their men through such exercises as may be required. The major-general commanding calls upon every officer and soldier to exert himself to place the command to which he belongs in the most efficient condition, and by his example of obedience to orders and attention to duty prove to his country that he is here for her service alone, and to work with an earnest heart to save her in this her day of trial. Such examples will inspire their companions and bring to a happy conclusion this contest.

By command of Major General F. J. Porter:

FRED. T. LOCKE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
