Brigadier General L. THOMAS,

Adjutant-General U. S. Army, Louisville, Ky.:

GENERAL: Herewith I send you application of Colonel Wallace Campbell, One hundred and tenth U. S. Colored Infantry, for a court of inquiry. I respectfully invite your attention to the following facts: Colonel Campbell has been exchanged and ordered to report to his command at Savannah, Ga. He will leave New York on the 18th instant. He desires, if compatible with the interests of the service, to be brought before a court of inquiry before going to his command. Two months ago he made application to Major General G. H. Thomas for a court of inquiry. This was before he knew that his case had been referred to you by the War Department for investigation. Nothing has been heard from it. Colonel C. will be in Chicago until the 14th instant. His address is Chicago, Box 3535.

I have the honor to be, general, your obedient servant,

A. L. CHETLAIN,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
