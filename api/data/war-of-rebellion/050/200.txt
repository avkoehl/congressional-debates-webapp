and placed Negley as a support behind Baird, on the extreme left. The gap thus made in the line he filled by moving Brannan, Johnson, and Wood to the left, leaving a gap which he intended to fill by crowding Davis and Sheridan likewise to the left, which would have made the whole line shorter by the extent of one division. But before this operation could be completed the battle became so hot that, instead of filling this gap in the manner he had intended, he had to precipitate Van Cleve's division into it, thus leaving himself no reserves and no means of re-enforcing the left wing, except by withdrawing forces from his right, and in the very act of this withdrawal the enemy fell upon him.

It is plain that having committed an error in too much extending his line originally, he committed another and a more pregnant error in the mode of contracting it which he adopted.

The fatal consequences of these error might have been escaped but for the act of that dangerous blunderhead McCook, who always imperils everything.

CHATTANOOGA, September 24-8.30 p.m.

Reconnaissance in force to-day shows enemy encamped on Chattanooga Creek along base Lookout Mountain. Probably other camps east of Missionary Ridge on Chickamauga. No other places near here where an army can find water. No distinct evidence rebels intend attack Chattanooga,nor is it certain all Bragg's army is here, nor are there any signs he is moving elsewhere.

CHATTANOOGA, September 25-10.30 a.m.

No demonstration from enemy. A captain of our cavalry our on scouting expedition with 35 men came in last night, making his way through Bragg's camps on Chickamauga east of Missionary Ridge. Led by a shrewd guide he came through by ways in the woods and was not seen till he reached infantry pickets at west base of ridge, and there he dashed through,losing 4 men. He reports the Chickamauga artillery moving was heard during the night. He thinks rebel force discovered on Chattanooga Creek by reconnaissance yesterday has been withdrawn from fear of being cut off, a thing Rosecrans had determined to try.

A negro brought in from Forrest's cavalry last night reports that since Monday 10,000 men have left Bragg for Mobile. Among our wounded prisoners are 10 or 12 who say they belong to General Ewell's corps. Rebel General Adams, wounded, in hospital here, says slaughter in their army was awful, and he has enough of war.
