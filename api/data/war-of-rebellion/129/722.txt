RALEIGH, October 11, 1864.

General B. BRAGG,

Richmond, Va.:

There is a meeting of Governors at Augusta on Monday, the 17th, to consult about how to spare more men for the service. I am very anxious to know what North Carolina has done in comparison with the other States. Can you furnish the information from the Adjutant-General's Office? If so, write me to Augusta, Ga.

Z. B. VANCE,

Governor.

[Indorsement.]

Without a very protracted and laborious researcn it is not possible to ascertain the number of men. The regiments from North Carolina were unusually full at the outset. There are in the Confederate service sixty-seven regiments, five battalions, and twelve unattached companies. Two State regiments are at present doing service under Confederate authoritty, but have not been transferred to Confederate service. Thus far nine battalions of reserves have been organized.
