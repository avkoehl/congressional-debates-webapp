LEXINGTON, September 29, 1864-10 a. m.

Brigadier General J. D. WEBSTER, Nashville, Tenn.:

Your telegram of 2 p. m. yesterday just received. I have forwarded the order to General Burbridge, but doubt if it reaches him. His rear is infested with bushwhackers.

J. BATES DICKSON,

Captain and Assistant Adjutant-General.

KNOXVILLE, TENN., September 29, 1864.

Captain J. BATES DICKSON, Assistant Adjutant-General:

General Sherman's order to General Burbridge received. The wire is down between here and Bull's Gap, and dispatch will have to be sent by courier from Strawberry Plains. The distance is so great it will be almost impossible to get it through even if the enemy are out of the way. Have you sent a courier through on General Burbridge's route? Notify General Webster of the impracticability of this route. Do you know anything of the whereabouts of General Schofield?

G. M. BASCOM,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Assistant Adjutant-General.

CUMBERLAND GAP, September 29, 1864.

Captain J. BATES DICKSON, Assistant Adjutant-General:

Cannot send your dispatch before 1 o'clock to-morrow. My citizen scout will be in at that time. Will that be satisfactory?

W. Y. DILLARD,

Colonel, &amp;c.

CUMBERLAND GAP, September 29, 1864.

Captain J. B. DICKSON:

I think I can, but it is rather hazardous. Perhaps one could make the trip with more safety from Bull's Gap. I have just returned from Jonesville on a raid; killed 3 rebels, wounded 2, took 3 prisoners and 27 horses.
