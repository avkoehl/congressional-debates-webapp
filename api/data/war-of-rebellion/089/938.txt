required by existing orders. In obedience to orders of Brigadier-General Gregg I sent with the command eleven wagons, leaving the ten remaining in park fully loaded, as I have a quantity of other ordnance stores on hand, received on the evening of the 6th instant, and which the regiments were unable to receive. Since this morning I have issued all the Burnside carbine cartridges, but have in my train the other ammunition required by the regiments now here, and have telegraphed to City Point for the Burnside carbine cartridges.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

FRANK B. ALLIBONE,

Captain and Acting Ordnance Officer, Second Div., Cavalry Corps.
