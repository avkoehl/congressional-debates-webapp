TUB CONCESSIONAL GLOBE.
January 21,
But after I had examined all the facts in the
case, and had become perfectly satisfied that
there had been no opportunity for this man to
defraud the Government in any way, I went
before the Committee of Claims and did what
1 could to secure favorable action on hiselaim.
This was not done hastily ; I allowed the matter
to sleep during a portion of the Thirty-Ninth
and most of (he Fortieth Congresses. The com-
mittee were ready to report this bill just at the
closc of the Fortieth Congress. There were
two bills of this character; one was passed by
the House without opposition, and this only
failed because the morning hour expired. The
robbery happened at the same time in both
cases.
Mr. WASHBURN, of Massachusetts. I will
briefly repeat the facts in this case. The col-
lector in this case kept, his stamps in the safest
possible place in town. The committee are
satisfied that the safe of the express company
was the best .safe in the town. There is no
bank there, and the officer did all he could to
protect the property of the Government. Un-
der these circumstances burglars broke open
the safe and stole the property of the Govern-
ment, there being no fault on the part of this
officer, he having done the best he could to
protect the property of the Government. The
committee believe that no business man would
hold his agent responsible for an hour under
like circumstances, and that the Government
cannot hold ifs officer responsible under like
circumstances. Therefore the committee have
reported this bill.
Mr. WELKKR. Will the gentleman allow
me to ask a question ?
Mr. WASIIIiURN, of Massachusetts Cer-
tainly.
Mr. WE LICE II. I want to ask the gentle-
man from Massachusetts [Mr. Washburn]
whether this ease was submitted to the com-
mittee on sworn testimony'!
Mr. WASIIBURN, of Massachusetts. It.
was.
Mr. WKLKER. I desire to say that when
the Committer of Claims Wave investigated a
subject like this on sworn evidence I would
as leave concur in the recommendation of the
committee as to refer the matter to the Court
of Claims, considering the manner in which
that court, from want of time, is compelled to
consider and decide such cases.
Mr. WASHBURN, of Massachusetts. I now
call the previous question.
The previous question was seconded and the
main question ordered ; and under the opera-
tion thereof the l)i 11 was ordered to be engrossed
and read a third time; and being engrossed,
it was accordingly read the third time, and
passed.
Mr. WA.SI1BURN, of Massachusetts, moved
to reconsider the vote by which the bill was
pissed ; and also moved that the motion to
reconsider be laid on the table.
The latter motion was agreed to.
  FREDERICK lillOSIVK.
Mr. WASHBURN, of Massachusetts, moved
that the Committee of Claims be discharged
from the further consideration ol' the petition
and papers in the case of Frederick Brosive for
limber used by the Government, and that the
same be laid on the table.
The motion was agreed to; and the report
accompanying the same ordered to be printed.

moved that the Committee of Claims be dis-

to Joseph Harmon, late captain of the fifth
regiment of Indiana volunteer cavalry, the pay
of a captain of cavalry in the volunteer service
from July 20, 1864, to April 6,1865, deducting
the amount paid him as sergeant of cavalry in
the same regiment, for the same period; the
amount to be paid out of money appropriated
or to be appropriated for the payment of the
Army of the United States.
Mr. HOLMAN. 1 ask that the report accom-
panying the bill be read.
The Clerk read the report. It states that it
appears from the memorial and the evidence
that Captain Harmon was promoted July 20,
1804, from the position of sergeant to that of
captain of company F, filling a proper vacancy ;
that he performed duty as such, was captured
on tho 31st of July following in the line of his
duty, and was imprisoned until his discharge
in the spring of 1865 ; that he was mustered as
captain from April 6, 1865, on the commission
of the Governor of Indiana, his capture and
imprisonment having prevented his being mus-
tered as such previously. The committee there-
fore recommend that he be allowed from July
20, 1864, to April 6,1805, the pay of a captain
of cavalry, deducting therefrom the amount paid
him for any lower grade of military service for
that period.
