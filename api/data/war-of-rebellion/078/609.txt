for them, and I have ordered 600 effective men to be supplied with accouterments. All will be supplied with arms (1,200), and the balance of the accoutrements furnished as early as practicable. With this addition to your force you will then be able, I hope, to cope with the raiding parties of the enemy and restore confidence. As you are aware, General Polk took with him all the infantry and my old command, so it is necessary for you to be very active. It is necessary for me to keep a considerable force in North MISSISSIPPI to repel any raid from Memphis into the prairie country, or operate against any force from North Alabama, as the enemy now hold Decatur, which is strongly fortified. Everything available has been sent to Johnston. I am anxious to send you and additional section of artillery, but can only raise about twenty horses. Can you assist me in the shape of horses and mules? Paxton has orders to send everything to Johnston. I desire you as soon as your force will permit to keep a force near Rodney to operate on the river with a section of artillery.

I am, general, yours respectfully,

S. D. LEE,

Major-General.

Major General N. B. FORREST,

Following dispatch just received from Captain Henderson:

Memphis scout reports last night force in and around there 10,000 whites, and evidently a move on hand. Can't get particulars. Scouting parties of Germantown and Olive Branch daily. Byhalia scout, 2 o'clock to-day, reports ten regiments still camped at White's Station. A move of some sort on hand. Will know to-morrow night.

Brigadier-General CHALMERS,

Tupelo:

The probabilities are that Duckworth will remain at Grenada for some time. His command will have to remain, so you had better send him his wagons.
