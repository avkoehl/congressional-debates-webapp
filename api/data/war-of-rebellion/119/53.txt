The people of Ohio are willing to co-operate zealously with you in every effort warranted by the Constitution to restore the union of the States but they cannot consent to abandon those fundamental principles of civil liberty which are essential to their existence as a free people.

In their name we ask that by a revocation of the order of his banishment Mr. Vallandigham may be restored to the enjoyment of those rights of which they believe he has been unconstitutionally deprived.

We have the honor to be respectfully, yours, &amp;c.,

Colonel WILLIAM HOFFMAN, Commissary-General of Prisoners:

COLONEL: I have just received yours of the 24th instant. The rolls of paroled men at Camp Chase cannot be used in exchange in the way you propose. They may, however, be otherwise of service. The best mode of correcting the evil of occasionally overcrowding Fort Norfolk with prisoners of war, who have been detained here for want of transportation to City Point, is to have orders issued not to send any prisoners of war here for exchange, from Baltimore or other places, without previous notice having been given, and an opportunity afforded of stopping their coming, unless the prisoners come on transports, which can proceed directly to City Point. To send to Fort Delaware, as you propose, any occasioned excess would require the same amount of transportation which would take them to City Point. We have no proper place to confine prisoners of war, in any large number, in this department.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WM. H. LUDLOW,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Agent for Exchange.
