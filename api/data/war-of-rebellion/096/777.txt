GENERAL ORDERS, HDQRS. MIDDLE MILITARY DIVISION, Numbers 27. March 1, 1865.

It having come to the notice of the major-general commanding that department and district commanders, and even provost-marshals of posts, are in the habit of passing citizens through the lines, it is hereby ordered that no passes for this purpose will be respected, unless countersigned by the major-general commanding or granted by superior authority.

By command of Major-General Hancock:

F. C. NEWHALL,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS MIDDLE MILITARY DIVISION, March 1, 1865.

Brigadier-General TOWNSEND, Assistant Adjutant-General:

The order assigning General Carroll to me assigned him as brevet major-general. Finding that General Stevenson ranked him, I requested that he might be assigned to duty on his brevet rank, and received a dispatch from the Adjutant-General's Department saying that he would be so assigned. On the strength of this dispatch, I ordered him to relieve General Stevenson at Cumberland. This evening I received a dispatch from Major Chalfin saying General Carroll had not been brevetted. If he has not been brevetted I shall be obliged to modify my arrangements. If any error has occurred it has not been mine nor General Carroll's, and I hope he may not have the mortification of finding he has no brevet after having entered upon duty as a brevet major-general. I know his services well, and think there is strong ground for his promotion. I request that the matter may be referred to the Secretary of War that it may be definitely settled.
