It seems a mixed force of cavalry and infantry;no infantry; no artillery yet seen Have sent 500 or 600 cavalry to Richmond, with direction to watch road to Big Hill. Am holding everything in readiness, and will attack the enemy soon as his direction and intentions are clear. If I move a force toward him now, be can elude, and, if he desires, it, can get this side of this, and do considerable damage. Troops in Ohio should now be sent- Judah's division to lebanon, Carter's to Danville, and before leaving Cincinnati all deficiencies should be supplied. Much time will certainly be lost if they come here and wait the sending of horses, arms, and equipments.

Before receiving dispatch about prisoners and paroles, I had issued an order concerning paroles, stating that the effect of existing orders and instructions was absolutely to prohibit the giving of paroles by any officers or soldiers of this corp.

Shall I come of Cincinnati now?

LEXINGTON, July 28, 1863.

GENERAL: A part of Sanders' command has got here. Major Foley's command (100), part of Sander's force, are at Nicholasville. There are about 500 cavalry now here, 550 infantry, and a battery. When did the troops leave Covington? There is no news from the direction of Richmond. Sanders' troops did not stop till they got here. Gilbert telegraphed me that the would be at Hickman by 8 p. m. Byrd must be there soon. There will then be 2,000 infantry, and,when Gilber's cavalry arrives, 1,000 cavalry, besides General Fry's recruits and the Eighth East Tennessee. It is ample to hold the place.

LEXINGTON, July 29, 1863-9.30 p. m.

GENERAL: I sent courier to Sanders, informing him of the condition of things at Paris, and directed hi to proceed there by the shortest road. I have now information his advanced guard, 4 miles from Winchester, that the enemy is still there in force. Have notified Sanders by courier, and direction him to rout the force the Winchester and then go to Paris. He is in the right position. I think the enemy's force consists of Scott's [George N.] Folk's, Ashby's, [W. P.] Owne's, [G. W.] McKenzie's, and [T. C.]Goode's [commands], part of the Fifth North Carolina and six pieces of artillery not over 2,000 all told, and all mounted. [These] are all that passed London, and no more coming; 500 to 800 infantry are yet at Cumberland and Big Creek, and 400 cavalry at Cumberland yet, under [James E.] Carter. Enemy captured telegraphs instruments at Winchester, and may be getting our messages.
