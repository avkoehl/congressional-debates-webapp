THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
Mr Webster, as well as myself, opposed this bill, and
both voted against it If you read the debates that took
place in the Senate on the subject, on the 21st, 22d, and
23d February, 1833,1 think you will be convinced that
neither Mr Wfbster nor myself could have had any pre
vious notice of this bill I have not the file of papers by
me, but you may easily find them at VV «tshmgton £ will,
however, refer you to Mr Webster's speech upon this
bill, reported in Niles's Register, 4th series, volume 8, page
7, in which you will find abundant proof that he could not
have been consulted as to its object or details Among
other expressions are these " There was no expectation
at the eoinmeneementof this short session that such a bill
would be passed The Senate had not had time to know
the pleasure of their masters No opportunity had been
offered for obtaining a knowledge of cither the course of
public opinion, or the effect of this measure on the public
interests " If Mr Webster had been consulted on this
bill, v, ould he have made such declarations' or, if made,
would they hive pished unanswered ?
Mr Ciay had previously stated to me his fears, that
Mr Verplanck's bill, which he considered as an Admin
istration measure, or some other bill originating fiom the
same source, would pass, greatly to the injury, if not de
struetion, of the iniiiufactunng interest of the country, and
suggested the propriety of making turther concessions, in
addition to those of the law of 1833, as the only means of
saving even a part ol the protective system, but without
stating what those concessions should be    I mswered him
that I did not tear Mr Vfrplanck's bill, that it could never
pass, that it wis   ilready so altered and amended that I
did not believe Mr Verplanck would vote tor it him
self, and that, at all events, we should suffer the law of
1832 to go into complete operation before we «hould make
any alterations in its provisions
There was no obligation on the part of Mr Clay to con
suit me on his bill, what he said to me 1 considered as a
mere act of courtesy The bill originated with himself,
without any participation of the Committee on Manutae
tures, of which both he and I were members The fact,
he wtver, that I was associated w ith bun on that commit
tee, led to a belief that I must have been acquainted with
the provisions of the bill before it was matured and sub
jected me to some unpleasant inquiries as to tins 1 ict, in
one of which, no doubt, I stated to jou the conversation I
had had with Mr WrasxER

Hon  Thomas H   Benton   Washington, D   C
Mr B said he had felt himself called on to
write to Governor Dickeisoii, to know whether
he had made any mistake in the statement he gave
as to what had passed between them He now
piesented Goveinor Dickerson's own words, by
which it would be seen that the statement he had
made was substantially coirect
Mr WEBSTER observed that it was, of
course, tery well known that he differed with the
Senator fiom Kentucky as to the propriety of ¡
passing the compiomise act He nevci com-
plained, however, of any want of eoiutesy or
kindness m the Senator foi not consulting him on
the subject The truth was, that the Senator
from Kentucky did communicate to him, some
weeks befoie, that he had it in contemplan "in to
bring foiward an impoitant measure, without
saying what that measure was He certainly did
become acquainted with the mearme before the
Senator introduced it, but he could not say that
he knew of it before the notice was given in the
Senate He was inclined to think that the con-
versation of which Governor Diokerson speaks,
was about the time of the notice given of the inten-
tion of the Senatoi fiom Kentucky to introduce
the bill All he had at pieoent to say was, that,
diffeung as he did with the Senator fiom Ken-
tucky, with legaid to the measure spoken of, he
made no complaint as to his not being consulted
Mr CLAY, of Kentucky, said he did not know
that it was a matter of the slightest consequence
to the Senate or the public to be informed of the
prehminaiy steps which led to the adoption of a
gieat public measure, it was sufficient to say that
it was submitted by himself, on his own respons
lbihty, and, after a full discussion in the commit-
tee, in the Senate, and in the House of Repicsent
átives, was ulopted by decisive majonttts, and
responded to by the nation with an enthusiasm
almost unexampled He was not responsible to
any whethei consultations were or were not held
on the subject before its introduction to the Sen-
ate, it was sufficient for him to say that it was
intioduced, and passed in the manner he had
mentioned
Mr  C  said he came to this city from Ashland,
in Dccembei, 1832     At that time theie was an I
impression generally prevalent that the piotect
lve system was about to receive a fatal shock, I
and would be prostrated     Immediately after his '
arrival, he proceeded to Philadelphia, in compa-
ny with a friend from Louisiana, since deceased
While there, the pioject of a compromise of this
great and important question presented itself to
his mind, and was the subject of reflection and
consultation with that fuend. The Senator from
Massachusetts [Mr Webster] passed through
Philadelphia about that time, and the plan was
communicated to him it was true that the Sen-
ator expressed his disapprobation of it. A com-
mittee of very intelligent gentlemen interested in
manufactures waited on him, (Mr. C ,) to know
what could be done to save them from the danger
that was threatening them To this committee
he communicated his plan of settling this ques-
tion, at least for a term of years, and it met their
hearty concurrence and approval
Upon his return to this city, he consulted the
Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Davis] upon
the subject, and he at first expressed his appro
bation of it, but after further consultation and re-
flection upon it his views were changed, and he
voted against it He thought it was prior to his
introduction of the bill into the Senate, that he
called a meeting of his political fnends at his
lodgings There were some eight oi ten present,
and his impression was that the Senator from
Massachusetts was there certain he was that he
was invited The bill was read at this meeting,
and its provisions discussed, and the fact that he
(Mr C ) had such a measuie in contemplation
was notouous in both Houses of Congress, and
one or two motions were made by persons who
had some glimpses of the plan, to anticipate its
introduction He regaided these particulars re
specting the preliminaries to the introduction of
the compromise act, exceptas matters of history,
ummpoitant, the great and beneficial results that
had followed its adoption was a sufficient excuse
for its introduction
With regard to the Senator from New Jeisey,
[Mr Dickerson,] whose letter has been read, he
was upon such terms with him as to foibid a con-
fidential intercouise between them He knew
that he was a warm friend of the manufacturing
inteiest, but he was also a friend of the Admin
ístration, and he stood as many others who con
sideied their devotion to the Administration par-
amount to their devotion to the highest interests
of their country It seems that, fiom his lettei,
he did mention the matter to htm, and it might
be so, but he had no recollection of having done
so
Mr BENTON rose to say that he had no con-
nection with this conversational debate, except in
the single point of the accuiacy of his statement
of what had passed between Governor Dickerson
and himself He had lead the lettei for the single
pmpobe of showing that he had committed no
eiror m reporting the conversation of that gentle-
man His object was accomplished by the read
ing of the letter itself, and he believed it was
appaient that there was no mistake eithei in
himself or in Goveinor Dickeison, and that the
statement ot the latter was very consistent with
the lemaiks which the leading of the letter had
called forth                                                                    |
Mr DAVIS well lemembered the transactions j
of the perioel refei icel to, for he felt a very strong
ínteres* m wh it was gung on He was ready and I
willing to do the Senitm from Kentucky all the I
justice he was entitle d to, and could corroborate I
his statement except as to thafpau in which the <
Senator stated that he (Mi D ) was at one time i
favoiablv disposed towaids the compromise act, I
which was not i>o, as he had been opposed to it I
from first to 1 est                                                          I
Mi WEBVTCR said thtt the Senator from
Ke utueky [\li Ci \y] see med to suppose that he
(Mi W ) was pit-sent at a consultation prior to j
the introduction of the bill in the Senate, or that j
he was invited to attend The lat er was very .
probable, but he had no iccollection whatever of I
being present at any such consul ation                   J;
Mi    KNIGH r made a few  obs,ei vations, too |
inaudible to be understood, which terminated the
discussion on the subject
INTERFERENCE IN   ELECTIONS
The Senate then pioceedcd to ttte consideration I
of the bill to prevent the interfeience of Pedeial
ofKceis in elections, as the spenal older of the
day, when
Mr. WALL, who had the floor, addressed the
Senate in aft argumentative* speech of great length,
m reply to Mr. CitiTTBNWEif, and in oppositioW
to the bill
After the reception of some reports from tfce
Executive Departments,
On motion of Mr. RIVES, the Senate adjourned.
