G. W. RANDOLPH,

Secretary of War.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA,July 4, 1862.

Surg. J. SWINBURNE,

SIR: I regret to hear of the extreme suffering of the sick and wounded Federal prisoners who have fallen into our hands. I will do all that lies in my power to alleviate their sufferings. I will have steps taken to give you every facility in transporting them to Savage Station. I am willing to release the sick and wounded on their parole not to bear arms against us until regularly exchanged, but at present I have o means of carrying such an arrangement into effect. Certainly such a release would be a great relief to them. Those who are well and in attendance upon the hospitals could not be included in such an arrangement except such as are left for that purpose, but will be sent into the interior until regularly exchanged.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. E. LEE.

General.
