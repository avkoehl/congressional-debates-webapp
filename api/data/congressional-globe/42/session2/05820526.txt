As good evidence of tho economy of the present
Administration as can be desired may be found in
thq following illustration:
In 1860 the customs collections were $53,187,511 87,
and the cost of collecting the same was $3,324,430 53,
or6.25+. In 1871 thecoliections were $206,270,408 05,
and the cost of collecting $6,560,672 61, or 3. i]-r, less
than one half of" the amount which it cost the
Buchanan administration in 1860.
" Democratic Financiering.—The receipts and ex-
penditures of the Government, as published by the
Secretary of tho Treasury, showed that the expend-
itures of that administration in excess of its receipts
were as follows:
For the fiscal year 1S58 $27,529,904 43
For tho fiscal year 1S59  15,584,511 10
For the fiscal year 1860  7,065,990 56
For the fiscal year 1861 to the close of
the administration in March  10,054,694 59
"Making a total of $60,265,100 68 extravagantly ex-
pended in excess of income, in a time of profound
peace. In order to provide for this deficit and meet
current expenses, loans had to bo negotiated at a
heavy discount, so bad was the credit of tho Govern-
ment, and the nation was thereby plunged into a
debt solely in consequence of the profligate squan-
dering of the people s money by this weak and imbe-
cile administration. When Mr. Buchanan entered
upon his duties as Chief Magistrate there was in the
Treasury cash amounting to $19,870,114 10. He left
in the Treasury for the incoming administration but
$2,496,035 32, a debt of $04,842,287 88, and a war which
has oost fearful sacrifice of blood and treasure."
Now, Mr. President, I desire to draw the
attention of the Senate but a short time to
some of the specific charges that have been
made by the Senator from Massachusetts. He
says the President is guilty of nepotism, and,
as I said, several pages of his speech are
copied for the purpose of showing first the
origin of the word. It is necessary for a learned
man when he discourses upon a word to show
its origin. We then find the origin of the word
"nepotism." He shows that it is of Italian
origin, and then goes on through the history of
the Popes, the history of those who once ruled
Rome, to show how many nephews and kinsfolk
they appointed to office. Then he comes down
to President Grant, and he charges the President
of the United States with having usurped the
power of the presidential office, and made it a
mere perquisite and appointed to office his kins-
folk, and for that reason he ought not to be
recognized as a suitable candidate for Presi-
dent again.
Now I want to put this question to the
country. I admit that he has appointed some
of his relatives to office ; but I want the Sen-
ator from Massachusetts to point his finger to
the law that forbids that being done. If it is
not in violation of law, is there anything that
shows that it is in violation of good morals ?
It seems to me for a man to take care of his
own household is not in violation of good
morals. It certainly is in violation of no law ;
and I believe we are told that " he who pro-
videth not for his own honsehold hath denied
the faith and is worse than an infidel." The
Senator does not believe there is anything
like wit or genius or common sense in the
President. I will repeat a remark thai; I heard
that he had made once, that perhaps has
aroused the anger of the Senator to some
extent. A gentleman once said to the Presi-
dent that the Senator from Massachusetts did
not altogether believe the Bible. The Presi-
dent quietly said there was a reason for that,
and that was that he did not write it himself.
[Laughter.]
Now, if it is not any violation of law to
appoint yoqr relatives to office, if it is not in
violation of any moral principle, then I ask
the Senator from Massachusetts why this ar-
raignment? I will say in response to it, with-
out going any further than merely making a
statement, that the President of the United
States has appointed to office some of his rel-
atives. The President of the United States
lias a wife ; he has children; he loves that
wife, and he loves these children. His wife
and his children have relatives. The Pres-
ident of the United States respects these rel-
atives. He has a father; he loves that father,
who is an old man, tottering now on the verge
of the grave. He was appointed postmaster
at Covington, Kentucky, by President John-
son. When his son became President he came
tottering along to Washington city to visit his
son, in whom he bad great pride, and justly
so, too; and he said to him, "My son, I de-
sire to retain that little office to furnish me
a livelihood in my old days." Tell me, sir,
where the man is that has a palpitating heart
in his bosom who would refuse such a request?
The Senator from Massachusetts himself
might; but if so, he is the only man in this
Senate Chamber, in my judgment, who possi-
bly could do so. His wife perhaps had a
brother-in-law or a friend that wanted an
office; and the Senator says he got an office
at New Orleans. That was given, but he has
been notified to resigu. I have nothing to
say in reference to that, except that I under-
stand he will resign. 1 know not whether he
ought to resign or not; it is none of my busi-
ness. But the other relatives that he speaks
of holding office indiscriminately, I happen to
know something about, and I will speak from
my own knowledge. He has a few relatives.
One is a mail agent on a railroad, at a thousand
or twelve hundred dollars a year. One, Cap-
tain Ross, is a clerk in the Third Auditor's
office. Captain Ross was the bearer of letters
as mail messenger to ray headquarters fre-
quently during the war. He is a cousin of
President Grant. I went myself to the Third
Auditor and asked that appointment, and he
was appointed on my recommendation. It is
charged that he was appointed because he is
a relative of President Grant. The President
knew nothing of it. I obtained the appoint-
ment myself. Another one of his relatives
was appointed to an office in a Territory. That
has been paraded, too, all over the country that
he was appointed being a relative of President
Grant. 1 say to the Senate to-day, that that
man was appointed on the recommendation of
gentlemen in Chicago, unknown to President
Grant, and I went myself to the Secretary of
the Interior and obtained the appointment for
them. These things I state so far as they go,
because they are within my own knowledge,
and I am responsible for a portion of them
myself; and the portion that I am responsible
for, it is my duty to state here, and I do so
state it.
This is paraded as almost a crime, and
therefore a man is not qualified to be Pres-
ident if he happens to have a father or rela-
tives of any kind, or if he happens to appoint
a few of his relatives to office. These are a
portion of the disqualifications of a President
of the United States as prescribed by the Sen-
ator from Massachusetts ! On this theory he
might stand a better chance for President
than on some other for aught I know. But if
we only elect those who have no relatives, I
fear we would all claim to be poor orphans
picked up on the street, and thereby fitted for
the office of President.
The next proposition of the Senator is " gift-
taking recompensed by official positions." I
understand that in slander there is such a
thing as innuendo, and the Senator from Mas-
sachusetts, by the innuendoes in his speech,
would leave the impression on the country
that President Grant has appointed men to
office who mad: him gifts, because of the fact
that they did make gifts ; in other words, that
the gift was the consideration for the office;
therefore it was a corrupt bargain between the
President and the office-taker. So far as this
intimation, insinuation, or innuendo is con-
cerned, as any one may please to term it, I say,
and take the responsibility, for the President
of the United State3, of denouncing it as false
and basely false. I do so for the reason that
men who have been appointed to office were
appointed to the two offices he mentioned
because of their friendship to the President,
and their ability for the duties of the office,
and their fealty to the Republican party.
Let us see for a moment what this gift-taking
is. Is it a crime for a man to receive gifts
who has accomplished great deeds for his
country ? If it is, let us examine the history
of the country for a moment. President Grant
was a great chieftain. He had achieved great
things for this Government. He was a great
commander of armies and forces. He was
victorious in all his battles. When he came
home from a victorious war, when States
had been joined together that had before been
severed, and people were united that had
been divided by war, the people of the
country felt grateful to him for his achieve-
ments and what he had done for them. There
was no way in which some of the wealthy men
of this country believed they could show their
gratitude to this great chieftain more appro-
priately, inasmuch as he was a man of small
means, than by presenting him with that
which would make him a comfortable income
