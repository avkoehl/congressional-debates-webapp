Major-General THOMAS,

Commanding Fourteenth Army Corps:

In addition to the accompanying dispatch, the general commanding further directs that you open direct communication with General McCook, and take care to hurt the enemy as much as possible. It is important to know whether he retreats on Rome or Cedar Bluff. If the enemy has passed La Fayette toward Rome he will threaten McCook; if he has not passed this point, he will endanger Crittenden. Much depends on the promptitude of your movements.
