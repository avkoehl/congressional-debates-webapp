(City to Battery Bee.)

FEBRUARY 14, 1865-1. 30 a.m.

Colonel RHETT:

I have received no estimate of the number of the enemy's troops. Why has it not been sent? Why has Blake not reported? It is important to keep me advised, and must be done. Send if necessary special courier to-night to ascertain facts. Use artillery horses if you have no cavalry. Will send engineers in the morning. Stop Quirk's company engineer troops now at McCormick's Landing to do the work at the lines. They will leave for the city in the morning, unless you stop them to-night. Signal men will be sent.

TALIAFERRO,

General.

R. NORTH:

We called you since 2 o'clock this a.m. to send the above message.

RUSKILL,

Sergeant.

Sergeant METARD:

Proceed at once to Palmetto Battery and open communications with Battery Marshall.

HARRISON,

Lieutenant and Chief Signal Officer.

(Battery Bee to City.)

Captain PAGE,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

No attack up to 11. 20 last p.m. Conner's men have arrived, and Andersonville reported safe. No firing heard during the night. Will inform you promptly if anything occurs.

RHETT,

Colonel.

(Battery Bee to Sumter.)

FEBRUARY 14, [1865]-4. 10 p.m.

Captain PAGE,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

All quiet at Andersonville. Colonel Rhett wishes to know if you have ordered an engineer company to the lines.

JONES,

Lieutenant.

Captain LAMAR,

Assistant Commissary of Subsistence, Fort Sumter:

PRINGLE,

Major.

(Battery Bee to Sumter.)

FEBRUARY 15, 1865-6 a.m.

Captain PAGE,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

I think that if the whole of Parker's battery be left at Andersonville, one gun of Le Gardeur's battery be sent to Gioham's, and another to Buck Hall, with a support of 100 men, that it would render the position secure. Have not made the arrangements, nor shall not do it unless I receive orders from General Taliaferro, as the firing on Stono renders it impossible Le Gardeur's will be needed there.

RHETT,

Colonel.

FEBRUARY 15, 1865-6 p.m.

Captain PAGE,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

Your dispatch just received, 2. 10 p.m. The information you ask for has been sent you in repeated dispatches. I will leave Mount Pleasant immediately to see the general. I should like to send two Parrott guns now on the lines to Andersonville and send on a section of Parker's battery to McClellanville.

RHETT,

Colonel.
