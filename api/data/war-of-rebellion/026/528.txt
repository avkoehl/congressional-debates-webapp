SUFFOLK, VA., January 21, 1863.

Major-General DIX:

The prisoners say that large additions have been made to the force on Blackwater - several new Virginia regiments and some Louisiana and Tennessee; that the force is larger than ever before; a camp of five regiments at Jerusalem. It accords with the general tenor of reports from prisoners, deserters, &amp;c.

SUFFOLK, VA., January 22, 1863.

Major-General DIX:

It has seemed to me that the Confederates have thrown some extra force on the Blackwater, with a view of holding as much force here as possible and then of sending it to North Carolina, if called for. I cannot believe that they will at this wet season undertake a movement by way of South Mills on Portsmouth. Pryor's command has been somewhat increased and materially improved by exchanges of his new regiments for old ones. This may explain the departure from petersburg of the troops reported by Colonel Ludlow, and also a statement of one of the deserters from Weldon that troops were passing both ways on the Seaboard road. Having these views I have not asked for any troops, reserving that action until something positive reaches me, but all the time adding to the strength of the position.

SUFFOLK, January 23, 1863.

Major-General DIX:

Major Stratton with a suitable force will leave in the morning, unless very stormy, to make a thorough examination of the Dismal Swamp, passing in at Deep Creek and going out at South Mills. He will be four or five days, and will procure information.

SUFFOLK, January 24, 1863.

Major-General DIX:

About Monday I propose sending some 4,000 or 5,000 to Blackwater, under Corcoran or Foster, if weather favors. It leaves this place very weak, but I want to feel of them in some manner.
