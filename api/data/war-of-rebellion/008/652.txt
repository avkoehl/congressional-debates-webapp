HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE MISSOURI,
Saint Louis, Mo., March 10, 1862.

Major-General CURTIS,

Commanding Army of the Southwest:

I congratulate you and your command on the glorious victory just gained. You have proved yourselves as brave in battle as enduring of fatigued and hardship.

A grateful country will honor you for both.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General.

This victory, so decisive and thus commenced, by no means insures you repose. You must expect to bear further trials of your endurance and valor. The general will confide in you as in veterans and will rely upon your discipline, devotion, and well-tried bravery to give tone and effect to our further movements, supported, as we shall be, by gallant forces now joining our standard. While we rejoice we should not forget to contribute kindness to our wounded comrades and a tear to the memory of those who lie buried on the field, and reverently to ascribe thanks to the God of Battles, who giveth us the victory.

A grateful people will provide for and comfort the bereaved, and the rocky cliffs of the Ozark Mountains will remain monuments to the memory of those who fought and fell for their country at the battle of Pea Ridge.

By command of Major-General Curtis:

H. Z. CURTIS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
