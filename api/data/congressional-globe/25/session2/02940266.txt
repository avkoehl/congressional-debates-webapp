SUBSCRIPTION TO NILES'S REGISTER
The busmess first in order was the consideration
of the following resolution, reported by Mr PAT-
TON, fjom the Committee on the Library, on
Saturday last, and then postponed till to-day
Resolved, That the Clerk of the House of Repre-
sentative  be directed to subscribe for ten numbers
of "Niles's Register" for each member of the
House, to be dehveted once a week Provided, The
editor ot said Register will agree to publish in, or
as a part of, said work, at least once a week, under
the direction of the Clerk, the Journals of the
House, with the yeas and nays on all questions
Providedffurther, That the editor of said Register
will also agree to publish, at the end of every ses-
sion of Congress, under the direction of the said
officer, a supplement to said work, containing all
the laws pass«d thereat, and treaties ratified by the
Senate to which shall be piefixed a copious index,
to be approved of bj said officer, and furnish one
copy thereof, free of charge, to each member of
Congress for the time being
Mr PATTON entered into a detailed statement
of the object proposed by this resolution, the effect
of which was merely to circulate among the peo-
ple the journals, votes, and laws oí Congress, to
the extent of six thousand copies, at a cost of
only five thousand dolíais, and this too in a per
manent form, where they would be always acces-
sible for reference Mr Niles did not ask for any
augmentation of the subscription pnce to the Re-
gister, but looked for remuneration from an en-
larged subscription list, m consequence of the
work being hereby made more intrinsically valua-
ble. The publication of the laws alone, in ephe-
meral papers, cost three times as much as was in-
volved in this resolution
Mr PARKER of New 'Vork said he was op-
posed to the resolution, that he could never cons nt
that the membeis of the House snould be furnished
weekly, at the publ'c expense, \xiih more than
2,400 copies of "Niles's Register," or any other
newspaper It would involve an expense at the
rate of $ 12,100 per annum, and he denied that this
could be paid out of the contingent fund of ihe
House, under the language oí the appropriation
bill, as it was passed yesterday That bill required
that the contingent fund should be expended for
the ordinary expenses of the House, and " for no
other purposes " He intended to move to lay this
resolution on the able If that was not sustained,
he should move to strike out " Niles's Register,"
in the second line, and insert " Democratic Re-
new " If any periodical was to be so largely
patronned by Congress, he should prefer the tetter,
though he could not vote for the resolution Mr
P concluded by moving to lay it on the table
Mr GRIFFIN asked for the yeas and nays,
which were ordered, and were—jeas 8G nays T9
So the resolution was laid on the tab e
At a subsequent stage,
Mr. WILLI <VMS of Kentucky moved a recon-
sideration of the vote by which the resolution foi a
subscription to Niles's Register Mas laid on the
table, as, upon reflection, he thought he had gnen
a wrong vote
Mr BOON moved to lay this mot on on the
table, and carded for the yeas and najs, which were
ordered, and were—yeas 88, na>s 84
So the motion to rec^nsiiei was laid on the table
Mr WHITTLESEY of Ohio, from the Com-
mittee of Claims, made an unlavorable report on
the case of Col Joseph Broun, which was laid on
the table
Mr SMITH, from the Committee on Com-
merce, reported a bill making appropnations for
the erection of custom-houses at New Orleans, Pm-
ladelphia, and Savannah, which was read twice,
and committed to a Committee of the Whole on
the state of the Union
The SPEAKER laid before the House a supple
mental.repoit to the annual report of the Commis
sioner of the General Land Olice,  which, on mo
tion of Mr  CASEY, was referred to tne Commit-
tee on the Public Lands

pose additional duties as depositares upon certain

lie money, and to regulate the safe-keeping, trans-
fer, and disbursement of the public moneys of the
United States," having been read twice by its title
Mr CAMBRELENG moved its íeferencc to the
Committee of Ways and Means
Mr PICKENS rose, and said that before this
motion was acted upon, considering the import-
ance of the subject, he desired to be informed on
ceitam point, so that he might know how to shape
his course upon the motion, and he should apolo-
gise to the House for tiespassmg in this way from
the acknowledged importance of the subject, and
the deep interest in veived in it
Mr P would not have desired information upon
this subject, had it not been for an article whiGh
appeared m the official journal of this morning,
which he had perused most painfully, and which
had an ominous bearing He desired to know,
from the honorable chairman of the Committee oí
Ways and Means, whether it was intended, directly
or indirectly, to give this bill from the Senate the
preference over the bill reported already through
heir own committee, upon the same subject, to
'hat House i He saw it intimated, that perhaps
the provision [Mi Calhoun's] which had been
stricken out in the Senate's bill might be adached
to some other appropriate bill, or introduced in an
independent form, and in this article (from the
Globe) he had seen not the slightest reference
to the House bill upon this subject Now Mr P
considered this a question which, according to the
theory of om Government, was peculiarly under
the jurisdiction of this House, and, upon that con-
sideration alone, he should be disposed to give
their ewn bill the preference, as a precedent upon
this subject But he did not desire to trespass
upon the House, and should not, but he most anx-
iously desired to know whether, in ths future
action of the Committee of Ways and Means, so
far as the chairman was concerned, there was to
be the slightest preference to the Senate's bill over
that reported to the House from that committee'!
Mr P conemded, by sajing that ha propounded
this inquiry most re&pectiully, and it was due to
the House to say that he had not the slightest con-
ference with that gentleman He asked it candid-
ly and frankly It wis due to the House and to
the country to know wheihei that emasculated bill,
yes said he, a thing having the form of a man w Hh
the spirit of a eunuch, was to have directly, or indi-
rectly, anj preferenee given it over the one reporte J
to this House on the same subject If he was led
to believe that it would not, and tnit our bill was
was to be made the rallying point foi the lountij,
it would give him the gieatest pleasure to vole with
the gentleman, [Mr Camereleng,] to give it the
ordinary reference to his committee There was a
great question involved in the bill, and no tempta-
tion could make him falter in his course
Mi CAMBRELE\G would answei the gentle-
man most cheerfully For himself, is a member
of the Committee ot Way.> and Means, and he
thought he could almost answer foi every one of
his colleagues on that committee, that he and they
did infinitely prefer the bill reported to this House
to the bill of the Senate They had seriously and
thoroughly exami led all the piovisions of the lat-
ter, and they had seaous objections to mary of its
details, for some of its details besides those advoca-
ted by the gentleman from South Carolina, involv-
ing principles of very grave importance, and the
bill reported from the Committee of Wiys and
Means was, almost tw o-thirds of it, a new bill en-
tire!} For one, he should not depart from one
single section oi feature of that bill, and should
certainly feel it his duty, as a measute of this cha-
racter snould emanate from the House, to give the
House bill the preference
Mi SERGLA1NT thought the chairman of the
Committee of Ways and Means had made one íe-
mark from which Mi S dissented Tne gentle-
man said that he thought he could answer for a'l
his colleagues on the committee
Mr CAMBRELENG begged to be i nderstood
as not, of course, intending to include those gentle-
men opposed to both bills
Mr SERGfcANT He docs not mean all the
committee then, but thinks the majority arc in fa-
vor of the House bill    Now, Mr. S did not know
.....■-.........................'■    ■■ ■     "*•
which to prefer, that is, he did not know which
was worse, and that was about the state of any
opinion or judgment he then had If the bill was
what the gentleman from South Carolina had
stated, an eunuch, why it was a sort of thing that,
in some parts of the world, was entrusted with the
care of a treasury, and if he could bring himself
to believe that it was as innocent, by reason of its
incompetence, as that class of persons were, he
should have less objection to it, but he believed
that it had vigor enough to do mischief, and that tt
was not safe to trust either one or the other bill,
and for that very reason that those who were to be
entrusted with the Treasury were perfectly com-
petent persons to maltreat—to betray their trust—
to be led by temptation to injure those who had
entrusted them with the machinery Both bills he
believed to be exactly the same, the difference be-
tween them being that the one was to have the
power of keeping bank notes, and the other that
of keeping gold and silver, if it could get it
All Mr S rose to say was, that, as one of th«
Committee of Ways and Means, he had no prefer-
ence for either, but had strong objections to both,
and was at a loss to know which was worst.
Mr HAYNES said, that although not expressly
called upon, he would, as a member of the Com-
mittee of Wajs and Means, express hts decided
preference of the bill reported by that committee to
the bill from the Senate Desirous as he might be
to answer the remarks of the honorable member
from Pennsylvania, [Mr Sergeant,] he would not
consume the time of the House by doing so
Mr PATTON was opposed to try this expe-
dient in an} form He was opposed to the bill re-
p jrted by the Committee of Ways and Means, and
did not think there was the least necessity in such
a reference of the Senate bill as that now moved.
This subject had been before that committee twice
alreidj, ind they had given the House the ñmt of
their labors and meditations upon the subject He
considered it extiemely important to the best inte-
rests of this countiy that this question should be de-
cided, and decided promptly, and he should, when
he sat down, make a motion which he hoped would
bring to the test what w as the judgment of the
majority of that House, in regard to the principles
of this measuie He was compelled, in order to
accomplish his object of quieting, if the ma-
jonty of the House should be opposed to this
meisure of quieting the apprehen ions of the
country, justly excited by the continued confidence
w ith which it is alleged that this measure, fraught,
as he sincerely and solemnly believed, with the
most mischievous tendency„to the best interests of
the country, and with the greatest danger, m a
political point of \ le w, was to be determined speedily
and promptly by a vote of that House The object
he had m view, and which, in his view of the ques-
tion, was so important, could not be attained but by
a vote which was not m the form of a direct rejec-
tion of this measure, but which was a decisive in-
dication, and he hoped the vote would be so regard-
ed of the opinions of the House against any bill
containing the principles of this measure,
whether it be the bill from the Senate, or that
reported from the Committee of Ways and Means.
He did not urge, therefore, as a reason why this
matter should not be referred, the fact that a majo-
rity of that committee had examined and were op-
posed to it, because he did not desire that the vote
which he should ask the House to take, should de-
pend upon an} diflerences of opinion about the de-
tai's or modifications, which did not touch the great
pi mciples of the measure
Mr P said he was aware that ¡here were seve-
ral gentlemen anxious to present substitutes to one
or the othei bill—substitutes essentially changing
the details, and, m fact, the principles of both mea-
sures, and, at the first blush, gentlemen might be
deposed not to sustain the motion he was about to
malte, but there would be no difficulty whatever.
Gentlemen who had such propositions to make
might make them hereafter. There were a variety
of piopositions before the House upon which
mey might be discussed, and adopted too, if <he
House w as disposed m their favor AH the ques-
tions involved in this measure might also be dis-
cussed at large, under some of these, and there was.
