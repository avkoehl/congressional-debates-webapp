My money accounts for the fiscal year are correctly stated below as follows:

On hand July 1, 1864:

Received from officers during the year................. $12,000

Treasury Department.................................... 300,000

-------

Total.................................................. 312,000

Expended during the year:

Transferred to other officers during the year.......... 312,000

The officers who have served under me will furnish you the information called for by paragraphs 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 11 of your order. My duties have been chiefly administrative.

As all the date for a 'statistical report" should be in your office, and as such a report of the operations of the Quartermaster's Department during the war would be of great interest and value, I would respectfully suggest that two or more competent officers be charged with the duty of compiling it. My observations during the past year have only confirmed me in the opinions expressed in previous reports relative to the outfit of our troops and our means of land transportation.

Bvt. Brigadier General R. N. Batchelder succeeded me as chief quartermaster of the Army of the Potomac, and continued on that duty until the disbandment of that army. He merited the very high commendations awarded him by all his superiors. He, like myself, has served continuously in the field during the war.

Colonel Charles E. Fuller was acting chief quartermaster of the Army of the James on our arrival at James River. Subsequently, and at different dates, Colonel J. B. Howard and Bvt. Brigadier General George S. Dodge were chief quartermasters of that army, and gave me conoidal support. I am very thankful to all the quartermasters who served under me for the uniformly cheerful co- operation extended to me. I have mentioned them more particularly in a special letter asking for brevets, &amp;c.

I beg to repeat my obligations to you and General Rucker and the officers of the Quartermaster's Department in Washington, for the support and attention given me in the transaction of my official business during the fiscal year.

With high respect, I am your most obedient servant,

RUFUS INGALLS,

Bvt. Major General of Vols., Chief Q. M. Armies before Richmond.
