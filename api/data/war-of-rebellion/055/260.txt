of the 25th, as shown by the reports of the brigade commanders, were as follows: General Willich, commanding First Brigade, reports the capture of five pieces; General Hazen, commanding Second Brigade, reports the capture of eighteen pieces, and General Beatty, commanding Third Brigade, reports the capture of eight pieces of artillery. There is, I believe, some conflict of claim between Generals Willich and Hazen as to the priority of capture of two pieces of artillery, and I think they have both included them in their reports of captures. Without pretending to decide which of the two has the better claim, which I am really not able to do (nor is it at all important the question should be decided), but making the corrections to avoid counting two pieces twice, the reports of the brigade commanders show an aggregate capture of twenty-nine pieces of artillery by the division, all field guns. In regard to the conflict between Generals Willich and Hazen,it may be remarked that it is not at all strange such differences of opinion should exist in regard to occurrences on the battle-field, as, by reason of the turmoil of the conflict, it is often impossible to mark distinctly the exact order of precedence of events, and when also two regiments may arrive simultaneously at the same place, and each honestly thinks itself the first there. General Willich, commanding First Brigade, reports the capture of two regimental colors, General Hazen, commanding Second Brigade, three, and General Beatty, two, making a total of seven.

General Willich reports the capture of twelve hundred stand of small-arms, General Hazen, six hundred and fifty, and General Beatty, two hundred, making an aggregate of two thousand and fifty stand of small-arms.

Grand summary of captures by the division: Field guns,29; field caisson,25; regimental colors,7; stand of small-arms, 2,050; prisoners, over 1,000, for whom receipts were obtained by the provost-marshal of the division from the provost-marshal-general. I have not the report of my provost-marshal before me, and hence cannot give the exact number.

Among the prisoners were officers of various grades. The casualties in the division amounted to 16 officers killed and 59 wounded;

non-commissioned officers and privates killed,144; wounded,814; making the total casualties of the division 1,033.* Among these the country has to mourn the loss of many gallant and accomplished officers and brave and devoted men.

I have already noted the death of Major Birch, of the Ninety-third Ohio, who was killed while gallantly leading his regiment in the assault on the enemy's intrenchments on Monday afternoon, the 23d. Major Erwin, Sixth Ohio, and Major Glass, Thirty-second Indiana, while displaying like heroism, were killed in the assault on Mission Ridge. In the death of these excellent and gallant officers the country has sustained a severe loss.

To my brigade commanders, General Willich, commanding First Brigade; General Hazen, commanding Second Brigade, and General Beatty (Sam.), commanding Third Brigade, my warmest thanks are due, and are hereby tendered, for the prompt, skillful, and intelligent manner in which they performed their duties in these brilliant operations. They each displayed high personal gallantry, as well as professional intelligence. I commend them to the consideration and
