CAPE GIRARDEAU, January 5, 1865-10 a. m.

Major-General DORGE:

I would not think it best to withdraw the troops from Caruthersville and send them to Bloomfield, as they are all cavalry and it would be difficult to obtain forage for them and they can do good service where they are. If your desire it I can suggest what troops might be sent to Bloomfield with benefit to the service. One company of infantry stationed there to do garrison duty would enable the cavalry now there to do all the scouting necessary at present.

J. B. ROGERS,

Colonel.
HEADQUARTERS SAINT LOUIS DISTRICT,Saint Louis, Mo., January 5, 1865.

Colonel ROGERS, Cape Girardeau:

What were the circumstances calling for troops at Caruthersville, on the Mississippi River; and do you consider it necessary that troops should remain there? The major-general commanding the department desires this information.

By order of Brigadier-General Ewing:
