HEADQUARTERS CAVALRY CORPS,General Dockry's House, March 7, 1865.

General HAMPTON:

GENERAL: I think it [will] be advisable at least to keep these roads picketed until the whole command is across the river. General Dockery desires me to say he will be plased to have you make your quarters at his house to-night. My quarters will be just opposite.

Respectfully, general, your obedient servant,

J. WHEELER,

Major-General.

9 P. M.

General WHEELER:

General Hampton directs me to say that he has already given instructions as you suggest. It is now so late that he must decline General Dockery's kind invitation.

Respectfully,

H. B. McCLELLAN,

Assistan Adjutant-General.

FAYETTEVILLE, March 7, 1865-11 a. m.

General BRAXTON BRAGG,

Goldsborough:

Sherman is reported by our cavalry marching on this place from Cheraw. Our troops have marched to the north, so there is nothing to impede his march. We shall probadly have to concentrate north of this. I think it necessary, therefore, to keep the troops at Smithfield instead of Goldsborough. The difference in time of reaching you by railroad would be trifling. Send trains when fight is impending and send back troops as soon as it is over. General Hill is instructed to join you for battle and return as soon as it is over.

J. E. JOHNSTON,

General.

GOLDSBOROUGH, March 7, 1865-11 a. m.

General J. E. JOHNSTON,

Fayetteville:

General Hoke, at Konston, thinks Schofield in his front. A deserter from the enmey yesterday also makes this report. I go down immediately, having arranged to bring on troops rapidly. No delay will occur in making an issue.

BRAXTON BRAGG.

FAYETTEVILLE, March 7, 1865-1,30 p. m.

General B. BRAGG,

Goldsborough:

Consider in your operations in front of Goldsborough that Cheatham's corps, and more than half of Stewart's, are on the way from Chesterville to Smithfield by railroad, and will have the same orders as Hill's troops.

J. E. JOHNSTON,

General.
