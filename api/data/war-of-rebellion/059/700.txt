a Of the horses required 35 have been condemned as unserviceable.

b The guns required are such as I would prefer if as liberty to fill out the command to my choice.

c But six Napoleons would make the armament very good. There would then be two Napoleon and one rifle battery, the rifle battery consisting of two Parrotts and two Confederate States 3-inch rifles.

The horses are carried to water twice a day in column of twos at a walk, under command of a sergeant. In the morning pass the officer of the day, who inspects each animal closely and reports condition.
