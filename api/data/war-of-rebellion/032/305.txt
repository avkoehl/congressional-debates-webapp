I was not permitted to visit the battle-field; but, from the best information I could obtain, there were only 3 killed on the field. I could not learn their names or command. They were buried by our friends.

Of the five nurses that remained, two only were permitted to stay with our wounded, and the others were sent to Saint Louis as prisoners of war.

When I left Cape Girardeau our wounded were well cared for, and had everything requisite to make them comfortable.

Respectfully, your, &amp;c.,
