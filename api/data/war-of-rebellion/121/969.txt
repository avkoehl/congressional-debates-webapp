There are now forty-four clerks employed in this Bureau, the number having been reduced since October 20, 1865, from seventy-five, there having been employed an average number of fifty-five throughout the year.

The examination of these cases frequently involves great labor, owing to the vague information furnished in many of the letters of inquiry as to when and where the parties inquired for were last heard from, or other information that would facilitate the examination of the records. In most cases this office is expected to furnish the complete record of each soldier from the time of his capture until his exchange and return to duty with his company, or until he is otherwise disposed of; and as the rolls and records pertaining to Federal soldiers, prisoners of war, comprise over a million of names (owing to the fact that the same name frequently appears on five or six different reports from the time of parole until they are finally disposed of), it will readily be seen that the work of examination must necessarily consume a considerable amount of labor and time.

Paymaster-General.................................... 4.131

Second Auditor....................................... 1.162

Commisioner of Pensions.............................. 138
