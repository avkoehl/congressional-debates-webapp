COMMANDING OFFICER,

Loudon Gap:

SIR: There will be a force of our cavalry at McConnellsburg this afternoon. Make arrangements with the commanding officer there to keep you informed should the enemy enter the valley of McConnellsburg. We also have cavalry at Mercersburg. It will be well during the present excitement to have a lieutenant with fifteen men at the lower fort in the direction of Loudon, to be ready to stop up road upon positive information that the rebels are approaching the mountain. You will keep your men well in hand and allow no more straggling and thieving from the poor people down the mountain.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

D. N. COUCH,

Major-General, Commanding Department.

Captain WILLIAM BURGESS, Loudon:

CAPTAIN: The commanding general directs me to inform you that the enemy are in large force on the south bank of the Potomac, their line extending from Shepherdstown to Clear Spring, and requests that you get your company together and be in readiness to assist Captain Walker in Path Valley, or the troops on the road leading from Loudon to McConnellsburg, to resist their advance should they cross and move mountain roads, may be the means to keeping a considerable force of the enemy back and cause them much annoyance.

I am, major, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JNO. S. SCHULTZE,

Major and Assistant Adjutant-General.
