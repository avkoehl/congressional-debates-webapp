Twenty-third Kentucky, who proposed to come through Allatoona Pass and then park it on this side for the night, but orders were sent to him at 12.15 p. m. to come here without delay. At same time instructions were sent to Lieutenant-Colonel Remick to move the rest of train, as soon as loaded, by the road upon which the troops march. 1 p. m., received orders from headquarters Army of the Cumberland stating that said army would march to-morrow on the main road to Marietta:

The Fourteenth Army Corps will leave, starting at 5 a. m.; the Fourth Corps will follow the Fourteenth, and the Twentieth will follow the Fourth. Only sufficient transportation will be taken to carry ten days' forage and provisions. Colonel McCook, commanding First Cavalry Division, will keep a small portion of his force in front and on the right flank. The remainder will move in rear of the infantry. Should no opposition be met with during the march to Kenesaw Station, the head of the column will halt there until the arrival of the head of the column of the Army of the Tennessee, unless it should have already arrived.

Copies of this order were sent to division commanders. 5 p. m., the following order for march for the corps for June 10 was issued:

This corps will march on the main road to Marietta, which crossed the railroad at Kenesaw Station and passes on to Marietta, east of the Kenesaw Mountain, moving as follows: First, Major-General Stanley's division, then General Newton's, then General Wood's. General Stanley's division and Newton's division will march at 7 a. m., and General Wood's at 8 a. m. The ambulance trains will move in the rear of the respective divisions to which they are attached, and the ammunition train, having been massed, will follow immediately after the corps. The corps train will be drawn out on the same road upon which the troops march, and following them it will move at 10 a. m.

That part of the supply train which Colonel Foy was guarding arrived near this point late to-night; portion of it at Allatoona. 10 p. m., instructions were given to Colonel Hayes, chief quartermaster, to follow the corps with his train to Adams' house, about two miles from here, and park it there; but if we meet with no opposition from the enemy to continue following the troops. Nothing of importance occurred to-day. The cavalry, which was reconnoitering to-day, reports the enemy in strength, with strong earth-works, just in front of our vedettes. Day clear and warm.

As Palmer's corps had not yet reached the Burnt Hickory and Marietta road, and as he was to precede us, we halted to wait for him; head of his column said to be over half a mile from said road. At this point we threw out skirmishers to our front and on our right flank; enemy said to be moving around our right flank; a regiment of cavalry just in our front skirmishing with the enemy, but a very short distance off; enemy's works on Cedar Top Knob plainly seen, about a mile off. 11 a. m., advanced section of artillery to our skirmish line and opened fire upon the enemy. 11.30, sent an officer to General Palmer, who returned and reported that General P[almer] was waiting for more of his troops to come up before he
