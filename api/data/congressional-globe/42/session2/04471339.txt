THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

to call the attention of the committee to the
gross inequalities between the salaries of these
subordinate officers. That was my object in
making these remarks, and although not pre-
pared myself to propose an increase of the
amount which has been named, I am not pre-
pared to antagonize the amendment of the
gentleman from Massachusetts, [Mr. Hooper.]
I withdraw my amendment.
Mr. BUTLER, of Massachusetts. I renew
it for the purpose of calling the attention of
the committee to one or two facts only. Iam
sorry that we have not yet reached the bill for
equalizing the salaries of various officers under
the Government. But here is an opportunity
to do justice in a degree to a very deserving
officer, and in case of his death or resignation
to be able to remunerate another man so as to
get, if possible, an equally good one.
The Second Comptroller's office has been
sometimes misunderstood as if it were a sort
of office subservient to that of the First Comp-
troller. That is not at all so. The Second
Comptroller has assigned to him the War
accounts, the Navy accounts, the Indian ac-
counts, and the pension accounts, and he
passes annually three or four times more ac-
counts than does the First Comptroller. And
there are many officers, on whose accounts he
passes, who have a salary yearly twice as large
as his, in the War Department doing bureau
service. He has all those outside accounts
which require great judgement, great knowl-
edge of the law, and more than all, great in-
tegrity, passed through his hands. And if he
were not too old to change he could go into a
banking-house or into private employment
and get three times as much as he does now,
$3,000. And I have no doubt the House will
acquiesce in the propriety of giving him an
equal salary with that of the Register and the
First Comptroller, and the Comptroller of the
Currency.
Mr. NIBLACK. The greatest objection I
have to voting to increase the pay of the
Second Comptroller to $5,000 a year is the pre-
cedent it will afford in relation to other offi-
cers. No gentleman here, I think, appreciates
the character and services of the Second Comp-
troller of the Treasury more than I do, and I
think he ought to have more pay than he now
has; but the difficulty is that if you give him
$5,000 a year it. will be a precedent for a simi-
lar increase in the pay of a great many other
bureau officers in the Treasury Department,
and we should not be willing to pay them sal-
aries at that rate. Speaking, therel'ore, as his
friend, which I have no right to do, but which
right 1 will assume, I will say that as we gave
the Register of the Treasury some perquisites
which make his pay up to $4,500 a year, it
would be only fair and decent to make the
pay of the Second Comptroller of the Treasury
of the same amount.
I do not antagonize this proposition espe-
cially, but I wish to say in the interest of the
public service that, as a member of the com-
mittee, 1 have had occasion to give attention
to this matter of salaries for years past, and
that if we give this gentleman a salary of
$5,000 a year, every other bureau officer in
the Department will expect to receive that
amount, and I for one am not prepared to go
into the general system of a general increase
of salaries in which it would result. I repeat,
however, that I would favor the making of his
salary $4,500, but I am not prepared to go
beyond that, and I ask a vote on my amend-
ment to make the salary $4,500.
The question was put on the amendment,
and it was disagreed to.
The question was then taken upon the
amendment offered by Mr. Hooper, of Massa-
chusetts;' and there were—ayes 49, noes 33;
no quorum voting.
Air. GARFIELD, of Ohio. I hope gentle-
men will let this question go to the House with
the amendment adopted, so that we can have
a vote upon it there.
Mr. NIBLACK. I have no objection to
that.
The CHAIRMAN. Then the amendment
is regarded as agreed to.
The Clerk read as follows:
For payment of any balance due, or to be found
due, during the present fiscal year, to any State, for
costs, charges, and expenses contemplated and pro-
vided for in and by the act approved July 27,1861,
being an act to indemnify certain States for expenses
incurred by them in enrolling, equipping, and trans-
porting troops for the defense of the United States
during the late rebellion, SI,000,000.
Mr. FARNSWORTH. That is a verv largo
appropriation to be lumped together without
any definite object being stated. I do not find
anything in the estimates on the subject.
Mr. GARFIELD, of Ohio. It is in the
estimates; there is a table here, not in the
general book of estimates, but in an estimate
that came in later. I will make it a part of
my remarks. It shows in tabulated form the
amounts found due to the different States.
The table referred to is as follows:
