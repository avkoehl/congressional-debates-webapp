NEW YORK, July 15, 1863. (Received 6. 20 p. m.)

SIR: The following message just received from the manager of our Boston office. It came from New Rochelle by horse-power, our lines up to that point being destroyed. There was a considerable riot last night at Staten Island, and there are indications of outbreaks at Brooklyn and Williamsburg:

BOSTON, July 15, 1863-6. 20 p. m.

Colonel E. S. SANFORD:

SIR: Considerable excitement and gathering of people at North End yesterday: some fighting. Two police injured. Two companies regulars ordered up from Fort Independence; also two companies artillery from Readville. About 8 p. m. crowd made an attack on armory in Cooper street. All window glass demolished by brickbats. Troops fired a round of blank cartridges, and made a bayonet charge on mob, which retreated toward Charlestown street. Troops returned to armory, crowd following. A disturbance more intense. Large breach made in door of armory, which was then thrown open, and 6-pounder brass field pieces, loaded with canister shot, discharged full in the crowd. One man killed and several wounded. The crowd still refusing to leave, infantry marched out by platoons, and fired. One man and one woman killed by this discharge, and several wounded. Cooper street was then cleared. Later in evening a battalion of dragoons formed line in Cooper street. Part of the crowd assembled at Dock Square, and a hardware store was broken into. Police fired fifteen or twenty shots. at 8. 40 p. m. alarm bells were rung, and another squad of police sent to Dock Square, which succeeded in keeping it clear until arrival of dragoons and company of infantry. At 10 p. m. dragoons returned to Cooper street, the disturbance in Dock Square being quelled. At 12. 30 armory discovered to be on fire, but was saved from destruction by military. The Forty-fourth Massachusetts Regiment notified to assemble at their armory at 6 this morning.

G. F. MILLIKEN.

Respectfully,

E. S. SANFORD. Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

NEW YORK, July 15, 1863. (Received 9. 15 p. m.)

SIR: The situation of affairs here is quite as critical this morning as at any former time. As far as I can learn, there has not yet been much serious fighting, but the rioters are gathered in large crowds at various points, and for the first time making their appearance down town in the back streets. Whatever assistance is to come here, should have precedence over all other railroad arrangements.

E. S. SANFORD.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.
