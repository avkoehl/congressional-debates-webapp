BROADWAY LANDING, VA., January 24, 1865-8 p. m.

Brigadier General R. INGALLS,

Chief Quartermaster, Armies in the Field, City Point:

I had to leave my twelve wagons and teams at Fort Fisher by order of General Terry. I brought back the wagon-master and teamsters, who are especially valuable to me from knowing the best roads to my batteries. I need the twelve teams very much, at once, to get the heavy guns in position on James River. If possible have the teams and wagons replaced, leaving me the same men.
