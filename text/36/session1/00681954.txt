be paid and a surplus accumulated to pay the
public debt as it falls due?
For the next fiscal year, the Secretary (page
6 of his report) estimates the expenditures at
$66,714,928 79; while he estimates the receipts
from customs, $60,000,000; from public lands,
$4,000,000; miscellaneous sources, S3,225,000;
making an aggregate of §66,225,000. The receipt
from public lands last year was but §1,756,687 30;
and what reason is there to suppose that it will be
greater next year? and the receipts from miscel-
laneous sources, not including loans or Treasury
notes, has not exceeded $1,300,000 per annum for
ten years. To raise $60,000,000 of revenue under
the present tariff, there must be au importation of
about $448,000,000, when the largest importation
in any one year during the existence of the Gov-
ernment was $360,890,141, and that was in 1857,
during the height of the inflation. The average
for six years is $310,490,377 33, as will be seen
by the following table, copied from Executive
Document, first session, Thirty-Sixth Congress,

Is there any one, except the Secretary, who sup-
poses for a single moment that the importation of
foreign merchandise next year is to exceed that of
1857 by almost $100,000,000? If it were possible
to be done—and it must be, if you raise $60,000,000
from customs—it would bankrupt the country to
pay for them. Last year, with an importation of
$338,768,130, it took $63,^87,411 in specie to pay
the balance of trade against us; and if that bal-
ance against us is to be increased by $100,000,000
of importation over any preceding year, how long
could the country be saved from bankruptcy by
such a drain upon the basis of irs circulating me-
dium ? You might as well expect a private citizen
to prosper in business when his expenses greatly
exceeded his income.
For the last five yeais,we exported $241,676,806
of specie more than we imported; and Irom 1846
to 1859, inclusive, being fourteen years, the ex-
cess of specic exported was £,349,657,122; so more
than two thirds of the entire expmtaUon for four-
teen years has been exported in the last five years,
as will be seen by the following tabIefcopied from

By this enormous exportation of specie within
so few years to pay our indebtedness abroad was
produced the crash of 1857. The country, though
unable to pay its debts, was not then bankrupt.
It had abundance of property; and if it c<«uid have
paid in exchanges vC commodities there would
have been no crisis. But the country having been
so largely drained, in so short a time, of it# spe-
cie, compelled a curtailment of circulation by the
banks, so it was difficult, and in most cases im-
possible, to obtain a circulating medium with
which to pay indebtedness. The crisis of 1857 was
produced mostly by our large indebtedness abroad
and the expoitations of specie to pay it.
Mr. MILLSON. I desire to ask the gentleman
whether he is not perfectly aware that after these
exports of specie, which was produced in the
country, taken from the mines, there was still left
in the country a much larger amount of specie
than there was at the time the exportation com-
menced ?
Mr. GROW. Then the inference from the gen-
tleman's suggestion would be, that the country
which has the least representative of value in a
circulating medium is the more prosperous. I
hold no such theory of political economy. I hold
that that country is the most prosperous that has
the greatest amount of the representative of value
within itself. •
Mr. MILLSON. The gentleman has not com-
prehended my question.
Mr. GROW, t understood the gentleman to
say that there was more specie left in the country
at the end of the crash than there was at the be-
ginning of these large exportations. 1 understood
thegentleman to make thatstatement as an answer
to my proposition that the crisis was biought on
the country by the large drainage of the basis
of the circulating medium; for we sent nearly
$250,000,000 of specie out of the country to pay
the balance of trade against us.
Mr. MILLSON. What I desire to call thegen-
tleman's attention to was this, that although wc
sent $40,000,000 of specie out of the country annu-
ally, we got from the mines perhaps $50,000,000
a year, leaving a surplus of at least ^10,000,000
above the exportation.
Mr. GROW. The inference that I was draw-
ing from the gentleman's statements was, that m
his view any country is moie prosperous that
exchanges its metals for the products of other
countues.
Mr. TAYLOR. Will the gentleman allow me
to make an inquiry of him ?
Mr. GROW. Certainly.
Mr. TAYLOR. Is it the gentleman's view
that it is desirable that all the gold obtained from
the mines of the United States should remain
constantly in the United States, to be accumulated
here ?
Air. GROW. It is my view, Mr. Chairman,
that if wo produce the commodities which we
send specie abroad to pay for, we should he a
more prosperous and wealthier nation than wc arc
in sending specie to other nations to buy them.
Mr. TAYLOR. The gentleman misunder-
stands my question. 1 desire to know whether
he considers that it is desirable that gold, which
is one of the staple productions of the United
States; which is as much an article to be pro-
duced by our labor as cotton, or corn, or the vari-
ous products which we export abroad—a produc-
tion which is in its very nature exportable should
be retained at home? If that is his view, does
he not know that the inevitable result would be
to lead to an appreciation of prices which would,
m a short time, exclude the United States as an
exporting country from all the markets of the
world, because prices would be increased beyond
the standaid in the markets of the world?.
Mr. GROW. That would be true, if we do not
produce the commodities for which the specic is
exchanged. But if we do, then there can be no
enhaneementof prices by rrt.uningthe specic paid
for their purchase; and the advantage of making
the exchange at home instead of abroad is, that
while you retain, for the purposes of trade, a re-
liable circulating medium, you save to the pro-
ducer of each commodity the cost of double trans-
portation. • For instance, you manufacture a shoe
which costs one dollar. It costs another dollar
for its transportation abroad. You exchange it
there forsomo commodity costing two dollais, the
transportation of which costs one dollar. So the
article you get in exchange for the shoe costs five
dollars, requinng five shoes to pay for it, when,
if it had been produced at the door of the shoe
manufacturer at no greater cost than at the place
of its production, two shoes would have paid for
it, and the cost of transportation and the labor
of thiee shoes would have been saved to the con-
sumer. Thus, the consumer of each would be
benefited to the amount of three fifths of the cost
of the article.
Whatever productions, therefore, a nation has
natural advantages or facilities for producing, it
is of national interest and concern that it should
supply its own market, on the principle that you
buy cheapest where you pay easiest. When-
ever the products of a nation's industry arc re-
tained within its own limits, the people thereof
are more prosperous than they could be if they
expended their means in paying for the transpor-
tation of their own products abroad and the trans-
portation on foreignproductsinexchange, instead
of saving that expense by producing at home.
Therefore, it is better, in my judgment, for a
country to produce within itself, as far as climate
and soil will permit, the commodities for which
gold and silver are exchanged, instead of sending
them to other countries in payment for such com-
modities.
But to return from the digression into which I
have been led hy these questions. How is the
Government,from its existing sources of revenue,
to raise the amount necessary to defray its current
expenses, and pay the public debt, now amount-
ing to $64,000,000, as it becomes due? As I have
already shown from the figures of the Secretary
of the Treasury, there will be, even if his esti-
mates should prove to be correct, a deficiency
in the Treasury, on the 1st of July next, of
$1,023,141 14, without taking into consideration
the indefinite appropriations of this session far
payment of private claims, for damages to mail
contractors, for expenses of a Texas regiment, or
any other of the many contingencies that always
arise, requiring a greater expenditure than is esti-
mated for.
The current expenses of the next year, by the
estimates and the statement just made by the
chairman of the Committee of Ways and Means,
will be about sixty-four million dollars. And
should the expenses be reduced to that amount,
then the most wasteful extravagance must have
existed in the expenditures for the last six years.
The expenses of the Government (I read from
Executive Document, first session Thirty-Sixth
Congress, No. 3, page 324) were, for the fiscal
year—
1851 $75,473,119 08
1£55 .  60.104,775 96
1850  7-i.7-2B.n41 57

1S.)8  8_>;06->,!8U 74
1859  S3,67t;,6-1:1 9-2
But, admitting that the current expenses of the
next year will not exceed §64,000,000, then it
would require a revenue of §65,000,000 to pay the
current expenses and the deficiency at the. end of
this year, without making any provision for the
public debt. How is it to be raised ? Certainly
not under the present tariff. So there is an imper-
ative necessity for a change. The important ques-
tion that aiises is, what way shall it be doner
The change must be so made, if possible, as to
raise the accessary revenue to defray the current
expenses of the Government and provide for the
public debt. The tariff of 1857 was passed to
dimmish revenues. A surplus had accumulated in
the Treasury, and was constantly accumulating
during the years 1834,1855, and 1856. When this
Administration came into power they found a sur-
plus of $21,000,000. That has all been expended,
and $40,000,000 added to the public debt m two
years,and thecurrentexpensesofthe Government
exceed greatly its income. It is now necessary
to increase the revenue in order to preserve the
faith of the Government. There is no way to do
that but by a change of the tariff, that being the
tax law of the General Government. It is the
only means it has of raising revenue, with the
exception of the proceeds from the sales of pub-
lic lands, amounting, on an average, to some
$2,000,000 per year, and about $1,000,000 from
miscellaneous sources.
Without entering upon any discussion of the
details of this bill, I think it, in its general arrange-
ment, an improvement on the tariff of 1657, and
that it will raise more re\enue on the same amount
of importation, without increasing taxation on the
consumer, while it will afford a stimulus to our
languishing industry, and save the labor of our
country, in times of depression, from ruinous com-
petition with the labor of the Old "World. By the
specific dutiesin this bill, a greater amount of rev-
enue will be collected on the same importation
without affecting the market value of the qpticlc;
for by a false invoice, under an ad valorem duty,
