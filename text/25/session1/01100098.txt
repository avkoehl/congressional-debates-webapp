months, according to the doc* me contended for,
that no such vacancy existed as fMjthonzed the ex-
ercise of Executive authority to filí if according to
the provisions of the Constitution Asá Rere gen-
tlemen had mistaken the true point, by presuming
that all which ought to have been done, eüher by
the Legislatures of the respective States or the
Congress, had been done in this matter. But how
stands the case? If the representative office is pei-
petual, and if that perpetuity implies, as it most
unquestionably does imply, p rpeUial succession, it
follows, a  a consequence, that neither the one nor
the- other has come up to the intention of the Con-
stitution, so fai as the States which have post-
poned their Congressional election beyond the com-
meneemeit of the term are concerned If,
then, by the negligence of those States, and •
of Congress, the perpetuity of succession has beers
bioken, h w can that deprive the Governor of his
constitutional right, or excuse him from his high
constitutional obligation, to <ee that the vacancy
¡shall be filled'' There is certainly no conflict be-
tween the nghts of the States or of Congress on
the one hand, and the Governor on the other
under th.s view of the subject It was made the
duty of the States, and in default oí it, oí Con-
gress, to keep up a constant saccessionin the repre-
sentative body And in the failure of either to do
so, the rig it and the duty of the Gov ernor of a
State requires of him to supply the omission
Nor is this view derogatory to the lights of the
people, but in support and afhrmance of them In
the case alieady supposed, of a convention of Con-
gress at the commencement of th- constitutional
term, according to the doctrine advanced by those
■who oppose the regularity of the Mississippi elec-
tion, nearly two-thirds of the States would have
been unrepresented for months, and their consti-
tuents unheard in this body. But, upon the doc-
trine advanced by him, Mr H said the omission
uf the State legislatures and of Congress would be
supplied, and every State íepresented in this House
as it should be, without the least possible delaj
But he would go one step faither-nilh his argu-
ment, and sav, that as the repiesentative office is
perpetual and as that implies perpetual succession,
if the Stale legislature and Corgress shall so leave
it, that on the 4th of March, coriespondmsr vv ith
the biennial eummencement of the repiesentative
term in this House, any State shall b unrepie-
sented a vacancv has happened on v hich arises
the yo ie) and the obligation of the Governor to
oausMt to be tilled
He said he was aware that this might be consi-
dered a novel doctrine, but it was the legitimate
rotisequence of his original proposition the pciyt-
lutly oj the tepresenltttne office, and he had alieady
shonii that the people were deeply interested in the
establishment ol the doctrine If his premises and
conclusion «ere legitimate, the honorable gentle-
men claiming a right to seaU in this House as
representatives from the State of Mississ'ppi, aie as
much crtt tied to them as any membets belonging
to it
Mi. SLADE contended neither the resolution
nor the amendment took the true gionnd He did
not believe ihat the members elected were entitled
to ho'd their seats during the entire continuance uf
the 25th Congress, and he did believe they were
entitled to seats at the extra session, and if any gen-
tleman would bring forward a proposition to this
effect, he would vote for it. He was not m favor
of the amendment, but if he was compelled lo de-
< ide between it and the original resolution, he
would be compelled to vote for it. Prom the most
caieril examination which he could give the suL-
jecl, he had come to the conclusion that such a
\ icanev h id h ippened as w s contemplated by the
Constitution He contended that the Gov ernor hail
t-iepowei U fill up this vacancy, byissuing his win
of election to nil the vacancy until the time of the
regular e'eetion under the Const tution oí the
feiate, and went into a lengthy argument in support
of this view of the case
Mi. TILL1NGHAST thought it perfectly mam
fest that the people of Mississippi intended to have
representatives in Congress at the present extra
sesión, and he was glad ihat by the rules of the
House th* gentlemen were permitted to rake seats

representatives, and that it would be entirely im-
pioper to have one set ot men at the commei ce-
ment of a Congress, when the President piesented
the state of the country to the v lew of ihe House,
and another set two months afteiwards, who knew
nothing of these subjects Gentlemen had con-
tended that no vacancv had occurred in the íepre-
sentation from the Stale of Mississippi, and that if
the two representatives waie removed to-morrow,
by a vote of the House, there would be no vacancy
If the representatives from that State were removed
from the Hoise by a vote of the House to-day, he
would^"k any gentleman whether there would not
be a vacancy m then seats' He would po nt to those
vacant seats and ask gentlemen if no vacancy had
occurred m the lepiesentation from the State of
Mississippi On' but say gentlemen, this is not
such a v ac?ncy as is contemplated by the Consti-
tution Th she took lo Le a veij torced construc-
t on of the worJ vacancy Mr M then tefeired
to Elliot's debate on the adopt'on of th° Constitu-
tion, to show that it was the intent on of the tra-
iners of the Const tution to make the clause m re-
lation to ihe vacancy apply to ah cases of vacan-
cy, no matter m what manner it might occui, and
he also íeftrred to the opinion of Judge Story on a
case of vacancy m the office of a foreign minister,
iM which there had been a diPeience of opinion be-
tween the Senate, or a portion of the Senate, and
President Madison, and it was stated in the work
of Judge Story that the Senate had entered a pro-
test igamst a certain appointment made by Presi-
dent Madison
Mr ADAMS lose, and stated that it was a mis-
take 11 Jud"-e ¡story, in sav mg that a protest had
been entered by Ihe Senate, in relation to the ap-
pointment illud-nl to A Senator fi om Massachu-
setts bed biought forwaid a proposition, declaring
the appointment alluded to illegal and unconstitu-
tional, prd the subject was debated to the close of
that session, withoutcomin¿ to any conclusion, and
was again resumed at the commencement of the
next «ession, and after as pit ent deliberation as
the Senate ever gave to any subject, u w as indefi-
nitely postponed by a v ote of the majority of the
Senate, so that theie never was any piotest by
the Senate against the appointment And now, if
he might be permitted to say one word, he would
giv e hisunder_tanding of this w ord "happen" in cases
of vacancie* He be'icvcd, in relation to ufhees,
that every one happens iO be vacant wh ch is not
full, and that he believed vv as the sense and meaning
of the Constitution, whethei the vaeancy occurred
fiom casualty, the regular course of evenls, expi-
lation of term, or othei cause In relation to the
offices of public ministers, they were not offices
created by the law  or the Constitution, but were
offices known to the law <s of nations, and created
by the laws of nations Ministers were cent to
eveiy part of the world by the Piesident, and
whenever there is a necessity for the appointment
of such minister, that office Is v?cant This was
what he understood by the term vacant, and he
believed this was the und-rstandmg of every Presi-
dent of the United States
Mr. HOWARD was glad the gentleman from
Massachusetts had had an opportunity of explain-
ing, as he considered his opin on as having "ery
gieat weight in this matter It had demolished the
structure raised by the gentleman from ©hio [Mr
Mason] entirely
Mr MASON explained, and contended that the
remarks of the gentleman from Massachusetts had
not effected the argument he had used, or the
authority he had referred to
Mr HOWARD resumed, and contended that it
was not in the power of the Legislatuie of a State
to prevent tne people irom having a repiesentation
in Congiess If the Legislature neglected to pro-
vide for h?vmg the people represented on all occa-
sions in the House of Representatives, then it was
the duty of the Governor of a St_te to provide
that the vacancy should be filled, as it was the
right oí the people aiways to be represented
Accorlmg to bis undeistandi g of what the inten-
tion of the framers of the Constitution was in rela-
tion to this inattfi, he believed it was intended that,
if the Legislatuie failed to make provision for fill-
ing all vacancies which might exist, then it was th 
at the present session of Congress because he was
always willing to take into account the will of
the constitnencv It was assumed, however, that
the people believed at the time of the election, that
thev vvere electing representatives for the twenty-
fifth Congress, but this he took to be an improper
assumption, because the people were only autho-
rized by the Governor to vote for members to the
extrasessionof Congress.aiid therefore it was but fair
to presume* that the people were not genei ally of opi-
nion that they were electing members for the whole of
the Twenty-fifth Congress They were led to believe
by the p.oclamation of the Governor, that the teim
of those they were votiog for would expne at the
time when the existing law of the State provided
that tne election for members of Congress shouldlake
place He contended that it was not in the power of
the Governor to authorize an election for the whole
of the 25th Congress, bee ause, if the Governor n as
clolhed with this power, he could set aside the
laws of the Stale entirely. He contended 'hat the
real difficulty in relation to the Mississippi election
was defective legislation, because the Legislature
had not prov ded for the exigency which might
arise m case of a call of an extra session of Con-
gress immediately after the fourth of March It
appeared to him that the proper course would
have been for the Governor to call the Legislature
to provide the means of filling up the vacancy
which had_pccurred, and cited the late election m
Rhode Isl?ndas an lllustiation of his idea There
the Legislature provided for the case ot an earlier
election of Representatives to Congress, and no one
dreamed that this difficulty would be remedied by
the Governor issuing his writ of election to supply
the vacancy.
Mr. HOWARD had supposed it was conceded
on all hands that we must come to one or two de-
cisions on th s question, and that there was no such
middle giound as that assumed by the gentleman
I from Vermont, (Mr Slade,) and that was, ihat we
must either adopt the report of the co_ mittee, or
the amendment submitted by a member of the mi-
nority He had thought that gentlemen on all
hands had conceded that these two gentlemen vvere
e uher members of the Twenty-fifth Congress, or
i'rat thej vvere not members at a 1 But the gen-
tleman from Vermont had taken a middle giourd,
a' d sav s he believes these two gentlemen elected
to fill the vacancy during the extia session ol Con-
gress , v et he brings forvv ard no pi opo_i'ion, and
declares, notwithstanding, that he be'ieved these
"entlemen members of the extra session, that he
will vote for the amendment pending, thereby ex-
pelling those gentlemen from the House during the
present session, because, if the vote was taken
to day and the amendment earned, they would not
be enti'led to seats to-morrow
Although the gentleman admitted that the people
of Mississippi were entitled to have representatives
at the present extra session, vet he is prepared to
deprive them of their representatives to-mmrow
They had been told bv the gentleman from Missis-
sippi on yesterday, that the people of that State
elected them undei the impression that they were
electing members for the whole of the Tvventv-fifth
Congress, and that scarcely a man m Mississippi
thought that the election was merely for the extra
session, and he took it that there was the stiongest
evidence of this being the case, exhibited by the
fact tha there was now but one person in Missis-
sippi who had brought himself to the notice of the
people of Mississippi for election in Novenabei. If
the people of the State believed that these gentle-
men vvere not elected for the whole of the Twenty-
fifih Congress, he imagined they would be making
eveiy preparation foi the election m November
next Congress, he contended, was an entire body,
arid could not be made up ot one set of men for
two moiths, and anolhei set of men for the re-
mpmder of the term. The membeis all came in at
one time, and al' went out at one time They
m ght be compared to the changes of a stage coach,
whioh, having run its stige, h 'd an entire change
of horses, but recording to the construction of the
gentleman fiom Veimont, he would be stopping at
every mi'e to introduce a new horse He contended
that the people were entitled to the benefit of the
whole of the time of a representative, or of a set of
