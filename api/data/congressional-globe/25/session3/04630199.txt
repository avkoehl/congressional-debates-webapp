the Crown lands, for defraying the expenses of the war and
for such other public and general purposes The jurisdic
Iwn ought, m every instance, to belong to the respective
States within the charter oi determined limits oj %i.hich such
lands may be seated, but reason and justice must decide
that the property winch existed in the Cro v i of Great Dnt
am, previous to the present Revolution, oujiht now to be
lon^ to the Congrc s, in liust for the use and bencjit of the
United States they have founht and bled for it m propor
tion *o their respective abilities, and therefore,the íevvard
ought not to he pred leetionally distributed "
Tliese objections were made and rejected in
1778 Here, sir, we find the text of all the speeches
and reports which have been made from that day
to this on the subject of the public lands The
objections of these States are the very pith and
narrow of all that has been said and uiged in
favoi of the old States to what aie called the pub
He lands Mark the language that is used They
aie willing that juiisdiction.entne and complete,
shall belong to the States in whose limits the lands
may lie, but they require that the propel ty in the
soil shall be the common property of all the States
If this nnth article did not forbid that any other
powei should hold a property in the soil of a State,
why object to it} If it be said that it was meant
to apply to those States that had large claims to
vacant territory, what is there in this or any other
part of the Confederation that forbids the same
application to a new State, had one been admitted
duung the existence of the Confederation' It
applied equally to all, there was no exception,
and these States knew the fact, and therefoie it
is that we find them urging in such earnest and
pathetic strains the claims which they considered
they had to this vacant terutoiy, and which, by
this aiticle, was unjustly withheld fiom them
Mi ROBERTSON said, a« he did not desne
to leply to the gentleman fiom Missoui i, ho hoped
he should be allowed toconect the extraoidinaiy
misappiehension into which the gentleman had
fallen in iegaid to the effect of the proviso in the
ninth article of the Confederation and the deeds
of cession
Mi   HARRISON assenting,
Mi    HOBCItTSON  pioceeded     I  purposely
ivoided, sn, all commentary upon the differences
subsisting among  the States in the eaily peuod
of our i evolutionary struggle, on  the subject of
Hie western lands, becaust I considered thosedif
ferences finally adjusted by the compacts of ces-
non and the Tcderal Constitution    It was imma
(erial whether the lands belonged to tins Govern
mentor to the States which claimed them, since,
in euhoi case, the teims of the compicts and the
provisions of the Constitution  must be earned
into t ffect      But if the gentleman will g > beyond i
'hese   instiurocnis,   he   will  find   that  Vuguna
i launel all the lands within the limits, of hei an-
ient chai tors long  before the Oonfedi i icy vías
lormed    and actually pioclaimed   these  as  hei
nghtful   bound mes  in   her   State  constitution,
adopted pnor to the declaiution ol American in-
dependence     Daily in 1778, hei Legislatuie nu
ihonzed the laismg ot a regiment foi the defense
of her westein fiontier     Colonel Claik was ap
pointed to command it, and leductd the foits of
liaskias and St  Vincenne , both of them, 11 the
time, in the possession of the British, adding the ,
right by conquest to that by grant     The Articles
of Confederation were signed in July, 1778     In
residing the pretensions of the othci States, Vn-
g ma utmed that the United States held any tei   I
ntoiy, but in light of some one Sttte, and lelied |
on the protiso in the ninth atticle, referred to by
the gentleman fiom  Missouu, as reserving hei
sovereignty and junsdiction within her hmitb
Without that proviso, she would not have acceded
to the Confederacy     And it n> strange that the
gentleman from Missouri should rely on that oi
any other aiticle of the Confederation to defeat
the rights it was intended to secure, more espe-
cially when, as he himself tells us, that article
was objected to by some of the States, and then
objections ovenuled  with  but one   dissenting
voice
llieie is nothing in the Articles of Confedera-
tion to sustain the aigument that all the lands
within the limits of the States belong to the State
in which they be The expression is, that no
State stall be depmed of territory for the benefit of
ih° United States But that is a very diffeient
piopos tion The temtory within the new States
was ceded to the United States before those new
States were cieated It belonged then to the
United S'ates, and their disposition of it conse
quently does not depnve any State of territory
since no State can be deprived of what does not
belong to it These deeds of cession were equally
as obligatoiy as the Articles of Confederation
We must comply with the conditions of the giant
or restore the pioperty But, sn, the Aiticles of
Confederation were abiogated by the Federal
Constitution, which, as I have shown, ratified
the compacts of cession The ordinances made
under those compacts, the very terms on which
the new States have been admitted into the Union,
and then own State constitutions, all declare that
they shall never interfere with the primal y dispo-
sition of the soil by the United States Can any
obligation then, sn, be more binding'
Noi is there anything in the objections of New
Jeisey and Rhode Island, refeired to by the gen-
tleman fiom Missouu, to support his idea that
the redera! Government cannot hold lands within j
a State     If anything, they pi ove exactly the I
íeveise     Those States proposed that a cession
should be made of the soil to  the Confederacy,
the States making it to retain  the junscíicíion
This ofTei was evidently intended as a concession
to  induce  a  sunender     It  was  not  accepted
But the offer itself proceeds upon a ground at I
war with the pnnciph asserted by the gentleman
fiom Missouu   for it neces^auly supposes that ,
the light of soil might be in the United States as |
lo lands within the limits of a State, while the i
State íetaini d the light of jui isdiction
Mr  HARRISON     Thegentleman'sexplana   ¡
tion, I think, does not avail linn      It was befóte |
Confess that the oljootions of Rhode Island and i
New Jeisey weie made, who alone had the light |
to detci mine upon the matter    They i ejected the
objeclions   ard strongoi negative tt stimony can
not be biought, in my opinion, to show the clear '
intention of Congrios that no such power was 1
granted by the Confedci uion as that claimed by i
the gentleman      But, s> i, I cannot now digress
to notice the gentleman's explanation furthei at I
this time     I  must resume the sub|ect where I |
left off when the gentleman asked me to give way
I was then speaking, I bpheve, of the objections J
of New Jersey   There is one fact connected with
the objections of this State—a most strange and |
extraoidmary ciicumstance — which must lead I
the mind  lriesistibly to the conclusion, that the I
views which I have taken on this subject aie coi-
rect, and in inviting the attention of the House
and of the countiy to the  fact to which  I have
just alluded, I must say that the poisonal regard
which I entcitam foi  the df legation from that
State, and the n speet which I would wish always
to show to the States of this Conf del icy, foibid
me fiom using that language which the occasion
would otheiwise call foi, md justify     Sir, what
is the spectacle now exhibited  by the State ot
New Jeisey before this nation and befne the
woild'    Why, sn, that she is guilty of a sup-
ptessw ten in  a n pc rt made duung this veiy
wintei, by her Legislatuie, upon  the  subject of
the public lands, in which, m pretending to quote
the objections made by her in 1778, she leates out
1'iiee of the matt tmptn ant lines in that objection
And these lines, Mr  Speaker, aid m the muidle
of the objection, before and ajlei vhich she goes on
to m ike the quotation     The lines left out com
menee at the woids " the juusdiction,' &c ,and
go to the woid " but, ' inclusive, which imme
diately precedes the words " íeason and justice,"
&c     Sir, is this fan plav '    Is it honorable for a
sovereign State of this Confederacy to be guilty
of such an artifice '
Mr  RANDOLPH asked leave to explain
Mr  HARRISON yielding the floor,
Mi   RANDOLPH said, lest he might not have
another oppoi tunny, he would ask leave to ex-
plain     He said he had not observed the discrep
ancy noticed  by  the gentleman from Missouri
till this moment, yet the explanation was obvi
ous     The report of 1839 purpoi ts to give a mei c
" exdact" from "a statement of reasons" of the
Legislature   of 1778, against ratifying the Ani-
eles of Confederation   it neither gives the com
mencement nor conclusion  of the  sixth objec-
tion but, beginning in the middle of a sentence,
it quotes only so much of the objection as refers
to the reason thereof, leaving out the three lines
relating to what had been a vexed question, viz
where the jurisdiction over the public Ian Is
should be That, the Legislatuie thought, had
nothing to do with the object of the quotation,
nor, in fact, since the cession of the States and
the adoption of the Constitution, with the sub-
ject mattei of the objection itself Her only
omission, then, is that of two mveited commas,
which would have divided the quotation instead
of leaving it entire
Mr HARRISON I am awaie, sir, that the
question made by the late Legislature of that
State does not commence with the sixth objeo-
t'on, noi end with it But, from the place whera
the quotation was commenced, down to the con-
clusion of it, the uhole of the objection is continuous,
in language and meaning, and therefoie import-
ant And I am suie that no disinteiestod mind
can look at the omission without readily seeing
that it was pwiposely made She had the best of
all leasonsfoi making the omission, for the lines
that were omitted contained the essence of the
doctnnes I am now contending for, which she
found to be a stumbling-block to the gieat object
she had in view Sir, the conduct of the Legis-
latuie of New Jeisey, on this occasion, foi tifies
me in all my views, and gives me the stiongest
assurance in the force and power of my positions
by the tacit acknowledgment she had thus seciet-
ly made
But, Mr Speaker, the ordinance of 1787 is le-
feued to, and is mode to cut a conspicuous figuie
in this débete This, as well as the compact, is
lelied upon asasouice fiom whence the power
is deuved of shipping the new States of those
rights of fieedom,sovei eignty, and independence,
which belong to the other States This, too, like
the deed of cession fiom Vngmia, was made
during the existence of the Confedeiation,and had
an immediate íefcrence to it, as will be seen upon
examination of some of the stnlcmg and import-
ant provisions of that mstiument
I do not mean to asseit the doctrine that the
ordinance, upon the adoption of the Constitution,
became null and void, nor will I admit, as some
contend, that it is not only binding, but unalter-
able, in its piovisions It is nnmateual to me, in
this discussion, in what light it is íegatded In
either point of view, my purpose will be equally
answered But I must confess it is a stiange doc-
ument to be called a compact, for " it is ordained
and declared that the following aiticles shall be
consideied «5 aiticles of compact between the
onginal States and the people and States m the
said Ten itory, and foiever lemam unalterable,
unless by common consent," &c It is not de
clued to be a compact made between two existing
parlies, able and competent to contiact, but sim-
ply ordained that " the following aiticles shall be
considered as articles of compact," cLc It is, be-
sides, a very strange idea that a compact can be
made by one paity only, foi the people " in *¡aid
J\mtoiy " were not rt presented, they had no
agent to act foi them, none that could attend to
aid take care of their interests and as for the
States " in said terutoiy," theie was notone m
existe ice at the time so that the Geneial Gov-
ernment in the ttsttai ext icisc of its kind and pa-
ternal caif, made a cotipact with a party that had
no existence and most amply provided, I must
in candoi confess, for its own particulai mteiests
in the outrages winch if committed, in anticipa-
tion, upon the lights of the States that were yet
to come into the Union, and for whose admission
such hbcial and gene) ous provibions weie so am-
ply piovided
Bat, sn, good or bad, binding or not, I main-
tain that this ordinance, so far as it conflicts with
the deed of cession, or imposes restrictions not
to be found in the deed of cession, is void, be-
cause, the deed being a compact made between too
panics, it cannot be altered, in any respect, with-
out the consent of the othei paity Independ-
ently of this, the new States have a naht to de
mand the fulfillment of yom promises according
to the lettei of y oui bond, and you cannot esc 110
by filling hack upon poweis which it ii quncs 10
in renuity to prove aie arbitiaiy and tyrannical
Ihc simple question in this s age of oui investi-
gation is, does tne oiditiance impose conditions
not found m the deed of cession ' lhis no one
can doubt oi deny, as the fourth article not only
