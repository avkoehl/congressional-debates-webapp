HEADQUARTERS FOURTEENTH ARMY CORPS,DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,

Nashville, December 9, 1862-10.20 p.m.

Major-General THOMAS L. CRITTENDEN,

Commanding Left Wing, camp on Murfreesborough pike:

GENERAL: General McCook has closed in and drawn back his line, and the general commanding wishes you to draw in Van Cleve's division now. Neither the reconnaissance sent out from Sill's, nor that from Sheridan's division, nor that sent out by General Negley on the Hillsborough pike has brought to light any strong force of the enemy along that portion of our front. Unless you can send out to the rear, the general thinks it more prudent not to send out the foraging expedition asked for by General Hascall, at least to-morrow.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. P. GARESCHE,

Assistant Adjutant-General and Chief of Staff.

Major General L. H. ROUSSEAU,

Commanding Division, Center:

GENERAL: The general commanding desires you to order out immediately one brigade of your division, with three days' rations, in support of a reconnaissance on which Brigadier-General Palmer has just started over the Hillsborough road. You will please report also where is your Edgefield brigade, and hereafter send in a daily morning report of your command to these headquarters.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. P. GARESCHE,

Assistant Adjutant-General and Chief of Staff.

NASHVILLE, December 9, 1862

Colonel W. W. LOWE, Fort Henry:

What force is at Donelson? Which is the best place to hold? Where are the most stores? You had better defend one or the other; I think Donelson. March there to-night and hold it. Telegraph me on receipt, and daily, giving hour.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.

LOUISVILLE, December 9, 1862.

Colonel GARESCHE:

Will General Rosecrans send a force to occupy Clarksvill? It will prevent the enemy making the contemplated raid, and save Hopkinsville, &amp;c. I fear the enemy will gain the rear and cut the road. I hope the general will cut him off with his cavalry. The enemy was at Harpeth Shoals, and occupies between that and Springfield. I ordered Bruce yesterday to concentrate his forces, and have repeated the order.

J. T. BOYLE

Brigadier-General.
