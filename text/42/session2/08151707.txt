I wish also in this connection, as this is a
matter of public information, to refer again to
the remarks made by the honorable member
of the House of Representatives to whom I
alluded a moment ago. He seemed to think
that the estimates of our receipts which I have
given you are overstated and are too high,
and he, in order to deter the House, no doubt,
from passing too large expenditures or increas-
ing the expenditures of the Government, en-
deavored to warn them against the possibility
of a deficiency of the revenue. He spoke of
the various sources of revenue. He said:
" The other source of revenue is what is known as
miscellaneous revenue. In its nature it is a very
uncertain item to rely upon."
Then he proceeds, after some discussion, to
reduce the miscellaneous item from $19,384,-
000, as I gave it, to $12,181,379. _ But, sir,
when I come to examine the various items
which compose this miscellaneous item of rev-
enue, T find they are not uncertain. They vary
very much from year to year, but they are
among the most certain sources of revenue,
and there is scarcely a doubt but that the esti-
mate given by me is an under rather than an
over estimate.
Among other sources included in what are
called " miscellaneous" is the tax on the cir-
culation and deposits of national banks, which
is increasing year by year. Last year the tax
was between five and six millions, and this year
it is estimated at $6,303,000. Itis one per cent,
on the amount of circulation and one per cent,
on the amount of deposits, and cannot be less
than from six to eight million dollars.
The other items which form the miscel-
laneous head are si aple items of revenue; for
instance, the "repayment of interest by the
Pacific railroad." That road by its improved
condition year by year is able to pay more and
more. Thenwehave " consular fees," "home-
stead and other land office fees," "tax on
seal-skins," "reimbursement of the United
States for salaries of storekeepers of internal
revenue bonded warehouses"—-as stable as
anything can be—$557,000; "parting charges,
refining gold and silver coin, $200,000;"
direct tax," which is still coming in ; and so
of the various other items which compose this
"miscellaneous" item. My honorable friend
to whom I have alluded has undoubtedly fallen
into an error as to the character and nature of
these sources of revenue. I have no doubt
they will exceed rather than fall short of the
estimates that have been given.
Again, he says that the income tax is esti-
mated to yield $12,000,000. That expires
with the last year, and as a matter of course
that source of revenue fails, but he is in error
in regard to that. The amount of income
tax estimated to be collected during the next
fiscal year is $6,000,000, a part of it being
collected during the present fiscal year and
going in to swell the large surplus for the
present year. Only $6,000,000 was ever esti-
mated for the next fiscal year. He also says :
" The Secretary of the Treasury, taking last year,
and so much of the present year which has passed,
estimates the amount to bo received from customs
for the purpose of estimating the public expenses
at $212,000,000."
The receipts for eight months of the cur-
rent fiscal year, with the same amount during
the next four months, equally as good for
the importation of goods, shows the actual
receipts for the current year to he two hun-
dred and twenty odd million dollars, and
making the ordinary allowance for an increase
the same duties will next year, unless we have
a financial revulsion, produce not less than
$226,000,000, and probably as high as $230,-
000,000, instead of $212,000,000.
I will not pursue this matter further, because
I think I can see very clearly that the object
of the remarks of tiie honorable gentleman to
whom I referred was rather to caution the
House against unnecessarily increasing ex-
penditures, by telling ihe very true and very
sober fact that, every iticrease of appropria-
tion either compels us to continue a tax we
might otherwise repeal, or to levy a new tax
in case the expenditures should greatly exceed
the amount of our revenue.
It thus appears upon the principles I have
stated, and upon estimates that necessa-
rily involve uncertainty, that after applying
$50,000,000 upon the public debt we still will
have a surplus revenue of $50,000,000.
Fifty millions, then, js the extent of our
revenue reduction for this session. How shall
this reduction be distributed among the objects
of taxation? In what mode will the greatest
relief be given to the people of the United
States? Shall this large reduction be made
the occasion of the entire revision of the prin-
ciples upon which our revenue laws are based,
or shall we repeal or reduce the most burden-
some taxes, leaving undisturbed the general
principles of our system?
Since the passage of the act of March 2,
1861, commonly known as the "Morrill tar-
iff," our domestic industry has been protected
from foreign competition by duties on foreign
fabrics, mainly specific, but when reduced to
ad valorem rates, ranging from twenty to eighty
per cent. Under this protection all branches
of manufacture have increased in an unpar-
alleled degree. Old industries have been mul-
tiplied and new industries have been estab-
lished. Our military and naval operations
have been conducted mainly by the products
of home industry. We now produce nearly all
the metallic and textile fabrics necessary for
the use of man, and the superior invention
and intelligence of our mechanics is largely
making good the difference between the cost
of labor here and in Europe.
The actual cost of the leading productions
of industry is now, under domestic competition,
nearly, and in some cases quite, as low as be-
fore the war. The market value of all agri-
cultural products has, by the diversity of our
industry, by the rapid extension of our rail-
roads, been maintained as high in proportion
as mechanical fabrics, while the home manu-
facture of agricultural machines has lessened
the labor of production. Labor of every kind,
from the skilled labor of the artisan to the
rudest form of manual labor, either on the
farm, the mine, the workshop, or the railroad,
has been maintained at much higher propor-
tional rates than the increased costs of mechan-
ical or agricultural productions.
Our protective system has drawn to our
country a vast army of industrious laborers.
Even the high taxes we have been compelled
to impose on domestic industry did not dimin-
ish our production, for they were accompanied
by increased taxes on foreign products. We
may theorize as we will, but the actual condi-
tion of the country is the best evidence that
the industrial policy steadily maintained by us
during the war and since the war has been con-
sistent with the most rapid progress; has en-
abled us to meet unexampled difficulties, and
yet has increased our imports, our exports,
and our revenue.
The fear that high duties would lessen our
foreign commerce is met by the steady growth
of it.
Our imports were—
In 1869 $414,256,243 29
In 1870  452.875,665 68
In 1871  518,759,518 32
Our exports were—
In 1869  413,961,115 00
In 1870 :  409,092,173 00
In 1871  562,518,651 00
thus showing a steady increase in our for-
eign commerce, with a growing balance of
trade in our favor.
We have not the statistics to demonstrate the
annual growth of our internal commerce, but
we know that its increase has been much greater
than our foreign commerce, and is now esti-
mated at the enormous sum of $4,000,000,000.
The falling off in our merchant marine on
the ocean is caused by the substitution of iron
vessels for wooden vessels; and for internal
commerce railroads are rapidly taking the
place of water navigation. If foreign-built
vessels were admitted to American registry,
both for internal and external commerce, at a
reasonable rate of duty, this would not only
encourage the building of American iron
ships, but would secure a healthy competition
in our internal and coasting trade, now abso-
lutely protected by our navigation laws.
If, then, the wisdom of our protective policy
is to be tested by experience, I insist that it
has been proved to have been a wise policy
in the actual condition of our country. No
doubt changes are demanded by the improved
and improving condition of our finances. Our
taxes must be reduced with the wants of the
public service, but every industry that has been
called into existence by our policy, every
skilled laborer whom we have invited to our
shores ot encouraged to devote himself to a
special employment, every capitalist who has
