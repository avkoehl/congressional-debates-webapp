HDQRS. DEPARTMENT AND ARMY OF THE TENNESSEE,Cheraw, S. C., March 4, 1865.

Major General JOHN A. LOGAN,

Commanding Fifteenth Army Corps:

GENERAL: Lieutenant-Colonel Strong spoke to me this morning about the mill near Kellytown. I did not order General Oliver to run the mill for General Smith, but said to him that I believed his own wagons were filled, or that he had a plenty, and in case that was so, I wished him to run the mill for General Smith. I should be much pleased if General Hazen would furnish General Smith with three or four days' supply. At any rate, general, keep General Smith ahead until he has filled his wagons.

Very respectfully,

O. O. HOWARD,

Major-General.
