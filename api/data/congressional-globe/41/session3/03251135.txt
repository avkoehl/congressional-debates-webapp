this information and disseminate it. When we
get up a little feeling on the subject, when Stai es
appear to disadvantage a few times in this
report, they svill furnish the necessary inform-
ation. I believe the publication of this report
throughout the United States will inspire a
spirit of inquiry, will have a tendency to further
the cause of education; for my observation is
that itis a much neglected cause, and that there
is more danger to our institutions from that
source than from any other.
Now, when there has been an honest attempt
on the part of the Commissioner, furnished as
he is with but very little machinery, to corre-
spond with the officers of different States and
Obtain information throughout the country for
the purpose of laying that information before
the people; when that attempt on his part has
been honestly made with all the machinery at
liainl and the information that has been given
him is inaccurate, let that fact go to the world;
let the information that he has obtained go;
and next, year, when the people of the States
understand that this is an important matter
and that they appear to disadvantage, those
public officers who refuse to give the inform
ation which they might easily do will be called
to account by tlieir own constituents.

for to-day.
Mr. BAYARD. I hope I shall be permit-
ted to congratulate the Senate and the coun-
try upon the fact that the education of our
children is to be furthered by the publication

the way of the education of our childrenâ€”to
publish a parcel of opinions, in the first place
worthless, and in the next place untrue 1
