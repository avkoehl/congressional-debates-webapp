During the night the movements of the enemy retreating were distinctly audible. A drenching rain came on next morning and flooded the woods where our men slept, and we were early ordered back to where the river joins the Long Bridge road.

Late in the evening of the 2nd I received orders from General Lee to return to this post, where I have since remained.

The accompanying map will illustrate my report.*

HENRY A. WISE,
