LITTLE ROCK, May 2, 1864.

Brigadier General NATHAN KIMBALL,

Pine Bluff:

We have no news of General Steele, except through Pine Bluff. My opinion is that the enemy will follow him and either attack this or Pine Bluff. The Emma may be needed to transport troops. Had you not better come up here on the boat that brings the sick and go by way of White River? I have telegraphed Andrews about the defenses of Pine Bluff. Please give him the benefit of your counsel.

J. R. WEST,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

LITTLE ROCK, May 2, 1864.

Brigadier General C. C. ANDREWS,

Pine Bluff:

What force, artillery, infantry, and cavalry, are sufficient, in your opinion, to defend Pine Bluff against 6,000 of the enemy of the same arms?

J. R. WEST,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

LITTLE ROCK, ARK., May 2, 1864.

Brigadier General C. C. ANDREWS,

Pine Bluff, Ark.:

General Steele arrived here this afternoon, and is satisfied that his army was safe, the enemy not having crossed the Saline. The firing heard might have been an affair with Fagan's force, which is supposed to be on this side of the Saline. Send me a field return of your command by first opportunity.

J. R. WEST,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

Colonel WOOD,

Commanding, Brownsville:

What is your effective strength, and how is it disposed of at present?

J. R. WEST,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

LITTLE ROCK, AKR., May 2, 1864.

Colonel WOOD,

Brownsville:

I may want to bring all your force here within the next twenty-four hours. Have them all in hand, so that they can be moved at an hour's notice. Meanwhile relax no vigilance against attacks.

J. R. WEST,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
