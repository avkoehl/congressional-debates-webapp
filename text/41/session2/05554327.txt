legislative, etc., appropriation bill.
The House resumed the consideration of the
Senate amendments to the legislative, etc.,
appropriation bill.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. All general
debate has now terminated by order of the
House.
Mr. LAWRENCE. I would like to say a
few words, especially in reply to the gentleman
from Kentucky, [Mr. Beck.]
Mr. DAWES. The gentleman from Ohio
[Mr. Lawrexce] is a member of the Commit-
tee on Appropriations, and if he desires to
reply to the gentleman from Kentucky [Mr.
Beck] I hope he will have the opportunity.
No objection was made; and leave was
accordingly granted.
Mr. LAWRENCE. I did not happen to be
in the House when the gentleman from Ken-
tucky [Mr. Beck] commenced his remarks, but
I know the contents of the letter which I under-
stand he had read at the Clerk's desk. I have
here in my possession some additional letters
from the Treasury Department which show that
that Department has been conducted during
the last year in the interest of economy, and
that it has been very successful in its efforts to
reduce the public expenditures.
I wish to state that prior to March, 1869, the
time when General Grant entered upon the
office of President, the expense of printing the
currency, which was done at the Treasury De-
partment, was at the rate of $655,185 36 per
annum. Since that time the currency has been
printed at an annual expense of $302,275 54;
or a saving on this one item over the previous
year of $352,919 82. In reference to this sub-
ject I call attention to a letter from Secretary
Boutwell.
The letter was as follows:
Treasury Department,
June 7,1870.
Sir: Previous to January 1, 1809, no account of
expenses in the Bureau of Engraving and Printing
was kept. From Januaiy 1 to March 1, 1SC9, the
expenses of the bureau, exclusive of the amount paid
for paper, were $166,996 57, orattherateof $667,986 28
per annum. During the three months horn January
1 to March 1 the office was reimbursed in the sum
of 83,200 23 for work done for the internal revenue
office and other offices of the Treasury Department;
or at the rate of $12,800 92 per annum; showing a
net expense for currency pi-mting, exr.lnsive of the
amount paid for paper, at the rate of $655,185 36 per
annum.
From the 1st of March, 1869, to tho 1st, of M.irch,
1870, the total expenses of the Bureau of Engraving
and Printing, exclusive of the amount paid for paper,
were $538,739 49, and during the same period the
bureau was reimbursed, on account of the work done
for the internal revenue office and other othces of the
Treasury Department, in the sum of $236,403 95,
showing a net expense on account of currency print-
ing of $302,275 54: and a saving in net expense atthe
rate of $352,919 82 per annum.
On the 1st of January, 1869, there were seven hun-
dred and twelve persons employed in the Bureau of
Engraving and Printing, and on the 1st of March tho
sarno year the numberwas reduced to three hundred
and eighty-nine; yet the expense appears to havo
been greatly in excess of the expense of the bureau
when even a larger number of persons havo been
employed.
It is sale to say that the average amount of work
done upon the currency since the new issue, and its
substitution as rapidly as possible for the previous
issues has been twice as laigo as it was durms tho
three months last named. This saving has been
effected principally by the substitution of hand
presses for tho hydrostatic presses.
Very respectfully, g_ BOUTWELL,
Secretary.
Hon. William Lawrence,
Ilome of Representatives.
Mr. LAWRENCE. I wish to say further,
that (he Bureau of Engraving and Printing in
the Treasury Department, so far as their ma-
terial, machinery, employ6s, and rooms will
permit, is now printing stamps for the internal
revenue department. And in reference to the
single article of tobacco and cigar stamps, the
printing, when done in New York, cost, for
a given number, $200,97G, while it has cost
but $133,112 00 to do the same printing in
the Treasury Department, or a saving of
$06,833 40 upon that one item. I have a
table here which gives the matter in detail.
The table is as follows:

Mr. LAWRENCE. I ought to say that the
Printing Bureau of the Treasury Department
is not able to print all the stamps that are
required; but so far as it is possible to have
the work done there, it is done at the rate set
forth in the table I have submitted.
Mr. ARNELL. Why is it not able?
Mr. LAWRENCE. Because it has not a
sufficient amount of machinery nor a sufficient
number of persons to do the work ; and there
is not sufficient available room to accommodate
the necessary amount of machinery and num-
ber of persons to do the work.
Mr. ARNELL. My information, from the
person in charge of that bureau, is the very
opposite of what the gentleman now states.
Mr. LAWRENCE. Very well; I state tho
facts as I get them ; that is all I have to say.
I also call attention to a letter from General
Spinner to the Secretary of the Treasury, show-
ing that since Secretary Boutwell came into the
Treasury Department almost every branch of
it has been conducted with greater efficiency
and afc a vastly reduced expense. I am certain
of that.
The letter referred to was as follows:
Treasury or the United States,
Washington, May 21,1870.
Bear Sir: Your letter of yesterday's date has
been received. Your presumption that tho increase
of employes in this oflice "has been made because
of an incrcaso of business" is entirely correct.
Tho number of poisons this day employed in this
oflice is 372
The number that were so employed March 4,
1869, was 283
The whole increase since March 4,18C9, there-
fore, is only  81
Of this last number theie arc employed in exam-
ining and counting coupons that were formerly
manipulated elsewhere  0
In tho handling and keeping the accounts of
the United States stocks that havo been and
are being bought for the sinking fund 3
In tho franking of all mailable matter made
necessary by an act of Congress  1
— 10
Employed on increase of work on issues and
redemptions  74
This increase of employes on the increase of tho
work heretofore done in the oiliccis less than twenty-
four per cent.
Tho work in addition to the three new kinds inau-
gurated within the year has increased as follows:
In the month of March, 1809, there were received
by this office from the printing division sixteen hun-
dred and thirty-eight packages of legal-ten lor notes
and fractional currency, amounting to £13,015,320.
In the month ol March, 1870, this delivery had
increased to twenty-eight hundred and twenty-one
packages, amounting to $27,801,900; making for every
working day in tho hrst-named month Mxty-throo
packages, amounting to £500,5S9 per day; nnd in the
corresponding month of this year, one hundred and
nine packages that averaged Sl,072,705per day; being
an increase of seventy-three per cent, on tho number
of packages, and of one hundred and fourteen per
cent. Oil tho amounts received.
In the month ot March, 1809, the daily receipts of
old currcncy averaged one hundred anil ninety puck-
ages, amounting to $327,940 for each working day.
In the corresponding month ot the current year
the daily receipts of f-uch packages averaged two hun-
dred and forty-live for each working day, and the
average for each such day amounted to $399,324;
bcingan mereascon thonumhcrol packages received
daily in the last March over that in the preceding
year of twenty-nine per cent., and on tho amounts
of receipts ot twenty-two per cent.
The small percentage on this last item is duo to the
comparatively large amount of fractional currency
received for redemption, which would show a large
increase by pieces, but not by amounts. It is, how-
ever, a fair ofTsctlorthelargoly increased percentage
on the amounts over packages stated above as re-
ceived iroui tho division ot printing. Tho various
denominations of legal-tender notes find of frac-
tional currency have increased from twenty-two to
thirty-four different kinds, being an increase oi more
than filty-three per .'cent. The counters agree that
this increase more than doubles tho labor in assort-
ing in the redemption division. The percentage of
increase of work and the relative increase ol em-
ployes within the year will stand as toilows :
Per cent.
In issues by packages  73
In issues by amounts 111
In redemption by package*  29
In redemptions by amouuts  22
In redemption on additional kinds  53
Total 291
being an average increase of labor of about fifty-
eight per cent., while the working force was increased
less than twenty-four per cent., or much less than one
half of the proportional increa.se.
During the time of the late Administration tho
Department was crammed with appointees, who,
when appointed, had little or nothing to do. Tins
was mainly due to the action of Mr. Cooper, then
one of the assistants of the Secretary, and m some
cases in opposition to the earnest remonstrance ot
chiefs of bureaus. It was attempted on this oilioc,
but did not succecd. The effect of this over-crowd-
ing of the offices on the incoming of the present
Administration was, that while in your own olnco
proper, and in some of the bureaus, iargereductionb
in the number of clerks and others were practicable,
in this office none could be made, because there wero
no more persons on the rolls than were required tor
the proper transaction of the public^business. \\ hen
you decided to replace the whole of tho old outitand-
ing circulation with new, amounting mtac issue arid
