^^he leading man among the signers of that treasonable petition
■was himseff a modern Loco Foco, a Van Buren man, who ran on
the toco Foro ucke* as a candidate for the Senate of Massachu
setts The man was a disuniomst, and that very fact probably
had constituted one of the reasons why the Whigs refused to re-
ceive him This fact showed the vtflany of the farce which it
vías here attempted to play Who were the men that weie
thirsting for the blood of the gentleman from Massachusetts,
and crying out "Crucify, crucify "' They were the political
associates of the very man who had headed this petition Who
was he? His name was Nathan Webster, no relation of Da
niel, although, a^ to Daniel himself, Mr A did not know ex
actly how he was now figuring before the nation He greatly
feared that he would turn out a leal New Hampshire man, and
that was but another name for a man who loved office more
than he loved his country Dame!, however, had at least this
praise, that he had never set himself against this Union And
now what was the House going to doi To punish the gentle
man from Massachusetts for presenting here a petition which
their own political friends had sent to him Was this a pi oof
that he wanted the Union dissolved "Í If it proved any thing, it
proved that the political friends of gentlemen heie were ene
mies of the Union All the gentlemen from Massachusetts de
sired was, to have an opportunity of replying to these petitions,
and, if the once got that opportunity, Mr Arnold would be-
come security that Mr. Nathan Webster would never send an-
other such petition here
Wlat a farce was this whole matter of the 21 st rule' What
a perfect failure' The House had been more perplexed with
it than it would have been without it, because, from the nature
of the case, no luie could be adopted that would not htve that
effect Gentlemen might as well attempt to dam up the waters
oí the Niagara as to attempt to stay this right oí petition It
was one of the inherent rights oí the fiee people of this conn
trv, and a right thev never would surrendei If he Hou&e re
fused to hear some of their petitions, and admitted others, it
was evmvalent to telling the people that they wert not able to
j udge what peti ions it was proper to send, and i f one less f hin a
majonty might íule in this.matter, then many legs than a
majority might rule, and the number might be reduced till at
last it was brought down to one, and we had an admitted des
potism And, aiter all, what had the South gamed by the rule?
Its only effeu was to combine with the Abolitionists all the mul-
titudes who contended for the right of petition It gamed them
converts by the hundred, by the thousand It exasperated the
minds of the people, disgusted them with their Government,
made them caie less and le^s for the Union, and prepared them
for its dissolution The free States had now a majority of forty
four m that House Under the new census they would have
fifty three The cause of the slaveholdmg States was celling
weaker and weakei, and what were they to do? Gentlemen
pleached to them that they must rely on the modern Demncii
cy of theNouh God deliver them fiom such an alliance' A
gentleman from New Hampshire lud called that ¡state the
Switzerland of America, and ho spoi e truly, for her inhabitants

should attempt to do justice hetween man and man, these mer
cenaiy Swias would instantly deceit them, ay, and Would be

Mr A was u ady to concede the wght of petition, but he ne
ver would yield th^ tight to inlet fire with ¡slavery within the
States, where U had been tecognised by the Constitut on This
had heen dom in th.ee distinct art cle^ of that sacred covenant
The South stood upon her light?, and insisted upon bemg let

they had arancel which was eating inte their vitals, they did not
want the Northern probe uidely thrust in to take what litt'e life

lenidined A political and civil equality between whites and

uf it wab vun, slavei y was thtir misfoitune, not their crime
It was here, and how was u to begorten nd of* The IS o i the in
lemedies were wois than the di-sCi^e Did gentlemen suppose
that Southern men would ever sufler then thuphtei« ¡o be the
associates of Quashipompo, or enter into aiiancc with negio
husbamlh'1 Did they themselves desire to =ut m this Houst,
cheek by jowl with a woolly headed member who needed no
musk to give him perfume? Ho had confiltnce in his North
ern brethren, he could not believe that they wanted to invade
the South, and help the slaves to cut the thtoaM of their wives
nnd chddren They could not desire to see the flames of their
habitations quenched by human blood
Hih. friend be Jie him [Mi. Sla.de] was said to bo an Abolí
tionist but he had lived ^i\ months in the same house with him
ten yeais ago, and had been on familiar terms with him and
n'ver had heird the subject of abolition in ntioned Would
that man ¡end his aid in effecting such an^iili1* No if w¿«¡
contrary to ilu, Chustidn religion—it was asawst all the better
ieelinge of oui natuie The pretext for opposing slavery was
a Christian tee!mi> of humanity, and could humanity, could
Christianity, lead men to abet insurrection devastation and
bloodshed? Mr A had supported a Noithern President, and
that when the billow  of Jack-onism were rolling m a flood over
the land He had voted for a Massachusetts man in spite of
pvery thins and now he tinned to thelSoith, and said to his
Northern biethien, 'Let us alone" He was willing to teceive
their petitions under the Const union they must be willing io
surrender up fugitive slave  and to tesist aseivile war, under
the pro rw o;=ofthe bame bacred instrument
And now he would adl one word to hi-> Southern friends lie
would ask them what the South had to rely on if the Union w^re
dissolved? Suppose the dissolution could be peaceably effected,
(if that did no involve a contradiction in terms) what had the
South to depend upon'' All the crowned heads were against

the houth reflected, the more clearly she must see that she had
a deep and vital interest m maintaining 'he Fmon
Mr A had been gratified to hear the Farewell Address of the
Father of his Country read in that hail.   He loved to hear k
CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
He had ever made Washington his model, considering, as ho
did, that purity and integrity were the Iwo leading virtues of
his character, and he had ever believed that puuty and integ
rite were above wisdom and tact.        ,,,,._
The young gentleman from Virginia had told the House that
he was not descended from the aristocracy of the land, neither
had Mr A As a celebrated Democratic orator m a certain
Western Legislature had said, when defending Captain Tyler,
"he was descended from thePilgrlm family that landed on Ply-
mouth Rorlt hi the Old Dominion, commonly called the State
of Vngima " His fathei had heen no Federalist, hut a .Tefler
soman Democrat He would as lief have been called a mad dog
ascalled a Fedeiahst At thevery sound of the word, he laid
his hand tin his bioad axe He must say, that he thought his
young friend had been particularly unfonunate, asa fnendto
the philosopher of Monticello, in alluding to his "domestic re
lations" None were without then foibles, and Mr Jefferson
had his, but no friend of his memory acted prudently in refer
ring to that part of his chaiacter Mr A here related some
anecdotes of hisown eaily history,lllustiative of his father's
attachment to Mi Jefferson's fame and then related the par-
ticulars of a visit he had made to Mount Vernon, the feelings
of solemn veneration with which he had been led through
apartments once familiar to General Washington, and theeff ct
of asohtaiy visit to his tomb, whereMr A had solemnly vow
ed, in the piesence of God and of the ashes of that departed sage
and hero, to makehis principles the guide of his life Nor had
heeverbroken hisvow Heafterwards madeasimilai visitto
Monticello, and, in inquiring in the vicinity as to the private
character and deportmtntof Mi Jefferson, had become abun
dantly satisfied that the lovers of his fame would do prudently
in nevel alluding again to his "domestic lelatioas "
This led him to speak of the condition of Virginia, which he
compared to the rums of ancient Thebes on which nothing was
to be seen butthevul'ure orihe carrion ciow, and at whose
base no inhabitants were to be founn but the fox and jackall
She could bo^isc of having given birth to some of the srieatestof
mankind Hei's were the names of Washington, and Jefferson,
and Madison, and Marshall, but there, with a few bright excep
tions, her boast for the presentmust stop
Before be resumed his seat, he must be allowed one woid to
his y oung friend from Virginia That gentleman was quite fe-
rocious towards Abolitionists, but who were his own allies at
this momont at the other end of the Capítol!
In Ohio there had once been a man who was familiarly called
Ben Tappan, a brother to the great Abolitionist of that name in
theNortti—to that Arthur lappan who had, by the power of
his money, íecentW gotten up an Abolition convention and
nominated a Governor, President, and Vice President, and had
appointed emissaries to advice the negroes of tbe South to run
away, burn their masters' houses, and cut their throats Now,
with regard io this Benjamin Tappan, wi h whom tbe
gentleman was now imntimate alliance, it was very com-
monly said, and univeisally believed in Ohio, that he liad
openly declared thatif he stood on the northern bank of the
Ohio and saw across the i lvei the slaves burning the planta
tions and cutting the thioats of women and children, he would
fold hi* arms and not lift a finger to stop the massacre and
that if bis son attempted to go to the rescue of the unfortunate
whites he would disinherit him And yeta man, who could
act in concert with a bloodthirsty wretch like this, could get up
here and lecture this House on abolition, and if men from the
South wou! 1 ncf agree with him, and go theentne length that
he did, they weie to be denounced by some Clement C Clay, or
by tbe gentlcmin himself, as Abohtionis's while, at tbe same
moment, lit could take to his bosem one who had avowed feel
ingsso odious and damnable '
Mr A here alluding to the late hour and the fatigued Condi
tionof the House sii1 tint he thought it quite time to close
this debate, jnd with a view todo so, he would move to lay the
whole subject on the table
At this moment many gentlemen rose to then feet desirous to
address the Chan, and lemonstranceswere so loud and mime
rousthatMr A saidthat hewouldnothimse'fupm oppositio i
to the wishes of the Houss, and should not, therefore, insist
upon his motion
Mr A concluded at 5 o'clock
And the 8PEAKL11 gave the floor to
Mi SALTONSi AIL who, afier some hesitation as to the
propriety of yielding toan ad]o irnment, went into astatement
of the fact-, relating to the obnoxious petition presented by Mr
Adams lipm winch all the pte&ent difficulties had arisen He
give a history of tbe use ind poioess ol the idea of dissolving
the Union begn ninewith thevauous thieatsfiom theSouth
ern portion of the Union—from ihosp opposed to a tariff, from
the nu llfication pa ty &x Tins petition was from his own na
tive town, Haverhill, and he felt much sui prised and distiessed
at fheencumstance
Mr S then went into a vigorous reply to Mr Wi&e, and elo-
quently defended his venerated colleague [Ml. Adamr] from the
nutritious violent charges made against him in the long speec*
of i he eentleman from Virginia
When Mr S had concluded—
Mr THOMPSON of Indiana, rose and said he thought this
debate had pi oceeded far enough, and that no good end could be
obtained by letung it eo on, he theiefore moved to lay the
whole subject on the table
Mi THOMAS T MARSHALL appealed to Mr T to
withdraw the motion that he niighi have an opportunity to
saya few words as tothonatureol the proposition he had sub
mitted
Mr THOMPSON expiessed himself willing to do so if
the gentleman would state that he desned the floor for the pur
pose of explanation, and would renew the motion to lay on the
table
Some convention followed hut amidst so much confusion
that the Rpporier could heai nothing that was said
Mr GILMER alsi appealed to Mr Thompson to withdiaw
the motior, (o enable hnn [Mr G J to make an explanation as
he was the original mover of ihe res Iution,and had not yet had
an opportunity o<" saying any thing
After much confusion, the Speakei stated to Mi Thompson
that he must state positively whethei hewithdrew his motion
or not
Mi  THOMPSON said he did not withdraw it

IN SENATE,
Friday, January 28,1842
Messrs. TALLMADGE, CLAY, ARCHER,
and W00DBR1DQE, presented memorials re-
monstrating against the amendment or repeal of
the Bankrupt law; which were referred to the Com-
mittee on the Judiciary.
Mr. WRIGHT presented two petitions—one
from Niagara county, the other from Tompkins
county, in the State of New York, praying for a
repeal of the Bankrupt law.
Mr. PRENTISS, from the Committee on Pa-
tents and the Patent Office, to which was referred
the petition of Charles M. Keller, reported a bill
for his relief, which was read and ordered to a
second reading.
Mr. WRIGHT, from the Committee on Claims,
made an adverse report on the petition of Jona-
than Pntchard, for indemnity for the loss of a ves-
sel in the late war, and the petition of Henry W.
Andrews, for indemnity for the loss, oí properly
by hostile Indians in Florida; which were ordered
to be printed.
Mr. MANGTJM, from the Committee on Pen-
sions, made an adverse report on the petition of
Amy Babbit, for a pension; which was ordered to
be printed.
Mr PHELPS, from the Committee on Claims,
made an unfavorable report on tbe petition of John
Wells; which was ordered to le printed.
Mr. GRAHAM, onleave, introduced a bill mak-
ing an appropriation to reopen Roanoke Inlet.
Mr G said that, although he had given notice
of i his bill several weeks smte, he had delayed
asking leave to introduce it until he could obiam
certain information which he desired from a dis-
tinguished civil engineer, who had made a snrvey
nad report under the direction of fee Legislature of
North Caro ma on the subject of reopening Roa-
noke Inlet. The work was one of deep concern to
the people of that State, whose General Assembly,
at each of its two last sessions, had adopted reso-
lutions urging it upon the the attention oí Congress
as, m the highest degree, important to tbe com-
merce and navigation of the Union. He held in
his hand a copy of these resolutions and of the re-
port of the engineer, (Major G ynn) to which he
had already alluded, and wished to lay these on
the table for the information of the Senate, a«id of
the committee to whom the bill might be referred.
He would, therefore, enter into no discussion of
the objecis of the bill at present, except to remark
that Roanoke inlet was once the direct channel of
communication from Albemarle soUHd to the At-
lantic ocean; ¡hat,'u process of time, it had been
filled up, and the waters of the sound weie com-
pel'ed to seek an outlet by forcing their way south-
wardly to Pamlico sound, and thence through Oc-
racoke inlet to ihe sea. By the change which
had taken place, ve-, els from the Albemarle, or
any of its tributaries, bound to New York, or any
Northern port, were obliged to take this southern
direction out to tea at Ocracoke, and to
perform a voyage of more than 120 mdes
to return to the latitude oí Roanoke inlet or Nags-
head, encountering in its progress the expense of
lighterage over shallows, the risks of a narrow,
difficult, and of en changing channel, before reach-
ing the ocian, and then the perils if doubling Cape
Haticras, which manners more drepd than almost
any part tif the American coast This bill con-
templates reopening the ancient entrance to Albe-
marle sound, near 60 miles, north of Cape Halte-
ras, by forcing a passage through a sand beach,
about oie-halfoi three-fourths of a mile m extent,
and thus avoiding all the difficulties and dangers
of the present courss of navigation. It will be
seen, in the report of the engineer, that the com-
merce, now laboring under these impediments,
