The enemy having disappeared, except a mounted force, which was driven pell-mell by our artillery (it having just returned front he fortress where it had gone to replenish its ammunition), the troops were withdrawn in as good order as if coming form an afternoon drill, and reached their quarters at 6 p. m. The fight was sharp and decisive, and the battle-flags of our country floated again victoriously over the memorable field of Stone's River.
