FORT LEAVENWORTH, KANS., October 17, 1864.

Brigadier-General DAVIES,

Fort Leavenworth, Kans.:

SIR: I desire all troops (no matter as to age) armed as fast as they organize and make application for arms and equipments, and respectfully request that you issue accordingly.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

THOS. CARNEY,

Governor and Commander-in-Chief.

FORT LEAVENWORTH, October 17, 1864.

Major-General CURTIS,

Kansas City:

The Doniphan County regiment, Colonel Tracy, is here and the Governor in my office for 300 blankets for troops here and north, under your late directions and telegrams last night to the Governor that blankets would be sent to Wyandotte. I do not feel at liberty to issue here. Shall I issue 300 pairs to the Governor on his receipt.

THOS. A. DAVIES,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

KANSAS CITY, October 17, 1864.

General DAVIES:

Why are troops delayed? Send all but the 600 detailed by your requisition on General Deitzler. Will see General Deitzler as to the issue of blankets in the rear. We may need all for the field. There is no enemy of any consequence north, south, or west. I am well posted and I am pressing forces to the front, where I hope to strike him very soon. What armed forces are now in Leavenworth City, including armed laborers at the post?

S. R. CURTIS,

Major-General.

FORT LEAVENWORTH, October 17, 1864.

Major-General CURTIS,

Kansas City:

On looking at your telegram the second time I may have misunderstood it. I sent a list of forces to you, and if you require any of them, will your order such as you think proper. You say al but the 600 detailed by General Deitzler. I think you don't mean this; I presume you mean all the State forces. Do you want me to send any of the Deitzler detail? If so please order.

THOS. A. DAVIES,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

FORT LEAVENWORTH, October 17, 1864.

Major-General CURTIS:

In Leavenworth there are 600 of the Seventh Kansas Militia and one company of cavalry and about 400 old guard exempts rapidly putting up fortifications. At the fort for duty: 200 Seventh Kansas, 300 town
