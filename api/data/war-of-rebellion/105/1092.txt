GEORGE M. HANCON, Esq.,

Superintendent of Indian Affairs, Northern District of California, San Francisco, Cal.:

SIR: I have this moment received your communication of the 21st instant, together with the letter from the udge of the country court of Del Norte, addressed to you. I have previously given orders for the company now at Fort Ter-Waw to prepare to move to the new reservation which you have selected on Smith's River, and I was only waiting until such number of Indians should be assembled there as would render necessary the presence of troops. I will thank you to let me know what number of Indians are now on the Smith's River Reservation, and whether all those which were near Ter-Waw have been removed.

Very respectfully, your most obedient servant,

G. WRIGHT,

Brigadier-General, U. S. Army, Commanding.

GENERAL: The steamer with the mail sails to-morrow morning for Panama. I have but little to add in relation to affairs in the department. I have just received a report from Captain Price, Second Cavalry California Volunteers, who was sent to Carson City, Nev. Ter., with his company, with a view to settle Indian difficulties at Honey Lake and Pyramid Lake. I am happy to say that all apprehensions of an Indian war in that country have passed away. Captain Price has moved with his company to Pyramid Lake, accompanied by Governor Nye and the Indian agent. Soon he will fall back to Fort Churchill and join the command under orders for the protection of the Overland Mail Route.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

The light artillery battery company was organized in this city last summer, and I take great pleasure in bearing witness to its rapid progress and fine appearance on the field. The company drills very frequently. It passed my office yesterday en route for exercising on the Presidion grounds. The officers and men in full uniform, the guns, horses, and equipments, all in splendid order. This is the only light battery organized int his State, and has involved the officers and men in considerable expense, a part of which only has been covered by a recent appropriation by the Legislature. Such organizations should be cherished and fostered by the Government, and I beg leave to recommend to the
