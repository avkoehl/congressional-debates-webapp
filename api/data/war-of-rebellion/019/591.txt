Colonel Wright passed Carthage, going south, yesterday morning. On the 20th he came up with the rear guard several times, attacking it, killing 12, capturing 21 prisoners, several guns, horses, and some other property. The Kansas troops are a few miles in his rear, moving to his support. Coffee still has the two cannon captured north of the river. All the rebels in Western Missouri are moving out of the State with Coffee.
