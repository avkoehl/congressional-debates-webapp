M. L. BONHAM,

Governor of the State of South Carolina, Columbia, S. C.:

DEAR GOVERNOR: Your letter of the 17th instant has been received. The number of companies required at Georgetown (which is a part of the State from which the Abolitionists ought to be kept our if practicable) may go up t ten, or one regiment, if so many can be furnished. The batteries in that district are very much exposed, being only supported at present by some inferior cavalry. Captain Thomas only offered the services of his company for the defense of Charleston. It would of course by very acceptable for Georgetown, as well as any other similar companies up to the number above stated.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. T. BEAUREGARD,

Genera, Commanding.
HDQRS. DEPT. SOUTH CAROLINA, GEORGIA, AND FLORIDA,Charleston, S. C., March 21, 1863.

Brigadier General JOSEPH FINEGAN,

Commanding Third Miliary District, Lake City, Fla.:

GENERAL: The report of your engagement with the Abolitionists at Jacksonville on the 10th instant has been received. I congratulate you
