HDQRS. THIRD SEPARATE Brigadier, EIGHTH ARMY CORPS,Baltimore, July 10, 1864.

Lieutenant-Colonel LAWRENCE,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Eight Army Corps:

COLONEL: I have the honor to report that four companies of the Tenth Veteran reserve Corps, numbering 300 men, under Colonel De Witt, have reported to me. The other two companies are expected this evening or to-morrow morning. I have distributed them as follows: One company to guard the bridge across Gwynn's Falls on the Frederick road, one company to guard the bridge across the same stream on the Washington turnpike, one company at he redoubt on this side. Gwynn's Falls between the Frederick and Washington turnpikes, and the remaining company in reserve near Fort Numbers 1. The companies at the bridges are ordered to resist any attempts of the enemy to cross these bridges, and to arrest all stragglers.

Very respectfully,

JOHN R. KENLY,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

Lieutenant Colonel S. B. LAWRENCE,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Eight Army Corps:

COLONEL: My means of ascertaining the approach of an enemy is confined exclusively to my infantry pickets, guards, and patrols, as it has been impracticable, I presume, to furnish me with mounted men. The cavalry which reported to me this morning I ordered to Camp Bradford as its commanding officer reported it unfit for duty, and its appearance indicated it. I shall order the commanding officer of the cavalry stationed at Camp Bradford to report to me at once with every available man and horse, with which I hope to have a cavalry picket on the roads leading into the city. I beg you, however, to furnish me with some mounted men, if it be at all possible, as I have to use every horse with my command in keeping my posts in communication. My detachments are at various distances from the main guard here and are disposed of to the best of my judgment, but they are utterly insufficient to guard the extended lines of approach to the city. I am using every man I have expect those sent me to-day from Camden Street Hospital, under Lieutenant Bronson, and the convalescents from Jarvis Hospital, which are not yet fully armed and equipped owing to the pressure for arms on the ordnance officer. All my officers and men are working earnestly and willingly, expect the mixed cavalry ordered to me this morning, and to which I have before referred, and which I regret to say will be of no use whatever, at least I fear so.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOHN R. KENLY,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
