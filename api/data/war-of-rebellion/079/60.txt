I will be near Lewisburg to-night. Cannot learn where Forrest is. Citizens leaving Pulaski this morning report all quiet there. I believe that Forrest has gone to the Northwestern railroad. Please answer, giving me all the information you can.

Captain J. B. DICKSON,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Lexington, Ky.:

CAPTAIN: I have just been informed by telegraph from the post commander at Columbus, Ky., that a force of 500 cavalry, under Colonel Tansil, left Jackson, Tenn., on yesterday, moving in this direction, and fear, from what I learn, that it is the advance of a larger force. Can you give me any assistance? I have telegraphed for two gunboats to proceed from Mound City to Columbus.

Captain J. GRAHAM, Assistant Adjutant-General:

I have information this evening from a reliable Union man that Colonel Tansil left Jackson, Tenn., with 500 cavalry on last Thursday, and at latest accounts was moving in this direction. I feel insecure with the number of troops I have at present. Can a gun-boat be sent here to protect town and Government buildings until re-enforcements arrive?
