2o2               ____ _append:
¿5th Comg'-'-Svd Sess.                    Bill to
xvit-e more efficacious, to which the injured or ne-
gleo'ed are directed to look, with confident as-
surance, for the fulfilment ot all the obligations
expressed or implied from previous action affect-
ing their interest Well, sir, the location of the
road from the Ohio to the bank of the Mississippi,
with an appropriation to construct a part of ¡t from
the Ohio uest, is an undertaking to finish it, when
taken m connection with the action and coui^e ot
tne Government in locating and constructing that
portion of the same road eas of the Ohio But
this is not all, sir, the Government altervvaids pri-
mitas that this road shall pass through ihe seats ci
Government of Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois, and, as
if to make every thing certain, it sends its agent*
along the line, and procures releases ol all damages
which might be claimed for injuries to puvate pro-
perty, and a cession of the necessary stone and
timber for its completion, a great portion oí which
is now strewed along its borders
this is not all, -ir When the Goveminent
wished to rid 'tself of the burthen of keeping the
finished portion of the road in repair, it stipulated
a large amount to the State through which it pars-
ed for present repairs, and another amount to ano-
ther State, to finish another portion of it b< lore the
Slate should be requested to accept its charge
This looks very much like the Government fell
itselt unde. an obligation to finish the load through |
those States at least If those acts aie not deem- i
ed sufficient to imply a promt t to the new Stales
that the toad would be finished through them, a i it
had been begun, then I refer jou to its acts, ¡n con-
nection with the road, for thirty jears, to the quan-
tity now finished, and the quantity half finished,
extending veiy nearly iiom tae east side of Indi-
ana to Vandalia, with the materials m a hilf pre-
paied condition to go into the woik now lying upon
its margin It those things, taken togethei, do
not amount to a pledge of sovereign faith, that the
road shall be finished with convenient speed, I can
conceive of no acts that would- acts and conduct
more equivocal, in private life, would be deemed
by an honest jury sufficient to fix liabilit) upon a
jockej, who had violated ihe understanding which
they implied.
But to the expediency ot making thi appiopua
tion at this time, considemif, the powit) ei th-
Nitiom' Tieasui)
S i, this road has been in iceount w ith the Titi-
suty for thirty jtare Since us eomi cmement
the nation has pissed thro>igh an expinsne war
with one of the grpatpst po veis ot Luiope, >et, in
that time, or since, I have never heard that this
cause was urged against an appropriation till now
What, sir, shall we be told we have millions to
squander in xoyages oí discovei}, and nothing to
p\pend in knitting and uniting the members of this
Confederacy togethei' Shall we be told tnat a
piecedmg Administration, called prodiga1, with an
income not more than the present, c mid app'opn-
,fc more than ever had before been, or has since
een, to purposes of internal linniovmtnt, detiay
ill the expenses of the Government, an i pav ten
millions annually into the sinking fund, lor the ex
tiiiguishment of the national debt, and soil have a
surplus left to corrupt the nation, and yet tint ibis
economical Administration, without a national
debt to pay, with an equal income with ti e preced-
ing one, and with a loan of ten millions in
the way of Treasuiy notes, end another
of the same or greater amount i antiei
pation within the fiscal year, cannot spare
'his small sum to this work' If tnts be
tue, and the real ground of onpo-iuon, he
lould only «ay it was a pjor a"eount of Ihe
economy and financial skill of those w> o adminis-
ter our aflairs But a few words rr oie, aid 1 am
i'one I live on this road, and havi ob erv"d its
progress step by step with great interest tor a few
yeais past Its operations have been managed
with skill and fidelity, and with as much regard to
economy, perhaps, as the extended opet «tons up-
on it would allow of The greatest jault is here
the lateness and smallness of the annual appiopr a-
tion, causes it to cost the Government at least
thirty per cent more than it would, if i íe annual
appropriation were larger, and made at earlier
periods of the season.    The time or amounts does
not allow portions worked upon to be finished,
and that which is done by labor m the summei, is
undons by the frosts in. the winter, and tiavel in
the spang, and at this time, su, through Indiana,
though graded, it is impassible Your mails can-
not be transported upon it with any tolerable speed
or safety, single horsemen fmd it diilicult to pass,
and yet its margin is strewed with materials go-
ing to waste, watting the action of this House only
to assume the place of melulness m the load. It
has not been long since the mail stage drove off a
dangerous temporary bridge, thtown over Blue
river, on this road, and greatly hazarded the lives
of a numbei of persons Of all things, the like of
this should be providedagainst those avers, should
be bridged, materials at least should be collecting
piepaiatory, that the luxuiy of stage riding, and
leceivmg early news of events, should be indulged
to the same extent, and in the same safety, in the
West, ih.u it is m othei poitious of the world,
where less is dont to enuoh ¡liecountry than there
The engineer ehaigod with this woik estimates
five hundied thousand dolíais for Indiana on this
lend, and I da conscieliuouslj believe it would be
e onomy and justice united, to apptopriate this
sum Then the w.Uci eourses could be ímme-
diatt ly bridged, md a laige poilion of the load
finished md reded to the Si ite, to be maintained
intl kept in ordei, then the mail* could be trans
pc ited witli ¡ess cost and lessha^aid of human life,
people could tiavel with comfoit, and the West
in u'd look to that high destiny to which the enter-
prise, intelligence, and industry of its people is ra-
pidly tending But, sir, make the appropriation
upon this load but little more lhan sufficient to re-
pan the lavagtsof the winter and travel of the
spimg, as many seem disposed to do, and you will
keep the Tre*siuy always paving, and the road re-
paiung and stationary I ask this House if the
Government does not owe it to those States through
which this road passes, to prosecute it vigorous!)
to final completion? Was not tins expectation a
stimulant to the purchase of w dd lands'? lias it
not already been the means of bringing millions,
directly and induced) , to the National Treasury,
which othei wise would never have found their wij
tb it' Has n not been the nit ms of stimulating
western an I southwestern production, so as to
make them together a neh mine to the nation?
Ihespi) esluitr nmst be answered m the afhrma
tive 'I Inn, sir, would it not be agn ss fraud upon
tin purehast is of those Government 1 mds, now to
del ly tint etessanl), or to abmdon th s woik? It
certain!) would 1 go further Laige amounts
have been invested m houses, p! uitatimis and
towns, upon the margin ol ¡bis rend, at prices
git ttlv beyond their value, unconmeled with it
and its prospects, upon thp faith that the Govern-
ment was in earnest in the acts lntljciting ,i pur-
pose to cam out the me isures begun Would it
not he a fiaud up in them now to suspend, or delay
the work' I think it would Ilavt any of the
Ameiicati p"opl< been taught to exptct impositions
an I frauds ol this thirat tei, at the hands of the
Go eminent2 No, su the) have been taught to
v i nt i ate its justice, and to admire its stable pursuit
of all the eteat measures to which its sovereign faith
h is been rt mmitte 1 by act < r deed Let them not
be disappointed m this measure
One other suggest! n think for the mnuteofthe
relition this work his ever been made to bear to
tne interests of the General Government, instead of
the State Govfrnments and the people of the States
through which it pas^ts When was the interest,
the pur e, or cost, of the States consulted in its
■octtion its commencement, termination, or con-
struction? Not at ail It has been prosecuted thus
far ext t tvely with a view to the business and
ubjeets in the care and keeping of the General
Government Tne inteiest of the States through
xv hieh it r>asse« has upon no occasion been con-
sulted m any thing in relation to it, as would have
been h? ' is 1 ication and construction devolved
( ng nal'v upo'itne Stales And no w si, would it
re ce nmon tit 'ice for the United States to aban
don it to the States in its tmnmsiied condition, still
rt taming extensive privileges and immunities in
us use, and expect the States to finish it according
to the original plan, and maintain and keep it up
for the common use of each? Mr. R. said h« con-
sidered such, a proposition disreputable to the
General Government, and should not for a mo-
ment be entertained by Congress, and to abandon
the road now to rum, or to permit operations to be
suspended upon it, would show an irresolution and
instability in the administrators of the Government
in the piosecutien of a great national object, un-
worthy of the people they represent. He would
not for a moment entertain such an idea, so hu-
miliating and so fraught with mischief to the pros-
pects of those who have expended their all upon
the margin of that road, in the confidence that the
Government was not alluring them to poverty and
destiuction He would not entertain the idea, for
a moment, that the immense treasure aheady ex-
pended, the effect of which is, in the present con-
dition of the road, to make it worse than before it
was began, should be wasted, and that the stone
and other matenals now lying upon its margin,
prepared for those permanent superstructures Tike
those which orn iment it in the old States, should
be set at nought and waste. He importuned Con-
gress to act speedily and liberally upon this mea-
suic Such a course would, he said, be worthy of
the great and good sptnts who had projected this
work, and bequeathed it to the West as the means
oi commerce and communion with their Atlantic
friends
Mr R said he had now utged upon the House
all the considerations which occurred to him to in-
duce its speedy and liberal action, and had only to
say further, that both justice and economy require
a speedy and literal appropriation for this work.
REMARKS OF MR   BOON,
Ok Indiana,
In the House of Representatives, Jipi il 17, 1838 —The
bill to remove the walls of the new Treasury
building being undei consideration—
Mr. BOON said he had a very few words to say,
and that most of what he might say would be in
leply to what had been said by the gentleman from
South Carolina who first addiessed the committee,
[Mi Thompson,] to whom, Mr. B. said, he always
listened with the most profound respect and atten-
uon. That gentleman had, m the course of his
rt marks, stated that the whole people of the coun-
try had been reduce! to a state of starvation by
the misrule of the late and present Administrations
of the General Government Now, Mr Chair-
mm, not knowing, I will not presume to say any
thing as to what may be the situation of that gen-
tleman's constituents, but I have the gratification
to know, that that portion of the people I have the
honor lo represent on this floor, are not only free
from starvation, or even want of ample subsistence,
but they have annually a very large surplus on
hand  Sir, the State of Indiana exports yearly an
average surplus of the products of the State, an
amount much larger than that consumed by her
own citizens This, to me, does not look much
like a state of starvation
But the gentleman from South Carolina had al-
luded more paiticulaily to the poverty and distress
of the people of New York. Now, said Mr. B it
is not my province to defend the people of New
York from any reproach that may be made upon
her, while she has on this floor so respectable a
number of Representatives, who are far more able
to defend her interests here or elsewhere than I am.
I it-collect that, during the panic season in the re-
cess which intervened last fall between the called
session and the commencement of the present ses-
sion of Congress, that some "Whig" chanties
xvere extended to the suffering poor of New York
city for political effect, and I recollect, too, that
about the same time a ten dollar Whig dinner was
got up in New York m honor of a distinguished
gentleman from the State of Tennessee1 Of what
kind of ingredients the dinner was composed or
made ot, I do not know, but the facts of the case
j>how that there could not have been the astual áts-
Ircsí in JNew York complained of by those who are
opposed to this Administration. So much, Mr.
Chairman, for the starving condition of the people
of the country in general, and of New York m
particular.
