WASHINGTON, D. C., April 11, 1863.

Major-General BURNSIDE,

Cincinnati:

Reports have been received here that Senator [Lazarus W.] Powell, candidate for Governor of Kentucky, has acted in a disloyal manner, and advocated the secession of that State from the Union. You will cause his conduct to be closely observed and reported to these headquarters.

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.

CINCINNATI, OHIO, April 11, 1863-3 p.m.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

Your dispatch received, and I will look out for Mr. Powell. There is nothing new this morning. No enemy north of the Cumberland, but a considerable force in Wayne County, with headquarters at Mill Springs. Hope to attack them in two or three days. A messenger from General Rosecrans is now here, and I will write you the result of the interview. There is nothing very definite as to the capture of trains on the Louisville and Nashville Railroad. General Wright telegraphs that the train reported captured has arrived at Nashville. Will telegraph again to-day. I move to the interior Monday or Tuesday. Have ordered court to try Major Prentice as a spy.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.

CINCINNATI, OHIO, April 11, 1863.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

The fortifications about Cincinnati are now nearly completed, and it would seem advisable not to stop their armament. I have assigned an infantry regiment for practice at the guns, and ask authority to make an artillery regiment of it, in which case it can readily be filled up to its maximum number, which will be sufficient to man the forts. A report has just been sent which reference to fortifications at Louisville, which I respectfully request permission to have erected at once by hired labor. The plan is to build eight small, inclosed works, all of which can be done within two or three weeks. These two very important points will then be perfectly secure, and a repetition of last summer's stampede avoided in case of any reverse. Instead of rendering the force in this department less mobile, it will enable us to concentrate large bodies to operate in the field without having to look so much to the rear. Shall I commence the works?

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE OHIO,Cincinnati, Ohio, April 11, 1863.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

The system of fortifying was adopted by General Wright, and I have not had time to look into the matter fully. He seems to have adopted it with a view to holding points with small forces.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.
