which bounded the plain on the north side of the river. No further opposition was made to our crossing. The enemy fled precipitately, pursued by one regiment of cavalry and the command of Brigadier-General Cameron. The pontoon bridge was laid shortly after dark, and the crossing of troops and trains was continued during the night, two brigades of the Nineteenth Corps being pushed forward some 6 miles to cover the train stretched out on the road. The crossing was completed at 2 p.m. on Sunday, the 24th. Throughout the forenoon the rear guard of General Smith's command was closely pressed by the enemy's cavalry, and was several times severely engaged. The enemy was, however, in every instance repulsed with a considerable loss of men and some artillery dismounted. The crossing being completed, the pontoon bridge was taken up, and the march was continued without further interruption or annoyance. The route taken from Cane River was by the crossing of Bayou Cotile at its mouth, on Red River, and thence to Henderson's Hill by the Cotile road. The troops were halted and encamped for the night between Henderson's Hill and Bayou Rapides. The march was resumed the next morning (Monday, the 25th) at 6 o'clock. The head of the column reached Alexandria (a distance of 20 miles) at 2 p.m., and the whole column was encamped in and about the town before night.

The troops performed the whole of this harassing and tedious march from Grand Ecore in good order and without demoralization, the only exception being such acts of marauding and incendiarism by stragglers in advance of the column as are incident to the retreat of a large army. Every effort has been and is being made to discover the perpetrators of these outrages, to whom the severest punishment will be awarded upon detection.

Very respectfully, yours,

W. B. FRANKLIN,

Major-General, Commanding.

Major GEORGE B. DRAKE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
