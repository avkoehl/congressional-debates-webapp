may be able to join your after you cross the Tallahatchie, and may intercept the enemy's retreat. Make every possible exertion to harass and destroy the enemy.

Take Hatch with you in the pursuit if you meet with him.

By order of Major General U. S. Grant:

JNO. A. RAWLINS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

SAULSBURY, December 24, 1862-after dark.

Major-General GRANT:

GENERAL: Have just arrived at this place; enemy still going southward, their rear only a mile ahead. We are constantly picking up their stragglers. Have just learned that they talk of turning to the left a short distance. Shall throw out scouts and observe their movements, and camp to-night without camp-fires. I sent you dispatch from Middleburg and also from Van Buren.

B. H. GRIERSON,

Colonel, Commanding Cavalry.

SAULSBURY, December 24, 1862.

Major-General GRANT:

GENERAL: Your dispatch received this evening. I am camped within 2 1/2 miles of the enemy. I sent out scouts, who reported to me an hour ago that they had left, still going south. I start in pursuit in one hour and will follow them to their den.

B. H. GRIERSON,

Colonel, Commanding.

BOLIVAR, December 24, 1862.

General SULLIVAN:

The enemy have appeared in our front, and Colonel Grierson has gone out with his entire command and I am with him, but shall return soon.

M. BRAYMAN,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

BOLIVAR, December 24, 1862.

Brigadier General J. C. SULLIVAN:

Just returned from outside lines. The enemy followed and drove in our pickets and are firing on infantry pickets. I have no fear of harm; it is probably the rear guard covering their movement north to join Forrest.

Colonels Grierson and Lee are here with 1,500 cavalry and will pursue until they overtake the enemy. I join the pursuit.

M. BRAYMAN,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
