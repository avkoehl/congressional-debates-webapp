HEADQUARTERS TWENTY-FIRST ARMY CORPS,Dunlap, Tenn., August 22, 1863-10 p.m.

Brigadier General T. J. WOOD,

Commanding Post, Therman:

Your two dispatches of to-day (latter with copy of report from General Wagner) are received.# The general commanding directs me to say that it is necessary that you send for supplies at once. You had better sent to McMinnville, to which place Generals Palmer and Van Cleve have sent, but he does not yet know that there are supplies there even for them. The general has telegraphed to department headquarters concerning your and other supplies, but at this moment has no further information than that contained in the general orders, of which you have a copy. The general is glad to receive General Wagner's report, and thinks that you do right in forwarding to him necessary supplies. As you have telegraphed the substance of this report to department headquarters, the general will await further instructions from there before making any change in the positions of the troops.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

P. P. OLDERSHAW,

Captain and Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS TWENTY-FIRST ARMY CORPS,Dunlap, Tenn., August 22, 1863-6 p.m.

Brigadier-General VAN CLEVE:

GENERAL: The officer in charge of couriers has arrived, bringing with [him] your dispatch of this date.## the general is pleased to find that Minty is better off than both you and he supposed as regards supplies. The general wishes to know what information you have as to the nature and extend of supplies now, and likely to arrive, at McMinnville. The general still needs another company of cavalry for courier line between Therman and Jasper, just as soon as you can spare it.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

P. P. OLDERSHAW,

Captain and Assistant Adjutant-General.
