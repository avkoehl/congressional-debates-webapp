HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI, In the Field, Big Shanty, June 13 [14?], 1864.

General WASHBURN, Memphis:

Your dispatch [June 12] is received. Under the circumstances, the expedition to Mobile should not be attempted. If General Canby can spare Smith's command, it should go out and meet Forrest, and check him. Al of Polk's command is here, including Loring's and French's DIVISIONS of infantry, as well as three brigades of cavalry, Starke's, Ferguson's and Ross', commanded by Jackson. I don't see what Forrest can have except his cavalry, and the militia under Gholson. They should be met and defeated at any and all cost.

W. T. SHERMAN,Major-General.

WHITE'S STATION, June 13, 1864.

Major-General WASHBURN:

I desire to have a personal interview with you in regard to the propriety of my being relieved from command, and for that purpose would like authority to visit Memphis this evening.

S. D. STURGIS,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

WHITE'S STATION, June 13, 1864.

Major-General WASHBURN:

A train is now out, and one regiment infantry and 700 cavalry to protect it. The last news was to the effect they were in line of battle, and nothing heard from them since the arrival of last train 4 o'clock. I fear the enemy may have destroyed a culvert or done injury to the road, or the train would have been in by this time. I am just sending all the available force here toward Germantown to be ready in case they are needed.

S. D. STURGIS,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
