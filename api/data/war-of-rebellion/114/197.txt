Colonel J. D. STEVENSON,

You are intrusted to move with such force as you deem necessary to the county seats of the counties adjacent to you and to appoint the committees of public safety specified in the printed order, distributing that order as extensively as possible and notifying the people that its provisions will be strictly and vigorously enforced.

In selecting members of the committees you appoint be careful to take men of substance and respectability, preferring those of secession proclivities. I desire it to be made known that the safety of person and property in all that region of country will depend upon the preservation of peace and order and that the best and only protection to family and property will be the presence of every man at home engaged in his usual pursuits.

Report to me the names, places of residence, &amp;c., of all you appoint on these committees and your whole action in the matter.
