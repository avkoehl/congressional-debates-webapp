Sir, said Mr. B lam utterly opposed to any system
of raising revenue for the purpose of distribution
among the States Such a system was nevei con-
templated by the framers ot the Constitution We
hare recently experienced the bad effects of a dis-
tribution of the surplus revenue among the several
States. It was found that before the fourth instal-
ment of the surplus revenue was deposited with the
States, the Treasury of the United States was defi-
cient in revenue over nine millions of dollars
Now, Mr Speaker, from what source of reve-
nue was this large surplus of 1836 derived? Suie-
ly not from duties imposed on foreign merchandise,
but from the great increase of land sales by the
Government Previous to the year 1835, the re-
ceipts into the Treasury fiom the sales of the pub-
lic lands varied from two and a half to three and a
half millions of dollars per annum In 1835 and
1836, the amount received into the Treasury from
the same source increased to nearly thirty-five mil
lions of dollars, and notwithstanding the amount
since received into the Treasury from sales of the
publ c land, your Treasury is now deficient many
millions of dollars in consequence of your distribu-
tion act. And yet the gentleman from Kentucky is in
favor of withholding, or withdrawing the whole
amount of revenue received from the sales of the
public lands from the Treasury of the Unittd
States, to be scrambled for, and wasted by the
twenty-six States of the Union Should tins poliej
be adopted, there must, and mil be, a very large
deficiency in the Treasury for the ordinary pul-
póles of Government, which will have to be made
up by an increase of the tanff Mr B admonish-
ed those gentlemen who were opposed to a high
tariff, not to withdraw fiom the Treasury the reve-
nue derived from the sales of the public lands, to
be distributed among the several States, as such a
policy would inevitably lead to an .«« eiise oí Ihe
tariff
Mr B said that neither the gentleman from
Kentucky nor himself, represented a manufactur-
ing people Our constituents, said he, are most-
ly farmers and mechanics, who are the coimtmei s of
articles manufactured, and whilst he would not
knowingly give a vote to operate injuriously upon
the manufacturing mteiest of the country, he
would guard the interests of his constituents against
the undue influence of chartered monopolies of
every kind Mr B was m favor ot a t-irifi which
had for its object ihe raising of revenue, and the
giving ef reasonable ?ndjust protection to home
industry But, said he, I come to ihe subject m re
immediately under consideration The National
road now being consti ucted in the States ol Ohio, In-
diana, and Illinois, has thus fat progressed in con-
formity with the compacts betw een the General
Government and those State*, íespectively, by
which they were admitted into the Federü union
It was conditioned by acts oí Congress admitting
those States into the Union, that two per cent ol
the nett proceeds arising from the sales of the pub
lie lands should be applied under the dnectionof
Congress, in the making of roads to those Stiles,
respectively In Ohio, this road is completed to
some twenty miles west of Columbus. In the
States of Indiana and Illinois, the grubbing of lh<?
road has been completed, and considerable pro-
gress has been made m grading and electing
bridges, without any portion of the road having
been completed in either of those States,
and now the gentleman from Kentucky
proposes that the General Government shall
aband*  this great national improvement, and
surrender it, in. its present unfinished condition,
to the States through which it passes Mr Speak-
er, I will not tike up more of the time of the House
in discussing this question, but I mil put it to gen-
tlemen who have heretofore voted for appropna-
ttons for carrying on this greit work of national
importance, to siy whether they aie now prepare I
to abandon it to its fate Sir, ihe construction of
this road over the mountain's ind through the new
States, has and will induce many thousands h emi-
grate to the West and putilnscine Government
lands, by which means jour Treasjiy will be more
than reimbursed for all that will be required to corn
plete this great work I hope, therefore, that Ihe
friends of this road will promptly reject the proposi
tion of the gentleman from Kentucky, and that the
bill may be passed without further delay.

RELATIONS WITK MEXICO
Mr WALKER rose and called the atten'ion of
the chauman ol the Coirrnittce on Foreign Rela-
tions [Mr Buchanan J to the state of  ur relations
with Mexico It would be recollected, he said, that
this subject w?s recommended to the con i leration
oí the Senate lj a special message ¡rom the Piesi
dent of the Unile 1 Stales on the 7th oí February,
1837
Htre Mr W read extract  fron line n°ssage,
which íecommenls, "thüt to ivoid all misconcep-
tion on the part of Mexico, as well as to protect
our own national chawotwr from reproach, (one
more opportunity should be given to atone for the
past belore taking redress into our own hands,)
with the avowed design, and full preparation to
take immediate satisfaction, if it should not be ob-
tained on a repetition of the demand for it " The
message adds "To this end, I recommend that an
act be passed authorizing reprisals, and that the
use of the naval force of the United States by the
Executive against Mexico, to enforce them, in the
event of a refusal by the Mexican Government to
come to an amicable adjustment of the matters in
controversy between u , upon another demand
thereof, made from on board one of our vessels
of war on the coast ol Mexico " This message was
referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations,
and on the 18th February following, Mr. Bucha-
nan, ihe chairman of that committee, reported the
following resolution
Resolved, That the Senate concur in opinion
with the President of the United States, that
another demand oug^t to be made for the rsdress
of our grievances from the Mexican Government,
the mode and manner of which, undei the 34th
article of the treaty, so far as it may be applica-
ble, are pioperly confided to his discretion They
cannot doubt, from the justice of our claims, that
this demand will result m speedy redress, but
should they be disappointed in this reasonable
expectation, a state ot things will then have oe-
cuired which will make it the imperative duty of
Congress promptly to consider what further mea-
sures may be lequired by the honor of the nation
and ihe rights oí our injured fel'ow-citizens
On the 27th of February, 1837, this resolution
was unanimously adopted by the Senate by a vote
of ayes 47, noes none New, said Mr. W. we
all know that this demand has been again made,
and that it has been ineffectual, that new insults
and injuries have been superadded by Mexico since
this peuod, that her departing Minister had grossly
insulted this Government and country, and his con-
duct had been approved by Mexico, that her Secre-
tary of Foreign Affairs had recently published a
report most insulting to our national honor, and to
close the long list of Mexican outrages, her vessels
oí war had recently, m our own seas, fired
upon an American steamboat, carrying the Ame
rican Hag, and prosesutmg a lawful commerce,
with a neighboring and friendly power This ves-
sel had not only been fired upon, and an attempt
made to «aptureher, but the balls had been fired
through the American flag, as if m derision of the
idea that this flag constituted any protection
against Mexican outrages. The flag of our country
had ceased then to he any protection to the Ameri-
can citizen, >n our own vessels, and upon our own
seas, as indeed the name of an American had long
ceased lo piotect our citizens within the limits of
Mexico Not only had it ceased to be any protec-
tion there, but it constituted an invitation to m-ult,
imprisonment, and spoliations More than a
year had elapsed since the adoption of
the íesolution above referred to The justice
oí our claims on Mexico was then declared
to be undoubted, and, if speedy redress was not
granted, t'->e Senate resolved i nammously that
prompt measures would be required to sustain ' the
honor of the nation and the rights of our injured
fellow-citizens " No redress has been, it is clear
none will be, granted by Mexico, but every day's
delay on our part only witnesses new outrages
and new insults Mr W said he was informed
by a most respectable cit ¿en of Pemsylvann,
lately residing m Mexico, and well known to tne
honorable chairman, [Mr Buchanan,] that our
commerce, «arried on by our resident merchants m
Mexico, had been reduced from three millions to
three hundred thousand dollars per annum, and
that, unless som  means were speedily taken to
protect our citizens from Mexican spoliations and
insults, this commerce would soon be entnel} ex-
tinguished Four months and upwards had no v
elapsed since the commencement ol this session,
anil no report had been made by the Committee on
Foreign Relations, and no intimation given when,
if ever, an} íeport might be expected
Mr VV then ro«e to inquire of the chairman of
the committee [Mr Buchanin] if it was the inten-
tion of the cqmimtlee to report  upon this subject,
